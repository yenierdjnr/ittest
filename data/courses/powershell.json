00:00:16,130\nWhat we're doing is we're recording\na series of videos that are covering\n\n4\n00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,990\nhow to use the Windows PowerShell.\n\n5\n00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,400\nWe're seeing a bigger and bigger push\nfrom Microsoft use PowerShell for\n\n6\n00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,150\nall sorts of things, and the product's\nreally advanced over the years.\n\n7\n00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,890\nIt's wonderful for\ndoing things like automation and\n\n8\n00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,980\nscripting activities to occur in sequence\nthat you don't have to go through and\n\n9\n00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,130\ndo them over and over again yourself.\n\n10\n00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,440\nSometimes you have multiple servers\nthat you want to configure and\n\n11\n00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,010\nyou don't want to go and\ndo each one individually.\n\n12\n00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,770\nWe can write a PowerShell Script and\nit'll knock them all out for us in one go.\n\n13\n00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,340\nIt's really pretty cool.\n\n14\n00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,200\nBut it is a lot different than\nthe command prompt that we're used to.\n\n15\n00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,870\nOr maybe you're not used to\nthe command prompt at all.\n\n16\n00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,120\nMaybe you're an all GUI person,\nplenty of people are these days.\n\n17\n00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,700\nSo the Powershell can\nbe a little daunting,\n\n18\n00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,530\nand that's what this program aims to fix.\n\n19\n00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,510\nWe're gonna take a look at,\nwell, some of the basics first.\n\n20\n00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,300\nWe'll start out with just what the\nPowerShell is and how the interface works.\n\n21\n00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,300\nThe interface is pretty neat, and there's\nsome really cool tools and shortcuts that\n\n22\n00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,260\nwe can use just right in the basic\ninterface that can help us out a lot.\n\n23\n00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,580\nFrom there, we're going to start\nadvancing into other topics.\n\n24\n00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,530\nLet me show you the outline that\nwe've kind of worked up for this.\n\n25\n00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,000\nUnlike a lot of shows on ITProTV,\nthis show is not built around a particular\n\n26\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,620\ncertification, so\nwe're going freestyle here.\n\n27\n00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,340\nWe're basically adding whatever\nwe feel is appropriate, and\n\n28\n00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,440\nby we, I mean most of this is myself and\nour other host Mike Roderick.\n\n29\n00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,190\nWe've taken a look at the various\nPowerShell commands that we think most\n\n30\n00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,980\npeople need to know it to be prepared for\nthe exams and prepared for the real world.\n\n31\n00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,790\nSo, like I said,\n\n32\n00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,950\nwe're gonna start out right here with\nthe introduction to the PowerShell.\n\n33\n00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,480\nWe'll just go over some of those\nbasic commands, general syntax,\n\n34\n00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,770\nhow we can use the interface.\n\n35\n00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,900\nFrom there, we'll start to focus\non the more practical skills.\n\n36\n00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,720\nWe'll have a series of videos that\nare focusing on server management.\n\n37\n00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,833\nThese are generic tasks that\nare performed on every Windows server.\n\n38\n00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,457\nI might be adding roles,\nremoving features, managing services,\n\n39\n00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:04,660\nwhatever it is that we need to do as part\nof the day to day operations of a server.\n\n40\n00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,034\nThen we're gonna focus in on DNS, how to\nget DNS, domain naming system, configured\n\n41\n00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:14,020\non a server, and how to work with zones\nand other records all from the PowerShell.\n\n42\n00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,610\nWe'll proceed to DHCP,\ndynamic host configuration protocol, and\n\n43\n00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,080\nhow to manage it.\n\n44\n00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,150\nAnd then the big one, active directory.\n\n45\n00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,890\nI know it doesn't look that\nbig here in the outline, but\n\n46\n00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,620\nthere's actually quite a bit to it.\n\n47\n00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,520\nCreating the active directory,\nworking with user accounts,\n\n48\n00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,000\ngroups, organizational units,\ngroup policy objects,\n\n49\n00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,805\nall of that stuff that's buried inside\nthe active directory, you can completely\n\n50\n00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:37,785\ninterface with it via the PowerShell,\nand then we're going to tackle Hyper-V.\n\n51\n00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:40,265\nHow do you get Hyper-V installed?\n\n52\n00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:43,595\nHow to manage virtual machines,\ncreating them, starting, stopping, taking\n\n53\n00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:48,635\nsnapshots, all those other things that are\npart of the routine operation of Hyper-V.\n\n54\n00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,745\nNow, depending on when\nyou watch this show,\n\n55\n00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,740\nthere may just be these videos available.\n\n56\n00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,340\nBut if it's been a year or\n\n57\n00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,110\nhowever long, you may see that we have\nquite a bit more content than that.\n\n58\n00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,070\nAnd that's because this isn't based\naround an exam set of objectives.\n\n59\n00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,660\nWe're not waiting on Microsoft\nto tell us what to cover.\n\n60\n00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,090\nInstead, we're just figuring it out.\n\n61\n00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,460\nWhatever we feel like needs to be in\nthere we're throwing it in there.\n\n62\n00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,590\nAnd that means that if you have any ideas,\nif there was something you\n\n63\n00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,980\ndidn't see on that outline that\nyou want covered, let us know.\n\n64\n00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,370\nPost in the Q & A forums,\n\n65\n00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,510\nyou can just go right in there into the\nMicrosoft forum and post and say hey, Don,\n\n66\n00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,770\nI'd really like it if you did a section\non Microsoft SQL or Microsoft Exchange,\n\n67\n00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,500\nyou covered some of the PowerShell\nstuff that's available from those.\n\n68\n00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,230\nIf that's something that interests you,\ngreat, throw it on there.\n\n69\n00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,870\nIt's not on any of the exams\nthat our site prepares you for,\n\n70\n00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,610\nat least not yet, but it's something\nthat's useful to know and we'll do it,\n\n71\n00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,050\nwe'll film it and get thrown on there.\n\n72\n00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,140\nSo if it's not on the outline, just let\nus know, we'll work to get it added.\n\n73\n00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,333\nBut these are kind of the major ones.\n\n74\n00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,519\nThese are definitely ones that you need\nto know if you're getting ready for\n\n75\n00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,917\nthe 70-410, 70-411 and 70-412 exams.\n\n76\n00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:55,029\nAnd so we try to basically\nwrap all those together, but\n\n77\n00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:58,083\nwe're definitely willing\nto extend that as needed.\n\n78\n00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:02,034\nAll right, so that's what we're about to\njump into, and without further delay,\n\n79\n00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,625\nwe'll go ahead and get started.\n\n80\n00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:09,724\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,998\n[SOUND]\nIn this segment,\n\n2\n00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:12,667\nwe're just gonna take a quick moment\nto do an Introduction to PowerShell.\n\n3\n00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,289\nThe odds are,\nif you've come here to watch these videos,\n\n4\n00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:18,231\nyou already know what the PowerShell is,\nbut I find it's a good,\n\n5\n00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:21,734\nhealthy idea [LAUGH] to make sure we have\na basic understanding of the concept.\n\n6\n00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:24,150\nAnd so,\nthat's just what we'll tackle right here.\n\n7\n00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,060\nThe Windows Powershell is a new\n\n8\n00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,440\ncommand line interface that's\navailable for Windows.\n\n9\n00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,090\nNow, I say new, but\nit actually came out in 2006, and\n\n10\n00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,530\nso it's about eight years old now.\n\n11\n00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,350\nIt's pretty mature,\nit's in use by a lot of organizations.\n\n12\n00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,690\nBut it's new compared to\nour old command line.\n\n13\n00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,040\nIn Windows NT, we had just the CMD,\nthe command interpreter.\n\n14\n00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,000\nAnd prior to that,\nwe had the DOS command interpreter.\n\n15\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,130\nSo, it was a different environment back\nthen, a different set of commands.\n\n16\n00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,630\nPowerShell looks to replace those\nold command line interfaces.\n\n17\n00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,790\nAnd basically, upgrade them into a new\nworld where we have a lot more power, and\n\n18\n00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,950\nflexibility.\n\n19\n00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,990\nOver the years, Microsoft has seen\nthe Linux environment grow, and\n\n20\n00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,050\ngrow, and grow.\n\n21\n00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,830\nAnd one of the powerful features\nin the Linux environment,\n\n22\n00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,630\nis that the command line that you choose,\nthe Shell.\n\n23\n00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,480\nIf you choose the BASH Shell,\nor TCSH, or one of those guys,\n\n24\n00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,810\nyou can do darn near programming language\nright from the command prompt, and\n\n25\n00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,200\nthat makes it very powerful for\nscripting, and automation.\n\n26\n00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,030\nAnd so, Microsoft sought to\nbring feature parity there.\n\n27\n00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,695\nTo be able to bring that functionality\ninto the Windows environment, so\n\n28\n00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:33,057\nwe weren't relying on Linux tools.\n\n29\n00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:34,903\nAnd the PowerShell is what came of that.\n\n30\n00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:41,114\nNow, the PowerShell was released in 2006\nfor Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.\n\n31\n00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:44,857\nAnd at the time, it was just called\nPowerShell version 1.0, and you could go,\n\n32\n00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:47,320\nand download it from Microsoft's website.\n\n33\n00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,020\nSo if you were running Windows XP,\nor Windows Server 2003,\n\n34\n00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,600\nyou didn't have the PowerShell by default.\n\n35\n00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,960\nYou had to go, and download it.\n\n36\n00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,320\nSo on those machines,\nyou still had the regular command prompt.\n\n37\n00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,290\nAnd from there you'd go in, and execute\nyour regular command line utilities, and\n\n38\n00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,670\nthat's what you had.\n\n39\n00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,461\nBut if you went, and\ndownloaded the PowerShell,\n\n40\n00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:08,390\nnow the PowerShell with\na new command prompt.\n\n41\n00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,560\nYou still had all your old commands.\n\n42\n00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,520\nAll your old commands still worked.\n\n43\n00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,271\nBut now, you have a lot of new stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:16,609\nAnd because Microsoft created\nthis from the ground up,\n\n45\n00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:18,322\nthey were able to modify it.\n\n46\n00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:21,116\nHowever, they needed to\nan ideal environment, and\n\n47\n00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:24,130\nthe first thing they did\nis they brought in logic.\n\n48\n00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,360\nSo, we can do darn near programming.\n\n49\n00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,270\nYou can do what's effectively\nlike Visual Basic script almost\n\n50\n00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,130\nfrom the command prompt, and\nit'll execute that on the fly.\n\n51\n00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,990\nIt does just in time compiling,\nand it's really cool.\n\n52\n00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,940\nBut it also is packed-full of\njust whole new sets of commands.\n\n53\n00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,700\nThey're called commandlets, and\n\n54\n00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,580\nthose commands can do all sorts of things\nfrom creating users, to stopping services,\n\n55\n00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,650\nto shutting down the computer,\nquerying values.\n\n56\n00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,110\nYou can do a ton of stuff.\n\n57\n00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,800\nAnd even better, it's fully extendable.\n\n58\n00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,410\nOther companies can write\ntheir own commandlets.\n\n59\n00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,350\nThey can extend that functionality,\nand then you can import those to make\n\n60\n00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,070\nuse of them yourself, and\nMicrosoft extends it also.\n\n61\n00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,040\nIn fact, PowerShell version\n1.0 is what came out in 2006.\n\n62\n00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,810\nWe're now on PowerShell 4.0,\nwith 5.0 on the horizon.\n\n63\n00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,380\nAnd with each one,\nthey're introducing new commandlets.\n\n64\n00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,720\nNew commands we can use to execute,\nand perform all sorts of activities.\n\n65\n00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,210\nSo, let's just run down some of\nthe additions real quick, so\n\n66\n00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,665\nwe understand the differences\nthat are out there.\n\n67\n00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:28,125\nThe most common PowerShell that\nyou'll encounter out there,\n\n68\n00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,930\nis PowerShell version 2.0.\n\n69\n00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,005\nVersion 1.0 was the first one, and\nyou had to go, and download it to have it.\n\n70\n00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,375\nSo not many people did,\nunless you had a specific need for it.\n\n71\n00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,990\nBut PowerShell version 2.0 was\nthe first one to be included\n\n72\n00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,435\nwith a Microsoft operating system.\n\n73\n00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:47,123\nPowerShell version 2.0 was included\nby default in Windows 7, and\n\n74\n00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:48,990\nWindows Server 2008.\n\n75\n00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,850\nWhich are the most common\nMicrosoft platforms.\n\n76\n00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,810\nThat's why PowerShell version 2.0 is so\ncommon.\n\n77\n00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,270\nSo, if you're out and about, and\nyou sit down at a machine at work, and\n\n78\n00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,440\nyou fire up PowerShell,\nthe odds are you're firing up 2.0.\n\n79\n00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,721\nNow, 2.0 is very similar to 1.0,\nit just has some stability enhancements,\n\n80\n00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:07,627\na few new features people asked for.\n\n81\n00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,971\nIt's available for\ndownload for Windows XP, for\n\n82\n00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:14,163\nWindows Vista, for Windows Server 2003.\n\n83\n00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:17,470\nSo, if you have those older OSs you could\ngo, and download it, and have it, or\n\n84\n00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,890\nyou could stay on PowerShell\n1.0 if you really wanted to.\n\n85\n00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,280\nBut the main things that were added, well,\n\n86\n00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,710\nthere's one feature that was added that\nI use all the time, and that's remoting.\n\n87\n00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,670\nThe ability to execute PowerShell\ncommands not on the computer\n\n88\n00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,120\nthat you're sitting at,\nbut on a remote computer.\n\n89\n00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,760\nAnd that's really cool because you\nmight be on your Windows 7 laptop,\n\n90\n00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,090\nand you're trying to work with\na Windows Server 2012 machine.\n\n91\n00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,400\nAnd you wanna execute a PowerShell\ncommands on that remote machine.\n\n92\n00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,250\nAnd that remoting functionality\nis what gives you that ability.\n\n93\n00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,690\nWe've also got the PowerShell ISE, which\nis an integrated scripting environment.\n\n94\n00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,640\nI almost wanna call it\na graphical user interface.\n\n95\n00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,208\nIt really isn't thought.\n\n96\n00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,101\nIt's a neat utility,\n\n97\n00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:55,876\nwe'll see it in an episode that we're\ngonna film here in a little bit.\n\n98\n00:04:55,876 --> 00:05:00,746\nBut it's a intelligent graphical system\nthat you can use to type in all your\n\n99\n00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:05,153\ncommands, and it'll do syntax checking,\nand colorization, and\n\n100\n00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:09,300\nall that other stuff to help\nyou with writing good scripts.\n\n101\n00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,250\nSo, those were both added\nin PowerShell version 2.0,\n\n102\n00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,070\nand that's where it really\nstarted to see general adoption.\n\n103\n00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,688\nThis is where we saw people\nabandoning the old command prompt,\n\n104\n00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:23,613\nabandoning their old batch files, and CMD\nscripts, and moving over to PowerShell.\n\n105\n00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:28,025\nWell, in 2012 PowerShell 3.0 came out.\n\n106\n00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:32,320\nI don't know, if I mentioned a date\non 2.0, 2.0 that was in 2009.\n\n107\n00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,760\nSo three years later, in 2012 we\nhad PowerShell 3.0, it came out.\n\n108\n00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,820\nIt's pre-installed in Windows 8,\nand Windows Server 2012.\n\n109\n00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,760\nSo you kind of see, whenever a new\nversion of Windows comes out typically,\n\n110\n00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,538\na new version of PowerShell comes out too.\n\n111\n00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,500\nIt was pre-installed on Windows 8, and\nServer 2012, but it was available for\n\n112\n00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,670\ndownload.\n\n113\n00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,094\nBut this was the first time that\nMicrosoft cut off some operating systems.\n\n114\n00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:58,296\nIt's available for download for\nWindows 7, and Windows Server 2008.\n\n115\n00:05:58,296 --> 00:06:02,330\nIt's not available for\nWindows XP, or Windows Vista.\n\n116\n00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,680\nAnd so, on those systems, Powershell\n2.0 is the highest that you can go.\n\n117\n00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,380\nAnd again, that's why Powershell\n2.0 is still the most common.\n\n118\n00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,680\nBut it added some good stuff, one of\nmy favorite features that it added was\n\n119\n00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,500\nthe ability to do updates for\nthe help files.\n\n120\n00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,700\nSometimes the help files that come\nwith it aren't very detailed, or\n\n121\n00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,000\nthey change over time due to hot fixes.\n\n122\n00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000\nWell, now, you can dynamically\nupdate the help files, and\n\n123\n00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000\nyou can stay up to date, and\nget some really good help there.\n\n124\n00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,010\nThe other thing is it brought in\nsomething called Intellisense to the ISE.\n\n125\n00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,790\nIn the ISE, if you start to type\na command, it'll show you suggestions for\n\n126\n00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,940\nwhat the remainder of\nthat command could be.\n\n127\n00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,160\nIt's a feature that's been found\nin Visual Studio for a long time.\n\n128\n00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,020\nThey just brought that over\ninto PowerShell in version 3.0.\n\n129\n00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,848\nThe current, stable version of PowerShell\nthough, is PowerShell 4.0, and\n\n130\n00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:50,630\nit just came out in 2013.\n\n131\n00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,150\nSo, it's pretty new.\n\n132\n00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,340\nIt's pre-installed on Windows 8.1,\nand Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n133\n00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,915\nIt's available for download for\nWindows 8, Windows Server 2008,\n\n134\n00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,654\nWindows Server 2012, and Windows 7.\n\n135\n00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:05,493\nSo, you can download it for\nthose guys, but\n\n136\n00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,960\nanybody prior to Windows 7 can't have it.\n\n137\n00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,360\nSo that is the latest, and greatest,\nand that's what I'm gonna be using for\n\n138\n00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720\nall the shows that we go through.\n\n139\n00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,610\nWe'll be sticking with PowerShell 4.0.\n\n140\n00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,870\nNow, it added a few things that are not\nnecessarily noticeable to a lot of people.\n\n141\n00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,680\nThere's enhanced script security,\nMicrosoft wanted to ensure that\n\n142\n00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,870\nmalicious scripts couldn't run on\nyour system using the PowerShell.\n\n143\n00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,200\nSo, we'll see some changes there,\nand some enhanced debugging.\n\n144\n00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,381\nWhen problems happen, Powershell 4.0\ncan give you more detailed logs,\n\n145\n00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:34,529\nand information about it.\n\n146\n00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:40,016\nNow, Powershell 5.0 is on the horizon,\nMicrosoft has announced Windows 10,\n\n147\n00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:43,433\nand Windows 10 will come\nwith Powershell 5.0.\n\n148\n00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:47,850\nThere's no release date yet, although\nthey're saying it'll be in the first, or\n\n149\n00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,030\nsecond quarter of 2015 is kind\nof what they're looking at now.\n\n150\n00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,480\nAnd when it comes out,\nthere'll be new features there too.\n\n151\n00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,240\nThe only one I'm really aware of so far,\nis something called package control.\n\n152\n00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,386\nRemember, I mentioned that\nPowerShell is extendable,\n\n153\n00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:04,685\nthat we can add more functionality to it.\n\n154\n00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:08,121\nWell, it gets a little challenging when\nyou've got add ons from five different\n\n155\n00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,803\nvendors, and how do you know\nif there's updates, and so on.\n\n156\n00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:14,901\nWell, in Powershell 5.0,\nyou'll have what are called repositories.\n\n157\n00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:17,525\nThe PowerShell can reach out\nto these repositories, and\n\n158\n00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:19,778\nmake sure it has the latest\naddition of an add on.\n\n159\n00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:22,970\nAnd then if an update comes out,\nIt can dynamically do the update.\n\n160\n00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,630\nIt's a really cool feature.\n\n161\n00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,660\nIt's another thing found in\nLinux platforms pretty commonly.\n\n162\n00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,633\nMicrosoft is now integrating\nthat into their PowerShell too.\n\n163\n00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:32,370\nSo, PowerShell 5.0,\nthat's the one I'm excited about.\n\n164\n00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,320\nI'm looking forward to getting into that.\n\n165\n00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,730\nBut for now,\nPowerShell 4.0 is what's stable.\n\n166\n00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,480\nThat's a little bit of\nhistory about the PowerShell.\n\n167\n00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,170\nI talked a little bit about what it is,\n\n168\n00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,510\na command line interface where we can\ndo all sorts of really cool stuff.\n\n169\n00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,540\nAnd that's what's gonna lead into all\nthe rest of the remaining segments of\n\n170\n00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,146\nthis series is.\n\n171\n00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,160\nDon, what's the cool stuff?\n\n172\n00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,450\nWell, we're gonna see that.\n\n173\n00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,850\nWe'll get a chance to take a look at\nhow that command line interface works,\n\n174\n00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,860\nwe'll get a chance to see it,\nand continue to work with it.\n\n175\n00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,600\nBut for right now, I think that's a pretty\ngood Introduction to the PowerShell, and\n\n176\n00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,650\nits history.\n\n177\n00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,692\nAnd now, we're ready to get\nstarted with the learning.\n\n178\n00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:15,056\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:08,220\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,501\nIn this segment we're going to take a look\nat the basic ways that we can input\n\n3\n00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:12,945\ncommands into the PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:15,655\nYou might be thinking to yourself\ncome on Don it's a command.\n\n5\n00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:17,185\nYou just type it and press enter.\n\n6\n00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,255\nWhat's more to it?\n\n7\n00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:22,035\nWell there's actually probably a good\nfive or six different ways we can\n\n8\n00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:26,075\nfeed commands into the PowerShell and\nit's pretty interesting how that works.\n\n9\n00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:27,935\nSo I want to show you each of those and\n\n10\n00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,645\nget you kind of familiar\nwith the basic syntax.\n\n11\n00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:34,445\nFirst off, the commands that we run,\nthey're not technically commands.\n\n12\n00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:36,810\nMicrosoft calls them commandlets.\n\n13\n00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,868\nAnd commandlets, that's just their little\nname that says that it's really a program,\n\n14\n00:00:40,868 --> 00:00:44,500\nand that command might\ndo more than one thing.\n\n15\n00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,900\nIf you think about the old style command\nline, commands, you'd type something\n\n16\n00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,930\nlike DIR and press enter,\nwell that was the directory command.\n\n17\n00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,620\nIt would pull up the directory and\nwhat files were in the directory.\n\n18\n00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,160\nDid one thing.\n\n19\n00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,850\nThat's how most commands work.\n\n20\n00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,860\nBut commandlets might actually\ncause a chain of events to happen.\n\n21\n00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,190\nSo that's why Microsoft just uses\na slightly different term for it.\n\n22\n00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,260\nCommandlets are really easy to spot\nbecause their names are always made up of\n\n23\n00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,480\ntwo pieces.\n\n24\n00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,420\nThere's a verb and\na hyphen, followed by noun.\n\n25\n00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,760\nThat verb is normally something like,\nget, set, modify, remove, right?\n\n26\n00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,280\nIt's an action,\nit's something that you're doing.\n\n27\n00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,920\nAnd then there's a hyphen\nfollowed by a noun and\n\n28\n00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,760\nthe noun is normally what\nit is you're modifying.\n\n29\n00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,840\nSo, for example, let me show you what's\nprobably the most important command that\n\n30\n00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,840\nwe're going to learn\nin this entire series,\n\n31\n00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,820\nwhich is the Get-Help command, all right.\n\n32\n00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,630\nGet, that's the verb.\n\n33\n00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,170\nI'm telling it I want to get something.\n\n34\n00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,088\nGet it and show it to me.\n\n35\n00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:45,020\nAnd then -Help, I want to pull up\nthe help for PowerShell, all right?\n\n36\n00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,150\nIf you ever wanna learn\nmore about a command and\n\n37\n00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,130\nfind information out about it,\nGet-Help is your go to guy.\n\n38\n00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,440\nThis is probably\nthe command I run the most.\n\n39\n00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,470\nSo, Get-Help, we just type it right\ninto the PowerShell and we press enter.\n\n40\n00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,160\nNow, with a commandlet,\nit's designed to run in the PowerShell.\n\n41\n00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,110\nHow do I know if I'm in the PowerShell?\n\n42\n00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,630\nYou might not be, right?\n\n43\n00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,560\nWindows still has the original\nshell present, right?\n\n44\n00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,400\nSo, it's not like it went away.\n\n45\n00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,590\nI've got it right here and\nI can pull it up.\n\n46\n00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,840\nAnd we can make use of it or\nwhatever it is that we want to do.\n\n47\n00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,510\nLet me just kind of change this font so\nI can actually read what's on the screen.\n\n48\n00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,490\nThere we go.\n\n49\n00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,440\nSo here I am but\nthe difference is in this command prompt\n\n50\n00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,530\nif I do DIR all the commands\nwe're used to, they work.\n\n51\n00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,890\nBut if I type Get-Help I get that\nit's not a program that's recognized.\n\n52\n00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,970\nIt doesn't work, right?\n\n53\n00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,040\nSo it's not a command prompt command.\n\n54\n00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,930\nBut if I get back here to my PowerShell\nand I type Get-help, there it is.\n\n55\n00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,810\nIt just did a bunch of stuff, right?\n\n56\n00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,060\nIt scrolled by really fast.\n\n57\n00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,630\nBut that's basically it running, right?\n\n58\n00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,250\nThe Windows PowerShell\nhas that functionality.\n\n59\n00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,980\nMicrosoft wants to remind you of\nwhen you're in the PowerShell, and\n\n60\n00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,060\nthat's why it looks so different.\n\n61\n00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,730\nYou'll notice when I pulled up that\nregular command prompt it was black\n\n62\n00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,300\nwith gray text, and the prompt was just,\nC:\\Users\\Don Pazet, and\n\n63\n00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,830\nthat was it, but here in PowerShell\nit's blue with a white text,\n\n64\n00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,040\nand it's got PS written\nat the very beginning.\n\n65\n00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,970\nThat's the reminder to me saying,\noh I'm in the PowerShell.\n\n66\n00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,940\nNow I'm on a Windows Server 2012 machine,\nand you'll see in Windows Server 2012,\n\n67\n00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,380\nPowerShell is added to\nyour task bar by default.\n\n68\n00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,380\nSo it's right there and you can launch it.\n\n69\n00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,280\nIn Windows 7 and\n8 it's installed by default, but\n\n70\n00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,210\nit's not under your Start menu.\n\n71\n00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,010\nI mean, under your task bar.\n\n72\n00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,672\nIn Windows 7 it is under your Start menu.\n\n73\n00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:33,040\nIf you pull up your Start menu and\ngo into All Programs,\n\n74\n00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,730\nyou'll find it sitting right in there.\n\n75\n00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,755\nIn In Windows 8 you can just use the\nsearch functionality on your start screen.\n\n76\n00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:43,125\nIf you bring up your start screen you\ncan type powershell or just power and\n\n77\n00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,405\nit'll be one of the first\nthings that comes up.\n\n78\n00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:47,692\nSo, quick and easy to get into it.\n\n79\n00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:50,982\nAnd then you're in your PowerShell.\n\n80\n00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:54,052\nAnd once you're there, you're able to\nstart using the PowerShell commands.\n\n81\n00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:57,532\nYou can type Get-Help and\nit's going to return that information.\n\n82\n00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:02,482\nNow, PowerShell is,\nlike the name implies, pretty powerful.\n\n83\n00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:06,172\nSo, there are a ton of commands\nthat are available in there.\n\n84\n00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:11,860\nIf you ever want to see the full list,\nthere's a command that is Get-Command.\n\n85\n00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,820\nThis is another great one that we can run.\n\n86\n00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,730\nGet-Command will show us all\nthe commands that are available.\n\n87\n00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,510\nSo here it is, it's going through and\nlisting all the commandlets and\n\n88\n00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,670\nfunctions that are available.\n\n89\n00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,910\nAnd we'll get a chance to\nsee more of these later.\n\n90\n00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,310\nThere's a ton, I actually don't\nknow how many are on here.\n\n91\n00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,380\nYou can even extend it and add your own,\n\n92\n00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,780\nso who knows how many\nyour system will have.\n\n93\n00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,410\nBut there are well over a thousand\n\n94\n00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,240\ndifferent command modes that\nare available for you to be able to run.\n\n95\n00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960\nEach one performing some\ndifferent functionality.\n\n96\n00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,080\nBut they all follow that verb,\nnoun format, right.\n\n97\n00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,180\nSo, I've got unlock, unprotect,\nupdate, wait, write,\n\n98\n00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,350\nthose are all verbs, followed by nouns.\n\n99\n00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,080\nProcess, job, event,\nwhat is it that I'm working with?\n\n100\n00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,300\nIt's a simple syntax.\n\n101\n00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,180\nIt's designed to be fairly plain\nenglish so that if you look at one and\n\n102\n00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,088\nyou see something like this, Wait-Event.\n\n103\n00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:02,410\nYou should be able to guess what that is.\n\n104\n00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,660\nWe're waiting for\nsome kind of event to happen, right?\n\n105\n00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,040\nSo I have a pretty good idea\nof what that command does.\n\n106\n00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,365\nBut if I want to find out more,\nI can use Get-Help to find out more.\n\n107\n00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:20,375\nGet-Help followed by the command I want\nto learn about and I'll type Wait-Event.\n\n108\n00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,440\nAnd now it's going to tell\nme about that command.\n\n109\n00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,650\nSo it's giving me a little bit information\nhere and telling me what it's doing,\n\n110\n00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,870\nin my case it's telling me it cannot\nfind the help file for this commandlet.\n\n111\n00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,900\nThat's useful.\n\n112\n00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,670\nIt's just giving me really generic syntax.\n\n113\n00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,730\nThat's not great.\n\n114\n00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,440\nI'll show you how to fix\nthat in another segment.\n\n115\n00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,730\nWhat happens is when you install\nthe PowerShell it installs help files for\n\n116\n00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,020\nsome very common commands, and\n\n117\n00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,140\nthe less common commands it doesn't\ninstall the help files for.\n\n118\n00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,900\nAnd so we actually have to tell it to\ngo online and get those help files.\n\n119\n00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,329\nLet me pick something that's a little\nmore commonly used, like Get-Childobject.\n\n120\n00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:04,390\nActually, well searching help for\nit, and not finding it.\n\n121\n00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,190\nHow about Childitem,\nif I can type here that'll help me out.\n\n122\n00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,220\nThere we go, so here's Get-Childitem, and\n\n123\n00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,420\nactually that one's help\nfiles not pulling up either.\n\n124\n00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,570\nSo yeah, we'll definitely have\nto do an update on this one.\n\n125\n00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,710\nBut you can use that to pull extended\ninformation about most commands and\n\n126\n00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,970\nyou see a description of what they are and\nhow they work.\n\n127\n00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,820\nWhen you're running that.\n\n128\n00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,295\nWhat you're actually running two things.\n\n129\n00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:28,710\nGet-Help is the commandlet\nfollowed by modifiers.\n\n130\n00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,490\nAnd the modifiers can\nspecify all sorts of things.\n\n131\n00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,312\nWhat action you want to perform.\n\n132\n00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:35,200\nWhat it is that you're\ntrying to do on the system.\n\n133\n00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,400\nSo I might want to do a Stop-Service.\n\n134\n00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,600\nSo I'm going to stop a service\nthat is running on my system and\n\n135\n00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,520\nthen I would follow that up with a name.\n\n136\n00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,390\nAnd I might say -Name dnsclient.\n\n137\n00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,900\nRight?\n\n138\n00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,120\nApparently my name is wrong though,\nit didn't seem to like that.\n\n139\n00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,170\nAnd so I might have my syntax wrong.\n\n140\n00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,970\nIt might just be Stop-Service dnsclient\nbut it is not finding that one either so\n\n141\n00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,280\nI might not have\nthe dnsclient enabled at all.\n\n142\n00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,940\nSo we run the command, and it goes and\ngives us a nice little error here.\n\n143\n00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,050\nThe error is kind of nice because\nit tells you where your problem is.\n\n144\n00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,190\nSo when I look at this here it's tell me,\n\n145\n00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,810\nit cannot find any service\nwith the name dnsclient.\n\n146\n00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,490\nSo apparently I'm using the wrong name for\nit,\n\n147\n00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,010\nor it just has a different\nname than what I'm used to.\n\n148\n00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,618\nSo we would need to go and update to\nfind out what that proper name was.\n\n149\n00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:28,100\nAnd specify that,\nI could do a Get-Service, and\n\n150\n00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,180\nthen that's going to run and\nshow me all the services.\n\n151\n00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,530\nAnd I can go and\nfind the dnsclient in there and\n\n152\n00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,460\nsee what it's actually called\nsince apparently I don't know.\n\n153\n00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,730\nAnd the dnsclient is\nactually called Dnscache.\n\n154\n00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,430\nSo if I use the right name this\nwill work a little better for me.\n\n155\n00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,140\nSo I wanna do Stop-Service dnscache.\n\n156\n00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,152\nNow, notice up here,\nwhen I've found it in my list, Dnscache.\n\n157\n00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:59,134\nYou see how the D is capitalized right\nthere and the rest of it is lowercase?\n\n158\n00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:00,719\nI can write it that way.\n\n159\n00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:03,420\nSo if we go back here and\nI'll just come in and\n\n160\n00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,216\npunch it in like that and\nit's going to reach out and stop it and\n\n161\n00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:11,020\n[LAUGH] now i've bumped into\nanother issue that I know of.\n\n162\n00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,160\nIn this case I didn't run the PowerShell\nas an administrator and so\n\n163\n00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,450\nI'm not allowed to stop the service.\n\n164\n00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,680\nSo here it's just saying it cannot\nopen the Dnscache in this system and\n\n165\n00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,920\nit's because I didn't run\nit as an administrator.\n\n166\n00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,330\nWhen you just click the PowerShell icon,\nyou're running it as a regular user.\n\n167\n00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,930\nYou have user account control or\n\n168\n00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,420\nUAC that's in there that's preventing\nyou from doing certain things.\n\n169\n00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,780\nBut if you right click on that button,\nyou'll see run as administrator.\n\n170\n00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,920\nAnd there we can fire\nthe command prompt up.\n\n171\n00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,380\nAs an administrator, and\nnow we'll be able to do more.\n\n172\n00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,600\nWe'll be able to say Stop-Service,\noops, if we can spell it.\n\n173\n00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,230\nThere we go.\n\n174\n00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,790\nAnd then we can specify Dnscache.\n\n175\n00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,090\nAnd it's gonna jump in there and stop it.\n\n176\n00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,640\nOkay.\n\n177\n00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,130\nAnd if I do Get-Service, and I go in, and\n\n178\n00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,930\nI find my Dnscache again,\nI'll just go find it here.\n\n179\n00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,810\nI can see that it is now stopped, right?\n\n180\n00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,900\nSo, then we can start it back up again.\n\n181\n00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,750\nIf Stop-Service stopped it,\n\n182\n00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,410\nit's pretty good guess that\nStart-Service is gonna start it again.\n\n183\n00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,300\nMost of your commands are gonna be\nlike that, fairly intuitive, right?\n\n184\n00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,640\nWe can figure out what we need to do\nFabian just asked in the chatroom there.\n\n185\n00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,710\nI was leading in to that point and\ngot sidetracked.\n\n186\n00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,000\nI mentioned how there was capitalization.\n\n187\n00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,530\nSee how I've got that capital D there and\nI've capitalized my words.\n\n188\n00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,920\nI'm just doing that\nbecause it looks nicer.\n\n189\n00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,900\nIt's the way they write it\nin the help files and stuff.\n\n190\n00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,600\nBut for the most part,\nPowerShell is not case sensitive.\n\n191\n00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,700\nThere are some areas where there's\nvalues that are case sensitive, but\n\n192\n00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,370\nit's not PowerShell's fault.\n\n193\n00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,750\nIt's whatever system it's\ncalling that determines that.\n\n194\n00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,250\nAs far as PowerShell is concerned though,\nit's not.\n\n195\n00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,590\nSo if I were to run Stop-Service Dnscache\nand I were to do it all lowercase.\n\n196\n00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,420\nSo I'll just go and change all my casing\nthere to all lowercase and run it.\n\n197\n00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,210\nIt runs just the same.\n\n198\n00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,790\nSo, as far as PowerShell is concerned,\nit's not case sensitive.\n\n199\n00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,660\nBut just be aware that if you put\nin add-ons, if you're managing\n\n200\n00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,120\nMicrosoft Exchange, or Active Directory or\nsomething, you may bump into an area where\n\n201\n00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,360\nthey require a value to be case sensitive,\nand that's where it gets a little flaky.\n\n202\n00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,030\nIt becomes inconsistent.\n\n203\n00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,560\nAnd for me, I kind of just make it\na habit of following the casing,\n\n204\n00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,580\njust to be on the safe side,\nbut probably 95% of the time,\n\n205\n00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,790\nyou don't have to worry about the case.\n\n206\n00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,910\nAll right, now, not everything in\nthe PowerShell has to be a commandlet.\n\n207\n00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,990\nThe commandlets are nice.\n\n208\n00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,000\nWe've got a ton of them, right?\n\n209\n00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,050\nOver a thousand of them that\nare available to do all sorts of stuff.\n\n210\n00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,530\nBut there's other things we can do,\ntoo, like expressions.\n\n211\n00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,410\nIf you ever find yourself\nwondering what one plus one is,\n\n212\n00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,360\nyou can type it into Power Shell.\n\n213\n00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,710\nIf I type 1+1 and press Enter,\nit tells me that it's 2.\n\n214\n00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,400\nOne plus one is two.\n\n215\n00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,670\nWe learned something\nnew on the show today.\n\n216\n00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,530\nSo, there it is.\n\n217\n00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,800\nSimple expression.\n\n218\n00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,100\nAnd you can do spaces on these.\n\n219\n00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,700\nSome people like to do that for\nreadability, and it'll figure it out.\n\n220\n00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,278\nYou can do advanced mathematics.\n\n221\n00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,270\n289 / 12, and it'll calculate that out.\n\n222\n00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,080\nYou can even do order of operations.\n\n223\n00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,965\nIf I do like (7 + 4) /\n\n224\n00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:18,660\n(8 * 9), right?\n\n225\n00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,120\nWriting that out,\nit'll work that out, too.\n\n226\n00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,040\nAnd you can even do units.\n\n227\n00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040\nSo, for example, 1GB.\n\n228\n00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,490\n1GB to a lot of us,\nwe think of that as 1 million bytes.\n\n229\n00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,350\nBut it really isn't, is it?\n\n230\n00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:41,320\n1GB is actually 1 million, let me work\nout my numbers here and get this right.\n\n231\n00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,870\nIt is, oh, 1 billion.\n\n232\n00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,716\nShoot.\nI was off by an entire order of magnitude.\n\n233\n00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:51,893\nSo, we think of it as one billion bytes,\nbut it's actually 1,073,741,824 Bytes,\n\n234\n00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:57,510\nand that's because of the way sector\nsizes are measured on hard drives.\n\n235\n00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,810\nAnd so if we start feeding it values like\n1GB, it understands that to be accurate.\n\n236\n00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:10,160\nAnd if you mix things,\nif you say like 1GB + 500MB, right?\n\n237\n00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,030\nIt'll actually work that out and\ngive you the value corrected for\n\n238\n00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,068\nthe actual byte size.\n\n239\n00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,150\nSo really neat stuff that you can do from\nthe command prompt inside a PowerShell.\n\n240\n00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,650\nThis is where we're starting to\nget closer to the Linux-like\n\n241\n00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,790\nenvironment where you can do logic.\n\n242\n00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,120\nAdvanced logic right here\nfrom the command prompt.\n\n243\n00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,770\nThis stuff didn't work in the regular\ncommand prompt in Windows.\n\n244\n00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,810\nBut in the PowerShell, it does.\n\n245\n00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,210\nAll right.\n\n246\n00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,530\nSome of the other things\nthat we might see.\n\n247\n00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,220\nWhen we do commands,\nthings like Get-Help, or\n\n248\n00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,170\nthose operators that I just did or the\nexpressions that I just did right there,\n\n249\n00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,870\nwhen we do those,\nwe can type them in like I did here.\n\n250\n00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,290\nBut if you've got a series of\nten commands that you wanna run.\n\n251\n00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,080\nYou might not want to have\nto type in all ten of them.\n\n252\n00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,650\nSo you might choose to\ncreate a script file.\n\n253\n00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,940\nIn power shell you can create script files\nreally easy, they're just text files and\n\n254\n00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,560\nthe extension is .ps1.\n\n255\n00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,120\nAnd it was from the PowerShell 1.0\ndays but they didn't change it.\n\n256\n00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,770\nMicrosoft made a few mistakes with\nPowerShell 1.0 with putting the version\n\n257\n00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,250\nnumber in places where\nthey shouldn't have.\n\n258\n00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,750\nAnd so PowerShell's one of those.\n\n259\n00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,410\nSo we've got any file that ends\nin .ps1 is a PowerShell script.\n\n260\n00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,780\nAnd in a PowerShell script all you do is\nput all the commands that you want to run\n\n261\n00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,320\nand then you can call that script.\n\n262\n00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,120\nNow by default in PowerShell\n4.0 scripting is disabled.\n\n263\n00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,430\nIf I were to create a script right now,\nit actually won't work.\n\n264\n00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,780\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n265\n00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,870\nSo if I get into,\nI'll just go to my desktop here.\n\n266\n00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:42,360\nAnd I'll do notepad test.ps1, all right?\n\n267\n00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,868\nAnd so\nI'm going to create a file here, and\n\n268\n00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:51,700\nI'm just going to put in a Get-Help and\n1GB + 500MB, right.\n\n269\n00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,530\nTwo commands that we saw work\njust fine a moment ago, right, so\n\n270\n00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,394\nI'm just gonna put those right here\nin my script and I'll save that.\n\n271\n00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:05,052\nNow when I save it I can take a look and\n\n272\n00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,510\nthere's my test.ps1,\nthat's a PowerShell script.\n\n273\n00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,780\nWhenever you run a script in PowerShell,\n\n274\n00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,100\nyou have to provide the path to\nthe script in order to execute it.\n\n275\n00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,440\nYou can type out the full path\nif you want to get there.\n\n276\n00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,011\nOr you can type .\\ which means\nthe current directory that I'm in, it's\n\n277\n00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:27,965\nkind of a shortcut we can use, and that\nshortcut existed in the old DOS days too.\n\n278\n00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:31,190\nSo you might already be\nfamiliar with that one.\n\n279\n00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,150\nBut .\\test.ps1,\nthat's the script I'm gonna call.\n\n280\n00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,240\nIf I try to call it without that,\nit may or may not find it.\n\n281\n00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,870\nIf you don't include a path it looks for\nthe path variable and the path variable\n\n282\n00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,650\nusually doesn't include your desktop, it\nincludes things like C:\\windows\\system32\n\n283\n00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,280\nfolders like that, those are included but\nwe don't put our scripts there.\n\n284\n00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,070\nSo that's why it's important to put\nthat path in there And when I run it.\n\n285\n00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,800\nWell, I've enabled the scripting\non mine so it is going to run.\n\n286\n00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,110\nBut on yours, if you try and\nrun it out of the box, it won't.\n\n287\n00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,670\nAnd look for, we've got a segment\ncoming up here in a minute.\n\n288\n00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,660\nAbout what are called\nscript execution policies.\n\n289\n00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,480\nAnd if you find that your\nscripts aren't running,\n\n290\n00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,730\nI'll show you how to correct that.\n\n291\n00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,910\nHow you go through and\nactually enable that.\n\n292\n00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,230\nBut when I ran it.\n\n293\n00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,160\nYou'll see in here, I just ran that\ntest.ps1, and here's my help, right?\n\n294\n00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,720\nSo it ran Get-Help, and\nthen after that at the very end,\n\n295\n00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,320\nhere's the math result of, what was it?\n\n296\n00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,970\n1GB + 500MB, right?\n\n297\n00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,980\nSo it output that right there at the end.\n\n298\n00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,900\nScripting is super easy in PowerShell.\n\n299\n00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,970\nYou just write the various commands you\nwant to run in the order you want to run\n\n300\n00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,420\nand you call it.\n\n301\n00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,880\nThat's a pretty basic script.\n\n302\n00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,560\nWe'll see in later shows that you can\nactually get pretty advanced with this and\n\n303\n00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,630\nyou can put a lot of logic in there.\n\n304\n00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,960\nYou can say check if this file exists,\n\n305\n00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,460\nand if it does exist do\nthese series of actions.\n\n306\n00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,874\nAnd if it doesn't exist do this\nother series of actions so\n\n307\n00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:53,014\nyou can create advanced logic and\nnow your script becomes very powerful.\n\n308\n00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:57,444\nAnd you can even have where your script\ntakes inputs so you can feed values to it.\n\n309\n00:15:57,444 --> 00:16:01,382\nMaybe your script runs a series of\ncommands But you wanna be able to specify\n\n310\n00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:04,980\nwhat computer it runs on so\nyou can feed that in via script.\n\n311\n00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,790\nSo scripting like this is a very\ncommon way to run commands.\n\n312\n00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,340\nSo we've seen three\ndifferent commands before.\n\n313\n00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,450\nWe've seen command lets, we've seen\nexpressions, right, mathematical formulas.\n\n314\n00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,920\nAnd now we've seen scripts.\n\n315\n00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,180\nBut that's not the end of it.\n\n316\n00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,660\nThere's even some other ones\nthat are [LAUGH] out there.\n\n317\n00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,600\nOne of the other things we're gonna see\na little bit later is something called\n\n318\n00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,750\na function.\n\n319\n00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,340\nAnd an alias.\n\n320\n00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,890\nAnd so we've got segments on those too.\n\n321\n00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,130\nBut an alias is just a nickname for\nanother command.\n\n322\n00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,232\nAll right.\nYou'll notice I ran dir a minute ago,\n\n323\n00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:39,690\nwhich is directory, okay.\n\n324\n00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,460\nThat's not a verb/noun format is it?\n\n325\n00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,627\nDir is an old school command,\nit's an old DOS command, line command, and\n\n326\n00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:49,626\nit pulls up the directory listing.\n\n327\n00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:54,918\nWell dir, that's actually an alias for\nanother command.\n\n328\n00:16:54,918 --> 00:17:02,570\nIf I do get-alias dir, it'll show me that\nit's actually an alias for get-childitem.\n\n329\n00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,030\nSee there's my verb/noun format.\n\n330\n00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,410\nIf I do get-childitem, and run that,\nit's the same exact output.\n\n331\n00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,440\nSo sometimes we're not typing\na commandlet, we're typing an alias.\n\n332\n00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,390\nAnd we'll see how to create our own\naliases later, which can be kind of handy.\n\n333\n00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,130\nSometimes you'll have commands\nlike these that aren't an alias,\n\n334\n00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,340\nbut they are function.\n\n335\n00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,620\nWell functions, what they allow you\nto do is not only do a nickname for\n\n336\n00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,780\na command, but\nalso pass additional parameters to it.\n\n337\n00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,750\nSo you can have different configurations\nfor how a command runs, and\n\n338\n00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,020\nthat's pretty powerful stuff too.\n\n339\n00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,710\nI'll show some examples in another second.\n\n340\n00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,410\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe different ways that we can do it,\n\n341\n00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,430\nwe'll also see that our commands\nsometimes can be really long.\n\n342\n00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,650\nAnd as you're typing a command,\nthe longer the command is,\n\n343\n00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,970\nthe more likely that it is going\nto wrap around the screen, right.\n\n344\n00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,710\nSo if I'm typing some really long command,\nI'll hit the edge of the screen and\n\n345\n00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,420\nit'll start to wrap\naround to the next line.\n\n346\n00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,390\nThat can make readability\na little bit challenging.\n\n347\n00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,600\nWe won't see that in our early segments\nin this show, but some of the later ones\n\n348\n00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,270\nthat we do like in active directory,\nthe commands can get really long.\n\n349\n00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,090\nThe sequel ones, boy,\nthose are the really long ones.\n\n350\n00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:20,350\nSo if you ever want to manually wrap\na command around the edge of a line,\n\n351\n00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,730\nyou can do that by using the back tick.\n\n352\n00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,110\nThe back tick, it's usually on the tilt\nkey of your keyboard at the top left.\n\n353\n00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,000\nAnd basically it says,\nthis command isn't done yet.\n\n354\n00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,670\nAll right.\n\n355\n00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:37,960\nSo if I do something like set-location,\nall right.\n\n356\n00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,120\nThat's a way that I can\nchange what directory I'm in.\n\n357\n00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,180\nSo I can change like my C drive,\nall right.\n\n358\n00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,520\nWell I could run set-location and\nthen do a back tick like that.\n\n359\n00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,060\nAnd when I press Enter,\nsee what happened to my command?\n\n360\n00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,460\nIt didn't run it.\n\n361\n00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,650\nIt just moved me to the next line.\n\n362\n00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,410\nAnd now I can type in,\nwhere it is that I want to go to, and\n\n363\n00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,832\nI can start to type that in.\n\n364\n00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:04,470\nYou know I picked a bad example there\nbecause that looks it's gonna be\n\n365\n00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,170\na long one.\n\n366\n00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:11,450\nBut I could type in c:/Windows, and\nnow it knows, hey my command is not over.\n\n367\n00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,290\nI can keep doing additional lines.\n\n368\n00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,630\nTyping more and more and\nmore until it executes.\n\n369\n00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,010\nThat was just the back tick that did that,\n\n370\n00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,270\nthat was the one that gets\nthat in place and runs it.\n\n371\n00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,130\nAll right, now we're not\ngonna need that anytime soon.\n\n372\n00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,420\nI just wanted you to be aware that if\nyou ever see an example on the internet,\n\n373\n00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,480\non the internet a lot of times they'll\nformat them to fit on a web page nicely.\n\n374\n00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,290\nAnd they'll put those back ticks in there.\n\n375\n00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,140\nAnd what you can do is you can\njust delete that back tick and\n\n376\n00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,430\nwrite it as one command.\n\n377\n00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,870\nSo if I write it like this,\nit's all on one line and we move.\n\n378\n00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,489\nWhen you run it,\n\n379\n00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:46,293\nthat's what Windows is doing anyway,\nit's turning it into one big line.\n\n380\n00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:47,668\nAnd executing it that way.\n\n381\n00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,516\nAll right,\n\n382\n00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:54,570\none of the biggest challenges inside\nof the PowerShell is finding a command.\n\n383\n00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,860\nThere's so many of them.\n\n384\n00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,050\nHow do you know what\ncommands are available?\n\n385\n00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,110\nThat's one of the real challenges\na lot of us have to deal with.\n\n386\n00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,300\nUnfortunately, we can do searches\npretty easily to find those.\n\n387\n00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,537\nSo I showed you Get-Command earlier.\n\n388\n00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:11,050\nAnd when you run Get-Command.\n\n389\n00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,320\nBoy, that's a lot of stuff.\n\n390\n00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,880\nAll right, but if I'm looking for\n\n391\n00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,180\nsomething in particular,\nlike I want to work with a,\n\n392\n00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,430\nlet's say events right, because I've\ngot this way ads event right here.\n\n393\n00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,790\nSo I wanna find any action\nthat deals with events.\n\n394\n00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:35,420\nSo what I could do is I can run get\ncash command followed by *event* right.\n\n395\n00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,060\nWhat I'm doing is I'm saying, a wild card.\n\n396\n00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,710\nThe star, the asterisk there,\nthat represents any character or\n\n397\n00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,970\nnumber of characters.\n\n398\n00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,740\nSo any command that has the word event.\n\n399\n00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,480\nIn it somewhere, right.\n\n400\n00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,880\nThat's what I'm looking for, okay.\n\n401\n00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,230\nNow when I run that,\nI may get more than I want, right.\n\n402\n00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,530\nI may get some that have EventLog in them.\n\n403\n00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,670\nSome are just Event.\n\n404\n00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,630\nSo there's variations that\nare available in here.\n\n405\n00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,890\nMaybe I'm specifically\nconcerned about the EventLog.\n\n406\n00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,390\nI might wanna change this\nto change get-command.\n\n407\n00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,020\n*-EventLog, like that.\n\n408\n00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,410\nNow I'm saying, just show me\nthe commands that end with Event Log.\n\n409\n00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,400\nI don't know what the verb is, but\nthe noun is going to be Event Log.\n\n410\n00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,430\nAnd now I can see clear the Event Log,\nget the Event Log, limit it, new,\n\n411\n00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,230\nremove, show, write.\n\n412\n00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,490\nSo here's the various ones\nthat are available to me.\n\n413\n00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,440\nNow I start to get an idea\nof what we can do.\n\n414\n00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,380\nAll right, and\nthese aren't case sensitive.\n\n415\n00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,040\nIf I change this, see how I get the same\nresult there even with lower case, so\n\n416\n00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,470\nyou don't have to be precise.\n\n417\n00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,000\nI normally start out with\nsomething general, like,\n\n418\n00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,830\nhey I wanna work with user accounts.\n\n419\n00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:49,470\nSo I do get-command *user*, right, show me\neverything that has the word user in it.\n\n420\n00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,470\nAll right.\nSo I get this list.\n\n421\n00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,040\nAnd then I can start to narrow it down\na little bit based on what I wanted.\n\n422\n00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,100\nLike here active directory user,\nthat's what I wanted.\n\n423\n00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,920\nAnd so now I can say get-command *-ADUser,\nand now I'm just seeing those.\n\n424\n00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,650\nGet, remove, set and new, let's run\nover those four verbs right there,\n\n425\n00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,520\nbecause those are the four\nmost common verbs.\n\n426\n00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,120\nGet, that just means retrieve information.\n\n427\n00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,320\nYou're not actually changing anything,\nyou're just getting some information.\n\n428\n00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,410\nNew, that means we're creating a new user.\n\n429\n00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,220\nWe're adding something new to the system,\n\n430\n00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,000\nwe are making a change by\nintroducing something new.\n\n431\n00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,450\nSometimes you'll see the word add instead.\n\n432\n00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,199\nSo you might see new or add,\nbut new is the most common.\n\n433\n00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,400\nRemove.\n\n434\n00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,320\nLike the name implies,\n\n435\n00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,760\nthat's gonna get rid of it,\ndelete something out of the system.\n\n436\n00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,490\nAnd then set.\n\n437\n00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,040\nThat's the one that modifies a record.\n\n438\n00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,300\nWhen you say set-aduser,\nyou're setting some property,\n\n439\n00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,450\nyou're changing some value for\nthat user, and modifying what they do.\n\n440\n00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,530\nThose are the four most common verbs,\n\n441\n00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,850\nright there, that you'll encounter\nworking with power shell.\n\n442\n00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,630\nAnd so when we start to look at these\ncommands, you'll see tons of them.\n\n443\n00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:04,080\nIf I want to do like get-command and\nwe'll do new-*.\n\n444\n00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,080\nI want to see all the stuff\nthat I can create new ones of.\n\n445\n00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,680\nYou'll see there's a lot, I can create\nnew services, new Windows events.\n\n446\n00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,930\nI can create new objects, new PS drives,\nnow all sorts of stuff in here.\n\n447\n00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,080\nAD user, these are all different\nthings that we can create.\n\n448\n00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,650\nAnd there's even some special\nfunctions that do things,\n\n449\n00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,070\nlike new volumes for creating disks.\n\n450\n00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,340\nReally powerful stuff in here,\nif you just know to find the command.\n\n451\n00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,360\nNow Microsoft has great documentation\non the TechNet website.\n\n452\n00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,380\nYou can go there and find lists of all\nthe commands that are available there.\n\n453\n00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,860\nVery searchable, very easy to work with.\n\n454\n00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,640\nBut if you're under the gun, you're on\na computer and you don't have internet\n\n455\n00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,580\naccess, it's nice to know that you\ncan at least search through and\n\n456\n00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,430\nfind your commands here.\n\n457\n00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,550\nAll right, well that's a pretty\ngood spot to wrap this segment up.\n\n458\n00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,930\nLet's take a look at what we've covered,\nright.\n\n459\n00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,685\nSo we started with basic commandlets.\n\n460\n00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:53,526\nAnd how they function, we had a change to\nsee some aliases that are already built in\n\n461\n00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:55,365\nplace, alternate commands.\n\n462\n00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:57,290\nWe even got a chance to\nlook at expressions,\n\n463\n00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,210\nmathematical operations we can\nperform from the command prompt.\n\n464\n00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:04,270\nAnd then we just wrapped up talking about\na few other things, like using get help\n\n465\n00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,846\nand get command to be able to find\nthe commands that are available, and\n\n466\n00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,168\nlocate what it is we need\nto use in the system.\n\n467\n00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:11,760\nAll right,\nhopefully you guys enjoyed that segment.\n\n468\n00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,960\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n469\n00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,370\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,889\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,450\nIn this segment we're gonna take a look\nat the command history in Powershell.\n\n3\n00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,225\nOne of the faster ways to enter commands\nthat we used previously is to, well,\n\n4\n00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,625\nuse our command history.\n\n5\n00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,960\nPowershell is actually keeping track\nof all of the commands that you've run\n\n6\n00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,710\nsince you logged in and\nstarted running it.\n\n7\n00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,340\nActually, even prior to log in.\n\n8\n00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,610\nIt actually keeps them\nsession by session so\n\n9\n00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,490\nit can go go back to previous times\nthat you've logged into your system.\n\n10\n00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,580\nI guess I shouldn't say every command,\n\n11\n00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,490\nit's really just keeping\ntrack of the last 64.\n\n12\n00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,230\nSo the last 64 commands that you've typed\nare being held in Powershell's cache.\n\n13\n00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,750\nAnd that means you can recall\nthem whenever you want.\n\n14\n00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,540\nIt's kind of a neat feature to have.\n\n15\n00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,850\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n16\n00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,600\nI've got a Powershell fired up right here,\nand I've cleared my screen, so\n\n17\n00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,480\nthere's not really anything on it.\n\n18\n00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,400\nBut, I've previously used this,\nright, I used it another segment.\n\n19\n00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,880\nSo, if I want to view my command history,\nthere's a few ways we can do it.\n\n20\n00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,790\nThe easiest way to bring a command\nup that you've run previously,\n\n21\n00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,370\nif it was run recently, is to use your\nup and down arrows on your keyboard.\n\n22\n00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,450\nIf I press the up arrow on my keyboard,\nit goes up,\n\n23\n00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,320\nand there you can see\nwhere I cleared my screen.\n\n24\n00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:14,410\nOr where I'd use the Linux or\nUnix LS command.\n\n25\n00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,450\nHere's the get dash command new.\n\n26\n00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,830\nThese are the commands I ran\nin a previous segment, right?\n\n27\n00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,620\nAnd I can press my up arrow\nto go back in time and\n\n28\n00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,020\nI can press my down arrow\nto go forward in time.\n\n29\n00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,980\nI can scroll through and\nfind the command that I want.\n\n30\n00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,050\nAnd then I can go in and I can modify it.\n\n31\n00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,820\nSo instead of get-command*-aduser,\n\n32\n00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,650\nmaybe I want to pull up one\nthat is *-eventlog, right?\n\n33\n00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,290\nSo I can modify the command as\nappropriate, and there we go.\n\n34\n00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,580\nSo pretty easy way to pull that back up.\n\n35\n00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,920\nNow, if the command you're looking for\n\n36\n00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,620\nwas just in the last few commands,\nthat works really well.\n\n37\n00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,500\nBut if you ran it 20 or 30 commands ago,\n\n38\n00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,110\nyou don't want to have to\nscroll all the way back.\n\n39\n00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,810\nSo there's a few other\nways that we can do that.\n\n40\n00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,770\nOne way, is that we can actually\nview our whole history.\n\n41\n00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,220\nWe can type get-history.\n\n42\n00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,030\nAnd that will pull up\nthe Powershell history.\n\n43\n00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,030\nAnd here I can go back and\nsee the previous commands.\n\n44\n00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,550\nAnd so, I can see it starts up here at\none with stop-service DNS Cache, that was\n\n45\n00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:19,423\nsomething I ran back early on, and then\nall the commands that I ran after that.\n\n46\n00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:22,705\nMoving forward including changing\ndirectories, running commands,\n\n47\n00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:24,075\nthere was a bad command there.\n\n48\n00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,525\nIt doesn't tell you if the command\nwas successful, or not right?\n\n49\n00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,475\nThis was actually a bad command here.\n\n50\n00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:33,985\nBut, it's got the commands, and you could\neasy copy and paste these if you want.\n\n51\n00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:36,260\nRight, you could just highlight\nthem with your mouse.\n\n52\n00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,400\nAnd press enter and that copies it.\n\n53\n00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,770\nAnd you can right click with the mouse and\nthat paste it again.\n\n54\n00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,035\nSo that's one way that we\ncan quickly do things there.\n\n55\n00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:47,278\nGet-history is nice cause it just\nkeeps track of all this stuff.\n\n56\n00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:53,140\nYou get a chance to see everything you've\nrun and it's constantly being updated.\n\n57\n00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,380\nSo as I take a look at my history.\n\n58\n00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,370\nI can see my history just grew from\nthe 33 it was a minute ago to 36 now.\n\n59\n00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,790\nAnd there's those commands.\n\n60\n00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,522\nThat I just typed that made it grow.\n\n61\n00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:03,590\nAll right.\n\n62\n00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,690\nSo, that's one way to do it.\n\n63\n00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,590\nOne thing I guess I should mention\nis I'm in Windows Server 2012 and\n\n64\n00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,770\nthe quick edit mode is enabled by default.\n\n65\n00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,280\nSo when I wanted to copy\nsomething I just highlighted\n\n66\n00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,830\nit by using the left mouse button.\n\n67\n00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,720\nI just clicked and\nhighlighted and pressed enter.\n\n68\n00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,660\nBut if you're in Windows Server 2008 or\n2003, in one\n\n69\n00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,550\nof the earlier versions of Powershell,\nthat's not turned on by default.\n\n70\n00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,150\nSo, you might need to turn quick edit on.\n\n71\n00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,250\nOr, if you don't want to turn quick edit\non, you can go up here to your menu, and\n\n72\n00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,040\nyou can choose edit and mark, and\n\n73\n00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,690\nthat's what will turn on\nthe ability to highlight.\n\n74\n00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,020\nAnd then you can press enter.\n\n75\n00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,008\nSo that may be a difference that\nyou see on your own system.\n\n76\n00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:45,620\nAll right, [COUGH] so\nhere we can see the history.\n\n77\n00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,120\nThat's great, it's the same thing I see\nwith my up and down arrows as we go\n\n78\n00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,540\nthrough and start to look at the commands\nthere, so not much difference.\n\n79\n00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,630\nJust we get to see them all.\n\n80\n00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,570\nAll right.\n\n81\n00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,720\nAnother thing that we can do, is there's\na couple of neat little keyboard shortcuts\n\n82\n00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,660\nthat deal with your function keys.\n\n83\n00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,970\nIf you hit F7 on your keyboard, so\nthat's F as in Frank and seven, right?\n\n84\n00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,070\nYour function key number seven, when\nyou hit that, you get a little pop up.\n\n85\n00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,300\nThen the pop up will\nshow the commands too.\n\n86\n00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,093\nAll right.\nAnd you'll see where I can go and\n\n87\n00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:17,420\nscroll back and there's each of\nthe commands that are in my history.\n\n88\n00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,500\nThe nice thing here is I can go through\nand find the command I wanna run, and\n\n89\n00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,140\nI can press enter and it runs it.\n\n90\n00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,000\nSo you can just scroll through and\nfind the command you want.\n\n91\n00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,020\nAnother thing you'll notice is that\nmost of those commands had a number\n\n92\n00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,580\nattached to them, right?\n\n93\n00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,120\nSo when I hit F7, see how there's\nthat number beside each one.\n\n94\n00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,630\nOr if I do get-history, right.\n\n95\n00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,930\nHere we can see that number beside them.\n\n96\n00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,910\nIf you know the number of\nthe command that you want to run,\n\n97\n00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,780\nyou can just hit F9 on the keyboard,\nand you can pick the command.\n\n98\n00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,260\nSo if I want to run get history,\nor let's do a different one.\n\n99\n00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,390\nLet's do get command and\nthat log, that's command 33.\n\n100\n00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,890\nI can just type in 33, and,\nit picks the wrong one.\n\n101\n00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,010\nSo you know, my history has changed,\napparently, so let's try that again.\n\n102\n00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,030\nWe get history.\n\n103\n00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:12,480\nAnd I want to run, wait,\nI confused myself.\n\n104\n00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,770\nSo I'll do get child item, which is 36.\n\n105\n00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:22,030\nSo if I want to do 36, i just F9 and\ntype in 36, and, I typed the wrong one.\n\n106\n00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,650\nThat's pretty spectacular.\n\n107\n00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,230\nSo, the problem here is when I run get\nhistory, that's a command that I ran.\n\n108\n00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,310\nAnd so it's modifying the numbers.\n\n109\n00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,750\nSo I actually need to increase it by one\nor actually, here was can change this up.\n\n110\n00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,670\nI'll just use F7 so\nI'm not actually changing mine.\n\n111\n00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,250\nAnd I'll look here.\n\n112\n00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,360\nSo I haven't actually run a command yet.\n\n113\n00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,520\nAnd now if I want to run\nget child item is 38.\n\n114\n00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,383\nSo, but it's gonna make me, there we go.\n\n115\n00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:49,710\nSooner or later I will get this to run.\n\n116\n00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,307\nThere we go.\n\n117\n00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:51,800\nGet child item and we can run it, right.\n\n118\n00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,770\nThe numbers are pretty challenging\nbecause they are constantly changing, so\n\n119\n00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,590\nthat's kind of a rough one for\nus but it's there.\n\n120\n00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,920\nYou're able to see that history,\nand it's able to function.\n\n121\n00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,110\nThe default is 64 commands.\n\n122\n00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,690\nIf you want it to record more,\nwell that's something you need to modify.\n\n123\n00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,810\nWe'll do a segment on\ncustomizing the Powershell, but\n\n124\n00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,410\nI want to stick with the defaults for\nright now.\n\n125\n00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,350\nSo the default is 64,\n\n126\n00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,450\nwhen we get to the 65th one, it'll\noverwrite the oldest one, the first one.\n\n127\n00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,170\nThat one will go away and get replaced,\nand so that's why those numbers\n\n128\n00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,490\nare constantly changing as it shifts\nthrough adding these new commands.\n\n129\n00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,320\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe different shortcuts we've got.\n\n130\n00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,918\nI feel like I'm missing one.\n\n131\n00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,377\nOh, searching.\n\n132\n00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:35,180\nSo you might know that you've\ntyped a command before.\n\n133\n00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,110\nAnd you wanna pull it back up again, and\n\n134\n00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,690\nyou just don't wanna\ntype the whole thing in.\n\n135\n00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,040\nWell, what you can do is you can type\nthe first few characters, right.\n\n136\n00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,450\nSo I can just come in here and\nstart to type whatever that command was.\n\n137\n00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,100\nAnd then if you hit F8 on your keyboard,\nif I hit the F8 key.\n\n138\n00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,220\nIt does a search through my history and\nit looks for commands that had that.\n\n139\n00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,000\nNow that is not too\nterribly spectacular right?\n\n140\n00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,980\nWe have tab autocomplete that will run.\n\n141\n00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,190\nBy hitting the tab key, but it's actually\nlooking at the command that we ran.\n\n142\n00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,700\nSo if we look for a command that I ran.\n\n143\n00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,933\nThis may be longer,\nlike this guy right here, right.\n\n144\n00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,530\nThis is a really long one.\n\n145\n00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:20,300\nThat's where it really saves us time and\nthat one wasn't really, truly functional.\n\n146\n00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,020\nIf we take something\nlike stop service here.\n\n147\n00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,390\nThis one, where it's more\nthan just a command, right.\n\n148\n00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,070\nSo stop service, I typed stop.\n\n149\n00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,240\nI could actually probably\njust stop right there and\n\n150\n00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000\nhit F8 and\nsee how it does stop.service DNS cache.\n\n151\n00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600\nIt's the command that I typed.\n\n152\n00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,620\nSo, F7 shows you your history.\n\n153\n00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,680\nF8 lets you search your history and\n\n154\n00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,820\nF9 lets you run a command from\nyour history based on it's number.\n\n155\n00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,683\nSo, F7, F8, and F9.\n\n156\n00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:50,817\nSome neat little keyboard shortcuts\nthat are available there.\n\n157\n00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,125\nThe other thing we talked about just\nback at the beginning of the segment was\n\n158\n00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,720\nget-history, which I\nused several times there.\n\n159\n00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,320\nBetween those commands,\nthat's pretty much the command history.\n\n160\n00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,750\nYou'll see there's a few programming\nshortcuts that are available too.\n\n161\n00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,590\nWe might see those in some\nof the other segments but\n\n162\n00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,370\nthey are not as commonly used.\n\n163\n00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,120\nThings like dollar sign dollar sign and\n\n164\n00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,120\na few other little shortcuts there\nthat can reference previous commands.\n\n165\n00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,550\nBut as far as the history goes,\nthese are the primary commands right here.\n\n166\n00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,360\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed that segment.\n\n167\n00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,265\nStay tuned we've got more\nPowershell coming up.\n\n168\n00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:27,149\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14,575\nNow, when Microsoft created\nthe PowerShell, it was a new command line\n\n4\n00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:17,908\ninterface and so there's a bit of\na learning curve to get used to using it.\n\n5\n00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:18,651\nYou guys know.\n\n6\n00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,817\nYou're watching this show for\nthat very reason.\n\n7\n00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:22,843\nBut they wanted to make\nit as easy as possible.\n\n8\n00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:26,647\nAnd so they took a lot of commands that\nwe were used to back in the regular\n\n9\n00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:29,356\ncommand prompt, be it Windows or\neven Linux, and\n\n10\n00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:32,550\nthey added them as aliases\ninside of PowerShell.\n\n11\n00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,120\nThere are many aliases that\nare already created for us and\n\n12\n00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,540\nwe probably used without even\nthinking about it, right?\n\n13\n00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,960\nLet's take a look at some of those and\n\n14\n00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,362\nthen we'll get a chance to see how to\ncreate our own aliases after that.\n\n15\n00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:46,240\nAll right, so how do I know what\naliases are already in the system?\n\n16\n00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,321\nWell you can run Get-Alias and\n\n17\n00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:52,330\nthat will give you a list of\nthe ones that have been created.\n\n18\n00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,420\nNow there's default ones that\ncome with Windows PowerShell and\n\n19\n00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,377\nif you've installed any add-ons they\nmight have brought their own aliases too.\n\n20\n00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:00,705\nSo you may see more than I do, or\n\n21\n00:01:00,705 --> 00:01:04,060\nyou may see less than I do based\non the add-ons that you've got.\n\n22\n00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,270\nBut you'll see a ton of commands in here,\nmany of which come from the Windows world,\n\n23\n00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,530\nsome of which come from the Linux world or\nUNIX world.\n\n24\n00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,530\nSo there's some commands we run\non a regular basis like dir,\n\n25\n00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,150\nthe old directory command.\n\n26\n00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,940\nThat's from the DOS days.\n\n27\n00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,715\nWell you can still run it, but\nit just maps to Get-ChildItem, right?\n\n28\n00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:27,416\nOr copy, the old copy command,\nwell, that goes to Copy-Item.\n\n29\n00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:32,406\nIt's pairing up a name with the verb\nnoun commandlet that we're used to in\n\n30\n00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:33,380\nPowerShell.\n\n31\n00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:33,961\nAll right.\n\n32\n00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,883\nSo just to make life easy.\n\n33\n00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:38,785\nThe other reason they do it is for\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n34\n00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:42,910\nYou might have batch files that have\nbeen written to run at a regular command\n\n35\n00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,441\nprompt.\n\n36\n00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:46,575\nAnd Microsoft wanted to make sure\nthat those batch files would run even\n\n37\n00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:47,487\nunder PowerShell.\n\n38\n00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:51,203\nBy putting these aliases in there,\nthat fixes it right?\n\n39\n00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:54,765\nBut you may encounter some aliases that\nare missing that you would expect to have,\n\n40\n00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:57,878\nand I know that there's one in particular\nthat I bump into all the time.\n\n41\n00:01:57,878 --> 00:01:59,411\nI'll show you here in a moment.\n\n42\n00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,960\nAnd it gets frustrating.\n\n43\n00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,180\nSo Microsoft makes it where you\ncan create your own aliases and\n\n44\n00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,220\nthat's really nice cuz you\ncan start to make up for\n\n45\n00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,480\nsome of these commands that\nyou don't have anymore.\n\n46\n00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,964\nOr you can just make things easier on\nyourself by having a proper alias in\n\n47\n00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:14,495\nplace.\n\n48\n00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:16,414\nSo we'll get a chance to\nsee that as we go through.\n\n49\n00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:19,220\nBut these are the default\nones that are in place.\n\n50\n00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,070\nIf you're using a command and you just\nwanna know about the alias it's doing, so\n\n51\n00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,670\nfor example, copy.\n\n52\n00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,230\nIf I use the copy command and\n\n53\n00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,410\nI know it's an alias,\nwhat's the actual commandlet for it?\n\n54\n00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,610\nYou can always run Get-Alias\nfollowed by the specific command, so\n\n55\n00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,750\nI'll say like Get-Alias copy.\n\n56\n00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,360\nAnd when I run that,\nit'll just show me that one, so\n\n57\n00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,260\neasy to kinda narrow it down and find\nthe alias that I wanna see, all right?\n\n58\n00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,925\nAnd there are aliases for\na lot of other systems, like with Linux.\n\n59\n00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:51,439\nI know Fabian in the chat room was\nmentioning it, how we have ls and pwd and\n\n60\n00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,070\ncommands like that,\nthat we're used to from other OSes.\n\n61\n00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,593\nAnd it's just designed to make it\na smaller learning curve when we move\n\n62\n00:02:58,593 --> 00:02:59,760\ninto the PowerShell.\n\n63\n00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,580\nAll right, now, the aliases that\nare there, those are exciting.\n\n64\n00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,521\nNot terribly exciting, but they're there.\n\n65\n00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:07,019\nWe might want to make our own.\n\n66\n00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,910\nNow why would I want to make my own?\n\n67\n00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,870\nWell, maybe there's some command\nnot listed here that I want.\n\n68\n00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,940\nThe one that I always do is edit, right?\n\n69\n00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,230\nWhen I got started in computers,\nI was using DOS 3.3 and the edit command,\n\n70\n00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,489\nit was built right in.\n\n71\n00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,565\nYou had this text-based light ANSI\ngraphics text editor that I used for\n\n72\n00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:29,830\nyears and years and years.\n\n73\n00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,080\nAnd then one day,\nMicrosoft said you know what?\n\n74\n00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,350\nWe're not gonna support that anymore.\n\n75\n00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,310\nWe're gonna get rid of edit and\nso it's gone.\n\n76\n00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,122\nWell, to this day,\nwhen I go to edit a file,\n\n77\n00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:41,097\nI will often type edit\nfollowed by a file name.\n\n78\n00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:46,190\nSo if I go into a directory\nlike my user account and\n\n79\n00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:52,789\nI want to edit a file here called\ntest.txt, I might type edit.\n\n80\n00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:53,930\nIt doesn't have that command.\n\n81\n00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,560\nEven if I went to the command\nprompt it's not there either.\n\n82\n00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,830\nSo I might want to create an alias for\nthat.\n\n83\n00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,825\nAnd aliases are really easy to create.\n\n84\n00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:05,922\nYou basically just say Set-Alias, and then\nthe word you want to use is the alias.\n\n85\n00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:07,310\nI'm gonna create one called edit.\n\n86\n00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:14,040\nNow an alias is mapping\na name to a command.\n\n87\n00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,910\nAnd what would normally\nfollow here is a commandlet.\n\n88\n00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,610\nBut there is no commandlet that\nprovides me an editor either.\n\n89\n00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,830\nSo the other we can do with\nan alias is point it to a binary.\n\n90\n00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,740\nAnd that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n91\n00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,149\nI'm gonna create an alias that's\ngonna tie this to Notepad.\n\n92\n00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:34,750\nSo I'm gonna go in here and\nspecify that my alias for\n\n93\n00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,321\nedit points to\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe.\n\n94\n00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,651\nNow when I type that old edit command\nthat I'm just used to typing,\n\n95\n00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:47,694\nit'll launch Notepad, and fire that up so\nthat I can edit that file, all right,\n\n96\n00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:49,540\npretty simple there.\n\n97\n00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,420\nThe way the alias works is any time\nI type the word edit, anything after\n\n98\n00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:01,568\nthe word edit will be passed as a\nparameter to this command, to notepad.exe.\n\n99\n00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:02,440\nAll right.\n\n100\n00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,049\nOne limitation of an alias is\nyou can't do other parameters.\n\n101\n00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:11,240\nI can't add parameters\nhere to the alias itself.\n\n102\n00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,130\nSo if I wanted to run notepad.exe/q or\nsomething like that, you can't do it,\n\n103\n00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,030\nall right?\n\n104\n00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,881\nFor that, we'll have to use functions and\nwe'll see that in the next segment, but\n\n105\n00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,276\nas far as this is concerned,\nthis is gonna work perfect for\n\n106\n00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:27,937\nme because now when I type edit, test.txt.\n\n107\n00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:33,256\nIt'll take that test.txt and\nfeed that as a parameter to notepad.exe,\n\n108\n00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:36,189\nand so when I run it, there's Notepad.\n\n109\n00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:39,430\nIt's telling me text.txt doesn't exist,\ndo I want to create a new one?\n\n110\n00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,560\nSure.\n\n111\n00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,253\nI'll say this is my file, and\nI'll go ahead and save that.\n\n112\n00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:50,319\nSo now I've got that file, and the next\ntime I do edit test.txt, there it is.\n\n113\n00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,595\nSo now I've got that command available and\nI'm able to use it.\n\n114\n00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:58,877\nOne little word of caution here,\nthe aliases are actually tied to your\n\n115\n00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:03,684\ncurrent session so when you close out and\ngo back in, your aliases may be gone.\n\n116\n00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:07,716\nJump ahead, we'll have a video on\nmodifying your profile in PowerShell and\n\n117\n00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:11,822\nyou can set these aliases to be recreated\nevery time you launch a PowerShell.\n\n118\n00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,680\nThat way they're always there for you.\n\n119\n00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,870\nIf it's a temporary thing,\nthen it's great.\n\n120\n00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,720\nIt's like this, you close out of\nPowerShell and they'll go away.\n\n121\n00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,784\nBut if you want it to be around long term,\nyou'll wanna go ahead and\n\n122\n00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,000\nadd that to your profile.\n\n123\n00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,824\nAll right.\n\n124\n00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,196\nIf we wanna get rid of an alias,\n\n125\n00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:31,760\nyou can use the Remove-Alias command,\nand I can remove edit.\n\n126\n00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,030\nOh shoot, sorry.\n\n127\n00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,180\nThis one's a little bit weird.\n\n128\n00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,397\nWe actually have to do Remove-Item.\n\n129\n00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,705\nAnd then alias:edit.\n\n130\n00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:43,070\nRemove-Item is like a generic\nremoval command and so\n\n131\n00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,060\nthey don't actually have a remove just for\naliases.\n\n132\n00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,150\nBecause they know if you close\nPowerShell they go away.\n\n133\n00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,880\nSo why do you need a remove?\n\n134\n00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,846\nSo if we want to force it we\nhave to use Remove-Item but\n\n135\n00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,347\nit doesn't know what kind of item it is.\n\n136\n00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:58,390\nSo we have to say alias: and the name\nof the alias and that will remove it.\n\n137\n00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,100\nNow depending on your system it\nmight not actually get removed.\n\n138\n00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,740\nThat does happen where it stays resident.\n\n139\n00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,210\nAnd I'll bet mine has done\nthat because I'm on a server.\n\n140\n00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,030\nAnd so if I run edit.\n\n141\n00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,620\nIt did actually remove it.\n\n142\n00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,280\nI have seen sometimes where the alias will\nstay even after you've done a Remove-Item\n\n143\n00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,650\nand that's because of the way\nthe PowerShell does the caching.\n\n144\n00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,890\nIn that case you can just close\nPowerShell and reopen it again and\n\n145\n00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,322\nthat will take care of it.\n\n146\n00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,590\nBut that's how we can\ncreate that alias and\n\n147\n00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,260\nremove it if we need it gone, right now.\n\n148\n00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,100\nAll right, now with our aliases they're\npretty easy, pretty simple to create.\n\n149\n00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,183\nRemember we did Set-Dash alias,\nfollowed by a name and\n\n150\n00:07:36,183 --> 00:07:39,835\nthen whatever command it was\nthat we wanted, all right.\n\n151\n00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:44,115\nThat command could be a commandlet or it\ncan be an actual binary, an executable, or\n\n152\n00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,245\neven a script for that matter.\n\n153\n00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,745\nYou can do an alias for\nall sorts of things.\n\n154\n00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:52,890\nIf we wanna remove it, we have to use\nRemove-Item followed by the alias: and\n\n155\n00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,840\nwhatever the actual alias name is,\n\n156\n00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,360\nso pretty straightforward\nprocess right there.\n\n157\n00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,220\nAnd when you create your own aliases,\n\n158\n00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,010\nlike if I go back here and\ncreate that alias again.\n\n159\n00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,430\nWhen you run Get-Alias, you'll see\nit in there, it'll be in the list.\n\n160\n00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,130\nYou know, these are just alphabetized,\nso I can just go in, find my alias and\n\n161\n00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,630\nit will be listed right there.\n\n162\n00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,730\nSo that's a basic overview of aliases.\n\n163\n00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,580\nFor a more powerful option,\ntake a look at functions.\n\n164\n00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,293\nAnd that's what we're going to be covering\nin the next segment, so stay tuned.\n\n165\n00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,313\nThere is more PowerShell after this.\n\n166\n00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:27,653\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:14,686\nIf you watched our segment on aliases,\n\n4\n00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:18,625\nwe covered how to create a name that\nrepresented some other command.\n\n5\n00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:23,205\nAnd I mentioned in there that one of\nthe limitations of an alias is that you\n\n6\n00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:27,875\ncan't preload as part of the alias\ncommand line modifiers for a command.\n\n7\n00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,330\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n8\n00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,130\nThe alias that I created in\nthat shell was the edit alias.\n\n9\n00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,560\nI tied the name edit to notepad.exe.\n\n10\n00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,030\nWell, what if I wanted to have an alias\nthat automatically edited a specific\n\n11\n00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,280\nfile, all right?\n\n12\n00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,750\nA great example, and this is one that I\nuse myself, is the hosts file in Windows.\n\n13\n00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,160\nThe host file is what overrides our DNS\nlookups so you can map IPs to names, and\n\n14\n00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,500\nI find I end up editing\nthat more than I should.\n\n15\n00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,890\nBut if I wanted to create a single command\nthat I could run that would allow me\n\n16\n00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,330\nto edit the host file,\n\n17\n00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,440\nwell I would need to be passing\nthe file name along with notepad.exe.\n\n18\n00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,390\nAll right so\nI'd need to change the way this works.\n\n19\n00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,494\nWhen we did the alias\nit was set-alias edit.\n\n20\n00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,270\nAnd then I specified\nthe path to notepad right.\n\n21\n00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,090\nSo this is the command that I\nran there to create the alias.\n\n22\n00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,790\nJust mapping the name to a command.\n\n23\n00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,260\nAnd when I use that alias, you would type\nedit, and then whatever you wanted, right.\n\n24\n00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,940\nYou might have modifiers.\n\n25\n00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,850\nYou might have a filename, whatever it is.\n\n26\n00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,880\nYou punch in that information.\n\n27\n00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,605\nAnything you type after edit\nwill get passed to Notepad so\n\n28\n00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:46,690\nthis would actually run as Notepad\n/q /a hosts.txt, all right.\n\n29\n00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,680\nBut what if I wanted to\nautomatically have this stuff in it?\n\n30\n00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,570\nWell, it won't let you do that.\n\n31\n00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,280\nSo if I do, like,\nset-alias edit-hosts, right.\n\n32\n00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,375\nI wanna create an alias called edit-hosts,\nthat'll edit that host file, all right.\n\n33\n00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:06,042\nAnd I try and map that to C:\\windows.\n\n34\n00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,834\nWhoops, if I type it\nright it'll work better.\n\n35\n00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:10,792\n[LAUGH] It is not my day for typing.\n\n36\n00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:15,232\nSystem32\\notepad.exe and\n\n37\n00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:20,167\nthen the file that I wanted to edit.\n\n38\n00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:25,166\nWhich this one is buried away in here so\nit is right there.\n\n39\n00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:29,820\nOkay, so\nI'm mapping the name edit-hosts, and\n\n40\n00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,930\nI'm trying to map it to this program,\nwith this command line modifier,\n\n41\n00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,440\nafter it telling it which file\nI want to edit, all right.\n\n42\n00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,240\nWell, aliases don't like that.\n\n43\n00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,490\nWhen I run that it's gonna get upset,\nokay.\n\n44\n00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,320\nAnd it's not just the space that\ncauses the problem, if I go in and\n\n45\n00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,130\nput quotes around it to\ntake care of the space,\n\n46\n00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,420\nit's not gonna be too much\nhappier in that scenario either.\n\n47\n00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,780\nIt ran, and\nif I do a get-alias and I go and\n\n48\n00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,320\nfind that edit-hosts,\nlook at what my alias is.\n\n49\n00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,740\nIt's nothing, all right.\n\n50\n00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,960\nIt didn't give me an error, but\nit didn't work either, right.\n\n51\n00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,910\nSo that's not gonna help me very much.\n\n52\n00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,440\nSo, if I wanna do an advanced alias,\n\n53\n00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,380\nsomething that does more than just\nprovides a command to map to.\n\n54\n00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,070\nWe need to use a function.\n\n55\n00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,570\nFunctions allow you to attach all\nsorts of stuff to a name, and\n\n56\n00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,420\nthe function really becomes\nits own unique command.\n\n57\n00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,930\nIt's very cool stuff.\n\n58\n00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,790\nSo that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n59\n00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,470\nI just need to get rid of\nthat one that we just made.\n\n60\n00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,130\nWe'll remove that.\n\n61\n00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,050\nIn fact, there's already a lot\nof functions that are present\n\n62\n00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,430\ninside of the system.\n\n63\n00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,960\nWhen you do get-command, and you pull\nup that list of all the commands in\n\n64\n00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,440\nPowershell, notice how I just had a bunch\nof screens go by that were functions,\n\n65\n00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,700\nand now I've got a bunch\nthat are commandlets.\n\n66\n00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,140\nSo here I'm looking at the commandlets and\nif I scroll back up,\n\n67\n00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,800\nthere's a lot of commands up here that\naren't commandlets at all, here but\n\n68\n00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,010\nthey're functions, all right.\n\n69\n00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,930\nSo what is a function?\n\n70\n00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,980\nWell it's something that\ndoes more than one thing.\n\n71\n00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,230\nAnd that's what I wanna do,\nI wanna run Notepad.\n\n72\n00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,870\nBut I don't just wanna run it by itself,\nI wanna pass some values to it,\n\n73\n00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,160\nsome other things.\n\n74\n00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,630\nI might have conditions.\n\n75\n00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,920\nWhen you run this command, check and\nsee if I have a network connection.\n\n76\n00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,910\nAnd if I do, do this.\n\n77\n00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,400\nIf I don't have a network connection,\nthen do this other thing.\n\n78\n00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,940\nYou can't do that with an alias.\n\n79\n00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,260\nBut you can with a function.\n\n80\n00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,430\nThey're very, very powerful, all right.\n\n81\n00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,000\nLet me show you the basic way for\ncreating a function.\n\n82\n00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,550\nWe start with just the function command.\n\n83\n00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,470\nI know that's a little bit\nweird because in PowerShell\n\n84\n00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,330\nmost things are the verb noun format,\nbut this one we just say function.\n\n85\n00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,140\nThat lets it know that we're\nabout to create a function.\n\n86\n00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,310\nAnd then we can say the name\nwe want the function to have.\n\n87\n00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,300\nAnd I'm gonna call mine edit-hosts,\nall right.\n\n88\n00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,120\nThen you do the curly bracket, and then\nyou can put whatever you want in there.\n\n89\n00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,720\nYou can put one command, a series of\ncommands, you can put all sorts of logic,\n\n90\n00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,600\nyou can do a ton of stuff\ninside of a function.\n\n91\n00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,670\nWell mine's fairly simple.\n\n92\n00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,090\nI don't need a ton of logic.\n\n93\n00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,690\nI just want it to run Notepad,\nand edit my file.\n\n94\n00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,560\nNow, I could type out the full command,\nbut I'm actually gonna recycle my alias.\n\n95\n00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,720\nRemember that alias I made was edit.\n\n96\n00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,320\nSo I can actually reuse that.\n\n97\n00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,014\nHere I'm gonna say edit\n\n98\n00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:25,292\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\Etc\\Hosts,\nright.\n\n99\n00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,510\nOh my head is on top of that,\nlet me scroll up a bit.\n\n100\n00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,208\nThere we go.\n\n101\n00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,610\nSo you can see the file that I'm editing,\nand I'll just go with curly bracket.\n\n102\n00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:40,310\nSo I could have, right here, I could have\ntyped C:\\Windows\\System32\\Notepad.exe.\n\n103\n00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,750\nBut since I already had an alias for\n\n104\n00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,070\nit I'm just gonna reuse that alias right\nhere, save me a little bit of typing.\n\n105\n00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,508\nAnd then I'm passing to that\nalias this modifier, all right.\n\n106\n00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:52,318\nNow edit-hosts is a lot more powerful.\n\n107\n00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:57,370\nSo alias Is just a name to a command,\nand that's it.\n\n108\n00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,371\nA function though, is a name to a series\nof events of limitless power, right.\n\n109\n00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:04,720\nThat's a cool way to look at it.\n\n110\n00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,390\nYou can do all sorts of\ncrazy stuff in a function.\n\n111\n00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,940\nAnd when I run that, it's gonna log it, so\n\n112\n00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,710\nnow I've got this function\ncreated called edit-hosts.\n\n113\n00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,350\nAnd when I run it, I can be anywhere on\nmy computer, any prompt that I'm at and\n\n114\n00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,230\nI can just type edit hosts, and\n\n115\n00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,360\nwhen I run that, it fires up Notepad,\nand here I am in the Windows host file.\n\n116\n00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,580\nAnd I can come in and I can start to\nadd entries that I need to modify.\n\n117\n00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,532\nNow I need to make sure that I ran\nmy prompt as an administrator,\n\n118\n00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:30,333\notherwise I won't be able to save it.\n\n119\n00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:35,639\nBut I can come in here and say like,\nmy local machine has itprotv.net,\n\n120\n00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,667\nwww, that's one of our test domains that\nwe use, so I might throw that in there.\n\n121\n00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,231\nAnd now whenever I try and\ngo to www.itprotv.net,\n\n122\n00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:47,500\nit will just go to my own machine.\n\n123\n00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,480\nI close that out.\n\n124\n00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,930\nAnd we can always pull that right back up.\n\n125\n00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,890\nAnd there it is.\n\n126\n00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,210\nMy values are saved, right.\n\n127\n00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,310\nNice little shortcut that we've made,\nvery easy to do.\n\n128\n00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,120\nBecause it's a function, what I could have\ndone is put that edit-host in there, and\n\n129\n00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,262\nthen right after it,\nexecuted another command,\n\n130\n00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:11,570\nlike: ipconfig/flushdns,\nand flush my DNS cache.\n\n131\n00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,270\nYou don't have to do that cuz\na host file would override it, but\n\n132\n00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,030\nthat's the idea that we can\nhave a series of events.\n\n133\n00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,360\nYou can even call a script.\n\n134\n00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,000\nThere's all sorts of neat stuff\nthat you can do in a function.\n\n135\n00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,290\nBasically these curly brackets say,\nall right sky's the limit.\n\n136\n00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,780\nWhatever you can think of to\nput in here is gonna run, and\n\n137\n00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,170\njust close the curly\nbrackets when your done.\n\n138\n00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,170\nNow you've got the function in place,\nall right.\n\n139\n00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,150\nSo very powerful it's like\nan advanced version of a alias,\n\n140\n00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,130\nthere we go a little brain freeze there.\n\n141\n00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,650\nSo, pretty neat stuff.\n\n142\n00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,190\nDefinitely something to take advantage of.\n\n143\n00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,480\nOtherwise as far as functions\nare concerned that's basically it.\n\n144\n00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,380\nI don't wanna go into\nthe programming side.\n\n145\n00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,469\nBut all the other things we learned in the\nother segments can go between those curly\n\n146\n00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:53,590\nbrackets, so you can really\nfit a lot of stuff in there.\n\n147\n00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,300\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed that segment.\n\n148\n00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,000\nStayed tuned, we've got more\nPowerShell coming up after this.\n\n149\n00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,700\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,379\n[SOUND] In this segment,\nwe're gonna take a look at\n\n2\n00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:11,991\nexecuting binaries inside of PowerShell.\n\n3\n00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:16,310\nNow I know what you're thinking,\nDon this is the dumbest segment ever.\n\n4\n00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,570\nto execute a binary,\nyou just type his name and press enter.\n\n5\n00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,130\nWhat's so crazy about that?\n\n6\n00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,780\nWell, for the most part you're right.\n\n7\n00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,670\nYou're exactly right.\n\n8\n00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,110\nYou type a name and press enter and\nthat's how it works.\n\n9\n00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,090\nBut there's a few exceptions to that,\n\n10\n00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,700\ntimes where we might have problems\nwith executing a binary, and\n\n11\n00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,260\nI just want to highlight some of those so\nthat you guys are aware of them.\n\n12\n00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,850\nAll right?\n\n13\n00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,410\nFirst off let's start\nwith that simple example.\n\n14\n00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,230\nWhen it comes to executing a binary,\n\n15\n00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,870\nif you know the name of it you\njust run it, right, so Notepad.\n\n16\n00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,560\nWell, notepad is notepad.exe.\n\n17\n00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,506\nAnd I could type in\nthe full path if I wanted.\n\n18\n00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:52,470\nSo C:\\\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe.\n\n19\n00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,381\nThat works.\n\n20\n00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:54,530\nThat works.\n\n21\n00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,980\nOr if it's in the path, right?\n\n22\n00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,710\nYou have this path variable.\n\n23\n00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,990\nIf you type in $path,\nyou'll see what it is.\n\n24\n00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,430\nAnd mine is not showing up,\nthat's awesome.\n\n25\n00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,000\nSo [LAUGH] I guess I could\ndo write console but\n\n26\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,110\nwe can pull it up in our\nsystem configuration also.\n\n27\n00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,120\nWhoops not that one.\n\n28\n00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,120\nHere let's pull it up this way.\n\n29\n00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,210\nWe can take a look at our path.\n\n30\n00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,340\nAnd the path is what your system is\nsearching for whenever it runs programs\n\n31\n00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,440\nyou have these environment variables, and\none of them is your path right here, and\n\n32\n00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,190\nit's basically just a giant\nlist of directories.\n\n33\n00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,770\nAnd this will be kind of hard to see,\nso let me pull this back up.\n\n34\n00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,560\nHere we go.\n\n35\n00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,830\nSo it's this giant list of directories\nthat shows all the different\n\n36\n00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,680\nplaces it'll look for a program.\n\n37\n00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,550\nAnd so you'll see mine has System Roots,\nSystem/32, so all these different folders.\n\n38\n00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,070\nAnd your programs may or\nmay not be in that folder.\n\n39\n00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,160\nIf they are, great,\nthey'll run without a path.\n\n40\n00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,400\nOtherwise, you'll need to specify a path.\n\n41\n00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,185\nSo I can run it with a path, or I can\nrun it without a path like notepad.exe.\n\n42\n00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:09,305\nBecause it's an executable I can\nleave off the extension if I want.\n\n43\n00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:11,835\nI don't have to put .exe or .com.\n\n44\n00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:15,445\nI don't have to put .bat or\n.cmd if I'm running those.\n\n45\n00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:18,290\nSo you can leave little\npieces off if you want.\n\n46\n00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,280\nRunning a binary is pretty simple.\n\n47\n00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,580\nWhen it gets tricky is when we\ninvolve special characters.\n\n48\n00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,470\nWhat do I mean by a special character?\n\n49\n00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,730\nWell things like a space.\n\n50\n00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,320\nSomething as simple as a space can cause\na real problem with running a program.\n\n51\n00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,070\nIf the program is in the path, you can run\njust the program name and you're done.\n\n52\n00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,180\nBut if there's a space\nin the program name,\n\n53\n00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,570\nyou've gotta make sure\nthe PowerShell understands that.\n\n54\n00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,200\nAnd if there's a space in the path,\n\n55\n00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,650\nif you're having to provide a path,\nit has to understand that to.\n\n56\n00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,580\nSo we gotta be ready to handle that.\n\n57\n00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,445\nIf I run something like iexplore.\n\n58\n00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,940\nThat is the Internet explorer,\nor is it iexplorer.\n\n59\n00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,380\nOh, shoot.\n\n60\n00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,580\nOh well, it's probably not in the path.\n\n61\n00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,499\nSo, if I try and run something like that.\n\n62\n00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,200\nLet's go through and\nsee if we can't find this guy.\n\n63\n00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,220\nI'm going to use my tab auto-complete.\n\n64\n00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,800\nActually you can see it right there\nwhat tab auto-complete has done.\n\n65\n00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,050\nWhen I started to type that path,\n\n66\n00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,330\nI typed in C:\\pro and\nI hit Tab to do auto-complete for me.\n\n67\n00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,570\nAnd notice what it did.\n\n68\n00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,370\nIt didn't just put quotes around it.\n\n69\n00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,960\nI mean it did, it put quotes around it so\nI know that there's a space.\n\n70\n00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,390\nBut it stuck this\nampersand at the beginning.\n\n71\n00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,710\nWhat's that all about?\n\n72\n00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,740\nWell, the ampersand is what\nlets PowerShell know, hey,\n\n73\n00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,820\nwe're about to run a program.\n\n74\n00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,290\nAnd there's some spaces in the name.\n\n75\n00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,470\nThat's the warning that we get,\n\n76\n00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,320\nthat we give PowerShell to\nlet it know that's happening.\n\n77\n00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,910\nThat's the little quirk,\nthat's the thing we need to remember.\n\n78\n00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,850\nIf you're executing a binary with spaces\nin the file name or in the path, you've\n\n79\n00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,300\ngot to do an ampersand at the beginning\nand then quotes around the command.\n\n80\n00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,210\nThey can be single quotes like it did,\nor they can be double quotes,\n\n81\n00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,820\nit doesn't matter, and we can continue\nto use tab auto complete to find\n\n82\n00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,840\nwhat it is we're looking for, and\nI'm looking for Internet Explorer.\n\n83\n00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,390\nHere, let me shorten that up a little bit.\n\n84\n00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,440\nI know it starts with IE something or\nanother.\n\n85\n00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,270\nI'll just keep hitting tab.\n\n86\n00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,620\nThere we go, all right.\n\n87\n00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,520\nSo here,\nI don't have a space in the file name.\n\n88\n00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,760\nIt's just IExplorer.exe.\n\n89\n00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,410\nBut, there are spaces in the rest.\n\n90\n00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,250\nSo, we put apostrophes or\n\n91\n00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,170\nquotes around it and an ampersand at\nthe beginning to let it be aware.\n\n92\n00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,180\nAnd when we run that,\nthere it goes it ran Internet Explorer.\n\n93\n00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,860\nRight.\n\n94\n00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,200\nIf you run it without the ampersand,\nsometimes it'll understand,\n\n95\n00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,800\na lot of times it doesn't.\n\n96\n00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,550\nAnd you run that and it ends up just\nechoing the output that you provided.\n\n97\n00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,800\nSo here it is, echoing the output.\n\n98\n00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,870\nThat's it right?\n\n99\n00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,480\nDidn't actually run the program.\n\n100\n00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,880\nThe ampersand is really important.\n\n101\n00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,290\nThere is another scenario\nyou can bump into also.\n\n102\n00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,370\nSometimes it's not so\nmuch about a space in a file name,\n\n103\n00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,070\nas it is special characters in\nthe command that you're running.\n\n104\n00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:03,305\nSo, for example, if I have Had a file,\nlet's say C:\\test.txt all right.\n\n105\n00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:09,945\nSo I'm gonna say this is a test,\nwhoops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n106\n00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:11,975\nI just want to save and get out.\n\n107\n00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:16,245\nAlright, so I've got a file now,\nthat is test.txt.\n\n108\n00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:21,070\nThere it is, and I might want\nto modify the file permissions.\n\n109\n00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,900\nWell I know the GY I can go pull\nup the properties of the file, but\n\n110\n00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,030\nI can modify file permissions right from\nthe command line using the icacls or\n\n111\n00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,620\nI C A C L S command line\nutility to change those.\n\n112\n00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,400\nWell, one of the problems\nwith the icacls command line\n\n113\n00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,170\nis it uses a lot of special characters.\n\n114\n00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,100\nIt uses parenthesis,\nthat's the main one that causes problems.\n\n115\n00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,190\nAnd PowerShell can choke on those\nparentheses, it'll interpret them wrong.\n\n116\n00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,840\nAnd so it's another area\nwhere we have to be careful\n\n117\n00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,820\nabout what we're providing it, all right?\n\n118\n00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,615\nSo for example, if I wanted to run icacls\n\n119\n00:05:55,615 --> 00:06:03,120\nC:\\test.txt, and\ngonna give myself full control, right?\n\n120\n00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,960\nSo I need to specify who I am.\n\n121\n00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,470\nAll right.\n\n122\n00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,270\nAnd I'm gonna give myself,\nwell you know what?\n\n123\n00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,450\nI'm gonna set some inheritance I guess.\n\n124\n00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,370\nAnd then I need to modify that.\n\n125\n00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,610\nI want my component inheritance and\nobject, or it's container and object.\n\n126\n00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,510\nI really just need object cuz it's not\na folder, but I'll set those and F.\n\n127\n00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,890\nI'm going to give myself full control.\n\n128\n00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,860\nSo, I'm going to give myself\nfull control of that file, but\n\n129\n00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,590\nI've got quote marks inside of my commend,\nI've got a colon inside of my command,\n\n130\n00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,430\nand I've got some parentheses\ninside of my command, and\n\n131\n00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,250\nall of those can cause\nproblems with PowerShell.\n\n132\n00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,570\nIf I run that, it may work,\nit may not, but\n\n133\n00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,960\nnotice what it says here\nThe term CI is not recognized.\n\n134\n00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,050\nIt was actually happy all the way along,\nuntil it got to here.\n\n135\n00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,010\nThe colon kinda threw it.\n\n136\n00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,110\nAnd then the CI,\nit tried to run that as a command.\n\n137\n00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,030\nAnd that didn't work, and it broke.\n\n138\n00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,720\nRight?\nIt wasn't able to execute my command.\n\n139\n00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,310\nAnd in the syntax highlighting down here,\nit shows my command.\n\n140\n00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,920\nAnd notice right here these\nlittle squigglies The tilds.\n\n141\n00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,160\nThat's it telling me where\nthe command broke down.\n\n142\n00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,490\nSo it broke down here because\nof special characters.\n\n143\n00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,401\nNow if I want to try to get around\nthat there's a neat little shortcut\n\n144\n00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,670\nyou can use.\n\n145\n00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,480\nThere's a value we can stick in here\nthat tells PowerShell hey the name of\n\n146\n00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,800\nthe program is over, the rest of this\nstuff is for that program, not for you.\n\n147\n00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,640\nWe can tell PowerShell to stop\ninterpreting the rest of the line.\n\n148\n00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,860\nIt'll just take the rest of the line and\nfeed it to the program we're calling.\n\n149\n00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:48,126\nSo when I called icacls right here all\nthis other stuff C:/test.text/grant,\n\n150\n00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:52,580\nall this other stuff,\nicacls cares about that.\n\n151\n00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,660\nNot PowerShell.\n\n152\n00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,560\nSo I can come in here and\nI can add a little bit more to it.\n\n153\n00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,900\nAnd you can kind of pick\nwhere you want it to be.\n\n154\n00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,220\nI usually stick it after the file name.\n\n155\n00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,210\nBecause you know PowerShell\nis happy up to that point.\n\n156\n00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,340\nThe symbol is dash dash percent.\n\n157\n00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340\nOr hyphen hyphen percent.\n\n158\n00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,970\nWhen you put that in,\nthat tells PowerShell from this point on\n\n159\n00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,110\neverything after hyphen\nhyphen percent ignore it.\n\n160\n00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,250\nDon't process it.\n\n161\n00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,014\nJust hand it to whatever program or\ncommand that we're running.\n\n162\n00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:27,160\nAnd let them deal with it.\n\n163\n00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,380\nSo now the fact that I have these special\ncharacters over here is no big deal.\n\n164\n00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,370\nBecause PowerShell is gonna\nignore everything else and\n\n165\n00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,830\ntake all of that and\nfeed it unchanged into icacls.\n\n166\n00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,560\nAnd if I run that I should have\na little bit better success and,\n\n167\n00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,910\noh it didn't find me.\n\n168\n00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,400\nSo, no mapping between account names and\nsecurity IDs was done.\n\n169\n00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,120\nSo apparently my name\ndidn't look up right.\n\n170\n00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,370\nLet's pick a different user.\n\n171\n00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,250\nAll right, you know what?\n\n172\n00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,890\nI need to use the local machine names,\nthis is Server 01, there we go.\n\n173\n00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,400\nProcess file, successfully\nprocessed one file and it's done.\n\n174\n00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,670\nMuch happier by telling it not to process\nanything beyond that point, right?\n\n175\n00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,370\nSo you may have to use that,\n\n176\n00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,680\nwe really do see that a lot\nwith command line modifiers.\n\n177\n00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,980\nAll right so\nif you're trying to run a command and\n\n178\n00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,540\nyou get something weird like this up here,\njust tell it where to stop processing.\n\n179\n00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,460\nWhere PowerShell is done, and\nthe other program takes over.\n\n180\n00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,540\nAll right.\n\n181\n00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,870\nSo, couple of little caveats there.\n\n182\n00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,490\nFor most people running a binary\nis exactly what we said at\n\n183\n00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,690\nthe beginning of the segment.\n\n184\n00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,280\nYou type in the name,\nyou press enter, and you're done.\n\n185\n00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,240\nAll right?\n\n186\n00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,330\nBut if there's spaces in the path or\nfilename, put that ampersand at\n\n187\n00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,980\nthe beginning and then surround\nthe command with quotes or apostrophes.\n\n188\n00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,540\nIf you have special characters in there\nthough you might need to use the dash dash\n\n189\n00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,440\npercent, which tells you stop\nprocessing beyond this point and\n\n190\n00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,270\nhand that off to the program.\n\n191\n00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,260\nCouple little interesting scenarios there,\nthings that you might bump into and\n\n192\n00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,310\nthat's why we had to do\na segment on executing binaries.\n\n193\n00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,840\nAlright well I hope you guys\nlearned something new there.\n\n194\n00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,786\nIf not, stay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up and\n\n195\n00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:03,747\nI'm sure there will be something there for\nyou, stay tuned.\n\n196\n00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:09,409\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",

for\n\n3\n00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:15.080\nthe various commands that\nwe use in the PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.260\nIt's very unlikely that you're going\nto memorize all the various commands\n\n5\n00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.180\nthat you need.\n\n6\n00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.990\nAnd so very often we've got\nto turn to the documentation.\n\n7\n00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.381\nSometimes you can go to\nMicrosoft's TechNet website and\n\n8\n00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.883\nthere is a wealth of information on there\nand it's very easy to navigate and get at.\n\n9\n00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:32.134\nBut if you're dealing with a server\nthat has no web browser or\n\n10\n00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:35.706\nyou're in a protected network\nwhere you have no Internet access,\n\n11\n00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:38.724\nthen you might not be able to\nget to the TechNet website.\n\n12\n00:00:38.724 --> 00:00:42.170\nAnd in that scenario, you need to rely\non the help tools that are available\n\n13\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.020\ninside of PowrShell and\nfortunately there's a lot of them.\n\n14\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.240\nThere's actually a lot of different things\nwe can do to get information out of it\n\n15\n00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.550\nthat are incredibly useful, all right?\n\n16\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.000\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n17\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.680\nI know in some of the other segments\nthat we've already seen one of\n\n18\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.750\nthe big commands that I like to run,\nand that is the Get-Help command.\n\n19\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.410\nThat's kind of number one go to guy\nwhen I need help for something and\n\n20\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.130\nif you just run Get-Help by itself,\nit'll give you some basic information.\n\n21\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.940\nAnd when we run that, well it's kind of\na lot of information here that scrolls by.\n\n22\n00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.690\nAnd you'll see it's just giving you advice\non how to use the Get-Help command.\n\n23\n00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.570\nAnd that's exactly what I'm gonna\nshow you here in just a moment.\n\n24\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.200\nNow, by default when you run Get-Help,\n\n25\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.110\nyou can then follow it up by specifying\na command to get the help from.\n\n26\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.310\nAnd it will pull that help documentation\nright here from the server that you're on.\n\n27\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.410\nSo if I wanna get help on a command,\nlike I wanna Get-Help Restart-Service, I\n\n28\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.410\nwanna learn more about that command, when\nI run it, it's gonna pull the help for it.\n\n29\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.710\nBut notice on my server here, it's saying\nGet-Help cannot find the Help files for\n\n30\n00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.870\nthis cmdlet on this computer.\n\n31\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.810\nAll right, what's that all about?\n\n32\n00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.970\nWell, when someone sets up a server\nthey will typically set it up\n\n33\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.180\nwith the minimum functionality\nnecessary to perform its job, and\n\n34\n00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.970\nthey choose to leave off\nthings that aren't required.\n\n35\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.460\nWell, the help files for PowerShell\naren't necessarily required, and so\n\n36\n00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.160\nsome admins will choose to leave them off.\n\n37\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.460\nNow, if your system is\nconnected to the Internet,\n\n38\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.730\nyou may just go to the TechNet site and\nuse that.\n\n39\n00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.060\nThere's also a little extension we\ncan use to this, we can say Get-Help,\n\n40\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.400\nthe command we want help on, and then you\ncan add the -Online command, all right.\n\n41\n00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.440\nAnd that's gonna tell it to reach out to\nMicrosoft's site, and pull up the help for\n\n42\n00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.100\nthat, and see what it did?\n\n43\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.972\nIt went right to the webpage for\nRestart-Service and\n\n44\n00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:34.320\nthere is the information.\n\n45\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.010\nHere is the help file and\nit's got the information that I need,\n\n46\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.590\nthe syntax of the command,\nthe detailed description and\n\n47\n00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.270\nall of the other information\nassociated with it all right here.\n\n48\n00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.410\nSo that's one option for us, but\nit's still doesn't solve the problem of\n\n49\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.540\nwhat if I don't have Internet access,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.340\nIf I don't have Internet access and\nI want to get this help documentation for\n\n51\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.610\na command, that doesn't help me.\n\n52\n00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.420\nWell, if it's already installed\nthen it's not a big deal.\n\n53\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.060\nBut if it isn't installed,\nwe just need to install it, all right.\n\n54\n00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.600\nNow for me this next step is one that I\npretty much do on servers regardless,\n\n55\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.650\neven if the help documentation\nis already installed.\n\n56\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.550\nSometimes it can be out of date.\n\n57\n00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.944\nAnd so we have an Update-Help command\nthat'll reach out to Microsoft servers and\n\n58\n00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:22.448\ndownload the latest version of\nthe help documentation for all for\n\n59\n00:03:22.448 --> 00:03:25.570\nall the commandlets you\nhave installed right now.\n\n60\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.510\nThat's important because you\nmight have added more commandlets\n\n61\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.560\nsince the last time you\nupdated your help files.\n\n62\n00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.100\nSo you may actually be missing some,\n\n63\n00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.260\nand here's a chance for\nit to correct that and update it.\n\n64\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.310\nAnd as service packs and\n\n65\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.590\nhotfixes come out, updates to\nthe help files may be necessary, too.\n\n66\n00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.300\nSo it's definitely a good idea to do it,\nall right.\n\n67\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.260\nNow the update process can take a little\nwhile, and so I've got a second\n\n68\n00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.660\nPowerShell window in the background here\nthat I'm gonna use to do the update.\n\n69\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.900\nAnd if we want to update it and\nhave it go out and get it,\n\n70\n00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.480\nthe command is really simple.\n\n71\n00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.560\nIt's just the Update-Help command.\n\n72\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.550\nAnd when you run that it's\ngonna give us a little prompt.\n\n73\n00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.458\nActually apparently mine's\nnot even going to prompt.\n\n74\n00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:05.870\n[LAUGH] Sometimes it will prompt and say\nare you sure you want to get updates for\n\n75\n00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.600\nall of your commandlets,\nand you say yes or no.\n\n76\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.240\nI must not have any extra\nmodules added in here.\n\n77\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.810\nIf you have extra modules\nit will prompt you,\n\n78\n00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.610\njust to kinda give you a little warning\nabout that it might take a long time.\n\n79\n00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.730\nBut here you see it's going out, and it's\npulling all this help documentation, and\n\n80\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.530\nit's flashing by really fast here, but\n\n81\n00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.890\nit says locating,\nthen downloading, then installing.\n\n82\n00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.780\nThose are the three\nstages it goes through.\n\n83\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.390\nIt'll locate the help content for\n\n84\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.140\na particular commandlet, it'll download\nit, and then it'll install it.\n\n85\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.630\nThis is going to ensure that I have\nthe latest help information on my system.\n\n86\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.570\nAnd then I'm able to reference it even\nwithout an Internet connection, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.790\nThat's a pretty handy thing especially if\nyou've got a server that's a core install.\n\n88\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.390\nNow Microsoft's stance on this is, you\ndon't necessarily need to install the help\n\n89\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.225\non the server because you should be\ndeveloping an PowerShell scripts or\n\n90\n00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:59.305\ncommands that you're gonna be using\non your own workstation first in\n\n91\n00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:00.365\na test environment.\n\n92\n00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:03.055\nSo by the time you come to the server\nyou don't need the help documentation.\n\n93\n00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:05.955\nWhere you just run the commands that\nyou've already thoroughly tested.\n\n94\n00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:07.160\nThat's why it's not installed here.\n\n95\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.640\nThat's why it's an optional component.\n\n96\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.460\nNow I've installed this help\ndocumentation and while it's really,\n\n97\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.220\nreally unlikely, it has technically\nincreased my attack surface.\n\n98\n00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.000\nI put help files on the server that don't\nactually contribute to the function\n\n99\n00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.850\nof this server.\n\n100\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.640\nSo you'll have to take\nthat with a grain of salt.\n\n101\n00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.320\nYou know, when you go to deploy this\nin your own environment, you may or\n\n102\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.600\nmay not actually want to deploy\nthe help files on your server.\n\n103\n00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.270\nBut I actually stalled long\nenough there that it finished.\n\n104\n00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:40.430\nSo now that it's done, if I go back\nhere and I do Get-Help Restart-Service,\n\n105\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.440\nwhen I run that instead of telling\nme it couldn't find a help file,\n\n106\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.200\nnow I get the help documentation and\nit's right here on this server.\n\n107\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.310\nIt didn't have to go out\nto the Internet to get it.\n\n108\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.880\nAll right?\n\n109\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.540\nSo don't be worried if you see\nyour help files are missing.\n\n110\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.200\nJust run Update-Help, It'll run that and\nget everything up to date.\n\n111\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.090\nIt's a good idea to run that periodically\nanyway just to make sure you've got\n\n112\n00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.139\nthe latest help documentation.\n\n113\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.950\nNow, in my scenario,\nI knew the command I was looking for.\n\n114\n00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.680\nAnd so I did Get-Help, I punched in\nthe command that I wanted, and here it is.\n\n115\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.350\nIf you don't know the command that you're\nlooking for, though, you might need to use\n\n116\n00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.730\nthe Get-Command commandlet to be able\nto find the command you're looking for.\n\n117\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:28.130\nIf I know I'm gonna be working with DNS,\nthen I might need to do get-command and do\n\n118\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.190\na search for any command having to do with\nDNS, and we can use wildcards for that.\n\n119\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.810\nI know I've done this\nin another segment but\n\n120\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.170\nin case you haven't watched\nit get-command *dns*.\n\n121\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.590\nThose asterisks mean any number\nof characters before and\n\n122\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.730\nany number of characters after, show me\nall the commands having to do with DNS.\n\n123\n00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.890\nAnd I'll see there's, there's actually\nquite a few that are listed in here,\n\n124\n00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.645\nand let's see, I must not be a DNS\nserver cuz these are all client ones.\n\n125\n00:06:53.645 --> 00:06:56.835\nIf you're running a DNS server you'll\nhave even more that have to do with\n\n126\n00:06:56.835 --> 00:06:58.505\nthe server itself.\n\n127\n00:06:58.505 --> 00:06:59.855\nThe majority of these are functions,\n\n128\n00:06:59.855 --> 00:07:03.585\nyou'll see there's only a few\ncommandlets like Resolve-DNSName.\n\n129\n00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:06.945\nIf I want to learn more about\none of these I can use Get-Help\n\n130\n00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:08.735\nfollowed by the name of that command.\n\n131\n00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:11.630\nFor example if I wanted\nto pull up the help for\n\n132\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.721\nGet-DNSClient I could come in here and\nsay Get-Help followed\n\n133\n00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:22.502\nby Get-DNSClient and\nthere's the help documentation for it.\n\n134\n00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:26.310\nAll right now when we get the help\ndocumentation, what is it telling us?\n\n135\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.735\nWell the format of the help documentation,\n\n136\n00:07:29.735 --> 00:07:33.260\nit actually follows a standard,\na pattern that Microsoft created.\n\n137\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.800\nSo all the documentation\nis written the same way.\n\n138\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.613\nWhen you run Get-Help for a command,\n\n139\n00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:41.738\nit's typically gonna return these\nfive areas for us right here.\n\n140\n00:07:41.738 --> 00:07:47.575\nA synopsis which is just a quick short\ndescription of what the command does.\n\n141\n00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:48.357\nIn this case,\n\n142\n00:07:48.357 --> 00:07:53.010\nretrieves details of network interfaces\nconfigured on a specific computer.\n\n143\n00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.240\nSo this ones gonna go out and get\ninformation about my network interfaces.\n\n144\n00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.732\nAnd then we see the syntax.\n\n145\n00:07:58.732 --> 00:08:02.954\nThis is what we actually type into\nthe PowerShell to use the command.\n\n146\n00:08:02.954 --> 00:08:07.514\nAnd it'll start out with the command\nitself And then it'll list all\n\n147\n00:08:07.514 --> 00:08:12.170\nof the modifiers for that command,\nand there can be a bunch of them.\n\n148\n00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.460\nLook at all these that are listed here,\nforget -DnsClient.\n\n149\n00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.855\nWell, they're not all required.\n\n150\n00:08:17.855 --> 00:08:21.280\nSome of them are required,\nsome of them are optional, and\n\n151\n00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.510\nit can be a little tricky\nto recognize that.\n\n152\n00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.550\nWhen you start to look at them,\nthese square brackets are how\n\n153\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.540\nwe know whether we've got a required\nsetting, or an optional setting, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:39.042\nWhen you see one that's written like\nthis -InterFaceAlias String, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:45.120\nWhat that's telling me is, when I run\nGet-DNSClient, I can specify the alias for\n\n156\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.810\nan interface, the name of an interface\nthat I want to find out information for.\n\n157\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:53.380\nAnd if I do that, I need to specify\nthe string, the name that I'm looking for.\n\n158\n00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.520\nAnd it's surrounded by\nthese square brackets,\n\n159\n00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.910\ntelling me that this is\nan optional parameter.\n\n160\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:05.840\nI don't have to specify this if don't\nwant to, I can leave it off, right?\n\n161\n00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.080\nWhen we have one that's required, let's\nsee if any of these are actually required.\n\n162\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.120\nSo this one's optional,\ncuz they're grouped together,\n\n163\n00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.390\nthis one's optional cuz\nthey're grouped together.\n\n164\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.150\nThe next one's optional,\nare they all optional in this one?\n\n165\n00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.340\nIt looks like they are.\n\n166\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.860\nYeah, they're all optional on this one.\n\n167\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.200\nOkay so, sometimes you'll have\na command where they're all optional.\n\n168\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.510\nIn other words,\nI can just run get-DnsClient, all right?\n\n169\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.900\nAnd when I run that by itself,\nit runs, right?\n\n170\n00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.360\nI didn't have to provide any\nmodifiers if I didn't want to.\n\n171\n00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.560\nBut there's other commands\nthat you do have to.\n\n172\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.140\nSo, for example, Restart-Service.\n\n173\n00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.330\nIf I just run that by itself,\nit's not very happy about it.\n\n174\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.410\nAnd now it's prompting me for\nother values that I needed to provided.\n\n175\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.080\nIt's asking for\nsome kind of input that I didn't give it.\n\n176\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.080\nAnd I could go and\nstart to specify that if I wanted.\n\n177\n00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.830\nIt's just telling me hey, at position one,\nwe needed a parameter called InputObject,\n\n178\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.820\nand we didn't give it one, all right?\n\n179\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.910\nSo, what we can do is we can\ndo get-help for that command.\n\n180\n00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.350\nThat'll be a better example for us.\n\n181\n00:10:11.034 --> 00:10:16.339\nAnd when I pull up it's information,\nin the syntax, I see Restart-Service and\n\n182\n00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:20.553\nthen we've got this -InputObject\n-ServiceController, and\n\n183\n00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:25.010\nthen we've got -Exclude, -Force,\na few other things, right?\n\n184\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.690\nSo it's giving us these\nvarious information,\n\n185\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.780\nthese various values that we can provide.\n\n186\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.620\nBut right down here,\nthis is the most common usage.\n\n187\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.180\nThere's actually three different usages\nfor this command that they're listing.\n\n188\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:41.500\nThe last one is the one that we normally\ndo, Restart-Service -Name and a string.\n\n189\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.290\nThe name of the service we're starting,\nbut look how it's written.\n\n190\n00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:50.070\nSee how -Name and -String,\nthey're not surrounded by square brackets.\n\n191\n00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.678\nSure, -Name has square brackets around it,\nand\n\n192\n00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:57.780\n-String, it actually contains the square\nbrackets indicating that there's a string.\n\n193\n00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.440\nBut there's not a set of square brackets\nthat actually encompasses both of them.\n\n194\n00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.470\nBecause there's no brackets\naround both of them,\n\n195\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.010\nthat's our indicator that\nthis is a required value.\n\n196\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.230\nI have to provide a name.\n\n197\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.482\nNow, in this scenario, there's actually\na little bit something special here.\n\n198\n00:11:17.482 --> 00:11:22.870\nThat -Name, that's actually the default\nparameter for Restart-Service, so\n\n199\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.230\nI could leave that part out if I wanted,\nbut I'd have to provide the string.\n\n200\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:32.100\nSo if I did something like, let me\nswitch to my administrative shell here.\n\n201\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.450\nSo I'm gonna do Restart-Service.\n\n202\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.480\nI could say -Name and\nthen the name of the service.\n\n203\n00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.660\nAnd so I'll do Dnsclient.\n\n204\n00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.613\nAll right?\n\n205\n00:11:41.613 --> 00:11:44.190\nActually, it's Dnscache,\nis it what it's called.\n\n206\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.080\nThere we go.\n\n207\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.340\nSo, I just restarted that service.\n\n208\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.890\nBut I could leave off -Name\nbecause that's the default.\n\n209\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.220\nThe default parameter is -Name so\nit knows it, and it's happy with that.\n\n210\n00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.160\nAll right, so\nwhen we're reading the help file,\n\n211\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.660\nthat's one of the more\ncryptic things to understand.\n\n212\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:07.070\nWhen you're looking at the syntax here,\nlet me clear my screen, and when we go and\n\n213\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.270\nlook at the syntax here,\nif these values are separated and\n\n214\n00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.690\nnot grouped together in square bracket,\nthat means it's required.\n\n215\n00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.620\nIf they're combined like this one,\n-Exclude String and\n\n216\n00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.590\nthey've got square brackets around\nboth sides, that means it's optional.\n\n217\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.980\nWe don't have to include it.\n\n218\n00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.570\nAll right?\n\n219\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.030\nBut there's our syntax that it kind\nof lays out as it goes through and\n\n220\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.880\nprovides that information.\n\n221\n00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.440\nIf you see something like this, -Force,\nand it's not followed by any kind of\n\n222\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.850\nstring or other value that we provide,\nthat one's gonna be optional also.\n\n223\n00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:41.340\nThere's no second value attached to it,\nso you don't have to provide that.\n\n224\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:46.160\nSo it's just when we see\na parameter followed by a string or\n\n225\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.260\ninput of some sort and\nthey're not surrounded by square brackets.\n\n226\n00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.100\nThat's when they're required.\n\n227\n00:12:52.359 --> 00:12:56.710\nAll right, so that was the synopsis,\nthe description of the command.\n\n228\n00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:01.540\nThere's the syntax, the command line that\nwe're actually going to be typing in and\n\n229\n00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.970\nthen a detailed description.\n\n230\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.160\nThe synopsis is designed\nto be a short summary.\n\n231\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.140\nLike a one sentence type thing,\nalthough sometimes it's longer.\n\n232\n00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.190\nThe description, on the other hand,\nit might be a paragraph like this one is,\n\n233\n00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.390\nit might actually be several pages.\n\n234\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.480\nThere's a few of them,\nlike the time server commands,\n\n235\n00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.460\nthat are really, really long,\nbased on whatever it is that command does.\n\n236\n00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.570\nSo it may be a huge description,\nit may be very brief like this one.\n\n237\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.990\nThis one just giving us a detailed\nexplanation of what happens.\n\n238\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:33.700\nAnd then the last part that it displays\nare the related links and remarks.\n\n239\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.711\nThe related links are other websites or\n\n240\n00:13:36.711 --> 00:13:40.630\nother commandlets that we might want\nto look at that are related to this.\n\n241\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.220\nAnd the remarks are just other comments.\n\n242\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.700\nIn this case, the comments happen\nto be some examples, right,\n\n243\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.510\nbut they aren't always examples.\n\n244\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.140\nYou know what, actually, this one's\ntelling us how to get the examples.\n\n245\n00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.090\nBut the remarks can be anything that\n\n246\n00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.130\nthe author of this command help\nfile decided to put in there.\n\n247\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.088\nI mean, they could put all sorts of stuff.\n\n248\n00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:02.230\nBut, on related links,\nthe online information here,\n\n249\n00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.810\nthat's telling us where to go and\nget the help file on the website.\n\n250\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.840\nAnd then here are other\ncommands related to this one.\n\n251\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.650\nStop a service, start a service,\nresume, or pause, suspend.\n\n252\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.420\nSo there's the different commands right\nthere that are related to this one.\n\n253\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.370\nAll good information.\n\n254\n00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.540\nBut, this is not the full help file.\n\n255\n00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.470\nThis is actually an abbreviated\nform of the help for this command.\n\n256\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.790\nMicrosoft is just showing us\nwhat's most commonly needed.\n\n257\n00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:35.560\nIf you want to see the full file,\nthe whole shebang, you can run Get-Help,\n\n258\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.210\nthe name of the command and\nyou can follow that up with -Full.\n\n259\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.930\nThat will show you the whole\nhelp documentation.\n\n260\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:49.140\nNow that help documentation is going to\nextend beyond one screen, almost always.\n\n261\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.140\nAnd so\nI usually pipe that into the more command.\n\n262\n00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.330\nAnd that way, every page, it'll stop and\nyou can hit space bar to advance it.\n\n263\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.310\nSo I'm going to do that.\n\n264\n00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.300\nAnd so here we see the name,\nsynopsis, syntax, the description.\n\n265\n00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.150\nSo far, things are the same.\n\n266\n00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.630\nBut now I've got parameters.\n\n267\n00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:07.140\nWhat is this?\n\n268\n00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.790\nWell, it's gonna take each and\nevery one of these parameters up here,\n\n269\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.280\nlike -Exclude.\n\n270\n00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.130\nWell, what does -Exclude do?\n\n271\n00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.710\nIt excludes something.\n\n272\n00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.850\nWhat is it excluding?\n\n273\n00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.440\nWell, we can look down here, and\nit'll tell us what it's excluding.\n\n274\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.810\nSo we can just scroll down until we find,\n\n275\n00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.320\nhere it is,\n-Exclude omits the specified services.\n\n276\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.610\nThe value of this parameter\nqualifies the name.\n\n277\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.710\nEnter a name element or a pattern,\nsuch as s, star, wildcards are permitted.\n\n278\n00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:35.010\nSo, if I want to restart all\nof my services, except for\n\n279\n00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.850\nthis one, I can do it, or\nany one that starts with S, or whatever.\n\n280\n00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.350\nWe can do that.\n\n281\n00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.510\nAnd then we'll see -Force, -Include.\n\n282\n00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.350\nIt's basically giving me the detailed\ninformation about each one and\n\n283\n00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.440\nit's also clarifying in black and\nwhite terms,\n\n284\n00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.290\nno room for argument,\nwhether it's required or not, right?\n\n285\n00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.210\nSo we get that information right here.\n\n286\n00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.101\nVery easy to tell whether we need it.\n\n287\n00:15:58.101 --> 00:16:02.415\nAll right, now beyond that We\nget some additional inputs.\n\n288\n00:16:02.415 --> 00:16:06.040\nThese are inputs, in other words,\nwhere it's getting the information from.\n\n289\n00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.360\nWhen we run restart dash service,\nwhere does it get it's data?\n\n290\n00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.090\nAnd, you're normally\ngoing to see two things.\n\n291\n00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.230\nYou're normally going to see this guy,\nsystem.string,\n\n292\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:19.960\nwhich is data that you've provided it or\nyou might see Service Controller, right?\n\n293\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.550\nWell, ServiceController, that's because\nthis is a restart service command.\n\n294\n00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.040\nOn other commands, you probably\nwon't see the ServiceController.\n\n295\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.290\nYou'll see whatever application, or\nservice or whatever it is process-wise,\n\n296\n00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.890\nthat is tied to that command that you're\nrunning but System.String is almost always\n\n297\n00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.930\nthere, because that's us, providing\ndata but you'll also see this line here.\n\n298\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:42.450\nYou can pipe a service object or a string\nthat contains a service name into it.\n\n299\n00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.030\nThat means this is a pipelineable command.\n\n300\n00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.920\nNot every commandlet supports pipelining,\nso\n\n301\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.500\nit's a good idea to double check that\nbefore we start to put it in use.\n\n302\n00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.490\nThat also gives us the output, right?\n\n303\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.110\nAnd the default output for this one none.\n\n304\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.950\nYou guys saw when I ran\nthe restart service DNS cache\n\n305\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.410\nit just moved me to another line and\nthat was it, I got no output,\n\n306\n00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.972\nno feedback whatsoever,\nthat's the default, right?\n\n307\n00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:08.630\nAnd then it says or\nservice process server controller.\n\n308\n00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.680\nIt's just telling the service\ncontroller that it's done.\n\n309\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.170\nAlright.\n\n310\n00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.760\nBeyond that we get notes and\nthe notes are really valuable.\n\n311\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.160\nThis is where whoever authored\nthis command help file,\n\n312\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.340\ndecided to put examples,\nother information, anecdotes,\n\n313\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.390\nthere's all sorts of crazy\nstuff to be found in here.\n\n314\n00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.510\nAnd these are normally\nreally easy to read.\n\n315\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.371\nThey're written in plain english and\nthey kind of explain and\n\n316\n00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:32.133\ngive you some examples.\n\n317\n00:17:32.133 --> 00:17:35.595\nSo here they're showing,\nrestart-service winmgmt,\n\n318\n00:17:35.595 --> 00:17:39.285\nand it's just telling us that\nthis is gonna restart the WMI.\n\n319\n00:17:39.285 --> 00:17:40.910\nAnd then there's example two.\n\n320\n00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.040\nAnd they're just laying out a couple\nof different examples of how to\n\n321\n00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.900\nuse this command then we get to our\nrelated links and that's the end of it.\n\n322\n00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.370\nSo quite a bit of information\nin the full help file.\n\n323\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.830\nNow for me, I'm normally in a hurry.\n\n324\n00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.640\nIf I'm having to pull up help for\na command, I need to run it.\n\n325\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.210\nI'm in a hurry.\n\n326\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.640\nI don't have time to sift through\nthis whole help documentation.\n\n327\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.940\nI just need to see some examples.\n\n328\n00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.230\nI'm guilty of this,\njust give me the examples and let me go.\n\n329\n00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.550\nWell, when we run get-help,\nwe can tack onto that,\n\n330\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.630\ninstead of -full,\nthere's a few other options.\n\n331\n00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:21.320\nSo we can say like -examples and\nwhen you run that, so\n\n332\n00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:27.820\nI can get-help restart-service-examples\nit cuts out the rest.\n\n333\n00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.720\nWe see the name and the synopsis and\nthen it just cuts right to the examples,\n\n334\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.660\nthe notes.\n\n335\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.050\nAnd I get that information right there.\n\n336\n00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.911\nAnd the reason I'll do that a lot\nof times is because I'm probably\n\n337\n00:18:36.911 --> 00:18:39.510\nnot doing something crazy and\nout of the ordinary.\n\n338\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.594\nI'm probably doing something that is\na standard use case for Microsoft.\n\n339\n00:18:42.594 --> 00:18:46.515\nAnd so the odds are they've got the exact\nsyntax that I need right there.\n\n340\n00:18:46.515 --> 00:18:49.360\nAnd if I just need a quick refresher.\n\n341\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360\nI know how the command works,\n\n342\n00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.470\nI just need a quick refresher\nthe examples work out really well.\n\n343\n00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:58.520\nSo -full that gave me the whole\ndocumentation -examples,\n\n344\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.410\nthat took me right to the examples and\ngave me a much more concise view.\n\n345\n00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.170\nThere's another little option\nthat I kind of like which is,\n\n346\n00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:13.333\nwhen we use get-dash-help with a command,\nyou can add the dash show window command.\n\n347\n00:19:13.333 --> 00:19:13.880\nAll right.\n\n348\n00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.620\nShow window is kind of neat because\nsometimes I want to have the documentation\n\n349\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:23.700\non my screen and have the power\nshell on my screen at the same time.\n\n350\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.290\nWell, if I'm using the TechNet website,\n\n351\n00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.050\nif I'm using the web-based help,\nI can do that, right?\n\n352\n00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.430\nI can pull it up in a web browser, stick\nthat on one side of my screen and go but\n\n353\n00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.590\nif I don't have an internet connection,\nI can't use the web browser.\n\n354\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.440\nWell, -ShowWindow, what does is it\ntakes my help documentation and\n\n355\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.980\nputs it in its own window.\n\n356\n00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.590\nAnd when you run that,\nnow we get this separate window, and\n\n357\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.050\nthere's my documentation right there.\n\n358\n00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.110\nI can take it.\n\n359\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.490\nMove it off to the side of my screen.\n\n360\n00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:54.100\nI can move my PowerShell over here\nwhich is not gonna snap, there we go.\n\n361\n00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.220\nSo I can move my PowerShell over here and\n\n362\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:01.170\nnow I can be looking at the documentation\nwhile I'm working with the command.\n\n363\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.920\nAnd the show window command, see how\nit automatically defaulted to full.\n\n364\n00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.120\nThey figure, hey if you're\ngonna be in a separate window,\n\n365\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.370\nyou might as well show\nthe full documentation.\n\n366\n00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.757\nAnd they give you this awesome find\nfeature right here at the top.\n\n367\n00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:16.237\nSo, when I pulled up the full,\nif I just wanna learn about excluded,\n\n368\n00:20:16.237 --> 00:20:20.137\nI can type it in and now it's gonna show\nme all the information for excluded and\n\n369\n00:20:20.137 --> 00:20:22.123\nI can scroll right through and find it.\n\n370\n00:20:22.123 --> 00:20:25.593\nThere's the syntax and\nthen I can jump down here and\n\n371\n00:20:25.593 --> 00:20:29.910\nI can see where they're using\nit in the example right here.\n\n372\n00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.540\nWe wanna restart services,\nany services starts with net and\n\n373\n00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.340\nwe wanna exclude net logoff, right?\n\n374\n00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:39.530\nSo I see that example, and now I can\ngo over here and start to type it.\n\n375\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.817\nSo -ShowWindow is a pretty\nneat one to have available.\n\n376\n00:20:44.169 --> 00:20:46.485\nAll right, that's a pretty neat one.\n\n377\n00:20:46.485 --> 00:20:50.910\nThere are a few other things that\nwe can do with the help system.\n\n378\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.027\nSo far we've been looking at get-help.\n\n379\n00:20:52.027 --> 00:20:55.928\nAnd I talked about update-help to\nmake sure we've got the help files.\n\n380\n00:20:55.928 --> 00:21:02.130\nAnd those are all pretty common, pretty\nstandard things that we need to have.\n\n381\n00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:09.260\nSome of the other things that we might\nwanna do, I did -full, we did -examples.\n\n382\n00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.718\nThere's -detailed.\n\n383\n00:21:10.718 --> 00:21:12.658\nAll right.\nNow, not every command has -detailed.\n\n384\n00:21:12.658 --> 00:21:15.075\nLet's see if restart service does.\n\n385\n00:21:15.075 --> 00:21:20.703\nSo I'm going to do get-help\nRestart-service-detailed.\n\n386\n00:21:20.703 --> 00:21:23.391\nAnd when I run that,\non many of the commands\n\n387\n00:21:23.391 --> 00:21:27.349\nit'll actually be the same as full but\non some of the commands,\n\n388\n00:21:27.349 --> 00:21:32.506\ndetailed will have some additional\ninformation that's useful for developers,\n\n389\n00:21:32.506 --> 00:21:37.685\npeople who are using API interfaces to be\nable to reach in and manage the commands.\n\n390\n00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:40.476\nOn this one, yeah, if you look at it here,\n\n391\n00:21:40.476 --> 00:21:45.599\nit's not really any different than the\nfull output on this one but if we browsed\n\n392\n00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:51.320\naround I'm sure we could stumble upon\na command sooner or later that had it.\n\n393\n00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:57.050\nBut basically the full usually\ngives us everything right here.\n\n394\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.350\nAll right, I think that's about it.\n\n395\n00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:03.390\nThere's one other thing that is kind\nof handy to mention on this one.\n\n396\n00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.540\nThere is an alias for get -help, but\n\n397\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.020\nit's a little bit different\nthan a normal alias.\n\n398\n00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.630\nNormally we do an alias.\n\n399\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.580\nWe create an alias as a name and\nthe name just ties to a commandlet and\n\n400\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.940\nthat's basically it.\n\n401\n00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.660\nWell, the alias in this case is help.\n\n402\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.230\nHelp is mapped to get -help.\n\n403\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.850\nSo, if I wanted help for this file I could\nactually use the help command to do it.\n\n404\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:26.960\nLet me show you.\n\n405\n00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.990\nSo, if I do get -help,\nlet me start at the start of the screen.\n\n406\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:37.280\nSo I'll do \"get-help\" for\n\"restart-service\".\n\n407\n00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.730\nWhen I run that, it was more information\nthan what fit on the screen so\n\n408\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.800\nit scrolled of the top but I got my help.\n\n409\n00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.040\nThat was the full version of the command.\n\n410\n00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.530\nWell, if I run help restart-service.\n\n411\n00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:56.460\nHelp is an alias of get -help, but\nwhen I run it, notice what it did.\n\n412\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.660\nIt puts the more command in by default.\n\n413\n00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:04.170\nWhen you use the help alias it\nautomatically applies a pipeline into\n\n414\n00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.880\nthe more command and now it's paginated.\n\n415\n00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.090\nAll right, so\nit's not like a normal alias.\n\n416\n00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.870\nA normal alias is just\na name to a commandlet, and\n\n417\n00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.130\nit doesn't modify the functionality\nof that commandlet at all.\n\n418\n00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.470\nIt's just a name being mapped but,\nin this case, it's a name being mapped and\n\n419\n00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.170\nit applies the more command.\n\n420\n00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.210\nSo, pretty handy if you can just\nwanna quickly view a help file,\n\n421\n00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.750\nyou can use that but\nthere's some limitations to it,\n\n422\n00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.930\nyou know, as far as it just\ndefaults to that base example.\n\n423\n00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.460\nIf I did -examples after it,\nit can jump in and\n\n424\n00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.480\nnow we've got that or we can do -full.\n\n425\n00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.240\nRight, so it still accepts those\ncommand line modifiers, and\n\n426\n00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.690\nit applies the more pagination for\nme, so that can be pretty handy.\n\n427\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:49.354\nSo take advantage of that alias,\nit's a pretty cool one.\n\n428\n00:23:49.354 --> 00:23:51.838\nAll right, but other than that,\nthat is about it.\n\n429\n00:23:51.838 --> 00:23:56.129\nThe only other things worth mentioning\nhere is that when you get-help One of\n\n430\n00:23:56.129 --> 00:23:58.757\nthe really handy things\nis Tab autocomplete.\n\n431\n00:23:58.757 --> 00:24:02.240\nWhen you start to type a command inside\nof the PowerShell, you can hit Tab and\n\n432\n00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.590\nit'll try and\nguess what command you were typing.\n\n433\n00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.195\nAnd if it guesses wrong,\nyou just keep hitting Tab over and\n\n434\n00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:08.749\nover again until it gets it right.\n\n435\n00:24:08.749 --> 00:24:13.187\nSo for example, earlier I tried\nto do Restart-Service DnsClient,\n\n436\n00:24:13.187 --> 00:24:17.775\nbut the name of, it was actually DnsCache,\nand if I didn't know that,\n\n437\n00:24:17.775 --> 00:24:21.770\nI could try and guess, I could try and\nstumble my way through.\n\n438\n00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:22.830\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n439\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:27.519\nSo, if I run Get-Help, and then, Get-Dns,\n\n440\n00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:31.050\nand I can't remember is it client?\n\n441\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:31.990\nIs it cash?\n\n442\n00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:37.309\nI can hit Tab and my Tab autocomplete\nis gonna try and guess the command.\n\n443\n00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.569\nAnd so, I'll see there is, DnsClient.\n\n444\n00:24:39.569 --> 00:24:41.330\nThere's DnsClientCache.\n\n445\n00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.930\nSo, it's got a couple of different\nones that it'll scroll through and\n\n446\n00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.130\nshow me those different options.\n\n447\n00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.890\nSo, you can use Tab autocomplete.\n\n448\n00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.010\nYou can also do things like wildcards.\n\n449\n00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:55.370\nIf you do Get-Help, Get-Dns*, it doesn't\ngive you the full help for everyone.\n\n450\n00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.750\nWell, not that you can see.\n\n451\n00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.487\nWhat it's actually doing is it's\nputting it in a table so that I can\n\n452\n00:25:00.487 --> 00:25:04.910\nsee each of the commands, and the help\nis actually being displayed over here.\n\n453\n00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.980\nIt's just in a table, so I don't know it.\n\n454\n00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:12.080\nIf I did this same command and I pipe\nthat into the format-list commandlet,\n\n455\n00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.010\nwhich you can abbreviate to fl if\nyou want but I'll do format-list.\n\n456\n00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.960\nWhen I run that,\nit's displaying the help file for\n\n457\n00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.320\nevery one of those commands in line.\n\n458\n00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.480\nAnd that may or\nmay not be what I actually want.\n\n459\n00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.140\nYou can actually cause a little bit of\ntrouble with that if you're not careful.\n\n460\n00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.780\nSo, not terribly useful, but\n\n461\n00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.110\nI'll use it sometimes to find the commands\njust to figure out what I'm looking for.\n\n462\n00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:40.530\nBut I'll usually use Get-Command to do it,\nbecause when you do Get-Help,\n\n463\n00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.460\nit's actually loading those help files.\n\n464\n00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.529\nDid you see the green bar\nthat flashed by on my screen?\n\n465\n00:25:44.529 --> 00:25:46.509\nIt was real fast, but it still did it.\n\n466\n00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:50.629\nIt had to query those help files,\nand that can take a little\n\n467\n00:25:50.629 --> 00:25:55.546\nwhile if you did an excessively\nlarge query, versus Get-Command.\n\n468\n00:25:55.546 --> 00:25:59.480\nAnd then here, I could do Get-Dns*, right?\n\n469\n00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.160\nWhen I run that, I didn't get that green\nbar flashing by, and that's cuz I wasn't\n\n470\n00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.750\nloading the help files,\nit was just pulling the command list.\n\n471\n00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.490\nSo, I usually use Get-Command instead\nof Get-Help to search for commands.\n\n472\n00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.850\nAll right.\n\n473\n00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.089\nOther than that, that's basically how\nwe can pull help from the PowerShell.\n\n474\n00:26:16.089 --> 00:26:16.849\nIt's really useful.\n\n475\n00:26:16.849 --> 00:26:19.778\nIt's nice to have that inline\ncommand help available for\n\n476\n00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:21.190\nus to be able to get to that.\n\n477\n00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.698\nMore often than not though, I like\nto rely on the TechNet pages because\n\n478\n00:26:23.698 --> 00:26:25.370\nthey've got a lot of\ngood information there.\n\n479\n00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.360\nIt's fully searchable, really handy.\n\n480\n00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.300\nThere's some good web\npages in the TechNet site\n\n481\n00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.580\nthat will give you all sorts of\nPowerShell examples and new scenarios.\n\n482\n00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.390\nDefinitely good stuff there.\n\n483\n00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.940\nBut, if you're in a hurry,\nif you don't have internet access,\n\n484\n00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.690\nthe help that's imbedded in the module,\nit's pretty handy.\n\n485\n00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.362\nYou should definitely use it.\n\n486\n00:26:42.362 --> 00:26:45.482\nAll right, well, that's about it for\nthe help documentation.\n\n487\n00:26:45.482 --> 00:26:46.523\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n488\n00:26:46.523 --> 00:26:47.521\nStay tuned.\n\n489\n00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:50.301\nWe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n490\n00:26:50.301 --> 00:26:54.640\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,135\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:12,755\nIn this segment we're gonna take a look at\npiping command output from one command to\n\n3\n00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:14,042\nanother.\n\n4\n00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:17,080\nIn PowerShell we have what's\ncalled the command pipeline.\n\n5\n00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,470\nAnd what that means is that when we run\na command we may want to do additional\n\n6\n00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,500\nthings with the output other\nthan just look at it, right?\n\n7\n00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,130\nThe traditional command pipeline that we\nhave is you run a command and something\n\n8\n00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,600\ngets displayed on the screen and you look\nat it with your eyeballs and that's it.\n\n9\n00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,420\nRight.\nThat's our command pipeline normally.\n\n10\n00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,110\nBut sometimes we want to take\nthe results of one command and\n\n11\n00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,090\nfeed it into another command.\n\n12\n00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,690\nSo the output from one command\nbecomes the input for another command.\n\n13\n00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,900\nAll right.\n\n14\n00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,430\nYou can use this for\na number of different things.\n\n15\n00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,990\nFor example, you might want to\nrestart certain services but\n\n16\n00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,030\nyou don't necessarily know\nwhat those services are.\n\n17\n00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,960\nSo you might use a Get-Service command,\nor something like that, to query for\n\n18\n00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,950\ncertain services, and it makes a list,\nand you take that output, and feed that\n\n19\n00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,440\nright back into the Restart-Service\ncommand, right, that commandlet.\n\n20\n00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,460\nAnd it takes the output\nfrom the first command,\n\n21\n00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,670\nuses it as input on the second command,\nand takes action on it.\n\n22\n00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,630\nAnd you can even pipeline\nseveral layers deep if you want.\n\n23\n00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,350\nNow a lot of us do this even\nwithout thinking about it, and\n\n24\n00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,120\nlet me give you an example.\n\n25\n00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,350\nActually, let me get into a PowerShell\nhere before I give you an example.\n\n26\n00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,330\nAll right, so\nif I take something like Get-Service.\n\n27\n00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,830\nRight?\n\n28\n00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,790\nWhen I run Get-Service,\nit gives me a list of all of the services.\n\n29\n00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,340\nAll right?\n\n30\n00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,230\nWell, there was more than\nwhat fit on my screen.\n\n31\n00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,050\nAnd, that can be a little excessive.\n\n32\n00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,280\nRight?\nIt's just way more.\n\n33\n00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,160\nI can scroll back and find things.\n\n34\n00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,170\nBut, I might want to add\npagination to that, right?\n\n35\n00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,350\nPagination, that just\nmeans every 24 lines,\n\n36\n00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,030\nput in a stop that says\nPress any key to continue.\n\n37\n00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,520\nAnd the easiest way to do that is to\ntake the output from Get-Service,\n\n38\n00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,169\nand feed that into another command,\nthe more commandlet.\n\n39\n00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:14,040\nAll right?\nAnd more is a built in part of the system.\n\n40\n00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,940\nSee how it's not an alias for anything.\n\n41\n00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,450\nMore is a command that's been\na part of Windows and DOS forever.\n\n42\n00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,500\nAnd it just adds that\npagination to a screen.\n\n43\n00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,360\nSo if I wanna use it,\nI can say Get-Service, and\n\n44\n00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,375\nthen I can use the | symbol.\n\n45\n00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:35,010\nNow the | symbol, it's a little weird\nthe way that it's rendered on the screen.\n\n46\n00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,140\nIt's actually two vertical lines,\none on top of the other.\n\n47\n00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,320\nWhen you look on screen, it looks like one\nvertical line, but it is actually two.\n\n48\n00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,700\nAnd if you look on your keyboard,\nit's typically two.\n\n49\n00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,200\nAnd you know I say that as I look at my\nkeyboard where it's a solid, single one.\n\n50\n00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,575\nOn a normal, 110-key or\n\n51\n00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:57,650\n104-key Windows keyboard it'll be two\nvertical lines, one on top of the other.\n\n52\n00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,710\nAnd it's typically located right\nabove your Enter key, or Return.\n\n53\n00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,870\nIt'll be right above that or\nright beneath your Backspace key.\n\n54\n00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,920\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n55\n00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,850\nYour keyboard might\nhave it somewhere else.\n\n56\n00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,080\nBut it's usually there and\nit's usually the backslash key too.\n\n57\n00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,320\nSo you have to hold Shift to\nget it to get that pipe symbol.\n\n58\n00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,180\nBut all the pipe symbol says\nis it's telling PowerShell,\n\n59\n00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,460\nas of this symbol,\neverything to the left is one command.\n\n60\n00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,200\nRun it.\n\n61\n00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,610\nRun it, and instead of displaying\nthe output on the screen,\n\n62\n00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:35,030\nfeed the output as input into whatever I\ntype on the other side of this pipe symbol\n\n63\n00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,340\nand then from there, take that output and\ndisplay that on the screen.\n\n64\n00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,342\nAnd the more command is one of\nthe most simple versions of that.\n\n65\n00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:47,070\nI'm gonna take the output\nof get dash service, and\n\n66\n00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,470\nI will pipe that into the more command.\n\n67\n00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,820\nWhen I run that, I get the same output\nI had a minute ago, but there's my\n\n68\n00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,600\nmore prompt, and I can press a key and\nI can advance at my leisure, all right?\n\n69\n00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,340\nNow, that one's not too\nterribly spectacular,\n\n70\n00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,350\nthere's other ones that\nare a little more impressive.\n\n71\n00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,220\nOne of my problems here with Get-Service\nis that it displays a lot of stuff, right?\n\n72\n00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,910\nAnd I see these three columns,\nstatus, name, display name.\n\n73\n00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,437\nBut there's actually more [COUGH],\nexcuse me,\n\n74\n00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:21,210\nmore to each of those services than\nwhat's being displayed on the screen.\n\n75\n00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,170\nSo what if I wanna see that other stuff?\n\n76\n00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,750\nWell, there's another command\ncalled Format-List that will help\n\n77\n00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,300\nme see that other stuff.\n\n78\n00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,638\nAnd so, I can pipe the output\nof Get-Service into Format-List.\n\n79\n00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:38,949\nBut the output for Format-List,\n\n80\n00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,020\n[COUGH] it's gonna be even longer\nthan what I originally had.\n\n81\n00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,662\nSo, I might want to pipe that\ninto another command too.\n\n82\n00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:50,410\nI might wanna pipe that more.\n\n83\n00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,020\nNow, I'm doing three stages.\n\n84\n00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,990\nCommand one, the output becomes input for\ncommand two.\n\n85\n00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,510\nCommand two runs, and the output for\ncommand two becomes the input for\n\n86\n00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,420\ncommand three.\n\n87\n00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,950\nYou can pipeline as\nmany times as you want.\n\n88\n00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,520\nAll right, these are nested commands.\n\n89\n00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,410\nTheir gonna run one after the other,\n\n90\n00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,810\neach one building off of\nthe output of the previous one.\n\n91\n00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,310\nSo, pretty important process here cuz we\ncan really use this to create some power.\n\n92\n00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,480\nAnd when I run this, well, actually,\nlet me run it without the more command.\n\n93\n00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,268\nI'll just run it like this.\n\n94\n00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:21,400\nGet-Service | Format-List.\n\n95\n00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,970\nAnd when I run it,\nthat's a lot of information.\n\n96\n00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,370\nI see the additional columns that I\ncouldn't see in the table a minute ago.\n\n97\n00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,170\nSure, I get Name, DisplayName, and\nStatus, but now I see DependentServices,\n\n98\n00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,450\nServiceDescription, CanPause,\nCanShutdown, CanStop, and ServiceType.\n\n99\n00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,640\nA lot of additional stuff.\n\n100\n00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,790\nAnd if I pipe that into the more command.\n\n101\n00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,430\nNow, it's the same output but\npaginated, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,020\nSo three commands involved in this.\n\n103\n00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,810\nThat's the glory of pipelining, right?\n\n104\n00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,370\nYou can pipeline over and over and\n\n105\n00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,440\nover again to create all sorts of\ninteresting output that matches your needs\n\n106\n00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,140\nthat may be very different than the output\nthat Microsoft normally gives you.\n\n107\n00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,070\nWe're going to do another segment later on\nwhere we'll talk about different ways to\n\n108\n00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,220\nformat output.\n\n109\n00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,390\nBut for right now I'm just using this to\nkind of demonstrate the different ways\n\n110\n00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,930\nthat we can feed the output\nof one command into another.\n\n111\n00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,160\nAll right.\n\n112\n00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,800\nSo that's a pretty basic\nexample of pipelining.\n\n113\n00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,180\nBut, I didn't really do anything\nwith the data that I got.\n\n114\n00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,080\nI ran a query, Get-Service,\ngive me all the services.\n\n115\n00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,860\nBut then, all I really did was\nchange the format of the output.\n\n116\n00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,110\nThat's not too fun.\n\n117\n00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,800\nBut you can actually take\nactions based on various things.\n\n118\n00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,930\nSo, for example, if I want to restart\nevery service that has to deal with dns.\n\n119\n00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,580\nAll right.\n\n120\n00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,480\nWell let me show you how we can do that.\n\n121\n00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:49,500\nIf I take Get-Service and\nI do *dns*, right?\n\n122\n00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,980\nIt's gonna show me every service\nthat has to do with dns.\n\n123\n00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,410\nWell, guess I picked a lame example\nwhere there's only one of those.\n\n124\n00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,880\n[LAUGH] So\nsome of them will have multiple services.\n\n125\n00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,520\nThis one just has one.\n\n126\n00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,600\nWhat would be a better one to pick?\n\n127\n00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,530\nI don't want to do RPC.\n\n128\n00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,960\nThat would be bad.\n\n129\n00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,940\nLet's just take a look at our screen here,\nsee if I can spot something.\n\n130\n00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,030\nI could do my virtual machine stuff.\n\n131\n00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,620\nI could do Windows Update stuff,\nthat could be fun.\n\n132\n00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,470\nSee how much trouble we can\ncause with Windows Update?\n\n133\n00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,660\nSo let me do a Get-Service for wu*.\n\n134\n00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,220\nThere, all right?\n\n135\n00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,230\nSo I've got two services, and they're both\nstopped, so that's not terribly exciting.\n\n136\n00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,170\nBut they're right there,\nand I can see these.\n\n137\n00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,260\nAnd I guess one of them's Windows Update.\n\n138\n00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,960\nThe other one is actually the user driver.\n\n139\n00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,520\nWell, whatever.\n\n140\n00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,430\nIt'll work for my example.\n\n141\n00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,240\nSo if I wanna restart both of those,\nwell I could take this output and\n\n142\n00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,089\nI could feed that into\nthe Restart-Service commandlet.\n\n143\n00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:46,974\nRight?\n\n144\n00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:50,600\nNow not every commandlet works with this.\n\n145\n00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,910\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\n146\n00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,140\nThe output, here is a table.\n\n147\n00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,550\nIt's a table listing all of\nthe services that matched my query.\n\n148\n00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,110\nWell Restart-Service may or\n\n149\n00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,820\nmay not be set up to receive\na table as its input, all right?\n\n150\n00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,538\nDoesn't hurt to try.\nWe can give it a shot, but\n\n151\n00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:11,570\nif you get an error like I just did,\nwell that's what's telling me, hey,\n\n152\n00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,690\nI'm not set up to receive it like that.\n\n153\n00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,950\nI can't handle restarting more\nthan one service at the same time.\n\n154\n00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,350\nAll right.\n\n155\n00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,700\nWhen that happens,\nit doesn't mean that you can't pipeline,\n\n156\n00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,320\nit just means you have to do it\na slightly different way, all right?\n\n157\n00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,440\nSometimes, this'll work just fine, right?\n\n158\n00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,620\nThe command, your second command will\nsupport receiving a matrix or receiving\n\n159\n00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,470\na table in and it'll act on it and it will\nrestart you to the services or whatever.\n\n160\n00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,430\nBut other times, you get errors like this.\n\n161\n00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:45,660\nAnd we just have to modify our pipeline\nprocedure a little bit, to say take\n\n162\n00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,160\neach individual line of our\nfirst command's output and\n\n163\n00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,430\nfeed it into the second\ncommand one at a time.\n\n164\n00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,990\nIn other words,\nrun that second command once for\n\n165\n00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,760\nevery single line of that\nfirst command's output.\n\n166\n00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,860\nThis is a little bit more advanced, but\n\n167\n00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,380\nit's something that\nyou'll commonly run into.\n\n168\n00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,970\nSo if you get a bunch of error, like this.\n\n169\n00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,030\nActually, here looking at my errors, my\nerrors are actually tied more to the fact\n\n170\n00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,280\nthat I tried to stop services\nthat were already stopped.\n\n171\n00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,208\nSo let's try something valid here.\n\n172\n00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:18,610\nI'm just gonna stay start service cuz\nthey're both started, or, both stopped.\n\n173\n00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,360\nSo if I do start, oh,\nI got an error there.\n\n174\n00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,010\nCannot be started due\nto the following error,\n\n175\n00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,880\nservice controller error, and, am I, oh.\n\n176\n00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,640\nI'm not an administrator.\n\n177\n00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,870\nThat'll probably be my problem there.\n\n178\n00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,760\nSo let me jump over to a PowerShell\nwhere I'm running it as an admin,\n\n179\n00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,230\nand we'll see if that works for\nus a little bit better here.\n\n180\n00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,990\nAnd we'll find out here in a moment\nwhether or not that worked for us.\n\n181\n00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,810\nSo, there we go, Start-Service was\nperfectly happy receiving that table and\n\n182\n00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,530\nit dealt with it.\n\n183\n00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,180\nRight?\n\n184\n00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,425\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and stop those,\n\n185\n00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,775\ncuz I just don't need them\nrunning during the show.\n\n186\n00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:55,785\nBut there we go.\n\n187\n00:09:55,785 --> 00:10:00,395\nIt's handling that table,\neven though it wouldn't normally do that.\n\n188\n00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:04,815\nNow if I have a command that just\noutright won't deal with the table.\n\n189\n00:10:04,815 --> 00:10:06,145\nI know this one got happy again, but\n\n190\n00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:10,305\nif it won't deal with the able, then I've\ngotta do what I was saying a minute ago.\n\n191\n00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:13,935\nRun that second command one at at time,\nover and over again, and\n\n192\n00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:15,330\nlet it do its job.\n\n193\n00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,170\nFor that we have to use another command,\nand then here is where we start to\n\n194\n00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,760\nget into a little bit of stuff that\na developer would normally work with.\n\n195\n00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,890\nWe have to create what is called a foreach\nloop and a foreach loop just says for\n\n196\n00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,020\neach line in our original output do this\ncommand and you're gonna loop through it\n\n197\n00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,180\nover and over and over again until you run\nout of lines to run and then you'll stop.\n\n198\n00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,270\nAll right.\n\n199\n00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,030\nSo, we just have to modify how that works.\n\n200\n00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:46,860\nAs an example, let's see,\nwhat would be a good example for this?\n\n201\n00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,595\nLet's see.\n\n202\n00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:48,916\nGet-process.\n\n203\n00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:54,100\nAll right, Get-Process will return to me\n\n204\n00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,760\na list of all the processes running\non my computer right now, okay.\n\n205\n00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,530\nSo there's all the processes.\n\n206\n00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,679\nBut it returns kind of\na lot of information.\n\n207\n00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,620\nSo, I see not just the processes,\nlike a process name.\n\n208\n00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,290\nI also see their IDs, I can see their\nvirtual memory, their CPU utilization.\n\n209\n00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,750\nI see tons of information about them,\nnot just a name.\n\n210\n00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,460\nWell maybe I do just want the name,\nand that's all I want.\n\n211\n00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,450\nWell, we'll learn some filter\ncommands that make that really easy.\n\n212\n00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,877\nBut there's another way\nthat I can pull it.\n\n213\n00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,430\nWhen you run Get-Process, that command\nruns, and this output comes out.\n\n214\n00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,830\nWe don't see it, but the output\nis actually stored in a variable.\n\n215\n00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,320\nSo PowerShell creates a variable\nautomatically and it's called $_.\n\n216\n00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,650\nIt's a temporary variable that's\nonly around while this command runs.\n\n217\n00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,350\nAnd when we take the output for\nour command, and we feed it into\n\n218\n00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,270\nthe next command, the next command's\nreally just looking for that variable.\n\n219\n00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,890\nIt's saying hey,\nis there anything in $_ underscore?\n\n220\n00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,030\nAnd if there is, that's the data\nthat I'm using as my input.\n\n221\n00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,680\nSo that's kinda what\nhappens in the background.\n\n222\n00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,260\nWe don't normally see it.\n\n223\n00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:06,040\nWell if I wanna pull just the names that\nare out of this list, well I could try it.\n\n224\n00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,570\nI could say Get-Process and\nI could pipe that into Write-Host,\n\n225\n00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,070\nwhich is a commandlet that displays\nthings on your screen, and\n\n226\n00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,320\nI could say $_ .name.\n\n227\n00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,139\nSo I'm saying write on my screen\nthe name value from inside of $_,\n\n228\n00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:32,780\nthat variable that's storing all\nthe data from my first command.\n\n229\n00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,280\nSo whenever you see that $_ it's almost\nalways used in a pipeline because it's\n\n230\n00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,870\nreferencing the output\nfrom the previous command.\n\n231\n00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,938\nNow, this is syntactically correct, but\n\n232\n00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:50,275\nthe problem here is Get-Process\nis gonna return a ton of entries.\n\n233\n00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:54,540\nBut Write-Host is expecting one thing.\n\n234\n00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,790\nIt's expecting a single string.\n\n235\n00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,060\nI'm about to give it a table.\n\n236\n00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,110\nIt's gonna get really upset about that.\n\n237\n00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,250\nAnd we do $_, that's referring\nto the whole table and the name.\n\n238\n00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,280\nWell, there's a name for\nall these different processes so\n\n239\n00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,120\nit's not gonna be too happy\nabout that when I run it.\n\n240\n00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,220\nHere, let's actually run it.\n\n241\n00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,450\nWhoops!\n\n242\n00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,890\nWell, shoot, that wasn't fair.\n\n243\n00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,300\nLet me [LAUGH] so I do it a second time.\n\n244\n00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,159\nLet me do this again.\n\n245\n00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,190\nI added an extra slash there by accident\nso let me just get that out of there.\n\n246\n00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,050\nThere we go.\n\n247\n00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,180\nSo if I run that, I get a ton of errors.\n\n248\n00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,880\nWhy am I getting a bunch of errors?\n\n249\n00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,220\nWell, the reason is it's trying\nto run this table of data,\n\n250\n00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,260\nwhich it's not set up to deal with.\n\n251\n00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,550\nAnd so, that's where it just gets\nreally upset and it lists it here.\n\n252\n00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,562\nAnd, if we read the actual error,\nyou can see right here,\n\n253\n00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:46,100\nWrite-Host : The input object cannot\nbe bound to any parameters for\n\n254\n00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,580\nthe command either because the command\ndoes not take pipeline input or\n\n255\n00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,400\nthe input and its properties do not match\nthe parameters to take pipeline input.\n\n256\n00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,760\nIt failed with a pipeline input.\n\n257\n00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,100\nSo here's where we can implement one of\nthese loops that I was talking about.\n\n258\n00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,418\nSo to fix this one, what we would\ndo is modify it a little bit.\n\n259\n00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:09,680\nInstead of Get-Process and\n\n260\n00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,880\nthen going right into Write-Host,\nI'm gonna bring in another command.\n\n261\n00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,250\nI'm gonna put in Foreach, whoops,\nI'm gonna spell for right.\n\n262\n00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,580\nThat'll be the start of success here.\n\n263\n00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,469\nSo ForEach-Object and\nthen in parenthesis or\n\n264\n00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:33,811\nsquiggly parenthesis I'm\ngonna say Write-Host\n\n265\n00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:38,800\n$_ .name and then I'll close that.\n\n266\n00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,400\nOkay.\n\n267\n00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,750\nOh, I lost my -Object.\n\n268\n00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,900\nLet me go fix that.\n\n269\n00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,070\nApparently I hit something\non the keyboard there.\n\n270\n00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,170\nThere we go.\n\n271\n00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,760\nSo what this is gonna say\nis the original command\n\n272\n00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,430\nis gonna output more\nthan one line of data.\n\n273\n00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,320\nI'm gonna have more than one entry.\n\n274\n00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,935\nSo, instead of running Write-Host\nagainst the whole thing,\n\n275\n00:14:56,935 --> 00:15:02,950\nForEach-Object, for each line in\nthe original output, run Write-Host once.\n\n276\n00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,760\nSo, if I've got 50 processes running, it's\ngonna run the Write-Host command 50 times,\n\n277\n00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,280\none for each line of the original output.\n\n278\n00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,800\nBut the cool thing here is that Write-Host\ndoesn't support multiline input,\n\n279\n00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,160\nnow it's getting it one at a time,\nit'll be perfectly happy.\n\n280\n00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,790\nAnd so when I run that,\nI get the names of my processes.\n\n281\n00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,660\nIt ran successfully, no errors,\nand there we go, right?\n\n282\n00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,690\nSo slight variation of what we ran before,\nright?\n\n283\n00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,958\nSo if we take a look at the two commands,\n\n284\n00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,580\nthere was Get-Process which I\npipelined into Write-Host and\n\n285\n00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,690\nI used that $_ variable to\nspecify that input that I wanted.\n\n286\n00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,465\nAnd the only reason I had to do that\ncuz I could have let that off, but\n\n287\n00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:50,460\nWrite-Host would have just written\nexactly what Get-Process outputted,\n\n288\n00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,430\nit would have been pointless, right?\n\n289\n00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,810\nBut I did the .name.\n\n290\n00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,640\nI was telling it I wanted\nthat property specifically.\n\n291\n00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,150\nI didn't want all the other properties.\n\n292\n00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,590\nSo that's why I had to do the $_.\n\n293\n00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,640\nBut that's the one that\ngenerated an error.\n\n294\n00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,940\nWhen I added the foreach loop in there,\nor ForEach-Object, that's\n\n295\n00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,220\nwhat gave me the ability to run it one at\na time, and the command was successful.\n\n296\n00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,390\nSo just slight variation\nof the command to do it.\n\n297\n00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,940\nSo pretty useful thing when\nit comes to pipelining.\n\n298\n00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,080\nYou'll find that most of the commands\nthat you have do support pipelining.\n\n299\n00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,220\nAnd you'll see it in\nthe help documentation.\n\n300\n00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,930\nIf I pull up the get-help, for\nlet's say, Restart-Service,\n\n301\n00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,110\nand I'm gonna pull up the full,\nwhen we go in here and\n\n302\n00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,240\nwe start to read some of the different\ninformation that it's providing us.\n\n303\n00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,000\nAs you scroll through and see all these\nparameters, down here under inputs, right?\n\n304\n00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,710\nHow do you feed input to it?\n\n305\n00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,160\nMost of the time you'll see system string.\n\n306\n00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,910\nThat's us feeding input to it.\n\n307\n00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,410\nBut you'll also see this.\n\n308\n00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,480\nYou can pipe a service object or\na string that contains objects into it.\n\n309\n00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,800\nSo it's letting us know that you can\npipeline things in for this command.\n\n310\n00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,360\nNot every command has that, some of\nthem don't support pipelining input.\n\n311\n00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,730\nBut you'll find the majority of them do.\n\n312\n00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,730\nAll right, so\n\n313\n00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,690\nas far as our command pipeline, those are\nbasically the things we need to remember.\n\n314\n00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,400\nFirst off that you can pipeline as\nmany commands in chain as you want.\n\n315\n00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,770\nEventually it gets really confusing and\noverwhelming.\n\n316\n00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,030\nSo I find that I don't normally\ngo beyond like four or five.\n\n317\n00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,480\nBut you can keep going.\n\n318\n00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,540\nI'm not even sure if\nthere is an actual limit.\n\n319\n00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,530\nI've seen some pretty crazy examples.\n\n320\n00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,607\nBut you just keep putting that\npipeline character, the pipe,\n\n321\n00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,743\nthat two vertical bar symbol in\nbetween each of your commands and\n\n322\n00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,437\njust the output for\none becomes the input for the next.\n\n323\n00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:34,907\nAnd it creates a chain reaction\nuntil it gets to the last one and\n\n324\n00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:37,660\nthat's when it displays\noutput on your screen.\n\n325\n00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,870\nAll right.\nNow we're gonna see that pipeline through\n\n326\n00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,930\ntons of other segments as we\ngo through PowerShell because\n\n327\n00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,840\nyou can really use it to manipulate\nyour data and create some cool stuff.\n\n328\n00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,140\nBut as far as this one,\nthat's about it right there.\n\n329\n00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,280\nSo in this episode we got a chance\nto see how to use the pipeline.\n\n330\n00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,290\nWe got to see how to use the $_ variable\nand we got to see a little quirk with\n\n331\n00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,250\nsome commands where they don't\nsupport multiline input.\n\n332\n00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,835\nAnd so we saw the ForEach-Object\ncommandlet that can correct that for\n\n333\n00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,964\nus, allowing us to run that command over\nand over and over again to compensate for\n\n334\n00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:11,954\nmultiline input.\n\n335\n00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:13,416\nSo good stuff.\n\n336\n00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,037\nDefinitely something you'll end\nup using in the real world.\n\n337\n00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:20,690\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment, stay\ntuned, we got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n338\n00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:27,239\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,630\n[SOUND] In this segment, we're gonna take\n\n2\n00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,251\na look at some of the ways\nthat we can modify\n\n3\n00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:14,683\nthe format of the command\noutput in PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:14,683 --> 00:00:18,244\nA lot of times you'll find that the way\nthe output is given to you on the screen\n\n5\n00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:19,468\nIt is not the most useful,\n\n6\n00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:23,470\nor just isn't in a format that's useful\nin the way that you intend it to be.\n\n7\n00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,050\nMicrosoft can't anticipate everybody's\nuse-case scenario, so they try and\n\n8\n00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,080\ncreate something that's\npractical in most environments.\n\n9\n00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,940\nBut oftentimes you'll need to modify it.\n\n10\n00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,980\nFortunately they give us a collection\nof tools that let us do that.\n\n11\n00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,810\nAnd, I'm gonna show you those right now.\n\n12\n00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:43,420\nSo the, first one that I want to talk\nabout is one that I use quite a bit.\n\n13\n00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,330\nWhen we run most commands they'll\ngive you output in a table format.\n\n14\n00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,680\nThe only problem is you can't really fit\nall that much on a normal computer screen.\n\n15\n00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,860\nSo, when it displays that\ntable there's usually some\n\n16\n00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,820\npieces that are missing from it.\n\n17\n00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,350\nSo, you don't see all\nthe information that you want.\n\n18\n00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,950\nLet me show you an example.\n\n19\n00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,882\nSo here on my PowerShell if I run\nget-service It's gonna pull up a list of\n\n20\n00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:08,558\nthe services on my computer and\n\n21\n00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:13,270\nI'm just gonna pipe that in to the more\ncommand here so it won't go too crazy.\n\n22\n00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,170\nBut you'll see it's giving me the status,\nthe name and the display name.\n\n23\n00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,640\nAnd that's it.\n\n24\n00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,519\nSo I'm just getting three columns\nin this table as it's arranged.\n\n25\n00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,310\nBut there's other columns\nthat are available.\n\n26\n00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,620\nThere's more data that it just didn't\nhave room on the screen to put in, right?\n\n27\n00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,100\nAnd there's even data that it did\ngive me that it didn't have room for.\n\n28\n00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,320\nSee all these guys that have an ellipses\nafter the end of them, the three dots,\n\n29\n00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,870\nthat lets me know that it had to\ntruncate that to fit it on the screen.\n\n30\n00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,850\nSo the default listing format\nmay not be perfect, right?\n\n31\n00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,940\nMicrosoft tried to find something that\nwas a good balance for most users, but\n\n32\n00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,930\nif we want that additional information,\nwe might want to change it.\n\n33\n00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,650\nSo when you run a command,\n\n34\n00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,480\nit's actually being fed through another\ncommandlet called format-table, and\n\n35\n00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,220\nthat's whats taking the output from your\nfirst command and making it into a table.\n\n36\n00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,010\nInstead of that what we\ncan do is we can take that\n\n37\n00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:14,970\ncommand and\nwe can pipe it into format dash list.\n\n38\n00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,660\nThat's another variation.\n\n39\n00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,330\nSo the default is format dash table,\nthis is gonna be format dash list.\n\n40\n00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,310\nNow it's gonna display those\nproperties one after another.\n\n41\n00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,430\nAnd you'll be able to\nsee them all all right.\n\n42\n00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,690\nWhen I run that, I still get name,\nI still get status right.\n\n43\n00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,570\nSo I still see some of those.\n\n44\n00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,560\nBut I also see the full display name,\n\n45\n00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,180\ndependencies, the services we depend on,\nand that depend on us.\n\n46\n00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,300\nWe see whether we can pause,\nwhether we can shut down, so\n\n47\n00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,590\nI'm seeing more information.\n\n48\n00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,920\nAnd it's got more room on\nthe screen to list it,\n\n49\n00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,100\nbecause it's being written out\none property per line, right?\n\n50\n00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,400\nSo this gives us a lot more visibility\ninto what we're looking for.\n\n51\n00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,790\nAnd we see that full set of data.\n\n52\n00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,720\nSo that's a pretty handy way to go about\ndoing that, is just switching from\n\n53\n00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,240\nthe default of format dash\ntable over to format dash list.\n\n54\n00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,120\nNow, that default,\nlet's talk about that just a little bit.\n\n55\n00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,320\nIf I run get dash service, and\nI just run it by itself, right?\n\n56\n00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,980\nWell, I see it as a table.\n\n57\n00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,235\nIf I take that same command,\nand I pipe that into\n\n58\n00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:31,830\nFormat-Table, right,\nwhen I run that I get the same data.\n\n59\n00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,470\nBy default,\nyou're being fed through Format-Table, so\n\n60\n00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,210\nyou don't have to specify that one.\n\n61\n00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,990\nSo you might ask yourself if\nwe never have to specify it,\n\n62\n00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,160\nwhy do Microsoft even bother\nputting the command in there.\n\n63\n00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,080\nWhy would I need Format-Table\nif that's the default, right?\n\n64\n00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,010\nWell the reason is Format-Table actually\ntakes some modifiers, all right.\n\n65\n00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,650\nIf we pull up the help for it.\n\n66\n00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,316\nI do Get-Help Format-Table.\n\n67\n00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,540\nYou can see in here that it\ntakes inputs of properties.\n\n68\n00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,640\nThat we can actually tell it, hey for\nthis property, I want you to autosize.\n\n69\n00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,950\nOr for this property,\nI want you to set a certain width,\n\n70\n00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,920\nyou can set all sorts of customizations\nbased on the properties.\n\n71\n00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,280\nYou can change their names, you can do\nall sorts of crazy things if you want\n\n72\n00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,560\nbased on the information you want to get.\n\n73\n00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,060\nSo you can construct\nthe table differently.\n\n74\n00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,240\nThe way I use this most commonly is\nsimply to select the columns that I want.\n\n75\n00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,660\nI don't necessarily wanna\nget all the columns.\n\n76\n00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,410\nThere's a few that I'm looking for\nand those are the ones that I need.\n\n77\n00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,110\nI don't mind a table format as long as I\ncan read the data that I'm looking for.\n\n78\n00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:43,100\nSo, an example that might\nbe like Get-Service And\n\n79\n00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,142\nI might pipe that into Format-Table,\nwhich for\n\n80\n00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:50,900\nall intents and purposes it already does,\nbut now I'm gonna add on to that.\n\n81\n00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,130\nAnd I'm gonna say Name, ServiceType,\n\n82\n00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,130\nand Canshutdown.\n\n83\n00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,620\nAll right?\n\n84\n00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,300\nI want it to tell me\njust those three things.\n\n85\n00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,250\nThe default is that it's gonna show me the\nstatus, the name, and the service type.\n\n86\n00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,050\nBut I wanna see Names,\nServiceType, and Canshutdown.\n\n87\n00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,430\nAnd so\nwhen I run that now I get a table but\n\n88\n00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,040\nit's showing me the data that I wanted.\n\n89\n00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,030\nThere's the name.\n\n90\n00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,150\nThere's the service type.\n\n91\n00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,920\nThere's Canshutdown.\n\n92\n00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,960\nAll right?\n\n93\n00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,950\nI see them all and\n\n94\n00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,950\nmy screen is wide enough that it's\nactually spread this out a good bit.\n\n95\n00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,680\nIf I adjusted that, it would change it.\n\n96\n00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,240\nI've got my width, I think,\nset at 110 characters right now, so\n\n97\n00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,660\nthat's why it's so wide.\n\n98\n00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,810\nBut on a normal command prompt,\nI think it defaults to 80, so\n\n99\n00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,510\nthis would be a lot more narrow.\n\n100\n00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,300\nBut basically laying it out, and\nnow I get the information I want.\n\n101\n00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,750\nSo that's why we have Format-Table.\n\n102\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,920\nReal easy way to go through and\npick just the data I want.\n\n103\n00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,250\nNow I don't have to convert to a list.\n\n104\n00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,790\nBecause a list it's really easy to scan\nover a table and find the information you\n\n105\n00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,430\nwant, but the list,\nyou've gotta go through pages of data.\n\n106\n00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,170\nThat to find stuff.\n\n107\n00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,960\nSo it doesn't really make it\nvery useful for you right?\n\n108\n00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,450\nIt can be challenging to work\nwith that kind of output.\n\n109\n00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,170\nSo those are some examples right there of\nhow we can use that to find the different\n\n110\n00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,080\ndata that we're looking for.\n\n111\n00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,160\nThere's a few other things that we can do.\n\n112\n00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,620\nLike what if I don't know\nwhat these column names are?\n\n113\n00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,110\nWell, when I ran the command originally,\n\n114\n00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,420\nwhen I did Get-Service,\nI always saw these three columns.\n\n115\n00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,660\nSo, I don't even necessarily\nknow that there's other columns.\n\n116\n00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,030\nI might assume that there are, right?\n\n117\n00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,360\nBut, I don't really know.\n\n118\n00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,440\nAnd when I ran Get-Service and I piped\nit into Format-List, well, there, sure.\n\n119\n00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,460\nI saw each of the column names but\nyou don't have to use Get-Service.\n\n120\n00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,750\nYou don't have to use the actual\ncommand to find those column names.\n\n121\n00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,316\nYou can actually find it using\nanother command called Get-Member.\n\n122\n00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:55,050\nGet-Member will let you know what\nall of those properties are.\n\n123\n00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,390\nInside of Powershell,\nwhen you get output like this,\n\n124\n00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,330\nit's almost always a property and\nits associated value, right?\n\n125\n00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,560\nSo, the property names,\nthese are like the columns in your table.\n\n126\n00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,390\nAnd so I could go in and\nI could say Get-Service and\n\n127\n00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,030\npipe that into Get-Member,\nlike that, and when you run it,\n\n128\n00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,570\nit's gonna show me all the different\nthings that are inside of it.\n\n129\n00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,060\nAnd there's name.\n\n130\n00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,260\nAnd you'll see some of the other ones\nare in here too Canshutdown, and so on.\n\n131\n00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,920\nAnd there's even more that\nare tucked away in here.\n\n132\n00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,160\nWell, a lot of these are methods and\n\n133\n00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,270\nwe can't really do a whole heck\nof a lot with the methods.\n\n134\n00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,030\nThose are for being called programmatic.\n\n135\n00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,130\nThey're sort of like a function but\na little more powerful, but\n\n136\n00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,390\nthe alias properties right here, and\nthe actual properties right here.\n\n137\n00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,300\nThose are the ones that we can work with.\n\n138\n00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,880\nAnd so we can see all these different\nproperties that are available and\n\n139\n00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,980\nwhere they are coming from.\n\n140\n00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,220\nHow it is actually deriving that data.\n\n141\n00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,170\nSo Get-Member is a way to see that.\n\n142\n00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,530\nFor most of us, we don't need that.\n\n143\n00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,256\nWe don't need to go that in depth.\n\n144\n00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:02,462\nYou can just do format list, and find\nthem right there, and then go through and\n\n145\n00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:03,944\nprovide the ones you want.\n\n146\n00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:05,940\nBut this is an easy way to do that.\n\n147\n00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,004\nAnd we get it without having to deal with\npage after page of services being listed.\n\n148\n00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:14,700\nHere it's just telling me what\nthat command would output.\n\n149\n00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,360\nAll right,\na couple other things that we can do.\n\n150\n00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,321\nWith Format-Table, I showed you there were\na lot of different options in there for\n\n151\n00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:23,750\nmodifying things.\n\n152\n00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,136\nAnother neat one is Format-Wide.\n\n153\n00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:31,610\nSo, Format-Table and Format-List,\nwe use those all the time.\n\n154\n00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,210\nBut, Format-Wide is a weird one.\n\n155\n00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,560\nWhen you run that, what it does\nis it stretches out the width of\n\n156\n00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,240\nevery column to ensure that\nno characters get truncated.\n\n157\n00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,460\nSo, the longest value in a particular\ncolumn will determine the width,\n\n158\n00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,570\nit's auto sized by default.\n\n159\n00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,400\nSo Format-Wide just\neliminates truncated data.\n\n160\n00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,722\nAnd if I run that I'll find output\nthat's normally pretty useless,\n\n161\n00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:58,550\n[LAUGH] in my opinion.\n\n162\n00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,470\nBut, so it's giving me this wide\nformatting in laying things out.\n\n163\n00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,420\nAnd so I'm starting to see the names and\nI've got enough room\n\n164\n00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,640\non my screen that what it's actually\ndoing is listing my services.\n\n165\n00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,200\nAnd I'll have a name here,\nand another name here,\n\n166\n00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,650\nthat's two different\nservices on the same line.\n\n167\n00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,270\nAnd an app ID service, an app info,\nand it's going through and\n\n168\n00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,970\nlaying them out in a wide format,\nwhich in this case is two columns.\n\n169\n00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,280\nSome commands if the data is small\nenough it might be three columns.\n\n170\n00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,630\nSo you may see other variations of\nthis where it lays it out differently.\n\n171\n00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,730\nSo if I do like Get-Command.\n\n172\n00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,740\nRight, that's the one that lists all\nthe different power shell commands that\n\n173\n00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,385\nare available.\n\n174\n00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:43,325\nAnd if I type that into Format-Wide.\n\n175\n00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:47,423\nWhen I do that now it's displaying,\nwell let's go in two columns also, so\n\n176\n00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:50,720\nhere I'm seeing the commands one per line,\nright?\n\n177\n00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,288\nFormat-Wide though does take a lot of\nmodifiers so if we do Get-Help for\n\n178\n00:09:56,288 --> 00:10:02,650\nFormat-Wide, you'll see that we can\nspecify how the auto-sizing is done.\n\n179\n00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,570\nYou can indicate particular columns and\ntheir data types.\n\n180\n00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,180\nYou can do all sorts of various things,\n\n181\n00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,300\nexpanding other screens,\ngrouping things together.\n\n182\n00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,390\nYou can the sort orders on some of these.\n\n183\n00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,290\nSo there's some really neat stuff in here\nthat'll help you to be able to clean\n\n184\n00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:16,790\nup your data.\n\n185\n00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,360\nAll right.\n\n186\n00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,600\nSo those are a few of the different\nways we can modify the output,\n\n187\n00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,470\nbut all of those have one thing in common.\n\n188\n00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,500\nWhat they did,\nis they modified the output to our screen.\n\n189\n00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,060\nWe don't always want to\noutput to our screen.\n\n190\n00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,010\nWe might want to output to a file instead.\n\n191\n00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,080\nWhen we output to a file we might be using\nthat to then feed into some other software\n\n192\n00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,910\nto do other various tasks and\nthere's two main ones that I use for this.\n\n193\n00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,940\nSometimes I wanna output\ndata as an HTML file,\n\n194\n00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,080\nit's basically like a webpage so\nthat I can use it in a report right,\n\n195\n00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,680\nconvert it over to a PDF or\nsomething and send it to people.\n\n196\n00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,950\nGives you a nice quick easy output that's\nin a format that can be rendered by\n\n197\n00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,280\nany system.\n\n198\n00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,510\nThe other option is a CSV,\na Comma Separated Values file.\n\n199\n00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,850\nThat's a table file that can be used by\nalmost any spreadsheet software out there.\n\n200\n00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,800\nSo if you're using Microsoft Excel or\nNumbers from Apple or\n\n201\n00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,700\nwhatever the Open Office version,\nMath or whatever they call it.\n\n202\n00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,740\nSo, [LAUGH] you can bring it in there and\n\n203\n00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,930\nyou can start to work with it in a table\nright there in your spreadsheet software.\n\n204\n00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,910\nThese work really easy,\nlet me show you an example.\n\n205\n00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,331\nI've been working with Get-Service,\nso we'll stick with that one.\n\n206\n00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:31,550\nSo, I'll say, Get-Service and\n\n207\n00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,101\nI'm gonna pipe that into export,\nnot that one,\n\n208\n00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:41,544\nwe'll do this one first,\nconvert to- HTML, all right.\n\n209\n00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:45,014\nAnd I'm gonna be converting the output\nfrom Get-Service into HTML.\n\n210\n00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:49,181\nAnd then I can tell it exactly\nwhat I want, so in my case,\n\n211\n00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:51,414\nI just want a few properties.\n\n212\n00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:59,345\nSo I'll say, property name and\nstatus, and if I\n\n213\n00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:03,625\njust run it like this, it's actually gonna\ndisplay the HTML on my screen, right.\n\n214\n00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,955\nSo if I just run that, there it is,\nit's HTML, but it's on my screen, and so\n\n215\n00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:09,975\nwhat I need to do, is add another command.\n\n216\n00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:15,200\nThe pipeline command we've been using,\nthe two vertical lines That says take\n\n217\n00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,380\nthe output for one command and\nuse it as the input for another command.\n\n218\n00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,750\nI'm gonna use the greater\nthan symbol this time.\n\n219\n00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,900\nAnd the greater than symbol what that\nmeans is take the output from the previous\n\n220\n00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,270\ncommand and convert it into, or\n\n221\n00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,310\nredirect it from the screen\nto somewhere else, all right?\n\n222\n00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,080\nAnd in my case I'm gonna\nredirect it to a file.\n\n223\n00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,661\nI'm gonna send that to C:\\Services.html,\nall right.\n\n224\n00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,250\nSo I'm just gonna write it to that file.\n\n225\n00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,340\nOkay, I could have done like\nGet-Service and just done\n\n226\n00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:56,440\nright off the bat and thrown that into\nservices.txt, like that as a text file.\n\n227\n00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,370\nAnd now it's going to dump\nit right out as a text file.\n\n228\n00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,050\nI didn't do any formatting.\n\n229\n00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,270\nBut when I ran it this time,\nI piped it through convert to a HTML, and\n\n230\n00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,040\nnow it's going to dump\nit out as HTML content.\n\n231\n00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,824\nAnd so when I browse on my C drive,\nand find those two files,\n\n232\n00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:15,041\nhere they are, all right.\n\n233\n00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:20,344\nAnd this one is the Services.Text file,\nif I open it up, I'll just choose WordPad,\n\n234\n00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:25,562\nthere it is, that's the same information\nthat I got on my screen a moment ago.\n\n235\n00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:29,700\nAll right, so I can see it right there\nit's laid out for me, there's the data.\n\n236\n00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,810\nJust in a raw text file.\n\n237\n00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,490\nBut this other one,\nthis is an HTML file, and if I open it,\n\n238\n00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,650\nin Internet Explorer, here it is, and\nit's being rendered, and it's a little bit\n\n239\n00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,500\ndifferent because I picked particular\ncolumns, I picked name and status.\n\n240\n00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,385\nAnd so, it's laying them out,\nand it's typed for\n\n241\n00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:50,750\nHTML, so it looks nice and\npretty and there's my data.\n\n242\n00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,500\nI say nice and pretty,\nit's not very flashy, is it?\n\n243\n00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,454\nIt's just text laid out, but\nit's in that HTML format.\n\n244\n00:13:57,454 --> 00:14:00,310\nAll right, so pretty handy if\nyou're trying to generate reports.\n\n245\n00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,560\nI'll do this when I'm pulling up\nthings like lists of computers that\n\n246\n00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,530\nhaven't logged in, in over 90 days,\n\n247\n00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,030\nor list of users with passwords that\nhaven't been reset in the last 90 days.\n\n248\n00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,800\nThings like that,\n\n249\n00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,130\ncuz I'll wanna generate that as the list\nthat I can then show to people.\n\n250\n00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,990\nAnd I can tick people off on that list and\nsay yep, yep, I got that person,\n\n251\n00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,590\ngot that person and go down the line.\n\n252\n00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,040\nIt's pretty handy to have that\noutput in a report type format.\n\n253\n00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,760\nAll right, so that was let's see,\nwhat was all that?\n\n254\n00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,660\nThere we go.\n\n255\n00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,480\nSo that was convert to HTML.\n\n256\n00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,280\nAs well as just the redirect prompt there,\n\n257\n00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,020\nthe greater than symbol that\nredirects the output into a file.\n\n258\n00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,260\nI also mentioned CSVs.\n\n259\n00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,160\nAnd that was the command I\nalmost typed a minute ago.\n\n260\n00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,120\nI could say, Get-Service and\nI could pipe that into\n\n261\n00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:51,940\nthe Export-CSV command and\nspecify a file name for that one.\n\n262\n00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,970\nI actually don't need the redirect option\non this one, I can just specify the path,\n\n263\n00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,810\nand I'll put it as services.CSV.\n\n264\n00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,310\nYou can actually put the extension\nto do whatever you want, but\n\n265\n00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,000\nit makes life a lot easier if you use the\ncorrect extension, so I'll use CSV here.\n\n266\n00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,354\nSo I'm just going to export that out,\nand when I run it, there it goes, and\n\n267\n00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,024\non my C drive I should have a new file.\n\n268\n00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:15,420\nServices.CSV.\n\n269\n00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,170\nAnd I don't have a spreadsheet\nprogram here on my server, so\n\n270\n00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,520\nI'm just gonna edit that\nwith a text editor.\n\n271\n00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,460\nAnd what you'll see is that it's\nproperly formatted for a CSV.\n\n272\n00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,560\nThe first line contains my column names.\n\n273\n00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,340\nActually, I guess my\nfirst line is my typing.\n\n274\n00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,770\nBut the first real line,\nthis guy, are my column names.\n\n275\n00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:39,390\nName, RequiredServices,\nCanPauseAndContinue, and so on.\n\n276\n00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,210\nAnd then after that,\neach of the services are listed,\n\n277\n00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,080\none service per line, and\ntheir values are separated by a comma.\n\n278\n00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,350\nEvery time there's a comma, that indicates\nthat it's the end of that column and\n\n279\n00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,010\nnow we're moving to the next column.\n\n280\n00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,957\nIt's formatted as a CSV,\nwe can feed this into Microsoft Excel or\n\n281\n00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:57,361\nother spreadsheet programs.\n\n282\n00:15:57,361 --> 00:16:00,672\nAnd then we can sort and filter and\ndo all the crazy things that we do with\n\n283\n00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:03,722\nspreadsheets without having to\nfight with PowerShell to do it.\n\n284\n00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:04,265\nAll right.\n\n285\n00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:09,063\nSo that's another handy system you can use\nfor outputting It's also handy if you have\n\n286\n00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:11,794\nother systems that require\ninput of some sort and\n\n287\n00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:14,310\nthey expect that input to be in CSV.\n\n288\n00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,120\nSo I've used this with like\nsynchronizing email distribution lists.\n\n289\n00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,820\nI might export it with a PowerShell\ncommand, dumping it as a CSV, so\n\n290\n00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,990\na third party system could import\nit to have the mailing list, or\n\n291\n00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,460\nwhatever it was that we were doing.\n\n292\n00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,359\nSo, that kind of functionality\nis pretty handy.\n\n293\n00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:35,210\nAll right, so,\nthat was regular onscreen output.\n\n294\n00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,680\nRight, we did the format list and\nall those guys.\n\n295\n00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,760\nWe had the HTML and CSVs.\n\n296\n00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,180\nWhat else do we have?\n\n297\n00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,680\nFiltering.\n\n298\n00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,382\nSometimes we wanna filter output and\nI've sort of showed that to you, right?\n\n299\n00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,780\nWhere I was filtering\nbased on column names.\n\n300\n00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,600\nI was saying I just want these columns.\n\n301\n00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,730\nBut we might wanna filter based\non the results themselves and\n\n302\n00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,740\nthere's a few different ways\nthat we can go about that.\n\n303\n00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,600\nSo let me show you the two main\nways that we can filter our output.\n\n304\n00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,150\nSo let me get back to my shell here.\n\n305\n00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,180\nAll right,\nI'm gonna take the Get-Process command.\n\n306\n00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,210\nThe Get-Process shows\nme a ton of processes.\n\n307\n00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,450\nIt's everything that's running\non my server right now.\n\n308\n00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,070\nSo I see them and there they are.\n\n309\n00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,200\nMy server's fairly idle, so\nthere's really not that much.\n\n310\n00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,010\nBut you can see in my list,\nI've got Internet Explorer right there.\n\n311\n00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,830\nSo I'm running Internet Explorer\non my computer right now.\n\n312\n00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,910\nIt's up and running and\napparently it's running twice.\n\n313\n00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,760\nSo I've got two tabs open or something.\n\n314\n00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,070\nOh, I probably do have two\ntabs from that HTML file.\n\n315\n00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,890\nOh, I guess not.\n\n316\n00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,580\nWell anyhow, for\nsome reason I've got two processes.\n\n317\n00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,903\nWell, if I wanna look\nat that process output,\n\n318\n00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:44,490\nI may want to manipulate\nwhat columns I get, right?\n\n319\n00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,340\nWhich is what we saw earlier.\n\n320\n00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,380\nOr I might want to manipulate\nwhich processes I'm seeing.\n\n321\n00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,295\nSo let's take an example of,\nlet's start with a column.\n\n322\n00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:54,775\nColumn names.\nI'm gonna filter the column names cuz I\n\n323\n00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,835\ndon't wanna see all these\ncolumns that are here.\n\n324\n00:17:56,835 --> 00:18:01,121\nAnd we even saw earlier that sometimes\nthere's columns that aren't displayed that\n\n325\n00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,035\nactually exist.\n\n326\n00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:05,548\nSo like get-member could show us that\nthere might be more columns than what fit\n\n327\n00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:06,888\non the screen.\n\n328\n00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:10,910\nSo I'm gonna manipulate this output\nby changing the columns that I need.\n\n329\n00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,950\nNow when we used Format-List,\nFormat-List let me do that too,\n\n330\n00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,720\nI mean not list, Format-Table,\nthat one let us pick the column names.\n\n331\n00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,060\nBut we didn't actually have to use that,\nwe could have used another option.\n\n332\n00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,583\nWe could have used Select-Object.\n\n333\n00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:30,420\nI'm gonna do Get-Process, and\nI'm gonna pipe that into Select-Object.\n\n334\n00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,750\nThat commandlet let's us do filtering,\n\n335\n00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,065\nand we can filter based\non all sorts of things.\n\n336\n00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:41,425\nI'm gonna filter based on property,\nand I'm gonna\n\n337\n00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:45,925\nsay that I want the process name and\nthe ID.\n\n338\n00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,545\nThat's all I want, all right?\n\n339\n00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:50,205\nSo I'm just gonna give it those values,\nand I'll run it.\n\n340\n00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:52,300\nAnd now, I get that output.\n\n341\n00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,330\nNow, that's not really any different\nthan using Format-Table to do it, right?\n\n342\n00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,020\nAnd in reality Format-Table,\nis just calling Select-Object.\n\n343\n00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,470\nThat's exactly how it works.\n\n344\n00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,510\nSo, it's really part and parcel,\nthey're kind of the same thing.\n\n345\n00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,540\nBut what if I want to\nfilter this even more?\n\n346\n00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,925\nWhat if I just want to see processes\nthat are Internet Explorer?\n\n347\n00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:14,850\nRight?\n\n348\n00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,770\nIf I'm on a busy terminal server,\n\n349\n00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,450\nthere could be hundreds of\nthousands of processes.\n\n350\n00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,470\nI just want to find Internet Explorer.\n\n351\n00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,520\nNow I'm not filtering by column name,\nI'm filtering by a value in a cell.\n\n352\n00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,500\nI wanna look in this cell\nover here in this column and\n\n353\n00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,150\nfind just the ones that match\nInternet Explorer, right?\n\n354\n00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,910\nThat's a little bit harder to do,\nbut it definitely can be done.\n\n355\n00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,530\nWhat we do is we use a different command.\n\n356\n00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,868\nWe use the Where-Object.\n\n357\n00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:46,925\nSelect-Object, that let us pick those\nproperty values, those columns.\n\n358\n00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:50,170\nWhere-Object is like a qualifier.\n\n359\n00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,370\nWe're saying yeah,\ngo ahead and get these objects,\n\n360\n00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,780\nwhere the object meets a certain set\nof criteria that we define, all right.\n\n361\n00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,000\nSo, I'm gonna take this, and actually\nwe'll just get rid of Select-Object\n\n362\n00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,100\njust to make life a little bit easier for\nus, and I'll pipe that into Where-Object,\n\n363\n00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,750\nand now I'm gonna specify my criteria.\n\n364\n00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,860\nNow you can have all sorts of criteria.\n\n365\n00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,640\nYou can get very advanced with this.\n\n366\n00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,370\nSo this is another one of those commands\nwhere we bring in those squiggly brackets.\n\n367\n00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,168\nBecause now we can go multiline, you can\nput in all sorts of syntax variations,\n\n368\n00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:20,313\nand have at it, right?\n\n369\n00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,520\nBut I'm gonna keep mine pretty simple.\n\n370\n00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,088\nI'm just gonna say where, and\nI'm gonna query that name value.\n\n371\n00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:28,950\nNow I'm gonna use the dollar\nsign underscore variable,\n\n372\n00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,080\nthat's basically representing\nthe output from the first command.\n\n373\n00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,120\nAnd I'm going to query based on name.\n\n374\n00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,000\nNow name is just an alias for\nprocess name, so I could do either one.\n\n375\n00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,030\nI'll just do name because\nI'm a lazy typer.\n\n376\n00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,295\nSo, I'll say $_.Name, so\n\n377\n00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:52,195\nwhere the name -eq where\nit equals -iexplorer.\n\n378\n00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:56,370\nAll right?\nI just wanna find processes where the name\n\n379\n00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:02,420\nis iexplorer, and\nwhen I run that, I get nothing.\n\n380\n00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,010\nWhy did I get nothing?\n\n381\n00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,260\nOh, it's not called iexplorer.\n\n382\n00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,400\nIt's called iexplore, so if I get the name\nright, that'll help a little bit.\n\n383\n00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,410\nSo, there we go, iexplore.\n\n384\n00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,490\nAnd now, I get my output, and\nI just see those processes.\n\n385\n00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:21,465\nSo, we can use Select-Object\nto pick the columns, and\n\n386\n00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:25,350\nWhere-Object to pick the rows.\n\n387\n00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,280\nAnd you can combine the two\nto get very specific, right?\n\n388\n00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,199\nI might wanna say, where the object\nis iexplore, and then further,\n\n389\n00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:40,640\nsay Select-Object, and\nspecify just the properties that I want.\n\n390\n00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,540\nSo property name, or I guess process name,\nif we're gonna keep the naming right.\n\n391\n00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,240\nAnd what else?\n\n392\n00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,140\nID.\n\n393\n00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,831\nI think that was what I did earlier.\n\n394\n00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:54,900\nAnd now,\nsorry my heads on top of it there.\n\n395\n00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,920\nNow I get just those process names and\njust those IDs.\n\n396\n00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,560\nI've combined those two commands\nto generate the result I want.\n\n397\n00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,170\nMy formatting has a little\nbit to be desired here.\n\n398\n00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,970\nSo I might want to then pipe\nthis again into Format-Table\n\n399\n00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,690\nto be able to specify the width of\nthe columns, and adjust that too.\n\n400\n00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,660\nSo, pretty neat different methods there.\n\n401\n00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,130\nBut, just remember\nthe basic rule of thumb.\n\n402\n00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,350\nSelect-Object is great for\npicking columns.\n\n403\n00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,540\nWhere-Object is great for picking rows.\n\n404\n00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,990\nAll right, between those different\nmethods, those are ways that we can modify\n\n405\n00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,230\nthe output of a command and get exactly\nwhat we want in the way that we need it.\n\n406\n00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,175\nAll right, so in this segment, we got\na chance to take a look Format-List,\n\n407\n00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:38,870\nFormat-Table, and Format-Wide.\n\n408\n00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:44,270\nWe got a chance to see export-CSV,\nas well as convert to HTML, right?\n\n409\n00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,910\nSome really neat ones there for\noutputting those values.\n\n410\n00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,850\nWe saw the redirect prompt, right?\n\n411\n00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,238\nThe greater than symbol to redirect output\nto a file, and we got a chance to see\n\n412\n00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:58,330\nSelect-Object and Where-Object to\nfilter the output of our commands.\n\n413\n00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,530\nLot of good stuff in there to\nbe able to change our output.\n\n414\n00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,410\nAll right.\nWell, I hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n415\n00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:10,583\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n416\n00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,290\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,520\n[SOUND] In this segment, we're gonna take\n\n2\n00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,594\na look at\nPowerShell's Script Execution Policies.\n\n3\n00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:16,603\nWhen you get started with PowerShell, one\nof the features that Microsoft promotes\n\n4\n00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:18,640\nis how easy it is to write scripts.\n\n5\n00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,650\nBut you might've noticed that on\nmost systems, when you try and\n\n6\n00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,290\nrun a script, you get an error\ntelling you access denied.\n\n7\n00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,370\nBy default, the majority of systems\nout there have the scripting disabled.\n\n8\n00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,630\nAnd that seems unfortunate, but\nit's there to protect you from, well,\n\n9\n00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,130\nnot just from yourself,\nbut from other people too.\n\n10\n00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,820\nSo basically Microsoft says,\nhey, scripting is great.\n\n11\n00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,580\nIt's very powerful, but you probably\ndon't want it on unless you need it.\n\n12\n00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,200\nSo they turn it off by default, and\nthen it's up to you to go and modify that.\n\n13\n00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,650\nNow, it's really easy to change it.\n\n14\n00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,210\nWe just need to know to do it.\n\n15\n00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,800\nWe have what are called\nscript execution policies.\n\n16\n00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,120\nAnd these are the policies that define\nwhat scripts we're allowed to run.\n\n17\n00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,280\nMicrosoft classifies scripts\na few different ways, all right.\n\n18\n00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,190\nThere are trusted scripts,\nand untrusted scripts.\n\n19\n00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,110\nA trusted script is one\nthat's been digitally signed.\n\n20\n00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,510\nIn other words, whoever wrote the script,\ngot a digital signature,\n\n21\n00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,200\na certificate, a private key,\npublic key pair, that they could then\n\n22\n00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,120\nattach a digital signature to the script,\nto show that it hadn't been modified.\n\n23\n00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,480\nThat way when you run it, if you trust\nwhoever issued that certificate,\n\n24\n00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,870\nyou'll be able to verify that the script\nhasn't been modified, and run it, and\n\n25\n00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,190\nknow that it's written to run the way\nthat it was originally intended, and\n\n26\n00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,160\nsomebody hasn't modified\nit to add their own code.\n\n27\n00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,470\nThat's a great idea, and\n\n28\n00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,010\nit's definitely something that\nmost people would want, but.\n\n29\n00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,010\nIf you're writing your own scripts,\n\n30\n00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,060\nyou probably don't necessarily have\na public key infrastructure, or\n\n31\n00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,070\nwant to go through the headache of\ndigitally signing your scripts.\n\n32\n00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,230\nAnd so,\nMicrosoft has several different tiers\n\n33\n00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,750\nof other types of scripts that we can run,\nand it really comes down to location.\n\n34\n00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,160\nDigitally signed scripts are trusted,\nand they're allowed to run.\n\n35\n00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,952\nUntrusted script, scripts that aren't\ndigitally signed, are not allowed to run,\n\n36\n00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:08,950\nall right?\n\n37\n00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,310\nAnd that's the default policy\nthat you've got in PowerShell.\n\n38\n00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,540\nSo when get a script from Microsoft,\nfor example, it will likely run, but\n\n39\n00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,740\nif you write your own,\nit's gonna be blocked.\n\n40\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,960\nNow, when we go to adjust the policy,\nwe can loosen those restrictions a bit.\n\n41\n00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,850\nAnd we can say, all right,\n\n42\n00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,370\nwell, we'll allow the system to run\nscripts in certain scenarios, all right.\n\n43\n00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,850\nAnd those scenarios all boil down\nto where the script is stored.\n\n44\n00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,920\nLocal scripts are ones that are stored\nright there on that machine.\n\n45\n00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,190\nYou're saying hey, I wrote a script.\n\n46\n00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,570\nIt's stored right here on the machine,\nand I wanna run it, all right.\n\n47\n00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,160\nSo we might wanna loosen\nthe policy to say, that's okay.\n\n48\n00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,400\nWe'll run digitally signed scripts, and\nthe ones that we've got locally stored.\n\n49\n00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,890\nBut you might have scripts that\nare stored on a network share, and\n\n50\n00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,070\nthose are not allowed.\n\n51\n00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,420\nSo we might have to loosen\nthe restrictions even more, and say yeah,\n\n52\n00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,100\nwe'll allow these untrusted scripts\nto run from a network store.\n\n53\n00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,610\nBut that's a problem.\n\n54\n00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,380\nBecause now if an attacker is\ntrying to get into your system,\n\n55\n00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,320\nwhere are their scripts gonna be?\n\n56\n00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,370\nNot locally, right?\n\n57\n00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,400\nThey'll be remote.\n\n58\n00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,650\nSo that's the exact thing\nyou don't want to do.\n\n59\n00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,980\nSo by adjusting this policy, you're\nweakening the security of your server.\n\n60\n00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,190\nMicrosoft's recommendation is,\nif you're going to be writing scripts,\n\n61\n00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,110\ndeploy a public key infrastructure, and\ndigitally sign all of your scripts.\n\n62\n00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,730\nBut most people don't\nhave that PKI in place.\n\n63\n00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,210\nSo the next best thing is,\n\n64\n00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,520\nonly run scripts that are digitally\nsigned or stored locally on that server.\n\n65\n00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,590\nOnes that have been copied to, or\nwritten right on that server, so\n\n66\n00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,160\nthat you can verify their\nauthenticity before you run them.\n\n67\n00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,180\nLet's take a look at those policies now,\nand how we can work with them, and\n\n68\n00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,810\nhow we can change them, all lright.\n\n69\n00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,620\nFirst off, you probably want to know what\nyour execution policy is to start with.\n\n70\n00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,190\nAnd we've got the get\ndash execution policy,\n\n71\n00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,060\nthere we go, commandlet and it'll\nreturn what policy we're in right now.\n\n72\n00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,210\nThere's four different policies, and for\nmost people restricted is the default.\n\n73\n00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,220\nI say most,\nbecause depending on who installed server,\n\n74\n00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,620\nthey can override that as part\nof the installation option.\n\n75\n00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,240\nSo it could have been changed or\n\n76\n00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,950\na group policy object could\nchange that setting too.\n\n77\n00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,050\nBut if you just do a default install\n,it's typically going to be restricted,\n\n78\n00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,460\nand that's what I'm in right here.\n\n79\n00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,170\nThat means that I will run digitally\nsigned certificates, I mean scripts and\n\n80\n00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,620\nthat's it all right.\n\n81\n00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,240\nI won't run any others.\n\n82\n00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,230\nSo for example i've written\na script here on my desktop.\n\n83\n00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,135\nAnd there it is.\n\n84\n00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:31,880\nCustomize.ps1.\n\n85\n00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,470\nThis is a script that I tote around\nthat customizes my user interface.\n\n86\n00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,220\nI'm not a big fan of the whole\nblue background, and\n\n87\n00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,260\nwhite text and all that stuff.\n\n88\n00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,990\nSo I manipulate it, and I just have\na little script that does that for me.\n\n89\n00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,518\nSo if I try and run that script,\nI get an error, all right.\n\n90\n00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:52,010\nIn the error a script cannot be loaded,\n\n91\n00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,600\nbecause running scripts is\ndisabled on this system.\n\n92\n00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,250\nFor more information, see about\nexecution policy at blah,blah,blah.\n\n93\n00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,200\nAnd so it's telling me to go enroute.\n\n94\n00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,620\nWell I can change that execution policy\nto allow for the scripts to run.\n\n95\n00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,520\nThe command that we use for that,\nis the set execution policy.\n\n96\n00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,260\nAnd if we pull up our help\ndocumentation on it, it's just,\n\n97\n00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,180\nset execution dash policy.\n\n98\n00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,370\nIt will give you the basic command syntax\nfor it, In the four different levels.\n\n99\n00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,740\nWhich actually it doesn't list\nthe four different levels, does it?\n\n100\n00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,030\nWell anyhow,\nlet's do the full output here, and\n\n101\n00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,240\nsee if it's included in the notes.\n\n102\n00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,630\nWell there's really just four levels.\n\n103\n00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,430\nRight?\nRestricted is the default.\n\n104\n00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,950\nOkay.\nThere are.\n\n105\n00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,870\nAll four of them.\n\n106\n00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,820\nSo, restricted is that default.\n\n107\n00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,390\nAnd, here they just call\nit all all signed, but\n\n108\n00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,660\nif I move up a little bit,\nthere we go, there's restricted.\n\n109\n00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,000\nSo restricted, and that means we're not\ngoing to let any scripts run whatsoever.\n\n110\n00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,390\nRestricted here we're actually\ndisabling all the scripts.\n\n111\n00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,440\nAll sign now we're saying, we'll let those\ndigitally signed ones run, but any non\n\n112\n00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,330\ndigitally signed ones or untrusted ones,\nwe're not going to let those run at all.\n\n113\n00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,230\nAfter that we start to get\ninto some of the weaker ones.\n\n114\n00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,620\nAnd the main ones that\nwe're going to deal with,\n\n115\n00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,326\nare these next two,\nremote signed and unrestricted.\n\n116\n00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:15,620\nThe remote signed says,\nI will allow digitally signed scripts,\n\n117\n00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,450\nwhether they are local or\nremote, i'll allow those to run.\n\n118\n00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,090\nBut, if it's remote and\nit's not signed, I won't let it run.\n\n119\n00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,370\nSo if it's remote it's gotta be signed.\n\n120\n00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,980\nIf it's local,\nit doesn't have to be signed.\n\n121\n00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,760\nRemote signed's what most\npeople switch to, because they\n\n122\n00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,220\nwant to make sure remote scripts don't\nrun unless they're digitally signed, but\n\n123\n00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,540\nlocally they want to allow them,\nall right?\n\n124\n00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,270\nAnd they can do that and allow that, and\nthen you'll have that certificate, or\n\n125\n00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,660\nyou'll have that script that you can run,\nwithout having to digitally sign it.\n\n126\n00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,660\nThe next one is unrestricted though,\nand that's the worst one.\n\n127\n00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,420\nAnd that's where we say we don't care.\n\n128\n00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,100\nWe'll run scripts from wherever,\nwho cares right.\n\n129\n00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,470\nAnd that'll run, and\nnow you open yourself up to vulnerability,\n\n130\n00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,485\ncuz somebody could have modified\nthat script, and you won't know.\n\n131\n00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:02,735\nYou've got no way to verify that\nmodifications haven't been made.\n\n132\n00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,705\nSo, those are the main ones that we go to.\n\n133\n00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:08,395\nThere's a few others like bypass,\nall right.\n\n134\n00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,355\nBypass basically just shuts\noff the polices all together.\n\n135\n00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:13,605\nWhich is very much like unrestricted.\n\n136\n00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:17,080\nAnd then undefined means\nwe don't have a policy.\n\n137\n00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,360\nYou're not normally\ngoing to have that one,\n\n138\n00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,270\nthat would be something like in a group\npolicy object ,when you say undefined,\n\n139\n00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,510\nand it would leave it up to the client\nto make their own decision.\n\n140\n00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,910\nSo those are some of the different\nvalues that we'll see.\n\n141\n00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,902\nBut the four main ones are,\nrestricted, remote signed,\n\n142\n00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:35,330\nunrestricted, and\nthat all signed right there.\n\n143\n00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,780\nAll right.\nSo how does this affect us?\n\n144\n00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,020\nWell, I couldn't run\nthat script a moment ago,\n\n145\n00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,520\nbecause I'm not allowing\nmy locally signed one.\n\n146\n00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,070\nAll right?\n\n147\n00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,730\nOr my locally unsigned ones.\n\n148\n00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,910\nSo, I might wanna change to remote signed.\n\n149\n00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,920\nI don't wanna run remote ones\nunless they're digitally signed,\n\n150\n00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,850\nbut local is okay.\n\n151\n00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,600\nI wanna allow it.\nAll right?\n\n152\n00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,510\nWell, let me just switch over\nto a PowerShell that was run\n\n153\n00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,290\nas an administrator,\nwhich is not this one.\n\n154\n00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,700\nI guess, let me launch\na PowerShell as an administrator.\n\n155\n00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,980\nAll right.\nAnd I'm gonna do\n\n156\n00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,750\nthe Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned,\nright?\n\n157\n00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,190\nI'm gonna flip it so\n\n158\n00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,460\nthat I'm going to allow local scripts\nto run, even if they're not signed.\n\n159\n00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,420\nAll right.\n\n160\n00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,280\nNow if I go back to my other PowerShell\nWhen I tried to run that script just\n\n161\n00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,380\na moment ago I got the big error,\n\n162\n00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,800\nthis guy right here where it\ntold me I wasn't allowed.\n\n163\n00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,700\nWell now I'm gonna rerun that command,\nI'm gonna rerun it, and this time it ran.\n\n164\n00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:39,540\nAll right, it ran and now I've got my\ngreen text with the black background,\n\n165\n00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,390\nthat I like so much, and\nit's laid out right here, and\n\n166\n00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,330\nit's got everything I need, all right.\n\n167\n00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,142\nSo, it let me run that script now,\nbecause we're in that remote signed mode.\n\n168\n00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:50,530\nAll right now,\nwhat if I didn't run it from here?\n\n169\n00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,260\nWhat if I ran it from\na network location instead?\n\n170\n00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,370\nAll right, well I copied that\nover to a map network drive, and\n\n171\n00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:06,190\nif I go over here and run it,\nI still get a failure.\n\n172\n00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,430\nThat's the same exact\nscript I ran a moment ago.\n\n173\n00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,880\nThe difference is the script I ran\na moment ago is right here on my C drive,\n\n174\n00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,130\nright on the local system,\nthis one is on a mapped drive.\n\n175\n00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,730\nX colon, I mapped that here to\nanother server here in the office, and\n\n176\n00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,980\nit's telling me that it can't run, and\nthat's because of my execution policy.\n\n177\n00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,245\nIt's not allowed to run because it's\nremote, and it's not digitally signed.\n\n178\n00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,810\nAll right.\n\n179\n00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,930\nIf I go and\nI switch my policy to unrestricted,\n\n180\n00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,310\nwhich is a really bad idea,\nbut we'll do it.\n\n181\n00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,700\nRight, so\nI'll switch over to unrestricted,\n\n182\n00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,290\nnow I can run scripts from wherever, and\nif I jump back over here, I can try and\n\n183\n00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:50,040\nrun the script from my network share,\nand now it's just giving me a warning.\n\n184\n00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,230\nAnd I can say, see in that warning\nright there, that's actually the,\n\n185\n00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,960\nactually I need to say r for run.\n\n186\n00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,210\nThat's the difference between\nunrestricted and bypass.\n\n187\n00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,010\nWhen you say unrestricted,\nyou're saying any script can run.\n\n188\n00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,920\nBypass you're disabling the check so\nany script can run.\n\n189\n00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,060\nThe difference is this warning.\n\n190\n00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,620\nIf you have bypass you\nwon't even get the warning.\n\n191\n00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,350\nSo when I do this, I'll just hit Run Once,\nand it's gonna run, and\n\n192\n00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,690\nthere's my customizations, right?\n\n193\n00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,710\nSo nice little set of security policies,\n\n194\n00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,020\nvery easy to modify,\nit's the default that trips people up.\n\n195\n00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,640\nI've heard from people where they said,\nman, PowerShell is just not working for\n\n196\n00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880\nme, it won't run my scripts.\n\n197\n00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,570\nAnd I say well what\nhappened when you ran it?\n\n198\n00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,140\nThey say I got an error.\n\n199\n00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,760\nAnd then I say one of my favorite things,\nwhich is well did you read the error?\n\n200\n00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,670\nSometimes it tells you what's going on,\nand they'll say well, ya know,\n\n201\n00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,380\nI really didn't.\n\n202\n00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,950\nAnd it's right there you,\njust have to change that execution policy.\n\n203\n00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,450\nI'm gonna move mine back to remote signed.\n\n204\n00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,240\nAnd when I do that.\n\n205\n00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,050\nNow I'll to be back to where I\ncan't run scripts off the network,\n\n206\n00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,070\nunless they're digitally signed.\n\n207\n00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:58,980\nAll right.\n\n208\n00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,720\nSo those are the execution policies\nthat we have inside of PowerShell.\n\n209\n00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,210\nNow for digitally signed scripts, there's\nactually several different steps you have\n\n210\n00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,450\nto go through to sign one, and it's\na little beyond the scope of this segment.\n\n211\n00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,330\nSo I'm going to save that.\n\n212\n00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,430\nI will probably do another segment later,\nto show how to digitally sign them.\n\n213\n00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,590\nBecause it's kind of\nintegrated with Visual Studio.\n\n214\n00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,580\nSo you have to create your\nscript there and sign it.\n\n215\n00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,350\nAnd I know they added some of the base\nfunctionality into ISE, but I don't,\n\n216\n00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,020\nactually I've never signed a script in\nISE, so I'm not sure if it'll do it there.\n\n217\n00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,910\nBut it is a little bit more\nof an involved process.\n\n218\n00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,240\nBut for our database scripting,\nyou might choose to flip on remote signed,\n\n219\n00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,090\nrun your local script, and\nthen flip it back to restricted again.\n\n220\n00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,830\nAll right.\n\n221\n00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,150\nIf you're not running\nscripts all the time,\n\n222\n00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,420\nyou don't need to leave the policies\nset a particular way for a long period.\n\n223\n00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,230\nSo, you've got options with\nhow you wanna manipulate that,\n\n224\n00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,420\njust remember that you can.\n\n225\n00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,450\nYou have the different options\nthat are available to you,\n\n226\n00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,230\nand pick the one that meets your needs.\n\n227\n00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,420\nAll right, so in this segment, we got\na chance to take a look at the execution\n\n228\n00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,580\npolicies that are a part of PowerShell,\nand\n\n229\n00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,545\nhow they influence us\nbeing able to run scripts.\n\n230\n00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:10,285\nI hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n231\n00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:14,285\nStay tuned, we've got more\nPowerShell coming down the road.\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,841\n[SOUND].\n\n2\n00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,666\nIn this segment,\n\n3\n00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,031\nwe're gonna take a look at customizing\nthe PowerShell user interface.\n\n4\n00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,510\nBelieve it or not,\nwhen you fire up the PowerShell,\n\n5\n00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,420\nit may not actually be visually aligned\nto the way that you expect it to be,\n\n6\n00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,670\nor in a way that you find pleasant.\n\n7\n00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,250\nIn fact, if you ask me, I really hate the\ndefault configuration in PowerShell, and\n\n8\n00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,380\nfind it pretty unusable.\n\n9\n00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,980\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n10\n00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,410\nIf I fire up the PowerShell here on\nthis server, I'm just gonna launch it,\n\n11\n00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,730\nit's gonna pop up and for me, if I'm\nsitting at the computer, this font size,\n\n12\n00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,940\nthis color scheme, the arrangement\nof the window, it's suitable.\n\n13\n00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,270\nIt's enough to get by.\n\n14\n00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,850\nBut I find as I get older,\nI appreciate larger text a little more.\n\n15\n00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,470\nAnd especially on the show, I always wanna\nhave a larger font, and larger layouts.\n\n16\n00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,840\nTo make it more clear, so\nit shows up better in the recording.\n\n17\n00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,090\nAnd so, I've gotten in the habit\nof kind of rearranging,\n\n18\n00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,550\nchanging the PowerShell to match\nmy own personal needs, all right?\n\n19\n00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,870\nNow there's a few different\nways we can go about that.\n\n20\n00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,400\nWe can set various things to customize it,\nand one of the problems we have,\n\n21\n00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,290\nis that some of those settings\ndon't last through a ,uh, you know,\n\n22\n00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,240\nclosing the PowerShell and opening it\nagain, we start to lose our settings.\n\n23\n00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,080\nOr if we go around to multiple computers,\n\n24\n00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,800\nhow do you create that\nconsistent view across them?\n\n25\n00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,030\nSo I'm gonna show a couple of\ndifferent way to handle that.\n\n26\n00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,330\nWe're gonna customize this interface, and\n\n27\n00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,450\ncreate a script to be able to solve\nsome of the problems that we can have.\n\n28\n00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,080\nSo that's we're were gonna\nbe going in this segment.\n\n29\n00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,050\nSo let's just start with\nthe PowerShell itself, and\n\n30\n00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,700\nwe're gonna fo the easy route on this one.\n\n31\n00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,810\nThe easiest way to change\nthe way the powershell looks,\n\n32\n00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,660\nis right here through\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n33\n00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,000\nIn my title bar for the Windows\nPowerShell, we can right click and\n\n34\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,520\nyou can go to properties.\n\n35\n00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,730\nAnd IN the properties tab for\nthe PowerShell window,\n\n36\n00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,580\nyou'll be able to go in and\nchange all sorts of things.\n\n37\n00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,070\nThe size of your cursor.\n\n38\n00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,360\nThe buffer size for your command history.\n\n39\n00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,420\nNotice I've got mine set to 50, right.\n\n40\n00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,060\nThe default is actually 64.\n\n41\n00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,490\nApparently I messed with that,\nbut you could go through and\n\n42\n00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,620\nstart to adjust things like that.\n\n43\n00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,350\nUnder the font, we could choose\nwhat font is going to be rendering,\n\n44\n00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,520\nnow the font that it uses is\ncalled a raster font, and\n\n45\n00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,990\nMicrosoft likes to use those\nbecause they scale really well.\n\n46\n00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,480\nIf you have high resolution or\nlow resolution monitors.\n\n47\n00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,800\nRaster fonts pretty much look the same.\n\n48\n00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,440\nBut, if you've got a high\nresolution monitor,\n\n49\n00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,040\nthe default raster font is really,\nreally tiny.\n\n50\n00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,150\nSo at a minimum, we may wanna\nbump up the size of that font.\n\n51\n00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,740\nPersonally, I like to switch to\na different font altogether, and\n\n52\n00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,690\nyou'll see there's only a couple\navailable, Consolas and Lucida Console.\n\n53\n00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,450\nThese are both console fonts, and\nthat means that they have a fixed width.\n\n54\n00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,715\nFixed width is really important for\na font in PowerShell,\n\n55\n00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:50,220\nbecause It's really all text based, but\nsometimes it almost looks like a picture.\n\n56\n00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,130\nYou guys have seen at this point where\nwe have outputs arranged like a table,\n\n57\n00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,830\nwhere it needs the columns to\nall be the same width, and\n\n58\n00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,700\na lot of fonts have variable widths for\nletters.\n\n59\n00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,590\nSo like the letter W, might be a lot\nwider than the letter I, and that causes\n\n60\n00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,830\na problem when you're trying to draw,\nwell basically antsy art on the screen.\n\n61\n00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,496\nSo we need a fixed font.\n\n62\n00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:14,270\nThe thing is that PowerShell is being\ncalled to a very low level in Windows, and\n\n63\n00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,020\nso it doesn't have access to most fonts.\n\n64\n00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,290\nThey're not even available.\n\n65\n00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,985\nSo you might have a hundred different\nfonts on your computer, but\n\n66\n00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:23,060\nPowerShell will only show these three.\n\n67\n00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,680\nThese are the three that Microsoft\nhas developed and attached to it.\n\n68\n00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,260\nNow Lucida Console and Consolas,\nthey're traditional fonts,\n\n69\n00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,770\nlike what a lot of us will use.\n\n70\n00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,720\nand you'll see that you can pick the font\nsize here based on the pixel height.\n\n71\n00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,950\nHow many pixels tall each letter is.\n\n72\n00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,930\nAnd I usually bump mine\nup to something like 14.\n\n73\n00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,940\nHere on this show,\nI'll normally go even higher to 18,\n\n74\n00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,510\nto be able to get it to show up\nnice in the recordings, right?\n\n75\n00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,760\nAnd you get a little preview down here,\n\n76\n00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,450\nthat lets you know what\nit's gonna be like.\n\n77\n00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,930\nThe layout tab is probably\nthe most important, though.\n\n78\n00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,230\nThere's two sections here in the layout\ntab that I like to manipulate.\n\n79\n00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,561\nThe top part is the screen buffer, and the\nmiddle part is the window size, all right.\n\n80\n00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,300\nThe screen buffer is basically what\nyou can scroll back, all right.\n\n81\n00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,680\nAs we start running commands and\ndoing things in the PowerShell.\n\n82\n00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,760\nThings are gonna go off our screen, right?\n\n83\n00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,260\nSo for\nexample if I go back to my PowerShell, and\n\n84\n00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,500\nyou'll see my new font has taken effect.\n\n85\n00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,540\nIf I do get-service,\nhere's all my services.\n\n86\n00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,130\nWell it was more than what would\nfit on this one screen, so\n\n87\n00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,955\nI got to scroll back to get to those.\n\n88\n00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:27,012\nAnd as I scroll back I can see them,\nthat's wonderful, right.\n\n89\n00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:32,795\nWell, if I keep doing things like this,\nif I do, for example, like a,\n\n90\n00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:38,185\nlet's do a, something like that.\n\n91\n00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,140\nOh you know what,\nit's not going to let me do that, is it?\n\n92\n00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,950\nWhat would be a good one?\n\n93\n00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,890\nWell, I guess we could kind of, let's do\nget-windowsfeature, that's a good one.\n\n94\n00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,410\nNow, when I start running these\ncommands that are multi-screen,\n\n95\n00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,840\nyou'll notice my scroll bar moving\ndown the line as it runs, right?\n\n96\n00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,130\nGenerating that output, and,\nas I start to scroll back.\n\n97\n00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,390\nSee how my get-service is gone?\n\n98\n00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,360\nI can't scroll back to that anymore.\n\n99\n00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,400\nThat's because my buffer is only\nset to a certain amount of lines.\n\n100\n00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,170\nWell personally, I like to be able\nto scroll back a good distance,\n\n101\n00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,290\nto see commands that I might have run 20\ncommands ago, and to see their output.\n\n102\n00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,940\nI can always look at the history\nfrom my commands, but\n\n103\n00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,960\nI don't see the output in the history.\n\n104\n00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,730\nWhen you get to -history,\nit's just showing the commands you ran.\n\n105\n00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,620\nIt's not actually showing\nyou what the output was.\n\n106\n00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,160\nSo bumping up that buffer is really handy.\n\n107\n00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,140\nThere's two bumpers.\n\n108\n00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,310\nThere's the vertical bumper.\n\n109\n00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,190\nThat's your scroll back.\n\n110\n00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,290\nThat's what I just showed you right here.\n\n111\n00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,720\nThis is how far back I can go vertically.\n\n112\n00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,520\nAnd there's a horizontal buffer\nwhich would be left and right.\n\n113\n00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,550\nI don't find that one terribly useful,\nso I don't normally mess with it, but\n\n114\n00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,070\nif you have data that runs off\nthe right side of your screen,\n\n115\n00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,250\nit'll enable you to be able to view that.\n\n116\n00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,150\nSo if I go back into my properties.\n\n117\n00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,860\nI can go to my layout, and under screen\nbuffer, the width is set to 80, and\n\n118\n00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,170\nI'm fine with that.\n\n119\n00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,150\nI don't need to see things off\nthe edge of my screen, but\n\n120\n00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,470\nthe height is only set to 300.\n\n121\n00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,250\nI'm gonna bump that up to 3,000,\nall right?\n\n122\n00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,970\nWhen I bump that up to 3,000,\n\n123\n00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,390\nnow it's gonna store the last\n3,000 lines that I've run.\n\n124\n00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,430\nSo as I run something like get-service,\nall right,\n\n125\n00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,150\nsure that was more than one screen.\n\n126\n00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,080\nAnd when I run get dash Windows feature,\nit's going to run that.\n\n127\n00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,730\nThat's more than one screen,\nI think I ran it three times a moment ago.\n\n128\n00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,930\nSo let me run it three times again.\n\n129\n00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,930\nAnd when I run it, well, see how my scroll\nbar is not all the way to the bottom.\n\n130\n00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,140\nThat means I've still got buffer room,\n\n131\n00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,680\nI've got all this buffer\nroom still available.\n\n132\n00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,350\nBut if I start to scroll back, there's\nthe output from Get-Windows feature, and\n\n133\n00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,400\nhere's the output for Get-Service.\n\n134\n00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,960\nI can scroll back and see that.\n\n135\n00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,590\nIt's really handy, especially if you're\ndealing with large amounts of output,\n\n136\n00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,525\nto have a good bit of scroll back buffer.\n\n137\n00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,155\nAnd if you've been scrolling around like\nthis, you can always just push enter and\n\n138\n00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:52,655\nit will jump right back to your prompt and\n\n139\n00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:55,265\nget you, kind of,\nback to the current line.\n\n140\n00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,775\nSo definitely a neat thing to set.\n\n141\n00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,630\nI almost always bump up\nmy scrollback buffer.\n\n142\n00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,560\nI usually go to 5,000 lines.\n\n143\n00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,690\nDo be aware, that scrollback buffer,\nit is being stored in RAM, and so\n\n144\n00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,440\nit consumes memory.\n\n145\n00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,450\nBut we're just talking about text here.\n\n146\n00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,850\nSo 5000 lines of text, usually adds up to\nless than about 100 kilobytes of data.\n\n147\n00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,680\nSo you're not talking about\na huge amount of memory.\n\n148\n00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,860\nBut the bigger you make that buffer,\nthe more memory it is taking.\n\n149\n00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,570\nAll right, so those are a few\nof the things that we can tweak.\n\n150\n00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,690\nLet's look at some of the other ones.\n\n151\n00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,500\nNow, on high resolution monitors,\n\n152\n00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,570\nyou likely have a lot of screen\nreal estate, a lot of room.\n\n153\n00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,390\nWhat I was adjusting there was a virtual\nsize for my window, my buffer, but\n\n154\n00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,150\nyou also have the physical\nsize of the window.\n\n155\n00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,650\nRight now,\nmy window's only 80 characters wide.\n\n156\n00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,730\nI've got plenty of extra\nroom here on the screen.\n\n157\n00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,350\nI might want to go up to\nsomething like 110, all right.\n\n158\n00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,380\nSo I'll bump it up to 110 characters,\nso it's a wider window.\n\n159\n00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,640\nAnd my height is set to 26 characters,\nbut I've got more room vertically.\n\n160\n00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,583\nSo I might wanna bump that up,\nmaybe I'll go to 32.\n\n161\n00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,490\nAll right.\n\n162\n00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,583\nSo we can bump those in.\n\n163\n00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,860\nAnd get those set.\n\n164\n00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,792\nThe last part here is the window position.\n\n165\n00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,159\nAnd I never bother setting that\nbecause you can just drag and\n\n166\n00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,208\nmove the window, right.\n\n167\n00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,870\nBut if you want to have some\nsort of initial position,\n\n168\n00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,970\nyou specify the left most pixel and\nthe top most pixel you want in the window.\n\n169\n00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,720\nSo you're basically arranging\nthis corner right here.\n\n170\n00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,640\nSo that's why my numbers are nice and\nlow right now,\n\n171\n00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,100\nif I were to move this down to the bottom\nright, the numbers would get really big.\n\n172\n00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,400\nWhen I say okay,\nthose changes are gonna take effect,\n\n173\n00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,040\nand you'll see that my PowerShell\nnow fills a lot more of my screen.\n\n174\n00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,160\nNow I can start to take advantage of\nthe high resolution that I've got, and\n\n175\n00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,020\nwhen I start to run things like\nget-windowsfeature, I'll see\n\n176\n00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,860\nthat some of the things that we're getting\ntruncated, aren't being truncated anymore.\n\n177\n00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,780\nThat it's gotta a little more room to\nwrite and it'll take advantage of that.\n\n178\n00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,630\nEspecially if your running it through\nsomething like format-wide or\n\n179\n00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,450\nother utilities.\n\n180\n00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,640\nIt gives you more room to be\nable to lay those out too.\n\n181\n00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,540\nDefinitely nice to take advantage of that.\n\n182\n00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,940\nYou'll notice in PowerShell that, it\ndoesn't really give you the ability to go\n\n183\n00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,680\nthrough and\nstart manipulating things like this.\n\n184\n00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,100\nIf I manipulate it,\nsee how I have a scroll bar now?\n\n185\n00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,420\nSo even though I've made\nthe physical window smaller,\n\n186\n00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,380\nI still have a 110 wide window,\nI'm just not seeing all of it, right.\n\n187\n00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,600\nSo it doesn't actually redo my output.\n\n188\n00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,320\nSo if I start running a long command here.\n\n189\n00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,670\nSo this is going to be\na very long command.\n\n190\n00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,640\nAnd it will wrap around the screen, right.\n\n191\n00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,740\nSo I'm typing and\nsee what's happening here?\n\n192\n00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,900\nInstead of wrapping around the screen,\nit's just scrolling me over, right.\n\n193\n00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,870\nIf I made my actual window size smaller,\nif I changed it to say it was only\n\n194\n00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,830\n60 characters wide, then at 60 characters,\nit would screen wrap.\n\n195\n00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,150\nAnd it would just jump me\ndown to the next line.\n\n196\n00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,070\nBut as long as I've got my width set\nhigher, it's gonna continue to write, and\n\n197\n00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,650\nit'll create that scroll line.\n\n198\n00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,900\nSo just something to be aware of there's\nyou tweak that window to match the size\n\n199\n00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,470\nthat you need to be.\n\n200\n00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,160\nAll right,\n\n201\n00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,200\nnow these are all nice things to do,\nbump up the font size, change the font,\n\n202\n00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,510\nbump up the window size, definitely\nbump up that scroll back buffer, right.\n\n203\n00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,260\nThe vertical buffer.\n\n204\n00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,470\nThose are all things we want to adjust.\n\n205\n00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,570\nAnother thing I like to\nadjust is the color scheme.\n\n206\n00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,830\nThe color scheme of white on blue.\n\n207\n00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,800\nWell that was a prominent\none like back in the 90s,\n\n208\n00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,523\nif you ran WordStar or\nWordPerfect, like WordPerfect 5.1,\n\n209\n00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:22,760\nway back blue background,\nwhite text, really, really common.\n\n210\n00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,530\nBut in today's world it's not\nnecessarily the most common.\n\n211\n00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,240\nSo you might wanna change that to\nsome other arrangement that you like.\n\n212\n00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,020\nMicrosoft picked this one because they\nwanted to make sure that it was easy for\n\n213\n00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,290\nyou to differentiate, whether you are in\na command prompt or a PowerShell.\n\n214\n00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,970\nBut if you're not worried about that, if\nthis PS indicator right here is enough for\n\n215\n00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,080\nyou, you might wanna go back\nto the old DOS configuration.\n\n216\n00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,320\nSo you could go in here,\ninto your properties.\n\n217\n00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,870\nAnd go into colors, and here you\ncan change the color of your text,\n\n218\n00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,150\nyour background, and pop ups which\nwe don't really get in PowerShell.\n\n219\n00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:02,740\nI can take my screen text and maybe I want\nto, I'll leave that gray that's fine.\n\n220\n00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,080\nAnd then for the screen background,\nmaybe I want it to be black.\n\n221\n00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,940\nSo I'll go ahead and send it to me black\nso it looks like a regular command prompt.\n\n222\n00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,360\nNow when I say okay to that,\nthe blue is gone,\n\n223\n00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,350\nnow it looks like\na regular command prompt.\n\n224\n00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,320\nAnd I know,\nbecause I've got a PS right there,\n\n225\n00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,230\nin my prompt, that, that's all I need.\n\n226\n00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,070\nI know I'm in PowerShell, I don't need\nanything special telling me otherwise.\n\n227\n00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,990\nSo I've got all that set, and\nthe nice part about this is,\n\n228\n00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:33,020\nif I close my window and I open it again,\nit remembers it, all right.\n\n229\n00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,580\nIt's modified that shortcut to\ninclude the changes that we've made.\n\n230\n00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,840\nSo very easy to customize that user\ninterface to match what works for\n\n231\n00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,120\nyour system, and if we go and\ndo run as an administrator,\n\n232\n00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,580\nwe'll see that that gets the settings too,\nso whether you're running as just\n\n233\n00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,610\na regular user or just administrator,\nit's tied to you, your user account.\n\n234\n00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,830\nThe registry is storing these settings and\n\n235\n00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,950\nnow it will launch with\nthe settings that you want.\n\n236\n00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,920\nThe only problem with this,\nis that it's just on this one computer.\n\n237\n00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,430\nIf I go to another computer and\n\n238\n00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,230\nfire up the PowerShell, it's not gonna\nremember these settings I put in place,\n\n239\n00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,200\nand the PowerShell on the other computer\nis gonna launch the blue background, and\n\n240\n00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,050\nthe white foreground, and so\nthat's going to kind of mess things up.\n\n241\n00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,000\nSo what we need to do\nis we need to jump in,\n\n242\n00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,140\nand find a way to get this to\nwork that we can automate.\n\n243\n00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,890\nThat we can script,\n\n244\n00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,740\nthat we can have be a part of our\nuser profile that roams with us.\n\n245\n00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,490\nOr that we can at least quickly apply to\nmake these settings without having to go\n\n246\n00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,860\nthrough, and adjust it every\nsingle time we log into a system.\n\n247\n00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,190\nSo that's what I want to show you next.\n\n248\n00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,600\nBut what you've seen so\nfar like using the graphical interface and\n\n249\n00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,730\nit's definitely the easiest.\n\n250\n00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,190\nYou just browse through,\npick your options and you're done.\n\n251\n00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,160\nAll right.\n\n252\n00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,540\nSame thing works for\nthe regular Windows command prompt.\n\n253\n00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,000\nSo if you wanna customize\nthat you can too.\n\n254\n00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,650\nSame exact process based on the GUI.\n\n255\n00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,240\nRight.\n\n256\n00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,290\nFrom the regular command prompt though,\nthat's the only way you've got.\n\n257\n00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,500\nIn PowerShell,\n\n258\n00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,010\nwe actually have a series of command lists\nwe can use to do the same customization.\n\n259\n00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,470\nBefore we do that though, I want to go\nahead and reset my shell back to default.\n\n260\n00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,240\nAnd there's not really a great easy way to\ndo it when I've overwritten it in the GUI.\n\n261\n00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,128\nSo let's do this, let's stop and take a\nquick break, I'll reset my PowerShell back\n\n262\n00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,368\nto the defaults, and when we get back,\nI'll show you how to do that same\n\n263\n00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:22,611\nprocess again, but this time we'll\nuse PowerShell commands to do it.\n\n264\n00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:24,888\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n265\n00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,280\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n266\n00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,712\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n267\n00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,659\nSo what I did is I went ahead and\ntook my PowerShell, and\n\n268\n00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,634\njust reverted it back to the basic\nconfiguration like we'd expect when we\n\n269\n00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:43,450\nlaunch the PowerShell the first time.\n\n270\n00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,320\nWell, I did that for almost everything.\n\n271\n00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,290\nI went ahead and\nleft the font size to the larger size.\n\n272\n00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,180\nFont size is a really weird thing.\n\n273\n00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,210\nThere are no PowerShell commands\nthat'll let us manipulate the font\n\n274\n00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,270\nsize inside of the PowerShell\nconsole itself.\n\n275\n00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,080\nThat's actually controlled\nby the Window's kernel.\n\n276\n00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,930\nSo if I wanted to adjust\nthe font size programmatically,\n\n277\n00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,760\nyou have to do a really advanced\ncall to the kernel, and\n\n278\n00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,800\nit's not something that necessarily\nworks on all of the Microsoft systems.\n\n279\n00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,050\nSo it's not recommended.\n\n280\n00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,630\nWell for me that's okay because\n\n281\n00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,440\nI normally pick a different font size\nbased on the resolution that I'm using.\n\n282\n00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,005\nSo when I go from computer to computer I\ndon't necessarily know what the screen\n\n283\n00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:25,408\nresolution is gonna be, so I've just\ngotten into the habit of setting that\n\n284\n00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,800\nfont size manually, right,\nwe saw that in the GUI.\n\n285\n00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,520\nWe pulled up the GUI here.\n\n286\n00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,400\nWe can go into properties, and\nwe can go into the font, and\n\n287\n00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,188\nwe can bump that size up right\nthere pretty straightforward, but\n\n288\n00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:40,080\nprogrammatically in PowerShell we don't\nhave a great way to do that, all right.\n\n289\n00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,310\nEverything else, though, the foreground\ncolor, the background color,\n\n290\n00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,290\nthe scroll back buffer, the window size,\nall of that, we can customize.\n\n291\n00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:49,820\nAll right.\n\n292\n00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,880\nAnd then there's even some other\nthings that we can customize too,\n\n293\n00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,550\nthat go beyond what we see up\nhere in the properties screen,\n\n294\n00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,480\nright, there are only so many different\noptions in there to manipulate.\n\n295\n00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,760\nThere's a few more that we can do.\n\n296\n00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,860\nAll right.\n\n297\n00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,850\nNow I mentioned that when I\ngo from computer to computer,\n\n298\n00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,850\nI don't like to have to go through and\ndo all these customizations over again, so\n\n299\n00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,650\nI have a little script that I carry\naround, and I run this quick script and\n\n300\n00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,760\nit configures the prompt\nthe way that I want it.\n\n301\n00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,060\nIt does it programmatically, so I don't\nhave to go and find all those options.\n\n302\n00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,270\nLet me show you the script,\nI could go through and\n\n303\n00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,890\ntype the commands here one at a time.\n\n304\n00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,170\nBut I guess, let's do that.\n\n305\n00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,390\nLet's kind of go through it and\nsee what happens.\n\n306\n00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,360\nWhen we go through and\nwe do this type of a configuration,\n\n307\n00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,120\nwe're punching in these values, and we\nhave to remember a few little caveats and\n\n308\n00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,790\nI'll show you what I mean but let me\njust pull this document up right here.\n\n309\n00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,958\nSo that we can see what I'm about to do.\n\n310\n00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,685\nSo here's my script that runs whenever\nI sit down on a new computer and\n\n311\n00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,958\nkind of fire it up and\nstart to work with things.\n\n312\n00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,542\nI launch this script and\nI start to do my configuration.\n\n313\n00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:54,333\nLet's see if I can get\nmy window aligned here.\n\n314\n00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,802\nAll right, so, when I go through and\ndo this configuration,\n\n315\n00:15:57,802 --> 00:16:02,292\nI'm basically sending the same things\nwe saw in the GUI Just programatically.\n\n316\n00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:06,078\nThe issue with doing it programatically\nis that the commands, the parameters,\n\n317\n00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,870\nthat we have to modify,\nthey can be kind of long.\n\n318\n00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,060\nSo I normally define a few variables to\nmake that a little bit easier for me.\n\n319\n00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,480\nThe majority of the settings\nare all controlled by the $host.\n\n320\n00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,440\nThat's a variable that points\nto our computer, right,\n\n321\n00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,220\nso our computer.UI.RawUI right?\n\n322\n00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,070\nThat's the user interface.\n\n323\n00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,090\nAnd so that's where pretty much\nall of the settings we're gonna\n\n324\n00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,930\nmanipulate are located, all right?\n\n325\n00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,250\nWell, I usually create a little\nshortcut variable that points to it and\n\n326\n00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,610\nthat's what I'm doing right here,\nconsole = $host.UI.RawUI.\n\n327\n00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,340\nSo, now for every other command I don't\nhave to type that all the way out.\n\n328\n00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,270\nI can just type $console, right?\n\n329\n00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,080\nIt's a simple variable.\n\n330\n00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,887\nAnd if we jump over here,\nI can throw that in, and\n\n331\n00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:49,570\nnow I've got that variable created, right.\n\n332\n00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,548\nThat's exciting.\n\n333\n00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:54,000\nWell, from there,\nwe can start to set our other things.\n\n334\n00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,580\nAll right.\n\n335\n00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,730\nAnd you'll see that that's what\nI do on my next two lines,\n\n336\n00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,981\nis I call the dollar sign console., so I'm\nmodifying a parameter of the raw UI and\n\n337\n00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:06,980\nI'm changing foreground color to green and\nbackground color to black.\n\n338\n00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,620\nI like the old green screens that we had\non monochrome systems back in the day.\n\n339\n00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,180\nIt's a little bit easier for\nme to read and so that's what I do.\n\n340\n00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,460\nI just kind of change it.\n\n341\n00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,210\nAnd most colors,\nyou can just refer to by name.\n\n342\n00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,590\nLike this, green, black, or whatever.\n\n343\n00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,460\nThere are some that aren't included and\nthere's other ways you can specify\n\n344\n00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,400\nthe color, too, like doing an actual, the\nPantone codes or whatever they're called.\n\n345\n00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,750\nSo you can put various things in there,\n\n346\n00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,900\nRGB values,\nthat's the one I'm thinking of.\n\n347\n00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,620\nBut I usually just do the names because\nI can't remember the RGB values.\n\n348\n00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,930\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and apply these.\n\n349\n00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,220\nNow, these are applying\nright against the console.\n\n350\n00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,000\nSo, the console is applying as the raw UI.\n\n351\n00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,330\nThis should basically\ntake effect immediately.\n\n352\n00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,490\nWhen I make these changes,\nif I come over here and paste those in,\n\n353\n00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,360\nI see after running this command,\nmy foreground changed to green, all right,\n\n354\n00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,760\nand after running this command,\nmy background changed to black.\n\n355\n00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,210\nBut, notice what it did there,\nmy whole background isn't black,\n\n356\n00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,365\njust part of my background.\n\n357\n00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:11,590\nPowerShell doesn't\nupdate the whole screen.\n\n358\n00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,820\nWhenever you generate some new data, it\nonly updates the parts of the screens that\n\n359\n00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,100\nit has to, so everything that is\nrefreshing from now on will have a black\n\n360\n00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,160\nbackground, but I'm gonna see\na lot of artifacts like this.\n\n361\n00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,140\nIf I run get- service, right,\nit's gonna go and get that.\n\n362\n00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,500\nAnd see how part of my screen is\nstill blue there at the bottom, and\n\n363\n00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,270\neven on the sides and that's because\nit didn't write to those areas.\n\n364\n00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,240\nSo, I really need to clear\nmy screen first to do it.\n\n365\n00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,040\nAnd I can just use the clear shortcut,\nI'll just type clear, and that'll wipe it\n\n366\n00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,220\nout, and now my whole screen will be\ngreen foreground, black background.\n\n367\n00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,780\nJust for reference,\nthe clear command is actually an alias.\n\n368\n00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,460\nIt's an alias for the Clear-Host command.\n\n369\n00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,460\nSo, that's the commandlet\nthat's actually tied to that.\n\n370\n00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,610\nSo you could run either one They\ndo the same thing, all right.\n\n371\n00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,420\nSo those changes took effect right away.\n\n372\n00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:09,270\nA lot of the other changes that we might\nwanna make don't take effect right away.\n\n373\n00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,030\nWe may need to designate a width and\na height, and then apply them together.\n\n374\n00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,860\nAnd that's what I do for the rest of\nmy file, is I tackle the scrollback or\n\n375\n00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,160\nthe buffer, right?\n\n376\n00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,641\nSo the scrollback buffer is tied\nunder host.UI.RawUI.BufferSize.\n\n377\n00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:28,446\nAnd so\nhere I'm just defining another variable,\n\n378\n00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:33,130\na variable called scrollback that\npoints to that buffer size, all right.\n\n379\n00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,720\nAnd so I'll come over here and\nI'll define that one.\n\n380\n00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,690\nAnd down a little bit we'll have another\none, let's see, right here, $window.\n\n381\n00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,540\nThis is going to be the window size,\nand much like the scrollback,\n\n382\n00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,580\nI'm just pointing it to\n$console.WindowSize.\n\n383\n00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,200\nSo now I can just reference scrollback and\nwindow, and\n\n384\n00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,120\nthose will basically refer to\nthose two values, all right?\n\n385\n00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,140\nAnd we can provide our other settings.\n\n386\n00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,629\nI'm changing my scrollback\nheight to 3,000,\n\n387\n00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:03,560\nI wanna be able to scroll\nback 3,000 lines of text.\n\n388\n00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,650\nAnd then for my width, well,\nI want it to be a 110.\n\n389\n00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,350\nI want my buffer to basically\ntrack a 110th of my width because\n\n390\n00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,480\nthat's what I want my\nwindow to have ultimately.\n\n391\n00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,190\nI want it to be a 110 characters wide,\nall right?\n\n392\n00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,100\nWell, I can go and throw that and\nthere's my scrollback settings, all right?\n\n393\n00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,950\nI can do the same thing with\nmy window width and height.\n\n394\n00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,309\nNow I'm going to set these to 110 and 35.\n\n395\n00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,030\nYou do have to be a little\nbit careful here.\n\n396\n00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,210\nThis is a problem I ran into before\nthe show, my script was failing and\n\n397\n00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,270\nI couldn't figure out why.\n\n398\n00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,260\nWhat was going on is when\nyou set that window height,\n\n399\n00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,550\nif you it do it programmatically in\nPowerShell it looks at your screen and\n\n400\n00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,510\nit figures out how many lines\nyou can render on your screen.\n\n401\n00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,450\nAnd if you set this number to\nsomething higher than what'll\n\n402\n00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,960\nactually fit on the screen, when you go\nto apply it you'll get an error, right.\n\n403\n00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,750\nThat doesn't happen in the GUI.\n\n404\n00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,300\nYou can go in the GUI and\nin here if I go to layout\n\n405\n00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,720\nI can take something like my height and\nI can make it insanely tall.\n\n406\n00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,800\nI can go to 100 lines.\n\n407\n00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,520\nThat's way more than\nwhat'll fit on my screen.\n\n408\n00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,310\nOh, apparently I just did the wrong thing.\n\n409\n00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,670\nLet me go back to that.\n\n410\n00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,030\nAnd, well, it didn't let me go that high.\n\n411\n00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,090\nLet's just go something smaller then.\n\n412\n00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,392\n40.\nAll right.\n\n413\n00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:20,090\nSo, I'll set my window height\nsize to have a height of 40 and\n\n414\n00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,880\nsee how it's off the bottom of my screen.\n\n415\n00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,580\nI can't see the bottom of that window.\n\n416\n00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,010\nAnd the GUI is perfectly\nhappy letting you do that.\n\n417\n00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,880\nBut when you do it programmatically,\n\n418\n00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,490\nit is gonna hold you to what\nwill fit on your screen.\n\n419\n00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,620\nSo make sure that you put a value\nthat fits within that range.\n\n420\n00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,380\nSo I'm gonna do 35.\n\n421\n00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,740\nI think I can actually\nfit 36 on this screen but\n\n422\n00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,540\nI'll go 35 for right now just to set it.\n\n423\n00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,810\nSo I've got that window height and\nwindow width setting.\n\n424\n00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,140\nNow when I did the foreground color and\nthe background color,\n\n425\n00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,820\nthey took effect right away, but\nwhen I did these they didn't take effect.\n\n426\n00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,550\nNow why is that?\n\n427\n00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,160\nWell, when I did foreground and\nbackground,\n\n428\n00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,490\nI tied those right to $console,\nright, which pointed to my raw UI.\n\n429\n00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,055\nIn this case,\nI've tied these To $window and\n\n430\n00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:11,800\n$scrollback so they didn't actually\napply all the way upstream yet.\n\n431\n00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,430\nThat's why the changes\naren't in effect right now.\n\n432\n00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,070\nIf I want that to happen I've gotta\nbasically tie those variables together.\n\n433\n00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,530\nAnd so we can do that.\n\n434\n00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,477\nHere I'm gonna take $scrollback and\nI'll set it equal to $console., or wait,\n\n435\n00:22:26,477 --> 00:22:27,831\nthat's not correct.\n\n436\n00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:29,340\nHere, other way around.\n\n437\n00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,140\nI need $console.BufferSize\nto equal $scrollback.\n\n438\n00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,850\nThat's the opposite of what was up here,\nright.\n\n439\n00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,080\nInstead of mapping my new\nvariable to the old one,\n\n440\n00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,260\nI need to map my old variable to\nthe new one to get the new settings.\n\n441\n00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,450\nAnd so I'll just come over here,\nand I'll do that.\n\n442\n00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,280\nAll right, notice my scroll\nbars down here just updated\n\n443\n00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,060\nto reflect that larger buffer, right.\n\n444\n00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,120\nSo my larger buffer is now in play.\n\n445\n00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,230\nIt's active.\n\n446\n00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,350\nAnd I'm ready to go.\n\n447\n00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,660\nI need to do the same thing\nwith my window size, and so\n\n448\n00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,990\nright here I've got\n$console.WindowSize = $window.\n\n449\n00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,990\nAnd I'll apply that one too.\n\n450\n00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,370\nAnd there goes my window resizing.\n\n451\n00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,220\nAnd now I've got a PowerShell that fits\npretty much my whole screen, right.\n\n452\n00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,200\nThat's a good size for that PowerShell and\nmy buffers are aligned with it and\n\n453\n00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,500\neverything's in place.\n\n454\n00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,580\nNow when I start running things\nlike get-service, right,\n\n455\n00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,070\nit's got a lot more room to play.\n\n456\n00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,150\nNow, get-service the table\nformat here is still not\n\n457\n00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,680\ndividing everything out quite properly.\n\n458\n00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:37,668\nSo, what I might wanna do is pipe that\ninto format-table with a little -auto and\n\n459\n00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:42,014\nwhen you do that it'll\nrealign that table so\n\n460\n00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:46,375\nthat it fits the screen\na little bit better.\n\n461\n00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,710\nSo see up here where some of these were\ngetting truncated, now they aren't.\n\n462\n00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,083\nLet's take one like Win RM right there.\n\n463\n00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:59,375\nSo I'm going to do get-service, Win rm.\n\n464\n00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,542\nAnd you'll see that it's truncated.\n\n465\n00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:03,826\nI've got the little three dot\nellipsis right there, but\n\n466\n00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:07,112\nif I pipe that into Format-Table -Auto,\nin other words\n\n467\n00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:11,149\nautomatically determine the width of\nthe columns now it pulls it up and\n\n468\n00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:15,802\nit's rearranged everything on the screen\nand so it can write it all the way out and\n\n469\n00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:20,230\nit took out all that extra space like\nall this empty space right here.\n\n470\n00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,930\nThat's really useful when you're\nrunning a command that has a lot of\n\n471\n00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,450\noutput like more output than\nwhat will fit on the screen.\n\n472\n00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,800\nSo, now we can start to take\nadvantage of the rest of those cells.\n\n473\n00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,930\nIt will go all the way up to 110 wide\nversus the other one that's still kind of\n\n474\n00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,750\nholding itself here to that\n80 characters from earlier.\n\n475\n00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,610\nAl lright.\nSo, now we've adjusted our window size and\n\n476\n00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,620\nwe've adjusted our font size, and so\nthat stuff is pretty cool, right.\n\n477\n00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,700\nWe've also adjusted our buffer size,\nso those are all kind of in place.\n\n478\n00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,910\nFont size was the only one that\nwe couldn't do programatically,\n\n479\n00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,100\nthe other ones we could I don't\nnormally stop here though.\n\n480\n00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,310\nYou might have noticed in my script\nthat I had a few other entries in there.\n\n481\n00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,200\nLet's see where is that?\n\n482\n00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,410\nHere we go.\n\n483\n00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,340\nSo right here in the middle I\nhave $MaximumHistoryCount = 150.\n\n484\n00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:05,940\nAll right?\n\n485\n00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:12,110\nThe maximum history count by default\nin PowerShell is 64 commands.\n\n486\n00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,900\nI like to record more.\n\n487\n00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,580\nI like to have a little\nmore history in there so\n\n488\n00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,510\nthat I can pull this\nbackup when I need them.\n\n489\n00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,410\nSo I usually bump it up to about 150.\n\n490\n00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:24,690\nThat's pretty handy cause if you started\nto exceed that amount of commands well,\n\n491\n00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,290\nit'll start to override the older\nones with the newer ones.\n\n492\n00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,770\nWhich, if I spell it right,\nthat command will actually work.\n\n493\n00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,260\nWell I've got a whopping 22\ncommands in my history, so\n\n494\n00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,972\nit's not anything spectacular right now,\nbut I can bump that up just by saying\n\n495\n00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:41,800\n$MaximumHistoryCount = 150, and\nnow it'll track the previous 150 commands.\n\n496\n00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,070\nThe last thing that I like to modify,\nis the prompt itself.\n\n497\n00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,080\nRight here it says PS C:\\.\n\n498\n00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,870\nSo it's got PS to let me\nknow I'm in power shell.\n\n499\n00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,580\nAnd then it's got the current path, C:\\.\n\n500\n00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,680\nYou can change that prompt\nto be whatever you want.\n\n501\n00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,900\nWhen the prompt is displayed,\nit's actually calling a function.\n\n502\n00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,770\nThere's a function called Prompt.\n\n503\n00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,715\nAnd if we do like Get-Command.\n\n504\n00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:15,845\n[SOUND] When we look in here and\nit lists like all the various functions,\n\n505\n00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:19,555\nwell actually it's an alias name so\nit won't show up in there.\n\n506\n00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:22,503\nBut basically,\nthere's a function called Prompt.\n\n507\n00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:25,450\nAnd that's what it's pulling\nto be able to adjust that.\n\n508\n00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,430\nWe should be able to do\na get dash help for prompt.\n\n509\n00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,540\nLet's see if that works for us.\n\n510\n00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,150\nThere we go, so it's just telling us that\nwe could call that prompt function and\n\n511\n00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,710\nit dictates exactly what's going to be on\nour prompt, and it's got some links to\n\n512\n00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,620\nMicrosoft's page to help you a bit,\nbut let me just show you how it works.\n\n513\n00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,400\nIn my script,\nI'm actually overriding my prompt and\n\n514\n00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,620\nchanging it, and so what I'm doing is\nI'm basically saying the prompt as it is\n\n515\n00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,640\ndoesn't necessarily have all the stuff\nthat I want, so I'm going to change it.\n\n516\n00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,130\nSo, I call function Prompt,\nand then squiggly brackets.\n\n517\n00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,190\nOnce you get in the squiggly brackets,\n\n518\n00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,060\nanything that you put between\nwill become your new prompt.\n\n519\n00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,980\nAnd that will replace the existing prompt.\n\n520\n00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,490\nAnd because it's a squiggly bracket or\n\n521\n00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,210\ncurly bracket,\nyou can put all sorts of things in there.\n\n522\n00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,680\nYou can call other commandlets to\ngenerate whatever's gonna be represented.\n\n523\n00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,260\nWhen they run it, they're just doing\na little text field that says PS and\n\n524\n00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,271\nthey're doing a, I believe it's\nGet-Location that pulls the path.\n\n525\n00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:26,093\nLet me just verify that.\n\n526\n00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:28,090\nYeah, get-location.\n\n527\n00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,776\nSo, when you run get-location,\nthat pulls the path you're on.\n\n528\n00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:31,752\nSo, that's all they're doing.\n\n529\n00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:36,627\nThey're saying display the text PS and\na space and then run Get-Location and\n\n530\n00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:37,692\nput the path in.\n\n531\n00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:40,180\nThen stick a greater than sign on the end.\n\n532\n00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,040\nRight, that's the default prompt.\n\n533\n00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:50,120\nBut we could say function\nprompt { This is my prompt,\n\n534\n00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,430\nlike that and well oh shoot,\nI wasn't syntactically correct so\n\n535\n00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,410\nit's just dropped it to have that\nbasic PS at the very beginning.\n\n536\n00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,670\nI probably need to change this\nto be more of a Write-Host.\n\n537\n00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,010\nAnd then put that in parentheses,\nor in quotation marks, there we go.\n\n538\n00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,570\nThere.\n\n539\n00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,010\nSo now, every time I press enter, see how\nit's showing me, this is my prompt and\n\n540\n00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,640\nthen I get the PS so\nI can put whatever I want in there.\n\n541\n00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,300\nTo be able to do that.\n\n542\n00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,180\nWell, we have to be a little bit careful,\nnotice that my prompt,\n\n543\n00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,040\nif I clear my screen my prompt\nis now two lines, right.\n\n544\n00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,900\nI get this is my prompt,\nfollowed by the actual prompt, and\n\n545\n00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,830\nthen I can start typing my command.\n\n546\n00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,180\nAnd there's no space after PS.\n\n547\n00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,070\nSo I get PS>, and\nthen I'm immediately typing my command.\n\n548\n00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,610\nAnd that can be a little confusing.\n\n549\n00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,410\nSo we normally do want to\napply a little bit of finesse.\n\n550\n00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,610\nWhen we start to modify that prompt.\n\n551\n00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,460\nAnd let me just show\nyou the one that I use.\n\n552\n00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,830\nSo, let's pull it up here.\n\n553\n00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,800\nThere we go.\n\n554\n00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,270\nSo the one that I use, I go into\nfunction prompt, and I say Write-Host.\n\n555\n00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,330\nI go ahead and leave the PS there,\n\n556\n00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,350\nbecause I do like to remember\nthat I'm in the PowerShell.\n\n557\n00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,170\nAnd then, I display a square bracket.\n\n558\n00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,590\nAnd in side of that, get-date, all right?\n\n559\n00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,650\nThe reason I do get-date is, a lot of\ntimes I will copy the stuff that I've run\n\n560\n00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,300\nand paste it places, and\nI want to remember when I did that, right?\n\n561\n00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,740\nSo I use get-date.\n\n562\n00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,390\nYou could do other things,\nlike get-location and\n\n563\n00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,380\nyou'd have your path in there, right?\n\n564\n00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,048\nAnd it would just be separated out\nby these square brackets that I've\n\n565\n00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:24,180\nstuck around it.\n\n566\n00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,810\nRight?\n\n567\n00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,970\nAnd then I have that\nclosing greater than sign.\n\n568\n00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,100\nBut I could leave that\noff if I didn't want it.\n\n569\n00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,400\nOr maybe I wanted a colon instead.\n\n570\n00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,200\nRight?\nMaybe you're coming from the Cisco\n\n571\n00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,820\nworld or whatever.\n\n572\n00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,560\nAnd you wanna have a colon or\na pound symbol or whatever.\n\n573\n00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,350\nYou could specify whatever\nvariation you wanted right there.\n\n574\n00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,400\nIt'll be perfectly happy with it.\n\n575\n00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,680\nBut it's what comes next\nthat's kind of important.\n\n576\n00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,020\nIf you're using Write-Host\nto display text on screen,\n\n577\n00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,160\nyou probably wanna add\n-NoNewLine to the end.\n\n578\n00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,510\nThat way your prompt is just on one\nline instead of two or three or four,\n\n579\n00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,580\ndepending on what all you've run.\n\n580\n00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,400\nI'm also changing the foreground\ncolor of my prompt.\n\n581\n00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,590\nI didn't have to do that, but I'm doing it\nhere just to show you guys as an example.\n\n582\n00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,050\nSo I want my prompt to be in cyan.\n\n583\n00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:14,060\nMy regular text is gonna be green, this\nwill be in cyan, very easy to tell the two\n\n584\n00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,420\napart, so I'll know when I'm looking\nat a prompt versus my actual command.\n\n585\n00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:24,526\nAnd then I'm using the return function\nto return a space at the end.\n\n586\n00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:27,520\nIt's a good idea to have a space\nto separate your commands out\n\n587\n00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,410\nfrom the prompt.\n\n588\n00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,610\nAnd so I'm just saying return and\n\n589\n00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,550\na space surrounded by quote marks there,\njust to let it know to fill that in.\n\n590\n00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,720\nAnd then I close it out, all right.\n\n591\n00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,490\nSo this is what I use, and\nI'm just going to copy that and\n\n592\n00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,790\nwe'll paste that right\nhere into our prompt.\n\n593\n00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,400\nAll right, and there's my new prompt.\n\n594\n00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,810\nI've got PS still, so\nI know I'm in Powershell.\n\n595\n00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,340\nAnd I see the date written out.\n\n596\n00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,890\nAnd I could modify get-date\nto show just time or\n\n597\n00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,020\nwhatever if you really\nwanted to manipulate that.\n\n598\n00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,460\nI then see a colon, and\nnow I can start to type my commands.\n\n599\n00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,015\nAnd so I can do Get-Help.\n\n600\n00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:06,093\nOr Get-Member,all right.\n\n601\n00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:08,240\nAnd I can start to pull up my help.\n\n602\n00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,750\nMy foreground is in green.\n\n603\n00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,970\nMy background is in black and my prompt\nis customized the way I want it and\n\n604\n00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,580\nI'm ready to rock.\n\n605\n00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,830\nSo pretty straight forward.\n\n606\n00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,350\nPretty easy to do.\n\n607\n00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,520\nNow, in my little example here,\nI have all those various settings.\n\n608\n00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,680\nI changed the buffer size.\n\n609\n00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,690\nI changed the scroll back.\n\n610\n00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,950\nI changed the window size.\n\n611\n00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,490\nI changed the coloring.\n\n612\n00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,970\nAll of that, all right?\n\n613\n00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,520\nAnd we just saw,\ngoing ahead and applying it but\n\n614\n00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,650\nthere's one problem with\nwhat were doing here.\n\n615\n00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,760\nWatch what happens if\nI close my PowerShell.\n\n616\n00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,795\nSo if I close my PowerShell and I open it\nagain, well, some of the setting stayed.\n\n617\n00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:47,945\nSome didn't.\n\n618\n00:31:47,945 --> 00:31:51,535\nMy coloring stayed, but\nmy window size is gone.\n\n619\n00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,555\nMy window size is gone.\n\n620\n00:31:53,555 --> 00:31:55,665\nMy scroll back buffer is gone.\n\n621\n00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,845\nMy prompt is gone.\n\n622\n00:31:57,845 --> 00:32:01,860\nNot every setting survives closing\nthe window and opening it again.\n\n623\n00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,720\nIn fact, here, it's really just that\nforeground and background that stayed.\n\n624\n00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,930\nEverything else has\nreverted back to default.\n\n625\n00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,750\nAll right?\n\n626\n00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,260\nSo, if we want these commands\nto always be present,\n\n627\n00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,890\nwe probably want to stick them\nin our PowerShell profile.\n\n628\n00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,487\nNow we haven't talked about\nPowerShell profiles yet, but\n\n629\n00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,609\nwhen you launch a PowerShell window,\n\n630\n00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:27,273\nthose default settings have to come from\nsomewhere, and they come from a profile.\n\n631\n00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:31,737\nAnd there's actually four different\nprofiles that are available depending on\n\n632\n00:32:31,737 --> 00:32:32,740\nyour need.\n\n633\n00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,440\nAnd so it's definitely something\nthat we need to address, but\n\n634\n00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,420\nI wanna separate that out\ninto another segment.\n\n635\n00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,450\nSo, what we really need to do is once\nwe figured out our customizations,\n\n636\n00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,510\nwe need to take them and\nput them into our profile.\n\n637\n00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,690\nAnd that's going to make it\nsurvive session after session.\n\n638\n00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,900\nYou'll be able to close your window and\nopen it again and\n\n639\n00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,870\nit will always be set\nthe way that you want.\n\n640\n00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,060\nSo if you're watching these PowerShell\nepisodes in order, stay tuned.\n\n641\n00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,280\nThe very next one we're going to show\nthose profiles and how they work.\n\n642\n00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,060\nIf you're watching them out\nof order that's fine too,\n\n643\n00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,070\njust jump over to the profile one and I'll\nshow you right in there how to save this\n\n644\n00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,360\ninto your profile so that your\ncustomizations will always be there.\n\n645\n00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,870\nSo, in this segment, we got a chance\nto see how to customize the appearance\n\n646\n00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,740\nof our power shell using the GUI,\n\n647\n00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,290\nwhich was really easy, and then we got\nto see how to do it programatically.\n\n648\n00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,520\nIt was a little more complex, but you\nhad more power and additional features,\n\n649\n00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,430\nlike changing the prompt,\nwhich are really nice.\n\n650\n00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,050\nSimple customizations to make\nthe PowerShell a more friendly\n\n651\n00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:32,930\nenvironment for us.\n\n652\n00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,610\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n653\n00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,072\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n654\n00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:44,830\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:08,361\n[SOUND]\nIn\n\n2\n00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:12,030\nthis segment we're gonna take\na look at PowerShell user profiles.\n\n3\n00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,041\nI know in some of our other segments I've\nmentioned how we can put changes into\n\n4\n00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:19,067\neffect in PowerShell and\nthen when we close PowerShell and\n\n5\n00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,750\nopen it again those changes are gone.\n\n6\n00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,500\nAnd the way that we prevent that, the way\nthat we get settings to stay present from\n\n7\n00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,880\nsession to session,\nis by putting them into a profile.\n\n8\n00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,220\nA profile is simply a,\nwell it's a file, is really a script,\n\n9\n00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,740\nit's a PowerShell script, that runs\nevery time you launch PowerShell.\n\n10\n00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,860\nAnd these are happening in the background\nand you don't even know it.\n\n11\n00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,400\nWhen you launch PowerShell, there's\nactually four different scripts that run\n\n12\n00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,870\nto make the console prompt that you see,\n\n13\n00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,230\nto set things the way that you\nwant them when you get in there.\n\n14\n00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,700\nWhy four scripts?\n\n15\n00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,865\nWell there's different types.\n\n16\n00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:58,838\nFor example they're actually\ndivided into two categories.\n\n17\n00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:03,596\nThere are some profiles that run just for\nyou, the user, and\n\n18\n00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:09,580\nthere are other profiles that run for\neverybody, it's global.\n\n19\n00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,890\nAnd there's scripts that run just for\nuser accounts,\n\n20\n00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,290\nlike yourself, and there's scripts that\nrun for user accounts and programs.\n\n21\n00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,310\nRight, remember that you're not the only\nperson that can use the PowerShell.\n\n22\n00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,520\nA lot of other programs will too.\n\n23\n00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,827\nMicrosoft Exchange is\na great example of that.\n\n24\n00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:29,242\nIn Microsoft Exchange if you\nlaunch the GUI and you go in and\n\n25\n00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:32,240\nyou right click on a mailbox and\nyou choose delete,\n\n26\n00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,512\nwell, it doesn't actually just go and\ndelete it through a direct call.\n\n27\n00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:40,532\nIt actually calls the PowerShell, and it\nruns the, I think it's remove-mailbox, or\n\n28\n00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:43,540\nsomething like that, to remove\nthe mailbox and get out of there.\n\n29\n00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,880\nSo it's using the PowerShell too.\n\n30\n00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,043\nSo when you set one of\nthese scripts to run,\n\n31\n00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:51,290\nyou may not want it to run when\nExchange is using the PowerShell,\n\n32\n00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,137\nyou just want it to run when\nusers to use the PowerShell.\n\n33\n00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:58,032\nSo Microsoft understands that and\nthey've given us the ability\n\n34\n00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:01,795\nto define four different scripts\nto impact how that happens.\n\n35\n00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:05,130\nAll right, let me show you\nthe scripts before we dive in.\n\n36\n00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,340\nSo, I just have a Notepad window here\nwhere I threw the script files in.\n\n37\n00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,650\nSo, each of them are kinda just listed\nhere based on who they apply to.\n\n38\n00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,510\nSo you'll see that we have some\nscripts that apply to All Users.\n\n39\n00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,680\nAnd we have other scripts that\njust apply to the Current User.\n\n40\n00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,600\nAnd then we have scripts\nthat apply to users and\n\n41\n00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,750\nshells versus ones that\njust apply to users.\n\n42\n00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,052\nNow users/shells, that shells part,\nthat means programs.\n\n43\n00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:37,506\nSo if any program calls up a shell to run\na command these will affect that too.\n\n44\n00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:41,877\nSo when I'm creating a script, maybe I\nhave a script that changes my foreground\n\n45\n00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:46,331\nand background color, changes my window\nsize, personalization stuff for me.\n\n46\n00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:48,919\nWell, for me that's great.\n\n47\n00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,520\nI want that to go on my\ncurrent user profile.\n\n48\n00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,650\nBut Exchange doesn't need to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,940\nIt doesn't care about the color\nof the command prompt.\n\n50\n00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,110\nIt doesn't care about the window size,\nit's running in the background,\n\n51\n00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,640\nwe don't even see the window so\nwho cares what color it is.\n\n52\n00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,330\nSo I wouldn't want to put\nthat in Current Users/Shells,\n\n53\n00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,270\nI'd want it to just go in\nmy own individual user.\n\n54\n00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,638\nIf I wanted all of my users to\nhave this same color layout and\n\n55\n00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:18,036\nscreen size,\nI could put it under All Users.\n\n56\n00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:22,550\nOr, if I had a change that I wanted to put\nin place in PowerShell that I wanted to\n\n57\n00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,510\naffect every single thing that uses\nthe PowerShell no matter what,\n\n58\n00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,794\nI would put it under the All Users/Shells,\nall right.\n\n59\n00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:33,877\nSo that's why we have these four\ndifferent profiles, so we can pick and\n\n60\n00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:35,590\nchoose where the stuff goes.\n\n61\n00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,581\nNow the profiles themselves are just\nstored in PowerShell scripts.\n\n62\n00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,844\nSo you'll see down here\nwhere I've got Profile.ps1.\n\n63\n00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:46,350\nOr Power-Shell_profile.ps1.\n\n64\n00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,194\nThese are the files that are stored in it.\n\n65\n00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:55,398\nAnd ps1 those are just, well those\nare Microsoft PowerShell scripts.\n\n66\n00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:57,872\nps1 stands for PowerShell version 1.0.\n\n67\n00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:00,370\nI'm running 4.0, they're still called ps1.\n\n68\n00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,890\nThat's just kinda how it is.\n\n69\n00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,934\nSo you'll see that kinda layout sometimes,\nit's a little bit odd.\n\n70\n00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:09,050\nI've got some stray hyphens in here,\nI'm gonna get rid of those.\n\n71\n00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,494\nThat'll cause some problems.\n\n72\n00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:14,829\nAll right, so basically those\nare what are going to help me to\n\n73\n00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:18,450\ndefine what runs under what scenarios.\n\n74\n00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,012\nIf it's something like my own\npersonal user customizations, font,\n\n75\n00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,400\ncolor, the prompt,\n\n76\n00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,360\nthe actual value of the window size, that\nstuff I'm going to put under current user.\n\n77\n00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,510\nAnd so\nI'm going to browse into my user profile.\n\n78\n00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,590\nAnd in my user profile\ninside of Documents,\n\n79\n00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,570\nI'll have a folder called\nWindows PowerShell.\n\n80\n00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,548\nAnd inside that Windows PowerShell folder,\nI'll have a file called\n\n81\n00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:45,604\nMicrosoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1, and\nthat's gonna be it.\n\n82\n00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:49,694\nI'll see that file, and that's the script\nthat's gonna run when my system runs.\n\n83\n00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:54,010\nNow, if I go and look for\nthat right now, I may not have it.\n\n84\n00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,114\nA lot of these profiles don't exist, and\n\n85\n00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:59,432\nthat means there is no script that\nruns when we launch the system.\n\n86\n00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:04,293\nThat it's just gonna go with the defaults,\nso don't be surprised if you go into your\n\n87\n00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:09,280\nprofile and you go into Documents, and you\ndon't have a Windows PowerShell folder.\n\n88\n00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,797\nI don't because I haven't\ncustomized any settings.\n\n89\n00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:15,298\nAnd if we look, we may actually\nfind that none of these exist.\n\n90\n00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,663\nSo if I take the one that's\nCurrent User/Shells,\n\n91\n00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:20,830\nwell that would be in this\nWindowsPowerShell folder also.\n\n92\n00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,810\nYou know, I've got a few mistakes.\n\n93\n00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,791\nLooks like my system went\na little hyphen crazy here.\n\n94\n00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,990\nSo let me just rearrange some of those.\n\n95\n00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,912\nThere we go.\n\n96\n00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:33,120\nAnd so anyhow, so we can find those files.\n\n97\n00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,190\nIn this case,\nboth of these two are missing.\n\n98\n00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,990\nThe current user ones don't exist.\n\n99\n00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,490\nI'm just running with default.\n\n100\n00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,350\nWell what about the all users one?\n\n101\n00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,890\nWell the all user ones\nthey're tucked away under\n\n102\n00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,490\nyour Windows installation folder/system32.\n\n103\n00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,087\nAnd then you'll see\nWindows PowerShell in there.\n\n104\n00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:54,771\nSo if I go and take a look at that,\nI'll just browse to\n\n105\n00:05:54,771 --> 00:06:00,201\nC://Windows/System32/PowerShell well\nI can see,\n\n106\n00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,975\nwait, it's not PowerShell.\n\n107\n00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:06,160\nIt's WindowsPowerShell, there we go.\n\n108\n00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120\nWhen I browse in there,\nI've got a Version 1.0 folder.\n\n109\n00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,422\nNow, I am running PowerShell version 4.0.\n\n110\n00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:16,010\nWell, this is one of those spots were\nMicrosoft kinda made a little mistake.\n\n111\n00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,950\nThey put the version number in the path\nfor a file that PowerShell depends on,\n\n112\n00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,206\nand they didn't want you to have\nto maintain separate profiles for\n\n113\n00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:27,334\neach version of the PowerShell,\n\n114\n00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:31,745\nso they decided just to stick with\nthe version 1.0 for all of them.\n\n115\n00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:34,166\nNow, we're locked into that, and\nthey don't wanna change that,\n\n116\n00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,789\ncuz it'll break backwards compatibility.\n\n117\n00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,977\nSo we'll probably be on\nPowerShell 23.7 one day, and\n\n118\n00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:44,350\nwe'll still be in the version 1.0 folder\nhere, so these are the things that happen.\n\n119\n00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,340\nBut if I go into that,\nI'll see there's a ton of junk in here.\n\n120\n00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,430\nYou shouldn't say junk, right?\n\n121\n00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,332\nThere's a ton of technology waiting to be\nused in here, and if we take a look at it,\n\n122\n00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:56,047\nwe may or\nmay not actually find the profiles.\n\n123\n00:06:56,047 --> 00:07:01,747\nSo if I'm looking in here, I'm going to\nlook for profile.ps1 and I don't see it.\n\n124\n00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:07,014\nAnd I'm going to look for the Microsoft\none, and I probably won't see it either.\n\n125\n00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,759\nI guess I could've just looked for\nany script.\n\n126\n00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,771\nSo here's the only scripts that I\ngot right here and none of them\n\n127\n00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:17,313\nare the profile, so I actually have\nzero profiles in place right now but\n\n128\n00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,447\nyou can just create these files.\n\n129\n00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:21,467\nYou can edit them in any text editor.\n\n130\n00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,270\nAnd put them in place.\n\n131\n00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,590\nAnd now you do have a profile.\n\n132\n00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,147\nNow there's a few other ways that we\ncan go about creating it, too, so\n\n133\n00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:31,450\nI'll show you some of that\nhere in just a moment.\n\n134\n00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:38,583\nBut at it's most simple all we have\nto do is take what we want to run.\n\n135\n00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,888\nWhat commands we want to run,\nwhen we launch the PowerShell, and\n\n136\n00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:48,687\nput them in a file called profile.ps1 or\nMicrosoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 and\n\n137\n00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:51,450\nstore that in the associated directory.\n\n138\n00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,973\nAnd when we do that,\nnow every time you're in the PowerShell,\n\n139\n00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,173\nwe'll run in that scenario.\n\n140\n00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,980\nRight so, pretty,\npretty straightforward process.\n\n141\n00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,910\nAll right let's take\na look at this in action.\n\n142\n00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,731\nPersonally it's pretty rare that\nI modify most of the profiles.\n\n143\n00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:09,146\nThe only one that I ever really modify is\nthis one right here Current User because,\n\n144\n00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:10,049\nmaybe I'm selfish.\n\n145\n00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:12,210\nI don't know,\nI just care about my own settings.\n\n146\n00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,540\nI don't want to mess with my programs so I\nreally never want to mess with the shells.\n\n147\n00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,890\nAll right?\n\n148\n00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,630\nBut I usually don't want to mess with\nAll Users either because I have different\n\n149\n00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,540\npreferences than other people so\nI usually just go and set my own.\n\n150\n00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,910\nWell, when you launch the PowerShell,\nyou need a way to figure out what your,\n\n151\n00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,950\nwhat's called like a primary profile,\nthe main profile that's tied to you.\n\n152\n00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,491\nAnd there's actually a variable called\n$profile, and you can query that, and\n\n153\n00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:42,110\nit will tell you what\nyour primary profile is.\n\n154\n00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,606\nLet me show you what I mean, if I fire up\nmy PowerShell, I can just type $profile.\n\n155\n00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:51,995\nAnd when I run it,\nit's going to tell me my main profile and\n\n156\n00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:57,093\nyou'll see\nc:/user/donpezet/documents/windowspowersh-\n\n157\n00:08:57,093 --> 00:09:00,886\nell/microsoft.powershell_profile.ps1.\n\n158\n00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:03,518\nAnd if I go back to my screen here,\n\n159\n00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:08,700\nthat's the one that matches up\nwith the Current User not shells.\n\n160\n00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,058\nIt doesn't mean the other\nones didn't apply.\n\n161\n00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:11,220\nThe other ones did apply.\n\n162\n00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,580\nBut this is the one that's specific\nto me and the session that I'm in\n\n163\n00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,030\nversus one that might be more\ngeneric tied to other people.\n\n164\n00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,690\nSo, that's the one that I typically\nmodify when I want to have settings that\n\n165\n00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,950\napply to me.\n\n166\n00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,250\nAnd I want them to apply every\ntime that I launch the PowerShell.\n\n167\n00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,860\nAll right.\nSo that's\n\n168\n00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,680\nthe first thing that we need to be\naware of with PowerShell profiles,\n\n169\n00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,060\nis just the fact that there's\nmore than one of them.\n\n170\n00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,110\nThere's four.\n\n171\n00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,316\nThe next thing is, if we wanna modify it.\n\n172\n00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:41,883\nNow, I have,\nfrom another segment that we did,\n\n173\n00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:45,630\na little script that we made,\nthis guy right here.\n\n174\n00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,488\nLet me open that with Notepad.\n\n175\n00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:48,816\nHere, so here's a script.\n\n176\n00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:52,977\nWe did a segment on customizing\nthe appearance of the PowerShell.\n\n177\n00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:56,559\nAnd we went through and we changed\nour foreground and background color,\n\n178\n00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,861\nwe changed our scroll back and buffer, and\nall that good stuff, our command history.\n\n179\n00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:05,734\nAnd we even redefined our prompt, and\nthe issue was when we did this if\n\n180\n00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:10,536\nwe closed PowerShell and\nlaunched it again, we lost our commands.\n\n181\n00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:13,576\nAnd so what I want to do is I\nwant to take these commands and\n\n182\n00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:16,320\nactually store them in my profile.\n\n183\n00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,626\nSo, I could go ahead and\njust write this out,\n\n184\n00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:20,953\nthese are all the commands\nthat I want to run.\n\n185\n00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,718\nAnd I could save this as\none of these file names.\n\n186\n00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:29,563\nI could save it as this one right here and\nthat would become my profile, all right?\n\n187\n00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:34,531\nOr I could go through and create the file\nthrough the PowerShell if I wanted to,\n\n188\n00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:37,918\nin the case that,\nmaybe I've already got that file or\n\n189\n00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:41,553\nmaybe there's already settings\nthat I want to bring in.\n\n190\n00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:42,974\nThere's a few different\nways we can go about it.\n\n191\n00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:48,312\nIf you already have a profile then\nyou would just edit that file and\n\n192\n00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:51,140\nadd in the commands that you want.\n\n193\n00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,870\nSo to get that file created\nwe can manually create it or\n\n194\n00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,608\nthere is actually a little\ncommand we can run to do it.\n\n195\n00:10:56,608 --> 00:11:00,920\nLet me go to my window here, all right?\n\n196\n00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,742\nAnd in our PowerShell,\nyou can actually run New-Item.\n\n197\n00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:10,370\nThat's a command you can run to create\npretty much any item that you want and\n\n198\n00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,882\nI'm gonna tell it to create my profile.\n\n199\n00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:17,548\nSo what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nlook at that profile variable which\n\n200\n00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:20,170\nreturned my main profile.\n\n201\n00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,070\nAnd it's going to create a new item there,\nright?\n\n202\n00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,137\nSo it's going to create a new file for me.\n\n203\n00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:26,417\nAnd I can tell it that the type is file.\n\n204\n00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:30,122\nAnd I have to do that type part because\nNew-Item can create all sorts of things,\n\n205\n00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,640\nnot just files.\n\n206\n00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,360\nAnd then I can tell it -force if the file\nalready exists, this'll override it.\n\n207\n00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,330\nMine doesn't exist, so I don't technically\nneed that, but I'll go ahead and run it.\n\n208\n00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,930\nAnd it's gonna create it, right?\n\n209\n00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,920\nSo that's a quick way to get that\nfile created and in place but\n\n210\n00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,240\nlook at the length.\n\n211\n00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,020\nIt's zero, there's nothing in it.\n\n212\n00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,370\nSo it's really just creating\nan empty file and if I go and\n\n213\n00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,110\nbrowse into my Documents folder now.\n\n214\n00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,276\nNow I do have a Windows PowerShell\npath and in there,\n\n215\n00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:01,664\nthere's my PowerShell profile.\n\n216\n00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:03,447\nI could have created them by hand, but\n\n217\n00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,806\nby using the New-Item command it\nensured that I didn't get any typos.\n\n218\n00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:09,697\nIt made the path, it made the file,\nit put it in place, and\n\n219\n00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:12,110\nI know there's no typos in there.\n\n220\n00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,180\nNow I can just edit this file.\n\n221\n00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,040\nSo I'll go ahead and edit that.\n\n222\n00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,700\nAnd, oh I don't want to use the ISE.\n\n223\n00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,547\nHere let me get out of that.\n\n224\n00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:22,390\nI'm gonna open that with Notepad.\n\n225\n00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,281\nAnd it's empty, I'm just gonna paste in,\noh apparently paste in nothing.\n\n226\n00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:30,481\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna paste in that\nlittle script that we wrote in\n\n227\n00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:33,235\nthe other episode so\nthat these commands will run.\n\n228\n00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:37,560\nNow technically I don't have to run\nall of these commands every time.\n\n229\n00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,250\nSome of them actually do get saved like\nthe foreground and background color.\n\n230\n00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,696\nThose do get saved.\n\n231\n00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,695\nSo I don't technically have to run them\nevery time, but since I've never run them,\n\n232\n00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,978\nI'm gonna go ahead and put it here.\n\n233\n00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:49,166\nIt doesn't hurt to go ahead and\nrerun it over and\n\n234\n00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,830\nover again every time\nyou launch your prompt.\n\n235\n00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,520\nJust be aware the more\nthat you put in here,\n\n236\n00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,330\nthe longer it can take the prompt\nto create on the screen.\n\n237\n00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,890\nWe'll see more of that when we talk\nabout add on modules in another segment.\n\n238\n00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,550\nYou can get it where launching\nPowerShell can take several minutes and\n\n239\n00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,560\nthat's super frustrating.\n\n240\n00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,870\nIf you've ever worked\nwith Microsoft Exchange,\n\n241\n00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,520\nyou know where I'm coming from on that.\n\n242\n00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,950\nBut things like this, just simple\nmodifications, that'll only take a second,\n\n243\n00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,830\nnot even seconds it'll\nbe really really fast.\n\n244\n00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,630\nWe'll see here in a moment.\n\n245\n00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,589\nSo I'm gonna put all that right here in\nthis ps1 file, and I'm just gonna save it.\n\n246\n00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,100\nAll right, so that's now saved,\nthat's in my profile.\n\n247\n00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,380\nAnd basically, every time I launch\na PowerShell, it's gonna look for\n\n248\n00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,760\nthis file and it's gonna run\nthe commands that are in it.\n\n249\n00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,869\nSo I'm gonna close this PowerShell window,\nand I'll launch a new one.\n\n250\n00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,733\nAnd for a brief moment there we saw\nthat blue screen with the grey text\n\n251\n00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:46,622\nyou know that kind of layout,\nlike we had a moment ago.\n\n252\n00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:50,757\nAnd then all of a sudden it changed,\nand now I've got my new prompt and\n\n253\n00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:54,180\nI've got my new window size and\nall of that's in place and\n\n254\n00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,273\nnow I can just get in here and\nstart to work, right?\n\n255\n00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:57,944\nI can go and\n\n256\n00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:02,890\ndo all the various things that I need to\ndo in my new happy environment, right?\n\n257\n00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,089\nSo I can run get-help and\noff we go, right?\n\n258\n00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:07,691\nSo very cool.\n\n259\n00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:11,903\nVery simple way to do that, and\nnow if I go to another machine,\n\n260\n00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:14,749\nI can just copy that profile file with me.\n\n261\n00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:17,857\nAnd now the new machine will be configured\nthe same way as the old machine,\n\n262\n00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,490\nI've got my settings right in there.\n\n263\n00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,430\nOr, if I have a roaming user profile,\nthat file,\n\n264\n00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,630\nthat PowerShell profile,\nwas stored in my user profile.\n\n265\n00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,830\nSo, if I have a roaming profile and\n\n266\n00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,620\nI go to five different computers,\nmy profile roams with me and\n\n267\n00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,740\nthat means my PowerShell settings now roam\nwith me and that's pretty cool, right?\n\n268\n00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,882\nNow that only happens with the user ones,\nthe Current User ones.\n\n269\n00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:45,338\nSee how Current User, both of these\nare in the %UserProfile% variable,\n\n270\n00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:51,065\nright, my user director, versus these\nguys up here, which are %Windir%.\n\n271\n00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:53,077\nThat's where you installed Windows.\n\n272\n00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:57,430\nUsually C:\\Windows and\nthat's not gonna travel with you.\n\n273\n00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,290\nSo make sure you put your settings\n\n274\n00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,786\nin the profile that is appropriate for\nhow you use it.\n\n275\n00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,270\nAll right.\n\n276\n00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,690\nAnother little shortcut that\nI use from time to time,\n\n277\n00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,710\nI showed you how $profile\nreturns the path of the profile.\n\n278\n00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,510\nYou could also do notepad$profile and\n\n279\n00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,500\nthat's a quick way to edit that one and\nget right into it.\n\n280\n00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,880\nAnd now you can add whatever\nit is that you need.\n\n281\n00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,070\nSo if you have other commands,\nother things you want to put in place,\n\n282\n00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,530\nyou can fill them in here and\nnow you're in business.\n\n283\n00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,890\nAn example of something I like to do,\nif we do aliases, so\n\n284\n00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:41,130\nif I do a Set-Alias and I map edit to\n\n285\n00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,320\nnotepad, all right, because I type edit a\nlot and I get annoyed when I forget that.\n\n286\n00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,890\nRight?\nSo\n\n287\n00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,870\nnow I can type edit $profile and\nthat works, right?\n\n288\n00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,620\nBut remember with aliases,\nif I close my window and I open a new one\n\n289\n00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,460\nI can type, edit $profile.\n\n290\n00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,570\nAnd I get an error,\nthe aliases die when your session dies.\n\n291\n00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,655\nSo now, what I could do,\nis I could say, notepad $profile.\n\n292\n00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,040\nAnd I could just add, right here,\nyou know, really, anywhere in here.\n\n293\n00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,390\nYou've got a lot of flexibility.\n\n294\n00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,080\nI'll stick mine right at the top.\n\n295\n00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,380\nAnd I'll just say Set-Alias edit notepad.\n\n296\n00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,010\nAll right, so\n\n297\n00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:26,510\nnow that alias is part of my profile and\nI won't have to worry about creating it.\n\n298\n00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,180\nI can fire up a new PowerShell and,\n\n299\n00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,220\nyou know I probably should set\nthe window position on that one.\n\n300\n00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,830\nBut my window is constantly\nlaunching off to the side.\n\n301\n00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,820\nYou can set the starting\nwindow position to be 1,1,\n\n302\n00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,520\nwhich would be right up\nat the top left corner.\n\n303\n00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,833\nI probably should do that, but anyhow.\n\n304\n00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:48,835\nI'll do edit $profile and\nnow my alias works.\n\n305\n00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:53,075\nSo aliases, visual customizations,\n\n306\n00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:56,215\nany other types of settings, you might\nwanna change your directory, right?\n\n307\n00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,557\nThat's another one I like because it\nalways starts me off with my user profile.\n\n308\n00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:04,457\nSo I might do a Set-Location C:\\, right?\n\n309\n00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:10,993\nSo we'll pop that in there and\nnow when I launch my PowerShell.\n\n310\n00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:15,063\nWhen it launches, it normally\nlaunches to your user profile, so\n\n311\n00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:17,291\nit would be C:\\User\\DonPezet.\n\n312\n00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:22,531\nBut now if I do a Get-Location,\nI can see that I'm in C:\\.\n\n313\n00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:23,112\nRight?\n\n314\n00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:25,416\nI didn't put that in my prompt,\nso I don't see it there.\n\n315\n00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:30,548\nBut I am now in C:/, and\nI can start working right from there.\n\n316\n00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:31,129\nAll right.\n\n317\n00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:33,135\nSo, neat little customizations like that.\n\n318\n00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,525\nAnd they'll now stay as\npart of your profile.\n\n319\n00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:37,075\nSo, very cool stuff.\n\n320\n00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:39,695\nYeah, that's really about it.\n\n321\n00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:41,955\nOh, a couple little caveats,\nthings to remember.\n\n322\n00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:47,032\nFirst, the user profile, it is a script.\n\n323\n00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:47,589\nAll right?\n\n324\n00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:48,529\nIt's a ps1 file.\n\n325\n00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:49,752\nIt's a script.\n\n326\n00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:53,125\nSo, remember your script execution policy.\n\n327\n00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,248\nIf you haven't watched it, we filmed\na segment on script execution policies.\n\n328\n00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:59,729\nAnd if yours is set to restricted,\nwhich is the default,\n\n329\n00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,769\nscripts aren't allowed to run.\n\n330\n00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:03,801\nSo when you go to launch your PowerShell,\n\n331\n00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:06,192\nthe PowerShell profiles\nactually don't work.\n\n332\n00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:10,499\nIn restricted mode PowerShell\nprofiles won't run, all right.\n\n333\n00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:15,261\nIf you've put it in remote signed well,\nthe local scripts are allowed to run and\n\n334\n00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,630\nnow your profiles will work.\n\n335\n00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:24,430\nSo, if you have configured this and\nyou find that it's not working, right.\n\n336\n00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,390\nSo, if I come in here and\n\n337\n00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,581\nI do Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted.\n\n338\n00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:34,450\nAll right, so\nI'm just going to change that.\n\n339\n00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,056\nAll right, so\nnow I'm gonna launch my PowerShell.\n\n340\n00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:40,880\nAnd I immediately get an error and\nnone of my settings took effect.\n\n341\n00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,270\nIt's cuz the script wasn't allowed to run.\n\n342\n00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,030\nSo be aware of that, you do need to\nallow scripts to run in order for\n\n343\n00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,690\nthe profiles to work.\n\n344\n00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,590\nOtherwise, you will always\nget the default profile.\n\n345\n00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,050\nAll right, so those are a few little\nthings that we just need to be aware of.\n\n346\n00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,344\nThat's how the profiles work,\nthey're incredibly useful and\n\n347\n00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:01,829\nthey really help you customize\nthe PowerShell and make it your own.\n\n348\n00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:03,489\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n349\n00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:07,071\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up!\n\n350\n00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:13,419\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:07,355\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:11,554\nIn this segment we're going to take\na look at extending the functionality of\n\n3\n00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,470\nPowerShell through add-on modules.\n\n4\n00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,580\nThe PowerShell, it's pretty powerful,\nwell I guess that's the name.\n\n5\n00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,250\nBecause it's got a lot of functionality\nthat's built into it, but There\n\n6\n00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,610\nare oftentimes where you'll bump into\nthings that you need that aren't there.\n\n7\n00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,720\nAnd when Microsoft\ndesigned the PowerShell,\n\n8\n00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,000\nthey intended it to be flexible, to grow\nwith the needs of the customers, and\n\n9\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520\nthat's why they enabled\nthe ability to add on modules,\n\n10\n00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,910\nthat would basically put in\nthe functionality we were missing.\n\n11\n00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,460\nAnd that might be functionality that\nMicrosoft adds later on themselves.\n\n12\n00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,600\nOr it might be a functionality\nthat third parties add on.\n\n13\n00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,980\nAnybody can write an add on module for\nPowerShell and\n\n14\n00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,520\ncreate new commandlets, and new\nfunctionality that wasn't there before.\n\n15\n00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,670\nIt's pretty neat stuff.\n\n16\n00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,410\nAll right.\n\n17\n00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,190\nWell let's start with the official\nmodules, the ones that are built in, and\n\n18\n00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,190\nthen we'll kind of go from there.\n\n19\n00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,180\nNow, throughout this show we've\nseen several different modules,\n\n20\n00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,150\nthat really we never addressed as modules.\n\n21\n00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,820\nWe just have commandlets that\nare available and we use them.\n\n22\n00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,460\nAl lright.\n\n23\n00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,830\nWell the base modules of PowerShell are,\nthere included,\n\n24\n00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,030\nthere included with the OS.\n\n25\n00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,820\nAnd it's not just one module,\nthere's actually a good 20 or 30 modules,\n\n26\n00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,950\nthat are part of the base\ninstallation of PowerShell.\n\n27\n00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,630\nThey're up and running and\ndoing various things that you need.\n\n28\n00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,030\nAnd then as you add software,\n\n29\n00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,570\nthe software you install may\nadd additional modules too.\n\n30\n00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,150\nSo for example on my server here,\nlet's take a look at this one.\n\n31\n00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,970\nIf I fire open my command prompt, or\nmy PoweShell, and I do a Get-Command.\n\n32\n00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,320\nI'll see all the different commands\nthat i've got available, right.\n\n33\n00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,540\nAnd there is quite a few out\nhere it's quite the list, right.\n\n34\n00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,840\nAnd as I look at each command it's\ngot commandlet name, and over here on\n\n35\n00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,060\nthe right, it has some information if I\nscroll all the way to the top and look.\n\n36\n00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,150\nThat's the module name, all right.\n\n37\n00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,140\nEach of these commands\nare coming from a module.\n\n38\n00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,900\nAnd some of these\nare installed by default.\n\n39\n00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,710\nSome of these have been added.\n\n40\n00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,650\nWell, I'm in the function section here,\nlet me get down to just the commandlets.\n\n41\n00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,600\nHere we go.\n\n42\n00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,799\nSo you'll see some of these are listed\nas Microsft.PowerShell.core,\n\n43\n00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:21,390\nor\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.utility.diagnostics.\n\n44\n00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,800\nThose are the base commandlets\nthat are a part of PowerShell\n\n45\n00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,000\nthat everyone is going to have.\n\n46\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,080\nBut you start getting into some\nof these other modules like\n\n47\n00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,070\nthe ActiveDirectory module\".\n\n48\n00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,310\nNot everyone's going to have that.\n\n49\n00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,690\nMy server that I'm on right now,\nis an Active Directory domain controller.\n\n50\n00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,740\nAnd because of that, when I installed\nthe active directory management tools,\n\n51\n00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,830\nit automatically added\nthe active directory modules.\n\n52\n00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,290\nI also installed Microsoft SQL on here.\n\n53\n00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,290\nAnd, because I did that,\nwhen it set that up,\n\n54\n00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,550\nit also added some SQL tools,\nand I'll see some right here.\n\n55\n00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,368\nSQLPS, that's the SQL PowerShell,\nand so here's Get-SqlIntstance,\n\n56\n00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:05,490\nGet-SqlDatabase, right, these were added\nbecause I'm running Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n57\n00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,940\nSo one of the easiest ways to add\nadditional functionality to PowerShell,\n\n58\n00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,380\nIs just to install your software.\n\n59\n00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,060\nAll right, when you install your software,\nthese modules come along with it.\n\n60\n00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,240\nAnother example might be DNS.\n\n61\n00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,540\nSo if I take a look at any\ncommand that involves DNS.\n\n62\n00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,320\nWell I'm a DNS server, and so here's\nall these different DNS commandlets,\n\n63\n00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,420\nthat were added as a part\nof the DNS module.\n\n64\n00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,110\nRight?\n\n65\n00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,790\nWell, what about something\nthat I'm not running though?\n\n66\n00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,670\nSomething like DHCP.\n\n67\n00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,820\nWell if I wanna manage a DHCP server,\nI can do Get-Command*DHCP*.\n\n68\n00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,510\nI don't have any DHCP commandlets.\n\n69\n00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,610\nThat doesn't mean they don't exist.\n\n70\n00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,500\nI'm just not running that module,\nall right?\n\n71\n00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,180\nThere is a module for that.\n\n72\n00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,240\nI don't have it installed.\n\n73\n00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,830\nSo, I've got a couple of choices\nabout how I can add that support.\n\n74\n00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,540\nOne, I can install the DHCP server.\n\n75\n00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,820\nThat would do it.\n\n76\n00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,770\nBut what if I'm on my workstation?\n\n77\n00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,230\nI'm on a Windows 7 or\nWindows 8 machine, and\n\n78\n00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,530\nI'm wanting to manage\na server that's running DHCP.\n\n79\n00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,250\nSo I don't want to be\na DHCP server myself.\n\n80\n00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,440\nI just want to manage somebody else,\nright.\n\n81\n00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,810\nWell I need the module\nwithout installing the roll.\n\n82\n00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,200\nWell, for Microsoft services,\n\n83\n00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,640\nthey have what's called the remote\nserver administration tool, so the RSAT.\n\n84\n00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,430\nAnd the RSAT is that collection\nof utilities that you can use to\n\n85\n00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,490\nmanage the server.\n\n86\n00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,220\nAnd that collection most people\nthink of it as the GUI's, right?\n\n87\n00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,580\nIt's got all the graphical\nuser interface utilities,\n\n88\n00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,950\nfrom managing all the server roles.\n\n89\n00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,000\nBut it also has the PowerShell modules.\n\n90\n00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,090\nSo if we install the RSAT, then\n\n91\n00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,990\nwe'll be able to add in the PowerShell\nmodules from whatever pieces we want.\n\n92\n00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,510\nAnd so that's another way\nthat we can get those added.\n\n93\n00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,260\nNow when you install a module,\nthere's really not all that much to it.\n\n94\n00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,480\nA module's simply a file that gets\ncopied to one of two locations.\n\n95\n00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,820\nThere is a global module folder, that's\navailable for every user of this computer,\n\n96\n00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,640\nand then there's a module folder\nthat's available just for\n\n97\n00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,890\nyou, the individual user, all right.\n\n98\n00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,420\nSo you can have some that are just\navailable for your account and\n\n99\n00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,290\nnot other people, or\nones that are installed for everyone.\n\n100\n00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,130\nSo, when we do something\nlike installing the RSAT,\n\n101\n00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,330\nwhat we're really doing is just copying\na few modules into those folders.\n\n102\n00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,700\nLet me show you an example.\n\n103\n00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,890\nSo here I'm gonna take my user account,\nand I'm just gonna browse into my profile,\n\n104\n00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,380\nso if I go into my Don Pezet folder and\ninto Documents.\n\n105\n00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,050\nI've got my Windows PowerShell folder, and\nif you don't see that Windows PowerShell\n\n106\n00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,200\nfolder, that just means\nyou're running all defaults.\n\n107\n00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,800\nYou haven't added anything, right?\n\n108\n00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200\nAnd many people will see that.\n\n109\n00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,220\nBut if I go into it, I can see that\nI've got my profile right there, and\n\n110\n00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,640\nright above it I've got a Modules folder.\n\n111\n00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,020\nAnd inside of there, I can see any modules\nthat I've added, just for my account.\n\n112\n00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,360\nAnd right now, I don't have any.\n\n113\n00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,220\nI haven't added any modules just for me.\n\n114\n00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,620\nBut I know there's a ton of modules,\nthere's the active directory one, and\n\n115\n00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,480\nall those guys, where are they?\n\n116\n00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,100\nWell, they're stored in\nthe Windows directory.\n\n117\n00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,580\nIf I browse to C:/windows Slash system 32\n\n118\n00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,470\nSlash windows PoweShelll.\n\n119\n00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,561\nAnd then in the diversion 1.0 folder.\n\n120\n00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,500\nI'll see a bunch of stuff, right.\n\n121\n00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,590\nCuz this is really all\nthe PowerShell stuff.\n\n122\n00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,520\nWell what i'm looking for\nis this Modules folder.\n\n123\n00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,780\nSo that's c:/system 32\nWindowsPowerShell/Version1.0/Modules.\n\n124\n00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:31,830\nAnd in there, I'll see each module\nin its own separate folder.\n\n125\n00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,480\nSo for example,\n\n126\n00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,960\nthe DNS Server modules, they're\nright here in the DNS Server folder.\n\n127\n00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,650\nThe Active Directory modules,\nthey're right here in this folder.\n\n128\n00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,830\nAnd you can go down the line, and\n\n129\n00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,860\nkind of look at all the different\nmodules that have been installed.\n\n130\n00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,310\nThe PowerShell ones are all right here.\n\n131\n00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,430\nThe other ones like\nnetwork interface stuff.\n\n132\n00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,270\nIt's there.\n\n133\n00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,910\nNFS and so on.\n\n134\n00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,370\nEach of the modules that I currently have\navailable to me inside of PowerShell.\n\n135\n00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,430\nSo if I want to add additional modules,\nI could copy them right\n\n136\n00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,440\nhere into the folder, but\nwe normally do it through the software.\n\n137\n00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,230\nWhen we install a software package,\n\n138\n00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,740\nit automatically adds\nthe modules,so I mentioned DHCP.\n\n139\n00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,120\nIf I look at my list\nhere I don't see DHCP.\n\n140\n00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,080\nIt doesn't have a folder so\n\n141\n00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,940\nthe module's not here so\nif I want it I have to go and install it.\n\n142\n00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,400\nI'm going to fire up my server manager,\nand I'm going to go up to Manage.\n\n143\n00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,240\nActually I'll wait here.\n\n144\n00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,140\nIt's just doing it's\nlittle server query thing.\n\n145\n00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,230\nThere we go.\nI'll go to Manage and Add Roles and\n\n146\n00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,980\nFeatures.\n\n147\n00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,110\nNow I don't want to add\nthe DHCP server role.\n\n148\n00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,780\nI don't want to actually be a DHCP server.\n\n149\n00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,970\nSo, I'm gonna skip over the roles,\nand I'm gonna go right to features.\n\n150\n00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,957\nSo I'm gonna just move past this,\npast the server selection, past the roles,\n\n151\n00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:46,064\nI'm not changing anything there, and\non the feature screen, I'm gonna look for\n\n152\n00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:48,345\nthe Remote Server Administration Toolkit.\n\n153\n00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:51,665\nAnd if I scroll down,\nI'll find it right here,\n\n154\n00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:55,733\nRemote Server Administration Tools,\nand If I expand it,\n\n155\n00:07:55,733 --> 00:08:00,231\nI can find my Feature and\nRole Administration And DHCP is a role.\n\n156\n00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:05,020\nSo I'm gonna go under role administration\nand in here somewhere, I'll find DHCP.\n\n157\n00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,250\nHere's the DHCP server tools.\n\n158\n00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:12,050\nNow, most of us think of that entry as\ninstalling the graphical tools, or DHCP,\n\n159\n00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,720\nwhich it does, right?\n\n160\n00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,390\nBut, if I look at the notes over here,\nit installs the tools for\n\n161\n00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,960\nthe MMC snap-in,\nit installs some netsh commands, and\n\n162\n00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,530\nit installs a PowerShell module for\nthe DHCP server.\n\n163\n00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,546\nSo, that's exactly what I want.\n\n164\n00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:31,990\nI'm gonna check that off and hit Next,\nand then I'll let it install.\n\n165\n00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,070\nThat's gonna add the PowerShell\nmodule that I need, and\n\n166\n00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,420\nnow I'll be able to use that module.\n\n167\n00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,000\nAll right?\n\n168\n00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,850\nNow, I'm gonna give it\na moment while it does that.\n\n169\n00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,170\nIt actually takes longer\nthan it really should.\n\n170\n00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,890\nThe file that it's copying is,\nI don't know,\n\n171\n00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,090\nit's something like a massive 30 k or\nsomething.\n\n172\n00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,290\nA very tiny file, but\nit always takes forever to get that added.\n\n173\n00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,580\nI guess the GUI components probably\ntake it a little bit longer.\n\n174\n00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,410\nBut it's gonna copy over, and\n\n175\n00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,100\nwhen it's done, I should be able\nto go back to my Modules folder.\n\n176\n00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,640\nAnd I'm just going to refresh this screen.\n\n177\n00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,500\nAnd I should see, there it is,\na DHCP server folder.\n\n178\n00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,150\nThat's the module that was just added.\n\n179\n00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,720\nAnd now that it's been added, I'll have\nthe DHCP commands available to me.\n\n180\n00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,330\nNow if I go back to my PowerShell\nwindow and do a Get-Command *dhcp* and\n\n181\n00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,550\nrun that, now I've got a bunch of\ncommands available, all from that module.\n\n182\n00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,410\nI didn't even have to\nreopen the PowerShell.\n\n183\n00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,910\nIt's just automatically there and\nnow it's available, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,580\nPretty cool stuff.\n\n185\n00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,575\nNow the module files themselves,\n\n186\n00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,756\nI mentioned that anybody can create them,\nright?\n\n187\n00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:43,848\nIf we go into that, you'll see\nthat there may be just one file or\n\n188\n00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:45,713\nthere may be several files.\n\n189\n00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:49,917\nPowerShell modules are text files and\n\n190\n00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:53,594\ntheir saved as a name dot PSM1 and\n\n191\n00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:58,340\nthat's pretty much all there is to them.\n\n192\n00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,330\nIf we take a look at one,\n\n193\n00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:04,040\nlike here, the DHCP Server Database,\nI'll go ahead and edit that one.\n\n194\n00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,200\nYou'll see that it's written as basically\nan XML file and it's just laying out\n\n195\n00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,310\nexactly what this command is, so\nhere's some static commandlets.\n\n196\n00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,040\nI've got a verb called get.\n\n197\n00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,580\nRight?\n\n198\n00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,010\nSo here is a get command\nwith this being added.\n\n199\n00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,260\nAnd, as we go down the list,\nthis one is get computer name.\n\n200\n00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,160\nAnd then, under that,\n\n201\n00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,580\nit's showing you exactly what it's going\nto get and where that data comes from.\n\n202\n00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,300\nSo they're just defining exactly\nhow that command works and\n\n203\n00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,230\nthen how it's output works.\n\n204\n00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,660\nHow you get that information\ndisplayed back on your screen.\n\n205\n00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,820\nIt's all written here in XML and\nit's pretty easy to read.\n\n206\n00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,380\nIn this case it's pulling data and it's\nactually pulling it from the CIM database,\n\n207\n00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,960\nwhich is where the WMI stores\na lot of its data, and so\n\n208\n00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,720\nit's actually querying\nthe WMI on the backend.\n\n209\n00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,700\nWe don't see that though,\n\n210\n00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,410\nwe just see get-database, or\nget-hostname, or whatever.\n\n211\n00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,050\nIn the back end,\nit's interacting with the WMI, right?\n\n212\n00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,160\nSo Microsoft has already defined these for\nus.\n\n213\n00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,671\nWe just load them in and\nnow we've got the commands.\n\n214\n00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:08,722\nNow we can have at it and\nwhen you start managing DHCP servers,\n\n215\n00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:11,490\neven though we're not running\nthe DHCP server itself.\n\n216\n00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,280\nYou'll find that when you install\neven third party software,\n\n217\n00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,390\nthat a lot of times they'll\nadd PowerShell modules, too.\n\n218\n00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,210\nSo that is one way to go about it.\n\n219\n00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:27,690\nThe only problem with this solution\nis I had to install the GUI tools for\n\n220\n00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,280\nthe DHCP server also,\nand I may not want that.\n\n221\n00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,870\nIf I just want the PowerShell\nmodule files and\n\n222\n00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,430\nthat's it, I can copy that folder\nthat was in the modules folder.\n\n223\n00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,390\nCopy it, and then uninstall\nthe management tools for DHCP.\n\n224\n00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,640\nThen I can just put this folder back, and\n\n225\n00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,320\nnow I'll just have those PowerShell\ncommandlets, and that's it.\n\n226\n00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440\nSo there's a few different ways you\ncan go about it to get that in place.\n\n227\n00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,870\nSo, but that is basically how it works.\n\n228\n00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,320\nThese modules,\nthey really do extend that functionality.\n\n229\n00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,230\nNow, that's great,\nwhat we just saw right there, right?\n\n230\n00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,090\nEasily added in a Microsoft one, we got\nadditional functionality out of, out if.\n\n231\n00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,713\nThat's wonderful, right?\n\n232\n00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:11,073\nBut, where things get really powerful\nis where you go out to the internet and\n\n233\n00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:15,028\nthird party companies, and\nother individuals just like yourself,\n\n234\n00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:19,528\nhave written some great PowerShell\nmodules that do some kind of enhancement,\n\n235\n00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:22,867\nsomething that's not offered\nin the stock solution, and\n\n236\n00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,963\nyou can use those to really\nachieve some neat things.\n\n237\n00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:27,046\nAll right?\n\n238\n00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,743\nFor example, in one of the shows earlier,\nI mentioned how setting the Windows\n\n239\n00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:36,960\nposition for your PowerShell screen is not\nsomething that's very easy to do, right?\n\n240\n00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,190\nIt doesn't really give us a great\nway to position it on the screen.\n\n241\n00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,230\nBut there's a third\n\n242\n00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,380\nparty commandlet out there called\nset-windowposition, that does it.\n\n243\n00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,020\nSomebody went and\n\n244\n00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,860\nactually wrote the commandlet that\nwould provide that functionality.\n\n245\n00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,930\nIt's not present in PowerShell,\nbut you can add it on.\n\n246\n00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,360\nAlright, one that I actually used myself\nis one that's called find string.\n\n247\n00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:04,963\nIn PowerShell,\nyou have a command called Select-String.\n\n248\n00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:07,916\nThe commandlet, Select-String,\n\n249\n00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:12,720\nwhat it does is it lets you\nfind a text string in files.\n\n250\n00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,220\nIt's very much like the Linux or\nUnix grep command, or g-rep or\n\n251\n00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,130\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n252\n00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,800\nWhere it will scan across any number of\nfiles and return every line that contains\n\n253\n00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,930\na string of characters that you provide\nit with, right, and it does a good job.\n\n254\n00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,630\nIt works pretty well.\n\n255\n00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,840\nBut, there's one thing it doesn't do, and\nthat's what's called match highlighting.\n\n256\n00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,470\nMatch highlighting is where it actually\nhighlights exactly the words that we've\n\n257\n00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,280\nreferenced that match it.\n\n258\n00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,610\nAnd so\nthere's a third party commandlet out there\n\n259\n00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,680\nthat does basically the same\nthing called find stream.\n\n260\n00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,750\nIt actually uses select stream.\n\n261\n00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,210\nThe only difference is, when it runs and\nfinds our data, it then\n\n262\n00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,650\nhighlights the words that match, like so I\ncan tell exactly where that word came in.\n\n263\n00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,180\nIt's a neat little module,\nI've used it a number of times.\n\n264\n00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,760\nBut it's not from Microsoft.\n\n265\n00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,550\nIt's just a free one that somebody\nwrote and posted on the Internet, and\n\n266\n00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,820\nit works really well.\n\n267\n00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,670\nWell, for that module,\nI went out and downloaded it and\n\n268\n00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,700\nI wanna add it to my PowerShell.\n\n269\n00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,780\nAnd when you do that, you make a decision.\n\n270\n00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,420\nDo you wanna add it just for you or\ndo you wanna add it for everybody?\n\n271\n00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,970\nAll right.\n\n272\n00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,210\nIf I wanna add it for everybody,\nI need to put it into\n\n273\n00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:26,350\nthe\nC:/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/Ver-\n\n274\n00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,921\nsion1.0/Modules folder.\n\n275\n00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:32,300\nI throw it there and\nit'll be available for everybody.\n\n276\n00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,320\nBut if I want it available for just me,\nthan I need to put it in my own profile.\n\n277\n00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,380\nAnd so if I go into my profile, I actually\ndownloaded this one before the show so\n\n278\n00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,580\nI've got it right here.\n\n279\n00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,760\nI've got it in a folder called\nfind string and inside of there,\n\n280\n00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,630\nthere's the find string commandlet,\nand if we edit that.\n\n281\n00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,039\nOr here I'll just open it in a window pad.\n\n282\n00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,200\nAll right, here it is.\n\n283\n00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,880\nYou'll see that it's not\na terribly complex thing.\n\n284\n00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,588\nIt's really just taking Select-String and\nadding that word matching, right?\n\n285\n00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:03,560\nSo that's really all it does.\n\n286\n00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,150\nBut obviously it's more than I\nwould have written myself, so\n\n287\n00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,490\nit's kind of nice to have it.\n\n288\n00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,400\nBut basically, this is it.\n\n289\n00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,190\nAnd I can take that and\ncopy it into my own folder, and\n\n290\n00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,850\nit'll become available for me.\n\n291\n00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,620\nAll right.\n\n292\n00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,800\nNow i'm gonna do just that,\ni'm gonna copy this find string folder,\n\n293\n00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,830\nand I'm gonna go into my windows\nPowerShell and modules folder.\n\n294\n00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,100\nAnd i'll paste it right here okay.\n\n295\n00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,010\nSo I've now got it pasted into my own\nmodules and now it's pretty much ready.\n\n296\n00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,400\nWell, when you install software, one of\nthe things that it'll do is automatically\n\n297\n00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,950\nimport the module for you and\nget the module loaded and ready to run.\n\n298\n00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,000\nSo, you install the software and\nyou're done.\n\n299\n00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,965\nBut went you copy it over like this,\nsometimes they can automatically load,\n\n300\n00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:49,737\nbut most of the times they don't.\n\n301\n00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:51,837\nSo, while I just added Find-String,\n\n302\n00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:54,776\nI won't be surprised if it's\nnot actually there yet.\n\n303\n00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:55,901\nSo if I run Find-String.\n\n304\n00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:56,478\nOh it did!\n\n305\n00:15:56,478 --> 00:15:59,282\nIt actually went ahead and\nloaded it for me and there it is.\n\n306\n00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:01,070\nSo sometimes it will do that.\n\n307\n00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,450\nSometimes it will go ahead and\nload for you.\n\n308\n00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,140\nIf it doesn't you can\nalways load it yourself\n\n309\n00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,848\nby saying Import-Module and\nspecifying the module that you want to in,\n\n310\n00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:16,430\nokay now Import-Module is\na little bit interesting because\n\n311\n00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,730\nthe way it works is you say Import-Module\nand then just the name of the module.\n\n312\n00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:26,490\nSo I should say Find-Stringand\nit will import it.\n\n313\n00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,020\nNow how does it know where to look for\nthat module?\n\n314\n00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,330\nWell it's going to look\nin those two places.\n\n315\n00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,270\nThe location that's global inside\nof the Windows folder, and\n\n316\n00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,930\nthe location that's local to you,\ninside of your profile.\n\n317\n00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,790\nSo that's where it's gonna look\nby default, and it's looking for\n\n318\n00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,380\na folder called Fing-String.\n\n319\n00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,340\nAnd whatever's in that folder,\nit's gonna load.\n\n320\n00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,570\nBecause that folder, sure it might\nhave one, .psm1 file like I do.\n\n321\n00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,530\nOr it might have 50 of them.\n\n322\n00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,210\nAnd if that's the case\nit will load all 50.\n\n323\n00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,170\nSo what you're really\nproviding is that folder name\n\n324\n00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,950\ninside of the models directory.\n\n325\n00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,470\nAll right, so it's going to look for\nthat and import those.\n\n326\n00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,940\nOnce it's imported, you ready to rock.\n\n327\n00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,540\nNow what if you want\nto import a module and\n\n328\n00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,690\nfor some reason you don't want to put\nit in one of those two directions.\n\n329\n00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,280\nWell first off,\nyou should really reevaluate that, right?\n\n330\n00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,760\nIt's not that big of a deal to copy,\nbut if you have some reason where you\n\n331\n00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,720\nabsolutely just have to put it somewhere\nelse It actually can pull them in from\n\n332\n00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,900\nother places, but\nit's gonna use the Windows $path variable.\n\n333\n00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,995\nInside of Windows we have\nthe $path variable and,\n\n334\n00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:42,146\nIt's not gonna echo that for me, is it.\n\n335\n00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:43,390\nOh shoot.\n\n336\n00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,186\nWell the path variable,\nwhich apparently I can't seem to remember.\n\n337\n00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:56,450\nThere we go.\nLet me bump that size up.\n\n338\n00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:01,050\nThe path variable, it just stores all\nthe directories that Windows will search\n\n339\n00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,220\nwhen it looks for commands.\n\n340\n00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,260\nAnd it's normally used for\nexactly that, command execution.\n\n341\n00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,240\nBut the module import\nprocess can use it too.\n\n342\n00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,620\nIt can use it to scan through\nall of these other directories.\n\n343\n00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,410\nAnd if you look at mine,\nI've got c:/Windows/System32.\n\n344\n00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,035\nI've got c:/Windows,\na couple of other System32 folders.\n\n345\n00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:23,960\nHere's that PowerShell folder.\n\n346\n00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,330\nRight, so\nthere's my PowerShell\\v1.0 folder.\n\n347\n00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,920\nI've got my SQL server client.\n\n348\n00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,930\nAnd all these different directories\nthat are a part of my path.\n\n349\n00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,390\nIf you want to install a module and\nyou can't for\n\n350\n00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,040\nsome reason copy it into one of\nthe two main module folders,\n\n351\n00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,210\nthen instead you could add the folder\nthat it's into your path and\n\n352\n00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,460\nthen you'll be able to import it\nbecause now it's in the search path.\n\n353\n00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,110\nAll right?\n\n354\n00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,580\nI personally don't like to do this.\n\n355\n00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,767\nI don't like to manipulate the path\ninside of Windows if I don't have to but\n\n356\n00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:56,621\nthis is one of those cases where\nsince we're only providing a name and\n\n357\n00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:59,431\nnot a directory,\nwe don't really have a choice.\n\n358\n00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:06,031\nAll right, so we may need to\ndo that otherwise that's that.\n\n359\n00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:10,360\nNow if we have a module and\nwe decide we don't need it anymore,\n\n360\n00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,854\nif we want to get rid of that module,\nwell we use import-module to bring it in,\n\n361\n00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,230\nwe can use remove-module to get rid of it.\n\n362\n00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,960\nThere is one little caveat to that though,\nall right?\n\n363\n00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,640\nRight now I have my\nFind-String module installed.\n\n364\n00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,280\nSo if I say get-command Find-String,\nI can see it right there.\n\n365\n00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,850\nSo I've got it, and\nit came from the Find-String module.\n\n366\n00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,840\nI could say Remove-Module, Find-String.\n\n367\n00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,480\nAnd that's gonna remove it.\n\n368\n00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,820\nAlright, but the command is still there.\n\n369\n00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,810\nWhat the heck is going on there?\n\n370\n00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,270\nI removed it, and now it's right back.\n\n371\n00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,290\nIf you have a module that auto registers,\nremember how it automatically activated.\n\n372\n00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,060\nI didn't have to run\nthe import module command.\n\n373\n00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,470\nWell if you have one that auto registers,\nand you remove it, what's it gonna do?\n\n374\n00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,610\nIt's just gonna turn right around and\nauto register again.\n\n375\n00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,820\nSo if it's a module that you had\nused the import command with,\n\n376\n00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,880\nthen you'll use the remove command and\nthat'll get rid of it.\n\n377\n00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,720\nBut if it's a module that\nautomatically came in.\n\n378\n00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,230\nThe way you get rid of it is\nto just go and delete it.\n\n379\n00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,850\nDelete it or\nmove it out of that directory.\n\n380\n00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,970\nSo if I go back to that folder and\nI just delete it out of there.\n\n381\n00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,490\nSo there goes Find-String, it's gone.\n\n382\n00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,050\nNow I can go back and do my query and\n\n383\n00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,100\nit's still there because\nI haven't removed it yet.\n\n384\n00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,290\nAnd now I can run that Remove,\nwherever it went, there we go.\n\n385\n00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,700\nRemove.\n\n386\n00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,050\nAnd now it's gone.\n\n387\n00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,170\nRight, now when I go and query that,\n\n388\n00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,120\nit's gonna tell me there's no command\ncalled find-string, all right?\n\n389\n00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,325\nSo the problem is that\nautomatic registration, right?\n\n390\n00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:49,815\nThat's just re-registering\nitself after I remove it.\n\n391\n00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,645\nThe Remove-Module command does work but\n\n392\n00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:54,915\nsometimes it's not obvious\nbecause of the auto registration.\n\n393\n00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:59,315\nSo that's how I can get\nthat command back out.\n\n394\n00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:03,615\nBut once the command is there,\nonce the module is in place and\n\n395\n00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,190\nregistered and happy you use\nit just like any other module.\n\n396\n00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,400\nSo for example I've got a CSV file here.\n\n397\n00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,820\nAnd if I take a look at what's in it,\nit's a CSV and\n\n398\n00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,670\nit's listing a bunch of user accounts and\nI can see my user account right here\n\n399\n00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,940\nmaybe I wanna look at that file and I just\nwanna see the line that has my name in it.\n\n400\n00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,370\nWell, here I've got maybe 15 lines,no big\ndeal but what if this was 15,000 lines.\n\n401\n00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,720\nI don't wanna search it to find\njust the line with my name.\n\n402\n00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:43,310\nSo, I could use Select-String,\nwhich is the built-in PowerShell command.\n\n403\n00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,530\nSo, if I do that, if I just use my built\nin Select-String, well it goes like this,\n\n404\n00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,230\nshould we say select dash string path,\nwe tell it the file we're pulling it from\n\n405\n00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,790\nand then we tell it the pattern\nthat we're looking for.\n\n406\n00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:02,150\nSo I'm gonna look for any line that\nincludes the word Pezet, all right.\n\n407\n00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,000\nSo it searches it.\n\n408\n00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,780\nIt finds it.\n\n409\n00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,280\nThere's a line.\n\n410\n00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,210\nThat worked.\n\n411\n00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,540\nOkay.\n\n412\n00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,250\nBut, I now have my new so\na Find-String that I can use.\n\n413\n00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,220\nIt does the same thing but\nwith syntax highlighting.\n\n414\n00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,750\nSo if I do Find-String,\nmy new little add on,\n\n415\n00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,830\nI can punch in the word I'm looking for\nwhich is present.\n\n416\n00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,090\nAnd then I can tell it what to look in and\n\n417\n00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,400\nI can specify that individual file and\nit's going to search it.\n\n418\n00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,210\nAnd there it is, and it's giving me\ntwo things the other one didn't.\n\n419\n00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:37,110\nThe other one gave me the file\nname on the same line as the file,\n\n420\n00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,130\nversus here it's separated them out and\ndone a little highlighting.\n\n421\n00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,675\nAnd then after so that here's\nthe line with Don Pezet on it, and\n\n422\n00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:45,395\nit's highlighting the word that matched.\n\n423\n00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:47,245\nKind of a nice little add-on, right?\n\n424\n00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,715\nNot anything spectacular,\nyou wouldn't pay thousands of dollars for\n\n425\n00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:53,445\nthat functionality, but for\na free module add-on, it's pretty useful,\n\n426\n00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:54,342\nand it's nice to have.\n\n427\n00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:59,192\nRight.\nIf you have a roaming user profile, and\n\n428\n00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:03,502\nyou've stored this commandlet in your\nmodules folder in your documents folder,\n\n429\n00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:05,962\nas you move from machine to machine\nto machine, it will follow you and\n\n430\n00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:07,850\nyou'll always have that\ncommandlet available.\n\n431\n00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,450\nAll right.\n\n432\n00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,290\nBut if you don't have a roaming user\nprofile when you go from machine to\n\n433\n00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,670\nmachine to machine you may or\nmay not have that command available.\n\n434\n00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,010\nSo a lot of people prefer not to use\nadd on modules like these just for\n\n435\n00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,530\nconsistency right.\n\n436\n00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,890\nYou don't want to rely on a module like\nthis and all of a sudden you get a new\n\n437\n00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,110\ncomputer and you've got to figure\nout all the modules that you missed.\n\n438\n00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,580\nAnd and those back in.\n\n439\n00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,620\nThat's why Microsoft puts that\nprofile in your Documents folder,\n\n440\n00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,830\nbecause most people back\nup their Documents folder.\n\n441\n00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,020\nWhen you move to a new computer you\ncopy your Documents folder over, and\n\n442\n00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,290\nnow you've got all your PowerShell stuff,\nthat's why they chose that location.\n\n443\n00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:44,390\nSo these are an example of an add-on\nmodule that adds that functionality.\n\n444\n00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,438\nIf you go and do a Google search on the\nInternet you will find thousands of add-on\n\n445\n00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:48,543\nmodules that are out there.\n\n446\n00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:51,692\nSome from very big companies like Dell and\nQuest.\n\n447\n00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:53,480\nThey have a bunch of\nthem that are out there.\n\n448\n00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,796\nThere's also ones that are just\nfrom individual people.\n\n449\n00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:56,860\nPeople like you and me.\n\n450\n00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,651\nThat had a need, and\nwent ahead and made it, right?\n\n451\n00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:03,050\nMade the command that met their needs,\nand maybe you have that same need, right?\n\n452\n00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,800\nMaybe it was something\nthat you were looking for.\n\n453\n00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,190\nThat's how I came across this one.\n\n454\n00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,500\nI was looking for a command that better\nrecreated what I had with grep but\n\n455\n00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,360\ninside of PowerShell, and\nselect-string wasn't cutting it for me.\n\n456\n00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,700\nAnd so I came across this one and\nit works well.\n\n457\n00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,270\nSo those are some examples there of adding\non that functionality into PowerShell.\n\n458\n00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,310\nLet me see if I'm missing anything.\n\n459\n00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,710\nOh, there is one other thing.\n\n460\n00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,370\nWhen we add on modules like these,\nIf I'm adding SQL and\n\n461\n00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,012\nExchange, whatever all these\nthird party software modules.\n\n462\n00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:41,200\nI may have to install a bunch of stuff\nto my machine to get those modules.\n\n463\n00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,440\nAnd if I'm just gonna need it one time,\n\n464\n00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,120\nit's kind of a waste to add\nmodules that I'm not gonna need.\n\n465\n00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,770\nThe more modules that you have,\nthe slower PowerShell gets at launch time.\n\n466\n00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,370\nNot when it's running, so\nlike once you're in and running,\n\n467\n00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,620\nit runs the same regardless\nof how many modules you have.\n\n468\n00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,580\nBut when you first launch PowerShell,\nit has to index your modules and\n\n469\n00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,390\nget those commands ready.\n\n470\n00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,660\nAnd it will slow that time down.\n\n471\n00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,550\nSo for example if you launch your\nPowerShell on a Microsoft Exchange server,\n\n472\n00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,610\nit's not uncommon for it to sit and pause\nfor upwards of to a minute in some cases.\n\n473\n00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,360\nAnd that is a long time in computers.\n\n474\n00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,970\nSo we try to minimize the amount of\nPowerShell modules that we add on.\n\n475\n00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,610\nBut if you just need one right now, and\n\n476\n00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,660\nthere's another computer that already has\nit, or maybe the server already has it,\n\n477\n00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,900\nyou can actually tell it to load\nthe modules from that other server.\n\n478\n00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,110\nAll right, there's a function inside\nof PowerShell called remoting.\n\n479\n00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:43,180\nRemoting is where you connect your\nPowerShell to another system.\n\n480\n00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,180\nAnd I'm gonna show that in another segment\nwhere we talk about remote management.\n\n481\n00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,280\nBut one of neat aspects of\nremoting is you can say,\n\n482\n00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,230\ndon't fully connect me to the other side.\n\n483\n00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,900\nJust grab their modules.\n\n484\n00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,660\nGive me the same modules that they already\nhave, just for this session, all right.\n\n485\n00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,560\nI don't recommend it because it's not\nthe greatest thing cuz you can bump into\n\n486\n00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,690\nconflicts where they might have a module\nthat's newer than the one you've already\n\n487\n00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,070\ngot or vice versa and so\n\n488\n00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,570\nnow they bump into each other\nbecause they have the same module.\n\n489\n00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,340\nYou'll get a lot of errors when you\nturn it on as it hits those duplicates.\n\n490\n00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,340\nAnd then the ones that aren't\nthe same like the new ones,\n\n491\n00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,440\nthe additional ones, those that get\nadded in and then it will work great.\n\n492\n00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,470\nThis is something I really don't use very\noften just because it's kind of a mess and\n\n493\n00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,120\nthere is a better option.\n\n494\n00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,100\nSo if you're looking to do this,\nto load Powershell modules temporarily.\n\n495\n00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,220\nBe sure to check out our\nremote management episode.\n\n496\n00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,870\nI'll show you guys a better way to do it.\n\n497\n00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,730\nFor completeness, let me show you right\nhere how to load modules from another\n\n498\n00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,160\nserver for temporary use.\n\n499\n00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,570\nThe way we do it is from inside of\nour PowerShell, we just need to give\n\n500\n00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,060\nit a heads up that we're gonna be loading\nthese commands from somewhere else.\n\n501\n00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,380\nAnd it does take two lines to do this one.\n\n502\n00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,580\nI'm going to create a variable called s.\n\n503\n00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,212\nAnd I'm going to store the output of\na command which is going to be the New\n\n504\n00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:06,540\n-PSSession command.\n\n505\n00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,080\nAnd, I'm going to specify a computer.\n\n506\n00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,900\nAnd this will be the remote computer.\n\n507\n00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,090\nWho it is,\nthat has the module that you want.\n\n508\n00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,730\nAll right.\n\n509\n00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,160\nSo, my server is called Server01.\n\n510\n00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,800\nI'm actually going to connect to myself.\n\n511\n00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,190\nJust to show it.\n\n512\n00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,250\nBut you'd specify some other server or\nworkstation,\n\n513\n00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,458\nthat had the modules you needed.\n\n514\n00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:28,734\nSo, I'm saying,\nset this session as a variable called $S.\n\n515\n00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,793\nSo, that's gonna store it and it's gonna\nget angry at me what's its problem,\n\n516\n00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:34,290\naccess denied, oh, shoot!\n\n517\n00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,850\nI need to be an administrator\nto do this and\n\n518\n00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,960\nI did not run my PowerShell\nwith administrative privileges.\n\n519\n00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,830\nSo, let me switch that around.\n\n520\n00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,040\nThere we go and we'll try this again.\n\n521\n00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,780\nAll right, there.\n\n522\n00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,150\nSo now I'm giving this variable\nthat allows me to call that session\n\n523\n00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,930\nwhenever I want.\n\n524\n00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,460\nSo now I can call a PowerShell connection\nover to Server01 whenever I want.\n\n525\n00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,155\nAnd from here, I just say,\n\n526\n00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:08,550\nImport-PSSession-Session $S, right.\n\n527\n00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,800\nReferencing the one I stored up here.\n\n528\n00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,930\nSo, I'm going to import\nthe PowerShell Session from that server.\n\n529\n00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,680\nImport, just like when I imported modules,\nthat's what it's going to do here,\n\n530\n00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,100\nit's going to take whatever modules are\navailable to a session on that server and\n\n531\n00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,990\nconnect them into this\nsession temporarily.\n\n532\n00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,630\nRight?\n\n533\n00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,260\nAnd when I run that it's\ngonna reach out and\n\n534\n00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,790\nit's gonna pull\nthe information from there.\n\n535\n00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,270\nNow, expect to see some errors.\n\n536\n00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,550\nRight?\nYou're gonna get errors anytime there's\n\n537\n00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,280\nduplicates.\n\n538\n00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,690\nRight?\nHere I've got some unsafe command names.\n\n539\n00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,580\nWhich is usually just telling me that\nthere's a duplicate that's in there.\n\n540\n00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,050\nAnd if I scroll back up,\nlooks like I didn't get all that many.\n\n541\n00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,930\nHere I'm seeing, let's see.\n\n542\n00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,380\nWhich one did it die out on?\n\n543\n00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,500\nHere it says, proxy creation has been\nskipped for the question mark command\n\n544\n00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,490\nbecause the Windows PowerShell cannot\nverify the safety of the command name.\n\n545\n00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,310\nSo it's got some kind of grievance\nthere with that particular command.\n\n546\n00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,800\nBut I'm not too worried about that.\n\n547\n00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,140\nBecause right after it, I see all the\nother commands that it tried to import.\n\n548\n00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,280\nAnd notice how all these are warnings,\nright.\n\n549\n00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,670\nIt says warning, and if I go all the way\nto the bottom, it'll tell me here.\n\n550\n00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,510\nIt's giving us a warning, because it\nwould shadow an existing local command.\n\n551\n00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,440\nSo in this case,\n\n552\n00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,220\nit's saying you've already got\nthe command locally, you don't need it.\n\n553\n00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,150\nBut anything that was different that\ndidn't throw an error, it would bring in,\n\n554\n00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,390\nand we now have.\n\n555\n00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,940\nAnd it's creating a temporary module.\n\n556\n00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,440\nSee this ModuleType script?\n\n557\n00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,160\nIt's creating a temporary module that\ngives me all the various commands\n\n558\n00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,020\nthat are present on that other server.\n\n559\n00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:45,000\nAnd now I can work as if those modules\nwere local, even though they're not.\n\n560\n00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,620\nAnd when I close this\nPowerShell window and\n\n561\n00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,780\nopen a new one, all those\ncommands are now gone, all right.\n\n562\n00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,305\nSo this is a good way to do\nthat temporarily, but for\n\n563\n00:29:54,305 --> 00:29:57,135\nme, from my own personal experience,\nyou get so\n\n564\n00:29:57,135 --> 00:30:00,455\nmany conflicts with it that you can\nget some really erratic behavior.\n\n565\n00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:02,685\nAnd so I recommend you don't use it.\n\n566\n00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:05,685\nWhile the functionality is there,\nI typically don't.\n\n567\n00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:10,345\nI use PSSession, but\nI use it to create a full connection,\n\n568\n00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:12,745\nwhere sure, I'm running\nPowerShell on my own machine, but\n\n569\n00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:15,920\nI'm actually seeing the PowerShell\non the remote machine.\n\n570\n00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,320\nThat means you're using all the commands\nfrom the remote machine and\n\n571\n00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,770\nthat eliminates the conflicts.\n\n572\n00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,270\nThat ensures that you're running\na consistent environment.\n\n573\n00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,460\nI prefer that much more than this method.\n\n574\n00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,010\nAll right?\n\n575\n00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,200\nBut, for completeness,\nI did want to show that just so\n\n576\n00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,520\nyou're aware that you can do it.\n\n577\n00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,670\nWhat is it that they say?\n\n578\n00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,940\nJust because you can do something\ndoesn't mean you should.\n\n579\n00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,120\nThis is one of those cases.\n\n580\n00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,530\nAll right.\nSo that's about it for\n\n581\n00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,500\nadding on functionality.\n\n582\n00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,490\nDo be careful if you're going out there\nand downloading third party modules.\n\n583\n00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,410\nYou need to download them from\npeople you trust because,\n\n584\n00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,540\nif you go to run a module and it says oh,\nyou need to be an administrator and\n\n585\n00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,440\nyou've run the modules in administrator,\ndo you know what it's doing?\n\n586\n00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,630\nThere could be all sorts of\ncraziness written in the code for\n\n587\n00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,510\nthat module that you don't know,\nso do a code review.\n\n588\n00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,280\nSkim over it.\n\n589\n00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,260\nLook at it.\nSee what it's doing.\n\n590\n00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,040\nIt might be phoning home.\n\n591\n00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,310\nIt might be sending emails or\n\n592\n00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:09,090\ndata back to an external server,\nyou won't know unless you look, all right?\n\n593\n00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,180\nOr just use modules that\ncome from trusted providers.\n\n594\n00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,120\nSo if you're getting\nsoftware from Microsoft and\n\n595\n00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,295\nit's got PowerShell modules,\nyou can trust that.\n\n596\n00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:19,470\nAll right,\nthen Microsoft made all this stuff.\n\n597\n00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,830\nOr if you go into Oracle or\nDell or somewhere like that and\n\n598\n00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,310\nthey have PowerShell modules for\nyou, that's great.\n\n599\n00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,260\nAll right,\nthose are companies that you can trust.\n\n600\n00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,020\nWell, I shouldn't have said Oracle.\n\n601\n00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,120\nBut companies that you\nshould be able to trust.\n\n602\n00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,950\nBut if you're downloading a module\nthat was written by John Doe and\n\n603\n00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,310\nwas posted to GitHub and\nyou're pulling it from there.\n\n604\n00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,300\nYou just don't know.\n\n605\n00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,170\nSo, you've got to skim over that and\nmake sure it's something you can trust.\n\n606\n00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:49,790\nIn this segment we got a chance to see how\nto bring in modules into PowerShell to\n\n607\n00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,860\nadd additional commands and\nfunctionality, and it's the sky's limit.\n\n608\n00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,250\nThere's a lot of stuff\nyou can do there and\n\n609\n00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,120\nwe wrapped up the segment taking a look\nat importing a PowerShell session.\n\n610\n00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,350\nAll the commands from another\nsession on a remote system.\n\n611\n00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,570\nAnd while it's not a great idea,\n\n612\n00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,120\nit certainly is possible so\nwe got a chance to see that.\n\n613\n00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,060\nAll right, well if you're interesting\nin seeing how to do it the right way\n\n614\n00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,750\nbe sure to check out our remote\nmanagement section, or that segment.\n\n615\n00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,350\nWe've got a section on there where we\nshow the other method that I mention.\n\n616\n00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,290\nYou'll definitely wanna check that out.\n\n617\n00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,380\nOtherwise, that's about it for\nthis segment.\n\n618\n00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,452\nSo stay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n619\n00:32:27,452 --> 00:32:30,812\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

remote\n\n3\n00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:14,270\nmanagement inside a PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,990\nThe majority of the time we're working\nin PowerShell we're doing what's called\n\n5\n00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,200\nlocal management.\n\n6\n00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,140\nIn other words, all the commandlets\nthat we run they're running against\n\n7\n00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,760\nthe server that we're sitting on or\nthe workstation or whatever.\n\n8\n00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,060\nSo I'm on a Windows 7 machine and\nI fire up the PowerShell,\n\n9\n00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,310\nany commands I type, are running\nagainst my Windows 7 machine, and\n\n10\n00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,685\nif I wanna run against some other machine,\nwell that's just not the default.\n\n11\n00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:39,905\nSo, there's not really all that\nmuch to say about local management.\n\n12\n00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,235\nYou launch the PowerShell and\nyou type stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:43,705\nRight?\nIt's what we've done in all of\n\n14\n00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:47,695\nthe various segments for this series so\nfar is just straight up local management.\n\n15\n00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,305\nNothing special there.\n\n16\n00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:51,675\nBut remote management,\nthere's something special.\n\n17\n00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:52,345\nRight?\n\n18\n00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:56,260\nRemote management is where I want to\nrun a PowerShell on my own machine but\n\n19\n00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,100\nI wanted to actually perform\nactions on other machines.\n\n20\n00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,410\nSometimes that can be easy,\nsometimes it's not, all right?\n\n21\n00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,330\nThe best case scenario is that\nthe command you're running\n\n22\n00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,630\nsupports providing a target.\n\n23\n00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,000\nSome of the command links you run\nwill actually have a target value.\n\n24\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,140\nAnd if you leave the target off it just\ndefaults to your local machine, so\n\n25\n00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,395\nit's defaulting to local management.\n\n26\n00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:22,600\nBut you might to run it\nagainst a different machine,\n\n27\n00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,020\nyou'll be able to do that.\n\n28\n00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,214\nLet me show you an example,\nI'm gonna fire up my PowerShell.\n\n29\n00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,970\nAnd let's take a look at get-aduser.\n\n30\n00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,620\nGet-aduser is a command that will\nquery the active directory and\n\n31\n00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,910\nreturn back information about\na user account, all right?\n\n32\n00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,470\nThe default for it is to run against,\nwell, the machine you're on if you're\n\n33\n00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,840\na domain controller or whatever domain\ncontroller you've authenticated again.\n\n34\n00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,780\nBut if you want to run it against\na particular domain controller\n\n35\n00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,340\nit supports a target.\n\n36\n00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,140\nNow how,\nhow do we know if it's worked a target?\n\n37\n00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,310\nWell it was that shell and\nwe'll find out in the syntax.\n\n38\n00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,400\nSo in the syntax with a command\nwhat you're looking for\n\n39\n00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,700\nis somewhere where it asks for\na computer name or server name.\n\n40\n00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,650\nAnd here it will actually\nshow up as server.\n\n41\n00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,640\nLet's see if we can find that.\n\n42\n00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,670\nThere we go.\n\n43\n00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,150\nDash server and a stream.\n\n44\n00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,730\nAnd notice how they're surrounded by the\nsquare brackets which means it's optional.\n\n45\n00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,580\nIf I leave that off, it's gonna try and\nquery against myself.\n\n46\n00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,760\nIf I'm a domain controller, or\n\n47\n00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,030\nwhatever domain controller\nI authenticate it against.\n\n48\n00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,860\nBut if I specify this\ndash server in a string,\n\n49\n00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,640\nI'm telling it what remote\nserver I want it to connect to.\n\n50\n00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,780\nAnd instead of running\nthe command on my computer,\n\n51\n00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,790\nit's going to run the command\non that computer.\n\n52\n00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,280\nThat's remote management, and\n\n53\n00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,940\nit's as easy as that if\nthe command you have supports it.\n\n54\n00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,560\nNot every command does.\n\n55\n00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,460\nYes, all right this one does.\n\n56\n00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,720\nSo if I were to run that right?\n\n57\n00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,440\nIf I were to run get dash AD User,\nwhoops, that was not what I wanted.\n\n58\n00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,488\nGet dash AD User dash identity Don Pezet.\n\n59\n00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:02,615\nI am not giving it a server to connect to.\n\n60\n00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,305\nWell, I am a domain controller so\n\n61\n00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:07,385\nit's going to run against my machine and\nit's going to query it, and there we go.\n\n62\n00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:11,095\nI get the answer back,\nit ran right here on this machine.\n\n63\n00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:14,435\nBut if I add to the end\nof that dash server, and\n\n64\n00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:17,990\nI specify a server name,\nmine's called Server01,\n\n65\n00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,060\nIf I do that, now it's going to run it,\nsee how it's pausing?\n\n66\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,110\nThat pause is it establishing a WinRM\nconnection to the other server.\n\n67\n00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,880\nIn this case it's myself but\nit still does the same process.\n\n68\n00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,360\nIt uses Windows remote management, WinRM.\n\n69\n00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,350\nTo connect to the other server and execute\nthe power shell command on that other\n\n70\n00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,810\nserver to then return back and\ngive me the data.\n\n71\n00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,880\nNow I get the exact same data because\nit came from me in the first place.\n\n72\n00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,250\nBut it did execute it on the other server.\n\n73\n00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,520\nSo, super easy there assuming that\nwe've got WinRM enabled, right?\n\n74\n00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,220\nWinRM, Windows Remote Management, that's\na part of the Windows operating system,\n\n75\n00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,490\nin Windows 7, Windows 8,\nWindows Server 2008, Server 2012.\n\n76\n00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:05,980\nBut even though it's enabled by default,\nit's usually blocked on our firewalls.\n\n77\n00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,610\nSo a lot of times, if you're gonna be\nusing this, if you're gonna use WinRM\n\n78\n00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,150\nyou'll need to go and adjust\nthe firewall rules on your servers or\n\n79\n00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,180\non your workstations to\nallow WinRM connections.\n\n80\n00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,520\nNow you might ask yourself why wouldn't\nMicrosoft turn that on by default?\n\n81\n00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,200\nWell Microsoft doesn't want you\nto turn it on for everybody.\n\n82\n00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,680\nYou don't want everybody to be able to\nconnect to your system using WinRM.\n\n83\n00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,390\nSo the idea is you use something like an\nactive directory group policy object and\n\n84\n00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,800\nyou say create a firewall rule that\nallows winrm traffic from this IP and\n\n85\n00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,500\nyou specify the IP address of your\nwork station as an IT support person.\n\n86\n00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,810\nOr you say this server.\n\n87\n00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,960\nYou specify particular hosts that\nare allowed to connect using WinRL.\n\n88\n00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,430\nThat way it's not increasing you attack\nsurface any greater than it needs to be.\n\n89\n00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,720\nBut that's a really simple way\nto remotely manage the system,\n\n90\n00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,840\nif your command supports it.\n\n91\n00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,080\nWhat if your command doesn't support it?\n\n92\n00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,850\nIf I wanna execute a command on a remote\nsever and it doesn't have a dash server,\n\n93\n00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,150\nor dash computer name, or whatever flag or\nparameter that I can specify.\n\n94\n00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,420\nWell in that case,\nI need to do command proxying somehow.\n\n95\n00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,370\nAnd I've kind of already showed one\nway to do it in another episode.\n\n96\n00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,620\nIf you watched the episode where\nwe talked about importing modules\n\n97\n00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,217\nI talked about proxying through\na PS session or PowerShell session.\n\n98\n00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,880\nWhen you run aPowerShell,\n\n99\n00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,140\nwhat you're actually doing is\ncreating a PowerShell session.\n\n100\n00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,440\nPretty hard to say, I'm gonna sell\nPowerShell sessions by the sea shore.\n\n101\n00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,390\nBut if we create a PowerShell session,\n\n102\n00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,930\nwe're actually doing that\nagainst our own machine.\n\n103\n00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,590\nWe're connecting to our own machine and\nthat's fast enough and easy.\n\n104\n00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,050\nBut when we do a proxy,\nwhat we're doing is we're establishing\n\n105\n00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,690\na PowerShell session against\na remote host, somebody else.\n\n106\n00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,670\nAnd now the commands we type look\nlike we're running them here locally,\n\n107\n00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,690\nbut their actually being sent to\nthe other side and running from there.\n\n108\n00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,290\nAll right.\n\n109\n00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,240\nAnd in that modules episode,\nI showed how we could\n\n110\n00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,290\nimport modules that were installed on\na remote machine into our local machine so\n\n111\n00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,190\nwe could use them temporarily\nwithout having to install them.\n\n112\n00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,960\nAnd, I think I've said it\nprobably three or four times now,\n\n113\n00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,330\nI absolutely hate doing that.\n\n114\n00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,730\nIt's not the greatest solution.\n\n115\n00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,700\nAnd at the time I said if you wanna\nlearn the right way to do it,\n\n116\n00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,270\njump over to the remote management\nepisode and we'll show it there.\n\n117\n00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,360\nWell that's where we're at now.\n\n118\n00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,630\nSo when it comes to remotely\nexecuting these commands\n\n119\n00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,940\nthat option of proxying your\ncommands that's an option for us.\n\n120\n00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,310\nIt's not a very good one but\nit is an option.\n\n121\n00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:36,890\nSo it's out there.\n\n122\n00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,860\nOption number two is I could remote\ndesktop into that other server.\n\n123\n00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,830\nIf I wanna run that\ncommand from server 05,\n\n124\n00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,010\nI could remote desktop into server 05 and\nI could run it from there.\n\n125\n00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,710\nThat's another option.\n\n126\n00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:57,040\nBut if that server is in an area where\nI can't establish remote desktop to it,\n\n127\n00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,500\nmaybe it's in a DMZ or\nwe don't have an interactive shell to it.\n\n128\n00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,630\nMaybe it's a Windows server 2008 machine\nrunning Windows server core mode,\n\n129\n00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,210\nwhich doesn't give us PowerShell.\n\n130\n00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,460\nIf that's the case,\n\n131\n00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,420\nthen remote desktopping into it is\nnot really gonna help me much at all.\n\n132\n00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,850\nSituations like those\nmay prevent that option.\n\n133\n00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,250\nAnd so with that,\nwe're left with option number three.\n\n134\n00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,320\nAnd option number three is where,\nwe use Windows remote management\n\n135\n00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:30,270\nto establish a shell session that's\nactually executing on the remote server.\n\n136\n00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,110\nThink of it as like remote desktop for\nPowerShell.\n\n137\n00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,630\nRight?\nBut\n\n138\n00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,770\ninstead of seeing a graphical\nuser interface desktop,\n\n139\n00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,790\nwe're just seeing our\nPowerShell interface.\n\n140\n00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,690\nBut everything we run,\nis actually running on that other server.\n\n141\n00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,490\nAnd to do that we use\nthe Powershell session or\n\n142\n00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,990\nPS session command and\nthat will let us get that prompt so\n\n143\n00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,210\nthat we're able to start entering\ncommands into that remote system.\n\n144\n00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,590\nIf we want to see that in action,\nit's actually really easy.\n\n145\n00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,820\nAll we do is we use the enter\nPS session command.\n\n146\n00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,700\nSo I could come in here and\n\n147\n00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,450\nsay enter-PSsession followed by the name\nof the server that I want to connect to.\n\n148\n00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,750\nSo I want to connect to Server01.\n\n149\n00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,800\nWhen I run that oh, am I an administrator?\n\n150\n00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,140\nI am not an administrator.\n\n151\n00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,260\nYou do need to run your PowerShell\nas an administrator to do this.\n\n152\n00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,390\nSo let me just relaunch that.\n\n153\n00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,890\nThere we go.\nSo Enter PSsession Server01.\n\n154\n00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,007\nThere we go.\n\n155\n00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:37,240\nAll right, now I'm in a remove PowerShell.\n\n156\n00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,070\nAll right, and\nsee what happened to my prompt?\n\n157\n00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,840\nI still have my PS prompt but\non the left side I now see Server01.\n\n158\n00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,110\nAnd what that's letting me know\nis while I am in PowerShell and\n\n159\n00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,540\nwhile it does look like\nit's running right here,\n\n160\n00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,360\nin reality the shell I'm seeing\nis on that remote server.\n\n161\n00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,440\nOkay, now\n\n162\n00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,450\nI'm able to connect to that remote\nserver cuz it's not actually remote.\n\n163\n00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,110\nIt's just myself.\n\n164\n00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,880\nI'm just connecting right back to myself.\n\n165\n00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,740\nIf this were a remote server i would just\nneed to make sure that my user account\n\n166\n00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,670\nhad administrative access\nto the other system right?\n\n167\n00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,008\nI got to have permissions to access it.\n\n168\n00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:12,930\nAnd the WinRM settings have to be open\non the firewall to allow me to connect.\n\n169\n00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,080\nAll right?\nNow Microsoft's all ready made the WinRM\n\n170\n00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,470\nsettings inside of firewall, so\nit's not like we have to go and\n\n171\n00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,330\nlook up anything too crazy.\n\n172\n00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,730\nIf we go into the Windows firewall and\nadvanced security panel, we can go in\n\n173\n00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,920\nthere to the inbound rules and you'll see\njust a bunch of rules that are in there.\n\n174\n00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,760\nBut if you scroll through, eventually\nyou will find the Remote Management.\n\n175\n00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,520\nAnd it's buried down in here somewhere.\n\n176\n00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,020\nAnd let's see.\nHere we go.\n\n177\n00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,470\nWindows Remote Management.\n\n178\n00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,660\nAnd you can see I've turned it on on mine,\nso I've got my little green check mark.\n\n179\n00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,600\nIt's enabled.\n\n180\n00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,700\nSo it's right there.\n\n181\n00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,920\nAnd what you can do is\nyou can take these and\n\n182\n00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,410\nyou can run with them like they are,\nright?\n\n183\n00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,220\nYou just turn them on and there they go.\n\n184\n00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,680\nBut the problem is if you just turn\nthem on, it's really open for anybody.\n\n185\n00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,380\nSo now, anybody can try to connect, they\nstill have to provide credentials, right?\n\n186\n00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,990\nThey have to have a valid\nactive directory account.\n\n187\n00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,110\nThey've got to be\nan administrator to do it.\n\n188\n00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,460\nBut anybody could attempt it, so\nthey could attempt to brute force.\n\n189\n00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,540\nSo what I always recommend is take\nthe rule one step further, right?\n\n190\n00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,318\nIf we take one of these rules, notice the,\nlet me move my screen around a little bit\n\n191\n00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:24,565\nhere all right,\nnotice the profile for each of these.\n\n192\n00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:27,385\nThis one is for domain and\nprivate networks.\n\n193\n00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,315\nThis one is for public.\n\n194\n00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:31,525\nSee how I've got it turned on for public.\n\n195\n00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:33,730\nThat's not really the greatest idea is it?\n\n196\n00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,720\nSo we might choose to disable that if\nI'm on a public network I don't want it.\n\n197\n00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,150\nWell, if I'm on a server, it's not likely\nsomething I'm moving around very often.\n\n198\n00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,910\nSo it's usually going to be on that domain\nor private, so it probably doesn't matter.\n\n199\n00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,910\nBut I'm gonna turn it off anyway\njust to be on the safe side.\n\n200\n00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,010\nBut the other rule, this one that\nsays windows remote management and\n\n201\n00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,460\nit's domain and private.\n\n202\n00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,690\nI'm gonna modify that one too.\n\n203\n00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,230\nWhen you go into the settings for\nthat firewall rule.\n\n204\n00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,200\nYou'll have in here where you can\nspecify the remote computers.\n\n205\n00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,810\nWho's allowed to connect.\n\n206\n00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,800\nAnd what I can do is I can say\nonly allow authorized computers.\n\n207\n00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,590\nOnly allow connections\nfrom these computers.\n\n208\n00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,550\nAnd then I can start to specify\nwho is allowed to connect.\n\n209\n00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,880\nDetailing right in there particular IP's\nor ranges, I might have an old subnet and\n\n210\n00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,710\nI could approve those to limit it.\n\n211\n00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,450\nNow, for me giving it an error, let's see.\n\n212\n00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,090\nOnly when the action is set\nto allow only secure, oh,\n\n213\n00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,450\nI don't have my secure\nconnection turned on, but\n\n214\n00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,420\nbasically that is where I can just punch\nthat data in and set that restriction, and\n\n215\n00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,950\nin most IT environments you'll just have\na handful of people who are actually using\n\n216\n00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,420\nWindows Remote PowerShell so\nyou'll approve their workstations.\n\n217\n00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,010\nNow, if they're using DHCP,\nif their IP address has changed,\n\n218\n00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,530\nthat can be a bit problematic.\n\n219\n00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,350\nSo, you'll see there's other settings in\nhere that you kind of tweak to achieve\n\n220\n00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,520\nthat same goal but for the most part these\nare some of the ones that we can use.\n\n221\n00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,550\nActually, I was doing that\nin the wrong spot wasn't I?\n\n222\n00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,200\nI was under remote computers If I'd\ngone under scope, there we go.\n\n223\n00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,620\nThere's where I could have\nspecified the remote IP addresses.\n\n224\n00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,640\nThat's why it was giving me an error,\nI was in the wrong spot.\n\n225\n00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,020\nSo, we look here, I can specify it as IPs.\n\n226\n00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,560\nSo, I might specify it as the IP\naddress as my own workstation, which,\n\n227\n00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,520\nI don't know, so let's go find that out.\n\n228\n00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,220\nSo I am 192.168.29.3.\n\n229\n00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,062\nSo I'll go and punch that in.\n\n230\n00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:25,670\nAll right so now it's added and\nthen I could add in any other\n\n231\n00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,540\nIP addresses that I wanted to make sure\nthat they'd be able to connect, all right.\n\n232\n00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,250\nSo you punch them in, and now Windows\nremote management is a lot more secure.\n\n233\n00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,300\nSo that's why Microsoft has\nthis turned off by default.\n\n234\n00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,660\nThey want to give you the chance to go\nin and secure that a little bit more.\n\n235\n00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,500\nAll right.\n\n236\n00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,310\nSo, once that's done, you'll be able to\nfire up that Windows PowerShell, and it's\n\n237\n00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,640\ngonna run under your user credentials, so\nit's gonna reach out to that server and if\n\n238\n00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,020\nyou have administrative privileges on that\nserver, you'll get this shell right here.\n\n239\n00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,940\nNow, every command I run, even ones\nthat don't specify a server target,\n\n240\n00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,240\nwill be able to execute and execute as if\nthey were running on that other server,\n\n241\n00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,780\nbecause they actually are running\non that other server.\n\n242\n00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,720\nI'm not looking at my machine anymore.\n\n243\n00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,130\nI'm looking at the remote.\n\n244\n00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,840\nSo, when I want to use a module that I\ndon't have installed, this is what I use.\n\n245\n00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,620\nI just do a remote shell.\n\n246\n00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,850\nI do a PS session to that remote system\nand now I don't have to worry about\n\n247\n00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,690\nconflicting commands and duplicate\nentries and differing versions and\n\n248\n00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,670\nall the other problems we have\nwhen we do the command proxies.\n\n249\n00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,040\nHere, everything is running on the remote\nserver, so everything works out great, and\n\n250\n00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,680\nthat's really what we want to\nachieve when we use PowerShell.\n\n251\n00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:42,120\nAll right, so pretty easy to do,\nnothing too terribly spectacular there.\n\n252\n00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:50,020\nThere is another option that I want to\nmention, and that's invoke command option.\n\n253\n00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,290\nWhen I run a Shell like this with\nPSssesion, I'm now in a Shell.\n\n254\n00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,160\nI can run a whole series of commands and\nthey're all going to run to\n\n255\n00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,340\nthat remote system because\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n\n256\n00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,250\nBut if I just want to run one command,\n\n257\n00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,850\nI want to run one command\nto that remote system.\n\n258\n00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,150\nWell if I go into a shell I\nmight forget that I did that.\n\n259\n00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,810\nIt's right here in the prompt.\n\n260\n00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,600\nBut you know how we get\nwhen we're in a hurry.\n\n261\n00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,620\nSo I might forget, and\n\n262\n00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,600\nnow I'm running things on\na different system than I thought.\n\n263\n00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,180\nAnd I start to cause some problems.\n\n264\n00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,190\nSo if it's just gonna be one command\nthat I'm gonna run remotely.\n\n265\n00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,970\nInstead of doing a full shell like this\n\n266\n00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,340\nI can use a different commandlet to be\nable to push that along, all right?\n\n267\n00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,670\nI need to get out of this session so\nI'm going to type Exit PSsession and\n\n268\n00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,050\nthat'll put me back and now see how my\nprompt, it dropped that server one.\n\n269\n00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,290\nNow I'm right back to my own session.\n\n270\n00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,540\nAll right, now if I just wanted to\nrun one command on that remote side,\n\n271\n00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,150\nthe commandlet for\nthat is invoke dash command, right?\n\n272\n00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,270\nWe're gonna run a command but not on us,\n\n273\n00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,250\nwe're gonna invoke it\non some other system.\n\n274\n00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,070\nAnd what this does is it lets\nus take really any command, and\n\n275\n00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,860\nwe just copy the command, throw it to the\nother system, let the other system run it,\n\n276\n00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,080\nand then bring the output back and\nshow us the output, all right?\n\n277\n00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,010\nSo it's a temporary session.\n\n278\n00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,059\nJust a temporary one used\nto run this one command.\n\n279\n00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,210\nAnd with it you basically\nspecify a computer name.\n\n280\n00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,940\nAnd here's the really\ncool part about this one.\n\n281\n00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,420\nThis one is actually a little\nbit better than the shell.\n\n282\n00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,460\nBecause I can specify more\nthan one computer name.\n\n283\n00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,930\nI could say server01, server02, server03.\n\n284\n00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,910\nAnd i'm just separating them with commas.\n\n285\n00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,520\nRight?\n\n286\n00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,300\nSo by doing this it's gonna reach out and\n\n287\n00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,280\nrun whatever I'm about to type\non all three of those servers.\n\n288\n00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,460\nWhen I did the PS session, that shell,\nthat's just one server but\n\n289\n00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,130\nhere I can do multiple.\n\n290\n00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,130\nSo now I'm gonna invoke\na command on those servers.\n\n291\n00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,920\nI'm gonna reach out to them and\ntell them to do something and\n\n292\n00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920\nnow I can tell them what I want.\n\n293\n00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,490\nOne of the problems I might bump into with\nthis, though, is the authentication piece.\n\n294\n00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,240\nWell, it's gonna run under my credentials,\nso I probably don't have to specify any.\n\n295\n00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,590\nBut I can specify the credentials here in\nline if I need to, just to let it know.\n\n296\n00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,670\nI could come in and say, -Credential, and\n\n297\n00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:20,040\nspecify my domain and whatever\n\n298\n00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,170\naccount it is that I'm using so that it\nknows what credential I want to run as.\n\n299\n00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,250\nIf I don't have that password\nit's going to prompt me for it so\n\n300\n00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,670\nI'll have to provide the password, but I\ndon't have to put it here in the command.\n\n301\n00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,300\nIn my case though, I just need to\nrun it as me and that will be fine.\n\n302\n00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,590\nAnd I'll go ahead and get rid of these\nother servers because they don't exist.\n\n303\n00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,560\nI'll just run this against server01.\n\n304\n00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,750\nNow, after that I can\nspecify what I want to run.\n\n305\n00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,900\nNow, if it's a single command I\ncan just throw it in here but\n\n306\n00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,500\nwhat we normally do is we\nthrow it into a script block.\n\n307\n00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,130\nA script block is like the curly\nbrackets I was talking about earlier.\n\n308\n00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,970\nThe curly brackets are nice cuz you can\nactually put more than one command in\n\n309\n00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,090\nthere and they'll all run as part\nof that instantaneous session.\n\n310\n00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:06,970\nSo, I could do something like {\nget-process } and close that out.\n\n311\n00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,810\nSo now, it's gonna.\n\n312\n00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,642\nCreate a temporary session to server01.\n\n313\n00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:14,790\nOn server01,\nit's going to run get-process and\n\n314\n00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,610\nthen the output will be displayed\nright here on my screen.\n\n315\n00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,540\nAnd if I was to do comma server two,\ncomma server three,\n\n316\n00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,040\nit would reach out to all three of them.\n\n317\n00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,930\nAnd then I would get the output for\neach one on my screen and\n\n318\n00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,710\nI could see those processes.\n\n319\n00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,550\nSo when I run that,\nit's reaching out to it, and\n\n320\n00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,880\nthere's the processes all\ncoming from that system.\n\n321\n00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,980\nAnd notice that it actually has\nthat extra column over here, it's\n\n322\n00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,320\nadding a column called PS computer name,\nso that I remember where that came from.\n\n323\n00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,360\nBecause if I'm running this\non more than one system\n\n324\n00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,820\nI need to be aware of that, right.\n\n325\n00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,220\nI need to know that it's from one host or\nanother.\n\n326\n00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,820\nSo, that's another cool little\nway to go out there and do that.\n\n327\n00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,652\nThese are temporary versus PSSession\nwhere once we go into a PSSession,\n\n328\n00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:05,210\nyou Enter -PSSession, you're now\nin that shell until you exit it.\n\n329\n00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,790\nAnd so you can stay in there for\nhours on end.\n\n330\n00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,910\nInvoke command, runs once, and it's done.\n\n331\n00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,040\nNow I'm out of that system, and\nI'm back to working on my regular machine.\n\n332\n00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,960\nSee my prompt never changed.\n\n333\n00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,270\nI'm still on my own machine.\n\n334\n00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,520\nAll right.\nSo, that's pretty much it for\n\n335\n00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,340\nremote managements.\n\n336\n00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,330\nIt's pretty straight forward.\n\n337\n00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,030\nMicrosoft made it easy.\n\n338\n00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,880\nJust remember that the three or\nfour real options we have.\n\n339\n00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,020\nCheck your command.\n\n340\n00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,350\nYour commandlet may already have\nan option for specifying remote servers,\n\n341\n00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,280\nin which case, that's the easiest,\nstick with that, all right?\n\n342\n00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,810\nOr you can try and proxy your commands\nby using the import session but\n\n343\n00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,810\nthat's my least favorite so that's where\nyou start to get command conflicts.\n\n344\n00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,280\nI don't like that one.\n\n345\n00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,800\nOur third option is to do a PSsession and\ncreate that shell to the other side.\n\n346\n00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,230\nWhen we do that now we're logged into\nthe other system and running our commands.\n\n347\n00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,610\nThat works great.\n\n348\n00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,540\nOur last option was, well,\nif we use invoke command and\n\n349\n00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,020\nwe can run our commands\non that remote system.\n\n350\n00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,630\nGet in and get out.\n\n351\n00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,420\nAnd move on.\n\n352\n00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,440\nSo, all different methods of\nremotely managing systems.\n\n353\n00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,070\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed that segment.\n\n354\n00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,846\nThat's about all I've got on that one,\nso we'll wrap it up here, but\n\n355\n00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:18,930\nstay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up next.\n\n356\n00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:24,089\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:09,197\n[SOUND]\nIn this segment,\n\n2\n00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:11,810\nwe're gonna take a look\nat the PowerShell ISE.\n\n3\n00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,510\nThe PowerShell ISE is a integrated\nscripting environment.\n\n4\n00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,960\nNow what the heck is that?\n\n5\n00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,190\nWell, if you've ever worked with a\ndeveloper or if you've done any developing\n\n6\n00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,890\nyourself you'll know that most\nprogrammers work in what's called an IDE,\n\n7\n00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,840\nan integrated development environment.\n\n8\n00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,170\nAnd what an IDE allows them\nto do is to write their code.\n\n9\n00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,780\nThey can write all their source code and\nimmediately compile and\n\n10\n00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,850\nexecute it right there from\ninside of their development file.\n\n11\n00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,740\nSo they can make a change launch\ntheir program and test it.\n\n12\n00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,620\nMake another change launch\ntheir program and test it.\n\n13\n00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,000\nDoing it all right from one location.\n\n14\n00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,090\nNow IDEs used to be really basic like\nthat back in well, in the 1980s.\n\n15\n00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,180\nBut in today's world, IDEs normally have\na lot of additional functionality, too.\n\n16\n00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,280\nLike helping us check for\nerrors in our source code.\n\n17\n00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,430\nSo as we start to write our programming\nlanguage, if there's any mistakes in\n\n18\n00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,840\nthere, it'll help you spot them even\nbefore you compile and run them.\n\n19\n00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,320\nWell, power shell is not\na programming language.\n\n20\n00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,420\nIt's really a scripting language.\n\n21\n00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,980\nAnd so, Microsoft wanted to create an IDE,\nbut for a scripting language.\n\n22\n00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,430\nThat's why they call it power shell ISE.\n\n23\n00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,470\nAnd it works just like those IDE's do.\n\n24\n00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,330\nWe can write our PowerShell scripts and\nit will check them If there's a mistake or\n\n25\n00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,330\nerror it will try and\nhighlight that for us.\n\n26\n00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,390\nAnd it gives us the ability to run\nthem right from a single environment.\n\n27\n00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,230\nNow the PowerShell ISC was\nintroduced in PowerShell 2.0.\n\n28\n00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,530\nIt wasn't in the original one,\nthey added it after the fact.\n\n29\n00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,680\nAnd it's gotten more\nadvanced over the years.\n\n30\n00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,760\nSo in the newer versions we actually\nhave what's called IntelliSense, and\n\n31\n00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,800\nthat's where you start\nto type a command and\n\n32\n00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,920\nit'll actually give you suggestions\nas to what should go after it.\n\n33\n00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,920\nNow we have tab auto complete\nthat kind of does that, but\n\n34\n00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,810\nwhat I'm talking about are when\nwe specify those property values.\n\n35\n00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,970\nSo, you might have seen in some of the\nepisodes where I'll do something like when\n\n36\n00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,710\nI'm pipelining some of the commands, I'll\nsay dollar sign underscore dot name and\n\n37\n00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,470\nthat's saying dot name,\nthat's the property I want.\n\n38\n00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,300\nFrom dollar sign underscore, that's\nthe result of a previous command, right?\n\n39\n00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,290\nWell, with IntelliSense on, you can\ntype dollar sign underscore dot and\n\n40\n00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,570\nall of a sudden it'll give you a list\nof the properties to pick from.\n\n41\n00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,770\nAnd so instead of having to\nremember the property name myself,\n\n42\n00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,180\nI can just pick it right there\nfrom that list and off you go.\n\n43\n00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,000\nThat makes writing scripts a lot easier.\n\n44\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,980\nIt's definitely something that\nmakes things more convenient.\n\n45\n00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,190\nAnd you can have one central place\nto edit and work with your scripts.\n\n46\n00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,930\nLoad them, run them, and work with them.\n\n47\n00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,510\nAlright, now PowerShell ISE is installed\nautomatically as a part of the PowerShell.\n\n48\n00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,710\nSo, if you've got PowerShell,\nyou've got PowerShell ISE.\n\n49\n00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,970\nTo launch it, Well,\nyou just run it, right?\n\n50\n00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,760\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n51\n00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,240\nIn Windows Server 2012, which is what I'm\nrunning, the power shell icon is added to\n\n52\n00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,970\nthe task bar automatically and\nif you right click on it,\n\n53\n00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,530\nyou'll see one of the options right\nhere is the Windows Powershell ISE.\n\n54\n00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,488\nYou can even run it as\nan administrator if you want.\n\n55\n00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:06,070\nOn Windows seven, and Windows Server 2008,\nit's under your start menu,\n\n56\n00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,250\nyou can go under there and\nyou'll find Windows PowerShell ISE.\n\n57\n00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,490\nWhen you launch the ISE,\nit's gonna look something like this.\n\n58\n00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,100\nThe window is made up of three panes.\n\n59\n00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,820\nIn the first pane, this is your code.\n\n60\n00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,220\nThis is what you're writing.\n\n61\n00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,229\nThe script or\ncommands that you're gonna be executing.\n\n62\n00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,970\nAt the bottom you have\na power shell window.\n\n63\n00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,760\nThis is an active power shell window.\n\n64\n00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,770\nI can get in here,\nrun get-help or whatever and\n\n65\n00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,038\nactually, did you guys see\nIntelliSense kick in there?\n\n66\n00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,060\nI type get-h.\n\n67\n00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,340\nOh now It's not gonna do it cuz I there,\nlet's try that again, there.\n\n68\n00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,920\nI typed get-h and it's already showing me\nall the commands that start with get-h.\n\n69\n00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,240\nHelp, history, host, hotfix, and\n\n70\n00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,740\nit's even showing me their\nsyntax all right here in line.\n\n71\n00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,110\nAnd I can just ignore that and\nkeep typing, and\n\n72\n00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,860\nit's gonna keep updating\nto show what I'm typing.\n\n73\n00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,240\nRight?\nSo, really kind of\n\n74\n00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,390\na neat thing there that it does that.\n\n75\n00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,070\nThat's what intellisense adds.\n\n76\n00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,120\nSo even if I'm not worried\nabout writing scripts.\n\n77\n00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,710\nI might still use this just to make it\neasier to get the commands that I want.\n\n78\n00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,270\nSo I can type get-help and\nrun it and there went my help file.\n\n79\n00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,930\nAnd I can scroll back up and\nread that, there it is.\n\n80\n00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,620\nThe same as a regular PowerShell session.\n\n81\n00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,770\nThis is just a PowerShell window down\nhere with Intelliscents added on top.\n\n82\n00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,690\nAll right.\n\n83\n00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,850\nOn the right side of the screen,\nI can see all of my commands.\n\n84\n00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,170\nThere's a giant list of all\nthe commands right here.\n\n85\n00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,160\nThat's rapidly searchable, and\nI can filter it by module.\n\n86\n00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,970\nSo I can say, you know what,\nI just wanna see the DNS commands.\n\n87\n00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,960\nSo let me get down here to DNS server.\n\n88\n00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,160\nAnd now I'm just seeing\nthe DNS server commands.\n\n89\n00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,570\nSo cool part about that\nis if I'm down here and\n\n90\n00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,790\nI'm running commands,\nup here I can choose a command and\n\n91\n00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,960\nit's gonna give me information on it and\nyou know my head's sitting on top of it.\n\n92\n00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,470\nLet me change my window size.\n\n93\n00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,610\nThere you go.\n\n94\n00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,870\nSo it's showing me the command right\nthere, giving me a basic description.\n\n95\n00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,670\nAnd then I've got the insert and\ncopy options.\n\n96\n00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,110\nIf I hit insert, it's going to\ninsert it wherever my cursor was.\n\n97\n00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,650\nSo my cursor was down here, apparently\nI hit some extra letter as there.\n\n98\n00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,750\nMy cursor was down here, and when I hit\ninsert, it added it in there for me.\n\n99\n00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,570\nOr up here, if I come down and\nedit this little script file.\n\n100\n00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,360\nAnd I hit insert, it's gonna throw it in,\noh actually it threw it in down there but\n\n101\n00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,870\nit should have thrown it in up here.\n\n102\n00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,400\nBut quick, easy way to do that,\n\n103\n00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,100\nwe can also do copy and\nthen just come in and paste it.\n\n104\n00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,120\nAnd there it is too.\n\n105\n00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,150\nSo, oh!\n\n106\n00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,540\nI know what to do with the a's,\nit's an IPV6 record right?\n\n107\n00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,850\nSo we're adding a resource record or\nAAAA, that would be an IPV6 record.\n\n108\n00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,510\nAll right, so kind of neat, right,\n\n109\n00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,820\nit's all designed to make your\nlife a little bit easier.\n\n110\n00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,060\nThe other nice thing about it is you can\nhave more than one script open at a time\n\n111\n00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,460\nso the one I'm looking at it\nright now is profile dot .ps1.\n\n112\n00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,720\nIf you watch the segment on customizing\nthe user interface for PowerShell.\n\n113\n00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,790\nThis is the script that I wrote in\nthat episode that had all the various\n\n114\n00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,620\nsettings to configure my system.\n\n115\n00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,340\nAnd it's laid that out.\n\n116\n00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,110\nAnd it's colorized it.\n\n117\n00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,510\nThe coloring is designed to help me\nrecognize when i've made mistakes and\n\n118\n00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,400\nother things.\n\n119\n00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,850\nSo notice like dollar sign console here,\nthat's a variable.\n\n120\n00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,990\nAnd then the property after it foreground\ncolor is listed and it's in black.\n\n121\n00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,920\nIt's letting me know that there\nis a difference between those two\n\n122\n00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,230\nas far as what their purpose is.\n\n123\n00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,190\nAnd let me just kind of zoom in on this\na little bit so you can see it better.\n\n124\n00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,630\nBut you can see that coloring.\n\n125\n00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,900\nSo all my variable names are nice and\nbright red so I can spot where I'm using\n\n126\n00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,950\nthose variables and\nthen I can see the various modifications.\n\n127\n00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:42,090\nNow when I defined this dollar sign\nconsole I pointed at it, host.UI.rawUI and\n\n128\n00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,470\nI started pulling up things like\nforeground color and background color.\n\n129\n00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,250\nHere's another area where IntelliSense\ncan come in really handy.\n\n130\n00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,660\nSee how I'm starting according to type and\n\n131\n00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,260\nit recognizes that variable\nthat I've created.\n\n132\n00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,960\nAnd I just hit tab to select it.\n\n133\n00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,130\nWhatever's highlighted it'll hit tab and\nit'll punch it in.\n\n134\n00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,040\nYou can hit enter it does the same thing.\n\n135\n00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,830\nAnd then when I do a period if I'm\nactually referencing the real item\n\n136\n00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,180\nthen it'll start to give me\nthe suggestions to be on that.\n\n137\n00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,816\nAnd apparently it's not\ngoing to pull that one.\n\n138\n00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:14,480\nSo let's do post.ui.rawui.\n\n139\n00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,660\nThere we go.\n\n140\n00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,140\nAnd as I start to go under raw ui\nnow I can see background color,\n\n141\n00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,810\nbuffer size, cursor position,\nkey available, foreground color.\n\n142\n00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,010\nAll the various other entries that I\nmight use as a part of that, right?\n\n143\n00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,970\nSo, now if I'm somebody who has bad\nmemory, which is exactly how I am, and\n\n144\n00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,710\nI can't quite remember the exact syntax,\nI just have to type a little bit and\n\n145\n00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,950\nit will give me all the suggestions and\nthen I can just pick from the list, right.\n\n146\n00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,780\nThat makes it a lot easier.\n\n147\n00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,250\nSo when you're writing a script,\nPowerShell ISE is really handy.\n\n148\n00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,634\nNow when it's just a series of commands\nlike this is not too terribly spectacular.\n\n149\n00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,893\nWhere it gets really handy is when\nyou're doing things like functions.\n\n150\n00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:55,994\nAnd here's that function\nwhere I customize the prompt.\n\n151\n00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,477\nAnd see what its done?\n\n152\n00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,281\nIt's colorized it so that I know\nthat prompt is the function, and\n\n153\n00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,601\nthen I opened those curly brackets,\nand it went ahead and\n\n154\n00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:09,870\ncreated where I can compact that, because\nit knows it's all part of the function.\n\n155\n00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,480\nAnd the reason it's doing that is a lot\nof people prefer to lay things out\n\n156\n00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,040\na little bit more cleanly.\n\n157\n00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,560\nWhere you indent lines, this is\ncalled good coding etiquette, right,\n\n158\n00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,770\nmaking it nice, neat, and\neasy to read and recognize.\n\n159\n00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,020\nSo we might have it laid out a little bit\ndifferently, and they just wanna make\n\n160\n00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,300\nit easy for us to collapse and\nbe able to occupy a little less space.\n\n161\n00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,730\nNow if I make a mistake,\nsee that little red,\n\n162\n00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,010\ncurly underline there letting me know\nthat there's some kind of a mistake here?\n\n163\n00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,950\nSo it's warning me about that, and\nI can look for those little underlines and\n\n164\n00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,170\nthat'll help me to isolate\nwhere there's a problem.\n\n165\n00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:48,010\nOr if I forget to close my curly bracket\nlike that, it's kind of hard to see, but\n\n166\n00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,720\nthere's a red curly underline\nunder that bracket now,\n\n167\n00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,560\nletting me know there's something\nwrong with that bracket.\n\n168\n00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,490\nNow I've got an idea.\n\n169\n00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,820\nI can say well,\nalright there's something wrong with that,\n\n170\n00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,250\nlet me look and\ncan see if I've got a close, and I don't.\n\n171\n00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,580\nAnd I can put it back in.\n\n172\n00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,110\nNow it closes and it's healthy.\n\n173\n00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,460\nAlright that's called syntax validation.\n\n174\n00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,770\nIt's just checking to make sure that my\nsyntax is correct before letting it run.\n\n175\n00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,230\nWhen I write a script like this,\n\n176\n00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,490\nyou can actually hit this little play\nbutton right here and it'll run it.\n\n177\n00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,200\nSo I can run this script from here.\n\n178\n00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,370\nAnd it's gonna run it.\n\n179\n00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,820\nIt's telling me it's about to save it.\n\n180\n00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,200\nI haven't saved it so.\n\n181\n00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,890\nI'll say okay and\nit just ran it down here.\n\n182\n00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,980\nAnd I can see that my\nprompt has changed and\n\n183\n00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,540\napparently I've inserted\nsome more commands somehow.\n\n184\n00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,670\nBut it went ahead and ran that script and\nnow it's got that entered in here.\n\n185\n00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,380\nWith my new prompt colors,\nand all that stuff.\n\n186\n00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,240\nLooks like some of it didn't take effect.\n\n187\n00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,160\nI was changing that syntax and\nbecause it does colorizing,\n\n188\n00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200\nthe color changes that I put in\naren't necessarily taking effect.\n\n189\n00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,590\nAnd apparently it wants to turn it purple.\n\n190\n00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,530\nBut, it did turn green there for a second.\n\n191\n00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,950\nSo you'll see where it is\nactually taking effect.\n\n192\n00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,350\nBut, it's kind of neat\nto be able to do that.\n\n193\n00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,850\nJust start to write your script and\ntest it out.\n\n194\n00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,090\nNow there's a few features\nin here that I really like.\n\n195\n00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,790\nI 've talked about\nIntelliSense it's pretty cool.\n\n196\n00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,360\nAnother one is selective execution.\n\n197\n00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,730\nMaybe I don't want to\ntest my whole script,\n\n198\n00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,070\nmaybe I just want to test part of it.\n\n199\n00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,350\nSo I had a problem with my prompt and\nI want to change that.\n\n200\n00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,030\nSo, right now,\nI'm displaying the current folder.\n\n201\n00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,900\nAnd I decide, you know what?\n\n202\n00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,120\nI'm gonna change that.\n\n203\n00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,550\nInstead of displaying the current folder,\nI wanna come in and\n\n204\n00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,270\ndisplay the current date, right?\n\n205\n00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,840\nSo I might choose to\ncomment out some code.\n\n206\n00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,390\nI'll just put a little hash mark there.\n\n207\n00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,210\nAnd see how that all just turned green?\n\n208\n00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,220\nThat's letting me know that that's not\ngonna run, that's gonna get ignored.\n\n209\n00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,728\nAnd on this next line,\nI'm gonna take $ current folder and\n\n210\n00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:50,100\nI'm just gonna replace that with let's\nsee, get dash date should do for me.\n\n211\n00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,040\nI'll be get dash date.\n\n212\n00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,580\nAlright, and I can't remember with get\ndate if I have to stick a dollar sign\n\n213\n00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,580\nbefore that or not, I don't think I do.\n\n214\n00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,280\nWell, I can test.\n\n215\n00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,840\nI don't necessarily want to test my\nwhole script, I can just highlight that\n\n216\n00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,900\nfunction, and now when I go up and\nhit Execute, it's only going to run\n\n217\n00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,690\nthat little piece, well, actually\nthis one will run the whole thing.\n\n218\n00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,630\nThe button right beside it,\nthat guy, runs selection.\n\n219\n00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,370\nThat's the one that's just gonna\nrun what I've got highlighted and\n\n220\n00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,140\nwhen I run that it's just gonna\nrun the line that I provided.\n\n221\n00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,620\nSo it runs that function and\nsure enough my prompt changes and\n\n222\n00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,340\nnow it's got that data in there.\n\n223\n00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,300\nBut I'm kind of having a hard time reading\nthat because the prompt is a dark blue so\n\n224\n00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,050\nI might want to go in here and\nchange that prompt color.\n\n225\n00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:34,870\nWhere did I set that?\n\n226\n00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,330\nSomewhere in here I set the prompt color.\n\n227\n00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,040\nOh actually it was in that function.\n\n228\n00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,630\nSo I might choose to change that to\nsomething a little bit brighter like white\n\n229\n00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,290\nand so now I can go in and take that.\n\n230\n00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,810\nAnd I will selectively\nrun just that piece.\n\n231\n00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,020\nNow the prompt is nice and white.\n\n232\n00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,900\nEasy for me to read and I can spot it.\n\n233\n00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:00,410\nSo quick and easy ways to modify your\nsyntax, test it, ensure that it's working.\n\n234\n00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,610\nWhen it's working we can\nthen save this script.\n\n235\n00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,960\nCopy it over to our server and\nrun it there.\n\n236\n00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,050\nAnd we know it's gonna run right the first\ntime because we've already tested it and\n\n237\n00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,420\ndebugged it, and worked with it\nright here inside of PowerShell ISE.\n\n238\n00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,700\nSo pretty neat.\n\n239\n00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,850\nYou'll see I've got\na second script open here.\n\n240\n00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,240\nThis one was pretty basic.\n\n241\n00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,950\nThis is just basic stuff.\n\n242\n00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,880\nBut here's a more complex one that\nwas written by the guys at Microsoft.\n\n243\n00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,290\nSo this one is a active\ndirectory user creation script.\n\n244\n00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,710\nSo it's designed to import a csv and\n\n245\n00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,570\ncreate active directory users for\nevery entry inside of the csv.\n\n246\n00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,580\nAnd so if I start to scroll down you'll\nsee where there's a lot of variables and\n\n247\n00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,520\nfunctions and syntax.\n\n248\n00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,700\nAnd when you're writing a complex\nfile like this, it can get really,\n\n249\n00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,640\nreally difficult to keep track\nof all the different settings.\n\n250\n00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,480\nSo as you go through here,\nit's helping you.\n\n251\n00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,200\nKinda helping you keep track of that.\n\n252\n00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,780\nAnd laying it out and spotting when\nyou're missing those brackets and so on.\n\n253\n00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,480\nDefinitely making life a lot easier for\nyou.\n\n254\n00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,310\nAlright, so that's the power shell ISE.\n\n255\n00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,940\nIt does have more features like\ndebugging for trying to find errors.\n\n256\n00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,260\nYou can actually do a stepped execution,\n\n257\n00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,680\nwhere when it runs it'll just go\nthrough and run to a certain point.\n\n258\n00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,850\nYou can do other things.\n\n259\n00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,600\nThere's add-ons that you can punch\ninto it that extend its functionality.\n\n260\n00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,325\nThere's a lot of neat\nstuff that's in there.\n\n261\n00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:24,095\nOne problem with the PowerShell ISE though\n\n262\n00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,105\nis that Microsoft's got a pretty\ntight stranglehold on it.\n\n263\n00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:32,100\nAnd they're not really allowing a lot of\nother people to do too much extra to it.\n\n264\n00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,150\nSo you can write some add ons to it.\n\n265\n00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,630\nBut the add ons don't really deviate too\nfar from what you can do in the PowerShell\n\n266\n00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,060\nalready, all right?\n\n267\n00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,720\nAnd that's led other companies to create\nsoftware that's very similar to this.\n\n268\n00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,740\nThere's a company out there, or there\nwas a company out there, called Quest.\n\n269\n00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,830\nAnd I liked Quest.\n\n270\n00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,530\nEvery product they made was great.\n\n271\n00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,300\nWell, Dell bought them a few years ago,\nso now it's from Dell.\n\n272\n00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:01,600\nBut Quest had created this, open,\nfreely available program called PowerGUI.\n\n273\n00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,730\nAnd it was designed to be an integrated\nscripting environment for PowerShell.\n\n274\n00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,680\nWell, you might ask yourself,\nwe've already got Powershell ISE,\n\n275\n00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,220\nwhy would we want this other one?\n\n276\n00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,560\nWell, the other one really does the same\nstuff, everything that we just saw,\n\n277\n00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,340\nall that PowerGUI does also, but it's a\nlittle more open, and they allow people to\n\n278\n00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,960\nwrite all sorts of additional tools for\nit to extend its functionality.\n\n279\n00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,450\nSo there's a lot of people out there that\nprefer the power GUI to the power ISC.\n\n280\n00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,164\nNow, Powershell ISC, it's included with\nPowershell so if I'm gonna use one,\n\n281\n00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:32,370\nthat's the one that I'm gonna use.\n\n282\n00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,160\nBut, I do wanna bring up the other one\nbecause you will see it mentioned on\n\n283\n00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,970\nwebpages and other places,\na lot of people do like it.\n\n284\n00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,970\nIt's got some neat stuff that\nyou don't necessarily get here.\n\n285\n00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,138\nOne of my favorite ones, let me\nswitch over to [COUGH] the power GUI.\n\n286\n00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:49,912\nAll right.\n\n287\n00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:56,250\n[COUGH]\nSo if we look here, this is the power GUI,\n\n288\n00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,930\nand the screen is very similar to what\nwe saw over in the power shell ISE.\n\n289\n00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,100\nWhen we look in here I've got\nmy files that I have open.\n\n290\n00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,350\nNow, that's a little bit different, right?\n\n291\n00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,870\nI didn't have that in the ISE,\nbut here I've got this\n\n292\n00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,490\nfolder that I've navigated to, and\nall of the files that are inside of it.\n\n293\n00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,090\nSo, it gives you a quick navigation.\n\n294\n00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,865\nAnd you can hide that\nif you don't want it.\n\n295\n00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,045\nAnd now we're a little bit\nmore in line with the ISE.\n\n296\n00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:22,595\nI can see my script right here.\n\n297\n00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:24,035\nWhat it is that I'm writing.\n\n298\n00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,755\nAnd I can zoom in on that.\n\n299\n00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:30,325\nAnd so here's that same profile\nscript from a moment ago.\n\n300\n00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:32,580\nNothing too terribly spectacular there.\n\n301\n00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,080\nAnd if I go to that create\nad users one I can see it.\n\n302\n00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,060\nAnd here it is laid out.\n\n303\n00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,909\nSo we get full syntax highlighting,\nhelping us spot those errors,\n\n304\n00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,472\nas we work with our system.\n\n305\n00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:45,924\nSo if I go through and I take something\nlike removing that squiggly bracket\n\n306\n00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:48,039\nwhich breaks that bracket,\nnow I can look and\n\n307\n00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,545\nI guess it's probably hard to see on\nthe camera but there's a little yellow\n\n308\n00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:54,906\nbar right there letting me know that\nthere's some kind of issue there.\n\n309\n00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:58,462\nAn issue Is that I didn't\nclose out that bracket.\n\n310\n00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:01,222\nAnd so if I close it,\nit's gonna kinda clean that up and\n\n311\n00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:03,040\nget that sorted out for me.\n\n312\n00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,320\nSo it's tracking that stuff,\nhelping me to locate issues.\n\n313\n00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:14,980\nIntelliSense is a copyright, trademarked,\nproprietary technology from Microsoft.\n\n314\n00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,750\nSo it doesn't have straight\nup IntelliSense, but\n\n315\n00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,120\nit has something kind of to replace it.\n\n316\n00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,140\nIf we take a look at me typing here,\n\n317\n00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,880\nsee how it is automatically\nproviding me with stuff.\n\n318\n00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,440\nSo they don't call this IntelliSense\nbecause that's copyrighted, but\n\n319\n00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,610\nit is the same basic idea and\nI'm seeing those same options here,\n\n320\n00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,050\nall the different things that\nI can specify, all right?\n\n321\n00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,440\nOne of the things that I like is,\nin this, I created a bunch of variables.\n\n322\n00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,958\nWell, if I look over here,\n\n323\n00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,510\nyou can see where it's actually\nsuggesting some various variables to me.\n\n324\n00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,248\nThings like Scriptroute and\nprevious commands,\n\n325\n00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:52,055\nthese little double ampersands and stuff.\n\n326\n00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:55,226\nAnd so you'll see some of the variables\nthat are available up here there and\n\n327\n00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:56,850\nit'll change based on your context.\n\n328\n00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,152\nSo depending on where you're\nworking inside of the PowerShell,\n\n329\n00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,245\nyou may see some, or all of those, or\neven more, based on what you're running.\n\n330\n00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:10,890\nSo, if I were to take this script and\nrun it ,it's gonna execute and as it runs.\n\n331\n00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,380\nI guess it ran kind of fast there,\ndidn't it?\n\n332\n00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,148\nBut as it runs,\n\n333\n00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:19,810\nthis variable screen will actually update\nto show when those variables get created.\n\n334\n00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,690\nAnd so now I can see there's $console.\n\n335\n00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,040\nWe should see $scrollback, $window.\n\n336\n00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,330\nThose are the variables that I\nmade as part of the script and so\n\n337\n00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,860\nit's showing them and\nwhat their values are.\n\n338\n00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,320\nSo I can see by the time\nthis script finishes\n\n339\n00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,910\nwhat did each of those variables contain?\n\n340\n00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,676\nSo it gives us visibility into something\nwe wouldn't normally see, and my prompt,\n\n341\n00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:42,700\nI should have changed\nit back to white again.\n\n342\n00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,580\nIt's really hard to see\nwhen it's that dark blue.\n\n343\n00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,140\nLet me rerun that.\n\n344\n00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,045\nSo I'll just rerun it, there we go.\n\n345\n00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:54,570\nSo I can see that my prompt did update,\nI've got my new syntax here,\n\n346\n00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,860\nand if I run Get-help,\nit's gonna run that and\n\n347\n00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,090\nthat output is gonna come up here on\nthe screen and it scrolled past it.\n\n348\n00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,010\nI guess my foreground color\nhas changed to black somehow.\n\n349\n00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,350\nI shouldn't say black,\nit's all right here, isn't it.\n\n350\n00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,690\nLet me just make my\nforeground color white,\n\n351\n00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,191\nmy background color blue,\nand we'll re-execute.\n\n352\n00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,460\nHere we go, and now we can write Get-Help.\n\n353\n00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,590\nNotice when I type Get-Help,\nit's not actually letting me type\n\n354\n00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,990\nhere in the console, it's making me\ntype down here, in this separate bar.\n\n355\n00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,630\nThat's kind of nice, it does make it\na little easier to edit because up here,\n\n356\n00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,860\nif you have a mistake\nhalfway through your command,\n\n357\n00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,110\nyou can't just click your cursor and\nbe halfway.\n\n358\n00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,040\nYou have to use your arrow keys, but down\nhere I can click my cursor wherever I want\n\n359\n00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,440\nand it'll jump around and\nget to it, and that's kind of nice.\n\n360\n00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,060\nAnd your history still works.\n\n361\n00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,345\nYou can still use up and down arrows while\nyou're down here to pull up the commands\n\n362\n00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:54,080\nthat you've typed before,\nso that's kind of nice.\n\n363\n00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,749\nBut now that's gonna run and\nthere's my output.\n\n364\n00:18:56,749 --> 00:19:01,829\nI guess my foreground stayed black,\nwhich is not showing up on.\n\n365\n00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:05,901\nWhat you guys are seeing, you're just\nseeing the blue plane there, but\n\n366\n00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:09,790\nit's just black on blue,\nwhich is practically impossible to read.\n\n367\n00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,156\nYeah, I guess my foreground\ncolor is just not taking effect.\n\n368\n00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:17,680\nWell, in Power GUI I know we have the\nsettings, if I go into the preferences or\n\n369\n00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,790\noptions, you can go in there and\ncustomize the colors somewhere in here.\n\n370\n00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,330\nWell, whatever,\nI don't wanna fight with all that.\n\n371\n00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,550\nBut you can get that changed and\nget everything kind of in place.\n\n372\n00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,105\nAnd it's neat.\n\n373\n00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,625\nYou know, it's just another\nsimple way to work the thing.\n\n374\n00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,955\nThe PowerGUI itself is not necessarily\ndistinct from PowerShell ISE,\n\n375\n00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:41,515\nuntil you get to the add-ons.\n\n376\n00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:46,155\nWith PowerGUI, what really makes it\nspecial is what they call PowerPacks.\n\n377\n00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:49,135\nAnd pretty much anybody can write\nPowerPacks to stick on here and\n\n378\n00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:51,535\ndo all sorts of crazy other things.\n\n379\n00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:55,570\nIt's kinda like adding modules to\nPowerShell, and they're available for\n\n380\n00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,320\ndownload right from the PowerGUI\nsite which, if you ever wanna go to,\n\n381\n00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,400\nis PowerGUI.org and it'll redirect to\nDell because Dell controls it now.\n\n382\n00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,315\nSo if you go to PowerGUI.org, you'll end\nup right here on the Dell Tech Center.\n\n383\n00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:12,095\nAnd this is the PowerGUI page, and\nyou can download it from here.\n\n384\n00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:15,355\nThey've got their documentation and\nother information.\n\n385\n00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:20,200\nAnd in here, they've got a link somewhere,\nright here, that goes to the PowerPacks.\n\n386\n00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,270\nAnd when you go into the PowerPacks,\n\n387\n00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,790\nyou'll see they've got ones for\nall sorts of things.\n\n388\n00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:30,110\nThey've got Windows Media Player, Twitter,\nFacebook, you'll find Amazon Web Services,\n\n389\n00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,580\nall sorts of PowerPacks they've added\nto create that additional functionality\n\n390\n00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,240\nwithout having to go and install\nthe management tools for that software.\n\n391\n00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,460\nThat's kinda nice.\n\n392\n00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,980\nWith the PowerShell ISE, a lot of the\nadd-ons to it come with the software so\n\n393\n00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,150\nyou've gotta go and install that, and\nthat makes it a little more challenging.\n\n394\n00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,170\nSo, you'll see a lot of neat\nstuff in there, it's pretty cool.\n\n395\n00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,540\nSo the PowerShell ISE or the PowerGUI,\nthey really do the same thing.\n\n396\n00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,300\nThey're giving you that graphical\ndevelopment type interface\n\n397\n00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,790\nthat lets you write out a script,\ndo debugging, checking,\n\n398\n00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,880\nand testing,\nall from a controlled environment.\n\n399\n00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,700\nAnd then when it's ready, you save your\nscript, you take it over to a server, and\n\n400\n00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,130\nyou execute it knowing that the script\nwill work right the first time,\n\n401\n00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,910\nbecause you've already done thorough\ntesting and development, right?\n\n402\n00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,170\nThat's what PowerShell ISE is for.\n\n403\n00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,260\nNow, a lot of people aren't even\naware of the PowerShell ISE, but\n\n404\n00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,020\nit is installed by default.\n\n405\n00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,540\nIt's just most people click\non the icon down here, and\n\n406\n00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,210\nnever think about right-clicking\non it to see these other options.\n\n407\n00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,633\nBut even in your screen, if you go and\npull up your start screen and\n\n408\n00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:37,695\nstart typing in PowerShell, you'll see\nwhere the ISE shows up right there.\n\n409\n00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:42,814\nSo, it is available, it's a part of\nPowerShell from 2.0 on, it's there.\n\n410\n00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:47,000\nAll right, it seems like there's\nsomething else that I wanted to mention.\n\n411\n00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,570\nOh, one other nice thing that I\nlike to use with PowerShell ISE\n\n412\n00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,270\nis it has context-sensitive help, and\nlet me show you what I mean by that.\n\n413\n00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,774\nIf I go back into PowerShell,\ninto the PowerShell ISE,\n\n414\n00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:02,380\nI'm gonna do an all new file.\n\n415\n00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,150\nRight, so I'm just getting started.\n\n416\n00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,410\nWell, if I hit F1 on my keyboard,\n\n417\n00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,660\nit's gonna pull up the help\ndocumentation just for PowerShell.\n\n418\n00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,220\nSo here it is, PowerShell ISE,\nits help file.\n\n419\n00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,850\nBut if I start typing, so\nif I'm doing Get-Help and\n\n420\n00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,290\nthen I press F1, it's gonna take\nme to the help documentation.\n\n421\n00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,640\nAnd [LAUGH] it totally failed to do it.\n\n422\n00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,210\nIt's supposed to take me to the health\ndocumentation for Get-Help.\n\n423\n00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,220\nDid I not have my cursor\nin the right spot?\n\n424\n00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,760\nLet's try that again.\n\n425\n00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,740\nThere we go.\n\n426\n00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,970\nI put my cursor on Get-Help this time.\n\n427\n00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,930\nAnd there it goes,\nit popped up the right window.\n\n428\n00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,760\nAnd I'm getting the help for that command,\nso I didn't have to run Get-Help myself,\n\n429\n00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,390\nit actually ran it for me and it did\nthat show window modifier to make it\n\n430\n00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,350\npop up in an extra window and now I've got\nthe syntax for that command right here.\n\n431\n00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,910\nJust by using the F1 key, you click on the\ncommand you want help on, you hit F1 and\n\n432\n00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,860\nit comes up and\nyou could even pick other things.\n\n433\n00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,180\nYou know, I've got get-date right here.\n\n434\n00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,200\nAnd if we go on pullet,\nhere's the help forget-date.\n\n435\n00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,730\nSo not even from my script up here,\n\n436\n00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,390\njust from the actual console window and\nit gave me the help that I needed.\n\n437\n00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,960\nPretty cool, pretty convenient, right.\n\n438\n00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,660\nThose are some of the things\nthat we get with PowerShell ISE\n\n439\n00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,390\nthat are a lot easier to work with\nthan just being in the console itself.\n\n440\n00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,820\nAll right, well,\nthat's all I've got on those.\n\n441\n00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,780\nObviously there's a lot of\npower to those utilities.\n\n442\n00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,330\nDefinitely experiment around with them,\nbut for\n\n443\n00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,952\nmost people that's the basic functionality\nthat you need to use them successfully.\n\n444\n00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,788\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n445\n00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:37,141\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n446\n00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:42,900\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.890\nIn this segment we're gonna take\na look at PowerShell drives.\n\n3\n00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.970\nNow, most of us have worked with hard\ndrives at one point or another and\n\n4\n00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.950\nif you're using the PowerShell,\nit's pretty likely that you have too.\n\n5\n00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.830\nAnd so we're used to the way of thinking\nthat's been available inside of Windows\n\n6\n00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.280\nand DOS way back 20, 30 years ago,\nwhere we have a folder structure and\n\n7\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.460\nwe navigate around on our\nhard drive to access files.\n\n8\n00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.875\nWell, you can do all that\nin the PowerShell, too, but\n\n9\n00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:38.720\nin the PowerShell,\nthey're not actually files.\n\n10\n00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.720\nThey look like they are.\n\n11\n00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.880\nIt looks like we're browsing\naround in that folder structure,\n\n12\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.395\nbut we really aren't.\n\n13\n00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:49.410\nPowerShell, the whole interface, is really\njust kind of emulating what we're used to.\n\n14\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.050\nAnd that means in PowerShell, because\nthese aren't really the folder structures\n\n15\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.240\nthat we're looking at, it can represent\nall sorts of things as a drive letter.\n\n16\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.930\nSo, when I say PowerShell drives,\nI'm not just talking about your C drive or\n\n17\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.360\na file system.\n\n18\n00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.220\nA PowerShell drive could\npoint to a lot of things.\n\n19\n00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.290\nThings like the registry or\nyour variable store,\n\n20\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.710\nyour alias store, it can point to\nall sorts of of really cool things.\n\n21\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.250\nAnd allows you to navigate around and\n\n22\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.820\nwork with it as if it were\npart of the file system.\n\n23\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.820\nSo it takes this older mentality, this\nmethodology we've been using for years and\n\n24\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.360\nyears and years, and then places\nit on top of other technologies,\n\n25\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.580\nwhich is really powerful.\n\n26\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.230\nLet me show you some examples and we'll\nkind of get an idea of how this works.\n\n27\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.440\nAnd then we'll do and a few more segments\nlater on when we'll show how to work with\n\n28\n00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.270\nspecific entities inside of it.\n\n29\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.830\nBut let's just start by\ntaking a look at how\n\n30\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.990\nregular file system functions\nhappen inside of PowerShell.\n\n31\n00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.545\nSo I'm going to fire up my PowerShell.\n\n32\n00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.980\nAnd once we're in, it gives me\na representation that's a file system.\n\n33\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.080\nRight, I see I'm in C:\\Users\\Don Pezet.\n\n34\n00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.700\nAnd if I want to change directories and\n\n35\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.985\nthings like that,\nI can do cd..to move up one directory.\n\n36\n00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:06.765\nOr, if I'm in my own directory like that,\n\n37\n00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:09.745\nI could do cd\\,\nto go all the way to the root.\n\n38\n00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:12.785\nThose commands have been\npresent in Windows forever.\n\n39\n00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:14.635\nRight, and present in DOS before that.\n\n40\n00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:16.095\nThese are not anything new.\n\n41\n00:02:17.145 --> 00:02:20.625\nAnd if I've got a C drive and\na D drive, and an E drive,\n\n42\n00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:25.740\nI could always switch between those\nby typing e: or d:, and switching.\n\n43\n00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.370\nRight.\n\n44\n00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.110\nSo those commands that we're used to,\nthey're are still there, right,\n\n45\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.170\nthey still work.\n\n46\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.210\nBut they're really aliases.\n\n47\n00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.170\nNotice when I tried to change to e:, I\nwas trying to switch to that other drive.\n\n48\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.740\nLook at the error that I got,\n\n49\n00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.090\nwell I don't have an E drive\nright that's my first problem.\n\n50\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.660\nBut I got an error and\n\n51\n00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.060\nit's telling me that set location\ncannot find the drive, all right.\n\n52\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.895\nSo when I tried to switch by just typing\nE: it was actually hitting an alias for\n\n53\n00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:56.290\nset-location to try and\nchange that drive to access it.\n\n54\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.360\nAnd then just letting me know\nthat a drive doesn't exist for\n\n55\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.910\nthat name and it's a PowerShell object\nthat it's referencing down here.\n\n56\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.440\nNow, that object could actually\npoint to a lot of stuff, right.\n\n57\n00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.590\nIn fact, depending on\nthe software you've installed,\n\n58\n00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.420\nyou may have all sorts of crazy\nthings that even I don't.\n\n59\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.750\nBut let's take a look at the defaults.\n\n60\n00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.060\nI just have the default stuff on mine.\n\n61\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.862\nI'm going to run Get-PSDrives.\n\n62\n00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:22.880\nOops, sorry, it's not plural, Get-PSDrive.\n\n63\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.580\nThere we go.\n\n64\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.500\nSo when I do Get-PSDrive, it lists\nthe drives that I have on my system.\n\n65\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.200\nAnd I can see that I've\ngot a handful of them.\n\n66\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.630\nI did not make any of these, these were\nall put here by default in Windows.\n\n67\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.870\nAnd I can see the C drive.\n\n68\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.920\nRight.\nThere is that hard drive that I'm in\n\n69\n00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.950\nright now.\n\n70\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.280\nIt shows that I'm using 22 gigs of it,\nit's actually a 40 gig drive, and\n\n71\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.370\nit's a file system, and\nI reference it as C:\\.\n\n72\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.540\nI've got a D:\\ and an A:\\.\n\n73\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.150\nSo I've got a few other pads\nthere that I can navigate.\n\n74\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.430\nIn terms of the file system,\nthose are the ones we're used to, right?\n\n75\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.200\nBut what are all these other things?\n\n76\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.230\nWell, all the other ones that are listed\nhere are other types of drives, and\n\n77\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.420\nsome of them are really cool like\nthe registry ones right here.\n\n78\n00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.098\nH K C U.\n\n79\n00:04:13.098 --> 00:04:15.560\nWhat kind of drive letter is that?\n\n80\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.430\nIf I type HKCU:.\n\n81\n00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.510\nWell, it gives me an error right.\n\n82\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.250\nSo it's telling me here that it's not\nrecognizing the name of a command-let.\n\n83\n00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.010\nWell that's because it's not\nlike a single drive letter.\n\n84\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.030\nBut if I try and change directory into it,\nHKCU:, my path changes.\n\n85\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.110\nI just changed into a new drive.\n\n86\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.150\nA drive called HKCU.\n\n87\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.890\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n88\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.260\nWell that stands for H key current user.\n\n89\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.780\nThat's a registry hive.\n\n90\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.210\nIf you want to edit values or\nquery values from the registry,\n\n91\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.560\nyou can browse right into your\nregistry as if it were a file system.\n\n92\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.100\nAnd you can start to browse into here.\n\n93\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.030\nSo if I wanted to find things that\nrun when my computer starts, right?\n\n94\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.210\nSo I might go into HK current user,\nor HP current user.\n\n95\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.500\nGo into, what is it software?\n\n96\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.320\nLet's see if I can remember this one.\n\n97\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.616\nSoftware, Microsoft and Windows.\n\n98\n00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:15.785\nAnd current version.\n\n99\n00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:17.990\nAnd run I believe is the next folder.\n\n100\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.300\nYep, there it is.\n\n101\n00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.520\nSo I just browsed into my registry.\n\n102\n00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.220\nAnd I can just run a dir and\nsee if there's anything in there.\n\n103\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.850\nNow each of these providers\nworks a little bit differently.\n\n104\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.638\nAnd we're going to do a segment on\nthe registry a little bit later.\n\n105\n00:05:32.638 --> 00:05:34.100\nBut that dir command,\n\n106\n00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.960\nnormally it says show me all\nthe files that are in this folder.\n\n107\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.370\nWell, what files do I have\ninside of my registry?\n\n108\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.330\nNone.\n\n109\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.780\nThe dir command is not really functional,\nfor the registry.\n\n110\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.180\nInstead of looking for files,\nI should be looking for parameters.\n\n111\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.510\nRight?\nIn the registry,\n\n112\n00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.470\neach folder is called a key.\n\n113\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.220\nAnd that's what I've been\nnavigating right there, folder.\n\n114\n00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.640\nSo when I type dir, it's looking for\nfolders and it's not finding any.\n\n115\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.670\nSo now I need to look for parameters.\n\n116\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.380\nI need to start diving into it, and\nwe'll do a segment on the registry and\n\n117\n00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.460\nI'll show you guys how to do that.\n\n118\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.390\nHow to work with those\nregistry values in there.\n\n119\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.920\nBut what I wanted to show you though was\nthat I'm accessing the registry as if it\n\n120\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.700\nwas a file system.\n\n121\n00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.089\nThe same thing goes for things like\naliases and functions, when I did get-PS\n\n122\n00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:24.160\ndrive, I saw that I had Function,\nAlias, Variable, Cert, right.\n\n123\n00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.880\nEach one of these is pointing at\nsome kind of resource in my system.\n\n124\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.940\nCert, for example.\n\n125\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.270\nI didn't run this as an administrator, so\n\n126\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.530\nit's probably gonna get\nmad at me at one point.\n\n127\n00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.590\nBut if I change into that Cert directory,\nand I start looking around,\n\n128\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.740\nI can see I've got user certificates and\nlocal machine certificates.\n\n129\n00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.850\nI'll go into my user certificates,\nsince I should have access to that.\n\n130\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.710\nAnd I can pull it up and\n\n131\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.050\nI can start to see some of\nthe different folders I have in there.\n\n132\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.850\nSo if I want to see who I trust, right,\nmy trust certificates, or my certificates,\n\n133\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.880\nthe ones that are assigned to me.\n\n134\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.850\nI can go in here and start to look.\n\n135\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.850\nBut again it's looking for\nfiles, and I don't have any.\n\n136\n00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.880\nWell I guess it's possible I\ndon't have any certificates,\n\n137\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.540\nlet's test that out real quick.\n\n138\n00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.028\nSo if I go into my, oh,\nthat's not what I wanted.\n\n139\n00:07:11.434 --> 00:07:15.020\nI just want a, and let's see it's\ngonna fight me here isn't it.\n\n140\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.060\nWell you know I'll just make sure I have\na certificate here I'll encrypt something.\n\n141\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.690\nIf you just encrypt a single file on\nyour hard drive that will make it create\n\n142\n00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.650\na certificate for your user account and\nwe can do that real quick.\n\n143\n00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.060\nThere, so now at a minimum I'm\ngoing to have one certificate.\n\n144\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.480\nBut I have to be an administer?\n\n145\n00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.310\nOh, it's because it's in the root folder.\n\n146\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:35.930\nShoot.\n\n147\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.830\nThat should be fine as long\nas I'm still the owner.\n\n148\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.510\nIt's always something making things\nmore complex than they should be.\n\n149\n00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.660\nHere.\nI'll do something on the desktop\n\n150\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.200\njust be on the safe side; I'll take\nthis PowerShell script and encrypt it.\n\n151\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.882\nSo once that's encrypted well,\n\n152\n00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:51.834\nI need a certificate to be\nable to encrypt things, right.\n\n153\n00:07:51.834 --> 00:07:55.065\nSo when I encrypt that it's creating\nan EFS certificate for me and\n\n154\n00:07:55.065 --> 00:07:57.015\nthat should be one of my certificates.\n\n155\n00:07:57.015 --> 00:07:58.050\nAnd actually there is.\n\n156\n00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.701\nAll right.\n\n157\n00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:00.639\nSo I see that I do now have a certificate.\n\n158\n00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:03.560\nThere's the thumbprint for it and\nI can pull additional information.\n\n159\n00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.090\nThe certificate store is\nbeing represented as a drive,\n\n160\n00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.270\nas like a hard drive, on my system.\n\n161\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.190\nIt's a virtual drive, it's not real.\n\n162\n00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:12.840\nRight?\n\n163\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.940\nBut I can access it as if it was.\n\n164\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.430\nAnd that can be pretty convenient.\n\n165\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.190\nThat can make things a lot easier.\n\n166\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.900\nWe also saw alias, was another one.\n\n167\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.150\nSo if I, and I keep using CD right,\n\n168\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.470\nchange directory cuz that's what\nwe've used for 20, 30 years.\n\n169\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.560\nBut it's really set location.\n\n170\n00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.480\nSo I could say Set-Location alias, and\n\n171\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.540\nnow I'm in my alias drive and\nif I pull up a directory there.\n\n172\n00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.310\nHere's all the aliases that I've defined.\n\n173\n00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.950\nThe ones that are really fun, variables.\n\n174\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:47.214\nSo if I do a set location to variable,\n\n175\n00:08:47.214 --> 00:08:51.640\nwe go in here and here's the variables\nthat my system has right now.\n\n176\n00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.010\nSo I can look at all my variables and\nwhat their values are.\n\n177\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.740\nAnd these are constantly changing\nas we work, as we create things.\n\n178\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.800\nThey're being created, they're stored.\n\n179\n00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.711\nSo if I say something like $ console\n\n180\n00:09:06.711 --> 00:09:14.410\n=host.UI.RawUI something like that.\n\n181\n00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.650\nI can pull up my directory here, and\n\n182\n00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.370\nsomewhere in here I'll find\nthat console variable.\n\n183\n00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.658\nThere it is, there's console and\nsee how it's exploded it.\n\n184\n00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:25.600\nI did $ host when I defined it.\n\n185\n00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.925\nWell, Windows exploded\ndollar sign hosting to\n\n186\n00:09:27.925 --> 00:09:31.410\nsystem.management.automation.internal.h-\nost.\n\n187\n00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.090\nAnd so I didn't have to do that part.\n\n188\n00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.020\nIt did that.\n\n189\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.620\nAnd then it took where I\nmentioned UI.rawUI and\n\n190\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.960\nit exploded that into internal\nhost Rall user interface.\n\n191\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.252\nSo I can actually see\nwhat's in those variables.\n\n192\n00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:48.500\nAnd I'm really just working\nwith it like my file system.\n\n193\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.990\nWhat were some other ones.\n\n194\n00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.571\nWe do get-psdrive.\n\n195\n00:09:53.571 --> 00:09:55.971\nThere are some some fun ones in here.\n\n196\n00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:59.480\nWe've got function if we wanna look\nat the functions that we made.\n\n197\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.910\nWSMan that the Windows management is part\nof the wmi, we've got environment for\n\n198\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.800\nthe PowerShell environment pulling things\nlike the modules that we've got loaded and\n\n199\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.550\nother information, and\nI think that's the bulk of them.\n\n200\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.710\nSo these are the ones that\nare created automatically.\n\n201\n00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.470\nI didn't create a single one of these.\n\n202\n00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.919\nThese were all done by the system.\n\n203\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.220\nWhere the PS drives here really cool\nthough, is that you can create your own.\n\n204\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.660\nYou can actually add more to this.\n\n205\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.120\nI might want to have a drive letter\nthat doesn't point to a drive but\n\n206\n00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.320\npoints to a particular\nfolder in the drive.\n\n207\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.290\nI can do that.\n\n208\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.340\nOr a drive letter or name that points to\na particular location in the registry.\n\n209\n00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.749\nWe don't wanna necessarily have to go\nthrough and retype things over and\n\n210\n00:10:41.749 --> 00:10:43.590\nover and\nover again if we want to access them.\n\n211\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.970\nIf we can map a drive letter to it,\nit'll make life easier.\n\n212\n00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.410\nSo those are some of the cool\nthings that we can do, but\n\n213\n00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.590\nyou've got to know what\nyour system supports.\n\n214\n00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.510\nSo get-psdrive.\n\n215\n00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.290\nThat's what showed me\nthe drives that I had.\n\n216\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:02.860\nThere's another command\nwhich is get-psprovider.\n\n217\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.300\nEach one of these drives,\nsee how it has a provider column.\n\n218\n00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.970\nThat's telling me what's\nmaking that drive function.\n\n219\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.610\nIf it's a file system one, like a hard\ndrive letter, it's a file system provider.\n\n220\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.560\nThere's an alias provider,\na registry provider, and so on.\n\n221\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.760\nThese are different\nproviders that we have.\n\n222\n00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.720\nAs you install additional\nsoftware on your servers or\n\n223\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.380\non your client,\nyou might get more providers.\n\n224\n00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.580\nYou might get some other ones that\njust aren't part of the base install.\n\n225\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.410\nSo you can run Get-PSProvider and\nsee if there's any other ones.\n\n226\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.700\nI don't think I have anybody\nthat didn't show up there.\n\n227\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.200\nYeah, they're all normal.\n\n228\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.940\nI've seen some that are out there\nwritten by other companies that\n\n229\n00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.500\nthat had some really cool stuff like\nthe ability to connect F.T.P. servers.\n\n230\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.990\nSo you can have a driver\nthat maps right to an F.T.P.\n\n231\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.760\nserver you can browse right into it.\n\n232\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.220\nI've seen the same thing with the secure\nF.T.P. like over an SH tunnel.\n\n233\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.260\nYou can do all that stuff,\nif you get the edition right,\n\n234\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.110\nif you get the provider for it.\n\n235\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.290\nBut these are the providers\nthat are included alias,\n\n236\n00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:04.640\nenvironment file system and so, so any of\nthose items we can map to a drive name.\n\n237\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.490\nAnd you know normally I say\na drive letter but here's a name.\n\n238\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.020\nNoticed when I went to like H.K. see you.\n\n239\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.630\nI went to H.K. see you colon.\n\n240\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.690\nSo it's not just a letter,\nit's whatever we want it to be.\n\n241\n00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.790\nWe're just used to seeing the letters.\n\n242\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.600\nBecause 30 years ago they decided\nthat's what we were going to use.\n\n243\n00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.360\nAnd if you wanna do that, you can do it.\n\n244\n00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.080\nYou can map X: to a particular\nlocation in the registry.\n\n245\n00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.931\nIt'll work.\n\n246\n00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:28.650\nBut, we'll oftentimes do a name.\n\n247\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.740\nSo for example, I like to map some\nthings that makes it easier for\n\n248\n00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.420\nme to get my documents.\n\n249\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.040\nSo if I have a bunch a PowerShell scripts,\nI probably store those somewhere.\n\n250\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.662\nLike in My Documents folder or\nwhatever, right?\n\n251\n00:12:39.662 --> 00:12:46.482\nSo if I change to my C drive and\nI'll get into.\n\n252\n00:12:46.482 --> 00:12:47.950\nOops.\n\n253\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.720\nUser \\Don Pezet\\Documents.\n\n254\n00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.890\nAnd I'm gonna make a directory\ncalled scripts, all right?\n\n255\n00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.898\nSo, maybe that's where I keep all of my\nscripts right there in the scripts folder.\n\n256\n00:13:00.898 --> 00:13:04.500\nAnd I wanna be able to get to that easy\nI don't wanna have to change in here.\n\n257\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.870\nRemember that when we run a script,\n\n258\n00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.850\na PowerShell script we've\nalways got to provide the path.\n\n259\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:13.060\nWe have to say like ./profile/ps1,\nif I'm gonna run that script, or\n\n260\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:17.310\nif I'm in another folder, I might have\nto type the whole path to get to it.\n\n261\n00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.230\nAnd I might not wanna do that,\nit's kind of a pain.\n\n262\n00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.030\nAnd you'll see here because mine has\nspaces in it it has to do the ampersand at\n\n263\n00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.140\nthe beginning.\n\n264\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:31.390\nAnd all that just if I want\nto run this little script.\n\n265\n00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.620\nSo that's what I have to type and\nthat's a lot.\n\n266\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.720\nAnd I think I've said it in other segments\nI'm a lazy typer, so I hate to do that, so\n\n267\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.480\nif I've got that script,\nand I wanna run it easily.\n\n268\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.020\nI might wanna make some\nkind of an alias for that.\n\n269\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.870\nSo I'm to drop the script right in there.\n\n270\n00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.370\nThere we go.\n\n271\n00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.160\nIt's not actually got it.\n\n272\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.972\nAll right so\nI'm going to create my own P.S. drive and\n\n273\n00:13:53.972 --> 00:13:59.105\nyou can do that with the new dash P.S.\ndrive command one.\n\n274\n00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:01.159\nAll right, so you can create a P.S.\n\n275\n00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:05.290\ndrive and all you have to do is tell\nit the provider that you're gonna use.\n\n276\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.040\nThe name you want the drive to have,\nand where it should point to, and\n\n277\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.400\nwhere it points to is gonna\nvary based on the provider.\n\n278\n00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.020\nIf you pick the registry provider\nyou'll point it to a registry key,\n\n279\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.890\na folder inside your registry.\n\n280\n00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.810\nIf you pick the file system\none like I'm about to do,\n\n281\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.750\nthen it'll point to\na folder on the hard drive.\n\n282\n00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.370\nIf you pick the certificate store,\nyou'll point to a particular place there.\n\n283\n00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.180\nBut it's all about creating a kind of like\nan alias, that makes life easy for you.\n\n284\n00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:33.196\nAll right so I'm gonna do that\nI'm gonna do one called -name,\n\n285\n00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:36.501\noops, I'll say -name scripts.\n\n286\n00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.400\nSo I'm gonna create one\nthat I call scripts, or\n\n287\n00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.370\nI might want to call it psscripts or\nsomething just so I can.\n\n288\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.610\nRemember that these are my\nPowerShell scripts, but,\n\n289\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.040\nwhatever I want that name to be.\n\n290\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.110\nAnd then,\nI need to specify where it's gonna go.\n\n291\n00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.340\nIn fact, I'll stick with just calling it\nscripts, I don't want it to be too long.\n\n292\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:54.010\nAll right.\n\n293\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.841\nSo the next thing I wanna\nsay is what the provider is.\n\n294\n00:14:55.841 --> 00:15:00.971\nSo, I'll say PS provider, and my provider\nis gonna be the file system provider.\n\n295\n00:15:00.971 --> 00:15:03.000\nAnd I'm just getting that right\nhere from this list up here.\n\n296\n00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.820\nFile system is the one that points to\nfile systems so that's what I'm typing.\n\n297\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.760\nThen you have to specify the root.\n\n298\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.810\nWhere does the things start?\n\n299\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.320\nAnd, let me move this so\nit's not covered by my head.\n\n300\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.115\nThere we go.\nSo we have to say where it points to, and\n\n301\n00:15:18.115 --> 00:15:19.290\nso you say dash root.\n\n302\n00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.333\nWhat is the root of this new drive.\n\n303\n00:15:21.333 --> 00:15:23.420\nAnd then we give it that path.\n\n304\n00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:31.700\nAnd the path for\nme is C:\\users\\DonPezet\\documents\\scripts.\n\n305\n00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.060\nThere we go.\n\n306\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.691\nAnd that's gonna be my\nmapping right there.\n\n307\n00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:37.463\nAll right?\nSo I'm telling it where I want it point\n\n308\n00:15:37.463 --> 00:15:42.250\nto, what provider I want it to use, and\nwhat name the driver is going to have.\n\n309\n00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.427\nAnd when I run that,\nnow I've got a new drive.\n\n310\n00:15:45.427 --> 00:15:51.834\nIf I do a Get-PSDrive I'll see I've\ngot a drive in here called scripts.\n\n311\n00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:54.739\nAnd if I change to it, if I go to CD.\n\n312\n00:15:54.739 --> 00:15:56.405\nWell, here let me get out of this one.\n\n313\n00:15:56.405 --> 00:15:58.235\nSo there, I'm on my C drive.\n\n314\n00:15:58.235 --> 00:16:04.524\nAnd if I do a change directory or\nset dash location to scripts colon and\n\n315\n00:16:04.524 --> 00:16:08.110\nI pull up a list, there's my profile.\n\n316\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:15.700\nSo now if I'm working on my hard drive and\nI'm in some crazy sub folder somewhere.\n\n317\n00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.040\nLike I'm working on a host file or\nsomething.\n\n318\n00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.470\nSo I'm way in here.\n\n319\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.110\nAnd I want to run that script.\n\n320\n00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:26.290\nI don't have to type the full path C:\\\nusers\\DonPezet\\documents\\ whatever,\n\n321\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:32.500\nI can just type Scripts:/profile.ps.one.\n\n322\n00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.580\nRight?\nScripts colon that would be like\n\n323\n00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.100\nsaying C colon backslash.\n\n324\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.000\nRight so the root of that drive profile\nps one that's what I want to run.\n\n325\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.880\nAnd it'll run and apparently I'm going\nto trip the [LAUGH] whoops, well shoot.\n\n326\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.700\nI tripped my little security policy\nthere by running that script\n\n327\n00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.210\nfrom a non-trusted location.\n\n328\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.780\nBut you saw that it worked, right, that it\njumped over to that script location and\n\n329\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.380\nit ran that file.\n\n330\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.620\nThat's what these are about.\n\n331\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.230\nYou certainly don't have to use PS drives.\n\n332\n00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.830\nThey're a convenience factor.\n\n333\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.586\nThey're something that you can create\nthat makes it easy to be able to access\n\n334\n00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:08.754\nresources without having to\ngo through crazy navigation.\n\n335\n00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:12.836\nOn the file system that's definitely\ntrue but on things like the registry,\n\n336\n00:17:12.836 --> 00:17:17.106\nit makes working with the registry a lot\neasier, because you used to have to do it\n\n337\n00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:20.707\nthrough CIM calls and those things\nare really difficult to write.\n\n338\n00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.180\nNow we can do it right\nthrough the PS drive.\n\n339\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.920\nNow I do want to point one thing out here,\n\n340\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.690\nwhich is if I do a get dash PS drive,\nwhoops, or break point.\n\n341\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.010\n[LAUGH]\nIf I do a get dash PS drive,\n\n342\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.970\nnotice that my drive is gone right.\n\n343\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.980\nIt didn't survive me reloading my session.\n\n344\n00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.060\nIf you create your own PS drives they do\ngo away when you close your PowerShell\n\n345\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.970\nsession.\n\n346\n00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.510\nSo if this is something\nyou're going to use a lot,\n\n347\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.570\nyou need to put it in your profile, right.\n\n348\n00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.070\nHave it as part of your profile that\nruns when you launch the PowerShell so\n\n349\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.200\nit's recreated every time, right.\n\n350\n00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.270\nAnd if you don't know how to\nwork with those profiles,\n\n351\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.720\nwe've already filmed a segment on that.\n\n352\n00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.160\nCheck it out.\nThey're called PowerShell profiles, and\n\n353\n00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.790\nit's how to create things that stick\nwith you between sessions, all right.\n\n354\n00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.020\nOne thing to remember though\nis that in that segment,\n\n355\n00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.240\nmost of the time we work with\nour own personal profiles.\n\n356\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.420\nBut if you want to create\na mapping like this and\n\n357\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.930\nyou're going to use it in your scripts.\n\n358\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.950\nIf somebody else tries to run that script,\nthey don't have those mappings,\n\n359\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.170\nit's not going to work.\n\n360\n00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.300\nSo you might want to put these\nmappings in your global profiles.\n\n361\n00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.273\nThe ones that apply to users and\nshells, right?\n\n362\n00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.256\nThe default profiles.\n\n363\n00:18:28.256 --> 00:18:33.079\nThe ones found in\nc:/windows/system32/powershell.\n\n364\n00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.920\nThe ones that are buried down in there.\n\n365\n00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.920\nThose are the ones that\napply to all users, and\n\n366\n00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.470\nyou might want to consider that.\n\n367\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.200\nThe other option is not to use these.\n\n368\n00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.250\nAnd in your scripts instead just to use\nthe ones that you know are going to\n\n369\n00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.030\nbe present.\n\n370\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.660\nThat's why Microsoft\ncreates these by default.\n\n371\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.140\nRight.\nBecause everyone will have those.\n\n372\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.340\nYou can use them in your scripts and\n\n373\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.720\nyou'll be just fine,\neven if somebody else runs them.\n\n374\n00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.640\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n375\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.860\nThe other thing is if you create\na PS drive so I'll do another one.\n\n376\n00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.150\nMaybe I'll do one to\nthe registry this time right so\n\n377\n00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:06.650\nI might say new PS drive dash name.\n\n378\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:11.390\nAnd I'll call this the run.\n\n379\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:16.221\nRight, so these would be things that run\nwhen my system starts up or when logon or\n\n380\n00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:16.950\nwhatever.\n\n381\n00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.310\nSo I'm gonna map somewhere\ninto the registry.\n\n382\n00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.540\nAnd I'll set my provider as registry.\n\n383\n00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:27.021\nAnd then I need to specify the route and\nfor the route I just need tell\n\n384\n00:19:27.021 --> 00:19:30.588\nit where I'm gonna to be mapping to and\nso I might map to.\n\n385\n00:19:30.588 --> 00:19:41.545\nHKCU:/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/Current\n\n386\n00:19:41.545 --> 00:19:44.954\nVersion/run.\n\n387\n00:19:48.775 --> 00:19:52.737\nAll right, so I'm creating that mapping,\nwhat did I do here?\n\n388\n00:19:52.737 --> 00:19:55.183\nA perimeter cannot be found\nthat matches provider.\n\n389\n00:19:55.183 --> 00:19:57.018\nShoot.\nIs it PS provider?\n\n390\n00:19:57.018 --> 00:19:58.550\nOh, it is PS provider.\n\n391\n00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.810\nThere's a little typo on my part there.\n\n392\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.690\nLet me change that from dash\nprovider to dash PS provider.\n\n393\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:03.780\nThere we go.\n\n394\n00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.850\nAll right so\nnow I've got this new PS drive.\n\n395\n00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.537\nAnd so there it is.\n\n396\n00:20:10.537 --> 00:20:13.958\nI can see I've created this\none that's called run.\n\n397\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:17.290\nAnd if I were to change into it would take\nme right into that eight key current user\n\n398\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.630\nand into that key to be\nable to browse to it.\n\n399\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:25.970\nIf I want to get rid of it, I can use\nthe remove dash PS drive command line.\n\n400\n00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.410\nOne little word of advice though.\n\n401\n00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:32.120\nIt doesn't work if you\nare in the drive yourself.\n\n402\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:38.950\nSo if I'm in that PS drive and I'm working\naround in here doing whatever direction.\n\n403\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.270\nI'm already all the way in aren't I?\n\n404\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.940\nYup.\n\n405\n00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.790\nSo if I'm in there and I'm working and\nI try and do a remove dash PS drive.\n\n406\n00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:52.030\nAnd I specify that name in the name\nof mine is just run, right.\n\n407\n00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.900\nIt's going to get an error because\nit says it's in use, right, so\n\n408\n00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.480\nyou've got to get out of the drive first.\n\n409\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.820\nAnd you can just move to another drive or\nwhatever and\n\n410\n00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.390\nthen you'll be able to remove it and\nit's gone right.\n\n411\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:04.423\nSo if you're just using it temporarily,\nlike you have a script and\n\n412\n00:21:04.423 --> 00:21:06.818\nat the beginning of the script\nit creates a mapping.\n\n413\n00:21:06.818 --> 00:21:09.853\nAnd then at the end of the script\nyou want to remove it again,\n\n414\n00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.629\nyou just use remove dash PS drive.\n\n415\n00:21:11.629 --> 00:21:12.960\nIt's pretty cool functionality.\n\n416\n00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.490\nIt's one that a lot of people\ndon't even know is there.\n\n417\n00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.940\nBecause when we look at this prompt,\nwe immediately think file system.\n\n418\n00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.490\nAnd we expect things to\nwork like a file system.\n\n419\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.770\nBut over time you start to learn that hey,\n\n420\n00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.110\nI'm not really looking\nat the file system here.\n\n421\n00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.370\nIt's making it look like that,\nit's making it look pretty but in reality.\n\n422\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.310\nI'm looking at just output of\nvariables coming from PowerShell.\n\n423\n00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.810\nAnd so these things, these drive letters,\n\n424\n00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.440\nthey can represent\nwhatever I want them to.\n\n425\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.660\nAnd that's what PS Drives are all about.\n\n426\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.080\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n427\n00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.340\nin this segment we got a chance to take\na look at what PowerShell drives were.\n\n428\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.530\nWe saw the default ones\nthat were already there.\n\n429\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.600\nWe got a chance to see how to create them.\n\n430\n00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.140\nWork with them.\n\n431\n00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.930\nAnd ultimately remove them.\n\n432\n00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.671\nAnd just another thing to remember as I\nmentioned we might want to add those to\n\n433\n00:21:55.671 --> 00:21:59.179\nour profile so they'll be launched\nin created every time that we launch\n\n434\n00:21:59.179 --> 00:22:01.417\na PowerShell and they're available for us.\n\n435\n00:22:01.417 --> 00:22:02.949\nIt's a really cool technology.\n\n436\n00:22:02.949 --> 00:22:06.195\nSomething you can take advantage of to\nmake your life a little bit easier.\n\n437\n00:22:06.195 --> 00:22:08.062\nAll right well I hope you\nguys enjoyed the segment.\n\n438\n00:22:08.062 --> 00:22:15.215\nStay tuned we've got more\nPowerShell coming up.\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:08,236\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:12,268\nIn this segment, we're gonna take a look\nat how to add and remove Windows roles and\n\n3\n00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:14,640\nfeatures via the Powershell.\n\n4\n00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,720\nNow this is a pretty easy function.\n\n5\n00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,530\nI know a lot of you guys probably use the\nserver manager and go right in there and\n\n6\n00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,140\nadd whatever roles you want.\n\n7\n00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,740\nBut if you're trying to deploy large\nquantities of servers one of the easiest\n\n8\n00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,260\nthings to automate is having the basic\nroles and features installed.\n\n9\n00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,590\nWe can write a PowerShell Script\nthat not only deploys various roles\n\n10\n00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,190\nbut then goes on.\n\n11\n00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,060\nOn to configure them, and\nget them set the way we want.\n\n12\n00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,440\nSo whenever we deploy a new server, we\ncan just throw a windows server image on\n\n13\n00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,060\nthere, and then run a powershell\nscript and now we've got a DNS server.\n\n14\n00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,440\nOr run a powershell scrip and\nnow we've got an FTP server.\n\n15\n00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,500\nRun a powershell script and\nnow we've got our web server, right.\n\n16\n00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,670\nReally quick, really easy to set up and\nspawn; but the first step of that\n\n17\n00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,680\nis getting the right roles and\nfeatures in place, alright.\n\n18\n00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,410\nNow, the process I managed to get with\nthe Powershell is actually pretty easy.\n\n19\n00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,910\nThere's only a handful of commands\nthat we need to remember.\n\n20\n00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,520\nand the output of those\ncommands is pretty informative,\n\n21\n00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,650\nso this is one of the simpler\ntasks that we have to deal with.\n\n22\n00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,780\nBut, there's a lot of terminology in\nit that can be difficult to remember,\n\n23\n00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,330\nso I always rely on some of my\nget commands to pull that up.\n\n24\n00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,520\nAnd let me show you what I mean.\n\n25\n00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,030\nThe first command I want to show you is\nthe get dash Windows feature command.\n\n26\n00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,300\nNow I know we're talking\nabout roles in features, but\n\n27\n00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,330\nin the power shell it doesn't\ndiscriminate between the two.\n\n28\n00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,650\nIt treats roles and features the same way.\n\n29\n00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,320\nIn fact, all throughout Windows\nthey're treated the same way,\n\n30\n00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,610\nthe only difference is in the GUI\nthat we see in the server manager.\n\n31\n00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,170\nMicrosoft does that as a favor to us to\nsay if it's a role, that's a big deal.\n\n32\n00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,920\nThat's something that needs\nadditional configuration.\n\n33\n00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,950\nIf it's a feature, that's a minor thing.\n\n34\n00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,720\nProbably doesn't need\nconfiguration at all.\n\n35\n00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,035\nSo that's simply a separation they\nmake in the GUI, not on the back end.\n\n36\n00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:54,245\nSo, on the back end we'll never\nreally see that word role.\n\n37\n00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,705\nWe're always gonna see feature.\n\n38\n00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:58,995\nSo, pretty much everything is\ntreated as a feature back here and\n\n39\n00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:02,155\nif I do get dash Windows feature,\n\n40\n00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:06,870\nit's going to give me a list of all of the\nfeatures that are available to Windows.\n\n41\n00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,190\nAnd it lays them out in a nice\nlittle hierarchical view and\n\n42\n00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,420\nyou'll see how some of these have\nlittle xs to the left of them, right?\n\n43\n00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,720\nAnd that x is letting me know\nthat that one is installed and\n\n44\n00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,820\nthen after that some of them\nhave empty boxes to the left and\n\n45\n00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,870\nthat's letting me know that\nthey are not installed, right?\n\n46\n00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,850\nThere's really three different\nstatuses that we'll see here.\n\n47\n00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,530\nThere's installed so we've already got it.\n\n48\n00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,900\nThere's available which means\nit's on our hard drive but\n\n49\n00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,350\nit's in the protected storage.\n\n50\n00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,270\nWe haven't actually moved it out for use.\n\n51\n00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,580\nSo you can't use it yet but\nit is available if you want it.\n\n52\n00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,800\nThe third one is remove.\n\n53\n00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,470\nYou wont really see remove by default.\n\n54\n00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,980\nWhen you deploy a server all of\nthe installation files from Windows Server\n\n55\n00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,050\n2012 are copied along with it.\n\n56\n00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,780\nAnd you may not want that,\nyou may not want to have these\n\n57\n00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,600\nextra files sitting there because it\ncan increase your attack surface.\n\n58\n00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,170\nSo in high security environments,\nthey'll remove the installation files.\n\n59\n00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,620\nAnd if that happens, you'll see\nthe feature or roll listed here and\n\n60\n00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,588\nover here on it's status it will say,\nremoved.\n\n61\n00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:13,990\nAnd that let;s you know that it's not\ninstalled and if you ant to install it,\n\n62\n00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,670\nyou're gonna need to bring\nalong a Windows Media disc or\n\n63\n00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,915\nhave a network chair somewhere that has\nthe Windows installation files on it.\n\n64\n00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:23,840\n'Cause otherwise, we're not gonna\nbe able to get to it, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,380\nSo those are the three statuses\nthat we'll see as long.\n\n66\n00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,830\nAs it's listed as available,\nwe can install it and\n\n67\n00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,950\nwe won't have to provide any media.\n\n68\n00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,940\nNow, this view does get\na little bit cluttered.\n\n69\n00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,140\nSo, one nice thing that we can do\nis we can filter it a good bit.\n\n70\n00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,390\nAnd the filtering,\nMicrosoft's actually anticipated this, so\n\n71\n00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,910\nthey created some shortcuts.\n\n72\n00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,890\nThe long way to filter this would\nbe to do like a crazy query.\n\n73\n00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,790\nBut if I just wanted to see what was\ninstalled, for example, the long form of\n\n74\n00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,460\nit would be to do Get-windowsFeature and\n\n75\n00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,820\nthen pipe that output into\na filter like where object.\n\n76\n00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:08,960\nSo I'll do where-object $_ and\nI'm gonna query the install state.\n\n77\n00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:15,550\nAnd I'm looking for where that install\nstate is listed as Installed, right?\n\n78\n00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,620\nSo there's my filter\njust showing me those.\n\n79\n00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,240\nWell now it's gonna give me a list and\nI'll see all the installed ones, right?\n\n80\n00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,230\nBut Microsoft knows that this is\na pretty common query and so they\n\n81\n00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,700\nactually made that kind of a default of\npart of the syntax in get WindowsFeature.\n\n82\n00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,930\nYou can just run get-WindowsFeature,\nwell if you can spell it.\n\n83\n00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,260\nThere, get-windowsFeature, and then you\ncan pipe that and say where install.\n\n84\n00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,920\nThe install status, that one's actually\nthe primary value for this table.\n\n85\n00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,610\nSo when we just say where install,\nit'll automatically do that and\n\n86\n00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,950\nbring it right up, and we can do that for\nthe other statuses too.\n\n87\n00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,420\nYou can say like where available and\nit'll bring those up and it'll show\n\n88\n00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,520\nthe ones that are available for install\nwhich apparently it didn't pull for me.\n\n89\n00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,650\nAll right,\nwell [LAUGH] one I actually do a little\n\n90\n00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,470\nmore often is I'll do -ne,\nso not equal to installed.\n\n91\n00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,600\nIn other words, show me all\nthe ones that aren't installed,\n\n92\n00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,340\nwhich apparently it didn't like that\none either, what have I done here?\n\n93\n00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,820\nOh, with that one because\nI'm doing a modifier,\n\n94\n00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,040\nI actually have to specify install\nstate as what I'm querying.\n\n95\n00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,800\nSo, where the install state\nis not equal to install then,\n\n96\n00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,820\nI'll bet that's why my available\nquery didn't work a minute ago, too.\n\n97\n00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,440\nSo, when you run these,\nthe aliases are nice,\n\n98\n00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,090\nthey make life a little bit more simple\nbut you have to remember what they are.\n\n99\n00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,470\nSo, that's the challenge there.\n\n100\n00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,670\nAll right,\nI went through those kind of quickly.\n\n101\n00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,590\nLet me just recap the commands that I did.\n\n102\n00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,140\nSo to pull the list of installed ones,\nI said get-windowsFeature, and\n\n103\n00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,430\nI typed that into where, install.\n\n104\n00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,590\nAll right, and then to get the ones that\nwere not installed I had to add a little\n\n105\n00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,400\nbit more to that and so I said where\nInstallState is not equal to Installed.\n\n106\n00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,458\nAnd that'll give me the ones that are\navailable and the ones that are removed.\n\n107\n00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,010\nSo it kinda breaks that out for\nus and we can see it.\n\n108\n00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,250\nSo those are available, more commonly\nthough, I'm not looking for all of them.\n\n109\n00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,140\nI'm looking for a particular feature.\n\n110\n00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,530\nI might be just interested\nin one particular thing.\n\n111\n00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,200\nSo I might do something\nlike get-windowsfeature and\n\n112\n00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,710\nthen specify a particular\nfeature like DHCP and\n\n113\n00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,290\nnow it's gonna bring back\nthat DHCP server, right.\n\n114\n00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,080\nSo there it is, that's the one and\nyou can actually do some wild-carding\n\n115\n00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080\nin here to pull up other ones,\ncuz there might be more than one.\n\n116\n00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,210\nFor example there's the DHCP server,\nand then there's the DHCP tools for\n\n117\n00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,575\nmanaging it that are part of the RSAT,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,915\nSo when I added those\nasterisks around DHCP that\n\n119\n00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:46,615\nhelped me see all of the stuff\nthat's involved with DHCP.\n\n120\n00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,445\nThe only problem with that is it\ndoesn't really show the hierarchy.\n\n121\n00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:53,080\nSo like DHCP server tools\nhere is a part of the RSAT.\n\n122\n00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,460\nSo if I wanted to add it, I have to\nkind of work through that process.\n\n123\n00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,000\nBut you can install it or remove it just\nby using this shortcut name right here.\n\n124\n00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,650\nSo that's really all you need.\n\n125\n00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,410\nSo we don't necessarily\nneed to see the hierarchy\n\n126\n00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,740\nin order to add that particular value.\n\n127\n00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,940\nAnd that leads us to the next part is if\nwe want to install it, like if I want to\n\n128\n00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,760\nbe a DHCP server I can see it's available,\nI haven't installed it, I can add it now.\n\n129\n00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,830\nLet's start with something really\nsimple like the Telnet Client.\n\n130\n00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,410\nThe Telnet Client used to be installed\nin Windows by default, so you used to be\n\n131\n00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,890\nable to type Telnet and provide a host and\nconnect to it and you'll see it's not\n\n132\n00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,210\ninstalled by default anymore because,\nwell because Telnet sucks.\n\n133\n00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,160\nBut we do still need it sometimes,\nright, so if you want to install it,\n\n134\n00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,290\nit is available.\n\n135\n00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,080\nSo if we do get-WindowsFeature and\n\n136\n00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,030\nwe search for\nanything with the word Telnet in it.\n\n137\n00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,600\nWe'll see that we've got the telnet\nclient and the telnet server,\n\n138\n00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,910\nthey're both available.\n\n139\n00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,722\nAll I really care about on\nthis screen are the names.\n\n140\n00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:52,570\nI wanna know the name so\nI can install these.\n\n141\n00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:59,740\nAnd when you go to install,\nyou just say add-windowsFeature and\n\n142\n00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,680\nthen you specify what you want to install.\n\n143\n00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,850\nI wanna install the Telnet client, right?\n\n144\n00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,810\nSo I'll run that and\nit's gonna go and install it.\n\n145\n00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,300\nIt's available so I've already\ngot the installation files and\n\n146\n00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,850\nit's gonna bring it in and\nI don't have permissions, all right?\n\n147\n00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,600\nWell, I am an administrator\non this system.\n\n148\n00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,490\nBut I didn't run my power shell\nwith administrative privileges.\n\n149\n00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,640\nSo it's, flagging me on that.\n\n150\n00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,040\nSo I'm gonna copy that and\nI'm gonna relaunch my power shell\n\n151\n00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,900\nas an administrator this time.\n\n152\n00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,240\nAnd once that's done, now I can rerun that\ncommand and this time it'll be happy.\n\n153\n00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,400\nSo you do have to be an administrator to\nadd this stuff, in the GUI it would have\n\n154\n00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,840\njust prompted me, but here in Poweshell I\nactually have to relaunch the shell.\n\n155\n00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,750\nAnd once that's done I'll\nhave the Telnet client.\n\n156\n00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,660\nIt will be installed and\nbe available to run.\n\n157\n00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,560\nIf I'm installing a role, something like\nthe active director domain services,\n\n158\n00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,930\nthen there's usually follow\nconfigurations that I need to do.\n\n159\n00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,000\nBut in this case, it installed,\nI can see it's successful.\n\n160\n00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,870\nIt's not pending a reboot, so\n\n161\n00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,960\nthat means I'm good,\nI don't have to do anything else.\n\n162\n00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,610\nIf it says yes there, then that means I\nneed to reboot for it to take effect, and\n\n163\n00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,780\nso I could reboot.\n\n164\n00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,980\nIf you want that to be automatic,\nyou can add it to the end like this,\n\n165\n00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,130\nyou can say, -restart and\nthen after it adds it, if this is a yes,\n\n166\n00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,520\nit'll restart, if this is a no,\nthen it won't restart.\n\n167\n00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,240\nSo you can actually always\nhave restart there.\n\n168\n00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,720\nBut you might wanna schedule that\nrestart for a later time, so\n\n169\n00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,550\nthat's why it's not the default.\n\n170\n00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,170\nAll right, so I should have that client.\n\n171\n00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,140\nIf I go back to my command prompt here,\nand I try and telnet again, now I can see\n\n172\n00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,660\nthat Telnet client is actually there and\nworking, it's been installed.\n\n173\n00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,280\nNow when I automate something like this,\nlike if I'm rolling out a web server or\n\n174\n00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,600\nwhatever and I'm writing a script\nthat automates the deployment of it.\n\n175\n00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120\nI'll typically need to install\nmore than one roller feature.\n\n176\n00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,780\nAnd if you need to do that, you don't\nhave to run the command more than once.\n\n177\n00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,720\nYou can actually install more than\none feature at the same time.\n\n178\n00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,590\nSo for example, if I want to install DNS\nand WINS, I wanna install both, rIght?\n\n179\n00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,780\nWell, I can find those features like DNS,\n\n180\n00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,820\nwhich is actually just called DNS and\nWINS which is called WINS.\n\n181\n00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,610\nSo, I already know their names.\n\n182\n00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,122\nAnd if I want to add them, I can just\ndo add dash windows feature- DNA comma,\n\n183\n00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:25,170\nWINS, Telnet-dash-server- however many I\n\n184\n00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,720\nneed- I can go through and specify those,\nand it's gonna install them, all right?\n\n185\n00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,110\nNow notice up here the DNS for\nme is already installed.\n\n186\n00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,300\nI'm already a DNS server, right?\n\n187\n00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,940\nSo, what's gonna happen\nif I run this again?\n\n188\n00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,740\nNothing, so, it's just gonna say no change\nneeded, and move on to the next ones.\n\n189\n00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,570\nSo it will install the other\nones that I'm missing, and\n\n190\n00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,340\nI'll skip over the ones\nthat are already there.\n\n191\n00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,370\nSo if you've got a PowerShell script, and\n\n192\n00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,700\none of the things that you wanna\ndo is check the prerequisites.\n\n193\n00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,390\nAre these roles installed,\nand if they're not,\n\n194\n00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,100\ninstall them, you could skip the check and\nsay go ahead and add it.\n\n195\n00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,830\nCuz if it's already there,\nit just leaves it be, all right?\n\n196\n00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,150\nSo when I run this,\n\n197\n00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,050\nit's gonna install those three,\nwell they're not all roles, right?\n\n198\n00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,930\nDNS is a role, but WINS is a feature,\nand Telnet is a feature.\n\n199\n00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,000\nSo it's gonna add those in And the DNS\none, it's gonna skip right past that,\n\n200\n00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,180\nand then it's gonna do WINS and Telnet.\n\n201\n00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,800\nSo here I can see I had success and\nnotice the feature result.\n\n202\n00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,310\nJust Telnet server and WINS.\n\n203\n00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,610\nIt left out DNS because\nit didnt have to do it.\n\n204\n00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,800\nIf I had run DNS just by itself\nIf I just take those guys out and\n\n205\n00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,340\njust do DNS then here's where\nit tells me no change needed.\n\n206\n00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,220\nThat's the exit code, I got exit code\nof success here because it installed on\n\n207\n00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,650\nthe other one so\nthat's why I didn't see that.\n\n208\n00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,870\nBut that's what it did, it's installed\nthe roll, I've now got that functionality.\n\n209\n00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,480\nI've got WINS and telnet server and\n\n210\n00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,240\nall that other good stuff and I can go\nin and I can start to manage those.\n\n211\n00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,790\nHopefully, none of you guys\nhave any WIN Servers anymore.\n\n212\n00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,600\nBut if you do, then here's our tool.\n\n213\n00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,100\nWonderful.\n\n214\n00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,360\nSo pretty easy to add those roles in and\nget them in place.\n\n215\n00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,650\nNot anything too spectacular there.\n\n216\n00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,060\nI'm trying launch my wins panel, it's\nbeen so long since I've gone in there.\n\n217\n00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,610\nOh, did I not install, oh,\n\n218\n00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,550\nI had to have installed\nthe management tool for it, right?\n\n219\n00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,060\nWell, anyhow,\nwe can always do get dash command,\n\n220\n00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,340\nand look for any, actually wins is\nnot power shell enabled, is it?\n\n221\n00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,900\nNope, it sure isn't.\n\n222\n00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,160\nSo I see the WINS application is there but\n\n223\n00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,610\nthey never added any PowerShell commands\nfor it cuz it's so old and pointless.\n\n224\n00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,360\nSame thing with Telnet,\nbut yeah, they are there.\n\n225\n00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,120\nThey're available, they're working.\n\n226\n00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,880\nAnd now I can go and use them.\n\n227\n00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,370\nAll right if we wanna get rid of\na feature, if we wanna uninstall it.\n\n228\n00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,870\nWell, to add it,\nwe use the add dash Windows feature and,\n\n229\n00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,700\nto remove it, we just use remove.\n\n230\n00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,130\nAnd it's the same thing,\nwe just specify the name, so,\n\n231\n00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,090\nif I don't want wins\nanymore I can do remove.\n\n232\n00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:58,040\nAnd, actually you know, before I do that,\nlet's just verify, I'm gonna do get dash.\n\n233\n00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,740\nWindowsFeature WINS, just to verify\nthat it does show up as installed.\n\n234\n00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,500\nI can see its installed state right\nthere as showing as installed.\n\n235\n00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,730\nI know it's good.\n\n236\n00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:15,080\nAnd, now I can do Remove-WindowsFeature\nWINS, and it's gonna remove it.\n\n237\n00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,670\nAnd when it's done, it will let me know\nthat it's gone and then I can only\n\n238\n00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,920\nquery it again with Get-WindowsFeature to\nverify that it is actually gone, right?\n\n239\n00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,210\nIt's a good idea to check that stuff.\n\n240\n00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,970\nSo, we'll let that run.\n\n241\n00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,970\nShouldn't take too terribly long.\n\n242\n00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,730\nThere we go.\n\n243\n00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,645\nIt is telling me that I need\nto do a restart, right?\n\n244\n00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:32,455\nSo, it's not actually gone yet.\n\n245\n00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:38,065\nIt succeeded, but a restart is necessary\nand so if I pull up that feature,\n\n246\n00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:42,370\nthe feature status Uninstall pending,\nright?\n\n247\n00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,420\nSo I've done the uninstall,\nbut it's not complete.\n\n248\n00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,508\nIt may still be running,\nI'll need to do a reboot.\n\n249\n00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:53,260\n[COUGH] All right, so those are some of\nthe basic things that we need to do there.\n\n250\n00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,690\nNow, I do want to mention one other thing\nI've done all of this from a server and\n\n251\n00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,140\non a Windows Server machine.\n\n252\n00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,060\nWindows Server 2012 or Server 2008,\n\n253\n00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,960\nthey've got all the various\ncommandlets that I just used.\n\n254\n00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,940\nBut if you're running the Powershell on\na Windows 7 or Windows 8 workstation.\n\n255\n00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,390\nThey don't have all the server\ncommandlets by default, all right?\n\n256\n00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:20,370\nSo if you've installed the RSAT,\nthe remote server administration tools on\n\n257\n00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,450\nyour system, then you'll likely have\nall these and it'll work just fine.\n\n258\n00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,320\nBut if you haven't installed the RSAT,\nthen it might not work, so\n\n259\n00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,590\nyou might get that some of these\ncommandlets are not available.\n\n260\n00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,570\nAnd installing the RSAT\ntakes care of that.\n\n261\n00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,460\nInstalling the server manager,\nthat's the real big piece in the RSAT.\n\n262\n00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,430\nThat's what's gonna take care of that and\ngive you that functionality, all right.\n\n263\n00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,600\nBut you can always double check it.\n\n264\n00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,800\nYou might need to import the module for\nthat.\n\n265\n00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,850\nDo I have that written down?\n\n266\n00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,710\nHere, I'll just test.\n\n267\n00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,720\nI think I remember it offhand.\n\n268\n00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,490\nIf we do Import Module,\nI think it's just called ServerManager.\n\n269\n00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,500\nYeah, that's it.\n\n270\n00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,590\nSo, if you're on a workstation,\non a client machine, and\n\n271\n00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,130\nsome of those applets weren't there,\nthe Windows Feature applets.\n\n272\n00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,350\nIf they weren't there, you can run\nImport-Module ServerManager, and\n\n273\n00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,620\nthat's what's going to\nactivate those commands.\n\n274\n00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,360\nBut you've got to have\nthe Server Manager available, so\n\n275\n00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,030\nthat means you've got to have\nthe RSAT installed on your system.\n\n276\n00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,580\nSo I just wanted to throw that one out\nthere in case you bump into some of these\n\n277\n00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,640\ncommands not working for you.\n\n278\n00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,840\nNormally when I do stuff like this, I'm\nautomating something on a server, and so\n\n279\n00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,430\nI know those command words are already\nthere, I don't have to add them.\n\n280\n00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,610\nAll right, so that's basically it,\nI don't have too much more to say on it.\n\n281\n00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,800\nJust remember that get dash Windows\nFeature is a really handy command because\n\n282\n00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,540\nif you're anything like me, you can't\nremember the names of half of these\n\n283\n00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,660\nthings, and Microsoft is very specific\nabout the name you want to use.\n\n284\n00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,590\nSo, in the output for\nGet -WindowsFeature, you're looking for\n\n285\n00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,970\nthis column right here in the middle,\nthis column that's the name Because that's\n\n286\n00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,280\nthe one that's gonna help you find what\nyou should be typing into your command.\n\n287\n00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,230\nAnd sometimes the names\nare very different.\n\n288\n00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,050\nThat's where it gets really challenging.\n\n289\n00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,870\nWhen you look at something like this guy\nright here, Identity Federation Support.\n\n290\n00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,720\nBut then it's actually called\nADRMS-Identity, right?\n\n291\n00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,940\nSo how do we know what that name is?\n\n292\n00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,030\nAnd normally they're at least close.\n\n293\n00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,560\nBut some of them aren't, some of them\nare really a good bit different, so So you\n\n294\n00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,280\nbasically just have to go in here, find\nthat value and bring it in from there.\n\n295\n00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,760\nAll right, so that's about it for\nroles and features.\n\n296\n00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,800\nIn this segment, we got a chance to see\nhow to add Windows roles and features.\n\n297\n00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,290\nWe saw how to query their status and\n\n298\n00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,160\nthen ultimately remove them if we were\ndone, pretty straightforward process.\n\n299\n00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,200\nNothing too challenging there.\n\n300\n00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,950\nAll right I hope you guys\nenjoyed this segment.\n\n301\n00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,982\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more Powershell coming up.\n\n302\n00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:44,829\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:13,170\nvolumes with the PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,404\nNow, for most of us, when we go to manage\nour hard drives inside of Windows Server,\n\n5\n00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:20,330\nor Windows desktop, Windows 7, Windows 8.\n\n6\n00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,350\nWe typically use the computer\nmanagement tool,\n\n7\n00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,530\nto go under the disc management tool.\n\n8\n00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,450\nWe've got a nice little\nGUI to manage everything.\n\n9\n00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,250\nIf we want to automate, or script thing.\n\n10\n00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,220\nWe have a command line you\ngo to called disc part.\n\n11\n00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,790\nAnd those are perfectly adequate tools\nthat do everything that we need.\n\n12\n00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,760\nBut Powershell has the full capabilities\nof managing our disks and volumes also.\n\n13\n00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,450\nSo, there's a lot that we can do\nright from inside of the Powershell.\n\n14\n00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,310\nThat doesn't require the use\nof those external tools.\n\n15\n00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,300\nAnd that's very handy.\n\n16\n00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,230\nBecause you might be automating\nthe deployment of a server.\n\n17\n00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,980\nWhere storage is provided on a SAN, and\nthe server is going to see that storage.\n\n18\n00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,650\nAnd it just needs to provision it out.\n\n19\n00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,640\nCreate a partition, format it, give it\na drive letter, and make it available.\n\n20\n00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,110\nSo that's what we're going to\nlook at here in this segment.\n\n21\n00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,970\nHow we manage those disc volumes.\n\n22\n00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,860\nFrom inside of the Powershell.\n\n23\n00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,360\nSo let's start by diving\ninto our Powershell.\n\n24\n00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,430\nAnd covering just some few basic\ncommands that we need to be aware of.\n\n25\n00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,250\nAnd you know what?\n\n26\n00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,490\nI've made my prompt really tiny here.\n\n27\n00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,560\nSo let me.\n\n28\n00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,860\nLet me bump that up really quick.\n\n29\n00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,020\nSo it's something we can actually read.\n\n30\n00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,940\nAs opposed to the microscopic\nthing that I've got on the screen.\n\n31\n00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,900\nAnd what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna dive in here and\n\n32\n00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,550\njust kinda mess around with some things.\n\n33\n00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,760\nThe first command that I wanna\ndo is simply querying what\n\n34\n00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,820\ndisks are on my system.\n\n35\n00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,300\nSo I can do a Get-Disk, and\n\n36\n00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,590\nthat will give me a list of\nthe disks that are in my system.\n\n37\n00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,790\nNow if you get an error like I did.\n\n38\n00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,230\nIt usually means that you launched\nthe PowerShell not as an administrator.\n\n39\n00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,180\nSo I just launched it as a regular user,\nand I'm getting permission denied.\n\n40\n00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,670\nSo I'm going to relaunch that PowerShell\nas an administrator this time.\n\n41\n00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,880\nAnd we'll do Get-Disk a second time,\nand hopefully have some better results.\n\n42\n00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,965\nNow that little query that\nit runs in the background.\n\n43\n00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,135\nIt is querying the virtual disc service,\n\n44\n00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:12,965\nand it can take it a moment to render\nthat and display it on screen.\n\n45\n00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:16,035\nBut mine jumped up here, and\nit's showing me that I've got two discs.\n\n46\n00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,055\nNow I'm running this on top of VMWare.\n\n47\n00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,030\nSo it's showing them as VMWare discs.\n\n48\n00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,750\nIn real life land, you'll usually see\nthat Seagate, or Western Digital, or\n\n49\n00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,860\nwhatever other name you've\nassociated with it.\n\n50\n00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,100\nUnless it's on a SAN,\nin which case you might see a one ID or\n\n51\n00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,000\nsomething of that nature.\n\n52\n00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,620\nSo you could see any number of\nthings under friendly name.\n\n53\n00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,540\nBut the important parts\nthat we worry about,\n\n54\n00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,370\nare things like the number over here.\n\n55\n00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,110\nWhich we'll need to know if\nwe're gonna modify these.\n\n56\n00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,910\nThe operational status,\nwhether it's online or offline,\n\n57\n00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,060\nand then lastly the size and formatting.\n\n58\n00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,610\nSo this first disc that it found\nis 60GB in size and it's MBR.\n\n59\n00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,310\nIt's using the master boot\nrecordm as opposed to like GPT.\n\n60\n00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,700\nThey're the new partitioning\ntable format in Windows.\n\n61\n00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,450\nThe bottom window says RAW.\n\n62\n00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,900\nAnd RAW is what we'll see when we\nhave a disk that has no format.\n\n63\n00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,440\nThis is a brand new disk\nit has no partitions on it.\n\n64\n00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,760\nIt's actually unusable the way that it is.\n\n65\n00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,290\nIn fact if I launch explorer,\nwhat I expect to see is a C drive, there.\n\n66\n00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,050\nAnd I don't see any other drives.\n\n67\n00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,943\nAnd that's because this one has\nno format on it, t's just RAW.\n\n68\n00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:26,880\nNow, Get-Disk will list your physical\ndisks, and your virtual disks.\n\n69\n00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,870\nRemember in Windows server 2012,\nand Windows 7, Windows 8.\n\n70\n00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,440\nYou can create virtual hard disks.\n\n71\n00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,230\nAnd you can mount those, and\nthey show up like regular disks.\n\n72\n00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,150\nGet dash disk will show those.\n\n73\n00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,600\nIf you have CD drives that are mounted,\nif you have a CD in there,\n\n74\n00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,830\nit can show those, too.\n\n75\n00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,820\nSo you do get a little bit\nof a mixture of things.\n\n76\n00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,180\nAnd as a result Microsoft decided to\noffer a couple of extra commands,\n\n77\n00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,720\nlike Get-PhysicalDisk.\n\n78\n00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,870\nWhen I add that,\nnow it's just gonna look for\n\n79\n00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,500\nthe ones that are actual\nphysical disks on the system.\n\n80\n00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,300\nAnd exclude other things like VHDs,\nthe virtual hard drives.\n\n81\n00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,690\nIf I change that to Get-VirtualDisk.\n\n82\n00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,130\nWell, now it's gonna\nshow the virtual disks.\n\n83\n00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,180\nI don't have any.\n\n84\n00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,200\nSo we've got a few variations.\n\n85\n00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,040\nNow I don't normally use these two\ncommands, I'm showing them here just for\n\n86\n00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,030\ncompleteness.\n\n87\n00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,530\nBut most of the systems that I work on,\nand most of the systems, in general,\n\n88\n00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,010\ndon't have a ton of hard drives.\n\n89\n00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,770\nSo Get-Disk isn't gonna give you\nan overwhelming amount of data.\n\n90\n00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,110\nUnless you happen to have a ton of\ndrives attached for some reason.\n\n91\n00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,820\nAnd that's where we can\nstart to filter it down.\n\n92\n00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,990\nBut get-disk,\nthat's just how we see what's there.\n\n93\n00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,840\nWe're looking for\nthe discs that are on our system.\n\n94\n00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,440\nWhen you format a disc, when you erase it,\nlayout a partition, format it and\n\n95\n00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,530\ngive it a letter.\n\n96\n00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,900\nThat changes things.\n\n97\n00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,260\nYou've got the physical disk.\n\n98\n00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,150\nBut now you've got a volume that\nyou've created on top of it.\n\n99\n00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,260\nAnd if you wanna see those,\nthat's a little different.\n\n100\n00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,580\nUp here it's just telling me this drive\nexists, and that's the size of it.\n\n101\n00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,570\nBut that drive could be divided\ninto two or three partitions.\n\n102\n00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,280\nI wouldn't see that with Get-Disk,\nit doesn't show that.\n\n103\n00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,080\nRight.\n\n104\n00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,990\nBut if I take a look at the volumes,\nI will.\n\n105\n00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,460\nAnd we've got the get-volume command.\n\n106\n00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,280\nAnd when I run that, that's gonna show me\nthe actual volumes that are in my system.\n\n107\n00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,340\nAnd if you look at\nthe ones that come back.\n\n108\n00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,930\nWell I'll see a few\ndifferent things in here.\n\n109\n00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,930\nI've got my C drive,\nmy A drive, my D drive.\n\n110\n00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,950\nMy A and D.\n\n111\n00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,610\nA is a virtual floppy disk and\nD is a CD ROM drive.\n\n112\n00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,980\nNeither one is mounted.\n\n113\n00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,380\nSo that there is nothing in them.\n\n114\n00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,260\nSo they are basically empty\nthey have no file system.\n\n115\n00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,020\nIt says they are healthy.\n\n116\n00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,830\nBut they are not actually doing anything.\n\n117\n00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,490\nBut here I can see a fix drive.\n\n118\n00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,100\nDrive C.\n\n119\n00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,290\nThat's formatted NTFS.\n\n120\n00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,370\nIt's 40 gigs used, 60 gigs total.\n\n121\n00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,060\nThat's my actual volume.\n\n122\n00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,570\nIf my physical disc was divided into more\nthan one partition, I'd see it here.\n\n123\n00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,480\nI'd see each of those discs listed.\n\n124\n00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,540\nThat we're building up the individual\npartitions on the disk.\n\n125\n00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,200\nAll right.\n\n126\n00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,130\nBut in my case I just see the C drive.\n\n127\n00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,610\nNow, it doesn't alphabetize these.\n\n128\n00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,630\nIt actually lays them out\nkind of in a weird order.\n\n129\n00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,870\nSo one of the things I like to do,\nis add a little extra to that.\n\n130\n00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,200\nAnd say sort object, driver letter.\n\n131\n00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,760\nAnd that way it sorts it and\nthrows it back by drive letter.\n\n132\n00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,530\nIf you've got a lot of disks\nagain that can be kind of useful\n\n133\n00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,770\nto get that organized.\n\n134\n00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,130\nBut otherwise it just kind of\nlays them out like we saw there.\n\n135\n00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,220\nAlright now volumes,\nthose really match to our partitions.\n\n136\n00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,760\nBut If you've got some dynamic discs and\nsome basic discs\n\n137\n00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,890\nthere is actually a difference\nbetween the volume and a partition.\n\n138\n00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,195\nSo when you're pulling this up,\n\n139\n00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:35,970\nGet-Volume is kind of just assuming\nthat we're following the new methods.\n\n140\n00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,929\nBut you also have Get-Partition.\n\n141\n00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,140\nAnd if I run that, see how it\nleft off that A and the D drives?\n\n142\n00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,180\nThose removable media.\n\n143\n00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,230\nIt kinda left those out and\nit left my C drive.\n\n144\n00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,080\nThe volume that was there.\n\n145\n00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,230\nSo I can see it as an actual partition.\n\n146\n00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,940\nYou don't partition a floppy disk.\n\n147\n00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,130\nYou don't partition a CD drive.\n\n148\n00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,790\nAnd so that's why those are gone.\n\n149\n00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,620\nThis view that we get right here\nis very similar to what's above.\n\n150\n00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,830\nI see the drive letter that's assigned.\n\n151\n00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,460\nI see the size over here.\n\n152\n00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,310\nI don't see how much is used.\n\n153\n00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,260\nI see the offset on the disk for\nthat partition.\n\n154\n00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,580\nSo I see some basic information that.\n\n155\n00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,370\nMaybe important to me.\n\n156\n00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,160\nYou can actually do a format-list on it,\nand you will see more.\n\n157\n00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,490\nSo it gives you additional information\non that as far as wether it is active or\n\n158\n00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,590\na boot drive, whether it is hidden and\njust additional information there.\n\n159\n00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,530\nSo the data is there,\nyou just do not see it on that screen.\n\n160\n00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,730\nNow remember that when\nwe do get dash volume,\n\n161\n00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,070\nit's going to include all sorts of media.\n\n162\n00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,750\nBut when you do Get-Partition, now we're\ntalking about actual disk partitions.\n\n163\n00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,380\nWhich you'll typically only see on\nhard drives, and on some flash media.\n\n164\n00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,730\nAll right so with all of that we're just\nlooking at what we've got right now.\n\n165\n00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,899\nWe saw Get-Disc, Get-PhysicalDisc,\nGet-VirtualDisc,\n\n166\n00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,420\nGet-Volume, and Get-Partition.\n\n167\n00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,620\nBut if we want to work with it,\nremember I've got that extra disc.\n\n168\n00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,579\nThat second one here that's\noffline it's got no data on it.\n\n169\n00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:08,250\nIf I wanna partition that, I wanna create\na partition on there, get it formatted and\n\n170\n00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,090\nget it available.\n\n171\n00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,070\nWell, we've got a series of\ncommands that can do that too.\n\n172\n00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,340\nSo the first thing that I wanna do\nis I need to bring that disk online.\n\n173\n00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,925\nWhen you hook a new blank disk up to\nyour system, if it's truly blank,\n\n174\n00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:26,146\nnothing on it, it will go offline\nwhen you hook it up to Windows.\n\n175\n00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:29,305\nIf it's been used on another computer\nsomewhere else, then if it's already\n\n176\n00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:32,820\npartitioned or whatever, sometimes the\nmanufacturers will do that at the factory.\n\n177\n00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,130\nThey'll throw a partition on there.\n\n178\n00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,120\nThen it might go online right away.\n\n179\n00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,940\nAnd if that's the case,\nyou can skip this next step.\n\n180\n00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,646\nBut if you're offline, what you\nneed to do is initialize the disk.\n\n181\n00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:46,563\nInitializing it brings it online and\ngets it ready for our format.\n\n182\n00:08:46,563 --> 00:08:52,835\nSo that's what I'm gonna run next is\nI'm gonna do the Initialize-Disk.\n\n183\n00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:54,875\nAnd if you were using the disk manager,\nright,\n\n184\n00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,695\nthe GUI, let me get into that real quick.\n\n185\n00:08:58,695 --> 00:08:59,965\nWhen you see an offline disk,\n\n186\n00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:03,685\nyou would actually have that option to\nright-click on it and choose initialize.\n\n187\n00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:06,525\nAnd so that's exactly what I'm\ndoing here from the command line.\n\n188\n00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:10,885\nSo if I were to go into disk management,\nand find that empty disk right here,\n\n189\n00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:15,430\nit's offline, and if I right-click,\nI can bring it online.\n\n190\n00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,540\nAnd then I'll get a little prompt\nthat's gonna ask me to initialize it.\n\n191\n00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,840\nSo that's the same process in the GUI that\nI'm seeing down here in the PowerShell.\n\n192\n00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,180\nAll right.\n\n193\n00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,490\nSo I'm gonna say Initialize-Disk, and\n\n194\n00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,880\nthen I have to tell it the disk\nthat I'm gonna be working with.\n\n195\n00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,770\nAnd we do that by specifying the number.\n\n196\n00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,500\nRemember I mentioned that number\nover here is kind of important.\n\n197\n00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,970\nI don't want to initialize disk number 0,\n\n198\n00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,970\nbecause that's where my operating system\nis, [LAUGH] it'll just give you an error,\n\n199\n00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,720\nbut I'm gonna go ahead and do number 1,\nand that's gonna initialize it.\n\n200\n00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,590\nNow, the disk is not offline anymore.\n\n201\n00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,870\nNow it's online.\n\n202\n00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,175\nIf I do a Get-Disk again,\nit shows as Online and\n\n203\n00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:58,400\nit set it up for GPT instead of MBR.\n\n204\n00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,040\nMBR are the old master boot record, that's\nthe old way of partitioning out a disk.\n\n205\n00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,670\nGPT is the new way.\n\n206\n00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,360\nIt supports larger partitions,\nmore partitions, so\n\n207\n00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,970\nit gives us a lot more flexibility.\n\n208\n00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,920\nThat's generally what you want unless\nyou're gonna be taking this disk\n\n209\n00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,810\noff of your Windows machine and hooking\nit up to a Linux or a Mac or whatever.\n\n210\n00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,020\nIn that scenario, you might wanna go MBR.\n\n211\n00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,340\nI could have done that.\n\n212\n00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,220\nIf you do Get-Help Initialize-Disk,\nit's actually an option in there.\n\n213\n00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,330\nOh, shoot.\n\n214\n00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,830\nI don't have my help documentation\nloaded on this one, so\n\n215\n00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,090\nit's just gonna give me the syntax.\n\n216\n00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,980\nBut you do have an option in here,\nright here.\n\n217\n00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,563\nFor the partition style,\nyou can specify MBR.\n\n218\n00:10:37,563 --> 00:10:40,440\nAnd when you do that, that's what's\ngonna set it and make it an MBR.\n\n219\n00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,630\nAll right, so now that my disk is online,\nthat's great.\n\n220\n00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,180\nBut if I look back here in my\nDisk Manager I can see it's online.\n\n221\n00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,023\nAnd there's still no partition, right,\nit's still not ready for me to use, and so\n\n222\n00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,600\nthat's the next step on\ngetting this one ready.\n\n223\n00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,620\nYou initialize the disk and\nthen you create your volumes on it.\n\n224\n00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,750\nSo the next thing that I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna say New-Partition and when we do\n\n225\n00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,350\nthat, we need to specify, again, the disk\nthat we're gonna be building this on.\n\n226\n00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,390\nSo, I'll specify DiskNumber 1.\n\n227\n00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,800\nSo that's the number I'm working on and\n\n228\n00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,530\nthen when I create this disk, the odds\nare I want to assign a drive letter to it.\n\n229\n00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,980\nSo I need to go ahead and do that.\n\n230\n00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,665\nIf you don't specify a drive letter,\n\n231\n00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:27,410\nPowerShell will not\nautomatically attach one.\n\n232\n00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,382\nWe can always come back and\nadd it using the set-partition.\n\n233\n00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:34,020\nSo that'll modify an existing one, but in\nmy case I'm just gonna do it right here.\n\n234\n00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,920\nI'll say AssignDriveLetter.\n\n235\n00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,370\nAnd I could specify which\nletter I want it to have.\n\n236\n00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,180\nIf I leave it blank, it'll just\npick the next available letter, and\n\n237\n00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,910\nthat's what I'm gonna do.\n\n238\n00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,540\nSo I'll just let it go.\n\n239\n00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,350\nAnd then I've got\na couple of options here.\n\n240\n00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,563\nI could say -UseMaxSize,\nwhich is the default.\n\n241\n00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:55,938\nActually, it's Maximum, I think.\n\n242\n00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:58,896\nLet's do some tab auto complete and\nmake sure I give you the right one.\n\n243\n00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,610\nThere it is, there's MaximumSize.\n\n244\n00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,800\nUseMaximumSize.\n\n245\n00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,120\nThat's the default.\n\n246\n00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,010\nIf I were to leave it off, it'll just make\none partition that spans the entire disk,\n\n247\n00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:12,220\ncovers the whole thing, and then it\nassigns it a letter and it's ready to go.\n\n248\n00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,560\nAnd that's what a lot of us want,\n\n249\n00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,759\na lot of us just want one big\npartition across the entire disk.\n\n250\n00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,570\nBut if I want to create something smaller,\nthen I'm gonna need to change that.\n\n251\n00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,000\nAnd I'll need to tell it that size.\n\n252\n00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,271\nSo, I'm gonna say -size, oops,\n\n253\n00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:29,070\n[INAUDIBLE] there we go, and\nI'll do a 64 gigabyte drive.\n\n254\n00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,640\nThe drive itself is 128 gigs, so\nI'm just grabbing half of it.\n\n255\n00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,620\nAnd when I run that, it partitions it and\nit assigns it a drive letter.\n\n256\n00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,230\nAnd so when I look in the background here,\n\n257\n00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,990\nI can see that I now\nhave a 64 gig partition.\n\n258\n00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,960\nIt's showing as raw because it\nhas no format but it is there.\n\n259\n00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,230\nSo there it is, 64 gigs and\nit's ready to rock.\n\n260\n00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,070\nAll right, now where's the drive letter?\n\n261\n00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,450\nWell, you don't see drive letters\nuntil the disk is mounted.\n\n262\n00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,090\nAnd it's not gonna mount\nthe disk until it's formatted.\n\n263\n00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,510\nBut it will remember, it'll remember that\nit's supposed to have a drive letter.\n\n264\n00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,130\nSo as soon as I format it,\nit will get one.\n\n265\n00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,705\nBut for right now,\nit's pretty much ready to rock.\n\n266\n00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:14,420\n[COUGH] If I want, well, actually,\nI can see it right here.\n\n267\n00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,060\nSee how it says DriveLetter E?\n\n268\n00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,900\nSo it's right here on the screen,\nI could do Get-Partition and\n\n269\n00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,990\nthat would show it too.\n\n270\n00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,140\nIt's remembering that it\nshould have drive letter E,\n\n271\n00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,280\neven though it doesn't actually have\nit yet because it's not been formatted.\n\n272\n00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,700\nSo now I need to format it.\n\n273\n00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,440\nAnd we can do that, we've got\nFormat-volume, which kind of maps to\n\n274\n00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,990\nthe old command line format command,\nbut we'll just say format-volume, and\n\n275\n00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,040\nthen we need to tell it what we're gonna\nformat and how we wanna format it.\n\n276\n00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,771\nI'm gonna format this one,\nI'll say -DriveLetter, and this is E.\n\n277\n00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:53,480\nAnd then -FileSystem NTFS.\n\n278\n00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,762\nYou do have a few options there for\nfile system,\n\n279\n00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:59,396\nwe can format things fat32 or xfat.\n\n280\n00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:00,867\nPros and cons of all of those but\n\n281\n00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:04,715\nnormally we want NTFS because that's\nwhere we're gonna get file permissions,\n\n282\n00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:08,360\ndisk encryption, all that other\ngood stuff that most of us need.\n\n283\n00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,380\nSo I'll just format it as NTFS.\n\n284\n00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,700\nThat's gonna format it,\n\n285\n00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,510\nand it's just giving me a warning\nhere that it is gonna erase the disk.\n\n286\n00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,140\nI'm okay with that.\n\n287\n00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,660\nAnd there it goes.\n\n288\n00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,030\nAnd now it's formatted.\n\n289\n00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:25,370\nNow I can see it as my\nE drive formatted NTFS,\n\n290\n00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,950\nit's a fixed disk, and it is healthy.\n\n291\n00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,230\nSo it's up, it's healthy,\nand it's ready to rock.\n\n292\n00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:38,771\nSo let's verify that the partition\nactually shows up, and\n\n293\n00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:41,990\nwe can just go back and do Get-Partition.\n\n294\n00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,990\nAnd I can see right there,\nI've got my E drive.\n\n295\n00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,800\nOr if I do Get-volume,\nI get the nice, pretty view of it.\n\n296\n00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,070\nAnd so I'll do Get-volume and there's that\nE drive right there that we just created.\n\n297\n00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:58,120\nIt's NTFS, it's fixed, it's healthy, and\nit's 63.9 gigs remaining out of 64 gigs,\n\n298\n00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,820\nso it created an exactly 64 gig partition\nthere for me, and it's ready to rock.\n\n299\n00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,850\nAll right, so creating that partition and\nformatting it,\n\n300\n00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,750\nthat worked out pretty well.\n\n301\n00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,820\nNow one little warning,\nyou might have noticed in the background\n\n302\n00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,330\nhere that I've got this little yellow\nfolder that's flashing at me here.\n\n303\n00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,550\nAnd if I look at it,\nit's asking to format the disk.\n\n304\n00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,700\nWindows will automatically detect\nthat that disk needs to be formatted.\n\n305\n00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,820\nThat was after I created the partition but\nbefore I formatted it, so\n\n306\n00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,440\nin between that time Windows automatically\ndetected it and is prompting.\n\n307\n00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,610\nIf I hit Format disk, it's actually\ngonna format it a second time.\n\n308\n00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,830\nSo we can just ignore that and\ncancel it and that'll knock that out.\n\n309\n00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,190\nNow I don't have to worry about it.\n\n310\n00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,840\nAll right, so I've created the partition,\nI've formatted it, now it's ready for use.\n\n311\n00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,190\nIf I'm an end user or whatever,\nI can browse, I've got that E drive.\n\n312\n00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,615\nI can start copying data to it and\neverything's perfect.\n\n313\n00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:56,270\nEverything's working just\nthe way that we want it to.\n\n314\n00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,830\nCompletely flawless as these\nthings always are, right?\n\n315\n00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,842\n[LAUGH] So now I can go back and I'll just\nthrow some data on there to do it and,\n\n316\n00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:07,200\napparently I have to be\nadministrator to do that.\n\n317\n00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,280\nThere we go.\n\n318\n00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,512\nSo I've copied data into it,\nthat drive is available.\n\n319\n00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,000\nAll right now,\nonce we've got the disk available,\n\n320\n00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,090\nand that's really the end of that, right,\nwe just let it run, and off we go.\n\n321\n00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,490\nBut there are some more things that we\ncan do to a disk after it's been made.\n\n322\n00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,990\nIf we look back in the disk manager,\nwe made a 64 gig disk.\n\n323\n00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,960\nThere's still more space at the end.\n\n324\n00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,300\nI might want to extend this\ndisk to fill up that space or\n\n325\n00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,050\nI might want to shrink it to have it take\nless space depending on what my needs are.\n\n326\n00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,940\nWell, you can do shrink and\ngrow operations from the PowerShell.\n\n327\n00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,250\nYou can do it right here in the GUI also\nbut I'm gonna do it in the PowerShell\n\n328\n00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,580\njust to have that kind of full\nset of commands for us there.\n\n329\n00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,010\nSo if I want to shrink or grow this one,\nthe commands are fairly straightforward.\n\n330\n00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,440\nWe actually use\nthe Resize-Partition command.\n\n331\n00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,790\nSo this is gonna resize it, and\nit's the same for shrinking or growing.\n\n332\n00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,920\nYou resize it, you tell it what\npartition you're gonna resize, and\n\n333\n00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,620\nthen you give it a new size.\n\n334\n00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,350\nIf it's smaller than the existing size,\nthen it'll shrink it.\n\n335\n00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,570\nIf it's bigger than the existing size,\nit'll grow it.\n\n336\n00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,970\nSo it's not two different commands,\nit's just one.\n\n337\n00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,260\nAnd so I'm gonna repartition it.\n\n338\n00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:22,004\nAnd I'll say that it is disk number one,\nand then partition number.\n\n339\n00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:27,410\nPartition number 1.\n\n340\n00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,500\nRight now, actually I'd be\nwrong if I did that wouldn't I?\n\n341\n00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,890\nIt's partition number 2.\n\n342\n00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,040\nI'm getting these numbers right here for\nmy output up above.\n\n343\n00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,580\nRight?\n\n344\n00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,950\nWhen I ran the get dash disc.\n\n345\n00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,400\nWhen was the last time we ran that?\n\n346\n00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,000\nSomewhere in here.\n\n347\n00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,650\nHere.\n\n348\n00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,880\nI can see I Get-Partition,\ndisk number one, partition number 2.\n\n349\n00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,070\nThat's my E drive.\n\n350\n00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,280\nThat's the one I'm working on right now.\n\n351\n00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,880\nSo I can see it right there.\n\n352\n00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,920\nAnd that's what I'm\nfeeding into this command.\n\n353\n00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,165\nSo I come in, I say resize partition.\n\n354\n00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,900\nResize-partition-disc1-partition2.\n\n355\n00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,940\nAnd now I tell it the new\nsize that I want.\n\n356\n00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,590\nAnd in my scenario,\nmaybe I'll shrink it first.\n\n357\n00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,340\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nsay size 36 gigabytes.\n\n358\n00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,090\nAll right?\nSo I'm gonna cut it in half.\n\n359\n00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,730\nAnd when I run that, it's gonna run and\nit's gonna shrink it down.\n\n360\n00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,830\nAnd, now it should be a 36-gig partition,\n\n361\n00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,000\nversus the larger partition\nthat it was before.\n\n362\n00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,850\nSo if I do a Get-volume,\n\n363\n00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,070\nnow I can look at it and, sure enough,\nit shows us a 36-gig disk right there.\n\n364\n00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,170\nAnd, back here,\nI can see it's even updated in the GUI.\n\n365\n00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,550\nIt's already reflecting that 36 gigs.\n\n366\n00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,050\nAll right.\n\n367\n00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,190\nIf I wanted to make it bigger,\nI can just bring that command back and\n\n368\n00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,100\nI can put a larger size in there.\n\n369\n00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,215\nWhat if I wanted to fill the whole drive?\n\n370\n00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:50,385\nWell if you wanted to\nfill the whole drive.\n\n371\n00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:55,125\nYou've got the ability to just\nleave that off and when we run it.\n\n372\n00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,975\nOh actually you know it is still going\nto ask me the size of it there isn't it?\n\n373\n00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:01,605\nLet's see I believe it's\nthat use maximum size.\n\n374\n00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:05,825\nNope it's not going to do that either.\n\n375\n00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:10,343\nAll right well we'll just do a little\nget-dash disk and see what our max is.\n\n376\n00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:13,570\nSo we've got 128 gigs as our max.\n\n377\n00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,180\nSo I'll go ahead and just designate that\nas my next one so I'll say dash size,\n\n378\n00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,880\n128 gigabytes, and I'll run that.\n\n379\n00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,200\nI'm just gonna try and expand it.\n\n380\n00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,050\nNow this is a common problem that you\nrun into when you're trying to get\n\n381\n00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,460\nextended all the way to\nthe end of the drive.\n\n382\n00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,770\nAnd the problem is although\nit says 128 gigs you don't\n\n383\n00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,880\nactually have a full 128 gigs available,\nright?\n\n384\n00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,180\nThe size is kinda being rounded for us.\n\n385\n00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:42,100\nSo when I told it 128 gigs it doesn't\ntruly have that much space to grow.\n\n386\n00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,800\nSo there is a command line tag which I\n\n387\n00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,140\nthought was that use maximum\nsize to go to the full one.\n\n388\n00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,316\nLet's just double check our\nhelp documentation here.\n\n389\n00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:54,935\nFor the Resize-Partition.\n\n390\n00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,350\nAnd we'll see if we can't spot it here.\n\n391\n00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,050\nSo we specify that dash size and\n\n392\n00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,600\nthere is another option in here\nthat I am just not seeing.\n\n393\n00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,320\nYeah, maybe I'm just\nremembering this wrong.\n\n394\n00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,650\nSo I do not see an option\nto tell it to go ahead and\n\n395\n00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,600\njust do the full size, interesting.\n\n396\n00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,880\nSo you know what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna do a get-disk,\n\n397\n00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,530\nand let me do that as a format.\n\n398\n00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,410\nDash list, and we'll see if we can't\nfigure out what our biggest space is.\n\n399\n00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,028\nSo, right here it's showing us at 128 GB,\nand it's, hm.\n\n400\n00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:41,832\nYou know, it is just still rounding that\nfor me, so, well, I don't wanna dive\n\n401\n00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:46,240\ntoo deep into rationalizing out that\nnumber, so here's what I'll do.\n\n402\n00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,170\nI'm gonna just make this\na little bit lower, and\n\n403\n00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,110\nwe'll see how close we can get to that.\n\n404\n00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,940\nSo I'm just going to convert that\nfrom gigabytes down to megabytes and\n\n405\n00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,870\nlet it create.\n\n406\n00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:03,460\nSo instead of doing 128 gigs I did\n127,900 megabytes which is 127.9 gigs.\n\n407\n00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,580\nSo really close,\nthat 128 which should have run.\n\n408\n00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,090\nThere we go.\nBut\n\n409\n00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,230\nsee how I have some extra\nspace right there at the end.\n\n410\n00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,090\nSo we kinda have to calculate out\nwhat that maximum number is and\n\n411\n00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,970\nget that to resize.\n\n412\n00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,740\nBut it can be a little tricky\nto get that exact number.\n\n413\n00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,380\nIt's because the way that they\nmeasure the hard drive sizes and\n\n414\n00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,940\nthe way that we convert\nour units of measurement.\n\n415\n00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,380\nSo growing it, though,\nyou just specify that larger size.\n\n416\n00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,570\nIt'll grow to fill that space, as long\nas it's available, and then off you go.\n\n417\n00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,570\nAnd then you can shrink\nit again if you want.\n\n418\n00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,350\nVery dynamic.\n\n419\n00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:36,940\nVery easy to do.\n\n420\n00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,220\nAll right.\nWhat are some\n\n421\n00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,330\nof the other things we that might need\nto do with a disk that we've got?\n\n422\n00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,100\nFormatting it, bringing it online,\nthose are some things.\n\n423\n00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,010\nWe might need to give it a volume label,\nright.\n\n424\n00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,630\nWhen people format drives,\n\n425\n00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,010\nthey usually give them a name and\nthe name shows up here.\n\n426\n00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,360\nAnd if you don't,\nit just gives it local disk, right?\n\n427\n00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,380\nSo, I've got local disk E, local disk C.\n\n428\n00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,280\nWhen you format it,\nyou have the option to give it a label.\n\n429\n00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,140\nIf you didn't like I did,\nyou can always go there after the fact and\n\n430\n00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,740\ngive it a label.\n\n431\n00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,060\nIt doesn't mess with your data.\n\n432\n00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,520\nSo we can always add one if we want.\n\n433\n00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,620\nthe commands that I've been doing, things\nlike resize partition, new-partition,\n\n434\n00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,460\nthose are all creating new things.\n\n435\n00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,500\nBut you can use the set-command\nto go in and change something.\n\n436\n00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,188\nSo I can come in and say set-partition.\n\n437\n00:22:25,188 --> 00:22:28,265\nAnd its got a label option\nthat we can use to go in and\n\n438\n00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,100\ndesignate what we want that label to be.\n\n439\n00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,550\nSo that's what I'm gonna do here.\n\n440\n00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,660\nI'll just say set,\nactually I need to do set dash volume,\n\n441\n00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,540\nand then I'll say DriveLetter E,\n\n442\n00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,420\nand I'm gonna come in and\nspecify what I want that label to be.\n\n443\n00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,760\nAll right, so I didn't assign\na volume label when I formatted,\n\n444\n00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,650\nI'm just gonna do Get-volume here so\nI can see that.\n\n445\n00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,510\nAnd when I look at it, you'll see file\nsystem label and it's blank, and so\n\n446\n00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,540\nis the C drive, right?\n\n447\n00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,120\nThey were just never set.\n\n448\n00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,580\nSo what's happening is Windows is just\nassigning it that local disk name, and\n\n449\n00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,780\nI can go in and\nI can change that if I want.\n\n450\n00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,000\nSo to change it,\nI just need to say Set-volume and\n\n451\n00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,250\nthen I need to specify the drive letter,\nso I'll do DriveLetter E.\n\n452\n00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,140\nAnd then I'm gonna do\nthe NewFileSystemLabel.\n\n453\n00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,200\nAnd then I need to give it a name, right?\n\n454\n00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,560\nSo if this is my E drive, you know?\n\n455\n00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,190\nMaybe that's my storage drive.\n\n456\n00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,050\nThat's where I'm gonna put data.\n\n457\n00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,090\nWell, I might wanna go and\nredo the C drive also.\n\n458\n00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,160\nSo I'll give that one a label of,\nI don't know, operating system.\n\n459\n00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,960\nLet's see, is that too long?\n\n460\n00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,670\nNope.\nOkay.\n\n461\n00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,910\nThere's a maximum amount of characters for\nthe label.\n\n462\n00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,847\nSo, I've just given them names, now if I\ndo get-volume, in addition to having drive\n\n463\n00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:48,298\nletters I'll be able to see these\nlabels that are attached so\n\n464\n00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:50,550\nI can start to identify what these are.\n\n465\n00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,670\nAnd Windows will pick up on those, too.\n\n466\n00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,470\nIf I go back to my explorer I can see\nthey've now got those nice little labels\n\n467\n00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,009\nright there.\n\n468\n00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,749\nOperating System, Storage.\n\n469\n00:23:57,749 --> 00:24:01,350\nIt's there it's available and ready to go.\n\n470\n00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,090\nAll right let's see do\nI have anything else?\n\n471\n00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,840\nOh routine maintenance.\n\n472\n00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,270\nCreating partitions, getting a drive\nformatted, getting it in place,\n\n473\n00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,460\nthat's part of the job right?\n\n474\n00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,110\nWe do that once but\n\n475\n00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,640\nthen while we use the disc over time\nthere's things we might need to do to it.\n\n476\n00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,220\nOne of those maintenance tasks I\nalready showed you, that was resizing.\n\n477\n00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,410\nWe might need to grow or shrink our\npartition, but some of the other\n\n478\n00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:29,570\nthings that we might need to do are things\nlike checking the disk for errors,\n\n479\n00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,950\nright, in the event that we have any kind\nof disk write errors or defragmentation.\n\n480\n00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,470\nWe may need to defragment a drive,\n\n481\n00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,150\nand you can do both of those\nfrom the PowerShell also, right?\n\n482\n00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:43,810\nSo let's say that my E drive,\nI've been copying a lot of data to it and\n\n483\n00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,460\ndeleting a lot of data, and\nfragmentation has started to happen, and\n\n484\n00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,040\nI just wanna go and do some good\nclean maintenance on it, check it for\n\n485\n00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,830\nerrors just to make sure it's fine and\nthen defragment.\n\n486\n00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,880\nAll right well, all I have to do\nis go back to my PowerShell and\n\n487\n00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,930\nI can say,\nlet's see we'll start with defragmenting.\n\n488\n00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:10,100\nI'll say Optimize-Volume -DriveLetter E.\n\n489\n00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,110\nThat's gonna tell it to go and\ndefragment that.\n\n490\n00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,820\nNow this command is hard to remember\nbecause it doesn't have defrag\n\n491\n00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,320\nin the name.\n\n492\n00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,785\nBut that's exactly what it's gonna do.\n\n493\n00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:20,570\nOptimize-Volume is basically defragment.\n\n494\n00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,610\nNow I just created that disk, I haven't\ncopied any files or anything like that so\n\n495\n00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,310\nit's really not gonna need it.\n\n496\n00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,990\nAnd if it's also a virtual drive so\nit's a little upset about that.\n\n497\n00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,880\nSo it's telling me here\nI got a general error,\n\n498\n00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,980\nit's not covered by a more\nspecific code and so on.\n\n499\n00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,020\nI'm trying to defragment a disc\nthat can't be defragmented.\n\n500\n00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:42,040\nBut on a traditional disc it'll run,\nand defragment it and get it clean.\n\n501\n00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,490\nNow, defragmentation is one\nthing that we might need to do.\n\n502\n00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,980\nChecking for errors is another right?\n\n503\n00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,848\nAnd if we need to check for errors,\nthe command for that is very similar.\n\n504\n00:25:52,848 --> 00:25:58,621\nIt's: Repair-Volume, and\nthen we specify the drive letter and\n\n505\n00:25:58,621 --> 00:26:02,650\nthat's going to be my E drive, all right?\n\n506\n00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,010\nAnd so this is the equivalent of running,\n\n507\n00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,720\nlike, check disk from\nthe regular command prompt.\n\n508\n00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,540\nHere it's just Repair-Volume and so if we\nrun that, it's going to look at it, and\n\n509\n00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,530\nI get a real fast response from this\none because it's a virtual drive,\n\n510\n00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,630\nno errors found.\n\n511\n00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,650\nIn real life it might\nactually take a while to run.\n\n512\n00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,720\nIt could take hours if it's\na massive Drive to run, for\n\n513\n00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,530\nme it's gonna run real quick.\n\n514\n00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,160\nAll right, so, optimize-volume and\nrepair-volume.\n\n515\n00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,000\nThose two guys right there, they're\ngonna take care of defragmenting and\n\n516\n00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,650\nchecking for errors.\n\n517\n00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,340\nSo that somethings that you might\nwanna set as a scheduled task.\n\n518\n00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,210\nDefragmenting is usually a scheduled task\non your system, but you can set these to\n\n519\n00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,750\nrun at a time that was acceptable in your\nenvironment and you'll be good to go.\n\n520\n00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,420\nAll right, so\nworking with disks from the command line,\n\n521\n00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,790\nfrom the PowerShell,\nit's not that big of a deal, right?\n\n522\n00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,910\nDisk part from the regular command\nprompt works perfectly fine, but\n\n523\n00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,230\nif you're trying to automate things\nthrough PowerShell, it's always best to\n\n524\n00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,990\nuse native commandlets if you can and\nthese are the ones that take care of it.\n\n525\n00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,740\nAnd there's really not anything\nthat we can do in the GUI or\n\n526\n00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,540\nin this part that you\ncan't do from right here.\n\n527\n00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,862\nSo you do get a lot of flexibility and\npower right inside the power shell.\n\n528\n00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:12,340\nAll right, so in this segment, we got\na chance to see how to initialize a new\n\n529\n00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,220\ndisk, create a partition on it, format\nit and get it lettered and ready to go,\n\n530\n00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,770\nwe saw how to resize the disk,\ndefragment it and check it for errors.\n\n531\n00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,420\nSo we saw a lot of good stuff.\n\n532\n00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,380\nI guess the only thing I left out\nis if you wanna get rid of a disk,\n\n533\n00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,770\nit would be Remove-Partition,\nkind of goes without saying.\n\n534\n00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,340\nSo you would say\nRemove-Partition-DriveLetter and\n\n535\n00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,400\nthe letter.\n\n536\n00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,190\nAnd that would take that partition\nout if you were done with it.\n\n537\n00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,710\nBe careful with that, though, because you\n\n538\n00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,580\ndo get warnings when you go to remove\nit but it's not the same as in the GUI.\n\n539\n00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,410\nYou don't get a ton of warnings on it.\n\n540\n00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,270\nSo it is easier to accidentally remove\na volume if you're not careful.\n\n541\n00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,630\nAll right, well that's about it for\nmanaging disks inside of the Powershell.\n\n542\n00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,880\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n543\n00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,441\nStay tuned,\nwe got more Powershell coming up.\n\n544\n00:27:57,441 --> 00:28:02,660\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

registry\noperations inside of the PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,880\nAs you start to automate processes you'll\nfind that there's commonly a need for\n\n5\n00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,000\nyou to either query\nthe Windows registry to\n\n6\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,420\nfind out information about\nthe systems configuration.\n\n7\n00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,680\nOr maybe even to change the registry,\nto modify the configuration of a system.\n\n8\n00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,310\nAnd you can do all that\nfrom within the PowerShell.\n\n9\n00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,460\nInside of the PowerShell there's actually\nsome really neat functionality that allows\n\n10\n00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,850\nit to access all sorts of different\nthings beyond our normal services and\n\n11\n00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,450\nfile type operations that we expect.\n\n12\n00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,270\nAnd the registry is one of those things\nthat's included that is a little bit\n\n13\n00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,380\nbeyond what the average user thinks of\nwhen they start working with PowerShell.\n\n14\n00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,190\nOne of the ways that we're able to\ndo this is through what's called\n\n15\n00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,780\na PowerShell drive.\n\n16\n00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,550\nIf you haven't watched our segment on\nPowerShell drives yet, I encourage you to\n\n17\n00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,640\nwatch that before this video because I\nshow you how those PowerShell drives work.\n\n18\n00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,520\nAnd how they can interact\nwith the registry.\n\n19\n00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,090\nBut I'm gonna make use of\none of those right here.\n\n20\n00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,420\nInside of the PowerShell it actually\nalready has some mappings to\n\n21\n00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,418\ntwo particular hives\ninside of the registry.\n\n22\n00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:16,960\nH key current user and\nH key local machine.\n\n23\n00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,070\nWhen we modify the registry,\nwe're almost always modifying keys and\n\n24\n00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,350\nvalues that are inside of those two hives.\n\n25\n00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,200\nAnd Microsoft knows that, so\nthey've given us visibility into it.\n\n26\n00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,400\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n27\n00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,460\nWhen you go into the PowerShell, we're\nused to seeing things like our C drive and\n\n28\n00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,120\nnavigating around this user\ninterface as a file system.\n\n29\n00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,090\nThat's what we're used to seeing.\n\n30\n00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,250\nBut there's actually some\ndrive letters that are mapped\n\n31\n00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,730\nthat aren't letters at all.\n\n32\n00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,260\nThey're actually words.\n\n33\n00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:52,270\nIf you do get-ps drive you can see\nPowerShell drives that are defined and\n\n34\n00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,850\nthere's these two guys right here,\nHKCU and HKLM.\n\n35\n00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,380\nThose are registry mappings, and\nthey're mapped to H key current user and\n\n36\n00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,600\nH key local machine.\n\n37\n00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,640\nSo we can actually access\nthose portions of the registry\n\n38\n00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,450\nright here from the command line.\n\n39\n00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,540\nI can type CD or\nChange Directory, HKCM: so\n\n40\n00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,270\njust like I might type CDC: to change\nto the C drive, here I'm doing HKCM.\n\n41\n00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,001\nAnd when I do that it's\ngonna give me in here.\n\n42\n00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:26,962\nOh, it's HKLM.\nI guess maybe if I used the right letters.\n\n43\n00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:28,830\nThere we go.\nAnd now my prompt is going to change, and\n\n44\n00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,800\nI'm in hp local machine, and\nif I do DIR like a directory, it's\n\n45\n00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,430\ngonna pull up a list and I'll start to see\nsome of the things that are in there..\n\n46\n00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,180\nNow keep in mind that even as an\nadministrator you can see I'm running this\n\n47\n00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,350\nas an administrator, there are some things\nin the register we don't have access to,\n\n48\n00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,210\nthe SAM database is one of those.\n\n49\n00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,600\nThat's the security\ndatabase inside of Windows.\n\n50\n00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,460\nSo that's why I got an error\nright there in the list.\n\n51\n00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,910\nThat's to be expected because I'm\nnot allowed to look in there.\n\n52\n00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,000\nBut if I change into one of these\nother subfolders like if I change\n\n53\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,820\ninto the software folder.\n\n54\n00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,010\nI can do a DIR and now I start to see\nthe various keys that are inside of there.\n\n55\n00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,040\nNow be aware of the terminology here.\n\n56\n00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,760\nInside of the registry you have folders\nand those folders are called keys.\n\n57\n00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,920\nInside of a key you might have other keys.\n\n58\n00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,340\nOr you might have other properties,\nall right?\n\n59\n00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,660\nAnd then each property has a value.\n\n60\n00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,652\nLet's look at the graphical user interface\nto kind of get a better idea of that.\n\n61\n00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:30,547\nI'm gonna go into the registry, and\n\n62\n00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:34,850\nI'm gnna go into H key current or\nH key local machine.\n\n63\n00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,390\nAnd I'll go into software, all right.\n\n64\n00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,990\nNow that's where I'm at inside\nof the PowerShell right now.\n\n65\n00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,070\nI'm in this software folder.\n\n66\n00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,390\nAnd as I continue to navigate down,\n\n67\n00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,460\nI'm just navigating from folder to folder,\nright.\n\n68\n00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,120\nI'm going from key to key.\n\n69\n00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,060\nSo, I'm in the software, and\nthen if I go into Microsoft and Windows.\n\n70\n00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,480\nHere, I'll go into,\nI want to go into Windows NT.\n\n71\n00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,540\nI got to put quotes around it\ncuz there's a space in it.\n\n72\n00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,250\nAnd then I'm going to go\ninto current version.\n\n73\n00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,490\nAnd then I'm gonna go into winlogon.\n\n74\n00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,490\nSo I just changed all the way down into\nthat particular area of the registry.\n\n75\n00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,890\nIf I go back to my GUI,\nI can do the same thing.\n\n76\n00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,740\nI can go to Microsoft and\n\n77\n00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,690\nI can find Windows NT here on\nthe list somewhere eventually.\n\n78\n00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,300\nThere it is.\n\n79\n00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,090\nAnd inside of Windows NT,\nI can find Current Version, and\n\n80\n00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,810\ninside of Current Version,\nI can find WinLogon.\n\n81\n00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,960\nRight?\n\n82\n00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,020\nSo there's WinLogon, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,380\nNow when I look at WinLogon,\n\n84\n00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,350\nhere in the GUI I see all these\nvalues inside of it, right?\n\n85\n00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,420\nBut in my PowerShell,\nI'm in that same WinLogon folder.\n\n86\n00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,330\nAnd if I do DIR, I just see this,\nalternate shells,\n\n87\n00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,520\nGP extensions, and\nauto logon check, and that's it.\n\n88\n00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,730\nWhere's everything else?\n\n89\n00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,530\nRight here in the GUI,\nI see a ton of stuff.\n\n90\n00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,170\nBut back there I'm only seeing a couple.\n\n91\n00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,310\nWell the reason is what it's showing\nme in the command line when I\n\n92\n00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,890\ndo those DIR commands,\nthat's just showing me the keys.\n\n93\n00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,760\nIf I expand out the win log\non folder over here and\n\n94\n00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,400\nlook I've got a key\ncalled alternate shells.\n\n95\n00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,560\nAuto log on check, GP extensions\nthat's where those are coming from.\n\n96\n00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,120\nThose are keys,\nit's not showing me the properties.\n\n97\n00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,180\nSo in PowerShell we navigate\nbased on the keys, but\n\n98\n00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,010\nwhat we really want at the end\nof the day are the properties.\n\n99\n00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,520\nWe wanna either see, A,\nwhat's in a property,\n\n100\n00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,820\nso what's a property's current value.\n\n101\n00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,220\nOr B,\nwe need to change the value of a property.\n\n102\n00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,770\nAll right?\n\n103\n00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,970\nSo when we work with a registry,\ngetting to the folder,\n\n104\n00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,600\nthat's only part of our battle.\n\n105\n00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,250\nThe other part is dealing\nwith the property.\n\n106\n00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,670\nNow, I used the DIR commands and\nthe CD, the change directory commands,\n\n107\n00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,360\nand that's the real problem\nwith what I was doing here.\n\n108\n00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,230\nThose map to something a little\nbit different, all right?\n\n109\n00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:11,829\nWhen you use CD, change directory,\nthat's actually mapped to Set-Location.\n\n110\n00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,290\nAll right.\nAnd if you think of what that means.\n\n111\n00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,440\nI'm just sending the location\nof mt current context.\n\n112\n00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,470\nSo where I'm running\ncommands from right now.\n\n113\n00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,883\nSo I set my location to HTLM\n\n114\n00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:29,806\n:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\nNT\\CurrentVersion\\winlogon.\n\n115\n00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:37,205\nWhen I do DIR, DIR is actually alias for\nGet-ChildItem.\n\n116\n00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:38,135\nAll right.\n\n117\n00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:41,035\nAnd when you're running Get-ChildItem,\n\n118\n00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:45,740\nit's saying what's a child of\nthe current key that I'm in.\n\n119\n00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,370\nWell the properties,\nthose are properties of the current key,\n\n120\n00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,600\nthey're not children of the current key\nand that's why they don't show up, and\n\n121\n00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,020\nit's because of what DIR is mapped to.\n\n122\n00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,290\nSo instead, what I really need\nto use is not get-ChildItem,\n\n123\n00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,066\nI need to use get-ItemProperty.\n\n124\n00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:05,320\nGet-ItemProperty of the path that I'm in\n\n125\n00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,210\nwill show me that list of properties and\nthat's what we really expect to see here.\n\n126\n00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:09,810\nRight?\n\n127\n00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,340\nSo, if I do Get-ItemProperty and\nthen I need to tell it a path and\n\n128\n00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,400\nso I can specify .\\ that means the current\ndirectory, the one that I'm in.\n\n129\n00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,290\nIf I was somewhere else,\nI might have to write it out.\n\n130\n00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,750\nSo, I'll just do a .\\.\n\n131\n00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,290\nAnd now I get a list of all of\nthe properties that are inside of there.\n\n132\n00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,030\nSo that was Get-ItemProperty,\nfollowed by the path, I'm already in it.\n\n133\n00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,520\nSo now I can look down this list and\nI see all sorts of things,\n\n134\n00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,090\nlike DefaultDomainName, which is blank.\n\n135\n00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,880\nAnd if I go back over to the GUI, I can\nfind default domain name right there.\n\n136\n00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,230\nThat's the property.\n\n137\n00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,180\nAnd I can see that it's value is empty.\n\n138\n00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,199\nSo now I'm seeing what's on this screen.\n\n139\n00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,018\nSo on the left side that's set location,\nget-childitem.\n\n140\n00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:01,182\nOn the right side That\nis Get-ItemProperty,\n\n141\n00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:06,140\nthat's how we get those values and\nlook at what's in there.\n\n142\n00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,190\nSo a little bit different\nthan what we're used to.\n\n143\n00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440\nThe other thing to keep in mind is\nthat I navigated into that directory.\n\n144\n00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,500\nWe're not always gonna be there,\nwe're not always gonna have that.\n\n145\n00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,570\nSo, for example, I might,\nlet me just put it back here.\n\n146\n00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,290\nI'm gonna change back to my C: drive,\nright?\n\n147\n00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,984\nSo when I launch the PowerShell,\n\n148\n00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:27,898\nit's usually gonna default\nto my user profile, right?\n\n149\n00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:36,185\nSo I might be somewhere like this,\nActually,\n\n150\n00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:39,023\nit would normally start like right in my\nprofile, so something like that, right?\n\n151\n00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:42,700\nSo I fire up a new PowerShell,\nand here I am, right?\n\n152\n00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,759\nAnd if I want to query\nthose registry key values,\n\n153\n00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:53,106\nI can still do Get-ItemProperty but\nthe path is gonna be a lot more complex.\n\n154\n00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:55,570\nAnd you know it's an optional modifier,\n-Path.\n\n155\n00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,420\nYou don't have to put that there,\n\n156\n00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,430\ncuz it assumes you're gonna provide\nthe path next, but I'll do it.\n\n157\n00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,120\nAnd then you can specify that path.\n\n158\n00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,358\nAnd so I could say, HKLM,\nH-key local machine,\n\n159\n00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:11,478\n\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT, shoot,\n\n160\n00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:18,460\nI've got a space, so I gotta go back\nhere and throw in a quote mark,\n\n161\n00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,730\n\\Currentversion\\winlogon, like that.\n\n162\n00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,650\nAnd now it's gonna give me\nthose properties for that path.\n\n163\n00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,970\nSo I can run that and there they are.\n\n164\n00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,910\nSo I don't have to navigate to that\nother folder if I don't want to.\n\n165\n00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,197\nBut if I don't navigate to it then I am\ngoing to have to lay out that full path\n\n166\n00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:39,315\nthat's in there.\n\n167\n00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:41,220\nAnd the same thing goes for\nthe regular user.\n\n168\n00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,198\nIf I want to see programs\nthat run when I log in,\n\n169\n00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:51,940\nthings that auto run well I could do\nGet-ItemProperty like we saw moment ago.\n\n170\n00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,773\nLet me move that up on my screen.\n\n171\n00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:59,891\nBut I'm gonna change this a little bit,\nbecause I want it to be HKCU,\n\n172\n00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:05,169\nH Key Current User\n\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows, and\n\n173\n00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:11,731\nactually I need to get rid of the NT\non this one, \\CurrentVersion\\Run.\n\n174\n00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:16,773\nAnything in that folder, when I log into\nWindows, is going to run as I log in.\n\n175\n00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:20,730\nAnd so here I'm pulling up the item\nproperty for that, and there's nothing.\n\n176\n00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,106\nNothing on my system is set to run\nwhen I log in, so that's cool.\n\n177\n00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:27,490\nSo I've got that, and\nI can query it and pull it up.\n\n178\n00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,023\nAll right?\n\n179\n00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:33,079\nThis is the way that most of us are gonna\nreference those registry entries and\n\n180\n00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,273\nthat's making use of that\nPowerShell drive for the registry.\n\n181\n00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:40,691\nAll right, there is actually\nanother way to write this,\n\n182\n00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:45,300\nlike a long hand way of doing it,\nwithout using the PowerShell drive.\n\n183\n00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,310\nThat little shortcut right there actually\nexplodes out into something very,\n\n184\n00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,260\nvery large.\n\n185\n00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,120\nIf I wanted to type the full syntax for\nthis it's actually a bit different.\n\n186\n00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,060\nLet me just show you guys.\n\n187\n00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,480\nYou probably won't do this in real\nlife because it is kind of annoying.\n\n188\n00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,980\nBut let me just show you so\n\n189\n00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,995\nthat you can know what that full syntax\nactually would be is it would be\n\n190\n00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:13,480\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry.\n\n191\n00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,970\nSo that's me calling the calling\nthe actual, oh I'm spelling Core wrong.\n\n192\n00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,400\nThat's me calling the actual module that's\nallowing me to access the registry.\n\n193\n00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,901\nSo Microsoft.Powershell.Core\\Registry::\nand\n\n194\n00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:30,986\nthen I specify HKEY_Current,\nactually it's all capital,\n\n195\n00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:37,356\nit's not really case sensitive, but\nthey always write it in capitals here.\n\n196\n00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:44,440\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Wind-\nows\\CurrentVersion\\Run, right?\n\n197\n00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960\nThat's where I'm looking.\n\n198\n00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,460\nSo, Microsoft PowerShell core/registry\nis the module that's loading it.\n\n199\n00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,160\nAnd then the :: says this is the path\nthat I want to send to that module.\n\n200\n00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,350\nAnd it gets this long path.\n\n201\n00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,190\nSo considerably longer command, I mean,\nI had to wrap around the screen for\n\n202\n00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,580\nthat one,\nversus using the PowerShell drive there.\n\n203\n00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,520\nThat saves you quite a bit.\n\n204\n00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,350\nBut the result is the same.\n\n205\n00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,310\nIt queries it.\n\n206\n00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,515\nI get that it's empty.\n\n207\n00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,924\nAll right.\nSo looking at these values is pretty\n\n208\n00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:15,820\nstraightforward, right?\n\n209\n00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,606\nWe go and we query them, we can see them,\nthey come up on the screen.\n\n210\n00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,940\nSo that's cool.\n\n211\n00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,560\n[LAUGH] But\nwhat if we wanna work with these more?\n\n212\n00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,630\nWell, we've gotta think about\nthe different ways that we\n\n213\n00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,380\nwork with the values that are on there.\n\n214\n00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,800\nOne of the things that\nwe're going to do is to\n\n215\n00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,630\nbasically query values like we saw here,\nand\n\n216\n00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,770\nactually there's a little problem\nwith the way that I'm querying this.\n\n217\n00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:43,470\nWhen I query something, like for\nexample when I queried winlogon,\n\n218\n00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,981\nit's pretty rare that you'll want\nto see all of the properties.\n\n219\n00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:53,440\nInside of the PowerShell you're normally\nlooking for one in particular, right?\n\n220\n00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,940\nLike, I wanna know what that default\ndomain is set to, or default username.\n\n221\n00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,356\nI wanna know what the default username is,\nor actually, let's do last used.\n\n222\n00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:04,856\nThis is one that I make\nuse of every now and then.\n\n223\n00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:09,740\nIn the active directory, it's hard to\ntell like who uses what computers.\n\n224\n00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,970\nAnd so I will often times write some\nscripts that will reach out there and\n\n225\n00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,950\nquery this, LastUsedUsername.\n\n226\n00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,193\nAnd that way it can tell me,\nI can like generate a quick report and\n\n227\n00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:22,835\nI can see who was the last\nuser on various machines and\n\n228\n00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,440\nnow I have an idea of what\nusers use what computers.\n\n229\n00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,335\nPut a person to a PC.\n\n230\n00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:33,630\nIf I want to query the LastUsedUsername\nof this system I can do it this way,\n\n231\n00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,240\nbut I get a lot of stuff, don't I?\n\n232\n00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,780\nI get a ton of information back here and\nvisually, yeah I can look and find it.\n\n233\n00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,270\nBut if if I'm trying to do this\nprogrammatically, all I want is Don Pezet.\n\n234\n00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,000\nThat's all I want.\n\n235\n00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,880\nI just want that name to come back and\nnot all this other stuff.\n\n236\n00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,315\nWell the default way of pulling that\nup isn't really gonna be adequate.\n\n237\n00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:56,180\nSo I'm gonna need feed it through some\nfilters to be able to achieve what I want.\n\n238\n00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,480\nWell there's a few different\nways to go about that and\n\n239\n00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,740\nI've got a couple of examples on\nhow you can kinda pare that down.\n\n240\n00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,148\nAnd get it a little more reasonable\nas far as what we're getting.\n\n241\n00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:11,750\nIf I wanna jump in here and\npull a very particular one,\n\n242\n00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,981\nwhat I can do is I can take this\nGet-ItemProperty that I ran.\n\n243\n00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,285\nI'm just gonna adjust my window here.\n\n244\n00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:21,165\nI don't want my head to be on top\nof this cuz it's gonna wrap around\n\n245\n00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:22,765\nthe screen again.\n\n246\n00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:24,585\nAnd there we go.\n\n247\n00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:27,615\nSo I'm gonna do this\nGet-ItemProperty -Path.\n\n248\n00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:30,435\nI'm pointing it at winlogon\njust like I did before.\n\n249\n00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:32,845\nThe difference here is I wanna take it and\nmodify it so\n\n250\n00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:34,460\nI only get that one value back.\n\n251\n00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:40,620\nSo what I'll do is I'm\ngonna put this command\n\n252\n00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,520\nin a little bit of a different context,\nall right?\n\n253\n00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:50,580\nI'm gonna say -Name, and I'm gonna specify\nexactly which one I'm looking for,\n\n254\n00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,325\nand I'm looking for the last,\nwhat was the actual name of it?\n\n255\n00:14:54,325 --> 00:15:01,148\nLastUsedUsername, LastUsedUsername.\n\n256\n00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:02,148\nThere we go.\n\n257\n00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:02,690\nAll right.\n\n258\n00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,423\nSo, I just extended that a little bit and\nnow it's diving in and\n\n259\n00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,320\ngetting just that property.\n\n260\n00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,100\nRight?\nSo, here it is.\n\n261\n00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,440\nLastUsedUsername, that's what I queried.\n\n262\n00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,356\nNow, it did get some other\nstuff along with it.\n\n263\n00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:16,430\nThis is just provider information though.\n\n264\n00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,500\nAnd that will be ignored\nby most commands but\n\n265\n00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,670\nI did just get LastUsedUsername Don Pezet.\n\n266\n00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,106\nBut it's still not perfect.\n\n267\n00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:27,190\nBecause even if it had just given me this\none line I don't need this other text.\n\n268\n00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,590\nI want to return just Don Pezet and\nthat's it.\n\n269\n00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,728\nBut, it doesn't do that by default,\nit displays all of this other garbage.\n\n270\n00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:39,760\nSo, I'm gonna modify my command once more,\nI'm going to take the command\n\n271\n00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,157\nas it's written, and\nI'm going to surround it in parentheses.\n\n272\n00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,410\nSo, by sticking it in parentheses\nPowerShell knows that I'm treating this as\n\n273\n00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,348\none big object.\n\n274\n00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:55,668\nSo, that's one big object, go and get that\ndata, and then I'm going to add a dot,\n\n275\n00:15:55,668 --> 00:16:00,389\nwhich is what tells it, get that data and\njust give me a particular piece.\n\n276\n00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:07,249\nAnd I'm going to tell it I want\njust The last used username.\n\n277\n00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,408\nThere we go.\n\n278\n00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:09,300\nAll right.\n\n279\n00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,850\nSo, it's kind of a double query.\n\n280\n00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,390\nI'm querying the registry to\npull the last used username, and\n\n281\n00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,090\nthen I'm querying my output to give\nme just the last used username.\n\n282\n00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,370\nIt's almost like a pipe command,\nbut it's not piping two commands.\n\n283\n00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,170\nThis is all done in one command,\nit's very efficient, runs pretty quick.\n\n284\n00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,550\nAnd when I run that now\nI get just my name back.\n\n285\n00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,990\nI just get Don Pazet.\n\n286\n00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,920\nSo the cool part there is I can take\nsomething like this big long command and\n\n287\n00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,360\nwe can take it and store it in a variable.\n\n288\n00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:49,040\nSo I could say like $pcuser Equals that,\nright?\n\n289\n00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,777\nAnd now if I ever do a Write-Host $pcuser,\n\n290\n00:16:54,777 --> 00:17:00,020\nit's just gonna echo that, Don Pezet,\nright, so that's all I get back.\n\n291\n00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,800\nSo it does require a little\nbit of manipulation.\n\n292\n00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,230\nIf you're just trying to pull the value\nout of a particular registry key,\n\n293\n00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,550\nthat's the easiest way to do it.\n\n294\n00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,240\nThere are other ways to do it but\n\n295\n00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,010\nthat's the easiest one that I've\nfound over the last several years.\n\n296\n00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,730\nSo that gives me exactly\nthe information I want.\n\n297\n00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,670\nNow I'm reading values out of the registry\nand I can do that right in my scripts.\n\n298\n00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,360\nI can check for things like this and\nI can report it back to wherever I need.\n\n299\n00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,310\nSo pretty neat stuff there.\n\n300\n00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,870\nI used to do this all the time where we'd\nhave a branch office that we were gonna do\n\n301\n00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,940\nmaintenance on, and if there was\na computer that I thought might be\n\n302\n00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,055\ninfected by a virus or\nI was gonna take offline for some reason.\n\n303\n00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,095\nI could query this and\nfind that last person who used it.\n\n304\n00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:40,503\nAnd I can reach out to them.\n\n305\n00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:42,605\nAnd I can say hey Bob or Sally or\n\n306\n00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:44,785\nwhatever, I need to take\nthat computer offline.\n\n307\n00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:46,115\nDo you share it with anybody else?\n\n308\n00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:47,405\nIf so, can you let them know too.\n\n309\n00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:48,695\nWe're taking that computer offline.\n\n310\n00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:50,970\nAnd so\nthat's how we keep people kind of posted.\n\n311\n00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,290\nAll right, so that's an example\nof querying a registry value.\n\n312\n00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:01,600\nBut what if we want to actually\nmodify one, or create one.\n\n313\n00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,110\nSo there's all sorts of different things\nwe can do there for creating things.\n\n314\n00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,080\nNow, typically we're not creating keys,\n\n315\n00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,870\nwe're not normally creating folders inside\nof the registry, we're typically creating\n\n316\n00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,100\nproperties, we're adding values or\nremoving values or whatever.\n\n317\n00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,610\nSo there's a few different\nways we can go about that.\n\n318\n00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,780\nWhen it comes to, let's see,\nwhat should we do first here?\n\n319\n00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,900\nLet's do, we could modify one I suppose.\n\n320\n00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,580\n>> We have a few different commands.\n\n321\n00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,440\nThey're all really the same,\nright so if I do Get-Command and\n\n322\n00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,130\nI look for *-ItemProperty, right?\n\n323\n00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,180\nSo the item properties\nare what we're manipulating.\n\n324\n00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,030\nAnd you'll see where we've got\nGet Item Property, New Item Property,\n\n325\n00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,090\nRemove Item Property.\n\n326\n00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,810\nThose are the three main ones that we use.\n\n327\n00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,340\nAlright?\n\n328\n00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,620\nSo I just used get item\nproperty to query one.\n\n329\n00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,530\nI could use New Item Property\nto make a new one and\n\n330\n00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,330\nI just need to tell it the path and\nthe value, you specify that.\n\n331\n00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,080\nAnd then the Set-ItemProperty,\nthat's how I populate it.\n\n332\n00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,500\nThat's how I give that property a value.\n\n333\n00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,992\nSo, if I want to do define a registry key,\n\n334\n00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:09,311\nit's Set-ItemProperty that I'm making use\nof to do that, to put that value in there.\n\n335\n00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:12,840\nSo, we've got a number of different\n\n336\n00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,800\nthings that we might choose\nto put in place or mess with.\n\n337\n00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,400\nLet's start by, maybe we'll remove one.\n\n338\n00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,300\nSo that default domain policy,\nif I want to get rid of that one.\n\n339\n00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,020\nIf I go back here.\n\n340\n00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,920\nWhen you log into Windows,\nthere's a default domain that it uses.\n\n341\n00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,030\nAnd you'll see mine's blank.\n\n342\n00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,200\nI don't have one set.\n\n343\n00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200\nSo I'm not worried about\nlosing any data there.\n\n344\n00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,810\nSo if I wanna get that value out of there.\n\n345\n00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,180\nI just wanna take that property out and\nget it done with.\n\n346\n00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,990\nI can go in here and\nI can say Remove-ItemProperty and\n\n347\n00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,520\nthen I need to specify the property.\n\n348\n00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,380\nNow this is where things do get\na little bit challenging because\n\n349\n00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,240\nof how long these commands can be.\n\n350\n00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,460\nAnd if you've got like\na PowerShell drive set up.\n\n351\n00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,070\nYou can set up short cuts or\n\n352\n00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,570\nif you navigate to that folder that'll\nmake your commands a lot shorter too.\n\n353\n00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,630\nSo I'm gonna do that to save me some time.\n\n354\n00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,180\nI'm gonna just set my location\n\n355\n00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,257\nto HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft,\n\n356\n00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:13,763\nand we need Windows NT.\n\n357\n00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:24,060\n\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon, which we'll\nget to eventually, there, all right.\n\n358\n00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,150\nSo by changing my path, now when I start\nto run these commands, I don't have to\n\n359\n00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:32,830\nspecify a big long path, I can just say\n./, ./ meaning the current directory.\n\n360\n00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,849\nThat's what I'm working in.\n\n361\n00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:36,500\nAll right, so if I wanna wipe one out,\n\n362\n00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,532\nI can say Remove-ItemProperty.\n\n363\n00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,370\nAll right, so\nI tell it I'm wiping one out.\n\n364\n00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,930\nI need to tell it the path, but\ntha path is easy for me now, right,\n\n365\n00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,310\nbecause the path, in this case,\nis right here, right?\n\n366\n00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,380\nSo the property is right in\nthe folder that I'm in and\n\n367\n00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,990\nI need to tell it which\none I'm getting rid of.\n\n368\n00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,555\nAnd so in my case I want\nto get rid of the default.\n\n369\n00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:05,200\nDomain, which I believe\nis what it was called.\n\n370\n00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,340\nIt was right here I got whoops,\nI got my GUI in the background,\n\n371\n00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,380\nI can just look there.\n\n372\n00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,240\nDefault Domain Name,\nthat's what it was called.\n\n373\n00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,640\nSo, I'm just letting it know here that\nI want to remove that item property.\n\n374\n00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,425\nThe path is right here in this\ndirectory that I'm in and\n\n375\n00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:25,920\nthe property needs to specified\nseparate from the path.\n\n376\n00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,000\nSo I need to say -Name, there we go.\n\n377\n00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,970\nSo, the path is right here in this folder,\nthis key that I'm in and then -Name.\n\n378\n00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,060\nThe name of the property I want to\nget rid of is default domain name.\n\n379\n00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,130\nSo I'll run that.\n\n380\n00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,220\nYou don't get a lot of\nfeedback on this command, so\n\n381\n00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,000\nit's always a good idea to verify, right.\n\n382\n00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,010\nSo it did something.\n\n383\n00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,290\nIt moved to the a next line and\ndidn't give me an error.\n\n384\n00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,509\nSo I probably need to\ndo a Get-ItemProperty.\n\n385\n00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,070\nAnd I can just look for\nthe path right here.\n\n386\n00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,480\nAnd I'm just going to look and\nsee if I have that default domain name.\n\n387\n00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,380\nI see default user name right there,\nbut default domain name is now gone.\n\n388\n00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,320\nI've removed that item property.\n\n389\n00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,000\nAll right.\n\n390\n00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,580\nSo that was just\nRemove-ItemProperty -Path and\n\n391\n00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,420\nI didn't have to type anything crazy\ncuz I'm already in the folder.\n\n392\n00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,100\nAnd then -Name, the name of the property.\n\n393\n00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,360\nNow if I want to create an item property,\n\n394\n00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,720\nif I wanna put that one back in,\nit's just New-ItemProperty.\n\n395\n00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,938\nSo pretty easy, same basic syntax too.\n\n396\n00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:27,370\nIf we New-ItemProperty,\nwe can then go through and\n\n397\n00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,450\nspecify all the various criteria or\n\n398\n00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,304\nwhatever it is that we need to have in\nthere to get that one put back in place.\n\n399\n00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:35,449\nI'll say -Path .\\, right,\n\n400\n00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:39,751\nit's gonna be in this particular\nfolder that I'm in right now.\n\n401\n00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:44,710\nThe -Name which will be DefaultDomainName,\nall right?\n\n402\n00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,950\nThat's the name of\nthe value I'm modifying.\n\n403\n00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,300\nAnd then here I can actually\nspecify the value if I've got it.\n\n404\n00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,600\nYou know,\nI might not know what I want yet.\n\n405\n00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,860\nI can just say -Value and\nthen what I want that value to be.\n\n406\n00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,060\nSo my domain name is \"ITPROTVNET\" and\nso I'll punch that in there.\n\n407\n00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,630\nAnd now it's gonna create\nthe default domain name property and\n\n408\n00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,120\nset its value to ITPROTVNET.\n\n409\n00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,430\nAnd if I look back here,\nI can refresh this screen.\n\n410\n00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,940\nNow let's see.\n\n411\n00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,970\nDoes it not let me do a refresh?\n\n412\n00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,360\nWe'll do the old F5,\nsince I don't have a menu item.\n\n413\n00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,080\nBut I can see now default domain name\nis showing as being ITPROTVNET ,right?\n\n414\n00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,270\nNow the default thing that it does\nis it creates a string value.\n\n415\n00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,400\nSee how it says reg sz.\n\n416\n00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,910\nSo it created a string value.\n\n417\n00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,870\nBut you don't always want that.\n\n418\n00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,820\nNotice how we've got d words up here,\nwhen you create a registry property\n\n419\n00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,390\nthere's several different\ntypes that you can make.\n\n420\n00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,400\nStrings, binaries, D-words, Q-words,\nall sorts of different stuff.\n\n421\n00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,786\nSo the default is a string and most of\nthe stuff in the registry is that way, but\n\n422\n00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:53,948\nnot everything is.\n\n423\n00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:57,877\nSo when you're creating one if you\nneed one of those other types,\n\n424\n00:23:57,877 --> 00:24:02,249\nwell you'll need to specify that too\nalongside of this so that it knows.\n\n425\n00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:07,169\nAnd the way you do that\nis with -PropertyType.\n\n426\n00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:08,349\nAnd then what that type is.\n\n427\n00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:11,781\nNow, I created a string, so\nI could say property type string, but\n\n428\n00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:12,960\nthat's the default.\n\n429\n00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,280\nSo, that's why I didn't specify it.\n\n430\n00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,440\nBut, just in case you need to\ncreate a d-word or whatever,\n\n431\n00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,570\nyou would say property type d-word and\nit would know to create that instead.\n\n432\n00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,260\nAll right.\n\n433\n00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:29,002\nSo, if that record already existed,\ninstead of new-item property,\n\n434\n00:24:29,002 --> 00:24:32,710\nI would simply say, set-item property.\n\n435\n00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,640\nRight?\nThat's how we modify one.\n\n436\n00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,630\nIf I were to take this command here,\nand I wanted to change it,\n\n437\n00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,380\nmaybe I've got ITProTVNET,\nand I want to change that to,\n\n438\n00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,490\nwe'll just do workgroup Right?\n\n439\n00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,910\nSo I want that default\ndomain to be workgroup.\n\n440\n00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,130\nI can take this same command and\njust say Set-ItemProperty.\n\n441\n00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,220\nThe path is right here,\n\n442\n00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,320\nthe name is DefaultDomainName and\nthe value is going to be workgroup.\n\n443\n00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,330\nAnd that's gonna set it\nbecause it already exists.\n\n444\n00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,930\nAnd so if I go into here and I refresh\nthat I can see that now it's changed.\n\n445\n00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,650\nIt's set to workgroup.\n\n446\n00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:17,100\nSo that's creating a property, deleting\na property, and changing a property.\n\n447\n00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,160\nAnd those are the three things\nthat we do most of the time.\n\n448\n00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,920\nSo you're running a script, and\nyou might create a registry key, so\n\n449\n00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,490\nit's doing something.\n\n450\n00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,160\nYou then change it to populate it with\nvalues while your script is running and\n\n451\n00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,490\nthen when your script is all done,\nyou might remove those registry values.\n\n452\n00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,950\nThose three operations,\nthose happen all the time.\n\n453\n00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,150\nYou may also need to go through and\n\n454\n00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,420\nquery the values to verify\nthat they're there, and\n\n455\n00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,950\nthat's where we use that get-ItemProperty\nthat I showed you earlier.\n\n456\n00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,660\nAnd so if I want to modify that with\nthis syntax earlier when I did that.\n\n457\n00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,700\nLet's see where is my example.\n\n458\n00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,630\nHere.\n\n459\n00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,520\nThis example was much,\n\n460\n00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,990\nmuch longer than I need it to be\nbecause I'm already in that path.\n\n461\n00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,440\nSo I could shorten that a good bit.\n\n462\n00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,305\nAnd I could say Get-ItemProperty -Path and\nthen point that to the local directory and\n\n463\n00:26:06,305 --> 00:26:10,264\nthen -Name,\nI want to to be DefaultDomainName.\n\n464\n00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:17,323\nAnd then I'm going to tell it that\nI just want default domain name and\n\n465\n00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:19,920\nnot all that other stuff until I query it.\n\n466\n00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,540\nAnd there we go.\n\n467\n00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,010\nI got work group, right?\n\n468\n00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:26,560\nSo those four commands right there:\ncreating a key modifying a key, or\n\n469\n00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,280\nsorry not keys, creating a property,\nmodifying a property, deleting a property,\n\n470\n00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,080\nthose are pretty important, and\nthen querying, or getting the property.\n\n471\n00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,535\nThose four things are what we\nnormally do inside of our scripts.\n\n472\n00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:39,385\nAll right?\n\n473\n00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:41,635\nNow you can do the keys also.\n\n474\n00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:45,185\nWith the keys you just use\nyour regular director command.\n\n475\n00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:48,545\nSo if I want to make my own sub-folder,\nfor\n\n476\n00:26:48,545 --> 00:26:53,335\nexample, if I've got let's see.\n\n477\n00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,610\nIf I want to create my own software\npackage, right, so I might have DonCo.\n\n478\n00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,390\nRIght?\n\n479\n00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,730\nAnd so, I just created a DonCo folder\nby using MKDIR, make directory.\n\n480\n00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,120\nRIght?\nAnd make directory, if I do get-alias,\n\n481\n00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,990\nyou can see that that's really just mapped\nto, apparently it mapped to nothing.\n\n482\n00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,810\nWell that's interesting.\n\n483\n00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,680\nAnyhow it's just should be\nmapped to new-child item.\n\n484\n00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,990\nThat may just be something\nthat's built in.\n\n485\n00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,090\nI always assumed that was an alias.\n\n486\n00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:31,170\nBasically it's, hm MD is [INAUDIBLE]\nI guess is its own little command.\n\n487\n00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,930\nI learned something new everyday I guess.\n\n488\n00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,320\nBut I can make those keys really easy.\n\n489\n00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,780\nI don't have to do any crazy long syntax\n\n490\n00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,550\nbecause the PowerShell drive\nlets me do it, all right.\n\n491\n00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,065\nBut I could if I wanted\nto do it the long way.\n\n492\n00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:47,435\nI could do the new-child item and\n\n493\n00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:51,725\nthen specify that path and layout that\nnew folder and kind of go that route too.\n\n494\n00:27:51,725 --> 00:27:52,755\nThey're both effective.\n\n495\n00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,635\nThis is just considerably simpler.\n\n496\n00:27:54,635 --> 00:27:58,090\nAnd we get that created, so now I've\ngot a DonCo folder inside of Software.\n\n497\n00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,829\nAnd now I can start to create all\nthe values that I needed by doing\n\n498\n00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:08,108\nthe new-ItemProperty, and\nthen specifying the path of right here,\n\n499\n00:28:08,108 --> 00:28:13,940\nand then specifying the name of the\nItemProperty, and the value, and so on.\n\n500\n00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,762\nSo maybe I have a property\ncalled Registered, so\n\n501\n00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:22,798\nI'm checking whether people have\nregistered my software, and\n\n502\n00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:28,204\nthe value for it might be false by\ndefault, so I can get that created,\n\n503\n00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:35,360\nand now it's in there, and now I can query\nthat see if people registered my software.\n\n504\n00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,990\nAnd then one day somebody can figure out\nmy cheesy registration scheme and go and\n\n505\n00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,880\nchange that to true and not pay me.\n\n506\n00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,470\nSo that's the basics right there of\nmessing with those records and values.\n\n507\n00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,710\nPretty straightforward.\n\n508\n00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,950\nThe only tricky part about this is\njust that most people don't know\n\n509\n00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,510\nabout it, right?\n\n510\n00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,360\nAnd it's really easy to get in there and\n\n511\n00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,180\nwork with the registry all from\ninside of the power shell.\n\n512\n00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,110\nNow, in real life land,\nif I want to modify a registry value\n\n513\n00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,742\nI will almost always just go right here\ninto regedit and do it via the GUI.\n\n514\n00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,660\nSo, the time that we make use of it\nhere in the PowerShell is when we want\n\n515\n00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,940\nto automate things.\n\n516\n00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,760\nWhen you want to run a script and\nhave it manipulate some values.\n\n517\n00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,230\nWhen you want to set things,\nlike that default domain name.\n\n518\n00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,190\nIf you're in a multi-domain environment,\n\n519\n00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,190\nwhen somebody logs in they can\nchoose from the different domains.\n\n520\n00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,330\nWell, you might want to\nset their default one, and\n\n521\n00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,090\nyou might need to set that\nacross a thousand computers.\n\n522\n00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,050\nYou don't want to go to each one.\n\n523\n00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,520\nYou could do a group policy object, but\n\n524\n00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,460\nif it's an environment where\nyou don't have that control or\n\n525\n00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,660\nthat ability you could also just\ndo it through a PowerShell script.\n\n526\n00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,380\nAnd you could do it just like this,\npush it along, and\n\n527\n00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,830\nnow all those machines get\ntheir default value set.\n\n528\n00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,930\nSo pretty cool stuff, pretty useful, and\n\n529\n00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,015\ndefinitely something that you'll\nmake use of out in your life land.\n\n530\n00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,960\nAll right, I think I've pretty much\ncovered everything that I wanted to.\n\n531\n00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,150\nLet me see if I missed\nanything in my notes here.\n\n532\n00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,910\nLooks like we got it all.\n\n533\n00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:02,220\nSo In this segment, we got a chance to see\nhow to navigate inside of the registry,\n\n534\n00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,450\nbased on using the PowerShell\ndrive functionality.\n\n535\n00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,200\nWe got a chance to see how to query\nthe keys inside of the registry as well\n\n536\n00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,070\nas well as how to query the properties,\nso how to return the values for\n\n537\n00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,040\nthe properties.\n\n538\n00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,720\nAnd then lastly we saw how to create,\nchange, and\n\n539\n00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,830\nremove those same properties so that we\ncan support our software and our scripts.\n\n540\n00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,050\nAll right,\nhopefully you guys enjoyed that segment.\n\n541\n00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,035\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n542\n00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:35,050\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,164\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:11,781\nIn this segment, we're going to be taking\na look at configuring our network adaptors\n\n3\n00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:14,000\nwith using the Microsoft PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,640\nNow I know for me, when I use PowerShell,\n\n5\n00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,730\na lot of times I try to get in and\nget out as fast as I can.\n\n6\n00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,270\nAnd not mess with it too much because\nI don't remember the commands.\n\n7\n00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,420\nAnd so with a new server, one of the first\nthings that I need to do is assign an IP\n\n8\n00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,740\naddress to it and open up some firewall\nports so I can remote manage it.\n\n9\n00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,840\nAnd then that's the end of me using\nPowerShell on a core server installer or\n\n10\n00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,630\nsomething like that.\n\n11\n00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,470\nSo.\nthose\n\n12\n00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,651\nare some of the things that we\nare going to take a look at here.\n\n13\n00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:39,770\n>> Yeah, cause you really have to.\n\n14\n00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,430\nWhen you first set up\nthat core installation,\n\n15\n00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,048\nyou know you are going to\nend up managing it remotely.\n\n16\n00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:47,290\nBut, you can't manage it remotely\nuntil you have set up your WinRM,\n\n17\n00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,240\nyour remote management.\n\n18\n00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,750\nSet up your firewall rules and\ngiven it a name, and\n\n19\n00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,740\ngiven it an IP address, conjoin it to\nthe domain and all that good stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,810\nSo we've got to know those commands at\nleast to get that guy on the network,\n\n21\n00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,110\nget it manageable.\n\n22\n00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,350\nAnd then from then on we can use\nour remote management and our GUIs.\n\n23\n00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,190\nThank God. [LAUGH] >> Now the tricky\npart here is inside of the PowerShell\n\n24\n00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,900\nthere is more than one way to\nreference your network adapter.\n\n25\n00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,580\nSo we have a series of\ncommands that we can use,\n\n26\n00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,970\njust like all of the other\nPowerShell shows.\n\n27\n00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,740\nOur get commands, our set commands,\nour remove or whatever.\n\n28\n00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,490\nBut how do we reference which\nadapter we're working with?\n\n29\n00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,840\nBecause on a server you'll typically\nhave more than one adapter.\n\n30\n00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,300\nEven on a desktop or laptop though,\n\n31\n00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,190\nyou might have a wireless and\na wired adapter, Bluetooth.\n\n32\n00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,940\nRight, they all show up as adapters.\n\n33\n00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,830\nSo let's start with the real basics.\n\n34\n00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,920\nHow do we get information\nabout our network adapter?\n\n35\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,720\nWell, the first thing command we're gonna\nsee is the get-netadapter command and\n\n36\n00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,950\nif we just run that, here,\nI'll fire that up in my PowerShell.\n\n37\n00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,150\nI'll just run get-netadapter.\n\n38\n00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,420\nThat'll give me my list of network\nadapters that are in my system.\n\n39\n00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,480\nAnd I can see that I've gone one, it's an\nIntel 82574L gigabit network connection.\n\n40\n00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,130\n>> Nice [LAUGH]\n>> It's got a name,\n\n41\n00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,270\nin this case it's called local network.\n\n42\n00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,530\nIt's got a description,\nwhich is that big long run-on there.\n\n43\n00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,540\nIt's got an interface index, which is 12.\n\n44\n00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,838\nAnd, what is that?\n\n45\n00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:09,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's Microsoft just assigning\n\n46\n00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,000\na numerical identifier to your interface.\n\n47\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,750\nAnd they do that because,\nyou have a lot of virtual interfaces too,\n\n48\n00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,593\nlike your IPv6 tunnel interfaces.\n\n49\n00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,410\n>> Mm-hm, tunnel, yep.\n\n50\n00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,400\n>> They come and go and so you may or\nmay not have those numbers and\n\n51\n00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,290\nthey just give a simple\nway to reference them.\n\n52\n00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,490\n>> Yeah, that's a real good command\nto know cuz that one, like you said,\n\n53\n00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,250\ngives you the list of\neverything you've got.\n\n54\n00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,240\nAnd then you got your choice of\nhow you wanna reference that.\n\n55\n00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,250\nDo you wanna reference it by name or\n\n56\n00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,080\ndo you wanna reference\nit by that index number?\n\n57\n00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,270\nIt's also a reason I usually change\nthe names on most of my adapters.\n\n58\n00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,030\nTo something a little shorter,\nLAN1, LAN2 no spaces.\n\n59\n00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,170\nUnfortunately I still gotta use my\nquotes in PowerShell, in the prompt,\n\n60\n00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,110\nin the old school command prompt.\n\n61\n00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,270\nIf you didn't have any spaces in there,\n\n62\n00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,220\nthen you could get away without\nthe quotations around it.\n\n63\n00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,050\n>> Yeah, and you know that,\n\n64\n00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,740\nthat name, that was just\nthe automatically assigned one.\n\n65\n00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,940\nI didn't assign it.\n\n66\n00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,600\nIs my search anywhere not gonna work?\n\n67\n00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,370\nThere, network and sharing center.\n\n68\n00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,390\nSo, you know, if you go in your network\nand sharing center into your adapter,\n\n69\n00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,240\nsee how it's just called\nlocal network right there?\n\n70\n00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,846\nAnd I could rename that, you know,\ncall it IT Pro TV studio.\n\n71\n00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:15,174\n>> Now that's even longer than\nwhat you started with [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:17,003\n>> You know, it sort of is, isn't it.\n\n73\n00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:20,670\nSo heck maybe we just call it LAN.\n\n74\n00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,060\n>> Call it LAN one and\nLAN two, that's what I do.\n\n75\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,230\n>> Easy as possible.\n\n76\n00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,730\nSo then, that's what's being\nreturned right back here.\n\n77\n00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,040\nIf I do get-netadapter,\nnow it's got that nice short name of LAN.\n\n78\n00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,910\nThat does make a lot of the other\ncommands we're gonna run easier.\n\n79\n00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,760\nYou really have a couple of choices here.\n\n80\n00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,780\nAnd as we work with it you need to pick,\n\n81\n00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,530\ndo you want to go with\nthe interface index number?\n\n82\n00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,140\nThat's easy if you know the Interface\nindex number or you can query to get it.\n\n83\n00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,730\nOr do you want to use the named identifier\nadapter which can be easier because\n\n84\n00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,140\nthey're simple to remember.\n\n85\n00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,410\nBut it's up to you.\n\n86\n00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,750\nSo when you're watching this show,\n\n87\n00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,260\nif you're watching this\nlive you won't see this.\n\n88\n00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,940\nBut if you're watching this recorded\nyou'll see the show notes beneath\n\n89\n00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,930\nthe episode and\na lot of the commands we list twice.\n\n90\n00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,400\nOnce using the interface index number and\nonce using the name.\n\n91\n00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,990\nTwo different ways to run the same command\nbased on the information you know.\n\n92\n00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,020\nOne of the things I like\nto do with names is,\n\n93\n00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,680\nthe interface index number can vary\nfrom server to server to server.\n\n94\n00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,950\nBut if you take your server and\nyou say all right,\n\n95\n00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,660\nhere's gonna be my management\ninterface adapter.\n\n96\n00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,690\nAnd so I'm gonna rename it management.\n\n97\n00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,990\nSo now on all of your servers you\nhave an adapter called management.\n\n98\n00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,040\nThe index number might be\ndifferent on all of your servers,\n\n99\n00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,760\nbut the name is always management.\n\n100\n00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,910\nNow you can easily create one\nscript that can run on everywhere\n\n101\n00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,530\nbecause the name is always the same.\n\n102\n00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,070\nThe interface index number,\nto my knowledge you can't change but\n\n103\n00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,160\nyou might be able to.\n\n104\n00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,120\n>> No, I think it generates it and\nyou never really know.\n\n105\n00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,140\nIt does seem to start with 12.\n\n106\n00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,720\nI don't know why it starts\nwith that number but\n\n107\n00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,250\nI've seen where on just\nabout every machine I go to.\n\n108\n00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,340\nMultiple network adapters they start\nat 12, 13, 14 and work their way up.\n\n109\n00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,040\n>> They must reserve the others for\nsomething, who knows.\n\n110\n00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,169\nProbably SharePoint or\nMSN messenger [LAUGH].\n\n111\n00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:03,330\nAll right well, so now we've got some\nbasic information about our adapter.\n\n112\n00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,050\nAnd if we want wanna work with it, well\nwe've more get commands that we can use.\n\n113\n00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,670\nThere is more than what shows\nup here on this screen.\n\n114\n00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,780\nSee how my link speed is\nbeing truncated and all.\n\n115\n00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,550\nSo if we pipe that into format list,\nwe can see all the additional information.\n\n116\n00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,950\nI can see it's an 802.3 adapter, which\npretty much everything these days is.\n\n117\n00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,480\n>> Right.\nI can see that it's up.\n\n118\n00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,010\nIt's a 1-gig connector.\n\n119\n00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,970\nI can see that speed, and the driver\ninformation is attached there also.\n\n120\n00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,350\n>> Yeah, this git net adapter is\nreally giving me properties about\n\n121\n00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,150\nthe adapter itself.\n\n122\n00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,330\nThat's we're not seeing our TCPI settings\nand things like that, or IP address.\n\n123\n00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,580\nThat's not showing up in there\nthat's a different command.\n\n124\n00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,970\nIt was a git-net IP address, I think.\n\n125\n00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,710\nI don't know about you.\n\n126\n00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,940\nI still use ipconfig half\nthe time when I'm in PowerShell.\n\n127\n00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's actually shorter to type.\n\n128\n00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,055\nI know you can do your tab autofill and\nstuff like that.\n\n129\n00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:52,550\nBut, there's an alias for ipconfig, so\n\n130\n00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,195\nI can still use that\nright here in PowerShell.\n\n131\n00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:57,090\n>> Get-NetIPAddress.\n\n132\n00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,400\nAnd that returns all that\ninformation about what your IPs are.\n\n133\n00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,930\nAll right, so we get that information, we\ncan see it, we can start to work with it.\n\n134\n00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,330\nAnd some of the things that we're gonna\nwanna do are are things like adding new\n\n135\n00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,810\ninterfaces if we're tunneling or\nmodifying these interfaces.\n\n136\n00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,920\nAttaching IP addresses to an interface.\n\n137\n00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,360\nAnd so we've got our standard get and\nset commands that we use for that for\n\n138\n00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,390\nchanging and modifying things.\n\n139\n00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,090\nThe first one that I want\nto talk about is DHCP.\n\n140\n00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,540\nFor a lot of us this initial configuration\nis as simple as turning on DHCP.\n\n141\n00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,620\nAnd typically that's the default for\n\n142\n00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,750\nyour system, usually DHCP is already on\nand you don't have to worry about it.\n\n143\n00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,200\nBut let's say that I want to turn\non DHCP or I want to turn it off.\n\n144\n00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,230\nWell turning it off is just a matter\nof assigning a static, right?\n\n145\n00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,100\n>> Yeah cause really when\nyou first set up that core,\n\n146\n00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,790\nyou guys have all installed server before.\n\n147\n00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,830\nWhen we install server core for\nthe first time or\n\n148\n00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,760\nwhen we install server for the core,\nit's got that default configuration.\n\n149\n00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,040\nWhich means it's going to have\na generated name by Windows,\n\n150\n00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,490\nsome kind of Win dash blah blah blah, and\nit's gonna have a dynamic IP address.\n\n151\n00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,350\nIn most of our servers,\nwe're not gonna want that, right?\n\n152\n00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,270\nWe're gonna wanna statically map that.\n\n153\n00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,810\nSo, one of the first few commands we're\ngonna do is gonna be to statically map\n\n154\n00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,670\nthat IP address and to disable the DHCP.\n\n155\n00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,560\n>> Alright, so this command, we'll go\nahead and show some of the different ways\n\n156\n00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,160\nto run it with a different name and\ninterface index, and all that stuff.\n\n157\n00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,050\nFuture commands, we'll just show one way.\n\n158\n00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,230\nBut, let's say I wanna modify this\nwhen all I know is my interface name.\n\n159\n00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,390\nAll right, now this is how I am.\n\n160\n00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,420\nI'm gonna show you guys the command that\nI run, normally, first, which is not\n\n161\n00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,290\nnecessarily the easiest one, but\nit is based on what I can keep in my head.\n\n162\n00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,070\nI can remember the name of an adapter,\nand that's about it.\n\n163\n00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:37,410\nWhen you run get-netadapter, it actually\nreturns a list of all your adapters.\n\n164\n00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,100\nSo if I had five different net adapters\nthey'd all come back here, but\n\n165\n00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,660\nyou can add a little more to that.\n\n166\n00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,695\nYou can say get-netadapter and\nyou can specify an individual name.\n\n167\n00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:48,655\nNow I can remember that.\n\n168\n00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:51,125\nI know my adapter is called LAN.\n\n169\n00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,515\nThe output looks the same but\nit is actually filtered at this point so\n\n170\n00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,081\nI'm just seeing that one adapter.\n\n171\n00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:59,274\n>> Right.\n>> You can use pipelining to say,\n\n172\n00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:01,005\ntake that one adapter and\n\n173\n00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:06,619\npipe it into another command to modify\nsomething like whether DHCP is turned on.\n\n174\n00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,391\nOr not.\n\n175\n00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:10,998\nI do this because it means I don't\nhave to remember interface indexes,\n\n176\n00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:14,820\nI don't have to query to get it,\nit just kinda rolls it all into one.\n\n177\n00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,240\nGet this adapter, and take this action.\n\n178\n00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,561\nAnd the action I'm gonna\ntake is to disable DHCP.\n\n179\n00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:27,618\nSo I'll say Set-NetIPInterface\n-DHCP Disabled,\n\n180\n00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:33,900\nlike that, and\nthat's going to turn off DHCP.\n\n181\n00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,665\nNow, I got a permission denied message,\nbecause I didn't run my\n\n182\n00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:41,120\nPowerShell as an administrator,\nso it's a little mad at me here.\n\n183\n00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,750\nSo that's what that's error is all about.\n\n184\n00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,500\nSomewhere in here it'll say,\npermission denied.\n\n185\n00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,510\nI mean, you get access denied right there.\n\n186\n00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,515\nBut what I'll do is, I'll just copy\nthat because I'm a lazy typer.\n\n187\n00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,753\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'll open up a new PowerShell\n\n188\n00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:55,100\nwindow, and\nthis time I will run it as administrator.\n\n189\n00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,020\nThere we go.\n\n190\n00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,580\nAnd we'll just repeat the same thing.\n\n191\n00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,970\nAnd we'll run it, and that's gonna\ndisable DHCP on that interface.\n\n192\n00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,676\nNow, I didn't assign a static IP,\nor did I?\n\n193\n00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:07,100\n>> No.\n\n194\n00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,930\nI don't think so.\n\n195\n00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,725\nNo.\n>> I don't remember now.\n\n196\n00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:09,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n197\n00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,560\nat this point I technically\ndon't have an IP address,\n\n198\n00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,100\nwhich is not a great place the be.\n\n199\n00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,190\n>> Right.\n\n200\n00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,948\n>> That is one way to run\na command on an adapter.\n\n201\n00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:22,270\nI use Get-NetAdapter to get the adapter,\nto find out which\n\n202\n00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,230\nnick I want it to modify, and then I pipe\nthat into the command that modified it.\n\n203\n00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,080\nAll right.\n\n204\n00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,440\nI didn't have to do it that way.\n\n205\n00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,520\nI could have rolled it all together\ninto one command if I wanted to, or\n\n206\n00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,670\nI could have used the interface\nindex number, right?\n\n207\n00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,950\nSo we;ve got different choices\nbased on what we want to achieve.\n\n208\n00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,130\nSo let me show you another\nway to go about that.\n\n209\n00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:46,770\nWe could say, for example,\non Set-NetIPInterface,\n\n210\n00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,180\nif I do the Get-Help for it.\n\n211\n00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,910\nWhoops.\n\n212\n00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,260\nIf I would be a little more\npatient with my tab auto complete.\n\n213\n00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,360\nNo, there are too many net commands for\nme to try that.\n\n214\n00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,814\nThere we go.\n\n215\n00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:02,774\n[LAUGH] Sometimes it is faster\nto type the command out, but\n\n216\n00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:08,467\nif you look at all the different things\nthat you can do with Set-NetIPInterface,\n\n217\n00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:13,362\nyou'll see that it's got\n-Interfacealias and -InterfaceIndex.\n\n218\n00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:18,571\nSo I could have taken\nthis command that I ran,\n\n219\n00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:23,919\nI could've collapsed\nthat into one command,\n\n220\n00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:30,250\nwhere I said -InterfaceIndex\n12 -DHCP Disabled.\n\n221\n00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,090\nIt's the exact same command,\nit's gonna do the same thing.\n\n222\n00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,450\nIt's going to reach out to whatever\nnetwork adapter is interface 12, and\n\n223\n00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,100\nit's gonna disable DHCP, all right?\n\n224\n00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,080\nThe only advantage here is,\nif I'm sitting at a new computer and\n\n225\n00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,720\nI know what that network adapter is\ncalled, I can do this command without\n\n226\n00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,645\nhaving to query what the interface\nindexes are, and all that stuff.\n\n227\n00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:50,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's easier and\n\n228\n00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,700\nthat's the way that I normally do it.\n\n229\n00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,070\nBut technically, the second command\nis shorter and does the same thing.\n\n230\n00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,448\nAssuming I don't have any typos,\nit should do the same thing.\n\n231\n00:10:58,448 --> 00:10:59,708\nThere we go.\n\n232\n00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n233\n00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,089\nSo now that I've turned off DHCP,\nI probably need to set an IP address,\n\n234\n00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,070\nright, Mike?\n\n235\n00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,620\n>> Right.\n\n236\n00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620\nYep.\n\n237\n00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,400\nYeah, I'm gonna say that's gonna make\nit a little bit easier to communicate\n\n238\n00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,035\nwith that computer over the network,\nright?\n\n239\n00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:13,810\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's funny how IP works, isn't it?\n\n240\n00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n241\n00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,550\nso let's say we wanna do that.\n\n242\n00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:23,110\nAnd we can use the Set-NetIPInterface,\nor I'm sorry, New-NetIPAddress.\n\n243\n00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,030\nWe actually have a different command for\nthat one.\n\n244\n00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,740\nIt does get a little confusing, whether\nyou have set commands, or new commands,\n\n245\n00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,670\nor whatever.\n\n246\n00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,760\nBut what happens is IPv6\nchanged a lot of things.\n\n247\n00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,540\nIt used to be that,\nwhen you had a network adaptor,\n\n248\n00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,720\nyou usually only have one IP address\non it, and that was about it.\n\n249\n00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,180\nWell, you could have more than one.\n\n250\n00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,990\nBut you normally just have one address.\n\n251\n00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,510\nWell with IPv6, you almost always\nhave more than one address.\n\n252\n00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,170\nAnd so, instead of making it\nwhere there's a set command,\n\n253\n00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,680\nlike you're setting one address,\nnow you have a new command.\n\n254\n00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,307\nYou say, new IP address, you're actually\nattaching an IP address to the interface,\n\n255\n00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:01,720\nand then you can remove\nold ones if you need to.\n\n256\n00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,860\nSo you get that flexibility.\n\n257\n00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,210\nIt's all built around having\nmore than one address.\n\n258\n00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,590\nAll right, so\nlet's say that I want to assign one.\n\n259\n00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,270\nRight?\n\n260\n00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,170\nWell, this command can get a little bit\nlong, so let me change my window here so\n\n261\n00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,335\nit's not, I don't want my\nhead to cover up the command.\n\n262\n00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll just clear that out.\n\n263\n00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,940\nAll right.\n\n264\n00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,440\nSo, if I want to assign an IP address,\nin the show notes I put like\n\n265\n00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,158\nthree different ways that you can do it,\nbut let me just show you one of the ways\n\n266\n00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:30,040\nthat's probably the most detailed,\nbecause it helps with IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n267\n00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,182\nBasically, what we can do is, we can come\nin and we can say, New-NetIPAddress.\n\n268\n00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:39,240\nAll right, so\nwe're creating a new IP address.\n\n269\n00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,020\nI can then tell it the interface\nthat it's going to be on, and\n\n270\n00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,470\nI could say, the interface alias,\nand point to the name.\n\n271\n00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,236\nOr I could say InterfaceIndex,\nif I know the index number, minus 12.\n\n272\n00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:54,980\nSo, either way, and that's why there's\nmore than one in the show notes.\n\n273\n00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,560\nAnd then we say the address family.\n\n274\n00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,240\nNow, this is really important.\n\n275\n00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,370\nThe address family is gonna tell it\nwhether we're doing IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n276\n00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,030\nSo, in our newer operating systems,\nWindows Vista and higher,\n\n277\n00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,710\nWindows Server 2008 and higher,\nIPv6 is enabled by default.\n\n278\n00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,920\nBut not only that,\nit's preferred over IPv4.\n\n279\n00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,600\nSo you gotta specify whether\nyou're doing IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n280\n00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,890\nAll right, we follow that up with\nthe address that we're attaching.\n\n281\n00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,240\nSo I'll just say, IPAddress, and\nthen what address I want it to have.\n\n282\n00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,712\nI'll do, what would be a safe address?\n\n283\n00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:32,162\nWe'll do 192.168.29.3, all right,\n\n284\n00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:34,730\nso that's the address that\nI'm going to attach to it.\n\n285\n00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,090\nNow, you might be tempted to stop there,\nbut there's actually a little more\n\n286\n00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,204\ninformation we need to provide,\nfor example, the subnet mask.\n\n287\n00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:43,340\n>> Yeah, right.\nThink about your TCP/IP properties,\n\n288\n00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,040\nif you go in there and\n\n289\n00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,350\nconfigure that through the GUI,\nyou still gotta configure your IP address,\n\n290\n00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,980\nyour subnet mask, your default gateway,\nand a couple of other things.\n\n291\n00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,550\nWe're gonna need DNS servers, as well.\n\n292\n00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,875\n>> Yep.\nSo we're gonna specify that.\n\n293\n00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,660\nNow, this is tricky, because for\nall of these years in the GUI,\n\n294\n00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,930\nhow does Microsoft ask us\nto put in the subnet mask?\n\n295\n00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,080\n255.255.255.0, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n296\n00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,370\n>> Yeah, that 32 bit dotted decimal\nnotation is kind of what we're used to.\n\n297\n00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,220\nBut here in the PowerShell,\nthat's not what they want.\n\n298\n00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,720\nNow they want what's\ncalled a prefix length.\n\n299\n00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,368\nAnd the reason they switched to this is,\n\n300\n00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:19,040\nthe old dotted decimal notation\nreally doesn't work for IPv6.\n\n301\n00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,185\nYou end up with these massive numbers.\n\n302\n00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:23,440\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n>> So, they switched to the prefix model.\n\n303\n00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,063\nAnd the prefix model just says,\nhow many bits are in the subnet mask?\n\n304\n00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:28,666\n>> Yeah, how many ones do you have?\n\n305\n00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,955\nEasy enough.\n\n306\n00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:31,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n307\n00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,536\n>> So if we're doing, like,\n\n308\n00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:36,440\na 255.255.255.0, that's like a class C\nsubnet mask, you know, what we'd expect.\n\n309\n00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,290\nOr they'll sometimes call it a 24-bit\nsubnet mask, cuz there's 24 ones in it.\n\n310\n00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,000\nSo, when I come in here and\nI specify that prefix length, so\n\n311\n00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,580\nI'll say prefix length 24, and\nI screen wrapped there, but\n\n312\n00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,900\nprefix length 24,\nthat's telling it 255.255.255.0.\n\n313\n00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,188\nJust for your own reference,\na class A, 255.000,\n\n314\n00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,784\nthat would be an 8-bit prefix length,\n\n315\n00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:06,590\na class B is a 16-bit,\nand a class C is a 24-bit.\n\n316\n00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,170\nAll right, so there's my prefix length,\nI've got that set.\n\n317\n00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,300\nI do need a little more.\n\n318\n00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,160\nAnd again,\nthis is tying into that whole IPv6 thing.\n\n319\n00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,090\nWith IPv6, you can have addresses\nthat are link local or unicast.\n\n320\n00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,850\nThere's all sorts of variations.\n\n321\n00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,750\nAnd so in IPv4,\nI need to tell it that my type is unicast,\n\n322\n00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,400\nand that's actually the default.\n\n323\n00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,980\nI could leave that off, but I wanted to\nput it here, so you guys are aware of it.\n\n324\n00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,920\nEspecially for\nthose of you that are assigning IPv6.\n\n325\n00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,290\nAnd, am I done?\n\n326\n00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,020\nOh, nope.\n\n327\n00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,679\n>> Last but not least.\n\n328\n00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,330\n>> Something important.\n>> Yeah, we got that default gateway,\n\n329\n00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,670\nif we wanna get off of our subnet.\n\n330\n00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,090\n>> Yeah, you don't have to have a default\ngateway, I could have left this off.\n\n331\n00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,660\n>> Right.\n\n332\n00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,301\n>> But if you want a route between\nmore than that one network,\n\n333\n00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,050\nyou're going to need it.\n\n334\n00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,650\nSo, it's almost a given\nthat we're gonna have it.\n\n335\n00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,650\nAnd so I'll punch in my default gateway,\nwhich is I believe .2 on this network.\n\n336\n00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,340\nAll right.\n\n337\n00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,270\nSo, everything that I've specified here\n\n338\n00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,170\nis what we'd normally\nspecify in an adapter, right?\n\n339\n00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,970\nOur IP address, our subnet mask,\nand our default gateway.\n\n340\n00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,411\nI used InterfaceIndex to reference it.\n\n341\n00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:06,165\nI could have said Interfacealias, or\nI could have done the Get-NetAdapter,\n\n342\n00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:10,208\nand type that output into the new\nnet IP address and left that part.\n\n343\n00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,082\nPart off, right?\n\n344\n00:16:11,082 --> 00:16:12,666\nThose are the three different\nways that I could have done this.\n\n345\n00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:17,422\nI'm gonna run it and I can see that\napparently I already have that IP address,\n\n346\n00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:19,776\nso let's pick something different.\n\n347\n00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:24,625\nI must already be .3, so let's go to .33.\n\n348\n00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:30,495\nAnd I already have a default gateway,\nis what it's complaining about now.\n\n349\n00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:32,725\nYou can only have one default gateway, and\n\n350\n00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:38,155\nwhen you use the new command,\nit's not replacing, it's adding to it.\n\n351\n00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:41,588\nSo I've already got a default gateway,\nso I just need to remove that.\n\n352\n00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:46,500\nAnd actually it probably did add .33,\noh no it didn't, there we go, so\n\n353\n00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,690\nit went ahead and added it.\n\n354\n00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,651\nSo now I've got .33,\nbut it was a new IP so\n\n355\n00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:57,990\nit's actually in addition to the IP's\nthat I might have already had.\n\n356\n00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,834\nSo if I do a get-net,\nI keep doing tab autocomplete on that, and\n\n357\n00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:07,360\nthere's just so\nmany ones that start with net, all right.\n\n358\n00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,270\nSo if I look here I can see all\nthe different IP addresses that I have and\n\n359\n00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,190\nsure enough I do have 192.168.29.3,\nand there's .33, so\n\n360\n00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,170\nI got that one added, and\nI probably have few others.\n\n361\n00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,630\nThere's my IPv6 loop back and stuff.\n\n362\n00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,060\nSo, you'll see these different IPv6 and\nIPv4 addresses and so on all in here.\n\n363\n00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,810\nSo, the new command did exactly what\nit said and created the new address.\n\n364\n00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,690\nIf we wanted to remove it, let's see,\nis this one, is it remove or is it delete?\n\n365\n00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,500\nHere, we'll do a quick query on this one.\n\n366\n00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,660\nI always get confused on this one where,\nthere it is, remove.\n\n367\n00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,070\nSometimes it's removed,\nsometimes it's delete.\n\n368\n00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,910\nThey have different terminology.\n\n369\n00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,850\nBut I can come back and\n\n370\n00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,790\nI can do remove-net IP address to remove\nthat .3 if I don't want that one on there.\n\n371\n00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:03,324\nAnd I can actually come in here and take\nmy old command and modify it a little bit\n\n372\n00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:09,770\nto say, I could probably leave that off\nbut I'll just leave it on there for now.\n\n373\n00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,350\nSo I'm gonna change this so\nmy syntax will read,\n\n374\n00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:17,656\nremove dash netipaddress from interface\nindex 12 address family IPv4.\n\n375\n00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:22,410\nThe address is 192.168.29.3,\nwe're gonna remove it,\n\n376\n00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,280\nit's just asking me to verify,\nI'll say yes.\n\n377\n00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,350\nAnd it's asking me to double\nsuper secret provision verify.\n\n378\n00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,410\nThere we go.\n\n379\n00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,781\nAnd so we'll remove that, and\nnow I just have the one IP address.\n\n380\n00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:42,365\nAnd I can do the get-netipaddress and\nI can verify that it's gone from there.\n\n381\n00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:43,860\nAnd I don't see it in my list there.\n\n382\n00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,402\nAnd actually,\n\n383\n00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:50,340\nif we pump that through format table\nit's a little bit easier to see.\n\n384\n00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,999\nSo I just ran get-netipaddress and\nI pipe that into the format-table command,\n\n385\n00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:56,448\nwhich has an alias of ft.\n\n386\n00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:58,410\nAnd that way I can just see\nall the addresses right there.\n\n387\n00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,190\nSo, I can see that .3 is now gone and\nwe're good and clear.\n\n388\n00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,160\nSo, let me just pull up\nmy history real quick.\n\n389\n00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,640\nSo looking at my get history you'll\nsee that that new -netip address,\n\n390\n00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,470\nthat's how we added that\naddress to our system.\n\n391\n00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,070\nAnd then I follow that up with the remove\n-net IP address to get rid of the address\n\n392\n00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,950\nthat I had from before.\n\n393\n00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,130\n>> They are real good commands,\nI don't know about you, I find that\n\n394\n00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,190\ntypically going through the GUI's\na little bit faster with this process.\n\n395\n00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,097\nWith the power shell, it's a pretty\nlong command just to set my IP address,\n\n396\n00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:35,127\nbut there still, you've got to know\nthem because if you're working with that\n\n397\n00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:37,531\nserver core you don't have that GUI,\nright?\n\n398\n00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:38,991\nAnd so\nthat's where this really comes into play,\n\n399\n00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:40,400\nit's not something i'm\never gonna automate.\n\n400\n00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,710\nI'm not gonna script this,\n\n401\n00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,060\nthere's too many things in there that are\nspecific to that machine that i'm setting.\n\n402\n00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,350\nSo it really doesn't make for a good\nscript, or something i'm gonna automate.\n\n403\n00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,304\nBut as you're setting up those new\nserver cores to get your network going,\n\n404\n00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,531\nthat's when these commands\nare really gonna come in handy.\n\n405\n00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:59,304\n>> All right now there's a lot of times\nwhere I stop right here and said I'm done,\n\n406\n00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:02,800\nI got my IP address, got my default\ngateway, I'm done I walk away.\n\n407\n00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,280\n>> Easy one to forget right here,\nisn't it?\n\n408\n00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,325\n>> And\nthen stuff isn't quite working right.\n\n409\n00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:07,600\n>> Why can't I join into the domain?\n\n410\n00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,770\nWhy is it telling me I can't\nfind the domain controller?\n\n411\n00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,080\nIt's on the same network,\nit's got the damn right IP address.\n\n412\n00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,200\n>> It's funniest thing cuz\nthat's exactly how it goes down.\n\n413\n00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,050\n>> I know.\n[LAUGH] >> It's always joining the domain.\n\n414\n00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,960\n>> Yeah.\n\n415\n00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,530\n>> DNS servers, right?\n\n416\n00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,900\nWhen we're in the GUI, you see little\nDNS fields right there beneath the IP.\n\n417\n00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,880\nThose are optional,\nyou don't have to have them.\n\n418\n00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,330\nBut if you don't, you are gonna have\na hard time doing a lot of things,\n\n419\n00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,750\nlike joining a domain.\n\n420\n00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,650\nSo we probably want to\nassign some DNS servers,\n\n421\n00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,420\ndomain lookup servers to\nbe able to do that, right?\n\n422\n00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,390\nSo simple command for this one, we can\nadd them in, and we'll be in business.\n\n423\n00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,820\nSo, for this one if we go back to our\nPowerShell, the command we're looking for\n\n424\n00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,280\nis set-dns\n>> It's a long one.\n\n425\n00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,740\n>> Client,\nI'm gonna use my tab auto-complete, there.\n\n426\n00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,000\nDNS client server address.\n\n427\n00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,770\nThere we go, so\nset-dnsclientserveraddress, and\n\n428\n00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,150\nthis is where we can assign those\nname servers to our system,\n\n429\n00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,638\nso it will be able to do name look-ups.\n\n430\n00:20:58,638 --> 00:20:59,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n431\n00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,324\nYeah, just first thing that's gonna\nhappen is you're going to go through and\n\n432\n00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:04,615\nyou're going to set your TCP IP\nsettings on that server core.\n\n433\n00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:08,342\nYou're gonna try to join into the domain,\nand remember it's gotta do a DNS look-up\n\n434\n00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:10,600\nto find,\nit knows the name of the main controller,\n\n435\n00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,190\nit's gotta find that IP address and it\nneeds DNS to do that so you're gonna fail.\n\n436\n00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,030\nAnd so you gotta come back and run this\nand it's non-showing, it's the same thing,\n\n437\n00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,570\nyou do your set-DNS client server address,\n\n438\n00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,080\nspecify which network adapter you're\ntrying to et these properties on,\n\n439\n00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,180\nand then it's just -server addresses and\nyou can list out multiple.\n\n440\n00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,260\nJust like you can in the GUI,\nyou've got your preferred, your alternate.\n\n441\n00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,270\nYou can even go to that DNS tab, and\nyou can list several alternates.\n\n442\n00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,100\nHere you're just gonna\nseparate them with commas.\n\n443\n00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,330\n>> And that's the part I always forget so\nI was waiting for you to say that.\n\n444\n00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, yep, so\n\n445\n00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,340\nyou just separated them with commas,\nlike I knew that all along.\n\n446\n00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,116\nI always forget and then I just end up\njust sending one DNS server cuz I'm like\n\n447\n00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:50,306\nscrew it, I can't remember,\nare there spaces or semicolons?\n\n448\n00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:52,100\nAll right so it'll be commas.\n\n449\n00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,410\nSo, I'll go and set my own server's a DNS\nservers, so I'll put 192.168.29.33 and\n\n450\n00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,830\nthen maybe as my back up\nI'll just put Google.\n\n451\n00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,745\nOr somebody,\nyou know some open DNS server.\n\n452\n00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:03,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n453\n00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,730\n>> And so I'll punch that in there.\n\n454\n00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,698\nNow I've got my DNS server set up and\nI can do my look up.\n\n455\n00:22:07,698 --> 00:22:10,259\nSo now this machine is ready\nto go to join the domain or\n\n456\n00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,940\ndo the other things that we need to,\nit's got that stuff assigned.\n\n457\n00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,340\nAnd we can go our get-netip address or\nget-DNS client server.\n\n458\n00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,520\nYou can start to pull a lot\nof that information back and\n\n459\n00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,490\nsee actually, let's see.\n\n460\n00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:28,760\nThere we go.\n\n461\n00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,030\nSo we can start to pull it up and\nsee what servers are attached.\n\n462\n00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,950\nNow be careful, remember with the IP\naddress, we did new-net IP address,\n\n463\n00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,220\nand that added an address, but\ndidn't remove what we already had.\n\n464\n00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,470\nWell, this is a set command.\n\n465\n00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,680\nAnd with set commands they do replace, so\n\n466\n00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,790\nI replaced whatever DNS\nservers that I had before.\n\n467\n00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,160\nSo it's kind of over written those,\nbut it is assigned and\n\n468\n00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,320\nI assign those to my LAN interface.\n\n469\n00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,860\nAnd you'll see my\nISATAP Tunnel follow that but.\n\n470\n00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,340\nAnd there we go.\n\n471\n00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,170\nSo, getting an IP address assigned,\ngetting DNS, pretty straightforward.\n\n472\n00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,550\nAll right, well, in this segment,\n\n473\n00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,250\nwe got a chance to see working with our\nnetwork adapters via the PowerShell.\n\n474\n00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,250\nWe saw assigning an IP address and\nsubnet mask and we got a chance to take\n\n475\n00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,640\na look assigning a name look up server so\nwe can actually do real work.\n\n476\n00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,850\nI hope you guys enjoyed that, stay tuned,\nwe have more PowerShell coming up,\n\n477\n00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,400\nespecially we have a firewall episode,\n\n478\n00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,800\ncuz that's the normally the next\nprocedure here, is we go in and\n\n479\n00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,900\nset our firewall settings to make sure we\ncan actually get to the daggum server.\n\n480\n00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,156\nBut those are coming up, so stay tuned for\nthat, and we'll be back after this.\n\n481\n00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:39,920\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:08,099\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,663\nIn this segment we're gonna take a look\nat managing background services using\n\n3\n00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:13,650\nthe Microsoft PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,610\nOn any server, and really on your\nworkstations too, there's a number\n\n5\n00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,290\nof services that are running in the\nbackground that we may need to manipulate,\n\n6\n00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,010\nand they might be the ones that\nare built into Windows that came\n\n7\n00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,290\nwith the operating system.\n\n8\n00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,300\nWhen they might be third party\nwants that we've added on.\n\n9\n00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,620\nEither way,\nwe can manage them with the PowerShell and\n\n10\n00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,850\nthat's really useful if you're trying to\nscript and automate certain activities.\n\n11\n00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,550\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Now for the most part,\n\n12\n00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,750\ntypically you're just gonna be looking for\na broken services and starting them again.\n\n13\n00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,490\nThere's some typical really rudimentary\nthings that everybody does.\n\n14\n00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,930\nI wanna start with those commands.\n\n15\n00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,630\nAnd then we'll move into some\nof the more advanced things.\n\n16\n00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,310\nI will say this, just right off the bat,\nMicrosoft did not spend a lot of\n\n17\n00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,620\ntime adding a bunch of service\nfunctionality into the PowerShell.\n\n18\n00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,530\nSo, some of things we see here will\nrequire us to get a little bit\n\n19\n00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,910\ncreate with how we use\nthe PowerShell to work with it.\n\n20\n00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,600\nLet's start with a real simple one which\nis simply getting a list of our services,\n\n21\n00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,871\nand as you'd think the command\nis just get-services.\n\n22\n00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:08,390\n>> Pretty straight forward.\n\n23\n00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,600\n>> Sorry.\nIt's get-service, it's not plural.\n\n24\n00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,410\nThere we go.\n\n25\n00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,500\nSo if we get that service, we get a list\nof services that are available and\n\n26\n00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,340\nthere's a bunch of to them.\n\n27\n00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,260\nAnd this is the equivalent of going\nto that control panel item right, or\n\n28\n00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,300\nadministrative tool, if I were to go into,\napparently I'm spelling challenged today.\n\n29\n00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,010\nBut if I go into the services\nadministrative tool, I get this list of\n\n30\n00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,211\nall the services that are on my system and\nthe ones that are running, and so on.\n\n31\n00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:35,560\nIf I went back,\nhere that's exactly what I'm seeing too.\n\n32\n00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,600\nOne of the nice things about this though\nis that, it does display the service name\n\n33\n00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,530\nbut those names might not be\nwhat you're familiar with.\n\n34\n00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,110\nThat's because every\nservice has two names.\n\n35\n00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,800\nYou have a service name and\na display name.\n\n36\n00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,680\nI'm seeing the service name here.\n\n37\n00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,740\nFollowed by that display name.\n\n38\n00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,660\nSo there might be a service\nthat I'm really used to,\n\n39\n00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,490\nlike the DNS client, right?\n\n40\n00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,200\nAnd so\nthat's what I'm used to seeing it as,\n\n41\n00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,750\nand in the administrative\ntool that's what it shows up.\n\n42\n00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,490\nBut you'll see here, there's a service\nname attached to it, Dnscache.\n\n43\n00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,340\nAs we work with the services,\na lot of times we're expected to\n\n44\n00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,150\nknow the actual service name and\nnot the display name, and so\n\n45\n00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,630\nthat's something we'll have to kind of\ncompete against as we work with this.\n\n46\n00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,320\n>> Okay,\nwell that makes it a little challenging.\n\n47\n00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,070\n>> All right so,\ngetting a list of services, that's great.\n\n48\n00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,170\nNow I know what's going on on my system.\n\n49\n00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,690\nI might want to filter that a bit.\n\n50\n00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,860\nI know Mike when I told you we were\ngonna film this show, Mike said yeah,\n\n51\n00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,465\nwe really need to have one more that\njust shows like running services.\n\n52\n00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:30,550\n>> Mm-hm, right.\n\n53\n00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,255\n>> Or maybe even ones that aren't running.\n\n54\n00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n55\n00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,030\nIt is nice to be able to\nfilter that list down and\n\n56\n00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,260\nfind exactly what you're looking for.\n\n57\n00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,870\nI need to know, is this service running,\n\n58\n00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,890\nor which services are actually\nrunning on my machine?\n\n59\n00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,400\nCuz that list can get a little long.\n\n60\n00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,500\n>> It can get really long.\n\n61\n00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,760\nEspecially on systems where you've\ninstalled a lot of software.\n\n62\n00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,110\nYou see this on workstations more.\n\n63\n00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,990\nServers are normally pretty clean.\n\n64\n00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,190\nBut just like any PowerShell command,\nwe can use sort object.\n\n65\n00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,210\nAnd Where-Object to change that,\n\n66\n00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,050\nright, Sort-Object lets us just arrange\nthe way that things are being ordered on\n\n67\n00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,150\nthe screen, and\nWhere-Object will let us filter it.\n\n68\n00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,085\nSo, if I take Get-Service and I'm just\ngoing to pipe that commands output into\n\n69\n00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:10,460\nSort-object, and\nwe can tell it what we want to sort by.\n\n70\n00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,500\nYou can sort by any of these\ndifferent columns over here.\n\n71\n00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,880\nI'm going to sort it by status.\n\n72\n00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,670\nWhen I run that, it's going to sort it.\n\n73\n00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,900\nSo now, I've got all of my running\nservices right here at the bottom.\n\n74\n00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,880\nI've got my stopped ones\nthat are above that.\n\n75\n00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,450\nSo I can see each of those.\n\n76\n00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,970\nAnd they're just in the list.\n\n77\n00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,130\nThere they are.\n\n78\n00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,990\nIt's very, very exciting.\n\n79\n00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,560\nIt's not terribly exciting.\n\n80\n00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,450\nNow, I might want to use something like\nWhere-object to tell it only to show me\n\n81\n00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,470\nthe stopped services, or\njust show me the running services.\n\n82\n00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,580\nSo we can filter beyond that if we want\nto, so I can get rid of sort object.\n\n83\n00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,225\nAnd I can change that.\n\n84\n00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,672\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n85\n00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:46,560\n>> Now, Where-object the syntax is\nalways a little weird on this one.\n\n86\n00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,955\n>> It's a little goofy, isn't it?\n\n87\n00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:50,960\n>> Cuz what you have to do, you have\nto call that variable that represents\n\n88\n00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,080\nthe output of the first commands\npart of our pipe lining.\n\n89\n00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,595\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you watched our pipe lining episode,\n\n90\n00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:55,610\nyou already know about this.\n\n91\n00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,645\nBut-\n>> Because really treating that list,\n\n92\n00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:00,070\nGet-Services, returning a list\nof all the services, and\n\n93\n00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,610\nit's treating it like an object.\n\n94\n00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,108\nAnd then that object is that $_.\n\n95\n00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:09,800\nWhich is referring to the object in the\nprevious command in the pipeline spit out.\n\n96\n00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,450\nAnd then you can call different variables,\nor different properties of that object.\n\n97\n00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,220\nIn this case,\nI think you're gonna use the status.\n\n98\n00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,797\n>> Yup, so\nwe're just gonna take a look at that, and\n\n99\n00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:19,539\nthat's exactly what that\ncommand is saying, right?\n\n100\n00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:24,219\nIs look at the output from our first\ncommand $_, and inside of that output,\n\n101\n00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,390\nlook for the status value in there.\n\n102\n00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,830\nSo we want to find the status.\n\n103\n00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,400\nAnd I'm gonna say where\nthat is equal to stopped.\n\n104\n00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,480\nI'm gonna put it in quotes, I don't think\nI actually have to, but I'm going to.\n\n105\n00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,300\nIf there's spaces,\nobviously you do need that.\n\n106\n00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,670\nBut I'll just do it like that.\n\n107\n00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,560\n>> Sometimes if it's a string, sometimes\nyou gotta out those darn quotes around it.\n\n108\n00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,830\n>> So I'm just saying,\nshow me anybody whose status is stopped.\n\n109\n00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,410\nAnd there we go,\nI get my list of the stopped status.\n\n110\n00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,810\nStop services and no running services.\n\n111\n00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,120\nThe running services are left out and\nthat's that.\n\n112\n00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,155\nOr if I'm just looking for a particular\nservice, I could always just do\n\n113\n00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:03,120\nGet-Service, maybe I'm looking for\nthe computer browser service.\n\n114\n00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,440\nI might come in here and say Get-Service\nbrowser, right, and there it is.\n\n115\n00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,340\nNow, the problem comes in with that name.\n\n116\n00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,740\nIf I do Get-Service and\nthen I put in, if I spell it right,\n\n117\n00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,750\nif I put in \"Computer Browser\", and\nsee how I'm putting it in quotes, it does\n\n118\n00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,590\nreturn it back, it returns both with\nthe display name or with the actual name.\n\n119\n00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,530\nThere can be some problems\nwith that sometimes,\n\n120\n00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,370\nsome of the names don't quite return or\nyou might just not know the names exactly,\n\n121\n00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:41,555\nand so you can use wildcards in this, I\ncould do like Get-Service br*, like that.\n\n122\n00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:45,375\nAnd that's gonna show me anyone that has\nbr, so it will find browser and broker,\n\n123\n00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,305\nand so each of those are kinda\nturning up in different ways.\n\n124\n00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,195\n>> That's really handy,\n\n125\n00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:50,245\nespecially when you don't know\nthe actual what it calls it.\n\n126\n00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:54,765\nBecause as you saw in that previous little\ndemonstration there, that the display name\n\n127\n00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:57,605\nand the name of the actual server\nsometimes don't match up very nicely.\n\n128\n00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:00,645\n>> And there's more information then\nwhat's being displayed on the screen,\n\n129\n00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:02,790\nI know we've seen that\nin other segments too.\n\n130\n00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,220\nBut like if I do Get-Service\n\"Computer browser\",\n\n131\n00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,750\nit's just showing status names and\ndisplay names.\n\n132\n00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,240\nBut if I add a little bit more to that,\n\n133\n00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,910\nlike if I type that through,\nwe'll do Format-List, right?\n\n134\n00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,990\nYou can see there's name,\ndisplay name and status, but\n\n135\n00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,010\nthere's also Dependent services,\nthe services that we depend on.\n\n136\n00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,100\nWhether it can shut down,\nwhether it can stop, whether it can pause.\n\n137\n00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,750\nNot every service can pause.\n\n138\n00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,260\nAnd then what the service type is.\n\n139\n00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,590\nSo you see some additional information.\n\n140\n00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,550\nBut here's where we start to bump\ninto some of the real problems.,\n\n141\n00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,940\nMicrosoft didn't add\nall of the information.\n\n142\n00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,190\nSo there's a lot of stuff like that.\n\n143\n00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,180\nRecovery options that don't show up here.\n\n144\n00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,430\nOur user credentials, right?\n\n145\n00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,830\nWhat user account is this\nservice gonna run as.\n\n146\n00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,380\nIt doesn't show up in here, right?\n\n147\n00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,280\nSo we don't get all the information,\n\n148\n00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,900\nwe want and that's because power\nshell is still an evolving product.\n\n149\n00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,550\nMicrosoft is adding more and\nmore to it over time.\n\n150\n00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,770\nThere are limits to what we can do and\nas a result,\n\n151\n00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,650\nmost people are really only\ngonna use PowerShell to stop,\n\n152\n00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,730\nstart, and restart services and\nthat's about it.\n\n153\n00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,980\nWell, fortunately those\ncommands are really easy.\n\n154\n00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,510\nYou've got Stop-Service and\nthen the service that you want to stop.\n\n155\n00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,060\nSo if I want to stop the browser,\nI can stop it.\n\n156\n00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,720\nWhich I guess it was already stopped so\nthat wasn't too exciting.\n\n157\n00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,270\nI can start the service, so\nI can start it up and it'll run.\n\n158\n00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,690\nNow mine,\nit says it can't start because, why?\n\n159\n00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,430\nWhat's its problem?\n\n160\n00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,240\nI've got an error.\n\n161\n00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,830\nService command exception.\n\n162\n00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,440\nJust says it doesn't wanna start.\n\n163\n00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,410\nProbably because I've got\nfile sharing turned off.\n\n164\n00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,830\nThe-\n>> Right.\n\n165\n00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,970\n>> When it asked me what network I was on,\nI probably chose public.\n\n166\n00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,820\nBad habit that, but we could actually\njust double check that over here, and\n\n167\n00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,170\ncheck the computer browser service,\nand see if we.\n\n168\n00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,120\nOh, it won't start because it's disabled.\n\n169\n00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,871\nThere's another new one.\n\n170\n00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:52,633\nNotice that the startup type\ndidn't show up earlier.\n\n171\n00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:55,518\nIt didn't tell me that this was set\nto disabled or manual or automatic,\n\n172\n00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,348\nI didn't see that.\n\n173\n00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:59,169\nIt' another limitation so\nif I change that.\n\n174\n00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,130\nWe'll just change to manual.\n\n175\n00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,850\nWe'll do that via PowerShell\nhere in a minute.\n\n176\n00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,540\nBut I'll just do it via GUI,\nsince I'm in there.\n\n177\n00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,610\nAll right, so now if I try and\nstart that service up, there we go.\n\n178\n00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,100\nNow it actually started.\n\n179\n00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,540\nAnd if I do a Get-Service computer\nbrowser I can look at it and\n\n180\n00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,025\nI can see that it is actually running.\n\n181\n00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:18,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n182\n00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,910\nAnd another thing I like to do with some\nof those commands, cuz as we were talking\n\n183\n00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,020\nabout in that previous segment [COUGH]\nit doesn't show you any outfit, right?\n\n184\n00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,350\nSo if that command works you\ndon't see anything in return.\n\n185\n00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,500\nAnd then you can turn around and\n\n186\n00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,990\ndo another Get-Service to\nverify that it started.\n\n187\n00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,610\nYou could also add a -PassThru to the end\nof that stop or start service, and\n\n188\n00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,610\nit'll return information about that\nservice that you just ran that command on.\n\n189\n00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,530\nSo it just saves you from having to\ntype another command, I guess, but\n\n190\n00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,248\nyou're making your first\ncommand a little bit longer.\n\n191\n00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:51,180\nVideo stop service -PassThru\n>> There we go and it thinks.\n\n192\n00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,720\nThere we go and we actually get\nour little status message link so\n\n193\n00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,830\nit's waiting to stop.\n\n194\n00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,960\nThen we get our output then it's done.\n\n195\n00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,750\nAll right, now a lot of times it's not\nthat we want to just stop or just start.\n\n196\n00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,770\nWe normally wanna do both.\n\n197\n00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,331\nWe wanna restart a service, right.\n\n198\n00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:07,744\nMaybe something like a print spooler has\ngotten stuck, I know that happens a lot.\n\n199\n00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:08,292\n>> Every day.\n\n200\n00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:10,420\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n201\n00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,540\nyou might say Restart-Service and\nthen the name of that service.\n\n202\n00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,240\nSo I will do the spore.\n\n203\n00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,220\nAnd there it's going to go,\nit's going to restart.\n\n204\n00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,940\nAnd I don't get that output so\nwe'll add in the pass view like Mike said.\n\n205\n00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,680\nAnd won't get too much more output there.\n\n206\n00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,560\n>> Yeah.\nYou don't get to see it,\n\n207\n00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,800\nit stops then restarts and\nin the end the status us running.\n\n208\n00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,270\n>> All right, so that's it for\nreally the basic operations.\n\n209\n00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,050\nBut I don't want to stop there,\nnow as far as what Microsoft has given us,\n\n210\n00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,190\nthat is kind of the limit of\nwhat they really give us.\n\n211\n00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,370\nBut there are a few other\nthings that we can do.\n\n212\n00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,890\nActually, I'm leaving one thing out.\n\n213\n00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,470\nI mentioned how I couldn't see whether\nthis one was set to manually start or\n\n214\n00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,990\nautomatic start or whatever,\nI can't see it but I actually can set it.\n\n215\n00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,480\nWe can set that value.\n\n216\n00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400\nThe computer browser.\n\n217\n00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,090\nIt was set to disabled, and\nI switched it over to manual.\n\n218\n00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,440\nI did it via the GUI, but I could have\ndone that from the PowerShell here.\n\n219\n00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,245\nWe could have just said set-service right?\n\n220\n00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:10,385\nRemember when you see set that means\nwe're changing something that's existing.\n\n221\n00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:14,035\nSo I'm gonna change my browser service and\nI'll use\n\n222\n00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:19,840\nthe -startuptype value to manipulate\nwhat it's startup type is gonna be.\n\n223\n00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,080\nThere's three main startup types.\n\n224\n00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,190\nThere's manual, automatic, and disabled.\n\n225\n00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,380\nSo, I might wanna set this\none to automatic, and\n\n226\n00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,730\nif I jump back I can see that\nI'm set to manual right now.\n\n227\n00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,490\nIf I change that to automatic I can\njump back here and refresh this.\n\n228\n00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,022\nI can jump back here and\nattempt to refresh that.\n\n229\n00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:44,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, at some point, there we go.\n\n230\n00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,760\nAnd now I can see it\nswitched over to automatic.\n\n231\n00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,390\nAll right.\n\n232\n00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,520\nSo we can change that.\n\n233\n00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,190\nI can even put it back\nto disabled if I want.\n\n234\n00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,270\nAnd put that right back to\nhow it was before all right.\n\n235\n00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,810\nAnd I left it, did I leave it stopped?\n\n236\n00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,620\nI left it stopped.\n\n237\n00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,940\nSo we're kinda back where\nwe were in the beginning.\n\n238\n00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,750\nAll right but, what if I wanna do\nsomething a little more advanced?\n\n239\n00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,600\nAll right what if I wanna change\nthe user account that this runs as?\n\n240\n00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,000\nEvery service runs as\na particular user account.\n\n241\n00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,010\nAnd if you look at that GUI,\nhere we go, if we look at the GUI for\n\n242\n00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,070\ncomputer browser,\nif I were to double click on that and\n\n243\n00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,060\ngo to log on I can see it's set to\nlog on with a Local System Account.\n\n244\n00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,870\nA lot of your services are.\n\n245\n00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,460\nNot all of them are, though.\n\n246\n00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,846\nSometimes you'll have ones that log in\nas a user or as the system account.\n\n247\n00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:34,290\nOr something different.\n\n248\n00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,770\n>> A lot of times we want to change that,\nright,\n\n249\n00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,250\ncuz one of those accounts might\nhave too many permissions.\n\n250\n00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,140\nAnd that puts us at a risk because\nif that service gets compromised,\n\n251\n00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,390\nthen that attacker has\ntoo many permissions.\n\n252\n00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,400\nOr the account might not have enough\npermissions to do what you need it to do.\n\n253\n00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,510\nSo a lot of times we're creating now,\nespecially with 2012,\n\n254\n00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,820\nwe're creating those\nGroup Managed Service Accounts.\n\n255\n00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,070\nand I need to be able to go\nback to that service then and\n\n256\n00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,680\ntell it what account I\nwant it to run under.\n\n257\n00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,580\n>> Yeah and if we look at this one,\nlike I've got a little SQL server\n\n258\n00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,510\nrunning on here and it's running\nas a dedicated service account.\n\n259\n00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,080\nSo I can see, I've got an account\ncalled MSSQLserver right there.\n\n260\n00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,130\nThat's the credential that it runs as.\n\n261\n00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,410\nIf I want to change that,\n\n262\n00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,580\nthere's not really a great way\nto do it from the PowerShell.\n\n263\n00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,150\nBut, you can use the WMI or\nthe CIM to be able to tap in to do it.\n\n264\n00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,960\nThese are the other management\nfaces inside of Windows.\n\n265\n00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,100\nAnd in the PowerShell we actually\ndo have some commands that let us\n\n266\n00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,390\ninteract with those.\n\n267\n00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,210\nThese commands are gonna be much longer\nbecause we're basically having to\n\n268\n00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,120\ntell the power shell to reach\nout to a different system\n\n269\n00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,620\nto then manipulate the data\nwe want to manipulate.\n\n270\n00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,950\nOver time, Microsoft will add\nmore of these commands in and\n\n271\n00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,920\nwe won't have to do that anymore,\nbut for now we do.\n\n272\n00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,370\nAll right, so\nlet me show you an example of that.\n\n273\n00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,080\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say,\ninstead of executing a normal command.\n\n274\n00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,980\nAnd let me resize this so\nmy head won't cover up the full command.\n\n275\n00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,226\nBut instead of just typing in\na normal command, I'm going to do\n\n276\n00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:59,550\ninvoke-cim method.\n\n277\n00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,130\nI'm reaching into the CIM and\nhaving it do some work for me.\n\n278\n00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,830\nSo Microsoft does give us\nthe command to be able to do that,\n\n279\n00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,740\nit's just not directly for\nworking with our services.\n\n280\n00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,800\nAnd I'm gonna be doing a Change,\nand I'll put in my arguments here.\n\n281\n00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,570\nMy argument is I need\nto change my StartName.\n\n282\n00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,840\nStartName is the argument that\nsets who the user account is so\n\n283\n00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,920\nthat run as, whatever they call it,\nStartName for whatever reason.\n\n284\n00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,265\nI don't know necessarily the logic behind\nthat, [LAUGH] but it is what it's called.\n\n285\n00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:35,567\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'll set it to whatever I am, so\n\n286\n00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:40,940\nif I'm in a domain,\nITPROTV/dpezzet for example.\n\n287\n00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,670\nI'm gonna set that as my start name,\n\n288\n00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,500\nthat's the account that I\nwant this thing to start as.\n\n289\n00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,750\nI can then set my start password cuz\nit needs to know the password to use.\n\n290\n00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,790\nAnd I'll put in whatever\nthat happens to be.\n\n291\n00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,500\nNow you guys know my password.\n\n292\n00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,490\n>> Oh No! [LAUGH] >> So I'll punch\nthat one in and now it knows what\n\n293\n00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,650\nwe want to change but we haven't told it\nwhat service we want to change it for.\n\n294\n00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,140\nAnd here's where things get hard\nbecause we have to do a CIM query.\n\n295\n00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,000\nAnd CIM has its own little query language.\n\n296\n00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,830\nWhich I don't know anybody who has it\nmemorized, but I'm sure somebody does.\n\n297\n00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,162\n>> Surely not.\nWell, somebody does.\n\n298\n00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:19,870\n>> It's actually pretty similar to SQL,\nbut not exactly.\n\n299\n00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,390\n>> It really is close to Transact-SQL,\nit's just different class names, right.\n\n300\n00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,960\nSo you gotta know those Win32_Service and\nthings like that, but\n\n301\n00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,330\nthe structures the same.\n\n302\n00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,030\nSelect all, select asterisk from, and\n\n303\n00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,680\nyou get your where clauses and\nthings like that.\n\n304\n00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,780\nBut you see it really is\nstarting to get clunky,\n\n305\n00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,740\nbecause we're not using\nnative PowerShell commands.\n\n306\n00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,890\nRight, we're actually having to provide\nall the information that the SIN method\n\n307\n00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,561\nwould need.\n\n308\n00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:43,528\nAll right instead of just using\nour normal PowerShell syntax.\n\n309\n00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:48,417\n>> So what it's gonna do, is it's gonna\nrun this query select star from Win32\n\n310\n00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:51,140\nservice where name equals browser.\n\n311\n00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,040\nSo it's looking for\nany service name browser.\n\n312\n00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,240\nAnd then it's gonna change the arguments\non that server so the start name and\n\n313\n00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,340\nstart password are my name and password.\n\n314\n00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,010\nAll right?\n\n315\n00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,940\nThat's gonna make that service\nrun under that account.\n\n316\n00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,010\nNow, one thing to watch out for, this\nquery has to be surrounded in quote marks,\n\n317\n00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,610\nright, because there's spaces in it.\n\n318\n00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,520\nWell, browser has to be surrounded\nin quote marks also, or\n\n319\n00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,950\nwhatever the name of your service is,\nand you can't use double quotes in both\n\n320\n00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,830\nplaces, so\nI use double quotes around the query.\n\n321\n00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:24,770\nAnd I use single apostrophes\naround the word browser, so\n\n322\n00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,870\nthere's actually an apostrophe followed by\na double quote right there at the end of\n\n323\n00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,430\nthe word browser.\n\n324\n00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,840\nAnd when we run that,\nassuming that I don't have a typo,\n\n325\n00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,060\nwhich apparently I do, then it will go\nahead and apply that and get it set.\n\n326\n00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,940\nSo it is complaining about let's see.\n\n327\n00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,030\nDid I spell arguments wrong?\n\n328\n00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,000\nIt says cannot evaluate\nparameter argument's because\n\n329\n00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,220\nargument is specified as a script\nblock and there is no input.\n\n330\n00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,180\nWell isn't that exciting.\n\n331\n00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,580\nI must have a typo.\n\n332\n00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,446\nLet me just scan over this real quick and\nsee if I can't spot my typo.\n\n333\n00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:55,968\nAll right.\nSo\n\n334\n00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:57,559\nnow it's time for the joy of power shell.\n\n335\n00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,940\nWe get to find my mistakes.\n\n336\n00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,486\nRight.\n\n337\n00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:00,838\nSo, it's easy to make them.\n\n338\n00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:04,177\nYou know, as I look at the command here,\nthere's a couple of problems right.\n\n339\n00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:06,499\n>> They definitely let you\nknow when you make a mistake,\n\n340\n00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,635\nyou get that red text everywhere,\nyour screen starts bleeding on you.\n\n341\n00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,780\n[LAUGH]\n>> And sadly,\n\n342\n00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,320\nthere's more than one mistake here.\n\n343\n00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,000\nBut it's complaining about\none in particula,r about my\n\n344\n00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,210\narguments not having any input.\n\n345\n00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,150\nAnd the problem is,\nI did this script block, and\n\n346\n00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,980\nI didn't stick an @\nsymbol at the beginning.\n\n347\n00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,720\nWhen you do that, the squiggly brackets\nis an input to a modifier like that.\n\n348\n00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,440\nIt's gotta have an @ symbol before it.\n\n349\n00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,960\nSo I just need to add that on.\n\n350\n00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,400\nThe other problem is I, well,\nI assume it's a problem,\n\n351\n00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,640\nI'll correct it before it becomes one,\nis that I used a fake name here.\n\n352\n00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,670\nI'm just gonna switch\nthat to a valid account.\n\n353\n00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,275\nThis machine is called server 01.\n\n354\n00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:41,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n355\n00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,740\nI'm just gonna provide that there.\n\n356\n00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,690\nSo that should be enough to get\nus in business right there.\n\n357\n00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,330\nAnd I'll go ahead and run it.\n\n358\n00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,860\nAnd I get my return value of zero there.\n\n359\n00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,770\nSo it looks like it is happy.\n\n360\n00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,965\nAnd I guess we can verify that real quick.\n\n361\n00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:56,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Let me just jump back to my\n\n362\n00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,700\nscreen here.\n\n363\n00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,440\nSo here's my computer browser service,\nit's disabled.\n\n364\n00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,380\nRight now it's set to\nrun as the local system.\n\n365\n00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,040\nI'm just gonna refresh that.\n\n366\n00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,600\nAnd let's see what happens there.\n\n367\n00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,380\nAnd sure enough,\nnow it shows as running as DPezet.\n\n368\n00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,900\nNow it did change it to dot slash DPezet.\n\n369\n00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,530\nBut that's okay.\n\n370\n00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,755\nDot, that means this computer, which is.\n\n371\n00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:16,297\n>> [CROSSTALK], yeah.\n\n372\n00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:17,720\nSo a little bit different\nthan what I punched in.\n\n373\n00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,180\nBut it did actually change this,\nnow that user account is set.\n\n374\n00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,600\nNow, if the service was\nrunning when I did that,\n\n375\n00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,070\nit doesn't actually take effect\nuntil you restart it, so\n\n376\n00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:30,090\nI'd need to do a restart-service,\nand that would push that along.\n\n377\n00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,800\nBut, that long command right there,\nthat's what took care of it.\n\n378\n00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,396\nAnd we've got Invoke-Cimmethod,\nthat's me calling the sIM.\n\n379\n00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:42,012\nI did -name Change to let it know\nthat's the method I'm using, a change.\n\n380\n00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:45,760\n-Arguments, that's where I provided\nStartName and StartPassword,\n\n381\n00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,190\nthe two values I wanted to change.\n\n382\n00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,040\nAnd then the query that specified\nwho I wanted to change it on.\n\n383\n00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,498\nAnd I did All services where\nthe name equals browser,\n\n384\n00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:57,260\nreached in there,changed it,\nand now it's happy.\n\n385\n00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,860\nSo, it's kind of a convoluted\nway to go about things,\n\n386\n00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,200\nwe gotta jump through these\nlittle hoops to get it in place.\n\n387\n00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,720\nOnce it's done, it actually works\npretty well, and now it's in place.\n\n388\n00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,380\nWe're using the PowerShell,l but\n\n389\n00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,280\ntechnically we're really using the SIM\nhere to make the changes that we want.\n\n390\n00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,790\nNow if I wanted to verify this,\n\n391\n00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:20,690\nI had to jump over to my GUI utility\nto do it here, and that's because,\n\n392\n00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,840\nI don't have a great PowerShell command\nto be able to start as options, right.\n\n393\n00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,570\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n394\n00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,720\nthere are ways to do it, right Mike?\n\n395\n00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,840\n>> There's a couple, yeah, we can do.\n\n396\n00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,310\nI think we can use that same query\nbasically, to return that information.\n\n397\n00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,610\nFormat it as a table.\n\n398\n00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,070\nSo we could use like a,\nwe could use the sIM to do it.\n\n399\n00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,280\nWe could use the WMI to do it too.\n\n400\n00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,040\nWe got that GWMI?\n\n401\n00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,380\n>> GWMI yes.\n\n402\n00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,490\n>> Which is just an alias for get dash\n>> Something longer than that right?\n\n403\n00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,580\n>> Windows management instrumentation.\n\n404\n00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,740\n>> Yeah, it's a long one,\ngwmi, let's find it in here.\n\n405\n00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,860\nI'm pulling up the aliases.\n\n406\n00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,498\nThere it is.\n\n407\n00:18:56,498 --> 00:19:00,660\nIt's just Get-WMyObject, so we can reach\nin using one of those other methods,\n\n408\n00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,850\nto be able to pull the service back and\nreturn whether or\n\n409\n00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:09,010\nnot that actually functions, so\nIf I do that get-wmiobject, or\n\n410\n00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:14,420\nGWMI, we can then follow\nit up with win32_service.\n\n411\n00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,710\nWe can pipe that into Format-Table,\n\n412\n00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,520\nand I'm just gonna do name and start name\n>> And what's it's gonna do,\n\n413\n00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,160\nis it's gonna return to me\na list from all of my services,\n\n414\n00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,170\nalong with what user account they\nstart as, and so they're gonna go, and\n\n415\n00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,640\nI can find my browser service in here,\nburied in here somewhere.\n\n416\n00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,590\nRight there, browser, and I can see it set\nto run as dot slash the changes in place,\n\n417\n00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,540\nso again PowerShell can't\ngive me that information, but\n\n418\n00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,850\nthe WMI can, so we're using PowerShell\nto reach out to another system.\n\n419\n00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,230\nNow, where it gets really bad,\nare some of the other features and\n\n420\n00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,910\nservices like the recovery options.\n\n421\n00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,510\nIf I go into my recovery options here for\n\n422\n00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,260\ncomputer browser, right, what happens if\nthe computer browser service crashes?\n\n423\n00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,580\nWell under recovery option,\n\n424\n00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,300\nyou can see that the first time\nit crashes restart the service.\n\n425\n00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,130\nSecond time or whatever, go ahead and\nrestart the service,or take no action,\n\n426\n00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,560\nor reboot the server, right?\n\n427\n00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,470\nYou can say all sorts of things in here.\n\n428\n00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,370\nYou can set the timers for how long\nit takes to reset the counters, and\n\n429\n00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,470\nall of that, right here in this GUI.\n\n430\n00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,905\nUnfortunately, For this one, there's\nnot really a great way to do it from\n\n431\n00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:24,815\nthe PowerShell, and even the WMI and the\nSIM are fairly limited on this one too.\n\n432\n00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:27,905\nSo, you're better off\nreaching out to another\n\n433\n00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:29,405\ncommand line utility that's out there.\n\n434\n00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:31,375\nThere's a command line utility called SC,\n\n435\n00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,265\nwhich is the service\nconfiguration utility.\n\n436\n00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:38,145\nWe can call that from inside a PowerShell,\nit's just an executable.\n\n437\n00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:40,895\nYou do have to type .exe on\nthe end of it or it doesn't work.\n\n438\n00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:44,310\nIf I just run SC It, oh,\nI'm a liar, look at that.\n\n439\n00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,840\nOh no, it's not working.\n\n440\n00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,380\nSC is an alias to Set-Content,\nso that's not working, and\n\n441\n00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,890\nit's trying to call Set-Content.\n\n442\n00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:56,525\nBut if I do sc.exe, that runs the utility\nthat I want the service configuration.\n\n443\n00:20:56,525 --> 00:21:00,065\nSo we can still use that to reach out and\nmodify some of the other things.\n\n444\n00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:01,575\nA little outside of the PowerShell scope,\nbut\n\n445\n00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:04,595\nI just want to show you a quick example\nof that, just so you are aware.\n\n446\n00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:11,152\nSo for example I might say SC,\noh, let me clear my screen here,\n\n447\n00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:14,170\nSC.exe, followed by what it\nis that I'm doing, right?\n\n448\n00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,810\nSo I wanna modify the failure settings for\nthe browser service.\n\n449\n00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,850\nThat's the one I've been\nworking with this show.\n\n450\n00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,040\nI'm gonna say reset\nthe counter after 24 hours, and\n\n451\n00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,240\nyou have to do it in seconds,\nso that's 86,400 seconds.\n\n452\n00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,210\nAnd then I'll say the actions,\nare going to be,\n\n453\n00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,270\nrestart the service if it fails, and\n\n454\n00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,150\nthese are in milliseconds, so\nI'm basically saying in a minute.\n\n455\n00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,880\nIf the service fails, wait a minute,\nin case it recovers on its own, and\n\n456\n00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,380\nif it doesn't, go ahead and\nrestart the service.\n\n457\n00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:54,040\nAnd then I'll say reboot at 30,000\nmilliseconds, or five minutes.\n\n458\n00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,970\n>> Second failure option.\n\n459\n00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,050\n>> If we try to restart the service, or\n\n460\n00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,020\nwhatever, and it doesn't come back up,\nwell, just reboot the whole server, right?\n\n461\n00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,450\nYeah, that would be my second,\nI could do another one.\n\n462\n00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:12,650\nI could come in here and say, like restart\nslash I could even say 6,000 again.\n\n463\n00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,780\nSo, wait a minute.\n\n464\n00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,980\nTry and restart.\n\n465\n00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,610\nWait another minute.\n\n466\n00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,690\nTry and restart.\n\n467\n00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,720\nWait five minutes and\nthen reboot or whatever.\n\n468\n00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,040\nYou specify each of\nthose different options.\n\n469\n00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,510\nI'm gonna say, if it doesn't survive that\nfirst reboot, I mean the first restart,\n\n470\n00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,220\njust go ahead and reboot.\n\n471\n00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,910\n>> Just reboot the whole thing.\n\n472\n00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:26,640\n>> All right?\n\n473\n00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,470\nNow this command, you can do this\nin the regular command prompt.\n\n474\n00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,110\nYou don't have to do this in PowerShell.\n\n475\n00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,150\nBut it's unfortunately kind of the only\neasy way tobe able to get in and\n\n476\n00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,810\nmanipulate that data.\n\n477\n00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,520\nAnd you'll see my configuration\nchanges succeeded, and\n\n478\n00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,660\nnow those values are in place.\n\n479\n00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,230\nSo, sometimes you're trying to get\nthe PowerShell to do something.\n\n480\n00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,910\nIs like getting a square peg\nto fit in a round hole, and\n\n481\n00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,870\nit just makes sense to use some of\nthe other utilities that are out there.\n\n482\n00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,820\n>> Eventually we'll see a lot of those\ncommands included in PowerShell,\n\n483\n00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,280\nbecause PowerShell, in the end,\nis gonna be the one to rule them all.\n\n484\n00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,629\n>> Yeah, eventually.\n[LAUGH] All right well,\n\n485\n00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,190\nI think that's about it for services.\n\n486\n00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,870\nSo in this segment we got a chance to\nsee how to view our services, start,\n\n487\n00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,260\nstop, restart services,\nthat was a good time.\n\n488\n00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,600\nWe saw how to use the SIM to modify\nthe start up account for a service, and\n\n489\n00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,640\nstart a password, and we saw using\nthe WMI to query that data back and\n\n490\n00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,590\nverify that it was in place.\n\n491\n00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,400\nAnd lastly we saw using an external\nutility, to be able to modify the service\n\n492\n00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,900\nstatus so, a couple of\ndifferent ways to work with it.\n\n493\n00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,730\nIt's all neat stuff.\n\n494\n00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,131\nDefinitely things that can be used.\n\n495\n00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:27,829\n>> Absolutely.\n\n496\n00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:29,408\n>> All right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n497\n00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,783\nStay tuned,\nwe got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n498\n00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:38,970\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:13,600\nthe Microsoft PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,140\nMost of us are familiar with the,\n\n5\n00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,350\nthe graphical interface that we have,\nit's called the Task Manager in Windows.\n\n6\n00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,170\nAnd it lets you see all of your processes,\n\n7\n00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,230\nwhat's running,\ntheir CPU loads and all that.\n\n8\n00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,060\nAnd that's great if you're sitting at\nthe machine and you've got your GUI handy.\n\n9\n00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,780\nBut if you're trying to work\nwith things from the PowerShell\n\n10\n00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,990\nit's not particularly useful.\n\n11\n00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,530\nSo fortunately we have a whole suite of\n\n12\n00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,240\nutilities that we can use from the\nPowerShell to really do the same thing.\n\n13\n00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,580\nLet's take a look at it.\n\n14\n00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,000\nSo here on this machine I've got\nthe Task Manager pulled up and so\n\n15\n00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,450\nI've got my processes that are running,\n\n16\n00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,705\nyou see like I'm running Internet Explorer\nand some of the other the other\n\n17\n00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:50,835\nthings like the memory they're using and\nso on, all presented right here.\n\n18\n00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:54,675\nI can get that same data\nfrom within the PowerShell.\n\n19\n00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:56,811\nIf I just do Get-Process.\n\n20\n00:00:56,811 --> 00:01:00,915\nGet-Process is kind of like\ntask manager for PowerShell.\n\n21\n00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:04,075\nIt'll show me all the processes that\nare running on this system, and\n\n22\n00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:05,975\nI see there's CPU utilization.\n\n23\n00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:10,310\nI see their memory, network bandwidth,\nhow many handles they've got open.\n\n24\n00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,940\nAll listed right here.\n\n25\n00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,350\nSame data that we're looking at\ninside of the GUI based task manager.\n\n26\n00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,540\nNow the only negative about this view is,\n\n27\n00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,710\nunlike the task manager,\nthis is not being dynamically updated.\n\n28\n00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,710\nSo the task manager,\n\n29\n00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,190\nit's showing you real time data on\nthe utilization on your system.\n\n30\n00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,080\nHere, it's a point in time.\n\n31\n00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,390\nThis is how things look\nright then when I ran it.\n\n32\n00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,900\nNot how it is necessarily right now.\n\n33\n00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,430\nNow if I wanna get detailed information\nabout a process, I can do that.\n\n34\n00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,600\nEvery process is listed\nalong with a process ID.\n\n35\n00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,310\nThat's this column right here.\n\n36\n00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,130\nAnd if I take the ID for one.\n\n37\n00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,120\nLike, I'll take Internet Explorer here.\n\n38\n00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,000\nIt's 3288.\n\n39\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,260\nWell, I can take that process ID and\nI can add to Get-Process.\n\n40\n00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,659\nAnd say Get-Process.\n\n41\n00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:00,030\n- id 3288 and now it'll get me\ninformation about that process itself.\n\n42\n00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,640\nWell, you might ask yourself, well wait\na minute Don, it's the same thing right?\n\n43\n00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,220\nIt's really just showing the same data.\n\n44\n00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,960\nWell the key thing to remember\nhere is there's always more\n\n45\n00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,970\nthan what shows up on the screen.\n\n46\n00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,010\nIf I were to take that and\npipe that through Format-List,\n\n47\n00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,910\nnow I can see, well, actually less,\nright, I'm seeing less data now.\n\n48\n00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,920\nID handle CPU name,\nwhat happened to all of that other stuff?\n\n49\n00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,370\nWell, the problem here is that the data\nthat we're getting from get dash\n\n50\n00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,020\nprocess is actually being pulled\nfrom more than one location,\n\n51\n00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,700\nand it's being rendered on the screen,\nand it looks like it's all just one\n\n52\n00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,250\nset of data but it's actually coming\nfrom more than one background.\n\n53\n00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,010\nYou'll notice that there some\nthings that are even missing,\n\n54\n00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,200\nlike what user is responsible for\ngenerating these processes.\n\n55\n00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,160\nSo when we start to manipulate that\ndata sometimes we lose some of it and\n\n56\n00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160\nwe have to pull it from other locations.\n\n57\n00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,900\nAll right now we can also do things\nlike Get-Process instead of- id,\n\n58\n00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,040\nwe can just do like a name.\n\n59\n00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,743\nSo if I want to get the process for\niexplorer, Internet Explorer is iexplorer.\n\n60\n00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:04,000\nNow it'll pull that up and\n\n61\n00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,070\nthe nice thing here is that I might have\nmore than one process with that name.\n\n62\n00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,140\nAnd it'll list it.\n\n63\n00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,560\nAnd if there's more than one process that\nI'm looking or I can actually just set\n\n64\n00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,610\ncommas in here, and I can say show\nme I explore as well as explorer.\n\n65\n00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,800\nI want both, and\nnow I get that filtered view there, too.\n\n66\n00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,550\nSo couple of different ways that we can\nmanipulate this data to be able to get\n\n67\n00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,340\nexactly what we want.\n\n68\n00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,098\nNow, if we're going through the trouble\nto look at processes we're probably\n\n69\n00:03:31,098 --> 00:03:33,269\nconcerned about CPU utilization.\n\n70\n00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,180\nAt least for me,\nthat's why I'm normally going.\n\n71\n00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,710\nSometimes it's memory or whatever but\na lot of times it's just CPU utilization.\n\n72\n00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,840\nSo when we go in here we might\nwanna sort this information.\n\n73\n00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,750\nAnd you'll notice when I just do\na straight up Get-Process the data's not\n\n74\n00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,930\nreally sorted.\n\n75\n00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,120\nIt's kinda spread out just in any order,\nit's not truly random, it's actually\n\n76\n00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,110\nalphabetized by the process name and so\nit's just kinda just listed in that order.\n\n77\n00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,190\nWell that might make sense for\n\n78\n00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,040\nwhat we want, it might not make sense for\nwhat we want.\n\n79\n00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,330\nIf I wanna see who's using\nthe most CPU from my system,\n\n80\n00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,380\nwell I can take Get-Process and\nI can feed that into Sort-Object and\n\n81\n00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,450\nI can sort that out to put it in\nthe order that I want, all right.\n\n82\n00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,610\nSo, let me show you an example of that.\n\n83\n00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,450\nI'm going to pipe that into Sort-Object,\n\n84\n00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,750\nand I'll need to pick what I want to\nsort by, and I'm gonna sort by CPU.\n\n85\n00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,070\nAnd so when I do that,\nnow it is sorted by CPU.\n\n86\n00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,570\nAnd it goes from lowest to highest so\n\n87\n00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,760\nyou'll see my highest CPU utilizer\nright there, down at the bottom.\n\n88\n00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,230\nYou can change that if you want if you\njust add -descending to the end of it,\n\n89\n00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,360\nthat will flip the order so the highest\nis at the beginning and the lowest is\n\n90\n00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,042\nat the bottom, and now I can see that\nsame data just in a different order.\n\n91\n00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:48,120\nSo, Sort-Object is a great way to do that.\n\n92\n00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,890\nAll right, some of the other\nthings that we might want to do,\n\n93\n00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,460\nwe might want to kill a process.\n\n94\n00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,280\nIf I see somebody taking\nup too much CPU or\n\n95\n00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,230\njust annoying me in general,\nmaybe like Internet Explorer here,\n\n96\n00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,810\nit's just sitting there in\nthe background but it's doing something.\n\n97\n00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,200\nSo I decide that I want to kill it.\n\n98\n00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,430\nI just want to get it out of there.\n\n99\n00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,160\nWell, we can use Stop-Process to do that.\n\n100\n00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,030\nIf we run Stop-Process and\nthen the process that we want to kill off,\n\n101\n00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,370\nthat will knock it off.\n\n102\n00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,065\nNow if I just do Stop-Process iexplorer,\nwell,\n\n103\n00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:20,650\nthere's more than one process\ncalled iexplorer right now.\n\n104\n00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,555\nIn Internet Explorer every time you open\nup a tab, it runs in its own process.\n\n105\n00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:29,735\nSo if I do Stop-Process iexplorer,\nit'll kill Internet Explorer outright.\n\n106\n00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:34,075\nBut if I just wanna kill a particular tab,\nI'll need to do it by the id number so\n\n107\n00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:36,000\nI can get that specific one.\n\n108\n00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,950\nWe don't normally do that because it's\nreally hard to tell which process ID\n\n109\n00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,500\na tab is tied to.\n\n110\n00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,380\nBut in other software you might have\na reason to kill off a particular process.\n\n111\n00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,250\nAnd you'd use the ID for that.\n\n112\n00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,995\nIn fact, if you do a Get-Help,\nfor Stop-Process,\n\n113\n00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:58,710\nyou'll see that it accepts i\n-d but- name is the default.\n\n114\n00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,860\nSo it's expecting a name.\n\n115\n00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,260\nYou can provide it the ID.\n\n116\n00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,010\nIt's up to you,\nwhichever one you want to provide.\n\n117\n00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,160\nNow also keep in mind that you do need\nto have permissions to stop the task.\n\n118\n00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,470\nIf you're just a regular user, you're not\ngoing to be able to kill others' tasks.\n\n119\n00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,060\nBut if you're an administrator and you've\nrun your PowerShell with administrative\n\n120\n00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,690\nprivileges, you'll be able to\nstop other people's tasks.\n\n121\n00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,840\nAnd you can say Stop-Process iexplorer.\n\n122\n00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,230\nAnd I've got my Internet Explorer windows\ndown here, so I've got like Google News,\n\n123\n00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,000\nand slash dot pulled up, and\n\n124\n00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,520\nI'm just gonna run this Stop-Process and\nit's letting me know that, oh sorry,\n\n125\n00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,430\nI need to throw in this dash name, so\nit knows what to look for, there we go.\n\n126\n00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,820\nAnd I can see that Internet Explorer\njust dropped right out of the bottom.\n\n127\n00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,870\nSo that was Stop-Process -name iexplorer,\nand it killed Internet Explorer outright.\n\n128\n00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,980\nIf I do a Get-Process,\n\n129\n00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,240\niexplorer, now it's gonna return back and\ntell me there's nothing.\n\n130\n00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,990\nThere were no processes called iexplorer.\n\n131\n00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,880\nAnd I know I didn't have a syntax\nerror cuz if I just change that to,\n\n132\n00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,240\nlike, explorer, that returns back.\n\n133\n00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,120\nRight?\nSo there were just no processes\n\n134\n00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,755\ncalled iexplorer.\n\n135\n00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,730\nAll right, there are some other neat\nlittle tricks that we can do with this.\n\n136\n00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,190\nFor most people, that's all you need right\nthere, Get-Process and Stop-Process.\n\n137\n00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,860\nThose are the two main ones that we use,\nbut there's another one that I like,\n\n138\n00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,440\nif you want to hunt for processes that\nare frozen, that are not responding.\n\n139\n00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,490\nYou know how sometimes\na program will lock up and\n\n140\n00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,390\nin the task manager it will\njust say not responding and\n\n141\n00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,150\nyou can try an end the task that way We\ncan actually use the PowerShell to query\n\n142\n00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,030\nfor which processes are not responding,\nand then attempt to terminate them.\n\n143\n00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,390\nOr maybe we just wanna query and\nsee which one's not responding, right.\n\n144\n00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,710\nSo that command,\nit actually involves more than one thing.\n\n145\n00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,760\nI'm gonna start with Get-Process,\nall right, so\n\n146\n00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,720\nthat's gonna pull my process list, and\nI'm gonna pipe that into where-object.\n\n147\n00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,570\nRemember, we can use where-object to\nfilter the output that we're getting, so\n\n148\n00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,540\nI'm gonna filter this out, and I'm gonna\nfilter it out with a little filter script.\n\n149\n00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,780\nAnd my filter script is\ngonna be a fairly simple one\n\n150\n00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,428\nI'm going to start by\ntaking my original data.\n\n151\n00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:10,860\nSo that $_,\n\n152\n00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,420\nthat's a reference that says whatever\nthe output from the first command is.\n\n153\n00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,410\nSo Get-Process is output and\nthen dot responding.\n\n154\n00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,370\nWe didn't see it up here, up here in this\ntable there's no column called responding.\n\n155\n00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,410\nAnd when I did that format list,\nremember we saw even less.\n\n156\n00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,990\nBut it doesn't mean the data isn't there.\n\n157\n00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,300\nIt's just not being rendered on screen.\n\n158\n00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,510\nAnd so I'm referencing a value that\ndoesn't necessarily show up by default.\n\n159\n00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,200\nResponding, right?\n\n160\n00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,650\nIf the app is not responding,\nthen it's gonna fail that, right?\n\n161\n00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:52,819\nSo I'm gonna say,$_Responding -eq $False.\n\n162\n00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:56,500\nIf it reflects false,\nthat means it's not responding and\n\n163\n00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,180\nthat's an app that I need to kill off,\nalright.\n\n164\n00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,480\nNow, if I just run it like that well,\n\n165\n00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,410\nthat's gonna return a list of any apps\nthat are currently not responding.\n\n166\n00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,160\nBut I can take that and I can pipe\nthat one more time into stop-process.\n\n167\n00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,835\nAnd now it will say,\ngive me a list of my processes.\n\n168\n00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:20,775\nFilter it down to just the ones\nthat are not responding and\n\n169\n00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:23,325\nwhatever ones are not responding,\nstop them.\n\n170\n00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:25,955\nAll right.\nSo we're kind of stepping through as we go\n\n171\n00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:29,970\nthrough and thin our list out and\nthen stop those processes outright.\n\n172\n00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,560\nAnd it kills them out.\n\n173\n00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,000\nNow in my case there weren't any\nprocesses that weren't responding so\n\n174\n00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,540\nthat's not gonna happen.\n\n175\n00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,450\nBut you can make really neat commands like\nthese, right, a series of commands that\n\n176\n00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,930\nwork together to achieve your goal and you\ncan automate sorts of things with this.\n\n177\n00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,990\nSo really cool.\n\n178\n00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,840\nYou can query like what the CPU load\nis of a very particular process,\n\n179\n00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,140\nmaybe you're trying to develop\nyour own logging system.\n\n180\n00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,020\nYou can do that.\n\n181\n00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,470\nThere's really no limit to what\nyou can achieve with this.\n\n182\n00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,420\nBut, just keep in mind that basically\neverything that you can do inside of\n\n183\n00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,520\nthe task manager, well, you can do\nright here through the PowerShell.\n\n184\n00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,000\nThe only one that really gives you\na problem is which user is attached to\n\n185\n00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,600\nthe process.\n\n186\n00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,220\nFor whatever reason, Microsoft hasn't\nadded that support into Powershell yet.\n\n187\n00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,202\nBy the time you watch this video maybe\nthey will have, but at this time I'm\n\n188\n00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:18,400\nnot aware of anyway to see what\nuser's responsible for that process.\n\n189\n00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,740\nVersus if I go into the task manager, well\nin the task manager you can quickly and\n\n190\n00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,630\neasily see which users\nare tied to which processes.\n\n191\n00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,530\nWhen I see something like\nWindows Explorer right here,\n\n192\n00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,090\nI can see that D Pezet is who launched it.\n\n193\n00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,630\nRight?\n\n194\n00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,590\nWell, the PowerShell doesn't show that.\n\n195\n00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,570\nMicrosoft will probably\nadd that in the future.\n\n196\n00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,330\nIf you guys out there in TV land know\na way to do that, definitely let me know.\n\n197\n00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,740\nI haven't seen a way to do that, so\nthat's one thing that we can't do, but\n\n198\n00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,630\notherwise pulling our data back,\nlooking at how it's going,\n\n199\n00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,800\nstopping processes those functions we\ncan easily do from in the power shop.\n\n200\n00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,350\nSo in this segment we got\na chance to see Get-Process,\n\n201\n00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,838\nwhich is like our PowerShell\nbased task manager.\n\n202\n00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:02,680\nWe saw Stop-Process, how we could stop\nany or kill off any processes running.\n\n203\n00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,470\nAnd lastly, I showed you guys how to\ndetect not responding processes and\n\n204\n00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,630\nhow to stop them also.\n\n205\n00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,070\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n206\n00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,660\nStay tuned.\n\n207\n00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,119\nWe've got more PowerShell,coming up.\n\n208\n00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,450\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,852\n[SOUND] All right in this\nsegment we are going to\n\n2\n00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:09,046\nbe looking at PowerShell commands that\n\n3\n00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:14,012\nare going to allow me to\nwork with my printers.\n\n4\n00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:16,335\nYay printers [LAUGH].\n\n5\n00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:18,510\nThose of you that have seen me before,\n\n6\n00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,680\nand some as you might know,\nprinters are not my favorite thing.\n\n7\n00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,870\nThey are always seem to be\ncausing problems, but anyway.\n\n8\n00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,860\nWe're going to take a look at some of our\nPowerShell commands that we can use to\n\n9\n00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,310\nAdd printers to our servers,\n\n10\n00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,020\nour print servers, as well as adding\nthe printers to the clients themselves.\n\n11\n00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,160\nSo let's just dive right in and\nget started.\n\n12\n00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,640\nThese are the HOL labs,\nthat you guys have access to.\n\n13\n00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,250\nAnd I've got our 2012, I think it's\nthe 2012 set of lab machines pulled up.\n\n14\n00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,840\nI think is what's called on the HOL page.\n\n15\n00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,830\nAnd here I am on server\none that's running 2012R2.\n\n16\n00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,460\nAnd I'm gonna pull up PowerShell.\n\n17\n00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,180\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do.\n\n18\n00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,640\nThere's a few steps that\nare involved in adding a printer.\n\n19\n00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,160\nYou guys, we've added printers through\nthe GUI interface before, I'm sure.\n\n20\n00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,590\nWhen we go to add a printer,\nwe've gotta do a couple of things.\n\n21\n00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,610\nWe've gotta make sure we've got\nthe driver For the printer.\n\n22\n00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,240\nWe've gotta create a port for\nthat printer.\n\n23\n00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,950\nAnd then we've gotta\ncreate the printer itself.\n\n24\n00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,890\nRight?\nRemember in Microsoft land,\n\n25\n00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,060\nthe thing that sits on your desk, or\n\n26\n00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,360\nis sitting over there in the corner of\nthe office, that's not the printer.\n\n27\n00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,310\nRight?\nThat's the print device.\n\n28\n00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,990\nWhat we've gotta do is create the printer,\nwhich is the icon Within our devices and\n\n29\n00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,370\nprinters window, in our control\npanel in our operating system.\n\n30\n00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,950\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna install the print driver.\n\n31\n00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,560\nSo the command for that.\n\n32\n00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,110\nI've got a link that I'm\ngonna post to the show notes.\n\n33\n00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,490\nIn fact I can pull that up real\nquick just to show you guys.\n\n34\n00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,590\nMicrosoft has a great page\nof course on tech net.\n\n35\n00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,020\nAnd here on again, I'll put that note or\nthis link in our show notes.\n\n36\n00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,010\nHere you can see all the different\ncommands I have available for\n\n37\n00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,950\nworking for working with my printers.\n\n38\n00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,710\nThings like add printer,\nadd printer driver,\n\n39\n00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,850\nadd printer port,\nobviously to begin to set this up.\n\n40\n00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,480\nAnd then once you've got printers On\nstall, then we've got our get command,\n\n41\n00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,360\nwhere we can retrieve properties\nabout those printers, get printer,\n\n42\n00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,230\nget printer driver, get printer port,\nget printer properties.\n\n43\n00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,460\nWe can also work with\nthe jobs through PowerShell.\n\n44\n00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,660\nWe can pull back a list\nof the running jobs.\n\n45\n00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,570\nWe can stop and start those jobs,\nresume those jobs, cancel jobs,\n\n46\n00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,830\nand things like that.\n\n47\n00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,550\nSo let's get started.\n\n48\n00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,130\nFirst thing we're going to do again,\nis switch back here to my server and\n\n49\n00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,860\nI'm going to install the print drivers.\n\n50\n00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,150\nThat's going to be add-printerdriver,\nIf I could spell,\n\n51\n00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,620\nit would make the auto-fill a little\nbit easier, add-printerDriver.\n\n52\n00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,180\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,680\nuse the switch computer name,\njust to show you guys the switch.\n\n54\n00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,280\nBecause I'm running it on the machine\nthat I'm installing the printer,\n\n55\n00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,510\nI could just leave that blank.\n\n56\n00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,170\nIt will default, if I don't use\nthe -ComputerName parameter,\n\n57\n00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,390\nit's gonna default to the machine I'm\nactually running this command on.\n\n58\n00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,890\nIf I was doing a remote session\nwith another server, again,\n\n59\n00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,730\nI could leave out that -ComputerName,\nbecause I'm on that server,\n\n60\n00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,654\nremoting in to it, and it would assume,\nor default, to the local machine.\n\n61\n00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:19,610\nBut I'll do it anyway, -Computer,\nand this guy's name is server one,\n\n62\n00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,200\nand then the name of the print\ndriver that I'm installing.\n\n63\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,010\nSo, I'm going to do a dash name, and\nI'm using a class driver here that's\n\n64\n00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,550\nalready installed on this machine, or\nit has available through the Windows.\n\n65\n00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:38,538\nSo, we're going to go to Dell, Color,\n\n66\n00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:44,702\nwhich one did I use here, laser, pcl6,\n\n67\n00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:50,184\nif I remember right, class driver.\n\n68\n00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:53,120\nHit Enter.\n\n69\n00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,100\nAnd evidently I can't spell.\n\n70\n00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,320\nSomewhere in here.\n\n71\n00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,908\nDell color laser PCL 6,\nI misspelled class, how about that.\n\n72\n00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:11,730\nAll right, there There we go so\nnow I've got that driver installed.\n\n73\n00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,240\nThe next thing I'm gonna do, is I'm\ngonna create a port for this printer.\n\n74\n00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,950\nJust gonna create a standard TCP/IP port,\nhopefully you guys have seen that or\n\n75\n00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,170\ngone through the GUI to do that before.\n\n76\n00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,642\nAnd we're gonna use PowerShell to do that,\nand it's just an Add-PrinterPort command.\n\n77\n00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:32,055\nSo Add, Dash printer port and\n\n78\n00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:38,880\nmy parameters for that one again I\ncan leave off the dash computer name,\n\n79\n00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,800\nbecause I'm doing it on the machine\nthat I want to install the printer on.\n\n80\n00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,290\nI'll throw it in there just for\nour example here.\n\n81\n00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,730\nSo computer name Server one, and\n\n82\n00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,210\nthen dash name, and\nthe name I want to give that port.\n\n83\n00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,190\nAnd just to keep things simple, I'm going\nto use the IP address as the name of that\n\n84\n00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:04,721\nport, so in this case the server's\naddress is 192168.1.103.\n\n85\n00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,340\nAnd then I need the printer host address.\n\n86\n00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:17,070\nAll right, so that's gonna be\na dash printer post address.\n\n87\n00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,110\nAnd again it's gonna be the IP\naddress of this computer.\n\n88\n00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,764\nSo, 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 103.\n\n89\n00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:32,300\nI hit Enter, and hopefully no red text\nmeans my command worked successfully.\n\n90\n00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,120\nSo now I've got the printer driver\ninstalled, and I've got a port created.\n\n91\n00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,270\nAnd if we wanna take a look at\nthis to see what I've done so far.\n\n92\n00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,610\nI'm gonna go back over here to,\nlet's see where I can do this from.\n\n93\n00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,287\nLet's pull up my control panel.\n\n94\n00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:56,600\nAnd if we want to take a look, I'm gonna\ngo into my View devices and printers.\n\n95\n00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,712\nAnd then I'm gonna pretend\nlike I wanna add a printer.\n\n96\n00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,770\nAnd I'm gonna choose to add it manually.\n\n97\n00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,761\nAnd in my list of available ports,\nyou'll see the port that I just created.\n\n98\n00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:17,918\nThe 192.168.1.103 listed\nas a standard TCP/IP port.\n\n99\n00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,815\nSo my PowerShell commands worked,\nI've installed the driver, and\n\n100\n00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:24,265\nI've installed the, or\ncreated a port for that printer.\n\n101\n00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:29,055\nSo the next step then,\nwould be to actually create the printer,\n\n102\n00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,345\nthe little icon you know, attaching\nthe printer to this print server.\n\n103\n00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,455\nAnd the command for that is add-printer.\n\n104\n00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:40,660\nSo we'll do an add-printer,\n\n105\n00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,470\nand then we're gonna call this guy,\nwell first let me do a dash computer name.\n\n106\n00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,990\nAnd that's gonna be server one.\n\n107\n00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,732\nAnd then the name that I\nwanna call the printer, and\n\n108\n00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:55,534\nin this case I'm gonna\ncall it sales printer.\n\n109\n00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,922\nAnd then the driver, in this one, the\ndriver has to be already installed, right,\n\n110\n00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:07,620\nI'm telling it what driver I wanna\nuse with this particular printer.\n\n111\n00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,250\nSo I have to have already installed\nthat driver at this point.\n\n112\n00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,180\nSo driver name, and again, you know what?\n\n113\n00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,060\nMike's gonna cheat.\n\n114\n00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,570\nWe won't cheat.\n\n115\n00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,470\nGonna just copy that, but we can do it.\n\n116\n00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,772\nDell color laser PCL6\n\n117\n00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:31,930\nclass printer, or class driver.\n\n118\n00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:36,070\nAll right,\nnow that's going to be in quotes for\n\n119\n00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,670\nmy spaces there, and\nthen I want to share this printer.\n\n120\n00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,840\nNormally if you're installing\na printer on a print server,\n\n121\n00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,250\nyou want to share it so your clients\ncan access that printer, right?\n\n122\n00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,986\nSo the parameter for\nthat is just dash shared, and\n\n123\n00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:51,010\nthat's going to share that printer out.\n\n124\n00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,680\nAnd just like when you go\nthrough the GUI interface,\n\n125\n00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,560\nyou get a little check mark to\nallow you to share that printer.\n\n126\n00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,898\nAnd there you're gonna get a share name,\nright?\n\n127\n00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:59,720\nThose share name might be different\nfrom the actual name of the printer.\n\n128\n00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,706\nIn this case, I'm gonna call this guy And\n\n129\n00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:08,010\nso I'll do a -ShareName.\n\n130\n00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,100\nAnd I'm just gonna call this\nsomething like SalesPrint.\n\n131\n00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,410\nAnd then the PortName,\n\n132\n00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,320\nand I used the IP address as\nthe PortName in that previous command.\n\n133\n00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,128\nSo again, 192.168.1.103.\n\n134\n00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:30,898\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\npublish this as well.\n\n135\n00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:35,940\nNow, if you want your clients to be\nable to add these printers themselves,\n\n136\n00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,930\nright, we've done this in the GUI before.\n\n137\n00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,210\nWe wanna go in and make sure that printer\nis published in active directory so\n\n138\n00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,140\nwhen they pull up their add printers\nwizard, They can find their printer\n\n139\n00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,530\neasily and they can pick it and\nadd it to their client machine.\n\n140\n00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,330\nIf I wanna publish this through\nthe PowerShell command it's just\n\n141\n00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,310\nthe word publish.\n\n142\n00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,020\nOr published, I should say.\n\n143\n00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,590\nI'm gonna hit enter.\n\n144\n00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,730\nAnd again, no red text means we\nhave not made any major typos.\n\n145\n00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,490\nSo I've got three commands I've run so\nfar there.\n\n146\n00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,840\nI've done the Add-PrinterDriver,\n\n147\n00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,940\nI gave the name of the computer\nthat I'm installing that driver on.\n\n148\n00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,940\nI can leave that off because I'm running\nthese commands on this particular machine.\n\n149\n00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,960\nAnd then the name of the driver\nthat I'm trying to install.\n\n150\n00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,250\nThen we added the printer port,\nso we created a new port for\n\n151\n00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,290\nthat printer with the add\nprinter port command.\n\n152\n00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,460\nAgain, name of the computer\nyou're creating that port on.\n\n153\n00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,280\nThen the name that you wanna assign to\nthe port, it doesn't have to be the IP\n\n154\n00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,420\naddress, makes it a little bit easier\nsometimes when you're working with them.\n\n155\n00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,130\nThen the actual host address for\n\n156\n00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,805\nthat printer port which would be\nthe IP address of your print server.\n\n157\n00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,610\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n158\n00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,540\nAnd then the last command is\nthat Add-Printer command.\n\n159\n00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,640\nI've got my -ComputerName and\nthen server1.\n\n160\n00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,110\nThen we've got the name that we want\nto assign to the printer itself,\n\n161\n00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,390\nwe've got the driver that that printer\nis going to use, we've shared it, by\n\n162\n00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,980\ndoing a --Shared, and then we've got the\nshared name, whatever we wanna call it.\n\n163\n00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,700\nRemember that's gonna be the UNC path,\nthat you would connect to it manually\n\n164\n00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:12,300\nIn this case \\\\server1\\SalesPrint,\nand then the name of the port, and\n\n165\n00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,340\nuse the IP address for the name, and then\nwe also publish that in active directory.\n\n166\n00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,720\nSo at this point, the printer is good to\ngo, on in this particular print server.\n\n167\n00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,400\nNext thing I'd want to do then,\n\n168\n00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,252\nwould be to install that\nprinter on one of my clients.\n\n169\n00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:34,420\nSo, I'm going to switch over the CL1 here,\nclient one and see what we've got.\n\n170\n00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,530\nActually, before I do that,\nlet me switch back to server1 real quick,\n\n171\n00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,270\njust to show you guys,\nI forgot to show you.\n\n172\n00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,430\nNow that we've added that printer,\nall right,\n\n173\n00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,130\nearlier I showed you when\nI added the printer port,\n\n174\n00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,120\nit showed up in the list of ports when\nI went to add a printer manually.\n\n175\n00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,024\nIf I go to view devices and\nprinters at this point,\n\n176\n00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:55,800\nthere is my sales printer\nthat we just created.\n\n177\n00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,480\nAll right,\nnow let's go back over to the client.\n\n178\n00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:08,559\nAnd let's wake my client up,\nevidently he went to sleep.\n\n179\n00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,560\nSo we'll get this guy woke up.\n\n180\n00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,589\nAnd then the first thing I wanna do is,\n\n181\n00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:18,713\nI'm gonna show you by going through\nthe GUI, you know, making sure that that\n\n182\n00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:23,356\nprinter was published correctly, or that\nit did successfully publish that printer.\n\n183\n00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:26,640\nMm.\n\n184\n00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,530\nPassword.\n\n185\n00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:30,430\nKeep your fingers crossed.\n\n186\n00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,837\n[NOISE] First try, I like it.\n\n187\n00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:39,561\nAll right, so\nhere I am logged on to CL-1 and\n\n188\n00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:44,641\nif I go over to my control panel,\nand take a look at,\n\n189\n00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:49,389\nlet's just go to,\nview devices and printers.\n\n190\n00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,770\nThen I'm gonna click, add a printer.\n\n191\n00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,000\nAnd because I published,\nhopefully you guys can see that there,\n\n192\n00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,870\nbecause I published that, when I used\nthat command I used the -published,\n\n193\n00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,180\nyou can see that it made that object an\nactive directory, makes it very easy for\n\n194\n00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,630\nmy clients to find that printer and\nadd it if they want to.\n\n195\n00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,490\nSo there's my sales printer on server1.\n\n196\n00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,210\nWe don't use the stinking GUI, right?\n\n197\n00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,880\nWe wanna see how to do\nthis through PowerShell.\n\n198\n00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,990\nSo let's take a peek at those commands.\n\n199\n00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,620\nIt's actually a very easy command.\n\n200\n00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,780\nWe're gonna fire up PowerShell.\n\n201\n00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,830\nAnd all we really need\nto know is the UNC path,\n\n202\n00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,670\nthere's gonna be a parameter\ncalled connection name.\n\n203\n00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,214\nSo we're using the same command,\nadd-printer.\n\n204\n00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,090\nBut instead of adding all the information,\nI'm not adding the printer physically,\n\n205\n00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,220\nit's not attached to this machine, right?\n\n206\n00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,760\nSo I'm not going through and I'm not doing\nthe add port and the add drivers and\n\n207\n00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,810\nthings like that.\n\n208\n00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,880\nAll I need to know is, how do I connect\nto that printer via the network?\n\n209\n00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,670\nIt's already shared out.\n\n210\n00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,419\nSo, connection name, and\nthen the UNC path for that shared printer,\n\n211\n00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:58,330\nwhich is gonna be the name of the server\nback-slash name of the printer,\n\n212\n00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,249\nor the shared name of the printer, right?\n\n213\n00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:03,940\nWhich could be different from\nthe actual name of the printer.\n\n214\n00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,940\nIn this case, I called it salesprint.\n\n215\n00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,220\nAnd we'll hit enter and that's it.\n\n216\n00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,380\nThat's the command.\n\n217\n00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,857\nAnd give it a minute, this guy's\na little bit low on memory, so he seems.\n\n218\n00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:17,620\nThere we go, that's not too bad.\n\n219\n00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,240\nSo, no red text, means my command\nhopefully works successfully.\n\n220\n00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,140\nWe will find out.\n\n221\n00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,195\nLet's take a peek,\nI'm gonna go over to my Control Panel.\n\n222\n00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:37,490\nTake a look at my devices and printers,\nand again, this guy's a little bit slow.\n\n223\n00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,280\nThere it goes.\n\n224\n00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,470\nYou see it just popped up on my screen.\n\n225\n00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,100\nAnd eventually I'll actually get a check\nmark showing it as my default printer.\n\n226\n00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,767\nSo there it is, we now have\na printer installed on my client.\n\n227\n00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,625\nAll right, so\na few commands we ran through there,\n\n228\n00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:56,945\nwe added the driver itself to the server,\nwe created\n\n229\n00:13:56,945 --> 00:14:01,865\nthe port on the server, and\nthen we installed the actual printer.\n\n230\n00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:05,015\nThen we went over to the client,\nwe ran that add printer connection again,\n\n231\n00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:08,415\nthis time with just a -connection\nname parameter, and\n\n232\n00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,890\ngave it the UNC path for the printer.\n\n233\n00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,130\nSo, basic printer commands and\nthat's what we got.\n\n234\n00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,930\nAdding a printer to the print server,\nadding that printer to the client.\n\n235\n00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,760\nBut let's not stop there,\nwe got a few more things.\n\n236\n00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,364\nYou know,\nonce we've got that printer installed,\n\n237\n00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,765\nmore things that we can\ndo through PowerShell.\n\n238\n00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,370\nCuz we've got a lot of different commands\nthat we can use to manage these printers.\n\n239\n00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,340\nAs I was saying earlier, we can work\nwith the print jobs themselves.\n\n240\n00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,400\nWe can stop and start jobs and\nthings like that.\n\n241\n00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,680\nSo let's take a peek at a few\nof those commands here.\n\n242\n00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,257\nFrom the client, what I'm gonna do is, I'm\njust gonna print something real quick so\n\n243\n00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:48,920\nthat we have a job to work with.\n\n244\n00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:53,289\nSo let me make a quick\nlittle text document here.\n\n245\n00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,580\nWe'll call it print test.\n\n246\n00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:10,820\nAnd we'll do everybody's favorite,\nhello world, right?\n\n247\n00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,179\nWe'll save that file and\nthen let's print that file.\n\n248\n00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,680\nA little file print action and there's my\nprinter on server1, and I'll click print.\n\n249\n00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:34,030\nAll right, so at this point,\nI've got a print job over there,\n\n250\n00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,630\nshould be sitting in the queue\nof the printer on server1.\n\n251\n00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,752\nLet's switch back over to server1 and\nsee what we can find here.\n\n252\n00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:46,620\nAll right,\nfirst thing I'm going to want to do.\n\n253\n00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,460\nOh, one thing I did, well, I'll talk\nabout that here in just a second.\n\n254\n00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,220\nFirst thing I wanna do is,\nI wanna get a list of the print jobs.\n\n255\n00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,441\nIf I'm gonna work with a print\njob through PowerShell,\n\n256\n00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:58,669\nit's going to assign an ID\nto the different print jobs.\n\n257\n00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:02,545\nAnd so, if I wanna stop a job, or\ncancel a job, or restart a job, or\n\n258\n00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,751\nsomething like that,\nI'm gonna have to know that ID.\n\n259\n00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:12,408\nTo get the ID,\nit's a command called get-printjob.\n\n260\n00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:18,250\nAll right, it helps if you tell it what\nprinter you wanna get those jobs for.\n\n261\n00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,135\nLet's try it again,\n\n262\n00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:25,460\nget-printjob-printername and\nthen we called it sales print.\n\n263\n00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,050\nAnd here I can see a list of the different\njobs waiting on that printer.\n\n264\n00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,545\nSo there's the ID number that I\nwas referring to there, alright.\n\n265\n00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:41,955\nID number two,\nI can see that's coming from Notepad.\n\n266\n00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:44,635\nI don't think it shows me.\n\n267\n00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:45,855\nIt shows me my submitted time.\n\n268\n00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:47,425\nFor some reason it doesn't\nhave my computer name.\n\n269\n00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:50,675\nI'm not sure why it's not returning\nthe name of that computer.\n\n270\n00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:54,595\nBut now that I've got that ID,\nI can work with that particular print job.\n\n271\n00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:02,370\nAll right so if I wanted to say,\nlet's suspend that particular print job.\n\n272\n00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,440\nIf we wanted to pause it.\n\n273\n00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,211\nSuspend dash print job, all right.\n\n274\n00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:14,100\nYou gotta tell it what printer the job is\non and so that's gonna be printer name\n\n275\n00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:21,740\nAnd that's gonna be sales print, and\nthen I need the dash ID parameter.\n\n276\n00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,560\nThat's where I'm gonna specify which\nparticular job on this printer\n\n277\n00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,900\nI want to work with and\nin my case that's gonna be ID number two.\n\n278\n00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,390\nAnd we can see that no red text, meaning\nthat I did not, that it had no errors,\n\n279\n00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,160\nit should be printing.\n\n280\n00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,310\nIn fact if we do another get print job, I\n\n281\n00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,810\ncan see over here my job status that,\nthat job is now paused.\n\n282\n00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,650\nAll right, so\nyou could use this if you had\n\n283\n00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,520\na large print queue and you see a big\ndocument getting ready to be printed and\n\n284\n00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,680\nyou've got a bunch of small documents\nbehind it that you wanna go ahead and\n\n285\n00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,640\nallow to print you could\nsuspend that big print job.\n\n286\n00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,550\nLet those other ones finish, print,\nand then you can go back and\n\n287\n00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,180\nresume that print job.\n\n288\n00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,170\nSo once those smaller print jobs are\nprinted, how do we go about resuming it?\n\n289\n00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,320\nWell, same way we suspended it,\nwe just switch the verb.\n\n290\n00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,850\nAll right, remember with PowerShell,\nit's relatively easy to work with.\n\n291\n00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,350\nOnce you learn your different nouns,\n\n292\n00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,360\nyou're just changing the verb, what you\nwanna do with that particular noun.\n\n293\n00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,950\nSo in this case, we've got our\nprint job is gonna be our noun.\n\n294\n00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,070\nWe use the keyword or the verb\nsuspend to pause that print job, and\n\n295\n00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,760\nto resume it, you'll never guess\nwhat we're gonna use for a verb.\n\n296\n00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,010\nYes, resume, that's exactly right.\n\n297\n00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,880\nSo resume-printjob and\nthen the name of the printer,\n\n298\n00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,180\nso PrinterName,\ntell it what printer we're working with.\n\n299\n00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,690\nAnd that's sales print and\n\n300\n00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,000\nthen a -id, and id 2 for\nthat particular print job.\n\n301\n00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,250\nNo red text is a good thing.\n\n302\n00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,250\nWe take another look at our queue,\nwe can do a little get print job for\n\n303\n00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,270\nthat sales print printer.\n\n304\n00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,270\nAnd now I've got an error listed there,\nprobably cuz there is no printer, but\n\n305\n00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,170\nI can see over here in\nthe status that it is printing,\n\n306\n00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,080\neven though I've got\nan error listed there.\n\n307\n00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,370\nAnd that's just cuz we're\nlying to the computer.\n\n308\n00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,758\nI don't actually have a printer.\n\n309\n00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:21,310\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n310\n00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,540\nAnother thing you might wanna do\nwith a print job is cancel it.\n\n311\n00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,150\nWhat if somebody sent a big print job over\nthere and you don't want it to print or\n\n312\n00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,190\nthey didn't mean to print it or\n\n313\n00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,930\nthey started printing a 800-page\ndocument on your printer?\n\n314\n00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,760\nSo we can also remove a print job and\nsame thing, right.\n\n315\n00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,430\nWe're just changing the verb\nthat we're working with.\n\n316\n00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,850\nSame noun, print job.\n\n317\n00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,470\nWe're just going to change\nthe verb to remove.\n\n318\n00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,300\nSo remove-printjob.\n\n319\n00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,080\nLet's not remove the printer,\nremove-print job.\n\n320\n00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,843\nThe name of the printer that\nI wanna remove this job from.\n\n321\n00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:05,807\nAnd then the ID number of the print\njob that I'm trying to remove.\n\n322\n00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:13,690\nNo red text, we'll do a little get\nprint job to view our queue and\n\n323\n00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,165\nyou can see that the status is deleting.\n\n324\n00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:20,445\nI'll try to throw that out\nin a table here real quick.\n\n325\n00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:28,845\nAnd it didn't like that,\npiping it out into a table.\n\n326\n00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,245\nInteresting, maybe a list?\n\n327\n00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:36,560\nOh, don't like that one either.\n\n328\n00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,030\nAll right, so anyway, so we have,\nnow that we've got that printer installed,\n\n329\n00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,760\nwe've seen the commands we're gonna\nuse to take a look at the jobs, right?\n\n330\n00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,250\nGet that print job, name of the printer,\n\n331\n00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,210\ndash printer name,\nthat's gonna return the queue basically.\n\n332\n00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,055\nYou're gonna see all the jobs that\nare listed on that printer and\n\n333\n00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:53,250\ntheir current status.\n\n334\n00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,490\nYou want to pause a print job,\nwe use the verb suspend,\n\n335\n00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,490\nsuspend dash print job dash printer name,\nname of the printer.\n\n336\n00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,010\nAnd then dash ID, and the ID number of\nthat particular print job which we were\n\n337\n00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,650\nable to retrieve from the get-printjob\nwhich shows me all of those IDs.\n\n338\n00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,530\nAnd then we just change up the verb\ndepending on what we want to do.\n\n339\n00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:19,160\nIf we want to suspend that print job,\nif we want to restart that print job.\n\n340\n00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,490\nIf we want to resume that print job or\nif we want to remove that print job.\n\n341\n00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,090\nSo, we've seen commands that we can\nuse to actually set up the printer\n\n342\n00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,556\nInstall that printer on the print server.\n\n343\n00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:35,000\nWe created the port, we created\nthe driver, we created the printer.\n\n344\n00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,940\nWe added the printer to the client\nusing that add printer command and\n\n345\n00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,860\nthen dash connection name and\nthen giving it the UNC path.\n\n346\n00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,940\nAnd then we've seen how we can work with\nthe actual print jobs on the printer.\n\n347\n00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,582\nThe last thing that I wanna show you\nguys is to work with the spooler itself,\n\n348\n00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:52,200\nall right.\n\n349\n00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,280\nBut these commands are really, we're not\nusing the printer nouns in this case,\n\n350\n00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,900\nright, because the spooler is a service.\n\n351\n00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,360\nSo we're gonna work with it\njust like any other service.\n\n352\n00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,850\nSo if you want to stop a service, start a\nservice, restart a service, anything like\n\n353\n00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:10,070\nthat we're using our service now, and\nwe're just changing the verb, all right?\n\n354\n00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,400\nAnd the name of the service, is spooler.\n\n355\n00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,870\nSo if you weren't sure what the name of\nthat service was you can do a get-service,\n\n356\n00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,870\nand then you can slowly\nscroll through the list and\n\n357\n00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:27,700\nthen eventually find it or\nyou could Google it, right?\n\n358\n00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,510\nBut there is my spooler service,\nthere's my Print Spooler and\n\n359\n00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,320\nyou can see currently it is running.\n\n360\n00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,100\nSo if I wanna stop that or pause that,\n\n361\n00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,630\nwe can do a stop-service, and\nthen just the name of the service,\n\n362\n00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:51,160\nwhich in this case is spooler which is\nnot spelled like that, there we go.\n\n363\n00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,140\nAnd you know what I'm gonna do, let me\ntry to, I'm gonna start that back up.\n\n364\n00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,823\nTo start it,\nit's just gonna be start-service.\n\n365\n00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:08,280\nI'm going to change that up just a little\nbit, I think I've shown you guys or\n\n366\n00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,995\nwe've talked about this parameter in\nother shows or other segments here.\n\n367\n00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:15,945\nNow remember you've got that pass through,\none of the things about PowerShell\n\n368\n00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:20,555\nis it doesn't show you output typically\nif the command was successful, all right.\n\n369\n00:23:20,555 --> 00:23:24,550\nBut we've got that dash pass\nthrough A parameter that we can\n\n370\n00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,220\nadd to most of our commands that\nwill give us a little bit of output.\n\n371\n00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,090\nSo for example,\nif I use that with that same command,\n\n372\n00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,844\nI'm gonna do a stop-service spooler and\nthen, -passthru.\n\n373\n00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,270\nAnd what you'll see is instead of just not\nreturning anything and coming back to my\n\n374\n00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,740\nnormal prompt, I'm actually getting\nsome status on that particular service.\n\n375\n00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,606\nSo I can see that that status is stopped.\n\n376\n00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:56,131\nNow I could have done a get-service and\nthen spooler.\n\n377\n00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:02,886\nTo see that same information.\n\n378\n00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:06,860\nBut by adding that -passthrough I don't\nhave to run two separate commands.\n\n379\n00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,980\nAll right, so I can see that information.\n\n380\n00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,865\nIf we want to start that spooler\nservice back up we're going to\n\n381\n00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:19,145\nstart-service space spooler, and\nI'll do another passthrough.\n\n382\n00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,750\nAnd I can see my spooler\nservice is now running.\n\n383\n00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,440\nSo again, working with the spooler is\nreally just like working with any other\n\n384\n00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,640\nservice, we've got\nthe same verbs available.\n\n385\n00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:38,950\nI can restart that spooler service,\nrestart-service,\n\n386\n00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,810\nname of the service you want to restart.\n\n387\n00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,721\nI'll do a -passthrough, but\nit's really not gonna show me anything,\n\n388\n00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:49,465\nit's just gonna show me that it's running,\ncuz it's gonna stop it and then start it.\n\n389\n00:24:49,465 --> 00:24:52,275\nSo in the end the status\nshould remain running.\n\n390\n00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:53,665\nSometimes you know how those printers are.\n\n391\n00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:57,055\nYou gotta kick that spooler in the butt,\nget it going again, so\n\n392\n00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:59,665\nyou can restart that spooler service.\n\n393\n00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,735\nAnd then in the end,\nif I wanted to remove the printer,\n\n394\n00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,995\ndo I want to remove the printer now?\n\n395\n00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,260\nI think we're about done with this.\n\n396\n00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,990\nAnd so if I was done with that printer,\nI could do a remove printer.\n\n397\n00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,440\nI don't think I actually wanna remove it.\n\n398\n00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,700\nBut you can do a Remove-Printer, and\nthen the name of the printer-name.\n\n399\n00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:27,709\nAnd in this case, salesprint, and if I hit\nEnter, obviously I would lose my printer.\n\n400\n00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:28,600\nWhat the heck, let's do it.\n\n401\n00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:33,813\nDid I get an extra space in there or\nsomething?\n\n402\n00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,316\nYeah.\n\n403\n00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,250\nOh, that's my share name, sorry.\n\n404\n00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,160\nWhat did we call that?\n\n405\n00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,063\nSalesprinter?\n\n406\n00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:55,230\nIt's not liking that either.\n\n407\n00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,979\nBecause I would need quotes around that\nbecause there are spaces in there.\n\n408\n00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,760\nThere we go.\n\n409\n00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,940\nEventually we'll get that right.\n\n410\n00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,240\nSo remember when you're doing that\nremove command, you wanna use the name,\n\n411\n00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,290\nnot the share name.\n\n412\n00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,360\nRight, I shared it out as salesprint.\n\n413\n00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,590\nBut the actual name of\nthe printer was salesprinter.\n\n414\n00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,500\nSo when you do that -name parameter there,\n\n415\n00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,410\nyou wanna use the actual\nname of the printer.\n\n416\n00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,130\nIf it's got spaces in it,\ndon't forget to delimit those,\n\n417\n00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,070\notherwise PowerShell sees it as\na single word and then looks at that\n\n418\n00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,750\nsecond word as a new command and\nit doesn't know what to do with it.\n\n419\n00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,110\nAll right, ladies and\n\n420\n00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,140\ngentlemen, those are the commands we\ncan use to work with our printers.\n\n421\n00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,220\nAgain, there's more.\n\n422\n00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,500\nI'll shoot that link to you guys\nout there in the show notes,\n\n423\n00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,240\nthere's a lot of other things\nwe can do with the printer.\n\n424\n00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,690\nOne thing we didn't talk\nabout was permissions and\n\n425\n00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,200\nlet's hit that real quick\nbefore we call this a segment.\n\n426\n00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,380\nWith the printer permissions,\n\n427\n00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,270\nwe can configure the printer\npermissions using PowerShell.\n\n428\n00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,890\nYou're gonna be setting up what they\ncall it the, you're gonna use SDDL or\n\n429\n00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,240\nthe security descriptor\ndefinition language.\n\n430\n00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,024\nA little beyond the scope\nof this particular segment.\n\n431\n00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:11,710\nIt's the same thing I would use if I\nwas setting permissions on files and\n\n432\n00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,504\nfolders though from PowerShell.\n\n433\n00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:16,766\nAnd if I remember right, I might have\nmade a link for us here for that.\n\n434\n00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,900\nOr maybe it's on my notes here.\n\n435\n00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,420\nLet's pull that up just real quick.\n\n436\n00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,870\nI'll show you guys what I'm talking about.\n\n437\n00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,230\nSomewhere I've got that link.\n\n438\n00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,930\nThere it is.\n\n439\n00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,097\nSo these, as you can see,\nthese are in my show notes already so\n\n440\n00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:38,287\nI'll make sure you guys have those.\n\n441\n00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,230\nAll right.\n\n442\n00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,080\nAnd this was just a link out\nagain back to Microsoft and\n\n443\n00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,010\nyou can see here that when you're working\nwith these security descriptors from\n\n444\n00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,190\nPowerShell, there is the syntax for\n\n445\n00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,430\nsetting that, your ace_type,\nyour different flags that you want to set.\n\n446\n00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,416\nNow what permissions you want to assign,\nthe GUID that you're assigning these\n\n447\n00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,700\npermissions over, so\nthe object GUID, the identifier for\n\n448\n00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,870\nthat printer in this case, whether\nit's gonna inherit permissions, and\n\n449\n00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,237\nthen the SID, the account SID that\nyou're assigning the permissions to.\n\n450\n00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:21,595\nAnd they give you this good reference.\n\n451\n00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:25,165\nIt's got all the different options\nthat you can use, like the Ace Types.\n\n452\n00:28:26,615 --> 00:28:28,655\nAlso, the flags are contained here.\n\n453\n00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:30,915\nWe've got the different\nrights that you can assign.\n\n454\n00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,320\nAnd then of course, it's not gonna know\nthe GUIDs for your particular objects or\n\n455\n00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,660\nanything like that.\n\n456\n00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,520\nAnd then our resource\nattributes that we can specify.\n\n457\n00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,450\nSo you can do it,\n\n458\n00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,180\nyou can specify permissions on\nthose printers using PowerShell.\n\n459\n00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,030\nThat might be something that we'd wanna\nscript because that's gonna be a pretty\n\n460\n00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,950\ncomplex command to write out and\n\n461\n00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,102\na lot of times you wanna use the same\npermissions on multiple printers.\n\n462\n00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:56,435\nSo that'd be a really good one to save and\nnot have to type out manually each time\n\n463\n00:28:56,435 --> 00:29:00,100\ncuz it's typically gonna involve coming in\nand doing some research, making sure you\n\n464\n00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,400\nget those flags set up correctly and\nthe permissions set up properly.\n\n465\n00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,760\nSave that out as a script.\n\n466\n00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:10,145\nAnd then whenever you create a new\nprinter, you can just throw that on there.\n\n467\n00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:13,561\nAll right, so I hope you guys\nenjoyed this segment and stay tuned,\n\n468\n00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:14,905\nwe'll be back with more.\n\n469\n00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:22,530\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14,130\ndata stored in a file\nfrom within PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,027\nLike it gets kind of confusing fast there,\ndoesn't it?\n\n5\n00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:17,090\n>> [LAUGH] It does.\n\n6\n00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,260\n>> What I mean is,\ntaking data from the PowerShell screen and\n\n7\n00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,830\noutputting that into a file.\n\n8\n00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,020\nOr, the opposite way around,\n\n9\n00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,410\ntaking data from a file and\ninputting that into PowerShell commands.\n\n10\n00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,100\nIt's a pretty useful\nthing to be able to do.\n\n11\n00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,620\n>> Yeah, it really is.\n\n12\n00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,250\nThere's a lot of times where you run a\ncommand in PowerShell, and it'll spit out\n\n13\n00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,020\na whole bunch of information, but\nI wanna save that information.\n\n14\n00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,610\nI wanna keep it in a file for\nfuture reference, or I wanna\n\n15\n00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,970\nrun that command every so often and have\na running record of what's been going on.\n\n16\n00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,410\nSo one of the commands we wanna\ntake a look at is gonna be\n\n17\n00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,160\nto put it out to a file.\n\n18\n00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,890\nThe command is simply out-file.\n\n19\n00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,170\nLet me pull up my machine here.\n\n20\n00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,650\nAnd in PowerShell,\nwe’ll do a getprocess command.\n\n21\n00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,505\nThat’ll spill out of lot information, and\nyou guys remember that from the other day.\n\n22\n00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:01,618\nIf we do a get process.\n\n23\n00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:07,885\nIt's gonna list all the processes that\nare currently running on this machine.\n\n24\n00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:11,735\nNow if I wanted to save this information,\nwe're gonna dump this out to a file,\n\n25\n00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:16,340\nlet me get my, PowerShell maximize there.\n\n26\n00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,770\nSo we can take that same command.\n\n27\n00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,720\nWe can do another get process, and we're\njust gonna pipe that out into an out-file.\n\n28\n00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,836\nWe'll do a little out-file.\n\n29\n00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,230\nAnd the parameters for\nthat one is just the file path.\n\n30\n00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,840\nYou got to tell it where you\nwant to store that file.\n\n31\n00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,168\nSo I'm gonna do a -filepath, and\nI've got a folder created on my F drive,\n\n32\n00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:38,545\nhopefully I created that this morning.\n\n33\n00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:40,845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We will find out, let's see.\n\n34\n00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:42,160\nYep, doing a tab auto filled.\n\n35\n00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,890\nSo scripts, and then the name of\nthe file that you wanna create.\n\n36\n00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,941\nWe'll call it something like processes.\n\n37\n00:01:52,643 --> 00:01:53,200\nRight.\n\n38\n00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,880\n>> Sweet.\n\n39\n00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,380\n>> That's it.\n\n40\n00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,370\nAnd it's that simple.\n\n41\n00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,910\nSo we go take a look on my F drive and\nscripts.\n\n42\n00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,220\nI've got a file called processes,\nand there we go.\n\n43\n00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,230\nSo that's the first thing,\n\n44\n00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,320\nis just to simply dump the results of\nthat command out into a text file.\n\n45\n00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,240\nNext thing I want to show you with\nthis command is, what's gonna happen.\n\n46\n00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,590\nWhat if that file name already exists?\n\n47\n00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,522\nLike let's say I ran that today and\nthen tomorrow I want to come in and\n\n48\n00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:17,560\nrun that same command.\n\n49\n00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,742\nIf I go back over here to PowerShell,\nand try to run that same command,\n\n50\n00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:27,220\nit's gonna run the command, and if we\ntake a look it will end up overwriting.\n\n51\n00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,977\nI guess there's really\nnothing to show you.\n\n52\n00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:30,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's gonna overwrite that existing\n\n53\n00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,341\nfile and that might not be what you want.\n\n54\n00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,140\nRight?\n\n55\n00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,790\nSo there is a switch that'll prevent that\nif you don't know that the file exists,\n\n56\n00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,330\nif the file exists already or\nnot, or if you know it exists and\n\n57\n00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,990\nyou don't want to replace it,\nyou can do what's called a NoClobber.\n\n58\n00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,160\nI kinda like the name of that.\n\n59\n00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,109\nNoClobber, if I run that with\nthe NoClobber parameter,\n\n60\n00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:50,700\nyou'll see I get an error.\n\n61\n00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,050\nSo it's telling me here that\nthe processes.txt already exists and\n\n62\n00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,577\nit's not gonna overwrite that file.\n\n63\n00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:02,069\nThe other thing we can do with this\ncommand is, maybe I do want to,\n\n64\n00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,500\nI wanna run that process every day,\nbut I wanna keep a running total, or\n\n65\n00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,400\nI wanna compile that data up.\n\n66\n00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,290\nSo we can actually append that data\nto the end of an existing file.\n\n67\n00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,810\nAnd all you’re gonna do is add, you’re\ngonna go ahead and the NoClobber option,\n\n68\n00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,250\nand then we’re gonna add another\nparameter called Append.\n\n69\n00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:20,920\nHandy enough.\n\n70\n00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,400\nSo I run that and\nyou see this time I don't get an error.\n\n71\n00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,642\nIf I go look at that file,\nclose the other one.\n\n72\n00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:34,750\nWe'll see I should have\ntwo sets of results.\n\n73\n00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,490\nLet's say I left the first set of results\nfrom the first time I run the command.\n\n74\n00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,030\nAnd then it just added\nto the end of that file\n\n75\n00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,060\nthe output from that second\ntime I run that command.\n\n76\n00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,180\n>> And now, when you use the out-file\ncommand like Mike is doing,\n\n77\n00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,430\nnotice it’s not manipulating\nthe output in any way.\n\n78\n00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,490\nIt’s showing exactly what\nwould’ve been on the screen, but\n\n79\n00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,580\ninstead putting it in\na file on the hard drive.\n\n80\n00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,160\nAnd there is an alias for this that's put\nin place which is the greater than symbol.\n\n81\n00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,710\nSo if Mike had run like get-process and\nthen a greater than symbol and\n\n82\n00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,188\na file name, it's the same thing and\nthat's just an alias for Alt-file.\n\n83\n00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:10,620\nThe advantage of Alt-file is\nyou get the other options.\n\n84\n00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,508\nThe -NoClobber.\n\n85\n00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:13,190\n>> Right.\n>> The -Append, so you see those.\n\n86\n00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,000\nSo if you're watching this show and\nyou're thinking,\n\n87\n00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,965\noh why did Mike type that long command?\n\n88\n00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,298\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well it's to get the full power of\n\n89\n00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,229\nthe options that are there.\n\n90\n00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:20,440\n>> Exactly.\n\n91\n00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,870\n>> The other thing is if\nyou do want to manipulate\n\n92\n00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,850\nthe way this is being represented here\nin the text file you can and if you\n\n93\n00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,910\nhaven't watched it already we recorded a\nsegment called, Formatting Command Output.\n\n94\n00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,668\nI think it was, what was that?\n\n95\n00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:38,150\nLike 1.8 if you look at\nthe numbers on the episodes.\n\n96\n00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,900\nAnd in that show, or in that segment,\nI demonstrated how you could\n\n97\n00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,866\nuse export-csv as well as convert-html.\n\n98\n00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,562\nI'll make sure I got those right.\n\n99\n00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,860\nYes, it's convert2-html,\n\n100\n00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,700\nif you use those commands in conjunction\nwith Mike's, it'll output the text file.\n\n101\n00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,270\nBut it can format it as HTML.\n\n102\n00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,722\nSo it'll render in a web browser or\nit'll output it as a CSV a comma-separated\n\n103\n00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:06,142\nvalues, so you can then import it into\nspreadsheet software, or whatever.\n\n104\n00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,010\n>> RIght.\n>> So you can do some really cool stuff\n\n105\n00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,970\nwith this.\n\n106\n00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,740\nBut at it's basics, out-file stores\nit right there in text file and\n\n107\n00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,360\nnow you've got that record,\nyou can store it, save it, use it.\n\n108\n00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,140\nWhatever.\n>> Yeah, that hard copy.\n\n109\n00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,370\nAll right.\nSo that's taking the data that's being\n\n110\n00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,210\nreturned from our command and\nit's dumping it out into the file.\n\n111\n00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,290\nAnother thing we want might want to do is\nwe might wanna take data that's already in\n\n112\n00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,350\na file and bring that into PowerShell.\n\n113\n00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,088\nAnd we'll start out\nwith a very simple one.\n\n114\n00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:33,850\nWe're just gonna dump the contents\nof a file onto the screen here.\n\n115\n00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,112\nAnd that's gonna be get-content.\n\n116\n00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,422\nAnd then the path to the file,\nso in my case,\n\n117\n00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:42,104\nI've got a file over\non that F drive again.\n\n118\n00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:47,180\nWe'll see if I can find it, there it is.\n\n119\n00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,029\nAnd I'm just gonna pipe that, so\nthat command there, get-content,\n\n120\n00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:53,820\nis gonna go read that file and\ngrab the data that's in that file.\n\n121\n00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,480\nSo now it's got that information,\nwhat do I wanna do with it?\n\n122\n00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,070\nThis time I wanna put it out and I wanna\ndisplay it in my PowerShell Window, and\n\n123\n00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,010\nthat's just gonna be out-string.\n\n124\n00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,940\nAnd I hit that, and the text file was\njust a simple list of computer names, and\n\n125\n00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,290\nthere it dumped it out to the screen.\n\n126\n00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,890\nSo if you ever want to display\na file information in PowerShell for\n\n127\n00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,340\nsome reason, pretty simple to do but\nwe can take that a step further.\n\n128\n00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,540\nIf we wanna get a little more complex with\nour commands cuz the usefulness of that,\n\n129\n00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,540\nnot really practical.\n\n130\n00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,340\nRight?\n\n131\n00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,400\nSo if we wanna,\n\n132\n00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,870\nmaybe we've got a list of computers\nwe wanna do something with that list.\n\n133\n00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,220\nRight?\nUse that information.\n\n134\n00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,850\nI think Don's got us a good\nexample here for that.\n\n135\n00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,040\n>> All right, so let me show you guys\na practical application of this.\n\n136\n00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,980\nI've got a Windows server machine here and\nif I take a look at it.\n\n137\n00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,800\nMaybe I want to install some\nkind of feature or role.\n\n138\n00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,480\nRight?\nI'll just pick an easy one\n\n139\n00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,210\nas an example like the Telnet client.\n\n140\n00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,980\nSo if I look I don't have the Telnet\nclient installed on this server.\n\n141\n00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,840\nWell if I want to install it,\n\n142\n00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,745\nI know that I can do the add-Windows\nfeature command and I can add it in.\n\n143\n00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:56,230\nRight?\nOr I could do the GUI,\n\n144\n00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,790\njust go into server manager and add it.\n\n145\n00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,610\nBut what if I wanted to install\nthe Telnet client on 100 servers or\n\n146\n00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,010\n1000 servers or if I wanted to make\nthis part of my routine build operation.\n\n147\n00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,032\nWhen I build up new servers,\nI want that to be there.\n\n148\n00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:09,060\nAll right?\n\n149\n00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,790\nWell, what I could do is I\ncould create a text file that\n\n150\n00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,600\nhad a list of all of the servers\nI wanted to install to.\n\n151\n00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,990\nAnd I could put in there\nwho I wanted to install to.\n\n152\n00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,360\nAnd then, I could read from that file,\nand run a script against it.\n\n153\n00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,150\nExecuting that script against each and\nevery machine in the file.\n\n154\n00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,090\nAll right.\n\n155\n00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,240\nLet me show you an example, so\n\n156\n00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,458\nyou can see how this works I'm gonna\nfire up a PowerShell window here.\n\n157\n00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:37,910\nAnd my fonts is going a little\nmicroscopic on me here.\n\n158\n00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,820\nSo let me bump that up.\n\n159\n00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,910\nBut basically I've got a text file,\n\n160\n00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,890\nand I'm just gonna put some host names\nin there, nothing too crazy or fancy.\n\n161\n00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,820\nLet me get into my scripts folder.\n\n162\n00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,930\nIf I can type it.\n\n163\n00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,030\nThere we go.\n\n164\n00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,310\nAnd I've made a file\njust called hosts.txt.\n\n165\n00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,450\nAnd what you would do,\n\n166\n00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,320\nis you would just put in whatever\nhosts that you wanted to install to.\n\n167\n00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,140\nYou could just add them right in here.\n\n168\n00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,890\nAnd for the sake of this example,\nI've just got my one machine, server01.\n\n169\n00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,150\nSo I just put in localhost server01,\nit's really just the same server over and\n\n170\n00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,220\nover and over again.\n\n171\n00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,640\nWell, it will only install the role or\nfeature once.\n\n172\n00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,140\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n173\n00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,098\n>> It wont do it over and over and over.\n\n174\n00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:17,180\nBut you could put as many computers\nin this list as you wanted.\n\n175\n00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,610\nAnd if you didn't have that file\nyou could whip one up real quick.\n\n176\n00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,420\nYou could use like Notepad.\n\n177\n00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,590\nAnd it's just a straight up\nlist of the servers we want,\n\n178\n00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,142\njust like Mike had in his example.\n\n179\n00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:27,360\nAll right?\n\n180\n00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,600\nBut then I've written a little PowerShell\nscript here called install-telnet.\n\n181\n00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,580\nAnd if I pull that up,\nit's pretty simple in what it does.\n\n182\n00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,170\nIt creates a variable\ncalled dollar sign hosts.\n\n183\n00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,810\nAnd then I use that\nget-content that Mike showed.\n\n184\n00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,880\n>> There's that same command.\n\n185\n00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,750\nRight?\n>> And it's gonna read whatever that\n\n186\n00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,565\nfile is, into that variable.\n\n187\n00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:48,250\n>> Yeah, so\ninstead of dumping it out on the screen,\n\n188\n00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,280\nwe're actually gonna store that\ninformation in that variable.\n\n189\n00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,190\n>> And then we can call invoke command.\n\n190\n00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,600\nInvoke command lets you run commands\nremotely on other systems and\n\n191\n00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,394\nI'm gonna say Invoke-Command\n-ComputerName $hosts.\n\n192\n00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:03,780\nRight?\nI'm gonna run a command on each\n\n193\n00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,210\nof the hosts listed in that variable\nwhich is coming from that file.\n\n194\n00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,000\nAnd then I'm gonna run a script block.\n\n195\n00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,321\nAnd in that script block,\nI can put whatever I want.\n\n196\n00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:13,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> As big a script as I need.\n\n197\n00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,920\nIn my case, I'm just saying,\nAdd-WindowsFeature Telnet-Client.\n\n198\n00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,510\nRight?\nSo,\n\n199\n00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,850\nthis is gonna run through for\neach of the hosts in that file.\n\n200\n00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,450\nWhen I'm done.\n\n201\n00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,465\nI can execute that.\n\n202\n00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:25,009\nRight?\n\n203\n00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:28,010\nNow, I do need to have windows\nremote management enabled on\n\n204\n00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,420\nthe other servers to connect\nto them with invoke command.\n\n205\n00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,880\nAnd I need to have my script execution\npolicy set here to be able to run scripts\n\n206\n00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,990\nin the first place.\n\n207\n00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,470\nBut assuming that we've done all that,\nI can run my script.\n\n208\n00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,540\nAnd it's gonna execute and it's gonna\nreach out to each server in that list.\n\n209\n00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,900\nIt's reading that text file.\n\n210\n00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,370\nSo, I'm getting my input\nfrom the file system and\n\n211\n00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,390\nthen I'm starting to work with\nthat data and running through.\n\n212\n00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,920\nAnd I can see I'm starting my installation\nthat's because it's running right on me.\n\n213\n00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,870\nAnd then it's gonna try and\nrun over and over again on myself.\n\n214\n00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,100\nCuz remember I did local host,\nI did server01, and\n\n215\n00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,710\nI put them in more than once.\n\n216\n00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,350\nWell the first time, it actually did have\nto install it, but on the other ones,\n\n217\n00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,240\nit was already installed,\nso it just says, success,\n\n218\n00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,880\nsuccess, success, it's already done.\n\n219\n00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,200\nBut it would run through and\ninstall on each of those different nodes.\n\n220\n00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,892\nNow, if I fire up a command prompt.\n\n221\n00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:18,389\nIf it ever comes up, there we go.\n\n222\n00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can see I've got Telnet installed.\n\n223\n00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,340\nRight?\n\n224\n00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,530\nSo.\n>> That's powerful stuff there.\n\n225\n00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,450\nI mean really because think about it.\n\n226\n00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,940\n>> It really is.\n>> That, you can write all these different\n\n227\n00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,690\nscripts if your job was to roll out new\nservers all the time, you've gotta install\n\n228\n00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,880\nDNS or DHCP or whatever, get your\nbaseline configuration you wanna do.\n\n229\n00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,390\nYou could write this script,\ntake some time, write that script.\n\n230\n00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,690\nAnd then every time you roll out another\nten servers you just change your\n\n231\n00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,245\ntext file.\n\n232\n00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:40,831\nRight?\nYou're just making a text file with\n\n233\n00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:43,288\nthe name of those computers, and\nyou just pull that file in there.\n\n234\n00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,410\n>> Yeah.\n>> Very powerful.\n\n235\n00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,854\n>> It can be useful, ever if you're\nonly doing something on one server.\n\n236\n00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,570\nRight?\nLet's say I got ten different scripts, and\n\n237\n00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,040\nI'm gonna be running them\nall on this one server.\n\n238\n00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,950\nBut then I want to take those ten scripts\nand go to another server and run them.\n\n239\n00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,630\nWhat if I want to edit all ten scripts\nto reflect the new server name.\n\n240\n00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,210\nSo I could have one file called host.txt,\nor whatever you wanna call it, and\n\n241\n00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,020\nyou put the computer name there, and\n\n242\n00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,850\nall ten of your other scripts\njust read from that one file.\n\n243\n00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,680\nSo now when you want to port it from\nsystem to system you can just edit that\n\n244\n00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,930\none file and all the other scripts\nfeed from it and they're fine.\n\n245\n00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,310\nRight?\nSo, pretty cool stuff and\n\n246\n00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,652\ndefinitely something you'll see\nout there in the real world.\n\n247\n00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:21,195\n>> And PowerShell has all the other\ncommands that you used to using from\n\n248\n00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:23,275\nthe command prompt like\ncreating directories and\n\n249\n00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:26,015\nmoving files and copying and\nthings like that.\n\n250\n00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,775\nSo we'll throw a link in\nthe show notes for that as well.\n\n251\n00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:29,275\n>> Yeah.\n\n252\n00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:33,665\nWe covered some of that in just the\nregular navigation segments that we filmed\n\n253\n00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:37,602\non PowerShell, but the you don't want\nto loiter on something really easy.\n\n254\n00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:40,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but that stuff is out there.\n\n255\n00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,700\nAll right.\nSo in this segment,\n\n256\n00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,090\nwe got a chance to see how to\ntake data from PowerShell and\n\n257\n00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,070\noutput it to a text file.\n\n258\n00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,810\nAnd we got a chance to see\nhow to take a text file and\n\n259\n00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,900\ninput that into the PowerShell, and some\nof the different ways we can use that.\n\n260\n00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,360\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n261\n00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,590\nIt's something that you'll have fun with.\n\n262\n00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,240\nAll right.\n\n263\n00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,710\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n264\n00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,290\nStay tuned.\n\n265\n00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,351\nWe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n266\n00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:06,769\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,234\n[SOUND] In this segment we're gonna take\n\n2\n00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:13,333\na look at managing the Window's\nfirewall from Powershell.\n\n3\n00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,542\nNow the windows firewall was introduced\nalong time ago, right back in windows XP.\n\n4\n00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:20,617\nBut the powershell is newer, and so\nMicrosoft has steadily been adding more\n\n5\n00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:22,405\ncommands in there to be\nable to work with it.\n\n6\n00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:26,490\nBut it is a good idea to get used to it,\nit is a great way to automate things.\n\n7\n00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,510\nWhen you're deploying software and\nnew servers, you'll often times want to:\n\n8\n00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,570\nenable or disable the firewall, depending,\nright, and then create or modify\n\n9\n00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,700\nrules within the firewall to be able\nto access the stuff you need to access.\n\n10\n00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,640\nSo that's what were going to take\na look at right here in this segment.\n\n11\n00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,210\nNow one of the first things that we'll\nwant to do is make sure that the firewall\n\n12\n00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,690\nis turned on.\n\n13\n00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,870\nDon't assume that it is,\nunless you installed the server,\n\n14\n00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,190\nit is installed by default.\n\n15\n00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,900\nBut somebody else might\nhave turned it off.\n\n16\n00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,295\nSo we can always quickly turn that on or\noff and remember,\n\n17\n00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:01,245\nwith the firewall that we have\nscopes to deal with, right.\n\n18\n00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:02,455\nWhat are the default ones?\n\n19\n00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:03,395\nThere's domain.\n\n20\n00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:06,345\n>> Domain, private and then public.\n\n21\n00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:09,795\n>> So, when somebody plugs into a network\nfor the first time it's gonna detect as\n\n22\n00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,815\none of those three,\nit gives them the option to pick.\n\n23\n00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:15,370\nAnd so we have different firewall\nsettings for each of those scopes.\n\n24\n00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,950\nSo you can manage them as a whole or\nyou can manage them individually.\n\n25\n00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,160\nSo these are all things that kind of\ncomplicate working with the firewall\n\n26\n00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,830\nfrom the PowerShell.\n\n27\n00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,110\n>> Right.\n>> All right, well one of the commands\n\n28\n00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,990\nthat I'm used to, just a quick and\ndirty make sure the firewall is turned on,\n\n29\n00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,590\nis a nice little simple one\nthat we'll start with here,\n\n30\n00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,052\nwhich is the set-net\nfirewall profile command.\n\n31\n00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:40,660\nSo set, anytime you see set,\nthat means we're changing a setting.\n\n32\n00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,310\nAnd everything we need is nested under\nSet-NetFirewall\\Profile, there we go.\n\n33\n00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,620\nSometimes Tab autocomplete is faster,\nsometimes it's painful, but basically\n\n34\n00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,340\neverything that we need Well, for\nthe most part, is right here under this.\n\n35\n00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,030\nAnd like the name implies,\nwe're saying, set net firewall, so\n\n36\n00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,170\nwe're working with the firewall.\n\n37\n00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,345\n>> Right.\n>> But profile, right?\n\n38\n00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:03,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It expects us to make changes\n\n39\n00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,730\nbased on a profile basis.\n\n40\n00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,400\nSo is this a change to the domain firewall\npolicy, or the public firewall policy?\n\n41\n00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,755\nOr the private home.\n\n42\n00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or whatever they call it these days.\n\n43\n00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,380\nAll right, for me, I'm gonna say all.\n\n44\n00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,360\nI wanna modify all of\nthe scopes in one fell swoop.\n\n45\n00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,920\nI want my firewall turned on so\n-all -enabled.\n\n46\n00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,610\nWhich I will set to true.\n\n47\n00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,950\nThat's gonna make sure that\nmy firewall is turned on for\n\n48\n00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,600\nall of the various scopes\nthat are involved.\n\n49\n00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,790\nAnd I could follow that up with a get-net.\n\n50\n00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,060\nThere's so\nmany commands that start with net.\n\n51\n00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,460\nI gotta stop doing that.\n\n52\n00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,500\nBut we can go with\na get-net firewall profile.\n\n53\n00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,040\nAnd it'll return the various\ninformation there, and\n\n54\n00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,350\nyou can see whether they're enabled or\nnot.\n\n55\n00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,130\nAnd, you know, here I'll just\nquick format that as a table,\n\n56\n00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,085\nbecause right here I can see domain,\nprivate and public,\n\n57\n00:02:58,085 --> 00:03:02,210\njust like Mike said, and enabled\nstatus is now set true on each one.\n\n58\n00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,780\n>> Alright.\n>> Alright, so quick and\n\n59\n00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,440\neasy way to verify whether our\nfirewall is enabled or not.\n\n60\n00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,880\nIf we wanted to turn the firewall off\nmaybe I don't want the firewall for\n\n61\n00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,130\nmy domain network.\n\n62\n00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,760\nRight?\n\n63\n00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,740\nLet domain machines\nconnect however they want.\n\n64\n00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,090\nI'm not saying that's a great idea.\n\n65\n00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,850\n>> Right.\n>> I'm just saying-\n\n66\n00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,800\n>> I'm going to go ahead and\n\n67\n00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,710\ntry that at home.\n\n68\n00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,950\n>> But\nDon said just turn the firewall off.\n\n69\n00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,130\n>> We don't need it.\n\n70\n00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,270\n>> I love it when I read-\n>> How to's and\n\n71\n00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,210\nsuggestions on the internet and people are\nlike, oh, you want to get that working?\n\n72\n00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,020\nSure.\nStep one.\n\n73\n00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,581\nTurn off your firewall.\n\n74\n00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was like, well, all right.\n\n75\n00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,180\nThat's kind of pointless.\n\n76\n00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,220\n>> Skip from that one.\n\n77\n00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,970\n>> Stop reading right there.\n\n78\n00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,710\nBut what we could have\ndone is come through and\n\n79\n00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,545\ninstead of like -all, we could have\nspecified a particular profile, right?\n\n80\n00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:43,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n81\n00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,740\n>> So if I want my domain profile\nnot to have the firewall,\n\n82\n00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,820\nI could go and\ndisable that just for that one.\n\n83\n00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,710\nAnd what you would do is instead of -all,\nyou would say -name followed by the name,\n\n84\n00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,449\nso I'll say domain.\n\n85\n00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,530\nAnd instead of -enable true I'll\nchange that to -enable false.\n\n86\n00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,746\nSo the full command reads,\nset -netfirewallprofile\n\n87\n00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,960\n-name domain -enable False.\n\n88\n00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,540\nAnd, I put false in quote marks, I don't\nthink you have to cuz it's a single word,\n\n89\n00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,330\nbut I'll do it anyway.\n\n90\n00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,090\nSo, there it's set, and now when I\nrun my get dash net firewall profile,\n\n91\n00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,140\nI can look and I can see that the firewall\nis turned off from my domain network.\n\n92\n00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,900\nBut turned on for private and public.\n\n93\n00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,780\nNow on a server, your server is normally\nonly plugged into one network and\n\n94\n00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,560\nit's not moving.\n\n95\n00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,240\nIt's just there and that's the end of it\nbut on a laptop this may be different.\n\n96\n00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,210\nSo, at home you might be on your private\nnetwork and then you get to work and\n\n97\n00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,280\nyour on your domain network.\n\n98\n00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,180\nThen you go to Starbucks and\nyou're on your public.\n\n99\n00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,050\nSo you're moving between these\ndifferent scopes all the time.\n\n100\n00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,953\nSo that makes a lot more sense on a mobile\ndevice than like a desktop or server.\n\n101\n00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:54,100\nAlright, now those are real\nhigh level commands.\n\n102\n00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,920\nJust modifying whether\nthe firewall is running or not.\n\n103\n00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,240\nThe default firewall rules that Microsoft\ncreates are usually suitable for\n\n104\n00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,450\nmost end users.\n\n105\n00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,680\nBut if you're running a server,\nyou're gonna need to change that.\n\n106\n00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,350\nYour server's gonna be running some kind\nof application that you want your end\n\n107\n00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,790\nusers to have access to.\n\n108\n00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,230\nAnd you'll need to add exceptions to the\nfirewall to allow those people to come in.\n\n109\n00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,630\nAnd that's what we want\nto take a look at next.\n\n110\n00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,350\n>> Right.\n\n111\n00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,630\nAnd the commands can get a little long.\n\n112\n00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,580\nThese are really good ones\nto write out a Scripts.\n\n113\n00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,590\nSo if you're setting up a DNS server,\n\n114\n00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,140\na DHCP server, you can write out\nthese commands, same as a script.\n\n115\n00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,710\nAnd every time you ever set up a new\nserver, you just fire up that script, and\n\n116\n00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,530\nyou can set up all your firewall rules for\nthat particular service.\n\n117\n00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,770\n>> Yeah, if you want to view your firewall\nrules, see what's already in there,\n\n118\n00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,070\nyou can do a get dash\nnet firewall rule and\n\n119\n00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,220\nwhen you run that command,\nyou'll get all your firewall rules.\n\n120\n00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,510\n>> You might want to use\na more switch with that one.\n\n121\n00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,960\n>> There's one or\ntwo rules created by default.\n\n122\n00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,190\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n123\n00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,560\n>> And they're not all enabled.\n\n124\n00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,500\nThat's the other thing,\n\n125\n00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,500\nthat if you look, like this very last\none right here you can see enable false.\n\n126\n00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,650\n>> False, yeah.\n\n127\n00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,540\n>> Microsoft just created a bunch of rules\nin there that fit a standard use case but\n\n128\n00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,080\nthey know that not everybody needs them so\nsome of them are disabled,\n\n129\n00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,950\nsome of them are enabled but there are a\nlot of them and that means you'll probably\n\n130\n00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,250\nwant to use search modifiers to be\nable to find exactly what you want.\n\n131\n00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,500\nOr at a minimum it would have looked\na little better if I would have done\n\n132\n00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,410\nformat table but I guess you get less\noutput when you do format table.\n\n133\n00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,480\nYou can see all of the different\nones that are in there and\n\n134\n00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,750\nthe pieces of their names and stuff.\n\n135\n00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,800\nThere's a lot that's in there.\n\n136\n00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,230\nI've kind of gotten to\nthe point where there's so\n\n137\n00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,640\nmany in there that I don't\neven bother looking anymore.\n\n138\n00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,040\nIf I wanna open something on the firewall,\nI just create my own rule.\n\n139\n00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,085\n>> Just create your own, exactly.\n\n140\n00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:38,561\n>> And just kind of ignore\nwhat's already in there.\n\n141\n00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:41,840\nWhat did I do to gen- Oh I\naccidentally pasted my clipboard text.\n\n142\n00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,310\nSo anyhow, so if we want to go in and\ncreate our own rule, it's easy enough.\n\n143\n00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,970\n>> But there is something\nwe need to keep in mind.\n\n144\n00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,890\nWhen you create a firewall rule, you're\ncreating an exception to the firewall.\n\n145\n00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,730\nAnd that exception is usually going\nto be based one of two things.\n\n146\n00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,250\nIt's either going to be based\non the program that's running.\n\n147\n00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,260\nSo you say this program is allowed\nto communicate however it wants.\n\n148\n00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,550\nOr it's based on a particular port number.\n\n149\n00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,460\nSo, in the show nodes, I use\nan example of the FileZilla FTP server.\n\n150\n00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,950\nSo, I've got FileZilla FTP\nserver installed on my machine.\n\n151\n00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,510\nI want people to be able to\nconnect to it on ports 20 and 21,\n\n152\n00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,580\nbecause that's what FTP uses.\n\n153\n00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,350\nSo, I could create a firewall\nrule that opened ports 20 and 21.\n\n154\n00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,410\nOr, I could create\na firewall rule that opened.\n\n155\n00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,880\n>> The files of a program and so\nwhatever ports it requests, let it have.\n\n156\n00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,330\nNow why would I do one versus the other?\n\n157\n00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,140\nWell, if you know exactly\nwhat ports you need,\n\n158\n00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,420\nyou're always better off doing ports.\n\n159\n00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,680\nSo that's what we're normally gonna use.\n\n160\n00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,230\nBut sometimes you don't know\nwhat ports you're going to need.\n\n161\n00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,840\n>> Right.\n>> For\n\n162\n00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,960\nexample with FTP, we have passive FTP,\nwhere the clients will negotiate out.\n\n163\n00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,900\nNegotiate\n>> Negotiate out?\n\n164\n00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,140\n>> Will negotiate a random\nport number to use.\n\n165\n00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,210\n>> Right.\n>> And they'll jump over to this\n\n166\n00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:58,900\nother port.\n\n167\n00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,560\nWell if it's random,\nhow can you predict that?\n\n168\n00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,792\n>> You cannot.\n>> You can't.\n\n169\n00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,358\nSo in that scenario [CROSSTALK]\n>> Some programs like to\n\n170\n00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,458\nopen up extra ports, just to,\nthey'll establish a port on a known port.\n\n171\n00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,601\n>> Mm-hm.\nBut then it'll open up additional,\n\n172\n00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:11,606\nthe dynamic range,\nto speed up the progress, or whatever, and\n\n173\n00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:14,125\nyou don't know what ports\nthose are gonna be either.\n\n174\n00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:19,001\nOne big difference too, when you do it by\nport number, you're opening that port for\n\n175\n00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:22,070\nany application,\nthat wants to use that port.\n\n176\n00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,190\nIf you do it by application,\n\n177\n00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,260\nthen it's only that FileZilla,\nthat's gonna be able to use 20, and 21.\n\n178\n00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,460\nAnything else that tries to use it,\nis not gonna be allowed through that, so\n\n179\n00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,080\na little bit difference in who's gonna\nbe allowed to use that exception, or\n\n180\n00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,270\ntake advantage of that exception,\nin your firewall.\n\n181\n00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,140\n>> And you know,\nI didn't put it in the show notes, but\n\n182\n00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,060\nI'm glad you mentioned that Mike,\nbecause you can actually combine these.\n\n183\n00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,120\nSo you can be very specific.\n\n184\n00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,690\nYou can say these ports for this program,\nand now you've really dialed it in.\n\n185\n00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,520\nBut for most of us, it's basically,\ngoing to be based on port numbers, and\n\n186\n00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,350\nprograms there.\n\n187\n00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,600\nThe thing to remember\nabout the port numbers is,\n\n188\n00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,730\nif this is a server, only one program\ncan be bound to a port, at a given time.\n\n189\n00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,050\nSo if one program already has it, and\n\n190\n00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,060\nanother program launches it,\nit won't be able to grab that port.\n\n191\n00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,390\nSo you're kind of safe.\n\n192\n00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,040\nBut it's not like that on a desktop.\n\n193\n00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,760\n>> Right.\n>> On a desktop,\n\n194\n00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,230\nyou probably don't run\nthe programs all the time.\n\n195\n00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,080\nYou launch different ones,\nat different times, and\n\n196\n00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,920\nthat's where you start to get into that\nsecurity weakness, like Mike mentioned.\n\n197\n00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,460\n>> Right.\n>> And it's better to combine the ports,\n\n198\n00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,390\nand the program into one.\n\n199\n00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,680\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n200\n00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,849\n>> All right.\nWell let's take a look at this,\n\n201\n00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:17,720\nlet's start with port numbers.\n\n202\n00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,400\n>> Yeah.\nHow do we do this in PowerShell?\n\n203\n00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,095\nWhat do we do?\n>> We use magic.\n\n204\n00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,625\n[LAUGH] It's Microsoft magic.\n\n205\n00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're gonna use the,\n\n206\n00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,158\nNew-NetFirewallRule, command.\n\n207\n00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:29,240\nAll right.\n\n208\n00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,170\nSo that's gonna be adding\na new rule to our system.\n\n209\n00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,740\nAnd I'm gonna give it a name,\nthat I can recognize.\n\n210\n00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,210\nSo I'll say DisplayName,\nand I'll give it a name.\n\n211\n00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,520\nNow, I'm gonna do this on ports.\n\n212\n00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,036\nAnd I want this to be,\nwe'll run with that FileZilla example.\n\n213\n00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:43,780\nRight.\nSo since I'm just doing ports,\n\n214\n00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,530\nI'm gonna give it a real generic name,\nlike FTP Traffic.\n\n215\n00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,255\nRight?\nBecause like Mike said,\n\n216\n00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,409\nthis could apply to any program running,\nnot just FileZilla.\n\n217\n00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:54,330\nSo I'm just giving it a name,\nthat I can recognize, and\n\n218\n00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,270\nthen I need to tell it the direction.\n\n219\n00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,130\nAll right.\n\n220\n00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,640\nBy default,\nall outbound traffic is allowed.\n\n221\n00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,590\nAnd all inbound traffic is blocked, except\nfor what there's a rule for, accepting it.\n\n222\n00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,310\nSo I'm creating an exception,\nwhich needs to be an inbound.\n\n223\n00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,010\nRight?\nThese are inbound connections to my\n\n224\n00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,510\nserver.\n\n225\n00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,870\nSo I'll say, -direction inbound, and\nthen, I need to specify the port.\n\n226\n00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,600\nNow, you can specify the local port,\nor the remote port.\n\n227\n00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,620\nThe remote port is the source, and\n\n228\n00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,290\nthe local port, is the destination,\nfor inbound traffic.\n\n229\n00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,317\nFor outbound, it's the opposite.\n\n230\n00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:28,940\nRight?\nBut for\n\n231\n00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,410\ninbound traffic,\nif I'm running an FTP server,\n\n232\n00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,230\nthe client could use whatever\nsource port they wanted.\n\n233\n00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,980\nThe destination is gonna be 20, or 21.\n\n234\n00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,160\nSo I'll say, -LocalPort,\nand then the port numbers.\n\n235\n00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,800\nRight?\n\n236\n00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,460\nNow if it was just a single port,\nI could write, that port.\n\n237\n00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,050\nRight? 21. >> Right.\n\n238\n00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,990\n>> Port 21.\n\n239\n00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,561\nIf it's more than one port right,\n\n240\n00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:54,890\nlike let's say this was a web server,\nI might need to do 80,443.\n\n241\n00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,476\nRight?\nSo now, it's doing both, for\n\n242\n00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:57,260\nHTTP, and HTTPS.\n\n243\n00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,020\nOr if it's a range of ports,\nlike FTP is 20, and 21,\n\n244\n00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,520\nthey're right next to each other,\nI could say 20 through 21.\n\n245\n00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,952\nSo you can specify several different ways,\nwhat ports you wanna open.\n\n246\n00:11:08,952 --> 00:11:12,870\nAll right.\n\n247\n00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,670\nIf I stop right there, well, I haven't\nspecified an action, so I'll get an error.\n\n248\n00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,110\n>> Right.\n>> But if I were to stop right here,\n\n249\n00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,920\nas far as the ports,\nit would open up TCP, and UDP.\n\n250\n00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,020\n>> Well, I just wanna do TCP,\nfor this particular one.\n\n251\n00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,960\nAnd so, I'm gonna say, -Protocol TCP,\nso it knows it's just TCP traffic.\n\n252\n00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,535\nNow, FTP can use UDP's, so\nthat might cause some problems.\n\n253\n00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:37,985\nI'll have to go, and update that.\n\n254\n00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:39,435\nBut if I left that off,\nit would actually do both.\n\n255\n00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:45,785\nAnd then lastly, probably the most\nimportant part, is I specify, -Action, and\n\n256\n00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:46,525\nwhat I want it to do.\n\n257\n00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:48,192\nDo I wanna allow this, or deny it?\n\n258\n00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:49,952\nRight?\nThere's actually a third option.\n\n259\n00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:51,922\nIs the third one secure?\n\n260\n00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:52,422\n>> What's that?\n\n261\n00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:53,452\nSorry.\n\n262\n00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:55,662\n>> You got allow, deny,\nand secure, I believe.\n\n263\n00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:57,082\n>> Yes, if you want to encrypt it, yep.\n\n264\n00:11:57,082 --> 00:12:00,612\n>> So allow and deny, that's pretty self\nexplanatory, we allow the traffic through,\n\n265\n00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:03,740\nor we deny it, but that secure one,\nis if you're doing IP SAC.\n\n266\n00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,500\nAnd we're not really tackling that here,\nin this segment,\n\n267\n00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,770\nbut that means we wanna\nencrypt the traffic.\n\n268\n00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,640\nSo in my case though, I'm gonna say allow.\n\n269\n00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,550\nI wanna allow this traffic through.\n\n270\n00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,530\nSo that's gonna create that firewall rule.\n\n271\n00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,610\n>> There it is.\n\n272\n00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,710\nNow I've got a rule called FTP Traffic.\n\n273\n00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:21,040\nIt's enabled, it's attached to any\nprofile, I didn't specify a profile.\n\n274\n00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,750\n>> You didn't specify which one.\n\n275\n00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,771\n>> And then it's inbound,\nit's allowed, it's up and running, and\n\n276\n00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:26,730\nwe're in business.\n\n277\n00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,454\nAnd I actually don't see the port\nnumbers in here, but that's fine,\n\n278\n00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:32,680\nyou'd have to pull the detailed\ninformation to get that.\n\n279\n00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,340\nAll right.\nSo my rule's in place, and\n\n280\n00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,940\nI'm in business.\n\n281\n00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,640\nNow I can run any FTP server that I want,\nand\n\n282\n00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,190\nclients will be able to connect on 20,\nand 21.\n\n283\n00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,930\nNow when I start to run it,\nI'm gonna bump into problems.\n\n284\n00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,750\nProblems like, what about UDP,\nright, because FTP uses that.\n\n285\n00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,680\nOr what about those random port numbers,\nfor passive connections,\n\n286\n00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,840\nthey're gonna fail too.\n\n287\n00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,664\nSo I might be pulling my hair out,\ntrying to get my FTP server to work,\n\n288\n00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:58,510\nbut at a minimum, 4, 20, and\n21, are now accepting traffic.\n\n289\n00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,129\n>> Right.\n\n290\n00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:00,218\n>> All right.\n\n291\n00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:02,679\nLet me just pull that full\ncommand back up again.\n\n292\n00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,110\nSo I started by specifying\nthe display name of the rule,\n\n293\n00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,300\nthe direction of the traffic, the port\nnumbers of the traffic, the protocol used.\n\n294\n00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,730\nAnd that's the layer four protocol,\nnot the actual session protocol,\n\n295\n00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,690\nand then whether we allow it, or deny it.\n\n296\n00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,222\nWhat that action is.\n\n297\n00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:22,390\nAll right.\nThose are all the pieces, of that command.\n\n298\n00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,970\nIf I wanted to do this based on a program,\nthough, it's a good bit different.\n\n299\n00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,010\nAll right.\nWith a program,\n\n300\n00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,910\nI would need to come back here,\nand adjust things a little bit.\n\n301\n00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,209\nActually, you know what here,\nI can edit that line.\n\n302\n00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:41,006\nSo whereas, I did New-NetFirewallRule\nDisplay name FTP Traffic,\n\n303\n00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:43,330\nnow I wanna get really specific.\n\n304\n00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:43,950\nOkay.\n\n305\n00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,826\nI'm gonna make this new one, my FileZilla\ntraffic, and I'm gonna get rid of\n\n306\n00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:53,790\nthe FTP part too, because I'm really\njust saying any traffic for FileZilla.\n\n307\n00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,530\nWhatever FileZilla requests,\nwe're gonna give it to them.\n\n308\n00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,640\nAll right.\n\n309\n00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,730\nSo that's just the display name there,\nthough.\n\n310\n00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,750\nIt doesn't actually change anything.\n\n311\n00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,580\nBut my direction, is still inbound, and\n\n312\n00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,370\nmy port numbers,\nthis is where things start to change.\n\n313\n00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,248\nAll right.\n\n314\n00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,990\nI don't wanna be specific\nabout port numbers,\n\n315\n00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,663\ncuz I don't know what ports,\nit's gonna use.\n\n316\n00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:13,460\n>> You might wanna use\nsome different port.\n\n317\n00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,730\nSo I've gotta be ready to handle that.\n\n318\n00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,730\nI've gotta be ready to handle, whatever\nit asks for, just allow it through.\n\n319\n00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,480\nThis is the equivalent of going into\nthe GUI, and saying allow a program,\n\n320\n00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,640\nthrough the firewall.\n\n321\n00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,165\nRight?\nYou get that little, easy GUI option,\n\n322\n00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,580\nthat's what this is gonna be like.\n\n323\n00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,020\nSo what I need to do is,\nin the show notes,\n\n324\n00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,870\nI get really specific, as far as like,\nwhat profile you wanna use.\n\n325\n00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,330\nI'm not gonna mess with any of that.\n\n326\n00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,140\nBut I am gonna add\na little bit more to this.\n\n327\n00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,400\nSo, I'm gonna get rid of these ports,\nand protocols, and\n\n328\n00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,762\nI guess I'll get rid of the action queues,\njust make life a little more simple on me.\n\n329\n00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:44,590\nAll right.\n\n330\n00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,730\nI'll leave that direction as inbound,\nalthough, I could probably leave that off.\n\n331\n00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,440\nAnd I'm gonna say, -Program, and\nnow, I need to specify the program.\n\n332\n00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,230\nAll right.\n\n333\n00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,620\nAnd here, you need to point the full path,\nto the executable that's being run.\n\n334\n00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,200\n>> Can't just type in FileZilla.exe.\n\n335\n00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,659\nIt has to know where that\nexecutable is stored at.\n\n336\n00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,443\n>> Yeah, and be careful on this one,\nbecause often times,\n\n337\n00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:10,329\nthere will be one executable for the GUI,\nthat used the management server, and\n\n338\n00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:12,600\ndifferent executable for\nthe server itself.\n\n339\n00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,324\nFileZilla is one like that, that the\nFileZilla icon, that you might see on your\n\n340\n00:15:16,324 --> 00:15:20,120\ncomputer, that's actually just a GUI,\nthat's not what's opening up ports.\n\n341\n00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,333\nThere's a server service, that's sitting\nin another location, that is the actual\n\n342\n00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,980\nexecutable we need to allow., so\nhere we just specificed that program.\n\n343\n00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,727\nSo if I had FileZilla,\nI would say, C:\\program files.\n\n344\n00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,842\nThe hardest part here, is the typing.\n\n345\n00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:36,206\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> \\program files, and\n\n346\n00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:37,662\nactually, that ones 32 bit, isn't it?\n\n347\n00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:39,222\n>> It should tab, auto fill for\nyou, on your path.\n\n348\n00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,365\nWon't it?\n>> Well, I don't even, actually know,\n\n349\n00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:42,421\nif I have it installed.\n\n350\n00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:43,381\n>> Oh yeah that's true.\n\n351\n00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:45,958\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm using it as an example,\n\n352\n00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,362\nI don't know if I have it,\nmaybe I do, let's see.\n\n353\n00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:51,342\nDo I have, nah see I don't even have,\nso I'll just make it up.\n\n354\n00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:56,462\nSo C:\\prgramfiles\\86\\, and now,\nI need to say where it would be installed.\n\n355\n00:15:56,462 --> 00:16:01,408\nSo it would be,\nlike FileZilla server\\ ,and then\n\n356\n00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:05,441\nit's called, FileZillaserver.exe.\n\n357\n00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:06,375\nThere we go.\n\n358\n00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,036\nAll right.\nSo I'm just specifying where that program\n\n359\n00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,583\nis\n>> Now when that program runs.\n\n360\n00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,598\nWhatever it asks for, the firewall's\ngonna recognize and allow or\n\n361\n00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:17,790\ndeny it based on what I specify next.\n\n362\n00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,758\nI guess I need to put that, don't I?\n\n363\n00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:22,480\n-Action Allow.\n\n364\n00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,634\n>> Yeah, but you didn't specify\na protocol, so it could be TCP,\n\n365\n00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:28,540\nit could be UDP, and you didn't specify\na specific port number, so it could be any\n\n366\n00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,890\nport that that program wants to open up\n>> Yeah,\n\n367\n00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,770\nand it really is whatever\nthat program wants.\n\n368\n00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,340\nSo that if the program asks for\na port to open, it will.\n\n369\n00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,590\nNow, pros and cons with that, right?\n\n370\n00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,790\nOn a positive side,\nI know my FTP transfers will work.\n\n371\n00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,510\nI know that 20 and 21 will be open,\n\n372\n00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,960\nI know that the passive port numbers that\nit picks, those will be open, great.\n\n373\n00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,390\nBut FileZilla also has a little\nmanagement interface that it runs, and\n\n374\n00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,270\nthat management interface is\ntied to a particular port.\n\n375\n00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,200\nA port number you pick\nwhen you install it.\n\n376\n00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,560\nThat's gonna be open, too.\n\n377\n00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,120\nAnd it's gonna be open to everybody,\nright?\n\n378\n00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,410\nCuz I didn't specify like a source\ntraffic here or anything.\n\n379\n00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,720\nSo, I'll probably wanna add a second rule\n\n380\n00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,200\nthat restricts access to\nthat management port, right?\n\n381\n00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,100\nClose that off so\nthat people can't try and attach that, or\n\n382\n00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,050\nmaybe I don't care, I don't know.\n\n383\n00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,190\nBut you'll probably wanna\nadd another rule for it.\n\n384\n00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,990\nBut the point of this example is\nto show attaching that program.\n\n385\n00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,530\nAnd if I run that,\nnow I have a rule called FileZilla Traffic\n\n386\n00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,988\nthat's tied to that program specifically\nand any ports it requests, will be open.\n\n387\n00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:32,301\nAll right, so that gets it open,\nthat makes that one running.\n\n388\n00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,361\nLet's talk about that management port.\n\n389\n00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:37,001\nNow, the management port,\nyou pick that when you do the install.\n\n390\n00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:41,224\nSo I'll just a pick a random port,\nmaybe I'll say one, two,\n\n391\n00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:44,560\nwe'll just do 12345, there we go.\n\n392\n00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,978\nSo let's say that's our management\nport number, 12345, right?\n\n393\n00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:52,262\nI wanna create a rule that restricts\nwho is allowed to get to it.\n\n394\n00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:57,270\nI wanna make it where only people on\nmy local network can get to that port.\n\n395\n00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,400\nSo if somebody's out on the Internet,\n\n396\n00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,510\nI want them to be able to FTP\nto my server, that's cool.\n\n397\n00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,210\nBut I don't want to them to try and\nmanage my server.\n\n398\n00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,170\nSo for this one, it's a little trickier\nbecause the rules we've created so\n\n399\n00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,340\nfar have been based on your destination.\n\n400\n00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,900\nNow I need a rule based on the source,\nwho's coming in, and\n\n401\n00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,240\nthat's a different kind of firewall rule.\n\n402\n00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,120\nAll right, so for this one,\nit's actually not that hard.\n\n403\n00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,090\nIt's an easier rule, really.\n\n404\n00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,265\nWe can come in and we can say,\nwell, I got a choice.\n\n405\n00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:28,805\nI could do a new rule, right?\n\n406\n00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:32,541\nI could do New-FirewallRule and\ncreate a new rule based on that port, or\n\n407\n00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,940\nI could modify the existing\nrule if I wanted.\n\n408\n00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,120\nIf I wanted to go back and\nchange it and say,\n\n409\n00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,000\nI only want local people to be able to\nFTP into that server or whatever, right?\n\n410\n00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,930\nSo you got some flexibility here.\n\n411\n00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,312\nIf I wanted to do it that way,\nwhere I just change it so\n\n412\n00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:53,792\nthat only local people can connect,\ninstead of saying New-FirewallRule,\n\n413\n00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:58,076\nwhich is what we've been doing,\nI could come in and\n\n414\n00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:02,983\nsay, Set-NetFirewallRule,\nor something or another.\n\n415\n00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:04,070\nThere we go.\n\n416\n00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,220\nAnd just remember that New creates a new\none, Set modifies an existing one.\n\n417\n00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,910\nAnd so I can then go in and\nmodify whatever that rule was,\n\n418\n00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,610\nusually based on display name, right?\n\n419\n00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:21,650\nSo I would say display name\nis FileZilla Traffic, okay?\n\n420\n00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,050\nAnd so, now I'm modifying that rule and\n\n421\n00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,844\nI just specify whatever\nelse it is I wanna do.\n\n422\n00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:29,723\nI'm gonna add remote address,\nso -RemoteAddress, and\n\n423\n00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:34,010\nspecify who it is I want and\nyou can do a whole range of addresses.\n\n424\n00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:38,140\n>> Yeah, notice he's not using\nall the other commands either.\n\n425\n00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,700\nSo, because the rule already exists, he\ndoesn't have to specify the protocols and\n\n426\n00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,600\nthings like that.\n\n427\n00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,730\nHe's just adding or modifying that\nexisting rule or adding a new parameter\n\n428\n00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,620\nto an existing rule, so\nit's just specifying that remote address.\n\n429\n00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,690\n>> So when I run that,\nnow the FileZilla rule, anybody or\n\n430\n00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,520\nany port that FileZilla server requests,\nwill be opened.\n\n431\n00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,420\nBut, only if the client's\naddress is in this range.\n\n432\n00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,220\n192.168.29.1 through 254,\nwill they be allowed to connect.\n\n433\n00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,169\nI've added restrictions to that rule,\nand that's pretty easy to do, all right?\n\n434\n00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:17,310\nI might want to do that, if I just\nwanna do it from the management port,\n\n435\n00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,570\nI would've needed to create\na new net firewall rule, right?\n\n436\n00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,410\nBut if I wanted to\nrestrict all the traffic,\n\n437\n00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,000\nthen it's really easy to do it right here.\n\n438\n00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,720\nYou can verify all this\nin the GUI if you want.\n\n439\n00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,610\nIt's a little bit easier sometimes\nin the GUI to see this stuff, but\n\n440\n00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,210\nif you're on a core server install,\nyou don't necessarily have that, so\n\n441\n00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,110\nthat's why it's important\nto know both ways.\n\n442\n00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,924\nBut if we come in here, here's my\nFileZilla traffic rule that we just made,\n\n443\n00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:43,707\nand if I pull it up,\nI can look at programs and\n\n444\n00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:45,840\nthere it's tied to the program.\n\n445\n00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,151\nRemote Computers and oh wait,\nit's not there, is it?\n\n446\n00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,491\n>> Just go up there to the bottom of that.\n\n447\n00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:53,351\n>> There we go, yep.\n\n448\n00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:57,146\nIt gets confusing cuz under Remote\nComputers, you expect to see it there, but\n\n449\n00:20:57,146 --> 00:21:01,302\nthat's really when we're talking about\nthe encrypted connections, right?\n\n450\n00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,052\nBut if we go back to scope,\nhere's where we can see the remote IP\n\n451\n00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:06,352\naddress right there is\nwhere it's specified.\n\n452\n00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:09,950\nSo there's that range, these are the\npeople that are allowed to connect, and\n\n453\n00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,653\nthen the program that was tied to it.\n\n454\n00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:16,383\nVersus the other rule we made,\nif I pull it up and I go to its scope,\n\n455\n00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:21,028\nthey're just set to Any Any, and\nif I go to Protocols and Ports,\n\n456\n00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:24,742\nhere's where it's locked\ninto that 20 to 21.\n\n457\n00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,375\nAll right so, all said and done,\nworking with the firewall rules,\n\n458\n00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,050\nreally not that hard, right?\n\n459\n00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,488\nThe commands that we used were\nmostly Get-NetFirewallProfile or\n\n460\n00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:39,660\nGet-NetFirewallRule, and\nthen the alternatives of new and\n\n461\n00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,820\nset that we used in addition to those.\n\n462\n00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,597\nAnd then you've got remove also,\n\n463\n00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:47,030\nif you wanna remove the firewall\nrules to get them out of there, and\n\n464\n00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,111\nyou can always modify them as\nfar as -Enable true or false.\n\n465\n00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:54,771\nYou might wanna temporarily turn a rule\noff and then turn it back on again,\n\n466\n00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,411\nand you can do that, too using -Enable.\n\n467\n00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:57,911\n>> Good.\n\n468\n00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,580\n>> All right, so in this segment,\nwe got a chance to see how to enable and\n\n469\n00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,930\ndisable our firewall, how to create\nnew rules and modify the rules.\n\n470\n00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,415\nWe saw how to create rules based\non a program verses a port, and\n\n471\n00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:12,756\nthose are the typical,\n\n472\n00:22:12,756 --> 00:22:17,331\nday to day objectives that we have when\nworking with firewall rules and Windows.\n\n473\n00:22:17,331 --> 00:22:19,340\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n474\n00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,440\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n475\n00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,200\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,203\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:11,396\nIn this segment, we're gonna take\na look at one of the first things we do\n\n3\n00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:12,840\nwhen we set up a new DNS Server.\n\n4\n00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,610\nWhich is, configuring and\nmanaging our zones.\n\n5\n00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,195\nA DNS server is not terribly useful\nwithout some zones in there.\n\n6\n00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:21,380\nFrom being able to do forward and\nreverse lookups.\n\n7\n00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,460\nAnd so, that's what we're\ngoing to look at right here.\n\n8\n00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,210\n>> All right.\nSo we're going to start by setting up,\n\n9\n00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,920\nas we know from DNS, there's different\ntypes of zones we can create.\n\n10\n00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,750\nWe've got our primary, and\nour secondaries, and our stubs.\n\n11\n00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,730\nWe can choose to do active\ndirectory integrated.\n\n12\n00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,100\nOr we can set it up as a separate\nfile if it's not a domain controller.\n\n13\n00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,550\nOr if we choose just not to do\nactive directory integrator.\n\n14\n00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,620\nSo the first command I'm going to do is\nI'm just going to add a primary zone.\n\n15\n00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,540\nThis server is a domain controller.\n\n16\n00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,850\nAnd he’s already got a zone for\ncontoso.com.\n\n17\n00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,560\nIt’s Active Directory integrated.\n\n18\n00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,610\nAnd I’m gonna add a second\nzone to the server.\n\n19\n00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,143\nSo the command is gonna be\nadd-dnsserver primary zone.\n\n20\n00:00:57,143 --> 00:00:59,955\nOops, So not enough letters,\ntry that one more time.\n\n21\n00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:02,618\nWe're not going to tab\nthrough all of that.\n\n22\n00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:05,063\nSo, add -dnsserver primary zone.\n\n23\n00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:08,995\nAnd then -name, and the name of\nthe zone that you want to create.\n\n24\n00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:17,120\nIn this case I'm just going to\ncall it west01.contoso.com, oops.\n\n25\n00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,060\nAnd after the name, we're going\nto give it the replication scope.\n\n26\n00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,540\nBecause this is going to be\nactive directory integrated,\n\n27\n00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,940\nif you think back to running\nthrough this through your GUI.\n\n28\n00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,575\nYou've got to choose if I'm going\nto replicate this to all domain\n\n29\n00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:29,846\ncontrollers in the domain\nthat are running DNS.\n\n30\n00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:32,861\nAll domain controllers in\nthe force that are running DNS.\n\n31\n00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:35,850\nAnd so the parameter for\nthat is just replication scope.\n\n32\n00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,060\nAnd I'm going to do forest for that one.\n\n33\n00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,721\nAnd then I can add a little -passthrough\nif we want to see a little bit of\n\n34\n00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:45,095\noutput for that, I'll hit enter.\n\n35\n00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:52,380\nAnd there I can see I have now\ncreated a zone, west01.contoso.com.\n\n36\n00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,190\nIt is a primary for the zone type.\n\n37\n00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,650\nIsDSIntegrated is listed as true,\nall right.\n\n38\n00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,125\nAnd if we take a look at my DNS console,\nand I refresh my Forward Lookup Zones.\n\n39\n00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:09,370\nI now have a zone for west01.contoso.com.\n\n40\n00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,460\nAnd when I look at Forward Lookup Zones,\n\n41\n00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,260\nI can see that it is\nActive Directory Integrated.\n\n42\n00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,850\nAll right.\n\n43\n00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,350\nSo that's one type of\nzone that we can create.\n\n44\n00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,610\n>> And for most people, active\ndirectory integrated is what you want.\n\n45\n00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,340\nBut one of the things Mike said at\nthe beginning of the segment was, hey,\n\n46\n00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,730\nthis guy is an active\ndirectory domain controller.\n\n47\n00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,190\nIf you're going to be\nrunning your DNS server\n\n48\n00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,480\nnot on an active directory\ndomain controller.\n\n49\n00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,750\nWell, you don't really\nhave that option anymore.\n\n50\n00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,690\nSo you need to go old school, and create\nwhat's called the standard primary zone.\n\n51\n00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,710\nOne that's not stored in the active\ndirectory, but instead stored in a file.\n\n52\n00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,100\n>> You know what,\nI don't think this guy is running DNS.\n\n53\n00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,135\nSo let's install -windowsfeature.\n\n54\n00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:47,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I forgot about that.\n\n55\n00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,655\n>> It is hard to add a zone to\na server not actually running DNS.\n\n56\n00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n57\n00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,390\nwe're get that running real quick.\n\n58\n00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,680\nSuccess was true.\n\n59\n00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,660\nBoy that was awfully fast.\n\n60\n00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,410\nMaybe I\n>> It must already be running.\n\n61\n00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,240\n>> Good.\n\n62\n00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,700\nAll right so on this guy,\nthis is not a domain controller.\n\n63\n00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,280\nIt's a member server that\nI've installed DNS on.\n\n64\n00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,130\nSo we're gonna create\nanother primary zone.\n\n65\n00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,880\nThis time I'm gonna do a file based zone.\n\n66\n00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,930\nSo this might be something you\nmight run out your DMZ, or\n\n67\n00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,820\nsomewhere you need a DNS server.\n\n68\n00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,310\nBut you don't wanna put it, or\ndon't have a domain controller.\n\n69\n00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,790\nSo the command is gonna be very similar.\n\n70\n00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:26,715\nIt's gonna be add -dnsserver primary zone.\n\n71\n00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:27,410\nSo DNS server primary zone.\n\n72\n00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,810\nAnd I've gotta give it a name.\n\n73\n00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,824\nSo the name is going to be,\n\n74\n00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:37,758\nlet’s call this west2.contoso.com.\n\n75\n00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:42,530\nAll right, and what else do I need?\n\n76\n00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,830\nAnd for this one, since it's not going\nto be active directory integrated.\n\n77\n00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,720\nI've got to give it a name for\nthe file that it's going to create.\n\n78\n00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,240\nWhere it's going to store\nthose resource records.\n\n79\n00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,980\nAnd again,\n\n80\n00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,580\nif you think back to the GUI interface\nyou've gone through that wizard before.\n\n81\n00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,865\nSame options there, so\nwe'll say west2.contoso.com.\n\n82\n00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,605\n>> You going to do a looks like -zonefile.\n\n83\n00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:07,425\n>> Oops, I forgot my parameter there.\n\n84\n00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:11,014\nSo let's do that, zonefile.\n\n85\n00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:11,770\nThere we go.\n\n86\n00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,820\nAnd we hit enter.\n\n87\n00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,015\nAnd have it take a look at my DNS console.\n\n88\n00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,039\nLet me expand down my\nforward look up zones.\n\n89\n00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,310\n>> There you go.\n>> And there's my west2.contoso.com.\n\n90\n00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,930\nSo there we created an active directory\nintegrated zone on a domain controller.\n\n91\n00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,610\nAnd then now we've created a-\n>> Standard primary.\n\n92\n00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,630\n>> Standard primary,\nfrom back in the old days.\n\n93\n00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,260\n>> The thing to remember is that\nthe command is really the same,\n\n94\n00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,440\nboth times we did add-\ndnsserver primary zone.\n\n95\n00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,410\nThe difference was for active directory\nintegrated, you did -replication scope.\n\n96\n00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,820\nWhich said what domain controllers\nare going to carry this.\n\n97\n00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,555\nAnd then for a standard primary,\njust ones outside, we did a -zone file.\n\n98\n00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,935\nInstead of being stored as\na replication scope in the AD,\n\n99\n00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,865\nthis one is stored in a file.\n\n100\n00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:07,685\nAnd that file,\nI can never remember, It was what?\n\n101\n00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:11,750\nC:/Windows/System32/DNS, but\nit's just right in there.\n\n102\n00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,021\n[CROSSTALK] Just a text files.\n\n103\n00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,770\nContains the whole zone.\n\n104\n00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,310\nIt's created and you're in business.\n\n105\n00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,300\nSo setting up a primary zone like that,\nnot a big deal at all.\n\n106\n00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,080\n>> Not at all.\n\n107\n00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,664\nAll right.\nSo those\n\n108\n00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:25,890\nare my active directory integrated,\nand my standard primaries.\n\n109\n00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,840\nNext thing we want to create is\ngoing to be reverse lookup zone.\n\n110\n00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,790\nSo again, the command is similar.\n\n111\n00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,760\nWe're gonna change that up.\n\n112\n00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,500\nIt starts out the same,\nadd-dnsserverPrimaryZone.\n\n113\n00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,990\nAnd then for this one, instead of a zone\nname, we're gonna do a network ID.\n\n114\n00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,430\nSo network ID.\n\n115\n00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,937\nAnd we're going to,\nI forget what network we're using,\n\n116\n00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,141\n192.168.1.0/24.\n\n117\n00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:58,590\nThat one.\n\n118\n00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,270\nAnd then again,\nbecause this is the domain controller.\n\n119\n00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,190\nSo let's do the -replicationScope.\n\n120\n00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,350\nAnd we'll do forest again.\n\n121\n00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,880\nSo this is gonna create a reverse lookup\nzone that is active directory integrated.\n\n122\n00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,650\nSo let's verify that, that worked.\n\n123\n00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,060\nWe'll flip back over to my DNS console.\n\n124\n00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,800\nWe'll refresh my good old\nreverse lookup zones here.\n\n125\n00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,050\nAnd there she is,\nmy 192.168.1.0 reverse lookup zone.\n\n126\n00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,250\nSo that's gonna be an active\ndirectory integrated zone.\n\n127\n00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,200\nIf we look at the type,\nthat is active directory integrated.\n\n128\n00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,620\nAnd then,\njust like with the standard primaries,\n\n129\n00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,490\nthe command to do a file based\nreverse lookup zone is the same thing.\n\n130\n00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,300\nInstead of doing the replication scope.\n\n131\n00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,710\nWe're going to give it\nthat zone file name.\n\n132\n00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,580\nI flip back over here.\n\n133\n00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,610\nAnd do another add -dnsserverPrimaryZone.\n\n134\n00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,660\nWe'll do a dash name,\nI'm sorry, dash network ID.\n\n135\n00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,340\nAnd again, we'll do the same thing.\n\n136\n00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:11,044\n192.168.1.0/24.\n\n137\n00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:14,030\nAnd then, for the zone file.\n\n138\n00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,720\nWe'll do instead of the replication scope,\nwe're going to do the zone file.\n\n139\n00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,003\nAnd the zone files, reverse look up\nzones or the network ID backwards.\n\n140\n00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:30,880\nSo we'll do 0.168.192.\n\n141\n00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,525\nAnd then that reserve dns suffix.\n\n142\n00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:41,670\nin -addr.arpa.dns for that file.\n\n143\n00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,010\n>> And that final name, you can actually\nput whatever name you want in there.\n\n144\n00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,240\nYou could call it bob.txt if you wanted,\nbut it would still work.\n\n145\n00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,190\nBut if you want to kind of\nobserve the normal process.\n\n146\n00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,860\nThese are the default file\nnames that Microsoft would use.\n\n147\n00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,120\nIf you use the GUI to create that zone,\n\n148\n00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,490\nit would create a file named\nexactly like Mike just did there.\n\n149\n00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,020\nSo, while you can use whatever you want.\n\n150\n00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,800\nYou're usually better off\nsticking with the standards.\n\n151\n00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,190\nBecause if somebody else has to come\nbehind you and troubleshoot the server.\n\n152\n00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,480\nThey're not gonna know what Bob.txt is.\n\n153\n00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,300\nBut they are gonna know what\nthat file name is right there.\n\n154\n00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,820\n>> Exactly.\n\n155\n00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,060\n>> But, just like Mike said,\ninstead of doing the replication scope,\n\n156\n00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,000\nyou just do zone file, and that's it.\n\n157\n00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,940\nReally the only difference between\na forward look up zone, and\n\n158\n00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,420\na reverse look up zone.\n\n159\n00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,800\nIs in a forward look up zone,\nwe gave it a name.\n\n160\n00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,530\nIn a reverse look up zone\nwe gave it a network ID.\n\n161\n00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,290\nRight?\nThat's the difference between the two.\n\n162\n00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,840\n>> All right.\nSo we've set up our primaries,\n\n163\n00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,450\nour secondaries.\n\n164\n00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,300\nThe next thing I want to do,\nactually I'm sorry.\n\n165\n00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,620\nWe set up all of our primaries, right?\n\n166\n00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,470\nWe did the active directory integrated,\nand then the standard primary.\n\n167\n00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,650\nNext thing we're gonna want to be able\nto do, is provide some redundancy.\n\n168\n00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,060\nWe've got a DNS server\nthat's hosting a zone.\n\n169\n00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,930\nI want more than one\nDNS Server hosting that zone.\n\n170\n00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,050\nIn case one of them fails.\n\n171\n00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,480\nSo we on DC1 I've got a zone for\ncontoso.com.\n\n172\n00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,210\n>> And that's active directory.\n\n173\n00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,090\nIs that active directory?\n\n174\n00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,050\n>> That is active directory integrated.\n\n175\n00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,420\n>> If they're active directory integrated,\n\n176\n00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,340\nremember that any DNS server that you\nbring up that's in that replication scope.\n\n177\n00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,750\nIt’ll automatically get the zone.\n\n178\n00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,690\nSo you’ve already got replication there,\nit’s no big deal, you’re done.\n\n179\n00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:18,160\nBut what if that zone is hosted on\na Linux server, or a UNIX Bind server.\n\n180\n00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,440\nOr it’s just hosted in some other domain,\nand you want a copy of it?\n\n181\n00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,310\nWell, in that case,\nyou might not be a part of that domain.\n\n182\n00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,380\nYou don't get a copy of that DNS zone.\n\n183\n00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,420\nAnd you may wanna set up what's\ncalled a standard secondary.\n\n184\n00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,490\nAnd a standard secondary being one\nthat is a backup copy of that zone,\n\n185\n00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,880\nthat's stored on your own DNS server.\n\n186\n00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,610\n>> Exactly.\n\n187\n00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,360\nSo we'll go over here,\nI'm gonna go over to serve one, and\n\n188\n00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,549\nI'll use him as my secondary.\n\n189\n00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,329\nAnd the command for that one is gonna\n\n190\n00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:53,190\nbe add -dnsserverSecondaryZone.\n\n191\n00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,270\nAnd for this one, the zone already exists.\n\n192\n00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,260\nContoso or DC1 is hosting that zone.\n\n193\n00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,160\nSo I've gotta give it the name of the zone\nthat I wanna make this secondary for.\n\n194\n00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,550\n>> Which we're gonna do that\n,we'll do west01 I guess.\n\n195\n00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:11,223\nLet's make sure we called it-\n>> I think you called it west1.\n\n196\n00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:13,115\n>> I think I did too.\n\n197\n00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:16,690\nwest2 and nope, west01 and west8.\n\n198\n00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,921\nI'm not very consistent with my names.\n\n199\n00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:21,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n200\n00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,570\nwe'll call this one West 01.contoso.com.\n\n201\n00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,170\nAnd then because this guy\nis not a domain controller.\n\n202\n00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,940\nI'm going to have to create a file\nto store that information in.\n\n203\n00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,743\nSo the zone file.\n\n204\n00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:39,751\nAnd again, And we'll just use our\nnative standard convention here,\n\n205\n00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:43,724\nwest01.contoso.com.dns.\n\n206\n00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:45,905\nNow, this is a secondary.\n\n207\n00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:48,085\nSo he's a read-only copy.\n\n208\n00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:50,180\nHe has to get that\ninformation from somewhere.\n\n209\n00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,820\nSo in my PowerShell command, I've got\nto specify who that master server is.\n\n210\n00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,680\nWho's he getting his copy from?\n\n211\n00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,650\nAnd the parameter for\nthat is just masterservers.\n\n212\n00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:05,328\nSo -masterservers, and\nthen the IP address of my master server.\n\n213\n00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:12,071\nIn this case 192.1 68.1.1, and enter.\n\n214\n00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,831\nAnd now if I flip over\nhere to my DNS console.\n\n215\n00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:18,000\nI should have a new forward lookup zone.\n\n216\n00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,180\nFor west01.\n\n217\n00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,690\nBut, I've got an error.\n\n218\n00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,860\nI can see that that zone\nhasn't been loaded up.\n\n219\n00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,490\nRemember when you're.\n\n220\n00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,020\nSetting up your secondaries by default.\n\n221\n00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,800\nStarting with I think 2008,\nthey finally got it right.\n\n222\n00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,690\nBy default DNS servers don't\nallow zone transfers at all.\n\n223\n00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,250\nYou have to go in to specify who is\nallowed to request the copy of that zone.\n\n224\n00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,040\nSo even though I've added\nthe secondary zone here, and\n\n225\n00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040\nI've told it who to get the copy from.\n\n226\n00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,190\nWhen he calls out dc1, and says,\nhey can I get a copy of that zone?\n\n227\n00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,070\ndc1 is saying no.\n\n228\n00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,980\nYou can't have a copy of that.\n\n229\n00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,540\nSo what we need to do is\ngo back over to our master.\n\n230\n00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,540\nIn this case dc.\n\n231\n00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,815\nAnd let it know that it's okay to\ngive a copy of that zone to server1.\n\n232\n00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,120\nAnd this is a cool command.\n\n233\n00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,530\nWe can do a few different\noptions with this.\n\n234\n00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,250\nThe command is going to be,\nwe're modifying an existing zone.\n\n235\n00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,140\nWe're not creating a new zone here.\n\n236\n00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,660\nSo it's gonna be set\n-dnsserverPrimaryZone.\n\n237\n00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,230\nSet dash DNS server primary zone.\n\n238\n00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,570\nAnd then the name of the zone\nthat you want to modify.\n\n239\n00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,190\nIn this case west01.\n\n240\n00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,410\nOops, let's make sure we add\nthe name parameter there.\n\n241\n00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,030\nThe name is going to\nbe west01.contoso.com.\n\n242\n00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,860\nAnd then there's a few different\noptions you can do, right?\n\n243\n00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,010\nWe've got the notify option in DNS.\n\n244\n00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,910\nNormally, we would do standard\nprimaries and secondaries.\n\n245\n00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,810\nThere's an interval,\nfifteen minutes by default.\n\n246\n00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,104\nThat refresh interval,\nthat's how often the secondary's going to\n\n247\n00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,441\nquery the master to see\nif there's any changes.\n\n248\n00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:55,995\nWith the notify option, I can tell the\nmaster, hey as soon as there's a change,\n\n249\n00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:57,580\nnotify all your secondaries.\n\n250\n00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,220\nLet them know there's been a change, and\nthen they won't wait the 15 minutes.\n\n251\n00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,450\nThey'll go ahead and\nrequest replication right then.\n\n252\n00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,950\nJust speeds up the convergence\non those zones.\n\n253\n00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,685\nSo I'm going to do a -notify.\n\n254\n00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,720\nAnd there's a few different\noptions you can do here.\n\n255\n00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,130\nI'll give you guys the link to TechNet\nthat has the different parameters.\n\n256\n00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,800\nYou can decide whether you wanna notify\n\n257\n00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,690\nall of the secondaries that\nare getting a copy of that zone.\n\n258\n00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,430\nOr you can say, I just wanna\nnotify particular secondaries.\n\n259\n00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,380\nFor me,\nI'm just gonna do a notify which says that\n\n260\n00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,150\nany secondary that's allowed\nto get a copy of this zone.\n\n261\n00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,060\nGo ahead and notify them anytime\nthere has been a change.\n\n262\n00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,270\nAnd then I have to tell who\nthe secondary server is.\n\n263\n00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,700\nWho's allowed to reach out and\nget a copy of that zone file.\n\n264\n00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,589\nAnd the parameter for\nthat is gonna be secondary service.\n\n265\n00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,130\nAnd then we do it by IP address.\n\n266\n00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,282\nIn this case, 192.168.\n\n267\n00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:50,345\nWhat are we?\n\n268\n00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:53,610\n.1.103 for server1.\n\n269\n00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,780\nAnd then what do we?\n\n270\n00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,850\nAnd then we're gonna choose.\n\n271\n00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,159\nSo if you think back to the GUI,\nwe're telling it who the secondary is.\n\n272\n00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,090\nWe also have to decide whose allowed\nto get the zone transferred.\n\n273\n00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,780\nIn the GUIs you've got the options,\nno transfers at all.\n\n274\n00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,730\nYou've got the option to any\nserver that requests it.\n\n275\n00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,820\nWhich means I can open up a command\nprompt and request a zone transfer.\n\n276\n00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,080\nWe could say only to named servers\nlisted on the named servers tab.\n\n277\n00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,780\nOr we can say the specific name servers.\n\n278\n00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,780\nAnd I can list the ones that\nare allowed to request that transfer.\n\n279\n00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:34,210\nAnd so in my case, I'm going to do the\nanybody that's all secondaries basically.\n\n280\n00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,799\nSo the option is going to be\ntransfer to secure servers.\n\n281\n00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,250\nSo it's going to be a -secure secondaries.\n\n282\n00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,600\nAnd then, we're going to use the option,\ntransfer to any server,\n\n283\n00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,725\nwould be the mistake, right.\n\n284\n00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:53,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Transfer to secure servers is the one\n\n285\n00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,730\nthat I wanna do.\n\n286\n00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,990\nTransferToZoneNameServer.\n\n287\n00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,090\nThat'd be one that I can specify which\nparticular servers I wanted that to go to.\n\n288\n00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,010\nAlright.\nSo I hit enter on that.\n\n289\n00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,970\nNow if we take a look at the zone now.\n\n290\n00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,790\nSo back here on the properties of west01.\n\n291\n00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,100\nAnd lemme refresh that.\n\n292\n00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,659\nMake sure we get all those changes.\n\n293\n00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,650\nTake a look at\nthe properties of that zone.\n\n294\n00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,240\nAnd I go over here to\nthe Zone Transfers tab.\n\n295\n00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,070\nI can see zone transfers\nare now being allowed.\n\n296\n00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,010\nOnly to the following server, and then\nthere's the IP address of the secondary.\n\n297\n00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,880\nIf I go down to my Notify options.\n\n298\n00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,650\nYou'll see that automatic\nnotify is turned on.\n\n299\n00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,340\nServer is listed on the name\nservers tab is selected.\n\n300\n00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,160\nSo we'll go ahead and,\nI'm just having trouble resolving that.\n\n301\n00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,830\nThere we go.\nIt looks like he's got it though.\n\n302\n00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,040\nSo now if I switch over to server1,\n\n303\n00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,980\nlet's check and\nsee if we're allowed to get that zone now.\n\n304\n00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,110\nAnd there we go.\n\n305\n00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,610\nSo now the secondary's\nallowed to query that master.\n\n306\n00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,550\nAnd retrieve a copy of that zone file\nanytime there's a change being made\n\n307\n00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,330\nto that zone file.\n\n308\n00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,330\nThe master's gonna notify the secondary,\nand he'll request that copy again.\n\n309\n00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,580\n>> All right, and that's pretty much that.\n\n310\n00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,580\nSo just remember the little\nsubtle differences between them.\n\n311\n00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,470\nWhen it came to forward lookup zones,\nwell, for\n\n312\n00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,550\nthat one we really just to make the\ndecision whether it was active directory\n\n313\n00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,920\nintegrated or whether it was a standard,\nprimary, outside of the active directory.\n\n314\n00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,700\nThe difference there being whether\nwe gave it a replication scope, or\n\n315\n00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,750\nwhether we gave it\na zone file to store in.\n\n316\n00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,640\nFor the reverse lookup zones,\nthose are basically the same.\n\n317\n00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,360\nWe created those.\n\n318\n00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,310\nAnd again, you specified\na replication scope if it was\n\n319\n00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,450\nactive directory integrated.\n\n320\n00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,650\nOr a zone file if they were outside.\n\n321\n00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,310\nFor the secondary zones though,\nit was a good bit different.\n\n322\n00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,180\nRight, we had a little bit\nof security we had to jump\n\n323\n00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,650\nthrough there to get that opened up.\n\n324\n00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:48,060\nAnd then we got that replica copy from\nthere, adding it as a standard secondary.\n\n325\n00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,430\nNot a primary zone this time,\nbut a secondary zone.\n\n326\n00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,360\nSo those are some of the different\nzones that we can create.\n\n327\n00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,990\nAnd that's one of the first steps that\nwe take when we set up a new DNS server.\n\n328\n00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,790\nYou've got to have the zones there, before\nyou can start responding to DNS queries.\n\n329\n00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,120\nNow the zones we created still\naren't particularly useful.\n\n330\n00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,520\n>> No. [LAUGH] >> You need to get\nsome host records in there, so\n\n331\n00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,720\nyou can provide some information.\n\n332\n00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,240\nAnd right now we don't have any.\n\n333\n00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,345\nSo make sure you stay tuned.\n\n334\n00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:15,960\nBecause we have more segments coming down\nthe line where we're going to cover all\n\n335\n00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,100\nthose host records, and\ngetting those put in there.\n\n336\n00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,780\nBut as far as our basic\noperation of creating zones,\n\n337\n00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,720\nwe saw several different examples here.\n\n338\n00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,677\nAnd it's really about that, right Mike?\n\n339\n00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,690\n>> I think so, we got it all covered.\n\n340\n00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,720\n>> All right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n341\n00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,619\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n342\n00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:36,579\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

zone.\n\n3\n00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,200\nThe zones are pretty useless until we\nactually get some records in there to be\n\n4\n00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,930\nable to query against.\n\n5\n00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,830\nThat's what we're gonna see here.\n\n6\n00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,890\nNow there are a lot of different\nrecord types inside of DNS.\n\n7\n00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,410\nSo we're just gonna run down the list and\nmaybe hit them in,\n\n8\n00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,695\nI don't know whatever order,\npopularity maybe, or something.\n\n9\n00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,090\n>> [LAUGH] Alphabetical, we'll do that.\n\n10\n00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,610\n>> That could be fun.\n\n11\n00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,530\nWell no, I guess I should redefine fun.\n\n12\n00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,340\nBut anyhow, let's run through here and\nwe'll get some records created.\n\n13\n00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,650\nWe'll start with the most common one,\nwhich is a simple A record.\n\n14\n00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,620\nAnd just to refresh,\n\n15\n00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,220\nan A record Is simply a mapping between\na hostname and an IPv4 address.\n\n16\n00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,420\nIt's a little variation between IPv4 and\nIPv6.\n\n17\n00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,560\nBut we'll just start right here.\n\n18\n00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,820\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a good one to start with.\n\n19\n00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,300\nA lot of these are gonna be created,\ndepending on what we're talking about,\n\n20\n00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,080\na lot of these usually we're gonna have\ndynamic updates enabled on our zones.\n\n21\n00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,430\nSo the client should be creating\na lot of their own records.\n\n22\n00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,240\nBut if we need to go in there and\nmanually create one,\n\n23\n00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,790\nthese are the commands we're gonna use.\n\n24\n00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,590\n>> And now I keep calling them records,\n\n25\n00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,060\nbut technically the official\nname is a resource record.\n\n26\n00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,685\nAnd so the PowerShell commandlet that\nwe're gonna use for all of this is going\n\n27\n00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:20,795\nto be the add-dnsserver\nresource record command list.\n\n28\n00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:23,085\nA nice short one, easy to remember.\n\n29\n00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:25,385\nSo let me just fire up\nmy PowerShell here and\n\n30\n00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,415\nyou'll see add-DnsServerResourceRecord.\n\n31\n00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:30,991\nAnd the syntax that we use here is pretty\nmuch the same for all of these, but\n\n32\n00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,586\nit does vary just a little bit based\non the type of record we're creating.\n\n33\n00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:37,390\nSo, that's the main\ncommand we're gonna use.\n\n34\n00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,020\nI wanna create an A Record, so\nI'm just gonna come in here and\n\n35\n00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,120\ntell it what zone I'm working with.\n\n36\n00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,550\nAnd maybe I want to create a record for\nmy laptop, so I've got my donlaptop.\n\n37\n00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,450\nI want to create a record for\nit in lab.itpro.tv.\n\n38\n00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,580\nSo the zone I'm going to work\nwith is going to be lab.itpro.tv,\n\n39\n00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,700\nand then I'll specify that\nI'm creating an A record, -A.\n\n40\n00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,480\nAnd then I'll specify -Name and\nwhat I want it to be.\n\n41\n00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,710\nNow I want it to be donlaptop, right.\n\n42\n00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,903\nI don't wanna specify\ndonlaptop.lab.itpro.tv, cuz it already\n\n43\n00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:15,599\nknows the domain from the zone name up\nhere, so it's really just the A records\n\n44\n00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,545\nname itself, and so when I run, uh-oh\n>> Oops.\n\n45\n00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:19,428\n[LAUGH]\n>> I kinda left\n\n46\n00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:21,212\noff an important part there, didn't I?\n\n47\n00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,339\n[LAUGH]\n>> So after I specify the name,\n\n48\n00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:24,920\nthe whole point of this is to\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n49\n00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,864\n>> Map a name to an IP so\n\n50\n00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:29,581\nI probably need to add just a little bit\nmore to this command to get it working\n\n51\n00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:30,711\nthe way that I need it.\n\n52\n00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,806\nSo,\n>> It is nice that it was gonna prompt\n\n53\n00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:35,380\nyou, letting you know that hey,\nyou're missing a couple things here\n\n54\n00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,290\n>> Dear Don, quit being a moron.\n\n55\n00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,000\nAdd this in here.\n\n56\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,300\nSo I'll go ahead and say IPv4 address,\nand what address I want it to be?\n\n57\n00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,310\nAnd I guess I should know what my address\nis, but I'll just put one in here.\n\n58\n00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,710\nI think I'm 240.\n\n59\n00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,190\nSo we'll put that in, and\nthat's my IP address.\n\n60\n00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,030\nNow if I run this,\n\n61\n00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,770\nit's got all the information that\nit needs to be happy, right?\n\n62\n00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,200\nIt's got my host name, which is donlaptop.\n\n63\n00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,040\nIt’s got my IP address that\nit’s gonna map to, and\n\n64\n00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,940\nit knows the zone that’s\ngonna create it in.\n\n65\n00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,140\nSo I could stop right here,\nbut there’s a few\n\n66\n00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,390\nmore values that we might wanna specify\nto get this record working right.\n\n67\n00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,530\nRight, Mike?\n\n68\n00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,060\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n69\n00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,990\nOne of them’s gonna be the time delay.\n\n70\n00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,990\nIf you create a new record, you've got\non your SOA, on your start of authority,\n\n71\n00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,420\nyou've got the default TTL,\nor time to live.\n\n72\n00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,490\nThat's how long other DNS servers or\n\n73\n00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,488\nclients that are retrieving that resource\nrecord are gonna cache that information.\n\n74\n00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:27,435\nSo we wanna specify something\nother than the default,\n\n75\n00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:31,020\nwhatever's listed on the SOA,\nwe can specify that here.\n\n76\n00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,278\n>> Yep, so I'll put a time to\nlive of one hour in there.\n\n77\n00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:36,918\nSo now, if somebody caches this,\nand it gets to be an hour old,\n\n78\n00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,795\nthen they'll have to refresh.\n\n79\n00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:39,740\n>> Exactly.\n\n80\n00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,500\nAnother we might want to do is age record.\n\n81\n00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,370\nNow this is a parameter normally when you\nmanually create records in DNS they're\n\n82\n00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,030\nconsidered static, so\nthey don't get a timestamp.\n\n83\n00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,490\nAnd that's not necessarily a bad thing,\nbut what'll happen is your aging and\n\n84\n00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,600\nscavenging process won't work\non those static records, right,\n\n85\n00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,860\nthere gonna be there forever\nuntil you manually remove them.\n\n86\n00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,780\nSo if you wanna let aging and scavenging,\nlike if Don's laptop ever goes away, do I\n\n87\n00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,880\nwant that record removed automatically\nonce it's reached a certain point?\n\n88\n00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,490\nAnd if I do we just use\nthe parameter age record.\n\n89\n00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,070\nWhat that's going to do,\n\n90\n00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,030\ninstead of listing as static, it's going\nto time stamp it, and now whatever your\n\n91\n00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,530\naging scavenging settings are,\nit'll remove that record if necessary.\n\n92\n00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,670\nAnd another perimeter you\ncan do is allow update any.\n\n93\n00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,503\n>> Oh, I didn’t do that, shoot.\n\n94\n00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:26,120\n>> Oh, that’s okay, yeah,\nit doesn’t really matter.\n\n95\n00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,510\nBut there’s a couple other parameters\nyou can use, the AllowUpdateAny.\n\n96\n00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,070\nAnd that’s just gonna make sure that\nanybody that’s listed as the owner of that\n\n97\n00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,570\nrecord is allowed to actually make changes\nto that record or update that record.\n\n98\n00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,640\n>> And I could’ve done like\na Set-DnsServerResourceRecord to go and\n\n99\n00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,510\nmodify the existing record that\nI just made if I wanted to.\n\n100\n00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,770\nBut otherwise we can\nhave that set up there.\n\n101\n00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,575\nAll right, so that’s basically\ngetting a IPv4 A record created, and\n\n102\n00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:57,754\na IPv6 A record, it’s pretty much the same\nexcept they’re not A, they’re 4A records.\n\n103\n00:04:57,754 --> 00:04:59,220\n>> Quad A, yeah.\n\n104\n00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,530\n>> If I modify,\nI just gonna modify the same command and\n\n105\n00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,120\nI’ll actually just I'll\nleave some of this off.\n\n106\n00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,710\nWe'll go a little more simple on this one.\n\n107\n00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,340\nInstead of -A, I'm gonna say -AAAA,\nright, the quad A record.\n\n108\n00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,212\n>> [LAUGH] That just\ndrives me crazy with that.\n\n109\n00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,260\n>> I'm gonna stick with\nmy same laptop name.\n\n110\n00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,230\nBut then for the IP address, instead of\nsaying IPv4Address, I'll say IPv6Address,\n\n111\n00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,230\nand then what that address is going to be.\n\n112\n00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,810\nSo, I can put in whatever\nmine actually happens to be.\n\n113\n00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,629\nI don't know it, so\nI guess I could make one up.\n\n114\n00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:33,813\nI'll do fd00::1234.\n\n115\n00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:35,100\nIt'll be easy to spot.\n\n116\n00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,435\nAnd so, I could specify that right\nin there, just throw it in, and\n\n117\n00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:40,800\nthen that's gonna be my quad A records.\n\n118\n00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,960\nSo now I've got an IPv6 address,\nand an IPv4 address.\n\n119\n00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,850\nNow, I can verify that in my GUI,\nif I fire up my DNS management tool, here.\n\n120\n00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,932\nI'll go into my forward lookup zone and\nlab.itpro.tv, and\n\n121\n00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:57,240\nthere I can see donlaptop.\n\n122\n00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,836\nHas a host A record, and\nan IPv6 four A record.\n\n123\n00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:03,086\nThey're all right there.\n\n124\n00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:06,380\nThere's that nice,\nunabbreviated address that it added.\n\n125\n00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,920\nSo it's got those addresses.\n\n126\n00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,060\nIf I take a look at that A record, I can\nsee it's got the values and that's it.\n\n127\n00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,150\nI don't see things like time deliver,\ncuz the GUI hides that by default.\n\n128\n00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,420\nI got to turn on the advanced view.\n\n129\n00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,600\nWe're going advanced today, there we go.\n\n130\n00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,080\nBut I can see delete this\nrecord when it becomes stale,\n\n131\n00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,310\ncuz we set that age record option.\n\n132\n00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,299\nI can see my time to live is 1 hour\nright down here, so that's set.\n\n133\n00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:33,971\nSo I can see that information did carry\nover into the record versus my IPv6,\n\n134\n00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:38,570\nwhere I didn't set those, so\nI don't have delete the record, is static,\n\n135\n00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,086\nit's time to live,\nwell I guess the default was an hour.\n\n136\n00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:44,170\n>> The default was set to an hour,\ntoo, so yep.\n\n137\n00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,070\n>> All right, so\nnothing too special there.\n\n138\n00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,260\nBut we can see those records and\nthey're in place.\n\n139\n00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,570\nThose A records and quad A records,\n\n140\n00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,530\nthose are our normal forward lookup\nrecords that we use for hosts.\n\n141\n00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,730\nIt's probably the most common.\n\n142\n00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,876\n>> Yeah, definitely.\nThose are what\n\n143\n00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,610\nwe call the primary resource record types.\n\n144\n00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,260\nGot to have those.\n\n145\n00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,130\nThat way, a client can query DNS or\nwhoever can query DNS, so\n\n146\n00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,000\nthey can get the IP address for\nthe machine they're trying to connect to.\n\n147\n00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,360\nOther records you might need though,\nyou might want to do an alias, right.\n\n148\n00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,320\nA good old C name or\ncanonical name record.\n\n149\n00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,190\nAnd we can add one of those\nwith PowerShell as well.\n\n150\n00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,711\nAnd that just allows me to map\na second name to the same IP address.\n\n151\n00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,340\nA lot of times we'll use that,\nused to use it a lot for www,\n\n152\n00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,103\nI don't see that as much anymore, there's\ndifferent ways we can handle that, but\n\n153\n00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:29,750\njust again, allows you to add\na second name to the same IP address.\n\n154\n00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,150\n>> Yep, so when we run this we would\nbasically just say that we were creating\n\n155\n00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,700\na C name, so instead of -A,\nor -4A, we'd say -C name.\n\n156\n00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,430\nAnd on this one it starts to\nget a little bit different,\n\n157\n00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,188\nwe do have to provide it a name, and\nso we can limit that www model, right.\n\n158\n00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:45,480\nSo I'm gonna pretend that\nI've got a host called www,\n\n159\n00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,350\nand then I'm going to map\nthat to another record.\n\n160\n00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,295\nSo instead of pointing to an IP address,\nI need to point to a other host, and\n\n161\n00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:57,805\nso we'll say -hostNameAlias.\n\n162\n00:07:57,805 --> 00:07:59,511\n>> To me the switches are a little\nbackwards there, aren't they?\n\n163\n00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,923\nI don't know.\nFor me it seems logically the alias would\n\n164\n00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:05,622\nbe the one that I'm giving www, and\nthe name would be Don's laptop.\n\n165\n00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:08,188\nSo, remember that, it's kinda backwards,\nat least in my opinion.\n\n166\n00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,365\n>> Yeah, you're providing\nthe name of the CName record,\n\n167\n00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,620\nnot the name of the actual\nhost that you're pointing to.\n\n168\n00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,360\nIt is a little weird.\n\n169\n00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,860\nBut then we would specify it.\n\n170\n00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,610\nNow, the host name alias isn't\nnecessarily in the same zone.\n\n171\n00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,320\nSo, even though I've got\nthe zone name right here, I'll\n\n172\n00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,950\nhave to provide the fully qualified domain\nname for whoever I'm pointing this to.\n\n173\n00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,686\nSo for example, I've got server\n01 is the server that I'm on.\n\n174\n00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:38,996\nAnd so, I might want to point\nto Server01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n175\n00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,895\nSo, when I do that it'll punch it in.\n\n176\n00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:42,875\nNow, I do have a slight problem,\n\n177\n00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,795\nwhich I don't think I ever created\nan A record for that server.\n\n178\n00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:49,725\nSo, I'm gonna add an A record real quick\nfor that server, just to get it in there,\n\n179\n00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:54,005\nand we'll say that it's, actually I\ndon't know what IP address it is,\n\n180\n00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,985\nI'll just say it's .100.\n\n181\n00:08:55,985 --> 00:08:58,020\nAnd so,\nI'm just gonna add an A record for that.\n\n182\n00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,810\nAnd the reason I'm doing that is\nI need to have an A record for\n\n183\n00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,520\nserver 01 because the CNAME I made\nis gonna do a lookup for that value.\n\n184\n00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,310\n>> A CNAME record doesn't\npoint to an IP address,\n\n185\n00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,990\nit points to a fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n186\n00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,720\nAnd then it's gotta turn around and\nlook up that fully qualified domain name\n\n187\n00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,630\nto get the A record, and that's where it's\ngonna get the IP address for that alias.\n\n188\n00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,410\n>> So, if I do a quick nslookup for\nserver01.lab.itpro.tv, Oh, you know what?\n\n189\n00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,550\nI need to tell it to use\nme as the DNS server.\n\n190\n00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,640\nThere, okay.\n\n191\n00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,507\nSo I get a response back.\n\n192\n00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:32,490\nThe server01 is 10.1.230.100.\n\n193\n00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:39,830\nIf I change that, and do a lookup for\nwww.lab.itpro.tv, I get 10.1.230.100.\n\n194\n00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,240\nI get this same IP.\n\n195\n00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,280\nBut see how it shows that it is an alias.\n\n196\n00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,870\nIt lets me know that it is an alias for\nserver01.\n\n197\n00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,470\nSo it's in place,\nwe've now got that alias.\n\n198\n00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,910\nSo we've seen -A, -4 As,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,010\n>> And dash CName.\n\n200\n00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,090\nSome of the other records we might create?\n\n201\n00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,880\n>> Like a pointer record.\n\n202\n00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,090\nIf we want to set up reverse look up zone,\nso\n\n203\n00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,830\nthat we can look up something by IP\naddress and return the name, right.\n\n204\n00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,060\nNormally you know the name of\nthe node you're trying to connect to.\n\n205\n00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,840\nYou want a return IP address.\n\n206\n00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,970\nIf I have an IP address, like from\na log file or something like that, and\n\n207\n00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,520\nI want to return the name, that's when\nwe need that reverse lookup zones.\n\n208\n00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,263\nFor one, we'll have to make sure\nwe got a reverse lookup zone.\n\n209\n00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:21,450\nIf I can say that, reverse lookup created.\n\n210\n00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,140\nAnd then within that reverse lookup zone,\n\n211\n00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,790\nwe create what we call PTR\nrecords,or pointer records.\n\n212\n00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,695\nAnd they do just\nthe opposite of an A record.\n\n213\n00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:32,520\nThey're going to point an IP address\nback to a fully qualified domain name.\n\n214\n00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,370\n>> So if I wanna create one of those,\nI'm still gonna be working\n\n215\n00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,430\nwithin the add DNS server resource record.\n\n216\n00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,790\nSo that same command.\n\n217\n00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,830\nBut this time, I'm going to\nspecify that I'm doing a name,\n\n218\n00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,880\nand what the name of this\nrecord is going to be.\n\n219\n00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,050\nAnd the name is the IP address, right.\n\n220\n00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,220\nSo the IP address for a host,\n\n221\n00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,710\nlet's say I want to create,\nactually let me just verify here.\n\n222\n00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,250\nI do have a reverse look up zone for\n10.1.230, and it's empty right now,\n\n223\n00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,180\nthere's no PTRs in it.\n\n224\n00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,690\nSo, I'm going to be creating one for\nmy laptop, which I said was .240.\n\n225\n00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,570\nSo for the name,\nI'm just gonna to put 240.\n\n226\n00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,100\n>> Right, because it already knows\nthe prefix for the subnet, right.\n\n227\n00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,500\nSo you just need that last,\nin this case we're using a 24 bit, so\n\n228\n00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,580\nwe need that last octet in there.\n\n229\n00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,790\n>> Right, it’s got to know that part,\nwhich we’ll see here in just a second,\n\n230\n00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,540\nbecause just giving it that,\nthat’s not enough.\n\n231\n00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,610\nRight now it doesn’t know where for\nthat to go.\n\n232\n00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,430\nSo I’m going add to that a little bit with\n-Ptr, and here’s where I’m telling it\n\n233\n00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,980\nthe reverse zone that it’s actually gonna\nfall under, or that it is under, sorry.\n\n234\n00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,700\nAnd then I need to say my zone name.\n\n235\n00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,570\nThere we go, and that’s where\nI’m gonna tell it where to go.\n\n236\n00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,031\nAnd in my case, it's going into this zone.\n\n237\n00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:48,450\nAnd reverse lookup zones have weird names,\nright?\n\n238\n00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,595\nIt's 10.1.230 kind of written in reverse,\n\n239\n00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:57,540\n.in-addr which is internet address .arpa,\nthe whole Internet naming.\n\n240\n00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,228\n>> Reverse resolution protocol, yeah.\n\n241\n00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:00,690\n>> It all kinda came from there.\n\n242\n00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,500\nAnd so,\n\n243\n00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,160\nit's gonna throw all of that in there, and\nthat's how it's gonna know where to go.\n\n244\n00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,310\nAnd if you don't know\nwhat that name should be,\n\n245\n00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,450\nyou can always look in your GUI and\nsee it, right?\n\n246\n00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,100\nIt's got that name right there tied to it.\n\n247\n00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,158\nBut now it's gonna know\nwhere to create it.\n\n248\n00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:19,100\nWe're doing -Ptr, so it knows I'm\ndoing a pointer, -name, and instead of\n\n249\n00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,180\na word like Don laptop, I do 240 and then-\n>> And\n\n250\n00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,200\nthen we have one more little bit there,\nwe're gonna add the ptr domain name.\n\n251\n00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,230\n>> The oh, yep.\n\n252\n00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,393\n>> That still kind of needs that\nfully qualified domain name, or,\n\n253\n00:12:30,393 --> 00:12:32,690\nI think that's what it's\ntrying to do there.\n\n254\n00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,540\n>> Well this is where we have to map\nit back to who it's actually tied to.\n\n255\n00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,230\nSo it now knows that there's a 240,\nbut who does it actually point to?\n\n256\n00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,850\nAnd it's gonna point to, let me,\nmy head's gonna get on top of that.\n\n257\n00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,350\nLet me just move that a little bit.\n\n258\n00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,900\nNot enough.\nBut\n\n259\n00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,800\nnow it needs to know who to point back to.\n\n260\n00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,310\nAnd so, I'll just come in here and\nsay that the pointer domain name,\n\n261\n00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,380\nI now point it to the fully\nqualified domain name of who it is.\n\n262\n00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:02,344\nSo in my case,\nthat's donlaptop.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n263\n00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:07,590\nSo now it knows who that\npointer is attached to.\n\n264\n00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,380\nSo, the name here,\nthat's my IP address, or part of it,\n\n265\n00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,250\nthe rest of it comes from the zone.\n\n266\n00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,240\nAnd then the pointer domain name,\n\n267\n00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,800\nthat's the fully qualified\nhost name that this maps to.\n\n268\n00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,501\nSo now when I do an nslookup for like,\n\n269\n00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:25,484\nDonlaptop.lab.ITPro.TV, I\nget 10.1.230.240.\n\n270\n00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:29,484\nLet me make sure that actually\nran against my own DNS server.\n\n271\n00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:31,540\nThere, it did.\n\n272\n00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,920\nBut if I do that same lookup, not for\nmy host name, but for my IP instead.\n\n273\n00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,620\nIf I say, lookup 10.1.230.240,\nand tell me who has that IP.\n\n274\n00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,360\nWhen it does that lookup,\nit gets Donlaptop.lab.itprotv.\n\n275\n00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,350\nThe result lookup is working.\n\n276\n00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,140\n>> Easy enough.\n\n277\n00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,350\n>> So and I can double-check that\nrecord if I come back here and\n\n278\n00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,830\nI can refresh my zone.\n\n279\n00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,840\nI can see there it is, 10.1.230.240.\n\n280\n00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,740\nThere's a point of record pointing\nto donlaptop, it's right there.\n\n281\n00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,460\n>> So that covers most of our primary,\nwell for connecting to hosts or\n\n282\n00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,270\nnodes on your network.\n\n283\n00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,770\nYou've got your A records, your quad\nA records, and then your PTR records, and\n\n284\n00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,610\nalso RC name records, our aliases.\n\n285\n00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,270\nBut then we also have some other\nrecords that allow me to Find\n\n286\n00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,650\nwhich servers are providing\ndifferent services on the network.\n\n287\n00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,490\nFor example we've got MX records for\nour exchange.\n\n288\n00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,764\nIn fact,\nMike was just mentioning out there.\n\n289\n00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:26,640\nMike, that was a good segway,\nthat's the next one we're gonna hit here,\n\n290\n00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,650\nis an exchange record or\nan exchanger record, or an MX record.\n\n291\n00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,270\nAnd again, the syntax is very similar.\n\n292\n00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,290\nYou can see that it's still gonna\nbe the Add-DnsServerResourceRecord.\n\n293\n00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,480\nJust gonna specify a different type\nof record that we're gonna create.\n\n294\n00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,610\nAnd this one's gonna require\na little bit different information.\n\n295\n00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,980\n>> Yeah, these are weird.\n\n296\n00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,620\nMail exchange change records\nare just outright weird.\n\n297\n00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,390\nSo when we go to add one,\nwe have to give it a name.\n\n298\n00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,820\nBut the name is pretty particular,\nso I'm gonna give it a name.\n\n299\n00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,741\nAnd the name is going to be .-MX.\n\n300\n00:14:55,741 --> 00:15:00,920\nOops, actually that's actually not right,\nis it?\n\n301\n00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,450\nIt just needs to be the name is dot.\n\n302\n00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,560\nSo, the MX record doesn't\ntechnically have a name.\n\n303\n00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,380\nIt is an MX record, and\nthen, in its return value,\n\n304\n00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,440\nit contains a list of servers.\n\n305\n00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,640\nSo the name is kind of an odd one,\nand let's see,\n\n306\n00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,340\nthat should be happy with the dot.\n\n307\n00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,805\nThere are some times\nwhere you need to do a-\n\n308\n00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:21,435\n>> Just leave it blank, or?\n\n309\n00:15:21,435 --> 00:15:24,510\n>> You can leave it blank,\nor you can do an @ symbol.\n\n310\n00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,790\nLet's give it a shot here\nwith just leaving it blank,\n\n311\n00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,070\nso that it knows that it\ndoesn't actually have a name.\n\n312\n00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,140\nAnd then after that, we say -MX, so\nthat it knows that it's an MX record.\n\n313\n00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,027\nAnd then we need to follow it up with\nwhat zone that we're gonna to be\n\n314\n00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:36,200\ncreating this in.\n\n315\n00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,160\nSo I'm creating a record for\nlab at itpro.tv.\n\n316\n00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,390\nAnd then, inside of lab.itpro.tv,\nI create this MX record.\n\n317\n00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,520\nNow it needs to know what\nservers are gonna be tied to it.\n\n318\n00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,409\nSo I've gotta provide a little\nmore information than what\n\n319\n00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,186\nwe've got right here.\n\n320\n00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:53,897\nSo I'm gonna say -MailExchange.\n\n321\n00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:58,877\nAnd then the server or servers,\nyou may have more than one.\n\n322\n00:15:58,877 --> 00:15:59,400\nServer.\n\n323\n00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,745\nMx record is really like a text field, and\n\n324\n00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:04,990\nyou can have several servers\nthat are inside of it.\n\n325\n00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,210\nI'm gonna add just one.\n\n326\n00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,980\nI'll do mail.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n327\n00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,600\nwhich is not a real server, but\nI'll punch that one in there.\n\n328\n00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,560\nAnd, you can have preference,\nor a weight, to them.\n\n329\n00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,170\nSo if you have multiple servers,\nwhich one do you go to first.\n\n330\n00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,860\nIt's a numerical value.\n\n331\n00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,185\nThe lower the number,\nthe more preferred the server is.\n\n332\n00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,741\nSo, most people usually do like 10,\n20, 30, 40.\n\n333\n00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:29,621\nBut you could do 1, 2, 3, 4 if you wanted.\n\n334\n00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,200\nYou've got some flexibility.\n\n335\n00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,859\nI'm going to do let's see,\nI'll do -Preference 10.\n\n336\n00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:38,950\nSo, that's pretty common right there.\n\n337\n00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,730\nSo, let's run that, and it actually got a\nlittle upset about that name [CROSSTALK].\n\n338\n00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,198\n>> Yeah, let me throw that back in.\n\n339\n00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:45,596\nWe'll make it happy.\n\n340\n00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:49,020\nThere's our dot.\n\n341\n00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,090\n>> There we go, that looks better.\n\n342\n00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,220\nSo, it did complain and\nneeded that dot in there,\n\n343\n00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,260\njust so it knew that it was kind of an\nempty value, so now I've got an MX record,\n\n344\n00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,670\nthat points to mail.lab.itpro.tv, and it's\ngot a preference of 10, and it's in place.\n\n345\n00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,470\nNow, I do want to verify that\njust to make sure it's clear.\n\n346\n00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,720\nI'll go back here to my\nforward lookup zone and\n\n347\n00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,660\nI'll just refresh that real quick.\n\n348\n00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,310\nAnd now I can see that I've got\na mail exchanger record right here.\n\n349\n00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,490\nAnd see how for\nthe name it says same as parent folder.\n\n350\n00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,760\nThat's what the dot means.\n\n351\n00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,070\nThat means this is a mail exchanger,\nnot for just an individual host,\n\n352\n00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,880\nbut for lab.itpro.tv.\n\n353\n00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,170\nAnd then it's got mail.lab.itpro.tv\nright there, with a preference of 10.\n\n354\n00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,375\n>> And one of the things I like\nto do when I'm working is,\n\n355\n00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,140\na lot of us have used the GUI for\na long time, the GUI.\n\n356\n00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,570\nAnd now we're starting to use PowerShell\nto get a little more Administrative,\n\n357\n00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,950\ngetting more powerful with our\nadministration, be able to script things,\n\n358\n00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,040\nautomate things.\n\n359\n00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,130\nBut I always like to think about,\nokay when I was in the GUI,\n\n360\n00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,430\nwhat did I have to fill in?\n\n361\n00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,439\nThink about the wizard that you went\nthrough cuz you're providing all\n\n362\n00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:52,815\nof the same information in this PowerShell\ncommand that you would in the GUIs.\n\n363\n00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:56,815\nSo if you right-click New MX Record,\nalways leave that first line blank.\n\n364\n00:17:56,815 --> 00:18:00,715\nAnd it says it's gonna use the parent\ndomain name if you do that.\n\n365\n00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,365\nKinda helps remember what\nswitches I need to do and\n\n366\n00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:03,932\nwhat values I need to put in there.\n\n367\n00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,052\n>> Yep.\n\n368\n00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:08,592\nThe last record type we wanna talk\nabout is probably the weirdest.\n\n369\n00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:10,582\nWe saw with MX servers,\nor mail exchangers,\n\n370\n00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:16,200\nthat's a pretty specific example of a\nservice that's directly supported by DNS.\n\n371\n00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,570\nThe people that designed this whole\nnaming service, they said you know what,\n\n372\n00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,260\nwe don't wanna keep adding specific\nrecords for services out there.\n\n373\n00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,720\nSo instead they created a generic\nservice type resource record,\n\n374\n00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,180\nwhich is called an SRV record, and SRVs\ncan point to any service that's out there.\n\n375\n00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,390\nIf they had to do it all over again today,\nwe wouldn't have MX records,\n\n376\n00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,990\ninstead they would use SRV records also.\n\n377\n00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,180\nBut we have SRV records for\neverything else.\n\n378\n00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,140\nThe active directory uses the heck out of\nthese, but there are other programs and\n\n379\n00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,170\nprotocols that can make use of it too,\nso we do see these quite a bit.\n\n380\n00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,325\nSRV records,\nDNS doesn't really know what they are.\n\n381\n00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:55,845\nSo we have to provide a lot of\nadditional information to them so\n\n382\n00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,715\nit knows exactly what to\nhand off to the clients.\n\n383\n00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,365\nAll right, so let me show you\nan example of an SRV record.\n\n384\n00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:05,005\nMike, you put one in the show notes which\nis an example for finding a SIP server for\n\n385\n00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:06,880\nvoice over IP.\n\n386\n00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,320\nSo if I wanna add that,\nI'll do the Add-DnsServerResourceRecord,\n\n387\n00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,250\nlike we've been doing, but\nI'm gonna modify this just a little bit.\n\n388\n00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,300\nI need to tell it we're doing\nan SRV record, so I'll say, -Srv.\n\n389\n00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,250\nI need to give it a name, and\nwe're just gonna call this one sip.\n\n390\n00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,510\nSo, this will be sip.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n391\n00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,970\nAll right, I need to give it a zone name.\n\n392\n00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,850\nWhich will be lab.itpro.tv.\n\n393\n00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,620\nSo there I'm defining what the record\nis going to be called, and\n\n394\n00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,640\nthen I need to tell it\nwhat it's going to be.\n\n395\n00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,680\nNow, SRV records, a lot like mail\nexchanges have what they are,\n\n396\n00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,440\nthey have their preference, which one's\nhigher priority, or lower priority, so\n\n397\n00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,060\nI need to give that.\n\n398\n00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,980\nNow, instead of preference\nthey do call it priority.\n\n399\n00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,540\nSo I'll give this one a priority of 0,\nlower number is better.\n\n400\n00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,360\nI can give it a weight which\nsays if there's a tie, if\n\n401\n00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,820\nI have two servers at the same priority,\nhow do I divide my traffic up amongst it.\n\n402\n00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,220\nMaybe I want half my traffic to go one and\nhalf my traffic to go with another.\n\n403\n00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,960\nI can specify that with a weight value.\n\n404\n00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,990\nAnd then, because it doesn't know\nwhat kind of software this is,\n\n405\n00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,280\nI need to give it a port number.\n\n406\n00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,960\nWhen we connect to this,\nit needs to know what port to use and\n\n407\n00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,890\nsip usually uses 5060, 5-0-6-0,\nso I'll punch that in.\n\n408\n00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,900\nSo now, any VoIP phone on my network, if\nit's looking for a SIP server, it can just\n\n409\n00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,530\nlook for sip.lab.itprotv and it's gonna\nreturn that, oh yeah, yeah, that exists.\n\n410\n00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,860\nWe've got a SIP service.\n\n411\n00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,230\nIt's on port 5060.\n\n412\n00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,320\nAnd it's tied to a particular host.\n\n413\n00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,710\nAnd that's the last time\nI need to throw in here.\n\n414\n00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,360\nWhich is -DomainName.\n\n415\n00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,590\n>> It's a lot like your C\nname records on any of these.\n\n416\n00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,980\nIt doesn't point to an IP address.\n\n417\n00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,719\nIt points back to a fully qualified domain\nname, and then it's gonna turn around and\n\n418\n00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,315\nlook at the A record for\nthat fully qualified domain name.\n\n419\n00:20:57,315 --> 00:21:03,238\n>> Yep, so then I might have a server on\nmy network that is server01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n420\n00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:07,860\nMaybe that's running some kind of PBX\nsoftware, or some kind of VoIP system.\n\n421\n00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,590\nAnd so,\nthat's what people are gonna reach out to,\n\n422\n00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,130\nthat's the record this\nis all gonna point to.\n\n423\n00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,770\nSo, when I run that, that gets created,\nand now I've got this SRV record.\n\n424\n00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,244\nNow, a lot of companies like Microsoft,\nwhenever they give it a name for\n\n425\n00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,990\nSRV records,\nthey'll start it with an underscore.\n\n426\n00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,960\nYou don't have to do that, but\nmost people do because it makes it easy\n\n427\n00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,290\nvisually to recognize that hey\nthis is a service not a host.\n\n428\n00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,450\nNo host name would ever\nstart with an underscore,\n\n429\n00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,350\nin fact with DNS names you're typically\nnot allowed to use an underscore.\n\n430\n00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,510\nAnd so that really separates out\nSRV records from normal records.\n\n431\n00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,840\nBut if I go back to my GUI here, if I go\nto lab.itpro.tv, and I'll just refresh\n\n432\n00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,340\nthat, I should now have this SRV record\nright here, Service Location Record.\n\n433\n00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,200\nIt's called sip, and\nit points to server01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n434\n00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,030\nIt's on port 5060 and\nit's got a priority and weight of 0.\n\n435\n00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,860\nThe record is created and it's there.\n\n436\n00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,410\n>> Beautiful thing.\n\n437\n00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,170\n>> And with all of these commands, I've\nbeen using Add-DnsServerResourceRecord.\n\n438\n00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,320\nYou've also got\nSet-DnsServerResourceRecord,\n\n439\n00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,670\nwhich lets you modify these if you need\nto change values on them after the fact.\n\n440\n00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,040\nBut otherwise, creating the records\nis pretty straight forward.\n\n441\n00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,340\nThere are other records that are out\nthere, like NS records, and so on.\n\n442\n00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,280\nThey're a lot less commonly modified, so\nwe won't tackle them here in the show.\n\n443\n00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,235\nBut if you ever pull up\nthe help documentation for\n\n444\n00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:31,450\nAdd-DnsServerResourceRecord, you'll see\nall the other types that are out there.\n\n445\n00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,950\nBut the ones we've shown are the ones\nthat most people are going to work\n\n446\n00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,710\nwith on a regular basis.\n\n447\n00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,500\nAll right so in this segment, we got a\nchance to see creating those host records.\n\n448\n00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,502\nPutting it in place,\nverifying that it actually took effect,\n\n449\n00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:45,380\nthat they're there and\nthat they're working.\n\n450\n00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,290\nSo we saw several of different\nresource types that were out there.\n\n451\n00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,150\nKeep in mind that there are others\nthat you might want to learn about.\n\n452\n00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,188\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed that segment.\n\n453\n00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:58,659\nStay tuned,\nwe got more PowerShell, coming up.\n\n454\n00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:02,700\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,333\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,099\nIn this segment,\n\n3\n00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,020\nwe're gonna take a look at monitoring\nthe status of our DNS server.\n\n4\n00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,190\nYou know, once we get DNS fired up and\nrunning, we get our zones created,\n\n5\n00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,670\nour records in there and\nit's working, that's great.\n\n6\n00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,670\nBut how do we keep an eye\non it performance-wise?\n\n7\n00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,030\nIf you're at the machine,\nyou could use your graphical utilities,\n\n8\n00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,110\nthings like a performance monitor.\n\n9\n00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,070\nThey're fine.\n\n10\n00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,540\nBut in the PowerShell, we've got a couple\nof neat commands that we can use.\n\n11\n00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,100\nSome of them, you guys are probably\nalready familiar with.\n\n12\n00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,890\nLike, if I just want to see if the service\nis running, I can do a Get-Service dns.\n\n13\n00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,850\nThat's not anything too exciting, here,\n\n14\n00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,430\nlet me fire that up,\nin a Powershell prompt.\n\n15\n00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,865\nAnd I'll just do Get-Service dns,\nand I can see it's running.\n\n16\n00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:43,440\nWoo-hoo!\n\n17\n00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,940\nRight?\n\n18\n00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,632\nWe're in business.\n\n19\n00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:46,340\n>> [LAUGH] It's a good start.\n\n20\n00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,750\n>> That's great, but wouldn't it be\ngreat to have better insight into what\n\n21\n00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,960\nthe server's actually doing.\n\n22\n00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,110\nAnd for that,\nwe've got a couple of other neat commands.\n\n23\n00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,200\n>> Got that good old Get-DnsServer.\n\n24\n00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,360\nAnd this command is gonna pull back all\nthe configurations on my DNS server.\n\n25\n00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,390\nYou get to see things like what my, I'm\ntrying to think of some of the good ones\n\n26\n00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,430\nwe use, like the socket pool size,\nand things like that.\n\n27\n00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,493\nI mean,\nit shows a ton of information in here.\n\n28\n00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:12,250\n>> I'm gonna pipe this\ninto the more command.\n\n29\n00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,371\n>> Yeah, probably a good idea.\n\n30\n00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,401\n[LAUGH]\n>> So Get-DnsServer,\n\n31\n00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,734\nit returns really information\nabout your server configuration.\n\n32\n00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:20,950\nRight?\n\n33\n00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,780\nAll the various that it's got configured,\n\n34\n00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,380\na lot of these are gonna be defaults\nthat you haven't messed with.\n\n35\n00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,130\nSome of them will be the other things\nthat maybe you have messed with.\n\n36\n00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,950\nThen you can go in there and evaluate.\n\n37\n00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,208\nYou guys see all the different\nthings we can query on.\n\n38\n00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,592\nSo if you're trying to verify\na server's configuration,\n\n39\n00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:38,361\nthis is the command for\nyou, Get-DnsServer.\n\n40\n00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:41,520\nAnd when Mike says there's a lot of\nstuff in there, he is not lying.\n\n41\n00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,270\nThere is a ton of information in here.\n\n42\n00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,292\nAs we scroll through,\nyou'll just see there is quite a bit.\n\n43\n00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:48,360\n>> I'm trying to think of some of\nthe things I've used this for.\n\n44\n00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,320\nPrimarily, one was the saga pool size,\n\n45\n00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,090\ncuz you can change the amount of\nports that are available for that.\n\n46\n00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,840\nThe other one is that caching right there,\nI think is, where is it?\n\n47\n00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,300\nNo, not the caching.\n\n48\n00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,910\nAnyway, there's a couple\nof them in there like the,\n\n49\n00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,584\noh how long it stays locked\nwhen you get cache, right?\n\n50\n00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,799\nCuz we can now change that\nlocking percentage, so\n\n51\n00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,720\nit's a quick easy command\nto see what it's set to.\n\n52\n00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,640\n>> Yeah, I know I've manipulated some\nof this like this max time to live.\n\n53\n00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,260\nSometimes you don't want to have\na time to live that's and entire day,\n\n54\n00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,500\nwhich is the default.\n\n55\n00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,850\nSo you can in and manipulate that.\n\n56\n00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,040\nAnd that way if you try and\ncache a record from the Internet, and\n\n57\n00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,840\nthey say that it's going to be 72 hours.\n\n58\n00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,580\nWell, if your server has\na maximum of 12 hours,\n\n59\n00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,770\nit will ignore the 72 and make it 12.\n\n60\n00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,420\nRight?\n\n61\n00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,625\nSo you can manipulate those things.\n\n62\n00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,620\nYou need to be able to verify\nthose settings right here.\n\n63\n00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,470\nIt's all kind of tucked away in it.\n\n64\n00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,100\nThere's a route hint servers\nthat are listed, and so on.\n\n65\n00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,260\nIt goes on and on.\n\n66\n00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,312\nSo quite a bit of data in there on\nthe configuration of your server.\n\n67\n00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:40,833\n>> All right.\n\n68\n00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,700\nAnd then we can change that to a\nSet-DnsServer if we want to modify some of\n\n69\n00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,500\nthose parameters.\n\n70\n00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n71\n00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,160\nAnother one that we've got\nis Get-DnsServerStatistics.\n\n72\n00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,900\n>> This is a new one that came out\nrecently, when they added a bunch of new\n\n73\n00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,960\ncommands to the DNS module, and this one\npulls back a lot of information as well.\n\n74\n00:02:59,095 --> 00:02:59,915\n>> Now when you run it,\n\n75\n00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:04,525\nthe default is going to give you\nstatistics on the DNS server as a whole.\n\n76\n00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:06,645\nAnd that [LAUGH] can be\na ton of information.\n\n77\n00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,896\nSome of it's pretty handy,\n\n78\n00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,293\nyou can see how long it's been since\nthe last time the statistics were reset.\n\n79\n00:03:11,293 --> 00:03:15,498\nAnd then you can start to see information\nabout how many queries it's handled,\n\n80\n00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:19,137\nyou know what it's response times are,\nany other information, and\n\n81\n00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:21,730\nit is screen after screen\nafter screen of stuff.\n\n82\n00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,970\nIt can be quite a bit.\n\n83\n00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,460\n>> And if you have multiple\nzones on that DNS server,\n\n84\n00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,630\nthis is just gonna summarize it.\n\n85\n00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,910\nSo it's going to take all the information\nfrom all the zones and summarize and\n\n86\n00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,650\ngive you one report back.\n\n87\n00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,060\nBut we can also throw in a name of a zone.\n\n88\n00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,720\nWhat if we want to see the statistics\non a particular zone that this DNS\n\n89\n00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,780\nserver is handling?\n\n90\n00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,440\nAll we have to do is do that same\ncommand and then do a dash zone name,\n\n91\n00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,950\ntype in the name of the zone, and\nnow we're seeing zone specific statistics.\n\n92\n00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,610\n>> Yep.\nSo that kind of filters things out.\n\n93\n00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,290\nThat's good, because a lot of those\nscreens are caching related, and\n\n94\n00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,070\nwe don't necessarily need to see\nthose when we're looking for\n\n95\n00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,400\ninformation on a particular zone.\n\n96\n00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,960\nSo I can see this zone has\nhandled a whopping five queries,\n\n97\n00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,420\nit's running here on my laptop.\n\n98\n00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So we're not gonna see\n\n99\n00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,240\na ton of stuff there.\n\n100\n00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,550\nQueries that I've responded to.\n\n101\n00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,550\nQuery failures, right?\n\n102\n00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,043\nWe can see other things like\nthose are just the A records.\n\n103\n00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:09,920\nI can see the quad A records,\npointers, CName.\n\n104\n00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,590\nI'm getting statistics for\neach of these, so\n\n105\n00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,550\nI can get an idea of how much traffic\nthis server has been handling, and\n\n106\n00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,505\nit breaks all of those out into\nthe individual record types.\n\n107\n00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:19,400\nRight?\n\n108\n00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,160\nAnd so past that I start to get the zone\ntransfer information this AXFR and\n\n109\n00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,600\nIXFR, those are my zone transfers.\n\n110\n00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,270\nSo, I can see how much have I send out,\n\n111\n00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,560\nhow much have I received, how much\ndata really is this server moving.\n\n112\n00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,330\n>> Absolutely.\n\n113\n00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,950\n>> And so, it all gets laid out there,\nand it's pretty handy.\n\n114\n00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,280\nThe only problem is, the statistics,\n\n115\n00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,800\nthey've really been running since\nDNS was installed in this server.\n\n116\n00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,540\nSo if you've got a DNS server that's been\nup for a year, you're seeing information\n\n117\n00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,160\nabout how much that server's done in\nthat year, you might want to clear out\n\n118\n00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,580\nthe statistics to start from scratch and\nsay, I just want to see the last 24 hours.\n\n119\n00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,730\nSo let's clear it out, let it run for\n24 hours, and then look.\n\n120\n00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,910\nSo you might need to wipe those\nstatistics from time to time, and\n\n121\n00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,750\nyou do that with the, actually\nwith the Get-DnsServer statistics.\n\n122\n00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,270\nIt's one of those weird times where\nthe get command can actually do something.\n\n123\n00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,042\n>> Yeah, it's gonna return all of\nthe information at the same time, wipe it.\n\n124\n00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,930\nSo it might be something\nyou wanna pipe out,\n\n125\n00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,975\nlike we saw in a couple\nof the other segments.\n\n126\n00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:20,190\nPipe that result out to a text file or\nsomething to save that information.\n\n127\n00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,600\nSo if I add dash clear to the end of it,\nright, that's gonna wipe those statistics\n\n128\n00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,230\nand now when I pull it back up, see all\nmy queries have been reset to zeroes.\n\n129\n00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,620\nJust by adding that dash clear, that reset\nit and now as we start to do look ups.\n\n130\n00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,602\nSo if I start looking up\nlike donlaptop.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n131\n00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:41,000\nagainst my server, right?\n\n132\n00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,633\nSo I'll do a couple other queries,\n\n133\n00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:47,060\nactually I'm probably gonna start pulling\nthose off of my own local cache, won't I?\n\n134\n00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,875\nWell no,\nI don't think nslookup ever does that.\n\n135\n00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,914\nWell, we can find out.\n\n136\n00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:51,458\n>> [CROSSTALK] Nslookup\nshould bypass the cache.\n\n137\n00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,420\nThere we go.\n\n138\n00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,520\nAnd so I can see there are those four\nqueries that I just ran right there.\n\n139\n00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,167\nI can see it, they did the look ups.\n\n140\n00:05:57,167 --> 00:06:00,597\nIt did the look up for the four A record\nalso, because I gave it a name and\n\n141\n00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:01,833\nthere are multiple IPs.\n\n142\n00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,282\nSo it shows up, but\neverything else is still zeroed out,\n\n143\n00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,667\ncuz I haven't looked those up.\n\n144\n00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:06,730\nAll right.\n\n145\n00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,612\nSo, couple of good ways to\nsee the statistics there.\n\n146\n00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:12,125\nNow you could use your\nperformance monitor, right?\n\n147\n00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,084\nYour service profile.\n\n148\n00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,042\nThere's all those different tools out\nthere that monitor it with a GUI.\n\n149\n00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:21,727\nAnd they give you a lot of power in\nlogging and so on, but if you just want\n\n150\n00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:26,150\nquick and easy, look at it, get some\ninformation, Get-DnsServerStatistics.\n\n151\n00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,062\nIt's a great utility for you.\n\n152\n00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:28,458\nAll right.\n\n153\n00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,368\nSo in this segment we got a chance\nto see a few different ways to\n\n154\n00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:34,870\nmonitor performance on our servers,\nstatistics on our server.\n\n155\n00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,025\nWe saw Get-Service,\njust to make sure the service was running.\n\n156\n00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:41,316\nGet-DnsServer to look at\nthe configuration and\n\n157\n00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:46,542\nGet-DnsServerStatistics to look at\nour actual performance information.\n\n158\n00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:51,319\nOne other thing if you guys want to learn\na little bit more, Mike was showing me\n\n159\n00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,950\nright before the show that with\na Get-DnsServer, you can actually export\n\n160\n00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:01,123\nthat XML to back up that configuration and\nrestore it on another server if you want.\n\n161\n00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:02,410\nSo there's some neat utilities out there.\n\n162\n00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,750\nMike, do you remember\nwhat that command was?\n\n163\n00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,944\n>> It was,\nyou could do that same Get-DnsServer, and\n\n164\n00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:09,122\nthen you do an Export-Clixml, and\n\n165\n00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:14,292\nthat's gonna generate an XML file with all\nthe configuration from that DNS server.\n\n166\n00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,339\nSo as Don was saying, I can use it as\na backup, if I ever have a problem,\n\n167\n00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:18,960\nI can restore my server.\n\n168\n00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,650\nOr if I wanna set up another DNS server\nwith those same configurations, I can use\n\n169\n00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,990\nthat XML file, that it generated, to\nmove those settings to a new DNS server.\n\n170\n00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,160\n>> Yeah, so pretty cool stuff there.\n\n171\n00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,870\nYou know PowerShell has\na lot of power to it.\n\n172\n00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,509\nEvery time we say there's\na command missing,\n\n173\n00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:35,083\nwell there's like 15 other awesome\ncommands that are already there.\n\n174\n00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,250\nSo it's just a matter of figuring\nthem out and putting them to use.\n\n175\n00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:38,876\n>> It is.\n\n176\n00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,195\n>> All right.\nWell, that's about it for\n\n177\n00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,510\nmonitoring DNS statistics.\n\n178\n00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,070\nHope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n179\n00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,042\nStay tuned, we've got more\nPowerShell coming down the line.\n\n180\n00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:53,984\n{MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,378\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:11,836\nIn this segment, we're going to take\na look at installing DHCP server,\n\n3\n00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:14,020\nusing the Microsoft Power Shell.\n\n4\n00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,440\nIt's not really any different\nthan any other role or feature.\n\n5\n00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,770\nIt's a pretty straight forward install.\n\n6\n00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,110\nThis'll be a short segment.\n\n7\n00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,220\nBut we need to see it nonetheless.\n\n8\n00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,760\nIf you're going to set up a DHCP server,\n\n9\n00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,380\nthis is really going\nto be step number one.\n\n10\n00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,540\nWell, step number one I guess\nafter getting a server, right?\n\n11\n00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,590\nProbably have to have a server\nsomewhere to do this.\n\n12\n00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,330\nBut to add the DHCP server functionality\nto a Windows server machine.\n\n13\n00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,100\nWe just use the add Windows feature\ncommand line that we've seen for\n\n14\n00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,370\npretty much every other role.\n\n15\n00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,930\nSo I'm going to fire up my PowerShell,\nand I'm gonna have at it.\n\n16\n00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,910\nWell, I guess before I do that\nmaybe I should verify whether or\n\n17\n00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,450\nnot I'm actually running DHCP server.\n\n18\n00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,040\n>> That's a good idea.\n\n19\n00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,160\nInstead of an install we\ncould do a get command.\n\n20\n00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,660\n>> Yeah.\n\n21\n00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,050\nSo, we'll just do a get-windowsfeature and\n\n22\n00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,760\nif I just run that by itself,\nman do you get some outputs.\n\n23\n00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,758\nSo, I'm gonna make sure to qualify\nthat and just stick dhcp on the end.\n\n24\n00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:02,385\nI'll say get-windowsfeature dhcp.\n\n25\n00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:07,265\nThat'll run pretty quick, and there I\ncan see DHCP Server is recognized, but\n\n26\n00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:08,045\nit's not installed.\n\n27\n00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:09,875\nIt's got an empty little box right there.\n\n28\n00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,385\nInstall state is available.\n\n29\n00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:14,136\nIt's available to be installed, but\nit's not actually installed yet.\n\n30\n00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:15,464\n>> Let's do it.\n\n31\n00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:20,332\n>> So we'll just go ahead and\nsay add-windowsFeature dhcp.\n\n32\n00:01:20,332 --> 00:01:22,372\nThat's all we need to\ndo to do the install.\n\n33\n00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:25,532\nNow, if I'm on a server\nthat's a core server install.\n\n34\n00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:29,296\nSo no GUI,\nthat's really all I need to run.\n\n35\n00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:31,936\n>> Right?\n>> But I'm on a full install, and so\n\n36\n00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:34,436\nI might want to install\nthe management tools also.\n\n37\n00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:38,476\nIt doesn't do that by default, so I may\nneed to add a little bit more to this.\n\n38\n00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:41,713\nTo say, include management tools.\n\n39\n00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:44,073\nSo that it knows to put those on there.\n\n40\n00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:45,463\nAnd I'll get the graphical tools also.\n\n41\n00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:48,643\nIf we're just working in PowerShell\nwe don't care about that.\n\n42\n00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:51,233\nbut in my case we'll go ahead and do it.\n\n43\n00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,240\nAll right.\nSo we'll run that and it'll install.\n\n44\n00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,170\nDoesn't take terribly long to do it,\nright.\n\n45\n00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,162\nDHCP's not the biggest of services.\n\n46\n00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:58,190\n>> Right.\nThat's what I always tell people.\n\n47\n00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,180\nYou know,\ninstalling the roles is very easy.\n\n48\n00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,030\nIt's configuring the roles after the fact,\nand\n\n49\n00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,920\nmaking it do what you need\nit to do on your network.\n\n50\n00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,150\nThat's where the skill set\nreally comes into play.\n\n51\n00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,950\n>> Yeah.\nOnce this is done, you know what,\n\n52\n00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,040\nif you had to describe it, Mike.\n\n53\n00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,720\nWhat exactly would the DHCP server\ndo after this install is done?\n\n54\n00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,830\n>> Absolutely nothing.\n\n55\n00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,690\n>> Absolutely nothing.\n\n56\n00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,360\nYeah, it's non functional.\n\n57\n00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,130\nThere is a lot more to do, but\nthe install is pretty straight forward.\n\n58\n00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,620\nAnd you know I say it\ndoesn't take to long.\n\n59\n00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,100\nIn typical Microsoft fashion it\njumps to 92% and then sits there.\n\n60\n00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,050\n>> And it just stops.\n\n61\n00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,570\n>> So there we go.\n\n62\n00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,190\nI can see that it did finish the install.\n\n63\n00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,530\nSuccess is true.\n\n64\n00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,730\nRestart needed, no.\n\n65\n00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,940\nSo I don't need to reboot.\n\n66\n00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,720\nThat's kind of nice.\n\n67\n00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,850\nI got a success.\n\n68\n00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,200\nIf I just want to do a double\nsuper secret verification.\n\n69\n00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,090\nI can go a get-windowsfeature dhcp,\nand this time we should see that\n\n70\n00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,570\nit's got a little check mark letting us\nknow that it's installed on X, I think.\n\n71\n00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,270\nAn X.\n\n72\n00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,580\nAnd then over here,\ninstall state is installed.\n\n73\n00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,590\nSo I've got it.\n\n74\n00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,630\nAnd I could even go a little bit\nfurther and do a get-service.\n\n75\n00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,330\nWell that really didn't pan out, did it?\n\n76\n00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,950\nThere, get-service DHCP.\n\n77\n00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,090\nAnd I can see, oh,\nthat's my client though.\n\n78\n00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,410\nShoot, let me just add a star on that.\n\n79\n00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,270\nThere we go.\nGet-Service DHCP Server is what\n\n80\n00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,110\nit's actually called.\n\n81\n00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,420\nAnd I can see the server is there,\nand it's running.\n\n82\n00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,590\nSo we're installed,\nwe are now a DHCP server.\n\n83\n00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,710\nAlbeit, not a very functional one.\n\n84\n00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,070\n>> Right.\n\n85\n00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,580\n>> All right, so like I said,\npretty short segment on this one.\n\n86\n00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,550\nWhat we just saw was installing\nDHCP server using the PowerShell.\n\n87\n00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,525\nNow if you're asking yourself why did I\njust waste my time watching this episode?\n\n88\n00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:29,614\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well it is important, but keep in mind,\n\n89\n00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:33,089\nwe're right about to follow that up with\nmore segments covering how to get it\n\n90\n00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,686\nconfigured and actually useful.\n\n91\n00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:36,392\nSo definitely stay tuned for that.\n\n92\n00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:39,298\nThere's more PowerShell coming up.\n\n93\n00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:45,349\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900\n[SOUND] In this segment, we're gonna\n\n2\n00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,273\ntake a look at an often overlooked step,\n\n3\n00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:15,184\nwhich is authorizing a DHCP server.\n\n4\n00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:19,882\nNow, we have to authorize a DHCP server\nif we have a Windows DHCP server in\n\n5\n00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:22,040\na domain environment.\n\n6\n00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,630\nWhen you have the active\ndirectory present,\n\n7\n00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,190\nit will purposefully suppress\nany DHCP server you bring up.\n\n8\n00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,670\nIt will not allow it to\nfunction unless it's\n\n9\n00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,890\nbeen authorized by\na network administrator.\n\n10\n00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,375\nThis is something really easy\nto overlook from the PowerShell.\n\n11\n00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:38,585\nIn the GUI when you're setting this up,\nyou get little red flags, warning messages\n\n12\n00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:42,045\nthat you're not authorized, but\nfrom the PowerShell you don't get those.\n\n13\n00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:44,915\nSo if you just installed your DHCP server,\nit's not gonna function.\n\n14\n00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:48,260\nYou might set up your scopes, your\nexclusions, and all that, and it won't\n\n15\n00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,050\nfunction until you authorize it, so\nwe definitely need to take a look at that.\n\n16\n00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,100\n>> And Active Directory maintains a list\nof authorized DHCP servers, so really all\n\n17\n00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,760\nwe're doing is we're adding the name of an\nIP address for this server to that list.\n\n18\n00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,870\nAnd then every time that machine starts\nup, every time DHCP service starts up,\n\n19\n00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,130\nit queries Active Directory and\nsays, hey let me look at that list.\n\n20\n00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,270\nAm I in that list and if it's not in\nthe list, the service will start up, but\n\n21\n00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,070\nit will report an error, and\nit just won't service clients.\n\n22\n00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,313\n>> Yeah and\nI'm glad you mentioned that, Mike.\n\n23\n00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:15,172\nLet's take a look at that list.\n\n24\n00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:18,100\nWe can actually pull the list of\nDHCP servers that are approved.\n\n25\n00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,919\nI'm gonna see if I'm in that list.\n\n26\n00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,540\nThe command for it is,\nit’s not very intuitive,\n\n27\n00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,960\nbecause you’d think it would have\nauthorize in the name, but it doesn’t.\n\n28\n00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,997\nSo I’m gonna say Get-DHCPServerInDC.\n\n29\n00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:34,381\nAll right, in other words,\nreach out to a domain controller, and\n\n30\n00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:36,670\nsee what DHCP servers are listed.\n\n31\n00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,655\nNow, if you run it and\nyou get nothing back,\n\n32\n00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,864\nthat means you have no\nauthorized DHCP servers.\n\n33\n00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,232\nIf you do have some DHCP servers out\nthere, they'll be listed right here, and\n\n34\n00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:46,950\nyou can see which servers\nare already authorized, all right.\n\n35\n00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,800\nIn my case, I've installed DHCP,\nor at least I think I have.\n\n36\n00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,520\nIf I do get Windows feature DHCP, let's\nsee if I've actually got it installed.\n\n37\n00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,913\nSo I should have DHCP installed.\n\n38\n00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:03,260\nYeah, I do, but I'm not gonna function\nunless I authorize the server, so\n\n39\n00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,930\nlet's get this thing authorized.\n\n40\n00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,060\nNow authorizing it is not hard, but\n\n41\n00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,740\nit is easy to forget, and\nthe command is a little bit long.\n\n42\n00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,586\nWhat we need to do is\nsay Add-DHCPServerInDC,\n\n43\n00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:22,160\nall right, and then we need to provide\nthe information about this system.\n\n44\n00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,165\nSo I am gonna do the DNS name for\nthis server, and mine is server01.,\n\n45\n00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:31,650\noh shoot,\nI've actually forgotten what my domain is.\n\n46\n00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,078\n[LAUGH] That's always convenient,\nisn't it?\n\n47\n00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:39,450\nLet's see, I think I am lab.itpro.tv.\n\n48\n00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,250\nLet me just pull that up.\n\n49\n00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,280\nI'm sure there's twenty easier ways to\ndo this than the way that I'm doing it.\n\n50\n00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,420\nBut, where's my fully\nqualified domain name?\n\n51\n00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:47,961\nI thought it was in here.\n\n52\n00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:48,762\n>> I'm looking.\n\n53\n00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:51,220\nI don't see her yet.\n\n54\n00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,480\n>> Well, shoot.\n>> IP config all, just do a little.\n\n55\n00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,190\n>> Oh yeah it is in there, isn't it?\n\n56\n00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,130\nAs I go into the wrong window here.\n\n57\n00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,410\nWe do need our fully qualified\ndomain name, though, or\n\n58\n00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,430\nit's not gonna work out too well for us.\n\n59\n00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,490\nPretty sure it's lab.itpro.tv.\n\n60\n00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,912\nIf you get it wrong, it's not going to\nwork, so we do need to get it right.\n\n61\n00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:07,737\nOh, just itprotv.net.\n\n62\n00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:08,632\nSee, I'm glad I checked.\n\n63\n00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:09,759\nThere we go.\n\n64\n00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,325\nSo, I'm gonna say -dnsname\nserver01.itprotv.net, so\n\n65\n00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:16,820\nthat's my DHCP server.\n\n66\n00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,470\nAnd I'm gonna give it its IP address,\nalso.\n\n67\n00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,403\nAnd the IP address for this server,\nI guess I need to know that also.\n\n68\n00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:30,688\nAnd I should be able to find out right\nhere in the same screen, 192.168.29.3.\n\n69\n00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,241\nSo I'll punch that in, and\n\n70\n00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:36,099\nI'll probably need an extra little\nspace in there to make it happy.\n\n71\n00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,608\nAll right, now when I specify this,\nI'm just gonna be adding this server\n\n72\n00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:44,550\nto the list, the DNS name and\nIP address to the authorized side.\n\n73\n00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,620\nNow I need to be a domain administrator\nfor this to work, and I am,\n\n74\n00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,190\nand I launch my PowerShell with\nadministrative privileges.\n\n75\n00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,060\nIf I'm not a domain admin,\nI can't run that command.\n\n76\n00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,290\nI can't authorize a DHCP server,\nso that's important.\n\n77\n00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,890\n>> So now we should be able to go get\nthat list again, and see if we show up.\n\n78\n00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,490\n>> Yeah, so\n\n79\n00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,690\nif I run that get-windowsFeature dhcp,\noops, sorry, not that one.\n\n80\n00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,140\nWe already knew it was installed.\n\n81\n00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:14,670\nI want to run the get-dhcpServerInDC,\nwhich I thought was in my history.\n\n82\n00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,742\nThere it is.\nAnd now it runs, and\n\n83\n00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:18,677\ninstead of getting an empty return,\nI actually get an entry.\n\n84\n00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:22,670\nI see 192.168.29.3 is right there.\n\n85\n00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,422\nIt's authorized and\nit's mapped to server 01.itprotv.net.\n\n86\n00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:29,020\nAll right, we're authorized.\n\n87\n00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,090\nNow, we're ready to start\nusing that DHCP server.\n\n88\n00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,000\nIf we don't do this,\nwe will not issue out IP addresses, and\n\n89\n00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,910\nit's super easy to overlook that from\nthe PowerShell, so real important.\n\n90\n00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,730\nAll right.\n\n91\n00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,860\nIf we ever want to deauthorize a server,\nlike we're decommissioning it,\n\n92\n00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,450\ngetting it out of there,\nthe command is really the same.\n\n93\n00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:54,790\nExcept instead of Add-DhcpServerInDC,\nyou would just say remove.\n\n94\n00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,628\nAnd if we say remove that same command,\nit'll take it out and\n\n95\n00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,260\ndeauthorize that server.\n\n96\n00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,710\nAnd the server doesn't have to be\nonline to deauthorize it, so if you've\n\n97\n00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,780\nalready gotten rid of that DHCP server,\nand it's still just kind of sitting around\n\n98\n00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,360\nauthorized even though it no longer\nexists, you can go to another server or\n\n99\n00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,042\nyour work station and run this and\nthat would deauthorize it.\n\n100\n00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:17,310\nAll right, well,\nin this segment we got a chance to see\n\n101\n00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,340\nauthorizing that DHCP server\nto get it functional.\n\n102\n00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,710\nNow, it's up and running.\n\n103\n00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,350\nSo if you've been following all of our\nsegments in order, we've installed DHCP.\n\n104\n00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,740\nWe've authorized it.\n\n105\n00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,860\nThe next steps for\nus are gonna be creating our scopes and\n\n106\n00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,805\ngetting this thing actually\ndoing something useful.\n\n107\n00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:33,710\n>> Right.\n>> So that's what's coming up next.\n\n108\n00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,419\nBe sure to stay tuned.\n\n109\n00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,088\nWe've got more PowerShell coming up next.\n\n110\n00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:42,373\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,969\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:09,148\nIn this segment,\n\n3\n00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:13,390\nwe're gonna take a look at managing\nscopes inside of the DHCP server.\n\n4\n00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,366\nOnce you get a DHCP server up and running,\n\n5\n00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:18,418\nit's not particularly useful\nuntil we actually put some scopes\n\n6\n00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,317\nin there to tell it what addresses\nit's allowed to hand out.\n\n7\n00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:24,250\nThat's a pretty important step and\nyou don't just provide a,\n\n8\n00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,850\nwell I guess you could just\nprovide a range of IP's, but\n\n9\n00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,307\nthere's normally other things we\nprovide along with it to customize it.\n\n10\n00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:31,540\n>> Absolutely.\n\n11\n00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,440\nOnce we've authorized it It's allowed to\npass out IP addresses on the network now,\n\n12\n00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,570\nbut if it doesn't have a pool\nof addresses to pass out,\n\n13\n00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,050\nit's not gonna be able to do it.\n\n14\n00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,940\nAnd then our scope has a whole bunch\nof properties that we can associate\n\n15\n00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,470\nwith it that we'll go\nthrough here with PowerShell.\n\n16\n00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,480\n>> All right, so let's just start\nout with getting a scope created.\n\n17\n00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,410\nIt's pretty easy, we've got a command\nwhich is the Add-DhcpServerScope.\n\n18\n00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,860\nNow there is a little bit more to it\nnow because we have IPv4 scopes and\n\n19\n00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,060\nIPv6 scopes.\n\n20\n00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,584\nSo the command is not actually\nAdd-DhcpServerScope, or\n\n21\n00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:07,646\nit's Add-DchpServerv4Scope,\nor v6 scope, so\n\n22\n00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:13,060\nthat it knows which address\nfamily we're operating in, right?\n\n23\n00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,350\nIn the older versions of Windows,\nyou didn't really have that problem, but\n\n24\n00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,740\nthere are gonna be moments where we\nhave IPv6 and we've gotta remember that.\n\n25\n00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,660\n>> Exactly.\nAlmost all of the commands can be\n\n26\n00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,390\nused for either one.\n\n27\n00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,690\nYou've just gotta specify, and the noun\npart of the command would be v4 or v6.\n\n28\n00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,270\n>> All right.\n\n29\n00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,480\nSo let's go ahead and get one created.\n\n30\n00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,340\nLet's say I wanna create a DCHP scope for\nthe studio here, right.\n\n31\n00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,305\nSo for our machines.\n\n32\n00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:33,480\nWe'll see what I can break.\n\n33\n00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,917\n>> All right. [LAUGH] >> So\nI'm gonna do Add-DhcpServer,\n\n34\n00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:41,570\nif I spell it right,\nmy tab ough to complete a word.\n\n35\n00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,709\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nsay Add-DhcpServerv4, and\n\n36\n00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:49,370\n[LAUGH] tab auto complete\nsometimes does not pay off.\n\n37\n00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,420\nThere it is.\n\n38\n00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,850\nDhcpServerv4Scope.\n\n39\n00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,700\nIf I want to IPv6 it\nwould just be a v6 scope,\n\n40\n00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,990\notherwise the commands\nare basically identical.\n\n41\n00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,550\nAnd then I need to give it some\ninformation about the scope I'm creating,\n\n42\n00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,800\nand a minimum you'll\nwant to give it a name.\n\n43\n00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,040\nAnd I'll call this one the ITProTV Studio.\n\n44\n00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,670\n>> The name doesn't really do\nanything functionally, but\n\n45\n00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,930\nwhen you're working with that DHCP server,\nand you've got a bunch of different scope\n\n46\n00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,950\nfor your client subnet,\nfor your server backbone,\n\n47\n00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,670\nthings like that, the name helps you\nknow which one you're working with.\n\n48\n00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,210\n>> And then the three required\noptions are the beginning IP,\n\n49\n00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,310\nthe ending IP, and the sub net mask.\n\n50\n00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,420\nAnd so those are the three other\nthings we need to provide.\n\n51\n00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,890\nThat's the bare minimum\nto get a scope created.\n\n52\n00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,800\nBeginning, end ,and subnet mask.\n\n53\n00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,663\nSo I'll just come in here and\nI'll say StartRange.\n\n54\n00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:42,363\nAnd I'm gonna start this\none at 192.168.29.100.\n\n55\n00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:45,604\nAnd then I can say EndRange,\n\n56\n00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:51,555\nwhich is gonna be 192.168.29.150.\n\n57\n00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:54,527\nOr maybe I'll do 149 so\nit's a nice even 50 addresses.\n\n58\n00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:55,756\n>> I like it.\n\n59\n00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:59,597\n>> So I'll go and\nspecify as a start and the end, and\n\n60\n00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:05,877\nthen I need my subnet mask at the very\nend, so I'll just add that -SubnetMask,\n\n61\n00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:09,853\nand this one we'll just\ndo as a slash 24 class C.\n\n62\n00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:12,504\n255.255.255.0.\n\n63\n00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:17,058\nSo once I've got that punched in, it's\nthe name of the scope, the beginning IP,\n\n64\n00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:19,785\nthe ending IP, and the subnet mask.\n\n65\n00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:25,525\nNow, a lot of this can be changed after\nthe fact using Set-DhcpServerScope.\n\n66\n00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:28,447\nYou can change things like\nthe beginning and ending IP address.\n\n67\n00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:32,707\nBut that subnet mask is one of those few\nthings in here that you can't change.\n\n68\n00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:36,117\nSo make sure you get that set right,\notherwise you gotta remove the scope and\n\n69\n00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:37,467\nrecreate it, and that can be a pain.\n\n70\n00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:43,050\nAll right so, now I've got a scope,\nor at least I think I do.\n\n71\n00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,229\nRight?\nI guess we could verify that with\n\n72\n00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,783\na quick get-DhcpServerv4Scope.\n\n73\n00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,340\nI don't even know why I bother\nwith that one completely [LAUGH]\n\n74\n00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,460\n>> Some of them it works really well,\n\n75\n00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,400\nsome of them you gotta type so\n\n76\n00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,375\nmany letters that you might as\nwell just finish typing it out.\n\n77\n00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,250\n[LAUGH]\n>> I could have typed five characters, or\n\n78\n00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,865\nI could hit Tab 12 times.\n\n79\n00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:05,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyhow,\n\n80\n00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,110\nyou can see right here that Scope\nthat we made, ITProTV Studio.\n\n81\n00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,550\nIt is active by default,\nso be aware of that.\n\n82\n00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,940\nI'm serving up addresses right now.\n\n83\n00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,980\nIt's got a StartRange of 192.168.29.100,\nall the way to 149.\n\n84\n00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,861\nThe LeaseDuration is at the default.\n\n85\n00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:23,031\nThere were a lot of other options I\ncould have provided on that line, but\n\n86\n00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:26,450\nthe minimum was the start,\nthe end, and the subnet mask.\n\n87\n00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,530\nAnd so, it's got all of that,\nand it's ready to rock.\n\n88\n00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,428\nI've got my scope.\n>> And that's something to keep in mind,\n\n89\n00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,050\nis that is different\nfrom the GUI interface.\n\n90\n00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,160\nWhen you create that scope through\nthe GUI, there's a check mark that you can\n\n91\n00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,900\nchoose, but by default, it's not gonna\nbe the scope, it's not gonna be active.\n\n92\n00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,830\nSo, you set that scope up, and then it\ngives you a chance to go back in and\n\n93\n00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,730\nset some of the additional parameters, and\n\n94\n00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,860\nthen you can activate\nit when you're ready.\n\n95\n00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,600\nWith PowerShell, it's gonna be active\nas soon as you run that command.\n\n96\n00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,970\n>> Yeah, so\nlet's say I created a second one here.\n\n97\n00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,582\nSo I'll just go in, and\nI'm gonna create a ITProTV Studio 2.\n\n98\n00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:57,130\nThat's in a different network, right.\n\n99\n00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,000\nSo now I've got two of these scopes.\n\n100\n00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,630\nAnd I can see them both created here,\nand their ranges.\n\n101\n00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:09,190\nIf I wanna get rid of a scope, it's\njust gonna be Remove-dhcpServerv4Scope,\n\n102\n00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,920\nand then all you have\nto provide is the name.\n\n103\n00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,080\nYou don't have to provide all the other\ninformation that we did before.\n\n104\n00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,440\nYou can just say, I'm sorry,\nnot the name, the scope ID.\n\n105\n00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,400\nThere we go, ScopeID.\n\n106\n00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,970\nAnd the scope ID, notice how the scope\nID is not actually the name,\n\n107\n00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,500\nit's the subnet or\nthe network that this is attached to.\n\n108\n00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,100\nSo if I wanna get rid\nof this 192.168.28.0,\n\n109\n00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:37,050\nthat's what I have to punch in, and\nwe can punch that in right there.\n\n110\n00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,190\nWe don't have to provide all the other\ndetails, start range, end range,\n\n111\n00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,960\nsubnet mask.\n\n112\n00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,500\nWe just specify that scope ID And\nthat’ll remove it, and now it’s gone.\n\n113\n00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,570\nAll right, so\npretty straightforward there, but\n\n114\n00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,470\nwe don’t normally stop right here,\nthis scope is gonna be pretty boring.\n\n115\n00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,430\nIf machines boot up on our network,\nthey’ll get an IP address and that’s it.\n\n116\n00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,450\n>> And that’s about it, right?\n\n117\n00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,090\nAnd that’s where the power\nof DHCP comes into play.\n\n118\n00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,440\nWe can pass out all the other TCP IP\nconfigurations and more stuff.\n\n119\n00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,870\nAnd then more, your DNS server address,\nyour default gateway.\n\n120\n00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,130\nAll this stuff we're going to need\nto really function on a network.\n\n121\n00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,870\n>> Yep.\n\n122\n00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,840\nIn the show notes for this episode,\n\n123\n00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,470\nI'm gonna include a link to\nthis Microsoft TechNet article.\n\n124\n00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,910\nAnd in this TechNet article, they\nhighlight all the different options that\n\n125\n00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,580\nwe can provide to a scope, so that we can\ngive our clients a configuration to use\n\n126\n00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,470\nwhen they boot up and get a DHCP address,\nbut there's a lot of them.\n\n127\n00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,670\nAnd there's a lot that a lot of\npeople aren't really going to use.\n\n128\n00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,990\nSo I'll include the link to that article,\nbut\n\n129\n00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,230\nwhat I want to show you here in\nthe video are the most common ones.\n\n130\n00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,910\nThings like who your DNS\nservers are going to be, and\n\n131\n00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,370\nwho your default gateway is going to be.\n\n132\n00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,760\nThose are the two things that\nwe really need to get good,\n\n133\n00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,800\nclean functionality on our DHCP server.\n\n134\n00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:51,940\nWell, since I've already created my scope,\nI just need to go in and\n\n135\n00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,770\nmodify the options on it.\n\n136\n00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,920\nAnd to that, we’re gonna say Set,\nand actually let me move this,\n\n137\n00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,230\ncuz this is gonna be a long command, and\nI don't want my head to cover it up.\n\n138\n00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,708\n>> Just the command looks long enough.\n\n139\n00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,268\n[LAUGH]\n>> So all right, here,\n\n140\n00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:07,260\nwe'll start from the top.\n\n141\n00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,490\nSo, we're gonna come in here and we're\nbasically gonna set this option, right?\n\n142\n00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,935\nSo I'll just say\nSet-DHCPServerv4OptionValue.\n\n143\n00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,880\nThat's the main commandlet right there.\n\n144\n00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,630\nSet-DHCPServerv4OptionValue, we\ncan go in here, and\n\n145\n00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,120\nwe can set all of our various options.\n\n146\n00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,202\nAnd you can even start to\ncreate some new options with\n\n147\n00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:34,000\nthe Add-DhcpServerv4OptionValue.\n\n148\n00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,513\nCuz you might have custom\noptions that you need to make.\n\n149\n00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:42,070\nBut for the most part, we can use\nthe built-in ones and they're just fine.\n\n150\n00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,200\nAll right, so I'm gonna be modifying my\nscope ID that we just made a moment ago,\n\n151\n00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,450\nwhich for me is 192.168.29.0.\n\n152\n00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,710\nAnd now I provide the various\noptions that I want it to have.\n\n153\n00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,538\nI mention DNS server, right.\n\n154\n00:07:53,538 --> 00:08:03,010\nSo I'll say -DnsServer and maybe my DNS\nserver here is going to be 192.168.29.3.\n\n155\n00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,150\nSo that's the DNS server that\nI'm gonna give to people.\n\n156\n00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,392\nIf I had more than one I\nwould just do a comma and\n\n157\n00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:09,463\nlist the other ones that were available.\n\n158\n00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:11,647\nYou can do more than one DNS server.\n\n159\n00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,200\nAll right.\n\n160\n00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,610\nI might choose to do a DNS suffix also,\nand\n\n161\n00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,730\nthat's -DnsDomain, and\nthen we specify what domain they're in.\n\n162\n00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,700\nI'm in ITProTV.net,\nI believe is what I'm in.\n\n163\n00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,290\nAll right.\n\n164\n00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,895\nAnd then,\nthat default gateway which is -Router and\n\n165\n00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:37,279\nthen the ip address of your router\nwhich on my network is 192.168.29.2.\n\n166\n00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,720\nSo, right here I see the main\noptions that we're gonna set.\n\n167\n00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,500\nThe default gateway, the DNS server, and\nI went ahead and did the DNS suffix also.\n\n168\n00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,300\nBut there's plenty more options that\nare out there that you can set,\n\n169\n00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:55,050\nmaybe win servers and other things,\nhopefully not, but I'll run that.\n\n170\n00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,750\nThere was a little message that popped\nup there, just a little status setting.\n\n171\n00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,900\nIt goes by real fast, and then we get\nour prompt, my options are set, right?\n\n172\n00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,920\nSo now when my clients go to connect, they\ndon't just get an IP address and a subnet\n\n173\n00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,700\nmask, they also get the other supporting\ninformation that they need, right?\n\n174\n00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,110\nIf I want to verify that,\nI can jump back to my GUI,\n\n175\n00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,090\nit's probably the easiest way to see it.\n\n176\n00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,775\nAnd I don't see any scopes here, but\nif I refresh this screen, I should.\n\n177\n00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:21,850\nThere's my scope, 192.169 29.0.\n\n178\n00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,240\nIt's called ItProTV studio.\n\n179\n00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,320\nAnd if I go down to Scope Options,\nthere's the router, DNS servers,\n\n180\n00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,650\nand domain name, all set just\nlike we did from the PowerShell.\n\n181\n00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:38,750\nNow, because I created this scope from\nthe PowerShell, It was active by default.\n\n182\n00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,850\nBut there may be times when\nwe're troubleshooting or\n\n183\n00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,050\ndealing with other issues that we might\nwant to disable a scope temporarily, or\n\n184\n00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,780\nmaybe we created it disabled,\nand now we're ready to enable it.\n\n185\n00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,170\nWell, that's another thing that\nwe can do from the PowerShell,\n\n186\n00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,170\nis you can turn these scopes on and\noff as you need it.\n\n187\n00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,713\nAnd it's really not a hard command.\n\n188\n00:09:55,713 --> 00:10:01,290\nIt's Set-DHCPServerv4Scope -ScopeID,\n\n189\n00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:07,440\nwe have to tell it which\nscope we're working with.\n\n190\n00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,640\nAnd then, we can say -State, and for\n\n191\n00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,850\nthe state there's really just two\nvalues which is active and inactive.\n\n192\n00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,320\nSo if I say inactive,\nthat's gonna disable the scope.\n\n193\n00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,650\nThe scope still exists, but we're no\nlonger handing out addresses for it.\n\n194\n00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,280\nAnd back here in DHTP,\n\n195\n00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,870\nif I refresh this screen,\nwhat I should see is that scope there.\n\n196\n00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,260\nIt's got a little red circle on it.\n\n197\n00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,720\nIt's been deactivated.\n\n198\n00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,410\nIt's inactive.\n\n199\n00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,330\nAll right.\n\n200\n00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,970\nAnd if I go back to my PowerShell and\nrun that same command but change this\n\n201\n00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,900\nto Active, now when I run that it's active\nand it's handing out addresses again.\n\n202\n00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,560\nI can come back here and\nrefresh this screen.\n\n203\n00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:54,895\nAnd I can see that it is now active.\n\n204\n00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:58,075\nSo, pretty easy to turn those on and\noff as needed.\n\n205\n00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,505\nAnd we can use Get-DhcpServerv4Scope\nto find out whether or\n\n206\n00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:03,335\nnot they're active or inactive.\n\n207\n00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:10,320\nSo, if I inactivate it again,\nand run the scope command.\n\n208\n00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,860\nAnd I'm just going to leave off the ID so\nit'll display everything.\n\n209\n00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,620\nYou can see in here,\nI've got that state of Inactive.\n\n210\n00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,611\nSo pretty easy to verify that\nfrom the PowerShell too.\n\n211\n00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:20,885\nI like the GUI.\n\n212\n00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:22,371\nSomething like this, inactivating and\n\n213\n00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:24,780\nactivating a scope is not something\nI'm going to do all the time.\n\n214\n00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,560\nSo I'll usually use the GUI for it.\n\n215\n00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,337\n>> [CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE],\nor something like that?\n\n216\n00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:32,769\n>> Yeah, maybe you've got some kind of\nscripted response, like a threat response\n\n217\n00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,595\nor something that you want to\ninactivate that scope really quick so\n\n218\n00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,030\nyou're not hitting on addresses.\n\n219\n00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,240\nOr maybe you only want to hand out DHCP\naddresses during certain times of the day.\n\n220\n00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,070\nYou could automate it\nwith something like this.\n\n221\n00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,820\nAll right well, All in all, working\nwith the scopes, not that big of a deal.\n\n222\n00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,270\nRight.\nThe trick is just remembering what\n\n223\n00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,620\noptions you want to set.\n\n224\n00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,050\nWe really just saw three different\ncommands in there, right.\n\n225\n00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,530\nIf I do a get-history,\nwe'll kind of see the ones that I did.\n\n226\n00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,270\nThere was the Add-DHCPServerv4Scope,\n\n227\n00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,990\nthere was the set DHCP\nserver option value.\n\n228\n00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,750\nI guess really just that and the GET.\n\n229\n00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,180\nGet-DhcpServerv4Scope.\n\n230\n00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,230\nSo really just a handful\nof commands there and\n\n231\n00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,770\njust different options that we're\nusing with it to achieve our goals.\n\n232\n00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:21,280\nAll right, well in this segment we got\na chance to see how to create those DHCP\n\n233\n00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,040\nscopes, how to modify the scopes,\nand how to set options on them and\n\n234\n00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,920\nat the very end there we took a look at\nactivating and inactivating those scopes.\n\n235\n00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,650\nSo, pretty good stuff.\n\n236\n00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,080\nAt this point, we typically consider our\nDHCP server functional and ready to run.\n\n237\n00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:40,060\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n238\n00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,660\nStay tuned because we do have a little\nbit more of Dhcop coming up, but\n\n239\n00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,210\notherwise we have other PowerShell\nepisodes coming up too.\n\n240\n00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,420\nSo stay tuned.\n\n241\n00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,903\nThere'll be more after this.\n\n242\n00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:55,129\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,397\n[SOUND] In this segment we're gonna take\n\n2\n00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:13,711\na look at creating exclusions\ninside of a DHCP server scope.\n\n3\n00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:17,547\nWhen we create a scope, they let us\npick the beginning IP of a range and\n\n4\n00:00:17,547 --> 00:00:18,950\nthe ending IP of a range.\n\n5\n00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,800\nAnd sometimes that works out great for us,\nwe have a whole block of IPs we wanna use.\n\n6\n00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,110\nThere are times where there's particular\nIPs that we need to leave out right.\n\n7\n00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,600\nAnd I'm not talking about a reservation,\n\n8\n00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,770\nwhere I wanna map it to\none host all the time.\n\n9\n00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,430\nI mean I wanna leave it out all together.\n\n10\n00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,710\nI don't want DHCP to touch it.\n\n11\n00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,730\n>> Somebody statically mapped a print\nserver a long time ago before you set that\n\n12\n00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,470\nscope up, and now that address you can't\nchange or you don't wanna change it.\n\n13\n00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,018\nBut again, so\n\n14\n00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:44,780\nI gotta make sure that my DHCP server\ndoesn't pass out that IP address.\n\n15\n00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,910\n>> So let's take a look at that process,\nit is pretty straightforward.\n\n16\n00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,950\nI've got a scope that I've created\nin a previous segment, and so\n\n17\n00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,160\nI'm gonna just pull that scope up real\nquick, it's the 192.168.29.0 scope.\n\n18\n00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,899\nAnd it runs from .100 all the way to .49.\n\n19\n00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,414\nI've got 50 IPs.\n\n20\n00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:08,202\nWell let's say that .107\n\n21\n00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,780\nwas already in use by a machine on\nthe network that's statically assigned.\n\n22\n00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,170\nSo not using DHCP,\nit's just statically assigned.\n\n23\n00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,680\nI wanna tell DHCP to leave that alone.\n\n24\n00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,230\nNot to mess with .7, and to do that,\nI can create an exclusion to map it out.\n\n25\n00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,930\nNow, when you create an exclusion,\nyou can exclude a single IP, or\n\n26\n00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,800\nyou can exclude a range of IPs.\n\n27\n00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,790\nIt's up to you how you want to do it.\n\n28\n00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,770\nBut, I'm gonna exclude just\na single one to start one.\n\n29\n00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,620\nI'll do a range afterwards.\n\n30\n00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,340\nI'm gonna knock out .7.\n\n31\n00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,205\n>> 107.\n\n32\n00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:37,682\n>> 107, sorry.\n\n33\n00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:42,093\nSo, I'm gonna come in here and just say,\n\n34\n00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:46,393\nAdd-DhcpServerv4ExclusionRange.\n\n35\n00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:50,180\nAnd, even though I'm excluding just one\nIP, you still say it's an exclusion range.\n\n36\n00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,810\nIt's just gonna start and\nstop at the exact same IP.\n\n37\n00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,030\nThen I tell it what\nscope I'm working with.\n\n38\n00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,473\nSo I'll say -ScopeID 192.168.29.0,\nis my ScopeID.\n\n39\n00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:03,920\nAnd now, I need to tell it the exclusion.\n\n40\n00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,390\nAnd very similar to creating\nan actual scope, we say start range,\n\n41\n00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,680\nand an end range.\n\n42\n00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,830\nSo if we say -StartRange, in my case it's\n\n43\n00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,970\ngoing to be 192.168.29.107, and\nmy EndRange is gonna be the same IP.\n\n44\n00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,500\nIf I just wanna include one IP,\nI just list it as the start and the end.\n\n45\n00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,930\nIt's both for that particular exclusion.\n\n46\n00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,540\nAnd so when I run that,\nit should be happy.\n\n47\n00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,080\nHow do I know it worked?\n\n48\n00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,490\nWell I can query these.\n\n49\n00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:40,149\nI can do a Get-DhcpServerv4ExclusionRange.\n\n50\n00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:42,130\nAnd now, I can see I've got\na range from 107 to 107, right?\n\n51\n00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,540\nThat one's excluded out.\n\n52\n00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,170\nIf I wanted to do a block of IPs well,\n\n53\n00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,150\nyou just put different IPs in\nthe beginning and in the end.\n\n54\n00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,520\nBe careful though, it does get unhappy\nif you do things like overlapping.\n\n55\n00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,324\nSo, if I wanted to exclude 105 to 110.\n\n56\n00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,408\nRight, if I go in here and modify that\nprevious command like that, they overlap.\n\n57\n00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:06,751\nSo I'd actually need to remove\nthe exclusion for 107, and\n\n58\n00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,950\nthen add the block for 105 to 110.\n\n59\n00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,550\nIf they don't overlap,\nit's no big deal though.\n\n60\n00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,764\nSo like if I wanted to\nexclude 110 through 115.\n\n61\n00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,935\nI can just come in here and\nmodify this, and now when I do my\n\n62\n00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:27,380\nGet-DhcpServerv4ExclusionRange, I'll\nsee the two ranges.\n\n63\n00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,104\nThe first one is just a single IP,\nthe second one is that range, 110 to 115.\n\n64\n00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:36,989\nNow, this is different than a reservation,\nbecause what this does is,\n\n65\n00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,620\nit tells DHCP to pretend like\nthese IPs don't even exist.\n\n66\n00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,664\nDon't hand them out.\n\n67\n00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:44,000\nIf somebody asked for\nan IP, don't issue this.\n\n68\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,770\nDon't even pretend these are around.\n\n69\n00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,320\nJust ignore it.\n\n70\n00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,670\nReservations are a lot different.\n\n71\n00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,010\nWe put specialized requirements on those.\n\n72\n00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,870\nBut here, you just ignore it.\n\n73\n00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,340\nAll right, once they're in place,\n\n74\n00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,830\nyou can get rid of them by doing\nthe Remove-DhcpServerv4ExclusionRange.\n\n75\n00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,960\nSyntax is the same for the rest of it, you\ncan remove them and get them out of there.\n\n76\n00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,890\nOr put them right back again.\n\n77\n00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,640\nNotice how each of these do have\ntheir own kind of scope ID.\n\n78\n00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,740\nIt's just mapping it to the scope\nID of the actual scope,\n\n79\n00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,540\nthis isn't tied to each individual\nrange like each on its own.\n\n80\n00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,700\nBut you might have exclusion ranges for\nseveral different scopes.\n\n81\n00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,570\nI could have filtered this down and\n\n82\n00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,910\nspecified the scope ID that I\nwanted to see exclusion ranges for.\n\n83\n00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,930\nThat's useful if you\nhave more than one scope.\n\n84\n00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,090\nI don't, I've only got the one scope,\nso I don't need the filter.\n\n85\n00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:30,680\nAll right, but that's basically it,\n\n86\n00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,160\nthis is one of the simpler\ntopics that we've got.\n\n87\n00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,974\nAdding an exclusion range,\nviewing the exclusion ranges,\n\n88\n00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:37,528\nit's all done with one command.\n\n89\n00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:46,119\nWell, the set, get, and remove variations\nof the DhcpServerv4ExclusionRange command.\n\n90\n00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,886\nThat's a long one.\n[LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,482\n>> All right,\n\n92\n00:04:47,482 --> 00:04:50,226\nwell in this segment,\nwe got a chance to see creating,\n\n93\n00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:54,356\nmodifying and removing those exclusions,\npretty straightforward on this one.\n\n94\n00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:55,517\nHope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n95\n00:04:55,517 --> 00:05:00,450\nStay tuned, we've got more DHCP and\nmore power shell coming up.\n\n96\n00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:06,590\n[SOUND]\n\n",

DHCP\nreservations from the Windows PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,940\nCreating reservation in DHCP\nis really handy, right?\n\n5\n00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,730\nWe wanna a machine to boot up and always\nget the same IP address from our pool.\n\n6\n00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,210\nOr maybe we want it to\nget custom options or\n\n7\n00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,095\nsettings from the other machines that\nare getting IP's from our server.\n\n8\n00:00:25,095 --> 00:00:27,610\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Reservations let us do that, right?\n\n9\n00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,301\nBut we gotta get them\ncreated before they function.\n\n10\n00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:30,580\n>> Right\n>> And that's what we're gonna\n\n11\n00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,129\nsee right here.\n\n12\n00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,730\nNow creating reservation, it's almost\nidentical to creating an exclusion.\n\n13\n00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,380\nThe difference is, instead of\nproviding a start and an end IP,\n\n14\n00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:44,540\nwe're providing a specific IP and\na Mac address that's gonna be tied to it.\n\n15\n00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,630\nSo a little bit of a variation,\nbut the syntax is pretty familiar.\n\n16\n00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,110\nSo let's take a look at that\nright here on my machine.\n\n17\n00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,870\nLet's say that I wanna make sure my laptop\nalways gets the same IP address from our\n\n18\n00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,716\nDHCP server.\n\n19\n00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:57,610\nAll right.\n\n20\n00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,350\nI always wanna get an IP that ends in 123.\n\n21\n00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,625\nSo I want to create\na reservation that will do that.\n\n22\n00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,570\n>> Mm-hm\n>> All right?\n\n23\n00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,265\nSo I'm gonna come in and\nsay Add-DhcpServerv4Reservation.\n\n24\n00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:17,560\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna be adding that reservation in.\n\n25\n00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,620\nI need to tell it what scope this\nreservation is a part of, and\n\n26\n00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,255\nmy scope that I'm working\nwith is 192.168.29.0.\n\n27\n00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:28,950\nThen I need to tell it the IP address\nthat I want this machine to have.\n\n28\n00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,961\nAnd so I'll come in and\njust say -IPAddress.\n\n29\n00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:35,124\nAnd I'm gonna give myself 192.168.29.123.\n\n30\n00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:37,590\nRight.\nThat's the IP address I always want\n\n31\n00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,129\nto have.\n\n32\n00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:39,966\nNow here's the important part.\n\n33\n00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,647\nWell, I guess let me add\na little bit more to that.\n\n34\n00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:45,741\nThe IP address you pick has\nto be inside of the scope, so\n\n35\n00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:48,788\nyou know your scope does have a start and\nan end range.\n\n36\n00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:50,771\nIt's gotta be inside of there.\n\n37\n00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:53,150\nAnd it cannot be an exclusion range.\n\n38\n00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,320\nI know some people will try and exclude an\nIP and then create a reservation for it.\n\n39\n00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,010\nThat doesn't work, right?\n\n40\n00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,960\n>> When you exclude it,\n\n41\n00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,600\nyou're telling the DHCP server you\ncannot pass out this IP address.\n\n42\n00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,570\nYou can't use that in a reservation.\n\n43\n00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,160\n>> Or if you try and\n\n44\n00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,850\ncreate a reservation for\na scope that's outside of the scope IP.\n\n45\n00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,310\nSo like my scope goes from\n.100 all the way to .49.\n\n46\n00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,470\nIf I tried to create a reservation for\n150, it's outside the scope and\n\n47\n00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,040\nwon't let you do it.\n\n48\n00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,922\nSo it's gotta be a valid IP\ninside of the current scope.\n\n49\n00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:23,290\nAll right.\n\n50\n00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,510\nSo, the next part is the most\nimportant part, which is.\n\n51\n00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,110\nThe MAC address of the machine, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,830\nSo I need to come in and\njust tell it -ClientID, and\n\n53\n00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,830\nthen the MAC address, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,540\nThe MAC address is a 48-bit hexadecimal\nnumber, and when I write, or letters and\n\n55\n00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,820\nnumbers, I guess, whatever.\n\n56\n00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,440\nWhen we write it,\nit does need to be in a particular format.\n\n57\n00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,890\nIt needs to be two characters and a dash,\ntwo characters and a dash, and so on.\n\n58\n00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,190\nSo, if I'm gonna create one for my Laptop,\nI'll just punch in my MAC address here, so\n\n59\n00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,360\nI'm just gonna get that punched in.\n\n60\n00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,460\nAnd I've got it written down on a piece of\npaper here, so I don't have to look it up.\n\n61\n00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,410\n>> That is kind of a negative in the GUI,\n\n62\n00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,000\nyou don't have to put those dashes in,\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,730\nWhen you go through wizard,\nyou can just type in your 12 digits there,\n\n64\n00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,442\nand it'll assume the dashes.\n\n65\n00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,130\nIn PowerShell, you do have to\nput those in, unfortunately.\n\n66\n00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,110\n>> And then we need to give it a name.\n\n67\n00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,310\nAnd I'll just call this one donlaptop so\nI can remember what it is, all right.\n\n68\n00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,070\nAnd that's gonna create that reservation\nso that now whenever my laptop gets an IP\n\n69\n00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:26,390\naddress from the server, it will\nalways get 192.168.29.123, all right.\n\n70\n00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:33,707\nAnd if I run a get-dhcpserverv4reservation\nwhich apparently I spelled wrong, again.\n\n71\n00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:40,570\nApparently I'm going to set record for the\namount of times that I can spell it wrong.\n\n72\n00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,810\nThen you'll see it's prompting me for\nmy scope ID, I didn't provide that.\n\n73\n00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:52,330\nSo if I, oops, there we go,\nif I provide my scope ID of 192.168.29.0.\n\n74\n00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,540\nSo I'm running get-Dhcpserverv4reservation\n-scope ID and providing the scope.\n\n75\n00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,230\nNow, I can see each of\nthe reservations that are out there.\n\n76\n00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,495\nSo I can see that .123 is mapped to this\nMAC address, and it's named donlaptop.\n\n77\n00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,810\nNow, at this point,\n\n78\n00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,830\nI can go even further if I wanted\nusing the set.Dhcpv4reservation.\n\n79\n00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,660\nAnd specify other values.\n\n80\n00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,370\nYou can even do custom options and\n\n81\n00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,070\nreally advanced things that are tailored\njust to this particular reservation.\n\n82\n00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,820\nBut that's not as common as like, if we\nwanna override something on a particular\n\n83\n00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,820\nbasis, we normally go to that\nparticular system and modify it there.\n\n84\n00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,440\nSo right here is pretty much the extent\nof what most people are gonna\n\n85\n00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,075\ndo for reservations.\n\n86\n00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:35,190\n>> Mm-hm\n>> You might need to remove one,\n\n87\n00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,912\nI guess, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n88\n00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:39,180\nBut otherwise, that's really about it.\n\n89\n00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,870\nI'm trying to think of anything\nelse to throw in on this one Mike.\n\n90\n00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,770\n>> All right, I can’t think of anything,\nI mean, you can do the reservation or\n\n91\n00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,790\nyou can see the type\ncolumn there says both,\n\n92\n00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,250\nthey’re referring to the DHCP and\nBootP, that’s one thing.\n\n93\n00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,200\n>> Yeah, defaults to both.\n\n94\n00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,300\nMost people just leave it at that.\n\n95\n00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,540\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n96\n00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,660\nAnd they are very handy,\nand a lot of people wonder,\n\n97\n00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,470\nwhy not just go statically map the IP\naddress if you’re gonna set a reservation?\n\n98\n00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,320\nIt's really because DHCP is so\npowerful, right.\n\n99\n00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,890\nIt has all those other options.\n\n100\n00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,970\nHere, we're making sure it gets\nthe same IP address every time.\n\n101\n00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,850\nBut what if the DNS server changes?\n\n102\n00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,770\nOr their default gateway changes?\n\n103\n00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,630\nIf I statically map that information,\n\n104\n00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,080\nnow I've gotta go manually\nupdate that information.\n\n105\n00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,430\nHere, if I change that,\nif that information changes,\n\n106\n00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,300\nI update my scope properties.\n\n107\n00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,590\nAnd that client will get that new\ninformation still getting the same IP\n\n108\n00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,740\naddress every time.\n\n109\n00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,443\nAnd it can be handy like making sure I\nknow what the IP address of that kiosk\n\n110\n00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:30,360\nmachine is.\n\n111\n00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,550\nSo if I ever have troubles I can\nalways get in to it by IP address.\n\n112\n00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,800\n>> It's all cool stuff.\n\n113\n00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:38,620\nAll right,\nwell that pretty much wraps this one up.\n\n114\n00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,260\nSo in this segment we got a chance to see\nhow to create that reservation map and\n\n115\n00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,180\nget it in place,\ntake a look to hold them back up,\n\n116\n00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,920\nreturn what reservations we made,\nand how to remove them.\n\n117\n00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,587\nAll pretty straightforward\nusing the get set or\n\n118\n00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:53,794\nremove -Dhcpserverv4reservation command.\n\n119\n00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:54,757\n>> Mm-hm\n>> All right,\n\n120\n00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:57,150\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n121\n00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,041\nStay

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,695\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:08,535\nIn this segment,\n\n3\n00:00:08,535 --> 00:00:12,470\nwe're gonna take a look at monitoring\nthe status of our DHCP server.\n\n4\n00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,590\nFor the most part, when you set up a DHCP\nserver, you get it configured, you turn it\n\n5\n00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,200\non, you walk away, and you never mess\nwith it again, that's it, right?\n\n6\n00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,488\n>> Until people come crying to you,\nI can't get on the network,\n\n7\n00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:25,449\nI can't get an IP address, and you go oh,\nwow, yeah, I should check that out.\n\n8\n00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,736\n>> So there are times when we\nneed to take a look at it,\n\n9\n00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:31,067\nmake sure things are working properly,\nthat we've got IPs available.\n\n10\n00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:33,308\nAnd that's the main thing\nthat we need to track,\n\n11\n00:00:33,308 --> 00:00:36,730\nis making sure that we don't run\nout of IP addresses in our pool.\n\n12\n00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,320\nThat used to never be a problem.\n\n13\n00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,100\nYou'd create a network or\na pool size that was large enough, and\n\n14\n00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,400\nyou never worry about it.\n\n15\n00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,210\nBut recently, it's become more of\na problem where people have phones and\n\n16\n00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,970\ntablets that are adding, doubling,\n\n17\n00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,335\nor tripling the amount of\nIPs a single person takes.\n\n18\n00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:50,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As\n\n19\n00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,991\nwe're starting to see more smartwatches\ncome out now, these wearables,\n\n20\n00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:56,480\nthat IP utilization is really\ngone through the roof.\n\n21\n00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,485\nSo keeping tabs on how much of your pool\nhas been leased out is pretty important.\n\n22\n00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:01,093\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n23\n00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:04,067\nDefinitely, it is one of the big\nthings that we always run into is,\n\n24\n00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,141\nI mean DHCP was a very\ndynamic environment, so\n\n25\n00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:09,830\nwe've gotta make sure we're monitoring it,\nkeeping track of what's going on.\n\n26\n00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,127\n>> All right.\nSo let's take a look at\n\n27\n00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:15,188\nsome of the commands that are available\nfor us for helping to monitor, right?\n\n28\n00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:19,381\nThere's some that we've already seen,\nthings like,\n\n29\n00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:22,153\nGet-Service DHCPServer, right?\n\n30\n00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:25,150\nIf we wanna make sure that DHCP\nservice is actually running,\n\n31\n00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,500\nwe can quick query it and\nsee if that status is running or not.\n\n32\n00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,950\nI know my server is up.\n\n33\n00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,500\nIf I'm issuing out IPs,\nI should have leases, and\n\n34\n00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,080\nI'll probably want to be able to query and\nlook at the leases that are out there.\n\n35\n00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,480\nNow, you may have a ton of leases or\nyou may have a very small amount.\n\n36\n00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,780\nIt just depends on the size of\nthe client base on your system.\n\n37\n00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,940\nBut either way,\nthe commands are all pretty much the same.\n\n38\n00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,420\nWe can run get-DHCPServerv4Leases,\nor lease.\n\n39\n00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,375\nSorry, it's singular.\n\n40\n00:01:55,375 --> 00:02:00,028\nGet-DHCPServerv4Lease, and\nyou do have to specify a scope ID.\n\n41\n00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:03,709\nSo I'll do -ScopeID and\nspecify the scope that I'm looking at.\n\n42\n00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:08,210\nI'm gonna look at the 192.168.29.0 scope.\n\n43\n00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,130\nWhen I run that, it's gonna show\nall of the leases that I have.\n\n44\n00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:12,850\nNow, I've only got one,\n\n45\n00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,650\nthis is a reservation that we\ncreated in another segment.\n\n46\n00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,150\nI can see the IP address that's assigned,\nthe MAC address tied to that machine and\n\n47\n00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,810\nit's HostName, and I can see it's state.\n\n48\n00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,020\nNow normally you'll see Active or\nInactiveReservation, like this.\n\n49\n00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,670\nActive means that somebody's\nactively using that address.\n\n50\n00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,710\nInactive would mean it's not in use.\n\n51\n00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,165\nNow normally inactive means the IP\nbecomes available for use again.\n\n52\n00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:38,960\nIt'll be issued out for\nuse to other people.\n\n53\n00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,570\nBut InactiveReservation\nmeans it's being held.\n\n54\n00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,470\nThis client is not up and\nusing the address yet, but\n\n55\n00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,845\nif they want it, it's being reserved and\nit would go active when they ask for it.\n\n56\n00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:50,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n57\n00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,780\nAnother good one to use with\nthat one is that BadLeases.\n\n58\n00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,410\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Because that's one that you'll run\n\n59\n00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,035\ninto like you've got an issue if a client,\nif there's a conflict of addresses like if\n\n60\n00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:03,280\na DHCP tries to pass out an address\nto a node, but then the IP\n\n61\n00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,340\naddresses may be statically mapped to\nsomething else and we get a conflict.\n\n62\n00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,480\nIt'll report it with that\nbad lease as a parameter.\n\n63\n00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,880\n>> Yeah, there's actually another type of\nlease that might not show up by default,\n\n64\n00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,410\nwhich is when you have a routing and\nremote access server.\n\n65\n00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,800\nIt will grab pools of IPs to use for\nVPN clients.\n\n66\n00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,590\n>> And,\nthose might not show up by default too.\n\n67\n00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,550\nSo, there is another one.\n\n68\n00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,530\nInstead of BadLeases,\nwe can say AllLeases.\n\n69\n00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,799\nAnd now it'll show you everything,\ngood, bad, inactive, active,\n\n70\n00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,806\nones that are for remote access.\n\n71\n00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,456\nIt'll show you all leases.\n\n72\n00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:40,230\nNow, in my database here I've only\ngot one lease, so it's no big deal.\n\n73\n00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,080\nBut, what if you've got thousands of them?\n\n74\n00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,740\nThis can get really out of hand.\n\n75\n00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,210\nIf you're looking for\nsomething in particular,\n\n76\n00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,690\ndon't forget about the Where-Object\nfilter that's available, right?\n\n77\n00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,110\nWe can take our command output, and\nwe can pipe that into Where-Object, and\n\n78\n00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,660\nyou can filter based on anything.\n\n79\n00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,750\nSo I could say if a particular property,\nlike if I'm looking for a HostName,\n\n80\n00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,850\nI could say I'm trying to find that\nwhere it equals donlaptop, right.\n\n81\n00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,010\nAnd now it's gonna return just that lease.\n\n82\n00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,530\nOr I could say I'm looking for\na particular IP.\n\n83\n00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:21,132\nSo I could say the Property is\nIPAddress and say it equals 10.\n\n84\n00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:27,275\n192.168.29.123, and\nit's gonna return that one.\n\n85\n00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:30,830\nNow, the get-dhcp server v4 release,\n\n86\n00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,630\nit does actually have a dash IP\naddress and dash computer name option.\n\n87\n00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,970\nI've never been able to\nget to those to work.\n\n88\n00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,530\nWe were trying during the break\nbefore this segment started,\n\n89\n00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,410\nbecause we had some\nquestions in the chat room.\n\n90\n00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,680\nI've never been able to get it to work.\n\n91\n00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,460\nSo, Where-Object, you know that works,\nyou just parse your output together.\n\n92\n00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,422\nSo, quick, easy and\nthere's your information on that lease.\n\n93\n00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:55,150\nThere is another neat command\nthat I do want to show,\n\n94\n00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,030\nwhich is to pull up our\nDHCP server statistics.\n\n95\n00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,880\nSometimes you just want to know\nhow many IPs we have left,\n\n96\n00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,810\nhow much of our pool is in use?\n\n97\n00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,610\nWhat are the statistics for our server?\n\n98\n00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,020\nAnd so, there's a cool command for that.\n\n99\n00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,170\n>> Yeah.\nThis is the kind of thing you want to\n\n100\n00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,270\nmonitor proactively, cuz I want to know\nbefore I run out of IP addresses, right.\n\n101\n00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,800\nI don't want to wait until I've got nodes\non the network that can't connect, or\n\n102\n00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,200\npeople are saying they\ncan't get any access.\n\n103\n00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,980\nSo you monitor those\non a regular basis and\n\n104\n00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,970\nyou can see that trend, things like that.\n\n105\n00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,210\nIf we keep going at this rate,\n\n106\n00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,680\nin a few more weeks we're\ngonna be out of IP addresses.\n\n107\n00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,500\nSo if you're not monitoring it, you're\nnot gonna know until there's a problem.\n\n108\n00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,802\n>> Yeah, and\nthis one's a record setter for long names.\n\n109\n00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:36,520\nIt's Get-DhcpServerv4ScopeStatistics, and\n\n110\n00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,420\nunfortunately tab autocomplete\nreally doesn't help you on this one.\n\n111\n00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,304\nBecause it's not unique until you\nget to that [INAUDIBLE] key word.\n\n112\n00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:45,624\nBut, it's a long one and then you just\ntell it the scope that you want to see.\n\n113\n00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:50,283\nI'm gonna say scope id 192.168.29.0,\nand when you run that,\n\n114\n00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,270\nyou'll get some information back on it.\n\n115\n00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,540\nThe scope id, how many free or\nin use leases that it has,\n\n116\n00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,070\nthe percentage in use, the reserved IP's.\n\n117\n00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,790\nAny pending leases,\nwhere we've offered to somebody, but\n\n118\n00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,500\nthey haven't acknowledged it yet.\n\n119\n00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,350\nSo you start to see that.\n\n120\n00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,320\nAnd there's actually more\nthen what fits on the screen,\n\n121\n00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,850\nif we do a format list on it.\n\n122\n00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,350\nYou'll see a little bit more here.\n\n123\n00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,290\nAddress is free on this server,\nfree on partner servers, and so on.\n\n124\n00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,300\nThis information gets displayed letting us\nknow the status of this system, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,840\nMy system's not actively\nissuing out DHCP addresses, so\n\n126\n00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,900\nmost of this is useless,\nmy address has three as zero, that's odd.\n\n127\n00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,410\n>> I'm not sure why that's\nshowing up as zero.\n\n128\n00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,750\nI was thinking the same thing.\n\n129\n00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,520\nShould have 50 in there, right?\n\n130\n00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,725\n>> I should have, well,\n49 because I've got that reservation.\n\n131\n00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:38,110\n>> But yeah, it's odd that that's\nshowing up as zero on mine, maybe I-\n\n132\n00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,670\n>> The scope is active, right?\n\n133\n00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,959\nWe didn't disable it at some point?\n\n134\n00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,230\n>> Yeah, not that I know of.\n\n135\n00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,900\nOh, did we leave it deactivated?\n\n136\n00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,380\n>> I know we were playing with it, so.\n\n137\n00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,210\n>> I might have left it deactivated.\n\n138\n00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,080\nThat might be why it's\nshowing three as zero.\n\n139\n00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,980\nWhen you deactivate a scope it's not\nissuing out any more leases, and\n\n140\n00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,734\nso it may well show up as zero like that.\n\n141\n00:06:58,734 --> 00:06:59,675\nLet's see.\n\n142\n00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:01,231\nOh, my scope is inactive.\n\n143\n00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:01,811\n>> Is it?\n\n144\n00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:06,551\n>> I just did a get-dhcpserverserver4scope\nand sure enough the state is inactive so\n\n145\n00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:11,200\nI really need to go in there and,\nactually, it’d be faster to use the GUI.\n\n146\n00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,221\nThis is exactly what we shouldn’t\ndo in during a [INAUDIBLE]\n\n147\n00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:13,769\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n148\n00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:14,625\n>> But might as well\n\n149\n00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,790\nactivate it real quick.\n\n150\n00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,904\nSo that’s why it-\n>> If you need to see that command,\n\n151\n00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,827\nwatch the previous segment\nwe ran on PowerShell,\n\n152\n00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:21,632\nwe showed you how to\ndeactivate those scopes.\n\n153\n00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:27,529\n>> Well, yeah, I guess if we wanna be all\nPowerShell politically correct, whatever.\n\n154\n00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,514\n>> [LAUGH] I want to watch Don type more.\n\n155\n00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:34,970\n>> Yeah, set-dchpserverv4scope -ScopeID\n\n156\n00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,391\n192.168.29.0- Status Active-\n>> State.\n\n157\n00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,081\n>> Oh, state active.\n\n158\n00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:43,976\nWell see, there we go.\n\n159\n00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:44,938\nI should have known it.\n\n160\n00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:45,775\nSo now it's active.\n\n161\n00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:46,750\nAnd it's up and running.\n\n162\n00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,260\nSo let's pull those statistics again.\n\n163\n00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,530\n>> See if we get some better response.\n\n164\n00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,026\n>> Now I've got Free 42, Inuse 1.\n\n165\n00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:55,767\nNow, odd that I would get Free 42,\n\n166\n00:07:55,767 --> 00:08:00,643\nwhen I've got a scope that should\nbe 50 IPs and Reservation 1.\n\n167\n00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:02,080\nWhy 42?\n\n168\n00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,790\nWell, in another segment,\nwe created some exclusion ranges, and\n\n169\n00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,370\nI excluded six or seven IP's-\n>> That's right.\n\n170\n00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,870\nYep.\n>> I think I excluded seven IP's.\n\n171\n00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,480\nSo, I excluded some IP's, and\nthose are coming out of that pool, so\n\n172\n00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,590\nit's not showing them there, but\nI can see now my usage is 2.3% usage, so\n\n173\n00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,490\nI have one address out there,\nand it is a reservation.\n\n174\n00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,270\nSo, quick,\neasy way to see the statistics, and hey,\n\n175\n00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,930\nit benefited us here\n>> Right.\n\n176\n00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,340\n>> Saw that my scope was inactive.\n\n177\n00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,060\n[LAUGH]\nAnd that might actually be why some of our\n\n178\n00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,040\nfilters weren't working earlier, if it's\ninactive it might not be returning them.\n\n179\n00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,970\nBut either way pulling up basic statistics\non your DHCP server, just a great way of\n\n180\n00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,940\nevaluating whether functioning right,\nand just to run some basic tasks.\n\n181\n00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,770\n>> Like I said, it really should be\nsomething that we do periodically,\n\n182\n00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,920\njust to keep an eye on what's going on,\nbecause it is a very dynamic environment.\n\n183\n00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,872\nThings change.\nYou have an influx of people that\n\n184\n00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:54,145\nare coming in with new phones and\ntablets, and\n\n185\n00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:56,428\nyou run out of IP addresses\nbefore you know it.\n\n186\n00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:57,590\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n187\n00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,360\nAll right, well that's about it for\nstatistics.\n\n188\n00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,930\nObviously there's other\nthings you can monitor.\n\n189\n00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,370\nIf you reach into the WMI or\nthe CIM there's a ton of stuff there, but\n\n190\n00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,990\nit kind of gets outside of\nthe PowerShell on that one, so.\n\n191\n00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,710\n>> And we're currently using PowerShell 4,\nright?\n\n192\n00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,090\nWe're on version 4.1 here.\n\n193\n00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,185\n>> Yeah, we had a question in\nthe chatroom about which version of\n\n194\n00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:16,180\nPowerShell this was in.\n\n195\n00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,137\nWe've been using PowerShell version 4 for\nall of our different stuff.\n\n196\n00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:21,681\nIt's what's packaged\nwith Windows Server 2012.\n\n197\n00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,715\nIf you're in the older\nversions of Power Shell,\n\n198\n00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:25,760\nsome of the statistics\ncommands aren't there.\n\n199\n00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360\nThose are usually the newer ones.\n\n200\n00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,400\nBut the other ones we've used as far\nas the DHCP leases and reservations,\n\n201\n00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,520\nthose have all been there for a long time.\n\n202\n00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:38,210\nAll right, well,\nin this segment we got a chance to see\n\n203\n00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,840\nhow to pull some statistics for\nour DHCP server.\n\n204\n00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:47,040\nWe also looked at how to pull up our\nactive leases, as well as special type\n\n205\n00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,240\nleases, like bad leases, or those remote\naccess leases that might be out there.\n\n206\n00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,860\nAnd we get to see pulling up information\njust on a scope on generals.\n\n207\n00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,210\nSo all good stuff for\nmonitoring the status of a DHCP server.\n\n208\n00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,010\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n209\n00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,053\nStay tuned.\nWe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n210\n00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:10,029\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,790\nIn this\n\n2\n00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,740\nsegment, we're gonna take a look at\ninstalling the active directory domain\n\n3\n00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,620\nservices using PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,590\nSo, one of the first things you're gonna\ndo if you're setting up a new forest, or\n\n5\n00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,660\nif you're adding another\ndomain to your forest, or\n\n6\n00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,180\nif you're adding an additional\ndomain controller.\n\n7\n00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,530\nTo an existing domain, part of\ninstalling the active directory and\n\n8\n00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,210\ngetting that configured\nis installing the role.\n\n9\n00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,920\nSo let's take a look at how we\ncan do that through PowerShell.\n\n10\n00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,710\nIf we pull up my screen here, the command\nis pretty straightforward it's just going\n\n11\n00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,900\nto be install dash windows feature, And\n\n12\n00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,840\nthen the name of the role that I want\nto install, dash name parameter and\n\n13\n00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,030\nthe name is going to be AD\ndash domain dash services.\n\n14\n00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,980\nSo that's the name of the role\nthat I want to install.\n\n15\n00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,730\nI also have to decide whether or not I\nwant to include the management tools.\n\n16\n00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,610\nIn this case, I am going to, so\n\n17\n00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,480\nI'll do the include Management tools,\nand I'll hit Enter, and\n\n18\n00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,600\nthat's gonna go ahead and install the role\nactive directory domain services.\n\n19\n00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,760\nNow, remember while this is installing,\nwhen you install a role like this,\n\n20\n00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,170\nonce it's finished,\nI don't have a domain controller, right?\n\n21\n00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,860\nBut I've installed all the pieces,\nI've unpacked all the pieces necessary\n\n22\n00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,460\nTo make this a domain controller,\nbut I still have to go back and\n\n23\n00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,060\nactually configure the Active\nDirectory Domain Services role, so\n\n24\n00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,600\nthat I can make this a domain controller.\n\n25\n00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,460\nSo this command is just\ninstalling the role.\n\n26\n00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,320\nSo probably what we should do here\nis take a little TV time out,\n\n27\n00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,470\nLet this finish installing the role,\nwe'll come back and\n\n28\n00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,130\nwe'll verify that, that role got installed\nsuccessfully, and we'll go from there.\n\n29\n00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,068\nSo, we'll see you guys back\nhere in just a couple minutes.\n\n30\n00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:52,837\n[MUSIC]\n\n31\n00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:54,875\nSo, that command has completed, and\n\n32\n00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:59,610\nlet's see if we can verify that that\nrole got installed successfully.\n\n33\n00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,390\nSo, we take a look at my screen here.\n\n34\n00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,290\nI can see the exit code was success,\nso everything looks good.\n\n35\n00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,340\nSo, how do I verify that it\nactually installed that role?\n\n36\n00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,620\nMy favorite way is just to\nget a list of the commands.\n\n37\n00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,350\nMake sure that they module for\nactive directory got installed.\n\n38\n00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,520\nBy installing that role that's gonna\ninclude the active directory module for\n\n39\n00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,700\nWindows powershell.\n\n40\n00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,900\nSo that it'll have all the commands\nnecessary to work with active directory\n\n41\n00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,920\nas well as the active\ndirectory deployment module.\n\n42\n00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,780\nAll the commands I need to create\na forest, create a new child domain,\n\n43\n00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,000\nadd additional domain controllers and\nthings like that.\n\n44\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,840\nSo let's just do a real\nquick Get command and\n\n45\n00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,040\nthen I'm going to pull up the module,\nlet's verify that ADDS deployment module,\n\n46\n00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,580\nso ADDS deployment is the name of\nthe module I hit enter and sure enough\n\n47\n00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,000\nthere's a list of commands I now have\navailable which is a good indication that\n\n48\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,810\nthat active directory role was installed,\nagain I don't have a domain controller,\n\n49\n00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,295\nI don't have a domain, I didn't create\nanything, All I did was install the roll.\n\n50\n00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:05,735\nAnd in future segment's we'll go back and\nwe'll take a look at these commands.\n\n51\n00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:10,485\nLike the first one we'll be using\nis gonna install that ADDSForest.\n\n52\n00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:13,415\nCreate that first domain\nin our organization.\n\n53\n00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:17,595\nThen in future segments we'll take a look\nat adding, creating a child domain,\n\n54\n00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:21,480\nadding additional domain\ncontrollers to an existing domain.\n\n55\n00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,190\nAnd so on.\n\n56\n00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,610\nSo in this episode all we really did\nwas we saw how to install the role.\n\n57\n00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,500\nIn future segments we'll take a look\nat adding our domain controllers and\n\n58\n00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,480\nwe'll go from there.\n\n59\n00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,110\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n60\n00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,970\nStay tuned.\n\n61\n00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,091\nMore PowerShell coming your way.\n\n62\n00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:42,239\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:08,418\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:12,680\nIn this segment, we're gonna take a look\nat creating an active directory forest\n\n3\n00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,250\nfrom the PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,000\nIf you're just getting started with\nactive directory this is step number one.\n\n5\n00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,215\nRight, we need to get that forest\ncreated which means Installing\n\n6\n00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:22,851\nthe Active Directory feature and\n\n7\n00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:25,940\nbringing up our first\nActive Directory domain controllers.\n\n8\n00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,950\nSo that's what we're gonna kick off,\nright here.\n\n9\n00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,450\n>> Let's do it.\nAll right, so\n\n10\n00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,250\njust like when you were installing Active\nDirectory through the GUI there's really\n\n11\n00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,590\na two step process right?\n\n12\n00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,650\nFirst you have to install\nthe role which unpacks all\n\n13\n00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,680\nthe files needed to make\nit a domain controller, but\n\n14\n00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,870\nremember at the end of that you\ndon't have a domain controller yet.\n\n15\n00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,280\nYou still have to go\nthrough the configuration.\n\n16\n00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,800\nSo we pull up my screen here, the first\nthing I'm gonna do is install that role,\n\n17\n00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,780\nand we've seen this on our\nother PowerShell segments,\n\n18\n00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,860\nit's just gonna be our\ninstall-windows feature.\n\n19\n00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,500\nAnd there we go, Install-windowsFeature,\nand then the name of that feature that we\n\n20\n00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,320\nwant to install is gonna\nbe the AD-domain-services.\n\n21\n00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,569\nSo AD-domain-services, and\n\n22\n00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:11,861\nas we've said before in\na couple of other segments,\n\n23\n00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:18,734\nI've got a choice here,\nif I want to install the management tools.\n\n24\n00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:21,054\nThis is going to be a full blown server,\nso\n\n25\n00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:23,651\nwe are going to include\nthe management tools.\n\n26\n00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,940\nI'll hit Enter, and\nthat shouldn't take very long.\n\n27\n00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,690\nIt'll unpack all those files,\nand get this ready for\n\n28\n00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,160\nme to make our domain controller.\n\n29\n00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,830\nAnd as Don was saying,\nthe first one we bring up,\n\n30\n00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,680\nthe first I have nothing on this network.\n\n31\n00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,700\nSo the first server I take, and\nI install an Active Directory on,\n\n32\n00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,760\nthat's going to be my forced\nroot domain controller...\n\n33\n00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,980\nRight, that's the one that's gonna\nhave a couple of things that no other\n\n34\n00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,110\ndomain controllers gonna\nhave in my environment.\n\n35\n00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,830\nIt's gonna have the scheme admins group,\nmy enterprise admins group, what else.\n\n36\n00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,350\nThat's where the only writable copy\nof the schema's gonna be located so\n\n37\n00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,170\nit our special domain controller.\n\n38\n00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,370\nIt's got those two forest-wide FSMOs,\nright.\n\n39\n00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,570\nThe schema master and the domain\nnaming master are gonna be on there.\n\n40\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,390\n>> Yeah, it's a pretty important one.\n\n41\n00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,540\nAll these tools, at least at this stage,\nare identical no matter what we're doing.\n\n42\n00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,470\nBut once we do that setup,\nthis will be a pretty big step.\n\n43\n00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,970\nNow there is other infrastructure\nwe probably need to have in\n\n44\n00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,270\nplace before we jump\nthrough a lot of this and\n\n45\n00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,790\nwe've covered it in some of out other\nsegments so we don't want to do it here.\n\n46\n00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,980\nBut you'll typically need things like\na DNS server to be able to store your\n\n47\n00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,930\nrecords.\n\n48\n00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,330\nYou may need a DHCP server\nto support your clients and\n\n49\n00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,930\nso on, So right here step one,\nyou might not be\n\n50\n00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,580\nready to just jump right into deploying\nthat active directory but once\n\n51\n00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,510\nyou've got your infrastructure in place\nthe steps are pretty straight forward.\n\n52\n00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,530\n>> They really are.\n\n53\n00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,870\n>> In typical Microsoft fashion\nwe're gonna sit here at 91%.\n\n54\n00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,825\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Waiting, that's.\n\n55\n00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:48,815\n>> Right.\n\n56\n00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:50,215\nAll the way to the end and stop.\n\n57\n00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:52,835\nSo once we get this rolling here,\nwe'll do a quick\n\n58\n00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:56,815\ncommand that we wanna make sure that\nthe role got installed properly.\n\n59\n00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:59,150\nAnd an easy way to do that through\nPowerShell is just to get a list of\n\n60\n00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,160\nall the commands, right?\n\n61\n00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,140\nCuz when we installed it that should\ninclude the active directory module for\n\n62\n00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,700\nWindows PowerShell as well as\nthe ADDS deployment module.\n\n63\n00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,370\nThis is a module they've added recently\nthat gives me the ability to run\n\n64\n00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,800\nall these commands like add ADDS porous,\nand add ADDS domain,\n\n65\n00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,910\na domain controller and things like that.\n\n66\n00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,080\nSo there we go the command is finished,\nlooks I've got an Exit Code of Success.\n\n67\n00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,530\nSo hopefully everything went well.\n\n68\n00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,560\nAs I said, the next thing I'm gonna\ndo is just gonna be a Get-Command and\n\n69\n00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,670\nthen, -module, and\nthe name of that module is addsdeployment.\n\n70\n00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,810\nAnd as the tab auto-fill work,\n\n71\n00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,096\nwhich pretty good indication\nthat it's gonna be there, right.\n\n72\n00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:46,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So hit enter.\n\n73\n00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,200\nAnd here you can see the commands,\nand now I can use to deploy my domain\n\n74\n00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,630\ncontrollers and set up my active\ndirectory infrastructure from powershell.\n\n75\n00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,204\nSo the first one I'm going to do\nagain on this brand new server,\n\n76\n00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:02,780\nwe're going to do an install\ndash ADDS forest.\n\n77\n00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,910\nWhen you first look at this you might\nthink well I'm going to create a domain\n\n78\n00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,320\nright but it's your first\ndomain in your entire force.\n\n79\n00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,520\nSo it's a different\ncommand to set that up.\n\n80\n00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,600\n>> And I know one thing that\nyou always say Mike is,\n\n81\n00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,234\nremember what you would see in the GUI,\nright.\n\n82\n00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:18,990\nAnd when we launch the GUI one of\nthe first screens we get is a series of\n\n83\n00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,460\nradio buttons where it's asking, is\nthis a new forest or an existing forest?\n\n84\n00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,380\nOn the next screen it says Is this\na domain controller in a new domain or\n\n85\n00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,140\na domain controller in an existing domain?\n\n86\n00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,830\nWell, we don't get those as\ncommand line options here,\n\n87\n00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,500\nwe get those as separate commands.\n\n88\n00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,830\nSo install ADDS domain,\nthat's a new domain,\n\n89\n00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,040\nADDS forest, that's a whole new forest and\nADDS domain controller,\n\n90\n00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,710\nthat's an additional domain\ncontroller in an existing forest.\n\n91\n00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,750\nSo the command we use is what's\ndetermining that scenario.\n\n92\n00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,640\n>> Exactly.\nAll right, so\n\n93\n00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,188\nwhen we run this command\nthe install-adds forest.\n\n94\n00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:56,830\nThere's a couple different ways\nwe can run about this, right?\n\n95\n00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,680\nUsually with PowerShell you've got,\nyou can run the bare minimum, right?\n\n96\n00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,850\nThe required parameters and\nyou can get the job done.\n\n97\n00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,450\nBut then as always, there's several\ndifferent parameters that I can include,\n\n98\n00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,420\ndepending on what I'm trying to do.\n\n99\n00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,250\nI've got a link in the show notes that\nwill take you out to TechNet and show you\n\n100\n00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,790\nall the different parameters that are\navailable with install dash ADDS forest.\n\n101\n00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,600\nThe required ones are going\nto be the name of the domain.\n\n102\n00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,960\nI've got to tell it what I'm going to call\nthis and the parameters just, Domain name,\n\n103\n00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,570\nand then I'm gonna call this one,\nitprotv.lab and\n\n104\n00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,470\nthen the other one is\ngonna be installed-dns.\n\n105\n00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,330\nBecause active directory is going to\nrequire DNS, and as Don was saying,\n\n106\n00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,590\nyou might have done some\nof this a head of time.\n\n107\n00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,220\nYou might have already set up a DNS\nserver, and things like that.\n\n108\n00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,100\nIn which case you can use a switch\ndash create DNS delegation.\n\n109\n00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,550\nThat would create the delegation\non that DNS server.\n\n110\n00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,310\nIn this case I'm just gonna go ahead and\ninstall DNS.\n\n111\n00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,470\nI am gonna do a couple\nmore switches in here.\n\n112\n00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,260\nI could hit Enter, and we could be done,\nI could have a default forest setup.\n\n113\n00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,040\nBut if I do that,\nit's gonna pick the default domain mode,\n\n114\n00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,910\nand the forest mode, right?\n\n115\n00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,430\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nshow you guys the switches for that,\n\n116\n00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,610\njust in case you wanted to.\n\n117\n00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,730\nSince this is my first server, there's\nno other domain controllers out there,\n\n118\n00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,450\nI'm installing 2012 R2,\nthen it would default to\n\n119\n00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,710\nthat 2012 R2 domain functional level and\nforest functional level.\n\n120\n00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,145\nIf you already had to make, well in\nthis case we've got a new forest, so\n\n121\n00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:28,815\nI wouldn't have any other\ndomain controllers out there.\n\n122\n00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:31,665\n>> Right.\n>> But maybe I want to specify, and let me\n\n123\n00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:36,265\ngo ahead and type as I'm talking here,\nand I'll show you what my options are.\n\n124\n00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:42,215\nSo for my domain mode, I can just hit tab,\nand you can see like default, 2008 mode.\n\n125\n00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:48,790\nAnd I'm kinda wrapping around the screen\nthere, but 2008 R2 mode, 2012 In 2012 R2.\n\n126\n00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,540\nSo you might wanna step that down.\n\n127\n00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,580\nYou might know ahead of time\nthat you've got plans to install\n\n128\n00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,210\na 2008 domain controller, or you're gonna\nbe merging, or something like that.\n\n129\n00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,000\nSo maybe you want to use a lower domain\nmode, or forest functional mode.\n\n130\n00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,440\n>> The thing I always say is,\nremember that you can't change this.\n\n131\n00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,410\n>> Right.\n>> So like, once it's set at 2012 R2 mode,\n\n132\n00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,500\nyou can't go back to a lower mode\n>> You can go up to a newer mode, but\n\n133\n00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,450\nyou can never go back to an older mode.\n\n134\n00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,770\nSo I always tell people,\nhey look at what your requirements are and\n\n135\n00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,680\nfigure out which forest\nfunctional level and\n\n136\n00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,280\nwhich domain functional level provides\nthe minimum features that you need.\n\n137\n00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,275\nWhich one gets you you\nto where you need and\n\n138\n00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:28,815\npick that one cuz you can always increase\nit later, but you can't decrease it.\n\n139\n00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,675\nSo, getting this right in\nthe beginning is really important.\n\n140\n00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:33,975\n>> Exactly, and you'll notice\nsometimes the higher functional\n\n141\n00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:37,525\nlevels don't give you any\nadditional functionality.\n\n142\n00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,835\nSo, there's no reason to go to 2012 R2\nforce mode because it doesn't give me\n\n143\n00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:44,580\nanything, it just limits\nwhat I can do in the future.\n\n144\n00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,950\nBut, let me get that started.\n\n145\n00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,810\nI hit my up arrow and\nit brought up that last command there so\n\n146\n00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,550\nwe'll go with 2012 R2 mode just\nbecause we can, forest mode as well.\n\n147\n00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,190\nIf I could spell forest.\n\n148\n00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,460\nWe'll do the same thing.\n\n149\n00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,250\nWe'll go to 2012 R2 mode and\nthen what else did I wanna show you?\n\n150\n00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,270\nI'm not going to change these but\nI wanna show you the parameter.\n\n151\n00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,990\nYou can also set the locations again,\nthink back to the GUI, right?\n\n152\n00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,060\nWhen you get towards\nthe end of the wizard,\n\n153\n00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,860\nit asked you where do you\nwanna put that NDTS.DIT.\n\n154\n00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,880\nWhere do I wanna put the database,\nwhere do I wanna put the log files for\n\n155\n00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,720\nthat database, and where do I wanna\nput the SIS file folder structure?\n\n156\n00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,124\nAnd if I had a second drive in here,\nI might really want to switch out or\n\n157\n00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:28,180\nsplit up where that database and\nthose log files are located so\n\n158\n00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,010\nthey go on different drives.\n\n159\n00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,100\nThe parameter for that is just\ngoing to be there's database path.\n\n160\n00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,680\nAnd then I could specify something\nlike d:\\ and whatever I wanted to do.\n\n161\n00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,900\nSome other parameters you could use in\nthere would be the sys bal path and\n\n162\n00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,340\nthe log path.\n\n163\n00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,070\nBut for this example I'm just gonna go\nwith what we've got because I've got\n\n164\n00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,580\na single drive in this virtual machine.\n\n165\n00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,500\nSo I should be able to hit Enter and\nbecause I didn't specify, again,\n\n166\n00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,140\nI've got that link to TechNet and it'll\nshow you all these different parameters.\n\n167\n00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,290\nIn the command I could have\nspecified the safe mode password,\n\n168\n00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,920\nright, the DSRM, the Directory\nService Restore Mode password.\n\n169\n00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,000\nBut, best practice, security wise,\n\n170\n00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,600\nsays that you don't really wanna type that\nin line if somebody is standing over your\n\n171\n00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,850\nshoulder, or if you're saving that in\na script that's gonna be plain text.\n\n172\n00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,597\nSo, if you leave that parameter out\nit will do it by default; it will do\n\n173\n00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:24,080\na prompt, and it's gonna secure it.\n\n174\n00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,820\nYou'll notice that it's gonna\ngive me some asterisks there and\n\n175\n00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,240\nnot show anybody what I'm typing.\n\n176\n00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,510\nAnd then, once I do that,\nit's gonna tell me yeah,\n\n177\n00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,570\nit's getting ready to make\nit a domain controller.\n\n178\n00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:42,470\nI hit Yes, for all then we'll watch it go\nthrough here and I should've skipped it.\n\n179\n00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,570\nThere is another parameter,\nyou can do a skip precheck.\n\n180\n00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,860\nIn the real world I typically wanna\ngo through those prechecks and\n\n181\n00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,820\nmake sure I have all the requirements\nto install active directory in this lab\n\n182\n00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,260\nI probably should have added that switch\nand it would just skip the checks here.\n\n183\n00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,480\nSo we'll let it go through that and this\nmight be a good place if we want to do\n\n184\n00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,860\na little, oh there is kind\nof cool It's cool to watch.\n\n185\n00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,920\nOne of the things that I really like about\nthis, you can watch this right here and\n\n186\n00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,880\nyou'll see it go through the different\nsteps of installing active directory.\n\n187\n00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,735\nYou'll see it creating the scheme of\npartition, the configuration partition,\n\n188\n00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:22,160\nmy domain partition installing DNS and\nthings like that.\n\n189\n00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,640\n>> And, part of this, like what it's doing\nright now, it's actually installing DNS,\n\n190\n00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,580\nso it's not even installing\nthe active directory domain yet.\n\n191\n00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,020\nWhen it's done with the installing DNS\nit'll create the records, it'll then have\n\n192\n00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,270\nto copy a template of the active\ndirectory database over into place and\n\n193\n00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,810\nthen start customizing\nit with the install.\n\n194\n00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,050\nSo, it does take a minute,\n\n195\n00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,530\nmaybe we can just take a little\ntv timeout here and pause.\n\n196\n00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,690\nAnd let this run and\nthen when it's done we can pick back up.\n\n197\n00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,540\nCuz it can be a little\nboring just staring too so.\n\n198\n00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,080\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,000\n>> Let's take a pause here and\n\n200\n00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,860\nas soon as that's completed we'll\njump right back in and go through and\n\n201\n00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,020\nverify our installation.\n\n202\n00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,469\nSo stay tuned we'll be\nback in just a moment.\n\n203\n00:10:54,469 --> 00:11:01,844\n[MUSIC]\n\n204\n00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:03,980\nAll right that didn't\ntake too terribly long.\n\n205\n00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,200\nNow, during the break it\nfinished installing that roll and\n\n206\n00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,540\nit rebooted the server.\n\n207\n00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,590\nYou know, promoting a domain\ncontroller does require a reboot.\n\n208\n00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,500\nSo now the system is rebooted and\nwe're ready to jump back in and\n\n209\n00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,620\nverify what happened.\n\n210\n00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,570\n>> All right so\nwe'll take a look at my screen over here.\n\n211\n00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,470\nI've logged back into the server,\nI've pulled up server manager.\n\n212\n00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,150\nAnd all I'm gonna do is go over here\nto one, and you can see I've got active\n\n213\n00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:30,590\ndirectory domain services installed\nhere in my console so if I take a peek.\n\n214\n00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,420\nUsually what I'll do,\njust to verify my successful installation,\n\n215\n00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,290\nI might open up one of these tools and\njust make sure that everything's there.\n\n216\n00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,939\nWe could navigate in windows explorer and\nverify that sysval got created and\n\n217\n00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:44,230\nthat the data base got created.\n\n218\n00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,020\nBut im pretty confident by looking at\nthis that active directory opens up\n\n219\n00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,840\nwe should be good to go.\n\n220\n00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,350\nThe other thing I wanted to show you\nthough is let's take a look at sites and\n\n221\n00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,892\nservices.\n\n222\n00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:58,720\nAll right, and I know that is\n\n223\n00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,590\nreally small guys I can't really change\nthe size of that but if I come down here\n\n224\n00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,000\nto fault first site name and my servers\nthere is my server01, all right.\n\n225\n00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:13,132\nAnd if I take a look at, let's do this.\n\n226\n00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,904\nWhat was I gonna show you guys?\n\n227\n00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,984\nNow I kinda forgot what\nI was gonna show you.\n\n228\n00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:22,344\n>> You were just gonna make\nsure the domain was there, and\n\n229\n00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:23,505\nthat we had our OUs, and.\n\n230\n00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:24,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n231\n00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,570\nEverything looks good there,\nI can see my server there.\n\n232\n00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:33,250\nOh, I was gonna show you raising that\ndomain and force functional level.\n\n233\n00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,370\nOff Camera: I think you have\nto do it; there you go...\n\n234\n00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,005\nThat's domain in trust actually,\nwrong console for that one.\n\n235\n00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's go over to domains and\n\n236\n00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:48,130\ntrust real quick and here we can take\na look, and there I can see my domain.\n\n237\n00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,140\nIf I right click on it,\ndo domain functional level,\n\n238\n00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,980\nI can see that I'm already at 2212 RT,\nlike we said on our command.\n\n239\n00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,370\nMy forest, if I right click up here and\nchange my forest functional level.\n\n240\n00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,560\nI'll see that that is sent to 2012 R2,\nas well.\n\n241\n00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,880\nSuccess installing my domain controller,\nand\n\n242\n00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,980\ncreating a brand new forest for\nactive directory.\n\n243\n00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,630\n>> And Mike, why don't you pull up your\nDNS forward look up zone also because\n\n244\n00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,370\nyou'll see that when heading created\nall the SRV records necessary\n\n245\n00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,760\nthis force is just up and running.\n\n246\n00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,670\nWe're ready to join clients to it,\nadd other domains, whatever we need.\n\n247\n00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,950\nSo, pretty straightforward, there.\n\n248\n00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,050\nReally just that one power shell\ncommand; it does the install.\n\n249\n00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,790\nSo if you're automating\n\n250\n00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,315\nthe deployment of something like this,\n>> You can.\n\n251\n00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:32,855\nNow most people don't\ncreate forests very often.\n\n252\n00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,145\nSo I'll admit this is not one\nyou automate very much but\n\n253\n00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:37,175\nthat doesn't stop Microsoft\nfrom putting it on the exam.\n\n254\n00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:37,995\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n255\n00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:40,641\n>> So you know it is out there,\nand we wanna be aware of it.\n\n256\n00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:43,539\nBut yeah, you can see all\nthe records right there all done.\n\n257\n00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:44,055\n>> Very good.\n\n258\n00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:48,505\n>> All right, well, in this segment we got\na chance to see how to create a brand new\n\n259\n00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:53,030\nActive Directory forest from the\nPowerShell, as straightforward as it was.\n\n260\n00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,020\nBut stay tuned,\ncause we have more segments coming up.\n\n261\n00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,070\nWe're going to show how to create\nnew domains inside of a forest,\n\n262\n00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,890\nas well as how to create additional\ndomain controllers in an existing domain.\n\n263\n00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,880\nBoth of which are also\npretty straightforward but\n\n264\n00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,330\nwe're going to continue on with\nthis Active Directory series, so\n\n265\n00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,730\nstay tuned for that.\n\n266\n00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,799\nThere's more PowerShell coming up.\n\n267\n00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:15,839\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:08,135\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:12,167\nIn this segment we're going to take\na look at adding a domain controller,\n\n3\n00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,390\nor actually adding a domain to a forest.\n\n4\n00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,680\nAnd when we add a domain to a forest\nthere's a few different forms it can take.\n\n5\n00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,980\nIt could be a child domain.\n\n6\n00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,720\nSo we've got a parent\ndomain like Itprotv.net and\n\n7\n00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,820\nwe want to create a child of it,\nlab.itprotv.net, or\n\n8\n00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,060\nit could be an entirely separate tree,\nsomething like entertainmentlive.com,\n\n9\n00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,490\na whole different DNS name\nspace on a separate tree.\n\n10\n00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,730\nBut, in both scenarios it's\nall in the same forest.\n\n11\n00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,220\nAnd the command that we use is\nactually the same there, too.\n\n12\n00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,000\nThere's really just\na little modifier we use.\n\n13\n00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,680\nThe command is smart enough to see\nthe domain we're using to determine\n\n14\n00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,860\nwhich type of a child\ndomain that we're adding.\n\n15\n00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,070\nSo the process is pretty straight forward.\n\n16\n00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,470\nThat's what we're gonna see right here!\n\n17\n00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,960\n>> All right, so\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n18\n00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,730\nWhat I've got, I've got a forest root,\n\n19\n00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,990\nwhich is actually www.itprotv.net\nis the one we used.\n\n20\n00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,224\nAnd, I can see here this is, I just wanna\nshow you guys that he's running DNS, so\n\n21\n00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:04,734\nit's a domain controller.\n\n22\n00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,910\nIt's my forest root domain controller for\nwww.itprotv.net.\n\n23\n00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,700\nHe's also running DNS, so\nhe has a zone for itprotv.net.\n\n24\n00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,490\nWhat we're going to do is I'm going\nto switch over to this other server.\n\n25\n00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,960\nAnd currently this server is\na member of a work group.\n\n26\n00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,780\nAnd I'm going to open up Powershell.\n\n27\n00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,275\nAnd I'm going to add this\nguy as a child domain.\n\n28\n00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,445\nAs we're gonna be creating\na second domain, and\n\n29\n00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:27,205\nmy forest is gonna be part\nof that second domain tree.\n\n30\n00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:30,675\nAnd the command for that, and this guy\nI've already installed the role, right?\n\n31\n00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:33,748\nThe role active directory domain\nservice has been installed.\n\n32\n00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:39,344\nThe next thing we're gonna do\nis configure it as a domain\n\n33\n00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:44,583\ncontroller, and from PowerShell,\nthe command for\n\n34\n00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:50,908\nthat is gonna be install,\n-ADDomain, sorry, ADDSDomain.\n\n35\n00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:51,610\nI always forget that DS in there.\n\n36\n00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n37\n00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,720\nactive directory domain service domain.\n\n38\n00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,060\nAnd then the parameters I'm gonna use with\nthis, first thing I've gotta do is I gotta\n\n39\n00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,480\nspecify what the name of this\nnew child domain is going to be.\n\n40\n00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,530\nAnd the parameter for\nthat is new domain name.\n\n41\n00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,395\nSo newdomainname.\n\n42\n00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:09,320\nAnd then we're gonna call this one lab.\n\n43\n00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,090\nNow you could type out\nthe fqtnlab.itprotv.net but\n\n44\n00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,970\nit knows that if it's\ngonna be a child domain,\n\n45\n00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,978\nit's gonna take that child domain name and\ntack it on to the parent name.\n\n46\n00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:24,010\nYou have specified who that\nparent domain name is, or\n\n47\n00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,840\nwhat that parent domain name is.\n\n48\n00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,200\nSo it knows what tree, you might have\nmore than one tree in your forest so\n\n49\n00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,940\nwhich tree are you adding this domain to?\n\n50\n00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,008\nIn our case, that's gonna be ITProTV.net.\n\n51\n00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:39,300\nAnd then I've got to have credentials,\nright?\n\n52\n00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,460\nWhat we did in the previous segment,\n\n53\n00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,500\nwhen we added that forest root there\nweren't any credentials required, right?\n\n54\n00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,520\nI was logged on as the administrator\non that local server and\n\n55\n00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,250\nI ran through the configuration\nof that active directory there.\n\n56\n00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,090\nNow when you come and\n\n57\n00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,180\nadd a child domain, you're adding\nit to an existing network, right?\n\n58\n00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,770\nTo an existing forest, so you're gonna\nhave to have permissions within that\n\n59\n00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,590\nforest to create that child domain.\n\n60\n00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,680\nAnd for security purposes I'm gonna type\nin the parameter is just -prudential.\n\n61\n00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,670\nAnd you could specify the user account\nthat you wanted to use to perform this\n\n62\n00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,760\nprocess, right, and\naccount in that forest root.\n\n63\n00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,740\nFor security, though,\nI'm going to do a Get-Credential.\n\n64\n00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,590\nAnd what that's gonna do, is instead of\nme typing it in line where somebody can\n\n65\n00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,260\nsee what I was typing, or having it in a\nscript, where somebody could open up that\n\n66\n00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,950\nscript, try to edit it, and\nsee those credentials that I used.\n\n67\n00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,710\nThis way it's going to prompt me as I run\nthat command to type in those credentials.\n\n68\n00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,330\nAnd that's really all\nI need at this point.\n\n69\n00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,770\nThat'd be the required parameters.\n\n70\n00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,680\nI'm gonna add a couple more.\n\n71\n00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,815\nI wanna do an install-DNS so we can have\nDNS on this child domain controller.\n\n72\n00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:50,585\nAnd I'm also gonna go ahead and\ncreate a DNS delegation.\n\n73\n00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:55,277\nThat way it'll go ahead and it'll go up\nto that forest root, it'll go to that DNS\n\n74\n00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:59,279\nserver, and delegate authority for\nthat portion of the name space,\n\n75\n00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:02,946\nlab.itprotv.net to the DNS\nserver that I'm creating here.\n\n76\n00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:05,858\nAnd that's just going to save me\ntime from having to go back and\n\n77\n00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,660\ndo that as an extra step in the future.\n\n78\n00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,771\nSo we'll create that DNS delegation.\n\n79\n00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:14,440\nAs we saw in some previous segments,\nI could go through, and I could,\n\n80\n00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,425\na change where the database in being\ninstalled and the log files and sys log,\n\n81\n00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,640\nI'm just going to skip that here.\n\n82\n00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,660\nI'm also gonna skip the prechecks.\n\n83\n00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,360\nIn the real world you would obviously want\nto go through those pre-req checks to make\n\n84\n00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,035\nsure the server had everything you needed,\nthat to be a functional domain controller.\n\n85\n00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:34,955\nTo speed things up here I'm just gonna\ngo ahead and say SkipPreChecks, and\n\n86\n00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:36,015\ndouble check.\n\n87\n00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:40,425\nOne other parameter I'm not gonna use,\nbut we could do a DomainType, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:45,880\nNow, DomainType, cuz if I'm adding\nan additional domain to a forest I could\n\n89\n00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,760\nbe adding, as Don says, as an additional\ndomain in that tree, like a child domain.\n\n90\n00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,400\nI could also be making a new tree,\nlike he said, EdutainmentLive.\n\n91\n00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,740\nIn which case, I would just specify\ntree domain instead of child.\n\n92\n00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,670\nI could do tree domain,\nI could also do child domain.\n\n93\n00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,640\nAnd if I don't specify anything, it's\ngonna assume or default to child domain.\n\n94\n00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,679\nWe'll go ahead and run that.\n\n95\n00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,654\nAnd it's gonna ask me what\ncredentials am I gonna use to add\n\n96\n00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:20,246\nthis domain to the forest and\nthat's gonna be ITProTv.\n\n97\n00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:24,870\nUse my administrator account and\nour super secret password.\n\n98\n00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,560\nAnd then it needs me to set the DSRM.\n\n99\n00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,480\nRight, my directory service\nrestore mode password.\n\n100\n00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,530\nI could specify that parameter in\nthe command itself, but again for\n\n101\n00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,410\nsecurity reasons, so I don't want to type\nit inline, I'm gonna let it prompt me.\n\n102\n00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,400\nAnd you'll see it puts\nthe little asterisks up there so\n\n103\n00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,090\nnobody can shoulder surf that password.\n\n104\n00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:46,270\nAll right, then I'll say yes to\nmake this guy a domain controller.\n\n105\n00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,970\nAnd now it's gonna go through the process.\n\n106\n00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,430\nI'm gonna to get the same warnings I\nwould get if I'm doing this in the GUI,\n\n107\n00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,340\nbecause 2012 R2 has some security settings\nthat are not gonna allow me to have some\n\n108\n00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,240\nof my older domain controllers present.\n\n109\n00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,710\nAnd that should be the only one I\nget because it's going to be able to\n\n110\n00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,180\ncreate that delegation up\nthere with the force group.\n\n111\n00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,870\n>> And now it's going to take a moment to\nrun because of what it's got to do, and\n\n112\n00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,840\nthis is actually a little more involved\nthan the one that created forest.\n\n113\n00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,480\nWhen we created a forest, an empty copy\nof the active directory was copied,\n\n114\n00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,610\nnot emptied, but\na template copy was put in place.\n\n115\n00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,560\nBut here, it's actually gotta reach\nout to the infrastructure master, and\n\n116\n00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,380\nthe domain mastery and\nclear the name that we chose,\n\n117\n00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,450\ncopy down some of the configuration\npreditions, that kind of stuff.\n\n118\n00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,620\nAnd, that can make this\ntake a little bit longer.\n\n119\n00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,670\nWhen it's done,\nthe system will need to reboot.\n\n120\n00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,200\nAnd so there's not a whole lot of\npoint in us sitting here watching\n\n121\n00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,880\nthat as it happens.\n\n122\n00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,490\nYou can see it's starting\nto churn along there.\n\n123\n00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,910\nWhy don't we do this,\nwhy don't we take a quick pause here.\n\n124\n00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,020\nWe'll let it run and\nthen it's gonna reboot.\n\n125\n00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,380\nAnd as soon as it's done rebooting,\nwe'll pick back up and\n\n126\n00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,050\nwe'll verify that our\ndomain has been created.\n\n127\n00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,569\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n128\n00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:56,514\n[MUSIC]\n\n129\n00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:02,910\nAll right, so our server's rebooted and\nnow we're ready to rock.\n\n130\n00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,150\nRight, Mike let's take\na look at what happened.\n\n131\n00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,690\n>> We should be good to go.\n\n132\n00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,760\nLet's see the results here.\n\n133\n00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,180\nSo the server rebooted,\nI'm gonna log back in.\n\n134\n00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,980\nI can see there's my domain name LAB.\n\n135\n00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,612\nI'll log in as that good\nold administrator account.\n\n136\n00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:18,630\nAnd wait for this guy to load up.\n\n137\n00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,630\nGive server manager a chance to fire\nup and collect all its information.\n\n138\n00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,718\nAnd in fact,\nwhile I'm waiting we'll come back and\n\n139\n00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:27,260\nverify server two is indeed\na domain controller.\n\n140\n00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,298\nWhile I'm waiting for server manager\nto load up, though, let's switch\n\n141\n00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:37,578\nback over to the forest root, and\nin my DNS console, I'll refresh this guy,\n\n142\n00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:42,860\nand here I can see where this guy is the\ndomain controller for IT PRO TV dot net,\n\n143\n00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,979\nand he's got his own ITPROTV.net, and now\nI have a delegation for lab.ITproTV.net.\n\n144\n00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:51,553\nSo that's pointing over\nthere to server two,\n\n145\n00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:55,610\nwho is that new domain controller\nwe just set up for lab.ITproTV.net.\n\n146\n00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,800\nSo that worked great.\n\n147\n00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,550\nThat create DNS delegation.\n\n148\n00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,820\nFlip back over to server two,\nwho is our new domain controller.\n\n149\n00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,390\nServer manager still gathering\nup all of its information.\n\n150\n00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,970\nThere it goes.\n\n151\n00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,140\nAnd that is the active directory\nin DNS listed over here.\n\n152\n00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,470\nI flip over to my DNS console,\nif it'll let me.\n\n153\n00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,850\nThe server managers,\n\n154\n00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,090\nyou've gotta wait until it's done\ncollecting this information.\n\n155\n00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,670\nIf you try to go before that,\nit just gets all angry.\n\n156\n00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,100\nAnd here we go, open up DNS.\n\n157\n00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,988\nAnd I should see that serve two\nis indeed a DNS server, and\n\n158\n00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:35,134\nhe's hosting his own for lab.itprotv.net.\n\n159\n00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:38,306\nI can see my records in there,\nI can see he has registered all of his\n\n160\n00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:41,290\ndomain controller records,\nKerberos held app.\n\n161\n00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,648\nI didn't make this guy a global catalog.\n\n162\n00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,980\nIt detected,\nlook like he's a global catalog,\n\n163\n00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,990\nbut I could always go back in sites and\nservices and do that.\n\n164\n00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,060\nSo there we see how we can use\npowershell to add that child demand.\n\n165\n00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,850\nIn fact, I could show you one more thing.\n\n166\n00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,225\nIf I pull up my active directory,\ndomains and trusts.\n\n167\n00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,864\n[NOISE] And we take a peek in here,\n\n168\n00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:10,023\nwe'll just verify that that trust\nrelationship got established, so\n\n169\n00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:14,689\nI'll expand that ITproTV.net,\nsure enough there's lab.ITproTV.net.\n\n170\n00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:18,686\nIf I pull up the properties for that guy\nand go over to the trust tab, I will see\n\n171\n00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:22,960\nthat it has trust with ITProTV.net and\nit is a parent child trust relationship.\n\n172\n00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,200\nSo there you have it,\nhow we can add a second domain or\n\n173\n00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,440\nan additional domain, it can be a second,\nthird or fourth domain to our force.\n\n174\n00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,270\nWe use that install dash\nADDS4s to do the first one.\n\n175\n00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,880\nThis one was the install-ADDS domain.\n\n176\n00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,450\nAnd I can do that again and again, right,\nif I wanted to add another child domain or\n\n177\n00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,740\na separate tree to that forest.\n\n178\n00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,590\n>> Yep,\nthat pretty much wraps that one up.\n\n179\n00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,380\nSo, there are a few other little examples\nwe'd like to do like bringing up a domain\n\n180\n00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,830\nin an active directory forest.\n\n181\n00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,360\nBut for right now, as far as bringing up\na child domain or a new one, that's it.\n\n182\n00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,130\nSo, I hope you guys enjoyed that.\n\n183\n00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,692\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more power shell coming up.\n\n184\n00:10:03,692 -->

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,070\nIn this segment, we're gonna take a look\nat creating additional domain controllers\n\n3\n00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,208\nin an existing domain.\n\n4\n00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:16,568\nAnd this is probably, of the various\nexamples that we've done so far,\n\n5\n00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:18,390\nthis is probably the most common.\n\n6\n00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,040\nRight?\n\n7\n00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,400\nPeople don't create new forest and\nnew domains everyday.\n\n8\n00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,370\nBut people do create new domain\ncontrollers all of the time for\n\n9\n00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,980\nexisting domains and forests.\n\n10\n00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,170\nYou'll see the process is actually\npretty straight forward, right Mike?\n\n11\n00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,925\n>> It really is.\n\n12\n00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:33,750\nA pretty straight forward command.\n\n13\n00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,380\nI've got a server here, we've already got\nour domain set up we've got ITProTV.net.\n\n14\n00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,272\nAnd what I've done is I've\nbrought up another server,\n\n15\n00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:43,580\nand I want to add a second\ndomain controller.\n\n16\n00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,980\nAs Don said, this is something you do\nmuch more regularly for fault tolerance,\n\n17\n00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,310\nfor deploying out to a new office,\nor something like that.\n\n18\n00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,290\nSo the command, once I've got that roll\ninstalled, if you've watched the previous\n\n19\n00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:00,200\nsegments, to create the domain,\nit was install-adds domain.\n\n20\n00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200\nOnce you've got the domain created,\nnow when you're adding another domain\n\n21\n00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,240\ncontroller, you're not creating\nanother domain, right?\n\n22\n00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,265\nYou're adding a domain controller to\nan existing domain if you think back\n\n23\n00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:09,230\nto your GUI.\n\n24\n00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,458\nSo the command, the noun,\nis slightly different.\n\n25\n00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:18,667\nIt's gonna be\ninstall-ADDSDomainController, right?\n\n26\n00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,750\nInstead of just ADDSDomain.\n\n27\n00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,780\nAnd then the parameters\nare pretty straightforward.\n\n28\n00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,400\nAs always, there's a whole bunch\nof parameters that you can use.\n\n29\n00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,880\nI'm gonna give you guys a link\nto Technet so you can go out and\n\n30\n00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,560\nsee some of those additional parameters.\n\n31\n00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,740\nBut if you just need a second or\nthird or fourth domain controller,\n\n32\n00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,130\nall you need to do is use the command\ninstall-ADDSDomainController.\n\n33\n00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,310\nI am going to put DNS on here.\n\n34\n00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,720\nSo I'll do a little install,\nor -installdns.\n\n35\n00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,520\nAnd then the name of the domain that\nI'm adding this domain controller to.\n\n36\n00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,990\nThe parameter is going to be domain name.\n\n37\n00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,635\nAnd the name of the domain I'm adding\nthis to is going to be ITProTV.net.\n\n38\n00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,460\nLet's see if I am going to,\nI'm logged onto this guy as local.\n\n39\n00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,440\nI probably am going to\nneed credentials for that.\n\n40\n00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,855\nLet's see what it says.\n\n41\n00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:13,290\n>> [LAUGH] Wait a minute.\n\n42\n00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,470\nYou need credentials to be able\nto promote a domain controller?\n\n43\n00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,390\nWhat's that all about?\n\n44\n00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,470\n>> I was trying to think if I\nset this guy as a, I guess.\n\n45\n00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,470\nSo let me add, all I'm gonna do is\nadd a credentials switch to this.\n\n46\n00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,520\nSo just like we did in our previous\nsegment, I'm gonna do a -credential.\n\n47\n00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,570\n>> Mike, your head's covering that up so\nwe can't see it all.\n\n48\n00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,945\n>> Sorry,\nlet's bring that up a little bit.\n\n49\n00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:32,885\nOr let's just clear that\nscreen a little bit.\n\n50\n00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:35,800\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nwe'll do that one more time.\n\n51\n00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,760\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take\nthat same command that I ran, and\n\n52\n00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,600\nI'm gonna add a -credential.\n\n53\n00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,520\nBecause this guy's not a member server,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,920\nHe's in a work group right now.\n\n55\n00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,120\nSo I'm logged on as a local admin\nwho's not gonna have any rights within\n\n56\n00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,470\nthe domain that I'm trying to add this to.\n\n57\n00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,180\nSo -credential and\nthen I'll do a get -credential\n\n58\n00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,770\nto have it prompt me for\nthose credentials, all right?\n\n59\n00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:09,050\nSo there we go, I'm going to\ngive it ITProTV\\administrator.\n\n60\n00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,208\nMake sure I spell that right.\n\n61\n00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:16,917\nAnd then my DSRM password, my\nDirectory Service Restore Mode password.\n\n62\n00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,312\nAnd there it goes, it's gonna run through\nthe process of creating that additional\n\n63\n00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,333\ndomain controller.\n\n64\n00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,805\nAnother switch, as I said,\nI'll give you guys a link to TechNet so\n\n65\n00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,495\nyou can go out and\nlook at all the parameters.\n\n66\n00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:35,370\nAnother one you might find useful\nin some situations, is there is a,\n\n67\n00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,810\noh gosh, if I can remember the actual\nwording of this parameter.\n\n68\n00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,840\nYou can actually skip\na lot of the initial,\n\n69\n00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,700\nit's called dash critical replication.\n\n70\n00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,370\nAnd what it'll do is, instead of\nreplicating the entire active directory\n\n71\n00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,030\ndatabase and getting it all set up before\nthe reboot, it'll just do the critical\n\n72\n00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,820\nreplication and go ahead and reboot and\nget that guy up and running.\n\n73\n00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,830\nAnd then it will replicate\nthe other noncritical information\n\n74\n00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,340\nas it has time in the background.\n\n75\n00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,120\nSo, it can kind of speed up the process,\nor\n\n76\n00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,679\nthe deployment, of new domain controllers.\n\n77\n00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,750\nWhile that guy's running,\n\n78\n00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,870\nwhat I was gonna show you next is\na read-only domain controller.\n\n79\n00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,360\nSo, that's the command for\n\n80\n00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,090\ninstalling an additional domain\ncontroller in an existing domain.\n\n81\n00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,563\nAnother thing that we can do from\nPowerShell is to create a read-only domain\n\n82\n00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:21,340\ncontroller.\n\n83\n00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,975\nThe command is actually the same\ncommandlet, so it's going to be\n\n84\n00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:30,980\ninstall-ADSDomainController, just\nlike we did just now.\n\n85\n00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,730\nThe difference is, we're gonna add\nthis -ReadOnlyReplica, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,125\nThat's going to indicate that it is\na Read Only Domain Controller, or an RODC.\n\n87\n00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,645\nYou could stop there.\n\n88\n00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:46,295\nThere's some other parameters\nyou can use if you're doing\n\n89\n00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:47,435\na Read Only Domain Controller.\n\n90\n00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:50,979\nLike, you might want to go ahead and set\nwho the delegated administrator account is\n\n91\n00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:54,080\ngoing to be, or what group is going\nto have administrator permissions.\n\n92\n00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,560\nRemember we've learned that with\nan RODC you actually have a local\n\n93\n00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,060\nadmins group that you can give\nsomebody permissions over.\n\n94\n00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,670\nAnother useful parameter you'll find for\n\n95\n00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,640\nRODCs is this\n-AllowPasswordReplicationAccountName.\n\n96\n00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,270\nRemember RODCs do not cache passwords or\nany passwords by default.\n\n97\n00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,620\nWe get to pick and choose whose passwords\nare cached out there on that RODC.\n\n98\n00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,070\nThis is how I can go ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,580\nspecify what user's passwords will\nbe allowed to be cached on that.\n\n100\n00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,130\nWhat I've done here is I've\nactually got an empty string.\n\n101\n00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,850\nI've got quote,\nquote with nothing in-between there.\n\n102\n00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,220\nThat's gonna ensure that that allow\npassword replication group list is blank.\n\n103\n00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,700\nThat there's nobody in there.\n\n104\n00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,670\nYou could also do\na -DenyPasswordReplecationAccountName,\n\n105\n00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,000\nwhich would let you set up the ones you\nwanted to insure were not replicated over\n\n106\n00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,400\nto that RODC, but the allow password\nreplication group is blank by default.\n\n107\n00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,440\nSo, I blanked it out anyway,\nbut it is blank by default.\n\n108\n00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,590\nThe denied RODC password\nreplication group is not blank.\n\n109\n00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,520\nThere is some key accounts in there that\nit already knows it's not supposed to\n\n110\n00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,510\nallow to be cached.\n\n111\n00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,560\nLike the domain admins,\nthe enterprise admins, scheme admins,\n\n112\n00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,460\nand things like that.\n\n113\n00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,640\nSo if I start that list in this parameter,\n\n114\n00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,250\nthen I would have to make\nsure I included all those.\n\n115\n00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,740\nBecause it would wipe it\nadd only what I added here.\n\n116\n00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,140\nSo typically you're not going to use\nthat parameter when you're running\n\n117\n00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,730\nthis command.\n\n118\n00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,000\nAlso if you had pre-created.\n\n119\n00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,682\nTypically we're going to pre-create\nthe read only domain controller account in\n\n120\n00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,000\nactive directory.\n\n121\n00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,780\nAnd if I have, then there's a command\ndash or a parameter -UseExistingAccount.\n\n122\n00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,340\nAnd that's gonna tell it to go look for\nthe account in active directory,\n\n123\n00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,610\nit's already there.\n\n124\n00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,430\nAnd to match up that physical server\nwith that account active directory.\n\n125\n00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,159\nSo just a few of those parameters we can\nuse if I'm trying to set up a read-only\n\n126\n00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,300\ndomain controller.\n\n127\n00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,960\nAgain, I've got links\nin the show notes here,\n\n128\n00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,560\nI'll make sure you have access to those.\n\n129\n00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,950\nSo that should have given\nserve two enough time.\n\n130\n00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,180\nLet's go back over there and\nsee what it's doing.\n\n131\n00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,840\nIt's in the process of\nrebooting as we speak.\n\n132\n00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,700\nSo we'll give this just\na second to pull up.\n\n133\n00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,920\nAnd what we should find is that I\nnow have a second domain controller,\n\n134\n00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,560\nin fact we could go over\nto serve one already.\n\n135\n00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,430\nAnd we could open up active directory.\n\n136\n00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,220\nAnd we should be able\nto see that account for\n\n137\n00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,340\nthat new domain controller\nthat we just created.\n\n138\n00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,780\nI'm gonna open up active\ndirectory users and computers,\n\n139\n00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,319\nbecause I'm old school and\nI don't like that.\n\n140\n00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,050\n[LAUGH].\n\n141\n00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,646\nAnd the active directory administrative\ncenter is the way we're supposed to\n\n142\n00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,148\ngo, but.\n\n143\n00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:23,124\nAnd there you can go, I can see that serve\ntwo is, indeed, a new domain controller,\n\n144\n00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:24,917\nI'm in that domain controller as OU.\n\n145\n00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:30,334\nSo I do now have a second domain\ncontroller for ITProTV.net.\n\n146\n00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,600\nWe'll flip back over.\n\n147\n00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,950\nServer one is still in\nthe process of connecting so,\n\n148\n00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,700\nwe'll give it a second there.\n\n149\n00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,310\n>> And like we said earlier,\nwe demonstrated in some of our earlier\n\n150\n00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,580\nsegments how to create new forests and\nhow create new domains.\n\n151\n00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,480\nBut those aren't things\nthat we do regularly.\n\n152\n00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,860\nAdding domain controllers like this is if\nyou're going to be adding a large number\n\n153\n00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,035\nof domain controllers to a domain,\nit's nice to be able to automate and\n\n154\n00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,672\nscript that and the PowerShell commands\ncome in really handy for that.\n\n155\n00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:58,260\n>> Absolutely yeah, this is definitely\none I'd want to write a script for,\n\n156\n00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,530\nmaybe set it up so it just prompted me for\n\n157\n00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,140\nthe name of the new domain controller or\nthe domain I was adding it to.\n\n158\n00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,190\nAnd everything else was already\ntyped out in that script.\n\n159\n00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,660\nSo I think, yeah, my nice black screen,\nlet me drop that down so\n\n160\n00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,520\nwe're just not looking at blackness there.\n\n161\n00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's taking a little while to reboot.\n\n162\n00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,260\nHe's getting everything set up.\n\n163\n00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,340\nHe's in applying, by default, the main\ncontroller policy, and things like that.\n\n164\n00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,680\nLogging in, setting up my profile for\n\n165\n00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,540\nthe first time since this is\nthe first time I logged onto here.\n\n166\n00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,390\nThere we go.\n\n167\n00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,395\nServer manager will open up in a minute,\nand\n\n168\n00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:34,570\nwe'll see that it's now a domain\ncontroller for ITProTV.net.\n\n169\n00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,690\n>> Yep, terribly, terribly exciting stuff.\n\n170\n00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,220\n>> I know, right?\n\n171\n00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,870\n>> The real power with this is that idea\nof the bulk deployment and when you're\n\n172\n00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,290\ndoing this with read only domain\ncontrollers, that's where I've seen it.\n\n173\n00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,430\nMaybe you work for a school system and you\nwanna place a read only domain controller\n\n174\n00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,250\nout at every location, so\nyou have 200 locations.\n\n175\n00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,680\nYou gonna be rolling out all these.\n\n176\n00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,400\nWell you don't wanna have to manually\nbuild 200 servers if you can avoid it.\n\n177\n00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,070\nSo you can just automate that, have them\ndeployed as a read only domain controller,\n\n178\n00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,710\nand off they go.\n\n179\n00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,650\nNow Mike's logging in here to verify.\n\n180\n00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,500\nYou don't actually have to log in to\nverify, we're just doing it to show it.\n\n181\n00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,920\nBut it's up, it's operational.\n\n182\n00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,870\nThe inter-site topology generator,\nISTG is kicking in and\n\n183\n00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,430\nbuilding the replication between this\ndomain controller and the existing ones.\n\n184\n00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,380\nAnd it's all automated.\n\n185\n00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,170\nMicrosoft has really made it easy,\nonce it's installed.\n\n186\n00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:19,880\n>> They really have.\n\n187\n00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,080\nAnd there, we can see active\ndirectory domain service listed.\n\n188\n00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,360\nIn fact, we want to go into sites and\nservices, and\n\n189\n00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,865\nverify what Don was just saying there.\n\n190\n00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:33,525\nWe can check and take a look at our\nreplication topology, that it's set up.\n\n191\n00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:34,795\n>> Here's hoping I'm right.\n\n192\n00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:35,320\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,207\n>> So here's serve two, for\n\n194\n00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:37,515\nexample.\n>> Don said it.\n\n195\n00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:40,095\n>> I can see that it has,\nwell it's thinking about it.\n\n196\n00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,720\nIt probably hasn't finished running yet.\n\n197\n00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,780\nThere I can see the one from the DC, or\nserve one is already set up, coming back\n\n198\n00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:52,090\nto serve two, serve two will eventually\nget one going back over to server one.\n\n199\n00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,760\nSo indeed it is taking over,\nwhere it's good to go.\n\n200\n00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,530\n>> Yeah, sometimes you have to be patient.\n\n201\n00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,980\nAnd if you don't read only domain\ncontroller, that replication is one way so\n\n202\n00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,768\nyou may not see both directions on it,\nbut in this case, we will.\n\n203\n00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,170\nIf we just, if we had more\npatience than we actually do.\n\n204\n00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,240\n>> And it's a separate\nPowerShell command if you want\n\n205\n00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,790\nto pre-create that read-only\ndomain controller account.\n\n206\n00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,550\nAnd I'll make sure I throw that command\nin the show notes, as well for you guys.\n\n207\n00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,190\nAll right, so in this segment we got\na chance to see how to create a domain\n\n208\n00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,560\ncontroller for an existing domain.\n\n209\n00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,400\nIt was a pretty easy process, bringing up\nand then the machine goes on from there.\n\n210\n00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,990\nPretty useful stuff.\n\n211\n00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,650\nAlright, well I hope you\nguys enjoyed the segment.\n\n212\n00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,572\nIf you want to learn more, stay tuned,\n\n213\n00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:31,917\nbecause we've got more\nPowerShell coming up.\n\n214\n00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:39,583\n[MUSIC]\n\n215\n00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,970\nAll right, we'll save those notes for\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,113\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:09,005\nIn this segment,\n\n3\n00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:13,760\nwe're gonna be taking a look at managing\norganizational units with the PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,940\nOrganizational units are a pretty key\npiece inside of the active directory.\n\n5\n00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,020\nBecause they're how we sort our various\nuser accounts, computer accounts,\n\n6\n00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,890\nand other items.\n\n7\n00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,490\nAnd if you're applying group policy\nobjects organizational units are kind of\n\n8\n00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,340\nthat key thing that defines\nwhere they're going to apply.\n\n9\n00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,680\nSo they're real important.\n\n10\n00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,130\nWell, most of us don't create\nthese on a daily basis but\n\n11\n00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,270\nif you're ever in a situation where you\nneed to create a large quantity of OU's.\n\n12\n00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,510\nIt is far easier to script it and\nautomate it from the PowerShell\n\n13\n00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,640\nthan it is to go to the GUI and\nmanually create OU after OU.\n\n14\n00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,910\nSo, that's what we're going\nto be taking a look at and\n\n15\n00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,370\nMike you've got some great\nexamples lined up for us, right?\n\n16\n00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,020\n>> I do, so\nlets take a look at my screen here.\n\n17\n00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,880\nThe first thing we're going to do is\nsimply create an organizational unit.\n\n18\n00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,030\nAnd the command is pretty straight forward\nits just new-ad organizational unit.\n\n19\n00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,240\nAs with most of our PowerShell commands,\nthere's several parameters we can use,\n\n20\n00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,840\nmost of them optional.\n\n21\n00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,360\nIn fact, the only required parameter\n\n22\n00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,480\nis going to be the name that you want\nto give that organizational unit.\n\n23\n00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,100\nSo if I just do new-AD organizational unit\nand then the name test and hit enter.\n\n24\n00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,680\nYou see I don't get any red text back and\n\n25\n00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,320\nif I flip back over to active\ndirectory and refresh that console.\n\n26\n00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,050\nThere is my new organizational\nunit called test.\n\n27\n00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,245\nAll right, so very simple.\n\n28\n00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:27,840\nNew-AD organizational unit and\nthen the name of the OU.\n\n29\n00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,230\nLet's take it a step further, though.\n\n30\n00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,370\nLet's do a new-AD organizational unit.\n\n31\n00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,150\nAnd for the first one I'm\ngoing to kind of copy that.\n\n32\n00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,290\nI want to make one called user accounts.\n\n33\n00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,700\nThe parameter,\n\n34\n00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,450\nyou'll notice on the previous example\nI didn't specify any parameters.\n\n35\n00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,910\nI just put the word test.\n\n36\n00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,960\nIt assumes it's the only\nrequired parameter.\n\n37\n00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,780\nIt's a positional parameter,\nI don't need anything else.\n\n38\n00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,590\nBut I could do a -name, and then the name\nI wanted to give the organizational unit.\n\n39\n00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,090\nLike user accounts for example.\n\n40\n00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,360\nAgain, I go back in and\nlook at active directory and\n\n41\n00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,080\nI'll see that at the root, I should\nhave a new OU called user accounts.\n\n42\n00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,890\nThat works well because I\ndidn't provide the path,\n\n43\n00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,380\nI didn't tell it where in active directory\nI wanted to make the organizational unit.\n\n44\n00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,230\nSo it just had to assume\nthat the root of my domain.\n\n45\n00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,050\nBut, if we want to start nesting OUs,\n\n46\n00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,390\nget a little fancy, we're going to\nchange this up just a little bit.\n\n47\n00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,570\nI'm going to create one called employees.\n\n48\n00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,720\nAnd I want to make it inside\nthat user accounts OU.\n\n49\n00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,840\nSo, all I'm going to do is I'm going\nto add a -path parameter and then\n\n50\n00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,390\nthe distinguished name, or the location,\nof where I want to create the OU.\n\n51\n00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,463\nSo in this case, I want to make it inside\nthat other OU called user accounts.\n\n52\n00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,938\nAnd then as with most of our\ndistinguished names, OU=useraccounts,\n\n53\n00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,879\nand then all of my domain components.\n\n54\n00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,343\nSo dc=itprotv, dc=net,\n\n55\n00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:58,682\nif I make sure I type that in there right.\n\n56\n00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:00,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> DC=net, and\n\n57\n00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,450\nmy quote,\nI should be able to enter no red text.\n\n58\n00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,665\nWe flip back over to active directory and\ndo a little refresh.\n\n59\n00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:12,335\nAnd now inside user accounts I\nhave a nested OU called employees.\n\n60\n00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,365\nAnd that's typically what we're doing,\nright?\n\n61\n00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:19,115\nWe're organizing my objects so that I\ncan delegate administrative control and\n\n62\n00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,100\nscope my group policies.\n\n63\n00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,170\nSo we're nesting our OU's according\nto whatever our business model is.\n\n64\n00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,290\nBut once you get them created,\nagain there's a lot of other parameters.\n\n65\n00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,560\nI've got a link in the show notes that I\ngive you to Tech Net that will give you\n\n66\n00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,670\na bunch of additional parameters\nthat you can set on there.\n\n67\n00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,730\nOther things we might wanna do.\n\n68\n00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,780\nOnce we've got those OUs created,\nwe might want go back and\n\n69\n00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,340\nmodify an organizational unit.\n\n70\n00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,260\nSo one example of that might\nbe adding a description.\n\n71\n00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,630\nAnd the command, remember,\nare new creates.\n\n72\n00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,810\nWe switch that verb and\n\n73\n00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,230\nwe change it to a set instead of new,\nnow we're modifying an existing object.\n\n74\n00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,440\nSo it's just gonna be\nset-ad organizational unit.\n\n75\n00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,860\nAnd then the parameter\nthat you want to modify.\n\n76\n00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,130\nI might do a -description or\nsomething like that.\n\n77\n00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,820\nAnd maybe we put default.\n\n78\n00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,470\nOh, let me take that back.\n\n79\n00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,020\nOne second,\n\n80\n00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,240\nI do have to tell it that I'm not creating\none, I'm modifying an existing one.\n\n81\n00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,770\nSo I really need to tell it which\nobject I'm going to be modifying.\n\n82\n00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,770\nInstead of a -name,\nit's actually a dash identity parameter.\n\n83\n00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:36,280\nSo a little bit different, if I modify\nthat, let's do the ou=useraccounts\n\n84\n00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:42,813\ndc=itprotv, dc=, what are we doing,\n.net in this one, so\n\n85\n00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:48,710\nthere's the distinguished name for\nthe object that I'm trying to modify.\n\n86\n00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,930\nAnd then the parameter I want\nto modify is description, and\n\n87\n00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,419\nI'm just going to put the default OU for\n\n88\n00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:03,560\nuser accounts and my quote.\n\n89\n00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,730\nHit enter.\n\n90\n00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,770\nAnd if we want to go back and\ntake a look at that,\n\n91\n00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,530\nI should be able to pull\nup the properties for that.\n\n92\n00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,047\nLet's just do a little refresh here.\n\n93\n00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:16,760\nAnd it didn't seem to set my description,\ninteresting.\n\n94\n00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,410\nAll right so\nthat's how I modify those guys.\n\n95\n00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,380\nI might have to find out why it\ndidn't set that description properly.\n\n96\n00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,730\nThere's my description.\n\n97\n00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,765\nIt's just not showing on my screen\nout here, normally it would,\n\n98\n00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,380\nwe'll figure that out later.\n\n99\n00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,670\nSo that's how you go back and modify.\n\n100\n00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,190\nAll you're doing is\na set-adorganizationunit.\n\n101\n00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,980\nThe identity of the OU that\nyou're trying to modify,\n\n102\n00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,510\nand then the particular parameter\nthat you're trying change.\n\n103\n00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,450\nSo there's create an OU,\nmodify an existing OU.\n\n104\n00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,249\nThe only thing that really leaves us\nis removing an organizational unit.\n\n105\n00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,620\nSo let's take a look.\n\n106\n00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,150\nLet me flip back over to\nactive directory real quick.\n\n107\n00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,970\nAnd I've got an OU called test that\nwe created in the very beginning.\n\n108\n00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,930\nNow if I want to delete that.\n\n109\n00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,710\nAll right, if we want to remove it,\n\n110\n00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,660\nthe command is just gonna be\nremove -ad organizational unit.\n\n111\n00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,790\nSome of you might know\nwhere I'm going with this.\n\n112\n00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,442\nLet's see if you catch on, remove-ad\n\n113\n00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:17,990\norganizational unit, and then the name\nof the OU that I want to remove.\n\n114\n00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,010\nReally need the distinguish name\njust cuz it's at the root so\n\n115\n00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,150\nit should be okay if we're\njust using the name.\n\n116\n00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,110\nSo you're going to work on,\nwhat do you think?\n\n117\n00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,410\n>> Well, you know,\nit's like you always say.\n\n118\n00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,085\nRemember what happens in\nthe graphical user interface, right?\n\n119\n00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:30,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you try and\n\n120\n00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,450\ndelete an OU,\never since Windows Server 2003,\n\n121\n00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,570\nthere's a little feature in there\nthat's going to stop that from working.\n\n122\n00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,560\n>> Exactly.\n\n123\n00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,670\nAnd just to show you guys, I'm going\nto use the distinguished name and\n\n124\n00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,110\nmake sure that's not why\nwe're getting the error.\n\n125\n00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:51,109\nLet's do a remove-ad\norganizational unit OU = test,\n\n126\n00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:56,563\ndc equals IT Pro TV, dc= equals net.\n\n127\n00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:01,255\nIt says yes I want to remove it,\nI hit a Y.\n\n128\n00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:05,135\nAnd you'll notice I get access is denied.\n\n129\n00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:08,055\nSo what Don is referring to remember\n\n130\n00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:11,750\nnow from when we created a new\norganizational unit by default.\n\n131\n00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,000\nThe protect from accidental\ndeletion check mark is checked.\n\n132\n00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,160\nIf we go back over to active directory and\n\n133\n00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,820\nI pull up the properties of test and\nI've already turned on my advanced view.\n\n134\n00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,250\nRemember you don't get to\nsee that object tab if\n\n135\n00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,340\nyou don't have your advanced view\nturned on in active directory.\n\n136\n00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,410\nAnd there I can see,\nprotect object from accidental deletion.\n\n137\n00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,890\n>> It's a funny feature because it's not\nreally protecting you from deletion so\n\n138\n00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,100\nmuch as it is accidentally dragging and\ndropping this to another location.\n\n139\n00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,060\nSo that was a real problem in the GUI.\n\n140\n00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,840\nFrom the PowerShell, it's not a problem\nbut the feature still applies.\n\n141\n00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,550\nWe've gotta remember to disable\nthat before we move forward.\n\n142\n00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,610\n>> Exactly.\n\n143\n00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,560\nSo all we're gonna do,\n\n144\n00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,360\nnow I could have unchecked that\nright there in the GUI, right, but.\n\n145\n00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,960\n>> That's cheating.\n\n146\n00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,770\n>> This is a PowerShell show,\nso let's not do that.\n\n147\n00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,880\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna use my set command.\n\n148\n00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,130\nSo, just like I did before,\nwe're doing a set-adorganizationalunit.\n\n149\n00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,220\nAnd then the name of the OU\nthat I'm trying to modify.\n\n150\n00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,690\nAnd then the parameter's\njust going to be a dash, and\n\n151\n00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,320\nthis is a long one,\nProtectFromAccidentalDeletion.\n\n152\n00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,915\nProtectFromAccidentalDeletion, thank\nGod for tab autofill.\n\n153\n00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n154\n00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,740\nI'm just gonna set that to a $false and\nhit enter.\n\n155\n00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,770\nAnd so what that should do is that's\nbasically clearing that check mark in\n\n156\n00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,840\nthe GUI, same thing if I went in there.\n\n157\n00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,830\nNow, if I go and\ndo another remove organizational unit.\n\n158\n00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,770\nAnd I hit a Y for yes, we get no red text.\n\n159\n00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,570\nIf I flip back to overactive directory and\n\n160\n00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,458\nrefresh my screen we should\nsee that that test OU is gone.\n\n161\n00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:50,040\nAnd that's it, so it's out of there.\n\n162\n00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,520\nYou get that one chance you can hit Y for\nyes, and that's all you get.\n\n163\n00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,040\n>> And a great of where I've\nused this in the past was.\n\n164\n00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,920\nI worked for an organization where you had\nbranch offices, over 110 branch offices.\n\n165\n00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,190\nAnd every branch office had a number.\n\n166\n00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,780\nSo it was branch number 1,\n\n167\n00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,890\nall the way through branch number 110, and\nwe needed to create OUs for each branch.\n\n168\n00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,640\nAnd so, I just whipped up a quick\nlittle PowerShell script and\n\n169\n00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,810\nsaid, create an OU that\nwas named branch 001.\n\n170\n00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,580\nAnd then, add one to that, and\ncreate branch 002, and add one to that and\n\n171\n00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,600\ncreate branch 003; it was just\na little loop that went 110 times.\n\n172\n00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,190\nQuickly and easily created 110 OUs,\nall named for the various branches.\n\n173\n00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,220\nI didn't have to do it by hand.\n\n174\n00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,970\nThat's the kind of thing that you can do,\n\n175\n00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,920\nwhen you're creating this\nstuff from the PowerShell.\n\n176\n00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,060\nSo, managing OUs, pretty straightforward.\n\n177\n00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,200\nSo in this segment, we got a chance\nto see how to create, modify and\n\n178\n00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,630\nultimately remove,\nOUs from the PowerShell prompt, right?\n\n179\n00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,780\nSo excellent stuff there,\ndefinitely something to take advantage of.\n\n180\n00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,210\nHope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n181\n00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,363\nStay tuned,\nwe’ve got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n182\n00:09:57,363 -->

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:08,500\n[MUSIC].\n\n2\n00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,922\nIn this segment, we're gonna\nlook at managing user account in\n\n3\n00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:16,391\nthe direct directory via Power Shell cuz\nwe already have our local user accounts.\n\n4\n00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,060\nWe're not gonna mess with those but\non the active directory side, we have use\n\n5\n00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,672\naccounts, which are put inside of OUs and\nthey have to have group statute and\n\n6\n00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:27,810\nall this other stuff but before we even\nget that far, we've got to get created.\n\n7\n00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,890\nSo we're gonna take a look at that\nprocess of creating user accounts and\n\n8\n00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,470\nmanipulating their data,\nall via the Power Shell.\n\n9\n00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,961\nAll right, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:35,941\nWhat have you got for us today?\n\n11\n00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,061\n>> Well, let's take a look.\n\n12\n00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:40,610\nWith these commands,\nthe command is going to be new-aduser.\n\n13\n00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,550\nSo pretty straightforward, your new verb,\nyour noun is going to be aduser.\n\n14\n00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,641\nAnd at it's simplest form,\nit's new-aduser.\n\n15\n00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:52,380\nIt helps to put a dash in there.\n\n16\n00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,380\nNew-aduser, and then you could just\ngive it a name like I did here.\n\n17\n00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,620\nAnd at this point, I have a new user\naccount, hopefully, called Nate.\n\n18\n00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,440\nWe'll go in here and\nrefresh Active Directory.\n\n19\n00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,201\nAnd we'll take a look\ninside my Users container.\n\n20\n00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:09,241\nAnd sure enough,\nthere is a user named Nate.\n\n21\n00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,486\nNow if you can see I know this is\nvery small on the screen there, but\n\n22\n00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:16,321\nif you look really closely at that icon;\nyou'll notice that that account for\n\n23\n00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,690\nNate is disabled, right?\n\n24\n00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,390\nI didn't set any parameters\nwhen I ran that command,\n\n25\n00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,360\nI gave it the one required command\nto create that new user account.\n\n26\n00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,192\nAnd that was the name of the account.\n\n27\n00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:31,610\nSo [INAUDIBLE] there are several different\nparameters I can throw in there, in fact\n\n28\n00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,460\nI'll give you guys the link to the notes\nout there and some technical commands.\n\n29\n00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,160\nMany, many different parameters\nI can throw in there.\n\n30\n00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,605\nLet's take a look at a couple of those,\nbecause normally we're going to want\n\n31\n00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:45,640\nto set a few more than that at least,\nyou know, we want to enable it.\n\n32\n00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,713\nAnd you guys remember with server\n2012 R2 if you create an account and\n\n33\n00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:53,710\nyou do not set the password,\nthe account is going to be disabled.\n\n34\n00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,330\nSo we might wanna try to set that\npassword in our command, and\n\n35\n00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,430\nwe might want to also enable it.\n\n36\n00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,160\nJust because you set the password doesn't\nmean it's automatically be enabled.\n\n37\n00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,600\nYou'd have to set the password and\nenable the account, but if you don't set\n\n38\n00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,070\nthe password Active Directory will\nnot let you enable that account.\n\n39\n00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,520\nSo, let's try another one, I'm gonna do\na little bit longer command this time.\n\n40\n00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,140\nWe're gonna do New-ADUser.\n\n41\n00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,075\nAnd I'm gonna do a- Name and\nthen I'll give it a name.\n\n42\n00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:22,575\nWe'll call this one Ronnie Wong.\n\n43\n00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:25,955\nAnd then I'll throw in a few more.\n\n44\n00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:30,095\nAnd like I said, there are several like\ngiven name would be like his first name.\n\n45\n00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:35,271\nWe can do his last name which is\ngonna be a- Surname parameter.\n\n46\n00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:42,433\nAnd then some more important ones that\nwe typically want to set would be like\n\n47\n00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,131\nthe user principal name, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:48,659\nSo we'll do a user principal name and\n\n49\n00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:54,071\nwe'll call that rwong.@itprotv.net.\n\n50\n00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:58,611\nAnd let's also do that SAMACCOUNTNAME,\nthat pre-Windows 2000 logon name.\n\n51\n00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,491\nAnd we'll do rwong.\n\n52\n00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:05,720\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo an enable, so a -enabled.\n\n53\n00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,440\nI'm gonna set that to a true or 1.\n\n54\n00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,420\nYou can actually do either one,\n$true or a 1.\n\n55\n00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,440\nAnd then the key here is to make sure I\nset the password otherwise I won't be\n\n56\n00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,610\nable to enable it.\n\n57\n00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,280\nAnd we're gonna use the AccountPassword\nparameter, -AccountPassword.\n\n58\n00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,202\nAnd then there's a couple\ndifferent ways you can do this.\n\n59\n00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:26,840\nYou can provide the password in line,\nor you can prompt, and\n\n60\n00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,220\nit really depends on what you're trying\nto do, if I was automating this,\n\n61\n00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,490\nrunning through a script,\nI might want to go ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,470\nset the parameter in the command,\nor the password in the command, and\n\n63\n00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,575\nthen I can go but have them change\ntheir password their next log on.\n\n64\n00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:42,230\nAnd I'm creating a single account,\nI might want to just go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,490\nhave it prompt me right here\nwhich is what I'm going to do for\n\n66\n00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,840\nthis particular example,\njust so you can see that option.\n\n67\n00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,220\nIt's just a Read-Host, and\nthen as secure string and\n\n68\n00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,040\nthat's going to cause it to put those\nlittle asterisks out there to hide what\n\n69\n00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,900\nI'm typing in case somebody is shoulder\nsurfing, looking over my shoulder.\n\n70\n00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,880\nAnd then I'm gonna set\nthe prompt to just say Password.\n\n71\n00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,820\nAnd I will end that guy with a little\nclose parentheses and hit enter.\n\n72\n00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,695\n>> Your spelling doesn't really matter\non Password, it's just a prompt there.\n\n73\n00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:19,440\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nyou can see my prompt now says Passoword.\n\n74\n00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,270\nSo you know, and then I'll go ahead and\nset his password.\n\n75\n00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,760\nNotice it's not showing you what\nI'm typing for that password.\n\n76\n00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,460\n>> And this one's extra secure, because if\nanybody's shoulder surfing, they just see\n\n77\n00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,750\nthe stars, and they don't think it's\na password because it's spelled wrong.\n\n78\n00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,320\nSo it's an extra level.\n\n79\n00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,630\n>> You know,\nI like many layers of security.\n\n80\n00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,840\nIt's an important part of security\nin our network environment.\n\n81\n00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,830\nSo if I flip back over here to\nactive directory I did specify\n\n82\n00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,160\nthe path of where I wanted to\ncreate that user account so\n\n83\n00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,140\nit should have just gone\ninto my User's container.\n\n84\n00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,510\nAnd sure enough there is Ronnie Wong.\n\n85\n00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,300\nAnd you'll notice from that\nlittle icon that it is enabled.\n\n86\n00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,500\nSo the account is ready to go.\n\n87\n00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,600\nHe could sign on with it at this point.\n\n88\n00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,170\nGot a first name and last name,\nwe also set that SAMACCOUNTNAME.\n\n89\n00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,950\nAnd what else; and\nwe set the password for that guy.\n\n90\n00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,661\nSo, there is creating,\nexcuse me close that.\n\n91\n00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:12,210\nThere's our creating a user\naccount from active directory.\n\n92\n00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,650\nNow once you've got these guys created,\ntypically, you don't wanna stop there.\n\n93\n00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,350\nWe're gonna have to go back occasionally,\nand\n\n94\n00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,990\nmake changes to some of\nthese user accounts.\n\n95\n00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,070\nAnd all we do is swap out the verb, right?\n\n96\n00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,640\nJust like everything else\nwe've done with PowerShell.\n\n97\n00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,600\nNew is, typically, my create verb.\n\n98\n00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,890\nSet is going to be my modifier,\nmy right verb.\n\n99\n00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,870\nSo we're just gonna change that verb,\nSet-ADUser.\n\n100\n00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,640\nAnd then depending on what I want to\nchange and who I want to modify, for\n\n101\n00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,270\nthis one, instead of a -name,\nit's a -name you create but,\n\n102\n00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,596\nwhen you're trying to modify something\nthey want you to do a -Identity, so\n\n103\n00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:52,710\n-Identity, and there's several ways\nyou can refer to a user account.\n\n104\n00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,500\nSome parameter, some of these\ncommandlets are very specific,\n\n105\n00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,120\nyou can only use the distinguished name or\nthe GUID.\n\n106\n00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,750\nOthers are a little more flexible and\n\n107\n00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,190\nthey'll let you use like\nthe SAMACCOUNTNAME and things like that.\n\n108\n00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,340\nAnd this is one of those, so\nI can just do an rwong and\n\n109\n00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,620\nit's gonna know what I'm referring to,\nand then what parameter do I wanna set.\n\n110\n00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,334\nMaybe I wanna set his manager\n\n111\n00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:21,876\nto Don Pezet and hit Enter.\n\n112\n00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:27,750\nAnd -manager could not be resolved,\nthat's nice.\n\n113\n00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,741\nWell let's just set his description.\n\n114\n00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:33,523\nSome of these parameters, what you're\ngonna find is, you can't set them,\n\n115\n00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:36,110\ndepending on the command you're using.\n\n116\n00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,409\nWe'll just call this guy, host.\n\n117\n00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,130\nI'll explain what I mean here in a second.\n\n118\n00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,670\nSo that should set that description.\n\n119\n00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,650\nI've got a link in the show notes for you.\n\n120\n00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,190\nWhat you'll find is some of these\nparameters you can set during\n\n121\n00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,810\nthe creation command but you can't set\nthem the same way during the set user.\n\n122\n00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,340\nYou have to actually do\na dash other attributes, and\n\n123\n00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,450\nthen make like a little block and\nfill those attributes in.\n\n124\n00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,130\nSo some of them you can set inline, some\nof them you're going to have to go and\n\n125\n00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,920\ndo a dash other parameters.\n\n126\n00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,260\nIt's on that link that I'll\ngive you in the show notes but\n\n127\n00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,320\nthere you see I've\nmodified Ronnie's account.\n\n128\n00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,870\nI set his description as a host.\n\n129\n00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,670\nAnd then the last thing we might need to\nbe able to do with power shell to manage\n\n130\n00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,810\nour user accounts is gonna be remove one.\n\n131\n00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,540\nAll right.\n\n132\n00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,010\nAt the end of it's lifetime,\n\n133\n00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,480\nif you no longer need that account, I need\nto remove it from from active directory,\n\n134\n00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,190\nit might have been some test accounts,\nmight have been an account.\n\n135\n00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,520\nI don't know about you, Don, I don't\nlike deleting user accounts that often.\n\n136\n00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,725\n>> I usually disable.\n\n137\n00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:38,310\n>> Disable them or move them into an OU,\nand maybe a year from now, delete it if I\n\n138\n00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,700\nneed to but it's a straightforward\ncommand, just Remove-ADUser.\n\n139\n00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,960\nAnd then the identity, and I'll go and\n\n140\n00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,930\nfind that Nate account that I created and\nyes to remove it.\n\n141\n00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,660\nAnd it should be gone.\n\n142\n00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,570\nIf we flip back over to active directory\nand I refresh, we can see there it is.\n\n143\n00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,570\nI do a little refresh, and\nNate's account is now gone.\n\n144\n00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,370\nSo there's working with my user accounts,\nwe saw that we could\n\n145\n00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,290\ncreate the user account, modify that,\nand then delete that guy.\n\n146\n00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,203\n>> So Mike, I was looking at where you\nwent to set the manager a moment ago and\n\n147\n00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:19,884\nI just was trying to debug it real quick\nand find out where it went wrong, and\n\n148\n00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:23,291\nthen I noticed it says cannot find\nan object with identity Don Pezet.\n\n149\n00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,151\nDo I have an account?\n\n150\n00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:26,591\n>> No, oh.\n\n151\n00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:30,865\n>> With manager, it's not, manager is just\none of those fields you can type whatever\n\n152\n00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:33,870\nthe heck you want in,\nit actually ties to another AD user.\n\n153\n00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,478\nSo it’s it's looking for me and\nI don't have an account, and so\n\n154\n00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:39,730\nthat's why it's doing that, but\notherwise you're syntactically correct.\n\n155\n00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,550\nThat's my big word of the day right there,\nsyntactically.\n\n156\n00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,679\n>> Syntactically, I like that,\n>> So yeah,\n\n157\n00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,885\njust set ADUser dash\nmanager on that one but\n\n158\n00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:51,065\nyou're exactly right, there are other\nones [INAUDIBLE] do the other object tag.\n\n159\n00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,025\nSuper annoying.\n\n160\n00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,856\n>> Yeah, like title I think is one\nof them that pops up in there.\n\n161\n00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:57,456\nI don't why they won't let you set\nthat straight from the command there.\n\n162\n00:08:57,456 --> 00:09:01,285\n>> Yeah, those are things we'll see\nevolve over time as power shell moves on.\n\n163\n00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:04,575\nBy the time we got power shell 10 it\nwill be a usable product [LAUGH] but\n\n164\n00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:08,000\nuntil then we have a little\nbit of grey area there.\n\n165\n00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,490\nAll right guys, well in this segment we\ngot a chance to see creating modifying and\n\n166\n00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,720\nremoving a user account\nall via the Power Shell.\n\n167\n00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,790\nNow stay tuned, because we've got\nan episode coming up on groups.\n\n168\n00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,580\nTypically when we create a user account,\nour very next step is to\n\n169\n00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,890\nput them in the necessary groups for\nthem to perform their job.\n\n170\n00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,871\nSo really that segment's going to\ngo hand in hand with this one.\n\n171\n00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:29,391\nYou definitely want to check that one out.\n\n172\n00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:32,760\nSo stay tuned, more Power Shell coming up.\n\n173\n00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:39,170\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,058\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:08,855\nIn this segment,\n\n3\n00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:12,450\nwe're gonna take a look at managing\ngroups inside of the PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,910\nWhen you create user accounts inside of\nthe AD, one of the next steps that you\n\n5\n00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,960\ntake is to assign permissions to them, and\nassigning permissions requires groups.\n\n6\n00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,650\nSo, definitely a key piece\ninside of our IT infrastructure.\n\n7\n00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,050\nAnd if we're trying to automate\nthe creation of user accounts,\n\n8\n00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,260\nthis is something that you'll\nwanna work into your script.\n\n9\n00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,860\nSo, let's take a look at it, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,850\n>> All right, let's take a peak here.\n\n11\n00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,650\nSo, as we continue on with these\ndifferent commands, same idea,\n\n12\n00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,860\nwe're just going to use a different noun,\nright.\n\n13\n00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,930\nWe've seen how to create users,\nwe've seen how to create OU's.\n\n14\n00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,710\nNow, we wanna create groups, we swap\nout the noun, we change it to ADGroup.\n\n15\n00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,085\nSo, let's start with a simple one,\nwe're just gonna do new-adGroup.\n\n16\n00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:50,435\nAnd then the parameters,\n\n17\n00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:54,745\nas always there's several parameters that\nwe can use with that ADGroup command.\n\n18\n00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:58,775\nI'll give you guys the notes, or the link\nto the notes in our show notes to show\n\n19\n00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:00,885\nyou some of the additional parameters.\n\n20\n00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:03,787\nI'm gonna give it a name,\nso I'm gonna specify name.\n\n21\n00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:09,670\nI'm just gonna call it HOSTS, if I can\nspell that, that's a tricky word to spell.\n\n22\n00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:17,420\nAnd then I'll do the SAMACCOUTNAME,\nand I'm gonna call that HOSTS as well.\n\n23\n00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,138\nAnd then, just like when you go through\nthe GUI, think about right-click,\n\n24\n00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:21,890\nnew group.\n\n25\n00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,130\nThere's really only a couple parameters\nyou have to specify, right, the name of\n\n26\n00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,530\nthe group, and then you've got your group\ncategory and your group scope or your\n\n27\n00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,230\ngroup type and your group scope depending\non which book you're reading there.\n\n28\n00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,010\nThe group category is gonna be,\nremember there's two options here.\n\n29\n00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,370\nI've got distribution.\n\n30\n00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,970\nAnd I've got security.\n\n31\n00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,960\nWe're gonna do a security group cuz I\nwant to use this to assign permissions.\n\n32\n00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,360\nSo I want to make sure it gets an SID,\nand make it a security principle.\n\n33\n00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,080\nIf I did distribution,\nthat would be email applications only.\n\n34\n00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,650\nNo SID, it's not a security principle,\nyou cannot use it to assign permissions.\n\n35\n00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,990\nAnd then the next parameter I wanna\nadd is going to be my GroupScope.\n\n36\n00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,934\nAnd I've got three choices there,\nI've got my domain local,\n\n37\n00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:07,840\nI've got my global, and\nI've got my universal.\n\n38\n00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,080\nAnd we'll go with global for this one.\n\n39\n00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,990\nAnd then if I hit Enter there,\nit would just create it at the root.\n\n40\n00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,860\nIf I want I can specify a path, and\nthen it’s just the distinguished\n\n41\n00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,560\nname of where I wanna create\nthat group in active directory.\n\n42\n00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,260\nAnd I’ve gonna go ahead and put it,\nI’ve got an OU called groups, I think.\n\n43\n00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,372\nSo I’m gonna tell you ou=groups,\n\n44\n00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:37,784\ndc=itprotv, dc=net,\n\n45\n00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:43,720\nand should be able to hit Enter and\nno red text is usually a good sign.\n\n46\n00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,653\nSo, well come back in here and refresh my\nconsole and I take a look at my group.\n\n47\n00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:53,298\nSo, sure enough,\nthere is my host group and\n\n48\n00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:57,247\nyou'll see that it is\na global security group.\n\n49\n00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:59,408\nSo that is creating\na group from PowerShell.\n\n50\n00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:05,290\nIt's just new-adgroup, give it a SAM\naccount name, give it a group scope,\n\n51\n00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,000\nglobal universal domain local,\nand give it a group category,\n\n52\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,710\neither security or distribution group,\ndepending on what you're trying to do.\n\n53\n00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,550\nOnce I've got that group created, next\nthing we might want to be able to do with\n\n54\n00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,870\na group is to go back and modify a group.\n\n55\n00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,220\nFor example, one of the things we\ntypically do is change the group scope.\n\n56\n00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,340\nIf we create a group and\n\n57\n00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,105\nactive directory through the GUI,\nthe default is global security group.\n\n58\n00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:32,575\nI don't know about you, Don, several\nI've gone in and created a group and\n\n59\n00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:34,365\nkind of forgot to change those.\n\n60\n00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:37,055\nYou go to type the name,\nyou hit the Enter, and you go, oh smack,\n\n61\n00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,495\nI wanted to change that into a universal\ngroup or something like that.\n\n62\n00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:42,317\n>> It's funny cuz that's exactly\nwhat I say, I'm like, oh smack.\n\n63\n00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:44,771\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't think I've ever said that but\n\n64\n00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,594\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I thought that was where I got\n\n65\n00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,410\nthat from was you.\n\n66\n00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,552\nSo, we can change the verb\nto a set command, so\n\n67\n00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:54,870\nset is gonna modify an existing object.\n\n68\n00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,330\nSo, Set-ADGroup.\n\n69\n00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,632\nThe name of the group\nthat I want to modify.\n\n70\n00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:03,470\nActually hat's gonna be an identity\nparameter in this case.\n\n71\n00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,630\nRemember when you change when you're\ndoing the new commands, it's -name.\n\n72\n00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,380\nWhen you're doing the commands,\nit's typically -identity.\n\n73\n00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,000\nOr you could leave identity off and\njust provide that name.\n\n74\n00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,380\nAnd what did I call that one, Hosts.\n\n75\n00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,360\nAnd let’s modify the group scope, so\n\n76\n00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,410\nI can just put in a little -groupscope.\n\n77\n00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,479\nAnd I’m gonna change that\none over to universal.\n\n78\n00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,740\nAnd if I go back into my\nGUI at this point, and\n\n79\n00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,390\nI pull up the properties,\nwe'll see that is now a universal group.\n\n80\n00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,330\nKeep in mind all my rules still apply,\nright.\n\n81\n00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,490\nSo if I was trying to convert\na universal group into a global group,\n\n82\n00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,350\nI can do that unless there's members\nof that universal group that are going\n\n83\n00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,530\nto violate the rules of what\na global group can contain.\n\n84\n00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,360\nThat a global group can only\ncontain users from the same domain.\n\n85\n00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840\nSo I'd have to make sure I\nwasn't violating any of that,\n\n86\n00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,390\nI'd have to remove users\nfirst if necessary.\n\n87\n00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,970\nAnd then the last thing that\nI want to be able to do\n\n88\n00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,070\nwith PowerShell is to remove a group\nwhen I no longer need that group.\n\n89\n00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,145\nAnd as you can imagine the command\nis going to be remove-adgroup.\n\n90\n00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,625\nAnd we'll just do a -identity.\n\n91\n00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,760\nI really don't even need that one but\nI'll go ahead and put it in there.\n\n92\n00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,570\nI could just do remove-adgroup hosts and\n\n93\n00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,380\nthat would go find that group and\nremove it.\n\n94\n00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,120\nOr I can do a -identity hosts,\nYes to confirm.\n\n95\n00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:34,822\nNo red text.\n\n96\n00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:39,073\nRemember, unlike organizational units,\nOUs by default when you create them,\n\n97\n00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,648\nthey're protected from\naccidental deletion.\n\n98\n00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:44,816\nSo if I were to try to run this\ncommand on an OU without unchecking or\n\n99\n00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,468\nrunning the command to remove\nthat protection first,\n\n100\n00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:51,080\nI would have gotten an error,\nas we saw in a previous segment.\n\n101\n00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,610\nGroups, however, when you create those,\n\n102\n00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,010\nthey're not protected from\naccidental deletion by default.\n\n103\n00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,880\nI can go back in there and turn that on,\nbut they're not by default.\n\n104\n00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,590\nSo in this case the remove\ncommand worked just fine.\n\n105\n00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,610\nThe group is no longer there,\nand we would lose that group.\n\n106\n00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,270\nJust remember, think back to our\nlessons or our previous segments,\n\n107\n00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,970\nwhen you remove that group you lose\nthe SID associated with that group,\n\n108\n00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,550\nyou lose all the membership of that group.\n\n109\n00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,260\nSo, be careful when you\ngo into deleting groups.\n\n110\n00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n111\n00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,510\nAnother thing to remember, and this is\nthe one that's always hard for me is,\n\n112\n00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,230\nin the GUI there's two different\nways to do groups, right,\n\n113\n00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,480\nyou can put a user into a group.\n\n114\n00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,050\nOr you can go to a group and modify\nit's membership and add users into it.\n\n115\n00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,600\nBut in the PowerShell,\nit's really all the same,\n\n116\n00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,180\nregardless of which way\nthat you look at it.\n\n117\n00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,727\nSo there's only one set of commands from\nthe PowerShell versus the two different\n\n118\n00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:36,677\npathways in the GUI.\n\n119\n00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:37,373\nA little bit of a difference there.\n\n120\n00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:38,905\n>> Exactly.\n\n121\n00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:40,430\nIn fact, that's one thing we didn't do.\n\n122\n00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,320\nDid we?\nWe didn't ad anybody to our group.\n\n123\n00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,190\nSo let's go back and do that.\n\n124\n00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,820\nI went ahead and recreated that group,\nthat host group.\n\n125\n00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,320\nAnd to add a user to\na group from PowerShell,\n\n126\n00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,685\nit's gonna be add-adgroupmember.\n\n127\n00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:55,680\nThat's gonna be the command.\n\n128\n00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,210\nAnd then the main the name of the group\nthat I wanna add somebody to,\n\n129\n00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,450\nin this case hosts, and\nthen the user account.\n\n130\n00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,880\nAnd you can do a comma separated list\nat this point, so if you’re adding\n\n131\n00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,140\nmultiple users into this group, I don’t\nhave to run this command for each one.\n\n132\n00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,710\nI can just find that, so let’s do a little\nrwong, she would still be out there.\n\n133\n00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,590\nAll right.\nAnd now, if I go back, so\n\n134\n00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,180\nit's just, add-adgroupmember.\n\n135\n00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,360\nYou can do a -identity, and then the name\nof the group, and in this case, hosts.\n\n136\n00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,760\nAnd then the members that I wanna add,\nrwong.\n\n137\n00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,540\nI could have done a comma separated list.\n\n138\n00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,790\nGo back into active directory,\nand refresh my council.\n\n139\n00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,240\nAnd where did I create that group?\n\n140\n00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,350\nI did that inside my groups OU.\n\n141\n00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,000\nI pull up the properties for hosts and I\nlook at that Members tab, and sure enough,\n\n142\n00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,130\nRonnie Wong is now a member\nof our host group.\n\n143\n00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,350\nSo there we can see we can add.\n\n144\n00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,210\nThere is a remove command a swell.\n\n145\n00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,560\nI don't think I want to get\ninto that one right now.\n\n146\n00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,950\nBut this is just gonna be\nchanging up the verb on that one.\n\n147\n00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,740\n>> And you also have get-adgroupmember, so\nif Mike wanted to verify that membership,\n\n148\n00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,790\nhe had to hunt and figure out,\nwhere did I put that host group.\n\n149\n00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,130\nIf you don't want to do that you can do\nget-adgroupmember hosts and just run that,\n\n150\n00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,150\nit'll return who's in it and\nyou can see Ronnie's right there.\n\n151\n00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,690\nSo very easy to work with\nthese from the PowerShell.\n\n152\n00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,940\nPut people into a group,\ntake them out of a group.\n\n153\n00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,020\nAdd, remove, really straight forward.\n\n154\n00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,400\nAnd a pretty cool thing to have.\n\n155\n00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,170\nThe nice thing about this is\nthat you can script it and\n\n156\n00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,970\nyou can set it to run at certain times.\n\n157\n00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,210\nBecause I might want Mike to be in\na group, but not until midnight tonight.\n\n158\n00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,400\nMaybe he doesn't actually start\nwork until tomorrow morning.\n\n159\n00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,610\nSo I don't want to put him in\nthe group now until it's closer to\n\n160\n00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,820\nthe time that he starts.\n\n161\n00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,080\nOr maybe I know that Mike is changing\njob roles six months from now.\n\n162\n00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,980\nI don't want to disable\nhis account in six months.\n\n163\n00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,500\nWindows makes that easy.\n\n164\n00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,020\nInstead, I just want to take him\nout of some groups in six months.\n\n165\n00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,715\nSo I can write a quick PowerShell\nscript that says just remove Mike\n\n166\n00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:51,305\nfrom this group,\n\n167\n00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:55,145\nand I then I can schedule it to run six\nmonths from now at midnight or whenever.\n\n168\n00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:57,826\nThat's the power of being able to\ndo this stuff from the PowerShell,\n\n169\n00:08:57,826 --> 00:08:59,408\nas well as doing things in bulk, right?\n\n170\n00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,659\nAdding into a bunch of groups\nall at once or whatever.\n\n171\n00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,485\nThat's something that\nbecomes a lot more simple.\n\n172\n00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:05,155\n>> All right, exactly.\n\n173\n00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:09,545\n>> All right, so in this segment we got a\nchance to see how to create groups, how to\n\n174\n00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:12,675\nmodify the groups that we've created,\nand then how to add people into them,\n\n175\n00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:16,540\nwhich is kind of an important piece\nif we anticipate using them, right?\n\n176\n00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,390\nGotta have people in the group\nto get any work done.\n\n177\n00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,657\nAll right, I hope you guys enjoyed that.\n\n178\n00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:23,954\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more power shell coming up.\n\n179\n00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:29,029\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14,490\nexporting data to the active\ndirectory,data PowerShell.\n\n4\n00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,110\nAnd most commonly this\nis gonna be done for\n\n5\n00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,840\ndoing things like creating user accounts\nor other activities, as far as importing.\n\n6\n00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,730\nOn the exporting side,\nit's just generating reports.\n\n7\n00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,450\nFinding information out about the users\nthat are inside of our active directory.\n\n8\n00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,360\nPowerShell gives us quite a few utilities\nto do that so let's take a look.\n\n9\n00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,740\n>> Let's take a peek here.\n\n10\n00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,300\nSo one of the things, you're probably\nfamiliar if you've worked with active\n\n11\n00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,860\ndirectory any amount of time, you might\nbe familiar with some tools like CSVDE Or\n\n12\n00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,030\nL div DE, these were command line\ntools that we could use to import and\n\n13\n00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,570\nexport data out of Active Directory.\n\n14\n00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,330\nPowerShell let's us do that,\nlet's us work with our CSV files.\n\n15\n00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,340\nWe can actually use PowerShell to go get\nthat CSV file, load it up into variable,\n\n16\n00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,390\nand then just do a Foreach loop and\nwork our way through that CSV file.\n\n17\n00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,260\nYour first question might be, why?\n\n18\n00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,290\nWhy the heck would I do that?\n\n19\n00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,590\nI already have CSVDE, I can use\nCSVDE to pull in that text file and\n\n20\n00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,490\ndump it in Active Directory,\n\n21\n00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,890\nbecause you can create new objects\nin Active Directory with CSVDE.\n\n22\n00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,450\nWhat you cannot do With CSVED,\nis set the password.\n\n23\n00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,480\nRight?\nWhich mean all those accounts that you\n\n24\n00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,170\ncreate, you're gonna have to go back,\nand set the password,\n\n25\n00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,470\nthen you're gonna have to go back again,\nand enable those accounts.\n\n26\n00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,980\nWhich I could do with\nthe PowerShell script as well.\n\n27\n00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,100\nBut if I use PowerShell to bring\nthe CSV file in the first place,\n\n28\n00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,160\nI can go ahead and set the password\nthen as well as enable the account.\n\n29\n00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,860\nI can do it all in one step.\n\n30\n00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,570\nWhat's really cool is typically we're\ngoing to be doing this with a script, so\n\n31\n00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,180\nI can,\nin fact let me pull it up the script.\n\n32\n00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,550\nFirst I'll pull up the CSV file.\n\n33\n00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,530\nYou guys have seen.\n\n34\n00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,900\nLet me modify my extension\non this guy real quick.\n\n35\n00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:54,550\nYou guys have seen a CSV file, I'm sure.\n\n36\n00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,640\nI want to pull it up and\nshow you what I've got in there.\n\n37\n00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,006\nAll right, and let's bump that font\nup a wee bit so we can see it on TV.\n\n38\n00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:06,010\nAll right.\n\n39\n00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,460\nSo, like any other CSV file I've got\nseparate lines on each line is one object.\n\n40\n00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,890\nThe values on one line represent one\nobject, they're separated by commas.\n\n41\n00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,750\nOn that very first line,\nI've got what we call our header row.\n\n42\n00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,480\nWhere I'm defining the order\nof those attributes, right?\n\n43\n00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,730\nWhat order those attributes\nare gonna appear in.\n\n44\n00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,600\nSo, I've got first name,\n\n45\n00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,740\ncomma, last name, comma, department,\nand comma default password.\n\n46\n00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,400\nNow, notice I'm not using the actual name\nwe would see in Active Directory, and\n\n47\n00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,320\nthat's okay because we're gonna be\nswapping them up when we run our script.\n\n48\n00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,780\nIf I was doing this with CSVDE,\nthat would fail, right?\n\n49\n00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,940\nThere is no first name attribute,\nit's a given name.\n\n50\n00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,240\nThere is no last name attribute,\nit's dash surname.\n\n51\n00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,940\nSo because I'm using a script, I can put a\nlittle more user friendly information here\n\n52\n00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,110\nand you use this, you might have a brand\nnew network that you're setting up and\n\n53\n00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,460\nyou want to create all of your users in\nbulk or maybe hrs hiring a whole slew,\n\n54\n00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,460\nmaybe they're bringing in\n20 new employees next week.\n\n55\n00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,700\nThey've already I've already got\na spreadsheet, with first name, last name,\n\n56\n00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,190\nsome address information, and\nthings like that in the spreadsheet.\n\n57\n00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,460\nI can save it as a CSV file, and\nturn around and import it with PowerShell.\n\n58\n00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,930\nNow let me show you the script\nthat I've written here\n\n59\n00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,605\nyou're gonna edit this newusers.ps1.\n\n60\n00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:22,095\nPowerShell will open up, there we go.\n\n61\n00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:26,920\n[LAUGH] And I simply have a couple of\nvariables at the beginning, a csvfile and\n\n62\n00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,210\nthen the path to that csvfile.\n\n63\n00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,040\nAnd on the following line,\nwhere do I wanna create these new users.\n\n64\n00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,420\nI'm gonna put them in UserAccounts,\n\n65\n00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,670\nI'm pretty sure I have an OU\ncalled user accounts in there.\n\n66\n00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,660\nSo I'm just storing that information and\nvariables.\n\n67\n00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,400\nAnd then I've got a $users= and\n\n68\n00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,660\nthere's my PowerShell command,\nimport-CSV, this is what's gonna go out,\n\n69\n00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,650\nfind that CSV file, and\nstore that in this variable $users.\n\n70\n00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,980\nSo with this script I've given\nmyself a little flexibility.\n\n71\n00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,670\nI could have just done Import-CSV and\nthen the path to that CSV file.\n\n72\n00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,910\nBut instead I put in a variable up here,\nso if I want to reuse this next week,\n\n73\n00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,190\nI can just come in here.\n\n74\n00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,510\nAnd modify the name or\nthe location of that CSV file or\n\n75\n00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,420\nmodify the OU that I wanna\ndump those user accounts in.\n\n76\n00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,700\nI don't have to rewrite\nthe entire script every time, so\n\n77\n00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,079\nthere's a little bit\nof re-usability there.\n\n78\n00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,040\nSo there's $users Import-CSV and then the\nvariable, it's gonna go pull that file and\n\n79\n00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,157\nthen the actual PowerShell\nscript four each $I and\n\n80\n00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:40,730\n$user so it's going to loop through\neach line in that CSV file and\n\n81\n00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,320\nit's going to set their display\nname we're gonna right.\n\n82\n00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,490\nWe're going to plug two strings\ntogether with a space in between them,\n\n83\n00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,710\nthat firstName and that LastName.\n\n84\n00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,130\nNow these are the names from the CSV file,\nso\n\n85\n00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,455\nif I'd called them something else,\ngiven name, surname Name.\n\n86\n00:04:58,455 --> 00:05:00,435\nJust name, whatever.\n\n87\n00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,325\nI would change those there.\n\n88\n00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,865\nThe dollar sign display name is\nthe attribute that we're gonna\n\n89\n00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:07,625\nchange in active directory\non that user account.\n\n90\n00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,625\nI've also got a $SecurePass,\n\n91\n00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,695\nand I'm setting that equal\nto ConvertTo-Securestring.\n\n92\n00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:19,295\nAnd then I'm just gonna pull from\nthe CSVfile whatever I've got in that\n\n93\n00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:22,650\nlast column if you will\nthat DefaultPassword.\n\n94\n00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,680\nI'm doing it as plain text.\n\n95\n00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,860\nAnd then the final part of the script\nis the actual new user command.\n\n96\n00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,730\nSo until here we've just been\ngetting everything set up so\n\n97\n00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,720\nthat I can now run the new-ad user.\n\n98\n00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,410\nSo it's new-Aduser-Name and\nit's gonna grab the first name.\n\n99\n00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,430\n-Given, and\nit's gonna go grab the FirstName again.\n\n100\n00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,710\nSurname is gonna be their\nLastName from the CSV file.\n\n101\n00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,500\nDisplayName, it's gonna\ndo the $DisplayName.\n\n102\n00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,330\nAnd remember,\nI set that equal to FirstName concatenated\n\n103\n00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,255\nwith their LastName.\n\n104\n00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,820\nAnd then I've got their department pulling\nfrom the CSV file, and then the path,\n\n105\n00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,810\npulling from the variable we set\nat the beginning of this script,\n\n106\n00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,560\nand then the account password.\n\n107\n00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,640\nIt's going to grab the password\nout of that file and\n\n108\n00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,190\nit's going to Enable that account.\n\n109\n00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,070\n>> Because the default is that\nthe accounts we create will be disabled,\n\n110\n00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,230\nwhich you may want, but in our case we're\ngoing to go ahead and bring them live.\n\n111\n00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,070\n>> So let's find out.\n\n112\n00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,750\nWe've got that script set up, we're going\nto go ahead and execute this script.\n\n113\n00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,529\nJust going to save the script before I\nrun it, the changes that I made there.\n\n114\n00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,900\nAnd barring any red text,\nwe should be successful,\n\n115\n00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,800\nso if I go take a look in\nActive Directory, and I think I did that,\n\n116\n00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,127\nwhat, in User Accounts,\nwhere did I make that?\n\n117\n00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now I forgot where I\n\n118\n00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,445\nactually made it there.\n\n119\n00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:45,050\nou=UserAccounts, so\nlet's refresh this screen.\n\n120\n00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,620\nAnd sure enough there are my three new\nemployees that have pulled from that\n\n121\n00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,590\nCSV file.\n\n122\n00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,840\nAnd if I pull one of them up,\nI'll see it's got the first name,\n\n123\n00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,560\nthe last name the display name and I'll\nalso notice that the accounts are enabled.\n\n124\n00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,370\nSo they're ready to go at this point.\n\n125\n00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,580\nThey've got that default password set.\n\n126\n00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,020\nthat have pulled from that so at this\npoint if the user could log on with\n\n127\n00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,920\nthose accounts,\nwe could have them change their password.\n\n128\n00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,780\nAnd there's other parameters as you saw\nin the previous segments, when you go to\n\n129\n00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,150\ncreate a new user I could have used any\nof those parameters If that CVS had more\n\n130\n00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,250\ninformation, like somebody had gone in,\nfilled in department, things like that.\n\n131\n00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,750\nAddress, city, state, zip, phone numbers,\nfaxes, all that can be in that text file,\n\n132\n00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,080\nand I could populate all that with\njust running that one script.\n\n133\n00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,350\n>> Yeah, basically yeah.\n\n134\n00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,190\n>> And that is it.\n\n135\n00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,200\nThat is importing users with CSV.\n\n136\n00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,340\n>> Now, as far as exporting users,\nwell, do we have an example for\n\n137\n00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:40,880\nthem in this segment?\n\n138\n00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,026\n>> You know, I did not set one up.\n\n139\n00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:46,625\n>> Okay, we actually did cover that in\nanother segment if you go back into our\n\n140\n00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:51,075\nearlier part of the series, which was\nactually in the very beginning of\n\n141\n00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,993\nthe series,\nback in the one point whatevers.\n\n142\n00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:57,090\nI did one on formating output.\n\n143\n00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,200\nAnd what you could do is you\ncan use get dash AD user and\n\n144\n00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,230\nthat's what's gonna let you\npull up your user list.\n\n145\n00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,510\nOr get dash anything right?\n\n146\n00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,090\nYou can get whatever the heck you want out\nof the Active Directory or anywhere else.\n\n147\n00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,303\nAnd you can pipe that into\nthe export CSV command lit and\n\n148\n00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:16,530\nthen [INAUDIBLE] dump it out as\na CSV is that's what you want.\n\n149\n00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,250\nThere's the convert dash two HTML command\nlet also that will dump that out.\n\n150\n00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,627\nSo, there's a few different\nones that are out there.\n\n151\n00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:26,813\nPulls out really quick here, 1.8 so\n\n152\n00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:30,600\nin 1.8 we did a segment called\nFormatting Command Output.\n\n153\n00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,070\nJump over and check that one out, cuz it\nhandles all the export stuff right there.\n\n154\n00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,670\nAnd if not just tied to Active Directory,\n\n155\n00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,370\nit's really tied to everything\ninside of the PowerShell.\n\n156\n00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,780\nBut if you want to create that CSV,\nmaybe have a test domain.\n\n157\n00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,680\nAnd you want to export the users\nfrom this test domain and\n\n158\n00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,250\nthen go import them in\nyour production domain.\n\n159\n00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,400\nYou would use the export-CSV\ncommand let to get that data out.\n\n160\n00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,080\nAnd then you go and\n\n161\n00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,810\nyou use a script like Mike's to bring that\ndata in from that CSV, and move it along.\n\n162\n00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,180\nSo that's kind of the other side of it.\n\n163\n00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,810\nDefinitely check out that other segment.\n\n164\n00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,170\nIt is titled formatting command output,\nand it's all right in there.\n\n165\n00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:07,660\nAll right, so in this segment we got\na chance to see how to import data from\n\n166\n00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,260\na CSV.\n\n167\n00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,440\nMost particularly to create user\naccounts inside of the Active Directory.\n\n168\n00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,470\nIterate through that and\ncreate all those accounts, all at once.\n\n169\n00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,920\nVery nice and easy to do.\n\n170\n00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,790\nBeats the heck out of using the GUI for\nsomething like this.\n\n171\n00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,690\n>> Absolutely.\n\n172\n00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,340\n>> Alright,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n173\n00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,420\nStay tuned.\n\n174\n00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,512\nWe've got more PowerShell coming up.\n\n175\n00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:30,369\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

of\n\n3\n00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:13,310\nthe Active Directory.\n\n4\n00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,140\nThe whole glory of PowerShell, if it has\nany glory, is the fact that it makes it\n\n5\n00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,770\nreally easy to make large quantities\nof changes really rapidly.\n\n6\n00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,570\nIf I just have to change a value for\none user, I'll just go into\n\n7\n00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,450\nActive Directory the computers do it in\nthe GUI, why mess around with a script?\n\n8\n00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,330\nBut, if I have to change 1000 users,\nforget that, you don't want to go and\n\n9\n00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,910\ndo that in a GUI,\nthat PowerShell is where it's at.\n\n10\n00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,250\nSo, Mike you've got a couple example for\nus of ways to do that, right?\n\n11\n00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,620\n>> I do, hopefully,\n[LAUGH] yeah, it really is,\n\n12\n00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,450\nit's advantageous because in the GUI\nyou can do some bulk operations, right?\n\n13\n00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,220\nIf you can select all the users\nyou want to work with,\n\n14\n00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,460\nyou can pull up the properties and\nyou'll see the things that you can change\n\n15\n00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,390\nwhen you have more than\none object selected.\n\n16\n00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,920\nThe problem is the selection, right?\n\n17\n00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,220\nIf they're all in the same OU and\nthey're all on the same screen,\n\n18\n00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,490\nI can use my different techniques like\nclick on the first one, hold down Shift,\n\n19\n00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,660\nclick on the last one.\n\n20\n00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,800\nWhat if they're in different OUs,\n\n21\n00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,780\ndifferent locations\nwithin Active Directory?\n\n22\n00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,560\nNo way to select those\nmultiple objects and\n\n23\n00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,570\nyou can’t change all the parameters\nwhen you’re in the GUI.\n\n24\n00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,490\nSo that’s really where\nPowerShell comes into play,\n\n25\n00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,615\nthe ability to find what I’m looking for\nand then make changes en masse.\n\n26\n00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:17,275\nSo let's take a look.\n\n27\n00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,945\nThe first thing you're gonna need\nto be able to do is find what\n\n28\n00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:20,495\nyou're looking for.\n\n29\n00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:24,185\nWe somehow need to select\nthe objects that I wanna change.\n\n30\n00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:27,425\nAnd we're gonna use a Get-ADUser command.\n\n31\n00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:32,745\nAnd if I just do a Get-ADUser,\nit does require a filter parameter.\n\n32\n00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:35,535\nYou can do an asterisk for the filter and\n\n33\n00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:39,120\nit should return all the users\nI have in Active Directory.\n\n34\n00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,065\nIncluding things like my built-in\nadministrator account, my guest account,\n\n35\n00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:46,836\nmy Kerberos Ticket-Granting Ticket Service\naccount and things like that,\n\n36\n00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:49,250\ntypically not what we're trying to do.\n\n37\n00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,290\nSo, we can do a couple\nof different things,\n\n38\n00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,390\nwe can change up the filter to\nchange what we're looking for.\n\n39\n00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,948\nWe can also adjust the search base.\n\n40\n00:01:56,948 --> 00:02:00,310\nSo for example; I'm gonna come back\nin here and add, I'm gonna reuse this\n\n41\n00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,380\ncommand a few times, so I'm gonna add\nit to the beginning of this command.\n\n42\n00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,210\nI'm gonna do a search base.\n\n43\n00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,850\nAnd this is telling it where\nI want to start the search.\n\n44\n00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,030\nFor example, if I put in here for\nsearch base,\n\n45\n00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,930\nit's going to be a distinguished name so\nsomething like OU equals,\n\n46\n00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,370\nwhere'd I put those accounts,\nhost, which is inside the user\n\n47\n00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,920\naccounts OU,\nwhich is my domain component, ITPROTV.\n\n48\n00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,650\nDC equals net,\n\n49\n00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,570\nput a little quote on the end of that, and\nI leave the filter as an asterisk, so all.\n\n50\n00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,440\nSo this time, it only returns the three\nusers that are inside that organization,\n\n51\n00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,830\nagain so you're just telling\nthat where to start that search.\n\n52\n00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,400\nNext, let's try to add a filter to it.\n\n53\n00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,980\nSo, I'm gonna get, and I'm gonna leave\nto use that same command, Get-ADUser.\n\n54\n00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,560\nWe're gonna start in that OU, and\nlet's do a filter, something like.\n\n55\n00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,400\nLet's say we're looking for,\nI need to set the company, right?\n\n56\n00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,170\nThe more attributes you fill out on\nthe user account and Active Directory,\n\n57\n00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,060\nthe easier it is to find and search for\nobjects for other users to work with them.\n\n58\n00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,830\nBut unfortunately,\nin IT a lot of times we don't.\n\n59\n00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,960\nWe just fill in the name, the CM account\nname, the password, we let it go.\n\n60\n00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,540\nSo maybe we wanna go back and\nwe wanna add that company.\n\n61\n00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,030\nWe could do a filter.\n\n62\n00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,070\nI was trying to find all of the user\naccounts that had a blank company,\n\n63\n00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,160\nfor example.\n\n64\n00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,410\nI could do a -not to negate.\n\n65\n00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:32,424\nAnd then inside my parentheses here,\nI could do company-like and\n\n66\n00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:38,870\njust an empty quote, or I'm sorry\nactually let's do an asterisk in there.\n\n67\n00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,590\nSo if we take a minute and read that,\nwe're finished closing it up.\n\n68\n00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,710\n>> Do you need to get rid of\nan asterisk after filter?\n\n69\n00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,790\n>> No, that's going to bring them\nall in there, oh yes, sorry my bad.\n\n70\n00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,990\nLeft the old filter in there, thank you.\n\n71\n00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,450\nAll right so now we got a filter where\nit's saying company like anything.\n\n72\n00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,030\nBut then we've got the word not in\nfront of that, so not like anything,\n\n73\n00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,260\nwhich should be blank.\n\n74\n00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,390\nSo we hit Enter,\nI can see that all three user accounts,\n\n75\n00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,970\ncuz I'm still on that search base,\njust that host OU.\n\n76\n00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,070\nI can see all three users must have\na blank company attribute, and\n\n77\n00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:19,190\nwe can see that if we do a Get-ADUser.\n\n78\n00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,590\nLet's do a, I'm actually gonna reuse that\nsame command, we'll stay in that same one.\n\n79\n00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:32,010\nThen I'm gonna add a -property and\nwe're gonna do a company.\n\n80\n00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,640\n>> Yeah, company, notice in\nthe output from the command above,\n\n81\n00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,000\ncompany is not one of\nthe values that's returned.\n\n82\n00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,450\nSo, for whatever reason, Get-ADUser just\nreturns this real subset of options.\n\n83\n00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,170\nSo, if you wanna display other things,\n\n84\n00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,680\nlike who they're managed by,\nor whether they're locked out.\n\n85\n00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,800\nThose are tucked away under Properties.\n\n86\n00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,190\nAnd so Mike's just adding in\nthat property called company\n\n87\n00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,080\nto be able to get it back and here we can\nsee just the name and the company and\n\n88\n00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,250\nyou'll see the company is blank for\nall three.\n\n89\n00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,360\n>> Exactly.\n\n90\n00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,780\nSo if we wanted to set those companies,\n\n91\n00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,860\nif we want to do that in bulk,\nbecause we can do it singly, right?\n\n92\n00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,576\nWe could just a set-ADUser Mike and\nthen -company and\n\n93\n00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,850\nthen whatever value you want to set it to.\n\n94\n00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,330\nIf you want to use all three, we're gonna\ntake this, and we're gonna pipe it out.\n\n95\n00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,990\nSo I will say as a precaution,\n\n96\n00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,825\nanytime you're gonna do bulk operations,\nyou want to be really careful.\n\n97\n00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because you're getting ready to make\n\n98\n00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,510\nchanges to multiple objects\nat the same time, right?\n\n99\n00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,790\nSo I'll always run my filter first, like\nI'm gonna run this command one more time.\n\n100\n00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:39,090\nOops, let me take that back out,\nI forgot we added to that guy.\n\n101\n00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,430\nLet's take out that little pipe there.\n\n102\n00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,180\nAnd I can see that it only returns the\nthree users I want to make a change to.\n\n103\n00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,780\nWhat if I had mistyped my filter and\n\n104\n00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,860\ninstead of getting just those three users,\nI got all the users in the company.\n\n105\n00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,120\nAnd I didn't bother to test it.\n\n106\n00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,760\nI went ahead and piped it into\nsay a Disable Account command, or\n\n107\n00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,750\nsomething like that, right.\n\n108\n00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,820\nI could end up disabling all\nthe accounts in the entire company\n\n109\n00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,300\nin one quick command.\n\n110\n00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,180\nSo always check the first\npart of your syntax.\n\n111\n00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,200\nMake sure that it is returning the list\nof user accounts that you wanna modify.\n\n112\n00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,590\nOnce you're sure the list is returning\nwhat you want then we can go and\n\n113\n00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:26,140\npipe that into a set-ADUser and\nlet's set that company.\n\n114\n00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,335\n>> You know that's one of the negatives\n\n115\n00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:33,585\nof the GUI is that you can only\nchange one thing at a time, right?\n\n116\n00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:37,485\nBut one of the positives of the GUI is\nyou can only mess up one thing at time.\n\n117\n00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:39,445\nAnd here you can mess up\nan infinite amount, so.\n\n118\n00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:40,775\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n119\n00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,525\n>> You've tested yours and\nnow you're basically setting that company.\n\n120\n00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:44,775\n>> Yep.\n\n121\n00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:46,790\nSo, and I shouldn't get any results.\n\n122\n00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,750\nNow if I go find that command\nwhere we pulled back all of those,\n\n123\n00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,340\nthat's gonna give us a blank one.\n\n124\n00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,790\nLet's just write a new command.\n\n125\n00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,736\nLet's do it Get -ADUser -searchbase.\n\n126\n00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:07,212\nActually that's gonna take too long,\nI'll get all of them.\n\n127\n00:07:07,212 --> 00:07:10,530\nWe'll do a Get -ADUser.\n\n128\n00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,770\nAnd let's do a -filter,\nand we'll do that to all,\n\n129\n00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,710\nwe'll make sure we grab that\ncompany attribute so property,\n\n130\n00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,620\nI want to include company, and\nthen let's format that out into a table or\n\n131\n00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,220\na list, let's do a table name and company.\n\n132\n00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,170\nAnd there I can see those three user\naccounts Don, Mike, and Ronnie and\n\n133\n00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,520\ntheir company is now all set to ITproTV.\n\n134\n00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,302\nWe're able to take that Get User command,\nwork it up, set our filter,\n\n135\n00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:47,230\nyou know, looking for like blank company.\n\n136\n00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,460\nAnd then once I know I've got the right\nlist of users coming back, I can just\n\n137\n00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,520\npipe that into my set command and I can\nform whatever action I want at that point.\n\n138\n00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,490\n>> And it's not much different than if you\nwere performing this on a single user.\n\n139\n00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,960\nIf you look at Mike's command,\nSet -ADUser -company itprotv.\n\n140\n00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,310\nIf you wanted to set the company for\none user, you do that same command,\n\n141\n00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,510\nyou would just add -identity, and the name\nof the person you wanted to modify, right?\n\n142\n00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,030\nSo all we're doing here is\nleaving off the -identity.\n\n143\n00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,210\nThe identity is actually coming\nfrom the previous command.\n\n144\n00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,460\nAnd you stack them together.\n\n145\n00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,430\nSo, if you know how to change\nthe value for one user,\n\n146\n00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,870\nyou know how to change the value for\nmultiple values simply by\n\n147\n00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,610\npiping the value of your query into\nyour command, pretty straight forward.\n\n148\n00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,300\n>> Exactly, and you can do a lot of\nreally neat things with these commands.\n\n149\n00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,640\nLike another one that we could\ndo is maybe I want to look for\n\n150\n00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,790\nall of the users that haven't logged on in\nthe last 90 days or something like that,\n\n151\n00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,790\nsomething we gotta do periodically.\n\n152\n00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,770\nWe can show an example of that.\n\n153\n00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,400\nIf I go out and do a, let's see here.\n\n154\n00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,750\nWhat I'm gonna do here, I'm gonna set\na creative variable called logondate.\n\n155\n00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,630\nAnd I'm going to set\nthat equal to get date\n\n156\n00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:00,600\nand let's add to that a negative 90 for\nexample.\n\n157\n00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,480\n>> So that would be basically\nthe variable that's storing\n\n158\n00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,280\nwhatever day it was 90\ndays prior to today.\n\n159\n00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,000\nThree months ago.\n\n160\n00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,090\n>> Exactly.\n\n161\n00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,530\nAnd then I could turn around and\n\n162\n00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,290\ndo a Get-ADUser command and\nI'm gonna do a filter.\n\n163\n00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,924\nThen for my filter, I will do a lastlogon,\n\n164\n00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:30,384\nis less than or equal to my $logondate.\n\n165\n00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:32,832\nAnd in that little block.\n\n166\n00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:40,366\n>> All right, so that would return anybody\nwho hasn't logged in, in the last 90 days.\n\n167\n00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:40,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n168\n00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:47,106\nSo, yeah, get-ADUser-filter last logon\nless than or equal to 90 days ago.\n\n169\n00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:51,060\nSo, anybody that has not\nlogged on in 90 days or more.\n\n170\n00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,543\nSo that gives me a list of all the users.\n\n171\n00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:55,910\nI don't want to disable, like,\nmy Kerberos Ticket-Granting Ticket or\n\n172\n00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,898\nanything like that.\n\n173\n00:09:56,898 --> 00:10:00,730\nIf I did a search base, I guess I\ncould limit that to just that one OU.\n\n174\n00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,799\nLet's do that, let's do a search base, and\n\n175\n00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,698\nwe'll set that equal to\nthat OU equals hosts.\n\n176\n00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:14,923\nWhich is inside user accounts\nwhich is inside IT protv.net.\n\n177\n00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:20,336\nAnd now it's just getting two\nusers because I logged on using\n\n178\n00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:26,082\none of those user accounts a minute\nago testing some things out.\n\n179\n00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:30,672\nSo there's two user accounts\nthat haven't logged on\n\n180\n00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:35,530\nin the last 90 days, so\nmaybe I want to disable those.\n\n181\n00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:40,310\nThey're no longer needed, they were temp\nworkers, I forgot to set on an expiration\n\n182\n00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,360\ndate on those accounts, so I use my\ncommand to go find any accounts that\n\n183\n00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,199\nare still hanging out there that nobody's\nused, and I can just do a disable.\n\n184\n00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:50,483\n>> If I could spell.\n\n185\n00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:58,490\nAccount and\nnow it will disable those two accounts.\n\n186\n00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,390\n>> Yeah.\nQuick and easy.\n\n187\n00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,380\nIf you have user accounts that\nhaven't logged in in ninety days,\n\n188\n00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,600\nthose are probably employees\nwho were terminated.\n\n189\n00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,540\nThat have you know just nobody knew or\nremembered to disable them when they left.\n\n190\n00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,970\nSo it's usually saved to disable those or\ncomputer accounts, right.\n\n191\n00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,900\nThey might be computers that have\nbeen decommissioned and removed so\n\n192\n00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,520\nthis is a great way to ensure that we\ndon't have straggling accounts laying\n\n193\n00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,100\naround in our Active Directory.\n\n194\n00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,880\nYou could automate this and set it\nto run once a day or once a week and\n\n195\n00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,680\nit would just scan through the AD looking\nfor any users that hadn't logged in and\n\n196\n00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,460\ndisable them.\n\n197\n00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,930\nIt's a great way to improve security,\nright, real simple, all done, right here.\n\n198\n00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,380\n>> Another handy one to do might be,\n\n199\n00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,110\nin a previous segment we used a script\nto create a bunch of new user accounts.\n\n200\n00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,400\nAnd in that script we set their\npassword to a generic password so\n\n201\n00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,250\nthat we could enable the account and\nthey could go logon.\n\n202\n00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,300\nWhat we didn't do is tell it that I want\nthem to change their password in the next\n\n203\n00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,550\nlogon, right, so\nlet's say we hired 15 new people,\n\n204\n00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,490\nand I used a script to create\nthose new accounts and\n\n205\n00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,440\nset their password to a generic\npassword that everybody knows.\n\n206\n00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,320\nThey walk in on Monday, I say here's\nyour account name, here's your password,\n\n207\n00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,620\ngo sit at your cubicle,\ngo ahead and logon.\n\n208\n00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,560\nWell when they logon that first time,\nI want them to have to\n\n209\n00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,920\nchange their password to something\nthat they know, and nobody else knows.\n\n210\n00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,070\nI don't wanna have to go through Active\nDirectory, and open up the properties on\n\n211\n00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,000\neach one of those user accounts,\nand check that little checkmark.\n\n212\n00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,370\nUser must change password at next logon.\n\n213\n00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,372\nSo what I can do is, I can just pipe this\nout into a change password at next logon.\n\n214\n00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,150\n[SOUND]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,459\n>> If we do a set-ADUser first and\n\n216\n00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:40,601\nthen a -changePasswordatLogon and\n\n217\n00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:43,607\nset that to a $true.\n\n218\n00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:48,429\nAnd if we flip over to Active Directory\nand I do a little refresh.\n\n219\n00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,140\nAnd we take a look at Don's account.\n\n220\n00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,610\nI'll say user must change password\nat next logon is indeed checked.\n\n221\n00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,270\nSo just a couple of things that we can\ndo using PowerShell to automate making\n\n222\n00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,110\nchanges to bulk objects.\n\n223\n00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,080\nIt's really limited to your creativity.\n\n224\n00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,070\n>> Another one that is worthwhile\nto remember with this, because you\n\n225\n00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,570\nare changing multiple accounts,\nis remember the -what if operator.\n\n226\n00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,830\nMike, do you ever use that one?\n\n227\n00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,900\n>> I don't use it often.\n\n228\n00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,300\nI probably should.\n\n229\n00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,610\n>> Bring up the command you're\nin to disable the account.\n\n230\n00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,170\nWell, I guess that's not gonna quite work,\nis it?\n\n231\n00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,260\nSo, you know,\nhe disabled some accounts in bulk.\n\n232\n00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,895\nWhat if we wanted to re-enable\nthose same accounts?\n\n233\n00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:31,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well, he's looking for that logon date,\n\n234\n00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,940\nwhich is not going to work.\n\n235\n00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,140\nWell, no, I guess the logon\ndate hasn't changed, right.\n\n236\n00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,110\nSo you could run that same command, right?\n\n237\n00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,867\nLooking for people who haven't\nlogged in in the last 90 days and\n\n238\n00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:46,762\ninstead of disable -88,\nyou can say enable that 88 account and\n\n239\n00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:49,244\nthen at the very end of\nthat add a -what if.\n\n240\n00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:53,838\nAnd what -what if does is it doesn't\nactually run the command that\n\n241\n00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:57,960\nyou're putting in, right, so\nwhen he does -what if and.\n\n242\n00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,655\n>> Spells it right.\n\n243\n00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,170\n[LAUGH]\n>> And once that's in there,\n\n244\n00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,880\nit's going to show what would happen,\nright?\n\n245\n00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,810\nAnd see how it's saying,\n\n246\n00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,020\nwhat if performing the operation\nset on target Don.\n\n247\n00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,090\nPerforming the operation on Ronnie.\n\n248\n00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,270\n>> But not Mike.\n\n249\n00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,290\n>> But not Mike, right,\nbecause you didn't show up in that list.\n\n250\n00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,140\nBut the other thing is it's\nnot actually doing it.\n\n251\n00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,690\nIt didn't actually perform\nthe operation on me or Ronnie.\n\n252\n00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,680\nIt's just saying,\nif you were to run this command,\n\n253\n00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,400\nhere's the people that would be affected.\n\n254\n00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,220\nSo when you're in your testing stages\nwhen you're not quite certain yet,\n\n255\n00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,960\nuse that-what if to do a quick test.\n\n256\n00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,370\nMake sure you get,\nwhat looks like the right users back.\n\n257\n00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,960\nBecause if you start seeing the Kerberos\nTicket-Granting Ticket Service.\n\n258\n00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,530\nYou mentioned that one, Mike.\n\n259\n00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,875\nIf you were to mess that thing up,\nthat's bad.\n\n260\n00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,770\n[LAUGH] You do not want that.\n\n261\n00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,320\nSo it would be that red flag,\n\n262\n00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,786\nyou'd get a chance to see it\nbefore you did any damage, right?\n\n263\n00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:50,500\nRemember -what if,\nalmost almost all of the set and\n\n264\n00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,703\nmodified commands support that-whatif so\ndefinitely use it.\n\n265\n00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:58,576\n>> That's another one where now that\nI've once I've determined that I did get\n\n266\n00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:01,782\nthe right users back I could just\ntake the what if off of there and\n\n267\n00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:04,950\nexecute my command so\nI don't have to retype the whole thing.\n\n268\n00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,360\n>> There is another one that I\nnever use which is -confirm.\n\n269\n00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,410\nIf you want it to prompt you for\neach one, that yes, no all prompt,\n\n270\n00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,610\nand that way you can go one by one and\nverify.\n\n271\n00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,040\nSo, if you want to make sure, yeah,\ngo ahead and search the AD for\n\n272\n00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,090\npeople who haven't\nlogged in in 90 days but\n\n273\n00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,600\none by one give me a chance to accept or\ndeny, right?\n\n274\n00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,870\nYou can throw a -confirm on the end and\nit'll confirm each step along the way.\n\n275\n00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,300\nSo -whatif, -confirm, good ones to use\nwhen you're doing bulk operations.\n\n276\n00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,470\nAll right, well, in this segment\nwe got a chance to see how to\n\n277\n00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,760\nhandle bulk operations in the PowerShell.\n\n278\n00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,410\nWe come up with some kind of get command\nthat gathers all the objects you want\n\n279\n00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,260\nto modify.\n\n280\n00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,850\nAnd we pipe that into a set or\na modified command to actually go in and\n\n281\n00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,510\nchange those values and\nget them put in place.\n\n282\n00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,910\nPretty easy to do, very powerful.\n\n283\n00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,890\nWe also talk about some ways to test and\nmake sure we don't screw it up!\n\n284\n00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,820\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,220\n>> Running our get command\n\n286\n00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,640\nwith the filter first to verify\nwe get the results we want.\n\n287\n00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,850\nUsing what if, using confirm, right?\n\n288\n00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,300\nAll different modifiers that\nare pretty handy there.\n\n289\n00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,480\nReally good stuff and this is truly\nwhat the PowerShell is designed for.\n\n290\n00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,260\nBulk changes.\n\n291\n00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,790\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n292\n00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,450\nStay tuned we've got more\nPowerShell coming up.\n\n293\n00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:20,109\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,457\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:13,200\nAll right, in this segment, we're going to\nbe using PowerShell to install Hyper-V.\n\n3\n00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,589\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat we've got here.\n\n4\n00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,224\nI've got a server and I've got\nserver manager opened up currently.\n\n5\n00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:21,278\nAs we can see, there are no roles\ninstalled on it currently and\n\n6\n00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,392\nwe're going to take this server and\nmake it a Hyper-V server so\n\n7\n00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,551\nwe can use it to host\nour virtual machines.\n\n8\n00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:30,987\nSo I'm going to pull up PowerShell, and\nas we've seen in previous segments,\n\n9\n00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:34,838\nthe installing of the role,\nis a pretty straight forward command.\n\n10\n00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:40,144\nIt's gonna be, install-windowsfeature and\n\n11\n00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:45,581\nthe name of the role that\nwe're trying to install\n\n12\n00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:50,636\nis going to be a Hyper-V, so name Hyper-V.\n\n13\n00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:56,580\nAnd then I have to decide whether or not\nI want to include the management tools,\n\n14\n00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,377\nwhich I'm going to try to\nspell a little bit better\n\n15\n00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:10,794\nThey include those management tools, and\nHyper-V is one of the roles that's going\n\n16\n00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:13,250\nto require a restart to\nfinish the installation.\n\n17\n00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,570\nSo, I am going to include\na restart perimeter\n\n18\n00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,700\nwhich will force that machine to restart\non the completion of this command.\n\n19\n00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,580\nSo, I'll go ahead and run that command.\n\n20\n00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,790\nIt's gonna collect the data and\nit's gonna begin installing that role.\n\n21\n00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,836\nSo that you guys don't\nhave to sit here and\n\n22\n00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:31,656\nwatch the progress bar go across the\nscreen, we'll take a quick TV time out.\n\n23\n00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:33,823\nWe come back the server\nwill have rebooted and\n\n24\n00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:37,313\nwe'll verify that Hyper-V has been\ninstalled so we'll be right back.\n\n25\n00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:43,241\n[SOUND] [SOUND] All right,\nand through the magic of TV,\n\n26\n00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:47,160\nthat was the fastest reboot ever.\n\n27\n00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,608\nSo if we take a look at my screen now,\nwe’ve installed that role, the server is\n\n28\n00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:54,404\nrebooted, and I’m gonna open up PowerShell\njust to make sure everything went well.\n\n29\n00:01:54,404 --> 00:01:57,970\nCouple ways we could verify\nthat that role was installed.\n\n30\n00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,592\nOne of them is gonna check on the service,\nsee we’ll do a get-service.\n\n31\n00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,375\nI'm really having a hard\ntime typing today.\n\n32\n00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,565\nget-service, the name of that service\nis VMMS and there I already can see\n\n33\n00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:15,130\nthe Hyper-V Virtual Machine Management\nservice is running, so that's a good sign.\n\n34\n00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,302\nThe other thing I can do is a get-vmhost.\n\n35\n00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:24,750\nAnd that should tell me about the physical\nmachine that I've installed this role on.\n\n36\n00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,700\nThere I can see the name of\nthe machine is actually VMHOST,\n\n37\n00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,940\nwe did that intentionally.\n\n38\n00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,080\nIt's got a couple logical processors\nthere, I can see its memory capabilities.\n\n39\n00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,631\nAnother command I could run that's not\ngonna be so exciting just yet is get-vm.\n\n40\n00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,908\nWe'll run this one in a segment coming up,\n\n41\n00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:42,330\nbecause right now I have\nno virtual machine.\n\n42\n00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,710\nWe just installed Hyper-V, so I don't\nreally have anything to look at there.\n\n43\n00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,760\nAnother command I could do would be a\nget-command, especially useful when we're\n\n44\n00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,675\ngetting familiar with Hyper-V and what\nI can do with Hyper-V from PowerShell.\n\n45\n00:02:56,675 --> 00:03:04,234\nSo I do a get-command -module, and the\nname of that module is gonna be hyper-v.\n\n46\n00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:07,990\nAnd you can see there's quite a few\ncommands that I can use to manipulate\n\n47\n00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,435\nthe physical server you know the virtual\nmachine host itself the virtual machines,\n\n48\n00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,910\nthe virtual switches.\n\n49\n00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,929\nEverything associated with managing and\nmaintaining these virtual machines.\n\n50\n00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:21,694\nNow the one thing I want to point out\nis these commands became available with\n\n51\n00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:22,785\nPowerShell 3.0.\n\n52\n00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:27,678\nThat's when they added the module for\nHyper-V to give us the ability to work\n\n53\n00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:31,130\nwith the Hyper-V server\nfrom my PowerShell prompt.\n\n54\n00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,300\nSo, in this segment,\nwe installed the role Hyper-V.\n\n55\n00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,140\nGot that installed,\nverified that was installed.\n\n56\n00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,875\nIn future segments coming up, we're gonna\ntake a look at all of the things we can do\n\n57\n00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,710\nwith our Hyper-V server,\nnow that we've got it installed.\n\n58\n00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,670\nWe'll take a look at creating some virtual\nswitches, creating some virtual machines\n\n59\n00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,450\nand then managing and\nmaintaining those virtual machines.\n\n60\n00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,651\nSo you guys stay tuned,\nmore PowerShell coming up.\n\n61\n00:03:55,651 -->

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,441\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,882\nIn this segment, we're gonna take a look\nat how we can use PowerShell to create\n\n3\n00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:16,560\nvirtual machines and manage those\nvirtual machines on a Hyper-V server.\n\n4\n00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,750\nSo let's dive in and see what we've got.\n\n5\n00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,150\nFirst thing I'm gonna do is we're gonna\ngo ahead and create a virtual machine.\n\n6\n00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,800\nIn a previous segment I've\ninstalled Hyper-V on this server.\n\n7\n00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,050\nSo I’ve got a brand new Hyper-V server,\nnothing created yet.\n\n8\n00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,190\nNow I did do a little\nbit behind the scenes.\n\n9\n00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,310\nWe’re gonna take a look at another segment\nat how I can create my virtual switches\n\n10\n00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,495\nthat we use to network these\nvirtual machines together, and\n\n11\n00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:41,165\nwith our physical network in\nour corporate environment.\n\n12\n00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:42,835\nI'm gonna save that for\nanother segment, so\n\n13\n00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:47,785\nI precreated a switch that I can use\nwhen I create these virtual machines.\n\n14\n00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:51,090\nSo let's take a look at the command and\nhow we can create some virtual machines.\n\n15\n00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,132\nThe syntax is relatively straight forward.\n\n16\n00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:58,762\nIt's going to be new-vm is\nthe command that we're gonna use.\n\n17\n00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:02,785\nAnd I can do it a couple of different\nways, we can do new-vm and then just\n\n18\n00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:07,430\ngive it a name and hit enter and you'll\nsee it actually created a virtual machine.\n\n19\n00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,196\nNow I've used all of my defaults.\n\n20\n00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:12,136\nIf I was to go into my Hyper-V settings,\nI've got my defaults for\n\n21\n00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:15,342\nwhere it's going to create the virtual\nmachine configuration files,\n\n22\n00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,725\nwhere it's gonna create, in fact,\nthis one didn't create a hard drive.\n\n23\n00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:21,691\nI didn't specify to create\na hard drive in the command,\n\n24\n00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,670\nI didn't attach an existing\nhard drive in the command.\n\n25\n00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,300\nAnd if you think to the GUI, right, if you\ngo back to the wizard cuz most of us have\n\n26\n00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,980\ngone through the wizard at this point.\n\n27\n00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,720\nWe're now moving on to using PowerShell,\nwe can start automating this,\n\n28\n00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,870\nget a little more powerful.\n\n29\n00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,879\nThink about the options that you had\nto choose when you're creating a new VM\n\n30\n00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,666\nthrough the wizard, right,\ninside the graphical user interface.\n\n31\n00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,882\nYou gotta specify the name and\nthe location.\n\n32\n00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:46,940\nWell, since I didn't specify, I gave it\na name, it used all my default locations.\n\n33\n00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,640\nI didn't attach a virtual hard drive.\n\n34\n00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,330\nSo it just left it.\n\n35\n00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,539\nIt does not have a virtual\nhard drive at this point.\n\n36\n00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,931\nSo not the most useful command, right?\n\n37\n00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:57,149\nJust wanted to show you that you\ncould do that and then go back and\n\n38\n00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,050\nadd the rest of it later.\n\n39\n00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,530\nNext I wanna show you a command where I\nactually specify a few more parameters,\n\n40\n00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,590\nmake it a more useful virtual machine.\n\n41\n00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,400\nI'm gonna start out the same, new-vm.\n\n42\n00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,320\nI'm gonna give this\nvirtual machine a name.\n\n43\n00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,421\nI'm gonna call it something like web01,\nkeep it nice and short.\n\n44\n00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:17,169\nNext parameter I'm gonna use,\n\n45\n00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:20,413\nI'm gonna specify how much\nmemory it has when it starts up.\n\n46\n00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:24,443\nAnd the parameter for that is gonna be\n\n47\n00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:30,167\n-MemoryStartupBytes, -MemoryStartupBytes.\n\n48\n00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:34,252\nI'll go ahead and\ngive this guy 2048, a couple gigs.\n\n49\n00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:37,663\nAll right, and\nthat's gonna be in megabytes, and\n\n50\n00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:40,380\nthen I'm gonna attach it to a network.\n\n51\n00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,970\nNow again,\nI've already created this network,\n\n52\n00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,530\nI'll show you how to create those\nnetworks in a later segment.\n\n53\n00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,280\nSo the parameter's gonna be -SwitchName,\n-SwitchName,\n\n54\n00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,870\nand the one I created was called lan,\nor I just called it lan for short.\n\n55\n00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,652\nAnd then I can do a -NewVHDPath,\n-NewVHDPath,\n\n56\n00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:08,271\nand I'll specify where\nI wanna create that.\n\n57\n00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,556\nRemember when you configure your Hyper-V\nserver you can specify what your default\n\n58\n00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:14,402\nlocations are for creating these.\n\n59\n00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,909\nAnd then you don't have to provide these,\nbut if you want to create it in\n\n60\n00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,534\nan alternate location, you can provide\nthis parameter in the command and\n\n61\n00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,920\nyou can use that alternate location.\n\n62\n00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,106\nFor me, I'm gonna do c:\\,\nI think I made a folder called virtuals.\n\n63\n00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,198\nYeah, I did.\n\n64\n00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:34,610\nI'll just dump it in there, and\nthen I'm gonna give that disc a name.\n\n65\n00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:40,260\nI'm going to call it webo1-disc1 and\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n66\n00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,441\nmake that a vhdx, that new generation, and\n\n67\n00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:48,063\nthen the size is -NewVHDSizeBytes.\n\n68\n00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:51,709\nSo, -NewVHDSizeBytes.\n\n69\n00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:57,701\nAnd I'm going to make\nthis one 64GB in size.\n\n70\n00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,363\nGo ahead and hit Enter.\n\n71\n00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:03,990\nNow if I didn't make any crazy typos\nit should create that machine.\n\n72\n00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,106\nNow, in this case, it created what we'd\ncall a dynamically expanding drive, right?\n\n73\n00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:10,644\nYou guys have gone through the episodes\nhopefully where we've talked\n\n74\n00:04:10,644 --> 00:04:12,332\nabout Hyper-V and virtual machines before.\n\n75\n00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:17,395\nIt creates a dynamically expanding drive,\nmeaning it's not actually 64 gigabytes.\n\n76\n00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:22,175\nIt completed almost immediately, so\nright now it's about 4 megs in size and\n\n77\n00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:24,244\nit'll grow as I add data to them.\n\n78\n00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:28,127\nWhen I install my operating system, when\nI configure it, when I add files to it,\n\n79\n00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:29,051\nthings like that.\n\n80\n00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:32,812\nThat drive will expand to\na maximum of 64 gigabytes.\n\n81\n00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:36,379\nSo, that's really what I'm specifying\nthere, is the max size for\n\n82\n00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,954\nthat dynamically expanding drive,\nall right.\n\n83\n00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:41,738\nSo, now I've got a virtual\nmachine that we can work with and\n\n84\n00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:44,816\nlet's take a look at a couple of\nthe commands I might use for that.\n\n85\n00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:48,635\nThe first one,\none I find very useful is just Get-VM.\n\n86\n00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:51,497\nNow if I do a get-vm,\nwe saw that a previous segment, and\n\n87\n00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:54,460\nI didn't have any virtual\nmachines at that point.\n\n88\n00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,330\nNow that I've got a virtual machine,\nor a couple of virtual machines,\n\n89\n00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,450\nI can see a little bit of information\nabout those virtual machines.\n\n90\n00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,360\nI've got one called test, I've got one\ncalled web01, both of them are currently\n\n91\n00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,470\nturned off so they're not using any\nCPU and they're not using any memory.\n\n92\n00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,730\nReal quick easy command,\n\n93\n00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,210\nthough, if I need to take a look at any\nof my Hyper-V servers, and see which\n\n94\n00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,690\none of my machines is soaking up a lot\nof my resources, easy command to use.\n\n95\n00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,750\nNow, I can get a little more\nspecific with that command.\n\n96\n00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,771\nWe can take that get-vm command,\n\n97\n00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:26,315\nadd the name of a particular virtual\nmachine that I wanna get information on.\n\n98\n00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,197\nAnd if I just do it like that\nI get the same information,\n\n99\n00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:33,395\nit's just filtered to that one machine,\nwhich could be handy if you have dozens\n\n100\n00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:35,986\nof machines and\nyou want to see a particular one.\n\n101\n00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:39,980\nYou can also use wildcards in here,\nwhich is another very handy thing to do.\n\n102\n00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,984\nLike if I had several web servers and\nalso additional servers as well.\n\n103\n00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:49,714\nIf I wanted to see just some information\nabout the web servers, I had web01,\n\n104\n00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,866\nweb01, web03,\nI could do a get-vm web *, and\n\n105\n00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:56,660\nI would see just the virtual\nmachines I started with web.\n\n106\n00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,090\nSo very handy there.\n\n107\n00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,686\nAnd another command,\nwhat I like to do, though,\n\n108\n00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:01,740\nis I want a little more information\nabout that virtual machine.\n\n109\n00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,782\nI want to see what some\nof the configuration is.\n\n110\n00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:07,530\nLike in the GUI if we were to go in and\nright-click on our virtual machine and\n\n111\n00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,460\nchoose settings and\npull up that settings page.\n\n112\n00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,530\nI could do that here by\npiping out the get-vm,\n\n113\n00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,020\nname of the virtual machine,\npipe that into a select all.\n\n114\n00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,786\nI'll just do a select and\nthen an asterisk, and\n\n115\n00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:25,867\nI should get all that information or\nthe majority of the information,\n\n116\n00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:28,789\na lot of the information I'm looking for\nanyway.\n\n117\n00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,212\nLike I can see the current\nstate is that it's off.\n\n118\n00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:35,630\nI can see memory assign,\nit's not turned on right now so\n\n119\n00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,740\nit's not really using any resources.\n\n120\n00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,166\nWhere the snapshots are going,\nwhat my automatic start and\n\n121\n00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,130\nstop action is, things like that.\n\n122\n00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,550\nAnd all of these parameters can be set\nthrough PowerShell using a set-vm command,\n\n123\n00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,130\nright.\n\n124\n00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,910\nAnd then we can use\nthe name of the parameter.\n\n125\n00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,939\nFor example, let's say I want to\nchange the number of processors.\n\n126\n00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,625\nI can see right here, this virtual\nmachine has a processor count of one.\n\n127\n00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,144\nAll right.\n\n128\n00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:06,926\nSo if I wanna give it another processor,\nI can do a Set-VMProcessor.\n\n129\n00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,492\nAll right, so I'm specifying that\nattribute that I'm trying to change on\n\n130\n00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:14,251\nthat virtual machine, Set-VMProcessor.\n\n131\n00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:16,169\nAnd the name of that is web01,\n\n132\n00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,872\nthe machine I'm trying to make\nthe configuration change to.\n\n133\n00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,579\nAnd we'll set that to a -Count of 2,\n\n134\n00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:26,396\nI'm assuming I have a couple\nprocessors available.\n\n135\n00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:28,637\nIt should take care of that.\n\n136\n00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:34,016\nIt doesn't give me a lot of information\nback, so I could run another get-vm web01,\n\n137\n00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:37,570\nwe'll just pipe that out into\na select all or a select *.\n\n138\n00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,630\nAnd now I can see the number\nof processors is up to 2.\n\n139\n00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:47,370\nSo I was able to modify a configuration\nsetting on that virtual machine\n\n140\n00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,640\nvia PowerShell.\n\n141\n00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,981\nAnother one that you might find\nuseful in the production environment,\n\n142\n00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:59,015\ndon't usually use the dynamic memory.\n\n143\n00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:00,424\nBut in a test environment,\n\n144\n00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:03,925\nI really like the dynamic memory\nbecause it's a test environment.\n\n145\n00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,958\nI'm not looking for extreme performance.\n\n146\n00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,635\nI want to be able to fire up as many\nmachines as I can at the same time so\n\n147\n00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:13,565\nI'll typically use this dynamic memory but\njust so you guys know how.\n\n148\n00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:19,432\nSet-VMMemory and then the name of\nthe server I'm setting that memory on,\n\n149\n00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:24,726\nweb01, the parameter of that one is\ngoing to be -DynamicMemoryEnabled,\n\n150\n00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:27,300\n-DynamicMemoryEnabled.\n\n151\n00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:34,610\nAnd I'm just going to set that to a $true,\nhit Enter, and we are good to go.\n\n152\n00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,660\nSo more commands that we might use with\na virtual machine once we've got them\n\n153\n00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,205\ncreated, the ability to start and\nstop the VM.\n\n154\n00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:44,550\nLike this, now, I don't have an operating\nsystem installed on this machine yet.\n\n155\n00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,990\nWe just created it.\n\n156\n00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,409\nBut I can go ahead and start the VM or\nattempt to start the VM anyway.\n\n157\n00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:56,308\nWe're going to a start-vm, and then the\nname of the VM I'm trying to start, web01.\n\n158\n00:08:56,308 --> 00:09:00,310\nAnd it'll fire the machine up, I mean,\nthe virtual machine will start, right,\n\n159\n00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,113\nit's just not going to go anywhere.\n\n160\n00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:05,247\nIt's going to come to that screen and\nsay no boot device detected, right,\n\n161\n00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:08,830\nbecause I don't have anything\ninstalled on that particular machine.\n\n162\n00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,978\nIf I go back and\nget some status on that machine,\n\n163\n00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:16,780\nI can see that it is currently running and\nit is using the two gigs of memory\n\n164\n00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,126\nthat I assigned to it when\nI created that machine.\n\n165\n00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,100\nUptime 14 seconds.\n\n166\n00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,623\nWoo hoo!\n\n167\n00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:24,747\nIt’s like a record for\na Microsoft machine.\n\n168\n00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:31,640\nAll right, so then if I wanna stop that,\nthe command is simply stop-vm.\n\n169\n00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,030\nAnd then the name of the VM\nthat I'm trying to stop.\n\n170\n00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,320\nYes to actually stop that guy.\n\n171\n00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,650\nOh, you know what?\n\n172\n00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,440\nI haven't installed\nthe integration services.\n\n173\n00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,720\nIt'll stop it anyway, it's just warning me\nthere that it's not gonna be a graceful\n\n174\n00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,630\nshutdown because I haven't\ninstalled the integration services.\n\n175\n00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,310\nThere's no operating system on\nthe virtual machine yet, so\n\n176\n00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,120\nI can't really install\nthose integration services.\n\n177\n00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,820\nSo there we get to see how to stop and\nstart that guy.\n\n178\n00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,620\nThe other nice thing about that,\nremember I said we could use wildcards.\n\n179\n00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,730\nWe can use wildcards in\nthis command as well.\n\n180\n00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,491\nSo if I have five webservers,\nweb01, 2, 3, 4,\n\n181\n00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:10,200\nand 5, I could do a start-vm web*.\n\n182\n00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,600\nAnd that would fire up all five of those\nmachines, or you could do the same thing\n\n183\n00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,720\nif you wanted to shut them all down, or\nyou can shut every virtual machine down.\n\n184\n00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,590\nYou can do a start-vm, or a stop-vm,\n\n185\n00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,720\nand an asterisk with no name at all,\nand that will start or\n\n186\n00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,470\nstop all of the virtual machines that\nare residing on that Hyper-V host.\n\n187\n00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,070\nAll right so in this segment, oh, and\nI didn't, let me delete a vm for you guys.\n\n188\n00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,530\nAnother thing you might\nhave to do is remove one.\n\n189\n00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,820\nSo the command is just simply\ngonna be delete-vm and\n\n190\n00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,940\nthen the name of that machine.\n\n191\n00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,700\nI'll go ahead and delete that test virtual\nmachine we created earlier in the segment.\n\n192\n00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,920\nSo delete-vm.\n\n193\n00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,398\nI say delete, I meant remove.\n\n194\n00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:52,989\nHow about remove-vm, and then test.\n\n195\n00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:57,751\nAnd it's gonna ask are you sure you\nwant to remove that virtual machine?\n\n196\n00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:00,723\nI'll say yes and it will be gone.\n\n197\n00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:03,682\nRemember when you're running\nHyper-V without a system center\n\n198\n00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:07,189\nconfiguration manager when you delete\na machine like that you're deleting\n\n199\n00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,460\nthe configuration files.\n\n200\n00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,682\nThe hard drive itself is\nstill going to be there so\n\n201\n00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,536\nsomething that you have to keep in mind.\n\n202\n00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:15,756\nYou have to go back and delete that\nfile if I truly wanted to get rid of all\n\n203\n00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:17,679\nthe components of that virtual machine.\n\n204\n00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,589\nAll right so\n\n205\n00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:24,517\nin this segment we've learned how we\ncan use PowerShell to manage Hyper-V.\n\n206\n00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,455\nWe took a look at creating\na virtual machine.\n\n207\n00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:31,080\nOnce we created a virtual machine\nwe looked at how we start and\n\n208\n00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,274\nstop the machine, make changes to\nthe configuration of the machine,\n\n209\n00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:38,772\nas well as remove the machine\nat the end of its usefulness.\n\n210\n00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:42,643\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed\ntoday's segment, stay tuned,\n\n211\n00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:44,936\nmore PowerShell coming your way.\n\n212\n00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:51,849\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:08,726\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,726 --> 00:00:11,989\nIn this segment, we're gonna use\nPowerShell to configure some virtual hard\n\n3\n00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:15,000\ndrives, for our virtual\nmachines on our Hyper-V server.\n\n4\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,018\nSo let's dive right in and\nsee what we've got.\n\n5\n00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:22,410\nGot our Hyper-V, in a previous segment\nwe installed a Hyper-V on this server.\n\n6\n00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,220\nWe also created a couple\nof virtual machines.\n\n7\n00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,020\nNow I'm going to take a look at\ncreating some additional hard drives.\n\n8\n00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,210\nSo the first thing I want to do for\n\n9\n00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,855\nyou guys is create a dynamic\nvirtual hard drive.\n\n10\n00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:36,765\nProduction environment, typically we don't\nuse these dynamic virtual hard drives.\n\n11\n00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:40,295\nBecause we lose a little bit of\nperformance when that drive has to grow.\n\n12\n00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:44,410\nWe can also run into some issues if\nwe over allocate that drive space.\n\n13\n00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,970\nAs they grow they might run out of space.\n\n14\n00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,470\nThey can also become\nfragmented as they grow.\n\n15\n00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,130\nBut in a test environment before I\nmove them to a production environment,\n\n16\n00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,540\nwe're just testing new technologies.\n\n17\n00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,780\nDynamic drives are very useful.\n\n18\n00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,810\nWhen we used that command earlier in\na previous segment to create a VM.\n\n19\n00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,010\nIt creates a dynamically\nexpanding drive by default.\n\n20\n00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,200\nIf I want to create a virtual\nmachine with a fix size drive.\n\n21\n00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,420\nI'd actually have to create\nthat drive ahead of time, and\n\n22\n00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,160\nthen attach it to the virtual machine.\n\n23\n00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,860\nI can attach it to that virtual machine\nafter I create the virtual machine.\n\n24\n00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,710\nOr I can attach it during the creation\nusing the command I used to create.\n\n25\n00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,510\nIn the VM or the virtual machine.\n\n26\n00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,190\nSo let's see how you do it.\n\n27\n00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,340\nThe command is just simply New-VHD.\n\n28\n00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,710\nAnd then where do I wanna\ncreate this virtual hard drive?\n\n29\n00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,800\nThe parameter for that is gonna be -Path.\n\n30\n00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,401\nAnd I have a folder, I believe,\nwe'll find out here.\n\n31\n00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:44,990\nNow, C:\\Virtuals\\VHD.\n\n32\n00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,560\nSo I'm going to drop it in there.\n\n33\n00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,660\nThat's where we keep all our virtual\nhard drives on our Hyper-V server.\n\n34\n00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,080\nAnd then the name of the drive\nthat I want to create.\n\n35\n00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,304\nSo I'm going to call this web01 -Disk2.\n\n36\n00:01:57,304 --> 00:02:01,690\nAnd I'll make it a VHDX,a\nsecond generation there.\n\n37\n00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,430\nAnd then the size of that drive I'll\nspecify with a size bytes command.\n\n38\n00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:10,080\nAnd I'll go ahead and create this one.\n\n39\n00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,720\nSince it's a dynamically expanding,\n\n40\n00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,710\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a 36 gigabyte drive.\n\n41\n00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,850\nSo I don't have to wait for\nit to be created.\n\n42\n00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,670\nI'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n43\n00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,000\nAnd there we see I have a new drive,\nweb01 -Disc2.\n\n44\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,260\nIt's 36 gigabytes, but\nit's a dynamically expanding drive.\n\n45\n00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,360\nSo right now it's taking up\nabout four megs in space.\n\n46\n00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:40,000\nIn fact, we flip over there,\nwe're up with that C:\\Virtuals\\VHD.\n\n47\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,220\nAnd we take a look,\n\n48\n00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,440\nthere's the disc I created in\na previous segment Web01 -Disc1.\n\n49\n00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,450\nAnd there's the one I just created,\nWeb01 -Disc 2,\n\n50\n00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,500\nboth of which are about four megs in size,\nbecause they're dynamically expanding.\n\n51\n00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,260\nThere's no data in there yet.\n\n52\n00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,840\nWe haven't installed an operating system,\nor anything like that.\n\n53\n00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,100\nAll right, so\nthat's our dynamically expanding disk.\n\n54\n00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,910\nThe other disk that we can create\nwould be a fixed size disk.\n\n55\n00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,810\nWhen we create a fixed size VHD, it's\ngonna go ahead and grab all of the space.\n\n56\n00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,150\nSo I created a 36 gigabyte drive.\n\n57\n00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,210\nIt's gonna go ahead and allocate 36\ngigabytes of hard drive space to that VHD.\n\n58\n00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,260\nThe command is very similar.\n\n59\n00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,374\nIt's new-VHD.\n\n60\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,716\nAnd we're gonna give it a path and\nI'll use that same path there.\n\n61\n00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:32,590\nC:/Virtual/VHD, and\nthen the name of this disk.\n\n62\n00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,472\nI'm gonna call it,\n\n63\n00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:40,391\nstick with my naming convention,\n\n64\n00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:46,336\nwe'll call it web01 -Disk3.VHDX.\n\n65\n00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:49,316\nAnd then I'm gonna add a parameter,\n-fixed.\n\n66\n00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:53,287\nThat's what's gonna change it from\na dynamically expanding drive,\n\n67\n00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:54,575\nto a fixed size drive.\n\n68\n00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:57,215\nAnd then same parameter for the size.\n\n69\n00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:58,015\n-sizebytes.\n\n70\n00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:04,245\nAnd I am going to just create\na three gigabyte drive.\n\n71\n00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,275\nJust so that I don't want to wait for\nit to create.\n\n72\n00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:08,727\nSo three gigabytes.\n\n73\n00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:09,227\nI'll hit enter.\n\n74\n00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:18,360\nCreates that virtual Hard Drive, notice\nit's taking a little longer to create.\n\n75\n00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,684\nIt's actually taking longer to\ncreate this 3 gigabyte drive,\n\n76\n00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:25,560\nthan it did to create that 36\ngigabyte in the previous command.\n\n77\n00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,850\nAgain, because that 36 gigabyte\ndrive was dynamically expanding.\n\n78\n00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,560\nIt starts out at 4 megs,\n\n79\n00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,540\nthis one is actually claiming the 3\ngigs of space on my physical disc.\n\n80\n00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,120\nSo we'll let this finish up, and\nthen I'll show you guys that drive.\n\n81\n00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,980\nWe'll do a little, we'll clear that\nscreen out and do a directory.\n\n82\n00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,400\nAnd I can see Disk3 is\nindeed 3 gigabytes in size.\n\n83\n00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,290\nEven though there's no data in there.\n\n84\n00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,460\nSo that's a fixed drive.\n\n85\n00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,910\nBetter performance because I don't\nhave to worry about it expanding in\n\n86\n00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,660\nthe middle of usage.\n\n87\n00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,030\nI don't have to worry about it becoming\nfragmented or anything like that.\n\n88\n00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,325\nBut I do have to have the space\navailable when I create the drive.\n\n89\n00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:08,430\nAnd it takes a little bit longer\nto initially create that drive.\n\n90\n00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,280\nThird type of drive I can create in\nHyper-V with my virtual machines,\n\n91\n00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,070\nis going to be a differencing disk.\n\n92\n00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,510\nDifferencing disks are when we want to,\nwe have a base drive, and\n\n93\n00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,850\nwe wanna keep that base\ndrive the way it is.\n\n94\n00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,650\nAnd we're gonna make a second drive\nthat stores all of the changes.\n\n95\n00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,380\nThese are, again,\n\n96\n00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,610\nsomething you're never probably gonna\nuse in a production environment.\n\n97\n00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,510\nBut, in the test environment,\nthey can be very handy.\n\n98\n00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,120\nI have a base drive for 2012 R2.\n\n99\n00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,660\nAnd I take that base drive,\nI set it aside.\n\n100\n00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,580\nAnd then when I create\nmy new virtual machines,\n\n101\n00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,680\nI create differencing drives based off or\nlinked back to that base drive.\n\n102\n00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,810\nSo, I can have several virtual\nmachines with their own hard drives.\n\n103\n00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,410\nTheir own distancing drives.\n\n104\n00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,950\nPointing back to that one base drive.\n\n105\n00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,670\nSo all the files that are in common,\n\n106\n00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,000\nthe operating system installation\nis on that base drive.\n\n107\n00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680\nBut when I create the differencing drive,\n\n108\n00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,590\nthat's the drive that I assign\nto the virtual machine itself.\n\n109\n00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,460\nAnd so when I give that server a name,\nadd roles to it, and things like that.\n\n110\n00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,850\nThose are stored in that\ndifferencing drive.\n\n111\n00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,640\nSo I could have more than one server,\ndifferent names, different roles.\n\n112\n00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,180\nAll pointed back to that one base drive.\n\n113\n00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,340\nBut as you can imagine, if I have four or\n\n114\n00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,130\nfive servers,\neach with their own differencing drive.\n\n115\n00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,070\nAll pointed back to that one base drive.\n\n116\n00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,850\nMy performance is gonna degrade, right?\n\n117\n00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,390\nI'm gonna have a lot of contention\ntrying to read that base drive.\n\n118\n00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,490\nSo again, nothing I'm gonna use\nin a production environment.\n\n119\n00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,470\nBut in a test environment, when I'm\nwhipping out a little test network and\n\n120\n00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,590\nI need to throw out three or\nfour servers real quick.\n\n121\n00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,310\nAnd I don't want to take up\na lot of space or a lot of time.\n\n122\n00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,210\nThey work fantastic for that.\n\n123\n00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,082\nThe command is gonna be new-VHD again.\n\n124\n00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:51,590\nSo new-VHD, and for this one,\na little bit different.\n\n125\n00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,820\nBecause I'm making a differencing drive.\n\n126\n00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,660\nI've got to tell it where\nthat base drive is.\n\n127\n00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,770\nAnd in Microsoft lingo, or at least in the\nHyper-V commands, the PowerShell commands\n\n128\n00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,910\nthat work with Hyper-V, they're\ngoing to call that the parent drive.\n\n129\n00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,580\nWe're going to do a dash parent path and\n\n130\n00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,610\nI'm going to tell it where\nthat parent drive is.\n\n131\n00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,190\nAnd just for giggles,\nI'm going to use the one we already have.\n\n132\n00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,320\nSo I go Virtuals, VHD.\n\n133\n00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,460\nAnd we'll just use that web01 -Disk1.\n\n134\n00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,300\nAgain there's nothing\ninstalled on that drive.\n\n135\n00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,590\nBut just to show you this command,\nand then the rest of the command.\n\n136\n00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,970\nSo that's where the parent\ndrive is going to be.\n\n137\n00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,560\nAnd then the actual differencing drive,\nmy path.\n\n138\n00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,820\nBack to the original command.\n\n139\n00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,130\nJust like when we created a fixed drive,\nor\n\n140\n00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,080\nwhen I created a dynamically\nexpanding drive.\n\n141\n00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,820\nI have to tell it where I\nwant to create this drive.\n\n142\n00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,360\nAnd I'll put it in the same place here.\n\n143\n00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:49,400\nWe'll just go C:\\Virtuals\\VHDs,\nand we'll give it a name.\n\n144\n00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,232\nAnd I'll call this one maybe web02\n\n145\n00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:58,920\n-Disk1.vhdx.\n\n146\n00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,690\nAnd the last thing I've got add\nis the perimeter differencing.\n\n147\n00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,810\nLet it know I'm making\na differencing disk.\n\n148\n00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,310\nHit enter.\n\n149\n00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,069\nLet that thing whirl and\ngrind for a second.\n\n150\n00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,730\nAnd then if I do another directory,\nI can see I now have this.\n\n151\n00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,348\nWhere'd she go?\n\n152\n00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,310\nweb02 -Disk1, alright.\n\n153\n00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,010\nIt's pointed back to that base drive.\n\n154\n00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,620\nSo if I was to create a virtual machine,\nand\n\n155\n00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,980\nassign a web02 -Disk 1\nto that virtual Machine.\n\n156\n00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,730\nAnything I did to that machine\nwould be stored in there.\n\n157\n00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,540\nThe operating system itself would\nstill be in that web01 -Disk1.\n\n158\n00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,070\nNot a good example here,\nwouldn't work out too well.\n\n159\n00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,190\nBut that's the idea behind\nthese difference in drives.\n\n160\n00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,240\nNot really gonna see those\nin a production environment.\n\n161\n00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,710\nGreat for test environments though.\n\n162\n00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,510\nAll right.\n\n163\n00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,400\nSo now I've got a bunch of drives.\n\n164\n00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,770\nI've got a couple of virtual machines.\n\n165\n00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,680\nHow do I attach these drives\nto those virtual machines?\n\n166\n00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,480\nThat's the next thing we're\ngonna take a look at.\n\n167\n00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,380\nAnd the command for\nthat is just gonna be Add-VMHardDiskDrive.\n\n168\n00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,324\nLet's do an Add- VMHardDiskDrive.\n\n169\n00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:10,700\nI've got to tell it the name of the\nvertical that I'm trying to attach this\n\n170\n00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,170\nhard drive to.\n\n171\n00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,390\nAs we'd use the VM name parameter.\n\n172\n00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,603\nAnd we'll say maybe web01.\n\n173\n00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:21,980\nAnd let's attach that second disk.\n\n174\n00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,080\nSo, I've got Web 01 for the name of\nthe virtual machine, and then -path.\n\n175\n00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,210\nAnd the path to the drive\nthat I'm trying to add.\n\n176\n00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,657\nSo Virtuals\\VHD and\n\n177\n00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:38,360\nthen web01 -Disk2.vhdx.\n\n178\n00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,230\nAnd then if I want to\nhit that one more time.\n\n179\n00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:49,710\nAnd change that to web01 -Disk3.vhdx.\n\n180\n00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:55,420\nSo, at this point I've added two\nmore drives to that virtual machine.\n\n181\n00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,100\nLet's see if we can see.\n\n182\n00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,700\nIf we do a get -VM web01.\n\n183\n00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,580\nAnd we pipe that out into a select all.\n\n184\n00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,870\nIt's gonna show me here.\n\n185\n00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,310\nLet's see if I can see the actual\ndrives that are installed.\n\n186\n00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,220\nAnd it does not show me the actual drives.\n\n187\n00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,830\nI see hard drive on IDE controller 0,\nhard drive on a controller 1, and at 1,1.\n\n188\n00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,611\nSo it shows me that there\nare three drives attached.\n\n189\n00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:30,676\nI can see 2 of them are attached\nto IDE controller 0.\n\n190\n00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:33,180\nOne of them attached to IDE controller 1.\n\n191\n00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,539\nIt doesn't really show me the names of\nthe locations of those hard drives there.\n\n192\n00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,560\nAlright so that is how we're going to\nwork with our virtual hard drives.\n\n193\n00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,090\nWe saw how we could create\na dynamically expanding drive.\n\n194\n00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,230\nWe saw how we could create\na fixed data drive.\n\n195\n00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,665\nWe also saw how we can\ncreate a differencing drive.\n\n196\n00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:55,580\nThen once we had those created,\nwe saw how we could go back and\n\n197\n00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,000\nattach a VHD to an existing\nvirtual machine.\n\n198\n00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,190\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n199\n00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,253\nStay tuned more PowerShell\ncoming up in just a few.\n\n200\n00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:07,630\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:07,963\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,963 --> 00:00:12,603\nIn this segment we're going to take a look\nat how we can use PowerShell to work\n\n3\n00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:16,070\nwith our virtual switches\non a Hyper-V Server.\n\n4\n00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,830\nLet's take a look at what we got here and\n\n5\n00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,320\nwhen we talk about our virtual switches in\nHyper-V we've really got three different\n\n6\n00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,160\ntypes of virtual switches\nthat we can create.\n\n7\n00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,030\nBefore, they recently switched\nover to virtual switches,\n\n8\n00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,620\nthey used to be called virtual networks.\n\n9\n00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,340\nI think by 2008 they started\ncalling them virtual switches.\n\n10\n00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,160\nBut there's really three\ndifferent types I can create.\n\n11\n00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,430\nI can create a,\nif I can remember their names.\n\n12\n00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,020\nYou can create a private virtual switch.\n\n13\n00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,660\nWhich is only gonna be used\nby the virtual machines,\n\n14\n00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,850\nthat are running on that Hyper-V host.\n\n15\n00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,790\nI can create an internal, virtual switch.\n\n16\n00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,780\nWhich will be used again by the virtual\nmachines running on that particular host,\n\n17\n00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,760\nas well as the host itself.\n\n18\n00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,620\nAnd then you can create an external,\nwhich would give those\n\n19\n00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,430\nvirtual machines that are connected to the\nexternal network access to the external\n\n20\n00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,260\nmedia into our local area network,\nthe rest of the corporate network,\n\n21\n00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,290\npossibly the Internet depending on how\nwe then have our network routed out.\n\n22\n00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,510\nSo lets take a look at the commands we can\nuse to configure those virtual switches.\n\n23\n00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,570\nI'm gonna pull up PowerShell,\nclear my screen a little bit.\n\n24\n00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,570\nAnd the first one I'm gonna do, the first\ncommand I wanna run is just to get a list\n\n25\n00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,990\nof what switches I already\nhave if I have any.\n\n26\n00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,458\nAnd the command is just\ngonna be Get-VMswitch.\n\n27\n00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,110\nAnd I can see I have one switch currently.\n\n28\n00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,400\nI've got one and it's an internal type,\nso that means it's going to be accessible\n\n29\n00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,370\nto the virtual machines as well\nas the host operating system, and\n\n30\n00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,190\nI've given it a name of LAN,\npretty straightforward there.\n\n31\n00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,392\nSo if we wanna create\na new virtual switch,\n\n32\n00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:55,372\nthe command is gonna be New-VMswitch.\n\n33\n00:01:55,372 --> 00:02:00,038\nI'm gonna give it a name, if I've got\nspaces in the name I am going to need to\n\n34\n00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:04,277\nlimit that if I can say that,\nI'll have to puts quotes around that.\n\n35\n00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:07,702\nFor this one I'm just going to call it,\nlet's see which one I wanna do first,\n\n36\n00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:08,978\ncan we create this private?\n\n37\n00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:16,760\nI'll call it Private LAN, just so we can\nsee the difference in our list here.\n\n38\n00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,280\nSo I'm gonna give it\na name of Private LAN, and\n\n39\n00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,240\nthen the switch type is\nreally where I'm deciding\n\n40\n00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,210\nwhether it's gonna be private,\ninternal, or external for this one.\n\n41\n00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,410\nI'll do private.\n\n42\n00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,260\nAnd then I can add notes if I want,\nI usually don't, but\n\n43\n00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,710\njust to show you that you can, we can do a\nnotes parameter maybe something like this\n\n44\n00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,650\nis an isolated network.\n\n45\n00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,750\nCould help other admins that\nare working on this Hyper-V Server.\n\n46\n00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,930\nSo go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n47\n00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,620\nAnd that will create a new,\nprivate switch-type named Private LAN.\n\n48\n00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,840\nSo if I go back and do another\nGet-VMSwitch, I can see I now have two.\n\n49\n00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,680\nOne called LAN that's internal.\n\n50\n00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,730\nA second one called Private LAN,\nthat is of the private switch type.\n\n51\n00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,550\nNow if we want to create\nan external virtual switch.\n\n52\n00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,410\nIf I want to give these virtual machines\nthe ability to connect with the rest of my\n\n53\n00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,550\nnetwork beyond the host that they\nare running on, so other computers\n\n54\n00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,770\non the network, or possibly the Internet,\nif we've got things routed out properly.\n\n55\n00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,120\nThe command for that is gonna be the same,\nwe're just gonna switch,\n\n56\n00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,630\nfor this one though, a little bit\ndifferent, because I've got to bind\n\n57\n00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,990\nthe virtual switch to a physical\nnetwork adapter in that machine, right.\n\n58\n00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,940\nSo it can have access to\nthe actual corporate network.\n\n59\n00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,440\nSo for that I need to know what physical\n\n60\n00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,010\nnetworks adapters I have\nin this Hyper-V host.\n\n61\n00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:00,995\nSo the command for\nthat is going to be Get-NetAdapter.\n\n62\n00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:05,330\nGet-NetAdapter, and I want to see\nwhat the name of these guys are, so\n\n63\n00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,300\nI'm going to do a -Name and then *, that\nshould return all of my network adapters\n\n64\n00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,530\nthat I have available on this\nHyper-V host, and I'll go ahead and\n\n65\n00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,325\npipe that out into a format list command\nand I can see that I have several.\n\n66\n00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:23,480\nI've got my vEthernet (LAN).\n\n67\n00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,190\nI've got my physical adapter there,\nEthernet.\n\n68\n00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,720\nGot a couple others in this particular\nhost that we're not worried about for\n\n69\n00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,260\nthis segment.\n\n70\n00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,060\nStudent Side, Test 1 and Test 2.\n\n71\n00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,580\nThe one I created earlier, though, or\n\n72\n00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,770\nthat private network is not in this list.\n\n73\n00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,950\nSo, again those are my\nphysical network adapters.\n\n74\n00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,560\nIf I was to go in my network connections\n\n75\n00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,870\non this particular host that's\nwhat I would see there.\n\n76\n00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,300\nSo now that I know I want to create one,\nI want to attach to that Ethernet.\n\n77\n00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,910\nAll right, so this network adapter\nhere is really the one I want\n\n78\n00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,250\nto bind this external network adapter to,\nor this external virtual switch to.\n\n79\n00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,712\nThe command to create\none starts out the same.\n\n80\n00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:13,260\nNew -VMSwitch and\n\n81\n00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:19,750\nI'm going to give it a name,\nlet's do a -Name.\n\n82\n00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,490\nAnd we're gonna call this one External.\n\n83\n00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,620\nBecause I'm very creative like that.\n\n84\n00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,220\nWe'll call it External and then\nthe adapter that I want to bind it to.\n\n85\n00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,360\nThis is where the command differs a little\nbit from creating that private or\n\n86\n00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,470\nthat internal virtual switch.\n\n87\n00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,120\nCuz I'm binding it to\na physical network adapter.\n\n88\n00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,850\nSo NetAdapterName is that parameter.\n\n89\n00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:52,820\nAnd then in my case it's named ethernet,\nand then if we think back to the GUI,\n\n90\n00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,710\nwhen you're creating a virtual switch\nlike this I can choose whether or\n\n91\n00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,360\nnot I want to allow the management\noperating system to have access to that.\n\n92\n00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,950\nSo I can throw in a parameter\ncalled AllowManagementOS and\n\n93\n00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,658\nI can set that to $true,\n\n94\n00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:13,940\nwhich will be the same as checking that\ncheck mark when I go through the graphical\n\n95\n00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,730\nuser interface now this is going to cause\nwhen you create a new external adapter.\n\n96\n00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,320\nWhen you bind something to a physical\nnetwork adapter, in that Hyper-V host,\n\n97\n00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,630\nthere is going to be a momentary break in\nconnectivity with that network adapter.\n\n98\n00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,170\nSo typically,\nwhen I'm remoted into a Hyper-V host and\n\n99\n00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,080\nI make one of these,\nusually remote desktop doesn't crap out,\n\n100\n00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,100\nit does not break it long enough for\nme to loose my remote desktop connection.\n\n101\n00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,740\nWe'll keep our fingers crossed here and\nsee what happens, so I'll hit Enter.\n\n102\n00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,437\nAnd we should see a little bit\nof a glitch there, maybe or\n\n103\n00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:51,900\nI might drop the connection altogether.\n\n104\n00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,690\nThere we go.\n\n105\n00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,420\nSo you saw that it did temporarily\ndrop my connection and\n\n106\n00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,890\nthen of course Remote Desktop attempts\nto reconnect there in the background.\n\n107\n00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,470\nIt reconnected just fine.\n\n108\n00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,510\nAnd I can see the results of my command.\n\n109\n00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,090\nThere's a new network, or\nvirtual switch, named External.\n\n110\n00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,610\nIt is of the external switch type, and\n\n111\n00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,900\nit is bound to my Gigabit Network adapter\nthat I have in that Hyper-V host.\n\n112\n00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,322\nSo if we go back and take a look now\nat that initial command that we run,\n\n113\n00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:24,350\nGet-VMSwitch, we'll see now I have\nthree different virtual switches.\n\n114\n00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,510\nI got an Internal virtual switch name LAN,\na private virtual switch named\n\n115\n00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:34,480\nPrivate LAN, and\nan external virtual switch named External.\n\n116\n00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,490\nSo in this segment we worked\nwith our virtual switches.\n\n117\n00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,660\nWe saw how we could create the different\ntypes of virtual switches that I'm allowed\n\n118\n00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,020\nto make within my Hyper-V Server.\n\n119\n00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,030\nWe created a private virtual switch,\n\n120\n00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,440\nwe created an internal virtual switch,\nas well as an external virtual switch.\n\n121\n00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,380\nThat was bound to a physical network\nadapter, in that Hyper-V host and\n\n122\n00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,570\nnow I can give my virtual machines access\nto the rest of the corporate network.\n\n123\n00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,369\nSo, say tuned,\nmore PowerShell coming your way.\n\n124\n00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:10,309\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,593\n[SOUND] In this segment, we're gonna\n\n2\n00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:09,320\ntake a look at using PowerShell to work\n\n3\n00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,207\nwith our snapshots on a Hyper V server.\n\n4\n00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:19,035\nSo our snapshots, or checkpoints,\ndepending on which book you're reading and\n\n5\n00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,885\nwhich version you're using.\n\n6\n00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:24,495\nWe started out calling them checkpoints,\nthey're now called snapshots.\n\n7\n00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:28,240\nYou'll actually see in our commands,\nthey still use both terms, but\n\n8\n00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,210\nthese snapshots or checkpoints are just\npoints in time that I can roll back to.\n\n9\n00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,560\nThey're really handy if I'm getting ready\nto make some major configuration change,\n\n10\n00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,160\ninstall some application on\nthe server that I'm testing, and\n\n11\n00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,980\nI want to have a roll back point.\n\n12\n00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,190\nIf something goes wrong, I want to\nbe able to roll that server back in\n\n13\n00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,380\ntime to before I started that operation.\n\n14\n00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,300\nNow again, this is another one of those\nthings that really are not recommended in\n\n15\n00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,320\na production environment,\nexcept for temporary use.\n\n16\n00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,570\nOnce you've created a snapshot or\na checkpoint, you can merge them back in.\n\n17\n00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,472\nThey are gonna cause some\nperformance degradation,\n\n18\n00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:09,480\nbecause they're basically\ndifferencing disks.\n\n19\n00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,900\nIn a previous segment,\nwe talked about differencing disks and\n\n20\n00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,790\nhow you have a base drive and then a drive\nthat stores all the changes that are being\n\n21\n00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,080\nmade so when don't effect\nthat underlying base drive.\n\n22\n00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,720\nSo when you read from that, when a virtual\nmachine reading from its hard drive,\n\n23\n00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,710\nit's really reading from\ntwo different VHDs, right?\n\n24\n00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,890\nAnd the more checkpoints I create,\nthose are gonna be the ADHD drives, and\n\n25\n00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,850\nit's just gonna cause,\n\n26\n00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,620\na degradation performance is\njust the best way to say it.\n\n27\n00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,020\nSo you really want to avoid using\nthem in a production environment.\n\n28\n00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,330\nIf you do have to create one,\n\n29\n00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,750\nthey're really good in test environments,\ncuz I'll take a server and\n\n30\n00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,175\nI wanna do something to it,\nI'll make a quick checkpoint, or snapshot.\n\n31\n00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,435\nI'll do whatever it is\nI'm trying to test out.\n\n32\n00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:55,095\nWhen I'm done, I just roll it back and\nI'm back to a fresh installer server,\n\n33\n00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:59,015\nif that's I took the checkpoint,\nand I can try something else.\n\n34\n00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:01,795\nIn a production environment,\nbecause of the performance degradation,\n\n35\n00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:05,705\nnot really recommended, but if you\nare getting ready to do some, like a major\n\n36\n00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:09,450\nWindows update that you're not sure,\nyou know, you haven't tested it out.\n\n37\n00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,670\nShouldn't be testing it in a production\nenvironment in the first place, but\n\n38\n00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,920\nassuming there was some reason you needed\nto do something to a production machine,\n\n39\n00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,900\nyou could create a checkpoint and\n\n40\n00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,160\nthen have the ability to roll back\nto that checkpoint if you needed to.\n\n41\n00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,890\nSo let's take a look at the commands\nthat we can use to perform that.\n\n42\n00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,789\nThe first thing we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna need to create a checkpoint,\n\n43\n00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:38,713\nand the command for\nthat is gonna be checkpoint dash VM.\n\n44\n00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:42,900\nThe name of the virtual machine that I\nam trying to make this checkpoint on,\n\n45\n00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,417\nwe'll do web oh one, and then you can see\nright in the middle of the command we're\n\n46\n00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,624\ngonna change our naming convention,\nnow we're gonna call it a snapshot.\n\n47\n00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:52,820\nThank you Microsoft.\n\n48\n00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,612\nSo snapshot name, and I'm just gonna\n\n49\n00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:02,717\nname it something like prior to update.\n\n50\n00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:04,200\nHit Enter.\n\n51\n00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,692\nAnd I don't have a web oh one, really?\n\n52\n00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,560\nOh, silly me.\n\n53\n00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,070\nThat is not the parameter; that\nis the name of the computer.\n\n54\n00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,450\nSo let's swap that up just a little bit.\n\n55\n00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,015\nLet's do a dash name, and\n\n56\n00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:27,740\nthen the name of the virtual machine, I\nwanna make that snapshot on is web oh one.\n\n57\n00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,110\nSo, there it creates that checkpoint.\n\n58\n00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,740\nIf I wanna see what\ncheckpoints are available,\n\n59\n00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,970\nI might have made several checkpoints,\nhopefully not, but,\n\n60\n00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,796\nwe can do a get VM, and now we're gonna\nchange over and use the word, snapshot.\n\n61\n00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:46,630\nSo, get dash VM snapshot, dash VM name,\nand we'll do web oh one again.\n\n62\n00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:53,300\nAnd, it will list all of the different\nsnapshots that I have available.\n\n63\n00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,330\nSo, I've made one snapshot for\nthis guy prior to update, and the date and\n\n64\n00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,330\ntime that that snapshot was created.\n\n65\n00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,700\nLet's make another one just for\ngiggles real quick.\n\n66\n00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,650\nWe'll call this one, I don't know,\nhow about something like after update.\n\n67\n00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,513\nWouldn't make a whole lot of sense,\nbut just for example for our lab here,\n\n68\n00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:14,797\nI'll create a second snapshot.\n\n69\n00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:19,707\nAnd now we'll have something\na little more exciting to\n\n70\n00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:24,840\nlook at when I do that get snapshot,\nour get VM snapshot.\n\n71\n00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,710\nNow you can see I have two\nseparate snapshots created,\n\n72\n00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,620\none prior to update, one after update.\n\n73\n00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,820\nSo that's how I can create\na snapshot in the first place,\n\n74\n00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,670\nand get a list of available snapshots.\n\n75\n00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,030\nThe last thing I want to show you for\nthe snapshots is how do I use them?\n\n76\n00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,840\nWhat if that update did cause a problem,\nand\n\n77\n00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,650\nI want to roll back to that point in\ntime before I applied that update?\n\n78\n00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:58,660\nWell, the command is simply\nrestore dash VM snapshot,\n\n79\n00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,500\nand then the name of the snapshot\nthat I want to really, and\n\n80\n00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,090\nthese parameters can go in either order,\nI prefer to name this VM first.\n\n81\n00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,000\nSo let's do VM name, and\nthat's gonna be web oh one.\n\n82\n00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:19,078\nAnd then the name of the snapshot,\nand that's gonna be prior to update.\n\n83\n00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:28,930\nAnd it will ask me if I wanna do this.\n\n84\n00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,050\nI'll say yes, Y for yes, and\nit's gonna apply the checkpoint.\n\n85\n00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,800\nNotice that I needed the name of that\nsnapshot in order to apply it, which is\n\n86\n00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,410\nwhy that get dash VM snapshot command is\nvery handy, cuz it lists those snapshots.\n\n87\n00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,411\nYou can also see this\nParent Snapshot Name in that command,\n\n88\n00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:52,652\nthe after update is like a chain,\nor a hierarchy, if you will,\n\n89\n00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:57,853\nI've got that base drive, and then I've\ngot that prior to update snapshot,\n\n90\n00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:01,076\nand then I've got that\nafter update snapshot.\n\n91\n00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:05,570\nSo all three of those are really\nrequired to run that virtual machine.\n\n92\n00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,600\nNow I've rolled back to that\nprior to update snapshot.\n\n93\n00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,552\nAll right, so there we saw how we can\nwork with snapshots through PowerShell.\n\n94\n00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:20,898\nAll right, we were able to create\na snapshot, get a list of the available\n\n95\n00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:25,510\nsnapshots, and roll back to\na previously created snapshot.\n\n96\n00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,150\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed this segment.\n\n97\n00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,070\nStay tuned.\n\n98\n00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,050\nMore PowerShell coming your way.\n\n99\n00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,569\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,022\n[SOUND] All right,\nin this segment we're gonna\n\n2\n00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:09,786\ntake a look at using\nPowerShell to import and\n\n3\n00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:15,214\nexport virtual machines\nfrom a Hyper-V server.\n\n4\n00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:19,327\nDuring the management of our Hyper-V\nservers we're gonna occasionally need to\n\n5\n00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:21,420\nexport those virtual machines.\n\n6\n00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,170\nCould be to create a backup of a virtual\nmachine or it could be to move a virtual\n\n7\n00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,740\nmachine from one Hyper-V server that\nmaybe we're decommissioning and\n\n8\n00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,140\nmove it from that server to a new server.\n\n9\n00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,242\nSo we need to be able to export these\nvirtual machines and then turn around and\n\n10\n00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:36,420\nimport them.\n\n11\n00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,970\nIf we had a problem with one we can\nimport that machine that we had exported.\n\n12\n00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,710\nOr, if we are, again,\nbringing up a new Hyper-V host,\n\n13\n00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,860\nwe could import those new virtual\nmachines onto that new Hyper-V host.\n\n14\n00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,550\nSo let's dive into PowerShell and\nsee how we can accomplish this.\n\n15\n00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,160\nFirst thing we'll need to do, is we need\nto export an existing virtual machine.\n\n16\n00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,657\nAnd the command is simply export-vm.\n\n17\n00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:57,350\nAll right?\n\n18\n00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,057\nNow we could do it where I\ndon't use any parameters.\n\n19\n00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:02,680\nRight?\n\n20\n00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,090\nMost of our PowerShell commands, we've\ngot a lot of parameters that we can use,\n\n21\n00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,700\nmost of them are optional,\nsome of them required.\n\n22\n00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,690\nThis particular command, the only thing\nI have to give it is a destination.\n\n23\n00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,510\nIf I don't specify a name of\nan individual virtual machine,\n\n24\n00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,830\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna\nexport all of the virtual machines.\n\n25\n00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,680\nSo in this case export-vm and\nthen D:\\ would end up dumping out all\n\n26\n00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,670\nthe virtual machines that existed on this\nHyper-V host to the root of the D drive.\n\n27\n00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,840\nAnd I would create a subfolder for\n\n28\n00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,940\neach one of those virtual\nmachines that it was exporting.\n\n29\n00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,810\nIn this case I just want to export\na particular virtual machine.\n\n30\n00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,100\nSo I am going to specify the name of\nthe machine that I'm trying to export.\n\n31\n00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,090\nThat's gonna be web01.\n\n32\n00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,470\nAnd then the path is\na little -path parameter.\n\n33\n00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,033\nAnd where I want to export\nthis virtual machine to.\n\n34\n00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:55,973\nSo export-vm, -name, web01, -path, and\n\n35\n00:01:55,973 --> 00:02:01,030\nthen the path or c:\\Exported, in my case.\n\n36\n00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,920\nI'm gonna hit Enter, and\n\n37\n00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,980\nit should begin the process of\nexporting that virtual machine.\n\n38\n00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,320\nNow while it's going through here,\none of the things I could have done,\n\n39\n00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,360\nthis process could take a little while.\n\n40\n00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,070\nThis particular machine,\nwe just built it in a previous segment, so\n\n41\n00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,500\nthere's really no data on the hard drives.\n\n42\n00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,890\nShouldn't take it very long.\n\n43\n00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,580\nBut in the real world,\nif you had a lot of drives attached, or\n\n44\n00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,340\nif those drives were larger,\nthis process could take a little while, so\n\n45\n00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,075\nthere is a parameter we can use -asjob.\n\n46\n00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:33,230\nIf I add a -asjob to this,\nit would run as a background process, and\n\n47\n00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,850\nI would be able to continue to work\nwhile this job was in progress.\n\n48\n00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,850\nSo we'll let this run for a minute.\n\n49\n00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,980\nWe'll let this machine get exported, and\nthen once it that has finished exporting,\n\n50\n00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,442\nwe'll go take a look at\nthe folder that it created.\n\n51\n00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:48,510\nIt's gonna export everything needed\nto run that virtual machine.\n\n52\n00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,350\nThat means the virtual machine\nconfiguration files themselves, the VHDs,\n\n53\n00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,740\nthe hard drives associated with it,\nif there's more then one hard drive,\n\n54\n00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,990\nit'll include all of those hard drives.\n\n55\n00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,620\nIt would also include any\ncheckpoints that we created.\n\n56\n00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,350\nThose would be exported along as well.\n\n57\n00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,360\nSo it exports everything I need\nto use that virtual machine.\n\n58\n00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,870\nNow one of the things that's new with\n2012 with this import and export process,\n\n59\n00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,640\nprior to 2012,\nif you could not import a virtual machine,\n\n60\n00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,580\nif it had not been exported through\nHyper-V in the first place,\n\n61\n00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,610\nnow it allows you to take any machine\nwhether it's been exported first, or\n\n62\n00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,795\nnot and import that virtual machine.\n\n63\n00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,015\nAnd there we go.\n\n64\n00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,730\nIt looks like my job is finished.\n\n65\n00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:40,050\nSo if I take a look in file explorer,\nI can see now in my C:\\Exported directory,\n\n66\n00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,270\nI have a folder called web01, and\nin there I've got my virtual machines.\n\n67\n00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,860\nThere's the actual virtual\nmachine configuration file.\n\n68\n00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,290\nI've got my virtual hard drives\nthat are associated with that.\n\n69\n00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,710\nNotice I've got three different\ndrives attached to that VM.\n\n70\n00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,010\nIt exported all three of those drives as\nwell as a couple of differencing disks\n\n71\n00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,680\nthat had been made.\n\n72\n00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,920\nSo a couple of snapshots that\nI made on a previous segment,\n\n73\n00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,870\nit exported those as well.\n\n74\n00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,370\nAnd then, the actual snapshot files.\n\n75\n00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,680\nWe had the configuration files for those\nsnapshots, the time stamp information,\n\n76\n00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,300\ninformation about the snapshot itself.\n\n77\n00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,340\nSo you've got the config file for\nthe snapshot and\n\n78\n00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,690\nthen you have the actual differencing\ndisks over here, the AVHDX files.\n\n79\n00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,230\nRight?\n\n80\n00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:27,020\nSo that's exporting a virtual machine\nusing PowerShell, pretty straightforward.\n\n81\n00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,590\nOnce I've got those exported,\nat some point,\n\n82\n00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,800\nI'm gonna wanna be able to import those\nvirtual machines back into Hyper-V,\n\n83\n00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,630\nwhether that's the same Hyper-V server or\na different HyperV server.\n\n84\n00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,270\nSo the command is simply\ngoing to be import-vm.\n\n85\n00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,290\nAs always, there are several\nparameters that we can use,\n\n86\n00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:54,330\nespecially with this import command, and\nI'll talk about a couple of them here.\n\n87\n00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,201\nPrimarily the one command that\nI really need is the -path.\n\n88\n00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,830\nRight?\nI have to tell it\n\n89\n00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,770\nwhere the virtual machine is\nthat I'm trying to import.\n\n90\n00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,360\nThere are some other parameters\nthat I could throw in there.\n\n91\n00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,710\nYou can throw in a computer name,\n\n92\n00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,073\nmaybe you're importing this\ninto a different Hyper-V host.\n\n93\n00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:14,435\nThe exported files are on this server, but\n\n94\n00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:17,320\nI wanna import them into\na different server on my network.\n\n95\n00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,400\nI can actually do a dash computer\nname to have that happen.\n\n96\n00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,920\nYou can choose whether or\nnot you want to move the files.\n\n97\n00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,090\nRight now, once I exported it,\nthe files, the hard drives,\n\n98\n00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,670\nthe configuration files, all those\nare located in that C:\\Exported folder.\n\n99\n00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,960\nI can allow it to register\nthat virtual machine in place.\n\n100\n00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,691\nIn other words,\nnot move the files themselves.\n\n101\n00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:41,144\nTypically, that's not what I want to do.\n\n102\n00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:42,690\nRight?\nBecause I exported it to that exported\n\n103\n00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,590\nfolder, I want to get it out of there and\nput it back in the default location.\n\n104\n00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,560\nIf I don't provide any information,\nthe default is to move those files, or\n\n105\n00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,520\ncopy I should say, those files back to\nthe default location for your Hyper-V.\n\n106\n00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,740\nSo if you took a look at your Hyper-V\nsettings, you can specify the default\n\n107\n00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,902\nlocation for the virtual machine\nconfig files as well as the VHDs, and\n\n108\n00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:08,630\nit's gonna use that information when\nit imports that virtual machine.\n\n109\n00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,340\nOr I could specify a different location.\n\n110\n00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,062\nI can actually tell it, hey, I wanna\nimport it, but I wanna store it here.\n\n111\n00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:15,260\nAll right?\n\n112\n00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,560\nSo I can leave it where it is, I can\ncopy it back to the default location, or\n\n113\n00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,000\nI can choose a different\nlocation when I import it.\n\n114\n00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,980\nI also have to worry about the ID that's\nassociated with that virtual machine.\n\n115\n00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,600\nBy default if I don't specify it's\ngoing to leave the machine ID.\n\n116\n00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,590\nSo it's going to be the same machine\nthat it was when I exported it.\n\n117\n00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,195\nI can actually generate a new\nID during the import process so\n\n118\n00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:42,900\nHyper-V will see it as\na different virtual machine.\n\n119\n00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,032\nIn other words I could import\nit more than once, and\n\n120\n00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:48,030\nI could give it a different ID each time.\n\n121\n00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,100\nNow, that doesn't handle\nthe Windows side of things.\n\n122\n00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,650\nWindows is not gonna be happy that you've\ngot two machines with the same name and\n\n123\n00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,930\nthe same configuration and all that.\n\n124\n00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,040\nYou still have to deal with that,\nbut as far as Hyper-V's concerned,\n\n125\n00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,777\nI could import that a second\ntime with a different ID.\n\n126\n00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:02,240\nAll right?\n\n127\n00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,530\nSo let's see how that process works.\n\n128\n00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,570\nSo I'm gonna do an import-vm, and\nthen I've got my path parameter.\n\n129\n00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,560\nI've gotta tell it where that machine is\nlocated, so I'm gonna do a C:\\ Exported.\n\n130\n00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,070\nAnd then in there,\nI've got a couple of machines.\n\n131\n00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,790\nI'm gonna try to bring\nin this ITProTV-DC2.\n\n132\n00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,250\nThis is one that I exported previously.\n\n133\n00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,230\nSo I found the folder for\nthat in the exported.\n\n134\n00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,650\nInside there, there's a code.\n\n135\n00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,085\nYou've got to tell it\nwhere the config file is.\n\n136\n00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:31,930\nRight?\n\n137\n00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,940\nWe saw just a minute ago,\n\n138\n00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,920\nwhen I exported that virtual machine\nit created several subfolders,\n\n139\n00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,920\none of the VM config files, one for\nthe VHD files, one for the snapshots.\n\n140\n00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,080\nWhen you import this, you actually\nhave to point it to the XML file,\n\n141\n00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,530\nor the VM config file.\n\n142\n00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,710\nSo that is gonna be inside that\nvirtual machines folder, and\n\n143\n00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,990\nthere's the name of that file.\n\n144\n00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,510\nIt's a big long GUID that's\nassigned to that virtual machine.\n\n145\n00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:02,620\nSo I've done my import virtual machine or\nImport-VM-Path, and I'm gonna say -copy.\n\n146\n00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,360\nSo that's gonna leave the exported machine\nwhere it is, but it's gonna copy these\n\n147\n00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,962\nfiles back into the default location for\nmy particular Hyper-V server.\n\n148\n00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:13,310\nAll right?\n\n149\n00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,510\nSo I should be able to hit Enter.\n\n150\n00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,160\nAnd, we will see what happens.\n\n151\n00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,580\nSo right now, it's examining the files,\nmaking sure that all the files necessary\n\n152\n00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,270\nto bring that virtual machine\nare in place, or that are readable.\n\n153\n00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,540\nMaking sure that here's one\nthat can really throw you for\n\n154\n00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,850\na loop, the network adaptors.\n\n155\n00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,180\nA couple of things you can do.\n\n156\n00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,850\nIf I try to import a virtual machine and\n\n157\n00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,525\nthe network adaptor that it was attached\nto when I exported it is not available.\n\n158\n00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:47,835\nLet's say I'm moving this from\nVM host 01 to VM host 02, and\n\n159\n00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:55,550\non VM host 01 I had a virtual switch\nnamed private LAN or something like that.\n\n160\n00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,060\nWell if I go to import that\nmachine on VM host O2 and\n\n161\n00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,310\nthere is no virtual switch called\nprivate LAN, it's gonna throw an error.\n\n162\n00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,650\nIt's not gonna let me continue cuz it's\nnot gonna be able to import the machine\n\n163\n00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,950\nand configure it properly.\n\n164\n00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,380\nSomething that is very easy to run\ninto especially if you had to rebuild\n\n165\n00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,550\nthe server and maybe you didn't recreate\nall the virtual switches first.\n\n166\n00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,970\nSo a couple of things you can do,\nfirst is recreate the switches.\n\n167\n00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,060\nRight?\nIf you've documented what virtual switches\n\n168\n00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,650\nyou had before you did\nthe export process and\n\n169\n00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,660\nyou know which ones it was attached to,\nthen recreate them.\n\n170\n00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,616\nGive them the same name.\n\n171\n00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:33,750\nThey don't even really have to be the same\ntype, internal, external or private.\n\n172\n00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,670\nIt's not looking at that.\n\n173\n00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,890\nIt's actually looking at the name, and\n\n174\n00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,210\nas long as it sees that name,\nit's gonna be fine.\n\n175\n00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,532\nSo recreate your virtual switches\nbefore you do your import process, or,\n\n176\n00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:47,585\ndisconnect the machine from\nthe networks before you export.\n\n177\n00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,760\nRight?\nGo into the settings or\n\n178\n00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,120\nuse PowerShell to detach that\nnetwork adapter, and then export it.\n\n179\n00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,020\nAnd then when you import it,\nit's not looking for\n\n180\n00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,370\nany particular network adapter, and\nyou can simply open up PowerShell and\n\n181\n00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,960\nattach it to one of your existing\nvirtual switches on that new VM host.\n\n182\n00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,050\nSo either way you wanna do it.\n\n183\n00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,410\nEither recreate the switches before you\nstart the import process on that new VM\n\n184\n00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,020\nhost, or detach the virtual machine from\nthe networks before you export it so\n\n185\n00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,760\nit's not looking for those networks\nwhen you go through that import process.\n\n186\n00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,570\nAll right?\n\n187\n00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,538\nSo this guy's running along, and\nagain, I didn't do it as a job.\n\n188\n00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,460\nSo I kinda have to wait for it to finish\nbefore I can really do anything else.\n\n189\n00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,010\nThere really isn't anything else to see\nother than it's gonna successfully import\n\n190\n00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,330\nthis VM.\n\n191\n00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,280\nThere are a couple parameter\ncommands that I do want to mention.\n\n192\n00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,940\nI want to, I'd like to show\nyou if this thing will finish,\n\n193\n00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,740\nbut the command is\nactually compare dash VM.\n\n194\n00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,620\nIf you ever have a problem\nimporting the virtual machine,\n\n195\n00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,430\nyou'll get a bunch of red\ntext on your screen here.\n\n196\n00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,821\nAnd it's not real specific\nas to what the problem was.\n\n197\n00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:55,820\nIt'll tell you that it failed\non the import process, but\n\n198\n00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,582\nit really doesn't tell you why it failed.\n\n199\n00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:03,352\nSo what you can do is you can turn\naround and run a compare dash VM.\n\n200\n00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:05,641\nAnd typically what I'll do,\nis I'll run it inside a variable.\n\n201\n00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:10,232\nIn other words, I'll assign the results\nof that command to a variable.\n\n202\n00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:14,671\nSo you can do something like dollar\nsign report equals compare dash VM, and\n\n203\n00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:19,110\nthen the path just like I did on that\nimport process to that XML file to import\n\n204\n00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,530\nthat virtual machine.\n\n205\n00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,350\nAnd it'll run through the process,\nbut it won't actually import it.\n\n206\n00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,250\nAnd you can then take that\ndollar sign reports variable and\n\n207\n00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,930\npull up some information, and\nyou can see what the actual error is.\n\n208\n00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:37,840\nFor example, if the network adapter, it\ncouldn't find a network named private LAN,\n\n209\n00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,080\nyou'll see that information in\nthe results of that command.\n\n210\n00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,051\nSo very handy and\n\n211\n00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:46,010\none to know because, like I said, normally\nwhen you import a virtual machine and\n\n212\n00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,880\nyou get that error, it really just does\nnot give you a lot of information.\n\n213\n00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,390\nThe information is there,\n\n214\n00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,910\nwe just have to use a different\ncommand to go get that information.\n\n215\n00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,900\nAll right?\nAll right, well,\n\n216\n00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,490\nthis is taking a little long.\n\n217\n00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,270\nIt's almost done.\n\n218\n00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,995\nWhat are we on.\n\n219\n00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:01,410\nWe're on.\n\n220\n00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:01,970\nI'm watching it.\n\n221\n00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,940\nYou can watch it go through here.\n\n222\n00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,720\nIt's doing one of the differencing drives,\nso\n\n223\n00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,710\nwhy don't we do a little\nTV timeout if we can.\n\n224\n00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,580\nAnd then when this finishes up,\nI'll come back.\n\n225\n00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,210\nI'll show you the results, and\n\n226\n00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,130\nthen I'll run through that\ncompare dash VM command as well.\n\n227\n00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,515\nSo, stay tuned, be right back.\n\n228\n00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:25,210\n[SOUND]\nAll right.\n\n229\n00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,370\nSo we gave that command\na little time to finish up.\n\n230\n00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,760\nNow we can take a look at the results.\n\n231\n00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,290\nBack here over on PowerShell we can\nsee that my command is finished, and\n\n232\n00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,810\nit tells me that it succeeded.\n\n233\n00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,370\nThe machine ITProTV-DC2 has\nbeen successfully imported.\n\n234\n00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,350\nCurrent state is off, so it's not running,\nbut its status is operating normally.\n\n235\n00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,490\nIf I do a little get dash vm command,\n\n236\n00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:53,200\nI can see there is my\nITProTV-DC2 listed in there, and\n\n237\n00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,960\nif I want to take a peek at the GUID\neven though this is a PowerShell show.\n\n238\n00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,481\nRight?\n\n239\n00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:01,040\nThere's ITProTV-DC2, and\nwe could start that machine up.\n\n240\n00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,260\nSo, there it is.\n\n241\n00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,520\nImporting a virtual machine\nthrough PowerShell.\n\n242\n00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,770\nNow the other command I wanted to run\nthrough before we wrap this thing up\n\n243\n00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,351\nis just the compare dash VM.\n\n244\n00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:15,240\nNot gonna be able to see a lot of results\nwith this one because I don't have any\n\n245\n00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,720\nmachines that are giving me errors, but\n\n246\n00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,660\nI wanna show you guys the command just\nin case you run into the problem.\n\n247\n00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,940\nSo the command, if I had gone to import\na virtual machine and I got a bunch of red\n\n248\n00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,080\ntext in my PowerShell, a bunch of errors,\nagain, they're not real specific, so\n\n249\n00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,994\nthe next thing I would do\nwould be a compare dash VM.\n\n250\n00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:39,020\nThe way I like to run this or\n\n251\n00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,050\nthe easiest way I find to run this is to\nstore the results of that in a variable.\n\n252\n00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:50,040\nSo we'll do a little report, $report =,\nand then I'm gonna do my Compare-VM.\n\n253\n00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,930\nAnd then the process of importing,\nthe -Path as C:\\Exported.\n\n254\n00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,850\nI've got a machine in there named web01,\n\n255\n00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,540\nand I'll go find his config files here\nfrom his virtual machine's directory.\n\n256\n00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,147\nAll right.\nAnd then normally I'd be doing a -copy to\n\n257\n00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:16,561\nbring that virtual machine in and\ncopy it over to the default location.\n\n258\n00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:20,840\nSo really I'm just, I'm doing the import\nVM command or parameters, but\n\n259\n00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,341\nI'm changing the verb over here to compare\ndash VM instead of import dash VM.\n\n260\n00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:29,955\nAnd then I'm storing the results of\nthis command nn a variable call report.\n\n261\n00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:30,970\nSo I run that,\n\n262\n00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,770\nand it takes a look at what would happen\nif I was to import that virtual machine.\n\n263\n00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:43,990\nAnd then what I can do is take\nthat $report.Incompatibilities.\n\n264\n00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,530\nAll right?\n\n265\n00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,970\nAnd we can pipe that out\ninto a little format table,\n\n266\n00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,180\ndo a little autosize on it or something\nlike that, and I would get my results.\n\n267\n00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,040\nNow in this case, there aren't any errors.\n\n268\n00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,698\nSo there's nothing really exciting to see.\n\n269\n00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:00,070\nThere's no information in that report, but\n\n270\n00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,890\nI wanted to show you that command cuz\nit can be a very handy one to have,\n\n271\n00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,250\nto be able to use if you're having\ntrouble importing a virtual machine.\n\n272\n00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,490\nAll right.\n\n273\n00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,025\nSo in this segment we've really,\nwe've taken a look at import.\n\n274\n00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:16,530\nWell we started really with exporting\na virtual machine out of Hyper-V.\n\n275\n00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,902\nThen we looked at importing\na virtual machine back into Hyper-V,\n\n276\n00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:23,870\nand we also took a look at a command that\nwe could use if we were having trouble\n\n277\n00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,250\nimporting that virtual machine.\n\n278\n00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,620\nIf we got some errors, how we could\nfigure out what was causing the problem,\n\n279\n00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,680\nwhat was preventing me from\nimporting that virtual machine.\n\n280\n00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,580\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n281\n00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,185\nStay tuned,\nmore PowerShell coming your way.\n\n282\n00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:45,284\n[SOUND]\n\n",
