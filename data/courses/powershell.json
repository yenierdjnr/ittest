00:00:16,130\nWhat we're doing is we're recording\na series of videos that are covering\n\n4\n00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,990\nhow to use the Windows PowerShell.\n\n5\n00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,400\nWe're seeing a bigger and bigger push\nfrom Microsoft use PowerShell for\n\n6\n00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,150\nall sorts of things, and the product's\nreally advanced over the years.\n\n7\n00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,890\nIt's wonderful for\ndoing things like automation and\n\n8\n00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,980\nscripting activities to occur in sequence\nthat you don't have to go through and\n\n9\n00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,130\ndo them over and over again yourself.\n\n10\n00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,440\nSometimes you have multiple servers\nthat you want to configure and\n\n11\n00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,010\nyou don't want to go and\ndo each one individually.\n\n12\n00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,770\nWe can write a PowerShell Script and\nit'll knock them all out for us in one go.\n\n13\n00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,340\nIt's really pretty cool.\n\n14\n00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,200\nBut it is a lot different than\nthe command prompt that we're used to.\n\n15\n00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,870\nOr maybe you're not used to\nthe command prompt at all.\n\n16\n00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,120\nMaybe you're an all GUI person,\nplenty of people are these days.\n\n17\n00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,700\nSo the Powershell can\nbe a little daunting,\n\n18\n00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,530\nand that's what this program aims to fix.\n\n19\n00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,510\nWe're gonna take a look at,\nwell, some of the basics first.\n\n20\n00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,300\nWe'll start out with just what the\nPowerShell is and how the interface works.\n\n21\n00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,300\nThe interface is pretty neat, and there's\nsome really cool tools and shortcuts that\n\n22\n00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,260\nwe can use just right in the basic\ninterface that can help us out a lot.\n\n23\n00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,580\nFrom there, we're going to start\nadvancing into other topics.\n\n24\n00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,530\nLet me show you the outline that\nwe've kind of worked up for this.\n\n25\n00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,000\nUnlike a lot of shows on ITProTV,\nthis show is not built around a particular\n\n26\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,620\ncertification, so\nwe're going freestyle here.\n\n27\n00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,340\nWe're basically adding whatever\nwe feel is appropriate, and\n\n28\n00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,440\nby we, I mean most of this is myself and\nour other host Mike Roderick.\n\n29\n00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,190\nWe've taken a look at the various\nPowerShell commands that we think most\n\n30\n00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,980\npeople need to know it to be prepared for\nthe exams and prepared for the real world.\n\n31\n00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,790\nSo, like I said,\n\n32\n00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,950\nwe're gonna start out right here with\nthe introduction to the PowerShell.\n\n33\n00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,480\nWe'll just go over some of those\nbasic commands, general syntax,\n\n34\n00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,770\nhow we can use the interface.\n\n35\n00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,900\nFrom there, we'll start to focus\non the more practical skills.\n\n36\n00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,720\nWe'll have a series of videos that\nare focusing on server management.\n\n37\n00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,833\nThese are generic tasks that\nare performed on every Windows server.\n\n38\n00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,457\nI might be adding roles,\nremoving features, managing services,\n\n39\n00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:04,660\nwhatever it is that we need to do as part\nof the day to day operations of a server.\n\n40\n00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,034\nThen we're gonna focus in on DNS, how to\nget DNS, domain naming system, configured\n\n41\n00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:14,020\non a server, and how to work with zones\nand other records all from the PowerShell.\n\n42\n00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,610\nWe'll proceed to DHCP,\ndynamic host configuration protocol, and\n\n43\n00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,080\nhow to manage it.\n\n44\n00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,150\nAnd then the big one, active directory.\n\n45\n00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,890\nI know it doesn't look that\nbig here in the outline, but\n\n46\n00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,620\nthere's actually quite a bit to it.\n\n47\n00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,520\nCreating the active directory,\nworking with user accounts,\n\n48\n00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,000\ngroups, organizational units,\ngroup policy objects,\n\n49\n00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,805\nall of that stuff that's buried inside\nthe active directory, you can completely\n\n50\n00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:37,785\ninterface with it via the PowerShell,\nand then we're going to tackle Hyper-V.\n\n51\n00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:40,265\nHow do you get Hyper-V installed?\n\n52\n00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:43,595\nHow to manage virtual machines,\ncreating them, starting, stopping, taking\n\n53\n00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:48,635\nsnapshots, all those other things that are\npart of the routine operation of Hyper-V.\n\n54\n00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,745\nNow, depending on when\nyou watch this show,\n\n55\n00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,740\nthere may just be these videos available.\n\n56\n00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,340\nBut if it's been a year or\n\n57\n00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,110\nhowever long, you may see that we have\nquite a bit more content than that.\n\n58\n00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,070\nAnd that's because this isn't based\naround an exam set of objectives.\n\n59\n00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,660\nWe're not waiting on Microsoft\nto tell us what to cover.\n\n60\n00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,090\nInstead, we're just figuring it out.\n\n61\n00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,460\nWhatever we feel like needs to be in\nthere we're throwing it in there.\n\n62\n00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,590\nAnd that means that if you have any ideas,\nif there was something you\n\n63\n00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,980\ndidn't see on that outline that\nyou want covered, let us know.\n\n64\n00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,370\nPost in the Q & A forums,\n\n65\n00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,510\nyou can just go right in there into the\nMicrosoft forum and post and say hey, Don,\n\n66\n00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,770\nI'd really like it if you did a section\non Microsoft SQL or Microsoft Exchange,\n\n67\n00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,500\nyou covered some of the PowerShell\nstuff that's available from those.\n\n68\n00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,230\nIf that's something that interests you,\ngreat, throw it on there.\n\n69\n00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,870\nIt's not on any of the exams\nthat our site prepares you for,\n\n70\n00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,610\nat least not yet, but it's something\nthat's useful to know and we'll do it,\n\n71\n00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,050\nwe'll film it and get thrown on there.\n\n72\n00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,140\nSo if it's not on the outline, just let\nus know, we'll work to get it added.\n\n73\n00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,333\nBut these are kind of the major ones.\n\n74\n00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,519\nThese are definitely ones that you need\nto know if you're getting ready for\n\n75\n00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,917\nthe 70-410, 70-411 and 70-412 exams.\n\n76\n00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:55,029\nAnd so we try to basically\nwrap all those together, but\n\n77\n00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:58,083\nwe're definitely willing\nto extend that as needed.\n\n78\n00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:02,034\nAll right, so that's what we're about to\njump into, and without further delay,\n\n79\n00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,625\nwe'll go ahead and get started.\n\n80\n00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:09,724\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
