[CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:06.937 --> 00:00:08.404\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:11.922\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:13.228\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:15.773\nAnd welcome back to another\nexciting episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.773 --> 00:00:16.764\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK].\n\n9\n00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:18.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:22.592\nAnd on today's episode, we are back with\nmore in our practical IT Security Series.\n\n11\n00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:25.224\nJoining us yet again, the waved-hand man.\n\n12\n00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:26.454\nWe like to call him Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:27.282\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n14\n00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:28.045\nHow's it going?\n\n15\n00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:29.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's going good, going good.\n\n16\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.995\nSo we're going to pick up where we left\noff with at the end of our last episode.\n\n17\n00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:36.950\nIf you saw, the Internet decided\nto take a small vacation.\n\n18\n00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.180\nWe've coaxed it back, so\nwe're reconnected into our lab platform.\n\n19\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.648\nWe're gonna just pick up where we left\noff, cuz we're in the middle of finishing\n\n20\n00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:46.508\nup our demonstration about how to\nlook at certificate templates.\n\n21\n00:00:46.508 --> 00:00:47.786\nThe properties and issue is significant.\n\n22\n00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:51.484\nSo join me back here and\nyou'll see we're right where we left off.\n\n23\n00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.352\nWe're on the Security tab.\n\n24\n00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:56.755\nWe were talking about the need to\nassign the auto-enroll permission to\n\n25\n00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.353\nthe authenticated users group.\n\n26\n00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:03.483\nAnd you see I've added the computer counts\nfor the domain controllers as well as for\n\n27\n00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:06.790\nthe machine that I'm issuing\nthe certificate from.\n\n28\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.235\nAssigned them\nthe auto-enrollment permission so\n\n29\n00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.745\nthey could work with\nthe certificate if necessary.\n\n30\n00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:12.617\nSo we've done all that.\n\n31\n00:01:12.617 --> 00:01:15.336\nWe're just gonna click OK here.\n\n32\n00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:19.962\nWe get our named template down there,\nWin10 Computer, or whatever it will be.\n\n33\n00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:22.445\nWe can see it right there.\n\n34\n00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:26.252\nAnd you can see that we can\nwork with the certificate.\n\n35\n00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.743\nWe can delete it, go in,\nmodify the properties if necessary,\n\n36\n00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:29.687\nwhatever we want to do.\n\n37\n00:01:29.687 --> 00:01:33.982\nNow that we've created the template,\nwe're gonna get out of this console,\n\n38\n00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:37.032\ngo back to our certificate authority,\nwhere we were.\n\n39\n00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:40.310\nIf we wanna bring that certificate in and\nmake it available,\n\n40\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.637\nright-click on Certificate Templates.\n\n41\n00:01:42.637 --> 00:01:46.522\nAnd when we go in, what we can do is\ninstead of manage which is where we just\n\n42\n00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:48.323\nwent to the properties, right?\n\n43\n00:01:48.323 --> 00:01:50.065\nNow what we're gonna do is go to New and\n\n44\n00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:52.414\nwe're gonna go to\nCertificate Template to issue.\n\n45\n00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:55.719\nSo this is how we pull the template\nout of the store where it was, and\n\n46\n00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.865\nwe're gonna bring it in and\npublish it to this list right here.\n\n47\n00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:02.653\nSo new certificate issue,\nwe just go grab our certificate by name so\n\n48\n00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:06.446\nwe're gonna go right down here\nWin10 down at the bottom, right?\n\n49\n00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:09.160\nOr whatever you called it or\nwhatever it would be.\n\n50\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.529\nClick OK, and\nyou'll see now we have our certificate,\n\n51\n00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.827\njust alphabetizing,\njust sorting so we could see it,\n\n52\n00:02:15.827 --> 00:02:20.146\nWin10 Certificate or\nWin10 Computer Certificate, right there.\n\n53\n00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:23.320\nSo now that certificate would\nbe available for us to leverage.\n\n54\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.308\nSo the next piece of the puzzle is hey,\nthat's awesome.\n\n55\n00:02:26.308 --> 00:02:28.299\nSo how do we actually get a certificate?\n\n56\n00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.880\nHow do we request one?\n\n57\n00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.801\nHow do we use all this great\ninfrastructure we just built in order to\n\n58\n00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:34.378\nbe able to actually put this to use?\n\n59\n00:02:34.378 --> 00:02:35.773\nSo glad you asked that question.\n\n60\n00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:37.051\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:39.005\n&gt;&gt; All of you knowledgeable\nfolk out there.\n\n62\n00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:40.371\nSo let's take a look at how we do this.\n\n63\n00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:41.304\nWe're gonna go in.\n\n64\n00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:45.892\nPull up our Windows 10 Virtual Machine,\nwe already got that up and running,\n\n65\n00:02:45.892 --> 00:02:50.616\nnow what I did was just log on on Windows\n10 work station as a user in the directory\n\n66\n00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:52.718\nin the domain user called Matthew.\n\n67\n00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:57.525\nI opened up created custom MMC.\n\n68\n00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:02.455\nNow what I did was simply loaded the local\ncertificate store on the machine so\n\n69\n00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:05.843\nwe could see it,\nsaved it in MMC just so I have it, and\n\n70\n00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:09.638\nI'm in the certificate store for\nthe local current user.\n\n71\n00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:13.310\nAnd I'm on the personal folder and\nyou'll see there's no certificates there.\n\n72\n00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.198\nAnd so what I'm gonna do right now is\nright-click, I'm gonna go to All Tasks,\n\n73\n00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:19.303\nand I'm gonna request a new certificate.\n\n74\n00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:22.527\nThis is how a user would,\nassuming they had rights of course,\n\n75\n00:03:22.527 --> 00:03:25.573\nwould be able to go in and\nmake a request for a certificate.\n\n76\n00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:26.879\nSo we're gonna do this.\n\n77\n00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.511\nWe're gonna get the little\ncertificate enrollment wizard.\n\n78\n00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:33.497\nWe're gonna go through, we're gonna make a\nrequest for a certificate, and we're going\n\n79\n00:03:33.497 --> 00:03:36.763\nto select a certificate template that\nwe can use to fulfill that request.\n\n80\n00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:40.664\nSo let's move this over,\ngonna go ahead, click Next here.\n\n81\n00:03:40.664 --> 00:03:44.334\nYou'll see that we have a certificate\nenrollment policy underneath there,\n\n82\n00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:47.728\nconfigured by our administrator,\nwhat certificates are available.\n\n83\n00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.781\nThe only one that's there by default\nbecause I haven't made any of the other\n\n84\n00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:53.703\ncertificates available yet,\nis Active Directory enrollment policy.\n\n85\n00:03:53.703 --> 00:03:55.394\nI'm pointing to it right there.\n\n86\n00:03:55.394 --> 00:03:57.886\nI can highlight that one.\n\n87\n00:03:57.886 --> 00:03:59.599\nIf I click just to bring it down,\n\n88\n00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.546\nI could see there's a little enrollment\npolicy ID set in the identifier.\n\n89\n00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:07.366\nAnd I could see Properties if i wanted\nto just look in there, in the subs so\n\n90\n00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:08.318\nyou could see it.\n\n91\n00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:11.085\nI'll see that I have\nthe general information for\n\n92\n00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:13.659\nthe template that's being made available.\n\n93\n00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.128\nReally nothing more than that.\n\n94\n00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:18.891\nit just tells me that it is a nailed app\ncertificate or certificates used for\n\n95\n00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.517\nActive Directory enrollment.\n\n96\n00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:23.011\nAll right, so I'm gonna click Next here.\n\n97\n00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:24.524\nHighlight this certificate.\n\n98\n00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:28.927\nGive that just a second.\n\n99\n00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:39.592\nAnd you'll see underneath here,\nThat I can go in, and you'll\n\n100\n00:04:39.592 --> 00:04:44.296\nsee that I have two certificates centrally\nthat I can make choices to select.\n\n101\n00:04:44.296 --> 00:04:48.402\nI have to check off a button here, or\nexcuse me check off a box, rather,\n\n102\n00:04:48.402 --> 00:04:52.589\nyou'll see that I have the ability to\nbasic EFS and or user certificate.\n\n103\n00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:55.805\nAnd I have choices around which one\nrequests the following types of\n\n104\n00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:58.170\ncertificates under this\nenrollment template.\n\n105\n00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.432\nSo essentially I have two\ncertificate options, right?\n\n106\n00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:03.466\nThe EFS certificate,\nencrypting file system, right?\n\n107\n00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:06.990\nWould be used for our ability\nto be able to encrypt files, so\n\n108\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.089\nI can use it to apply encryption\nto a series of files or\n\n109\n00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.840\ndirectories within the system and,\nor the user certificate.\n\n110\n00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.265\nAnd if I want to find out more about each\none, I see their status is available.\n\n111\n00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:18.354\nSo that's good.\n\n112\n00:05:18.354 --> 00:05:20.009\nBut you'll see that I can go.\n\n113\n00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.610\nAnd under details here,\nI can just pull down like I did.\n\n114\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.672\nAnd I can see a little bit more detail\nthan I did on the prior screen.\n\n115\n00:05:25.672 --> 00:05:29.872\nYou'll see here the following options\nscribe, in this case, uses in validity for\n\n116\n00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:31.495\nthis particular certificate.\n\n117\n00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:32.825\nAnd you'll see I have key usage.\n\n118\n00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:35.987\nI can use this for\ndigital signing, key encipherment,\n\n119\n00:05:35.987 --> 00:05:39.830\nmeaning I can use this to encrypt keys,\nbut also to digitally sign.\n\n120\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.330\nI can apply this to\nthe encrypting file system,\n\n121\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.404\nsecure email client authentication.\n\n122\n00:05:44.404 --> 00:05:48.955\nSo I could use this to encrypt files, but\nalso to do digital signatures for emails.\n\n123\n00:05:48.955 --> 00:05:53.597\nSo a variety of uses,\nvalidity period good for 365 days.\n\n124\n00:05:53.597 --> 00:05:55.081\nSo it's good for one year.\n\n125\n00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:59.359\nIf I look at the EFS certificate, just\nthe other one that's up there, you'll see\n\n126\n00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:03.400\nthat I have, in this case, just key and\ncipher in an encrypting file system.\n\n127\n00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.315\nThis one is more narrowly defined.\n\n128\n00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:09.221\nDoesn't let me digitally sign emails,\nbut it's really just for EFS.\n\n129\n00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:12.211\nWhereas the user one kinda encompasses\nthat plus digitally signing.\n\n130\n00:06:12.211 --> 00:06:14.557\nSo something of a broader certificate,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:14.557 --> 00:06:16.146\nSo I can use either one.\n\n132\n00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:17.963\nSo let's go ahead, you have a preference?\n\n133\n00:06:17.963 --> 00:06:20.315\nI'm thinking, which one would you like?\n\n134\n00:06:20.315 --> 00:06:22.727\n&gt;&gt; Let's go the first one.\n\n135\n00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:23.745\n&gt;&gt; The EFS1.\n\n136\n00:06:23.745 --> 00:06:24.729\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't see it.\n\n137\n00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:25.419\n&gt;&gt; You can't see it.\n\n138\n00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.023\nOkay.\n\n139\n00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:27.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Guys there's something up there.\n\n140\n00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:28.675\nWake up something.\n\n141\n00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:31.187\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; The one there, the one that's there.\n\n142\n00:06:31.187 --> 00:06:35.156\nI'm gonna actually go for the user 1, I'm\nonly because we want to be able to assign\n\n143\n00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:36.833\nit to the user account-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n144\n00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:37.374\n&gt;&gt; Matthew, right?\n\n145\n00:06:37.374 --> 00:06:40.386\nGive me user certificate but it will\nalready encompass all the EFS stuff, but\n\n146\n00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:42.859\nalso you have to see ability to\ndo the digital signing on email.\n\n147\n00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:45.952\nSo we're gonna go with that,\nbut we appreciate you playing.\n\n148\n00:06:45.952 --> 00:06:49.228\nThank you and here is your parting\ngift for being such a good sport,\n\n149\n00:06:49.228 --> 00:06:50.172\nappreciate that.\n\n150\n00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:51.477\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; You've got your token pointer.\n\n151\n00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:52.529\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK].\n\n152\n00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:53.069\n[LAUGH].\n\n153\n00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.364\n&gt;&gt; Here's your token private key.\n\n154\n00:06:54.364 --> 00:06:54.966\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n155\n00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:58.015\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose the certificate, or certificates.\n\n156\n00:06:58.015 --> 00:06:59.956\nWe could do both in theory,\nit wouldn't really matter.\n\n157\n00:06:59.956 --> 00:07:02.566\nWe're gonna choose,\nin this case our user one, right?\n\n158\n00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:06.674\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and select it,\nto check off, in other words, and\n\n159\n00:07:06.674 --> 00:07:07.827\nthen click and roll.\n\n160\n00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.163\nYou'll see it goes through,\n\n161\n00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:13.126\nassuming everything is good there's really\nno delay here at all happens immediately.\n\n162\n00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:17.060\nRemember, we set up the auto-enrollment\ncapability through the web enrollment\n\n163\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.492\ninterface that we selected.\n\n164\n00:07:18.492 --> 00:07:22.705\nSo by leveraging that on the certificate\nauthority we're actually able to request\n\n165\n00:07:22.705 --> 00:07:26.328\nthe certificate and have it show up\nright away, very, very easy to do.\n\n166\n00:07:26.328 --> 00:07:28.969\nAnd so it has been succeeded,\nand we could see,\n\n167\n00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:31.883\nwe'll see the certificate\nin the store in a minute.\n\n168\n00:07:31.883 --> 00:07:35.865\nBut we can pull down the details area here\nand actually see the certificate that has\n\n169\n00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:39.514\nbeen issued right from here, now that\nit's been issued before we finish.\n\n170\n00:07:39.514 --> 00:07:42.417\nSo if we go with View Certificate,\nlet me just move this up.\n\n171\n00:07:42.417 --> 00:07:44.653\nWhen we do this,\nwe do see the certificate.\n\n172\n00:07:44.653 --> 00:07:48.758\nWe see it was issued to Matthew Bernstein,\nthat's the alias I'm logged on under.\n\n173\n00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:51.062\nThen that's my undercover\nsuper secret name, right?\n\n174\n00:07:51.062 --> 00:07:51.746\n&gt;&gt; No, unaware.\n\n175\n00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:52.680\n&gt;&gt; Matthew Bernstein.\n\n176\n00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.271\nAll right, so\nPractice Labs PLABDM01CA is issuing it.\n\n177\n00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:58.099\nI'm getting it from my subordinate CA,\n\n178\n00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:01.918\nwhich remember is important cuz we've said\nthe subordinate CA is the one that issues\n\n179\n00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:05.010\ncertificates on behalf of the root,\nlike Daniel was asking about.\n\n180\n00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.023\nAnd we see evidence of that.\n\n181\n00:08:06.023 --> 00:08:07.183\nSo that validates for\n\n182\n00:08:07.183 --> 00:08:10.734\nthis certificate being issued\nthere validates that exact idea.\n\n183\n00:08:10.734 --> 00:08:13.260\nWe have a private key that\ncorresponds to the certificate.\n\n184\n00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.865\nWe're being issued a public\nprivate key pair here.\n\n185\n00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:18.621\nPublic keys are issued through\ncertificates and published there.\n\n186\n00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:22.943\nPrivate keys are kept secret and secure\nand usually assigned to the user and\n\n187\n00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:26.579\nstored in their profile in the AD,\nor registered somewhere and\n\n188\n00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:29.610\nstored locally maybe in the TPM,\nthings like that.\n\n189\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.464\nSo we see all that, and\nwe see the certification path.\n\n190\n00:08:32.464 --> 00:08:35.475\nAnd we could see now that when we\nlooked at that certificate path or\n\n191\n00:08:35.475 --> 00:08:39.092\ncertification path earlier, remember,\nfrom the subordinate and the root,\n\n192\n00:08:39.092 --> 00:08:40.984\nonly two certificates were in the path.\n\n193\n00:08:40.984 --> 00:08:44.980\nNow we have a third one issued from up\nunder the subordinate CA because now we\n\n194\n00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.987\nhave the user's certificate that was\nissued, so we could see that there.\n\n195\n00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.887\nAll right, so we click OK, that's good.\n\n196\n00:08:50.887 --> 00:08:52.151\nLet's click Finish.\n\n197\n00:08:52.151 --> 00:08:56.599\nAnd now we get a Certificates folder, and\nour certificate has actually been issued,\n\n198\n00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:58.657\nand it's available to us right there.\n\n199\n00:08:58.657 --> 00:09:02.861\nSo we can see it, and we now would\nbe able to use this certificate, for\n\n200\n00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:07.574\nany of the choices or any of the options\nthat were specified in the certificate\n\n201\n00:09:07.574 --> 00:09:11.806\nusage statement or the issuing\nstatement to encrypt certificates.\n\n202\n00:09:11.806 --> 00:09:13.775\nEncrypt certificates,\nscript files, excuse me.\n\n203\n00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:15.455\nWe can use it to digitally sign email or\n\n204\n00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:18.936\ndo any of those things that we want it to\ndo because now we have that capability.\n\n205\n00:09:18.936 --> 00:09:22.476\nSo, issuing a certificate through\nauto-enrollment is really nothing more\n\n206\n00:09:22.476 --> 00:09:26.078\nthan having the certificate template\nset up with the certificate authority.\n\n207\n00:09:26.078 --> 00:09:29.073\nHaving the appropriate\ncertificate made available and\n\n208\n00:09:29.073 --> 00:09:33.350\nthen allowing ourselves to be able to\nactually go and request the certificate.\n\n209\n00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:38.083\nNow, what I did not show you on the back\nend was the process to actually\n\n210\n00:09:38.083 --> 00:09:39.480\ntake the template.\n\n211\n00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.491\nPublish it out and make it available,\nand then walk through the process of\n\n212\n00:09:43.491 --> 00:09:46.545\nadvertising through that\nauto-enrollment process.\n\n213\n00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:49.783\nWe will show you how to do that as well\nbecause it's probably a little added\n\n214\n00:09:49.783 --> 00:09:53.352\nbehind the scenes, important feature\nthat we wanna make sure you're aware of.\n\n215\n00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:56.441\nBut what I wanted to show you first\nwas the outcome of the process.\n\n216\n00:09:56.441 --> 00:09:59.927\nHey, look at what we can do now that\nwe made a certificate available, and\n\n217\n00:09:59.927 --> 00:10:02.169\nhow easy it is to issue a certificate,\nright?\n\n218\n00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:03.257\nNot hard to do at all.\n\n219\n00:10:03.257 --> 00:10:06.940\nBut in order to do that, we have to\nactually set up a slightly different demo\n\n220\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.517\nenvironment, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n221\n00:10:09.517 --> 00:10:11.546\nWe're gonna come back in our next episode,\nand\n\n222\n00:10:11.546 --> 00:10:14.399\nwith that environment already structured,\nset up and built out.\n\n223\n00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:17.018\nWe're to go through and\nwalk through the step by step process for\n\n224\n00:10:17.018 --> 00:10:18.775\nyou of how to actually take that template.\n\n225\n00:10:18.775 --> 00:10:21.968\nSend it to the advertiser and make it\navailable through the auto enrollment\n\n226\n00:10:21.968 --> 00:10:24.461\nprocess, and\nthen use it to drive certificate issuance.\n\n227\n00:10:24.461 --> 00:10:25.922\n&gt;&gt; Well, very cool stuff Mr.\n\n228\n00:10:25.922 --> 00:10:29.491\nAdam Gordon, you definitely have\nshown us the, cuz what do we do?\n\n229\n00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:33.044\nWe tell you, you need to be issuing\ncertificates so you can do things like\n\n230\n00:10:33.044 --> 00:10:37.133\ndigitally signing email, or making secure\nconnections, things of that nature.\n\n231\n00:10:37.133 --> 00:10:38.035\nBut, how do you do that?\n\n232\n00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:40.845\nNow, hopefully you're\nstarting to see some of that,\n\n233\n00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:44.341\nbehind the scenes idea of that's\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n234\n00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:48.369\nBuild that certificate authority,\nmake subordinates CAs and\n\n235\n00:10:48.369 --> 00:10:51.185\nissue digital certificates as necessary.\n\n236\n00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:54.283\nDefinitely looking forward to getting\ninto seeing and publishing a template.\n\n237\n00:10:54.283 --> 00:10:54.936\nThat's gonna be very cool stuff.\n\n238\n00:10:54.936 --> 00:10:55.716\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n239\n00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:59.302\n&gt;&gt; Definitely come back for that, it is\nsomething that you want to be aware of,\n\n240\n00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:01.946\napprised of and\nbe able to do in your day to day business.\n\n241\n00:11:01.946 --> 00:11:04.065\nBut we're gonna have to do\nanother episode for that.\n\n242\n00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:05.490\nSo come on back for that.\n\n243\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.745\nAdam, thanks for joining us today,\nand we thank you all as well.\n\n244\n00:11:07.745 --> 00:11:11.125\nBut signing off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n245\n00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:11.809\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n246\n00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:13.114\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n247\n00:11:13.114 --> 00:11:14.934\n&gt;&gt; Take care.\n\n248\n00:11:14.934 --> 00:11:20.658\n[MUSIC]\n\n249\n00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:22.855\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice how you work that in there.\n\n18\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And you know what?\n\n19\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.860\nThe funny part is we're not even gonna\ntalk about patch management in WSUS.\n\n20\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.525\nThat's the funny part.\n\n21\n00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.805\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] wax out\non philosophical things.\n\n22\n00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:42.720\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do that.\n\n23\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.790\nBut we're also gonna talk about\npatch management not just\n\n24\n00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.670\nfrom the Windows perspective.\n\n25\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.240\nRight?\nIt's always important to talk about that.\n\n26\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.755\nBut you and\nI were talking before we got started,\n\n27\n00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:51.970\nthought we would start with the general\nidea behind patch management, right.\n\n28\n00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.050\nSo just what's the theme,\nthought process, the reason why,\n\n29\n00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890\nbut also maybe just a little bit about\nwhat we do on Linux versus Windows, right,\n\n30\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.420\nbecause it's always important to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.490\n&gt;&gt; Help most people out, right.\n\n32\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the thing, almost every\nweb server in the world is running\n\n33\n00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.390\non\n&gt;&gt; Apache.\n\n34\n00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.240\n&gt;&gt; Apache, right?\n&gt;&gt; It's a pretty popular kind of a thing.\n\n35\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.780\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n36\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.280\nit is software that will require\nupdating from time to time.\n\n37\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.830\n&gt;&gt; Shocking!\n\n38\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.659\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n39\n00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.420\nIt wasn't perfect out of the gate.\n\n40\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.890\nNew things are not found on it every day,\nat least that's what I heard.\n\n41\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.610\nBut right, it's not just a Windows world.\n\n42\n00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.140\nWe also have Macs out there as well.\n\n43\n00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.280\nThey also need updating,\nAndroid devices like phones, mobiles,\n\n44\n00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.550\ntablets, you name it.\n\n45\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.699\nIt's all got software and\nall needs updating.\n\n46\n00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:34.614\nThe reason is is because if I can\ntouch that in some ways or form.\n\n47\n00:01:34.614 --> 00:01:39.018\nIt opens up to an Internet or\nI can physically get my hands on it or\n\n48\n00:01:39.018 --> 00:01:42.935\nmaybe there's some sort of exploit or\nvulnerability.\n\n49\n00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:47.514\nThat's built into a multitude of different\nsoftwares that we need to make sure it's\n\n50\n00:01:47.514 --> 00:01:51.560\nup to at least until the last standards\nthat the company has put out.\n\n51\n00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.443\nAnd that's to keep people from\nactually getting into these devices.\n\n52\n00:01:55.443 --> 00:01:59.021\nBecause as someone who does\na bit of penetration fun,\n\n53\n00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:01.177\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n\n54\n00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:03.061\nI'm looking for unpatched systems.\n\n55\n00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:03.700\nWhy?\n\n56\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.690\nBecause unpatched systems the reason they\ncome out with a patch is because somebody\n\n57\n00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.948\nfound a vulnerability in it right\nsecurity wise, right maybe did.\n\n58\n00:02:10.948 --> 00:02:12.815\n&gt;&gt; A vulnerability generically\nwe would call it a weakness.\n\n59\n00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:14.367\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Right just whatever an exploitable.\n\n60\n00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:15.672\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Risk of some kind.\n\n61\n00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:16.405\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Whatever that would be.\n\n62\n00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:18.582\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for because-\n&gt;&gt; Or a threat.\n\n63\n00:02:18.582 --> 00:02:23.020\nThat's what's gonna allow me to\ngain access, escalate privileges,\n\n64\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.240\nthings of that nature.\n\n65\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.539\nBut, if you have a patch system\nwhere no vulnerabilities exist,\n\n66\n00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.365\nI'm kinda dead in the water at that point.\n\n67\n00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:35.339\nHence, the whole importance of\nkeeping the systems patched.\n\n68\n00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.821\nYou made an excellent point,\nas you always do, but\n\n69\n00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:39.860\nI wanna make sure everybody picked on it.\n\n70\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You just said, and\n\n71\n00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.650\nthe language you specifically used,\n\n72\n00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.482\nwhich is I liked the way you said it,\nno known vulnerabilities.\n\n73\n00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:48.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And the reason we wanna clarify is\n\n74\n00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.970\nthere is always unknown vulnerable,\nwell potential [INAUDIBLE].\n\n75\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.040\nWe don't know because they're unknown but\nmore often than not-\n\n76\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.120\n&gt;&gt; We don't know what we don't know.\n\n77\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.462\n&gt;&gt; We don't know what\nwe don't know exactly.\n\n78\n00:02:57.462 --> 00:02:59.133\nSo there are unknown vulnerabilities.\n\n79\n00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:03.010\nWe will call this residual risk,\nrisks that are left in the system,\n\n80\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.910\nperhaps unidentified in many cases until\nsometime later when they become apparent,\n\n81\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.493\nzero day exploits, APTs, Advanced\nPersistent Threats whatever they may be.\n\n82\n00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:15.227\nBut there is always this\nelement of residual risk or\n\n83\n00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:17.899\nunclassified unchartered\nrisk that we're not,\n\n84\n00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:21.471\nit's not that we're not accounting for\nit and we want to be clear.\n\n85\n00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:25.173\nIt's not that we're not aware of it we\njust don't know what to focus on so\n\n86\n00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:29.000\nfrom the perspective of risk mitigation\nrisk management its difficult but\n\n87\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.189\nnot impossible to deal with a threat that\nhas not been properly defined in there for\n\n88\n00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.760\nclassified in a way that\nwe can take action right?\n\n89\n00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.810\nIt has to be tangible.\n\n90\n00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think about it like a door.\n\n91\n00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.050\nLet's say you got a door right?\n\n92\n00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.870\nIf there's no lock on it, any Joe Schmo\ncan walk up, open the door, and\n\n93\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.800\ngo through right?\n\n94\n00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.890\nThere's the vulnerability.\n\n95\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.880\nSo you install a lock,\n\n96\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.040\nyou go to your local hardware store,\ngrab a door lock, install it.\n\n97\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.070\nAnd now, only a certain subset of\nthe population have the skills to get\n\n98\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.350\nthrough the door unless you have a key,\nright which you pass out.\n\n99\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.310\nSo, there are certain people that know\nhow to bypass that cheap lock that you\n\n100\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.270\nthrew on it.\n\n101\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.530\nSo, you know what,\nyou wanna make it stronger.\n\n102\n00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.780\nYou'd find out the most\nsecure lock that you can buy.\n\n103\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.530\nVery, very few people are gonna\nbe able to bypass that lock.\n\n104\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.010\nNot saying they're not out there.\n\n105\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.350\nI'm saying that there aren't people that\nknow how to finagle that lock a certain\n\n106\n00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.440\nway to make it open.\n\n107\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.210\nBut that subset of the population\ngonna be very very low, therefore,\n\n108\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.780\nincreasing your security platform.\n\n109\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.300\n&gt;&gt; Good. Good.\nAnother good way of thinking about it.\n\n110\n00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.493\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Good analogy, so\n\n111\n00:04:27.493 --> 00:04:30.786\nyou mentioning right Windows\nthey wanna talk about and\n\n112\n00:04:30.786 --> 00:04:33.302\ndelve into on the practical IT side here.\n\n113\n00:04:33.302 --> 00:04:38.033\nAnd I'm gonna form a perspective of how to\ndeal with patch management on the Windows\n\n114\n00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:42.562\nplatform because it is not a difficult\nundertaking but a complex one in the sense\n\n115\n00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:46.683\nthat there is a lot of steps a lot of it\nhas to take place on the server side,\n\n116\n00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:47.724\nsetting up WSUS.\n\n117\n00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:49.645\nAnd we are going to actually walk\nthrough and show you have to do that.\n\n118\n00:04:49.645 --> 00:04:53.458\nBut we were talking about Linux in\nparticular and just the difference\n\n119\n00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:57.929\nalthough in many respects its similarities\nassociated with how we would patch,\n\n120\n00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:58.996\non the Linux side.\n\n121\n00:04:58.996 --> 00:05:02.693\nIt is not necessarily the same though\nprocess in the sense that we have\n\n122\n00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:04.553\na centralized service like WSUS.\n\n123\n00:05:04.553 --> 00:05:09.267\nSo we are not going to build a PAT\nrepository which is what WSUS in windows\n\n124\n00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:12.499\nrepresent but\nwe do have a download capability.\n\n125\n00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:16.653\nWe are gonna get patches from the vendor\nwhether it is going to be Debian or\n\n126\n00:05:16.653 --> 00:05:21.029\nit is Red Hat or whoever the manufacturer\nof that Linux Distribution may be.\n\n127\n00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.978\nObviously, ones that are business and\n\n128\n00:05:22.978 --> 00:05:25.638\nenterprise focused are gonna\nhave more structure and\n\n129\n00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:27.442\nmore formality also more tools-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n130\n00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:29.720\n&gt;&gt; Traditionally around that.\n\n131\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.641\nWe could see automation take place\nwith scripting and anabash or\n\n132\n00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:35.028\ncron job of some type.\n\n133\n00:05:35.028 --> 00:05:38.506\nBut generically the process is\nessentially the same, right?\n\n134\n00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:42.384\n&gt;&gt; Generically, the process, like he said\nwhereas on Windows 7 you got WSUS and\n\n135\n00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:46.262\nit does a great job of saying here's all\nthe Microsoft products that you have in\n\n136\n00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.740\nyour environment.\n\n137\n00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.430\nI'm going to handle that for you.\n\n138\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.363\nYou just tell me what you wanna do when\nit comes down to getting those things and\n\n139\n00:05:53.363 --> 00:05:54.948\nthen getting them installed.\n\n140\n00:05:54.948 --> 00:05:57.301\nIt's great, I enjoy the product.\n\n141\n00:05:57.301 --> 00:05:58.253\nI've worked with it quite a bit.\n\n142\n00:05:58.253 --> 00:05:59.290\nSo it's a great product.\n\n143\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.283\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's not just [INAUDIBLE] right?\n\n144\n00:06:00.283 --> 00:06:01.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n145\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.179\n&gt;&gt; Because remember centralized\nserver infrastructure-\n\n146\n00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:06.080\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n147\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.192\n&gt;&gt; IT enterprise based management want to\n\n148\n00:06:08.192 --> 00:06:11.078\nautomate or\nwant to centralized [INAUDIBLE] way to go.\n\n149\n00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:12.875\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n&gt;&gt; But at home for instance right or\n\n150\n00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:14.654\nin stand alone environments-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n151\n00:06:14.654 --> 00:06:17.926\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps remote office environment\nwhere WSUS is installed.\n\n152\n00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:21.823\nWe also have that automated process\nbehind the scenes using BITS right?\n\n153\n00:06:21.823 --> 00:06:23.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The Background Intelligent\n\n154\n00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.736\nTransfer Service using the Windows\nautomatic update feature in the OS itself.\n\n155\n00:06:28.736 --> 00:06:32.232\nWe essentially create not\na local version of WSUS but\n\n156\n00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:36.124\nstill the same automated\n[CROSSTALK] to grab those files and\n\n157\n00:06:36.124 --> 00:06:39.873\nlet me then install them on\nsome sort of a regular basis.\n\n158\n00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:42.481\nSo we have both capabilities\nwhich is similar and more so\n\n159\n00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:46.199\nI think on the Windows Update side locally\nwould be similar to what we are talking\n\n160\n00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:46.875\nabout Linux.\n\n161\n00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:47.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIn Linux,\n\n162\n00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:51.945\nit would be much more like that\nWindows update kind of thing, right?\n\n163\n00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:57.260\n&gt;&gt; But that localized service,\nI could write a script where I have access\n\n164\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.860\nto all my servers that runs and does\na connection and forces, or I just create\n\n165\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.640\na script that pushes out to all my servers\nand make a, what they call a cron job,\n\n166\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.160\nsomething that happens on a regular basis,\nbasically a scheduled task if you will.\n\n167\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.720\nPut it on there.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n168\n00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.150\ncron being the equivalent of\nthe Windows-like command line schedule.\n\n169\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Or task scheduler.\n\n170\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.250\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; It's an automated\n\n171\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.130\nprocess that runs, right.\n\n172\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.730\n&gt;&gt; Just saying at this day, at this time.\n\n173\n00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.170\nDo this command where it will\nreach out to the repositories\n\n174\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.300\nof whatever system it\nis that you're using.\n\n175\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.980\nYou do also have to worry\nabout third party as well.\n\n176\n00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.870\nMaybe they don't have a repository in app.\n\n177\n00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.370\nThey don't have repository with RedHat or\nwith Yum, something like that.\n\n178\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.020\nSo, you're gonna have to count for\nthose as well.\n\n179\n00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.570\nDon't leave those off to the side.\n\n180\n00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.110\nDon't think,\n\n181\n00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.740\nthis is some crazy third party app\nthat I just downloaded and installed.\n\n182\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.895\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna have updates as well and\nsometimes that means having to go out-\n\n183\n00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:49.275\n&gt;&gt; Separately.\n\n184\n00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:53.981\n&gt;&gt; This is where Scripting really comes in\nhand inside of your Linux world because\n\n185\n00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:58.345\nyou can maybe script using something\nlike to go to that website.\n\n186\n00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:01.369\nLook for\na later edition of the download for\n\n187\n00:08:01.369 --> 00:08:04.980\nthe new version of\nwhatever software it is.\n\n188\n00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.080\nDownload that, and then have an install\nscript that will install it for\n\n189\n00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.930\nyou, as well.\n\n190\n00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.210\nThat's where scripting's\ngonna help you out.\n\n191\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.420\nAnd that's typically what you're gonna be\ndoing a lot of inside the Linux world.\n\n192\n00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.189\nWhereas WSUS is kind of like this nice\ncommand and control functionality where\n\n193\n00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:21.346\nyou're building that-\n&gt;&gt; And GUI based,\n\n194\n00:08:21.346 --> 00:08:23.685\nalthough it can be managed\nthrough PowerShell, right?\n\n195\n00:08:23.685 --> 00:08:26.480\nEssentially, but you're probably gonna\nuse an NFS server on the backend.\n\n196\n00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.424\nEssentially to create that same\ncatalog-like capability that WSUS\n\n197\n00:08:30.424 --> 00:08:31.410\nmay have.\n\n198\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.030\nAnd then pull those updates\nmore often than not down.\n\n199\n00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.897\nAnd the reason we're talking about\nthis specifically is, number one,\n\n200\n00:08:36.897 --> 00:08:38.502\nit's not just a Windows world, right.\n\n201\n00:08:38.502 --> 00:08:40.662\nContrary to what most\npeople will tell you, and\n\n202\n00:08:40.662 --> 00:08:44.340\nI think we're pretty transparent about\nthat when we talk about stuff like this.\n\n203\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.942\nAlthough, a lot of times in these\nconversations, we tend to be\n\n204\n00:08:46.942 --> 00:08:50.689\nMicrosoft-centric, so we're talking about\nMicrosoft-related technology topics.\n\n205\n00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:54.734\nBut we're trying to be broader in this\nseries cuz we want to understand that it's\n\n206\n00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:58.017\nnot just about, hey,\nlet's patch Microsoft infrastructure.\n\n207\n00:08:58.017 --> 00:09:01.235\nLet's access control,\nlet's multifactor manage, and\n\n208\n00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:04.333\nlet's not worry about what\nthat may look like outside.\n\n209\n00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:09.069\nBut it's important to realize and\nto stress that regardless of the platform,\n\n210\n00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:09.840\nright?\n\n211\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.772\nEven if you're on Android,\nwhich is essentially a very Linux,\n\n212\n00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:17.280\nUNIX-like world, Mac, very UNIX,\nLinux-like environment.\n\n213\n00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.500\nThe names of the tools, the specifics of\nthe package manager, the update manager,\n\n214\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.260\nperhaps the scripting solution,\nmay be slightly different, right?\n\n215\n00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.075\nMaybe it's not maybe it's something else,\nwhatever it may be but generically,\n\n216\n00:09:32.075 --> 00:09:33.320\nconcepts are the same.\n\n217\n00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.320\nBut one of the most important concepts is\nthis idea that this download capability\n\n218\n00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.410\ngives us the ability to build a repository\nthat doesn't become a one-off event.\n\n219\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.757\nBecause chances are good you're gonna\nhave to patch more than one server for\n\n220\n00:09:46.757 --> 00:09:47.864\nthe same patch, right.\n\n221\n00:09:47.864 --> 00:09:52.061\nYou may have a farm of web servers,\nyou may be bringing new content online,\n\n222\n00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:55.938\nnew infrastructure online,\ntraditionally in large enterprises.\n\n223\n00:09:55.938 --> 00:09:59.542\nI'm really more so on the Linux side,\nright, if we're dealing with Android and\n\n224\n00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:02.192\nMac, we're dealing with a very\nsmall subset of end users,\n\n225\n00:10:02.192 --> 00:10:05.180\nthat are typically on workstations more so\nthan servers, right?\n\n226\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.410\nWe know we're dealing with servers there,\nso the result is,\n\n227\n00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.100\non the server side,\nyou're gonna have to do this.\n\n228\n00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.092\nAnd this is gonna become part of,\nessentially, an ongoing,\n\n229\n00:10:14.092 --> 00:10:16.059\ntypically monthly, process, right?\n\n230\n00:10:16.059 --> 00:10:19.650\nAt a minimum, usually once a month,\nyou go out, you troll for the updates.\n\n231\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.120\nVendors will put them out on\nsome sort of published cycle.\n\n232\n00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.500\nVendors have gotten a lot better\nabout this, the last number of years.\n\n233\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.260\nThere's no, for the most part,\nrandom chaos with\n\n234\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.140\npatches being just simply distributed and\nreleased whenever there's a problem.\n\n235\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.320\nThere are still out of cycle updates,\nemergency updates that come out,\n\n236\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.710\nyou gotta account for those.\n\n237\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.090\nBut most vendors have gone to a,\nwhatever it is,\n\n238\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.952\nmaybe it's the first Tuesday\nof every month or whatever.\n\n239\n00:10:41.952 --> 00:10:45.081\nBut a published, known update cycle for\nnon-critical patches.\n\n240\n00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:48.482\n&gt;&gt; And it's interesting when you look at\nthe headlines on the news and they say,\n\n241\n00:10:48.482 --> 00:10:50.118\nsuch and such had a security breach.\n\n242\n00:10:50.118 --> 00:10:54.519\nThis company had a security breach and\nit was due to-\n\n243\n00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:55.842\n&gt;&gt; Lack of proper patch management.\n\n244\n00:10:55.842 --> 00:10:58.908\n&gt;&gt; That was unpatched, and\nit's been known for the last six months,\n\n245\n00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.116\na year, two years,\nfive years, or whatever.\n\n246\n00:11:01.116 --> 00:11:03.085\nAnd you're like,\nwhy didn't they patch that?\n\n247\n00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:07.056\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Great example of what recently has\n\n248\n00:11:07.056 --> 00:11:09.428\nbecome a major, major issue for\ncertain companies.\n\n249\n00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:13.582\n[CROSSTALK] Apache struts, right,\nand another one, actually,\n\n250\n00:11:13.582 --> 00:11:15.102\nwe read about it today.\n\n251\n00:11:15.102 --> 00:11:16.962\nI didn't get a chance to talk to\nyou about this before we came on.\n\n252\n00:11:16.962 --> 00:11:21.596\nBut talk about patches from days gone by,\nso the latest Microsoft patch cycle,\n\n253\n00:11:21.596 --> 00:11:25.620\nwe're in that week where Microsoft\nputs out their patches, right.\n\n254\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.190\nSo during the ramp up in the beginning\nof every month, right, so\n\n255\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.740\nMicrosoft just pushing those patches out.\n\n256\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.467\n53 patches released this month, November,\nright, of 2017, 53 patches this month.\n\n257\n00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:40.224\nOne of the patches, one of the most\nimportant ones, they're all important.\n\n258\n00:11:40.224 --> 00:11:43.538\nBut one of the most interesting,\nI should say, not most important,\n\n259\n00:11:43.538 --> 00:11:47.426\npatching a vulnerability that's been\nknown about in Office for 17 years, but\n\n260\n00:11:47.426 --> 00:11:49.045\nnobody's paid attention to it.\n\n261\n00:11:49.045 --> 00:11:53.048\nA memory exploit that has not been\npatched, so we're talking now, if we're in\n\n262\n00:11:53.048 --> 00:11:57.740\n2017, we're talking about a vulnerability\nthat's been known about since 2000.\n\n263\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.792\nWhich means essentially,\nOffice 97, approximately, right,\n\n264\n00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:05.072\ngive or take,\ncertainly going into Office 2000.\n\n265\n00:12:05.072 --> 00:12:10.803\nSo 97, 2000, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016,\n\n266\n00:12:10.803 --> 00:12:16.901\nseven versions of Office have come and\ngone, essentially, right, in the interim.\n\n267\n00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:20.950\nNot to mention the off cycle updates for\nthe versions for the Office for\n\n268\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.534\nthe Mac and whatever else.\n\n269\n00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:25.386\nAnd we're now getting around to\npatching this vulnerability,\n\n270\n00:12:25.386 --> 00:12:27.197\nwhich is a significant vulnerability.\n\n271\n00:12:27.197 --> 00:12:31.101\nIt's a memory exploit, essentially,\nit can lead to the running of unmonitored,\n\n272\n00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:34.900\nunregulated code, and it's a buffer\noverflow in one form or another.\n\n273\n00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.347\nAnd yet it's gone unrecognized,\nit's been known about, but\n\n274\n00:12:38.347 --> 00:12:40.961\nessentially gone undealt with for\n17 years.\n\n275\n00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:42.309\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing, amazing.\n\n276\n00:12:42.309 --> 00:12:45.785\n&gt;&gt; Talk about the, I wanna be the guy who\ndealt with that backlog and said, okay.\n\n277\n00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:49.628\nI finally have nothing better to do,\nlet me go ahead and write that patch and\n\n278\n00:12:49.628 --> 00:12:50.430\nget that done.\n\n279\n00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.328\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me put that out there.\n\n280\n00:12:51.328 --> 00:12:53.832\n&gt;&gt; I just keep forgetting about that,\nthat’s the role of right.\n\n281\n00:12:53.832 --> 00:12:57.450\nFor 17 years, that's gone unpatched,\nyou've gotta wonder, right.\n\n282\n00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.840\nI mean, this is part of the problem\nthat we deal with on the IT side,\n\n283\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.550\nin our side of the world, right.\n\n284\n00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.210\nWhere we deal with the fact\nthat we're essentially,\n\n285\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.508\nas we're talking about this,\nwe're beholden to the vendor, right.\n\n286\n00:13:08.508 --> 00:13:10.580\nI mean, it'd be one thing if we said,\nhey Daniel,\n\n287\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.540\nwe think we have this issue,\ncan you write us a patch?\n\n288\n00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.540\nBeing an internal resource for\nour company,\n\n289\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.630\ncan you just sit down to figure this out,\nand can you tell us how to patch it?\n\n290\n00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.213\nYou put the patch out, and\nwe deal with it in our own time.\n\n291\n00:13:21.213 --> 00:13:23.111\nI mean, that would be Interesting,\n\n292\n00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:26.860\nit would lead to all sorts of other\ncomplications and all sorts of chaos.\n\n293\n00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.140\nBut at least we would have\ncontrol in certain aspects over\n\n294\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.680\nthe infrastructure and\nour ability to deal with it.\n\n295\n00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.100\nNow, when it's homegrown code, we have\nthose capabilities, right, in theory.\n\n296\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.880\nAnd there's certainly a segment of\nthe population that deals with this.\n\n297\n00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.169\nBut when it deals with vendor-specific\ncode, proprietary code, essentially,\n\n298\n00:13:44.169 --> 00:13:45.894\nMicrosoft, Linux, whatever.\n\n299\n00:13:45.894 --> 00:13:50.477\nYou can't write patches for Microsoft\nOffice, you can't write them for Debian or\n\n300\n00:13:50.477 --> 00:13:51.010\nUbuntu.\n\n301\n00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.583\nI mean, yes, in theory,\non the Linux side, open source,\n\n302\n00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.084\nyou could write your own patches.\n\n303\n00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:58.543\nSo I'm not saying you couldn't, but\non a closed platform like Microsoft,\n\n304\n00:13:58.543 --> 00:13:59.470\ngood luck, right?\n\n305\n00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.200\nYou're not gonna be able to write a patch\nthat will be able to be installed.\n\n306\n00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.700\nAnd even on open source\nplatforms like Linux,\n\n307\n00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:10.460\nbase solutions on the Enterprise side,\nthe code base is more tightly controlled.\n\n308\n00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.580\nYou're not gonna be able to go write\na patch for Red Hat Enterprise, and\n\n309\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.727\npush it into production.\n\n310\n00:14:14.727 --> 00:14:17.183\nYou gotta go through them,\nit's gotta be digitally signed,\n\n311\n00:14:17.183 --> 00:14:19.703\nit's gotta be secured and vetted,\nIt's just not gonna work.\n\n312\n00:14:19.703 --> 00:14:22.539\n&gt;&gt; They're not just gonna go,\nthanks so much,\n\n313\n00:14:22.539 --> 00:14:24.709\n[CROSSTALK] just go slap that right in.\n\n314\n00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:28.593\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it'd be great, but\nmaybe on this off in the corner distro.\n\n315\n00:14:28.593 --> 00:14:29.300\n&gt;&gt; Who are you again?\n\n316\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.450\n&gt;&gt; Peanut Linux or\nsomething like that, you can do it on,\n\n317\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.884\nbut not a major enterprise grade,\nright, distribution.\n\n318\n00:14:35.884 --> 00:14:39.757\nIt just doesn't work that way, and so\nas a result, we're really beholden to\n\n319\n00:14:39.757 --> 00:14:43.044\nthe vendors, to make sure that\nthey've got their act together.\n\n320\n00:14:43.044 --> 00:14:47.321\nAnd let's be fair, for the most part, they\ndo, people look at patch management and\n\n321\n00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:49.626\nsay, that's the vendors playing catch up.\n\n322\n00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:52.433\nThey screwed up, and now they're trying\nto fix the problem after the fact.\n\n323\n00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.696\n&gt;&gt; That's unfair.\n\n324\n00:14:53.696 --> 00:14:55.040\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely one interpretation,\n\n325\n00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.763\nI'm not saying it's the right one,\nI agree with you.\n\n326\n00:14:56.763 --> 00:15:00.145\nI don't think that's the right way\nand/or the fair way to see that, but\n\n327\n00:15:00.145 --> 00:15:02.488\nyou hear that from a lot\nof people in our industry.\n\n328\n00:15:02.488 --> 00:15:05.421\nBecause they want to put the blame\nat the foot of the vendor,\n\n329\n00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:08.659\nas opposed to understanding that\nthis is a partnership, right?\n\n330\n00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:12.506\nWe're agreeing to run the software,\nand the software, we have to know,\n\n331\n00:15:12.506 --> 00:15:15.121\nwe have to think about this and\nknow ahead of time.\n\n332\n00:15:15.121 --> 00:15:19.755\nIt's not gonna be available to us in a\nfully featured form in the sense that it's\n\n333\n00:15:19.755 --> 00:15:22.770\ngonna have no bugs,\nno issues, no concerns.\n\n334\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.620\nThis is an ongoing, dynamic,\nliving product that as we use in new and\n\n335\n00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.800\ndifferent ways over time and\nwe enable new features.\n\n336\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.408\nDifferent weaknesses appear cuz we push\nhard in one area, and things bubble up.\n\n337\n00:15:34.408 --> 00:15:38.014\nAnd as a result, we've gotta be prepared\nto deal with that, I mean, that's part\n\n338\n00:15:38.014 --> 00:15:41.390\nof the contract you sign up for when\nyou say, I wanna run this stuff, right.\n\n339\n00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.066\nWhether you pay for it, whether it's free,\nwhether it's a combination of\n\n340\n00:15:45.066 --> 00:15:48.411\nthose things, you are essentially\nliving in a laboratory, right.\n\n341\n00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:52.259\nThis is an ongoing, real time experiment,\nand as a result of that,\n\n342\n00:15:52.259 --> 00:15:56.578\nyou gotta be prepared for the fact that\nthere are bumps in the road Anybody who\n\n343\n00:15:56.578 --> 00:15:59.885\nworks in our industry,\nwho looks at software as a static,\n\n344\n00:15:59.885 --> 00:16:04.301\nnon-risk laden event, is just not\nunderstanding what we do and how we do it.\n\n345\n00:16:04.301 --> 00:16:07.570\nAnd it's just not the right\nmindset to come into this with.\n\n346\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.225\nSo we do have to be willing to understand\nthat there are gonna be times where we've\n\n347\n00:16:11.225 --> 00:16:12.261\ngot to react quickly.\n\n348\n00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:15.240\nAnd I did say reactive,\nI didn't say be proactive.\n\n349\n00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.954\nWe can be proactive in a lot of other\nareas, we talk a lot about proactivity and\n\n350\n00:16:18.954 --> 00:16:21.085\nhow to manage things, so we minimize risk.\n\n351\n00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:25.765\nBut one of the things that we have to\nbe proactive about in our response, and\n\n352\n00:16:25.765 --> 00:16:28.920\nour thought process\noverall defense in-depth.\n\n353\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.036\nMeans that in this case we have to be\nprepared proactively to react when\n\n354\n00:16:33.036 --> 00:16:36.682\nthe vendor makes it possible for\nus to deal with those things.\n\n355\n00:16:36.682 --> 00:16:39.122\nAnd as you said and I think it's\na great way of thinking about it.\n\n356\n00:16:39.122 --> 00:16:43.503\nYou've gotta be prepared to be there,\npounce on those updates.\n\n357\n00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.769\nDo your due diligence,\ndo your vulnerability testing,\n\n358\n00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:47.193\nyour vulnerability assessments.\n\n359\n00:16:47.193 --> 00:16:51.783\nYour pen tests, your interoperability,\nbackwards compatibility, all the words and\n\n360\n00:16:51.783 --> 00:16:53.490\nterms we throw at this, right?\n\n361\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.682\nPut it in a sandbox, install it,\nrun it, figure out what it does,\n\n362\n00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.915\nmake sure it's not gonna\nmake matters worse.\n\n363\n00:16:58.915 --> 00:17:02.946\nBut then you've gotta get your act\ntogether and apply that update,\n\n364\n00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:07.274\nthat patch, whatever that is as\nquickly as is realistically possible.\n\n365\n00:17:07.274 --> 00:17:10.321\nSo that you're minimizing the risk\nassociated with the usage of it.\n\n366\n00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:15.330\nAnd when you do that, you're then being\nproactive overall about patch management.\n\n367\n00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.419\nBut it's essentially a reactive exercise,\nthere's really no way around that.\n\n368\n00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:20.623\nAnd that's something we\njust gotta think about and\n\n369\n00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:23.330\nbe aware of as we get started\nwith this conversation.\n\n370\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.700\nAll right, so now that we've kinda set\nthe stage for us a little bit right?\n\n371\n00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.619\nLet's take a thought\nprocess on the Linux side.\n\n372\n00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:31.676\nGenerically hey,\nlet's go download those patches,\n\n373\n00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:35.670\nset up an NFS server, essentially\na file and print server capability.\n\n374\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.290\nLet's archive those, as we said.\n\n375\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.594\nLet's go ahead and batch them out, or\n\n376\n00:17:39.594 --> 00:17:42.420\nschedule them to run on\nmore than one systems.\n\n377\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.250\nWe left out the idea of just checking logs\nto make sure installs were done properly.\n\n378\n00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.995\nWe may link that to a broader\nthought process around syslogging or\n\n379\n00:17:49.995 --> 00:17:51.433\nSEM in some way, right?\n\n380\n00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:52.673\nSo there's lot of stuff that we could do.\n\n381\n00:17:52.673 --> 00:17:56.805\nYou want to be alerted to this, so\nmaybe an IDS or IPS will run that will\n\n382\n00:17:56.805 --> 00:18:00.250\ngive us capabilities to have\ninsight into what that is.\n\n383\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.795\nThere's all sorts of ways to monitor this,\nright?\n\n384\n00:18:01.795 --> 00:18:04.410\nAnd we do the same thing\non the Windows side.\n\n385\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.993\nWhen we think about using patch management\non Windows we've talked about basically\n\n386\n00:18:07.993 --> 00:18:09.921\nthe same thought process, deploying WSUS.\n\n387\n00:18:09.921 --> 00:18:14.280\nThat'll be one of the key focal points for\nour practical deep dive hands on here.\n\n388\n00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.418\nWe're gonna start with that in a minute.\n\n389\n00:18:15.418 --> 00:18:17.588\nBut we also talked about\non a standalone or\n\n390\n00:18:17.588 --> 00:18:21.869\nlocal machine using the Windows Update\nfeature, the automatic update feature.\n\n391\n00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:25.000\nRuns on the BITS service, the Background\nIntelligence Transfer Service.\n\n392\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.127\nAnd allows us to go out to\nthis premade catalog, and\n\n393\n00:18:28.127 --> 00:18:32.890\nto have Microsoft essentially take over\nthe process of doing updates for us.\n\n394\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.555\nNow as we move more and more towards\noperating system as a service, right,\n\n395\n00:18:36.555 --> 00:18:38.431\nthis idea of let's say Windows 10.\n\n396\n00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:43.303\nNow, Server 16 moving in this direction\nas well where Microsoft is really\n\n397\n00:18:43.303 --> 00:18:46.283\npushing hard to take\nover the updating cycle.\n\n398\n00:18:46.283 --> 00:18:50.350\nThey're pushing updates to the OS\nas part of Windows Updates.\n\n399\n00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.386\nThey're pushing security\nupdates as part of that.\n\n400\n00:18:52.386 --> 00:18:56.982\nBut they're being very aggressive about\nthe fact that you've got to allow them to\n\n401\n00:18:56.982 --> 00:19:01.160\ntake over management of this, and\nreally manage this cycle for you.\n\n402\n00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.054\nWe're seeing that this is really changing,\nin some respects,\n\n403\n00:19:04.054 --> 00:19:06.313\nthe landscape of the nature\nof patch management.\n\n404\n00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:08.930\nBecause we're being asked\nto trust the vendor.\n\n405\n00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:09.858\nYou may or may not like that.\n\n406\n00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:13.192\nBut the vendor is saying,\nwe'll take over the responsibility of\n\n407\n00:19:13.192 --> 00:19:17.200\nmaking sure those patches are pushed on\nwhatever schedule we provide them on.\n\n408\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.169\nAnd that they're being installed and\nupdated.\n\n409\n00:19:19.169 --> 00:19:22.035\nYou have options to opt out\nif you need to stabilize and\n\n410\n00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:24.718\nfreeze your environment\non the enterprise side.\n\n411\n00:19:24.718 --> 00:19:29.361\nYeah, we can put off or delay those\nupdates, our long term branch sequencing,\n\n412\n00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:33.285\nand other capabilities on\nthe Windows 10 Server 16 Platform.\n\n413\n00:19:33.285 --> 00:19:35.954\nAllow us to freeze our image in place for\na period of time,\n\n414\n00:19:35.954 --> 00:19:39.350\nbypassing the need to download and\ninstall those patches at some point,\n\n415\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.540\nalthough they will come back around,\nright?\n\n416\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.140\nEventually, we'll have to integrate them,\nor at least think about them.\n\n417\n00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.829\nWhen we broaden this conversation\ninto configuration management, and\n\n418\n00:19:48.829 --> 00:19:52.221\nuse a configuration management\nplatform to be able to drive this.\n\n419\n00:19:52.221 --> 00:19:57.340\nWhether it's the Microsoft System Center\nplatform, whether it's Open View from HP.\n\n420\n00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.950\nWhether it's Tivoli from IBM,\n\n421\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.299\nwhatever it may be there's all\nthese vendor platforms out there.\n\n422\n00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:05.880\nOn the VMware side if we're virtualizing,\nwe can use VOM,\n\n423\n00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.330\nthe VMware update manager,\nessentially the same idea.\n\n424\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.730\nThis is patch management\nacross any platform.\n\n425\n00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.804\nIt doesn't matter what it is.\n\n426\n00:20:12.804 --> 00:20:16.367\nWhen we do this,\nwe have to obviously understand the need,\n\n427\n00:20:16.367 --> 00:20:19.770\nnot only to be on point\nwith regards to scheduling.\n\n428\n00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.889\nBut also this idea of due diligence and\ndo care.\n\n429\n00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:25.415\nThis idea of understanding what we're\ndoing by applying a patch which\n\n430\n00:20:25.415 --> 00:20:28.642\nessentially modifies our working\nenvironment, hopefully for\n\n431\n00:20:28.642 --> 00:20:30.020\nthe better, right?\n\n432\n00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.219\nEvery so often, patches go sideways.\n\n433\n00:20:31.219 --> 00:20:34.554\nIf you've done this long enough you've\nhad one or more experiences where you've\n\n434\n00:20:34.554 --> 00:20:38.095\ndownloaded and installed what you thought\nwas a perfectly legitimate patch.\n\n435\n00:20:38.095 --> 00:20:38.990\nVendor probably did as well.\n\n436\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:43.510\nI don't think knowingly anybody puts out\na patch that's gonna blow something up.\n\n437\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.816\nBut we have all,\nif we've done this long enough,\n\n438\n00:20:46.816 --> 00:20:50.000\nhad instances where\na patch has gone wrong.\n\n439\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.280\nYou may remember the NT4 Service Pack\n66A patch debacle.\n\n440\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.930\nIf you've been doing this long\nenough you'll remember that,\n\n441\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.130\nwhere you installed\nthe NT4 Service Pack 6 patch,\n\n442\n00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.485\nif you were one of the first\nkids on your block to do that.\n\n443\n00:21:01.485 --> 00:21:05.140\nYou're also one of the first kids on your\nblock to blow up your infrastructure and\n\n444\n00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.150\nrebuild everything from scratch because it\nblue screened all the machines it touched.\n\n445\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.473\nUntil Microsoft figured\nout pretty quickly,\n\n446\n00:21:11.473 --> 00:21:13.517\nthat's not what a patch is supposed to do.\n\n447\n00:21:13.517 --> 00:21:15.880\nLet's put out a patch that fixes that.\n\n448\n00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.589\n&gt;&gt; It's an anti-patch, right?\n\n449\n00:21:16.589 --> 00:21:18.360\n[LAUGH] It's like the opposite effect.\n\n450\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look at this pretty blue\ncolor we just figured out how to show\n\n451\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.160\nyou on the screen.\n\n452\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.340\nAnd so yeah, that was interesting.\n\n453\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.317\nI actually was working and\n\n454\n00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:27.767\ndealing with that in real time in\nthe field when that was going on.\n\n455\n00:21:27.767 --> 00:21:32.224\nAnd I remember not only having to support\ncustomers, but having servers of my own,\n\n456\n00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:35.230\nin our own infrastructure\nthat had fallen prey to that.\n\n457\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.003\nThis is way before virtualization\nwas the standard or the norm.\n\n458\n00:21:38.003 --> 00:21:40.823\nIt's before cloud had been invented,\n\n459\n00:21:40.823 --> 00:21:44.400\nbefore the ideas associated\nwith all of this.\n\n460\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.029\nAnd this was when you did\nit the old fashioned way.\n\n461\n00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:48.295\nYou built infrastructure by hand, and\n\n462\n00:21:48.295 --> 00:21:51.600\nyou had to rebuild it by hand\nwhen you [LAUGH] screwed it up.\n\n463\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.110\n&gt;&gt; Server installs were over an hour long,\nthat was fun.\n\n464\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.997\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n465\n00:21:53.997 --> 00:21:56.008\nthat was if you were doing it on a floppy.\n\n466\n00:21:56.008 --> 00:21:57.655\nI mean, if you're doing this with floppy,\n\n467\n00:21:57.655 --> 00:21:59.710\nthis is back when floppies\nwere still around, right?\n\n468\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.965\nYou had to load drivers,\nthis was the good old days, as we said.\n\n469\n00:22:03.965 --> 00:22:06.023\nThere's nothing good about them, right?\n\n470\n00:22:06.023 --> 00:22:07.800\nBut this was a major undertaking.\n\n471\n00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.790\nThis was not, oops, I made a mistake,\nlet's spawn another virtual instance.\n\n472\n00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.240\nLet's backfill some data,\nwe're back in business.\n\n473\n00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.980\nCloning and all that stuff was around,\nwe had clustering.\n\n474\n00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.175\nClustering was just\nbeginning at that point.\n\n475\n00:22:20.175 --> 00:22:24.321\nBut you didn't really have\nvirtualization in a meaningful way, and\n\n476\n00:22:24.321 --> 00:22:27.020\nthis can be a significant disruption.\n\n477\n00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.072\nSo we wanna make really\nas we get into this,\n\n478\n00:22:29.072 --> 00:22:33.364\nthat we understand the overview behind the\nthought processes around patch management.\n\n479\n00:22:33.364 --> 00:22:37.320\nBut also understand the importance\nof how to do it successfully.\n\n480\n00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.030\nIt's this combination of proactive and\nreactive that we're talking about.\n\n481\n00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.970\nWhen we're thinking about\ndeploying on the Windows side,\n\n482\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.160\njust to share with you as we start\nto look at what we're gonna do.\n\n483\n00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.651\nJoin me here, what you'll see is just\nsome background material on WSUS.\n\n484\n00:22:50.651 --> 00:22:54.340\nI'm gonna be doing this demonstration\non a Server 16 set of servers.\n\n485\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:59.410\nSo we'll build and install and\nconfigure WSUS on the Server 16 platform.\n\n486\n00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.555\nCan you do this on server 12,\n12R2, absolutely.\n\n487\n00:23:01.555 --> 00:23:04.976\nYou can go all the way back\nto Server 2000, right?\n\n488\n00:23:04.976 --> 00:23:06.622\nWSUS has been around for a long time.\n\n489\n00:23:06.622 --> 00:23:09.431\nBut the reality is today,\nthe modern enterprise,\n\n490\n00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:12.839\nwe're probably thinking 12\n12R2 perhaps Server 16.\n\n491\n00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:16.947\nSo we figure we would do this on the more\nrecent of the server side operating\n\n492\n00:23:16.947 --> 00:23:19.681\nsystems, and\nshow you how to walk through this.\n\n493\n00:23:19.681 --> 00:23:22.757\nPut the documentation here and\nI´ll make sure we put the URL for\n\n494\n00:23:22.757 --> 00:23:26.350\nthis page in the show notes for you,\nin case you want to take a look.\n\n495\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.942\nStandard disclaimer, we´re doing this now,\n\n496\n00:23:28.942 --> 00:23:32.390\nroughly end of November,\nmiddle to end of November 2017.\n\n497\n00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.900\nThere may be a Sever 2020 out\nby the time you watch this.\n\n498\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.215\nWho knows what will be there?\n\n499\n00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:40.670\nSo this is pertinent to\nServer 16 1212-R2 and\n\n500\n00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:45.290\nobviously it's pertinent to it given\nthe timeline we're looking at.\n\n501\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.709\nYou look at the date on this, it was\nwritten in the middle of October 2017.\n\n502\n00:23:49.709 --> 00:23:53.844\nRoughly about not even 30 days before\nwe're putting this content together and\n\n503\n00:23:53.844 --> 00:23:57.730\nfilming it for you Six months, nine\nmonths, a year from now as you watch this\n\n504\n00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.490\nthrough the library,\nthere may be an update to this.\n\n505\n00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.090\nSo, as I always tell you,\nuse the URL from the show,\n\n506\n00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.330\nnotes that doesn't point to the right\nthing or it changes an updates.\n\n507\n00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.330\nAlways go out to look for\nthe most recent information, right?\n\n508\n00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:12.320\nBecause there will be changes and\nthings may slightly update over time.\n\n509\n00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.000\nGeneral idea is not gonna change,\n\n510\n00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.370\nWSaaS has been WSaaS for probably\nbetter part at 20 years at this point.\n\n511\n00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.160\nBut how we install it the version\nwhere we go what we do,\n\n512\n00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.090\nthose interfaces change over time.\n\n513\n00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.940\nWe had a major change\nfrom Server 2003 to 2008.\n\n514\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:32.362\nAn older version of WSUS version 3X\nup to the newer version to 12 and\n\n515\n00:24:32.362 --> 00:24:36.567\n16 that we have to adjust for,\nwe remap the ports for\n\n516\n00:24:36.567 --> 00:24:41.140\nWSaaS moving between that\nto securely access it.\n\n517\n00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.876\nWe are now in 85, 30,\n85,31 instead of 80 and 443.\n\n518\n00:24:44.876 --> 00:24:48.507\nSo we just want to know there are changes\nthese things become imported and\n\n519\n00:24:48.507 --> 00:24:52.617\nas IT-professionals, a security minded\nIT-professional we wanna make sure we\n\n520\n00:24:52.617 --> 00:24:57.025\nare aware of those things so always read\nand look at the most recent information.\n\n521\n00:24:57.025 --> 00:25:00.825\nThe reason I like this page in particular,\nlet me just scroll down, so\n\n522\n00:25:00.825 --> 00:25:01.765\nyou could see it here.\n\n523\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.892\nIt's gone and you can see the same steps\nthat are kind of linked here that I'm\n\n524\n00:25:06.892 --> 00:25:10.546\ngonna point to they are over here on\nthe navigation area on the left, just so\n\n525\n00:25:10.546 --> 00:25:11.708\nyou know where they go.\n\n526\n00:25:11.708 --> 00:25:15.164\nBut it's got a nice little,\nit's kind of methodical walk through,\n\n527\n00:25:15.164 --> 00:25:19.036\nthe thought process around how do I plan\nthe deployment, what do I need to do,\n\n528\n00:25:19.036 --> 00:25:22.908\nwhat are things I have to be aware of\ninfrastructure how many servers what kind\n\n529\n00:25:22.908 --> 00:25:26.542\nof database do I have options to scale\nthis and run multiple servers, and\n\n530\n00:25:26.542 --> 00:25:30.037\nmaybe a central download, and\nthen a distribution network inside.\n\n531\n00:25:30.037 --> 00:25:33.380\nDo I just have a single point sitting\nin the DMZ and you get all the server\n\n532\n00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.800\ndownloads in there's different options you\nwant to think about how you scale this.\n\n533\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.416\nWhat if I have a distributor\nglobal architecture and\n\n534\n00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:43.863\nI wanna have central patch management for\ndownloading and testing,\n\n535\n00:25:43.863 --> 00:25:47.563\nbut then I wanna distribute improves\npatches out internally after that?\n\n536\n00:25:47.563 --> 00:25:49.714\nBut we can do that,\nwe have the capabilities to do that.\n\n537\n00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:52.580\nBut you gotta plan for\nthose things and know what they are.\n\n538\n00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.420\nInstall the WSUS role,\nwe're gonna walk through how to do that.\n\n539\n00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.680\nConfigure it,\nwe're gonna walk through how to do that.\n\n540\n00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.840\nApprove and deploy updates, gonna walk\nthrough and show you how to do that.\n\n541\n00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.380\nConfigured group policy settings for\n\n542\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.270\nautomatic updates going to walk\nthrough show you how to do that.\n\n543\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.290\nSo the practical hands on pieces that\nwe're going to demonstrate are all going\n\n544\n00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.340\nto be documented here for\nyou, step by step.\n\n545\n00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.267\nYou'll see us go through them using\na Server 16 instance in a domain.\n\n546\n00:26:15.267 --> 00:26:18.088\nYou'll see us use a Windows\n8.1 client to download and\n\n547\n00:26:18.088 --> 00:26:21.000\njust show the effects of\ngroup policy in the updates.\n\n548\n00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.460\nSo we're going to be going through and\nshowing you how all that happens,\n\n549\n00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.580\nbut this is great documentation.\n\n550\n00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.310\nHelps us to understand\nhow to deal with issues.\n\n551\n00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.100\nFor instance if we use\nthe Windows internal database\n\n552\n00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.130\nto build the initial instance of a WSUS\nwhich we may do if we don't have a SQL\n\n553\n00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.060\ninstance that's just laying around or\nthat's licensed and\n\n554\n00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.810\nwe wanna migrate that out into\nan enterprise scalable SQL instance.\n\n555\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.750\nCan we do that, the answer is absolutely.\n\n556\n00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.275\nHow do we do it?\n\n557\n00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:46.060\nWe've got information on\nhow to do it right there.\n\n558\n00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.930\nSo a lot of times these scenarios that we\nhear about we think about that we have to\n\n559\n00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.960\ncontend with are all gonna be\ndealt with in the documentation.\n\n560\n00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.900\nSo we do wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that and\n\n561\n00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.520\nthat we have a sense of how to\nuse this information wisely.\n\n562\n00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.320\nAlright, so, probably a good place for\nus to break, think about coming back, and\n\n563\n00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.450\njumping in doing our\nbeginning hands-on piece.\n\n564\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.210\nI've got the WSUS environment already\nstood up in the sense that we've got\n\n565\n00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.080\nthe servers ready to go I've used\nPowerShell just t get the role\n\n566\n00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.030\ntied up there.\n\n567\n00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.640\nWe're now gonna go through quickly\npick up look back the next session.\n\n568\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.920\nShow you what we did just on the back and\nto set the role in motion.\n\n569\n00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.578\nThat's very quick and I've left the\nconfiguration over the going wizard for\n\n570\n00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:25.669\nus to actually to start\na walk through with.\n\n571\n00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:28.530\nWe're gonna pick up right there and\ndo that in episode number two.\n\n572\n00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.845\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good, hopefully\nyou guys are starting to understand\n\n573\n00:27:32.845 --> 00:27:36.946\nthe importance of why we are telling\nyou patch updating, patches and\n\n574\n00:27:36.946 --> 00:27:40.502\nupdating is a very important\npart of our security posture.\n\n575\n00:27:40.502 --> 00:27:43.817\nRight, so if we're not getting this\nright we're basically, we can have all\n\n576\n00:27:43.817 --> 00:27:47.285\nthe greatest gadgets in the world if we're\nnot making sure that our systems are as\n\n577\n00:27:47.285 --> 00:27:50.682\nsecure as they can be you're only as\nstrong as your weakest link kind of thing.\n\n578\n00:27:50.682 --> 00:27:52.323\nAll right, so definitely come back,\n\n579\n00:27:52.323 --> 00:27:54.440\nwe're gonna take a look\nat how to work with WSUS.\n\n580\n00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.450\nGet it stood up, get it configured,\nplay around with it, so\n\n581\n00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.167\nthat we can have that regular patching\ncycle that comes around to try to keep\n\n582\n00:28:01.167 --> 00:28:03.330\nour environment as secure as possible.\n\n583\n00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.597\nAdam, thanks for joining us today, we're\nlooking forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n584\n00:28:05.597 --> 00:28:07.320\nHopefully, you'll join us as well.\n\n585\n00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.802\nAs for this episode, we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign off of ITPROTV.\n\n586\n00:28:09.802 --> 00:28:12.250\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n587\n00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.100\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n588\n00:28:13.100 -->

00:00:16.812\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:21.253\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, well, we're coming back\n\n8\n00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:25.281\nat you with more, not just regular IT\nsecurity, but practical IT security.\n\n9\n00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:27.225\nSomething you actually implement and do,\n\n10\n00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.560\nnot just us tell you this\nwould be a good idea.\n\n11\n00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.570\nJoining us back in the studio to help out\nwith that conversation, our good friend,\n\n12\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.810\nMr Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.730\nAdam, welcome back sir,\nglad to have you yet again.\n\n14\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.630\n&gt;&gt; Awesome,\nglad to be here with you, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.360\nSo what are we gonna talk about today?\n\n16\n00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.990\n&gt;&gt; I think we're gonna talk\nabout passwords, dun, dun, dun!\n\n17\n00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.790\nRight, because, well, passwords are kinda\nthe bane of most people´s existence.\n\n18\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.736\nAnd, we've got to know how to\ncreate a good password, work and\n\n19\n00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:54.622\nuse passwords well, and\neven manage our passwords, right.\n\n20\n00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:56.802\n&gt;&gt; All those things are important,\nwe, I think,\n\n21\n00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:59.646\ngroup those under the category\ncalled the password hygiene.\n\n22\n00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:03.111\nAnd the idea behind this episode\ndrill down, let's talk about,\n\n23\n00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:05.640\nnot just passwords, why they're important.\n\n24\n00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.690\nWe have those conversations all the time,\nlike Daniel was suggesting.\n\n25\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.050\nHow do you manage them?\n\n26\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.190\nWhat is complexity?\n\n27\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.040\nWhy do we need password history?\n\n28\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.310\nWhy do we force users to change passwords?\n\n29\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.170\nWell, we'll quickly remain you of why\nsome of those things are important along\n\n30\n00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.810\nthe way, but what we thought we would do\nis actually talk about, the technology,\n\n31\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.045\nthe thought process,\nbring those things together.\n\n32\n00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:28.522\nAlong the way show you some of the\npractical real world things you could be\n\n33\n00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.812\ndoing with passwords to\nmake them more secure.\n\n34\n00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:33.822\nWe've done some episodes on\nmulti-factor authentication,\n\n35\n00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:37.180\nif you haven't seen those really\nlinking that thought process here.\n\n36\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.377\nWe talked about technology on\nthe Window side, Windows Hello there,\n\n37\n00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:46.369\nactually we setup, the ability be able\nto use biometrics, the fingerprint scan.\n\n38\n00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.622\nWe put a pin on the account\nusing the capabilities\n\n39\n00:01:49.622 --> 00:01:52.567\nof combining different factors together.\n\n40\n00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:56.408\nAnd when we think about passwords\nultimately in the real world,\n\n41\n00:01:56.408 --> 00:02:00.251\nwe really think about using\na single factor of authentication,\n\n42\n00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:02.612\na very traditional, very old school.\n\n43\n00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:05.999\nVery, very, at least in the beginning,\nas we started to think about it,\n\n44\n00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.530\nwe thought secure way of\nauthenticating a logging in.\n\n45\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.170\nBut today we find more and more passwords,\nby themselves, are really not very secure.\n\n46\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.917\nAnd as a result we have to to think about\ncombining them with other stuff and\n\n47\n00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:21.028\none of the biggest challenges we have with\npasswords is probably two challenges I\n\n48\n00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:21.887\nwould suggest.\n\n49\n00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:25.772\nFirst one is how to we get users to create\npasswords that are sufficiently strong,\n\n50\n00:02:25.772 --> 00:02:26.458\nand complex?\n\n51\n00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.280\nYou and I were talking about the need for\nboth before we came on and\n\n52\n00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.423\nprobably going through\nthat thought process and\n\n53\n00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:34.420\nexplaining why we need both will\nbe important, and we'll do that.\n\n54\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.450\nDaniel had a really good way of thinking\nabout that, and he'll share that with you.\n\n55\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.160\nBut in addition to figuring out\nhow to motivate users, right,\n\n56\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.570\nto be more secure with passwords and\nmaking sure they follow the rules about\n\n57\n00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.630\nnot writing them down and sharing them and\ndoing all the things that we\n\n58\n00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.430\nall know we're not supposed to\ndo around password management.\n\n59\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.258\nThe other challenge is, of course, even\nwith all that passwords by themselves have\n\n60\n00:02:58.258 --> 00:03:00.774\nunfortunately really become a liability.\n\n61\n00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:04.104\nAs opposed to a positive force on\nthe security side because in and\n\n62\n00:03:04.104 --> 00:03:06.817\nof themselves, by themselves,\nthey're really,\n\n63\n00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:11.195\nunless where talking about some very rare\ncircumstances where users are using, and\n\n64\n00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:13.681\nyou said your favorite\nnumber is at least 15.\n\n65\n00:03:13.681 --> 00:03:17.820\nRight, when we talked about this, and\nso when you're thinking about creating\n\n66\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.518\npasswords that are sufficiently long, and\nsufficiently complex, that we're not gonna\n\n67\n00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:27.002\nhave the liability associated with easily\nfinding them through brute force attack.\n\n68\n00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:30.772\nEasily being able to figure out what\nthose passwords are becomes difficult,\n\n69\n00:03:30.772 --> 00:03:33.567\nbecause users don't tend to\nwanna use those passwords.\n\n70\n00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:37.537\nAnd if they do it's very difficult for\nthem to figure out how to use them without\n\n71\n00:03:37.537 --> 00:03:40.067\nsomehow exposing them,\nlike writing them down,\n\n72\n00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:44.010\nperhaps using an insecure way of\ntransmitting them and or remembering them.\n\n73\n00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.224\nAnd so we have to think about\nadding something to the mix, so\n\n74\n00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:51.726\nwe'll talk about really coming back so\nthat you have dual factor authentication,\n\n75\n00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:55.180\nthe idea of something like\nperhaps a USB key, right.\n\n76\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.175\nSo UB keys or things of that nature,\n\n77\n00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:00.443\nwhatever you may hear them\nreferred to as or talked about.\n\n78\n00:04:00.443 --> 00:04:05.054\nU2F is a standard, universal two factor\nauthentication really becoming more\n\n79\n00:04:05.054 --> 00:04:08.631\ncommon these days among web\nrelated services and in general,\n\n80\n00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:13.542\namong all the vendors that are in the FIDO\nAlliance around trying to figure this out.\n\n81\n00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:16.543\nReally probably the way,\nat least one of the key ways, that we see,\n\n82\n00:04:16.543 --> 00:04:17.632\nno pun intended right.\n\n83\n00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:19.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But one of the key ways we see people\n\n84\n00:04:19.684 --> 00:04:23.154\nmoving, so let's talk about\nsome things and so maybe, Dan,\n\n85\n00:04:23.154 --> 00:04:27.870\njust while I'm bringing this up real\nquick, aetting us ready to do something.\n\n86\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.189\nMaybe we could talk just about\nthe need for both complexity, right,\n\n87\n00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:35.253\nas we talked about, but also strength, and\nwhy those two factors are so important,\n\n88\n00:04:35.253 --> 00:04:38.249\nas I just bring up a site we're\ngonna take a look at real quick.\n\n89\n00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.513\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a really good idea\nbecause if you don't understand why\n\n90\n00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:44.432\nyou would need either a long password or\na complex password,\n\n91\n00:04:44.432 --> 00:04:48.170\nyou're not gonna get the conversation,\nright, so let's break that down.\n\n92\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.907\nWhy would I wanna use complexity?\n\n93\n00:04:49.907 --> 00:04:54.121\nLet's start there, well it's because there\nare computer programs that bad hackers\n\n94\n00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:58.054\nwill use to try to break the password\nusing what's called a brute force attack.\n\n95\n00:04:58.054 --> 00:05:01.701\nBasically you give it string of\ndifferent types of character sets, and\n\n96\n00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:05.590\nsay use each time of character set\nstarting with the most simplest form, and\n\n97\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.140\nworking your way through it with\nmultiple different combinations.\n\n98\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.650\nSo brute forcing,\nif zero doesn't work maybe one works,\n\n99\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.970\nif one doesn't work maybe two works,\nand if one zero doesn't work,\n\n100\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.530\none one, one two, one three, A,\nAB, ABC, that kinda stuff, right.\n\n101\n00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.240\nJust continually knocking at the door\nuntil the correct knock sequence\n\n102\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.470\nis gonna allow you to get in,\nright, so that's brute force.\n\n103\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.026\nSo if we use complexity,\n\n104\n00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:33.562\nit makes that a whole lot more difficult\nof a task to accomplish, right.\n\n105\n00:05:33.562 --> 00:05:37.643\nThat makes that longer for them to\nbe able to break through that level,\n\n106\n00:05:37.643 --> 00:05:42.703\nbecause of the complexity, because they're\nhaving to use multiple character sets.\n\n107\n00:05:42.703 --> 00:05:45.943\nIf I just say,\nI'm just using numbers, right, well,\n\n108\n00:05:45.943 --> 00:05:49.300\nthat's ten different characters\nthey're going to use.\n\n109\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.960\nBut if I use numbers and letters,\nnow it's 10 different characters,\n\n110\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.370\nplus 26 different characters\nof the alphabet, right?\n\n111\n00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.500\nWhat if I'm using uppercase and lowercase?\n\n112\n00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.080\nNow I've got 10, 26, and 26 again,\n\n113\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.750\nyou start to see that we\nincrease the complexity,\n\n114\n00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.970\nand increases the difficulty for them to\nbe able to break through second place.\n\n115\n00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.830\nBut that doesn't guard against\nwhat's called a dictionary attack.\n\n116\n00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.670\nSo If I use a password that I know\nis used by a lot of different people\n\n117\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.290\nthat might be found in a dictionary,\na word list basically,\n\n118\n00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.680\non a piece of software that can say well,\nI can also look through a word list and\n\n119\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.090\ntry each one of the words in the list and\nsee if that's a good password.\n\n120\n00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.890\nSo, we've got dictionary attacks,\nwe've got brute force attacks, and\n\n121\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.430\nwe've got to account for both.\n\n122\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.290\nComplexity is really good for\n\n123\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.970\nstopping brute force, length is really\ngood for stopping dictionary attacks.\n\n124\n00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.290\nAlso, throw on top of that trying\nto get the user to not use common\n\n125\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.535\ndictionary type words,\nkinda throw that on the mix of length.\n\n126\n00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:52.528\nWhich can be helpful because, I don't\nknow whole lot of words that are 12,15,\n\n127\n00:06:52.528 --> 00:06:55.142\n17 characters long and so on and so forth.\n\n128\n00:06:55.142 --> 00:06:59.566\nBut I can put two words together, that\naren't normally found together, right, and\n\n129\n00:06:59.566 --> 00:07:01.410\nnow we've got a much more complex,\n\n130\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.017\nmuch more strong password\nbecause of its length.\n\n131\n00:07:04.017 --> 00:07:05.910\nSo it's gonna take a lot longer for them,\n\n132\n00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.610\nit's gonna be uncommon for\nthem yo dictionary file somewhere.\n\n133\n00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.058\nSo if you start slapping things together,\nthrow a complexity on top of it, well,\n\n134\n00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:16.961\nnow you're guarding against\ndictionary attacks and\n\n135\n00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:19.945\nbrute force attacks if you\njust wrap all that into one.\n\n136\n00:07:19.945 --> 00:07:24.155\nAnd it's not too difficult to implement\nas far as an end-users' perspective\n\n137\n00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:24.867\ncomes from.\n\n138\n00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:28.454\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great explanation,\none thing as Daniel was wrapping up,\n\n139\n00:07:28.454 --> 00:07:32.892\nat the end he talked about taking a\npassword traditionally, maybe adding let's\n\n140\n00:07:32.892 --> 00:07:37.440\nsay two additional passwords or two words,\nof some kind, whatever they are.\n\n141\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.690\nEither smashing them together to create an\nuntraditional and therefore more complex,\n\n142\n00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.940\nless likely to be discovered through a run\nthrough of a dictionary program attack.\n\n143\n00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.450\nAnd we also can think of that, and\nthere's another term for that,\n\n144\n00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.800\neither complex password secure, we also\nhear the term, passphrase, a lot, right.\n\n145\n00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.209\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And so it may not be the traditional\n\n146\n00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:59.548\nway you described, it's not so much really\na passphrase, although it could be.\n\n147\n00:07:59.548 --> 00:08:02.711\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nBut a passphrase is more like a settings\n\n148\n00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:06.880\nof some kind or at least,\nwords that are added together.\n\n149\n00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.760\nSo instead of funny dog, it would be\nthe dog is red, or something like that.\n\n150\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.670\nAnd the idea will be that we're\nextending the complexity and\n\n151\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.750\nthat requirement for\nknowledge of a very complex string.\n\n152\n00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.420\nAnd using that to generate\nnot only the password but\n\n153\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.920\nultimately make it more complex\n&gt;&gt; I would also say that what's\n\n154\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.400\ncool about using passphrases and that's\nwhy I like passphrases very, very much.\n\n155\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.140\nIs because typical end user will say\nthis is too difficult for me to remember\n\n156\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.320\nbecause I've got Penciljogger76\nthat doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n157\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.210\nBut if I say, what was your\nfavorite cartoon as a kid, right?\n\n158\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.010\nAnd then I say it's GI Joe.\n\n159\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.410\nOkay, what's the tagline on every GI Joe?\n\n160\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.850\nAnd knowing is half the battle, and I make\nthat my password, spaces and everything.\n\n161\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.560\nThat is an extremely complex and\nlengthy password.\n\n162\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.480\n&gt;&gt; Well now it's complex and lengthy.\n\n163\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.740\n&gt;&gt; And it's easy to remember.\n\n164\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.362\n&gt;&gt; Passphrase.\n\n165\n00:08:56.362 --> 00:08:58.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes, passphrase it's easy to remember.\n\n166\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.210\n&gt;&gt; It is, but so, the challenge right,\nand this is where, again,\n\n167\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:06.280\nwe run into the idea of, hey,\nhow do we manage the human element, right?\n\n168\n00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.220\nBecause the problem becomes,\nand what Daniel described,\n\n169\n00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.930\nthe concept is great,\nthe approach is great.\n\n170\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.040\nBut the problem becomes, give the user\nthe opt in to participate, right?\n\n171\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.891\n&gt;&gt; So we have to get them to buy in, say\nhey not penciljogger76 or whatever it was.\n\n172\n00:09:20.891 --> 00:09:24.272\nBut hey, what was your favorite cartoon?\n\n173\n00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.915\nOkay GI Joe, great and\nwhatever the tagline from GI Joe is.\n\n174\n00:09:27.915 --> 00:09:30.384\nWhatever you go with,\nwhatever it would be.\n\n175\n00:09:30.384 --> 00:09:33.260\nProblem becomes something that is\n\n176\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.830\nnot necessarily easy to\nfind out about the user.\n\n177\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.140\nBut something that is common and\n\n178\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.580\nknown to the user that they're gonna\ndefault to again, becomes an issue.\n\n179\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.680\nBecause it's more likely that we would\nbe able to through social engineering or\n\n180\n00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.650\nother methods.\n\n181\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.100\nOf reconnaissance, footprinting,\nvarious names we give to these activities\n\n182\n00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.340\nas we go through the phases of trying to\nfigure out how to find that information.\n\n183\n00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.760\nUse it against you, right, ultimately\nwhether it's penetration testing,\n\n184\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.810\nvulnerability assessment,\nwhatever we call that activity.\n\n185\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.330\nThe idea behind it would be that if we\ngive the user the ability to choose,\n\n186\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.850\nthis is the problem I have by the way\nwith security questions, right.\n\n187\n00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.080\n&gt;&gt; .\nBecause you have a list of I don't know,\n\n188\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.560\nfive to ten that are very common globally,\ncertainly common in our industry.\n\n189\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.488\nMother's maiden name, right.\n\n190\n00:10:20.488 --> 00:10:21.680\n&gt;&gt; High school mascot.\n\n191\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, high school mascot, where you\nwent to school, what year you graduated,\n\n192\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.980\nfavorite food, that's that, whatever.\n\n193\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:33.458\nSo profiling somebody today on\nthe Internet and finding out a lot about\n\n194\n00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:37.170\nthose kind of things is not as difficult\nas people would lead you to believe.\n\n195\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.470\nAnd so the problem becomes if we're\ngiving users the ability to choose that\n\n196\n00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.370\ninitial thought process.\n\n197\n00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.160\nWhat we call the IV in cryptography\nthe initialization vector,\n\n198\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.090\nthat random string that we're\ngonna use to enhance the security.\n\n199\n00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.510\nAnd essentially combine with our\nknown plain text to push through and\n\n200\n00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.015\ncreate something more complex.\n\n201\n00:10:57.015 --> 00:11:00.114\nIf we give them he ability to\ngenerate that string for us,\n\n202\n00:11:00.114 --> 00:11:03.161\nchances are good they're\ngonna default to something.\n\n203\n00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:06.190\nNot perhaps like you suggested but\nsomething comfortable to them.\n\n204\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.620\nWhich means there's more likely or\n\n205\n00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.680\nthere is a higher likelihood that as a bad\nactor I may be able to discover that.\n\n206\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.150\nAnd again through the idea of brood\nforcing I may be able to create a non\n\n207\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.630\ntraditional approach to breaking in.\n\n208\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:23.220\nMaybe it's not the standard dictionary\nlist of passwords spelled 200\n\n209\n00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.000\ndifferent ways.\n\n210\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.131\nBut maybe it is a dictionary\nlist of a type,\n\n211\n00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:30.173\nwhere I've got facts about that user and\nI'm trying to use those to brute force.\n\n212\n00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:34.308\nAnd depending on what we're doing we\nreally have to start thinking outside that\n\n213\n00:11:34.308 --> 00:11:36.541\nproverbial box with regards to security.\n\n214\n00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:40.644\nTo make security not only practical as\nwe're talking about in this general theme,\n\n215\n00:11:40.644 --> 00:11:42.830\nbut also to make it applicable in a way.\n\n216\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.780\nAnd we talked about this before we came\non that it survives that window or\n\n217\n00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.730\nthat period where we need\nto enforce the requirement.\n\n218\n00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.985\nFor the password being unique and\ntherefore being available to us.\n\n219\n00:11:53.985 --> 00:11:59.000\nAnd part of it has to become,we managed\ndown the window that passwords exist for\n\n220\n00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.314\nbefore they're recycled.\n\n221\n00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:03.020\nCuz the longer they stay out,\nas you and I were talking about.\n\n222\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.490\nThe longer the password is out in\nthe wild without being challenged,\n\n223\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.460\nwithout being changed, the more likely\nit is, the higher the likelihood is.\n\n224\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.660\nIn other words,\nthat the password will be broken.\n\n225\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.660\nSo we have to be thinking about all of\nthese balls in the air simultaneously.\n\n226\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.750\nJuggling them to figure out how to\nmake passwords not only stronger or\n\n227\n00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.810\nmore complex.\n\n228\n00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.910\nBut also, we keep coming back to the idea,\n\n229\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.825\nhow do we transmit those\npasswords securely.\n\n230\n00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:31.045\nAnd ensure the users are gonna use them,\nbut then not expose them.\n\n231\n00:12:31.045 --> 00:12:34.175\nWe're gonna talk about some ways to\ndo that as well, so, join me here.\n\n232\n00:12:34.175 --> 00:12:38.415\nLet's kinda get started down the road of,\nlet's talk about some ways we can do this.\n\n233\n00:12:38.415 --> 00:12:42.697\nNot endorsing by any means or any way\njust by putting up one or more products.\n\n234\n00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:45.415\nWe're gonna talk about different companies\nfor a couple of minutes before we can\n\n235\n00:12:45.415 --> 00:12:48.135\ndo this, not endorsing any\none company over another.\n\n236\n00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:52.220\nThere are a lots and lots and\nlots of really great companies out there\n\n237\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.980\nthat do this kind of stuff, I just\nhappened to choose this one Secure Safe.\n\n238\n00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.150\nNumber one, because I have an account I\nuse their stuff from time to time, so\n\n239\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.820\nI'm familiar with it, and I can tell you\nfrom first hand experience it works well.\n\n240\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:09.420\nNumber two, as many companies do today,\nhave the online component,\n\n241\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.480\nthey have an app, it's available\non multiple mobile platforms.\n\n242\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.350\nShow you the version of that in\njust a minute sitting on my phone.\n\n243\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.450\nAnd they have a free option as\nwell as a pay option, again,\n\n244\n00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.210\nmost companies do this today.\n\n245\n00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.490\nBut it's nice to be able\nto use the free option for\n\n246\n00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.440\ncertain things to get\na sense of the service.\n\n247\n00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.500\nTry it out, see whether you like it or\nnot before you maybe opt in for\n\n248\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.410\nwhatever the price tag may be for\nindividual or companies.\n\n249\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:37.009\nSo one way to deal with passwords,\nsecurely managing them.\n\n250\n00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:41.284\nAnd I like this product because again,\nmost companies that do this, will do this,\n\n251\n00:13:41.284 --> 00:13:43.622\nit has a randomization generation feature.\n\n252\n00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:48.360\nSo you could generate random passwords\nthat will be considered highly secure and\n\n253\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.390\ncan do that as often as necessary.\n\n254\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.540\nI'll show you what I mean\nby that when we log in.\n\n255\n00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:57.190\nSo online mobile device capable and\nfriendly, multiple platforms\n\n256\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.955\nsupported Android, Apple, two major\nplatforms, obviously on the mobile side.\n\n257\n00:14:01.955 --> 00:14:05.695\nI would say Windows but we don't really\nhave that option for the most part anymore\n\n258\n00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:09.785\nunless you are talking about a laptop or\na tablet these days.\n\n259\n00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:11.215\nBut certainly there are.\n\n260\n00:14:11.215 --> 00:14:16.072\nI also like the fact that\nwe do have the ability,\n\n261\n00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:20.252\nhere, to be able to do\nmultifactor authentication.\n\n262\n00:14:20.252 --> 00:14:25.062\nFor validation of the login, encryption,\nencrypted storage of passwords, again,\n\n263\n00:14:25.062 --> 00:14:26.490\nall those things are common.\n\n264\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.120\nNone of this is unique to\nany one company today, but\n\n265\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.120\nall brought together as all the good\ncompanies that do this in one place.\n\n266\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.220\nAnd this one happens to be\nan internationally facing entity, so\n\n267\n00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.470\nit's available in multiple languages.\n\n268\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.330\nYou can see here I'm using\nthe English version, but\n\n269\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:45.345\nFrench, Italian, Dutch, European based\nsolution, so SecureSafe, I'm gonna log in.\n\n270\n00:14:45.345 --> 00:14:49.320\nI've already created an account but\nI wanna show you this, right.\n\n271\n00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.600\nSo we go ahead and we log in, so\ngive me just one second to do this.\n\n272\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.192\nAnd if we're gonna create a new account\njust so you could see before I do this\n\n273\n00:14:58.192 --> 00:15:01.173\npretty straightforward standard\nstuff username password.\n\n274\n00:15:01.173 --> 00:15:05.122\nRepeat the password log in opt in\nessentially and then you go ahead and\n\n275\n00:15:05.122 --> 00:15:09.180\nyou get to login, all right, so\nnothing unusual there, right?\n\n276\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.778\nGo ahead, Put this up,\n\n277\n00:15:17.118 --> 00:15:20.140\nAnd, Login.\n\n278\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.190\nNow I wanna talk about,\ncan we go full screen for a second?\n\n279\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.090\nI wanna talk about this prompter\ngetting down at the bottom.\n\n280\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.290\nAnd wanna talk about what happens with\nbrowsers when you store passwords.\n\n281\n00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.130\nBecause, again, this is one of those\nthings that gets people in trouble,right.\n\n282\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.250\nWe're talking about secure passwords,\n\n283\n00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.360\nwe're talking about\nthe good password hygiene.\n\n284\n00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.790\nSo let's put off to the side to\npassword management for just a moment,\n\n285\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.808\nwe'll be back in\nthe interface in a second.\n\n286\n00:15:41.808 --> 00:15:45.730\nBut in most browsers you will get a prompt\nsomething like what I have down below.\n\n287\n00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.480\nWould you like to store your password for\nwhatever site?\n\n288\n00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.736\nThis happens to be Microsoft Edge,\nChrome does the same thing,\n\n289\n00:15:51.736 --> 00:15:54.408\nany of the web browsers\nwill depending on settings.\n\n290\n00:15:54.408 --> 00:15:56.494\nSo what most people forget to do or\n\n291\n00:15:56.494 --> 00:16:01.415\ndon't realise they should do is that\nif you're storing passwords in the app.\n\n292\n00:16:01.415 --> 00:16:05.619\nSomebody gets a hold of your machine,\nobviously the likelihood goes up\n\n293\n00:16:05.619 --> 00:16:08.911\ndramatically that they can find\nout how to log in to one or\n\n294\n00:16:08.911 --> 00:16:10.890\nmore of the systems that you use.\n\n295\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.720\nAnd as a result, assume your identity, or\n\n296\n00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.870\nat least get access to bits and\npieces of information.\n\n297\n00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.100\nAnd various systems that can lead to\na lot more complexity and concern for\n\n298\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.520\nyou in terms of guarding your information.\n\n299\n00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.700\nEven something like this,\nif they're able to get in.\n\n300\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.550\nAnd a lot of times, again,\npeople opt in to these systems\n\n301\n00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.650\nfrom usability standpoints as\nopposed to security standpoints.\n\n302\n00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.310\nThere was an opt in on that logon\nscreen that said remember my username.\n\n303\n00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.230\nSo if I check that off,\nas some users do, not all, but\n\n304\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:43.240\nas some do, I've already got 50% of the\npuzzle piece I need to be able to log in.\n\n305\n00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.464\nRemember, we talk about passwords,\nwe're talking about usernames and\n\n306\n00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.980\npasswords together as\na factor of authentication.\n\n307\n00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.830\nThat's how we traditionally see that.\n\n308\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.530\nMost commonly used factor of\nauthentication in the world,\n\n309\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:58.130\nby the way, username and\npassword combination, even up until today.\n\n310\n00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:05.110\nAnd so if we get users out of the habit of\nchecking off the box remember my username.\n\n311\n00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:10.277\nOf storing passwords for\nease of use in a non-secured application,\n\n312\n00:17:10.277 --> 00:17:15.097\nlike a web browser,\nwe're gonna be fighting an uphill battle.\n\n313\n00:17:15.097 --> 00:17:18.989\nBut if we can do that, we're gonna\nsee significant enhancements and\n\n314\n00:17:18.989 --> 00:17:23.152\nsignificant moves forward in terms of\nthe level of security users bring to\n\n315\n00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:27.070\nthe table with the throught\nprocess about managing passwords.\n\n316\n00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.830\nSo if you are one of those people\nthat does store your passwords,\n\n317\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.260\nhere's the problem with this, right?\n\n318\n00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.320\nAgain, go back full screen for me so\nwe can see what I'm about to do.\n\n319\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.340\nSo if you're not familiar of where the\nsettings are, in one or more of the apps,\n\n320\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.380\nrather in the browser, no big deal.\n\n321\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.250\nThe nice thing is, if you do follow\nthe prompt, you'll be able to see what,\n\n322\n00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:49.240\nby browser, however they give you the help\nfile, this story is in Edge, right?\n\n323\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.180\nIf you happen to go in there,\n\n324\n00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.860\nwhat you'll find if you click on that\nlink is that you have to go up here.\n\n325\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.050\nSo let me just gonna click no,\nI don't wanna store that,\n\n326\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.820\nbut you go up into the settings\nin the browser traditionally.\n\n327\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.487\nSo I'm gonna go to Settings,\n\n328\n00:18:02.487 --> 00:18:06.435\nI'm gonna go down in Edge to the bottom\nhere under Advanced Settings.\n\n329\n00:18:06.435 --> 00:18:10.685\nSame thing in Chrome,\nyou have to go in Advanced Settings,\n\n330\n00:18:10.685 --> 00:18:13.840\nsame thing in Firefox, in Safari, right?\n\n331\n00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.420\nIn any of them, it's usually in\nthe Advanced Settings more often than not.\n\n332\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.410\nAnd when we go down to Advanced Settings,\nor into Advanced Settings rather,\n\n333\n00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:27.205\nwhat you'll see is privacy and services,\nusually or something to that effect.\n\n334\n00:18:27.205 --> 00:18:29.486\nOffer to save passwords is on by default,\n\n335\n00:18:29.486 --> 00:18:32.845\nbecause again,\nease of use over security in the browsers.\n\n336\n00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:37.058\nI love the fact that many companies,\nMicrosoft certainly is in this boat.\n\n337\n00:18:37.058 --> 00:18:41.385\nHey, we created a brand new secure\nbrowser, put secure in air quotes, right?\n\n338\n00:18:41.385 --> 00:18:45.580\nBrand new secure browser for you,\nforce everybody to start using the Edge.\n\n339\n00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.405\nEliminate a lot of the legitimate\nliabilities associated with web browsers,\n\n340\n00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:52.990\nwe don't support certain plug-ins,\ncertain functions are no longer allowed.\n\n341\n00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.562\nDefinitely, to give them\nprops where props are due,\n\n342\n00:18:55.562 --> 00:18:59.281\nbrowsing is more secure using a program\nlike Edge, because it does eliminate\n\n343\n00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:02.100\na lot of the obvious things\nthat potentially can go wrong.\n\n344\n00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.110\nBut one of the most obvious things is\nstill allow and enable by default, right?\n\n345\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.910\nLet you save passwords in the browser,\n\n346\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.200\nbecause it's an ease of use\nversus a security conversation.\n\n347\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.699\n&gt;&gt; And I've always seen that\nto be that sliding scale,\n\n348\n00:19:14.699 --> 00:19:18.844\nof the more the ease of use gets better,\nthe less secure it is.\n\n349\n00:19:18.844 --> 00:19:23.039\nAnd it's hard to find that balance,\nbecause you have to deal with those end\n\n350\n00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:26.385\nusers who love to complain about\nhow difficult it is to use.\n\n351\n00:19:26.385 --> 00:19:30.771\nAnd then they love to complain when you\ndecrease security for their ease of use,\n\n352\n00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:32.676\nabout how they were compromised.\n\n353\n00:19:32.676 --> 00:19:34.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a catch-22,\n\n354\n00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.724\nyou can't win [LAUGH].\n\n355\n00:19:35.724 --> 00:19:37.898\n&gt;&gt; It's a no-win scenario.\n\n356\n00:19:37.898 --> 00:19:39.218\n&gt;&gt; Rock, meet hard place, right?\n\n357\n00:19:39.218 --> 00:19:40.598\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n358\n00:19:40.598 --> 00:19:41.107\nAll right, so\n\n359\n00:19:41.107 --> 00:19:43.959\nnow this is the interesting thing you may\nnot know about most of these browsers.\n\n360\n00:19:43.959 --> 00:19:46.556\nSo I can turn off that, hey,\nstore my password function, right?\n\n361\n00:19:46.556 --> 00:19:49.068\nNo big deal, I could easily,\nyou see, I could turn that off.\n\n362\n00:19:49.068 --> 00:19:51.174\nBut here's the problem, you turn that off,\n\n363\n00:19:51.174 --> 00:19:55.090\nthe passwords that are already saved\nin the browser, are not removed.\n\n364\n00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.614\n&gt;&gt; They're still there?\n&gt;&gt; They are still there.\n\n365\n00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:59.427\n&gt;&gt; Do they need to go anywhere?\n\n366\n00:19:59.427 --> 00:20:00.456\nI mean, come on, right?\n\n367\n00:20:00.456 --> 00:20:01.361\n&gt;&gt; Why would they, right?\n\n368\n00:20:01.361 --> 00:20:02.016\nI mean, who's gonna come and take those?\n\n369\n00:20:02.016 --> 00:20:05.273\n&gt;&gt; I'm only turning this off to say,\nI don't want this.\n\n370\n00:20:05.273 --> 00:20:07.610\n&gt;&gt; But\nI wanna keep all the stuff I already did.\n\n371\n00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.433\nNow look, I can understand the thought\nprocess and I understand the reason why.\n\n372\n00:20:11.433 --> 00:20:14.262\nStep back and say, okay look,\nyou stored 20 passwords,\n\n373\n00:20:14.262 --> 00:20:16.365\nyou don't remember what the heck they are.\n\n374\n00:20:16.365 --> 00:20:19.768\nIf we just wipe them out without giving\nyou the opportunity to at least figure\n\n375\n00:20:19.768 --> 00:20:22.555\nthem out, chances are good that\nbad things are gonna happen.\n\n376\n00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:26.738\nSo I totally get the perspective that\nthe vendor comes from when they say, hey,\n\n377\n00:20:26.738 --> 00:20:29.183\nwe're not just gonna\nwipe out the passwords.\n\n378\n00:20:29.183 --> 00:20:32.235\nBut the problem is, they don't\nreally do a great job of informing\n\n379\n00:20:32.235 --> 00:20:34.885\nthe users that the passwords\nare still there.\n\n380\n00:20:34.885 --> 00:20:38.573\nAnd most users don't think about this,\nbecause again, they take this stuff for\n\n381\n00:20:38.573 --> 00:20:40.051\ngranted, so you disable this.\n\n382\n00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:43.017\nYou have this link here about\nmanage my saved passwords.\n\n383\n00:20:43.017 --> 00:20:47.993\nYou can see all the different usernames\nthat are there for a variety of things,.\n\n384\n00:20:47.993 --> 00:20:50.260\nAnd you could see that,\ndepending on what I am,\n\n385\n00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.340\nI've go all sort of different usernames.\n\n386\n00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.313\nYou're not seeing the passwords, but\n\n387\n00:20:54.313 --> 00:20:57.735\nyou are seeing the sites where I\nwould have saved passwords stored.\n\n388\n00:20:57.735 --> 00:21:01.656\nAnd so the problem becomes, if you don't\ngo in and start to manage that and\n\n389\n00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:05.958\nfigure that out, you're essentially\nleaving a huge liability on the table with\n\n390\n00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:08.380\npasswords and\npassword caching in the apps.\n\n391\n00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.512\nThis is one of the things you gotta think\nabout with secure password management,\n\n392\n00:21:12.512 --> 00:21:13.556\npassword hygiene.\n\n393\n00:21:13.556 --> 00:21:16.889\nThis idea of, what do we lave behind,\nand what's there and\n\n394\n00:21:16.889 --> 00:21:18.642\nhow do we manage that, right?\n\n395\n00:21:18.642 --> 00:21:22.139\nAnd so maybe taking the passwords\nout of something like a web browser,\n\n396\n00:21:22.139 --> 00:21:24.151\nwhere it's gonna be local to a machine,\n\n397\n00:21:24.151 --> 00:21:27.722\nwhere potentially there's liability\nif the machine is compromised.\n\n398\n00:21:27.722 --> 00:21:30.718\nMalware gets into this machine,\neven though nobody steals it,\n\n399\n00:21:30.718 --> 00:21:33.991\none of the things that malware goes\nafter traditionally is things like\n\n400\n00:21:33.991 --> 00:21:38.223\nthose usernames and password combinations,\nthose cookies that are stored in browsers.\n\n401\n00:21:38.223 --> 00:21:41.523\nThat's easy pickings as far as\nmost malware is concerned, and\n\n402\n00:21:41.523 --> 00:21:43.827\ndepending on how\nthe browser deals with it,\n\n403\n00:21:43.827 --> 00:21:47.397\ndepending on where we store those\npasswords, what form they take.\n\n404\n00:21:47.397 --> 00:21:50.936\nWe may be able to grab that\ninformation easily, exfiltrate it,\n\n405\n00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:54.553\nremove it from the system through\nsome sort of back door, right?\n\n406\n00:21:54.553 --> 00:21:57.680\nA remote access Trojan,\ntraditionally a rat of any variety,\n\n407\n00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.048\ncan communicate as long as that\nmachine is connected some way, and\n\n408\n00:22:01.048 --> 00:22:04.460\ntraditionally will without your\nknowledge if you're infected.\n\n409\n00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.140\nAnd those passwords are going\nacross to somebody,\n\n410\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.840\nwho knows who,\nwhoever's controlling that malware.\n\n411\n00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.720\nAnd this is why identity theft is\nthe number one crime in the world today.\n\n412\n00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.323\nAnd why more and more we're\nseeing evidence of the fact that,\n\n413\n00:22:17.323 --> 00:22:19.765\ndespite a lot of the things we talk about.\n\n414\n00:22:19.765 --> 00:22:23.454\nBecause end users are unfortunately\njust acting in ways that,\n\n415\n00:22:23.454 --> 00:22:26.933\nas we both pointed out,\nare more geared towards comfort and\n\n416\n00:22:26.933 --> 00:22:30.640\nease of use than security,\nthe eternal balancing act.\n\n417\n00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.650\nThis is why we continue to have\nto talk about these things,\n\n418\n00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.680\nbecause people just are not\ngetting the message.\n\n419\n00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.370\nSo if you remove those passwords,\n\n420\n00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.190\nget rid of them there,\nput them into some sort of password vault.\n\n421\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.106\nIt doesn't have to be this product,\nlike I said.\n\n422\n00:22:42.106 --> 00:22:46.374\nI don't care what you use, just showing\nyou one of many that are out there, but\n\n423\n00:22:46.374 --> 00:22:49.020\nthe idea would be if you\nstore them securely.\n\n424\n00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.582\nI like this one because,\nas I said, it stores online,\n\n425\n00:22:51.582 --> 00:22:53.160\nit's available from anywhere.\n\n426\n00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.362\nIt's got a mobile component that mirrors\nwhat you're gonna see in the app,\n\n427\n00:22:57.362 --> 00:22:59.737\nit lets you generate passwords securely.\n\n428\n00:22:59.737 --> 00:23:01.129\nLets you randomize them,\n\n429\n00:23:01.129 --> 00:23:04.996\nlets you use multi-factor authentication\nto be able to enable access.\n\n430\n00:23:04.996 --> 00:23:09.631\nGives you the added ability to store\nfiles online in encrypted forms securely,\n\n431\n00:23:09.631 --> 00:23:11.304\nnot just manage passwords.\n\n432\n00:23:11.304 --> 00:23:13.053\nOne of the reasons I like the product,\n\n433\n00:23:13.053 --> 00:23:16.130\nit does more than just traditional\npassword management, right?\n\n434\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.056\nSo it's doing a combination of things.\n\n435\n00:23:18.056 --> 00:23:23.179\nWhich more and more of the as a service\nsolutions we see in the cloud today is\n\n436\n00:23:23.179 --> 00:23:28.484\nthe standard, is the norm, and it makes\nit very easy as a one stop solution.\n\n437\n00:23:28.484 --> 00:23:30.944\nSo if we take a look,\nwe'll see I have two passwords,\n\n438\n00:23:30.944 --> 00:23:33.954\nthe first one is just the generic\none they throw in there to give you\n\n439\n00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:36.827\nan example of how it works,\nyou discount that one, right?.\n\n440\n00:23:36.827 --> 00:23:43.056\nThis one is one I created, obviously, with\na user name Mickey Mouse, ITPro.TV demo1.\n\n441\n00:23:43.056 --> 00:23:48.720\nI can go ahead and I can copy the username\nout of the vault, I can copy the password.\n\n442\n00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.733\nSo I have it available if I wanna use it,\nso I can put it in.\n\n443\n00:23:51.733 --> 00:23:55.842\nThen you can securely store single-use,\nmake available for\n\n444\n00:23:55.842 --> 00:23:58.694\nreuse somewhere else to provide, right?\n\n445\n00:23:58.694 --> 00:24:01.217\nBecause it's, in this case,\nrelated to a website,\n\n446\n00:24:01.217 --> 00:24:05.084\nI have a link where I could actually just\ngo right to the website from the and\n\n447\n00:24:05.084 --> 00:24:08.502\nwill bring up the page for me and\nthen allow me to provide the password so,\n\n448\n00:24:08.502 --> 00:24:10.660\nease of use is really\nnice with these things.\n\n449\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.060\nRight now if this is me as an individual\nusing this outside of the corporate\n\n450\n00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.260\nenvironment, right?\n\n451\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.490\nMy corporate entity whether\nit's ITPro TV or whoever,\n\n452\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.030\nwhatever the corporate\nentities you may have.\n\n453\n00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.600\nMay have policies around\nhow they deal with this.\n\n454\n00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.020\nYou may not be able to\nuse software like this,\n\n455\n00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.850\nit may not be available to you, right?\n\n456\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.340\nYou may not be able to put it on a mobile\ndevice because the mobile device\n\n457\n00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.150\nmanagement, concerns, and\npolicy base concerns.\n\n458\n00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.300\nThere's a lot of things to think through\nbefore you just say, this is perfect,\n\n459\n00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.380\nlet me go deploy this for my employees\nbecause it may or may not work right?\n\n460\n00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.120\nYou just may not have the environment\nthat will allow this to occur easily.\n\n461\n00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.810\nThis part is easy, this is web base.\n\n462\n00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.490\nAnybody can get to a web page,\nsign and create an account.\n\n463\n00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.460\nBut the problem is we now get\ninto an environment where, and\n\n464\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.870\na situation where we create\nanother major security liability.\n\n465\n00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.040\nWe refer to this generically as\nwhat we call, shadow IT, right?\n\n466\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.070\nThe idea that you've got other people\nspinning up infrastructure and managing\n\n467\n00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:10.630\ninformation outside of the central policy\nand central oversight that governance risk\n\n468\n00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:15.100\nand management oversight functions in the\nbusiness and there's no accountability.\n\n469\n00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:20.010\nThere is zero visibility from the business\nsite into these kinds of things.\n\n470\n00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:23.354\nImagine users are now putting their\ncorporate-related passwords and\n\n471\n00:25:23.354 --> 00:25:26.810\ncorporate-related information\ninto this site.\n\n472\n00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:31.010\nThe site itself is outside the control\nof the central IT function of business.\n\n473\n00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:35.370\nIt's owned by a separate entity, there's\nno way to manage that, specifically,\n\n474\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.310\nright, because it is independent.\n\n475\n00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.730\nThis opens up a whole new\nset of concerns for us.\n\n476\n00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.700\nSo I'm not suggesting that\nthis is necessarily, right?\n\n477\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.220\nGoing to be a good solution for\na lot of people in the corporate world.\n\n478\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.720\nI'm just pointing out that we\nreally have to be thinking\n\n479\n00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.810\nabout the mosaic of this architecture, and\nhow these pieces are gonna come together.\n\n480\n00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.160\nIn order to figure out what\nis gonna be a good solution,\n\n481\n00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.440\nbecause gone are the days where we\nsimply say, yeah, IT manages it.\n\n482\n00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.830\nThis is what you do.\n\n483\n00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.895\nHere's your password.\n\n484\n00:26:06.895 --> 00:26:11.226\nIt's 8, 9, 10, 12, I don't know, whatever\nthe number of characters wanna be.\n\n485\n00:26:11.226 --> 00:26:11.927\n&gt;&gt; 27 [LAUGH].\n\n486\n00:26:11.927 --> 00:26:14.904\n&gt;&gt; 27 [LAUGH].\nIt's 32 plus a random number we generate\n\n487\n00:26:14.904 --> 00:26:16.300\nevery time you log in.\n\n488\n00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.611\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n489\n00:26:17.611 --> 00:26:20.920\n&gt;&gt; It´s gonna be much\nmore involved than that.\n\n490\n00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.790\nBusinesses mirrored in that\nold model where all it is,\n\n491\n00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:28.690\nis that front loaded, here´s your\npassword, log in, and that´s all it is.\n\n492\n00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.142\nThose are the businesses that\nare getting hacked on a regular basis.\n\n493\n00:26:31.142 --> 00:26:35.326\nIf you haven´t made the leap into\nmulti-factor authentication in one or\n\n494\n00:26:35.326 --> 00:26:39.740\nmore forms, whatever you call that,\nhowever that´s being done today.\n\n495\n00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.910\nAs a business you've got a significant\nrisk looming over your head.\n\n496\n00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.550\nIt may not have come home yet, it may\nnot be roosting in your organization.\n\n497\n00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.350\nIt's only a matter of time and\nI don't mean that in a negative way.\n\n498\n00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.260\nI don't wanna jinx you.\n\n499\n00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.550\nI don't want you to think I'm\nthe naysayer in the group but\n\n500\n00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.781\nI’m being realistic with you about what\nI see in the world every day as I deal\n\n501\n00:26:58.781 --> 00:27:03.081\nwith customers and what my customers and\nmy students have been telling me for\n\n502\n00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:07.200\nyears, which is, yeah we see this risk,\nwe understand liability.\n\n503\n00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.620\nI see it when I audit customers.\n\n504\n00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.110\nI point it out to them.\n\n505\n00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.450\nWe have moved to address\nit in this way to minimize,\n\n506\n00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.770\na risk mitigation is the number one\nthing we got to think about doing.\n\n507\n00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.910\nWe can zero out certain risks but\nwe got to live with others.\n\n508\n00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:24.010\nAnd the ones we can control that are\ncentered within our sphere of influence,\n\n509\n00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.190\nwe'd be foolish not to\nfigure out how to take on.\n\n510\n00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.780\nAnd this is one of those pieces that\nwe often refer to as low-hanging\n\n511\n00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.800\nfruit, right?\n\n512\n00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.530\nI mean, it is difficult to figure\nout how to do this in a logical and\n\n513\n00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.800\nthoughtful way,\nit's expensive in some respects.\n\n514\n00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.900\nYou got 100,000 users worldwide, you wanna\nimplement a system to do stuff like this.\n\n515\n00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.400\nIt's gonna take time and money.\n\n516\n00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.150\nBut the risks associated with not doing\nsomething beyond simple user name and\n\n517\n00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.620\npassword authentication are so\n\n518\n00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.790\nso heavy today that you really\ncan't afford not to do something.\n\n519\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.560\nSo let's say we wanna create a user,\njust says the systems liked this again.\n\n520\n00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.650\nJust give you a sense.\n\n521\n00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.380\nAdd a username and a password.\n\n522\n00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:05.096\nWe have a really simple interface here,\nadd, you give a title to whatever this is,\n\n523\n00:28:05.096 --> 00:28:09.603\nright, so let's just call ITPRO TV\ndemo 2 just to give it a name.\n\n524\n00:28:09.603 --> 00:28:14.436\nWebsite right if it's going to\nrequire a website for logon so\n\n525\n00:28:14.436 --> 00:28:19.850\nwhatever it is let's do ITPro.TV just so\nwe have our website.\n\n526\n00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:23.090\nOur user name right let's\nuse user Don right?\n\n527\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.990\nWe'll put Don in there.\n\n528\n00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.710\nAnd then this is the part\nI like right password.\n\n529\n00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.350\nSo you'll see here number one\npassword is hidden by default.\n\n530\n00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.280\nSo somebody is lurking around\nthe office while I'm doing this.\n\n531\n00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.310\nPassword's not gonna show\nup on the screen, right?\n\n532\n00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.570\nWhatever I type is not gonna\nshow up unless I decide\n\n533\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.780\nto hide the password, right?\n\n534\n00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.110\nI can do that.\nI have that option, as you see.\n\n535\n00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.680\nI'm letting you see it so\nyou can see the logic.\n\n536\n00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.160\nBut also you'll see I have a strength\nindicator here, strong and weak, right?\n\n537\n00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.820\nSo you can see I'm typing something in,\nas I add, right?\n\n538\n00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.380\nDifferent things associated\nwith complexity upper case,\n\n539\n00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.240\nlower case, special characters,\nalphanumeric space right.\n\n540\n00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.822\nWe see it goes from strength\nweak to strength strong.\n\n541\n00:29:03.822 --> 00:29:08.210\nIf I don't like that password or it's\nnot random quote un quote or not right.\n\n542\n00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.800\nYou see I've repeated several letter\ncombinations in there twice in a row.\n\n543\n00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.820\nI repeated a special\ncharacter combination all bad\n\n544\n00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.690\nthought processes with regards\nto password generation,\n\n545\n00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:24.050\nall warning signs that the password,\nalthough it is considered strong.\n\n546\n00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:28.040\nActually may fall prey to certain\nkinds of analytical attacks because of\n\n547\n00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.340\ncharacter repetition.\n\n548\n00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.710\nWe never wanna see patterns when we\ntalk about generating strong passwords.\n\n549\n00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.630\nSo if I don't like that password I have\nthe option to generate a password here.\n\n550\n00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:43.000\nI can go in, it generates a password,\nnotice although there are going to be\n\n551\n00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.790\nsimilar characters, right, open and\nclose parentheses left and right side,\n\n552\n00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.150\nthey're not repetitive, there's no\nrepetition in that string at all.\n\n553\n00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.893\nIt is automatically\ngenerating a strong password,\n\n554\n00:29:52.893 --> 00:29:56.819\nI can specify to Daniel's pointing my way,\nnotice the default by the way,\n\n555\n00:29:56.819 --> 00:30:00.272\n[CROSSTALK] false characters and\nupper lower case alphanumeric.\n\n556\n00:30:00.272 --> 00:30:04.437\nI can extend that and notice as I\nextend that it does become big and\n\n557\n00:30:04.437 --> 00:30:09.650\nI go all the way up to 32 characters,\nwhich I liked a lot and this is random.\n\n558\n00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.610\nIf I do memorizable, right?\n\n559\n00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.447\nThat's a word, by the way.\n\n560\n00:30:12.447 --> 00:30:13.086\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n\n561\n00:30:13.086 --> 00:30:16.627\n&gt;&gt; I do memorizable, I mean we'll\nactually, not that that password may or\n\n562\n00:30:16.627 --> 00:30:20.633\nmay not be easily memorized, that's\nobviously something that's just relative\n\n563\n00:30:20.633 --> 00:30:22.970\nbut the point is I have\ndifferent options here.\n\n564\n00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.740\nI can generate a password that is\na little bit more user friendly,\n\n565\n00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.370\nlet's put it that way then perhaps my\nrandom password of 32 characters, right?\n\n566\n00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:34.280\nSo I can do that if I don't like that one,\njust recycle it get another one.\n\n567\n00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.220\nWhen I'm done, go ahead and do that.\n\n568\n00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.270\nI got my password there, right?\n\n569\n00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:45.130\nThen when I'm done save that off and now\nmy password is available to me and I have\n\n570\n00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:51.120\nit in the system and now that I have done\nthat give me a second just to log in here.\n\n571\n00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.840\nAnd bring up the app I'm just doing\nthis on my mobile device while\n\n572\n00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.520\nwe are doing this.\n\n573\n00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.930\nI'm gonna put it down on the table\nhere in a second so you can see it.\n\n574\n00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:03.226\nBut we have the app here, and\n\n575\n00:31:03.226 --> 00:31:08.241\nonce I log in And\n\n576\n00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:13.661\nI'm thinking, as I do this, as I often\nam forced to think about this stuff,\n\n577\n00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:19.070\nI'm thinking about this from\nthe perspective of the individual, right?\n\n578\n00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:23.360\nAnd/or the user who's gonna\nbe outside running around and\n\n579\n00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.903\nhaving to deal with this,\nyou just center that the way we did and\n\n580\n00:31:27.903 --> 00:31:31.262\nwe could bring that up\ntighter should be good.\n\n581\n00:31:31.262 --> 00:31:34.281\nYou wanna bring that up there\nwe go just kinda do that so\n\n582\n00:31:34.281 --> 00:31:37.388\nyou could see that just a little\nbit off the side there.\n\n583\n00:31:37.388 --> 00:31:42.659\nSo my trusty secure mobile device,\nnotice you actually can't see\n\n584\n00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:48.316\nit on the top it's there but my cell\nphone you can see what kind of phone.\n\n585\n00:31:48.316 --> 00:31:51.635\nI'm running a Blackberry for\nthose of you that don't know me and\n\n586\n00:31:51.635 --> 00:31:55.322\nhaven't heard me go on and on about\nsecure mobile devices but you can see\n\n587\n00:31:55.322 --> 00:31:59.341\nthe interface very straight forward\nvery easy there's my ITPROTV demo two.\n\n588\n00:31:59.341 --> 00:32:02.472\nSo if I click or\nselect Give it just a second.\n\n589\n00:32:02.472 --> 00:32:06.652\nYou'll see it does come up gives me\nthe same information same capabilities,\n\n590\n00:32:06.652 --> 00:32:07.950\ncopy that and use that.\n\n591\n00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.370\nNow this goes to the idea of okay great,\nso\n\n592\n00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:14.230\nwhat if somebody steals, right,\nmy phone and gets access to the app?\n\n593\n00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.900\nIf they logon they can\nessentially get the password.\n\n594\n00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.390\nSame thing would happen of course\nif they login to the website right.\n\n595\n00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:24.280\nSo I do have to think about the fact\nthat I have to keep this in mind.\n\n596\n00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.940\nAnd I have to be concerned about this,\nright?\n\n597\n00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.460\nBecause if somebody does\nget the mobile device,\n\n598\n00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.430\nI may have given them a much easier\npathway to getting the password.\n\n599\n00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.022\nSo I have to think about that.\n\n600\n00:32:34.022 --> 00:32:39.360\nI use, like most people do on their\nphones, right, a PIN to be able to log in.\n\n601\n00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.580\nSo it is secure to a certain point.\n\n602\n00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.170\nBut it's a multi digit PIN,\nand multi digit PINs,\n\n603\n00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.670\ndepending on how long they are,\n\n604\n00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.890\nare obviously subject to potential brute\nforcing, like everything else, right.\n\n605\n00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.502\nI mean, there's a limit to what\nyou can do in some cases today.\n\n606\n00:32:53.502 --> 00:32:57.378\nSo you do want to remember that,\nyou do want to keep that in mind, but\n\n607\n00:32:57.378 --> 00:33:01.868\nif it's giving you the flexibility as\nwell as potentially the security to work\n\n608\n00:33:01.868 --> 00:33:02.830\nwith this.\n\n609\n00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:06.760\nI just like the idea that if I don't have\nmy laptop with me, but I'd still need to\n\n610\n00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.746\nget on to a site, I do have the ability to\noperate, because I, cuz I'm on the go so\n\n611\n00:33:10.746 --> 00:33:14.710\nmuch, operate off my phone a great deal,\nas many of us do today, right?\n\n612\n00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:19.200\nI know many people that the phone is their\nprimary tool, their primary mechanism of\n\n613\n00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.470\ninteracting with the world and\nsurfing and doing whatever.\n\n614\n00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.900\nSo having that capability\ndoes make a lot of sense.\n\n615\n00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.880\nBut we've gotta balance that with\nthe concern around losing the device and\n\n616\n00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.750\nworrying about whether or\n\n617\n00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:34.030\nnot it is gonna be successfully\nrecovered or can you wipe it out?\n\n618\n00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:37.610\nThis gets into the idea of bringing in\nthe mobile device management piece.\n\n619\n00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.040\nHaving the private and\npublic profile and view on the device.\n\n620\n00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.080\nThe ability to policy manage and wipe out\nthe device whether using something like\n\n621\n00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.020\nwhatever the device\nmanagement platform may be.\n\n622\n00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.980\nThere or many, many of them today.\n\n623\n00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.880\nBut whatever you may be using,\nif you can reach in with policy and\n\n624\n00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.870\nwith secure and assurance and\n\n625\n00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:01.410\nwipe that device if it's lost, I'm a lot\nless concern about maintaining an app and\n\n626\n00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.840\nmaintaining those passwords here that\nit would be if we can't do that.\n\n627\n00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.760\nSo just something to consider, right?\n\n628\n00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.490\nSo we have this.\n\n629\n00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:10.090\nWe have this capability.\n\n630\n00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.650\nWhat we also certainly have\nto start thinking about,\n\n631\n00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.460\nwe're gonna come back talk about\nmore of this in another episode,\n\n632\n00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.640\ncuz obviously really just\nscratching the surface here.\n\n633\n00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.235\nAnd we've just really created and\n\n634\n00:34:19.235 --> 00:34:21.995\nreally painted a very broad\nbrushstroke picture for this.\n\n635\n00:34:21.995 --> 00:34:25.807\nBut you're using not just\ntechnology like this online, but\n\n636\n00:34:25.807 --> 00:34:29.880\nwhat about just some basic blocking and\ntackling.\n\n637\n00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:35.190\nPolicy based management, group policy\nin the case of Windows, security on\n\n638\n00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:38.650\nthe desktop than the domain environment,\nwhat are those policy settings we can use\n\n639\n00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:42.990\nto control and constrain users around\npasswords and secure management of them?\n\n640\n00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:44.730\nWe'll take a look at some of that.\n\n641\n00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:48.340\nAlso want to make sure that we're able\nto talk about how to create the USB\n\n642\n00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.120\nkey that I was talking about,\na UB key in one for or another.\n\n643\n00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.600\nWe could do this and certainly pay to get\nUB keys and pay to use online services,\n\n644\n00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.220\nbut you can generate your own for\nfree as long as you have a USB device.\n\n645\n00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.350\nI'm gonna show you a piece of software\ncalled Raptor that we can use from\n\n646\n00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.620\nSourceForge to be able to do\nthat on a Windows based machine.\n\n647\n00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.791\nAnd then as long as you have that key\ninserted for continuous authentication,\n\n648\n00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:14.960\nwe're able to provide security and be\nable to do that if we don't we're able to\n\n649\n00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.512\nessentially lock out\nthe access to the system.\n\n650\n00:35:17.512 --> 00:35:18.145\nSo we again,\n\n651\n00:35:18.145 --> 00:35:22.192\nbring back these ideas and these thoughts\nabout how we're gonna do this securely.\n\n652\n00:35:22.192 --> 00:35:26.416\nBut the most important thing just wrapping\nup our first episode here with regards to\n\n653\n00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:30.820\npassword management, good password hygiene\nreally comes back to this idea Daniel and\n\n654\n00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.620\nI were talking about of how\ndo we train our users right?\n\n655\n00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.560\nI often think about how\ndo you train your dragon.\n\n656\n00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.190\nDid I say that right?\n\n657\n00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you did actually.\n\n658\n00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:41.550\n&gt;&gt; So I think about how you train your\nusers because the secret ingredient and\n\n659\n00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:45.375\nthe concern we have in this conversation\nis that can we get the user\n\n660\n00:35:45.375 --> 00:35:49.370\nmindset away from the traditional\nease of use thought process?\n\n661\n00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.242\nAnd can we get them either bought in or\nmandated or some combination,\n\n662\n00:35:53.242 --> 00:35:57.341\nright, cuz it's normally the carrot and\nthe stick more often than not.\n\n663\n00:35:57.341 --> 00:36:00.506\nBut can we essentially through\npolicy based management and\n\n664\n00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:03.481\nthrough really good governance risk and\ncompliance and\n\n665\n00:36:03.481 --> 00:36:07.088\ngeneral oversight in the business,\nI think if we're focusing more\n\n666\n00:36:07.088 --> 00:36:10.530\non the enterprise thought process\nright now than individuals.\n\n667\n00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.850\nAs an individual you've gotta figure\nout what makes sense for you.\n\n668\n00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.370\nAnd you've gotta figure out how much\npain as well as how much potential\n\n669\n00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.710\nconcern you wanna bear with regards\nto your own passwords, right?\n\n670\n00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.880\nThat's something you do for yourself.\n\n671\n00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.800\nBut in the enterprise we have\nboth the capability, and\n\n672\n00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.640\nunfortunately sometimes the liability of\nhaving to manage on behalf of others.\n\n673\n00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.120\nAnd because of that we can\nset certain standards, right?\n\n674\n00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.830\nAnd so from a policy perspective,\n\n675\n00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.120\nwe actually can decide to push through and\nsay,\n\n676\n00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.100\nyou know what, we're gonna mandate through\npolicy, you have a 12 character password.\n\n677\n00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.110\nYou may not like that and you may not\nwant that, but that's the minimum.\n\n678\n00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.980\nAnd if you don't like that you're\nnot gonna be able to use the system.\n\n679\n00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:52.800\nAnd we can mandate that we will use\nsingle session or single use passwords.\n\n680\n00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.350\nSo every time you log on you gonna have\nto log in with a special password or\n\n681\n00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.170\nchallenge or\nsomething we're gonna generate.\n\n682\n00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:02.110\nOr we're gonna spin new users up,\ngenerate a one time password for them and\n\n683\n00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.960\nforce them to reset their\npassword when they log in.\n\n684\n00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.220\nBut making sure it's complex enough and\n\n685\n00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.090\nit meets the minimum requirements\novercomes a lot of those objectives.\n\n686\n00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.900\nSo we're gonna talk about some\nof that stuff as well, but\n\n687\n00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.070\nit's gonna come down to culture.\n\n688\n00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.770\nIt's gonna come down to the culture\nof security In the organization.\n\n689\n00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.850\nWe as IT professionals,\nyou a security professionals,\n\n690\n00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.790\nyou got to think about focusing\non the mindset of the individual,\n\n691\n00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:28.110\ngetting them to buy in, changing that\nmindset, changing that thought processing\n\n692\n00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.313\nis how you achieve a more\nsecure solution over time.\n\n693\n00:37:31.313 --> 00:37:35.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam, obviously,\nat the end of here this episode,\n\n694\n00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.940\nhopefully you guys are starting to see\nthe importance of why we're really\n\n695\n00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.970\nkind of putting a push on this, especially\nwhen Adam talks about user buy in.\n\n696\n00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.440\nWe have to get them to\nunderstand that this is\n\n697\n00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.030\nan extremely important thing because,\nthey are a link in the security chain.\n\n698\n00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.250\nEverybody that's a part of\nan organization is part of its security.\n\n699\n00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:57.710\nThey're the weakest link because\nthey're using a horrible password,\n\n700\n00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.950\nthen they're going to expose us and\nthere's a risk involved in that.\n\n701\n00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.110\nAnd that is something that\nthey are responsible for\n\n702\n00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.220\njust as much as us in IT are as well.\n\n703\n00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.530\nReally want to come back and see that\nimplementation of policy that is going to\n\n704\n00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.870\ngo out to our end users that hopefully\nwe get them to buy in to and\n\n705\n00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:18.010\nnot complain too heavily about and\nimplement that into our organization.\n\n706\n00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.910\nSo definitely join us back for\nthat part two.\n\n707\n00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.570\nAs for this episode though, it looks\nlike our clock is screaming at us for\n\n708\n00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.700\nmercy ,so we're gonna call it a day.\n\n709\n00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.200\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n710\n00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:27.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n711\n00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.708\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n712\n00:38:30.392 --> 00:38:36.232\n[MUSIC]\n\n713\n00:38:36.232 --> 00:38:39.259\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for
