Great, thanks for making it easy on me.\n\n8\n00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.423\n&gt;&gt; I know, I love when Daniel does that.\n\n9\n00:00:33.423 --> 00:00:38.420\nThe total expert on this, like well-\n&gt;&gt; No pressure, no pressure, no pressure.\n\n10\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.360\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n11\n00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.498\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n12\n00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:41.951\nWell Vonne, it's great to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:44.065\n&gt;&gt; I know, well I'm really excited for\nthis series-\n\n14\n00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:45.085\n&gt;&gt; Me too.\n\n15\n00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:47.160\n&gt;&gt; To learn all about our Premiere and\nsome video editing.\n\n16\n00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.154\nAnd we're starting from\nthe very beginning.\n\n17\n00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:50.280\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna take it from\n\n18\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.725\na base level and move up, because we\ntalked about it, and this is our overview.\n\n19\n00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:54.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.363\n&gt;&gt; We're actually filming this last, and\n\n21\n00:00:56.363 --> 00:00:59.381\nwe've actually gone through all\nthe episodes and I've learned a lot.\n\n22\n00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:01.944\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; But I wanted to kind of go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:06.213\njust get a quick frame of reference for\njust some terminology.\n\n24\n00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:08.383\nAnd I love how we-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n25\n00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:10.066\n&gt;&gt; Read me cuz-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the read me file,\n\n26\n00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.369\nno one ever reads the read me file.\n\n27\n00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.507\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Read the read me file.\n\n28\n00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.307\n&gt;&gt; Yes, read the instructions.\n\n29\n00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:16.155\n&gt;&gt; Please read the instructions.\n\n30\n00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:20.972\n&gt;&gt; And so one thing that I do\nwhen I'm learning a product is\n\n31\n00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:24.233\nI wanna know the right terminology.\n\n32\n00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:29.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that way I can use it wrongly.\n\n33\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.263\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, we do have some standardized\nlanguage within editing and within Adobe,\n\n34\n00:01:34.263 --> 00:01:37.772\nbut you're always going to\nsay something that's close.\n\n35\n00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:42.496\nFor example, the timeline is a tool and\nsequences go in it, but\n\n36\n00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:47.773\neverybody just says show me the sequence,\nshow me the sequence tool.\n\n37\n00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:48.286\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:48.286 --> 00:01:50.355\n&gt;&gt; I mean it just happens that way.\n\n39\n00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:54.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,and I think it's from just being\nin the industry and you just start using\n\n40\n00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:58.529\nthis terminology and you just use it like\nit's regular language for you, but for\n\n41\n00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:02.572\nme like an outsider coming in, it's like\nwait, was that a sequence or a clip?\n\n42\n00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:05.590\nWait, is it a clip and\na media the same thing?\n\n43\n00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.870\n&gt;&gt; It's a media and file and\nthen everything's going crazy so, yeah.\n\n44\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.828\nThere are some things you\nwanna embed in there.\n\n45\n00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:11.414\nDon't get it wrong but\n\n46\n00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:15.920\nin other cases you can fudge out\na couple of times, it's okay.\n\n47\n00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I know when we go\nthrough all these episodes you\n\n48\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.420\nreally explain all of this and\nI'm, I get it.\n\n49\n00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.987\nBut it took me a couple episodes to\nkinda clear it in my mind of exactly\n\n50\n00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:27.689\nthe sequence and the segments.\n\n51\n00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.282\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So I've actually made a few notes.\n\n52\n00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.245\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you don't mind,\n\n53\n00:02:30.245 --> 00:02:32.501\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nask you a few things and\n\n54\n00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:34.614\ndo a quick overview of\nexplaining something.\n\n55\n00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:37.907\n&gt;&gt; Hit me with the notes, just don't\nhit me like you hit me after the show.\n\n56\n00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:38.407\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n57\n00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:39.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, I'll-\n\n58\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.039\n&gt;&gt; Help me.\n\n59\n00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.367\n&gt;&gt; I'll be gentle. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; All right.\n\n60\n00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:42.178\nGood.\n\n61\n00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:43.940\n&gt;&gt; So we have media versus clip,\n\n62\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.650\nis it the same thing?\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, no.\n\n63\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.887\nSo media is essence, it's what you shot on\n\n64\n00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:54.174\nyour camera or it's the actual file that\nyou've, you can see it as a quick timer,\n\n65\n00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:58.589\na JPEG, or something like that.\nOnce it is brought into Premiere,\n\n66\n00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:02.171\nit becomes what we call a clip or\na masterclip.\n\n67\n00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.138\nThat is metadata that\n\n68\n00:03:04.138 --> 00:03:08.100\nrepresents the media.\nAnd that's why clips, you can change.\n\n69\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.780\nYou can make them longer or shorter.\n\n70\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.501\nYou can rename them.\n\n71\n00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:12.452\nYou can add effects to them and\n\n72\n00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:16.232\nit doesn't affect the actual media.\nIt stays the same.\n\n73\n00:03:16.232 --> 00:03:17.840\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like a nickname,\n\n74\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.389\nlike we're nicknaming this\nparticular thing that's [CROSSTALK]\n\n75\n00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.223\n&gt;&gt; Nicknaming or I often say,\n\n76\n00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:26.985\nthe media is the parts and\nthe clip is the instructions.\n\n77\n00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:28.029\nAnd I can change it,\n\n78\n00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:32.148\nI could rewrite the instructions, put it\nin a nice glossy binder, do all that,\n\n79\n00:03:32.148 --> 00:03:34.251\ndoesn't change the parts.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n80\n00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:34.763\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n81\n00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:36.087\n&gt;&gt; Great, all right, wonderful.\n\n82\n00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:38.823\nNow when we talk about audio, I feel it's\n\n83\n00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:43.904\nthe whole of how we capture it and then\nthere's an audio clip cuz we understand\n\n84\n00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:47.170\nthat clips when it's coming to Premiere.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n85\n00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.775\n&gt;&gt; But then when it goes somewhere\n\n86\n00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:50.975\nelse it becomes a track?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n87\n00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:52.760\nso-\n&gt;&gt; Or am I jumping the gun a little?\n\n88\n00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.290\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, you're fine, you're fine.\n\n89\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.560\nThe thing is when you get into audio,\n\n90\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.910\npeople who do an audio has a very,\nvery specialized language,\n\n91\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.260\nmostly because they don't\nwant to talk to anybody else.\n\n92\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.030\nAnd if you don't speak their language\nthey'll just go, [SOUND] and walk away.\n\n93\n00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.200\nWhen we bring in media, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.100\nWe think of that as input and\nwe say that something has channels.\n\n95\n00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.470\nSo if you record on a camera,\nyou have two channels maybe, or\n\n96\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.550\nsome cameras record like eight channels.\n\n97\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.260\nOr maybe you recorded on a device\nthat gave you four channels.\n\n98\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.362\nThat's considered an input.\n\n99\n00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:30.285\nSo when you put it into a sequence,\nthat's when you see\n\n100\n00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:35.325\nmovies where guys do a mixer and\ndoing stuff like [SOUND].\n\n101\n00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:35.871\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n102\n00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:38.590\n&gt;&gt; And they say we need more tracks, man.\n\n103\n00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.934\nThat's the thing is that\non the output side,\n\n104\n00:04:41.934 --> 00:04:45.430\nwhich is the sequence side,\nyou have tracks.\n\n105\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.686\nAnd that's why something with\ntwo channels, or eight channels,\n\n106\n00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:51.137\ncan go in to one track.\n\n107\n00:04:51.137 --> 00:04:52.670\n&gt;&gt; And that's where I use the wrong C.\n\n108\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.237\nI said clips but when you said channels,\nI was yes, that's right.\n\n109\n00:04:56.237 --> 00:04:56.840\n&gt;&gt; Channels.\n\n110\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.090\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you were saying channels.\n\n111\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.700\nAnd I think that's another one where\nthere's the input and the output are like,\n\n112\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.930\nhow you captured it with your device-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n113\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.410\n&gt;&gt; When it comes into Premiere and\nthen how it goes out of Premiere and\n\n114\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.800\nall that kind of stuff-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n115\n00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.700\nI think we talked a couple of times,\nI like to think\n\n116\n00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.020\nof the left side as the input side and\nthe right side is the output side.\n\n117\n00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.895\nThat's why you have different language,\nlike we have clips and channels and\n\n118\n00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:26.261\ngain for audio, when we're adjusting how\nloud or soft it is, we're adjusting gain.\n\n119\n00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:28.932\nCuz we always said on audio input,\nyou have gain.\n\n120\n00:05:28.932 --> 00:05:31.907\nOn output, you have volume.\n\n121\n00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:33.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n122\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.062\n&gt;&gt; So left side, we have clips,\nwe have channels, we have gain.\n\n123\n00:05:37.062 --> 00:05:41.090\nOn the right side,\nwhich is the output side,\n\n124\n00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.980\nwe have segments, we have volume,\nand we have tracks.\n\n125\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we explain all of this.\n\n126\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.040\nYou explain it very well\nin all these episodes.\n\n127\n00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.340\nSo again, we're just doing\nlisten to the terminology.\n\n128\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.530\nWhen we're saying left and right,\n\n129\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.310\nwe're talking about the physical\nsides of the program.\n\n130\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.386\n&gt;&gt; We can take a quick look right\nnow at the interface, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:07.190\nBecause what we do is we have panels.\n\n132\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.530\nSo we have panels, we have panel groups.\n\n133\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.795\nAnd then everything that's\nsort of on the left side.\n\n134\n00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:16.325\nOkay, everything that's on\nthis left side right here.\n\n135\n00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:19.953\nThe source and the project,\nthat's what I'm considering the left side,\n\n136\n00:06:19.953 --> 00:06:22.442\nthe input side because this\nwhere we get our clips.\n\n137\n00:06:22.442 --> 00:06:27.891\nThe source area is where we take\na clip and we modify it, okay?\n\n138\n00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:34.960\nI'm only gonna take this much right here,\nand you'll learn this as I'm doing it.\n\n139\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.332\nI have marked a segment of\nthis that I'm going to use,\n\n140\n00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:43.033\nand then I bring it down\nhere to the sequence.\n\n141\n00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:49.081\nAnd now I've used a segment of this clip\nwhich now I can adjust it to volume or\n\n142\n00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:52.640\non this side I could've adjusted its gain.\n\n143\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and see right there, the whole,\nokay here is the clip we went in and\n\n144\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.477\nthe source.\n\n145\n00:06:56.477 --> 00:07:00.704\nThat's not a part of just understanding\nthe names of the windows or\n\n146\n00:07:00.704 --> 00:07:03.798\npanels, cuz we use those\nwords interchangeably\n\n147\n00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:07.362\nwithin what we call the workspace\nof any Adobe product.\n\n148\n00:07:07.362 --> 00:07:08.894\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n149\n00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:11.054\nCuz all of these window panel\nthingies that we go in.\n\n150\n00:07:11.054 --> 00:07:12.858\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's like project,\n\n151\n00:07:12.858 --> 00:07:16.205\nokay that's that name, source,\nand then it comes down.\n\n152\n00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:19.030\nAgain that terminology of go up, go up,\n\n153\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.620\ngo up and-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n154\n00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n155\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.055\n&gt;&gt; And that's the thing I couldn't say.\n\n156\n00:07:22.055 --> 00:07:25.320\nCuz technically this is\nthe project panel group.\n\n157\n00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.750\nAnd there are things within it.\n\n158\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.712\nThis is the source panel group.\n\n159\n00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:30.810\nThe source panel which has a panel group.\n\n160\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.130\nAnd I could make that very clear\nthe entire time, but then I would go very,\n\n161\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.940\nvery slow and be worried more about\nsaying it correctly than having fun and\n\n162\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.630\nshowing you what to do.\n\n163\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; One last thing I want to show about\n\n164\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.260\nthe left-right, and\nto explain channel tracks.\n\n165\n00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.190\nThis left side in the sequence,\n\n166\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.640\nand we're gonna talk about this\nseveral times, represents the source.\n\n167\n00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.080\nAnd it has a video channel and\nan audio channel.\n\n168\n00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:02.808\nThis represents the sequence which has\nthree video tracks and four audio tracks.\n\n169\n00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:09.380\n&gt;&gt; That's where you're actually\ndoing all of the editing.\n\n170\n00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.408\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's where we actually.\n\n171\n00:08:10.408 --> 00:08:14.418\n&gt;&gt; Even within Premiere, we can do all\nthese, I keep calling them layers, and\n\n172\n00:08:14.418 --> 00:08:18.490\nI keep referring to it throughout the\nseries, because I see it as layers, but\n\n173\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.079\nthese are tracks [CROSSTALK].\n\n174\n00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:24.142\n&gt;&gt; If you're a Photoshop user or even\nsometimes an After Effects user coming\n\n175\n00:08:24.142 --> 00:08:28.418\ninto Premiere, you're gonna use\nthe language that you're used to, okay?\n\n176\n00:08:28.418 --> 00:08:30.973\nAnd eventually you'll realize\nwhen you bounce back and\n\n177\n00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:34.890\nforth between applications there's new\nterms of different terms because different\n\n178\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.515\ntypes of professionals use\ndifferent apps all the time.\n\n179\n00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:40.441\nIt happens, don't feel bad, yeah.\n\n180\n00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:42.456\nSome people are just gonna tell you, well,\n\n181\n00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:44.530\nthey actually really\nshould be same tracks.\n\n182\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.070\nI mean, it's fine.\n\n183\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n184\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Just take the ribbing and move on.\n\n185\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.223\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\nAnd\n\n186\n00:08:49.223 --> 00:08:53.029\nit's because I've been with you this\nwhole week and you're going through this.\n\n187\n00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:53.588\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n188\n00:08:53.588 --> 00:08:55.217\nYep, there's that terminology.\n\n189\n00:08:55.217 --> 00:08:58.485\nIt's already clicking,\nthe more you hear it and\n\n190\n00:08:58.485 --> 00:09:03.583\nthe more you see it in action as we go\nthrough everything, it will get it, but\n\n191\n00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:09.028\nI just wanted to kinda go through some of\nthose super basics of what is a sequence-\n\n192\n00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:09.842\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n193\n00:09:09.842 --> 00:09:12.270\n&gt;&gt; Because the sequence is over on\nthe timeline, and that's where-\n\n194\n00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.185\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n195\n00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:15.311\n&gt;&gt; We'll be doing the editing,\n\n196\n00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:19.085\nbut the segments are what\nyou want out of your clips.\n\n197\n00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:20.611\n[CROSSTALK] that was your media.\n\n198\n00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:22.668\n&gt;&gt; And then it becomes a game.\n\n199\n00:09:22.668 --> 00:09:23.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n200\n00:09:23.725 --> 00:09:24.352\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n201\n00:09:24.352 --> 00:09:28.762\nAnd so we'll use different words-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n202\n00:09:28.762 --> 00:09:32.300\n&gt;&gt; Throughout here, but we're just kinda-\n&gt;&gt; And you'll catch us doing that and\n\n203\n00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.854\nfun with it.\n\n204\n00:09:32.854 --> 00:09:37.201\nHave fun with the fact that you caught\nus saying maybe something slightly,\n\n205\n00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.850\nhave fun with it please.\n\n206\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I do the same\nthing that the That's not right.\n\n207\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.175\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n208\n00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:45.977\n&gt;&gt; No, bad kitty.\n&gt;&gt; Bad kitty.\n\n209\n00:09:45.977 --> 00:09:46.564\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\nSo\n\n210\n00:09:46.564 --> 00:09:48.599\nI just want to kind of get a frame-up and\n\n211\n00:09:48.599 --> 00:09:51.018\nwe do mention a lot about\nhot keys in this show.\n\n212\n00:09:51.018 --> 00:09:53.030\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we talk a lot about hot keys.\n\n213\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.570\nThere are some very simple ones.\n\n214\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.010\nThe ones that I mention are the ones you\nprobably gonna want to commit to memory or\n\n215\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.920\nwrite down.\n\n216\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.870\nAnd then again,\nI will show this several times,\n\n217\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.380\nI'm just gonna go back\nto Premiere Pro here.\n\n218\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.845\nThere is a keyboard shortcuts area\nthat you can fire up and look through.\n\n219\n00:10:08.845 --> 00:10:14.363\nThe other thing is too, I didn't really\nmention this in lessons, but one\n\n220\n00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:20.160\nthing that a lot of people do is instead\nof adding or modifying, they remove.\n\n221\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.220\nBecause they don't use a lot, and they\nwill basically clear the keyboard out as\n\n222\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.960\nmuch as they can and\nthen only add in what they need.\n\n223\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.706\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think it's just\nhow you wanna approach it but\n\n224\n00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:33.255\nput in those hot keys to memory.\n\n225\n00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:37.952\nAnd in the show notes, we do have a link\nto the Adobe website that has shortcuts\n\n226\n00:10:37.952 --> 00:10:39.554\nfor both Windows and Mac.\n\n227\n00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:42.687\nAnd here is another side note,\nwe are using a Mac here-\n\n228\n00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:43.780\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we're just using a Mac.\n\n229\n00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.112\n&gt;&gt; And so we're using Mac terminology like\nthe finder, but if you're in Windows,\n\n230\n00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:50.547\nI mean anybody that does this stuff, you\nkinda just have to translate a little bit.\n\n231\n00:10:50.547 --> 00:10:54.827\n&gt;&gt; If you're a regular PC user, you'll\nknow exactly what it is in PC world.\n\n232\n00:10:54.827 --> 00:10:58.700\nAll my files are Mac, that's the only\nreason while we're using the Mac.\n\n233\n00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.187\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and right here we're going\nto the preferences from the many, but\n\n234\n00:11:02.187 --> 00:11:04.260\npreferences and Windows in the edit menu.\n\n235\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.512\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, they're in different areas.\n\n236\n00:11:06.512 --> 00:11:09.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\na lot of keywords in the length that\n\n237\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.612\nI'm going to give you in the show\nnotes it has the Windows and PC.\n\n238\n00:11:12.612 --> 00:11:16.974\nAnd so if you are on a Windows machines\nyou can still learn everything you\n\n239\n00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:17.563\nneed to.\n\n240\n00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:18.364\nYou just have to do that.\n\n241\n00:11:18.364 --> 00:11:22.617\nThat kind of translation that\nanybody that is bilingual in these\n\n242\n00:11:22.617 --> 00:11:24.359\nplatforms just has to do.\n\n243\n00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:27.164\n&gt;&gt; Again, and when you know a lot of\napplications and you know a lot of\n\n244\n00:11:27.164 --> 00:11:30.128\noperating systems, that's where\nyour language gets switched up.\n\n245\n00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:30.639\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n246\n00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:31.464\n&gt;&gt; No, that's this one.\n\n247\n00:11:31.464 --> 00:11:32.113\nWhoopsie.\n\n248\n00:11:32.113 --> 00:11:35.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there's a lot of times\nwhere I'm, yeah, the alt-drag, and\n\n249\n00:11:35.224 --> 00:11:36.948\nI'm, wait we're-\n&gt;&gt;

Awesome.\n\n14\n00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.130\n&gt;&gt; I know this is where\nwe're getting started,\n\n15\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.390\nso\n&gt;&gt; Where do we begin?\n\n16\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay that's always a great question.\n\n17\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.450\nNow the way I've formulated these lessons.\n\n18\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.400\nAnd people ask me this all the time.\n\n19\n00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.700\nWhat they'll say is so\nI'm not really an editor.\n\n20\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.740\nOkay I was an editor for a very long time.\n\n21\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.740\nAnd what they tell me is so\nmy boss came up to me the other day.\n\n22\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.420\nAnd my boss said you're\nreally good with computers.\n\n23\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.170\nAnd you have one of those\nreally cool phones.\n\n24\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.390\nYou should make us a video.\n\n25\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.760\nAnd you panicked.\n\n26\n00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.490\nI mean I would panic too if I was\ntold I was good at something.\n\n27\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.570\nAnd I was supposed to be\ngood at something else.\n\n28\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I get that a lot.\n\n29\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.460\nYou know Photoshop so\nyou know how to do video editing.\n\n30\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.213\nI'm No there are [INAUDIBLE]\nbags right there.\n\n31\n00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:29.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\nthat's exactly what happens and\n\n32\n00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.030\nI know there are certain people out there\nthat, it's like I didn't get in this to\n\n33\n00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.430\nmake video I just really like\ncomputers language but now, or\n\n34\n00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.510\nI bought this really cool phone and\nnow everybody thinks I'm a movie maker.\n\n35\n00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.570\nSo that's exactly the way I've\nstructured these lessons if you're never\n\n36\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.950\nused anything before or\n\n37\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.730\nif you've used like really simple\n&gt;&gt; Editing programs to make some\n\n38\n00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.610\nvideos for your friends, or your family,\nand now you, either wanna make better,\n\n39\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.510\nor somebody has said, hey, you need to\nmake that video, then this is the way you\n\n40\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.910\nwanna get into it, and something, like,\nAdobe Premiere Pro is great, because Adobe\n\n41\n00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.530\nlikes to listen to the people\n&gt;&gt; The user product,\n\n42\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.870\nadvance it, move it forward, but not to\nthe point where people are scared of it.\n\n43\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.275\nBut if you've never used it before,\nyou might look at it and go [SOUND].\n\n44\n00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:21.168\nSo, I'm trying to tape away\nthat eep factor by Taking\n\n45\n00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:26.520\naway some of that,\nthis is weird, I can't do this.\n\n46\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.270\nYou can do it, it's designed to do that.\n\n47\n00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I know sometimes when you\nopen an Adobe product from the beginning,\n\n48\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.550\nit's daunting.\n\n49\n00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.480\nThese boxes and there's these\nthings over on the right, and\n\n50\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.540\nthese menus, and there's a lot of\ndifferent places you can do things.\n\n51\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So just getting familiar with.\n\n52\n00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.220\nWhat I'm looking at, and\nwhere I need to begin.\n\n53\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Get that foundation,\n\n54\n00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.570\nI think then you can start getting going.\n\n55\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n56\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.650\nwhat I'm going to explore first is\nhow Adobe organizes things for you.\n\n57\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.200\nAnd then how you can make it\na little easier on yourself.\n\n58\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.180\nAnd Adobe actually kind of assists you.\n\n59\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.220\nAnd how to do that.\n\n60\n00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.040\nSo I'm gonna do is I'm gonna actually go\nto my computer here, and I see the moon.\n\n61\n00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.970\nOkay, great.\n\n62\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.920\nI see the moon, the moon sees me.\n\n63\n00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.640\nAnd in the dock, I'm using a Mac today.\n\n64\n00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.880\nNow I'm not one of these people\nthat's like you have to use a Mac,\n\n65\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.150\nyou have to use a PC.\n\n66\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.770\nAdobe works really well on both,\nand I worked on both.\n\n67\n00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.150\nBut the drive that has brought\ntoday is formatted for Mac so\n\n68\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.790\nthat's why I'm using it.\n\n69\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.240\nso I'm going to go to\nthe premier application, and and\n\n70\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.080\njust open it up out of the dock, it\ndoesn't have to be out of the dock, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.440\nAnd you get these really cool opening\nwindows, and because it's Adobe,\n\n72\n00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.910\nif you've never used a creative cloud\nbefore, creative cloud is great,\n\n73\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.150\nbut, my videoazation is below\nthe minimum so you can see it.\n\n74\n00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.930\nBut it's okay, you can see it,\nyou're going to be fine.\n\n75\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.070\nBut the thing about creative cloud\nIs it is in cloud based system,\n\n76\n00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.160\nso it updates a lot.\n\n77\n00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.510\nSo I'm telling you right now,\nit's close to August 2017 so\n\n78\n00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.650\nI'm using the July 2017 version.\n\n79\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.900\nPeople will often ask,\nwhich version do you want?\n\n80\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.260\nIt's like, yeah, because it updates all\nthe time and there are some advantage and\n\n81\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.060\ndisadvantages of that That\nwe will go over later.\n\n82\n00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.140\nSo this is a welcome screen.\n\n83\n00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.740\nAll the applications use a welcome screen\nto put you at ease as to what's going on.\n\n84\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.260\nAnd if I just take a look here it will\ntell you things that are recent that\n\n85\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.430\nyou've already done.\n\n86\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.340\nI opened this one up earlier.\n\n87\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.740\nI opened it up 31 minutes\nago before I started.\n\n88\n00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.120\nI can go to creative cloud files and\n\n89\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.350\nsyncing settings which\nwe are going into later.\n\n90\n00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.920\nOkay, I'm treating this like\nyou just got some footage,\n\n91\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.810\nyou need to make a quick video and\nget out.\n\n92\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.930\nOkay, somebody told you to make a video.\n\n93\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.570\nI'm just gonna make a video and get out,\nand I'm done and I'm never coming back.\n\n94\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.640\nWell you'll come back but\nyou know what I mean.\n\n95\n00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.050\nAnd then do I wanna open a new project, Do\nI wanna open a project I've already done\n\n96\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.700\nWe'll address team projects later, okay?\n\n97\n00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.580\nThis will be a little advance,\n\n98\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.310\nI'm just gonna use this as I'm a sole\nuser, I'm gonna make a video what do I do?\n\n99\n00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.540\nI'm gonna go ahead and open a new project.\n\n100\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.740\nI'm gonna open a new project and\n\n101\n00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.360\nthese are the menus a lot of people find\na little bit scary And I just wanna,\n\n102\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.910\nin this lesson, just demystify some\nof the menus and what they do.\n\n103\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those scratch disks,\nthose were the ones that kinda got me.\n\n104\n00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's true.\n\n105\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.758\nYou're like this isn't 1982?\n\n106\n00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:20.943\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n107\n00:05:20.943 --> 00:05:24.830\nit's still a term that we use in editing,\nokay?\n\n108\n00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.880\nSo right now, what it is,\nis they want you to name a project.\n\n109\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.110\nNow, a project is a very small file.\n\n110\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.066\nSo I'm just gonna say, it's called ITPRO.\n\n111\n00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:36.950\nTV_2017 okay, that's it,\n\n112\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:44.000\nthis location is where do I want\nthis just one fine to be located,\n\n113\n00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.740\nnow Adobe can put it in a default\nlocation if you use the little carrots or\n\n114\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.510\nthe little mines as they\nare usually called It'll say,\n\n115\n00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.770\nit can go on to this computer.\n\n116\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.410\nIt can go straight on to\nthe Macintosh hard drive.\n\n117\n00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.170\nIt can go to where I've been before.\n\n118\n00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.360\nI can browse for a particular location,\njust to save us some time right now.\n\n119\n00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.480\nJust to save us some time right now,\n\n120\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.110\nI'm gonna say I'm going to put\nthis in the general default area.\n\n121\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.710\nAnd this is probably what you're gonna use\nfirst cuz it's probably your computer.\n\n122\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.880\nAnd yeah.\n\n123\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.690\n&gt;&gt; It made that location for you like-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n124\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.630\n&gt;&gt; The documents, the Adobe,\nlike that whole kinda\n\n125\n00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.910\n&gt;&gt; Kind of file paths.\n\n126\n00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.820\nCuz you installed Premiere,\nyou're gonna have that folder.\n\n127\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.330\nMicrosoft does the same thing.\n\n128\n00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.053\n&gt;&gt; Right, Microsoft does the same thing.\n\n129\n00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:32.690\n&gt;&gt; Templates, and you're like,\nI didn't make that.\n\n130\n00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.860\nIt's like, no, it did it for you.\n\n131\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.020\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so if you're comfortable\nwith defaults, just use the defaults.\n\n132\n00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.073\nYou don't have to go,\nI've gotta do this create.\n\n133\n00:06:42.073 --> 00:06:43.583\nNo, we'll get into that later.\n\n134\n00:06:43.583 --> 00:06:46.270\nSo I'm just gonna use the default,\n&gt;&gt; What is this\n\n135\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.060\nMercury Playback Engine GPU acceleration,\nwhat is all of this?\n\n136\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.140\nI am gonna address that in another\nlesson but basically whatever pops\n\n137\n00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.780\nup, whatever pops up as default,\njust use it, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.522\nIt's based on your graphics card.\n\n139\n00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:08.550\nYeah, is based on how your computer\nis set up, what you purchase it at.\n\n140\n00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.510\nDo you have a specific video card or\nany of those types of things?\n\n141\n00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.580\nAnd I might have a different video card\nthan you do on your particular computer,\n\n142\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.650\nso you're gonna see different options.\n\n143\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.930\nDepending on your setup.\n\n144\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.760\n&gt;&gt; If you do a lot of video effects,\nif you do a lot of animation,\n\n145\n00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.290\nyou probably have what we refer\nto as a streaming video card.\n\n146\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.370\nAnd if Adobe senses\nthe streaming video card,\n\n147\n00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.540\nit's going to go straight to\nthe streaming video card.\n\n148\n00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.240\nAnd so go ahead and\nstick with the default for now.\n\n149\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.190\nThe rest of these, okay,\nwhere is this idea of,\n\n150\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.800\nI'm just gonna back a little bit here.\n\n151\n00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.520\nAnd say, alright, so\nwhat this idea of display formats?\n\n152\n00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.430\nTime code is good.\n\n153\n00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.440\nAudio samples for\nnow are good instead of milliseconds.\n\n154\n00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.927\nCapture format.\n\n155\n00:07:52.927 --> 00:07:55.353\nUnless you are bringing\nsomething in from a tape,\n\n156\n00:07:55.353 --> 00:07:57.156\nyou don't have to worry about this.\n\n157\n00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:59.526\nThe other good thing-\n&gt;&gt; It's like a physical tape-\n\n158\n00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:00.704\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Like a physical tape,\n\n159\n00:08:00.704 --> 00:08:02.214\nwe got some-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Old school tape.\n\n160\n00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:05.747\n&gt;&gt; You got some old VHS, you got some\nDVPro, you got all of that, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:05.747 --> 00:08:07.309\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're going way far back, all right?\n\n162\n00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:09.910\nSomebody brought you a bunch of tapes,\nall right?\n\n163\n00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.823\nEven better,\nsomebody in your office said, hey,\n\n164\n00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:13.782\nwe got all these tapes from 20 years ago,\ncan you?\n\n165\n00:08:13.782 --> 00:08:16.139\nYeah, that's, oy.\n\n166\n00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:18.390\nSo for now, you can leave it at DV,\n\n167\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.433\nbecause the advantage of an Adobe\nsystem is you would be able to\n\n168\n00:08:22.433 --> 00:08:27.136\ngo back in when you're inside\nthe application and change thes, okay?\n\n169\n00:08:27.136 --> 00:08:30.144\nSo this isn't like,\nI did it now, it's over.\n\n170\n00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:32.982\nI gotta go back and\ndo a new thing, nope, okay?\n\n171\n00:08:32.982 --> 00:08:37.684\nScratch Disks, yeah, so\nscratch disks are a very old term for\n\n172\n00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:43.299\nwhen you were writing information on\na disk, it made a scratching sound.\n\n173\n00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:44.067\nOkay, remember?\n\n174\n00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:45.103\n&gt;&gt; Like the arm going back and forth?\n\n175\n00:08:45.103 --> 00:08:48.014\n&gt;&gt; The old floppy disks when you would\ndo something and it'd go [SOUND].\n\n176\n00:08:48.014 --> 00:08:48.867\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n177\n00:08:48.867 --> 00:08:50.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's what it means.\n\n178\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.030\nAnd when editors first start using this,\nand we had to transfer things off of\n\n179\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:00.830\neither a canister of film or\na tape, man, did it make sounds.\n\n180\n00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.420\nSo in the case of scratch disks,\nyou don't really have to\n\n181\n00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.760\nworry about it unless you're capturing\nfrom tape or using a film train.\n\n182\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.740\nYou don't need to worry about this and\nyou can use a default location.\n\n183\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.969\nNow, my default locations are set up for\na previous area, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:20.969 --> 00:09:26.015\nI opened up a project and\nit went, it was there before.\n\n185\n00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:30.278\nI could also just say Same as Project,\nthat way if you're just like,\n\n186\n00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:33.740\nI just want everything\nwhere my project is.\n\n187\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.490\nI tend to put things on multiple drives.\n\n188\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.310\nAnd now you can just say,\nI'm just getting started.\n\n189\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.760\nFine, if you're just getting started,\nput it in Same as Project.\n\n190\n00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.720\nSame thing with Captured Audio.\n\n191\n00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.460\nNow believe it or not,\n\n192\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.540\nthere is one thing within the actual\nsystem where you will do this.\n\n193\n00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.630\nAnd that's if you record a voiceover.\n\n194\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.580\nIf you record a voiceover\ninto your computer,\n\n195\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.980\nthat's coming from a separate source, me.\n\n196\n00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.830\nSo you would need to know\nwhere that captured audio is.\n\n197\n00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.380\nPreviews, those are things like\nwhen we have to create a render,\n\n198\n00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.860\nyou add effects, okay,\nor you add a transition.\n\n199\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.340\nYou have to create a file\nto make that work, and\n\n200\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.630\nthose files will go in this area.\n\n201\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:22.845\nProject Auto Save, now I can't remember\nif other applications in Adobe have this.\n\n202\n00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:27.369\nBut we have a thing called\nProject Auto Save, where I can say,\n\n203\n00:10:27.369 --> 00:10:33.464\nwithin the application, after every so\nmany minutes, it will save a copy, okay?\n\n204\n00:10:33.464 --> 00:10:35.458\nIt will save a copy.\n\n205\n00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:36.430\nWhy?\n\n206\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.460\nMaybe your project file explodes,\n\n207\n00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.401\nsomething happens to it,\nit gets corrupted.\n\n208\n00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:48.301\nOr, and this has happened to me as\nan editor when somebody will say, hey,\n\n209\n00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:52.819\nremember that thing you did two weeks ago,\ncan I take a look at that?\n\n210\n00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:57.491\nAnd you go, maybe.\n\n211\n00:10:57.491 --> 00:11:01.800\nIf you have as an Auto Save,\nyou can open it up from two weeks ago.\n\n212\n00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.850\nI just go to the Auto Save and\nuse that, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.630\nNow I generally don't put this\nin the same place as my project.\n\n214\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.402\nTo me, that's like putting matches next\nto the gasoline, both will explode.\n\n215\n00:11:12.402 --> 00:11:15.570\nBut for today,\nwe're gonna do Same as Project.\n\n216\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.913\nNow, toward the end of\nthe advanced lessons,\n\n217\n00:11:17.913 --> 00:11:22.070\nwe're gonna talk about these CC Libraries\nand Motion Graphics Templates.\n\n218\n00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.900\nFor now, just Same as Project.\n\n219\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.090\nIf everything's in the same place,\nyou'll probably be a lot happier.\n\n220\n00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.719\nThe last one, Ingest Settings.\n\n221\n00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:36.709\nI know this one looks,\npeople are like, [SOUND].\n\n222\n00:11:36.709 --> 00:11:37.967\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds a little scary.\n\n223\n00:11:37.967 --> 00:11:39.320\n&gt;&gt; It's not as hard as it seems.\n\n224\n00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.950\nI know, it's not as hard as it seems.\n\n225\n00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.310\nAgain, a lot of this is\nbased on editor language.\n\n226\n00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.300\nAnd we have a funny language,\nwe don't like people talking to us, so\n\n227\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.910\nwe have our own language.\n\n228\n00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.770\n[LAUGH] And so it's like,\nIngest, I'm scared now.\n\n229\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.810\nSo if it's not on,\nyou don't have to worry about it,\n\n230\n00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.430\nand I'm gonna explain that in a moment.\n\n231\n00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:06.960\nIf it is on, okay, let's say for example\nyou shot a bunch of stuff on a camera and\n\n232\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.000\nyou have a camera card, and\nyou just put the camera card in.\n\n233\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.120\nIf you want it to go\nonto your hard drive or\n\n234\n00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.070\nonto a specific place, it's better\nto use Ingest than a drag and drop.\n\n235\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:26.390\nAnd I can say a Copy, a Transcode,\nwhich we'll talk about, or\n\n236\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.360\nCreate Proxies, Copy and Create Proxies.\n\n237\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.880\nFor now, I'm going to turn this off.\n\n238\n00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.120\nAgain, this is another than I can turn\nof and on once I'm into the system.\n\n239\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.062\nSo for now, it is off, okay?\n\n240\n00:12:40.062 --> 00:12:43.230\n&gt;&gt; So the word ingest it's like, I feel\nlike you're ingesting poison or something.\n\n241\n00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.844\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That connotation, but you're talking\n\n242\n00:12:45.844 --> 00:12:50.249\nabout that whole idea of the program is\ningesting something from somewhere else.\n\n243\n00:12:50.249 --> 00:12:51.678\nIt's bringing it into\nits mouth type thing.\n\n244\n00:12:51.678 --> 00:12:52.652\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n245\n00:12:52.652 --> 00:12:54.380\nyou have to think of capture as this.\n\n246\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.640\nCapture comes off of a medium\nthat's like a tape, okay?\n\n247\n00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.170\nIt was on a tape,\nit was on a piece of film.\n\n248\n00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.050\nIf you shoot to a camera card, or\n\n249\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.120\nif you have stuff on a hard drive,\nit's already in the format.\n\n250\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.910\nIt's like a Quicktime or\nan MPEG or something like that.\n\n251\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.620\nAll you need to do ingest that.\n\n252\n00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.470\nIf it's from another source,\nyou have to capture it.\n\n253\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so just that lingo, right?\n\n254\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.933\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n255\n00:13:15.933 --> 00:13:18.706\n&gt;&gt; Capture, ingest, copy, paste,\nbring in all that kinda stuff.\n\n256\n00:13:18.706 --> 00:13:20.082\n&gt;&gt; Right, bring in all of that.\n\n257\n00:13:20.082 --> 00:13:21.831\nIt's crazy nuts, so yeah.\n\n258\n00:13:21.831 --> 00:13:23.690\nAll right, so I'll just click OK.\n\n259\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.270\nAnd all right, so here's the interface.\n\n260\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.230\nAs we call it, the big Chunky bar, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.969\nIt's all together, so if I just grab\nthe top here and move it all around,\n\n262\n00:13:35.969 --> 00:13:37.535\nit all moves together.\n\n263\n00:13:37.535 --> 00:13:39.967\n&gt;&gt; These are not separate,\nlike floating workspaces-\n\n264\n00:13:39.967 --> 00:13:40.991\n&gt;&gt; Not separate at all.\n\n265\n00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:41.961\n&gt;&gt; Or panels like they had before?\n\n266\n00:13:41.961 --> 00:13:44.404\n&gt;&gt; Panels, you can set it up that way.\n\n267\n00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:45.764\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But for right now,\n\n268\n00:13:45.764 --> 00:13:48.040\nit's just a big Chunky bar, okay?\n\n269\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.170\nIf you have a two-screen system, yes,\nI can separate out one of these and\n\n270\n00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.314\nsend it somewhere else, okay,\nand then save that out.\n\n271\n00:13:55.314 --> 00:13:58.356\n&gt;&gt; So just like a lot of the other Adobe\nproducts, you can break it apart and\n\n272\n00:13:58.356 --> 00:13:59.837\nput all your panels on one screen.\n\n273\n00:13:59.837 --> 00:14:01.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n274\n00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.420\n&gt;&gt; And just your workspace and\nthe main document area in another.\n\n275\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.480\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that's the best part\nis that if you get used to one\n\n276\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.520\nAdobe application, you can generally\napply a lot of that to another.\n\n277\n00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.084\nSo if you're familiar with Photoshop or\nAfter Effects and all that,\n\n278\n00:14:17.084 --> 00:14:19.672\nit sort of takes some of the fear away,\nall right?\n\n279\n00:14:19.672 --> 00:14:21.667\nWhich is good, I like that part.\n\n280\n00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:23.866\n&gt;&gt; And if you're just starting out,\nthen it's all in one place.\n\n281\n00:14:23.866 --> 00:14:25.572\nYou don't have to worry like,\nwhy is this coming with the other thing?\n\n282\n00:14:25.572 --> 00:14:26.640\n&gt;&gt; Why is this happening?\n\n283\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.149\nWhy is this happening?\n\n284\n00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:28.868\nMy goodness.\n\n285\n00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.808\nSo for right now,\nbefore I start organizing everything,\n\n286\n00:14:31.808 --> 00:14:34.208\nI just wanna just go around the windows,\nokay?\n\n287\n00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.630\nAs we say, going around the clock face.\n\n288\n00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:43.870\nSo I start here and everything is very\nwell labeled, so this is the project.\n\n289\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.080\nThis is where we hold all of\nour master clips, titles,\n\n290\n00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.150\nsometimes we save effects in here,\nsequences of shots, okay?\n\n291\n00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.039\nEverything gets stuck here and catalogued.\n\n292\n00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.922\nWhen we want to move it forward and\ntake a look at a specific\n\n293\n00:15:00.922 --> 00:15:05.109\npiece of media,\nthat ends up as a source, okay?\n\n294\n00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:09.251\nWe would take a look at master clips or\ntitles or\n\n295\n00:15:09.251 --> 00:15:15.955\nmany different things to manipulate how\nwe want to put it into the program.\n\n296\n00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:19.620\nSo you just think of it as, program as,\nyou're watching a program right now.\n\n297\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.150\nThis is what the audience is going to see.\n\n298\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.670\nWhen you put it together, this is\nhow the audience is going to see it.\n\n299\n00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.079\nBelow it is the timeline.\n\n300\n00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:29.903\nThese two work in tandem.\n\n301\n00:15:29.903 --> 00:15:33.840\nThe program and\nthe timeline work in tandem.\n\n302\n00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.420\nSo what you're editing is\nwhat the audience sees.\n\n303\n00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.212\nSo this is gonna look like Legos.\n\n304\n00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:43.464\nThis one's gonna look like TV,\nmovie, whatever.\n\n305\n00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:46.885\nThe other interesting thing\nis if you look at the top,\n\n306\n00:15:46.885 --> 00:15:51.840\nit always tells you what project you're\nworking in and where it's located.\n\n307\n00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.142\nAnd that's usually a big help So\nyou can look at that very quickly.\n\n308\n00:15:57.142 --> 00:15:58.628\nSo just on a basic level and\n\n309\n00:15:58.628 --> 00:16:02.700\nthen in the next lesson we'll get\ninto a little bit more of it.\n\n310\n00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.030\nHow do I actually get media into this?\n\n311\n00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.678\nMost people wanna do a dragon drop or\nmost people wanna do an import.\n\n312\n00:16:13.187 --> 00:16:17.700\nEvery system now, especially Adobe,\nhas a thing called a media browser.\n\n313\n00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.660\nNow not everybody has to use\nhotkeys by the way, all right?\n\n314\n00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.483\nBut a great simple step to\nmake anything full-screen,\n\n315\n00:16:26.483 --> 00:16:28.610\nI'm gonna move my mouse over it.\n\n316\n00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:34.175\nAnd then right bellow escape there\nis the tilde, I think accent grave.\n\n317\n00:16:34.175 --> 00:16:35.770\nOkay, I love to say accent grave.\n\n318\n00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.637\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then If I with the mouse over this\n\n319\n00:16:39.637 --> 00:16:43.747\nclick it, it goes to full screen, okay?\n\n320\n00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:47.971\nAnd what you will notice\nis this is somewhat of\n\n321\n00:16:47.971 --> 00:16:53.204\na representation of something\nlike the finder, okay?\n\n322\n00:16:53.204 --> 00:16:58.642\nAnd I'm gonna click this and\nI can look inside my drive.\n\n323\n00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:02.350\nAnd I can find every piece\nof media that I need.\n\n324\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.614\nNow why do I do this?\n\n325\n00:17:06.614 --> 00:17:09.779\nI know,\nmany of you are probably just saying,\n\n326\n00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:13.010\nwhy can't I just go into the finder.\n\n327\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.850\nWell, let me just come in here and\nI brought some media, okay?\n\n328\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:19.296\nMice and I don't get along.\n\n329\n00:17:19.296 --> 00:17:21.030\nOkay, all right.\n\n330\n00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:25.136\nSo, I've made a folder called lessons and\nI've got media in it.\n\n331\n00:17:25.136 --> 00:17:29.554\nNow, I wanted to note that I\nhave different types of cameras.\n\n332\n00:17:29.554 --> 00:17:32.280\nI have different types of cameras.\n\n333\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:39.607\nSo I'm gonna go to the AF_100 and\nlook inside the private folder.\n\n334\n00:17:39.607 --> 00:17:42.910\nThe Adobe Premier Codec is not installed.\n\n335\n00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.430\nOkay, that's fine.\n\n336\n00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.400\nI don't need it.\n\n337\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.250\nBut here's the media that I shot.\n\n338\n00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.500\nOkay, that is a watermelon.\n\n339\n00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] was that a bowling ball?\n\n340\n00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nI am about to slice open a bowling ball.\n\n341\n00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.001\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's gonna be a really strong knife.\n\n342\n00:17:56.001 --> 00:17:58.424\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what we're doing.\n\n343\n00:17:58.424 --> 00:17:59.740\nIt's gensu time.\n\n344\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.820\nNo, you'll be exploring a lot\nof my garden in this lessons.\n\n345\n00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.020\nActually, my wife's garden.\n\n346\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.680\nAll right, she would kill me\nif she heard me saying that.\n\n347\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.710\nBut, that's how I see it\nin the media browser.\n\n348\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.454\nIf I go to my drive, okay, and\nI go to the exact same area,\n\n349\n00:18:19.454 --> 00:18:24.135\nLessons, Media, AF 100, Private,\n\n350\n00:18:24.135 --> 00:18:28.308\npeople are like, what's going on?\n\n351\n00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.850\nIt looks weird.\n\n352\n00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.370\nYeah, you get this weird sort of-\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't even show up.\n\n353\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.090\n&gt;&gt; No, in this case, it doesn't show up.\n\n354\n00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.560\nAnd in many cases, it might not, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.437\nYou might not be able\nto see what is inside.\n\n356\n00:18:45.437 --> 00:18:49.504\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like a translation, like\nthe file is in a specific language that\n\n357\n00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:53.822\nyour finder doesn't really, it's like I\ncan't even tell you what you this, but\n\n358\n00:18:53.822 --> 00:18:57.270\nsince you're in Premier,\nit deals with that type of media.\n\n359\n00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.225\n&gt;&gt; It lets you do that.\n\n360\n00:18:58.225 --> 00:18:58.753\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:18:58.753 --> 00:19:02.764\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And\nthat is a huge advantage, okay?\n\n362\n00:19:02.764 --> 00:19:04.810\nThat is a huge advantage.\n\n363\n00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.260\nSo you wanna really stay\nwithin the application.\n\n364\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.790\nNow, in the next lesson,\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm going to show you\n\n365\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.183\nhow to get everything in, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:17.183 --> 00:19:22.340\nAnd then how you might want to work\nwith different types of media and\n\n367\n00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.370\norganize it, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.710\nSo for now, if you have any media,\nor I've actually brought along some\n\n369\n00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.290\nmedia that everybody can use for\nthis that will have the different types.\n\n370\n00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.190\nOkay, the Panasonic I used,\n\n371\n00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.350\nthe phone, even the thing called\nthe Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera.\n\n372\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.800\nOkay, you'll be able to play around with\nthat and get the idea of why you wanna use\n\n373\n00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:49.125\nthe media browser over just\ndoing a standard import, okay?\n\n374\n00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:50.355\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's fantastic.\n\n375\n00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:53.105\nI've already learned\na lot about this product,\n\n376\n00:19:53.105 --> 00:19:56.602\nbecause I come from a Photoshop\nbackground and Illustrator.\n\n377\n00:19:56.602 --> 00:19:59.077\nSo I'm familiar with the Adobe products,\nbut\n\n378\n00:19:59.077 --> 00:20:01.621\nit is very different when\nyou get into Premier.\n\n379\n00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:06.187\nAnd it's like talking about JPEGs and\nwhat is the difference between a tiff and\n\n380\n00:20:06.187 --> 00:20:07.777\na ping and all that.\n\n381\n00:20:07.777 --> 00:20:09.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You kinda get that knowledge that's\n\n382\n00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.802\nbased on different file formats and\nwhat it can and cannot support.\n\n383\n00:20:12.802 --> 00:20:14.142\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so that's the same of what we're\n\n384\n00:20:14.142 --> 00:20:15.082\ngonna be doing in video.\n\n385\n00:20:15.082 --> 00:20:15.662\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n386\n00:20:15.662 --> 00:20:19.300\nAnd the video is far more\ntravelling because it's moving.\n\n387\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.430\nAnd there are so\nmany different cameras out there now.\n\n388\n00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:25.229\nLike I said, I've got a Blackmagic\nPocket Cinema Camera which is great, but\n\n389\n00:20:25.229 --> 00:20:26.710\nit shoots huge files.\n\n390\n00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.976\nAnd I've got my phone.\n\n391\n00:20:28.976 --> 00:20:31.700\nI've been shooting so\nmuch on my phone lately, it's crazy.\n\n392\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.510\nAnd I never thought,\nafter almost 25 years of doing this,\n\n393\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.240\nI'll be shooting stuff on my phone.\n\n394\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n395\n00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.320\n&gt;&gt; But it can be fun.\n\n396\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.820\nOkay, it can be fun.\n\n397\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.210\nSo, like I said, next lesson we're\ngonna get some media in there and\n\n398\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.091\norganize it out.\n\n399\n00:20:44.091 --> 00:20:45.070\n&gt;&gt; Well that sounds great Jim.\n\n400\n00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.522\nI'm really looking forward\nto our next episode, but for\n\n401\n00:20:47.522 --> 00:20:50.100\nthis episode we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap it up.\n\n402\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.430\nFor CreativePro TV, we're signing off.\n\n403\n00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.960\nMy name is Vaughn Smith.\n\n404\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.760\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, so I'm assuming we're\ngoing to be organizing a project.\n\n16\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n17\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.730\nFirst, I'm gonna show you\nhow to get this media in,\n\n18\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.120\nbecause various different types of things.\n\n19\n00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.450\nAnd then,\nhow to organize out your project.\n\n20\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.720\nThere's many different ways to do it.\n\n21\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.830\nAnd that's the cool part, is if you're not\ncomfortable with one, you can use another.\n\n22\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.630\nAnd then maybe when you do\nsomething more advanced,\n\n23\n00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.050\nyou can move on to something else.\n\n24\n00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.090\nBecause the whole idea of this is just you\nwanna get in, you wanna make a video and\n\n25\n00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.510\nyou wanna have fun.\n\n26\n00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.600\nWhen you wanna do something\na little more experimental,\n\n27\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.650\na little crazier later, we'll explore\nthat in later episodes, okay.\n\n28\n00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.440\nSo going back to my Macintosh right now.\n\n29\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.440\nWhat I've done is I went ahead and\nI moved all of the media onto the desktop,\n\n30\n00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.010\nbecause the drive was a little slow and\nI needed some speed.\n\n31\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.570\nSo I just wanna show you AF_100,\ndidn't show this last time private.\n\n32\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.310\nRemember when I went to that last time?\n\n33\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.423\n&gt;&gt; There is four clips or\npieces of footage.\n\n34\n00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:33.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nin the media browser there is.\n\n35\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.850\nIf I go out saying hey,\nI'm just gonna drag and drop my media,\n\n36\n00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.960\nthat's what I get off of this\nparticular camera, is this weird file.\n\n37\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.126\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's because of that particular camera.\n\n38\n00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:47.560\n&gt;&gt; That particular camera.\n\n39\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Coming in and looking into file\nbrowser that's what you're gonna see.\n\n40\n00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.001\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and then I'd have to\nshow it's package contents, and\n\n41\n00:01:55.001 --> 00:02:00.841\nthen show this one's package contents,\nand then this stream and then all this.\n\n42\n00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.849\nAnd notice there are some metadata\nthat's associated with the media,\n\n43\n00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:04.997\n&gt;&gt; That's the XMP file.\n\n44\n00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:07.159\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nXMP files are associated with that.\n\n45\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.488\nAnd you're like do I drag those,\ndo I not drag those, what do I do?\n\n46\n00:02:12.488 --> 00:02:19.420\nThe media browser saves you that time,\nand saves you that frustration, okay.\n\n47\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.470\nSo, once again I'm gonna go back to that,\nand\n\n48\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.870\nthis case, let me zoom in a little bit.\n\n49\n00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.570\nI'm on the Macintosh hard drive,\nI'm gonna go into users.\n\n50\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.805\nAnd this of course, going down the tree,\n\n51\n00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:34.140\nit's great if you know\nwhere everything is.\n\n52\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.120\nBut going back to this time and\ntime again, Adobe makes it so\n\n53\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.840\nyou don't have to do that.\n\n54\n00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.800\nSo I can take this lessons folder,\nCtrl or right-click it and\n\n55\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.790\nsay Add this to Favorites.\n\n56\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.021\nAnd you'll notice there's a thing\nup here called Favorites.\n\n57\n00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.310\nGo there, boom, and there it is.\n\n58\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.872\nNow a key will pop up in my Favorites\nwhen I need to go back and use it.\n\n59\n00:02:54.872 --> 00:02:58.299\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do this all the time,\nwhether it's just even in Word or\n\n60\n00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.330\nwe're doing it in Photoshop.\n\n61\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.232\nJust in the Files Browser alone,\nI'll just drag it up there.\n\n62\n00:03:03.232 --> 00:03:06.190\nThen when I'm not using it then I pull\nthat folder off so I can just make-\n\n63\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.420\n&gt;&gt; Whatever can save you some time and\n\n64\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.370\nfrustration, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.690\nBecause a lot of people they're like,\nI don't wanna be a professional editor,\n\n66\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.720\nI just wanna put some videos together for\nmy website, and\n\n67\n00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.090\nuse Adobe because I have other things in\nthe application, now I need to do this.\n\n68\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.960\nOr somebody asked you to make a video,\nor you wanna do family stuff,\n\n69\n00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.830\nor punch up something for\nyour corporation, whatever.\n\n70\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.850\nIt makes it very simple to do that, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.751\nSo now, under LESSONS, there's AF_100.\n\n72\n00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.258\nThis is what the footage looks like now,\nokay, going back to what we did before,\n\n73\n00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:40.140\nthat's what it looks like.\n\n74\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.280\nNow, zoom out a little bit,\n\n75\n00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.662\nI'm gonna go to the bottom,\nI've got two ways to look at this.\n\n76\n00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:48.129\nI could look at as a list view, as just\na list of stuff, some people like this.\n\n77\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.860\nOr I can look at it as icons.\n\n78\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.950\nIf I take this little guy\nright here I can zoom in.\n\n79\n00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.780\nAnd then if I do a thing\ncalled a hover scrub,\n\n80\n00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.130\nwhere basically I can just kind\nof hover my mouse over it, or\n\n81\n00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.400\nI can take this little bar, and do that\nand go through it and see the footage.\n\n82\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.370\nI can even hit the Space bar and\nplay it, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.650\nThere I am.\n\n84\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.840\nCutting open a watermelon.\n\n85\n00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.450\nI'm gonna save that as a surprise.\n\n86\n00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.360\nBut here's me picking a watermelon,\nall of this, okay, it's great.\n\n87\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.060\nSo now what do I do?\n\n88\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.836\nWhat I wanna do is I wanna\nget this into my project, and\n\n89\n00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:23.457\nI've decided I want all of it.\n\n90\n00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:27.245\nLet us highlight them.\n\n91\n00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:29.250\nAnd this is one of those things\nwhere I can just click and drag.\n\n92\n00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.470\n&gt;&gt; Can you do Ctrl+A or Cmd+A?\n\n93\n00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.370\n&gt;&gt; You can do a Cmd+A.\n\n94\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.852\nYeah you can do a Cmd+A or\nCtrl+A in PC, right, whatever.\n\n95\n00:04:34.852 --> 00:04:37.120\nIf you're a PC user you know\nwhat your commands are.\n\n96\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.052\nIf you're a Mac user you\nknow what your commands are.\n\n97\n00:04:40.052 --> 00:04:46.410\nAnd then I just take one of them\nCtrl+click or right-click and say, import.\n\n98\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.660\nBoom.\n\n99\n00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.140\nAnd there they are inside the project,\nokay?\n\n100\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.767\nInside the project window.\n\n101\n00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:54.410\nAll right, its just showing me,\nyup there they are.\n\n102\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.730\n&gt;&gt; And this is, we're in fullscreen right\nnow so we can see everything in there, so.\n\n103\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.400\n&gt;&gt; So what it did was it just\npopped over in fullscreen to say,\n\n104\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.650\nthey're in there by the way.\n\n105\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.370\nIt's like, okay, great.\n\n106\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.660\nNow, that's just what we call a link.\n\n107\n00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.580\nNone of the actual media has moved.\n\n108\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.332\nIt's still in the same place.\n\n109\n00:05:13.332 --> 00:05:16.530\n&gt;&gt; So it's not living in our project,\nper se.\n\n110\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.365\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's not living in the project.\n&gt;&gt; It's just saying connect out to that\n\n111\n00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:22.610\nsource where you're\ntelling it on my computer.\n\n112\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.138\n&gt;&gt; But here is the other thing.\n\n113\n00:05:24.138 --> 00:05:26.340\nIf I'd had done that from the camera card,\nokay,\n\n114\n00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.430\nif I pulled it out something like a canon\nor something like that, put the card in or\n\n115\n00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.210\nput it into an adapter and\ndone that, it's still on the card.\n\n116\n00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.330\n&gt;&gt; So if I pull the card out, all of\na sudden, all the media is unlinked.\n\n117\n00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.290\nSo right now, it's just pointing to it,\nit says, it's over there.\n\n118\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.520\nNow, what if I wanted to actually move it,\nor in this case, copy it.\n\n119\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.410\nSo I'm gonna do that with\nanother type of media, okay?\n\n120\n00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.360\nJust I hit the mouse there, sorry, okay?\n\n121\n00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.000\nSo LESSONS, I've got this thing.\n\n122\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.830\nLet's see, under the Garden, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.890\nUnder Seymour.\n\n124\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.400\nHere's Seymour.\n\n125\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.620\nNow Seymour is a cat, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.360\nSeymour is not my cat.\n\n127\n00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.991\nSeymour is the neighbor's cat.\n\n128\n00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:15.550\nHe is the neighbor's cat but\nhe now thinks he's my cat.\n\n129\n00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.910\nThis was taken on what's called\na black magic pocket cinema camera.\n\n130\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.200\nThese files are short in terms of time,\nbut\n\n131\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.338\neach of these files is about\na gigabyte to two gigabytes.\n\n132\n00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:31.578\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; They're huge files.\n\n133\n00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:32.452\n&gt;&gt; That's big.\n[LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:06:32.452 --> 00:06:34.729\n&gt;&gt; Right, because they're getting full\n\n135\n00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:39.086\nframe information, full color information,\nfull motion information.\n\n136\n00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:41.326\nAnd this is at 1080.\n\n137\n00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:44.040\nSo what do I do about this?\n\n138\n00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.630\nFirst of all, notice.\n\n139\n00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:48.690\n&gt;&gt; There's that ingest.\n\n140\n00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.690\n&gt;&gt; I have that ingest option\nthat was at the very beginning.\n\n141\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.720\nSo I have this ingest option.\n\n142\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.270\nSo if this was still on the card,\nI could say I'm gonna go to ingest and\n\n143\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.670\nthen any time you see a wrench,\n\n144\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:06.110\nthis means you get to open some settings\nassociated with a certain panel, okay.\n\n145\n00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.639\nSo if I click it, we all remember this.\n\n146\n00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.535\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n147\n00:07:09.535 --> 00:07:11.487\n&gt;&gt; And it immediately defaults to copy.\n\n148\n00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:17.977\nAnd it can say, I can copy it and you can\ndo what's called an MD5 Verification,\n\n149\n00:07:17.977 --> 00:07:21.757\nwhich this is a form of verification\nif something is wrong, or\n\n150\n00:07:21.757 --> 00:07:26.359\nit doesn't come over correctly,\nit will give you a verification, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:31.154\nNow, I'm just gonna say without, and\nI could say it can go the same as\n\n152\n00:07:31.154 --> 00:07:36.052\nthe project, use a different destination,\ndo it as Creative Cloud.\n\n153\n00:07:36.052 --> 00:07:39.244\nOkay, you could move it to your\nCreative Cloud account which we're\n\n154\n00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:41.942\ngonna talk about later, or\nchoose a specific location.\n\n155\n00:07:41.942 --> 00:07:45.367\nNow, I'm gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Is there a benefit to doing\n\n156\n00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:47.488\nthe verification whether\ndo you want it to check or-\n\n157\n00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:49.720\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you may want it to check\n\n158\n00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.517\ndepending upon, you might look at it\nin your camera and it looks great.\n\n159\n00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:58.649\nAnd then it comes over and\nsomething happened.\n\n160\n00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:02.628\nMaybe it got moved to a corrupted drive,\nsomething like that.\n\n161\n00:08:02.628 --> 00:08:07.180\nAnd this verification will verify,\nfile looks good, file looks clean.\n\n162\n00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.493\nThere are certain things\nwe can see in files, but\n\n163\n00:08:09.493 --> 00:08:12.460\nthere's certain things that\nonly the system can see.\n\n164\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.156\nSo you're asking the system\nto take a look at that.\n\n165\n00:08:14.156 --> 00:08:18.637\n&gt;&gt; So it's making sure it didn't miss\na little part of it [CROSSTALK].\n\n166\n00:08:18.637 --> 00:08:21.420\n&gt;&gt; It didn't miss metadata,\nit didn't miss anything like that.\n\n167\n00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.440\n&gt;&gt; Now what I'm gonna do is something\nthat Adobe offers, that's pretty great.\n\n168\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.820\nThis is a nice computer, but\nrunning one gigabyte files, cuz\n\n169\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.100\nif I had shot more than 30 seconds, we're\ngoing into the like five, ten territory.\n\n170\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.940\nI'm gonna ask it to create a proxy,\nand what it's gonna do is,\n\n171\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.540\nit's going to create a smaller file that\nI can switch back and forth between.\n\n172\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.930\nSo I could have the big\nfiles on a large drive, and\n\n173\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.150\nthe proxies on a different drive.\n\n174\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.160\nSo that's what I'm gonna do with this, I'm\ngonna say, this is gonna create proxies.\n\n175\n00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.730\nSince I already have it on the hard drive,\nif it didn't have it on the hard drive and\n\n176\n00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.240\nhad it on the card,\nI could say, copy it over.\n\n177\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.940\nIn this case I'm gonna create some\nproxies, and a lot of people ask me about,\n\n178\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.772\nwhat are these proxy workflows?\n\n179\n00:09:13.772 --> 00:09:18.160\nCuz a lot of people buy big cameras,\nand they have big files, so\n\n180\n00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.970\nI'll click OK, and now the ingest is on.\n\n181\n00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.800\nI'm gonna take these two and\nCtrl+click, and say Import.\n\n182\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.010\nIt's gonna import the files, and you're\ngonna say, well hey, they're right there.\n\n183\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.970\nThat's true, it's going to open\na thing called Media Encoder.\n\n184\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.062\nAnd it's gonna create the proxies\nin the background, so\n\n185\n00:09:42.062 --> 00:09:45.741\nright now I can technically\nwork with these files.\n\n186\n00:09:45.741 --> 00:09:47.476\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's encoding the whole thing\nto make it that smaller proxy file.\n\n187\n00:09:47.476 --> 00:09:50.047\n&gt;&gt; It's encoding.\n\n188\n00:09:50.047 --> 00:09:51.423\n&gt;&gt; For us to be able to work off of.\n\n189\n00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:53.326\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Instead of going directly to the source\n\n190\n00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:54.644\nwith that massive file size.\n\n191\n00:09:54.644 --> 00:09:58.715\n&gt;&gt; And I get a new physical copy, so\nnow I'm just gonna go back here and\n\n192\n00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:02.810\nI'm gonna say, the Galaxy Note 4,\nhere's Seymour's Garden.\n\n193\n00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.320\nWe're gonna explore a little of\nSeymour's Garden, because you'll say,\n\n194\n00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.420\nwhere's Seymour?\n\n195\n00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.400\nWell, Seymour ends up as a puppet\nin the rest of it, I have problems.\n\n196\n00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.242\nAnd I'm gonna do what\nyou suggested last time,\n\n197\n00:10:15.242 --> 00:10:18.240\nI'll do the Cmd+A, Ctrl+click, and Import.\n\n198\n00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.360\nAnd these are just gonna just\ncome right over, and I'll say,\n\n199\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.560\nwait, I'm gonna cancel that,\nand you know why?\n\n200\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.700\nCuz I don't wanna ingest them.\n\n201\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.002\n&gt;&gt; I was about to say, I'm like,\nare we doing the same ingest settings?\n\n202\n00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.442\nI was gonna ask you about that.\n\n203\n00:10:29.442 --> 00:10:33.360\n&gt;&gt; So check all of that, and I'm like,\nno, I don't need to do that with these.\n\n204\n00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.570\nThese are really small files, and these\nare gonna run really well on my computer.\n\n205\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:41.300\nSo I'm just gonna take off ingest, and\nlike I said, I can turn it off and on.\n\n206\n00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.534\nI've got my settings there,\nI'm just gonna go Ctrl+click, Import.\n\n207\n00:10:45.534 --> 00:10:47.790\n&gt;&gt; Cuz like you said,\nthese are much smaller files,\n\n208\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.860\nso we don't need to worry about\nthe encoding and doing the proxy.\n\n209\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:57.674\nBecause this isn't gonna slow down our\nperformance of this particular project.\n\n210\n00:10:57.674 --> 00:11:01.354\n&gt;&gt; Not only that, but because they're\nalready where I want them to be,\n\n211\n00:11:01.354 --> 00:11:03.222\nI don't need to do an ingest copy.\n\n212\n00:11:03.222 --> 00:11:06.915\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,\nthey're they're on your computer, and\n\n213\n00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:09.912\nthe ingest was the whole\nidea about the card.\n\n214\n00:11:09.912 --> 00:11:11.841\nWe needed to kind of bring it over,\n\n215\n00:11:11.841 --> 00:11:16.173\ncopying it from the card to a physical\nlocation, not on that external media.\n\n216\n00:11:16.173 --> 00:11:18.819\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n217\n00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:20.184\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; That's the issue,\n\n218\n00:11:20.184 --> 00:11:23.128\nit's like if you're doing a copy,\nthis is still in the card.\n\n219\n00:11:23.128 --> 00:11:25.680\nI don't wanna drag and\ndrop it off the card, what do I do?\n\n220\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.800\nYou do ingest, and you would say,\n\n221\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.450\njust copy it and\ntell it where you want it to go.\n\n222\n00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:38.751\nSame as the project, or choose a different\ndestination, I chose to create proxies.\n\n223\n00:11:38.751 --> 00:11:41.294\nNot only that, I could copy and\ncreate proxies.\n\n224\n00:11:41.294 --> 00:11:42.539\n&gt;&gt; Do it all in one fell swoop.\n\n225\n00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:43.723\n&gt;&gt; Do it all in one.\n\n226\n00:11:43.723 --> 00:11:47.014\nSo, Adobe has this great little\nengine right here that can do that,\n\n227\n00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:49.460\nyou can set it at the very beginning.\n\n228\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.330\nIf you know all your media needs to\nbe copied in proxy, or later on,\n\n229\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.250\nyou get some new stuff,\nyou can change it in the media browser.\n\n230\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.905\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz we don't wanna do the drag and\ndrop from the file browser, cuz we wanna\n\n231\n00:12:02.905 --> 00:12:07.024\nmake sure everything gets into where\nit needs to be encoded properly.\n\n232\n00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:08.937\nTalking in the same language,\nall that good stuff.\n\n233\n00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:11.489\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you're in that\nsituation where somebody says, hey,\n\n234\n00:12:11.489 --> 00:12:13.220\nyou should make a video for us.\n\n235\n00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.520\nAnd you don't wanna use your phone, and\n\n236\n00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.647\nyou can con somebody into buying\nyou a really high-end camera.\n\n237\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.980\nSome of those file structures, it's not\nlike you just get a Quicktime file.\n\n238\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.350\nYou get a file, and then you get XMP, and\n\n239\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.960\nyou get all this metadata\nthat has to go with it.\n\n240\n00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.820\nSo when you do the copy in the media\nbrowser, it takes the metadata with it.\n\n241\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.325\nYou may miss it if you drag and drop it,\nyou may absolutely miss it if you drag and\n\n242\n00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:38.884\ndrop it.\n\n243\n00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:43.369\n&gt;&gt; And this is one of those basic\nconcepts that's so vitally important, for\n\n244\n00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:47.799\nyou to be able to even move forward\nin doing your editing and everything.\n\n245\n00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:51.814\nIf you can't even get the media\nitself in the proper place,\n\n246\n00:12:51.814 --> 00:12:54.715\nin the proper format, you're up a creek.\n\n247\n00:12:54.715 --> 00:12:58.684\n&gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you pull out\nthe card at the end of the day,\n\n248\n00:12:58.684 --> 00:13:00.550\nI've seen people do this.\n\n249\n00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.260\nThey shoot on something like their Canon,\nand they shoot and they shoot and\n\n250\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:04.800\nthey shoot.\n\n251\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.980\nAnd they put it in, they link it up, and\nthey do some editing, they shut down,\n\n252\n00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.800\nthey pull their card.\n\n253\n00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.840\nThey wipe the card, they put it back in\nthe camera, they open it up the next day.\n\n254\n00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.287\nEverything's offline because it wasn't\nmoved to the right place, and that's bad.\n\n255\n00:13:18.287 --> 00:13:23.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and like you're saying, with\nvideo files, the whole moving part of it.\n\n256\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.882\nIt's not just jpg to jpg, and that kind of\nstuff, so it does take another level up.\n\n257\n00:13:27.882 --> 00:13:29.495\nAnd this is one of those,\n\n258\n00:13:29.495 --> 00:13:34.030\nit's reminding me of the, really read\nthe instructions before you move forward.\n\n259\n00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.626\nCuz we, and I'm just as guilty, It's like,\nI don't need all that beginning stuff,\n\n260\n00:13:37.626 --> 00:13:39.702\nI'm just gonna go right into the meat and\npotatoes.\n\n261\n00:13:39.702 --> 00:13:40.313\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n262\n00:13:40.313 --> 00:13:44.982\n&gt;&gt; But, yeah I didn't learn how to get the\nfork and the knife out to cut the meat.\n\n263\n00:13:44.982 --> 00:13:48.332\n&gt;&gt; To cut the meat, yes [LAUGH] exactly,\nit's like, I would like a good steak, and\n\n264\n00:13:48.332 --> 00:13:50.838\nit's a two pound porterhouse,\nthat kind of thing, yeah.\n\n265\n00:13:50.838 --> 00:13:51.521\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n266\n00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:57.200\nnotice the media browser did both\nof the proxies, they are both done.\n\n267\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.830\nThey are absolutely both done, so\n\n268\n00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.770\nI'm just gonna get rid of\nthe Media Encoder for awhile.\n\n269\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.445\nThis is the nice thing about\nhaving it be a suite based system,\n\n270\n00:14:03.445 --> 00:14:06.701\nis because there's different\napplications to handle different things.\n\n271\n00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:09.160\nIt opens up, and\nit works in the background.\n\n272\n00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.927\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust move over to the project here, and\n\n273\n00:14:13.927 --> 00:14:15.529\nhere is everything.\n\n274\n00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:21.513\nHere it all is, in here, and it's pretty\ngreat, the things that are highlighted\n\n275\n00:14:21.513 --> 00:14:27.167\nnow are the last things that got moved in,\nthat's why they are highlighted.\n\n276\n00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:31.931\nNow I'm in a view that is very\nsimilar to that list view, so\n\n277\n00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:34.089\nit lists everything out.\n\n278\n00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:37.584\nI can switch to an icon view, and\n\n279\n00:14:37.584 --> 00:14:41.989\nsome people absolutely love this view.\n\n280\n00:14:41.989 --> 00:14:45.620\nI'm okay with it, sometimes I like it,\nsometimes I don't, here's how to read it.\n\n281\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.860\nSo if you were seeing video, it has video,\n\n282\n00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.960\nif you see this little icon,\nit does contain audio.\n\n283\n00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.340\nNow whether it's good or bad audio,\n\n284\n00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.290\nyou don't know, it could have just\nbeen you left the camera's audio on.\n\n285\n00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.431\nAnd again, we can have the hummer scrub,\nI can click on it, and\n\n286\n00:15:05.431 --> 00:15:08.950\nI can take a look through it,\nby just hitting Spacebar.\n\n287\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.463\nThat was just a short one,\nhere's the cat, boy, he is gonna be loud.\n\n288\n00:15:16.023 --> 00:15:17.840\nYeah, he's loud.\n\n289\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we use cats in some of\nour examples in Office Pro TV, and\n\n290\n00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.778\nit's all about my cats, Fuego and Bishop.\n\n291\n00:15:25.778 --> 00:15:28.182\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, what I say,\nthere's the three Ps of production,\n\n292\n00:15:28.182 --> 00:15:29.303\nif you're told to do a video.\n\n293\n00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:35.390\nYou want a puppy, a prescholer,\nand, I've lost it.\n\n294\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.698\nI know it's a puppy, a preshooler,\nI'll remember in a second, but\n\n295\n00:15:38.698 --> 00:15:40.648\nif you have all three, you've made it.\n\n296\n00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:41.631\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome [LAUGH].\n\n297\n00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:43.610\n&gt;&gt; A puppy, a prescholer and a puppet.\n\n298\n00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.834\nSo I have a cat, which is kinda close,\nI have no children, but\n\n299\n00:15:46.834 --> 00:15:49.253\nI have a puppet later on,\nso we're good to go.\n\n300\n00:15:49.253 --> 00:15:54.621\nSo it will also tell you things like\nhow much time it is, what the name is.\n\n301\n00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:57.919\nThis is something up here\nthat's very interesting, and\n\n302\n00:15:57.919 --> 00:16:01.320\nsome people will turn it on and\nturn it off.\n\n303\n00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:08.360\nThe way you can adjust what you see\ninside of a panel is this little thing.\n\n304\n00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.990\nIt looks like what we call a control menu,\nso a list of items.\n\n305\n00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:16.600\nIf you go up to something like the menu\nbar and see this list underneath, okay.\n\n306\n00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.670\nThis is supposed to represent\nthe list of possibilities.\n\n307\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.570\nSo if I click it,\nthis is what people are like, boy, boy.\n\n308\n00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:25.550\nNo, just calm down.\n\n309\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.870\nIf you've never done it before,\nhere's a little group right here.\n\n310\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.490\nThis works with just the panel.\n\n311\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.340\nI can close it, undock it.\n\n312\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.320\nI can close every other panel including\nthe media browser libraries and all that\n\n313\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.200\nin the group, and then I have different\nsettings that we'll go through later.\n\n314\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.700\nNew Bin and all that, we'll do later.\n\n315\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.600\nNow, this is called a Preview Area.\n\n316\n00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:52.090\nI can take that off and I get more\nsort of screen real estate, okay?\n\n317\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.370\nWe're gonna explore the Preview Area\na little bit later.\n\n318\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.860\nBut this is one way people\nlike to organize their stuff,\n\n319\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.530\nis they just go through and\nlook at it this way.\n\n320\n00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.218\nIf I go back to the list view,\n\n321\n00:17:03.218 --> 00:17:09.284\nI do have the ability to say Thumbnails.\n\n322\n00:17:09.284 --> 00:17:12.230\nAnd it will put a small\nthumbnail next to each one.\n\n323\n00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.370\nAnd I can get a little bit of\na view of what's going on.\n\n324\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.540\n&gt;&gt; This is like details\nview in your Finder or\n\n325\n00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.570\nanything like that where I'll\nneed to see like the file size,\n\n326\n00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.670\nthe start time, instead just doing\nthe graphics in the other view.\n\n327\n00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.960\nSo I can see the benefits to\nboth of these types of views.\n\n328\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.770\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nyou'll notice I have scrolled up.\n\n329\n00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.819\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, done the little sizer,\n\n330\n00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:36.923\nthe little zoom in.\n\n331\n00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:38.053\nAnd, yeah, I get more.\n\n332\n00:17:38.053 --> 00:17:42.670\nNot only that\n&gt;&gt; Do you get the previewing here?\n\n333\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.895\n&gt;&gt; Nope, not in the thumbnail.\n\n334\n00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:45.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So you'll have to do the other.\n\n335\n00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.950\nIt's interesting, you'll notice,\nbecause I shot this on my phone,\n\n336\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.100\nI have all these variable frame rates.\n\n337\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.910\nIt's not really standardized frame rates,\nwhich is fine, Adobe can compensate for\n\n338\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.930\nthat, okay?\n\n339\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.620\nIt can compensate for\nthat in the timeline.\n\n340\n00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.110\nOne way to organize, I'm gonna show\nyou a couple of different ways.\n\n341\n00:18:02.613 --> 00:18:05.430\nOkay, this one is called a search bin.\n\n342\n00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.830\nNow, if I click it,\nit will say search all the metadata?\n\n343\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.645\nMetadata are each of these\nlittle like column headings.\n\n344\n00:18:16.645 --> 00:18:19.730\nAnd I can say let's just go with name.\n\n345\n00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.306\nFind the word black, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:25.306 --> 00:18:30.740\nEverything from the black magic\ncamera is now in that search folder.\n\n347\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.790\nThe interesting thing is this.\n\n348\n00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.810\nIf I scroll down,\nyou will see the black magic stuff here.\n\n349\n00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.500\nWhat it's just doing is,\nI need a quick folder to just find what\n\n350\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.135\nI shot on the black magic and\nI know that it is that.\n\n351\n00:18:44.135 --> 00:18:47.117\nIt doesn't duplicate any media.\n\n352\n00:18:47.117 --> 00:18:48.463\nIt doesn't duplicate any clips.\n\n353\n00:18:48.463 --> 00:18:50.680\nAnd we're gonna talk about the difference\nbetween a clip and media later.\n\n354\n00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.070\nIt doesn't duplicate any of that.\n\n355\n00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.470\nIt's just, I need to find this,\nand I need to find it right now.\n\n356\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:01.140\nThat is a search bin, and\nyou've searched for it.\n\n357\n00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.090\nI can just as easily delete it.\n\n358\n00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.540\nI just hit the Delete key.\n\n359\n00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.910\nThe black magic stuff is still there.\n\n360\n00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.260\n&gt;&gt; So it's almost like the favorites.\n\n361\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's just a different way,\n\n362\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.300\nlike a collection.\n\n363\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.070\n&gt;&gt; It's very close to a favorite, yes.\n\n364\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.494\nSo now, what if I did a find?\n\n365\n00:19:18.309 --> 00:19:23.787\nAnd I said, okay, a name,\nand it contains MVI.\n\n366\n00:19:25.677 --> 00:19:28.572\nAnd I go find.\n\n367\n00:19:28.572 --> 00:19:32.631\nOkay, sensitive [INAUDIBLE],\nfind what, MVI, yes.\n\n368\n00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:37.371\nThen contains [SOUND] match any.\n\n369\n00:19:39.734 --> 00:19:41.550\nSo, matching any, instead of all.\n\n370\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.960\nNow, watch what happens.\n\n371\n00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.420\nAs I click through,\nit just keeps going to the next one.\n\n372\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.520\nSo, if I have stuff scattered everywhere,\nI say find, okay,\n\n373\n00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.770\nfind it, not that, not that one,\nnot that one, not that one, not that one.\n\n374\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.670\nIt skips the black magic stuff.\n\n375\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.100\nIt'll go right straight back to the top.\n\n376\n00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.419\nSome people like doing this type of find.\n\n377\n00:20:04.419 --> 00:20:08.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz the search bin is\nmaking a little collection for you,\n\n378\n00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:10.210\nand you can collapse it.\n\n379\n00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.980\nCuz I saw there was collapsible and\nexpandable buttons next to that bin,\n\n380\n00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.030\nand it stays there.\n\n381\n00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.170\nThis is just like I need to find it and\nthen be done.\n\n382\n00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.200\nI don't need to keep it for later.\n\n383\n00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.610\n&gt;&gt; And instead of clicking around.\n\n384\n00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.840\nBut I can also make it more detailed.\n\n385\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:26.260\nI can add another value to it to say I\nwould like to find it based on two things.\n\n386\n00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n387\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.020\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n388\n00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.830\nthere's like benefits and\ndrawbacks with each one.\n\n389\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.620\nLet's say frame rate.\n\n390\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.619\nAnd it contains 22, right?\n\n391\n00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:37.880\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou couldn't do this in the search bin?\n\n392\n00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.040\nWith this many parameters.\n\n393\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.990\n&gt;&gt; No, the search bin is\njust like I need this, yeah.\n\n394\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.070\nIt's like boom.\n\n395\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.801\nSo watch this.\n\n396\n00:20:44.801 --> 00:20:47.740\nSo 22, it's finding the other\n22s which is interesting.\n\n397\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.250\nI'd have to find a different\none to make it work.\n\n398\n00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.930\nBut, yeah, it's considering it that.\n\n399\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.650\nBut, yeah, you can find and\n\n400\n00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.650\nyou put in various different\nparameters to make it happen.\n\n401\n00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.140\nThe search bin, yeah, I can do two.\n\n402\n00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.727\nJust like find I can do two and\nit just pops them in there.\n\n403\n00:21:02.727 --> 00:21:03.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n404\n00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.450\nthat's where I can easily find them.\n\n405\n00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.000\nI can create standard bins.\n\n406\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:13.364\nLike let's say I just want,\nI need to start separating this stuff out.\n\n407\n00:21:13.364 --> 00:21:19.096\nSo I take these two black magics here,\nand there's a bin icon over here.\n\n408\n00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:24.450\nOkay, now all I have to do,\nI can click it and create a new bin and\n\n409\n00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.000\ndrag things into it.\n\n410\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.970\nThis is one of the things I like about\nAdobe, is I can simply take these two.\n\n411\n00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.870\nDrag it and they go in and\nI can say see more.\n\n412\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.120\nSee more?\n\n413\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.768\nYes.\nSee more real.\n\n414\n00:21:39.768 --> 00:21:40.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n415\n00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.200\n&gt;&gt; There is in Photoshop\nto the same thing.\n\n416\n00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.915\nYou drag it over and makes a layer-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n417\n00:21:43.915 --> 00:21:44.780\n&gt;&gt; A layer group.\n\n418\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.674\nSo this is like you're saying,\nwe're organizing it for ourselves,\n\n419\n00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:51.776\nwhat make sense of how I need\nto put my clips or, clips and\n\n420\n00:21:51.776 --> 00:21:52.630\nwhat-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n421\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.840\nAnd what was the other one?\n\n422\n00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.386\n&gt;&gt; Clips.\nClips, titles, anything.\n\n423\n00:21:56.386 --> 00:21:58.220\n&gt;&gt;

Do you think because we were\ngetting kind deep into those?\n\n484\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.130\n&gt;&gt; Deep, I'm going in deep, I'm in fast.\n\n485\n00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:59.880\nNow this is what'll happen too It\nappears that Adobe, stop it, okay.\n\n486\n00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.080\nIt appear that Adobe Premiere Pro closed\nunexpectedly in the previous session.\n\n487\n00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.070\nDo you want to open the previous project?\n\n488\n00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.808\n&gt;&gt;

All right, great and\n\n500\n00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.955\nagain this is like basic\n&gt;&gt; Information that they,\n\n501\n00:25:42.955 --> 00:25:47.285\nsome people kind of scrub over,\n&gt;&gt; Scrub over it's like get in no, no,no,\n\n502\n00:25:47.285 --> 00:25:49.585\nyou don't have to go clicking around.\n\n503\n00:25:49.585 --> 00:25:52.735\nYou can create these things that will help\nyou organize, and get through your media\n\n504\n00:25:52.735 --> 00:25:56.055\nfaster, and get to the things that\nyou wanna do much, much faster.\n\n505\n00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:59.455\nIf you're spending all your\ntime trying to find your media\n\n506\n00:25:59.455 --> 00:26:01.265\nyou will be very very unhappy.\n\n507\n00:26:01.265 --> 00:26:04.575\n&gt;&gt; If you're using one or two pieces,\nokay, then they're right there.\n\n508\n00:26:04.575 --> 00:26:08.870\nBut if you're using 20 30, 40 different\npieces and clips and audio files.\n\n509\n00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:09.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If you need.\n\n510\n00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.240\nIf you just kind of take\na little bit at a time.\n\n511\n00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.610\nThink about how do I wanna organize this\nto be able to be fast and be effective.\n\n512\n00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.090\n&gt;&gt; The worst one you'll get and\nwe're gonna explore it later is, hey,\n\n513\n00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.050\nwe've got a thousand pictures.\n\n514\n00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.080\nCan you do that Ken Burns thing\nwhere you make them move and\n\n515\n00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.190\nall that and just find everything\nat the blink of an eye.\n\n516\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.020\nThat'll happen.\n\n517\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.510\nThat's going to happen to you.\n\n518\n00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.280\nAnd here's, well I'll show you how we\nget that organized out, quite frankly.\n\n519\n00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.360\n&gt;&gt;

It's good to be back.\n\n7\n00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI hear that we are talking even\n\n8\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.380\nmore about project organization.\n\n9\n00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.078\n&gt;&gt; The exciting world of projects.\n\n10\n00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:36.977\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Organization.\n\n11\n00:00:36.977 --> 00:00:41.100\n&gt;&gt; But if we organize ourselves it's\ngoing to be very beneficial for\n\n12\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.730\nus later down the road.\n\n13\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.390\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe revisiting projects like six\n\n14\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.320\nmonths maybe even a year later.\n\n15\n00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And knowing like,\n\n16\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.950\nif I organize it properly, it's going to\nprevent me from pulling all my hair out.\n\n17\n00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly it just\nkinda sort of rip it out.\n\n18\n00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Not the whole thing but\n\n19\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.710\nyeah that's exactly what you want it for.\n\n20\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.060\nI mean you may have to go back and\ndo something in six months to a year.\n\n21\n00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.550\nI mean you may say, that was so great,\ncan you update it for this year?\n\n22\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.940\nOr you know, if you don't have great\norganization, and you swore, it's like,\n\n23\n00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.820\nI know I got that shot,\nI know I got it, and\n\n24\n00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600\nyou can't find it, and you either work\naround it and you for a re-shoot, and\n\n25\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.330\nspend all this money and whatever,\nand you come back and you find it.\n\n26\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.910\nBecause you just didn't organize it well.\n\n27\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.080\nYou gotta do that.\n\n28\n00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.400\n&gt;&gt; And if you start kind of putting\nyourself into like your best practises.\n\n29\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.920\nThis is the way I'm going\nto organize things.\n\n30\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.270\nThis is the way I'm gonna label things.\n\n31\n00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.055\nWe've got into that metadata\nof making our own labels.\n\n32\n00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:41.415\nThat's gonna be huge because that's more\nof like I know that this is about Seymour.\n\n33\n00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:44.485\nAnd if I label this as Seymour\nthat's a metadata that's not\n\n34\n00:01:44.485 --> 00:01:45.715\nin there automatically.\n\n35\n00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:49.795\nBut if I start doing this\nall the time I will be able\n\n36\n00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:54.255\nto kinda set my own way of doing things\nand I can go back and find something.\n\n37\n00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:57.175\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nthis is kind of what I've set up now for\n\n38\n00:01:57.175 --> 00:01:58.445\nthis little project I'm doing.\n\n39\n00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:00.820\nI could set it up much more elaborately,\nbut\n\n40\n00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.040\nI wanted to keep it as simple as possible.\n\n41\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.820\nBecause I think you and\n\n42\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.775\nI are talking about the more elaborate\nyou make it when you back it’s like.\n\n43\n00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:09.299\nWhat was that again?\n\n44\n00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:10.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.400\n&gt;&gt; What did I mean by that?\n\n46\n00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.510\nI don't know.\n\n47\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.510\nSo I'm just keeping it very simple.\n\n48\n00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.510\nSo if I look down here I created\nthree metadata displays, okay,\n\n49\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.210\nor three properties.\n\n50\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.150\nOne called cat, one called garden and\none called puppet.\n\n51\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.070\nAnd just put in that now I can move them.\n\n52\n00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.160\nIf I could say the puppet's more\nimportant I can move that here.\n\n53\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.840\nSee where that blue thing is?\n\n54\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.480\n&gt;&gt; Blue.\n&gt;&gt; Blue is a very important color\n\n55\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.070\nin Adobe.\n\n56\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.400\nLike right now this blue is telling me\nthat I'm working in the editing workspace.\n\n57\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.730\nSo focus on blue, okay.\n\n58\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.380\nAnd we're going to get more\ninto that in this lesson.\n\n59\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.685\nSo now if I turn down watermelon here.\n\n60\n00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:53.860\nAh-ha, so\nthese two shots are in the garden.\n\n61\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.100\nSo that gets a yes, okay.\n\n62\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.500\nOr if I say Seymour_real [INAUDIBLE].\n\n63\n00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.300\nSo this is a metadata parameter\nthat I can use and find.\n\n64\n00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.550\nOkay, or notice there's a little\nturn down here next to name.\n\n65\n00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.220\nIf I come to Cat and do that, boom.\n\n66\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.410\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm essentially\n\n67\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.290\nloading everything at\nthe Y close to the top.\n\n68\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're doing the sorting, you're\ndoing the ascending and descending order.\n\n69\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's an ascending and\ndescending sort.\n\n70\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.660\nAnd that works in Name,\nit works in all the columns.\n\n71\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.190\nSo you can do it that way.\n\n72\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.200\nSo there's a million different ways.\n\n73\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.430\nSo now how am I supposed\nto find a bunch of.\n\n74\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.290\nYeah, technically in the garden\nthese would all get a Y.\n\n75\n00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.640\nBut I'm gonna go back here to\nthat preview area up here.\n\n76\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.290\nAnd you'll notice I'm gonna come down,\nI'm gonna grab this one.\n\n77\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.670\nThis has got a little play button.\n\n78\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.910\nIt also has a little scroll button,\nso I can hit play, and there it is.\n\n79\n00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.670\nI can do this too.\n\n80\n00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.130\nI don't see a puppet,\nbut I see a garden, so\n\n81\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.670\nI can start tagging that with\nY's in garden instead of puppet.\n\n82\n00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.620\nNot only that,\nthis is the interesting part.\n\n83\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.960\nIt won't be as easy to see here\nas it will be here, all right?\n\n84\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.390\nYou can see in this whole\nthing there is a back of him,\n\n85\n00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:19.260\nNow here is him sort of looking at me.\n\n86\n00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.273\nIf I hit this little camera, It changes\n\n87\n00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:30.240\nthe representative thumbnail or\nwhat we often call a poster frame.\n\n88\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.010\nSo that way when I look at these,\nokay, like, at number three here,\n\n89\n00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.530\nthis is where I think\nI'd physically cut it.\n\n90\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.430\nOkay, boom, and I'm gonna get it\nright to the knife in my hand,\n\n91\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.510\nand say, that's the poster frame, so\nI know the difference between these two,\n\n92\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.750\nand they're very small, but, again,\nI can make them a little bigger, and\n\n93\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.400\nthat changes that and\nthat helps me organized too.\n\n94\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it gives me a frame\nreference of like you're saying.\n\n95\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like something that's in the file or\n\n96\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.360\nin the clip that I have but\nit's not at the very beginning.\n\n97\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's not the true representation of\n\n98\n00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.050\nwhat this is about.\n\n99\n00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.840\n&gt;&gt; What's the most important part and\nI can use this to set that.\n\n100\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.510\nNow, there's a hot key that does this too,\nbut in many cases,\n\n101\n00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.810\nthis one tends to just be\na little bit more fun.\n\n102\n00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n103\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.950\nthis more like the visual organization\ninstead of the columns with the Ys.\n\n104\n00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.980\nAnd there's different ways that I can\nquickly be able to organize myself.\n\n105\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.210\nEven more organization.\n\n106\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.810\n&gt;&gt; Even more organization.\n\n107\n00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.630\nNow, it also tells me something like this.\n\n108\n00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.840\nThis is the name of it.\n\n109\n00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.630\nThis is, it's a movie.\n\n110\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.110\nIt's 1920 by 1080, okay,\nin terms of resolution, one pixel.\n\n111\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.860\nThat's how long it is,\nthat's my frame rate, it has audio, and\n\n112\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.670\nit's compressed stereo.\n\n113\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.030\nSo, it gives me all this\ninformation that's also\n\n114\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.620\nin the metadata properties here.\n\n115\n00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.570\nBut this is a little one shot coming up\ntoward the end of the lesson you're gonna\n\n116\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.780\nsee something really cool with this too.\n\n117\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.800\nLike really cool.\n\n118\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.540\nOkay.\n\n119\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.350\nAnd when a lot of people see it they go,\nwow.\n\n120\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.890\n&gt;&gt; Ken is a nice little teaser aren't you?\n\n121\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI'm good at that.\n\n122\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now I'm going to hit- or\n\n123\n00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.530\nin this case you know what?\n\n124\n00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.010\nI'm gonna click this.\n\n125\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:13.130\nClose panel, undoc,\nRestore Panel Group Size, boom.\n\n126\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.700\nThat's the same thing as using\nthat tilde/accent grave that's\n\n127\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.750\nunder the Escape.\n\n128\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.020\nSome people don't like,\nsome people love the mouse, so\n\n129\n00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.140\nthis is a great way to do it.\n\n130\n00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.360\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout left side and right side.\n\n131\n00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:35.860\nIf I sort of move this, okay,\nI'm gonna move my workspace around.\n\n132\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.870\nAnd we're gonna get into changing it so\nthat you'll like it better,\n\n133\n00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.560\na little bit later.\n\n134\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.130\nAnd I move the tools, so it stretches out.\n\n135\n00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.500\nYou notice there's a line here.\n\n136\n00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.140\nOkay, between source and\nprogram, I'm going to say,\n\n137\n00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.040\nthis is the left side and\nthis is the right side.\n\n138\n00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.770\nAnd what we're trying to get is stuff\nfrom the left into the right, all right?\n\n139\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.540\nSo for now, this is where all my stuff is,\nthis is where all my clips are,\n\n140\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.570\nand that's when people say what is\nthe difference between a clip and\n\n141\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.790\na piece of media?\n\n142\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.720\nThey'll be like what is the difference,\nI don't understand.\n\n143\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I go and you said clips and\nthere's something else,\n\n144\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.330\ntrying to use that lingo,\nthat terminology is.\n\n145\n00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.970\nMe being a non video person,\ncuz I'm thinking, well,\n\n146\n00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.240\nthey're all clips aren't they?\n\n147\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.440\n&gt;&gt; Media as we like to say has essence.\n\n148\n00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.110\nSo it's this stuff that we actually shot.\n\n149\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.770\nSo you can go and\nwe saw the files in the media browser.\n\n150\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.530\nIf I do this,\nif I come to this right here.\n\n151\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.630\nAnd I control click it.\n\n152\n00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.290\nI can get all of these I get\na list of things I can do to this.\n\n153\n00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.530\nOne of these is duplicate.\n\n154\n00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:02.675\nWhat most people think is, so\nnow there's another piece of media.\n\n155\n00:08:02.675 --> 00:08:06.341\n[NOISE] If I control click it.\n\n156\n00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:09.890\nAnd the other thing I can\nsay is Reveal in Finder.\n\n157\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.640\nSo if I need to find it,\nI can reveal where it's located.\n\n158\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.410\nAnd it does that.\n\n159\n00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.540\nThere's nothing that says MTS Copy one.\n\n160\n00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.390\n&gt;&gt; Cuz like you just said.\n\n161\n00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; To me I'm over here going well, wait,\n\n162\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.160\nwhen I duplicate a file in my Finder,\n\n163\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.820\nit says copy and then there's\nanother physical copy of that file.\n\n164\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n165\n00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.100\nThis is kind of like IKEA.\n\n166\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.570\nIn that this is the Swedish table.\n\n167\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:44.840\nThis is the instructions\nabout the Swedish table.\n\n168\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:50.250\nSo I simply have two sets of\ninstructions for the table, okay.\n\n169\n00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.960\nI can even do this.\n\n170\n00:08:56.168 --> 00:09:00.450\nWatermelon, okay, and\nI've changed the name completely.\n\n171\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.420\nAnd I will say, please locate this.\n\n172\n00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.678\nOkay, reveal that in the finder.\n\n173\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.380\nIt's the same thing.\n\n174\n00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:12.760\n&gt;&gt; Is it like making an alias?\n\n175\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.970\n&gt;&gt; It's not like an alias,\nit's the idea that\n\n176\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.500\nthese are just instructions linked\nback to the piece of media.\n\n177\n00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.380\nI can put that together\nin the instructions or\n\n178\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.900\nthe metadata anyway I want.\n\n179\n00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.210\nI still have the same parts.\n\n180\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.960\nSo, in this case, I've renamed it.\n\n181\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.280\nI've got two of them, but\nall I have are two sets of metadata.\n\n182\n00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.060\nOr two sets of instructions.\n\n183\n00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.120\nThat's it.\n\n184\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n185\n00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.200\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't actually create\na new physical entity.\n\n186\n00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.121\n&gt;&gt; It's still going to the same place.\n\n187\n00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Still going to the same place.\n\n188\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.130\nIt's just looking at that.\n\n189\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.980\nIt's like I can change\nanything I want about this and\n\n190\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.019\nit doesn't affect the parts.\n\n191\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.950\n&gt;&gt; It's the organization.\n\n192\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.520\nIt's how I wanna be able to understand it.\n\n193\n00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.340\nBut not changing the source data.\n\n194\n00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n195\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly it's not changing nothing\n\n196\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.620\nabout, it doesn't create new media so\nit doesn't bog down your hard drives with\n\n197\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.680\nnew stuff\n&gt;&gt; I think the duplicate thing kind of\n\n198\n00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.180\nthrew me off.\n\n199\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it throws you, because it's like,\nwell, I duplicated it, so\n\n200\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.020\nif I've got a 100 gigabyte file,\nand I've just duplicated it,\n\n201\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.510\nI have a new 100 gigabyte file.\n\n202\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:29.040\nNo, I don't, I just have a new piece\nof metadata that I can manipulate.\n\n203\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:35.500\nSo if I am manipulate any of these\nmaster clips, as we call them.\n\n204\n00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.840\nIt doesn't affect.\n\n205\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.280\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm within my project and\nI wanna put a new label on it.\n\n206\n00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.600\nI'm labeling this-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n207\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.330\n&gt;&gt; Seymour the Cat.\n\n208\n00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.110\n&gt;&gt; If I edit it, make it shorter,\nanything like that, it doesn't affect it.\n\n209\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.060\nAnd that's what people seem to\nthink cuz I've had people say.\n\n210\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.990\nI'll come in and\nthey'll have 92 duplicates, and\n\n211\n00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.490\nI'm like, why do you have 92?\n\n212\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.080\nWell I made a different edit every single\ntime, it's like, it doesn't matter.\n\n213\n00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.240\nIt doesn't matter,\nit's just a set of material instructions,\n\n214\n00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.770\nyou haven't duplicated or\nreplaced any media.\n\n215\n00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.710\nNow we'll talk about doing that later,\nand that can get a little scary for\n\n216\n00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.280\npeople But yeah.\n\n217\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that source file out there,\nyou're not changing anything out there.\n\n218\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:19.870\n&gt;&gt; Nope, not changing.\n\n219\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.550\n&gt;&gt; This is for inside of Premier Pro how\nyou're going to be able to use the pieces.\n\n220\n00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n221\n00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n222\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n223\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.360\nThat's exactly what it's doing.\n\n224\n00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n225\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.920\nnow one of the things I'm\nfinding hard to do right now,\n\n226\n00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.040\nis while I'm working with this,\nit's really hard to see.\n\n227\n00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.120\nCuz I've been trying to scroll, and when I\ncan't find this, I keep going over here.\n\n228\n00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.900\nPremiere Pro has a lot of different\npreferences that you can adjust.\n\n229\n00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.120\nSome of them, you have to adjust for\ncertain things, all right?\n\n230\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.805\nThe easiest is appearance.\n\n231\n00:11:50.805 --> 00:11:54.300\n[LAUGH] It's just like, okay, now what?\n\n232\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:00.060\nIt's like,\ndarker make it lighter, okay now,\n\n233\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.470\nthat's a little easier for\nme to see, okay.\n\n234\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.340\nNow then, there's always the defaults\nokay, which just means dark.\n\n235\n00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.530\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is when they went to\n\n236\n00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.910\nthose darker workspaces.\n\n237\n00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, mm-hm.\n\n238\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.460\n&gt;&gt; Instead of having like the lighter\nones and where you can change everything.\n\n239\n00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.950\n&gt;&gt; When people started doing more\ncolor correction in editing systems,\n\n240\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.330\nthey wanted a darker interface.\n\n241\n00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.700\nSo it wouldn't affect, and\nit does affect your eyes with that.\n\n242\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.420\nOkay the interactive controls I\ncan make them darker or lighter so\n\n243\n00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:34.090\nI can create something very\ncontrasty that helps me see.\n\n244\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.120\nSo now I'm done.\n\n245\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.893\nOkay?\n\n246\n00:12:35.893 --> 00:12:38.035\nLighter, that's a little too light.\n\n247\n00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:39.095\nThat's a little too light.\n\n248\n00:12:39.095 --> 00:12:41.245\nLet me zoom back a little bit so\nI can click OK.\n\n249\n00:12:41.245 --> 00:12:44.295\n&gt;&gt; These are all preferences of how\nI want to be able to see things.\n\n250\n00:12:44.295 --> 00:12:46.325\nAnd I even do it when I'm teaching.\n\n251\n00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:50.075\nI'll set it differently than\nwhen I'm actually working.\n\n252\n00:12:50.075 --> 00:12:53.590\nCuz people can see it on the screen a\nlittle bit better and so on and so forth.\n\n253\n00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.770\nBut every, this is completely up to you.\n\n254\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it's one of those things\nthat's like I couldn't really see that\n\n255\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.450\nbefore and I couldn't scroll up and\ndown and it's driving me nuts.\n\n256\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.880\nBut now, I can, okay?\n\n257\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.050\nAnd it makes me much happier.\n\n258\n00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI can see it a little bit better, too.\n\n259\n00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.285\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad.\n\n260\n00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:05.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n261\n00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.670\nAnd that's one of those things.\n\n262\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.200\nIt's like people sit there, they go,\nthis is terrible, this doesn't work.\n\n263\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.020\nThere's always a way to change something.\n\n264\n00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.630\nOr if there isn't with Adobe,\nsend an email.\n\n265\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.717\nTell them you got a problem.\n\n266\n00:13:15.717 --> 00:13:18.960\nAnd usually they respond and\nthey'll be like we'll take a look at that.\n\n267\n00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.600\nAnd usually a couple of versions in,\nthey have figured it out.\n\n268\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.680\nSo I'll come back over here and\nonce again panel group settings,\n\n269\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.050\nI'm gonna say restore.\n\n270\n00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.130\nOkay, now I can see stuff and it's great.\n\n271\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.840\nI can stretch this out a little bit and\nI can get there.\n\n272\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.540\nI'm so happy, I'm a happy guy.\n\n273\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.660\nSo, what am I going to try and do now?\n\n274\n00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.290\nFirst of all I'm actually going to get\nrid of the preview area for now so\n\n275\n00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.060\nI can kind of get in there and\nget to some of this stuff.\n\n276\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.879\nThe next thing I need to\ndo is sort of fine tune.\n\n277\n00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.060\nMost people, what they do is they\njust start the old double click.\n\n278\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.090\nDouble click here, okay, there it is.\n\n279\n00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.500\nDouble click, double click, double click.\n\n280\n00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.270\nThere's actually a more\nfun way to do this.\n\n281\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.390\n&gt;&gt; There's always a better, more funner.\n\n282\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.420\nMore funner, I just said that.\n\n283\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.450\n&gt;&gt; There's always a more funner way.\n\n284\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.260\nLet me just stretch this up so\nyou can see it a little better.\n\n285\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.600\nOkay, I hit the media browser by accident.\n\n286\n00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.120\nAnd I'm going to take all\nof this garden footage.\n\n287\n00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.110\nI will highlight at the top and\n\n288\n00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.040\njust, if you've ever worked in\nany application, shift+click.\n\n289\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:30.900\nAnd then I'm just gonna drag them all,\nRight up here, okay?\n\n290\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.570\nI drug them all up there.\n\n291\n00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.960\nEverybody's like okay.\n\n292\n00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:43.640\nI can only see one at a time, but\nif I do this, Now I can see better, okay?\n\n293\n00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.448\nAnd I've got my ability to scroll through.\n\n294\n00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:50.210\nNow here's the interesting part.\n\n295\n00:14:52.100 --> 00:15:01.410\nAnother set of hotkeys that I like are the\nability to go to the different panels.\n\n296\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.430\n&gt;&gt; What are you doing there?\n\n297\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.270\n&gt;&gt; I am just, I'm scrolling\nthrough everything I got up here.\n\n298\n00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I can load up to 20 clips up here.\n\n299\n00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:14.410\nAnd it is, if I go around the clock face,\nshift+1, can you tell it's the project?\n\n300\n00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.200\nBecause it's now highlighted in blue.\n\n301\n00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.280\n&gt;&gt; Down at the bottom.\n\n302\n00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, if I shift plus two,\nI've ended up in the source.\n\n303\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.040\n&gt;&gt; You're changing the focus\nas to which panel.\n\n304\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:29.530\n&gt;&gt; Which is highlighted or which one has,\nyeah, this is the panel of focus.\n\n305\n00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.770\nThe interesting thing is if I\njust keep hitting shift two.\n\n306\n00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.800\nNow you're going through.\n\n307\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.490\n&gt;&gt; I'm scrolling through\neverything I have up there.\n\n308\n00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.100\n&gt;&gt; I like that, that's nice.\n\n309\n00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.780\n&gt;&gt; So if I hit Shift+3, that's\nthe timeline, Shift+4 is the program.\n\n310\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.850\nI'm just gonna go back to two, and\nthis is how I can look through everything.\n\n311\n00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:51.630\nAnd I'm still on the left side, so\nI'm just managing my clips, yeah.\n\n312\n00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.397\n&gt;&gt; No, I was doing the one, two, three,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah [CROSSTALK]\n\n313\n00:15:54.397 --> 00:15:55.277\n&gt;&gt; Shift one, two,\n\n314\n00:15:55.277 --> 00:15:59.214\nthree I'm going around and being able to\nand these are those things that when you\n\n315\n00:15:59.214 --> 00:16:03.268\nstart cuz it's one of those like it's\na tiniest little thing like men that makes\n\n316\n00:16:03.268 --> 00:16:06.732\nit so much easier for me to like jump\naround rather than take in my hand,\n\n317\n00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:08.760\nputting on the mouse moving it around.\n\n318\n00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.910\n&gt;&gt; Just keep going down and\ndouble clicking, And let me see something.\n\n319\n00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.640\nLet me see if Seymour is in here,\nI can't remember.\n\n320\n00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.900\nThat's a sunflower.\n\n321\n00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.080\n&gt;&gt; And you just hit the spacebar to play.\n\n322\n00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.260\n&gt;&gt; Just hit the spacebar.\n\n323\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.390\nThe only thing I can do this to is this,\nnotice that this time is blue.\n\n324\n00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.470\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Over there, mm-hm.\n\n325\n00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can either pick up this\nplay head, sometimes called a location\n\n326\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:33.530\nindicator and do that\n&gt;&gt; Or anytime you see the hand with\n\n327\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:41.410\nthe little arrows-\n&gt;&gt; You can scrub through it.\n\n328\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nOkay, or I could type in,\n\n329\n00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.280\nactually go to 0000 1020.\n\n330\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.060\n&gt;&gt; No need for\nall the colons and [INAUDIBLE].\n\n331\n00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.890\n&gt;&gt; Nope, you do not need any of that.\n\n332\n00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.840\nIt will do that automatically and\nI can do that.\n\n333\n00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.700\n&gt;&gt; That's so much easier.\n\n334\n00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.870\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm gonna shift to again,\nI think we have Seymour in here.\n\n335\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.840\nLet's check and I will grab the space bar,\nnot the space bar, but the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n336\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.135\nYep, there he is.\n\n337\n00:17:03.135 --> 00:17:06.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's puppet Seymour okay?\n\n338\n00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Behind my banana plant.\n\n339\n00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.790\nAnd we'll be exploring\na little bit of this later.\n\n340\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:11.570\nBut we've got it.\n\n341\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.840\nSo now that we've got it\nfrom here up into there.\n\n342\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:21.710\nAnd then in the next lesson, we're gonna\nget it out of this and into the timeline\n\n343\n00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.990\nand you're gonna actually tell a little\nstory of Seymour and his garden.\n\n344\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.540\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's pretty cool.\n\n345\n00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But like you said just doing\n\n346\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.600\nthat little bit more\norganization ready to go.\n\n347\n00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.130\nHotkeys yeah, I know it's one of those\nlike when you're starting out you want to\n\n348\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.660\nuse the mouse, but if you can just start\nkind of program it into your head to start\n\n349\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.100\nusing those keys it\nwill be pretty awesome.\n\n350\n00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.170\nAnd I know its Photoshop I'll\nbe doing stuff.\n\n351\n00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.490\nI'm not even like doing any photo editing\nlike, look at all the stuff you're doing.\n\n352\n00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.510\nI just like, zoomed in and out and\nmoved around a little bit.\n\n353\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:57.250\n&gt;&gt; But you're not using the mouse so\npeople are like [NOISE] wizard.\n\n354\n00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:01.354\n[LAUGH] I had a person once you know\neditors we get bored and we do really\n\n355\n00:18:01.354 --> 00:18:05.602\nweird things, so we have contests as\nto how many hotkeys do you know and\n\n356\n00:18:05.602 --> 00:18:09.000\ncan you use and\nit's kind of like the old name that tune.\n\n357\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.125\nIt's like I can move that\nclip in two key strokes.\n\n358\n00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then when you do that\n\n359\n00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.192\nsomebody looks at me and\nscreams Gandalf, like that.\n\n360\n00:18:16.192 --> 00:18:18.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy because you get bored and\n\n361\n00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.290\nyou learn all these things.\n\n362\n00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.500\nAnd I'll teach you little bit about\nwhere you can find key strokes.\n\n363\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.360\nAnd actually make your own and\nmodify your own.\n\n364\n00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:26.950\n&gt;&gt; I love those.\n\n365\n00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:31.240\n&gt;&gt; Which is really fun in Adobe\nbecause once you get into editing you\n\n366\n00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.510\nlearn that there is times you\nlike to use the mouse and\n\n367\n00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.140\nthere's other times it's like, I just want\nto punch one button and just have it work.\n\n368\n00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.500\nAnd it's like okay, boom there you go.\n\n369\n00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.970\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of times you have\nto kind of use the product for\n\n370\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.130\na while to realize can I just go ahead and\nmap that?\n\n371\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.700\nCan I make my shortcut?\n\n372\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.558\n&gt;&gt; A general rule is that\nif you use something.\n\n373\n00:18:48.558 --> 00:18:55.280\nMaybe ten times in a session and\nyou're doing it with a mouse.\n\n374\n00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.350\nPlease, just make a button.\n\n375\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.610\nCuz you're doing it so much that, yeah.\n\n376\n00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.280\n&gt;&gt; And that does come with experience.\n\n377\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.270\n&gt;&gt; It does, yeah.\n\n378\n00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.660\n&gt;&gt; And this is good experience for\nus, to make sure that we know how to\n\n379\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.630\norganize ourselves,\nbe able to get around really fast.\n\n380\n00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.020\nAnd like you said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n381\n00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.890\nnow put all that stuff into our timeline,\nand then make a little clip.\n\n382\n00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.540\nWell, we're gonna make\na project with our clips.\n\n383\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.350\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna make\na project with your clips,\n\n384\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.930\nwe're gonna make\na timeline in the project.\n\n385\n00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.571\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, gotta use that terminology!\n\n386\n00:19:22.571 --> 00:19:23.461\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n387\n00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:24.790\nWell, thank you so much for that-\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n388\n00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.380\n&gt;&gt; Information.\n\n389\n00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.890\nBut we are going to go ahead and\nclose this episode.\n\n390\n00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.560\nSo signing off for creative ProTV,\nI'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n391\n00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.300\n&gt;&gt;

That's right.\n\n27\n00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:00.299\nWe're going a little bit\n\n28\n00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.001\naway from organization now.\nBecause remember, the project panel,\n\n29\n00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:08.464\nsometimes called the project window,\nis where we organize all of our sources,\n\n30\n00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:12.361\nmost likely called master clips.\nEventually we're gonna get into having\n\n31\n00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:16.268\ntitles in there, even some effects and\nsome sequences and some other things that\n\n32\n00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:18.901\nare kind of a little mind blowing.\nBut like I said,\n\n33\n00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:21.066\nthis is just to keep it simple.\nIt's like you\n\n34\n00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:25.400\nwanna get something in there, you wanna\nmake it, export it, and you're done.\n\n35\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.380\nAnd then maybe you'll do it again,\nwho knows?\n\n36\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.020\nSo now we're going to\nthe source monitor and\n\n37\n00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.770\nwe've been talking about the idea that\nthere's this right side and the left side.\n\n38\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.870\nWe're still on the left side.\n\n39\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.130\nIt's kinda like when we read.\n\n40\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.320\nWe go from left to right, okay?\n\n41\n00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.350\nSo right now, we're still working on\nthe left and we have a certain language.\n\n42\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.614\nWe have a source monitor over there,\n\n43\n00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:51.152\nwe have a project panel,\nand we have clips, okay?\n\n44\n00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.454\nAnd we're gonna transfer\nthem into something else.\n\n45\n00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:56.958\nSo if we go back to the computer,\nI've loaded some, all right?\n\n46\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.628\nAnd let me zoom in real quick, okay?\n\n47\n00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:04.503\nUp here and again what happens is\nwhen people sort of start this,\n\n48\n00:02:04.503 --> 00:02:07.589\nthey find a little bit of this daunting.\n\n49\n00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:11.378\nBut using our left to right rule,\njust follow things left to right, and\n\n50\n00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:12.660\nit'll be fine.\n\n51\n00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.390\nIt's telling us it's the source panel.\n\n52\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.685\nAnd we're looking at this particular clip,\nMVI_0078 and it's an MPEG-4, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:25.409\nThat's the one we are looking at,\nthat's the one that's currently loaded.\n\n54\n00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.937\nIf I come over to this control menu,\nI can load other ones or\n\n55\n00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:32.983\nI can do that fancy trick which I'm\ngonna change up in a little bit.\n\n56\n00:02:32.983 --> 00:02:38.880\nI also have another panel, affects\ncontrols, an audio clip mixer, metadata.\n\n57\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.220\nWhat's this thing?\n\n58\n00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.730\nWell sometimes all the panels\ndon't fit into the main panel.\n\n59\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.430\nSo if I click this,\nI can choose them from here.\n\n60\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.320\nOr if I add more to this one,\nit shows me what I'm not seeing.\n\n61\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.934\nIt was the same, it's in all the panels.\n\n62\n00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:57.370\nOkay, so now what do I do to\nsort of navigate through this?\n\n63\n00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.290\nThat hover scrub thing\ndoesn't work anymore, boo.\n\n64\n00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.540\nWell, it's a little bit different.\n\n65\n00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.510\nHere we have many things.\n\n66\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.990\nI'm gonna start.\nThis was where is the playhead position?\n\n67\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.630\nIf I click this and move it back and\nforth, it moves the.\n\n68\n00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.383\nThere it is, hey Puppet Seymour.\n\n69\n00:03:13.383 --> 00:03:15.020\nHow's it going, buddy?\n\n70\n00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.880\nHe's funny,\nhe's going to eat those tomatoes.\n\n71\n00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.595\nYummy yum yum yum.\n\n72\n00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:19.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I can do that.\n\n73\n00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.390\nI can hold and grab this.\n\n74\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.350\nNow I have a thing here called Fit,\nalso known as Select Zoom Level.\n\n75\n00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.018\nWhat that means is if there's\nsomething that I want to boom, 25%.\n\n76\n00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:42.304\nOr something like 150% or\ngo all the way down to 10%.\n\n77\n00:03:42.304 --> 00:03:46.738\nOccasionally there might be some things\nthat we do with Effects where we need to\n\n78\n00:03:46.738 --> 00:03:50.645\nsee slightly outside the picture\nto manipulate things for Effects.\n\n79\n00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:52.331\nRight now if I just do Fit,\n\n80\n00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:56.412\nor what we often call fit the window,\nit is now fit to the panel.\n\n81\n00:03:56.412 --> 00:03:59.600\nThis means drag video only,\nwhich we'll get into in editing.\n\n82\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.415\nThis means drag audio only, however,\n\n83\n00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:06.179\nif I just click them,\nthese are my audio wave forms.\n\n84\n00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:11.079\nI don't have a lot of audio on here right\nnow, you can see a few bumps, okay,\n\n85\n00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.007\nand I can go back to the video.\n\n86\n00:04:13.007 --> 00:04:17.667\nFull, half, quarter, or eighth.\n\n87\n00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:23.683\nSometimes, when you got big media,\nlots of color, lots of motion,\n\n88\n00:04:23.683 --> 00:04:30.354\nwhen you play it back at full resolution,\nit might tax your ram a little bit.\n\n89\n00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:32.449\nAll systems have this.\n\n90\n00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.029\nThis should be your bare minimum on RAM.\n\n91\n00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:36.879\nWell, yours might be\nbelow the bare minimum.\n\n92\n00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.338\nSo you can do is say actually play it back\nat like a quarter of the resolution and\n\n93\n00:04:41.338 --> 00:04:44.440\nit's gonna look fuzzy and\nnot so great once I play it.\n\n94\n00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.620\nBut when it stops,\nit'll go back to full resolution.\n\n95\n00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.924\nI can look at it the whole time.\n\n96\n00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:54.130\nAnd if you export it,\nit's gonna export at the full resolution.\n\n97\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.610\nI'm paranoid, I'd change it back to full\nresolution just because I'm paranoid.\n\n98\n00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.270\nOnce again, we have settings.\n\n99\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.840\nPlayback resolution, pause resolutions,\nLoop, if you want things to loop or\n\n100\n00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.320\ncertain things to show or not show, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.960\nWe're gonna get the audio timing and\nit's in a minute that will be interesting.\n\n102\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.580\nThis is how long this clip actually is.\n\n103\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.150\nIt is 46 seconds and 26 frames.\n\n104\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.480\nOkay, so it goes hours,\nminutes, seconds, frames.\n\n105\n00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.200\nIt is technically called the in and\nout duration and here's why.\n\n106\n00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.860\nYes, I can move this, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.643\nI can do it with the spacebar.\n\n108\n00:05:38.631 --> 00:05:40.912\nNow, if you are occasionally like me,\n\n109\n00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:46.420\nyou wanna work with the keyboard, and the\nmouse, at the same time, with both hands.\n\n110\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.910\nOkay, so, if you're planning on it\nright now, and you've got some media,\n\n111\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.500\nI want you to put your left hand over J,\nK and L because what I can do is this.\n\n112\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.920\nI can hit L and it plays forward.\n\n113\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.830\nThen I can pause it with K and\nthen play it backward with J.\n\n114\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.877\nNow if I hold K, hold down on K and tap L,\n\n115\n00:06:09.877 --> 00:06:15.520\nyou'll notice the playheads\nmoving one frame at a time.\n\n116\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.619\nOr in this case, because it was recorded\non a cell phone, it seems to jump.\n\n117\n00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:22.404\nIt'll jump a couple of frames because,\nagain, when you're working with phones,\n\n118\n00:06:22.404 --> 00:06:24.660\nsometimes you'll get an odd\ntime code like that.\n\n119\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.890\nI'll do the same thing with J,\nwhere I can work back a frame at a time.\n\n120\n00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.390\n&gt;&gt; But is that just with phone footage,\nor is that-\n\n121\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.798\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, usually with phone footage\n\n122\n00:06:31.798 --> 00:06:33.259\nbecause of the way it handles\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n123\n00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:33.824\n&gt;&gt; Time code.\n\n124\n00:06:33.824 --> 00:06:38.920\nIf I keep tapping L, it goes faster.\n\n125\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.083\nIf I tap J several times,\nit'll go backward faster.\n\n126\n00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:46.050\nAnd then here's the other one.\n\n127\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.300\nIf I hold K and hold L,\nit goes forward very slowly.\n\n128\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.910\nIf I hold K and hold J,\nit goes backward very slowly.\n\n129\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.521\n&gt;&gt; That can be really handy I can say.\n\n130\n00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:01.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nyou don't have to use your mouse so much.\n\n131\n00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.960\nYou can use your mouse on the things that\nyou really want to use your mouse with.\n\n132\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.719\nNow, what part of this do\nI want is the question.\n\n133\n00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:17.254\nBecause I don't want all\nof just Seymour doing this,\n\n134\n00:07:17.254 --> 00:07:21.807\nor maybe I want segments of Seymour, okay.\n\n135\n00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:24.796\nNow there's a lot of\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n136\n00:07:24.796 --> 00:07:31.161\nSome people feel very comfortable doing\nwhat's called the subclip method.\n\n137\n00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:35.028\nA lot of people that might be doing\ndocumentaries or you just roll your\n\n138\n00:07:35.028 --> 00:07:39.550\ncamera, you might say I wish I had a lot\nof little clips of this big thing.\n\n139\n00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.520\nThis is sort of an organizational thing.\n\n140\n00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.200\nYou don't have to do this.\n\n141\n00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.980\nI'm going to do it a different\nway with another clip later.\n\n142\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.935\nBut what I can do is down here,\nin this bar,\n\n143\n00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:57.286\nI have all these different\ntools that I can use in here.\n\n144\n00:07:57.286 --> 00:08:01.045\nOne is called Mark In and\none is called Mark Out.\n\n145\n00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:07.322\nAnd what I'm doing is I am defining a\nsegment That I want to use in my timeline.\n\n146\n00:08:07.322 --> 00:08:09.410\nCuz I'm not gonna use all of this.\n\n147\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.694\nSo let me just play forward with L.\n\n148\n00:08:12.434 --> 00:08:13.650\nAnd I can do these on the fly.\n\n149\n00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.100\nI can say I want that there.\n\n150\n00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.013\n&gt;&gt;

Okay.\n\n254\n00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nright now this is telling me if I do that,\n\n255\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.620\nokay, let me zoom in a little bit,\nit's telling me select camera.\n\n256\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.740\nWhat does that mean?\n\n257\n00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.250\nWhen we get into multicam\nyou'll be able to see that.\n\n258\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.030\nBut it's like,\nI wanna I kind of want to change that.\n\n259\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.160\nSo what I can do, is I can come down to\nthis find here, and I can say one, okay?\n\n260\n00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.680\nAnd it'll say okay.\n\n261\n00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.880\nProject is shift plus one.\n\n262\n00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.947\nI'm just scrolling through\nuntil I find it, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:41.657 --> 00:13:46.722\nThis is one of the things that we\nall kind of, we don't find real\n\n264\n00:13:46.722 --> 00:13:53.550\ngroovy about this is that what happens is,\nit often gets really hard to find.\n\n265\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:58.900\nAdobe is great, but sometimes it's like,\n\n266\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.725\nyeah, you're like the kid\nthat tried too hard.\n\n267\n00:14:01.725 --> 00:14:03.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like you did too much\n\n268\n00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.980\nextra credit.\n\n269\n00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:11.310\nSo in this case I'm going to say\nselect and use that as my term.\n\n270\n00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.290\nAnd there's selection tool.\n\n271\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.240\n&gt;&gt; Because you're looking for select\ncamera that is mapped to number one.\n\n272\n00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.055\nAnd the one is probably associated with\nquite a few other things [CROSSTALK]\n\n273\n00:14:20.055 --> 00:14:23.330\n&gt;&gt; It's associated with so many things.\n\n274\n00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.187\nAnd this is, if you enjoy doing this,\nthis can be very fun.\n\n275\n00:14:27.187 --> 00:14:30.415\nIf you don't enjoy doing this,\nthis can be awful.\n\n276\n00:14:30.415 --> 00:14:32.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, those of us are like yeah,\n\n277\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.580\nwe want to find all this, and\ndo all this, and that's great.\n\n278\n00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.800\n&gt;&gt; But what you're looking for is\nthe command that's already mapped to that\n\n279\n00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.870\nparticular shortcut So\nthen you can override it.\n\n280\n00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.435\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the thing is,\nthis is where this is a great guide.\n\n281\n00:14:45.435 --> 00:14:47.270\nCuz I had a friend tell me,\nwell, I can't find that.\n\n282\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.540\nIt's like have you tried this?\n\n283\n00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.155\nHave you tried holding down\nthe command key to see what it means?\n\n284\n00:14:54.155 --> 00:14:57.724\nCuz remember, earlier when I was\ndoing that, I would hold it.\n\n285\n00:14:59.907 --> 00:15:00.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n286\n00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.460\n&gt;&gt; This is a bug.\n\n287\n00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n288\n00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.940\n&gt;&gt; See, technically,\n\n289\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.039\nif I'm holding command, it should say-\n&gt;&gt;

They looked the exact same way,\nthe exact same icon.\n\n440\n00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.710\n&gt;&gt; But it's a different panel.\n\n441\n00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:44.980\nAnd Adobe going to different panels means\ncertain things do things very differently.\n\n442\n00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.236\nIn this case,\nlet's say he was a Photoshop person,\n\n443\n00:22:49.236 --> 00:22:55.670\nI asked you to make a poster for\nthis show, and you said, great.\n\n444\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.582\nGive me that screenshot.\n\n445\n00:22:57.582 --> 00:23:02.070\nI would say okay and\nI would go to export frame.\n\n446\n00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.166\nAnd it is now going to export this frame.\n\n447\n00:23:06.166 --> 00:23:09.239\nAnd I would say what\nfile type would you like?\n\n448\n00:23:09.239 --> 00:23:10.307\nUsually if it's a DPX,\n\n449\n00:23:10.307 --> 00:23:13.631\nit's somebody that wants to do some\nadvanced color correction, a JPEG.\n\n450\n00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:16.130\nKnowing you, you're probably\ngoing to say I need a TIFF.\n\n451\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.060\nGive me a full blown TIFF of this.\n\n452\n00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:25.053\nOkay, the path means when I send\nit where is it going to go.\n\n453\n00:23:25.053 --> 00:23:26.470\nAnd then I can see.\n\n454\n00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.120\nIt takes me out to the finder and\nwhere it will go.\n\n455\n00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.180\nThis last thing here I\nwant to show that's very,\n\n456\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.240\nvery convenient, it's Import into project.\n\n457\n00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.980\nLet's say that I did want\nto make a bunch of stills.\n\n458\n00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.550\nOften something in it,\nmaybe create a montage.\n\n459\n00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.260\nThat means I have to bring\nit back into the project.\n\n460\n00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.077\nIt used to be which you had to do,\nyou exported them then you had to go to\n\n461\n00:23:51.077 --> 00:23:53.183\nthe finder, find them again and\nre-import them.\n\n462\n00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:57.399\nThis will just say and\nI'm going to go ahead and do this,\n\n463\n00:23:57.399 --> 00:24:00.270\nimport it back into the project.\n\n464\n00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.167\nBoom.\n\n465\n00:24:01.167 --> 00:24:03.148\nAnd there it is.\n\n466\n00:24:03.148 --> 00:24:03.776\nAnd this tells me, yeah.\n\n467\n00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:04.933\n&gt;&gt; It's your still, okay.\n\n468\n00:24:04.933 --> 00:24:09.900\n&gt;&gt; It tells me it's a still image,\nboom, even has an alpha channel.\n\n469\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.062\nBecause of the way this camera works,\n\n470\n00:24:14.062 --> 00:24:17.642\nit's gotta build an alpha channel,\nso kinda crazy.\n\n471\n00:24:17.642 --> 00:24:18.452\n&gt;&gt; That's handy, yeah.\n\n472\n00:24:18.452 --> 00:24:20.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very handy.\n\n473\n00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.380\nLet me also show you something\nabout the proxy thing.\n\n474\n00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.760\nIf I did this with the proxy, and\nI'm gonna give it a different name.\n\n475\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.690\nThere's my phone number, great.\n\n476\n00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.300\nCuz you know why it's on there?\n\n477\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.302\nAll of this metadata is\nattached to the name.\n\n478\n00:24:37.302 --> 00:24:38.593\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you took it on your phone.\n\n479\n00:24:38.593 --> 00:24:40.010\n&gt;&gt; No, this isn't a black magic.\n\n480\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.180\nI put it in the actual high end camera.\n\n481\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.782\nAnd it did that, so it's all attached.\n\n482\n00:24:45.782 --> 00:24:49.015\nI'm just gonna say O2,\nImport back in the project &gt; OK.\n\n483\n00:24:49.015 --> 00:24:53.150\nIt's the same thing.\n\n484\n00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.259\nNotice it did it at the 1920x1080.\n\n485\n00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:57.820\nIt didn't do it at the proxy resolution.\n\n486\n00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.510\nSo a lot of people get scared of that.\n\n487\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.060\nIt's like, no, it's gonna do, yeah.\n\n488\n00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.310\nSo it didn't do the proxy resolution.\n\n489\n00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.360\n&gt;&gt; It's the default from the master file,\nthe master clip.\n\n490\n00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.890\n&gt;&gt; It's the default, yep, mm-hm, yep.\n\n491\n00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:09.794\nSo there you go.\n\n492\n00:25:09.794 --> 00:25:10.357\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n493\n00:25:10.357 --> 00:25:10.957\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n494\n00:25:10.957 --> 00:25:13.198\n&gt;&gt; But that can be very confusing,\nsame icon.\n\n495\n00:25:13.198 --> 00:25:14.229\n&gt;&gt; It can.\n\n496\n00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:17.271\n&gt;&gt; But it does very different things,\nit's similar.\n\n497\n00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:18.507\n&gt;&gt; It does very different things, yeah.\n\n498\n00:25:18.507 --> 00:25:20.041\n&gt;&gt; But it's different.\n\n499\n00:25:20.041 --> 00:25:26.190\n&gt;&gt; So what we're going to do is\nnotice we're still on the right side.\n\n500\n00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.580\nI'm going to take a segment of this.\n\n501\n00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.570\nFrom here right when he looks up.\n\n502\n00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.939\n&gt;&gt; Wait, we're on the left side, right?\n\n503\n00:25:34.939 --> 00:25:35.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're on the left side.\n\n504\n00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.438\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sorry.\n\n505\n00:25:36.438 --> 00:25:38.295\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, no, I do that all the time.\n\n506\n00:25:38.295 --> 00:25:41.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm just making sure cuz\nI'm one of those like, okay, wait,\n\n507\n00:25:41.556 --> 00:25:42.545\nwhat side are we on?\n\n508\n00:25:42.545 --> 00:25:43.570\n&gt;&gt; We're on the left side.\n\n509\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:44.684\nNo, I do that all the time sorry, okay?\n\n510\n00:25:44.684 --> 00:25:47.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right versus correct, is that-\n\n511\n00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:53.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so right versus correct, so yeah.\n\n512\n00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.797\nYeah, cats.\n[LAUGH]\n\n513\n00:25:54.797 --> 00:25:55.762\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n514\n00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:56.833\n&gt;&gt; So there we go.\n\n515\n00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:58.150\nI screwed up.\n\n516\n00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:03.850\nI wanted to hit O for out point,\nbut I hit I for in point.\n\n517\n00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.123\nSo what happens when things go wrong?\n\n518\n00:26:06.123 --> 00:26:08.489\nCmd+Z.\n\n519\n00:26:08.489 --> 00:26:10.304\n&gt;&gt; Of course, Undo.\n\n520\n00:26:10.304 --> 00:26:13.069\n&gt;&gt; Right, Undo, and\nthere's many levels of that.\n\n521\n00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:17.016\nBut there's another thing that you\nare used to in Photoshop that is\n\n522\n00:26:17.016 --> 00:26:18.080\navailable here.\n\n523\n00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.713\nThere is a history.\n\n524\n00:26:20.713 --> 00:26:24.776\nIt's found in the project panel and\nyou can go back in the history as well.\n\n525\n00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:25.484\n&gt;&gt; Nice, okay.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n526\n00:26:25.484 --> 00:26:30.285\nthat was specifically added because a lot\nof people who aren't editors are going\n\n527\n00:26:30.285 --> 00:26:31.250\ninto this now.\n\n528\n00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.456\nBut they've worked in Photoshop.\n\n529\n00:26:32.456 --> 00:26:33.667\nThey've worked in Illustrator.\n\n530\n00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:35.631\nAnd they've worked in other things like,\nwhere's my history?\n\n531\n00:26:35.631 --> 00:26:36.867\n&gt;&gt; So it wasn't always in there.\n\n532\n00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:39.490\n&gt;&gt; No, so it's like where is my history?\n\n533\n00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:44.338\nAnd all of us that made it was like,\nyeah, that'd actually be great.\n\n534\n00:26:44.338 --> 00:26:47.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'll drop an out point.\n\n535\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.530\nI'm just gonna use O.\n\n536\n00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.202\nCome here, O.\n\n537\n00:26:51.202 --> 00:26:53.303\nNow over here,\n\n538\n00:26:56.174 --> 00:27:01.850\nThere's this thing called drop media\nhere to create sequence in the timeline.\n\n539\n00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.640\nJust drop it there.\n\n540\n00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.264\nThis is the easiest form of an edit.\n\n541\n00:27:06.264 --> 00:27:10.543\nAnd we're gonna get into more\nelaborate ones in the next.\n\n542\n00:27:10.543 --> 00:27:13.516\nBut if I take this icon right here,\n\n543\n00:27:13.516 --> 00:27:18.757\nthe one that just says drag video,\nand I drag it right there.\n\n544\n00:27:18.757 --> 00:27:25.400\nBoom, I have created a sequence.\n\n545\n00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.265\nAnd now what I'm using\nin here are segments.\n\n546\n00:27:27.265 --> 00:27:29.570\nLet me show you.\n\n547\n00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.580\nThere it is,\nthere's the little guy right there.\n\n548\n00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.680\nStretch it out.\n\n549\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.030\n&gt;&gt; Now we're going to the right side.\n\n550\n00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:37.900\n&gt;&gt; We're going to the right side.\n\n551\n00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.260\nWe're going from left to right.\n\n552\n00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.365\nSo we've made a magic transform,\nI hate that word.\n\n553\n00:27:41.365 --> 00:27:41.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But no,\n\n554\n00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:46.350\nwe've transformed it into a timeline.\n\n555\n00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.710\nAnd this is what the audience\nis going to see.\n\n556\n00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.760\nAnd there it is right there.\n\n557\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.980\n&gt;&gt; And you drag that from\nthe Source Monitor down into-\n\n558\n00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.850\n&gt;&gt; Straight into the timeline.\n\n559\n00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:56.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n560\n00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.990\n&gt;&gt; That's the simplest way to do it.\n\n561\n00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:05.510\nThere are many other methods that we're\ngonna explore in the next lesson.\n\n562\n00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:10.690\nBut honestly, if I just do this,\nI'm gonna resize this a little bit.\n\n563\n00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:13.289\nAnd notice I can resize\nthis all over the place.\n\n564\n00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.480\nOkay, squish, squish cuz I don't\nreally need anything out there.\n\n565\n00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.010\nThere it is.\n\n566\n00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.006\nNow if I just move this\nplay head right there.\n\n567\n00:28:21.006 --> 00:28:22.857\nAnd I go get another clip.\n\n568\n00:28:22.857 --> 00:28:26.760\nLet's go get another one.\n\n569\n00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.770\nThere's Seymour again.\n\n570\n00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.580\nHe loves tomatoes.\n\n571\n00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.810\nGo through there, boom.\n\n572\n00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.050\nAnd then just drag that\nright to the end of it.\n\n573\n00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:36.710\nBoom, now I'm creating a movie.\n\n574\n00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.190\nBoom, cat,\nthere's Seymour eating the tomato.\n\n575\n00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.600\nHere's the interesting part.\n\n576\n00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.710\nWhy does that look so big?\n\n577\n00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.530\nThat doesn't look like that.\n\n578\n00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:48.250\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't.\n\n579\n00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.750\n&gt;&gt; So when we come back for the next\nlesson, you're gonna find out why.\n\n580\n00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.250\nWhy I did this.\n\n581\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.810\nHow to make these changes.\n\n582\n00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.756\nAnd when most people figure this out,\n\n583\n00:28:58.756 --> 00:29:03.910\nwhat I can drag out of the center and\ngo here and get this crazy menu,\n\n584\n00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:08.750\nthey never go back to dragging\nit straight to the timeline.\n\n585\n00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.390\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I am very intrigued right now.\n\n586\n00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.523\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's fun.\n\n587\n00:29:12.523 --> 00:29:13.231\nIt is fun.\n\n588\n00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:16.396\nI do a lot of hotkey editing\nbecause I work very fast.\n\n589\n00:29:16.396 --> 00:29:20.428\nBut I will tell you, there are times that\nI will just sit there and I'll do this and\n\n590\n00:29:20.428 --> 00:29:21.820\nI will be just as happy.\n\n591\n00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I will be just as happy depending\n\n592\n00:29:24.015 --> 00:29:25.230\non what I'm working on.\n\n593\n00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.082\nIf I'm working on a narrative,\nwhere I have two people in conversation,\n\n594\n00:29:28.082 --> 00:29:29.420\nI'm probably gonna use hotkeys.\n\n595\n00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.490\nBut if I'm doing something where\nit's like, wanna get this done,\n\n596\n00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.650\nhave a little fun with it,\nI'm gonna do that drag this time.\n\n597\n00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.130\n&gt;&gt; The drag and drop, wow.\n\n598\n00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.520\nSo the left to right,\nwe've been concentrating left.\n\n599\n00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.228\n&gt;&gt; Left to right, yeah.\n\n600\n00:29:39.228 --> 00:29:41.390\n&gt;&gt; I'm always equating it-\n&gt;&gt; We're moving to the right, yeah.\n\n601\n00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.516\n&gt;&gt; I'm equating it like a play,\nlike we're in the backstage.\n\n602\n00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:46.960\nSo the left hand side is\nwe're behind the scenes,\n\n603\n00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.530\nwe're behind the curtain,\ngetting the actors ready.\n\n604\n00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.771\nAnd then we're taking the actors and say,\nokay, I got you in your right costume and\n\n605\n00:29:52.771 --> 00:29:54.060\nyou're in the right place.\n\n606\n00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.810\nBoom, put you out onto the stage.\n\n607\n00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:01.510\n&gt;&gt; You're the actor behind the stage,\nbut on the stage, you're the character.\n\n608\n00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.542\nAnd that's exactly it.\n\n609\n00:30:02.542 --> 00:30:04.045\nIt's what you just said.\n\n610\n00:30:04.045 --> 00:30:04.708\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, no,\nthat's fantastic, though.\n\n611\n00:30:04.708 --> 00:30:05.508\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying, yeah.\n\n612\n00:30:05.508 --> 00:30:07.098\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe've got people on the Source Monitor.\n\n613\n00:30:07.098 --> 00:30:09.063\n&gt;&gt; I'm just repeating what you\nsaid just to try and look smart.\n\n614\n00:30:09.063 --> 00:30:11.388\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying so hard.\n\n615\n00:30:11.388 --> 00:30:12.292\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n616\n00:30:12.292 --> 00:30:14.440\njust different correlations\nto different people.\n\n617\n00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.989\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; That's the way my brain's going.\n\n618\n00:30:15.989 --> 00:30:20.690\nSo I'm just making sure that I'm\non the right page with the script.\n\n619\n00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.940\nSo, all right, well, thank you so\nmuch for explaining the Source Monitor.\n\n620\n00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.714\nAnd I'm very curious as to where\nwe're going next with this timeline.\n\n621\n00:30:26.714 --> 00:30:29.678\nAnd I don't wanna see the whole\nSeymour and the tomatoes.\n\n622\n00:30:29.678 --> 00:30:32.507\nAnd it looks like, Seymour is saying, hey,\n\n623\n00:30:32.507 --> 00:30:35.950\nthere's somebody eating\nthose tomatoes over there.\n\n624\n00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:36.896\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n625\n00:30:36.896 --> 00:30:38.621\n&gt;&gt; See, we're gonna talk a little\nbit about that editing theory\n\n626\n00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:39.340\nwhen we come back.\n\n627\n00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.530\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well, I can't wait.\n\n628\n00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.409\nSo well then we'll go ahead and\nsign off for this episode and\n\n629\n00:30:43.409 --> 00:30:45.665\nwe'll be coming back\nwith more very shortly.\n\n630\n00:30:45.665 --> 00:30:49.400\nSo, for right now, signing off for\nCreativeProTV, I'm your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n631\n00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.390\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, you gotta catch yourself.\n\n9\n00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:30.423\n&gt;&gt; Gotta keep on score that we're in 2017.\n\n10\n00:00:30.423 --> 00:00:31.660\nThat's the year we're in.\n\n11\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.402\n[LAUGH] So here to help me keep\nmyself in check about what year we're\n\n12\n00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:38.870\nactually in is Mr. Jim Biddle.\n\n13\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.910\nWelcome back.\n\n14\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.540\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad we're both here,\n\n15\n00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.850\ncuz I'm gonna clear up some stuff that\nI've done in the last few episodes.\n\n16\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.770\nBecause this happens, okay, it happens.\n\n17\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.060\nWhy?\nBecause you get to working with this and\n\n18\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.030\nyou get convinced of something,\nyou do this.\n\n19\n00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.052\nBelieve me,\nI do this on purpose, actually.\n\n20\n00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:57.720\nWe're gonna go back to\nthe keyboard real quick.\n\n21\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.380\nAnd I wanna show you something, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.608\nFirst of all,\nnotice I have the ability to say,\n\n23\n00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:11.244\nwhat keyboard or\nwhat command area am I looking at?\n\n24\n00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:14.743\nSo right now,\nI'm looking at the entire application.\n\n25\n00:01:14.743 --> 00:01:20.195\nBut if I say, I'm going to look\nat the Legacy Title Panel,\n\n26\n00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:26.580\nthat's where you say, oo,\nL just doesn't mean shuttle right.\n\n27\n00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.970\nIn this panel, it means this.\n\n28\n00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.990\nSo that's where a lot\nof people get confused.\n\n29\n00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.970\n&gt;&gt; And that's when we were trying so\nhard to look at all of those commands.\n\n30\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.310\nWe were looking for the L and\nit's going through every single one.\n\n31\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.047\nAnd we're trying all these arrays.\n\n32\n00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:40.691\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n33\n00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:45.213\n&gt;&gt; If we would've just went up there and\nsaid, let's talk about the source monitor,\n\n34\n00:01:45.213 --> 00:01:46.259\nthen, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.115\n&gt;&gt; And the other thing was,\nI got my symbols mixed up,\n\n36\n00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:52.276\nwhich happens all the time.\n\n37\n00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:54.676\nThat is actually Shift.\n\n38\n00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:57.180\nThe arrow going up is Shift.\n\n39\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.330\nSo guess what?\n\n40\n00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.040\nWhat was a bug at one point in Adobe,\nisn't a bug anymore.\n\n41\n00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.207\n&gt;&gt; It's Shift 1, 2, 3, 4 and all of that.\n\n42\n00:02:07.207 --> 00:02:08.753\nI kept thinking Command.\n\n43\n00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:11.149\n&gt;&gt; Okay I-\n&gt;&gt; It was Shift.\n\n44\n00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:13.912\n&gt;&gt; I'm a bilingual as I call it,\nI'm Mac and PC.\n\n45\n00:02:13.912 --> 00:02:16.913\nBut there's so many times where\nI was like, I can't remember,\n\n46\n00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:20.546\nit's the little thing that looks like\nthis and there's little dots on it or-\n\n47\n00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.494\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we all run into that.\n\n48\n00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:25.586\nYou're so convinced, and the thing\nis I'm going off of muscle memory,\n\n49\n00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:28.184\nI'm thinking I'm hitting Command and\nI'm hitting Shift.\n\n50\n00:02:28.184 --> 00:02:30.136\nAnd that's the thing,\nit's like, I [INAUDIBLE].\n\n51\n00:02:30.136 --> 00:02:31.842\nYou're going to experience this.\n\n52\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:35.530\nYou're going to experience this that\nyou're doing things you're thinking it's\n\n53\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.310\nthis but\nyou already know it's the other thing.\n\n54\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.736\n&gt;&gt; I do this.\nI have a whole other\n\n55\n00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:44.565\nlayer where I'm actually in a virtual\nmachine on a Windows machine on my Mac.\n\n56\n00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:47.532\nBut then there's the Control and Command\nthat do different things and I'm like,\n\n57\n00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:48.485\nwait whoops, wrong one.\n\n58\n00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:51.970\nAnd it can get you all turned around and\nsidewards.\n\n59\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.401\nSidewards and backwards, yes.\n\n60\n00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:55.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sidewards and\nbackwards, I'm telling you.\n\n61\n00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.840\nSo now, if I do source and come down here,\nI will find it under Shift+2.\n\n62\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.840\nAnd yeah, I can get rid of that and\njust make it two, okay, so I can do that.\n\n63\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.530\nBut we get so convinced of stuff, and\nI'm just like, I know it's Command.\n\n64\n00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.200\nAnd then I watched myself hit it,\nI'm like, it's Shift.\n\n65\n00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.010\nBecause I do it so much.\n\n66\n00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.045\nSo here's the interesting thing,\nwe talked about, hi kitty, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:25.120\nSo this is, believe it or\nnot there's two different Seymours.\n\n68\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.060\nThis is puppet Seymour, he's actually the\nstar of a movie one of my students made.\n\n69\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.930\nHe's a psychic cat that helps a detective,\nand I got him in the kickstarter campaign.\n\n70\n00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.700\nAnd this is, I have no idea what my\nneighbor's cat name actually is, so\n\n71\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.920\nI just call him Seymour.\n\n72\n00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.050\nSo what you're gonna notice is when we\ndid this edit, it only brought video.\n\n73\n00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.500\nBecause when I did the drag,\nthis means bring video only.\n\n74\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.740\nThis means drag audio only.\n\n75\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.690\n&gt;&gt; It separates it out.\n\n76\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, so it's like, there's bad\naudio on this, I didn't want that.\n\n77\n00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.622\nSo, how do I rectify that problem?\n\n78\n00:04:02.622 --> 00:04:05.109\nWell, there's an advanced way\nthat I will show at another time.\n\n79\n00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.246\nBut the easiest way is I'll just\ngo back and find him again, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:09.246 --> 00:04:10.045\nThat's him,\n\n81\n00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:14.580\nand instead of dragging from one of these,\nI can drag straight out of the center.\n\n82\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.955\n&gt;&gt; From the preview?\n\n83\n00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.321\n&gt;&gt; Yep, boom, right there and there it is.\n\n84\n00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:21.231\nSo now let me make this big, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:22.863\nGotta use Matilda.\n\n86\n00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:25.472\nSame thing, so\nnow there's the audio, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:25.472 --> 00:04:26.590\nNow there is the audio.\n\n88\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.960\nI just hit Cmd + Z, all right?\n\n89\n00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.310\nIf I, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n90\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.588\nthe audio goes on its own,\nwhat I'm thinking of is, layer.\n\n91\n00:04:34.588 --> 00:04:36.368\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these are tracks, yeah.\n\n92\n00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:38.580\n&gt;&gt; Tracks.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk about that, and\n\n93\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.540\nthese are tracks.\n\n94\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.430\nSo when I created this sequence just\nby dragging media into it, okay,\n\n95\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.020\nit gave me, as a default,\nthree video tracks and three audio tracks.\n\n96\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.920\nNow this is why left and\nright so important.\n\n97\n00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.930\nNotice I have a video 1 and\nan A1 here and then all of these.\n\n98\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.780\nThese represent the right side or\nthe timeline program side.\n\n99\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.269\nThis represents the source.\n\n100\n00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:15.867\nSo the source can only have\nwhat you shot on your camera.\n\n101\n00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:21.160\nA sequence can have 24 tracks of video.\n\n102\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.660\nIt could probably have more these days,\n\n103\n00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.820\nand lots of tracks of audio to\nmanipulate things within the timeline.\n\n104\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.165\nYour source clip is what you've got,\nall right?\n\n105\n00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:34.170\nThis'll come into play in a minute, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.550\nSo, I'm gonna get rid of\nthis one of Seymour here.\n\n107\n00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.020\nIf I just highlight it quickly and\nthen hit Delete, it's gone.\n\n108\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.180\nSo I liked what you said earlier.\n\n109\n00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.320\nIt's like he's trying to warn me about\npuppet Seymour taking tomatoes, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.541\nSo, if I come back to this one and\ndo my Shift to and go, there he is, okay?\n\n111\n00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.187\nThere he is, that rascal.\n\n112\n00:05:58.187 --> 00:06:02.900\nNow, I don't want that at the end.\n\n113\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.210\nThis is where I'm starting\nto create this story.\n\n114\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.913\nHere he is, he taps me.\n\n115\n00:06:10.913 --> 00:06:17.132\nAnd he looks up at me, and then maybe\nwe wanna cut to him doing the tomatoes.\n\n116\n00:06:17.132 --> 00:06:20.870\nAnd then it comes back at him\nscreaming at me like, you're a moron.\n\n117\n00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.550\nSo if the play head is located here,\nokay, and\n\n118\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.790\nI have an in point and out point,\n\n119\n00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.670\nthe in point is going to go right\nwhere at the play head is and\n\n120\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.889\nwill take as much to the out point, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.634\nIf I drag like this,\nthis is gonna be interesting.\n\n122\n00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:46.783\nI'm gonna have to do a little zoom here,\ndrag out at the center, come here.\n\n123\n00:06:46.783 --> 00:06:52.596\nNow, there's a symbol, it's blue, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:52.596 --> 00:06:58.240\nIt's a little blue arrow and\ntwo little lines.\n\n125\n00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.502\nThis is telling me I'm about\nto perform an overwrite.\n\n126\n00:07:01.502 --> 00:07:02.415\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're hovering,\n\n127\n00:07:02.415 --> 00:07:05.161\nyou're actually dropping it on top\nof the clip that's already there.\n\n128\n00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:09.427\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm overwriting what's there, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:15.140\nNow, I could hold down the Command key and\nI get this series of arrows.\n\n130\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.540\nThis would be an insert.\n\n131\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.150\nA lot of people who do editing think they\nneed to take something like a blade tool\n\n132\n00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.070\nand make a cut, pull things apart,\nand then drop it in.\n\n133\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.144\nAll I have to do is hold down\nthat Command key and let go.\n\n134\n00:07:30.144 --> 00:07:32.117\n&gt;&gt; And it put it in between those-\n&gt;&gt; Put it in between.\n\n135\n00:07:32.117 --> 00:07:34.358\n&gt;&gt; Cuz honestly,\nthat's what I was thinking.\n\n136\n00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:35.060\nI'm like, well, wait.\n\n137\n00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.834\nAren't you gonna have to slice it out?\n\n138\n00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:40.212\nTake this part where he's tapping, put\nthat in its own layer, then take this and\n\n139\n00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:41.215\nput it in its own layer.\n\n140\n00:07:41.215 --> 00:07:41.892\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n141\n00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:43.949\nthat was my thought process\nas I was going along.\n\n142\n00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:48.509\n&gt;&gt; In college, when I edited my final\nproject with a couple other people,\n\n143\n00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:53.690\nI had to physically cut film,\ndrop something, resize it, trim it down.\n\n144\n00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.694\nNot in this case.\n\n145\n00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:58.172\nIf you just tell it that this is\nan insert, so now if I play it.\n\n146\n00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:02.823\n&gt;&gt; He taps And then, okay.\n\n147\n00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:08.705\n&gt;&gt; But it's the next frame of\nwhere it would've continued\n\n148\n00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:10.409\n&gt;&gt; It's not overwriting [CROSSTALK].\n\n149\n00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:13.440\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's not overwriting it.\n\n150\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.840\n&gt;&gt; It's right from when he tapped,\nthe very same.\n\n151\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.792\nAnd then you put the little thing\nbetween it where it's eating the tomato.\n\n152\n00:08:17.792 --> 00:08:22.710\n&gt;&gt; It's like it made a cut, pushed it\ndown the length of what it needed, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.987\nIf I do the overwrite, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:26.630\n&gt;&gt; And that was because you\nheld down the Command key.\n\n155\n00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.632\n&gt;&gt; Command key.\n\n156\n00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:30.040\n&gt;&gt; While you were-\n&gt;&gt; And notice it gives me a nice guide.\n\n157\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.095\nIf I take it right to the play head here.\n\n158\n00:08:34.095 --> 00:08:35.400\nActually I think I wanna move that back.\n\n159\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.870\nAnd you'll notice in the top\nscreen it's gonna tell me-\n\n160\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.083\n&gt;&gt; You can see where it's scrubbing to\n\n161\n00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:39.737\nwhere you want it.\n\n162\n00:08:39.737 --> 00:08:41.928\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like,\nthat's where it's gonna cut in, and\n\n163\n00:08:41.928 --> 00:08:44.250\nthen that's where it's gonna cut out.\n\n164\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:49.560\nOkay, so again if I hold the command key\nthere is a little icon that shows me,\n\n165\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.460\nnow you're in insert.\n\n166\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.944\nNow if I do overwrite, boom.\n\n167\n00:08:53.944 --> 00:08:55.753\nLet me come back.\n\n168\n00:09:01.926 --> 00:09:04.412\nOkay, so it's continuous.\n\n169\n00:09:04.412 --> 00:09:08.910\nThe action is continuous in that sense,\nall right?\n\n170\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.551\nSo those are pretty much the two\nedits that I can do to get it\n\n171\n00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:15.213\nfrom left to right.\n\n172\n00:09:15.213 --> 00:09:19.920\nNow, I am not the biggest fan of drag and\ndrop editing.\n\n173\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.840\nI don't really, I don't dig it.\n\n174\n00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.390\nNot in this sense.\n\n175\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.940\nBut watch this,\nI'm gonna make this screen bigger.\n\n176\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.974\nI'm gonna do one of the exact same\nthings that I just did, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:38.170\nBut what I'm gonna do with it is this.\n\n178\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.200\nI'm gonna drag from the center,\nand drag over here.\n\n179\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.710\n&gt;&gt; You had alluded to that\nspace of coming [INAUDIBLE].\n\n180\n00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:49.590\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh and\nit gives me all of these options, okay?\n\n181\n00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.509\nSo let me make this window a bit bigger,\nokay?\n\n182\n00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:56.670\nPanel, panel window, drag it over.\n\n183\n00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.000\nAnd these are the options, insert before.\n\n184\n00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.135\nSo if there's two shots in\nneeds to go in the front, so\n\n185\n00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:06.426\nbasic one to is gonna put it\nat the beginning of the shot.\n\n186\n00:10:06.426 --> 00:10:07.765\nThis will put it at the end of the shot.\n\n187\n00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:11.307\nHere's Insert, here's Overwrite.\n\n188\n00:10:11.307 --> 00:10:15.519\nWe have a thing called Replace,\nwhich we'll talk about later,\n\n189\n00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.165\nwhich I live on Replace.\n\n190\n00:10:17.165 --> 00:10:18.940\nAnd then there's a thing called Overlay.\n\n191\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:26.550\nMore people feel a little bit more\nconfident in Overlay because of this,\n\n192\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.551\nif I do Overlay, boom.\n\n193\n00:10:31.453 --> 00:10:35.960\nThat's what happens,\nis it places it over the top.\n\n194\n00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.565\nAnd this is more like layers\nthat you're used to, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:40.110\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking that.\n\n196\n00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.500\nBecause you wanna put things in layers,\nbut you don't wanna delete or\n\n197\n00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.820\nfully manipulate something in one layer,\ncuz that's the beauty of the program.\n\n198\n00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.320\n&gt;&gt; And\na lot of us call it checkerboarding.\n\n199\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.280\nBecause in many ways in editing\nyou don't need to do that.\n\n200\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.660\nBecause what people get afraid of is like,\n\n201\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.250\nwell if I put that here I can't reconnect\nthis or I can't move this shot.\n\n202\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.080\nYou actually can and Adobe makes some\nvery great ways for you to do that.\n\n203\n00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.470\nBut if you feel more comfortable just\ngrabbing it and moving it this way.\n\n204\n00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.390\nThat's fine.\n\n205\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.320\nI feel that it is a disadvantage\nif I do it this way.\n\n206\n00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.280\nI don't get that two up display\nhere to make that happen.\n\n207\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.134\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz then you're only working within\n\n208\n00:11:21.134 --> 00:11:21.966\nthat layer.\n\n209\n00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:26.209\nAnd so it's moving it and you can't see it\nin relationship to the other layer that's\n\n210\n00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:28.498\nunderneath it which is\nreally a whole story.\n\n211\n00:11:28.498 --> 00:11:30.600\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna let you call it\nlayer even though it's tracks.\n\n212\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.977\nBecause a lot of people-\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\n\n213\n00:11:31.977 --> 00:11:32.818\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's okay.\n\n214\n00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:34.670\nA lot of people come out here and\nthey call it layers.\n\n215\n00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.480\nIt's just fine.\n\n216\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:41.020\nBecause the thing is for video, because\nit's pixels, they interact like layers.\n\n217\n00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:41.950\nSo you have blend mode.\n\n218\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.810\nYou do have blends modes,\nwhere as an audio it's a mix.\n\n219\n00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.610\nSo when you add audio,\nyou add power and you must mix things.\n\n220\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:56.160\nWhere yes, in many questions when you\nstack things on top in tracks in video,\n\n221\n00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.430\nit's like working with layers.\n\n222\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.520\nYou will have blend modes and\nother such things.\n\n223\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.770\nSo now you might say well what\nif you don't want the audio?\n\n224\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.050\nAll I have to do, and there are gonna\nbe some people gravitating from\n\n225\n00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.930\nother edit systems,\nwhere they will find this a little weird.\n\n226\n00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:20.000\nThese right here,\nthe tracks sort of act like train tracks.\n\n227\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.260\nWhen I am moving from left to right,\nnotice they're blue.\n\n228\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.457\nIf it's blue, it's active, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:31.457 --> 00:12:35.440\nAll I have to do is turn\noff the source side.\n\n230\n00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.250\nAnything on the source side\nis what I need to manipulate.\n\n231\n00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.200\nI don't have to manipulate anything\non the right side when I'm editing,\n\n232\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.050\nonly on the left side.\n\n233\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:52.202\nSo now if I do this exact same thing, No\n\n234\n00:12:52.202 --> 00:12:56.057\naudio because I said\ndon't bring any audio.\n\n235\n00:12:56.057 --> 00:12:59.294\nI said don't bring any audio.\n\n236\n00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:00.161\n&gt;&gt; It's a toggle.\n\n237\n00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:02.911\nYou're toggling on [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, toggling on, toggling off,\n\n238\n00:13:02.911 --> 00:13:04.810\nit's like train tracks.\n\n239\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.800\nThis train is closed.\n\n240\n00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.660\nThis one goes through and\nthis one's the other.\n\n241\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.112\nNow here's something\na little more advanced,\n\n242\n00:13:10.112 --> 00:13:11.137\ncuz this is gonna be pretty cool.\n\n243\n00:13:15.219 --> 00:13:20.130\nThe thing that keeps it consistent is\nwe're using the audio from this shot.\n\n244\n00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.950\nIt's not like we cut from\none audio to another.\n\n245\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.901\nWe can cut from one video to another,\nand we have because of editing theory.\n\n246\n00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:31.150\nImages colliding when\nwe put things together.\n\n247\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.560\nIf we have audio from two separate areas,\n\n248\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.720\npeople can immediately tell in their\nears that something has gone wrong.\n\n249\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.043\n&gt;&gt; And I actually heard it,\nthere was like some chirping going on.\n\n250\n00:13:41.043 --> 00:13:43.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's some chirping,\nhe's got chirping and stuff.\n\n251\n00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.476\nThis was at a much different time and\nday than this one.\n\n252\n00:13:47.476 --> 00:13:49.530\nAnd it's like,\nI just wanna keep the consistent audio on.\n\n253\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.290\nThat's why occasionally we\nonly take the video for\n\n254\n00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.350\nwhat we would call a b roll or\na reaction shot, or a jump shot.\n\n255\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.799\n&gt;&gt; And keeping the audio\nfrom the other one, yeah.\n\n256\n00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:00.881\n&gt;&gt; Right, I tell a lot of people,\n\n257\n00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:07.050\nif your video looks weird,\npeople will call it art.\n\n258\n00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.993\nIf your audio is bad,\nyou're terrible at what you do.\n\n259\n00:14:10.993 --> 00:14:12.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean that's just it.\n\n260\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.150\nThat's the way it works.\n\n261\n00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.760\nSo now here's something that's\na little more advanced.\n\n262\n00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.960\nCuz a lot of people will ask me this.\n\n263\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.380\nWe'll both say, well this is nice and all.\n\n264\n00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.630\nI'm gonna go ahead and get rid of just\nby clicking it and hitting delete.\n\n265\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.830\nWhat if you specifically\nwanted the shot to go,\n\n266\n00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:36.310\nnotice we have ins and\nout points for the right side.\n\n267\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.070\nNotice we also have this navigation bar,\nbut when I change the source side,\n\n268\n00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.410\nit doesn't change this side.\n\n269\n00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.670\nBecause there's no assumption you\nwant to be the same on both sides.\n\n270\n00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:51.625\nSo let's say I wanted that\nendpoint specifically to\n\n271\n00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:55.689\nbe like when he taps me,\ndrop an end point.\n\n272\n00:14:55.689 --> 00:15:01.715\nAnd then, Like here.\n\n273\n00:15:04.331 --> 00:15:06.800\nAnd you'll notice,\nthere's a highlighted region now.\n\n274\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:13.476\nIt's highlighted this region, and\nI'm gonna do what a lot of people do.\n\n275\n00:15:13.476 --> 00:15:16.611\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n276\n00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:21.570\nmove this end point to here, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.410\nNow, what's gonna happen is this,\nis I'm gonna say, all right.\n\n278\n00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.780\nI'm gonna do that exact\nsame thing I did before.\n\n279\n00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:37.980\nThis has a length, a total length, between\nthe in and out point of three seconds.\n\n280\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.960\nThis has one of four seconds,\nso they don't match.\n\n281\n00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.930\nTechnically when I do an edit I do\nwhat's called a three point edit.\n\n282\n00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.760\nI would need two here and then one here.\n\n283\n00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:54.983\nLike either an inpoint or an outpoint,\ncuz the inpoint would line up here and\n\n284\n00:15:54.983 --> 00:15:57.580\nthen just fill in enough\nsource to reach there.\n\n285\n00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.570\nIn this case I got both.\n\n286\n00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.438\nSo what's it gonna do?\n\n287\n00:16:02.438 --> 00:16:07.080\nIf I drag it and do overlay,\nit's going to ask me a question.\n\n288\n00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.679\nThat's why a lot of people\ndo four point edits.\n\n289\n00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:15.880\nIt will say, the source is\nshorter than the destination.\n\n290\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.200\nWhat do you want me to do?\n\n291\n00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.410\nOne, I can change it and speed it up,\nwhat we call a fit to fill.\n\n292\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.030\nOr I can say ignore the source in point,\nthat's on Seymour side.\n\n293\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:30.381\nIgnore the source out point,\nokay, which is on Seymour side.\n\n294\n00:16:30.381 --> 00:16:31.998\nIgnore the sequence in point in our c.\n\n295\n00:16:31.998 --> 00:16:35.230\nWell, it's the sequence\nthat's the most important.\n\n296\n00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.469\nOkay, it's the sequence\nthat's the most important.\n\n297\n00:16:38.469 --> 00:16:40.978\nI'm gonna say ignore the Out Point.\n\n298\n00:16:40.978 --> 00:16:43.780\nWhere this starts is more\nimportant than where it ends.\n\n299\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.831\nNow I have the ability to say,\n\n300\n00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:49.695\nalways chose this because it\ndefaults to Sequence Out.\n\n301\n00:16:49.695 --> 00:16:53.658\nI can say always chose this one, okay.\n\n302\n00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:56.617\nAnd then do you say, so that's it forever?\n\n303\n00:16:56.617 --> 00:16:59.200\nNo, there's a way to change it back.\n\n304\n00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.243\nThere's always a way, Adobe always\ngives you a way to change it back.\n\n305\n00:17:02.243 --> 00:17:08.370\nAnd I'll say, okay, boom, and it filled in\nfrom there to there and let's take a look.\n\n306\n00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:20.238\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Now,\nhere's the clever part that I show people.\n\n307\n00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:23.803\nIt's like, yeah, that's pretty good,\neditors hate this.\n\n308\n00:17:23.803 --> 00:17:29.760\nIt's like, he was gonna do something else\nand he cut in the middle of the action.\n\n309\n00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.368\nSo now what?\n\n310\n00:17:32.368 --> 00:17:34.560\nBut I don't wanna change this length.\n\n311\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.807\nIf I double click a segment,\nokay, this is a segment.\n\n312\n00:17:40.807 --> 00:17:42.510\nNow that it's in\nthe timeline it's a segment.\n\n313\n00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:46.469\nIf I double click it, first of all,\nyou're like, wow, that's huge.\n\n314\n00:17:46.469 --> 00:17:51.870\nYep, there's my zoom bar, I'll take\nit down, okay, and it's like aha.\n\n315\n00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.909\nSo what timeline sees,\nwhat a timeline sees,\n\n316\n00:17:57.909 --> 00:18:02.449\nthis is the segment\nthat's being used here.\n\n317\n00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:05.660\nBut it sees the entire clip.\n\n318\n00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.490\nSo we call this handle, on either side.\n\n319\n00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.770\nThis would be the link of the entire clip.\n\n320\n00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.760\nBut this is what's being\nused in the segment.\n\n321\n00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.660\nOne thing you wanna pay attention too,\nis the name.\n\n322\n00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.840\nIs it's giving me the name\nof the sequence it's in.\n\n323\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.940\nThat's a very long name right now.\n\n324\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.800\nAnd then the clip, okay?\n\n325\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.111\nOr actually no, it's gonna be the clip and\nthen the sequence is that.\n\n326\n00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.647\nSo that's what it's doing.\n\n327\n00:18:33.647 --> 00:18:37.544\nSo I can take this handle and\n\n328\n00:18:37.544 --> 00:18:41.279\ngo move it back like this.\n\n329\n00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:45.693\nNope wrong direction,\nthere, that's what I want.\n\n330\n00:18:45.693 --> 00:18:47.200\nI want it to start there and end there.\n\n331\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.538\nI didn't move it long enough and\nthat's what it does down here.\n\n332\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.592\nWe call that a slip, okay.\n\n333\n00:18:58.592 --> 00:19:00.448\nWe call that a slip.\n\n334\n00:19:00.448 --> 00:19:06.122\nIn that the length was right but\nthe location was wrong.\n\n335\n00:19:06.122 --> 00:19:08.573\n&gt;&gt; They had to go back to the source\nmonitors, to be able to monitor,\n\n336\n00:19:08.573 --> 00:19:09.115\nbecause you.\n\n337\n00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:10.291\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n338\n00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:12.995\nthis is what people find very confusing,\n\n339\n00:19:12.995 --> 00:19:18.560\nis I can double-click it to edit it in the\nsource monitor, but it's not the source.\n\n340\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.700\nIt's a segment.\n\n341\n00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.174\n&gt;&gt; Because you double-clicked it from\n\n342\n00:19:21.174 --> 00:19:22.221\nthe timeline,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n343\n00:19:22.221 --> 00:19:24.590\n&gt;&gt; Put it into production\nif you wanna say.\n\n344\n00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.148\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, so\nI'm working with a segment.\n\n345\n00:19:27.148 --> 00:19:32.329\nThe source monitor will allow you to look\nat double-clicked segments or clips.\n\n346\n00:19:32.329 --> 00:19:38.320\nWhich will come into, will be very\nhandy when we work with effects.\n\n347\n00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.301\n&gt;&gt; And that was actually the one\npart that just came back that you\n\n348\n00:19:41.301 --> 00:19:42.539\ndouble-clicked that.\n\n349\n00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:43.129\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you have to double-click it.\n\n350\n00:19:43.129 --> 00:19:45.111\n&gt;&gt; That's where you got\nit into the source.\n\n351\n00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:47.747\n&gt;&gt; Now there's a way to load\nthe master clip back in from here,\n\n352\n00:19:47.747 --> 00:19:51.312\nwhich I will show at a later time cuz we\ndon't really need to know that right now.\n\n353\n00:19:51.312 --> 00:19:55.553\nBut here's the last thing I\nwanna cover in this lesson.\n\n354\n00:19:55.553 --> 00:20:00.723\nOkay, what is the problem as\nto why Seymour looks so big?\n\n355\n00:20:00.723 --> 00:20:04.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was the thing that we\nended on the other episode of like, and\n\n356\n00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.405\nI kept like it is with different\nsize I think he's gonna get to that.\n\n357\n00:20:08.405 --> 00:20:09.331\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n358\n00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:11.916\nThere are a lot of different\nways to create a sequence and\n\n359\n00:20:11.916 --> 00:20:14.778\nwe get into the more advanced\nones we're gonna talk about it.\n\n360\n00:20:14.778 --> 00:20:20.001\nThe first clip that I drug in was\nthe black magic pocket cinema.\n\n361\n00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:23.043\nIf I control click back in the timeline,\n\n362\n00:20:23.043 --> 00:20:27.550\nI have the ability to\nreveal it's properties.\n\n363\n00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.900\nAnd I look at its properties, okay.\n\n364\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.911\nIt's properties are it is\n1920 by 1080 at 23.976.\n\n365\n00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:42.187\nNow because that is the first\nsegment that I dragged in here.\n\n366\n00:20:42.187 --> 00:20:46.989\nIf I go to sequence settings\nthe sequence conformed\n\n367\n00:20:46.989 --> 00:20:52.023\nitself to 1920 x 1080 23.976, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:52.023 --> 00:20:58.162\nThe sequence isn't anything until\nyou tell it to be something.\n\n369\n00:20:58.162 --> 00:21:03.060\nIt's the part of it that most\npeople don't understand.\n\n370\n00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.809\nHang on one second.\n\n371\n00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:05.930\nOkay, I need to get rid of you.\n\n372\n00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.340\nCome here, come here, come here, okay.\n\n373\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.217\nI better find if I had just hit return.\n\n374\n00:21:08.217 --> 00:21:09.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n375\n00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:12.930\nhere' s the thing,\nif I take a look at Seymour.\n\n376\n00:21:15.936 --> 00:21:17.863\nOkay, Properties.\n\n377\n00:21:20.213 --> 00:21:22.223\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot bigger.\n\n378\n00:21:22.223 --> 00:21:24.482\n&gt;&gt; 3840 x 2160.\n\n379\n00:21:24.482 --> 00:21:28.630\n&gt;&gt; So it's conforming to the first\nthing that you put onto the timeline.\n\n380\n00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.636\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Which is 1920 by 1080.\n\n381\n00:21:30.636 --> 00:21:33.587\nSo as soon as I put something\nbigger in it, it's just like,\n\n382\n00:21:33.587 --> 00:21:36.020\nokay, in this world that's\nwhat it looks like.\n\n383\n00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.191\nSo there's a couple of\ndifferent ways to handle this.\n\n384\n00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:42.664\nOne quick way, Ctrl+Click.\n\n385\n00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.344\nSet to frame size, cuz the frame size for\n\n386\n00:21:48.344 --> 00:21:52.308\nthis sequence is 1920 by 1080,\n\n387\n00:21:52.308 --> 00:21:57.220\nokay, 1920 by 1080, bam, there we go.\n\n388\n00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.006\nAnd now we have a nice\nlittle cutaway of Seymour.\n\n389\n00:22:05.331 --> 00:22:09.068\n&gt;&gt; So you basically saying to\nmatch the default resolution,\n\n390\n00:22:09.068 --> 00:22:12.129\nor the default size because\nthat was the first.\n\n391\n00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:15.707\nIf you would done it in reverse,\nif you have done the tomatoes.\n\n392\n00:22:15.707 --> 00:22:18.673\n&gt;&gt; But if I had done the tomatoes first,\nthis sequence would have been.\n\n393\n00:22:18.673 --> 00:22:19.173\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Been 320's?\n\n394\n00:22:19.173 --> 00:22:19.743\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're here.\n\n395\n00:22:19.743 --> 00:22:20.311\n&gt;&gt; 32, 60?\n\n396\n00:22:20.311 --> 00:22:23.402\n&gt;&gt; And real Seymour would have been real\n\n397\n00:22:23.402 --> 00:22:24.834\nsmall.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n398\n00:22:24.834 --> 00:22:25.576\n&gt;&gt; And then I have to\n\n399\n00:22:25.576 --> 00:22:29.973\nset frame size to make it bigger, okay.\nThis is a little trick we often\n\n400\n00:22:29.973 --> 00:22:33.342\ndo when we do things.\nIf I shoot 1080,\n\n401\n00:22:33.342 --> 00:22:39.299\nI'm gonna put things into a 720 sequence.\nHere's why, real quick,\n\n402\n00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:44.592\nbecause if I single click a clip,\nokay, not double,\n\n403\n00:22:44.592 --> 00:22:52.640\nsingle, go up here to Effects controls\nunder Motion, here's my scale.\n\n404\n00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.471\nIt's now scaled at 50%.\n\n405\n00:22:56.085 --> 00:22:59.694\nNow I've rescaled it a bit.\n\n406\n00:22:59.694 --> 00:23:01.549\n&gt;&gt; You can change that.\n\n407\n00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:05.460\n&gt;&gt; Not only that, as we get into one of\nthe other lessons, we can animate that.\n\n408\n00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.875\n&gt;&gt; I'll make it all part of the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, make it all part and\n\n409\n00:23:08.875 --> 00:23:10.942\nI can make it look like\nit's a camera zoom.\n\n410\n00:23:10.942 --> 00:23:13.553\nI can make it move over, okay.\n\n411\n00:23:13.553 --> 00:23:16.645\nI can make corrections where\nsometimes people done this\n\n412\n00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:20.340\nwhere they give me all this still\nfoliage and then one moving shot.\n\n413\n00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.688\nI'm like, why did you do that?\n\n414\n00:23:23.688 --> 00:23:26.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, I'm seeing like\ncommercials or different things.\n\n415\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.175\nI mean, I've seen this done\nin like the final result.\n\n416\n00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:31.142\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And it's like, that's [INAUDIBLE]\n\n417\n00:23:31.142 --> 00:23:32.998\n&gt;&gt; I'll show you one of the techniques,\n\n418\n00:23:32.998 --> 00:23:34.740\nhow they did things with like 24.\n\n419\n00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.902\nHow they did it with the cameras that pop\nin and out I can do it with key frames.\n\n420\n00:23:39.902 --> 00:23:41.990\n&gt;&gt; Where they went to the one box,\nbox, box, box.\n\n421\n00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.932\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, it's like all\nof a sudden it's like with one camera.\n\n422\n00:23:44.932 --> 00:23:47.969\nHe's like running around and\nthen all of a sudden it cuts to a closeup.\n\n423\n00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:52.050\nAnd it cuts back, like how am I\ngonna do that with one camera?\n\n424\n00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:52.979\nI, I can show you.\n\n425\n00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:54.483\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; I can show you it will be great.\n\n426\n00:23:54.483 --> 00:23:55.500\n&gt;&gt; That's super neat.\n\n427\n00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.532\n&gt;&gt; So now we just we have\njust a really short story.\n\n428\n00:23:58.532 --> 00:24:00.022\nWe have a really short story.\n\n429\n00:24:00.022 --> 00:24:02.730\nMaybe this is gonna be a segment\nwithin the larger story.\n\n430\n00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:10.177\nOkay, and then I'll show you how to put\na title on this, and just ship it out.\n\n431\n00:24:10.177 --> 00:24:11.460\n&gt;&gt; This is our first story.\n\n432\n00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.618\n&gt;&gt; It's our first story,\nand so it's two shots.\n\n433\n00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:16.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we just took it and\nput it in the timeline and\n\n434\n00:24:16.895 --> 00:24:19.330\nwe just made our first little video.\n\n435\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:19.998\nThat's awesome!\n\n436\n00:24:19.998 --> 00:24:20.958\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n437\n00:24:20.958 --> 00:24:22.047\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n438\n00:24:22.047 --> 00:24:25.302\n&gt;&gt; Well, well I had a third shot, and\nthen we'll have a great old time.\n\n439\n00:24:25.302 --> 00:24:26.432\n&gt;&gt; That sounds fantastic.\n\n440\n00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:28.548\nI don't know about you all out there, but\n\n441\n00:24:28.548 --> 00:24:31.997\nI'm super intrigued and very curious\nas to where Seymour the cat and\n\n442\n00:24:31.997 --> 00:24:34.985\nSeymour the puppet is going to\ntake us through the garden.\n\n443\n00:24:34.985 --> 00:24:40.006\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off this episode for Creative Pro TV.\n\n444\n00:24:40.006 --> 00:24:41.260\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n445\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.365\n&gt;&gt; I'm Jim Bennel.\n\n446\n00:24:42.365 --> 00:24:43.705\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n447\n00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:48.434\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

There is something, there is data,\nthere is cloud, there is everything.\n\n6\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.230\n&gt;&gt; I just realized I'm like I think I just\nsaid some pros and some creatives and\n\n7\n00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.535\nsomething all in there.\n\n8\n00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:34.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n9\n00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:37.390\nwe're here to talk about\n[LAUGH] Premier Pro.\n\n10\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.860\nAnd thankfully we have Mr. Jim Beattle\nhere in the studio to correct me.\n\n11\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.480\nTo make sure that I'm telling you\nwhat episode we're actually on.\n\n12\n00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I need to correct you.\n\n13\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.470\nThat's funny.\n\n14\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.940\nBut we're gonna talk about\nnavigating the timeline.\n\n15\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.770\nI know we've been talking about Symo the\ncat and Symo the puppet and I think we're\n\n16\n00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.241\njust gonna keep on and on with our\nfirst story and a little bit more.\n\n17\n00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:02.900\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna add a little bit more,\nwe're gonna work a little in sounds and\n\n18\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.230\nwe're gonna do just a couple of thing.\n\n19\n00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.590\nThe timeline itself has a lot of tools and\n\n20\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.350\na lot of preferences that you can set And\nfor some people it's very daunting.\n\n21\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.790\nSo what we are going to do we are going to\nexplore a little bit more of how it works.\n\n22\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.690\nSo, as I am going to jump in,\nI'm going to add one more shot.\n\n23\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.780\nI am going to show you\nwhy a lot of people and\n\n24\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.380\nsometimes while I am working\nreally like a certain option.\n\n25\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.520\nSo here's how the story goes.\n\n26\n00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.020\nAt the end of this Seymour is\nwarning me About puppet Seymour.\n\n27\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.060\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have\npuppet Seymour come in from the side.\n\n28\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.890\nUse my L key, I just his I for that.\n\n29\n00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.920\nHe decides he wants his\npepperoncini pepper.\n\n30\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.730\nHe finally gets it.\n\n31\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.980\nCome here you and\nhe takes a little nibble.\n\n32\n00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.090\nAnd then It's too hot, yes.\n\n33\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.200\nOkay, and off he goes, and\nI'll cut it off right there, and\n\n34\n00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.950\nthen I'll add an out point.\n\n35\n00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.170\nNow, do I want sound with this?\n\n36\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.010\nYes.\n\n37\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.040\nSo, remember,\nthis side represents the right.\n\n38\n00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.850\nWhen I am editing,\n\n39\n00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.310\nwhen I'm moving from left to right,\nthis doesn't matter at all This does.\n\n40\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.840\nAudio for this is now activated.\n\n41\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.190\nIf I drag this there's this\nthing called Insert After.\n\n42\n00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.090\nMy play hand in the timeline is\nin the completely wrong place.\n\n43\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.390\nThis is supposed to go at the end.\n\n44\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.015\nInstead of moving it I say,\nhey, I just put it at the end.\n\n45\n00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:30.709\n[CROSSTALK] Because you'd think that,\nI would think I have to stop.\n\n46\n00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.830\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Or put an end point there and do it.\n\n47\n00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.260\nNo, I can just say move it to the end.\n\n48\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.255\nIt's a nice little option That happens\nwith that and it's pretty great.\n\n49\n00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:44.940\n&gt;&gt; .And so sometimes you use the play head\nto say I want to go right here, and that's\n\n50\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.430\nwhere I wanna drag it into either the\ntimeline or the program window or panel.\n\n51\n00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.350\nAnd sometimes that's okay,\nI need to [INAUDIBLE] up there, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fine and just put it right\nat the end now it's a little hard to see\n\n53\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.940\nthat one at the end one trick\nis is if I just use the plus,\n\n54\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.560\nminus keys, that's my zoom in, zoom out\n&gt;&gt; And there it is.\n\n55\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.760\nSo yeah I just went right to the end.\n\n56\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.530\n&gt;&gt; And you wouldn't have to be focused\non the timeline panel to use those\n\n57\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.620\ncontrols plus and minus.\n\n58\n00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.690\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, control plus and\n\n59\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.680\nminus works well on the panel\nthat it's supposed to work in.\n\n60\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.530\nNow, the other thing I don't like\nis this is a really long name.\n\n61\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.020\nThis is a really long name for\nthis particular Timeline sequence.\n\n62\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.030\nAn easy way to change it that a lot\nof people don't think about or\n\n63\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.740\nthey don't know about because\noftentimes the control menus,\n\n64\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.870\nthere's a lot to control\nespecially in the timeline.\n\n65\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.590\nInstead of trying to go back\nto my project window and\n\n66\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.150\ntry to find it that way, I can go here,\nand this is one of the things,\n\n67\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.250\nthis is like,\nwhen people see this they just lose it.\n\n68\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.670\nThere is a thing called,\nreveal sequence and project.\n\n69\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.190\nBoom.\n\n70\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.409\nAnd if I go over there, It should had\nfound it and it should had highlighted it.\n\n71\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.110\nWhich it did.\n\n72\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.020\n&gt;&gt; This was that, what?\n\n73\n00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.100\nDidn't we do th is one other time?\n\n74\n00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.950\n&gt;&gt; Hun.\n&gt;&gt; Where you could go ahead,\n\n75\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.770\nwhere we made the, not the poster but\nthe thing from the top,\n\n76\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.780\nwhere we had, the still.\n\n77\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; ]And\n\n78\n00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.780\nyou said take this still and\nput it into it.\n\n79\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.070\nThis makes it a lot easier.\n\n80\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.970\n&gt;&gt; In this case though, it's like.\n\n81\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.340\nThe sequence is located somewhere in\nthe project, just like the master clip.\n\n82\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.700\nAs soon as I create a sequence,\nit's in my project.\n\n83\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.300\nBut this case it's like I\nneed to rename this, and\n\n84\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.410\nyou can only rename it\nin the project panel.\n\n85\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.690\nSo this is a one step of,\ninstead of having to go through and\n\n86\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.970\nmaybe do the search function or\nall that, or some\n\n87\n00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.040\npeople name their sequences by going copy\none, copy two, copy, copy, copy, copy.\n\n88\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.130\nAnd they can't tell which\none it actually is.\n\n89\n00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.070\nSo with this one step, by going to the\ncrawling I say, reveal the sequence, and\n\n90\n00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.980\nit's like, this is the proper sequence.\n\n91\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.740\nAnd then I can say, episode one or EP.\n\n92\n00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.080\nLet me go back Sometimes I\nget screwed up with this.\n\n93\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.610\n&gt;&gt; But now that is over here in\nthe project, now you can just go ahead and\n\n94\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.680\nrename right from here because-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n95\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.200\nthat's where you wanna rename it.\n\n96\n00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.180\nSo boom, and now its called episode 1.\n\n97\n00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.180\nSo the convenient thing about\nthat is when I export this\n\n98\n00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.120\nthe file will be called ep1 or episode 1.\n\n99\n00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.410\nThat is why I often like\nto name my sequences\n\n100\n00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.440\nIs how they're gonna be exported.\n\n101\n00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.110\nSometimes I can, sometimes I can't.\n\n102\n00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.060\nAll right, so\nI'm going to maximize the panel.\n\n103\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.710\nOkay, I'm gonna use the tilde key and\nthere's a lot of stuff in here.\n\n104\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.170\nNow, I'm gonna use plus minus and zoom in.\n\n105\n00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.920\nI can drag Over here,\nI can drag the play head over here and\n\n106\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.630\nthen stretch it out with the plus sign.\n\n107\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:50.710\nNow here is how all of this\nstuff works with this side.\n\n108\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.819\nSo I have video 1 highlighted,\na1 through a3.\n\n109\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.320\nIf I use the up down arrow keys, it takes\nme to every cut that I've made, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.710\nNotice where it's not stopping, video two.\n\n111\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.190\n&gt;&gt; The extra track that's above it.\n\n112\n00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the other track.\n\n113\n00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.050\nIt's not stopping at\nany cuts in video two.\n\n114\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.760\nHowever, If I highlight it, then it does.\n\n115\n00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.410\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it wasn't looking for\nV2 because it was turned off.\n\n116\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.080\n&gt;&gt; Think of it this way.\n\n117\n00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.870\nThe play head is blue and\nit points downward.\n\n118\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.770\nIt's pointing downward,\nso if it sees blue,\n\n119\n00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.820\nIf it sees a blue track,\nit sees that as an active track.\n\n120\n00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.580\n&gt;&gt; That's why blue is so\nimportant in Premier.\n\n121\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n122\n00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.750\nSo let's say, for example,\nI wanted to make a cut right there.\n\n123\n00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.120\nWithout using the blade tool,\nthat is command K.\n\n124\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:59.200\nIf I have v1 off it only cut in a one.\n\n125\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:06.720\nIt did not cut, it didn't cut in\nthe video, because it doesn't see it.\n\n126\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.210\n&gt;&gt; The video V1 is off, so it didn't\ncut so the would be in the audio.\n\n127\n00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n128\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.600\nExactly, now if I turned\nvideo one back on Cmd + k.\n\n129\n00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.260\n&gt;&gt; There's your line in\nthe video because that's on.\n\n130\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, it's like using the blade\ntool, but I'm just using Cmd + k.\n\n131\n00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.160\nAnd it sees it, so this is very important,\nis that when you are performing\n\n132\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.060\nthings within the timeline, the tracks\nthat are active are what response.\n\n133\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.120\nSo I'd also do something like this\nlet's say I place an end point here and\n\n134\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.690\nI placed an out point there and\nI turn off v one and hit delete.\n\n135\n00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.680\nOkay until we did.\n\n136\n00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.190\nThe track cut so\nit's just it's just a demonstrate that.\n\n137\n00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.606\nThis side primarily deals with\nworking in the timeline itself.\n\n138\n00:07:55.606 --> 00:07:59.798\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we're on the right-hand side\nnow within those little buttons.\n\n139\n00:07:59.798 --> 00:08:05.298\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nnow let's get into this idea of I goofed,\n\n140\n00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:08.417\nokay, and this is just not me.\n\n141\n00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:11.110\nBut I goof all the time as\nwe've already seen on the show.\n\n142\n00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.710\nBut I goofed and there's something\nI could've done on the left side,\n\n143\n00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.040\non the source side,\nthat Adobe will be very forgiving.\n\n144\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.950\nAnd I can now do on the right side.\n\n145\n00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.388\nSo let's take a listen to\nthis audio real quick, okay.\n\n146\n00:08:31.433 --> 00:08:35.270\nI know that it is low for\na couple of different reasons.\n\n147\n00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.900\nOne, watching the audio meters, all right?\n\n148\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.800\nWe're gonna do a lesson on really\nwatching the audio meters.\n\n149\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.487\nBut,\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE] There's a little bump.\n\n150\n00:08:45.487 --> 00:08:50.980\n&gt;&gt; There's the little bump, but\neverything else is just smudged.\n\n151\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.590\nSo, what do I want to do to correct this?\n\n152\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.821\nOn the left side, we have gain.\n\n153\n00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:02.950\nGain is for sources.\n\n154\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.800\nOn the right side, we have volume.\n\n155\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.120\nVolume affects an entire track.\n\n156\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.460\nSo if I'm on the right side and\nI say bring up the volume,\n\n157\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.330\nI bring up the volume of the entire\ntrack and all the sources.\n\n158\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.310\nIf I'm doing just a source clip,\nI'm doing the source itself, that's gain.\n\n159\n00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.460\nSo what I can do if I forgot,\nand generally people do it on\n\n160\n00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.500\nthe project side because you can, you can.\n\n161\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.860\nAnd the advantage of that is let's say you\nbrought in a bunch of music and somebody,\n\n162\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.050\nokay this is gonna be,\nhere is an old word.\n\n163\n00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:41.040\nSomebody gave you a bunch of CDs, and\nif you ever brought CDs into video.\n\n164\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.870\nThe problem was it was\nabout 12 decibels over.\n\n165\n00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.140\nAnd you had to kill everything\nby about 12 decibels or\n\n166\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.960\nit was just gonna blast out everything.\n\n167\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.610\nSo what we do on the source side\nis highlight all the CD tracks,\n\n168\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.470\ntake the gain, and bring it down,\nand it would do all of them.\n\n169\n00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.390\nBut I've only got one here.\n\n170\n00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.700\nSo if I forgot to do it on that side,\nI can Ctrl+click it.\n\n171\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.004\nAnd I have all this stuff,\nI think it say, lalalala, audio gain.\n\n172\n00:10:10.004 --> 00:10:10.783\nBoom.\n\n173\n00:10:10.783 --> 00:10:13.650\nNow, we're just gonna worry\nabout gain at this point,\n\n174\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.750\nwe're not gonna worry about normalization,\nokay?\n\n175\n00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.160\nSo let's say I wanna raise this up.\n\n176\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.010\nRight now the gain is set to zero.\n\n177\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.700\nLet's go 12 and what you're gonna see,\n\n178\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:34.250\nwatch the little, boink,\nbigger waves, bigger waves.\n\n179\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.367\nNow, how can I see this\na little bit better?\n\n180\n00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:43.669\nRemember how I was using plus minus?\n\n181\n00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.890\nI have added option.\n\n182\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.220\n&gt;&gt; Option+command plus.\n\n183\n00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.578\n&gt;&gt; No, just option, plus minus.\n\n184\n00:10:50.578 --> 00:10:51.890\n&gt;&gt; Just option, okay.\n\n185\n00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:52.980\nYou didn't add it in?\n\n186\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.070\n&gt;&gt; Nope, so I just add option,\nplus minus, and\n\n187\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.960\nthat makes all of the audio tracks expand,\nokay?\n\n188\n00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it makes the height,\nit's changing the row height.\n\n189\n00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:03.969\n&gt;&gt; Yep, changing the height.\n\n190\n00:11:03.969 --> 00:11:06.124\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, it's Office terms now.\n\n191\n00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.991\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Please no, use Office terms.\n\n192\n00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:10.188\n&gt;&gt; If I do command plus minus,\nthat does the video.\n\n193\n00:11:10.188 --> 00:11:14.086\nSo you'll notice as soon as I do that,\nI have thumbnails available on this, but\n\n194\n00:11:14.086 --> 00:11:16.369\nI couldn't see them\nbecause it's too small.\n\n195\n00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:23.190\nIf I do Shift plus minus, it's just\na default setting, it's small or large.\n\n196\n00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.990\nAll right, so\nnow let's see what's going on.\n\n197\n00:11:31.177 --> 00:11:32.490\nOkay.\n\n198\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:37.020\n[SOUND] Now there's some noise stuff we're\ngonna take care of a little bit later.\n\n199\n00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.024\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; Like all the background here in\n\n200\n00:11:40.024 --> 00:11:40.790\nthe beginning.\n\n201\n00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's my air conditioner.\n\n202\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.637\nYeah, and so we'll take care\nof that in a later lesson but\n\n203\n00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:50.760\nits like, This has some,\nlook what happened.\n\n204\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.301\nBrought it back in, so Ctrl+click-\n&gt;&gt; That's the resolution-\n\n205\n00:11:54.301 --> 00:11:54.971\n&gt;&gt; That's your resolution.\n\n206\n00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:56.890\n&gt;&gt; The scale to fit, fit to scale.\n\n207\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.170\n&gt;&gt; Yep, set frame size.\n\n208\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.140\n&gt;&gt; Boom.\n\n209\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.860\nThere he is.\n\n210\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.480\n&gt;&gt; Set to frame size.\n\n211\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.070\n&gt;&gt; Set it to frame size, yep.\n\n212\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.310\nAnd of course, what's the problem?\n\n213\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.520\nThat fuzzy mike's still in there.\n\n214\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.320\nSo I'll just say, okay.\n\n215\n00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:08.820\nBoom.\n\n216\n00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.460\nSingle click Effects Controls.\n\n217\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.077\nLet's just bring that\nup just a [INAUDIBLE].\n\n218\n00:12:17.077 --> 00:12:18.190\nOkay, boom.\n\n219\n00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.460\nThat's gonna be fine.\n\n220\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.390\n61, look at that.\n\n221\n00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.940\nThat's awesome.\n\n222\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.800\nAnd he's gonna eat that hot pepper and\nhe's gonna be really really mad.\n\n223\n00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.680\nHe's a bad puppet kitty.\n\n224\n00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.340\nSo, let me do [INAUDIBLE]\nand maximize this.\n\n225\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.400\nAnd what am I gonna do next?\n\n226\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.880\nWell, maybe\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, maybe, maybe.\n\n227\n00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.850\nAnd this is where audio\ncan be your friend.\n\n228\n00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.580\nMaybe, maybe, maybe I can take.\n\n229\n00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.740\nAnd here's another thing.\n\n230\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.510\nIt's called linking.\n\n231\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.420\nSo audio is linked to these master clips.\n\n232\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.300\nSo every time I highlight the audio or\nthe video, That happens.\n\n233\n00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.900\n&gt;&gt; They're both gonna connect together.\n\n234\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some people love it,\nsome people hate it.\n\n235\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.260\nOption is the magic key,\njust the option key.\n\n236\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.400\nBecause if I come up here, these\nare blue and they're turned on, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.350\nThis is snapping.\n\n238\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.480\nRight now we're just going with linked.\n\n239\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.000\nIf I turn off linked, Now when I\ncome down here it grabs either or.\n\n240\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.310\n&gt;&gt; You can select them\nindependently from each other.\n\n241\n00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n242\n00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.390\nBut what if somebody says I want\nto click on this and click both?\n\n243\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.810\nIf I just hold down option,\nI have the option to click both.\n\n244\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.330\nOkay.\n\n245\n00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.560\nSome people leave it on and\nthe option is to do each one individually.\n\n246\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's the same in\na lot of the Adobe products.\n\n247\n00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.980\nThe option key or\nthe alt key would go ahead and\n\n248\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.820\ndo the reverse of whatever you have.\n\n249\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.710\n&gt;&gt; Right, it just does the reverse.\n\n250\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.360\nSo a lot of what you do applies.\n\n251\n00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.210\nSo now I'm just gonna do it\nlike a little thing here.\n\n252\n00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.119\nI'm gonna move this down here.\n\n253\n00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.480\nI'm going to come to the end and\nI get this little red symbol.\n\n254\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.280\nWe're going to talk about\nadvanced trimming later.\n\n255\n00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.190\nBut I get this little red symbol and\n\n256\n00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:04.780\nI'm wondering, I see it's grabbing both,\nI don't want both I just need one.\n\n257\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.420\nSo let me do this,\nlet me do a little option here.\n\n258\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:11.920\nCome on.\n\n259\n00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.010\nOkay, grab one.\n\n260\n00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.180\nAnd what I've done is\nessentially trimmed the audio\n\n261\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.030\nfrom this shot underneath this one.\n\n262\n00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.310\nAnd it will be consistent,\n\n263\n00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.350\nI can say, you know what, I never\nneeded that audio in the first place.\n\n264\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.600\nOhh, do my option.\n\n265\n00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.100\n&gt;&gt; You've got to hold the option key,\nthey're linked.\n\n266\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I've got to hold the option key,\nthey're linked.\n\n267\n00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.220\nI've got to hold the option key And\ndo that.\n\n268\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.340\nSo now, this is a form of trimming.\n\n269\n00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:45.470\nAnd what I have essentially done is\nI have rolled all of that audio.\n\n270\n00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.720\nLet me go back.\n\n271\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:54.400\nI have rolled all that audio from\nthe kitty shot, from his shot.\n\n272\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.660\nUnderneath the whole thing and\nit keeps it consistent.\n\n273\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.920\n&gt;&gt; To me, it's almost like reverse\ntrimming in the sense because you\n\n274\n00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.830\nextended it out.\n\n275\n00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.300\n&gt;&gt; You can extend and\nyou can trim back, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.078\nYou can extend and then here he goes,\nit's so hot, you dumb puppet.\n\n277\n00:15:11.078 --> 00:15:14.570\nSo, yeah, okay.\n\n278\n00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:20.530\nAnd that's one way to just\ndeal with audio quickly.\n\n279\n00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.210\nNow there's another, okay.\n\n280\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.890\nA lot of people,\n\n281\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.030\nI know a lot of people work in like\nediting programs like this before.\n\n282\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.850\nI'm gonna go ahead and do the, now if you\ndon't like the option plus minus Yeah,\n\n283\n00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.910\njust like Excel spreadsheets.\n\n284\n00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.550\nJust stretch it out.\n\n285\n00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.180\nIt's fine,\njust adjust the height that way.\n\n286\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:43.600\nLet's say somebody says, well, can I just\nlower this part and then bump this up?\n\n287\n00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.810\n&gt;&gt; Taking out the noise\nthat you were talking about\n\n288\n00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.640\nin the other parts of the audio.\n\n289\n00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, now a lot of people\ncall that rubber bands.\n\n290\n00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.274\nOkay?\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n291\n00:15:55.274 --> 00:15:57.089\ncall a key frames, okay?\n\n292\n00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:01.833\nBut yeah, it looks like rubber bands,\nand what I'm gonna do is,\n\n293\n00:16:01.833 --> 00:16:05.305\nthis is a way to manipulate\ndirectly the audio.\n\n294\n00:16:05.305 --> 00:16:07.590\nSo what we did before is\nthe gain was overall.\n\n295\n00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.830\nAll right.\n\n296\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:17.650\nSo if I come here,\nit'll say show key frames, all right?\n\n297\n00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.570\nThis believe it or\nnot right here is a key frame line.\n\n298\n00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.190\nThe reasoning I'm seeing it.\n\n299\n00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.280\nIs because with this wrench I can\ntell it what I want to see and\n\n300\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.930\nwhat I don't want to see.\n\n301\n00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.480\nUsually when I'm editing I turn off\nkeyframes cuz I wanna move things around\n\n302\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.740\nwith the mouse, and\nI start grabbing keyframe lines.\n\n303\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.180\nOkay, and it's like eh.\n\n304\n00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.520\nSo I am seen audio keyframes right now.\n\n305\n00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.210\nOkay, now some people ask why do you have\nthis option to turn off Audio Waveforms.\n\n306\n00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:51.030\nHere I have really low RAM machines,\nthey have to be created as a file,\n\n307\n00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.650\nthat could be the problem.\n\n308\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:57.170\n&gt;&gt; So the actual display of the bumps\nin the audio are people talking.\n\n309\n00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.828\n&gt;&gt; It is a cache file and sometimes to\ncreate those it can kind of tax your\n\n310\n00:17:00.828 --> 00:17:06.680\nsystem.So right now\n&gt;&gt; Here's Keyframes, all right?\n\n311\n00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.370\nNow, these are Clip Keyframes,\nthis would do individual clips.\n\n312\n00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:16.420\nThis one is gonna do the track, and\nI wanna do the overall track right now.\n\n313\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.140\nVolume, and\n\n314\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.980\nit has a little plus sign, so that's how\nyou know the difference between the two.\n\n315\n00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.730\nThere's several different\nways to manipulate this.\n\n316\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.520\nOne of my favorites is first\nof all if I just grab,\n\n317\n00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.590\nit does the whole line and\nit gives me a little decibel reading.\n\n318\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.220\nIt's like okay you've killed\nit by that many decibels.\n\n319\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.120\nAll right I was going to\ntake it back to zero.\n\n320\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.740\nback to zero.\n\n321\n00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.198\nCome here.\nZero's nice this time of year.\n\n322\n00:17:39.198 --> 00:17:40.142\nOkay.\n\n323\n00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:42.030\nAll right.\n\n324\n00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.230\nNow what if I just want to\nmanipulate separate sections.\n\n325\n00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.050\n&gt;&gt; I could go and\nget the pen tool and draw those in.\n\n326\n00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:54.440\nI'm gonna hold down command and\nI get a little plus.\n\n327\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.270\nIt's gonna go boom boom boom.\n\n328\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:05.720\nApril 1 here and then I can pull\nthe line and I can pull this line.\n\n329\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.160\nOkay?\n\n330\n00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.670\nSo it's keeping it right\nabout where I want it.\n\n331\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.680\nAnd it's going to affect the whole track.\n\n332\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.590\nIf I had multiple clips in this track,\nI know technically they're not clips,\n\n333\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.010\ntechnically they're segments, but\nit saves time just to say clip.\n\n334\n00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:26.710\nBut if I do that It\nwent down a little bit.\n\n335\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.880\nOkay that ugly noise went down a bit and\nIt only went down by 60db though so\n\n336\n00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.880\nI could take it no more.\n\n337\n00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.610\n&gt;&gt; And if it's not translating\non what you guys and\n\n338\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.190\nI could hear it when the cat yeah you'll\nsee all the other all of the noise go up\n\n339\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.310\n&gt;&gt; This is one of those new mystery bars\n\n340\n00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.630\nor or whatever they are called.\n\n341\n00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.880\nThat is cool,\nI've never played with one before.\n\n342\n00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.620\n&gt;&gt; It can start to get annoying.\n\n343\n00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.530\n&gt;&gt; Well, everything can.\n\n344\n00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.060\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n345\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.780\n&gt;&gt; Look at me, I mean come on.\n\n346\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.703\nSo, boom and yeah.\n\n347\n00:19:00.703 --> 00:19:01.888\n[SOUND].\n\n348\n00:19:01.888 --> 00:19:08.050\nSo yeah, and there's ways around that\nnot having such a jump and all of that.\n\n349\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.990\nOne neat trick,\na lot of people that have done this.\n\n350\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.990\nFor a long time don't know\nthis particular trick.\n\n351\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.463\nIf I'm still doing this,\nif I hold down Cmd again,\n\n352\n00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:25.080\nYou're gonna know exactly what this is.\n\n353\n00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's where you're going to change-\n\n354\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.310\n&gt;&gt; I get my handles\n\n355\n00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.654\n&gt;&gt; You get your [INAUDIBLE] handles or\n\n356\n00:19:30.654 --> 00:19:32.444\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; A lot of people don't know that this\n\n357\n00:19:32.444 --> 00:19:36.900\nworks in audio as well\n&gt;&gt; So I can create smoother\n\n358\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.420\naudio transitions with these handles,\nokay?\n\n359\n00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.390\nNow I'm just kinda going,\nwhen you zoom in a little bit,\n\n360\n00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.510\nit makes the interface go a little funky.\n\n361\n00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:50.000\nBut yeah, I can do that too, and\nI just made a quick audio change.\n\n362\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000\nA lot of this depends on in the field,\nyou're not just like\n\n363\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:01.510\nThe words I bet I hear people scream in\nthe control room is we'll fix it in post.\n\n364\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.840\nWhenever somebody brings that to me and\nsays you can fix that in post right?\n\n365\n00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.645\nI was like.\nYou get one of two answers.\n\n366\n00:20:08.645 --> 00:20:11.150\nNo or that's going to be a lot\nmore money then you can pay.\n\n367\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n368\n00:20:11.805 --> 00:20:13.285\nI mean, that's exactly what happens.\n\n369\n00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:15.405\nI'm sure you've been through\nit with certain things, yeah.\n\n370\n00:20:15.405 --> 00:20:17.225\n&gt;&gt; You can just Photoshop that out.\n\n371\n00:20:17.225 --> 00:20:18.895\n&gt;&gt; And you're like, [LAUGH], no.\n\n372\n00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:21.945\nIt's like okay.\n\n373\n00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:24.065\nAnd you're like okay, okay.\n\n374\n00:20:24.065 --> 00:20:27.305\nSo basically I have\ncreated a little timeline.\n\n375\n00:20:27.305 --> 00:20:32.150\nI've created a short little story where\nhe's like, hey, you're a bonehead,\n\n376\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.620\nhe's eating all the tomatoes, and\n\n377\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:41.340\nthen here it comes again it's eats\na hot pepper and he gets it come often.\n\n378\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.880\nLike I said, you collide images\ntogether and people create a story.\n\n379\n00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.370\nalright, great.\n\n380\n00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:50.180\nSo what I'm gonna do in the next\nlesson is we're just gonna\n\n381\n00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.970\nslap a title on this thing.\n\n382\n00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.320\nWe're gonna slap a real basic title, and\n\n383\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.740\nyou're gonna see how you\ncan have a lot of fun.\n\n384\n00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.970\nCuz a lot of people when they think title,\nit's like, I've gotta go to Photoshop.\n\n385\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.520\nGotta go to After Effects.\n\n386\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.910\nYou really don't, you can have\na great title that you can make\n\n387\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.780\nright here in Adobe Premier.\n\n388\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.680\nBut Jim, I am loving this progression\nof our little story right here.\n\n389\n00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.180\nYou know me, or most of you know me.\n\n390\n00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.780\nI love cats so\nI'm really excited about this.\n\n391\n00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.830\nBut it's nice that we can just\nadd that audio and extend it.\n\n392\n00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:23.314\nThere's some really kinda basic tricks but\nthat can go a long way\n\n393\n00:21:23.314 --> 00:21:24.364\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely\n\n394\n00:21:24.364 --> 00:21:25.260\n&gt;&gt; so a nice foundation.\n\n395\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.975\nI know you got more\ntricks up your sleeves.\n\n396\n00:21:26.975 --> 00:21:27.497\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n397\n00:21:27.497 --> 00:21:30.700\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll throw that title on\nthere and we'll have a beautiful little\n\n398\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.180\nstory to go ahead that-\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be great.\n\n399\n00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.512\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe'll export it into all sorts of things.\n\n400\n00:21:34.512 --> 00:21:35.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; Alright, wonderful!\n\n401\n00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.710\nWe'll gonna go ahead and wrap this\nup on this episode so signing off.\n\n402\n00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.337\nFor Creative Pro TV I've\nbeen your host Mon Smith.\n\n403\n00:21:41.337 --> 00:21:42.149\n&gt;&gt;

Yes, now I wanna show you folks\nsomething that's very interesting\n\n15\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Like I said,\n\n16\n00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.110\nsome people like the preview area,\nsome people don't.\n\n17\n00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.810\nI want to show you a great use for\nit, and in many cases, the icon view.\n\n18\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.490\nAll right, so I'm going to go\nback to the project window.\n\n19\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.800\nAnd what will occasionally happen to you,\nokay,\n\n20\n00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.660\nIs somebody will lean over,\nyou gotta get used to what we call,\n\n21\n00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.040\nas editor we call shouldering is this\nlike person comes right behind you and\n\n22\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.560\nsort of does something like\nthis over your shoulders,\n\n23\n00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.270\nleans over you,\nyou've never had this happen, I'm sure.\n\n24\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.200\n&gt;&gt; I know the back seat driver.\n\n25\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.850\n&gt;&gt; The back seat, yep, the back seat.\n\n26\n00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.450\n&gt;&gt; And it's like no,\nno no I'm not actually ready for\n\n27\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.470\nyou to see the finished product yet and\nthey are like can you move that over.\n\n28\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.610\n&gt;&gt; I\n&gt;&gt; It's like I know\n\n29\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.300\nyou want to seem smart.\n\n30\n00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.820\nYou can stop, I'm like, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.190\nSo what I'm gonna do is this.\n\n32\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.420\nI'm just gonna highlight and\nsee up in here, yep.\n\n33\n00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.580\nThere's that shot.\n\n34\n00:01:34.822 --> 00:01:36.990\nHere's that shot, come here.\n\n35\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.520\nWhich one, yeah, yeah, interesting.\n\n36\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.050\nLet's figure out a couple of things here.\n\n37\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.950\nHere we go, see more, interesting,\n\n38\n00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.860\nnow there is a little bit of a difference,\nlook to this,\n\n39\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.090\nand I would say something if\nsomeone came up ahead and say,\n\n40\n00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.010\nwhich one of shots did you use?'\nHave we used that shot before?\n\n41\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.190\nI'll look at this one.\n\n42\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.240\nNot that one, okay we used that one.\n\n43\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.520\n&gt;&gt; It actually says video used one time.\n\n44\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.490\n&gt;&gt; Here's the cool part.\n\n45\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.680\nIf I click the little disclosure, it\nsays it was used here at this time code.\n\n46\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.780\nAnd I'll say all right take me there.\n\n47\n00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.670\nAnd it takes me to exactly\nwhere that shot is.\n\n48\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.380\nSo if I used it multiple times,\nit would take me there.\n\n49\n00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.550\n&gt;&gt; And that was where we did the sequence?\n\n50\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we put it back into the project.\n\n51\n00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.100\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\nNo, no, no.\n\n52\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.790\n&gt;&gt; No?\n&gt;&gt; This is the clip itself.\n\n53\n00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; This is the clip itself,\n\n54\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.750\nhow have I used this in a sequence?\n\n55\n00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.170\n&gt;&gt; I see, okay, where is this.\n\n56\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.410\n&gt;&gt; If you're doing something, and\nmaybe you have a product shot, and\n\n57\n00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.010\nyou have to say they will say alright how\nmany times have you used that shot in that\n\n58\n00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.800\nsequence and I will like go and\nsay five times, where, and\n\n59\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.490\nI can scroll through and say here here\nhere here here, show them the timeline.\n\n60\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I just crossed my paths,\nI totally know what you're saying now.\n\n61\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.170\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, no, it's okay.\n\n62\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.500\nI mean, like I said, there's so\nmuch you can do in a system like Premier.\n\n63\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.050\nThere's so much you can do with it.\n\n64\n00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.030\nYou have to sort of limit your\nscope to what you're doing.\n\n65\n00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.000\nIf not, if you're trying to know\nthe whole software all the time\n\n66\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.440\nYou're gonna fry your brain.\n\n67\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.440\nSo in this case, that's why I break these\ndown into certain types of tutorials.\n\n68\n00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440\nThis is a very simple.\n\n69\n00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.110\n&gt;&gt;

It's in my project.\n\n237\n00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.640\nIt is saved there.\n\n238\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.250\nOkay?\n\n239\n00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.410\nNow I can drag it up.\n\n240\n00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.920\nOr if I command double click it.\n\n241\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:21.090\nIf I hold down command and double click\nit, or if i come back here And go control.\n\n242\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:21.590\nCome here.\n\n243\n00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.700\nCome here.\nCome here.\n\n244\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.638\nCome here.\nCome here.\n\n245\n00:12:24.638 --> 00:12:25.300\nCome here.\n\n246\n00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.410\nOpen in Source Monitor.\n\n247\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.310\nWhat do you think would happen if I\njust did a standard double click?\n\n248\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.180\n&gt;&gt; It would open up that to get a title.\n\n249\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.380\n&gt;&gt; In the title tool.\n\n250\n00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.100\nIt would open up in the actual title tool.\n\n251\n00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.970\nAnd I don't want that.\n\n252\n00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.780\nSo, that's the issue.\n\n253\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.900\n&gt;&gt; And I can see how that coul be like,\n\n254\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.290\nslightly misleading when you're\nsaying hold the command double click,\n\n255\n00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.730\nthat's the one that want it\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n256\n00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:55.410\nThe command double click will do\nthe same thing as control say load and\n\n257\n00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.820\nsource monitor cuz what we wanna do\nis I wanna edit this like a cliff so\n\n258\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.889\nI can come over here.\n\n259\n00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.730\nTo the timeline.\n\n260\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.920\nNow, watch what I am going\nto do in the timeline.\n\n261\n00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.560\nAll right, let's say I do want to edit\nit but I want to put it in video three.\n\n262\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.870\nAnd, I want to do it as an overwrite.\n\n263\n00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:16.240\nAll I have to do is take this video\none and put it into video three.\n\n264\n00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.120\nOkay, so I come here.\n\n265\n00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.490\nThere we go.\n\n266\n00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.750\nBecause sometimes you might say-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz the blue is the focus of where\n\n267\n00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.840\nwe're going to be putting document in.\n\n268\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n269\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.410\nAnd then cuz I know some\npeople are like well,\n\n270\n00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.500\nI like doing this dragon drop stuff\nI don't care what you say and good.\n\n271\n00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.930\nIf you feel comfortable with it do it.\n\n272\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:40.990\nSo now if I just go like this And\n\n273\n00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.160\noverwrite, boom,\nbecause it knew to go into video three.\n\n274\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.310\nAnd I'll say, okay, so there it is, last\ntime out in the garden with Seymour, and\n\n275\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.430\nthen I will just trim it\nback to right about there.\n\n276\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.620\nOkay, just trim it back, there we go.\n\n277\n00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.320\nNow, let's have some more fun with it.\n\n278\n00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.300\nSo, I've got my title, it's really cool.\n\n279\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.910\nInstead of dropping fades on it,\nwhich is what most people do,\n\n280\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.790\nit's like,\njust drop a cross dissolve on it.\n\n281\n00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.810\nI'm going to do it myself, okay.\n\n282\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.510\nI'm going to go to settings, and I'm going\nto say show me video key frames, and\n\n283\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:21.820\nI get a line This line is\nthe opacity line okay.\n\n284\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.750\nYou know what opacity is.\n\n285\n00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.650\n&gt;&gt; The amount of seethroughness.\n\n286\n00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.410\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nthe amount of seethroughness.\n\n287\n00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.200\nI like that a lot,\nthe amount of seethroughness.\n\n288\n00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.540\nSo if I hold down the command.\n\n289\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.200\nActually you know what, for\nthose people that don't like that.\n\n290\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.010\nI'm gonna go to the pen tool.\n\n291\n00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.820\nWe're going to go,\nin fact I'm guessing it's P.\n\n292\n00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.770\nYep, if I just hit P for Pen Tool,\nyeah that's pretty good.\n\n293\n00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:50.201\nAnd then I'll draw here a +,\na +, a +, a + and\n\n294\n00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:56.280\nI'll just drag that first one down and\nI'll drag this second one down.\n\n295\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.060\nAnd yes, because we can\nnever be satisfied with that\n\n296\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.690\nHold down the command key,\ngive myself a nice busy a curve.\n\n297\n00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, convert the points.\n\n298\n00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.245\n&gt;&gt; Convert the points.\n\n299\n00:15:08.245 --> 00:15:09.877\nMr. Busy.\n\n300\n00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:14.500\nSo boom there we go and now.\n\n301\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.120\nThat was very similar to\nwhat we did with the audio.\n\n302\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.900\nWhen we added the key frames and\nwe set it to go ahead and\n\n303\n00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.420\ndo like the gain and\nfade in and kinda fade.\n\n304\n00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.980\n&gt;&gt; I've been telling\npeople instead of going\n\n305\n00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.517\nright straight to the\n&gt;&gt; Instead of going right\n\n306\n00:15:31.517 --> 00:15:34.876\nstraight to the dissolves\nwhich we'll get into later,\n\n307\n00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:39.521\nmake your own with the Apache tool,\nit's fun, it's absolutely fun.Now,\n\n308\n00:15:39.521 --> 00:15:44.522\nhere's a little trick, because let's say\nI have to create another, new, okay,\n\n309\n00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:49.409\nyou know this one, if I wanna take it back\nto the selector, what's the hot keys?\n\n310\n00:15:49.409 --> 00:15:50.945\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, still the same key.\n\n311\n00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:51.724\nIt's still the same key.\n\n312\n00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:55.020\nIf you're used to it in Photoshop,\nit's still the same key.\n\n313\n00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.979\nIf I hold down option and\ndrag this, I make an immediate copy.\n\n314\n00:15:58.979 --> 00:16:01.200\n&gt;&gt; Because alt drag, or options.\n\n315\n00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.650\n&gt;&gt; Option, or alt drag, any one.\n\n316\n00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:09.750\nSo now these are two different, they\nare now considered two different files.\n\n317\n00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.990\nThey are now completely considered two\ndifferent files, I'm gonna call this exit.\n\n318\n00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.300\nThe reason why I did it this\nway is because, if I do that,\n\n319\n00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.560\nit's going to at least it should,\nit's gonna retain the keyframes.\n\n320\n00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.730\nIt's gonna retain those keyframes-\n\n321\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.940\n&gt;&gt; The opacity-\n&gt;&gt; Yup-\n\n322\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.140\n&gt;&gt; That you just added in.\n\n323\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.540\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna retain that and\n\n324\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.860\nit's just like, I'm content with that\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n325\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.990\nif I double click it now\nin here like I did it.\n\n326\n00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.948\nAnd I can do this that's really easy.\n\n327\n00:16:44.948 --> 00:16:52.966\nSee you next.\n\n328\n00:16:52.966 --> 00:16:55.024\n&gt;&gt; Time.\n\n329\n00:16:57.644 --> 00:16:58.590\nOn, In The Garden with Seymore.\n\n330\n00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.170\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n331\n00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.680\nI was like you need another t.\n\n332\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.220\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n333\n00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:03.860\n&gt;&gt; Next, okay.\n\n334\n00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.340\n&gt;&gt; Because now we're editing\nthe exit clip, or the exit title.\n\n335\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We have to do the alt drag,\n\n336\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.180\njust go ahead keep\neverything out that I want.\n\n337\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.220\nChange that one little part and\nnow I've- All right, I'm following you,\n\n338\n00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:15.860\nI'm following you.\n\n339\n00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.104\n&gt;&gt; There you go, now watch this,\nbecause Key Frames,\n\n340\n00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:21.701\nsome key frames are what we call elastic.\n\n341\n00:17:22.744 --> 00:17:25.790\nIn that sense, or, you know, stretchable.\n\n342\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.390\nLet me create this, there we go.\n\n343\n00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.468\nAnd lets say someone said,\n'Can you make it longer'.\n\n344\n00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:34.080\nThese aren't.\n\n345\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.370\nOkay?\nSo, if I make it longer, all I have to do,\n\n346\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.290\nis just drag these key frames back.\n\n347\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:41.950\nSay, right there.\n\n348\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:48.640\nA lasting meaning as I make it longer,\nthe key frames will move or contract.\n\n349\n00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.640\n&gt;&gt; It's almost absolute positioning\nversus relative positioning.\n\n350\n00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.910\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's not relative to\n\n351\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.180\n&gt;&gt; The star is like wherever you put it,\n\n352\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.250\nyou made it longer.\n\n353\n00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.730\nIt's not gonna move with it.\n\n354\n00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.730\n&gt;&gt; Right and we're gonna discuss that when\nwe get into effects cuz there's ways to do\n\n355\n00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.550\nthat in effects all right.\n\n356\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.980\nSo basically and I know, some of you\nare saying what about color correction?\n\n357\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.320\nWhat about this, what about that?\n\n358\n00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.250\nLet's just say this is just simple.\n\n359\n00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:16.650\nThis is it and we're gonna say this is the\nteaser to 'In the Garden With Seymour'.\n\n360\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.837\nIt's a web series and it's only\n[INAUDIBLE] episode is ten seconds long.\n\n361\n00:18:21.837 --> 00:18:27.520\nWhatever, so there you go we've pop\nin some very basic and like again.\n\n362\n00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.100\nUp top in the program you're seeing\nthis is what the audience is gonna see\n\n363\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.790\ndown at the bottom okay.\n\n364\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.163\nIn three, let me just return this.\n\n365\n00:18:37.163 --> 00:18:37.801\nOkay?\n\n366\n00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:45.060\nThis mish-mosh down here, okay,\nthis mish-mosh is what we see.\n\n367\n00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.702\nUp top is what the audience\nis going to see.\n\n368\n00:18:51.604 --> 00:18:52.820\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But when\n\n392\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.400\nyou wanna create the thing that you've\ncreated that's great, you would do that.\n\n393\n00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.090\n&gt;&gt; In theory.\n\n394\n00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.060\n&gt;&gt;

Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n401\n00:20:17.475 --> 00:20:21.325\nnow we've added our title track\nmaking sure we were on that V3 and\n\n402\n00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:23.140\nthat's where I was like,\nit's gotta be blue.\n\n403\n00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.110\nIt's gotta be blue.\n&gt;&gt; Drag it in.\n\n404\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.970\n&gt;&gt; It's gotta be blue.\n\n405\n00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.170\n&gt;&gt; So all those little pieces, but it's\none of those that you do have to be very\n\n406\n00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.670\naware as to what button you're\nclicking in which panel.\n\n407\n00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.880\nAnd that's the biggest thing that\nI've taken away from all of this.\n\n408\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.380\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\n\n409\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.220\n&gt;&gt; So I hope you guys are taking\naway the same thing and\n\n410\n00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.980\n&gt;&gt; We will comeback with another\n\n411\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.270\nepisode about exporting but we're gonna go\nahead and sigh off for this episode for\n\n412\n00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.830\nright now.\n\n413\n00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.860\nSo this has been CreativePro.TV,\nI've been your host Bonne Smith.\n\n414\n00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:53.805\n&gt;&gt;

So we don't have any coming\nin to the shot as much.\n\n104\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n&gt;&gt; Right to the pepper.\n\n105\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.984\n&gt;&gt; And I'm looking to the boss going,\nyou're right,\n\n106\n00:04:46.984 --> 00:04:48.375\nit does kinda drag a little bit.\n\n107\n00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:49.895\nHe's like,\nthe cat has a sense of urgency, and\n\n108\n00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:51.575\nthen all the sudden there's\nthis [INAUDIBLE] thing.\n\n109\n00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:53.270\nMust get it to the urgency.\n\n110\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.898\nOkay, that's the story telling.\n\n111\n00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:59.130\nAnd if I can do this quickly,\nI can stay in the mindset of storytelling.\n\n112\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.810\nSo all I do is I come down,\nI scroll all the way over there.\n\n113\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.620\nI take this.\n\n114\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.870\nI get the little symbol,\nI click it and watch.\n\n115\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.890\nOn the left it's showing me\nwhere the previous shot ends.\n\n116\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.400\nSo that's where he always looks up to me.\n\n117\n00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.540\nThis, I'm trimming it,\ntrimming it, trimming it.\n\n118\n00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.790\nThis is now where the new\nshot is going to begin.\n\n119\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.400\nAnd I'll say it begins right, right as he\njust struggles to get it, right there.\n\n120\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.300\nAnd you will notice because I also had\nsomething on that we're gonna try and\n\n121\n00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.290\ntalk about in advanced lesson.\n\n122\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.219\nThis title moved with it.\n\n123\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.720\nIt is what we call synch locked, which is\nsomething that really confuses people but\n\n124\n00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.250\nlike I said we'll be into\nthat a little bit later.\n\n125\n00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.562\nI love sync locking, there a times\nto turn it on and turn it off.\n\n126\n00:05:50.562 --> 00:05:53.858\nSo this, as I turned it,\nthat title actually moved.\n\n127\n00:05:53.858 --> 00:05:55.921\n&gt;&gt; We were talking that in other episode,\n\n128\n00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:59.606\nwhere I use the reference like\nthe absolute reference and the relative\n\n129\n00:05:59.606 --> 00:06:03.936\nreference of don't ever remove your always\nsaying, or go with everything else.\n\n130\n00:06:03.936 --> 00:06:07.005\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nin editing we call it synclocking and\n\n131\n00:06:07.005 --> 00:06:11.769\nI'll show you the ancient device that\nwe used to use edit film that kept\n\n132\n00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:17.460\nthings moving in sync\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now all I have to do is.\n\n133\n00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.450\nOkay, and I have notice I\nhave my link selection off.\n\n134\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.180\nWe just tap the down arrow key and\ngo to the end of the audio.\n\n135\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.300\nOkay, and then just sort of\nripple ripple trim that out.\n\n136\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.000\n&gt;&gt; And with the ripple trim if it was\nlinked, would it have ripple trim both?\n\n137\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.658\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [CROSSTALK] It will grab both.\n\n138\n00:06:36.658 --> 00:06:37.755\nIt will grab both.\n\n139\n00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:40.210\nOkay, here it comes.\n\n140\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.943\nIt's not grabbing.\nPeople are saying why is it not grabbing?\n\n141\n00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:46.909\nBecause I have, I'm going to do Option +,\n\n142\n00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:52.414\nI have the view key frames on,\nand sometimes when\n\n143\n00:06:52.414 --> 00:06:58.910\nI do that it's very hard to\ngrab The end and do a trim.\n\n144\n00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.160\n&gt;&gt; Because it's in that mode where you're\nadding key frames if you do something.\n\n145\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.910\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm done key frame now doesn't see it.\n\n146\n00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In that particular mode.\n\n147\n00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.620\n&gt;&gt; So, in this case I'm going to\nturn off show the audio key frames.\n\n148\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.129\nThey're not there anymore and\nthen I should be able to trim it hopefully\n\n149\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.900\nNow I'm upset.\n\n150\n00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.500\n&gt;&gt; You're looking for that yellow icon.\n\n151\n00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.280\nThe yellow arrow icon?\n\n152\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and there it is, there it is.\n\n153\n00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.460\nIt's letting me, it's not letting me\ndo it with the mouse [INAUDIBLE].\n\n154\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.570\nI don't know why, okay?\n\n155\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.330\n&gt;&gt; James, can it be something\nwith the newer version of it?\n\n156\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.650\nLike the, cuz I know if Excel or\nPhotoshop does some weird thing,\n\n157\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.800\nit's like they switched this new feature\non, and I now have to To turn it off.\n\n158\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.950\nIs there something like that?\n\n159\n00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.589\n&gt;&gt; This is one of those things in Adobe\nthat it can be very frustrating for\n\n160\n00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:53.509\npeople but the more you engross\nyourself in Adobe you'll understand it.\n\n161\n00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:54.728\nEspecially with Premiere.\n\n162\n00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:56.673\nGo back to my screen real quick.\n\n163\n00:07:56.673 --> 00:07:59.674\nAnd there's one thing I forgot to do.\n\n164\n00:07:59.674 --> 00:08:02.146\nAnd I'm like what is it, what is it?\n\n165\n00:08:02.146 --> 00:08:08.960\nAnd then I realized, Track Keyframes are\non, that's why we have that little plus.\n\n166\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.020\nSo what it's doing is,\nit's noting, I can't trim a track.\n\n167\n00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.090\nI can trim a segment.\n\n168\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.670\nSo, what I do is go, Click.\n\n169\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:24.250\nClick key frames and\nnow, I bet you, there.\n\n170\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.230\n&gt;&gt; There's our icon we were looking for.\n\n171\n00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.880\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\nThat's exactly what we were looking for.\n\n172\n00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.860\nIf you're in track mode, no.\n\n173\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.110\nIf you're in track keeper mode, its\nlike I'm in track, dude, and you forget.\n\n174\n00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.750\nYou forget.\n&gt;&gt; And this is something that we had done\n\n175\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.050\nin a previous episode when we were\ndoing putting in keyframes in\n\n176\n00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.730\nthat to get us with, it wasn't necessarily\nthe product doing some weird update.\n\n177\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.080\nIt was the\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n178\n00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.090\nit's I had forgotten to clear out me,\nmyself doing tracks.\n\n179\n00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it's like I just jumped out of that.\n\n180\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.110\nAnd that's like,\nwhat happened, what happened?\n\n181\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.990\nIt's like I just forgot.\n\n182\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.100\nAnd then you kinda go.\n\n183\n00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.650\nAnd you're like hm, yeah,\nI forgot to do that.\n\n184\n00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.000\nThat's why it gets frustrating, and\nthis is why the timeline is the tool\n\n185\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.070\nwhere there are a lot of things going on,\nand sometimes you just gotta slow down.\n\n186\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do the same thing.\n\n187\n00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.860\nI get on, it's like I'm doing this,\nI'm doing this.\n\n188\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.915\nIt's like but\nthe program's not reading my brain.\n\n189\n00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:09.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n190\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.740\n&gt;&gt; I know I'm ready to go onto here,\nyeah, it's always a button or\n\n191\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.070\na mode that you forget to\nturn yourself back into.\n\n192\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.330\nSo that's what it is.\n\n193\n00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.850\nWe can't blame it on an update.\n\n194\n00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.780\n&gt;&gt; No, and that's one of those things.\n\n195\n00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.190\nEven somebody like me that's been doing\nthis for years, I still forget things.\n\n196\n00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.430\nBecause I'm into work mode,\nit's like, what did I forget?\n\n197\n00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.390\nWe call that a PEBCAC error.\n\n198\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.530\n&gt;&gt;

That's a massive list.\n\n241\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:28.790\n&gt;&gt; The most convenient though come here,\ncome on, is you got Vimeo's and\n\n242\n00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:34.010\nyour YouTube's so\nit's like I need this to be a YouTube 720,\n\n243\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:39.050\nthat's what I need, boom done.\n\n244\n00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.310\nSo it's all preset up for YouTube.\n\n245\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:49.260\nNow this total time tell us how long this,\nthis is 17 seconds and\n\n246\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.130\n4 frames, and we're supposed to be flat 20\nor maybe a flat 18 or something like that.\n\n247\n00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.200\nWe'll get that in a second, so\nyeah, I wanna export the video and\n\n248\n00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.240\nexport the audio maybe I need to send\nit to anybody but yeah, I want both.\n\n249\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.060\nThis output name right\nhere notice how it's blue.\n\n250\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.900\nIf I click it or hover over it notice\nit says it's going here right now\n\n251\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.840\nusers office blah, blah, blah,\nblah, I don't want it to go there.\n\n252\n00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.559\nIf I click it, it gives me the option\nto send it some place else,\n\n253\n00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:24.560\nsomething else where I can find it and\nas 98% of the time where is\n\n254\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.530\nthat going to be for\nmost people probably the desktop.\n\n255\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.263\n&gt;&gt; The desktop, yep,\nI'll do the same thing.\n\n256\n00:12:31.263 --> 00:12:34.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The last place you should send it but\n\n257\n00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.490\nI could see it,\nthen go ahead and just see it.\n\n258\n00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.520\nHere's a summary of everything.\n\n259\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.350\nTells you where it's gonna go, what it's\nmade out of, what it's gonna be called.\n\n260\n00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.000\nAnd then I can come down\nto some of these options.\n\n261\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.430\nOk, so if I come down to the afex option.\n\n262\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.737\nPeople are like what is all of this, first\nthere is a thing called the metric or\n\n263\n00:12:54.737 --> 00:12:55.430\nthe lumetry.\n\n264\n00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.920\nI just really don't understand,\n\n265\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.660\nthis is how you can add like a big\noverall color correction to it.\n\n266\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:07.280\nNow you can do that within the actual\napplication or just it at the very end.\n\n267\n00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.780\nYou can send somebody a sample.\n\n268\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.780\nHere's the idea.\n\n269\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:17.330\nIf I go ahead and click that, I can say\nI would like to add, and I just put this\n\n270\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:22.190\nover there, there's all these things\nlike bleach bypasses, all these things.\n\n271\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.800\nYou can find a white paper.\n\n272\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.960\nOn what all of this means.\n\n273\n00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.900\n&gt;&gt; It's like putting like an Instagram\nfilter on your finished product.\n\n274\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n275\n00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.010\nExactly.\n\n276\n00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:34.420\nBut people who do color correction would\nbe like no, I mean this is hard work.\n\n277\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:34.920\nAnd it is.\n\n278\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.690\nI mean you could do the same thing.\n\n279\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.110\nI'm going to do Blue Ice.\n\n280\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.500\n&gt;&gt; You can see the result.\n\n281\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:46.350\n&gt;&gt; And you can see the result and\nthat's going to put it over the entire.\n\n282\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.050\nFile that you're sending so\n\n283\n00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.320\nwe can see what blue eyes looks like here,\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n284\n00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.300\nyou're saying like some hardcore editors\nthey be like, no, you're gonna do each one\n\n285\n00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.841\nof the segments with a different\ntypes of color correction, yeah.\n\n286\n00:13:56.841 --> 00:13:58.910\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwe're gonna get into color correction and\n\n287\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.102\nhow we do actual color correction.\n\n288\n00:14:00.102 --> 00:14:01.750\nThis is we often call this the LUT.\n\n289\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.980\nThe LUT means the Look Up Table.\n\n290\n00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.230\nOk we'll talk about luts and\nlook up tables, and why some people\n\n291\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.420\ndon't go anywhere near them and\nwhy some people absolutely love them.\n\n292\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.380\nSo we're going to get SDR conform,\nwe're going to get away from that.\n\n293\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.930\nImage overlay would be like,\n\n294\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:22.670\nlets say you're afraid of\npeople stealing your stuff.\n\n295\n00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:27.070\nAnd you made a JPEG with your logo on\nit that goes directly in the center or-\n\n296\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.950\n&gt;&gt; To your watermark.\n\n297\n00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can watermark it in that way.\n\n298\n00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.180\nOr you could add a name\noverlay with something.\n\n299\n00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.010\nYou could put your name in the corner and\n\n300\n00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.470\nit's cross the whole thing instead\nof having to do the title tool.\n\n301\n00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.410\nAll right?\n\n302\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.260\nTime code, if you want somebody to look at\nthis and tell you where the corrections\n\n303\n00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.670\nshould be based on the time\ncode running at the bottom.\n\n304\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.950\nIt's like at this time it's really\nconvenient if you're sending this\n\n305\n00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:58.800\nto someone and they say at this\ntime I would like you to do this,\n\n306\n00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.120\nat this time I would like you to do that.\n\n307\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.850\n&gt;&gt; You're sending it like that's\nproofing it's going to go ahead and\n\n308\n00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.210\nverify whatever the video is-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n309\n00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.260\n&gt;&gt; Going to somewhere.\n\n310\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.890\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, because when I send out a file\nto be checked out I always put a time\n\n311\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.960\noverlay and just send me\nthe corrections based on the time code.\n\n312\n00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.790\nInstead of doing like when he turns and\nthe blue thing goes.\n\n313\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.870\nIt's like, there's a little number there.\n\n314\n00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.280\nCould you just write down the number.\n\n315\n00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.870\n&gt;&gt; That that doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n316\n00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I.\n\n317\n00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.110\n&gt;&gt; Give me a number.\n\n318\n00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI'm looking at reliable here.\n\n319\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.760\nNow this is the new thing, time tuner.\n\n320\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.260\nIn generally you don't want to do like so\nI'm gonna turn this on.\n\n321\n00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.930\nThe current duration is.\n\n322\n00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.980\n17 seconds and 4 frames, I can say,\n\n323\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.050\nyou know what I would like\nthis to be a flat 20 seconds.\n\n324\n00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.325\nAnd its going to time tune it,\n\n325\n00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:51.043\nit's gonna say, I can give you 18 21.\n\n326\n00:15:51.043 --> 00:15:54.818\nSo it's not like one of\nthese things were you go,\n\n327\n00:15:54.818 --> 00:15:58.976\nI made a 30 second video,\nI need it to be 2 minutes.\n\n328\n00:15:58.976 --> 00:16:04.830\nNo, it can't do that, but it can do a\ncertain amount to get you a certain time.\n\n329\n00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.290\nIf you're told this must\nbe exactly 30 seconds and\n\n330\n00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.190\nyou have 29 seconds in 10 frames.\n\n331\n00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.214\nYou can use the time tuner and\njust tune it up just a little bit.\n\n332\n00:16:14.214 --> 00:16:17.290\n&gt;&gt; These are like small increments?\n\n333\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Very small increments.\n\n334\n00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.682\nAnd believe it or not, it is great.\n\n335\n00:16:20.682 --> 00:16:26.370\n&gt;&gt; And it's not gonna make a serious\nimpact on what you're looking at.\n\n336\n00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:26.883\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n337\n00:16:26.883 --> 00:16:29.415\n&gt;&gt; They really slow that down [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's why they limit it,\n\n338\n00:16:29.415 --> 00:16:30.430\nthat's why they limit it.\n\n339\n00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.570\nIt's like your gonna at this,\nonce you do too much and\n\n340\n00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.380\nyou're going to lose how this looks and\nthis it's gonna be obvious.\n\n341\n00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.111\nYou also have the ability to add captions,\nwe'll talk about captions later.\n\n342\n00:16:41.111 --> 00:16:46.140\nOr straight up publish on the export\nsend straight up to the cloud.\n\n343\n00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.160\nThere's also the ability to\nsend it straight to Facebook,\n\n344\n00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.830\na file transfer protocol, Twitter,\nVimeo, or straight to YouTube.\n\n345\n00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.214\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I mean, you would have to\nhave all of your logins and username and\n\n346\n00:17:00.214 --> 00:17:01.563\npasswords connected to that?\n\n347\n00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:04.764\n&gt;&gt; Yep, as long as you have all of that,\nand it will send it right straight there,\n\n348\n00:17:04.764 --> 00:17:07.840\nlike somebody was saying, send it\nright straight to the YouTube account.\n\n349\n00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.661\nInstead of sending it here and\nthen having to do this.\n\n350\n00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:14.580\n&gt;&gt; Then go over into Twitter and\nget the URL from your YouTube.\n\n351\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.227\nThat's pretty nice.\n\n352\n00:17:16.227 --> 00:17:21.137\n&gt;&gt; And then all you have to do,\ncome down to the bottom and hit Export.\n\n353\n00:17:21.137 --> 00:17:25.731\nNow the disadvantage is that you\nhave to stop working in Premiere\n\n354\n00:17:25.731 --> 00:17:28.040\nwhen you do a simple export.\n\n355\n00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.010\nYou have to stop working.\n\n356\n00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.791\n&gt;&gt; So you can't go back on doing anything.\n\n357\n00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:34.360\n&gt;&gt; Can't go back, this is not what we\ncall a background process, you're done.\n\n358\n00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.170\nThere's ways to export and\ncontinue working.\n\n359\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.320\nBut there are times I\ndon't tell people that.\n\n360\n00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.455\nAnd it's like, well,\ngotta take a break, we're exporting.\n\n361\n00:17:42.455 --> 00:17:44.485\nAnd that's, yeah.\n\n362\n00:17:44.485 --> 00:17:47.625\n&gt;&gt; I do have one quick question\non that format, the H264.\n\n363\n00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:50.078\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Like if I had kept that at QuickTime\n\n364\n00:17:50.078 --> 00:17:55.019\nand then just went ahead and said YouTube\n720, would that make any difference?\n\n365\n00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:59.295\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you something,\ndepending upon the codec, let me go here.\n\n366\n00:17:59.295 --> 00:18:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I know the world of\ncodecs can get really crazy.\n\n367\n00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, let me go to QuickTime, okay?\n\n368\n00:18:09.938 --> 00:18:11.530\nThere's no option.\n\n369\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.329\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; They will say these are the options for\n\n370\n00:18:14.329 --> 00:18:15.750\nQuickTime, okay?\n\n371\n00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.050\nThese are the presets within QuickTime.\n\n372\n00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.128\n&gt;&gt; And the H264, you said,\n\n373\n00:18:22.128 --> 00:18:27.190\nthat's the most generic version,\nand then all of your other options.\n\n374\n00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.920\nIt's what we call delivery codec and a lot\nof people want delivery as an H264 because\n\n375\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.540\nit works across many different systems.\n\n376\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:39.620\nAnd so if you choose H264, that's where\nyou get all of these different devices and\n\n377\n00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.150\nsystems that can use it like I said.\n\n378\n00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.659\nYou can even, there's the nook.\n\n379\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:52.390\nI actually delivered things for the nook\nseveral years, I don't do that anymore.\n\n380\n00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:57.750\nIf it's specifically supposed to be for\nthese devices, there it is.\n\n381\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's the one that\nall these devices go towards, and\n\n382\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.553\nthen make their\nspecifications to the H264.\n\n383\n00:19:02.553 --> 00:19:07.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the specific H264, and\nthen the presets of all the different\n\n384\n00:19:07.575 --> 00:19:12.280\nthings like your bit rate and\nall that are just already set for you.\n\n385\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.660\nYou don't have to play the guessing\ngame like we used to have to.\n\n386\n00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.160\nSo\n&gt;&gt; Well that answers some questions.\n\n387\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.670\nSo perfect.\n\n388\n00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.370\n&gt;&gt; There we are, and awesome.\n\n389\n00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.200\nSo now we have a file.\n\n390\n00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.430\nSo I'll just double click it,\nit's going to open up in QuickTime\n\n391\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.560\n[SOUND] Here we go, he eats it.\n\n392\n00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.940\nIt's all hot, he's like no, blah.\n\n393\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.682\n&gt;&gt;

So that's a separate\nthing that you purchased?\n\n65\n00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.570\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so I have two items on here.\n\n66\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.923\nAnd the grand total was less than $250.\n\n67\n00:02:57.923 --> 00:02:59.579\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; To put onto my phone, yeah.\n\n68\n00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.145\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n69\n00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:02.780\n&gt;&gt; And like I said,\nI can take that into airports, all that.\n\n70\n00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.870\nNow, even less than that, this guy, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.580\nThis is my light.\n\n72\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.881\nAnd we're gonna see this light,\nthis is literally like a $40 light.\n\n73\n00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:14.212\nIt just goes on top that\nI use all the time.\n\n74\n00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:15.850\nAnd I'm gonna bring up another thing.\n\n75\n00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.798\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking these price sets are gonna\nbe like a couple hundred dollars each or\n\n76\n00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:19.641\nsomething like that.\n\n77\n00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:20.755\n&gt;&gt; Right, here's my audio.\n\n78\n00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:24.430\nThis is one of my audio\ndevices that I use, okay?\n\n79\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.780\nAnd again, very portable,\nI can plug four microphones into it.\n\n80\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.140\nI have capsules for other microphones.\n\n81\n00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.841\nAnd we're gonna use this a little\nbit later in one of the episodes.\n\n82\n00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.250\nThis is another one of my\naudio recording devices.\n\n83\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.210\nWe're gonna talk about that, and\nwe're gonna combine it with this.\n\n84\n00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.950\nI have a 360 degree camera, but\nI got this for free with a new phone.\n\n85\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.740\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah,\n\n86\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.560\nso it's like, I got a new phone,\nand I got this for free.\n\n87\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.724\nAnd it's like, what am I gonna\ndo with a 360 degree camera?\n\n88\n00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:50.227\nWell, I'm gonna show you what\nyou can do with it in Adobe.\n\n89\n00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:52.095\nBecause it's fun and\nnow it's part of my standard kit.\n\n90\n00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:57.145\nBut this thing,\nthis little thing is amazing, and I use it\n\n91\n00:03:57.145 --> 00:04:00.955\nall the time to record interviews, and\nit now records 360 degrees spacial sound.\n\n92\n00:04:00.955 --> 00:04:04.047\n&gt;&gt; I was saying it's almost like one of\nthe journalists with the little tapes,\n\n93\n00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:05.577\nthe actual tapes that they put in,\n\n94\n00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:07.927\nthey would hold up to somebody\nto record their audio.\n\n95\n00:04:07.927 --> 00:04:10.058\nIt's just the newer digital version.\n\n96\n00:04:10.058 --> 00:04:11.419\nAnd it's 360?\n\n97\n00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.164\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit can be what we call binaural sound or\n\n98\n00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:17.367\nusing what's ambix right now,\nwith all that.\n\n99\n00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:19.696\nAnd it's just a nice little\nkit that I take with me.\n\n100\n00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:20.987\nAnd it's easy to use.\n\n101\n00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:23.100\nNow I do have a tripod,\nI didn't bring the tripod.\n\n102\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.120\nBut I do have a tripod\nto settle the shots, and\n\n103\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.520\nit's just something I\ncan just take with me.\n\n104\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.824\nAnd for the Internet and for\nother things, it works beautifully.\n\n105\n00:04:30.824 --> 00:04:33.010\nLike I said, I can get it on a plane,\nI can get it in my car.\n\n106\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.837\nIt's easy to take where I'm going,\nand it's just very, very simple.\n\n107\n00:04:36.837 --> 00:04:41.477\nNow, what I wanna show you is when\nyou start to get into transitions,\n\n108\n00:04:41.477 --> 00:04:45.804\nand you start to wanna do new things,\nit gets a little advanced.\n\n109\n00:04:45.804 --> 00:04:49.070\nSo you have to make your\nsetup a little more advanced.\n\n110\n00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.700\nAnd you're feeling a bit like,\nhm, I can do this now,\n\n111\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.348\nI can get into Adobe, it's cool.\n\n112\n00:04:53.348 --> 00:04:55.030\nSo I wanna show you some transitions,\n\n113\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.830\ncuz that's the first thing\nthat most people gravitate to.\n\n114\n00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.900\nAnd here's the warning,\nI'm not the biggest fan of dissolves.\n\n115\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.381\nBut occasionally, they do work.\n\n116\n00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:07.246\nOkay, occasionally transitions do work,\nbut\n\n117\n00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:12.273\nwe have an old saying in the editor's\nworld, if you can't solve it, dissolve it.\n\n118\n00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:14.283\nDon't solve everything with\na dissolve please, okay?\n\n119\n00:05:14.283 --> 00:05:16.871\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I wanna go back to my interface\n\n120\n00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:20.720\nreal quick, and I want you to see,\nthe standard view has changed.\n\n121\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.222\nI moved something, and\nI didn't mean to move it.\n\n122\n00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:29.274\nAnd you might wanna say, I just wanna\nget back to what it looked like.\n\n123\n00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:30.313\n&gt;&gt; So your workspace.\n\n124\n00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:32.730\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nthis is called the workspace.\n\n125\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.590\nAnd it is under,\nin the menu bar, the Window.\n\n126\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.830\nSo if I go to Workspaces,\n\n127\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.840\nit's telling me right now with\nthe dot that I'm on Editing.\n\n128\n00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.920\nAll I have to do is say,\nReset to Saved Layout, and it goes back.\n\n129\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthis is the same in all of your products,\n\n130\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.800\nlike the location of your panels, or\nwindows, whichever we wanna call them.\n\n131\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.220\nThat's your workspace, and all the presets\nare up there in the Windows menu.\n\n132\n00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.359\n&gt;&gt; Now something that was introduced in\nthe last version that's pretty great is up\n\n133\n00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.781\nat the top, you will notice,\nthere's a bar.\n\n134\n00:06:01.781 --> 00:06:04.452\nAnd these have a lot of.\n\n135\n00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:09.695\n&gt;&gt; The presets [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; They're preset for the workspaces, so\n\n136\n00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:11.490\nthere's one for editing,\nhere's one for color.\n\n137\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.222\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering what\nthose things were up there.\n\n138\n00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:15.081\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, here's one for effects, and\n\n139\n00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:16.081\nnot everybody uses these.\n\n140\n00:06:16.081 --> 00:06:19.211\nSome people just stick straight into the\nediting workspace and just use it over,\n\n141\n00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:21.230\nand over, and over again.\n\n142\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.990\nIt's absolutely fine to do that, okay?\n\n143\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.844\nWe also have an audio one,\nit's pretty good.\n\n144\n00:06:26.844 --> 00:06:30.646\nAnd what you're noticing too is,\nthis is kinda made for a big screen or\n\n145\n00:06:30.646 --> 00:06:35.044\nmultiple screens, and that's why we\nsplit things up, graphics, libraries.\n\n146\n00:06:35.044 --> 00:06:40.642\nNow I created two of my own, called\nediting LT, which has a long timeline down\n\n147\n00:06:40.642 --> 00:06:46.431\nhere and then one which has a big project\nwindow, which is similar to assembly.\n\n148\n00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:48.430\nNow, how did I do this?\n\n149\n00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.160\nFirst of all, to break up the big chunky\nbar, let's go to editing real quick.\n\n150\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.228\nAnd let's say, I'm gonna work\nwith source and effect controls.\n\n151\n00:06:58.228 --> 00:07:04.696\nAnd I wanna squeeze this up, okay,\nand I'm just grabbing lines here.\n\n152\n00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:11.421\nAny time I get this symbol, and\nI grab a line, okay, boom, do dah.\n\n153\n00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:16.412\nAnd I think I'm gonna make this a little\nbigger cuz I'm gonna be doing some\n\n154\n00:07:16.412 --> 00:07:18.810\ntransitions, okay?\n\n155\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.620\nAnd another thing,\nmaybe I don't like tools.\n\n156\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.675\nMaybe I just don't like them.\n\n157\n00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:26.420\nCtrl+click, and I will say,\nclose the panel.\n\n158\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.161\nWhat if I wanna move this?\n\n159\n00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:33.646\nI want some more screen real estate.\n\n160\n00:07:33.646 --> 00:07:37.061\nI'll say Ctrl+click, undock the panel.\n\n161\n00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:38.704\nI'm just gonna move-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n162\n00:07:38.704 --> 00:07:40.212\nthen they're free floating panels,\nwhich you can go ahead and move around.\n\n163\n00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:44.646\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's free floating,\nI can just move it out of the way, okay?\n\n164\n00:07:44.646 --> 00:07:49.314\nOr I'm gonna show you one of my\nfavorite things to do to actually\n\n165\n00:07:49.314 --> 00:07:53.290\nmove things around when I\nhave two sequences, okay?\n\n166\n00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.942\nYeah, I can have multiple\nsequences open at once.\n\n167\n00:07:56.942 --> 00:08:00.500\nSo it can look back and forth between\nthe two, we actually call it the stack.\n\n168\n00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.810\nThe other thing that's interesting\nis right now, I have basically\n\n169\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:12.270\na horizontal view of all\nof the panels in here.\n\n170\n00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.090\nOkay, I could do this.\n\n171\n00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.090\nI could say, hm, yeah, this is okay.\n\n172\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:18.920\nI like all of those.\n\n173\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.759\nI'm going to keep all of those.\n\n174\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.230\nClick this, go to Panel Group Settings and\nsay, give me a Stacked Panel Group.\n\n175\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.650\nNow if I scroll down, they're\nstacked one on top of the other and\n\n176\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:32.630\nthen I open them this way.\n\n177\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.410\nI open them as a stack.\n\n178\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:36.700\n&gt;&gt; They're like accordion menus.\n\n179\n00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n180\n00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you get what we call in here\n\n181\n00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.650\na stacked menu.\n\n182\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.090\nAnd let's say, I love that.\n\n183\n00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.990\nOkay?\nAnd I love this,\n\n184\n00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.000\nand all I do is go to Window &gt; Workspaces,\nand\n\n185\n00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.900\nI say, Save as a New Workspace.\n\n186\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.990\nStop it, I'm getting used to it.\n\n187\n00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.790\n&gt;&gt; You're getting there.\n\n188\n00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.450\n&gt;&gt; Save as New Workspace\n&gt;&gt; Space, okay,\n\n189\n00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.210\nthis is also why I like hotkeys so much.\n\n190\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.970\n&gt;&gt;

Greater than.\n&gt;&gt; Greater than key again.\n\n346\n00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.838\nAnd there I am.\nI'll go over to the, it's interesting.\n\n347\n00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:11.118\nI'll go over to the program, and\n\n348\n00:17:11.118 --> 00:17:13.100\nI'll do the same things I\nwould do in the timeline.\n\n349\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:13.600\nAnd there it is.\n\n350\n00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.590\nNow, once again, these two are oversized.\n\n351\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:24.810\nBecause this is a 720, okay, 1280 by\n720 and these are like 3000 something.\n\n352\n00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:30.610\nSo I could have change them\non the side but I'm not.\n\n353\n00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.520\nI'm gonna do it here, control click and.\n\n354\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.720\nSet to Frame Size, and we're back,\nso I have plenty of space now.\n\n355\n00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.730\nSo let's say I really like,\nI could do a trim on this, and we'll do\n\n356\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.300\nanother episode, we will do a trim on\nthis, where I could technically match.\n\n357\n00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.360\nAnd make it so that it's just a cut and\nit works beautifully.\n\n358\n00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:01.420\nBut let's say I do want a transition,\nokay.\n\n359\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.160\nSo I wanna transition of some type.\n\n360\n00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.210\nI'm going to go to the Preferences.\n\n361\n00:18:09.741 --> 00:18:12.360\nAnd we're kind of looking at the change.\n\n362\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.550\nIf you're a normal user.\n\n363\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:19.240\nIf you've used this for\na while They've moved some things, okay.\n\n364\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.300\nThey moved a few things, there used\nto be a lot more in the general area.\n\n365\n00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.081\nThey're not there anymore,\nit's not in appearance okay,\n\n366\n00:18:26.081 --> 00:18:29.243\nroom auto save everybody's done\nthis knows what I'm looking for and\n\n367\n00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:32.750\nthey moved this for specific reasons,\nlike the [INAUDIBLE] and the lighter.\n\n368\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.078\n&gt;&gt; I love when they move\nthings around on you.\n\n369\n00:18:35.078 --> 00:18:37.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well it kind of made sense\n\n370\n00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.210\nthat everything moved.\n\n371\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:46.480\nAnd this is actually we talked about this\nwith Adobe, it's a timeline function.\n\n372\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.420\n&gt;&gt; So why was it in the general\nto begin with right?\n\n373\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.790\n&gt;&gt; Just because, you know why?\n\n374\n00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.760\nBecause it was the first one.\n\n375\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.230\nAnd that's what everybody went to.\n\n376\n00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.790\nSo Adobe's logic at the time was,\neverybody goes to this one,\n\n377\n00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.100\nlet's put a lot in there, okay.\n\n378\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:04.850\nNotice there's a thing called video\ntransition default duration, okay?\n\n379\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.850\nSo if I make a video transition,\nit's going to be 30 frames.\n\n380\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.740\nThat can also be set to seconds.\n\n381\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.370\nSame thing with audio.\n\n382\n00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.198\nStill images we're going\nto get into later.\n\n383\n00:19:13.198 --> 00:19:18.110\nAll right,\nnow here's an interesting thing.\n\n384\n00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:24.790\nSo, yes, when I do the default video\ntransition, do I want it to be 30 frames?\n\n385\n00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.690\nThat's kinda long.\n\n386\n00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.790\nFor the transition itself?\n\n387\n00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.070\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; For the transition itself.\n\n388\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.280\nSo I'm gonna say 15 and\nthis is for the default.\n\n389\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.930\nNow, here's the thing.\n\n390\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.740\nSet focus on the timeline\nwhen performing insert.\n\n391\n00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.930\nSo I could set that so that every\ntime I make and insert an overwrite,\n\n392\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.160\nit switches from the source to\nthe timeline being highlighted.\n\n393\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.700\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat was the thing you were pointing out,\n\n394\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.690\nsee it's not switching to the timeline.\n\n395\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of times once you insert,\n\n396\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.430\nyou're probably gonna want to go to\nthe timeline and do more stuff there.\n\n397\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.160\n&gt;&gt; Now here's a weird one.\n\n398\n00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.260\nSnap playhead in Timeline\nwhen Snap is enabled.\n\n399\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.939\nIt is currently off.\n\n400\n00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:10.690\nAnd it's like, what?\n\n401\n00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.600\nWe'll get get back to this one.\n\n402\n00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.470\nBut that tends to be confusing for\npeople, and we start doing more snapping.\n\n403\n00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.040\nThere we go.\n\n404\n00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.390\nSo, keep that in your brain.\n\n405\n00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.700\nSo, here we go, I've decided on 15 frames.\n\n406\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.920\nAnd technically all I need to do,\nmaking sure that Video 1 is highlighted.\n\n407\n00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.080\nThe Video 1 in the sequence on\nthe right side is highlighted.\n\n408\n00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.210\nI can go to Sequence and\nsay, Apply Video Transition.\n\n409\n00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.330\nThat's it, or Command+D, boom.\n\n410\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.860\nAnd I have the default transition.\n\n411\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.000\nAnd there it is.\n\n412\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.990\nSo I have the default transition.\n\n413\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.020\n&gt;&gt; Is that the dissolve?\n\n414\n00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.289\n&gt;&gt; That is the dissolve and\nhere is how you know.\n\n415\n00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:02.890\nI'm gonna go over here to the project and\nmake it big and go to Effects.\n\n416\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.920\nOver here we have Video Transitions,\nDissolve is blue,\n\n417\n00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.440\nor Cross Dissolve is blue.\n\n418\n00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.280\nWhat do you think that means?\n\n419\n00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.100\n&gt;&gt; The blue is always what's active.\n\n420\n00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.750\n&gt;&gt; That is the default transition.\n\n421\n00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.680\nYou are correct.\n\n422\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.310\nSo what I could do, if I wanted to be\nreally silly pants, is go to 3D Motion,\n\n423\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:27.460\nand say, control click, make the cube\nspin, the default transition.\n\n424\n00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.350\nLet's have some fun with that.\n\n425\n00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.430\nI could come back here.\n\n426\n00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.280\nLet me stretch this out\nusing the plus sign.\n\n427\n00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.070\nGrab the cross dissolve, delete it.\n\n428\n00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.060\nCome back here, Sequence.\n\n429\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.660\nLive video transition, okay.\n\n430\n00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.020\nIt's on there now.\n\n431\n00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.130\nJust like it was before.\n\n432\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:48.860\nGot a red line.\n\n433\n00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.330\nBut watch.\n\n434\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.170\nThis is so done emery.\n\n435\n00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:54.733\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n436\n00:21:54.733 --> 00:21:55.481\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n437\n00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n438\n00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.590\nthe reason I do this is because\nyou can change some of this.\n\n439\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.779\nNow we do have a red line,\n\n440\n00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:04.207\nsome people who've worked in\nthat means you're rendered.\n\n441\n00:22:04.207 --> 00:22:05.510\nYou have to render that.\n\n442\n00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.800\nNot necessarily.\n\n443\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.560\nThat can wait to the end cuz it's still\nplaying back, but you can create it,\n\n444\n00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.040\nwhich creates a video preview,\nwhich you'll get a video preview file.\n\n445\n00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.770\n&gt;&gt; But normally the red would say, you\nhave to render this now before moving on?\n\n446\n00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.080\nIs that what it means?\n\n447\n00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.550\n&gt;&gt; It means that this is taxing\nthe processor a little bit.\n\n448\n00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.610\nOkay and\nit would be best if you did it, but\n\n449\n00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:29.230\nif your processor's fast enough you don't\nhave to worry that you can keep working.\n\n450\n00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.630\n&gt;&gt; And so it's almost like a warning\nif you're not seeing it the way you're\n\n451\n00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:33.720\nthinking it's suppose to see.\n\n452\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.710\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; Because you're-\n\n453\n00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.270\n&gt;&gt; It's a little jumpy it's like why I\n\n454\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.940\ndo render it, and the interesting\nthing is it's just the return key\n\n455\n00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.590\n&gt;&gt; Hit the Return key and\n\n456\n00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.780\nit will start the render.\n\n457\n00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.930\nSo if I hit the Return key,\nthere you go, boom done.\n\n458\n00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:45.980\n&gt;&gt; That's easy.\n\n459\n00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's no problem at all.\n\n460\n00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.610\nNow what if I want to\nadjust the cube spin?\n\n461\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.920\nOne way is I could double-click it,\nand there's the duration time.\n\n462\n00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.090\nAnd I could say,\nlet's go back to 30 seconds.\n\n463\n00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.500\n&gt;&gt; Now, now its 30 seconds\nlong it needs to be rendered.\n\n464\n00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.890\nThis is why in many cases you don't\njust jump straight into rendering\n\n465\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.290\nevery single time you see the red line or\n\n466\n00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.060\nyou are going to create a bunch of preview\nfiles and that takes up some space.\n\n467\n00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.890\n&gt;&gt; If your going to be doing\ntransitions between multiple\n\n468\n00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:16.790\nsequences\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n469\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.010\n&gt;&gt; or segments\n\n470\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:18.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n471\n00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.519\n&gt;&gt; or clips.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You're gonna need to\n\n472\n00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:22.236\nmake sure you do it at the very end.\n\n473\n00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:24.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, or you be like me.\n\n474\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.280\nYeah, I made a bunch of previews.\n\n475\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.610\nI'm gonna clear them out and redoing them.\n\n476\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.950\n&gt;&gt; Cuz rendering can\ntake some time sometimes.\n\n477\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.510\n&gt;&gt; They can take some time.\n\n478\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:35.829\nThe other thing I can do is if I highlight\nit, I could go to Effects Controls.\n\n479\n00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.070\nAnd it gives me a menu\nof what I need to do.\n\n480\n00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.200\nAnd it gives me star previews.\n\n481\n00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.090\nImage A and it's like all this.\n\n482\n00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.818\nImage A spins to reveal image B.\n\n483\n00:23:49.818 --> 00:23:51.130\nMathtitude faces of a cube.\n\n484\n00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:55.255\nAnd you say to yourself,\nI'm having a hard time understanding that.\n\n485\n00:23:55.255 --> 00:23:56.930\nShow me the actual sources.\n\n486\n00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:02.540\nAnd you can adjust its time,\nyou can also adjust how it spins.\n\n487\n00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.770\nLike right now, it'll say west to east,\neast to west, I can say south to north.\n\n488\n00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:14.110\nSo now it does it that way, or it does\nit east to west, or north to south.\n\n489\n00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:18.160\nAnd I can completely adjust how\nI want this cube spin to happen.\n\n490\n00:24:20.456 --> 00:24:23.370\nNow I don't have to do the default, okay?\n\n491\n00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:28.520\nI don't have to do the default cube spin,\nI could simply click it, delete it.\n\n492\n00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.680\nI can come over here\nto the transitions and\n\n493\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.350\nsay, you know what,\ngive me a film dissolve.\n\n494\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.810\nClick it, drag it right on top,\nand let go, and\n\n495\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.690\nof course the default duration is 15.\n\n496\n00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.280\nWhat most people don't understand,\n\n497\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:52.210\nis if you go back to Preferences and\nin this case Timeline.\n\n498\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:25:00.430\nAnd if I change this to 35 frames,\nnothing in the timeline changes.\n\n499\n00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.150\nIt will not change all of my times\n\n500\n00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.980\nthat I've already set on transitions\nin the timeline, it doesn't do that.\n\n501\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.930\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they're already on\nthe stage as I'm referring to it.\n\n502\n00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Everything from here on out.\n\n503\n00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.890\n&gt;&gt; Out, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Will be 35 frames,\n\n504\n00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:22.440\neverything from here on out will be 35\nframes, so it's easy to really do that.\n\n505\n00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.740\nNow here's a little trick,\nlet's say somebody says,\n\n506\n00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.090\ndissolves are great, I love dissolves.\n\n507\n00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:33.960\nIt's like, okay, terrific,\nwe'll make this large, okay.\n\n508\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.720\nAnd so, if I highlight both of these and\nthen hit Cmd+D,\n\n509\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.570\nbecause all the segments are highlighted,\n\n510\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:48.060\nit finds every single cut and\nputs a transition there.\n\n511\n00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz Cmd+D was applied transition.\n\n512\n00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:51.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n513\n00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.220\napplied everything it said,\nin, out, in, out.\n\n514\n00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.020\n&gt;&gt; In, out, in, out, and so now it's\ndoing it on every single transition.\n\n515\n00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.274\nPlease don't do this [LAUGH] after awhile\nit's kinda like, please don't do this.\n\n516\n00:26:01.274 --> 00:26:02.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Please don't do this.\n\n517\n00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.716\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is like the slide\ntransitions in PowerPoint,\n\n518\n00:26:05.716 --> 00:26:09.662\nit's like you can do one, and if you\nkeep going, everyone's gonna be like,\n\n519\n00:26:09.662 --> 00:26:11.199\nI'm getting sick right now.\n\n520\n00:26:11.199 --> 00:26:12.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or the thing is,\n\n521\n00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.020\nif you put a dissolve on every cut,\n\n522\n00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.570\nthat means your ten second\nvideo just took two years.\n\n523\n00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:21.590\nCuz it's like, it's a time and\nit's like, okay goodnight, but yeah.\n\n524\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.120\nSo this is editing transitions,\nand transitions are real fun,\n\n525\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.660\nthey're really easy, and\nthey're very easy to manipulate.\n\n526\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.670\nSo yeah they can step up what\nyou're doing quite a bit.\n\n527\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.440\n&gt;&gt; And\nthey have a nice library obviously and\n\n528\n00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.910\nfor different reasons why you\nmight wanna use the cube one.\n\n529\n00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.490\nAnd what is your audience and\n\n530\n00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.060\nthat kind of whole idea about why\nI'd wanna pick this particular one.\n\n531\n00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.310\n&gt;&gt; And the other thing about transitions,\n\n532\n00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.420\nwhen you talk to somebody that\nwants to you add transitions.\n\n533\n00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.770\nTell them every time you add\na transition like a dissolve or\n\n534\n00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:52.735\ncube spin you are absolutely\ndrawing attention to the change.\n\n535\n00:26:52.735 --> 00:26:58.740\nIt's like there's a change happening here\nand I want you to specifically see it.\n\n536\n00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.210\nSometimes in editing we want\nit to be invisible, but\n\n537\n00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.580\nthis is very much, here it is.\n\n538\n00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:08.330\nCube spin, whatever, I want you to\nknow there is a change happening.\n\n539\n00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, well speaking of changes\nit looks like we're out of time for\n\n540\n00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:13.940\nthis particular episode.\n\n541\n00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.360\nSo we're gonna transition out, and\n\n542\n00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.020\ngo ahead [LAUGH] did you\nsee what I did there?\n\n543\n00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.090\n&gt;&gt; I did, I did see what you did.\n\n544\n00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.960\n&gt;&gt; That was my cube spin.\n\n545\n00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.850\n&gt;&gt; I love it, I love it.\n\n546\n00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] yes.\n&gt;&gt; Your cube spinning out.\n\n547\n00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.260\n&gt;&gt; Well it was a lot of great information\nand I'm super excited to see what's next.\n\n548\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.750\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; But for now, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n549\n00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.950\nsign off for CreativeProTV,\n\n550\n00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.504\nI've been your host Vonne Smith\n&gt;&gt; I'm James Biddle.\n\n551\n00:27:32.504 --> 00:27:34.300\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n552\n00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.667\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\nexciting edition of CreativeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:19.795\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\nwe're continuing on with our series for\n\n5\n00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:22.054\nAdobe Premiere Pro CC 2017.\n\n6\n00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:25.847\nAnd in the studios with us yet\nagain is our amazing James Biddle.\n\n7\n00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:26.939\nSo glad to have you back.\n\n8\n00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.849\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate the fact that you tried\nto throw me out though, Saturday.\n\n9\n00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.145\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nwe had to bring you back because-\n\n10\n00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:32.838\n&gt;&gt; I know, okay.\n\n11\n00:00:32.838 --> 00:00:34.406\n&gt;&gt; We have to talk about trimming and\nsome other things, so-\n\n12\n00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:35.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n13\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.748\nA lot of people,\nwhen they get into editing,\n\n14\n00:00:37.748 --> 00:00:41.185\nthey may talk to editors like myself\nthat have done this for a long time.\n\n15\n00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:44.840\nThey'll be talking about, well,\nit's all the trimming is the art.\n\n16\n00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.444\nAnd it's like, it is, but\nit's very off putting.\n\n17\n00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:49.168\n[LAUGH] We were like, I'm scared.\n\n18\n00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:52.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's like, you're awful.\n\n19\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.150\nBut I don't blame you.\n\n20\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.850\nSo this one,\n\n21\n00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.930\nwe're gonna go really in depth in how to\ntighten up what you got in your sequence,\n\n22\n00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.040\nand feel comfortable doing it with\neither the mouse, or with your hands.\n\n23\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.344\nSo we're going back to\nthe watermelon shot, okay.\n\n24\n00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:11.187\nNow, in the watermelon shot\nI'm looking for things.\n\n25\n00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:15.208\nIf you wanna get into film theory,\nI'm looking for movement.\n\n26\n00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.320\nI'm looking for movement,\nI'm just gonna hit L and move forward.\n\n27\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.551\nAnd there I have, yeah.\n\n28\n00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:22.160\nI mean, yep, that is movement, I know.\n\n29\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.972\nBut then I do this thing with my finger,\nI tap it with my finger.\n\n30\n00:01:26.972 --> 00:01:28.823\nAnd then I'm going to\nhit the Down Arrow Key,\n\n31\n00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:31.130\nwhich is going to take\nme to the next edit.\n\n32\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.160\nAnd move forward, and\nyeah, I've got motion but\n\n33\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.380\nthe big motion is right\nthere at the knife.\n\n34\n00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.740\nSo I'm thinking to myself, can I connect\nthe finger movement to the knife to\n\n35\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.320\nmake this a little bit more dynamic and\nquote unquote, invisible.\n\n36\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.950\nI'm connecting two different motions.\n\n37\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.120\nNow here's one way to do this, and\nI absolutely love this in Adobe.\n\n38\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.652\nSo I hit L, move forward.\n\n39\n00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.600\nNow it's not gonna be super precise.\n\n40\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.879\nI'm not looking for\nsuper precise right now.\n\n41\n00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:07.836\nRight there on that motion,\nI'm gonna hit just one key, and\n\n42\n00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.630\nit's going to be the W key.\n\n43\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.644\nAnd what's gonna happen is this, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:14.644 --> 00:02:18.474\nIt's going to, and this is [LAUGH]\nthis is the way Adobe says it.\n\n45\n00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:21.210\nIt's really funny,\nI love the way they name things.\n\n46\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.520\nIt's going to Ripple Trim from\nthe play head to the next edit.\n\n47\n00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.670\nOr as I like to say, get rid of that.\n\n48\n00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.725\nGet rid of everything from there to there,\nokay?\n\n49\n00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:36.955\nAnd that is W.\n\n50\n00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:39.269\n&gt;&gt; How come they fancy\nup a really simple like-\n\n51\n00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.051\n&gt;&gt; Well, [CROSSTALK] technically\n\n52\n00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:44.069\nthey're being absolutely\nprecise in what it does.\n\n53\n00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.046\nThey're being absolutely precise, where\nme it's like, eh, let's get rid of that.\n\n54\n00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:50.510\n[LAUGH] It's like-\n&gt;&gt; But it's those technical terminology\n\n55\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.370\nwithin a specific application\nof using all those big words-\n\n56\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.999\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n57\n00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.916\n&gt;&gt; That that's what they\nare technically called.\n\n58\n00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:59.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz what most people do,\nis they'd take the Blade Tool,\n\n59\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.826\nthey'd make a cut, and\nthen they'd highlight the piece of this.\n\n60\n00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:04.010\nLet me demonstrate what\nmost people would do.\n\n61\n00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.020\nOkay, so I'll go forward now, and\n\n62\n00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.080\nwhat I wanna do is kinda connect\nit to the cutting of the knife.\n\n63\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.676\nI want it in a little bit, okay,\nright before that little snap.\n\n64\n00:03:13.676 --> 00:03:18.181\nAnd again, I can hold down K and\ntap J and go back a frame at a time.\n\n65\n00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:22.080\nSo right about there is\nwhat I'm looking for.\n\n66\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.232\nNow most people would do this,\nthey would go over here.\n\n67\n00:03:24.232 --> 00:03:26.370\nThey would get their favorite friend,\nthe razor tool.\n\n68\n00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.720\nThey'd cut along here.\n\n69\n00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.880\nAnd then they're cutting.\n\n70\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.150\nAnd then let's make sure.\n\n71\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.476\nI forgot to do the thing where\nI made sure they were linked.\n\n72\n00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:37.617\nAnd I'll cut it again.\n\n73\n00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.580\nAnd then I'll come over here and get this.\n\n74\n00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.410\nAnd then I'll hit Delete, and then\nI'll pick it up and I'll move it here.\n\n75\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.040\nAnd that took forever.\n\n76\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.894\nSo let me Cmd+Z back.\n\n77\n00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.957\n&gt;&gt; So all of those steps that you just\ndid, with the cut and the delete and\n\n78\n00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:54.915\nthe move,\nis all done with the Ripple something.\n\n79\n00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:56.522\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now in this case,\n\n80\n00:03:56.522 --> 00:04:02.376\nthe one on the opposite, the letter on\nthe opposite side of W on the keypad is Q,\n\n81\n00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:06.630\nand that is ripple trim from\nplay head to previous edit.\n\n82\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.637\nSo now, this is the previous edit.\n\n83\n00:04:07.637 --> 00:04:09.227\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\nthat's what you said, that thing.\n\n84\n00:04:09.227 --> 00:04:11.810\n&gt;&gt; That's the one, and then I just go Q.\n\n85\n00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.730\nAnd everything that took me all\nthose steps, I just did in one.\n\n86\n00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.652\n&gt;&gt; So W is forward, Q is-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n87\n00:04:20.652 --> 00:04:24.809\nso let's take a look at\nthe play head here, okay.\n\n88\n00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:26.725\nYes, W-\n&gt;&gt; From the play head I get-\n\n89\n00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.861\n&gt;&gt; From the play head to the next\n\n90\n00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:30.520\nedit is W.\n\n91\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.950\nFrom the play head to\nthe previous edit is Q.\n\n92\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I guess in my brain forward\non the timeline, backward on the timeline.\n\n93\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.689\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, the term that we\nactually use is downstream.\n\n94\n00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.210\nIf we are going from left to\nright were going downstream.\n\n95\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.642\nIf we're going right to left, upstream.\n\n96\n00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:53.820\nAnd most of what we do when we\ncreate a sequence is go downstream.\n\n97\n00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.869\nSo now lets a look at this, there it is.\n\n98\n00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:02.325\nI always wanna do a Werner Herzog\nwhen I'm looking at my own work.\n\n99\n00:05:02.325 --> 00:05:03.669\nIt's lovely.\n\n100\n00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.098\nSee, so now,\nit does not know that it is going to be\n\n101\n00:05:08.098 --> 00:05:11.271\nkilled in the bright, bright sun.\n\n102\n00:05:11.271 --> 00:05:14.504\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not knowing that one single tap\n\n103\n00:05:14.504 --> 00:05:16.670\nwill lead to its demise.\n\n104\n00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.547\nAnd that's the thing, that's a trim,\n\n105\n00:05:19.547 --> 00:05:23.280\nis I cut two actions that\nare completely different.\n\n106\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.270\nTapping on it and\ncutting it, two different.\n\n107\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.460\nBut it makes it, I don't know, we're\ngonna talk about color correction later.\n\n108\n00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.042\nBut it makes it seamless, it doesn't\ndraw attention to it like a transition.\n\n109\n00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:34.930\nOkay, it doesn't.\n\n110\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.419\nIt's like all of a sudden,\nboom, there it is.\n\n111\n00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.780\nAnd this is a great technique.\n\n112\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.360\nNow somebody like me,\nI might say, not enough frames.\n\n113\n00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.088\nI really wanna get that connection\nin there and you do this a lot when\n\n114\n00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:52.810\nyou work with actors and\nreaction shots and timing on that.\n\n115\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:00.840\nSo here's how we can do that either\nwith a mouse or with hot keys, okay.\n\n116\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.590\nWe go into what is called trimming mode,\nand it's really easy.\n\n117\n00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.130\nThink about it this way.\n\n118\n00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.810\nRight now you're in editing mode,\nyou would like to shift to trim mode.\n\n119\n00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.768\nSo if I hold down the Shift key and hit T,\n\n120\n00:06:14.768 --> 00:06:18.007\nI am now in what is called trim mode,\nokay?\n\n121\n00:06:18.007 --> 00:06:22.561\nAnd I have what's known as a rolling edit,\nall right?\n\n122\n00:06:22.561 --> 00:06:27.479\nLet me squeeze that up a little bit, cool.\n\n123\n00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.750\nI have what's called a rolling edit.\n\n124\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.050\nAnd what is happening is it's showing me,\nsometimes when you zoom it up,\n\n125\n00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.060\nit happens like this.\n\n126\n00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.275\nIt's showing me this side,\nokay, often called the A side.\n\n127\n00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:40.572\nAnd it's showing me the B side.\n\n128\n00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:42.443\nSo this is where they connect.\n\n129\n00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:48.599\nIf I have a rolling edit, which in\nthis case this is a solid blue bar,\n\n130\n00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:52.379\nthat means every time\nI decide to go back or\n\n131\n00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.268\nforward, it's doing both sides, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:56.268 --> 00:07:00.375\nIf you see it down here,\nyou can see, I'll do five.\n\n133\n00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:01.431\nI'll go back five.\n\n134\n00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:04.329\nSee, it's doing both,\n\n135\n00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:09.164\nwhich in some cases can be advantageous.\n\n136\n00:07:09.164 --> 00:07:12.730\nBut it's not helping with the action.\n\n137\n00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:19.410\nI need to trim one side, and then trim the\nother side, okay, to make it hit properly.\n\n138\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.811\nSo the way I do that is I simply come up\nhere and say, I'll just do this side.\n\n139\n00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:25.991\nThis side is not gonna move, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:25.991 --> 00:07:30.726\nAnd what I'm looking to do is just like,\ngo back, Yeah,\n\n141\n00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:32.560\nright there where I can see that.\n\n142\n00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.866\nI'll move to this side and\nthen say, all right,\n\n143\n00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:45.282\nlet's go back a little bit, right there.\n\n144\n00:07:45.282 --> 00:07:47.757\nRight there is the pop, okay.\n\n145\n00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:51.210\nNow I don't have to do it with these,\nokay.\n\n146\n00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.289\nI know this is a little bit\nof finger gymnastics, but\n\n147\n00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:57.711\nif I do Shift, Option, okay.\n\n148\n00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:02.643\nIf I do Option and then left,\nright arrow, I'm doing five at a time.\n\n149\n00:08:02.643 --> 00:08:07.540\nIf I just do option left right, I'm doing\none at a time, and I can do it this way.\n\n150\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.988\n&gt;&gt; So it's the same as you\nwere doing the buttons,\n\n151\n00:08:10.988 --> 00:08:12.325\nyou're just doing with the keyboard.\n\n152\n00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.800\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'm doing with the keyboard.\n\n153\n00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:20.080\nAnd then a lot of people go okay,\nsmart guy, how do I switch sides?\n\n154\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.330\n&gt;&gt; Like going from the left to the right.\n\n155\n00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how do you do that?\n\n156\n00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.520\nAnd I'm like,\nI love it when people do that.\n\n157\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.080\nI'm like, that's a great question.\n\n158\n00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.800\nI Shift+T to get into trim mode,\nif I hold down Ctrl and\n\n159\n00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.630\ntap T, it goes through and chooses.\n\n160\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.310\nNow there are technically five\nstates of being, okay, and\n\n161\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.330\nI will show you down here.\n\n162\n00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.747\nLet me go back into Shift+T.\n\n163\n00:08:44.747 --> 00:08:46.260\nSo we go Ctrl+T.\n\n164\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.250\nThere is rip on this side,\nrip on that side.\n\n165\n00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.860\nThen we have a new thing.\n\n166\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.650\nThis was introduced\na couple of versions ago.\n\n167\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.396\nThis is called an overwrite trim.\n\n168\n00:08:55.396 --> 00:09:00.737\nSingle side, override trim,\nother side, single side.\n\n169\n00:09:00.737 --> 00:09:02.084\nAnd then back to the rolling.\n\n170\n00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:07.370\nSo if I do Ctrl+T, there I am,\nI'm ripple trimming on this side again.\n\n171\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.795\nI could do option left right,\nokay, to get what I want.\n\n172\n00:09:11.795 --> 00:09:15.870\nCtrl+T again, do the other side.\n\n173\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.790\nNow you may say to yourself,\nso what does this thing do?\n\n174\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.130\nI'm gonna zoom in on it.\n\n175\n00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.630\nThis is specifically asked for\nby certain people because,\n\n176\n00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.625\nas we saw with the rolling trim,\nit does both sides at the same time.\n\n177\n00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:34.269\nBut some people might say I need to do\nthis but I don't want it to ripple.\n\n178\n00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:36.899\nThe reason we call it\nripple is you'll notice,\n\n179\n00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:39.680\nwhen I do one thing everything\nhas to ripple down.\n\n180\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.110\nIt's like dropping a pebble in the water\nand everything ripples outward for\n\n181\n00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.380\na single side.\n\n182\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.570\nAnd some people will say,\nI don't want that to happen.\n\n183\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.680\nI need to do a single side but\nI don't want that to happen.\n\n184\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.726\nSo they came up with this concept\nknown as the overwrite trim.\n\n185\n00:09:55.726 --> 00:09:58.021\nIf I do option, right, watch what happens.\n\n186\n00:10:00.336 --> 00:10:01.770\n&gt;&gt; The other thing stays in place.\n\n187\n00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.880\n&gt;&gt; Everything stays in place and\nwhat it's doing is it's leaving a gap.\n\n188\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.970\nOr in this case I'd like to say it's\nadding filler is what it's doing.\n\n189\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.160\nThat's not really empty space, okay.\n\n190\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.830\nThat's like when we used to do film,\nyou couldn't just cut something out and\n\n191\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.680\nthen link the two ends,\nyou had to put in black film in between.\n\n192\n00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.560\nSo that's what this is doing,\nand in some cases this works.\n\n193\n00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.520\nIf somebody says, I need to trim this\nside, I don't need anything to move,\n\n194\n00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.990\nI'll put in something later,\nwe'll figure it out later.\n\n195\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.470\nAnd that's how that works.\n\n196\n00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.650\nSo that's why, when it's the red one,\nI'm just putting it back.\n\n197\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.720\nOkay, putting it back, putting you back.\n\n198\n00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.585\nThere we go, trim blocked.\n\n199\n00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:42.590\nTrim's blocked because I've doing\na single side and I can't go any further.\n\n200\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.738\nI can't-\n&gt;&gt; You've hit the wall.\n\n201\n00:10:43.738 --> 00:10:46.940\n&gt;&gt; I can't push it, especially on\nan overwrite, its like I can't do it.\n\n202\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:52.040\nSo I'll switch sides again,\nCtrl+T, all right, cool.\n\n203\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.250\nSwitch again, now I can do the ripple one.\n\n204\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.400\n&gt;&gt; And that was the five states\nthat you just went through.\n\n205\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.354\n&gt;&gt; Right, now some people will say, okay,\nbut I don't like this thing you're doing.\n\n206\n00:11:01.354 --> 00:11:06.038\nI don't like, okay, I don't like it.\n\n207\n00:11:06.038 --> 00:11:10.991\nOkay, notice how these right now, okay,\n\n208\n00:11:10.991 --> 00:11:15.010\nyou can switch these, okay.\n\n209\n00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.039\nI can switch them once I click it.\n\n210\n00:11:19.773 --> 00:11:22.880\nIt's not easy though,\n[LAUGH] that's the problem.\n\n211\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.488\nYou add a modifier and\nit should switch, and there it is.\n\n212\n00:11:26.488 --> 00:11:34.360\nIt is Option+Cmd, so you have to\nOption+Cmd, okay, and then click.\n\n213\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.950\nSo it can be a little frustrating,\nit does work.\n\n214\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.900\nBut you hold down Option+Cmd and\nthen click and you get the choice.\n\n215\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.530\n&gt;&gt; This becomes like the muscle memory of\nyou kinda get what I call guitar mode.\n\n216\n00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.730\nWhere your hands are kinda like this,\nlike-\n\n217\n00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.070\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how I make that chord,\n\n218\n00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:49.690\nI just make it.\n\n219\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah and it's one of those things.\n\n220\n00:11:51.615 --> 00:11:54.068\nI don't use this a lot but\nyeah it's Option+Cmd.\n\n221\n00:11:54.068 --> 00:11:58.340\nAnd all I have to do is get in there,\nclick this side.\n\n222\n00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.200\nAnd then say actually I wanted a ripple,\nOption+Cmd.\n\n223\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.820\n&gt;&gt; And this seems like a lot\nof things to remember.\n\n224\n00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.740\nBut when you're doing this day in and\nday out, like every single time.\n\n225\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.359\nYou just kind of [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; If you generally done it five times,\n\n226\n00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:15.734\nyou're okay\n&gt;&gt; You're okay when you've generally done\n\n227\n00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:17.541\nit like five times, snd then you know it.\n\n228\n00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:20.340\nI know all the hotkeys\nto make this happen.\n\n229\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.061\nThat's all I do, so\nI do it all the time, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:23.061 --> 00:12:26.027\nAnd yeah, and it's neat and\nit's funny to get the rolling,\n\n231\n00:12:27.926 --> 00:12:31.260\nI just put it dead center and\nnow I've got the roller again.\n\n232\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.612\nThe other thing that Adobe has done\nthat's very convenient that's very,\n\n233\n00:12:34.612 --> 00:12:38.490\nvery cool They've added this.\n\n234\n00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.180\nApply default transition.\n\n235\n00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:47.335\nSo if somebody says, I like that trim but\ncan I see it with the cube spin?\n\n236\n00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:51.030\nYou just go, okay, boom,\nand it's added it for you.\n\n237\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.850\nSo it's really convenient.\n\n238\n00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.620\nAnd then I'll just say, okay, go away.\n\n239\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.850\nAnd you just Cmd+Z and make it go away.\n\n240\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.050\nSo this is essential trimming.\n\n241\n00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.760\nAnd that what you're trying to do is\nyou're trying to tighten this up.\n\n242\n00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.720\nYou're really trying to say okay, yeah.\n\n243\n00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.420\nI want just as that finger is\ncoming down and you can preview it.\n\n244\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.083\nAll you have to do hit the space bar,okay.\n\n245\n00:13:18.187 --> 00:13:20.010\nOkay, and you hit the space bar.\n\n246\n00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:26.810\nNow some people, waiting like\nthat drives them absolutely nuts.\n\n247\n00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:32.710\nSo if I come over to Preferences,\nthere's a thing called Trim.\n\n248\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.450\nAnd there is the trim\noffset by five frames.\n\n249\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.190\nThat means when I hit the Shift or\n\n250\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.340\nif I do five frames, I can make\nit ten frames, things like that.\n\n251\n00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.060\nNow, the thing that's interesting is,\n\n252\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:49.100\nthe thing that you're looking for\nisn't actually in Trim.\n\n253\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.080\nWhich is weird, but not necessarily.\n\n254\n00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.132\nSync Settings, no, no.\n\n255\n00:13:57.132 --> 00:14:01.944\nWhat I'm looking for is in Playback\nbecause most people do this in Trim, but\n\n256\n00:14:01.944 --> 00:14:04.140\nthis is a Playback thing.\n\n257\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.950\nWhat it's doing when I hit the space\nbar is it goes back three seconds,\n\n258\n00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.310\ngoes through the Trim edit point.\n\n259\n00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.957\nAnd then forward two seconds.\n\n260\n00:14:12.957 --> 00:14:15.809\nSome people will say, that's too long,\nI'll say, okay, fine,\n\n261\n00:14:15.809 --> 00:14:16.820\nI'll make one and one.\n\n262\n00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.556\nI'll make it one and one, and\nnow when I do to preview, watch this.\n\n263\n00:14:24.903 --> 00:14:31.680\nSo it's faster, and I can also tell\nthat does not hit at the right spot.\n\n264\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.700\nCome on, come on, come on,\ncome on, come on, yeah, right.\n\n265\n00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.580\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n266\n00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.484\nSee I'm going too fast.\n\n267\n00:14:38.484 --> 00:14:39.378\nBoom.\n\n268\n00:14:41.055 --> 00:14:44.750\nThat works, that works.\n\n269\n00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.878\nWhat if you don't like the Trim tool?\n\n270\n00:14:46.878 --> 00:14:50.300\nCuz there are some people that\nabsolutely hate the Trim tool.\n\n271\n00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.079\nThey'll be like, fine,\nthis is great and all but I hate it.\n\n272\n00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:56.900\nIt's like, okay, I get it.\n\n273\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.990\nYeah, you can do it down\nhere just by highlighting.\n\n274\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.870\nSo if I highlight that edit\nwithout using the Trim tool,\n\n275\n00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.010\nI can still Cmd+T and go around, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.046\nI could still do that.\n\n277\n00:15:09.046 --> 00:15:11.620\nThe trade-off is this.\n\n278\n00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:18.520\nIf I start trimming hotkey style,\nI don't get to see it up there.\n\n279\n00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:24.055\nHowever, if I drag it with a mouse,\nit will give me the two screen.\n\n280\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.517\nSo they're basically saying,\nif you're going dedicated,\n\n281\n00:15:27.517 --> 00:15:30.820\nyou're gonna do this with a mouse,\nyou gotta do it with the mouse.\n\n282\n00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.750\nIf you do it with the hotkeys,\nyou won't see it up in the top screen, but\n\n283\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.600\ndown here you will.\n\n284\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:40.260\nAnd so yeah, I can trim down here, and\nI can switch sides, do what I want,\n\n285\n00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.670\ndo the command thing option and\nget what I need.\n\n286\n00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.370\nGo through there,\nabsolutely, not a problem.\n\n287\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.250\nNow, do I have loop playback?\n\n288\n00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.165\nYes, that's absolutely a hotkey.\n\n289\n00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.330\nOne of the most amazing keys in here is K.\n\n290\n00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.776\nNow we know that that's shuttle pause.\n\n291\n00:16:02.776 --> 00:16:07.688\nOne thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ndrop an in point and an out point.\n\n292\n00:16:07.688 --> 00:16:10.686\nAnd show the difference between the two.\n\n293\n00:16:10.686 --> 00:16:13.829\nIn that, a lot of people when they\nreview what they are doing, and\n\n294\n00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:15.900\nI bet you've seen a lot\nof editors do that.\n\n295\n00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.890\nThey want to go back.\n\n296\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.440\nWhat they do is they take their play\nhead and they pull it back, hit play.\n\n297\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.550\nPull it back, hit play.\n\n298\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.913\nPull it back, hit play.\n\n299\n00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.716\nShift+K.\n\n300\n00:16:26.716 --> 00:16:31.549\nThe modifier of Shift+K will\nactually let you preview the edit\n\n301\n00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:36.610\nthat you've just trimmed with\nthe same playback timing.\n\n302\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.350\n&gt;&gt; Like the preferences that we just did.\n\n303\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, so it's the same thing, okay?\n\n304\n00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.170\nIf you like to do that, all you have to\ndo is hit Shift+K and you'll do that.\n\n305\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:50.420\nNow, if I hit Option+K, it only plays\nbetween the in and the out point.\n\n306\n00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.490\nSo I can set it up to do that for\nsomebody to review things.\n\n307\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.740\nAnd they'll say can you play it again?\n\n308\n00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.420\nSure, Option+K.\n\n309\n00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.770\nThat's why K is one of those keys that\nI absolutely love because it does some\n\n310\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.340\nreally cool stuff.\n\n311\n00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.579\nAnd it is the Shift+K\nthat I use most often.\n\n312\n00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:11.110\nAnd notice, look at that,\nit's the Shift+K where it is right now.\n\n313\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.760\nIt always does it where it is at the time.\n\n314\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.710\nSo if I go back to the edit,\nShift+K, it goes around.\n\n315\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:21.230\n&gt;&gt; I can see how these little things,\nlike the setting the end points.\n\n316\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.084\nThis is what I need to do because you're\ngoing to have directors or editors or\n\n317\n00:17:25.084 --> 00:17:27.390\npeople that are looking\nover your shoulder.\n\n318\n00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.410\nLet me see that again, let me see that\nagain, and you don't wanna take that.\n\n319\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.770\nIt might take 20 seconds for\nyou to get to where you need to go,\n\n320\n00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.560\nbut it's that 20 seconds of them going.\n\n321\n00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.200\n&gt;&gt; Really, honestly, the faster you can\ndo this, it keeps you in the story.\n\n322\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.280\nIt keeps you thinking about the story\ninstead of, how do I do a trim?\n\n323\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.190\nIt also keeps the person that's over\nyour shoulder sort of confident in you.\n\n324\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.870\nI mean, I've had some people, they'll do\nit, and if I do something in like one key,\n\n325\n00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.720\nthey're just like.\n\n326\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.750\nAnd then they're like,\n\n327\n00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.450\nokay, you know this-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.070\n&gt;&gt; And we\n\n329\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.810\nconcentrate on the story instead of,\nhow good am I at the software.\n\n330\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n331\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.071\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like the,\n\n332\n00:18:03.071 --> 00:18:05.889\nlet me show you this thing on my,\nwait, wait, hold on.\n\n333\n00:18:05.889 --> 00:18:08.042\nHold, on, let me get the, wait-\n&gt;&gt; Wait-\n\n334\n00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:08.967\n&gt;&gt; Hold on, let me get that, and\n\n335\n00:18:08.967 --> 00:18:11.700\nthen the person you're just like,\nI've lost my interest.\n\n336\n00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.370\n&gt;&gt; Think of it like, have you ever\nreceived a phone call and somebody needs\n\n337\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:19.560\nto ask you a series of questions and\nthey don't have the questions prepared.\n\n338\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.410\nIt's like, I've got them here some place.\n\n339\n00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.562\nAnd you're just, please,\nI want to go home.\n\n340\n00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's yeah, and that's,\n\n341\n00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:27.622\nyeah, it's the same thing.\n\n342\n00:18:27.622 --> 00:18:28.641\n&gt;&gt; Just get to the point.\n\n343\n00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:31.672\n&gt;&gt; Just get to the point.\nBut Q and W, Q and W can be great in,\n\n344\n00:18:31.672 --> 00:18:38.420\nthat if you just need to make little\nsimple trims, okay those, perfect.\n\n345\n00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.570\nOkay, absolutely perfect.\n\n346\n00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.325\nLet me show you one other thing that\na lot of people don't know about.\n\n347\n00:18:43.325 --> 00:18:47.755\nOkay, I'm gonna go back into\ntrim mode with Shift+T, okay?\n\n348\n00:18:47.755 --> 00:18:52.245\nAnd I will switch, I'm gonna do\nthe Ctrl+T and switch over to this side.\n\n349\n00:18:52.245 --> 00:18:56.545\nNow when I loop, okay,\nwe're in trim mode now,\n\n350\n00:18:56.545 --> 00:19:00.125\nso space bar now means\nloop around the edit.\n\n351\n00:19:02.045 --> 00:19:07.566\nAnd some people say, this occasionally\nhappens where we get a little fudge up.\n\n352\n00:19:07.566 --> 00:19:08.510\n&gt;&gt; Green?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n353\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.274\nit's because we're sizing it up for\nthe screen.\n\n354\n00:19:12.274 --> 00:19:16.082\nOccasionally it's just a response to that.\n\n355\n00:19:16.082 --> 00:19:19.606\nGuess what J-K-L does now?\n\n356\n00:19:19.606 --> 00:19:24.007\nIf I hold down K and tap J, it trims.\n\n357\n00:19:24.007 --> 00:19:25.431\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we're in trim mode?\n\n358\n00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:29.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, so technically then\nyou're saying, wait a minute.\n\n359\n00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.790\nSo if I just tap J it trims in real time?\n\n360\n00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.200\nYes, it does.\n\n361\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.814\nSo I can say, [SOUND] right there.\n\n362\n00:19:36.814 --> 00:19:38.350\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Boom, and then I can just do.\n\n363\n00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:44.090\nSo I know a lot of people,\ninstead of doing the option,\n\n364\n00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:48.216\nleft, right, all that, they just go J-K-L.\n\n365\n00:19:48.216 --> 00:19:49.189\nIf you're in trim mode.\n\n366\n00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.629\n&gt;&gt; If you're in trim mode.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz J-K-L in the other place that we\n\n367\n00:19:51.629 --> 00:19:53.901\nwere at [LAUGH] means something different.\n\n368\n00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:55.140\n&gt;&gt; Right and I'll just Ctrl+T.\n\n369\n00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:01.410\nThat's why that panel thing in the keys\nis really, in the keyboard settings.\n\n370\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.795\nThat's why going to\nthe different panels and\n\n371\n00:20:03.795 --> 00:20:06.944\nseeing that It means different\nstuff in different panels.\n\n372\n00:20:06.944 --> 00:20:10.939\n&gt;&gt; This is really kind of coming full\ncircle to me right now, the okay,\n\n373\n00:20:10.939 --> 00:20:13.160\nI see what you're putting down.\n\n374\n00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.500\n&gt;&gt; Right, so there's all kinds of ways to\ndo it like boom, here I go, then boom.\n\n375\n00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.440\nAll right, so now I'm happy with it.\n\n376\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.803\nAnd this is what editors do.\n\n377\n00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:23.569\nWe sit there and we sit there and\nwe go, one frame, no, two frames,\n\n378\n00:20:23.569 --> 00:20:25.240\nno, one frame, two frames.\n\n379\n00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.014\nAnd then everybody's banging\ntheir heads on the table.\n\n380\n00:20:28.014 --> 00:20:30.127\nYeah, so there is a method.\n\n381\n00:20:30.127 --> 00:20:34.770\nThere's many different methods to trim,\npick one that you like.\n\n382\n00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.840\nBecause it's not good to like razor,\nremove,\n\n383\n00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.790\nor send it back to the source monitor.\n\n384\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.510\nTry and do it there and load it back.\n\n385\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.220\nWork, when you've got stuff,\nis your sequence in your timeline?\n\n386\n00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.830\nWork in your timeline, okay?\n\n387\n00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.280\nI know it's frustrating and\nscary at the beginning.\n\n388\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.490\nBut when you do, you'll go a lot faster,\nyou'll feel more confident in how you\n\n389\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.160\ncreate your story, and\nit will just be a lot better.\n\n390\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.640\nThis is a great thing to practice\nwith just a couple of shots and\n\n391\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.140\nthen add four shots, and\nthen add five shots, and yeah.\n\n392\n00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the whole learn\nto walk before you run.\n\n393\n00:21:06.703 --> 00:21:10.371\nBut then if you can walk really good\nthen you can run really good and\n\n394\n00:21:10.371 --> 00:21:13.248\nthen yeah,\nit's gonna save a huge amount of time.\n\n395\n00:21:13.248 --> 00:21:13.927\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n396\n00:21:13.927 --> 00:21:16.010\n&gt;&gt; I like where you're saying,\npick one way and stick with it.\n\n397\n00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:20.511\nBecause that's the one that you're\ngoing to get super proficient in and\n\n398\n00:21:20.511 --> 00:21:25.254\nbe able to do all this edits really\nquickly and really know what you're doing\n\n399\n00:21:25.254 --> 00:21:25.823\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n400\n00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that was fascinating so\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.\n\n401\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.260\n&gt;&gt; I really enjoyed it.\n\n402\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.625\nAnd I hope all of you all out\nthere enjoyed it as well.\n\n403\n00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.358\nBut it is that time to go ahead and\ntransition.\n\n404\n00:21:35.358 --> 00:21:37.222\nWe're not doing trim.\nWe're gonna trim this out,\n\n405\n00:21:37.222 --> 00:21:40.284\nI don't know from using this\nproperly [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n406\n00:21:40.284 --> 00:21:43.655\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna trim my head to face\nplant on the table now, so yeah.\n\n407\n00:21:43.655 --> 00:21:45.712\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And for\nnow we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n408\n00:21:45.712 --> 00:21:47.772\n&gt;&gt; You were great.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For Creative Pro TV,\n\n409\n00:21:47.772 --> 00:21:49.965\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n410\n00:21:49.965 --> 00:21:50.655\n&gt;&gt; I'm Jim Biddle.\n\n411\n00:21:50.655 --> 00:21:52.761\n&gt;&gt; And we'll

and\n\n4\n00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:15.870\nwelcome back to another exciting\nepisode of Creative Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.050\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.230\nwe are continuing on our series\nwith Adobe Premier Pro CC2017.\n\n7\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.280\nAnd back in the studio to help us yet\nagain is Mr. Jim Biddle.\n\n8\n00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.310\nHi.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, it's good to see you again.\n\n9\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.210\n&gt;&gt; Hi.\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n\n10\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.040\nit's like we're magic here all day.\n\n11\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.080\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n\n12\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.580\nNot at all.\n\n13\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.285\nMy goodness.\n\n14\n00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:38.285\n&gt;&gt; Well, I hear we're going\nto be adding effects, so.\n\n15\n00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:39.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe're going to start adding effects.\n\n16\n00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:44.720\nAnd usually what happens is people think\nit's effects time, it's advance time,\n\n17\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.140\nit's hard stuff and all that.\n\n18\n00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.330\nI wanna show you how Adobe makes\nthings very, very simple for you.\n\n19\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.930\nAnd that if you keep with a simple plan,\nyou do a really great job.\n\n20\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.390\nSo I'm gonna describe some things to\nyou that don't seem like effects but\n\n21\n00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.470\nthey actually are and\ncan be really, really fun.\n\n22\n00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.400\nIn many cases,\nI think it's gonna blow your mind.\n\n23\n00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.440\n&gt;&gt; Is this kinda one of those\nlike less is more type things?\n\n24\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.160\nThere's probably lots of them, but\nyou might not wanna go too crazy.\n\n25\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.596\nOkay, good.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so first of all,\n\n26\n00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:14.288\nwe're gonna go back to the left side.\n\n27\n00:01:14.288 --> 00:01:14.896\n&gt;&gt; The other left.\n\n28\n00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:15.831\n&gt;&gt; The other left.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n29\n00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:17.110\n&gt;&gt; My other left, yes.\n\n30\n00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.980\nSo we're going back to the left side,\n\n31\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.100\nwhich is going to involve\nthe project window, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.790\nSo we're going back to the project window.\n\n33\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.630\nI'm gonna bring this up a little bit.\n\n34\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.440\nNow I've got a graphic, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.790\nAnd I'm sure as someone who knows graphic,\nVonne,\n\n36\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.740\nyou're like that is terrible [LAUGH] and\nit's like, yeah, it's really bad.\n\n37\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.385\nBut I get these kind of\ngraphics all the time.\n\n38\n00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:38.355\nNow it's a Photoshop file.\n\n39\n00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:41.630\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it's that bad [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I'm about to make it worse.\n\n40\n00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.020\nBut as you notice,\nI have put it in here three times.\n\n41\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.010\nCuz it's Watermelon 2016.\n\n42\n00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.215\nWell, it's not 2016, it's 2017.\n\n43\n00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:54.058\nSo what can I do to change this,\ncuz somebody comes in and is like, hey,\n\n44\n00:01:54.058 --> 00:01:56.900\nwe got that new 2017 graphic.\n\n45\n00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.795\nIt's great.\n\n46\n00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:00.105\nAnd you're like yay!\n\n47\n00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:01.455\nNow what?\nI got in there three times.\n\n48\n00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:06.585\nYou may have stuff in there\nthat's in there like 100 times.\n\n49\n00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:10.415\nYou can actually work, and I'm using this\nfor the facts to show you something.\n\n50\n00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:14.515\nYou can work on the left side to make very\nsimple changes, cuz the first thing you\n\n51\n00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:17.940\nthink is if I've got three in there, I've\ngot to change this thing out three times.\n\n52\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.050\nWe actually don't have to do that.\n\n53\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.525\nIf I go to the graphic,\nwhich is this one, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:26.260\nAnd I ctrl+click it,\nI'm gonna scroll down.\n\n55\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.370\nI have an option called Replace Footage,\nokay?\n\n56\n00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.570\nSo if I click on that, Replace Footage,\nI have the one here that's 2017.\n\n57\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.670\nWhen I open it, okay?\n\n58\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.920\nAnd notice, the 2017 is now in Comic Sans,\nthat's why it's so great.\n\n59\n00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.840\n&gt;&gt; You gotta love a Comic Sans.\n\n60\n00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.960\n&gt;&gt; I have a personal war\nagainst Comic Sans, okay?\n\n61\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.661\nA personal war against people and\ntheir obsession with Comic Sans.\n\n62\n00:02:55.661 --> 00:02:57.470\n&gt;&gt; I feel you so much [LAUGH].\n\n63\n00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.370\n&gt;&gt; But if I go down here to my timeline,\n\n64\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.390\nnotice it has placed it\nin there all three times.\n\n65\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.730\nBecause I made a change to the left side,\nit affected the right side.\n\n66\n00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.850\n&gt;&gt; You're changing the source.\n\n67\n00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.945\nIt's just like if you had a linked file or\nlinked picture in In Design,\n\n68\n00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:16.358\nchange out that,\nit's going to put, wherever it is,\n\n69\n00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:19.630\nno matter if it's 15 times,\nyou're going to change it all as well.\n\n70\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.790\n&gt;&gt; And can I do that with video files?\n\n71\n00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.650\nI can actually do that with video files.\n\n72\n00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.140\nOccasionally, you might get this like,\nokay,\n\n73\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.190\nwe got a shot missing,\nwe don't have this shot yet.\n\n74\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.070\nIt's like, okay, just put in a dummy shot,\njust put in the shot we hate, and\n\n75\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.530\nthen we come back, replace the footage,\ncuz maybe it's all timed out and all that.\n\n76\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.176\nIf I had any kind of graphic element on\nthis where it was like spinning around or\n\n77\n00:03:39.176 --> 00:03:43.623\nI did any color correction around that,\nthat's the great part about it.\n\n78\n00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:48.329\nBy replacing that source,\nby basically pointing the clip,\n\n79\n00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.052\nthe master clip,\nfrom one piece of media to another, okay?\n\n80\n00:03:53.052 --> 00:03:56.350\nThat's all I'm doing,\nI'm just rerouting the train, so to speak.\n\n81\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.430\nI could keep all of my,\n\n82\n00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.890\nany elements that are in there that\nare like I'm gonna go over the key frames.\n\n83\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.630\nOne other thing.\n\n84\n00:04:04.665 --> 00:04:05.955\nI talked about this a little earlier.\n\n85\n00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:07.735\nI'm gonna go to the footage, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:10.075\nAnd look, it's called watermelon.\n\n87\n00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:10.985\nLet's bring this up.\n\n88\n00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:15.208\nGonna use that tilde accent grave key.\n\n89\n00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:21.387\nNow, remember how I said this\none is technically 24 frames.\n\n90\n00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:22.925\nI'm just gonna use 24 and 60, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:23.942\nThis one's 24.\n\n92\n00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:25.884\nThis one's 60.\n\n93\n00:04:25.884 --> 00:04:30.287\nThe sequence is 24, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:30.287 --> 00:04:33.539\nSo a lot of people when they say, they say\nhey, how can you put those in there and\n\n95\n00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.805\nthey both kinda look the same,\nthey both look normal,\n\n96\n00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:38.050\nthey're playing at normal speed?\n\n97\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.010\nIf you do it this way,\nwe call it a mixed media sequence,\n\n98\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.120\nyou can put different resolutions and\ndifferent frame rates in the sequence and\n\n99\n00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.900\nit will conform and\nit will just make it work, okay?\n\n100\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.450\nWhat if I didn't want to do that?\n\n101\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.540\nI did this for a specific reason, okay?\n\n102\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.543\nI did it, I shot this at 60 for\na specific reason, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:02.543 --> 00:05:05.100\nAnd I used,\nI wonder which one of these I used.\n\n104\n00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.120\nI used the watermelon shot, Okay?\n\n105\n00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.290\nThis is a kind of like an effect.\n\n106\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.250\nMost people, when they do a speed effect,\nand we're going to go over these\n\n107\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.460\nanother time, they adjust\nthe speed only in the sequence.\n\n108\n00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.940\nBut what I'm going to do is this.\n\n109\n00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.060\nI'm going to ctrl+click.\n\n110\n00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.320\nI have an option called modify.\n\n111\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.600\nAnd if I click the wrong one, I am, oops,\n\n112\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.160\nit's not audio channels, well,\nI can go through the tabs, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.979\nI have the ability to modify audio\nchannels, which we we'll go over,\n\n114\n00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.207\nwe can go over briefly in audio, which\nis sometimes you have a dead channel,\n\n115\n00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:44.431\nthere's nothing in the right.\n\n116\n00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:48.302\nSo you wish you had two lefts.\n\n117\n00:05:48.302 --> 00:05:49.550\nAnd now I have two lefts.\n\n118\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.134\nCuz we're gonna talk about\ntracks versus clips.\n\n119\n00:05:52.134 --> 00:05:53.740\nWe're not going to worry\nabout that right now..\n\n120\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.610\nBut interpret footage.\n\n121\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.470\nAnybody who ever worked\nwith a film camera,\n\n122\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.240\nyou know that this is called\nan overcrank and an undercrank.\n\n123\n00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.330\nTechnically, in the film world, okay,\nfilm rolls through the camera only at 24\n\n124\n00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.930\nframes a second, and it is only\nprojected at 24 frames a second.\n\n125\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.026\nSo if I wanna make it go\nlook like it's going faster,\n\n126\n00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:20.930\nI roll it at a lower Frame Rate,\nlike 18 or 12 or something like that.\n\n127\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.661\nIf I wanna make it go slower,\nI crank it up higher.\n\n128\n00:06:24.661 --> 00:06:29.553\nSo I could say, by the way,\n\n129\n00:06:29.553 --> 00:06:36.818\nplease assume the Frame Rate is 23.976.\n\n130\n00:06:36.818 --> 00:06:39.650\nPlease assume that, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.675\nAnd then hit Return.\n\n132\n00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:44.497\nNow it says 23.976.\n\n133\n00:06:44.497 --> 00:06:47.852\nWhat is that gonna look like?\n\n134\n00:06:47.852 --> 00:06:49.217\nIf I come up here.\n\n135\n00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:55.222\nIt's like why is it taking so long?\n\n136\n00:06:55.222 --> 00:06:58.521\nBecause now it is in slow motion.\n\n137\n00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:00.708\nSo watch me,\nwatch me cut this thing this time.\n\n138\n00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:03.230\nCome on.\n\n139\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.406\nI gotta wait for\nit cuz it's like much longer now, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:09.580\nBoom.\n\n141\n00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.413\nAnd I did it this way,\nand it's nice and smooth.\n\n142\n00:07:15.562 --> 00:07:17.825\nIt is nice and smooth.\n\n143\n00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:20.484\n&gt;&gt; And we're doing this at\nthe left side of [CROSSTALK]\n\n144\n00:07:20.484 --> 00:07:21.408\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're doing this\n\n145\n00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:22.041\nat the left side.\n\n146\n00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:23.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And then I can cut in.\n\n147\n00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.670\nThat's one of the reasons\nwhy I made the duplicate.\n\n148\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.490\nYou'll notice that.\n\n149\n00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.250\nNow, the question is did\nit affect this side?\n\n150\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.950\nYes, it did.\n\n151\n00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.253\nBecause remember there was the cut.\n\n152\n00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:40.658\nSo now because I changed that source\nelement, it has affected this side.\n\n153\n00:07:40.658 --> 00:07:44.830\n&gt;&gt; Of where like the clip of\nthe duration of where you want to-\n\n154\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.810\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n155\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.542\n&gt;&gt; So everything shifted.\n\n156\n00:07:46.542 --> 00:07:48.180\n&gt;&gt; And now it's shifted.\n\n157\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.280\nEverything is shifted.\n\n158\n00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.214\nSo if I do the double-click,\nand then zoom back,\n\n159\n00:07:53.214 --> 00:07:59.316\nI could do that thing where I grab the\ncenter and move it over and say okay move.\n\n160\n00:07:59.316 --> 00:07:59.893\nNow that's not it.\n\n161\n00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:05.954\nI grab this guy and I move it over And\nI find where that cut was, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:05.954 --> 00:08:07.804\nCome out.\nThere it is.\n\n163\n00:08:07.804 --> 00:08:13.360\nMove it back, move it back,\nmove it back, move it back, cool.\n\n164\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.479\nAnd now it adjusts here, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:16.610\nIt adjusts here.\n\n166\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.034\nNot to where I want it to.\n\n167\n00:08:18.034 --> 00:08:18.800\nYou know what?\n\n168\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.340\nYou know why?\n\n169\n00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.520\nCuz of where I had the Play head.\n\n170\n00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.600\nSo I'm gonna do that Play head now.\n\n171\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.944\nDouble-click and move it over.\n\n172\n00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:33.520\nAnd yeah, now I get that,\nand it goes nice and slow.\n\n173\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.020\nDown here make sure to\nclick the correct panel.\n\n174\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.402\nThat also means I'm going to\nhave to stretch this out.\n\n175\n00:08:39.402 --> 00:08:46.422\nI'm gonna have to do that trimming\nthing and say please extend it, okay?\n\n176\n00:08:46.422 --> 00:08:48.550\nAnd it makes it considerably longer.\n\n177\n00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:54.400\nBut this is a form of speed effect,\nand I'm doing it on the left side.\n\n178\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.200\nEverybody thinks effects have to be\ndone on the right side in the sequence.\n\n179\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.720\nNo, I can do effects, replacements and\nthings like that on the left side.\n\n180\n00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.680\nAnd that is essentially\nwhat I've done here.\n\n181\n00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.770\nAnd now it's all crazy.\n\n182\n00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.860\nLook at that.\n\n183\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.179\nUnripened watermelon.\n\n184\n00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:17.380\nCool, I will slide that back.\n\n185\n00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.740\nAnd I'm gonna move this\ngraphic to the end.\n\n186\n00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.880\nNow let me show you something\nabout moving real quick, and\n\n187\n00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.050\nthen we'll get into the heart\nof the matter with effects.\n\n188\n00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.790\nNotice when I move this.\n\n189\n00:09:28.273 --> 00:09:31.310\nIt does snap, okay?\n\n190\n00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.240\nIt snaps to things,\nit know to go to an edit.\n\n191\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.080\nAnd I know what you're thinking,\nyou're thinking, wait a minute,\n\n192\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:42.460\nwe went to that setting, and\nit said, but it wasn't on.\n\n193\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.465\n&gt;&gt; There's a snap, then a snap, snap.\n\n194\n00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:46.070\nWow [LAUGH].\n\n195\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.510\n&gt;&gt; This is what it means.\n\n196\n00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.860\nThis is what people find confusing.\n\n197\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.050\nIf I move the Play head right now,\nnotice how it's moving nice and smooth.\n\n198\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.920\n&gt;&gt; Even though snap is\non the little magnet.\n\n199\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.270\nIf I go back to Preferences and\ngo to the Timeline, and\n\n200\n00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.519\nI put snap play ahead in\ntimeline when snap is enabled.\n\n201\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.740\nWhat that means is if I move this,\n\n202\n00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.890\nthis tends to,\nnow the playhead wants to snap to things.\n\n203\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:15.418\n&gt;&gt; That, okay,\n\n204\n00:10:15.418 --> 00:10:17.120\nthat makes sense now because-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n205\n00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.920\n&gt;&gt; It's the playhead\nthat we're talking about.\n\n206\n00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.210\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's specifically the playhead.\n\n207\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.000\nAnd a lot of people find\nthat very confusing.\n\n208\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.300\nIt's like, well,\nI'm dragging stuff and it's snapping.\n\n209\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.000\nIt's fine.\n\n210\n00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.100\nSome people like to drag it and\nhave it snap.\n\n211\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.190\nOthers do not.\n\n212\n00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:35.560\nI like to have it free moving, and\nthen I use the up and down arrow keys.\n\n213\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.320\nBut other people like that\nit snaps when they move it.\n\n214\n00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthe way that it is worded almost.\n\n215\n00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.350\nIf you didn't read almost single word by a\nsingle word, and kind of put it together.\n\n216\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.440\nIt's like it doesn't snap when the snap\nis on it's like wait, snap is on.\n\n217\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.632\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n218\n00:10:50.632 --> 00:10:51.579\n&gt;&gt; That's the thing\nthat it's asking about.\n\n219\n00:10:51.579 --> 00:10:54.880\n&gt;&gt; But it's specifically targeting\nthis idea of the Play head.\n\n220\n00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.880\nThat's why a lot of people\nget confused with it.\n\n221\n00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.600\nI'm gonna turn it off.\n\n222\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.325\nEverything still snaps,\nit's just, yeah, okay.\n\n223\n00:11:03.325 --> 00:11:05.491\nNow I'm gonna do something crafty, okay?\n\n224\n00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:06.720\nI'm gonna do something really crafty.\n\n225\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.040\nFirst, I'm gonna turn off V2.\n\n226\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.100\nOkay?\n\n227\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.840\nSo that way the playhead only\nsees what's in track video one.\n\n228\n00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.570\nI'm gonna do something new.\n\n229\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.332\nFirst of all, and this is to, for me,\n\n230\n00:11:20.332 --> 00:11:23.010\nwhat I wanna do is I wanna sort\nof re-add this shot back in.\n\n231\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.070\nI'm gonna show you two ways\nto add the shot twice, okay,\n\n232\n00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.240\nto set up this effect thing\nthat I'm about to do.\n\n233\n00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.463\nRemember that if I double-click, okay?\n\n234\n00:11:33.463 --> 00:11:38.460\nIf double-click, it's telling me this\nis in the sequence watermelon, and\n\n235\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.570\nit's the shot.\n\n236\n00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.330\nSo that's what I'm working with.\n\n237\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:49.080\nIf I come over here and I tap the F key,\nI have just created a match frame.\n\n238\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:55.280\nWhat that means is I have said,\nPlay ahead, look down,\n\n239\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.765\nfind the matching frame of what\nyou see on the master clip.\n\n240\n00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:03.795\nSo I'm now back in the master clip, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:06.315\nI'm back in the master clip.\n\n242\n00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:08.265\nWhich means I can actually do this.\n\n243\n00:12:10.255 --> 00:12:14.980\nI can take this middle part, move it, and\n\n244\n00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:20.250\nsay I want this section and\nI wanna put it here.\n\n245\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.317\nOverwrite.\n\n246\n00:12:21.317 --> 00:12:23.216\nAnd it was in V1 like that, oops.\n\n247\n00:12:23.216 --> 00:12:24.624\nLet me move that back down.\n\n248\n00:12:26.874 --> 00:12:27.480\nOverwrite.\n\n249\n00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.920\nSo I've taken a completely\ndifferent section\n\n250\n00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.050\nbecause I went back to the master clip.\n\n251\n00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.950\nI couldn't do that if I double-clicked\nthe segment in the timeline, okay?\n\n252\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.201\nAnd remember, because this is\njust a set of instructions,\n\n253\n00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:45.163\na master clip is metadata.\n\n254\n00:12:45.163 --> 00:12:47.240\n&gt;&gt; So the F was-\n&gt;&gt; This is still the same it's\n\n255\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.740\nstill the same.\n\n256\n00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.820\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like just jump\nto the parent if you wanna say.\n\n257\n00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, no, no, in this case\nwe don't wanna say the parent.\n\n258\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; What we wanna say is,\n\n259\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.100\nthe Play head is seeing, okay?\n\n260\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.810\nIt is seeing,\nlet me just set the frame size real quick.\n\n261\n00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.990\nIt is seeing that the fact, and\nI'm going to do it with this.\n\n262\n00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.990\nIt sees that there is this frame, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:11.960\nIt's looking down, it sees what's in\nvideo one, and it says I see this frame.\n\n264\n00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.020\nAnd I say good, take this and\n\n265\n00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:20.440\nfind the matching frame on\nthe master clip and load it for me.\n\n266\n00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n267\n00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:21.965\n&gt;&gt; Like that.\n\n268\n00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:22.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.\n\n269\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.699\nYou're basically saying at this\npoint in the time in the master.\n\n270\n00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:31.267\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the reason, one reason why people\ndo this, is what we could do is we could,\n\n271\n00:13:31.267 --> 00:13:36.480\nwatch this, I could say, actually\nI'm going to choose a different one.\n\n272\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.820\nI'll go right here Boom.\n\n273\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And now I'm going to say\n\n274\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.670\nfind the matching frame.\n\n275\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.370\n&gt;&gt; And you hit the F, and then it, okay.\n\n276\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\nIt finds it.\n\n277\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.200\n&gt;&gt; Now it's making sense on my brain now.\n\n278\n00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.240\n&gt;&gt; It finds it, and now I can do this.\n\n279\n00:13:54.587 --> 00:13:55.920\nLet's see, where did you go?\n\n280\n00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.660\nWhere did you go?\n\n281\n00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.600\nYou were here.\n\n282\n00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.560\nThere you go.\n\n283\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.800\nRemember this guy?\n\n284\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.540\nExport frame?\n\n285\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.160\nOkay, I'm just gonna\ngive you this is a TIFF.\n\n286\n00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.290\nNow.\n&gt;&gt; Doing this is a still?\n\n287\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.239\n&gt;&gt; Right, now watch this.\n\n288\n00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.350\nI have created my own file system.\n\n289\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.720\nSo I'm gonna go to desktop.\n\n290\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.340\nThat wasn't it.\n\n291\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.620\nBut I have this master folder system\nwhere I'm working this thing called\n\n292\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.380\nCreative Pro TV Work.\n\n293\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.200\nThis is the month I'm working in.\n\n294\n00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.980\nThis is the project.\n\n295\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.829\nAnd I have this thing\ncalled graphics sources.\n\n296\n00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.610\nI'll make a quick sub-folder by type.\n\n297\n00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.490\n&gt;&gt; You made all this.\n\n298\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I made all this.\n\n299\n00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.890\nThis is commonly, and I'm gonna give an\nexample for everybody that you can have.\n\n300\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.560\nThis is called a master folder system.\n\n301\n00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.390\nAnd a lot of us use, I learned this from\nseveral different editors when I was\n\n302\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.450\nlearning how to do computer\nediting after coming out of film.\n\n303\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.530\nBoom.\n\n304\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.560\nThere it is.\n\n305\n00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.670\nNow watch this.\n\n306\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.570\nIt's about five seconds long, okay?\n\n307\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:00.850\nI'm gonna make it two seconds.\n\n308\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.416\nAnd then using this right there,\nI will insert.\n\n309\n00:15:04.416 --> 00:15:09.083\nAnd what I've done is I've\ncreated a still frame.\n\n310\n00:15:11.664 --> 00:15:12.310\nLike that.\n\n311\n00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:16.800\nNow of course, I have to, I could leave\nit like that at that giant resolution, or\n\n312\n00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.870\nI could set it to frame size.\n\n313\n00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.130\nI kinda like that jump-out,\n\n314\n00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.290\nwhich I'll show everybody how\nto do that a little later.\n\n315\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.280\nBut that's what I can do.\n\n316\n00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.832\nI can match frame it and say put on there.\n\n317\n00:15:26.832 --> 00:15:29.609\nBut my play hand can't move or\nit's gonna look weird.\n\n318\n00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.940\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty crafty.\n\n319\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.163\n&gt;&gt; Usually when I do it,\nI drop an end point.\n\n320\n00:15:35.163 --> 00:15:37.408\nCuz here's what happens\nif my play head moves.\n\n321\n00:15:38.816 --> 00:15:40.320\nIt still goes to the end point.\n\n322\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.210\nIt knows to match up this end\npoint with that end point.\n\n323\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.870\nIf my Play head moved like a frame,\nit would look weird, okay?\n\n324\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.160\nSo yeah, that's one of the ways\nwe use the match frame.\n\n325\n00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.763\nOr if I just wanna pull more\nfootage off of the same clip,\n\n326\n00:15:54.763 --> 00:15:57.914\nI can just match frame it and\nreset my endpoints.\n\n327\n00:15:57.914 --> 00:15:59.840\nI can even do it like this, okay?\n\n328\n00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.965\nAnd this tends to blow people's minds.\n\n329\n00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:05.846\nLet's say if I Did this, match frame.\n\n330\n00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:11.440\nIt has a set of in and out points,\nbased on what is used in the timeline.\n\n331\n00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:17.340\nI could do option IO,\nthat get's rid of them, or I have these.\n\n332\n00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.590\nInstead, I put a whole new set,\nright here.\n\n333\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.840\nPut it right at the end.\n\n334\n00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.630\nWatch me do that thing.\n\n335\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.500\nI want this to go right to the end,\nso, yeah I'll use that insert after.\n\n336\n00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.349\nPut's it right at the end.\n\n337\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.550\nRight there it didn't change anything.\n\n338\n00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.690\nIt's the same thing,\nit didn't change anything.\n\n339\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.830\nThis is still the same if I may\ntrim it this is still the same.\n\n340\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:43.620\nSo I can pull different ends and\nI'll point off of the same master clip.\n\n341\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.390\nAnd that's what we do all the time.\n\n342\n00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:51.260\nBy using this match frame feature,\nwe can find the exact usage,\n\n343\n00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.340\nthe exact segment usage that we used,\nokay.\n\n344\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:17:00.750\nSo the reason I've done this is, I'm\ngonna go ahead and match frame This one.\n\n345\n00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.717\nCuz I've used two separate areas of it,\nokay?\n\n346\n00:17:03.717 --> 00:17:07.370\nAnd match-frame it.\n\n347\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.020\nThat's the other thing\npeople find confusing.\n\n348\n00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.230\nText controls.\n\n349\n00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.940\nThere is two sides to every story.\n\n350\n00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:24.120\nRight now we are on the master clip, but\nI could switch to the segment usage of it.\n\n351\n00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.510\nThat's also why if I'd come back and\ndouble click it.\n\n352\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:34.040\nIt immediately comes up in It's\nsegment usage but I can switch\n\n353\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.270\nto it's master Okay,\nI can absolutely switch to its master.\n\n354\n00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.250\nNow what I'm about to do may work or\nmay not work.\n\n355\n00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.630\nCause I haven't done this in a while.\n\n356\n00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.280\nI know I do it one way, but\nI'm hoping this will work.\n\n357\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.190\nIf I go to a effects, and\nthere are a ton of videos effects.\n\n358\n00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.460\nThere are great one's.\n\n359\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.470\nThe easiest one to show is blur.\n\n360\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.240\nIt's like, let's just blur this, okay?\n\n361\n00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.580\nGonna go to blur, I'm gonna get\nthe old Gaussian blur, I'm a fan.\n\n362\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.430\nDrag it up here, and\nthere's a little plus, and I let go.\n\n363\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.420\nAnd then I'm gonna do my blurriness And\n\n364\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.280\nI'm gonna repeat those edge pixels so\nI don't get the black around there.\n\n365\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:21.590\nCool, now because I did this to\nthe master, It's on that one, too.\n\n366\n00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.040\nSo you can do effects on segments or\nyou can do it on the master so\n\n367\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:33.160\nthat every time you drop in that\nmaster The effect is always on there.\n\n368\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.860\n&gt;&gt; It's like where it's connected.\n\n369\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.630\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly so\nwhat usually happens is this.\n\n370\n00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.420\nPeople are like, well,\nhey, how'd you happen?\n\n371\n00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.510\nYou're fun.\n\n372\n00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.040\nWhat?\n\n373\n00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.620\nOkay.\nIt's so small it's reacting.\n\n374\n00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.380\nIt has reactions.\n\n375\n00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.250\nIt does.\n\n376\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.240\nOne thing you can do is see these things?\n\n377\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.410\nThese are called effects badges.\n\n378\n00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.680\nNow occasionally, when I'm not working\nin Effects, I will turn them off.\n\n379\n00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.060\nBecause when I try and\n\n380\n00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.150\ngrab things, it's hard because it keeps\nwanting to grab the effects badge.\n\n381\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.810\nBecause the segment that\nyou have is kinda small.\n\n382\n00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.210\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a very small real\n\n383\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.450\nestate of where you wanna\nactually click on grab.\n\n384\n00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.410\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, exactly.\n\n385\n00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.610\nSo if I look at the effects controls for\n\n386\n00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.770\njust the segment, I'm looking up and\ndown I don't seen any blur.\n\n387\n00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.730\nI see the effects there embedded on\nlike motion, opacity Timer mapping,\n\n388\n00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.990\nI don't see any blur whatsoever.\n\n389\n00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:31.080\nSo then I go,\nmaybe it's on the master clip itself.\n\n390\n00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.990\nYep, it is, and\nthen I could simply delete that, okay?\n\n391\n00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.220\nNow I could also do this segment based.\n\n392\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:44.660\nLet's say that this one is supposed to\nbe blurry, but the front one is not.\n\n393\n00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.920\nI could simply take the Gaussian blur And\n\n394\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.550\ndrag it on this segment, and\nthen its only on the back one okay?\n\n395\n00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:52.130\ni'll blur that out.\n\n396\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:20:00.550\nI'll repeat those edge pixels,\nits on this one not on that one okay?.\n\n397\n00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.330\nHere's the crazy part, lets say.\n\n398\n00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.430\nI do want this one on that one.\n\n399\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.960\nHow I do?\n\n400\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.770\nWell you're familiar with copy, right?\n\n401\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.840\nYou ever hear of copy?\n\n402\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.790\n&gt;&gt; Mine is the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n403\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.440\nYou just go ahead and copy the effect\nover on to that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n404\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.220\n&gt;&gt; Right, but here's how you gotta do it.\n\n405\n00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.749\nSo I'm gonna do this, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and use the menu bar.\n\n406\n00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:25.980\nOkay.\n\n407\n00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.500\nFile, no wait.\n\n408\n00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.720\nWhere are we going.\n\n409\n00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.220\nCopy.\nOkay.\n\n410\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.680\nNow I'm going to highlight the first one.\n\n411\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.585\nI have a thing called paste attributes.\n\n412\n00:20:37.585 --> 00:20:39.332\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] It's like paste special.\n\n413\n00:20:39.332 --> 00:20:41.920\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nIt's very similar to paste special.\n\n414\n00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.750\nOnce I click it,\nit will say which attributes do you want.\n\n415\n00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.600\nAnd listing.\n\n416\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.420\nIf you haven't used\nAdobe Premier in awhile, and\n\n417\n00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.290\nyou're coming into it,\nand you're going, yes.\n\n418\n00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.250\nCuz it used to be you couldn't\ndetermine which attributes\n\n419\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.490\nyou were putting on or removing.\n\n420\n00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.850\nIt was just like a one shot deal.\n\n421\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.360\n&gt;&gt; It's a one shot, it's a one shot deal.\n\n422\n00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.600\n&gt;&gt; You couldn't like, taper down.\n\n423\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.890\n&gt;&gt; Not motion, not opacity, not,\nwell actually, let me just go ahead and\n\n424\n00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:10.720\nleave those on.\n\n425\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.470\nNo volume, no channel volume,\nno pin, just the Gaussian blur.\n\n426\n00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:20.590\nBoom, okay, and right there it is,\nright there it is.\n\n427\n00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.540\nDo you wanna guess why\nI left on the motion?\n\n428\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.900\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I had that and I was afraid\nbecause I did set the frame size.\n\n429\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.290\n&gt;&gt; I was worried that\nit might blanket out.\n\n430\n00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.560\nI'm pretty sure that it won't do that but\n\n431\n00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.380\nthere is that inherent\nparanoia of things past.\n\n432\n00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes, again just because it won't\nhurt anything if I keep that on.\n\n433\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.535\n&gt;&gt; It's a unfounded superstition.\n\n434\n00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:42.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know those.\n\n435\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.870\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n436\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.600\nAnd then yeah, you can remove things\nby simply deleting if you want.\n\n437\n00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.430\nOkay.\n\n438\n00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:56.220\nNow something new that they added not\ntoo long ago is the ability to do this.\n\n439\n00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.420\nI've got my blur, okay.\n\n440\n00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:07.090\nBut all of a sudden you say, can you just\nblur out everything but the watermelon?\n\n441\n00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.350\nAnd you're like Sure.\n\n442\n00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:13.480\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking masks, and\nyou go ahead and select it.\n\n443\n00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And you only want that.\n\n444\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.740\n&gt;&gt; So, we're gonna highlight this.\n\n445\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.880\nThat's what often throws people too,\nis the play head might be over it but\n\n446\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.780\na different one is highlighted.\n\n447\n00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.850\nSo make sure the right one is.\n\n448\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:31.600\nI've been in situations where This is\nhighlighted but I'm looking at this one.\n\n449\n00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.930\nMake sure you applied that and\n\n450\n00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.330\nyou highlighted the same which,\nhere is a trick.\n\n451\n00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.890\nNot a lot of people know this one.\n\n452\n00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.819\nIf you go to sequence, okay?\n\n453\n00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:46.900\nSelection follows Play head.\n\n454\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.388\nSo now if I move the play head\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n455\n00:22:50.388 --> 00:22:52.620\nthat is the biggest thing in Photoshop.\n\n456\n00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.870\nIf you're on the object,\n\n457\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.740\nit's actually gonna select the layer\nthat it's associated with.\n\n458\n00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.308\nAnd if you don't have it on,\nI show people that one check box and\n\n459\n00:23:01.308 --> 00:23:02.678\nThey're just like, [SOUND] yay.\n\n460\n00:23:02.678 --> 00:23:04.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So under sequence,\n\n461\n00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.210\ncuz this is a sequence issue.\n\n462\n00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.110\nIt is selection, follows, play head.\n\n463\n00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:14.105\nAnd if you have that wherever the play\nhead is, it automatically selects.\n\n464\n00:23:14.105 --> 00:23:15.845\n&gt;&gt; For that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that can be really handy.\n\n465\n00:23:15.845 --> 00:23:20.035\n&gt;&gt; For color correction in effects,\nthis is almost a must.\n\n466\n00:23:20.035 --> 00:23:23.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If I were to go to the effects panel or\n\n467\n00:23:23.015 --> 00:23:24.125\nthe effects workspace or\n\n468\n00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:27.515\nthe color workspace,\nit's automatically set up for that.\n\n469\n00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:28.525\nOkay?\nBut, I'm just working out\n\n470\n00:23:28.525 --> 00:23:29.025\nof the edit area.\n\n471\n00:23:29.025 --> 00:23:32.575\nI'm one of these people,\nI just keep modifying the workspace.\n\n472\n00:23:32.575 --> 00:23:35.175\nYou may find that the other\nones are good for you.\n\n473\n00:23:35.175 --> 00:23:40.920\nSo now, What I'm gonna do is,\nthe twirlies here are resets.\n\n474\n00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:47.120\nSo I can reset individual parameters of\nan effect, or I can do the whole thing,\n\n475\n00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.260\nI'm just gonna reset the whole thing.\n\n476\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:55.680\nAnd what I'm gonna do is say, all right,\nI have the ability to do masks, okay?\n\n477\n00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:02.060\nSo here's your basic ellipse, Your basic\npolygon and draw your own, with handles.\n\n478\n00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:02.967\nHow fun is that.\n\n479\n00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:05.860\nSo I'm just gonna start at the beginning.\n\n480\n00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.373\nAnd I can actually move that here.\n\n481\n00:24:07.373 --> 00:24:09.160\nSee, watch.\n\n482\n00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.620\nI can do that here and it's constrained.\n\n483\n00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.909\nYou know that word.\n\n484\n00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:13.720\nConstrained to the area.\n\n485\n00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.220\nAnd here we go.\n\n486\n00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.680\nI'm just gonna draw it.\n\n487\n00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.090\nPeople say, well nothing's happening.\n\n488\n00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.370\nIt's not going to,\ncuz I haven't activated the effect.\n\n489\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.310\nI've just activated the mask.\n\n490\n00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.800\nAnd this will blur it, or soften it.\n\n491\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.570\nIt's gonna soften its edges.\n\n492\n00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.850\nSo now I will go ahead and\nnotice it has a path feather and opacity.\n\n493\n00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.750\nSo you can do it by the numbers or\nyou can do,\n\n494\n00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.070\nI kinda like doing it by the wire frame.\n\n495\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.820\nSome things I do by the numbers,\nother things I do by the wire frame.\n\n496\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.480\nI will go to the actual parameters and\nsay okay, blurred is up.\n\n497\n00:24:46.605 --> 00:24:51.310\nAnd if you wanna say, well that's\nwrong you're blurring the watermelon.\n\n498\n00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.910\nNow say I know,\nI'm just going to invert it.\n\n499\n00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a lovely invert.\n\n500\n00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I now invert it and everything\nbut the watermelon is inverted and\n\n501\n00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:07.470\nthat's like now,\nit's not very normal as I like to say.\n\n502\n00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.584\nLet me do the PTH pixels.\n\n503\n00:25:09.584 --> 00:25:10.780\nOkay, cool.\n\n504\n00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.636\nI meaning to move this yeah,\nit's right there.\n\n505\n00:25:13.636 --> 00:25:19.350\nIt's really weird to see, yeah that is\na watermelon in that, wow that's cool.\n\n506\n00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:20.800\nNow, here is the tricky part.\n\n507\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.480\nI do have the ability to animate the mask.\n\n508\n00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.550\nI can do it one of two ways.\n\n509\n00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.880\nI can simply say, track it forward,\ntrack it backwards.\n\n510\n00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.410\nSometimes tracking backward\nfrom a point is better.\n\n511\n00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:41.330\nOr, I can do it one frame at a time.\n\n512\n00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.950\nSo let's say I'm gonna go ahead and\njust track it forward.\n\n513\n00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:49.050\nIt is tracking It's tracking so much.\n\n514\n00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.240\n&gt;&gt; So\nit's following the object that you're.\n\n515\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.130\n&gt;&gt; It wants to follow the object, but\nin this case it's not following the object\n\n516\n00:25:55.130 --> 00:26:00.040\nbecause it's usually based on facial\nrecognition and object recognition.\n\n517\n00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.280\nAnd because of this,\nthis is just too hard.\n\n518\n00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.240\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's a green watermelon\nwith green foliage around it.\n\n519\n00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.860\nIs that kind of throwing it off?\n\n520\n00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.860\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of it and\n\n521\n00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.960\nit's also I really haven't,\nit doesn't have a defined shape.\n\n522\n00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.730\nAmongst all those leaves it\ndoes not have a defined shape.\n\n523\n00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.220\nSo you can-\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n524\n00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.530\nif it had that definition it would\nunderstand this is the edge and\n\n525\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:27.460\nwherever that is, those edges go-\n&gt;&gt; Right, for license plates, faces,\n\n526\n00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.670\nit works really, really well.\n\n527\n00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.500\nIf I wanted to do it one frame at a time\n&gt;&gt; We'll get into more\n\n528\n00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.560\nkey frames when we animate my kitty,\nwell he's not my kitty,\n\n529\n00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.321\nsounds like, why did I just do that,\nor I've been around you too long.\n\n530\n00:26:41.321 --> 00:26:43.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\nyou start talking about cats and\n\n531\n00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.892\nyou had things [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so first of all we\n\n532\n00:26:46.892 --> 00:26:51.209\nmake stopwatch, the stopwatch has\nto be blue to make sure that it's,\n\n533\n00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:54.890\nif I click it, okay, if I click this now\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling it this\n\n534\n00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.360\nneeds to be animated.\n\n535\n00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.415\nBlue, that's great.\n\n536\n00:26:57.415 --> 00:27:02.970\nSo I'll go one frame forward and I'll\nkeep going and it does key frames, okay?\n\n537\n00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.270\nI'm just keep going,\n\n538\n00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.820\nokay now that it starts to move\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna come over here and\n\n539\n00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.100\njust highlight the mask, and\nsay okay move over here.\n\n540\n00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.300\n&gt;&gt; This is the more manual way if it's\nnot doing it automatically for you.\n\n541\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.090\nYou can say let's go ahead-\n&gt;&gt; Right, you can just move it this way.\n\n542\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.610\nAnd you can see as I scroll back,\nit's gonna move.\n\n543\n00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.330\nSo it's tedious, but do you ever\nwonder why at the end of movies,\n\n544\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.930\nespecially ones that have superheroes\nin them, there's this giant\n\n545\n00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.860\nlist of credits of people in\nthe animation, this is what they're doing.\n\n546\n00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.390\nThey're like one frame,\none frame, one frame.\n\n547\n00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.890\nSo consider yourself\namongst the elite now.\n\n548\n00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.320\nSo this gets us into effects.\n\n549\n00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.360\nWhat we're gonna do in the next\nlesson is ramp it up with stills,\n\n550\n00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.580\nmusic, and markers.\n\n551\n00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.310\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n552\n00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and\nwe'll add even more effects.\n\n553\n00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:00.660\nAnd I just showed the blur but\nyou can see, there are so\n\n554\n00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.130\nmany effects in there with Parameter.\n\n555\n00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:08.720\nAnd the thing I like to do is go in, and\nthrow everything up to 11 so to speak.\n\n556\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.940\nVery spinal tap with it, and\nthen bring them down to see what happened.\n\n557\n00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always tell people\nto do that in Photoshop.\n\n558\n00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.930\nHow do you know what each\none of these filters do?\n\n559\n00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.600\nI don't, I just put it on, take it to\nthe right, take it to the left and\n\n560\n00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.530\nsee what it does and\nmake something in the middle to work with.\n\n561\n00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.726\n&gt;&gt; I know, just look at me,\ndo I get or do subtle?\n\n562\n00:28:25.726 --> 00:28:28.170\nNo!\nI need eleven so there you are.\n\n563\n00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and all that you can really\nsee what is that you're gonna do.\n\n564\n00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:30.744\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n565\n00:28:30.744 --> 00:28:32.380\n&gt;&gt; That was really cool.\n\n566\n00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.442\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you enjoyed it.\n\n567\n00:28:33.442 --> 00:28:35.851\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sitting here just going.\n\n568\n00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:38.451\nAnd I'm trying to like\nnot make the sounds,\n\n569\n00:28:38.451 --> 00:28:41.347\ncuz I really wanna go [SOUND]\n[LAUGH] the whole time.\n\n570\n00:28:41.347 --> 00:28:42.320\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n571\n00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.430\nSo thank you so much for that information,\n\n572\n00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.040\nI'm looking forward to our stills and\naudio.\n\n573\n00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.970\n&gt;&gt; Well it's gonna be great.\n\n574\n00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, well I hope you all\nenjoy it and stick around, but\n\n575\n00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.740\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nsignoff for Creative Pro TV.\n\n576\n00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.220\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n577\n00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.220\n&gt;&gt; I'm Jim Middle.\n\n578\n00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.125\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon\n\n579\n00:28:56.125 --> 00:29:06.125\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:16.670\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\n\n4\n00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.640\nwe're gonna continue our series\nin Adobe premier pro CC2017.\n\n5\n00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.750\nAnd we have the one and\nonly the lovely James with us again.\n\n6\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.806\n[LAUGH] Hey.\n\n7\n00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:30.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll do my Deadpool.\n\n8\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.810\nAwesome.\n\n9\n00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.060\n&gt;&gt; We'' we're excited\nto have you as always.\n\n10\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.790\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm excited to be here again.\n\n11\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and we're going to be working\n&gt;&gt; Working with stills, so\n\n12\n00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.800\nwe're gonna move some images.\n\n13\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.940\n&gt;&gt; This seems a little weird, but\nif you're gonna be doing this,\n\n14\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.430\nyou probably have a lot of still pictures.\n\n15\n00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.810\nAnd working with still pictures\nin Premiere Pro is a lot of fun.\n\n16\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.100\nAnd you hear that dreaded word sometimes,\nmontage.\n\n17\n00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.040\n&gt;&gt; We need a montage.\n\n18\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.020\n&gt;&gt; We need a montage.\n\n19\n00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.630\nOkay.\n\n20\n00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.700\nAnd it's one of those things,\nI'm one of those people,\n\n21\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.420\nthe faster I can get that\nthing done the better.\n\n22\n00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.520\nSo the reason why this\nsorta comes under effects,\n\n23\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.100\nis I'm going to show you how you can use\neffects to make your life a lot easier.\n\n24\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.740\nOkay.\n\n25\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.380\nNow, going back down to the screen, I have\na new project open that's called Columbia,\n\n26\n00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.830\ncuz my wife's from Columbia and\nI took some video from there.\n\n27\n00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.930\nBut I wanna bring in Seymour.\n\n28\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.930\nI have a whole folder of Seymour,\nof stills of Seymour.\n\n29\n00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.020\nWatch this, I'm gonna go back\nto the media browser, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.250\nNow I've already highlighted\nwhere I want to be,\n\n31\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.360\nthis is the structure of my\nmaster folder system, okay.\n\n32\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.267\nBasically it's like this project\nfigure works with all this stuff, and\n\n33\n00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:51.413\nI mix it, because I go between cross\nsystems where I can put certain things,\n\n34\n00:01:51.413 --> 00:01:53.683\nand this is under video sources.\n\n35\n00:01:53.683 --> 00:01:58.305\nAnd,it is under C more, and\nthere are stills and there are video.\n\n36\n00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:02.861\nSo, I believe video sources actually,\nit's an interesting part,\n\n37\n00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:04.989\nit's not actually in this one.\n\n38\n00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.478\nI am pulling it from the other one.\n\n39\n00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:08.616\nNow, watch this.\n\n40\n00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:12.980\nIf i tear down on this side,\nthere is the stills.\n\n41\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.680\ninstead of opening it up, and bringing in\nindividual files, I'm going to do this,\n\n42\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.060\nI'm going to say, you know what,\nI'm just going to import the whole folder.\n\n43\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.400\nAnd it's called stills, and it's there,\nand it's great, and I will say, actually,\n\n44\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.710\nyou know what, I'd like to make\nthat a little more, see more.\n\n45\n00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.155\nYeah, SEYMORE, I don't know if\nthat's how his name is spelled.\n\n46\n00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:38.000\nSEYMORE_STILLS.\n\n47\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.050\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty handy.\n\n48\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.960\n&gt;&gt; Now, guess what?\nIt didn't change the name of this folder.\n\n49\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.700\n&gt;&gt; Because now we're into the project\nwhere it's not going to change your\n\n50\n00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.690\nfile structure.\n\n51\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n52\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.440\nSo, there they are.\n\n53\n00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.730\nAnd it's all STILLS.\n\n54\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.280\nNotice the icon changes\na Just a little bit okay.\n\n55\n00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.830\nThe icon changes a bit.\n\n56\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.350\nAlso the labels different.\n\n57\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.080\nThese are called labels okay.\n\n58\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.270\nSo this is pink.\n\n59\n00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.042\nThese are like, I believe these are mango.\n\n60\n00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:03.658\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n61\n00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:05.013\n&gt;&gt; So.\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with that.\n\n62\n00:03:05.013 --> 00:03:07.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nOften people say what are labels again?\n\n63\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.020\nAnd as you get more advanced as they go to\npreferences here are the label defaults.\n\n64\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.830\nIt'll say a bin is mango,\na sequence is forest, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.770\nIt's Adobe, I mean they make their on\ncolor and all this so they give them,\n\n66\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.590\nit's not just green.\n\n67\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, that's orange.\n\n68\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n69\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.180\n&gt;&gt; Now I can change the label colors.\n\n70\n00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.450\nI can make the violet, iris, all that.\n\n71\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.590\nThe interesting part is, and\na lot of people ask me this,\n\n72\n00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.400\nif I change this will the name change?\n\n73\n00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.610\nNo.\n\n74\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.580\nSo if I feel more comfortable with green,\nred, and all that, I can do this.\n\n75\n00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.500\nSo what this label tells me is\nwhen something comes up and\n\n76\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.100\nit's a still, it's going to be lavender.\n\n77\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.390\nThere is actually a way to change this\nthat most people don't know about because,\n\n78\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.999\nonce again, it's one of those sort\nof interesting pieces of language.\n\n79\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.640\nIf I go to file and\nall the way down the bottom,\n\n80\n00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.370\nremember my project settings that\nwe got at the very beginning?\n\n81\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.930\nHere they are again,\nwithin the actual application.\n\n82\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.630\nSo if there's something I wanted to\nchange about the entire project settings.\n\n83\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.510\nI could go to File,\nall the way down to it.\n\n84\n00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.290\nNow, display the project item name and\nlabel color for all instances.\n\n85\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.060\nBasically what this means\nis that if I check that,\n\n86\n00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.560\nI can change these to anything I want\nto from my own labelling system.\n\n87\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.460\nNot a lot of people use it.\n\n88\n00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.590\nSometimes I use for multi-cam because,\nnotice all these are going to be.\n\n89\n00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.210\nI'm just going to call it blue.\n\n90\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.490\nSorry Adobe I'm just calling it blue.\n\n91\n00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.510\nI'm sure Vaughn would call\nit exactly what it is.\n\n92\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.310\nBut now what I'm able to\nto do is go control and\n\n93\n00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.870\nthen just you know come down to label and\nsay just make it violet.\n\n94\n00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.798\nAnd then just make this one, okay, I chose\nforest green, something, I don't know.\n\n95\n00:05:03.798 --> 00:05:04.380\n[INAUDIBLE] yeah, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n96\n00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.360\nSo if I had three different\ncameras at three different angles,\n\n97\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.990\nI can do these individually.\n\n98\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.370\nSo good, just like because I\nlove to color code things.\n\n99\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.430\nBut it's my way of what pink means to me\nand what I would still call that blue too.\n\n100\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, I okay sure,\nthank you I'm so happy.\n\n101\n00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.650\nNow, I want to take a look\nat some of those real quick.\n\n102\n00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.390\nI'm going to take all of these,\nthis is Columbia.\n\n103\n00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.390\nOkay, and just double click,\nthey're gonna go up in here.\n\n104\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.420\nI've added some markers.\n\n105\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.080\nAnd it's real easy to add a marker,\nyou just tap the M key.\n\n106\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.010\nOr, if I have this symbol loaded down\nhere, all I have to do is click it.\n\n107\n00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.980\nIf I double click it,\nI've left myself a note.\n\n108\n00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.040\nLooks good, love this frame.\n\n109\n00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.120\nOkay, I can put these in sequences.\n\n110\n00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.070\nI can put these on shots.\n\n111\n00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.990\nI think I've got some more.\n\n112\n00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.260\nLet's take a look.\n\n113\n00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.600\nAnd this is where these advance things or\nyou can keep going through.\n\n114\n00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.110\nCome on, come on too.\n\n115\n00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.170\nCan you do it?\nNot gonna do it.\n\n116\n00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.096\nIt hates [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Or you're doing your shift\n\n117\n00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.190\ntoo [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Look I only loaded one.\n\n118\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.840\nThat's why.\nThat's why this It's good to take a look\n\n119\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.590\nat that.\n\n120\n00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.720\nOkay, boom let's go here.\n\n121\n00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.490\nBoom, shift.\n\n122\n00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.780\nI'm gonna just for\nsafety's sake, control click and\n\n123\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.690\nsay open them all in source monitor.\n\n124\n00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.880\nAnd now I know it's gonna do it.\n\n125\n00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.860\nOkay, crazy times.\n\n126\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.770\nThat's the one I looked at before.\n\n127\n00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.780\nOkay, what does this one say?\n\n128\n00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.430\nAdjust shadow and highlight, which is\nan effect we're gonna deal with later.\n\n129\n00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.010\nAha, here's another one we're gonna talk\nabout later, what does this one mean?\n\n130\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.920\nSlow this down.\n\n131\n00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.660\nGo to the next one, cuz there's\nthree in here, maybe a freeze frame.\n\n132\n00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.840\nNext one, boring, speed it up.\n\n133\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.210\nAnd I wanna do that all in one shot.\n\n134\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.820\nOkay, stick around for that one.\n\n135\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.630\nSo those are great with markers,\n\n136\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.658\nbut markers do another thing\nthat is incredible, okay.\n\n137\n00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:57.930\nFirst thing that happened was this.\n\n138\n00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:04.910\nWhen I brought in these stills, these\nare all, it says 4 seconds 28 frames,\n\n139\n00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.970\nthey're technically 5 seconds,\ndo you know why they're 5 seconds?\n\n140\n00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.770\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n141\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.350\n&gt;&gt; Because, and this is important,\nwhen you go to preferences timeline,\n\n142\n00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.721\nthere is two very important\nthings that come up with\n\n143\n00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:26.670\nthis, Still image default duration.\n\n144\n00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.420\nSo, when I bring it in the default,\nfive seconds.\n\n145\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.670\nI could make that or\nyou could do it by frames or seconds.\n\n146\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:38.360\nI could make it really,\nreally, really long.\n\n147\n00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.680\nI could absolutely do that.\n\n148\n00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.591\nI could make them just insanely long.\n\n149\n00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:46.987\nTo do a lot of animation on them.\n\n150\n00:07:46.987 --> 00:07:49.284\nNow, can I still stretch them out?\n\n151\n00:07:49.284 --> 00:07:49.958\nYeah.\n\n152\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.719\nI can still stretch them out but\nI can bring them in A lot longer, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:56.950\n&gt;&gt; This was looking familiar when\nyou were going into the preferences.\n\n154\n00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.760\nI'm like, yeah, I do remember\nseeing that now that you said that.\n\n155\n00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.490\nSo I guess you're talking about when\nthis still goes into the timeline that's\n\n156\n00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.370\nhow long its going to take up\nas that particular sequence.\n\n157\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm just noodling around right here.\n\n158\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.030\nI'm just noodling around\nwhile you were talking.\n\n159\n00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.360\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, editors do that.\n\n160\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.475\nWe just start noodling.\n\n161\n00:08:11.475 --> 00:08:13.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just start noodling around.\n\n162\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.490\nSo let's do this.\n\n163\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.190\nGonna go back up here.\n\n164\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.830\nI'm going to close all so\nI have nothing in here.\n\n165\n00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.840\nYou know let's open up all of the,\n\n166\n00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.056\nyeah I'm going to open up\nall of my stills in there.\n\n167\n00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:33.710\nShift click, control click, tell it to\nopen in source monitor, they all do.\n\n168\n00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.412\nLook at that, he's so cute.\n\n169\n00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:36.108\nIt's not even my cat.\n\n170\n00:08:36.108 --> 00:08:38.714\nAnd if I shift to I can see, look,\n\n171\n00:08:38.714 --> 00:08:44.418\nI can do a little cool animation with\nall of this and people will love him.\n\n172\n00:08:44.418 --> 00:08:49.440\nAll right, now\n\n173\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.910\ngonna need some music, which is crazy,\nbut I'm gonna need some music.\n\n174\n00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.050\nSo, gonna go back to my media browser,\nmake this big.\n\n175\n00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.470\nNow, because I have this\nsorted folder I'll say, okay,\n\n176\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.120\nI got some audio sources,\nI bet I got some music in here.\n\n177\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.669\nYep, and I got an MP3.\n\n178\n00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:09.574\nCtrl+Click that, import it over.\n\n179\n00:09:09.574 --> 00:09:11.240\nOkay, boom.\n\n180\n00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.700\nAnd, let's take a listen.\n\n181\n00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.703\n[MUSIC]\n\n182\n00:09:16.703 --> 00:09:18.466\n&gt;&gt; I know this song.\n\n183\n00:09:18.466 --> 00:09:19.704\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's perfect,\n\n184\n00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:21.652\nthat's just the most perfect thing ever.\n\n185\n00:09:21.652 --> 00:09:25.522\nSo now let me put it up there.\n\n186\n00:09:25.522 --> 00:09:29.111\nOkay, this might be one of those\nthings where you look at that,\n\n187\n00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:31.160\nit's like, that's kind of loud.\n\n188\n00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.805\nBut remember what can I do on this side.\n\n189\n00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:39.455\n&gt;&gt; You can change the gain.\n\n190\n00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:41.095\n&gt;&gt; I can change the gain, good.\n\n191\n00:09:41.095 --> 00:09:41.745\n&gt;&gt; Gain.\n&gt;&gt; Gain.\n\n192\n00:09:41.745 --> 00:09:43.275\n&gt;&gt; I had to think about it for a minute.\n\n193\n00:09:43.275 --> 00:09:44.345\nGain versus volume.\n\n194\n00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:45.235\n&gt;&gt; Vaughn wins.\n\n195\n00:09:45.235 --> 00:09:47.495\nSo what I will do,\nis I will control click it.\n\n196\n00:09:47.495 --> 00:09:51.872\nBecause usually what happens is\nwhen you you have things like this,\n\n197\n00:09:51.872 --> 00:09:56.972\nwhat happens is, you've got a lot of real\nmidrange and power for small speakers.\n\n198\n00:09:56.972 --> 00:10:00.712\nSo, I can cut back on the gain a little\nbit, cut back on the input power, and\n\n199\n00:10:00.712 --> 00:10:08.020\nI will say, adjust the gain by\nnegative 12, okay, in your notes.\n\n200\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.511\nOne of the reasons why I do this too, is\nit's so much gain on there, it's hard for\n\n201\n00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:19.644\nme to control the volume in the track and\nthis is what is cutting back and\n\n202\n00:10:19.644 --> 00:10:22.473\nnow I have a good manipulating\none that I can do.\n\n203\n00:10:22.473 --> 00:10:26.359\n&gt;&gt; Cuz then you can do more on the right\nside where you can change the volume.\n\n204\n00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:30.175\nCuz it is so far up, you don't\nhave as much adjustment to go up.\n\n205\n00:10:30.175 --> 00:10:31.635\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n206\n00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:34.005\nNow, I'm going to create a new sequence,\nokay.\n\n207\n00:10:34.005 --> 00:10:35.630\nAnd I can do that from up here.\n\n208\n00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.200\nAnd it's gonna go through\nthat thing again.\n\n209\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.870\nDSLR 720 is fine by me, okay, I like it.\n\n210\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.484\nI use it, I don't have anything\nspecial that I have to do.\n\n211\n00:10:44.484 --> 00:10:47.980\nThree audio tracks is fine.\n\n212\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.876\nIf I come over to tracks though,\nI might say three video tracks.\n\n213\n00:10:51.876 --> 00:10:53.801\nLet me start with two, okay?\n\n214\n00:10:53.801 --> 00:10:57.276\nTwo tends to be a little daunting, okay?\n\n215\n00:10:57.276 --> 00:10:59.183\nTends to be a little daunting.\n\n216\n00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:02.270\nAnd i will just call this Seymour, okay.\n\n217\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:09.210\nSeymour, click OK, and\nthere is my sequence.\n\n218\n00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.390\nNow this is what,\na couple things are gonna trip people up.\n\n219\n00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.060\nThere's a left channel and\na right channel.\n\n220\n00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.600\nIf we take a look at our sequence.\n\n221\n00:11:21.986 --> 00:11:24.690\nThey'll say why is there only an A1?\n\n222\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.650\nIf there is a left and\na right channel shouldn't there be two?\n\n223\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.780\nIn Adobe world, left side has channels,\nright side has tracks.\n\n224\n00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:44.180\nAnd you can put multiple channels into one\ntrack, this is considered a stereo channel\n\n225\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:50.700\naudio, it will go into one track, okay.\n\n226\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.700\nBut then that's when people say, but\nwhat if the left side is messed up and\n\n227\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.280\nI need something in the right side?\n\n228\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.000\nThat's where you're gonna go\nmodify in another lesson.\n\n229\n00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.340\nThis is fine the way it is, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.220\nAnd I'm only gonna pull 30 seconds.\n\n231\n00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.960\nWatch me pull 30 seconds.\n\n232\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.281\nI'm going to do I at the beginning.\n\n233\n00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:13.420\nClick here, type in 30,\nthat would be 30 frames.\n\n234\n00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.878\nHit period, that's 30 seconds.\n\n235\n00:12:15.878 --> 00:12:17.404\nHit Return.\n\n236\n00:12:19.626 --> 00:12:21.720\nNotice how it says 30 in one frame.\n\n237\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.230\nI'm gonna back up one, hit Out.\n\n238\n00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:29.265\nNow it's 30, here's why.\n\n239\n00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:32.195\nWe zoom in.\n\n240\n00:12:33.775 --> 00:12:38.695\nIf you see the play head,\nthe play head is always one frame.\n\n241\n00:12:38.695 --> 00:12:40.635\nIt's one frame in length.\n\n242\n00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:47.305\nIt always measures from this, but it marks\nthe out at the opposite end of the frame.\n\n243\n00:12:47.305 --> 00:12:50.590\nSo at 30 seconds marked here,\nit's 30 in a frame.\n\n244\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.620\nOkay, so\nif you cut that 30 it would be 31.\n\n245\n00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, it would be 30 and 1 frame.\n\n246\n00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n247\n00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.604\n&gt;&gt; So now because I backed it up 1,\nit's a flat 30.\n\n248\n00:13:00.604 --> 00:13:01.730\n&gt;&gt; That's the 29.9.\n\n249\n00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, in a way, not really.\n\n250\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.045\nWell, I'll explain the [INAUDIBLE] later.\n\n251\n00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:06.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll explain later.\n\n252\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.970\nI need ovals and circles for that.\n\n253\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.600\nSo yeah,\nnow this is absolutely 30 seconds.\n\n254\n00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.560\nI know it seems very weird to people.\n\n255\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.030\nAnd then I will simply overwrite it in.\n\n256\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.560\nNow I'm going to play the marker game.\n\n257\n00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.500\nI love the marker game.\n\n258\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.430\nIn order to create a montage, and\n\n259\n00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.749\nsome people say, everyone wants their\nmontage to the beat of the music.\n\n260\n00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.670\nLet me make this big.\n\n261\n00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.820\nAnd I will zoom out, and\nI will option, okay.\n\n262\n00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.550\nAnd what I'm gonna do is this.\n\n263\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.996\nThe M key drops a marker, and\n\n264\n00:13:40.996 --> 00:13:46.303\nI need to drop the markers in\nthe sequence, not on the clip, okay?\n\n265\n00:13:46.303 --> 00:13:48.730\nSo I'm just gonna drop\none at the beginning.\n\n266\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:59.137\nHit the space bar and then when I feel\nthe music, hit the m key, so here we go.\n\n267\n00:14:05.128 --> 00:14:10.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay I'm just,\n\n268\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:16.300\nhere we go All right, there we go.\n\n269\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.710\nI think that's enough.\n\n270\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.660\nI think that's enough for now.\n\n271\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.380\nNow, my super special thing.\n\n272\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.410\nI'm gonna take all the pictures\nof Seymour and Shift+Click.\n\n273\n00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:36.046\nWhen I do that, This activates,\n\n274\n00:14:36.046 --> 00:14:40.730\nand it is called Automate to Sequence.\n\n275\n00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.370\n&gt;&gt; I have a feeling these are gonna\ndrop on those markers, isn't it?\n\n276\n00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.000\n&gt;&gt; You're killing my buzz.\n\n277\n00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, oops.\n\n278\n00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.890\n&gt;&gt; No, it's okay, you're allowed.\n\n279\n00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.532\nI allow Like you, you're loud.\n\n280\n00:14:51.532 --> 00:14:53.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me get rid of the-\n\n281\n00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.150\n&gt;&gt; I got excited [LAUGH]\n\n282\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, this is very exciting.\n\n283\n00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.735\nFor people that have to do a lot of\nmontage, this is very exciting for them.\n\n284\n00:14:58.735 --> 00:15:01.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're like, cuz it's like hours of\n\n285\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.640\nbillable work down to 10 minutes,\nthat you can still bill for hours work.\n\n286\n00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.870\nThat's unethical, don't do it.\n\n287\n00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.508\nI do it all the time.\n\n288\n00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:07.408\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, so\n\n289\n00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:08.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n290\n00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.140\n&gt;&gt; Take it.\n\n291\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.630\nDrag it over.\n\n292\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.420\nAutomate the sequence and\nyou get a dialogue box.\n\n293\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.400\nAnd it says selection order or sort order.\n\n294\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.760\nWhich means I didn't have to\njust draw a box around it.\n\n295\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.710\nI could have gone this one then\ncommand click this one and\n\n296\n00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.160\nthat would have been the selection order.\n\n297\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.220\nOkay, Placement.\n\n298\n00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.690\nPlace them sequentially, no.\n\n299\n00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.183\nAt numbered markers.\n\n300\n00:15:28.183 --> 00:15:28.880\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n301\n00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.070\n&gt;&gt; So, you will notice the markers\nare at different distances.\n\n302\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.951\nSo it's making edits.\n\n303\n00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:36.292\nIt'll do the first one up to the marker,\nand\n\n304\n00:15:36.292 --> 00:15:40.220\nthen the next one up to the next marker,\njust making edits, okay.\n\n305\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.456\nMethods, do it as an overwrite, still\nclip duration, use the in and out range.\n\n306\n00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:47.703\nIgnore audio.\n\n307\n00:15:47.703 --> 00:15:49.539\nIgnore the audio.\n\n308\n00:15:49.539 --> 00:15:51.180\nHang on let me.\n\n309\n00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.343\nI'm gonna take that out just in case.\n\n310\n00:15:54.343 --> 00:15:58.408\nSometimes they get nervous,\nso click, boom.\n\n311\n00:15:58.408 --> 00:16:03.450\nAll right, now same thing,\nselection non sequentially.\n\n312\n00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.770\nWe're gonna do numbered markers Right,\nit is above a button.\n\n313\n00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.060\nSometimes it will activate where\nyou can apply default transitions.\n\n314\n00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.670\nI'll explain why this won't at this time.\n\n315\n00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.697\nBoom, [SOUND],\nhere's the first problem I did.\n\n316\n00:16:19.697 --> 00:16:24.470\nI put the play head here,\nput your play head at the beginning.\n\n317\n00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.840\nThat's why, even though this is fun,\nSometimes you forgets stuff.\n\n318\n00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.660\nIt's those little things, remember\nwhat I did with the key frames before?\n\n319\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.590\nGet it set up properly.\n\n320\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is kind of like the story\nof my life [LAUGH] when I'm doing things.\n\n321\n00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.790\n&gt;&gt; Dragging you down, you're like\nI do this all the time, runner up.\n\n322\n00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.020\nAll right, so\nadd number mark is overwrite edit, boom.\n\n323\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.250\nAnd you will not that it\nhas essentially edited.\n\n324\n00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.610\nTo each new marker.\n\n325\n00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.800\n&gt;&gt; Wherever you felt\nthe music that you knew.\n\n326\n00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Wanted to put a change.\n\n327\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:55.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n328\n00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.360\nThat's really cool.\n\n329\n00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.680\n&gt;&gt; Now some of the markers\nare longer than five seconds, okay?\n\n330\n00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.070\nSo that's why after five seconds,\nit stops.\n\n331\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.435\nThe other thing I've gotta\ndo is grab all these.\n\n332\n00:17:08.435 --> 00:17:11.119\nCtrl+Click and of course.\n\n333\n00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.360\nSet to frame size.\n\n334\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.090\nOkay?\nNow,\n\n335\n00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:16.870\nit should look fine, yep, there he is.\n\n336\n00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:17.580\nOkay?\n\n337\n00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.700\nSo, I can just come and trim those.\n\n338\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.680\nI can trim those, let me just\njump in real quick, command plus.\n\n339\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.180\nOkay?\n\n340\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.290\nStretch it out and say all right,\nlet me just do a simple try.\n\n341\n00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.720\nI'm not even activating the trim tool.\n\n342\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.300\nSoon as I come in I can just do this\nlike that, okay, and just repair these.\n\n343\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.190\nJust say okay yeah that one\nis there let's move that up.\n\n344\n00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.010\nAnd now I think that one's good,\nthat one's good.\n\n345\n00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:47.920\nWe need to bring this one up a little bit\nEven though I can trim it, this is weird.\n\n346\n00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.130\nIt's only five seconds,\nwhy are you doing that?\n\n347\n00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.150\nHow can you do that?\n\n348\n00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.810\nWith stills you can, it's fine.\n\n349\n00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.410\nEven though I only ask for\nfive seconds, I can go longer.\n\n350\n00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.440\nFive seconds is just\nthe default length coming in.\n\n351\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.460\nAnd then boom, remember w,\nboom and now I have it.\n\n352\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.460\nHere it is.\n\n353\n00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:05.960\nNeat.\n\n354\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.720\nNow.\n\n355\n00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.640\nFor the sake of time,\nI'm going to create an animation and\n\n356\n00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.850\nthen reuse it a hundred times.\n\n357\n00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.330\nAll right?\n\n358\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.760\nWe're gonna just go to the first one.\n\n359\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.940\nEffects controls.\n\n360\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.510\nSo, what do I wanna do with this?\n\n361\n00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.980\nThere's a couple of different ways.\n\n362\n00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.940\nFirst of all, I have my position and\nI have my scale.\n\n363\n00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.780\nScale does this, okay?\n\n364\n00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.630\nAnd I'll set it back to the 24.\n\n365\n00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.674\nI think it was 24.1.\n\n366\n00:18:37.674 --> 00:18:43.550\nPosition, like that, okay\n\n367\n00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:48.540\nWe reset that value, boom, rotation,\nI think, we all get the point.\n\n368\n00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.820\nSo, how do I make this thing move?\n\n369\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.950\nOkay, I can also use a wire frame.\n\n370\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.060\nOkay, it's hard to see, but, by clicking,\n\n371\n00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.990\njust on the word, motion,\nI've activated the wire frame.\n\n372\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.190\nWhen I go to 10.0%, and now I can see\nSee the wire frame and manipulate it.\n\n373\n00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.290\nThat's why we have this fit.\n\n374\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.170\nI'm just gonna do it by the numbers.\n\n375\n00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.383\nOkay soon as I hit one of these\nthe wire frame goes off okay?\n\n376\n00:19:17.383 --> 00:19:24.120\nBoom so what I'm gonna do is hit the stop\nwatch at the very beginning of the clip.\n\n377\n00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.470\nOkay I'm gonna go to the beginning.\n\n378\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.090\nFirst part of it come here you,\nyou silly kitty.\n\n379\n00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.405\nCome here.\nOkay, and\n\n380\n00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:37.902\nmake sure it's highlighted.\n\n381\n00:19:37.902 --> 00:19:40.712\nIt is highlighted.\n\n382\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:50.170\nIf I hit the stop watch I have begun\nto animate, this is a key frame.\n\n383\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.210\nRemember, this is a series of frames.\n\n384\n00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.810\nAnd what I will say is that I\nwant it to move forward and\n\n385\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:04.070\nat this point, I can add a key,\nsee I can go to key frames.\n\n386\n00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:09.390\nGo to next previous at this point,\nas long as I make a parameter change,\n\n387\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.450\nit's gonna add a new one.\n\n388\n00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.300\nOr I can add a new one then\nmake the parameter change.\n\n389\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.820\nSo for now I'm just gonna do like this.\n\n390\n00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:24.040\nOkay, and then say, all right that's fine.\n\n391\n00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.350\nI'm not gonna really this right now\ncuz I'm gonna do all the parameter But\n\n392\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:33.700\ni'll say how's that look, it's linear,\n\n393\n00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.460\nits robotic eew, so how do I change it?\n\n394\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:44.210\nIf I Ctrl click on key frames I have\nwhat is known as interpolation.\n\n395\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.270\nSo this is a linear chain A busy A,\nyou know what that is.\n\n396\n00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.970\nYou get the handles.\n\n397\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.750\nIf I turn this down, there are my\nhandles and I can smooth the curve.\n\n398\n00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:58.020\nControl auto bezier means\nit simply does it for\n\n399\n00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.010\nme, okay, and\nI can't really change anything about it.\n\n400\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.810\nI wouldn't want to.\n\n401\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.130\nIt's just like do it that way.\n\n402\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.590\nContinuous Bezier means you get on handle.\n\n403\n00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.380\nI'm gonna do a hold,\nI'm gonna Jack Bauer this.\n\n404\n00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.340\nAnd I'm gonna do a hold at the beginning.,\nCtrl+Click, Hold.\n\n405\n00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.940\nLooks like a little, watch this.\n\n406\n00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.660\n24, bam.\n\n407\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.570\nThat's how it looks like,\n\n408\n00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:30.720\nit goes from a wide shot To a close\nup without having to make cuts.\n\n409\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.630\nI did an interpolation that way.\n\n410\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:38.180\nAnd I think while it's doing that,\nwatch this.\n\n411\n00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.500\nI will go to rotation and\nI'll do something really silly.\n\n412\n00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.610\nI'll start at 0 but by the time\nit gets to the hold, It's gonna\n\n413\n00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:52.845\nrotate like that so it does this, boom.\n\n414\n00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:56.150\n[LAUGH] And then there we go.\n\n415\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.622\nWhy?\nI don't know.\n\n416\n00:21:57.622 --> 00:22:00.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have absolutely no idea.\n\n417\n00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.705\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's fun.\n\n418\n00:22:00.705 --> 00:22:01.380\n&gt;&gt; It;s fun.\n\n419\n00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.760\nIt's hilarious.\n\n420\n00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:08.090\nSo now I have decided I wanna\ndo this on every single clip.\n\n421\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.690\nWhat do I do?\n\n422\n00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.060\nI have two choices.\n\n423\n00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.240\nOne I think you remember paste attributes.\n\n424\n00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.440\nWatch this.\n\n425\n00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.620\nI'm gonna go straight up to motion\ncontrol plate and say save Preset.\n\n426\n00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.533\nAnd when I do that I'm gonna\nsay dumb spinning cat.\n\n427\n00:22:27.533 --> 00:22:31.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now we're gonna scale it and\n\n428\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.710\nwe'll talk about,\nwe're gonna do some effects later.\n\n429\n00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.720\nWe'll talk about\nthe difference between scale.\n\n430\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.890\nYou I bet you already know anchored\nin point anchored out point.\n\n431\n00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.365\nLike if I'm doing this.\n\n432\n00:22:41.365 --> 00:22:42.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No if I'm doing this and\n\n433\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.040\nit's five seconds long\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n434\n00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.890\nthe next thing I put it\non is three seconds long.\n\n435\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.180\nI want the key frames to\nscale down to three seconds.\n\n436\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.180\n&gt;&gt; The relative sizing based on whereas.\n\n437\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.040\n&gt;&gt; The relative sizing.\n\n438\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.020\nIf it was anchor to end point it\nwould go into three seconds and stop.\n\n439\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.740\nIf it was anchor to the out point,\nit'd be wherever it was toward its out.\n\n440\n00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.440\nSo all three of them are very effective.\n\n441\n00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.430\nI'll click OK, and\nthen you'll go, okay, now what?\n\n442\n00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:14.123\nFirst let me go to this,\nlet me squeeze it down.\n\n443\n00:23:14.123 --> 00:23:18.080\nOkay, I'm gonna shift minus,\nso I can get it there.\n\n444\n00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.299\nAnd it's like on everything after that,\nif I go to effects\n\n445\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:27.700\nUnder presets dumb spinning cat.\n\n446\n00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:34.250\nSo I'm gonna highlight all of these, click\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna drop it.\n\n447\n00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:39.077\n&gt;&gt; Drop it, and now here, here is\nthe wonderment that is, dumb spinning cat.\n\n448\n00:23:43.569 --> 00:23:45.503\nAnd I can change the parameters later.\n\n449\n00:23:45.503 --> 00:23:48.332\nI can change the parameters\non the individual but\n\n450\n00:23:48.332 --> 00:23:53.097\nI have essentially made to the beat of the\nmusic A montage with a dumb spinning cat.\n\n451\n00:23:53.097 --> 00:23:55.965\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that's it.\n\n452\n00:23:55.965 --> 00:23:56.493\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n453\n00:23:56.493 --> 00:23:57.160\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n454\n00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.830\nBut these parameters, if I did this, too.\n\n455\n00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.350\nLet's do one last thing real quick.\n\n456\n00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.800\nYou could say, okay, so\nthat works on the motion properties and\n\n457\n00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.060\nit works on the opacity properties, right?\n\n458\n00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:13.750\nYep, let me do a really\nterrible video effect just cuz.\n\n459\n00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:20.230\nOkay, let's see, Adjust, Extract Levels,\nLighting Effects [LAUGH], no.\n\n460\n00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.195\nI could put in a lightning bolt.\n\n461\n00:24:22.195 --> 00:24:23.737\nI'm not gonna be that evil.\n\n462\n00:24:23.737 --> 00:24:25.090\nHeck with it, we're just gonna do Blur.\n\n463\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:31.852\nSo I will do a Gaussian Blur on this one.\n\n464\n00:24:31.852 --> 00:24:34.280\nAnd I'll say, and I will animate it.\n\n465\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:40.070\nFrom the beginning or actually,\nyeah, toward the end.\n\n466\n00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:45.364\nI'll do it toward the end, toward this,\nand then I will say it is full-on blurry.\n\n467\n00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:53.477\nAnd then once we get just past\nthis key frame, there's none.\n\n468\n00:24:53.477 --> 00:24:56.826\nOkay, so ooba dooba, isn't that great?\n\n469\n00:24:56.826 --> 00:24:58.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It goes down.\n\n470\n00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.130\nThat is tremendous, that is tremendous.\n\n471\n00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.900\nI love it, I love it, I love it.\n\n472\n00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.850\nI can even click and I can drag keyframes.\n\n473\n00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.720\nIt's like, no,\nit should be more here cuz there were two.\n\n474\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:15.060\nI drug the wrong one, so I can move this\nback and move that over there, okay?\n\n475\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.830\nYou could pick them up and\ndrag them to locations that you want.\n\n476\n00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.140\nIt's fully doable and then there we go.\n\n477\n00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.880\nAnd can I make a preset of that?\n\n478\n00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.240\nYes, I can make a preset of that.\n\n479\n00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.162\nI could have, and this is where it gets\nreally weird, I could have Cmd-click\n\n480\n00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:35.140\nthe Motion and the Gaussian Blur and\nmade a preset of all of it.\n\n481\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cuz I was gonna ask is it\nthat you have to make presets out of\n\n482\n00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:38.860\neach individual effect?\n\n483\n00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.710\n&gt;&gt; Nope, I can make multiples.\n\n484\n00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:41.830\nIt's insane.\n\n485\n00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.540\nIt's absolutely so much fun, okay?\n\n486\n00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.570\nJust to know,\n\n487\n00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:52.100\nyou may not be used to this in other, you\nmay not be used to this in other systems.\n\n488\n00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:57.254\nBut when I click on anything,\nany segment in the sequence,\n\n489\n00:25:57.254 --> 00:26:03.234\nthese effects, the motion,\nthe opacity, and the time remapping,\n\n490\n00:26:03.234 --> 00:26:08.770\nare all embedded on a segment,\nall embedded on a segment.\n\n491\n00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.970\nFully animatable, okay?\n\n492\n00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.700\nThe only one that's not in there,\nit's always a great trivia question, crop.\n\n493\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.130\nCrop you have to actually add\nas an effect to do cropping.\n\n494\n00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.830\nYeah, this is the Ken Burns thing, okay?\n\n495\n00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.520\nWe all call it the Ken Burns thing cuz he\nonly had still photos to do the Civil War.\n\n496\n00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.940\nAnd then,\nhe did this all this with the Civil War.\n\n497\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.070\nBoom, boom, boom, craziness,\nabsolute craziness.\n\n498\n00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.550\nIt's fun though, it's fun though.\n\n499\n00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:35.970\nYou're going to be called upon\nto do a montage at some point.\n\n500\n00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.130\nOkay, yeah.\n\n501\n00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.928\n&gt;&gt; Do you know how many\npictures I have of my cats?\n\n502\n00:26:39.928 --> 00:26:42.056\nSo yeah,\nI'm totally gonna be enjoying this.\n\n503\n00:26:42.056 --> 00:26:44.147\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can you do it to the entire Wagner ring\n\n504\n00:26:44.147 --> 00:26:46.258\ncycle, and just drop it on the beats?\n\n505\n00:26:46.258 --> 00:26:48.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For like the cellists or whatever,\n\n506\n00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.760\njust do this massive system of all that?\n\n507\n00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.911\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, I'll throw it on that.\n\n508\n00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:53.770\n&gt;&gt; Could you?\n\n509\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you something too,\n\n510\n00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.210\nthat is interesting.\n\n511\n00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.263\nRemember how I double-clicked on a marker?\n\n512\n00:27:00.263 --> 00:27:05.228\nOkay, if I highlight the sequence,\nand I go to Markers, okay?\n\n513\n00:27:05.228 --> 00:27:10.830\nIt should show me a list of all of them,\nokay?\n\n514\n00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.608\nIt should show me a list of all\nthe markers once I've highlighted\n\n515\n00:27:13.608 --> 00:27:15.632\nthe sequence, and\nwhat they all mean, okay?\n\n516\n00:27:15.632 --> 00:27:18.187\nAnd yeah, I can do that, and it's fun.\n\n517\n00:27:18.187 --> 00:27:19.730\nNow these are used as sync markers, so\n\n518\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.405\nit's probably not gonna show cuz\nI don't have any information.\n\n519\n00:27:22.405 --> 00:27:27.388\nBut in many cases, if I were to come\nup here, and drop markers on things,\n\n520\n00:27:27.388 --> 00:27:31.170\nit would show me in this marker\narea what they all mean.\n\n521\n00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:35.440\nOne trick I like to do with markers\nif I'm supposed to make corrections,\n\n522\n00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.330\nthis is a little trick,\nI will turn it red.\n\n523\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.240\nAnd then when I'm done with it I\nwill turn it green that I have\n\n524\n00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.890\neffectively made that change.\n\n525\n00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.507\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthey're like your own internal notes.\n\n526\n00:27:44.507 --> 00:27:46.602\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stoplights,\nthey're like my own internal stoplight.\n\n527\n00:27:46.602 --> 00:27:48.000\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and\n\n528\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.360\nI will often tell people please\nlook at all the red markers, okay?\n\n529\n00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:52.900\nSo yeah.\n\n530\n00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.550\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that was exciting.\n\n531\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.203\n&gt;&gt; I'm a fan.\n\n532\n00:27:55.203 --> 00:27:58.475\n&gt;&gt; I love a good montage and\neverybody does, so\n\n533\n00:27:58.475 --> 00:28:02.106\nnow we've got our basics to go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n534\n00:28:02.106 --> 00:28:06.000\n&gt;&gt; And you can see it now, by highlighting\nthe program, there's the menu.\n\n535\n00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.860\nThere's the menu of all of\nthem that I've used, okay?\n\n536\n00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.780\nAnd I can write myself notes.\n\n537\n00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:19.080\nIf I'm highlighted on one,\nturn them all red, whatever I need to do.\n\n538\n00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.705\nOr just see the red ones,\ndouble-click, change that to red.\n\n539\n00:28:23.705 --> 00:28:26.083\nThese are our views, so,\nnow just show me everything that's red,\n\n540\n00:28:26.083 --> 00:28:27.682\neverything that's not done-\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n541\n00:28:27.682 --> 00:28:29.405\n&gt;&gt; In the sequence.\nAnd I tend to leave notes for\n\n542\n00:28:29.405 --> 00:28:32.905\npeople when I'm working that way,\nespecially when it comes to effects.\n\n543\n00:28:32.905 --> 00:28:34.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, it's the comments.\n\n544\n00:28:34.552 --> 00:28:37.240\nI mean, it's the ones that you\nneed to know what I'm doing as\n\n545\n00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.350\nI'm going through a project because\nyou come back two days later, and\n\n546\n00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.790\nI totally forgot everything\nthat I was supposed to do.\n\n547\n00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.951\nBut if you put markers and put little\nnotes on it, it's gonna be perfect.\n\n548\n00:28:44.951 --> 00:28:45.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, cool.\n\n549\n00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.111\nSo yeah, there you go.\n\n550\n00:28:48.111 --> 00:28:50.750\n&gt;&gt; We got a pretty cool\nmontage going on there.\n\n551\n00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:51.363\n&gt;&gt; It's awesome, isn't it?\n\n552\n00:28:51.363 --> 00:28:52.012\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n553\n00:28:52.012 --> 00:28:52.720\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n554\n00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, awesome.\n\n555\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.300\nWell, thank you so much for\nsharing that with us.\n\n556\n00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.560\nI know I'm going to go and\nmake all my own montages of Fuego.\n\n557\n00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.970\n&gt;&gt; Everybody's getting\na Christmas present of-\n\n558\n00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:03.757\n&gt;&gt; I am, and now,\n\n559\n00:29:03.757 --> 00:29:05.947\nbefore I just made\nthe Christmas [CROSSTALK]\n\n560\n00:29:05.947 --> 00:29:07.025\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n561\n00:29:07.025 --> 00:29:09.043\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now they're gonna get a video\n\n562\n00:29:09.043 --> 00:29:09.843\nmontage, so.\n\n563\n00:29:09.843 --> 00:29:11.686\n[LAUGH] But thank you so much for that.\n\n564\n00:29:11.686 --> 00:29:14.510\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this on up.\n\n565\n00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.283\nWe'll go ahead and

another\nexciting episode of Creative ProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.790\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\nwe are continuing on our series for\n\n5\n00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.480\nAdobe Premier Pro CC 2017.\n\n6\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.810\nAnd with us in the studios is Mr.\nJames Biddle, hey.\n\n7\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.390\n&gt;&gt; Hi everybody, it's good to be back.\n\n8\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.300\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why I wanted\nto just do that whole thing.\n\n9\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.650\n&gt;&gt; I love it, you can just keep doing it.\n\n10\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.510\nIf glitter was thrown,\nit'd be even better.\n\n11\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.070\nGlitter bombs.\n\n12\n00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.430\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that would be amazing.\n\n13\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.762\n&gt;&gt; There was no glitter\nbombs effect in Adobe, but.\n\n14\n00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:42.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But we're are gonna\nbe talking about speed effects.\n\n15\n00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.170\nDoes that when I talk really fast and\ngo, go, go, go go?\n\n16\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.412\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nExactly, exactly.\n\n17\n00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.030\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I do that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.871\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're gonna be\n\n19\n00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:47.814\nchanging some speed.\n\n20\n00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:51.242\nA lot of people ask me about,\nthey want to do some things they've seen.\n\n21\n00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:53.135\nThey wanna speed this up,\nthey wanna slow this down.\n\n22\n00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:54.290\nHow do you do it?\n\n23\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.350\nWell just like everything in Adobe,\n\n24\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.900\nthere's about seven different ways,\nmaybe more.\n\n25\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.310\nI don't know, but\nthere's a lot of different ways to do it.\n\n26\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.550\nAnd in this case,\nyou use what you need to use at the time,\n\n27\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.210\nnot just what you prefer, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.270\nSo I've got a clip here and it's just\na simple pan, or a panorama shot,\n\n29\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.820\nthat I did in Colombia.\n\n30\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.949\nMy wife is from Colombia so\nthis is in Medellín.\n\n31\n00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:19.940\nIt's a great grandeur view close\nto the top of a very large rock.\n\n32\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.980\nAnd there is audio, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.620\nNow what I've done is sort of the generic,\nI am panning the camera, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.560\nAnd it's just that this\nreally slows speed.\n\n35\n00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.380\nWhich is fine, but in many cases, I'd\nlike to make it a little more exciting.\n\n36\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.168\nHow do I do that?\n\n37\n00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:40.890\nAll right, first of all,\nwe're gonna get it in a sequence.\n\n38\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.910\nLast time, I made a speed change.\n\n39\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.530\nWhat I did was I was on the left side,\nthe source side and I said,\n\n40\n00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.910\ncrank it down from one\nframe rate to another.\n\n41\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.640\nI didn't setup this shop that way.\n\n42\n00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.327\nSo, I'm going to do this in the sequence,\nokay?\n\n43\n00:01:55.327 --> 00:01:58.150\nNow, again,\nnumerous ways to make a sequence.\n\n44\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.638\nI'm not gonna create a custom one.\n\n45\n00:01:59.638 --> 00:02:03.850\nI'm not gonna do the whole super,\nmake new, and choose all that.\n\n46\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.150\nAgain, I can Ctrl click it, and\nI can say New Sequence from Clip.\n\n47\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:17.240\nOr I can simply drag it over the New Item\nicon which is right over here.\n\n48\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.860\nCome here, come here sweetie,\njust come here.\n\n49\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.210\nIt's not gonna, it hates me today, okay.\n\n50\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.110\nI could drag it over this right here,\nand it will do the same thing.\n\n51\n00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.180\nOr, notice drag media\nhere to create sequence.\n\n52\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.170\nClick, drag, sequence.\n\n53\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.030\nSo it's like there\nare numerous ways to do this.\n\n54\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.790\nNow, you will notice there\nare markers here, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.460\nBecause these are source markers,\nI put them on the source,\n\n56\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.350\nthey will translate down into\nthe timeline if I allow that.\n\n57\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.325\nIn some cases I may say that I\ndon't want to see clip markers.\n\n58\n00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:55.100\n&gt;&gt; And this might be a silly question.\n\n59\n00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.210\nHow did you get the markers\nin your source file?\n\n60\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.450\nLike on the actual device that\nyou used to record it with?\n\n61\n00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually that's a great question,\nbecause there is a side program that\n\n62\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.020\nyou can use on an iPad,\nwhich will do that.\n\n63\n00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.950\nOr in most cases, again,\nI can just come through here and\n\n64\n00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.567\nthen hit the m key, and\nit pops a marker, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.490\nAnd notice it updated it down here.\n\n66\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.100\nSo it updated me to four.\n\n67\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.160\n&gt;&gt; But you didn't bring this into\nPremiere and put the markers on.\n\n68\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.393\nYou're saying you did\nthat on a separate film.\n\n69\n00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:28.694\n&gt;&gt; No, no I just, no, no, but\nthere is a way to do that.\n\n70\n00:03:28.694 --> 00:03:30.375\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Which we're gonna cover a little\n\n71\n00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:33.890\nbit later, that some people adore,\nand some people absolutely hate.\n\n72\n00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.160\nBut, I can do it right here, and\nI just did these beforehand.\n\n73\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.368\nI prepped them before you got here.\n\n74\n00:03:40.368 --> 00:03:40.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n75\n00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.747\nI'm just making sure I\ndidn't miss anything.\n\n76\n00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:43.297\n&gt;&gt; I threw you a curve ball.\n\n77\n00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:45.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I threw you a curve ball.\n\n78\n00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:46.485\nAnd I stayed up and did it, I'm sorry.\n\n79\n00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:51.113\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was making sure,\nI was like, does your camera do that?\n\n80\n00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:51.721\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, well,\n\n81\n00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:55.025\nlike I said there are some devices\nwhere you can get something like this.\n\n82\n00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:59.880\nNow, I'm gonna change to my workspace and\ncreate a call editing LT,\n\n83\n00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.823\nwhere I get a really long thing like that.\n\n84\n00:04:02.823 --> 00:04:05.580\nAll right, so how do I manipulate time?\n\n85\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.680\nThere's several different ways.\n\n86\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.630\nSince this is linked I can Ctrl click it,\nscroll down.\n\n87\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.800\nAnd notice there's a thing\ncalled Speed and Duration.\n\n88\n00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.456\nAnd what I can do is I can give\nit an overall speed change.\n\n89\n00:04:23.456 --> 00:04:26.921\nLike I could say, let's say I'd\nlike this to be a little faster,\n\n90\n00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:28.720\nI'd like it to go up to 150%.\n\n91\n00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.058\nNow that doesn't mean, it just means 150%.\n\n92\n00:04:33.058 --> 00:04:36.113\nNot 100%, 150%, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:36.113 --> 00:04:39.510\nAnd it's telling me the new duration and\nthey are locked.\n\n94\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.900\nNow, I can say maintain the audio\npitch if I care about the audio.\n\n95\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.940\nAnd it will do its best to maintain pitch,\n\n96\n00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.483\nso it doesn't sound all squeaky chipmunk,\nokay?\n\n97\n00:04:51.483 --> 00:04:56.356\nOr, squishy deep voice,\nif I make it slower, okay?\n\n98\n00:04:56.356 --> 00:04:58.320\nI have different types of interpolation.\n\n99\n00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.530\nI can do Frame Sampling,\nFrame Blending, Optical Flow.\n\n100\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.160\nHonestly, the best way to learn about\nthis is just go through the online help\n\n101\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.550\nas to which one.\n\n102\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.730\nRight now,\nI'm just gonna do Frame Sampling.\n\n103\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.481\nTaking samples of frames\nto create new frames, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:20.393\nThe optical flow, this is sort of like\nthe super amazing version of this,\n\n105\n00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:23.500\nbut you better have some\ngreat media in there.\n\n106\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.117\nI have got phone media in there.\n\n107\n00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.452\nSo the frame sampling,\nto me, is just fine.\n\n108\n00:05:28.452 --> 00:05:29.780\nI can also reverse this.\n\n109\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.030\nThis is the easiest way to reverse it,\nmake it go backwards.\n\n110\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.400\nRipple Edit, Shifting Trailing Clips,\nI'm gonna demonstrate this in a second.\n\n111\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.860\nSo I click OK, and\nI've made an overall speed change.\n\n112\n00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.560\nThis is what throws people,\nit seems to be shorter.\n\n113\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.650\nWell of course, it's faster so\nit's not gonna take as much time.\n\n114\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.130\nSo, here we go.\n\n115\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.600\nIt's rendering out, and there it is.\n\n116\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.830\nIt's going a little bit\nfaster than before, okay?\n\n117\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.260\nSo that's just an overall speed change.\n\n118\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.459\nIf I had another clip on\nthe other end of this,\n\n119\n00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:05.330\nI'm just gonna drag something\nover very quickly, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.859\nAnd watch.\n\n121\n00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:07.250\nI'm not even gonna put\nit in the source window.\n\n122\n00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.416\nI'm just gonna drag and\npop it right there, and\n\n123\n00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:12.802\nI made the effective speed change.\n\n124\n00:06:12.802 --> 00:06:14.882\nDo the same thing, Ctrl.\n\n125\n00:06:14.882 --> 00:06:18.090\n[INAUDIBLE] Speed duration.\n\n126\n00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.639\nIn this case I\"m going to make it 50%,\n\n127\n00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.390\nI'm gonna slow it down,\nmaintain the audio pitch.\n\n128\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.040\nNow what does this mean?\n\n129\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.400\nRipple Edit, Shifting Trailing Clips.\n\n130\n00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.670\nRemember when we were\ndoing ripple edits and\n\n131\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.000\nI said if you do\na one-sided it affects it?\n\n132\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.520\nOkay?\n\n133\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.090\nThings are gonna move forward or backward.\n\n134\n00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.480\nIf this is off, okay,\nit keeps it there, okay?\n\n135\n00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.300\nIt's slower.\n\n136\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.860\nLet me speed it up to show you.\n\n137\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.381\nSlowing down isn't gonna give\nyou sort of the right look.\n\n138\n00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:59.708\nLet me speed it up to 200%,\nmaintain the audio pitch.\n\n139\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.020\nBoom.\n\n140\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.770\nNothing moves, nothing on the opposite\nend moves, it doesn't ripple.\n\n141\n00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.300\nIf I do it one more time,\nI know this seems pretty tedious, but\n\n142\n00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.940\nI want everybody to see every\nsingle example of what can happen.\n\n143\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.940\nBecause there's a lot of choices.\n\n144\n00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.380\nSpeed duration and if I say, let's go 300.\n\n145\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.660\nLet's go kinda crazy, and\nthen say ripple the edit.\n\n146\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.970\nIt moves.\n\n147\n00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.530\nSo that means the entire, there are more\nthings back there all of it would move.\n\n148\n00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.360\nAll of it would move, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.300\nSo that's what the ripple portion means.\n\n150\n00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.930\nIt does the entire segment.\n\n151\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.890\nIt does the entire segment.\n\n152\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.730\nSometimes that's what you want.\n\n153\n00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.345\nSometimes you're not so sure.\n\n154\n00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.920\nI'm gonna get rid of this one so\nI can demonstrate a little better.\n\n155\n00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.818\nSometimes you're not sure how much you\nwant to speed it up or slow it down.\n\n156\n00:07:56.818 --> 00:07:59.697\nSo there's a tool for that, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:59.697 --> 00:08:04.381\nAnd I think I made my tools go away,\nwhich was a silly thing to do.\n\n158\n00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:07.723\nBut if I go to Window and say Tools,\n\n159\n00:08:07.723 --> 00:08:13.380\nop not Timelines, Tools,\nit pops back up for me.\n\n160\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.040\nYou know I got rid of it,\nI lost it, so there it is.\n\n161\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.460\nI'm gonna come over here and if you\nremember there was the ripple edit tool.\n\n162\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:28.140\nIf I click here, Scroll down,\nI get a Rate Stretch Tool.\n\n163\n00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.710\nSo now it's the Rate Stretch Tool,\nand many people are familiar\n\n164\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.650\nwith this from other systems they\nmay have worked around with.\n\n165\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:42.090\nIf I grab the ends, and stretch it out,\nit's now telling me the new duration, ok?\n\n166\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.460\nNow it's really slow.\n\n167\n00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.190\nThere was no pitch option.\n\n168\n00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.140\nThere is no maintaining pitch\noption anything like that.\n\n169\n00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.270\nIt's just a really fast stretching\nthe rate, making it really, and\n\n170\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.640\nyou get let me just stretch out the view.\n\n171\n00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.820\nIt gives you the percentage of\nhow fast it's going now, so\n\n172\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.335\nit's going at 358 percent.\n\n173\n00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:08.690\n[SOUND] And everybody's all\nsqueaky chipmunk people so okay.\n\n174\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.146\nNow.\n\n175\n00:09:10.146 --> 00:09:13.190\n&gt;&gt; So you don't have as\nmany options with the tool.\n\n176\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.630\n&gt;&gt; You don't have as many\noptions with the tool.\n\n177\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.335\n&gt;&gt; But sometimes you just need to affect\na really quick rate change and it's fine.\n\n178\n00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:26.685\nNow, now let's get to the final portion.\n\n179\n00:09:26.685 --> 00:09:31.298\nThis is where somebody says so, I've been\nwatching this show called Top Gear and you\n\n180\n00:09:31.298 --> 00:09:36.475\ngo, and\nthat's where you want it to speed up and\n\n181\n00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:40.220\nthen, slow down and then, speed back\nup and then, go to normal speed.\n\n182\n00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.110\nOkay, so that is called time remapping.\n\n183\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.200\nAnd we're gonna set up\nthe timeline to do this.\n\n184\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.730\nI'm actually gonna go back into\nthe editing workspace cuz I'm gonna need\n\n185\n00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.610\na few things in there.\n\n186\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.650\nLet me squish this up, squish that up.\n\n187\n00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:58.370\nOkay, good.\n\n188\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:04.350\nNow I'm gonna make a big, big\n\n189\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:09.510\nVideo here cuz believe it or not, and\nthis often frustrates people when\n\n190\n00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:15.110\nthey first get into this time remapping\nand they go, I'm gonna remap it all this.\n\n191\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:21.965\nTime remapping doesn't do Dp audio,\nit won't go anywhere near audio, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:26.505\nIf you use the tool,\nif you use speed duration, yes, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:26.505 --> 00:10:30.705\nOr if you do the over crank,\nunder crank and modifying interpolation,\n\n194\n00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:31.815\nyeah it will do that.\n\n195\n00:10:31.815 --> 00:10:36.310\nThis, absolutely not, this is video Only.\n\n196\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.870\nIf you need to manipulate the audio\nyou're going to have to go out and\n\n197\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:39.830\nfigure out how to do that.\n\n198\n00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:40.430\nOkay.\n\n199\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.530\nThere's a lot of ways but\nit's a lot of work.\n\n200\n00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.630\nSo I'm just going to\nleave the audio on there.\n\n201\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.120\nAnother thing that I'm going to need\nis I'm going to need those effect\n\n202\n00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.640\nbadges again.\n\n203\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.250\nSo you got the little FX on there, okay.\n\n204\n00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.130\nI need that.\n\n205\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.030\nIf I don't have that,\nmy life is not going to be fun.\n\n206\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.740\nI'm also gonna hit V so\nI get my selection tool.\n\n207\n00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:09.650\nHolding over the effects it says I'm on\nopacity, so this line represents opacity.\n\n208\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.230\nYes, I could actually key frame opacity.\n\n209\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.759\nWe did that when we faded up faded down.\n\n210\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.490\nI Ctrl click this is\nthe thing that upsets people,\n\n211\n00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:23.050\nCtrl click on the effects badge and\nI could take time remapping speed.\n\n212\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.830\nAll right so the line gets lower\nin this is weird white bar.\n\n213\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.540\nNow i'm gonna use my little\ntrick where I just use\n\n214\n00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.080\nthe command and\nnot have to go to the pen tool a lot.\n\n215\n00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.700\nOkay.\n\n216\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.970\nSo I remember on this it said you\nknow maybe you could slow this down.\n\n217\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.960\nAnd then speed it up and do all that.\n\n218\n00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.460\nOkay.\n\n219\n00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.160\nSo when I did key frames before,\n\n220\n00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.905\ndo you remember that when I created\nthat wacky thing the spinning cat.\n\n221\n00:11:53.905 --> 00:11:56.030\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, the dumb spinning cat.\n\n222\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.040\n&gt;&gt; Dumb spinning cat.\n\n223\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.932\nI love dumb spinning cat.\n\n224\n00:11:57.932 --> 00:11:59.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is my new band name.\n\n225\n00:11:59.487 --> 00:12:00.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dumb spinning cat\n\n226\n00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.110\nis going to be opening very soon for\nyour favorite band.\n\n227\n00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.930\nSo when I put the parameter on the key\nframe and then manipulated the key\n\n228\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.620\nframe itself, that's where I was\nmanipulating the key frame parameter.\n\n229\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.060\nIN the case of remapping you're\ngoing to drop key frames and\n\n230\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.940\nyou manipulate what's in between\nthe key frames all right?\n\n231\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.170\nSo let me go let me zoom\nin just a little bit.\n\n232\n00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.940\nSo I'm gonna come here,\nI'm gonna hold down Command.\n\n233\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.930\nCuz I could just drop the whole line,\njust like did drop the whole line and\n\n234\n00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:33.979\nit's just gonna do the duration.\n\n235\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.760\nOkay, it will do the whole thing,\nall right?\n\n236\n00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.510\nBoom and everything's done.\n\n237\n00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.030\nNow the point of time remapping is I\nreally want to do things within this.\n\n238\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.720\nSo I'm gonna hold down the command key and\nI get the little plus.\n\n239\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.810\nI'm gonna drop a keyframe here and\nI'm gonna drop a keyframe there.\n\n240\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:02.740\nNow to make this go slower I\ngrab the line and pull it down,\n\n241\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.950\ncome on, let's go, and\nit's been a problem, there we go, okay,\n\n242\n00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:14.300\nit's getting longer because it's slower,\nokay,\n\n243\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:21.540\nboom So\nI'm going to hit the plus minus okay.\n\n244\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.721\nAnd this is a linear change.\n\n245\n00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:31.950\nSo And now it gets slow, okay.\n\n246\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.435\nNow it gets slow.\n\n247\n00:13:33.435 --> 00:13:38.165\n[NOISE] As you could see, the audio,\neven though it's selected,\n\n248\n00:13:38.165 --> 00:13:40.667\nnot getting touched whatsoever.\n\n249\n00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:44.010\nSo I'm just gonna get rid of the audio,\nboom.\n\n250\n00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.210\nAnd now it's slow, okay?\n\n251\n00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:53.000\nAt this point the thing is, I'm gonna\nhave to trim it out to get more, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.690\nTo see more.\n\n253\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.840\nIf I don't I'm in trouble.\n\n254\n00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.560\nSo now I've slowed this down\nWhen I come to the next area here,\n\n255\n00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.290\nalso okay, come in, drop the key frame.\n\n256\n00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.690\nAnd in this area,\nI wanna it to actually speed up.\n\n257\n00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.700\nSo now it's gonna go really slow though,\nlike 400%.\n\n258\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.990\nAnd it's like I,\nwe often call it a whip pan,\n\n259\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.830\nit's like I whip panned\nit over all of a sudden.\n\n260\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.620\nCome here you, come here you silly thing.\n\n261\n00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.680\nSometimes when you zoom in on these,\nit gets upset.\n\n262\n00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.995\nSo here we go, really slow,\nthat's really slow, that's really slow.\n\n263\n00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:32.064\nBa-bam.\n\n264\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.630\nOver it goes, and\nthen it's really slow again.\n\n265\n00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.090\nThat's the point of time remapping, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:44.570\nThe point of time remapping is you\nare remapping all of its time.\n\n267\n00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.600\nAnd you can do a.\nA lot of this.\n\n268\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.800\nNow often people say that doesn't\nreally look like a keyframe to me.\n\n269\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.460\nYou're gonna love this.\n\n270\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.570\nYou love those handles, and so do I.\n\n271\n00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.540\nRight now this is a hold.\n\n272\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.850\nRemember when we did the hold it\njust goes from one to another.\n\n273\n00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.540\n&gt;&gt; The quick jumps, yeah.\n\n274\n00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.520\n&gt;&gt; Just pop, pop, there it is, okay.\n\n275\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:11.305\nIf I take this And I open it up,\nokay come on there we go.\n\n276\n00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:14.160\nNow it's a linear change\nnow it's a linear.\n\n277\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.270\n&gt;&gt; It's like two halves of the.\n\n278\n00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The little chevron little thing.\n\n279\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.250\n&gt;&gt; Right, now if I zoom in really close,\n\n280\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.825\nwe will see is now theres a busy handle\n&gt;&gt; Come here, dear.\n\n281\n00:15:28.825 --> 00:15:30.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I zoomed in too much.\n\n282\n00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.070\n&gt;&gt; Where did we go?\n&gt;&gt; I zoomed in too much, no!\n\n283\n00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.930\nOkay, so yeah, and I have a bezier\nhandle and what I can do now is a curve.\n\n284\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.490\nI can grab the handle and I can make\na curve, so now it's not linear,\n\n285\n00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.220\nit is curved.\n\n286\n00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.600\nIt is almost like for people that\nhave used things, this is almost like\n\n287\n00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.407\ncreating and ease in and ease\n&gt;&gt; This out and\n\n288\n00:15:50.407 --> 00:15:52.291\nit creates smoother transition.\n\n289\n00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:55.810\nSo this is how I can\nmanipulate all of these,\n\n290\n00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:01.342\nlet me stretch it a little more,\nokay I'm getting more, okay good.\n\n291\n00:16:01.342 --> 00:16:05.791\nAnd then if I drag it up and\ngo even faster, faster,\n\n292\n00:16:05.791 --> 00:16:10.862\nfaster, faster, faster,\nI have a nice gradual change,\n\n293\n00:16:10.862 --> 00:16:15.647\ninstead of like a boom pops it and\nyeah, and then down.\n\n294\n00:16:15.647 --> 00:16:16.617\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n295\n00:16:16.617 --> 00:16:17.572\n&gt;&gt; You know what this is often--\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n296\n00:16:17.572 --> 00:16:19.616\nit's that ease that comes in and out.\n\n297\n00:16:19.616 --> 00:16:21.490\n&gt;&gt; You know what this is good for?\n\n298\n00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.469\nOccasionally maybe you are,\nyou have subjects and what happens is they\n\n299\n00:16:25.469 --> 00:16:30.059\nturn their head, but their head turn\nseems very unnatural they're almost like.\n\n300\n00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:34.411\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You do time code remapping that's\n\n301\n00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:39.229\nkind of make it look like, Like that,\ntimely mapping [CROSSTALK].\n\n302\n00:16:39.229 --> 00:16:44.690\nYeah, or like I said it's a pretty good,\nshot but it's I linger so long.\n\n303\n00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.209\nAnd I feel like, can you speed it up or\n\n304\n00:16:46.209 --> 00:16:49.298\nmaybe at this point which is the most\ninteresting part of this shot is here,\n\n305\n00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:51.478\ncould you slow it down here and\nthen speed it back up?\n\n306\n00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:53.580\nSo, this is time remapping.\n\n307\n00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.140\nAgain, your audio will not conform to it,\nwhatsoever.\n\n308\n00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.240\nLet me show you something.\n\n309\n00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.720\nLet me go back to editing and\nI hit the audio one, and I click it.\n\n310\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.300\nAnd I go to effects controls,\nthere's time remapping, and\n\n311\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.370\nyeah, I can see all of it in here.\n\n312\n00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:16.850\nI could have technically\nmanipulated all of it from in here.\n\n313\n00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:19.053\n&gt;&gt; This is that whole,\nyou can do it six different ways.\n\n314\n00:17:19.053 --> 00:17:19.558\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; RIght,\n\n315\n00:17:19.558 --> 00:17:20.830\nyou can do it six different ways.\n\n316\n00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:21.480\nI've noticed for\n\n317\n00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.300\nme, when I don't manipulate it down in\nthe timeline, It's very difficult, but\n\n318\n00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.310\nI know people that when they do it in the\ntimeline it's very difficult for them and\n\n319\n00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.720\nwhen they do it again,\nthey do something like lightning fast.\n\n320\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And they really get into it.\n\n321\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.010\nSo there's two ways to do this that\nmake people feel more comfortable.\n\n322\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:41.970\nBut because it is an effect, you can\nsee the result in the effects controls.\n\n323\n00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.700\nYou can absolutely see it\nin the effects controls.\n\n324\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could have done it right\nthere in the sort of small, but\n\n325\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.270\nI call it a tiny.\n\n326\n00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; In the effects because\n\n327\n00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.790\nthey just kind of know exactly\nwhere you need to put it.\n\n328\n00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I say like the more visualment\n\n329\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.720\non the timeline for\nme what my brain is looking for.\n\n330\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.290\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, don't be taking that into\nconsideration like in some effects I\n\n331\n00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:08.760\nabsolutely want to work with the numbers\nand the parameters like that.\n\n332\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.090\nIn others, I need it visual.\n\n333\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.730\nAnd so they offer both.\n\n334\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.070\nAnd I like the fact that they\noffer the fact that well,\n\n335\n00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.910\nit's happening in the timeline so we'll\ngive you a visual in the timeline, okay,\n\n336\n00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.200\nand will still if you\nprefer it up here and\n\n337\n00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.210\nin fact the controls will\nstill give you one up there.\n\n338\n00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.010\nThis is one of those things where I\nsay this is fun to play around with,\n\n339\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:32.840\njust take some weird media and\nget used to it.\n\n340\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.680\nHere's the other thing.\n\n341\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.150\nYes, you can save it as a preset.\n\n342\n00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.490\nSo if you've always got a shot where\nit's supposed to speed up, slow down,\n\n343\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.900\nstop, yeah, you can save that preset.\n\n344\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:51.670\nAnd it does the exact same\nthing where save preset.\n\n345\n00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.440\nCome on, I don't know why\nthe dialogue's not coming up, but\n\n346\n00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.520\nthe dialogue will come up.\n\n347\n00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.440\nAnd you do the exact same thing.\n\n348\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.209\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And\n\n349\n00:18:58.209 --> 00:19:01.739\nthen you can apply it to any other\ntype of sequence anywhere else.\n\n350\n00:19:01.739 --> 00:19:03.907\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and then boom.\n\n351\n00:19:03.907 --> 00:19:06.840\nYou just drop them in and\nthen make small changes.\n\n352\n00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.630\nIt's really great, and so\n\n353\n00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.870\nthat's why this also speeds up your\nwork flow, because here's another thing.\n\n354\n00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.829\nDidn't I do some stuff in that last\nsequence before I opened this new project?\n\n355\n00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.930\nI did some parameters on some things like\nchange them around with all this stuff.\n\n356\n00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.955\nYeah, I think I did, and what happens is\npeople are like, well, how do I get that?\n\n357\n00:19:30.955 --> 00:19:32.370\nBecause I didn't save it.\n\n358\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:34.458\nWatch this.\n\n359\n00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:41.480\nI'm going to go into the media browser,\nopen it up and,\n\n360\n00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:47.460\nI believe I have some sequences over here\nin the lessons, something like that.\n\n361\n00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:54.970\nI think I put something in here maybe,\nlet's find out, let's find out what I did.\n\n362\n00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.580\nOkay, lessons af private it created,\nwell actually no,\n\n363\n00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.170\nit's in this one here, I think.\n\n364\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.560\nOr no, you know where it is,\nit's in my user, right?\n\n365\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.960\nI think I saved that in there,\nlet's take a look.\n\n366\n00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.720\nI can also search if I wanted to.\n\n367\n00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.270\nSo let's go into users.\n\n368\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.850\nYeah, I used the default.\n\n369\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.290\nRemember, I used the default\nto save everything.\n\n370\n00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.920\n&gt;&gt; That weird folder that has like 11?\n\n371\n00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.950\n&gt;&gt; Documents, yeah Premiere Pro,\nthere's the 11th.\n\n372\n00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.090\nLook there it is.\n\n373\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.470\nHey, there's something\ncalled copy of IT Pro.\n\n374\n00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.205\nIf I highlight that,\nit's going to probably take a second,\n\n375\n00:20:32.205 --> 00:20:35.663\nbecause it's going to do\nsomething with Dynamic Link.\n\n376\n00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:41.234\nOkay, and I will say, sequences,\nyeah, I had some, yeah,\n\n377\n00:20:41.234 --> 00:20:43.396\nthere's the Watermelon Sequence.\n\n378\n00:20:45.817 --> 00:20:46.852\nImport.\n\n379\n00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.230\nAnd there it is.\n\n380\n00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.970\nAnd it's like yeah right, crazy I did\nthis thing in here that I didn't save.\n\n381\n00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:59.960\nI can now take it off of that.\n\n382\n00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.570\nSo I'm looking at a sequence from\na completely different project and\n\n383\n00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.260\nthe reason I could bring it in\nis because of the media browser.\n\n384\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:12.050\nThe media browser doesn't\njust do pieces of media.\n\n385\n00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.770\nYou can bring in a sequence from\nan old project into this one.\n\n386\n00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.320\nOkay, you can bring it in,\nit will have to modify it,\n\n387\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.000\nit's from an older one,\nand then boom, okay.\n\n388\n00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.130\nAnd then one last cool thing.\n\n389\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:29.970\nWe talked about moving the interfaces,\nthis interface around, this workspace.\n\n390\n00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.060\nIf I just pick one up, okay,\nI'm just going to pick it up.\n\n391\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.210\nNotice, here's what happens,\nokay, I'm going to try.\n\n392\n00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.400\nIt kind of puts it in this area.\n\n393\n00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:46.390\nIf I put it here, that's going\nto end up off to the side, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.010\nThat ends up off to\nthe side of the trapezoid.\n\n395\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.730\nIf I grab it by the watermelon and\n\n396\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:57.940\nput it in the center, now it's back\nto being two panels side by side.\n\n397\n00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.880\nThat's what most people do, they either\nput off to the side or within the panel.\n\n398\n00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.810\nBut if I drag it,\nwatermelon come on you can do it.\n\n399\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:10.048\nI'm going to try something\nkind of shifty here,\n\n400\n00:22:10.048 --> 00:22:14.275\nwhere people say why would you do this?\n\n401\n00:22:14.275 --> 00:22:16.451\nI now have two sequences\nright on top of each other.\n\n402\n00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:17.315\n&gt;&gt; They're stacked.\n\n403\n00:22:17.315 --> 00:22:20.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a version of stacked.\n\n404\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.350\nSo I can put two sequences\non top of each other.\n\n405\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.330\nSo if I need to drag things from one\nsequence into another I can do that.\n\n406\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:30.970\nI can just say okay, yeah,\nI need this, give me that.\n\n407\n00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:34.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is like in Photoshop you\ncan drag and drop between your files and\n\n408\n00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.250\neverything and\n\n409\n00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:38.350\nyou just now it makes a new layer,\nat least that's what I'm equating it to.\n\n410\n00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:42.140\n&gt;&gt; You just have to be careful and monitor\nwhat's blue, because a lot of people start\n\n411\n00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.710\ndoing stuff in this lower one and\nthis is the one that's active.\n\n412\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.270\nSo you just have to make sure you know\nwhat's blue, but this is a stacked area.\n\n413\n00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.870\nAnd I know a lot of people will do this.\n\n414\n00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.360\nThey don't like that their\nsequences line up this way, so\n\n415\n00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.960\nthey'll just drag it in the trapezoid, so\nto speak, like I'll drag it back down and\n\n416\n00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.800\nI'll put it then center and there you go.\n\n417\n00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.930\n&gt;&gt; And now you have it grouped in tabs.\n\n418\n00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.185\n&gt;&gt; Right, the other thing is the green.\n\n419\n00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:08.130\nA lot of people don't\nknow about the green?\n\n420\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:13.220\nSo if I'm dragging and I get either\nthe quads to put it all inside or\n\n421\n00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.930\nput it within the panel,\nthat's within a panel.\n\n422\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:21.050\nWithin the program panel, within\nthe effects controls area, all of that.\n\n423\n00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:27.330\nIf I take this, drop it in there,\nbut if I take this out, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.110\nCome on,\nsometimes it's a little difficult.\n\n425\n00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.930\nI can, come on, you know you can.\n\n426\n00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.733\nThere it is, see that green line?\n\n427\n00:23:35.685 --> 00:23:38.160\nThat's the top of the entire work space.\n\n428\n00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.380\nSo now this timeline,\n\n429\n00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.270\nthis sequence has taken over\nthe entire top of the work space.\n\n430\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:50.740\nWhen I often show that to people it's\nlike I don't know why I would do that.\n\n431\n00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.780\nWell, one thing that I recommend to people\nis that if you do a lot of heavy audio\n\n432\n00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:59.500\nwork, now we have the world's\nbiggest audiometers up at the top.\n\n433\n00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.213\nIt's crazy.\n\n434\n00:24:01.213 --> 00:24:04.677\nSo you can have this huge\naudiometers off at the top.\n\n435\n00:24:04.677 --> 00:24:06.977\nAnd I know a lot of people that do that,\nthat's exactly what they want.\n\n436\n00:24:06.977 --> 00:24:07.908\nWant.\n\n437\n00:24:07.908 --> 00:24:08.508\nOkay.\n\n438\n00:24:08.508 --> 00:24:09.398\nLook, see.\n\n439\n00:24:09.398 --> 00:24:10.014\nLook at that.\n\n440\n00:24:10.014 --> 00:24:12.270\nThose are some audio meters.\n\n441\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.360\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know there was that many\ncompartments, if you want to say it,\n\n442\n00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.720\nwithin the work space.\n\n443\n00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Guess what?\nIt doesn't have to be at the top.\n\n444\n00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.730\nI could say, I like the ones on the side,\nbut get that big green bar.\n\n445\n00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.480\nNow I have really huge\nones right on the side.\n\n446\n00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.640\nSo this as I said as you start doing some\nadvanced things there's some advanced ways\n\n447\n00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.140\nyou can set things up.\n\n448\n00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.610\nSo as I'm doing more advanced stuff\nI'm setting them up this way.\n\n449\n00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.750\nThat's why I just don't leap into it.\n\n450\n00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.030\nSo there you go.\n\n451\n00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:38.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's me.\n\n452\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:42.190\nI did not know there were that\nmany places in MW workspace.\n\n453\n00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.340\nSo I've never done that.\n\n454\n00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSure.\n\n455\n00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:44.710\nThat's great.\n\n456\n00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.510\nSo if you have to contain\nit to this big chunky bar.\n\n457\n00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.100\nThat's a great way to do it.\n\n458\n00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.340\nCool.\n&gt;&gt; That's really cool.\n\n459\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so that's I mean those are speed\neffects they're really fun and\n\n460\n00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.310\nthen in the next lesson we're\ngetting to even more stuff.\n\n461\n00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.430\n&gt;&gt; Even more.\n\n462\n00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.260\n&gt;&gt; Even more stuff that will\nreally help your story telling and\n\n463\n00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.600\nreally make you happier that,\nit's one of those things as an editor\n\n464\n00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.620\npeople are saying what software\nshould I use to become an editor?\n\n465\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:15.480\nAnd it's like first of all Learn to\ntell a story to become an editor.\n\n466\n00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.210\nLearn about storytelling techniques,\nit's like doing graphics.\n\n467\n00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.930\nLearn where the eye goes, learn where what\ncolors go together and things like that.\n\n468\n00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:25.040\nThe reason why I harp on people about\nlearning the software is the more\n\n469\n00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.420\ncomfortable you are with the software,\nthe more you focus on your storytelling.\n\n470\n00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:34.250\nThe more you focus on really getting\ninto what the audience needs\n\n471\n00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.260\nto see not being scared of maybe\nI could do that but I don't know.\n\n472\n00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.950\nI don't want to touch it and all that.\n\n473\n00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.560\nGet comfortable and get in there.\n\n474\n00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.360\nOkay, awesome.\n\n475\n00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.390\n&gt;&gt; I think that's a good lesson.\n\n476\n00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:50.920\nAnd so in anything,\nwe talk about the z layout in the design.\n\n477\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.890\nWhy that's important where your eye\nactually travels in an advertisement.\n\n478\n00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.670\nAnd you just pull a magazine out you see,\nthat's.\n\n479\n00:25:57.826 --> 00:26:00.110\nNot just kind of pulling\nit all willy nilly.\n\n480\n00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:05.079\n&gt;&gt; I'd like to say, one of the things\nis we have to get over being amazed by\n\n481\n00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:08.240\nthe rabbit coming out of the hat.\n\n482\n00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.570\nWe now know how the rabbit comes out of\nthe hat and when we see magic tricks we're\n\n483\n00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:16.980\nthinking of, it did that, [INAUDIBLE],\nbut I don't know how this works.\n\n484\n00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.200\nBut you still see the creativity and\nyou still see how it wows and\n\n485\n00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.265\nan audience just loves it.\n\n486\n00:26:22.265 --> 00:26:27.320\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great closing remark\nhere and our timing that we're looking for\n\n487\n00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.814\nat our episode, so-\n&gt;&gt; I tried to speed it up.\n\n488\n00:26:29.814 --> 00:26:34.020\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] No\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n489\n00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.060\ntake our time to say thank you so\nmuch for watching.\n\n490\n00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.610\nI enjoyed that, that was really exciting.\n\n491\n00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.010\nWell I hope you enjoy it as well.\n\n492\n00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.930\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n493\n00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.380\nAnd we'll be back with some more.\n\n494\n00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.410\nSigning off for\nCreative ProTV i'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n495\n00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.626\n&gt;&gt; I'm Jim Liddle.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n496\n00:26:49.626 --> 00:26:54.576\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm trying, I'm trying so hard.\n\n10\n00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're keeping on, keeping on.\n\n11\n00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.380\n&gt;&gt; We're keeping on, keeping on.\n\n12\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.060\n&gt;&gt; Even more.\n\n13\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.880\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\nwe're doing this new Lumtri Color setup.\n\n14\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.450\nThe workspace called Color.\n\n15\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.190\nIn Premiere Pro, working our way down.\n\n16\n00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.000\nAnd if we go back,\nwe'd just gone past curves, okay?\n\n17\n00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.180\nAnd we had a lovely conversation about\ncurves versus color wheels, okay?\n\n18\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.150\nSo curves is, if you use Photoshop\na lot you use curves all the time.\n\n19\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.860\nOkay, because when you do like a photo,\nor if you used to do film.\n\n20\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.380\nWhen you would process it, the\nrelationship between the colors affected,\n\n21\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.540\nwhat was bright, what was dark,\nwhat was mid tone.\n\n22\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.490\nOkay, well, in television,\nthat wasn't really the case.\n\n23\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.940\nThey used to send the signal to you.\n\n24\n00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.400\nAs the luma was bright, dark,\nand mid-tone in one signal.\n\n25\n00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.910\nAnd then they would send the chroma\ninformation, red, green,\n\n26\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.550\nblue, in a separate signal so people could\nstill have black and white televisions and\n\n27\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.610\nstill get signal.\n\n28\n00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.450\nSo when you go to color wheels,\nokay, you have a slider, and\n\n29\n00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.480\nthen you have shadows,\nmid-tones, and highlights.\n\n30\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.080\nYou have a slider that adjusts luma.\n\n31\n00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.610\nWhat's bright and dark in the mid tones,\nthe shadows and the highlights.\n\n32\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.660\nThen you have a color wheel,\nto adjust color,\n\n33\n00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.220\nthe hue of the color\nthat's being affected.\n\n34\n00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.950\nThat's why they call it hue, saturation.\n\n35\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.910\nThey call it HSL color wheels.\n\n36\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.070\nIn this case they just\ncall it color wheel.\n\n37\n00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.290\nSo one of the reasons I might\nwant to do that is this,\n\n38\n00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.730\nI mean it's a nice shot but because of the\nlight I'm not getting a lot of definition.\n\n39\n00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.640\nI've also noticed that my\nshadows are a little buried.\n\n40\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.340\nNow, when you start reading about color\ncorrection and doing color correction,\n\n41\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.940\neverybody has theories about these\nas to which one you start with\n\n42\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.590\nwe all kind of agree don't start with the\nmidtones, you either start with shadows or\n\n43\n00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.410\nhighlights, and then you do your midtones.\n\n44\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.330\nIt's like shadows or\nhighlights make it look correct, and\n\n45\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.780\nthen the midtones make it arch.\n\n46\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.470\nThat's what a lot of\nus just say to people,\n\n47\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.510\nit's like that's just what you do okay?\n\n48\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.940\nSo I usually start with shadows and\n\n49\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.950\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\njust lift this up slightly.\n\n50\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.920\nSo that there's not that crush at zero.\n\n51\n00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.430\nThere's no longer a line there.\n\n52\n00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.850\nI don't have a crush.\n\n53\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.360\nAnd you'll notice there's\na little more definition in here.\n\n54\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.040\nIt's a little hard to see.\n\n55\n00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.100\nNow I'll take the highlights and\n\n56\n00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.520\nI'll bring them up just slightly\nto around the 255 area.\n\n57\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.793\nThat would equate to\n100 on the other side.\n\n58\n00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:57.988\nNow, I'll take the mid-tones and again,\n\n59\n00:02:57.988 --> 00:03:02.390\nmid-tones are the ones where I like to do\nyour technique, where I go, okay, way up.\n\n60\n00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.820\nNope, too much, too far down.\n\n61\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.740\nAnd a little accordion there.\n\n62\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.310\nGot a little more definition by\ngoing down just slightly, I love it.\n\n63\n00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.030\nNow, you could do this kind of fudge thing\nwhere I'm going to take the shadows up\n\n64\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.330\na little higher and\nthen do the midtone like that so\n\n65\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.340\nI don't, quote unquote, crush the shadows.\n\n66\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.340\nAnd yeah, I like that,\nthat looks pretty good.\n\n67\n00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.010\n&gt;&gt; That's really cool.\n\n68\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.680\nAnd I know when we were talking about\nthis right before this episode,\n\n69\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.880\nwhere you're like,\nthe different channels with the TV and\n\n70\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.320\nhow that's different than\nfilm as in photographs.\n\n71\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.940\nI was like yeah that truly makes sense and\n\n72\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.680\nwe can drag on those sliders that\nI was just kind of like a little\n\n73\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.380\nmind blown in there because of where I\ncome from not knowing about like TV films.\n\n74\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.180\n&gt;&gt; Now since this was a color problem, I'm\ngoing to look here at this vectorscope and\n\n75\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.460\nthere's a sharp spike\nIn the orange-red area.\n\n76\n00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.600\nBut then, that's one of those things we\nhave to think of it critically and go,\n\n77\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.945\nI have my two big ol meat\nstoppers here in my hands.\n\n78\n00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:06.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n79\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.440\nI've got this red cutting\nboard which is a bad choice.\n\n80\n00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.050\nRed is always a bad choice because\nit's hard to correct red and\n\n81\n00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.790\nit takes over everything because it's so\nsaturated It's like using yellow.\n\n82\n00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.790\nIt's everywhere.\n\n83\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.640\nSo I may not care so\nmuch about that spike.\n\n84\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.240\nBut then again I might say,\nthat's sort of toward the highlights.\n\n85\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.550\nAnd I may take the wheel here.\n\n86\n00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.100\nOkay?\n\n87\n00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.720\nScooch this over.\n\n88\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.858\nAnd just say I'm gonna pull this away.\n\n89\n00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:39.133\n&gt;&gt; Away from the orange?\n\n90\n00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.646\n&gt;&gt; Away from the orange just a schosh.\n\n91\n00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:45.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then adjust it just slightly, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.060\nThat can make it a big one.\n\n93\n00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.100\nAnd notice what it's doing.\n\n94\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.100\nOkay, it's moving the whole thing.\n\n95\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.590\nBased on the highlights.\n\n96\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.460\nIf I wanted to take care\nof just that spike,\n\n97\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.030\nthat's where it go back to the curves,\nmake the dots and just pull.\n\n98\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.090\nBut to me, it's fine because I\nwanted a lot of red in this shot.\n\n99\n00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.260\nNow here's a little trick,\n\n100\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.910\nif you want these to move faster hold down\nthe Cmd key, and then they go really fast.\n\n101\n00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, if I don't, they go much slower.\n\n102\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.790\nAnd then I'm just gonna\ndouble-click it and\n\n103\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.830\nreset it back to where it should be, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.350\nNow everything that we've been\ndoing affects the entire frame.\n\n105\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.830\nA secondary is designed to just\naffect a small portion of the frame.\n\n106\n00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.520\nOkay, it's like, let me go back\na little bit to these cabinets.\n\n107\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.610\nAnd it's like, I wish I could just\ncorrect this cabinet a little bit.\n\n108\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.670\n&gt;&gt; Are we going into almost\nlike mask areas and stuff?\n\n109\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.090\n&gt;&gt; Almost-\n&gt;&gt; Like that concept.\n\n110\n00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nBut it's gonna pull based on hue,\n\n111\n00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.760\nsaturation, and luma.\n\n112\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.840\nAll right, so it's almost like the magic\nwand where you're selecting just these\n\n113\n00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840\npieces and adjusting it.\n\n114\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.270\nSo it's a combination.\n\n115\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.370\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar.\n\n116\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.570\nSo I'm gonna take this eye dropper and\nhighlight the cabinet.\n\n117\n00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.846\nAnd it's told me, okay,\nbased on this [INAUDIBLE].\n\n118\n00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:13.370\nI'm gonna do this color gray, and\nit's like, wow, it's pulled a lot.\n\n119\n00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.940\nAlright, once I start doing this hue\nI'm going to readjust it over here and\n\n120\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.820\nsay, ok it's pulling more on the hand,\nwhat happens if I take out that?\n\n121\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.720\nHm no, this is a really hard pull\nbecause that yellow is everywhere.\n\n122\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.650\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; It is everywhere.\n\n123\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.500\nBut what I'm trying to do is isolate and\nso,\n\n124\n00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.060\nyou're going to the base of,\nI'm calling those pyramids,\n\n125\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.230\nlike, you're going to the base of\na pyramid and pulling the base out.\n\n126\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm pulling the base out and\nnotice when I get this top one,\n\n127\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.800\nit's extending the range and\nI can move to where the range fits.\n\n128\n00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.630\nAnd I can say, no, not there,\nnot there, no, that's wrong.\n\n129\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:54.640\nLet me do the luma, ok, pull that And\nif I pull this again, it extends, okay.\n\n130\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.350\nSo what it's done is it's saying\nyou've got the red mat really well,\n\n131\n00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.330\ngetting that yellow is not gonna be easy.\n\n132\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.520\nThat's where I may wanna just say that's\nwhere I'd have to do a mask of some type.\n\n133\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.786\nOr in this case,\nI should have just white balanced it.\n\n134\n00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.320\nSo what this color gray is telling me\n\n135\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.400\nis when you do the secondary this\nis the area you're going to affect.\n\n136\n00:07:18.445 --> 00:07:21.700\nYour gonna affect this part of\nthe hand and that, it's like okay,\n\n137\n00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.900\nand then you get a refine and\nnotice you get a color wheel and\n\n138\n00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.670\nwhat I can do is a single color wheel,\nlike a fast color correcter.\n\n139\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.910\nAnd everybody's going,\nwhere's my fast color correcter.\n\n140\n00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.210\nGive it time, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.310\nAnd if I just do it this way, I can say,\nall right just pull down the red,\n\n142\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.220\nand look at that.\n\n143\n00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.860\nI can get a deeper shadow on the red or\nI can blow it out.\n\n144\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.590\nI can blow it out to the point\nwhere it almost goes pink.\n\n145\n00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.769\nI could technically give\nit a little more blue.\n\n146\n00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.380\nOkay, throw a little blue in\nthere make it a little purple or\n\n147\n00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.280\njust change it completely to purple.\n\n148\n00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.920\nThis is what a secondary does or\nI've also got the ability to change\n\n149\n00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.950\nthe color temperature a little bit but\nit's only on that area\n\n150\n00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.840\nof my hand and that-\n&gt;&gt; You're isolating those pixels, or\n\n151\n00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.990\nthose colors for lack of a better term.\n\n152\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:17.370\n&gt;&gt; The last one is, and again I could\ndo it three way if I wanted to.\n\n153\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.970\nSo I could get that precise.\n\n154\n00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.790\n&gt;&gt; You can really get down into here.\n\n155\n00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.130\n&gt;&gt; You can really get down into there and\nthat's usually what happens is let's say\n\n156\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.500\nsomebody is wearing a t-shirt and it's red\n&gt;&gt; And it's really blasting.\n\n157\n00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.540\nIf I just do general color correction,\nthat's affecting the entire frame.\n\n158\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.280\nI would come in here to the secondary,\ngrab just the t-shirt.\n\n159\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.500\nAnd you notice I have a minus and\na plus, so\n\n160\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.000\nif I had to grab more I could go plus,\nadd this, add that.\n\n161\n00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.910\nThis part of the t-shirt's a little dark,\nthis is lighter.\n\n162\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I could add that and\n\n163\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.210\nthen just adjust the t-shirt down.\n\n164\n00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:55.800\nOr there's a banner that's really, really\nbright and it's distracting to the eye.\n\n165\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.190\nBut my overall shot looks fine.\n\n166\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.184\nI can use the secondary for that.\n\n167\n00:09:01.184 --> 00:09:02.500\nOkay, vignette.\n\n168\n00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.310\nYou're like, what?\n\n169\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.410\nThis is a very simple vignette.\n\n170\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.990\nI'm going to show you how to do\nmore advanced vignettes later, but\n\n171\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.890\nif I do this amount.\n\n172\n00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay you know what that is.\n\n173\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.270\nGive it a little,\ngive it a little sparkle there.\n\n174\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.660\nFocus in on, yeah it's a great shot but\nwhat if I focus on this thing and\n\n175\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.670\ntake out the edges.\n\n176\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:28.253\nAdjust the roundness a little bit and\nit's like now I'm really\n\n177\n00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:33.960\nfocused just on that center okay,\nmid-point that see, boom.\n\n178\n00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.220\nThis is a great shot, but\nmaybe I wanna focus more on that.\n\n179\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.160\nHave the roundness, take out the amount so\nmuch, and you get a simple vignette.\n\n180\n00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.860\nAnd yes, this is technically a lot\nof people who do color correction do\n\n181\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.257\nvignettes, so that's why they've added it.\n\n182\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.440\nOkay, so you may be saying to yourself,\nnow that's great.\n\n183\n00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.720\nI'm getting the gist of scopes.\n\n184\n00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.750\nYou're saying, but\nwhere is my other stuff, okay?\n\n185\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.360\nI did all this other stuff that I loved.\n\n186\n00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.550\nWell, first of all,\nI'm gonna go to effects controls, and\n\n187\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.550\nI'm gonna go to effects, and\nI'm gonna show you something.\n\n188\n00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.460\nYou might say great,\nwhat if I have to add a second secondary?\n\n189\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.470\nOr what if I wanna add\nanother Lumitry color.\n\n190\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.344\nBelieve it or not.\n\n191\n00:10:16.004 --> 00:10:18.273\n&gt;&gt; Are these effects that you can\nput on them and like [CROSSTALK]\n\n192\n00:10:18.273 --> 00:10:19.952\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there are-\n\n193\n00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:20.912\n&gt;&gt; Secondary secondary?\n\n194\n00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are pre-made effects\nthat you can drag on, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.850\n&gt;&gt; And these have all of the parameters\nand all of the everything?\n\n196\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.440\n&gt;&gt; They have all the parameters.\n\n197\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.710\nNotice just in color correction,\nthere's lumitry color.\n\n198\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.050\nSo I jus drag another on and\n\n199\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.520\ndo that same stack\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n200\n00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.380\n&gt;.\nAnd\n\n201\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.130\nthen the thing is keeping them separate\nyou got to make sure you're on the right\n\n202\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.560\none that's why if you do two,\ndo it from here.\n\n203\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.080\nSo you'll know whether it\nhappened in the stack.\n\n204\n00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.600\n&gt;&gt; Because then you're color\ncorrecting the color collection.\n\n205\n00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n206\n00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.250\nBut it's like all I want\nis another secondary.\n\n207\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.200\nYou could put another lumetry on there\nturn off everything but the secondary and\n\n208\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.190\ndo another secondary.\n\n209\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.540\nI see, cuz it's all in one.\n\n210\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.450\n&gt;&gt; It's all in one.\n\n211\n00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.645\n&gt;&gt; Group and so\nyou have to isolate what you want.\n\n212\n00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:01.880\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm you can make this big too.\n\n213\n00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.968\nLike if I come to some of these\nthey give you the idea of if you\n\n214\n00:11:06.968 --> 00:11:12.570\nuse a luma tree it gives you what\nwe call a colored shack okay?\n\n215\n00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.510\nAnd I'm sure you've talked\nabout these in Photoshop.\n\n216\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.800\nIt's like if you put this look on this\nis the relationship of the colors and\n\n217\n00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.920\nthis is the gradient.\n\n218\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.720\nSo notice,\nsome of them will have a deep shadow,\n\n219\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.060\nsome of them a very light shadow, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.350\nAnd it gives you an idea of what\nthat's gonna look like, okay?\n\n221\n00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.580\n&gt;&gt; It's like what look you're going for.\n\n222\n00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, when we do a color check,\nthis one,\n\n223\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.100\nthis blue intense,\nis very different than what we looked at.\n\n224\n00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.638\nIt's also this Day4Nite.\n\n225\n00:11:41.638 --> 00:11:44.810\nNotice there's some blue bleeding into.\n\n226\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.010\nThe shadows and the mid-tones.\n\n227\n00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.617\nSo these are pre-made.\n\n228\n00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:52.300\nThese are pre-made, and\nyou can do that, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.610\nAnd notice it's like some of them are\nspecific to certain cameras, like the red,\n\n230\n00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.730\nand all that.\n\n231\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.450\nNow some people are like,\n\n232\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:04.880\nwhat happened to the other stuff that\nI was familiar with the fast stuff.\n\n233\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.770\n&gt;&gt; The fast stuff.\n\n234\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.640\nIf you go into video effects,\nthere's a thing called obsolete.\n\n235\n00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:17.440\nIf you're used to using things\nlike the fast blur, the autocolor,\n\n236\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.360\nshadow and highlight,\nthis is where they are.\n\n237\n00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.240\nAnd you're saying,\nwhy are they in obsolete?\n\n238\n00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.700\nWell, Adobe might be moving away\nfrom it to use the Lumatree.\n\n239\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.170\nI'm not exactly sure.\n\n240\n00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.646\nBut they've left them in for\npeople that still use them,\n\n241\n00:12:31.646 --> 00:12:37.060\nstill have projects that\nutilize these things.\n\n242\n00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.141\nAnd I'm sure there are a lot of people\nthat have really learned how to\n\n243\n00:12:40.141 --> 00:12:43.455\ndo amazing things within those\ncontrols because that's all they have.\n\n244\n00:12:43.455 --> 00:12:45.730\n&gt;&gt; Right and they are not going\nto take that away from people.\n\n245\n00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.900\nSo the last thing that I'm going to do is\nI'm going to go ahead and take a look.\n\n246\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.650\nNow here's how I generally do it,\nand how a lot of people do it.\n\n247\n00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.180\nFirst of all, I only have one video track.\n\n248\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.550\nIf I control click, just right in this\n\n249\n00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:04.180\narea beyond the toggle track output,\ncontrol click, add a track.\n\n250\n00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.400\nI got a new track.\n\n251\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.318\nAnd you know what I'm gonna do.\n\n252\n00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:11.350\nFile &gt; New, where are you, where is it?\n\n253\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.240\nSee?\n\n254\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.050\nIt's not letting me do adjustment layer.\n\n255\n00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.740\nHere's why it's not letting\nme do adjustment layer.\n\n256\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.800\nYou know why?\n\n257\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.710\n&gt;&gt; Only on the audio?\n\n258\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.280\n&gt;&gt; Has to go in the project.\n\n259\n00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.173\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's something that you can\nretrieve again, and again and again.\n\n260\n00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:28.233\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n261\n00:13:28.233 --> 00:13:29.130\n&gt;&gt; This is the thing.\n\n262\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.300\nYou're not used to this in Photoshop,\nokay?\n\n263\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.250\nYou just add adjustment layer,\nboom there it is.\n\n264\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.820\nIf I make an adjustment layer in Premiere,\nit has to go and\n\n265\n00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.450\nget cataloged in the project area.\n\n266\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.010\nSo I'm just gonna take it.\n\n267\n00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.520\nI'm gonna drag it on top.\n\n268\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:53.123\nOkay, and then utilizing v2 on v1 off.\n\n269\n00:13:53.123 --> 00:13:56.670\nWhen I go back to color, okay?\n\n270\n00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.910\nAnd I move forward and\nI click this, now it's going to do\n\n271\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:06.080\nthe lumetry color onto the adjustment\nlayer, and I'm gonna turn off everything.\n\n272\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.110\nThis is just me,\nyou don't have to do this,\n\n273\n00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.870\nI'm gonna turn off everything but\ncreative, okay?\n\n274\n00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.180\nNo, I'm not, why not,\n\n275\n00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.980\nbecause the one thing we talk about\nis the elusive S curve, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.200\nAnd notice the adjustment layers over\neverything because it's going to effect\n\n277\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.420\neverything underneath it.\n\n278\n00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.580\nIf you're not familiar\nwith an adjustment layer,\n\n279\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.520\nit affects everything underneath it.\n\n280\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.560\nSo I'll do the illusive S-Curve, and\nI'm sure you can read about this on blogs,\n\n281\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.860\nwhere people are like, well when they\ndid film, this is what they did,\n\n282\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.000\nthey made an S-Curve and\nit looked all film.\n\n283\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.430\nWell, yeah we had a thing called\nthe contrast curve and that's, you know,\n\n284\n00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.900\nthis is kind of what it did,\nand it was great.\n\n285\n00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.300\nAnkle.\n\n286\n00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.180\nSo a lot of people add this to their\nfootage now I've made, you know,\n\n287\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.060\nthe Bangles and\nI'll walk you out like an Egyptian.\n\n288\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.110\nBut there we are, and\nit affects both shots, okay.\n\n289\n00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.110\nIt's not too bad.\n\n290\n00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.180\nAnd this is a look.\n\n291\n00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.530\nI'm creating a look.\n\n292\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.200\nLike, a lot of people like to talk about,\nyou know, Black Hawk Down.\n\n293\n00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.600\nWhere had that look and\nthat's what they did.\n\n294\n00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.170\nWhat they do is they corrected all\nthe shots first made sure they were as\n\n295\n00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.160\neven as possible because you can't,\nit's not going to be perfect.\n\n296\n00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.310\nThey matched them all up.\n\n297\n00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.640\n&gt;&gt; You match them all up because the human\neye doesn't work and the human brain.\n\n298\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.140\nGoing so\nfast that you can tell every single shot.\n\n299\n00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.020\nIf you're doing that you're spending\nway too much time doing that.\n\n300\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.070\nAnd then they added a look.\n\n301\n00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:24.440\nNow the other thing you can do is we have\nsomething called a lot for a camera.\n\n302\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.940\nBut Adobe has a lot of creative\nluts that can go on later.\n\n303\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.770\nI can say what look do I want.\n\n304\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:36.420\nI can say and\nnotice this is a lot of the stuff like.\n\n305\n00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.320\nNot monochrome, cuz it'll go black.\n\n306\n00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.250\nLet's say blue cold.\n\n307\n00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.640\nOkay, blue cold, and\nthat affects everything.\n\n308\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.335\nAnd it's blue cold, so\nnow it's the zombie watermelon.\n\n309\n00:15:48.335 --> 00:15:52.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I can adjust how it looks here.\n\n310\n00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.750\nI can say not so much faded film.\n\n311\n00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.850\nLet's sharpen it up a little,\na little less vibrance.\n\n312\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.460\nA little more vibrance.\n\n313\n00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.960\nTake the saturation down.\n\n314\n00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.340\nAnd I'll have a look to the whole thing.\n\n315\n00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.180\nAnd again, I get shadow tint,\nhighlight tint, and tint balance.\n\n316\n00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.230\n&gt;&gt; And this totally reminds me of like,\nback to the simple stuff of the Instagram\n\n317\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.830\nfilters and you have the little, you put\nthis one on they have all the names.\n\n318\n00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.490\nAnd then you go ahead and you can pull\nyour little adjustments and everything.\n\n319\n00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:25.170\nCuz you want that photograph to\nhave a look that's artsy and fancy.\n\n320\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nagain it ends up as a Lumetri color\n\n321\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.190\nhere on the adjustment layer.\n\n322\n00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.020\nAnd what can I do?\n\n323\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.510\nI can Ctrl click it and make a preset.\n\n324\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.420\nI can make a preset.\n\n325\n00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.430\nAnd I can claim it later.\n\n326\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.080\nOkay, and there you go.\n\n327\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.080\nSo that's the way Adobe is\ndoing color correction now.\n\n328\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.240\nThese are just the tools that you can use.\n\n329\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.970\nThey're a lot of fun.\n\n330\n00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.570\nAgain, this is a lot of practice, and\na lot of understanding what works,\n\n331\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.530\nwhat doesn't, what's pleasing to the eye,\nwhat is not pleasing to the eye.\n\n332\n00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.900\nAnd it takes a lot of study,\nbut just use simple stuff.\n\n333\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.480\nFollow the stack down and\nthen start with shooting it right.\n\n334\n00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.280\nWhite balance properly.\n\n335\n00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.000\nLook at where the light is falling.\n\n336\n00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.190\nA lighting person teach me years ago,\nwhere does the light fall?\n\n337\n00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.545\nAnd that's one of the reasons I'm going\nto show you the vignettes later that\n\n338\n00:17:15.545 --> 00:17:18.060\nare homemade in the nesting lesson.\n\n339\n00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.460\nWow, yeah, and I mean that's for\neverybody kinda has their own look.\n\n340\n00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.885\nAnd you get your experience, and like the\nway you color correct might be different\n\n341\n00:17:25.885 --> 00:17:29.505\nfrom the way somebody else color corrects,\nin a sense of like it's maybe not correct,\n\n342\n00:17:29.505 --> 00:17:31.809\nwe'll go and more for\nthe look what we've been doing-\n\n343\n00:17:31.809 --> 00:17:33.552\n&gt;&gt; It's none uncommon,\n\n344\n00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:39.149\nyou will get the same almost 90%\nclose On two different corrections,\n\n345\n00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:44.870\ntwo different looks and\npeople did it completely differently.\n\n346\n00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.870\nThey started differently and\nused different techniques, but\n\n347\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.230\nthey got their technique down.\n\n348\n00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.680\nAnd so if you really wanna get into\ncolor correction, study, study, study.\n\n349\n00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.750\nDo it, do it, do it.\n\n350\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.771\nIf you're just, I'm making video, I like\nit, I just need to go quick, there you go.\n\n351\n00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:02.600\nYou know it depends on how\nmuch you want to know.\n\n352\n00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's that whole theory of\nlike we both get to the same point.\n\n353\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.090\nBut I use curves and whatever and\nthis person uses this.\n\n354\n00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.210\n&gt;&gt; I know people that have been like I've\nnever used hue saturation luma wheels.\n\n355\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.920\nI never use curves,\nI never use this, that's fine.\n\n356\n00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.600\nI mean whatever works for you.\n\n357\n00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.160\nAgain, this is just how\nPremiere Pro does color correction.\n\n358\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nas long as you know how the tools work,\n\n359\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.020\nthen you can go and be as creative and\nfun as you want to.\n\n360\n00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.080\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n361\n00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.580\n&gt;&gt; Be a pro yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Be a pro.\n\n362\n00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.080\n&gt;&gt; Be a pro.\n\n363\n00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.700\n&gt;&gt; Be a premier pro yay.\n\n364\n00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.365\n[LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:18:34.365 --> 00:18:35.982\n&gt;&gt; Pros are everywhere they're everywhere.\n\n366\n00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:37.832\n&gt;&gt; Awesome well I think that's going to\n\n367\n00:18:37.832 --> 00:18:41.650\ngo ahead and wrap up our color\ncorrection for Creative Pro TV.\n\n368\n00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.000\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off this episode, but\n\n369\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.410\nstick around there'll be a lot more.\n\n370\n00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.796\nSo well, signing off, for Creative Pro TV.\n\n371\n00:18:48.796 --> 00:18:50.690\n[LAUGH] I've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n372\n00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.190\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know that a lot of times when people\n\n12\n00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:36.414\nget in Premiere Pro, they love everything,\n\n13\n00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:39.828\nthey do effects, and\nthey get to sound, and their like.\n\n14\n00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:46.652\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I get it, trust me.\n\n15\n00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:49.612\nBeing an editor, I did sound for a long\ntime, and I still, in the editing process,\n\n16\n00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:50.900\nwhen I get to the sound, I'm like.\n\n17\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.958\nSo I'm gonna go over some essential sound\nthings that you're gonna wanna know,\n\n18\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:01.339\nand I've done a little\nexperiment that I call The Mess.\n\n19\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.197\nYeah, you're gonna see The Mess and\n\n20\n00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:07.702\nyou'll find out that The Mess is\nactually quite helpful, all right?\n\n21\n00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:11.000\nSo coming down to the screen here,\nI've got just about everything.\n\n22\n00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.762\nI do not have the mess.\n\n23\n00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.754\nSo once again,\nreviewing our media browser,\n\n24\n00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:20.291\nwe're gonna go to the media browser and\nfind The Mess which is in here.\n\n25\n00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:21.675\nThere it is, The Mess.\n\n26\n00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:26.657\nNow, it's got two folders, and\nagain, this is one of those\n\n27\n00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:31.856\nthings where I can take the folder\nitself and go import, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:36.080\nBoom.\nNow, it gives me this weird error.\n\n29\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.940\nAnd don't worry about that.\n\n30\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.201\nIt will just say format not supported.\n\n31\n00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.352\nThat doesn't matter.\n\n32\n00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.380\nNow, I also did this.\n\n33\n00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.961\nI didn't check here and\nguess what happened?\n\n34\n00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:51.260\nI'm making some proxies.\n\n35\n00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.797\nCuz I have ingest on and\nI didn't check it.\n\n36\n00:01:53.797 --> 00:01:55.788\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I was like yeah,\nmini encoders back there.\n\n37\n00:01:55.788 --> 00:01:56.352\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n38\n00:01:56.352 --> 00:01:57.717\nsomething happened in the background.\n\n39\n00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:01.729\n&gt;&gt; I did this on purpose cuz it's like,\nlook, always check.\n\n40\n00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.559\nAlways check and I didn't check.\n\n41\n00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:08.124\nThat's why one of the rules is whenever\nyou do anything, top to bottom,\n\n42\n00:02:08.124 --> 00:02:09.651\nleft to right, front to back.\n\n43\n00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:12.120\nGo top to bottom, check that.\n\n44\n00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.098\nCheck left to right, and\nthen check front to back.\n\n45\n00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:16.641\nIt's fine I can still make some\nproxies in the background.\n\n46\n00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:21.478\nIt's no big deal, it's not gonna cause me\nany problems because the way this camera\n\n47\n00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:24.601\nshot it, I don't really need proxies,\nit's fine.\n\n48\n00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:28.740\nAnd what it was telling me is because\nI brought in some audio from zoom.\n\n49\n00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.281\nIt was saying,\nthese weren't supported for proxies.\n\n50\n00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:34.385\nAnd its like okay yeah, that's fine.\n\n51\n00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:38.020\nNow under the stream I've got two shots,\nI only need one.\n\n52\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.200\nIt's fine okay, it's great.\n\n53\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.805\nSo another thing, I'm gonna go\nup to Preferences &gt; Audio, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:56.244\nThis is something that people find very\n\n55\n00:02:56.244 --> 00:03:01.658\ntroubling called Default Audio Tracks,\nokay?\n\n56\n00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:07.210\nSo what it's saying is, under Mono Media,\nMono, Stereo, 5.1, Adaptive.\n\n57\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.421\nUsed file just means it's gonna read\nthe file and use the file that way.\n\n58\n00:03:14.421 --> 00:03:18.930\nIf it senses that it's Mono,\nStereo, 5.1 or multi-channel.\n\n59\n00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.608\nNow, I have multi-channel set\nto Adaptive for a reason,\n\n60\n00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:25.469\nthat I'm gonna use later with 360 video.\n\n61\n00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.820\nFor right now,\nI've done Use File on all of these.\n\n62\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.011\nAnd that's generally what people do.\n\n63\n00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:33.974\n&gt;&gt; Because you wanna have it to\nwhere how it was captured and\n\n64\n00:03:33.974 --> 00:03:37.264\nnot changing it once it comes in,\nis that what I'm thinking?\n\n65\n00:03:37.264 --> 00:03:41.915\n&gt;&gt; It's a left side,\nright side issue In that if I\n\n66\n00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:46.928\nbringing a two channel\nsomething under Use File,\n\n67\n00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:50.406\nthat's gonna end up in one track.\n\n68\n00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:53.163\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it said we can,\n&gt;&gt; Remember tracks on the right side,\n\n69\n00:03:53.163 --> 00:03:54.770\nchannels on the left.\n\n70\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.513\nSome people don't like that.\n\n71\n00:03:56.513 --> 00:04:00.980\nI'm gonna show you how to do this in\nAdobe though, with the Use File, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.942\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I've got streams,\nI've got my zoom.\n\n73\n00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:07.030\nSo what I did for this, and\nI'm gonna show you The Mess real quick.\n\n74\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.462\nLet me go ahead and give it a double-click\non the NTS here, it is a mess.\n\n75\n00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:18.737\nAnd what I decided to do\nwas set up five cameras and\n\n76\n00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:22.862\njust microphones everywhere, why?\n\n77\n00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.768\nBecause usually people, when they\nthink to go advanced, I need more.\n\n78\n00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:29.458\nI need more cameras, I need more\nmicrophones, I need more lights.\n\n79\n00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:32.480\nAnd then you realize you need\nmore people to help you,\n\n80\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.010\nyou need more to check more\nof these things you've got.\n\n81\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.705\nSomething that takes,\nthis could be a five minute shoot,\n\n82\n00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:41.351\nthat could be a five hour set up and\na five hour break down.\n\n83\n00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:45.610\nSo that's why I set up a bunch of\nstuff and that's why this is The Mess.\n\n84\n00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.777\n&gt;&gt; Second camera speed.\n\n85\n00:04:46.777 --> 00:04:49.741\nAnd I did three camera but\nI'm not gonna give you all three camera.\n\n86\n00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:54.632\n&gt;&gt; And what I'm doing is I'm sitting\nhere and this is the camera audio.\n\n87\n00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:57.433\nThe difference between all\nthree of those microphones,\n\n88\n00:04:57.433 --> 00:05:00.418\nhow they can come into system,\nhow you can manipulate them.\n\n89\n00:05:00.418 --> 00:05:04.372\n&gt;&gt; Okay so that's off the camera and\nmost people would say that's awesome,\n\n90\n00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:05.729\nthat's awesome audio.\n\n91\n00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.921\nWhat I'm saying is I'm definitely\nnot close enough to the source.\n\n92\n00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:12.788\nI can hear a lot of the room\nin there like indirect sound,\n\n93\n00:05:12.788 --> 00:05:15.838\nit's bouncing off the room,\nI'll say that's terrible.\n\n94\n00:05:15.838 --> 00:05:19.670\nAnd if that camera wasn't\npointing at my face.\n\n95\n00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.952\nIf it turned, I'm gonna go off microphone,\ncuz that camera's pointing there.\n\n96\n00:05:23.952 --> 00:05:29.134\nSo I've given you an example\nwhere you have multiple sources,\n\n97\n00:05:29.134 --> 00:05:31.099\nas we would say, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.560\nNow, I'm gonna show you something\nthat's essential, because you will\n\n99\n00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.832\nprobably working where you get what we\ncall Secondary audio, or Sync audio, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:46.931\nAnd I have from the zoom, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:50.807\nThat was the six that I showed you,\nthat I held up.\n\n102\n00:05:50.807 --> 00:05:56.108\nI recorded to a middle side\nmicrophone which is somewhat spacial,\n\n103\n00:05:56.108 --> 00:05:58.389\nlike you can hear me moving.\n\n104\n00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.720\nI also did a boom and I did a lava layer,\nso you can hear all of them.\n\n105\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.278\nNow, what you're gonna say is this.\n\n106\n00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:07.117\nHow do I put all that on this video?\n\n107\n00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:12.398\nHow do I do\n\n108\n00:06:12.398 --> 00:06:16.362\nthat?\n\n109\n00:06:16.362 --> 00:06:18.893\nAnd what most people do is they\nput it in the timeline and\n\n110\n00:06:18.893 --> 00:06:21.269\nthey sort of drag it around and\nlook for waveforms.\n\n111\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.760\nThere's multiple ways to do this.\n\n112\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.539\nOne of the ways is this.\n\n113\n00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.809\nI'm just gonna Cmd+Click\nall of these audios, and\n\n114\n00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:34.798\nmake sure this file, I know it's 001,\nthat's the one I did, pretty sure.\n\n115\n00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:40.417\nCtrl+Click and\nyou have something called Merge clips.\n\n116\n00:06:40.417 --> 00:06:45.711\nI'll click it and\nthere are five ways that you can do this.\n\n117\n00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:49.176\nI could put In Points\nwhere there is a sound\n\n118\n00:06:49.176 --> 00:06:53.640\nthat you can here on all of\nthem to sync them up, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.525\nUsually that's what the clap slate's for\nand I use a digital clap slate in this and\n\n120\n00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:00.619\nit's like bam and\nwe sync them all on the bam.\n\n121\n00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:04.570\nWe can do this as an Out Point,\nwe could do it to Timecode.\n\n122\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.501\nThat's oftentimes when you see cameras\non these big machines, that's generating\n\n123\n00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:12.449\ntimecode to everything, so everybody has\nthe same time code, bam, it's locked.\n\n124\n00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:16.260\nA Clip Marker, an audio markers, or Audio.\n\n125\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.957\nThis is a system by which it\nwinds up the audio wave forms\n\n126\n00:07:20.957 --> 00:07:24.690\nfrom all the sources and syncs it, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.499\nSyncs the whole thing up.\n\n128\n00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:31.317\nNow the interesting part about\nthat is you better make sure\n\n129\n00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:35.459\nall your sources can be heard,\nare clear, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:39.531\nIf you've got one thing that's like\nreally fuzzy, that one's not gonna sync.\n\n131\n00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:41.471\nBut in many cases, this works really well.\n\n132\n00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:45.429\nI'm not gonna remove the audio from\nthe clip, I want you to hear that.\n\n133\n00:07:45.429 --> 00:07:48.799\nOkay, I want you to hear the camera\naudio in relation to everything else.\n\n134\n00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:50.800\nI'm gonna hope this is the right one,\nboom.\n\n135\n00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.210\nIt's gonna process it.\n\n136\n00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.310\nHopefully I put the right\nshot on the right audio.\n\n137\n00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.505\nIf I didn't, that's my own fault for\nnot labeling it.\n\n138\n00:07:58.505 --> 00:08:00.309\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which I should've done.\n\n139\n00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:02.066\n&gt;&gt; I know the work of file labeling.\n\n140\n00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:05.382\n&gt;&gt; This is taking a long time, so\nI'm thinking maybe this is the wrong one.\n\n141\n00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:07.894\nUsually this goes a lot, Faster.\n\n142\n00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:08.813\nOkay.\n\n143\n00:08:08.813 --> 00:08:09.591\nBoom.\n\n144\n00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:11.580\nProcessing two, processing six.\n\n145\n00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.150\nAll right, so I should have a brand\nnew thing up here called merged.\n\n146\n00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.552\n&gt;&gt; And the times are the same because the\nother one was ten and the other one's 16.\n\n147\n00:08:19.552 --> 00:08:23.430\n&gt;&gt; Times are pretty close.\nI management to fire off pretty equally.\n\n148\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.400\nOkay, I'm gonna hide\nthis in the background.\n\n149\n00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.750\nOkay, proxies, I'm gonna hide you.\n\n150\n00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.669\nNow as a real easy thing,\nI'm just gonna go.\n\n151\n00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.582\nNew sequence from clip, boom.\n\n152\n00:08:32.582 --> 00:08:37.251\nAnd you will see that I have,\nLet me just make this.\n\n153\n00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:42.790\nAnd you're gonna see that I\nhave all of these combined.\n\n154\n00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:43.530\nThey are synched.\n\n155\n00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.560\n&gt;&gt; Second camera speed.\n\n156\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.610\n&gt;&gt; And since I'm not hearing them\nIn a weird, echo-y kind of thing.\n\n157\n00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.120\nThey're all good.\n\n158\n00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.990\n&gt;&gt; If they hadn't matched\nup you'd hear kinda.\n\n159\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.790\n&gt;&gt; If they hadn't matched up,\n\n160\n00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.180\nyou'd hear repeating, you know repeating,\necho-y kind of thing.\n\n161\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.120\nSo now.\n\n162\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.090\n&gt;&gt; We also have this microphone.\n\n163\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.860\nThis is a 360.\n\n164\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, I didn't put the 360 degree\nmicrophone in here, cuz, that's, you know,\n\n165\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.470\nit's kinda weird.\n\n166\n00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.770\n&gt;&gt; So what I've done, you don't really\nneed to see the picture so much.\n\n167\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.300\nWhat I've done is I have all of these\naudio tracks in here, I have six.\n\n168\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.910\nSo the top two,\nare most likely the camera.\n\n169\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.150\nHow do I know that?\n\n170\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.050\nOn here, I have a thing called mute and\nI have a thing called solo.\n\n171\n00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.990\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna solo these two.\n\n172\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.375\nIt mutes everything else.\n\n173\n00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Microphone or an ambisonic microphone.\n\n174\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.510\n&gt;&gt; That's the camera.\n\n175\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.220\nI will now solo the next two.\n\n176\n00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.060\n&gt;&gt; Unlike surround, which is-\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n177\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.150\nsounds kind of the same\n&gt;&gt; You can hear the,\n\n178\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.950\nI feel like that one doesn't have as\nmuch of the room, if you wanna say.\n\n179\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.534\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't have as much of the room,\nbecause this is the H6N on the top of\n\n180\n00:09:56.534 --> 00:10:01.000\nthe camera pointing at me with\nthe middle side microphone, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.649\nNow, the thing is, when I move,\nI think I do it at some point, yeah,\n\n182\n00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:07.832\nI think I get up and I move round.\n\n183\n00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:11.760\n&gt;&gt; Do that in a multi camera situation or\n\n184\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.330\nyou can do it in a single\ncamera situation.\n\n185\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:16.870\nAnd you can see all this play out on\n\n186\n00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.517\nthe 360-\n&gt;&gt; Stop blathering,\n\n187\n00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:18.059\nI blather way too much.\n\n188\n00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:21.715\nHere we go, little faster,\nokay, now I get up.\n\n189\n00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:23.833\n&gt;&gt; I've been looking at them, but\n\n190\n00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:27.310\nif I'm doing sort of a DIY-\n&gt;&gt; On the middle side you can kind of hear\n\n191\n00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:31.470\nme moving a little bit from\nleft to right It's not as\n\n192\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.450\nprofound as a stereo in that case you\nwould hear me moving hard left hard right.\n\n193\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.865\nThe next one, I'm guessing this\nis probably gonna be the shotgun.\n\n194\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.520\n&gt;&gt; That's going into a recorder\nthat's on top of the-\n\n195\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.470\n&gt;&gt; So this is a very basic shot gun.\n\n196\n00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.720\nAnd notice how much more of me.\n\n197\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.160\n&gt;&gt; I can definitely hear the difference.\n\n198\n00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.130\n&gt;&gt; I want to bring this how I can show\nyou just how if you do get something like\n\n199\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.810\nthis, how you could use it in Adobe.\n\n200\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:05.410\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, that's the thing, you'll\nalso notice It has a proximity effect.\n\n201\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.550\nSo the closer I move it to the shotgun and\naway from the shotgun, you can hear that.\n\n202\n00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.910\nOftentimes when people operate\na shotgun mic they'll do that.\n\n203\n00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.580\nThey'll distance people, and do that.\n\n204\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.089\nThe last one should be the lav.\n\n205\n00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:23.479\n&gt;&gt; The importance of all this is what\ncan Adobe do with three cameras?\n\n206\n00:11:23.479 --> 00:11:26.120\nOkay cuz we've got, on our other camera,\nwe have our subject-\n\n207\n00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.510\n&gt;&gt; So it's basically all me.\n\n208\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.275\n&gt;&gt; And that's the one that's\nconnected to just for the,\n\n209\n00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:31.850\nthe lavalier is the ones here.\n\n210\n00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:35.417\n&gt;&gt; Right very direct sound\nvery straight into me and\n\n211\n00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:38.296\nit's like no room, no room presence.\n\n212\n00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:41.655\nAnd that's why I'm giving you all these\nfiles so you can hear the difference\n\n213\n00:11:41.655 --> 00:11:44.140\nbetween everything and\nwhich ones you might have used.\n\n214\n00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.310\nI'm one of these folks I\nuse lavalier a lot but\n\n215\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.200\nthere's the occasion if I can't use it if\nI'm doing a narrative piece because you\n\n216\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.870\ndon't want to see the lavaliers on people.\n\n217\n00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.630\nAnd I would want a really\ngood sound guy to hide that.\n\n218\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.350\nBut if it's just an interview\npeople use the lavaliers now.\n\n219\n00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.450\nBut I do that and I do a boom\nsafety on two separate channels.\n\n220\n00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.430\nSo that way if the lav goes\nout I have a boom safety and\n\n221\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.440\nthey're close enough that I could\ngo back and forth between the two.\n\n222\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.110\nAll right?\n\n223\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.610\nNow, again, I can solo them or I can just\nmute them, like if I mute all of them,\n\n224\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.640\nit's the same as soloing two tracks but\nmuting.\n\n225\n00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.680\nYou know.\n\n226\n00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n227\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.420\nIt's one way, half dozen of the other.\n\n228\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, So\nthat's exactly what I'm doing.\n\n229\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.510\nOption clicking means if I can do this.\n\n230\n00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.030\nIf I option click it's like\nwhich one do I want to do?\n\n231\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.530\nOption click all of them and\nthen just turn off that one.\n\n232\n00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.540\nAnd that's just a quick fix.\n\n233\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.050\nAn option click will turn them all off.\n\n234\n00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.950\nThat works the same with these,\nlike if I do option click.\n\n235\n00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou do that in Photoshop with layers.\n\n236\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:48.790\nIt's like the opposite, when you Option\nclick the eyeball, it hides everything but\n\n237\n00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.555\nthat layer.\n\n238\n00:12:49.555 --> 00:12:51.218\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's I'm doing,\nit's interesting,\n\n239\n00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:52.608\ncuz I'm doing shift clicks in this one.\n\n240\n00:12:52.608 --> 00:12:55.340\nI'm doing shift clicks on the tracks.\n\n241\n00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.590\nBut I'm doing, option clicks on the mutes.\n\n242\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.200\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; And the solos So\n\n243\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.210\nit's a little bit different.\n\n244\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.800\n&gt;&gt; It almost works like a shift but\nit's, yeah.\n\n245\n00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.760\n&gt;&gt; It works like a shift but\nit's an option.\n\n246\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.600\nOkay, so now what am I gonna do?\n\n247\n00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.550\nI could choose to keep all of these and\n\n248\n00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:17.220\nmute them, solo them,\nbring down their overall volume.\n\n249\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.900\nI think what I'm just gonna do\nis I'm just gonna keep the lav.\n\n250\n00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.740\nSo I'll do this, command click boom,\nisn't this interesting?\n\n251\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:30.090\nIf I do this, I get them individually, so\nI'm just gonna take them out individually.\n\n252\n00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.914\nOkay, boom and I could move that\nstraight up if I wanted to.\n\n253\n00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:37.393\n&gt;&gt; To A1.\n&gt;&gt; Yep just move it to A1.\n\n254\n00:13:37.393 --> 00:13:38.321\nLet's go.\n\n255\n00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:44.385\nAnd it's in sync,\n\n256\n00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:47.230\ngreat.\n\n257\n00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.110\nSo let me go ahead and\nadd the music, okay?\n\n258\n00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.940\nAnd I'm just gonna drag it in,\nI'm not gonna care too much about that.\n\n259\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:00.040\nAnd since I've done this again, it's\ngoing to have an insane amount of gain.\n\n260\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.531\n&gt;&gt; The gain on the left,\nvolume on the right.\n\n261\n00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:07.570\n[MUSIC]\n\n262\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.180\n&gt;&gt; And it's like I'll move it\ninto here to where I'm talking.\n\n263\n00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n264\n00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.030\nAnd that's killing me.\n\n265\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.480\nThat is absolutely killing\nme in terms of power.\n\n266\n00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's overpowering.\n\n267\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.270\n&gt;&gt; It's overpowering.\n\n268\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.012\nSo, what do we do?\nAgain,\n\n269\n00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:26.354\na lot of people go right\nstraight to the rubber bands, but\n\n270\n00:14:26.354 --> 00:14:30.128\nI could have done the gain here,\nI could have done the gain here.\n\n271\n00:14:30.128 --> 00:14:34.230\nWhat I want to also do is look\nat the amount of drawn levels.\n\n272\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.060\nMy levels are pretty good.\n\n273\n00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.950\nBut they're like, way over.\n\n274\n00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.800\nThe first thing I'll do is ctrl click.\n\n275\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.100\nI'm going to do the audio gain.\n\n276\n00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.010\nI'm going to take this down\nby -6 which is a little.\n\n277\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:58.320\nNow I'm going to do.\n\n278\n00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.690\nBasically what I'm affecting\nright now is amplitude.\n\n279\n00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.770\nWhat's really loud and what's really soft.\n\n280\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.700\nI'm gonna now effect some frequency.\n\n281\n00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.644\nAnd a lot of people get into this as like,\nso your gonna equalized.\n\n282\n00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:16.769\nIt's like, yeah please note what frequency\nI'm not like eliminating anything,\n\n283\n00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:18.560\nI'm equalizing.\n\n284\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:24.980\nI'm equalizing, so what I'm gonna\ndo is that's an effect, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.500\nIt's an effect.\n\n286\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.410\nNow, where do I want to put it?\n\n287\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:34.030\nDo I wanna put it on the track or\ndo I wanna put it on the clip?\n\n288\n00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.920\nIn many cases,\nI like putting it on the track,\n\n289\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.920\nbecause I may need to effect\neverything in the track.\n\n290\n00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.230\nSo the way we do that is\nwe go to the window and\n\n291\n00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.800\nI could go to the audio workspace but\nI'm not, it's not comfortable for me.\n\n292\n00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.480\nAnd I'll ask for the audio track mixer.\n\n293\n00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.441\nWhat that allows me to\ndo is I will say okay.\n\n294\n00:15:56.441 --> 00:16:03.313\nTrack one is me, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:03.313 --> 00:16:05.984\nAnd I will say filter in EQ.\n\n296\n00:16:05.984 --> 00:16:10.587\nJust gonna use a,\nLet's use the parametric,\n\n297\n00:16:10.587 --> 00:16:16.130\nlet's get fancy and\nI'll double click it, okay.\n\n298\n00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.275\nAnd what I'm going to do on these, I'm\ngonna boost the midrange just slightly.\n\n299\n00:16:20.275 --> 00:16:26.011\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] If you do\nweird things with video\n\n300\n00:16:26.011 --> 00:16:28.312\n&gt;&gt; And it's added a little bit of clarity.\n\n301\n00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:32.158\nOkay, it's added a little bit of clarity\nbecause we hear very well in the mid range\n\n302\n00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.678\nand this is very simple, okay.\n\n303\n00:16:33.678 --> 00:16:39.467\nNow, I'm gonna do the same thing\nin the other one, okay, the music.\n\n304\n00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:46.081\nAnd I'm gonna do the exact opposite,\nin that I'm gonna pull the mid range-\n\n305\n00:16:46.081 --> 00:16:46.974\n&gt;&gt; Pull it down.\n\n306\n00:16:46.974 --> 00:16:50.179\n&gt;&gt; Down a little bit or sometimes we\ncall this a form of frequency ducking.\n\n307\n00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.050\nCuz what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna fill in that\n\n308\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.340\nempty space with my voice from the music.\n\n309\n00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.160\n&gt;&gt; People might think it's art,\nif you screw up audio.\n\n310\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:05.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now I can manipulate\nthe volume in the track,\n\n311\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.770\nbut I'm gonna do it in a really crazy way,\nokay.\n\n312\n00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.480\nThis is gonna be really fun,\n\n313\n00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.900\npeople are gonna finally like\naudio when they see this.\n\n314\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.430\nAll right so I'm gonna go here,\nI'm gonna make it big.\n\n315\n00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.610\nLet me just go ahead and edit out using\nsome of the techniques that we talked\n\n316\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.122\nabout over the past couple of lessons,\nokay.\n\n317\n00:17:24.122 --> 00:17:27.510\nI'm gonna queue this,\nlet's see if I can queue.\n\n318\n00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.020\nCan I queue, is it gonna let me queue?\n\n319\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.340\nIt's not gonna let me queue\nbecause of the way it's situated.\n\n320\n00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.253\nLet me W, nope.\n\n321\n00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:35.983\n&gt;&gt; That's moving the tape deck, right?\n\n322\n00:17:35.983 --> 00:17:40.951\n&gt;&gt; Yes, do you know what,\ncuz it's all these, that's the left side,\n\n323\n00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:43.012\nlet's do the right side.\n\n324\n00:17:43.012 --> 00:17:47.460\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nI get a W, let me go over here.\n\n325\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.050\n&gt;&gt; And you just hit left to right,\ntop to bottom, forward to back?\n\n326\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.621\nCheck, check, checking in,\ncheck, check [LAUGH].\n\n327\n00:17:53.621 --> 00:17:59.240\nHere's an interesting thing,\nwhen I did that, this gave me a cut, okay.\n\n328\n00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.162\nIt's there doing it because of\nthe relationship between everything so\n\n329\n00:18:03.162 --> 00:18:05.970\nI do have another thing that I could do.\n\n330\n00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.684\nI could put an outpoint here,\n\n331\n00:18:09.684 --> 00:18:14.440\nput in inpoint there and then delete or\n\n332\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:20.318\nI could option delete and\nthat closes it up.\n\n333\n00:18:20.318 --> 00:18:21.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n334\n00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.464\n&gt;&gt; Lot of different techniques\nthat we can do with this,\n\n335\n00:18:23.464 --> 00:18:24.740\na lot of different techniques.\n\n336\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.300\nI have a nub, this is why you wanna\nzoom in, I've a nub, I missed a nub.\n\n337\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.090\nNow, here's something interesting\na lot of people don't know.\n\n338\n00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.740\nIf I click this, it's another technique,\nI'll Ctrl+click here and\n\n339\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.990\nsay ripple delete, so this stuff,\n\n340\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:44.090\nthis is actual stuff that you can work\nwith, people just think it's empty.\n\n341\n00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.720\nAll right, so, here we go, I'm like,\n\n342\n00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.000\nI'm gonna mix this and people say,\nwhat do you mean you're gonna mix it?\n\n343\n00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.193\nI was like, I'm gonna mix it.\n\n344\n00:18:55.193 --> 00:19:00.040\nSo it's on Audio 2, watch this,\nlet me take Audio 2,\n\n345\n00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.285\ncall that music, and\nI'll call this one voice.\n\n346\n00:19:10.312 --> 00:19:11.380\nWhat you have is down here.\n\n347\n00:19:14.151 --> 00:19:17.832\nWhen I look at this,\nI can be like, okay, voice,\n\n348\n00:19:17.832 --> 00:19:22.270\nmusic, so this is a way you can\nactually label your tracks.\n\n349\n00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:26.343\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be nice.\n&gt;&gt; We can do it as a Ctrl+click rename or\n\n350\n00:19:26.343 --> 00:19:31.389\nI just prefer to do it up in here,\nokay, music.\n\n351\n00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:38.130\nSo, I have a record button,\nthat's for voice-over.\n\n352\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.790\nI have this thing called read,\nwhat does read do?\n\n353\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.230\nIt's reading what's on the track,\nI'm gonna switch it to write,\n\n354\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:51.660\nI'm going to pull this all the way\ndown and now I'm going to hit play.\n\n355\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.420\n&gt;&gt; Problems and\nyou have to be a little delicate with it,\n\n356\n00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.520\na little bit more delicate\nthan you wanted to.\n\n357\n00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.850\nI've also set up an audio\nmenagerie because if anything,\n\n358\n00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.480\none of the things I tell people,\nespecially when they've just start getting\n\n359\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.790\ninto this is, if you do weird things\nwith video, people might think it's art.\n\n360\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.560\nIf you screw up audio, you're an idiot,\nso you don't wanna screw up your audios.\n\n361\n00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.110\nSo I have a boom mic, okay.\n\n362\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.410\n&gt;&gt; I just mixed that in real time.\n\n363\n00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:20.570\n&gt;&gt; That's really cool [LAUGH].\n\n364\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:21.880\n&gt;&gt; So that's what I did.\n\n365\n00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:28.570\nIf I go to my key frame view,\nokay, Show Audio Key Frames and\n\n366\n00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:33.040\nI say, come here,\nI gotta stretch this out to see it, okay.\n\n367\n00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.413\nI'm just doing it to the mouse now,\nyeah, the mouse roll will work too.\n\n368\n00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:43.580\nOkay, click Keyframes &gt; Track Keyframes &gt;\nVolume, there's all the keyframes I did.\n\n369\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.820\n&gt;&gt; So while you were doing the sliders for\n\n370\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.880\nthe volume of the music,\nit's making all of those key frames.\n\n371\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.100\n&gt;&gt; It's making key frames and\n\n372\n00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.660\nI know there are a lot of people\nthat really want to get into audio.\n\n373\n00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.020\nAnd there are some things like if you\nbuy some controllers, there's a zoom,\n\n374\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.261\nlittle zoom bone thing like that,\n\n375\n00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:08.210\nit will actually control these sliders and\nyou can get that sort of feel.\n\n376\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:12.850\nIf I screwed it up, again, I can erase\nall of the keyframes by just hitting\n\n377\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.850\nthe pen tool, lassoing them and hitting\ndelete or since I have keyframes in there,\n\n378\n00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:20.190\nI can just manipulate them now,\nlike I would manipulate the rubber bands.\n\n379\n00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:25.190\n&gt;&gt; As the keyframes but having that slider\nand being able to have that control,\n\n380\n00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.810\nthat's really neat and\nyou had to switch it to write.\n\n381\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.200\n&gt;&gt; Have to switch it to write,\nnow there are a couple more.\n\n382\n00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.270\nThere's touch and latch okay.\n\n383\n00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:38.020\nLatch means if I do that and\nI move it to this, it holds steady.\n\n384\n00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.820\nTouch is interesting in that, let's say I\nhave a certain level that I'm going and\n\n385\n00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:48.690\nyou know somebody coughs or\nsays something, you just touch it for\n\n386\n00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:55.520\nthe cough, let go of it and it goes back\nto it's level, okay, that's a touch.\n\n387\n00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.910\nFor instance it's like oops.\n\n388\n00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.350\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like a mute\nbutton where you're like, okay,\n\n389\n00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.140\nlet's stop here and\nthen go back up to where we were.\n\n390\n00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.112\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, now,\nif I highlight my audio and\n\n391\n00:22:07.112 --> 00:22:14.443\nI go to effects controls,\nyou don't see any effects on there.\n\n392\n00:22:14.443 --> 00:22:18.815\nBecause I've done it in the actual\ntrack and in the track,\n\n393\n00:22:18.815 --> 00:22:21.350\nI can turn things on and off okay.\n\n394\n00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:26.050\nI can say, no I don't want that,\nI can do some individual things.\n\n395\n00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.890\nLet's say I'll go back\nto the effects controls,\n\n396\n00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:33.940\nlet's say I do come down to effects,\nokay and yes there are audio effects.\n\n397\n00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:40.830\nThere's a lot in obsolete right now but\nthere's like coarse,\n\n398\n00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.870\nall these things, adaptive noise\nreduction, many, many different things.\n\n399\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.030\nThere's so many different filters,\nmy suggestion,\n\n400\n00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.638\nthere's a lot of white\npapers on all these and\n\n401\n00:22:50.638 --> 00:22:54.981\nwhat they do and why you wanna use them,\nthere's a lot of effects in audio.\n\n402\n00:22:54.981 --> 00:22:58.528\n&gt;&gt; And cuz this is almost like color\ncorrection of like, you can go so\n\n403\n00:22:58.528 --> 00:23:02.350\nfar down the rabbit hole and\nthere's a whole departments in certain-\n\n404\n00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n405\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.995\n&gt;&gt; That's all they do is the sound and\nthe sound effects.\n\n406\n00:23:06.995 --> 00:23:09.694\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nI've had to do so much audio correction,\n\n407\n00:23:09.694 --> 00:23:14.179\nI will get in there with people and say,\nyeah you need to lower that by 60 b and\n\n408\n00:23:14.179 --> 00:23:17.077\nyou also need to compress\nit off a negative 20 and\n\n409\n00:23:17.077 --> 00:23:19.454\ngive it a frequency bump at 2,000.\n\n410\n00:23:19.454 --> 00:23:21.000\nAnd they'll just be like what?\n\n411\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly [LAUGH].\n\n412\n00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.646\n&gt;&gt; And I'll go look at color creations and\nit's like blue.\n\n413\n00:23:24.646 --> 00:23:26.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know and that's the thing.\n\n414\n00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you work with it so much, but\n\n415\n00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.610\nthis is also one of those things,\na light touch works very well.\n\n416\n00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:41.350\nSo let's say I've got a bunch of clips\nin here, a bunch of audio clips,\n\n417\n00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:46.630\nbut what I wanna do is just add\na little quote unquote compression.\n\n418\n00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.995\nOkay, I might be able to do this and\njust type in the word compressor.\n\n419\n00:23:50.995 --> 00:23:57.857\n[SOUND] Okay, so there's something\ncalled compound arithmetic, okay, yeah.\n\n420\n00:23:57.857 --> 00:23:59.553\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not doing that tonight,\n\n421\n00:23:59.553 --> 00:24:00.114\nthat's bad.\n\n422\n00:24:00.114 --> 00:24:02.897\nSo, I could do some\nadaptive noise reduction,\n\n423\n00:24:02.897 --> 00:24:06.807\nI might have to do that if I have\njust the camera, mic, a good song.\n\n424\n00:24:06.807 --> 00:24:10.126\nAnd what's interesting now, for lavaliers,\nthey're making Bluetooth lavaliers.\n\n425\n00:24:10.126 --> 00:24:11.020\nFor phones.\n\n426\n00:24:12.253 --> 00:24:13.636\n&gt;&gt; And they're really nice.\n\n427\n00:24:13.636 --> 00:24:15.900\n&gt;&gt; That just records right\ndirectly into your phone?\n\n428\n00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.440\n&gt;&gt; Right directly into the phone.\n\n429\n00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.924\nNotice we also have click removal,\ncuz occasionally you have some clicks.\n\n430\n00:24:20.924 --> 00:24:23.840\nFlangers, reverbs, distortion.\n\n431\n00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.430\nAll of these.\nI mean, there's just so much.\n\n432\n00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.240\n&gt;&gt; I feel like we're in guitar\n\n433\n00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.390\npeddles right now\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n434\n00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:31.650\nI feel like I am definitely back in\nthe days of, I'm a bass player and\n\n435\n00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.510\nthey just kept telling me to\nput a lot of reverb on it.\n\n436\n00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.480\n&gt;&gt; I was a bass player, too.\n\n437\n00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.201\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was a terrible bass player,\nthat's why I have a lot of reverb.\n\n438\n00:24:38.201 --> 00:24:44.510\nOkay, let me just go ahead and do a\nmulti-band compressor and pop it on there.\n\n439\n00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.040\nAnd notice, it shows up here.\n\n440\n00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.853\nIf I go to Edit, this is what\na multi-band compressor looks like.\n\n441\n00:24:51.853 --> 00:24:54.704\nAnd usually people and just [SOUND].\n\n442\n00:24:54.704 --> 00:24:56.415\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cancel nevermind [LAUGH].\n\n443\n00:24:56.415 --> 00:25:01.400\n&gt;&gt; But notice at the top,\nAdobe gives you a lot of presets.\n\n444\n00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.450\nSo I can say fast and smooth, and\nI can hear what that sounds like.\n\n445\n00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.960\n&gt;&gt; A little more delicate\nthan you wanna be.\n\n446\n00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.263\nI've also set up an audio-menagerie,\n\n447\n00:25:11.263 --> 00:25:14.540\nbecause if anything-\n&gt;&gt; I threw in the microphones cuz they're\n\n448\n00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.320\neasy to hear.\n\n449\n00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.320\nI did the frequency cuz it's\neasy to hear a frequency change.\n\n450\n00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.360\nCompression is not easy to hear.\n\n451\n00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:27.150\nBasically, the idea behind compression is\nfrom your lowest sound to your loudest\n\n452\n00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:30.950\nsound you have a dynamic range, and\nyou might be trying to compress that so\n\n453\n00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.250\nit's easier to control volume and\nit's easier to hear your subject.\n\n454\n00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.040\nBecause I'm so\n\n455\n00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.100\nclose to the microphone, I have good\ncompression between my lowest and loudest.\n\n456\n00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.300\nIf I was still in the camera, it'd be\nbigger and I might need to compress it.\n\n457\n00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.410\nBut that doesn't solve a lot of problems.\n\n458\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.760\nSo this is just the very basic, and\nprobably what you're gonna end up doing\n\n459\n00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.235\nout there, you got a voice, you got some\nmusic, and then if I watch the levels-\n\n460\n00:25:54.235 --> 00:25:56.050\n&gt;&gt; Problems, and you have to be-\n\n461\n00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.020\n&gt;&gt; That is good strong signal.\n\n462\n00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.190\nIf they were way down here,\nthat's not good strong signal.\n\n463\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:04.550\nBecause when you deliver signal,\nyou wanna make it so\n\n464\n00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.890\nthat people can control\ntheir volume very well.\n\n465\n00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.050\nIf it's all the way down or\ntoo far up, they can't do it.\n\n466\n00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:16.210\nSo, this is just some essential\naudio moves that you can do.\n\n467\n00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:20.850\nI'm gonna do one last thing cuz\nI know people gonna ask, okay?\n\n468\n00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:21.620\nGo up here.\n\n469\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.660\nYes, you can add fades.\n\n470\n00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.130\nYou can add cross-fades, okay?\n\n471\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.340\nThere's a couple ways to do it.\n\n472\n00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.720\nSequence &gt; Apply audio transition.\n\n473\n00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.590\nThis is going to be\nthe default transition.\n\n474\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.800\nAnd you're probably saying to\nyourself well, which one is it?\n\n475\n00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.030\nBecause there's so\nmany transitions in Adobe.\n\n476\n00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.150\nWell, remember,\nthose were video transitions.\n\n477\n00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.718\nAudio, you get three.\n\n478\n00:26:45.718 --> 00:26:46.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n479\n00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.210\n&gt;&gt; So you get constant gain.\n\n480\n00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:53.370\nConstant gain is basically meant\nto go between two things, okay?\n\n481\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.805\nYou also get an exponential fade.\n\n482\n00:26:54.805 --> 00:26:58.416\nAn exponential fade is a good one\nwhen you're coming into, okay,\n\n483\n00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:01.131\nwhen you're coming out of silence or\nsomething.\n\n484\n00:27:01.131 --> 00:27:03.250\nAnd all you have to do\ntechnically is drag it.\n\n485\n00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.530\nI could drag it right here.\n\n486\n00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.230\nAnd I could drag it right there, okay?\n\n487\n00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.970\nI know why it's not\ndoing that in this case.\n\n488\n00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:17.170\nBut honestly, and you have to,\nand then, and you can adjust it.\n\n489\n00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.920\nYou can adjust how long\nit is by doing this.\n\n490\n00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.140\nJust doing a simple trim.\n\n491\n00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.720\nOr double-clicking it and\nchanging the time.\n\n492\n00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.380\nAnd it does the same thing\nwhere if I highlighted it and\n\n493\n00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:32.900\nI did the default, apply default\ntransition, it's gonna do both sides.\n\n494\n00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.950\nIt does both ends.\nSo, there you go.\n\n495\n00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.120\nAnd yeah, fun times.\n\n496\n00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.170\n&gt;&gt;

[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Now most people say, that's great.\n\n31\n00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.110\nIt looks really cool.\n\n32\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.680\nIt's terrific.\n\n33\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.320\nI'm one of those people that's like,\nit's got problems.\n\n34\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.000\nLet me make it pop for you.\n\n35\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.300\nHere's how I'm gonna make it pop.\n\n36\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.020\nFirst of all, and\nI'm gonna go through this really fast.\n\n37\n00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.010\nOkay, I'm going to do this really fast.\n\n38\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.950\nYou'll get an idea when you get\nmore experience and when you've\n\n39\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.300\ndone things a lot and you've made\na lot of mistakes how you can improve.\n\n40\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.170\nSo I'm going to go over to my effects area\nbecause the first thing I want to correct\n\n41\n00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.500\nis the audio.\n\n42\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.480\nWe go to effects and get that ready.\n\n43\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.103\nNow, I notice this is a little bit loud.\n\n44\n00:01:56.103 --> 00:01:56.916\nOkay.\n\n45\n00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.931\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND].\n\n46\n00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:00.190\nIt's okay.\n\n47\n00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.480\nIt could be a little better,\nso I can do that gain thing.\n\n48\n00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.880\nControl, I can do it on this side and\nadjust gain.\n\n49\n00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.200\nDo the audio gain.\n\n50\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.070\nAnd it's down to about negative 12,\nwhich is fine, when the gain's been set.\n\n51\n00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.160\nI'm gonna take it down about four more.\n\n52\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.330\nOkay, [NOISE] and\nto me that's a little bit better.\n\n53\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.700\nIt's a little more even, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.500\nNow, this we're doing amplitude,\n\n55\n00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.360\nwhich is basically just in terms\nof power how loud and soft it is.\n\n56\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.120\nI wanna do some frequency because when we\nequalize we're equalizing for the ear.\n\n57\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.090\nAnd I'd like a little more mid,\na little less of that high, and\n\n58\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.890\na little bit less of that low.\n\n59\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.320\nSo I want to equalize it\nout a little bit more.\n\n60\n00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.670\nSo what I'm going to do is type in EQ and\nit's going to give me a bunch.\n\n61\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.870\nNow there's an obsolete EQ.\n\n62\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.030\nThere's the parametric we use before.\n\n63\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.170\nAnd I think I'm just\ngoing to go with that.\n\n64\n00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.080\nI'll take the parametric equalizer, drag\nit on top, and notice this is like doing.\n\n65\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.250\nAnd effect in the segment.\n\n66\n00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.800\nSo doing a track i'm\njust doing on segment.\n\n67\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.080\nI have this in it right here,\nboom and it brings it up we're go and\n\n68\n00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.320\ndo the track, it's the exact same thing.\n\n69\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.650\nOkay, let me just squeeze up a little bit,\nI do have presets.\n\n70\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.160\nSo I can say it's a loudness maximizer.\n\n71\n00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.178\nIt sounds like old time radio.\n\n72\n00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:21.363\nSo these are, a lot of these are used for\ncharacter stuff or music.\n\n73\n00:03:21.363 --> 00:03:25.200\nI'm gonna go ahead and do this myself,\nand just say all right.\n\n74\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.771\nI wanna bring down the highs just a bit.\n\n75\n00:03:27.771 --> 00:03:33.470\nBring down the lows just a little bit and\nthen bring up a little bit of the mids,\n\n76\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.486\nbecause that's sort of the clarity\narea that we're dealing with.\n\n77\n00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:44.378\nI'll bring this over here and\nlisten to it.\n\n78\n00:03:44.378 --> 00:03:48.120\n[SOUND] Now, let me bypass it.\n\n79\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.972\nIf I bypass it, I'm bypassing the effect.\n\n80\n00:03:49.972 --> 00:03:55.556\n[SOUND] Okay, so that's a little tinny.\n\n81\n00:03:55.556 --> 00:04:02.828\n[NOISE] When I hit the spacebar now,\nbecause I hit bypass.\n\n82\n00:04:02.828 --> 00:04:04.300\n&gt;&gt; It's wanting to turn on or off.\n\n83\n00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.875\n&gt;&gt; It's wanting to turn on or\noff the bypass.\n\n84\n00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:06.930\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna use J,\n\n85\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.730\nK and L to move now.\n\n86\n00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.522\nSo I just J [NOISE] Now I'm loosing\na little bit of that bottom.\n\n87\n00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:16.293\nSo we try it again.\n\n88\n00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:19.871\n[SOUND] That's a little bit better and\n\n89\n00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:25.098\nI might bring back just to\na little bit of the highest.\n\n90\n00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.834\n[SOUND] Let me do this again.\n\n91\n00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:34.676\n[SOUND] By pass, come on.\n\n92\n00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:39.059\n[SOUND].\n\n93\n00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:42.650\nOkay, so\nI've taken out a lot of that hiss.\n\n94\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.280\nAnd I like that.\n\n95\n00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.440\nSo I've made a pop because I'm taking\nout some of the hiss and it's not so\n\n96\n00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.820\ndistracting.\n\n97\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.860\nNow let's work on the visuals.\n\n98\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.220\nI know that a lot of people are like that\ncolor correction thing's really cool, man,\n\n99\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.490\nbut it's really, and like if you're\na Photoshop user, you're gonna love this.\n\n100\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.950\nThis is considered obsolete now but\n\n101\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.160\nthere is the shadow and\nhighlight and it is automatic.\n\n102\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.820\nSo if I click it and drag it on, Boom.\n\n103\n00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.401\nAnd now it evens out a little bit.\n\n104\n00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:17.641\nI can see within this phase,\nsee, you're so happy right now.\n\n105\n00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:21.826\n&gt;&gt; This is my absolute favorite\ncorrection in Photoshop, and I'm like,\n\n106\n00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:24.280\nit can't be the exact same thing, is it?\n\n107\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.200\nIt is.\n\n108\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.619\nYes, I love it.\n\n109\n00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:28.940\n&gt;&gt; It is the exact same thing.\n\n110\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.561\nLet me just bring the whole thing up here.\n\n111\n00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:32.958\nI now have more clarity.\n\n112\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.512\nHe's not so dark.\n\n113\n00:05:34.512 --> 00:05:38.810\n&gt;&gt;

This is a layer mask to me.\n\n210\n00:10:00.853 --> 00:10:05.710\n&gt;&gt; I'm essentially what in Photoshop\npeople would call a layer mask.\n\n211\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.210\nSo now I come back over here to\nthe effects, I want to type in GAU for\n\n212\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.700\ngauge and blur, okay.\n\n213\n00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.850\nTake the gauge and blur,\nput it in the ellipse.\n\n214\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.282\nHighlight the ellipse, blur it up.\n\n215\n00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:22.232\nBlur it up, quite a bit.\n\n216\n00:10:22.232 --> 00:10:25.787\nI'm going to come down to the bottom and\nturn it back on.\n\n217\n00:10:25.787 --> 00:10:31.187\nOkay, video one's back on,\ntake that bottom, find the opacity,\n\n218\n00:10:31.187 --> 00:10:35.380\nbring that opacity down,\nand now I have a vignette.\n\n219\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.350\nLet me turn the opacity on off.\n\n220\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.838\nI have a very slight vignette\nthat focuses on the dog.\n\n221\n00:10:40.838 --> 00:10:42.792\nI've made it pop.\n\n222\n00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:46.562\nLet me just go real extreme like that.\n\n223\n00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:47.062\nBoom.\n\n224\n00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.893\nIf you didn't know that\nvignette was there,\n\n225\n00:10:49.893 --> 00:10:51.427\nyou wouldn't really be able to tell.\n\n226\n00:10:51.427 --> 00:10:54.050\nI like to put mine at about 85%.\n\n227\n00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:59.330\nNow the reason why I do this Instead of\ndoing the one in the color correction tool\n\n228\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.780\nis because this was taught to me by Alexis\nVan Hurkman, who I mentioned earlier,\n\n229\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.580\nhe likes to do a vignettes in the angle\nwhere the light is coming from.\n\n230\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.872\nSo I may rotate this and\n\n231\n00:11:09.872 --> 00:11:13.339\nit's like I want the vignette coming\nmore from the lighting source.\n\n232\n00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:16.290\nDidn't have to do that in this case,\nbut done.\n\n233\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.570\nNow, let's say,\nsomebody says make a title that says,\n\n234\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.610\nvisit Colombia, and make it pop.\n\n235\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.050\nOkay, here's what I'm gonna do first,\nthis throws people.\n\n236\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.270\nIf you're an after Effects person, I'm\nnot sure what you would do in Photoshop\n\n237\n00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.160\nwith this, but I bet you're gonna tell me.\n\n238\n00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.500\nI'm gonna highlight these three.\n\n239\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.450\nOkay, right here.\n\n240\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.830\nAnd I'm gonna go to clip, nest.\n\n241\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.309\nClick nest, and I'm going to\nsay that this is the vignette.\n\n242\n00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:51.310\nClick Okay.\n\n243\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.940\nNow all three of those clips have been\n\n244\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.510\nnested together into\na little small sequence.\n\n245\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.523\nAnybody that uses After Effects\nis going you made a pre-comp.\n\n246\n00:12:01.523 --> 00:12:02.690\nIt's like, exactly.\n\n247\n00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.740\nIn After Effects it's\ncalled a pre-composition.\n\n248\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.732\nThe reason why I do this is what\nI'm going to do with the title.\n\n249\n00:12:08.732 --> 00:12:14.150\nI don't want to be affected or\naffect what's underneath it.\n\n250\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.510\nAnd I've added a lot of composition and\nsquirreliness.\n\n251\n00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.540\nSo I've put it all together\nin this little container.\n\n252\n00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.888\nIt's like all the little\neggs are in a nest.\n\n253\n00:12:22.888 --> 00:12:27.604\nIf I double-click this, you can see\nthat's what's inside the vignette,\n\n254\n00:12:27.604 --> 00:12:29.529\nit's like a little sequence.\n\n255\n00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:32.580\n&gt;&gt; It almost looks like a layer group,\nlike group, yeah.\n\n256\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.630\n&gt;&gt; A group layer.\n\n257\n00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.300\nNow, here's the interesting part,\nlet me delete it.\n\n258\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.100\nI can drag it back A lot of people ask me,\nwhat is this thing?\n\n259\n00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:46.240\nOkay, what is this?\n\n260\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.940\nIt says insert and overwrite sequences\nas nests or individual clips.\n\n261\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.870\nIf it is on, it has a line through it.\n\n262\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.240\nSo that means not a nest or sequence.\n\n263\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.020\nSo if I drag it,\nit's got an audio with it which is weird/\n\n264\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:14.460\nIt automatically puts like an audio with\nit so boom, I'll just take that, boom.\n\n265\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.520\nAnd I get the vignette back in\nits place and everything is fine.\n\n266\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.691\nBut let's say I wanna doctor it.\n\n267\n00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:25.410\nIf I turn this off,\nnotice, there are three.\n\n268\n00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:30.630\nAnd if I drag it, it comes back like that.\n\n269\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.553\nSo this is also a lot of people say, hey,\n\n270\n00:13:32.553 --> 00:13:35.052\ndoes that mean I don't have\nto work in one sequence?\n\n271\n00:13:35.052 --> 00:13:39.464\nLike if I'm breaking things down\nby acts I can make them all\n\n272\n00:13:39.464 --> 00:13:44.069\nmultiple sequences and\nthen put sequences into sequences.\n\n273\n00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.990\nYeah.\n\n274\n00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.170\nYou can do it that way, too,\nand you bring over as nests or\n\n275\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.040\nyou can bring them over in this way.\n\n276\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.300\nSo, I'm just gonna go back a couple,\ngot what I need and\n\n277\n00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.720\nnow I'm going to do a title.\n\n278\n00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.570\nNow I've already prepared somethings for\nyou.\n\n279\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.530\nI have one to visit Columbia.\n\n280\n00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.850\nOkay, fine.\n\n281\n00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.360\nAnd this is going to be interesting.\n\n282\n00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.600\nI'm gonna put it above.\n\n283\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.060\nI've got four video tracks now and\nI put in video three.\n\n284\n00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.810\nNow, using the simple title tool\n\n285\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.530\nI created this thing that kinda\nlooks like the Colombian flag.\n\n286\n00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.610\nI'm gonna put it right underneath.\n\n287\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.300\nWell that certainly makes it pop,\nbut here's what I'm gonna do.\n\n288\n00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.666\nI'm gonna do that track mat thing again,\n\n289\n00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:34.419\nokay effects, track,\ncome on, track, there we go.\n\n290\n00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:38.620\nTrack Mat Key, pop it on there.\n\n291\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.960\nCome down, and it'll say where is it,\nin Video 4 or Video 3?\n\n292\n00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.770\nBecause now we have\ncouple more tracks above.\n\n293\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.700\nBoom, and it's in there.\n\n294\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.668\nAnd you're like, yeah, that's pretty cool.\n\n295\n00:14:48.668 --> 00:14:49.601\nI can go a little deeper.\n\n296\n00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:53.440\nRemember, I can still\nadd effects to the flag.\n\n297\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.290\nSo what could I do?\n\n298\n00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.070\nI could animate an opacity on that.\n\n299\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.880\nOr let me see if there's some\nreally cool video effects that\n\n300\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.480\noftentimes we say, don't do that.\n\n301\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.000\nThat's terrible.\n\n302\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.280\nBut maybe there's under video.\n\n303\n00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:09.950\nIs it a clip name?\n\n304\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.810\nNo, that's awful.\n\n305\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.240\nLet's see, Utility.\n\n306\n00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.150\nSemian converter, not right now.\n\n307\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.339\nTransform, what does that do?\n\n308\n00:15:16.339 --> 00:15:17.192\nEdge feather.\n\n309\n00:15:17.192 --> 00:15:21.929\nHorizontal flip, vertical flip.\n\n310\n00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:25.790\nHm,usually that's just when people say\nthe camera's facing the wrong way.\n\n311\n00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:26.990\nWe're gonna do that.\n\n312\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.540\nLet's see what we can do with that.\n\n313\n00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.200\n&gt;&gt; We could put that on the flag.\n\n314\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Turn the colors around maybe.\n\n315\n00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.990\n&gt;&gt; I wonder if we can put\nthe- Put down the flag,\n\n316\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.535\nsee it turns the whole thing around-\n&gt;&gt;

How are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:32.863\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n11\n00:00:32.863 --> 00:00:35.611\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm going to answer\na question you had from the last one\n\n12\n00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:36.650\nreal quick.\n\n13\n00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.780\nSo, Vonne over here said hey,\n\n14\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.170\nI don't see this blackout line that\nyou're talking about, buddy, okay.\n\n15\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.250\nWell if we take a look,\nyeah, you're not seeing it.\n\n16\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.010\nBut watch what I did, I'm gonna turn this\neyeball on here, turn on the track output.\n\n17\n00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.530\nNow you see it, right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.950\nThis is why we need nests.\n\n19\n00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.640\nWhat I had with it on\nthere within the nest,\n\n20\n00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.940\nit was getting affected\nby what's in the nest.\n\n21\n00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.311\nSo I nested this, and what I did-\n&gt;&gt; When we you say affected,\n\n22\n00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:12.618\nlike the effects that were on the other\ntracks, we'll call them tracks,\n\n23\n00:01:12.618 --> 00:01:14.210\nbecause they are tracks.\n\n24\n00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.402\nAnd so it was applying to all of\nthem because they were nested.\n\n25\n00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:21.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, so even if I did this within\nthat nest, you still wouldn't see it.\n\n26\n00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.250\nSo I had to nest the other two and then,\nwhat I did was, I made a new title\n\n27\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.050\nfrom it,\nwhich was basically on the inside.\n\n28\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.840\nOkay, where it says fill,\nI chose Eliminate and\n\n29\n00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.070\nthat way,\nall you see is the outer stroke, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.800\nAll you see is the outer stroke.\n\n31\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.144\nAnd that's why now,\nwith it on the top it looks fine.\n\n32\n00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:51.160\nNow I'm gonna do one last thing,\nand it's gonna be crazy.\n\n33\n00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.660\nMake one last nest, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.500\nVisit Nest Final.\n\n35\n00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.640\nFirst of all, never name anything final.\n\n36\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.860\nYou will regret it, don't do it.\n\n37\n00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.450\nIt's like final, final, final,\nfinal, final, final, final number 5.\n\n38\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.420\nYes, this is the final, okay,\nand now, see how it's doing it?\n\n39\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.470\nThere's the big nest, and\nthen the little nest within that nest.\n\n40\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.350\nSo they're separate,\nsometimes in order for\n\n41\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.745\ncomposites to work,\nyou have to keep elements separate, and\n\n42\n00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:23.620\nnests is the best way to do that\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the same thing in\n\n43\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.620\nPhotoshop, where it's like, if I put it\nin with this group, or if I merge it,\n\n44\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.942\nit's not gonna do the same thing\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n45\n00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:31.768\n&gt;&gt; So if I just duplicate, and\nthat's what you did over in the project,\n\n46\n00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:32.660\nyou duplicated it.\n\n47\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.391\n&gt;&gt; Over the nest, and\ntherefore it was fine.\n\n48\n00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:37.943\nSo you've got, yeah, that's one of the\nthings when you're doing this, you'll find\n\n49\n00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:41.130\nyourself sort of stutter stepping going,\nwhy is this interacting with that?\n\n50\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.700\nBecause they're not separate, make\na nest here, add the new one on the top.\n\n51\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.944\nAnd it's fun, it's fun, so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n52\n00:02:46.944 --> 00:02:49.580\nI was saying this was\nvery Photoshoppy to me.\n\n53\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.959\nI was still going on that same, well,\nwhy don't we just make another one and\n\n54\n00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.060\nput it on top, and then eliminate,\nexactly what you were talking about.\n\n55\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.626\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's why we're getting\ninto multi-cam now because it's like,\n\n56\n00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:01.100\nadd more stuff, do more things.\n\n57\n00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.160\nAnd it's like, the more I add,\nthe more I do,\n\n58\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.010\nthe more I gotta keep it organized,\nand keep it how it works in my head.\n\n59\n00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.622\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna do with multi-cam.\n\n60\n00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:15.130\nSo multi-cam, in this case,\nis I shot three cameras at the same time.\n\n61\n00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.440\nAnd now I'm going to edit them like I'm in\na TV studio, just clicking back and forth.\n\n62\n00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.440\nAnd I can do that in real time in Adobe,\nand I'll show you how I did.\n\n63\n00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.920\nAnd I just use GoPros, I use GoPros and\nI use my H6N with the microphone on it.\n\n64\n00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.160\nSo I'm gonna go to the Media Browser,\nwe all love our Media Browser, okay,\n\n65\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.350\nthat is not it.\n\n66\n00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.250\nOkay, and I'm gonna find something\ncalled the Garden Multi, and\n\n67\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.120\nyou'll see there's three shots right there\nand there's the stuff in the zoom, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.660\nAnd to keep it all organized,\nCtrl-click, I'll do the Import.\n\n69\n00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.625\nIt's probably gonna give\nme an error on the thing.\n\n70\n00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:53.950\nI'm gonna go yep, and what have I done?\n\n71\n00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.500\nI have once again forgotten to take off?\n\n72\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.527\n&gt;&gt; The Ingest.\n&gt;&gt; The Ingest,\n\n73\n00:03:57.527 --> 00:03:58.920\nI have forgotten to do that.\n\n74\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.890\nBut I don't need it,\nI don't care, it's fine.\n\n75\n00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.100\nSo here's where this gets a little odd.\n\n76\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.510\nEarlier what I did was I merged clips,\nremember?\n\n77\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.722\nI had a separate piece of audio,\nand a separate piece of video,\n\n78\n00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:17.480\nI merge them together, and\nnow they're together, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.309\nSo now, what I'm gonna do with\nthis multi-cam is somewhat\n\n80\n00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:26.185\nthe same thing, but\nI'm gonna create a group.\n\n81\n00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:31.647\nSo I'm going to\nCtrl+Cmd-click all of these,\n\n82\n00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:37.244\nCtrl+click, and\nthen I get this new thing here,\n\n83\n00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:41.930\nCreate Multi-Camera Source Sequence.\n\n84\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.250\nThis is the first step.\n\n85\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.330\nNow, when I do the classic, the mess,\nyou saw the mess where it was,\n\n86\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.650\nI have all of these cameras and\nall of these microphones.\n\n87\n00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.940\nWhen I do that, one thing I do is I set\n\n88\n00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.400\nall the cameras to different\nresolutions and different frame rates.\n\n89\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.540\nIf that happens, you have to conform\nthem to all the same resolution and\n\n90\n00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.110\nall the same frame rate, or\nit will not make the sequence.\n\n91\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.719\nSo in this case, these are all shooting\nat 1920 x 1080, and they're all 29.97.\n\n92\n00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:18.110\nThey can be different times,\nI turn the cameras off and on, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.663\n&gt;&gt; The duration of how long [INAUDIBLE].\n\n94\n00:05:20.663 --> 00:05:24.980\n&gt;&gt; The duration can be fine.\n\n95\n00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.480\nBut frame rate and resolution must be the\nsame or it's not going to let you do it.\n\n96\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.420\nAnd what you'd have to do is export\nto conform, and figure that out.\n\n97\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.810\n&gt;&gt; Because this particular command\nthat you're doing only works this way.\n\n98\n00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.270\nThe other way we were doing,\nthe merging, yeah.\n\n99\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.870\n&gt;&gt; Right, the merging is fine.\n\n100\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.450\nCuz that's just merging audio to video.\n\n101\n00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.183\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; In this case I am grouping clips and\n\n102\n00:05:46.183 --> 00:05:49.250\ncreating a multi-camera source sequence.\n\n103\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.641\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n104\n00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:53.486\n&gt;&gt; Now I can Ctrl-click and say,\nCreate Multi-Camera Source Sequence, so\n\n105\n00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.300\nthis is the first step.\n\n106\n00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.480\nWe're gonna start up at the top,\nand it'll say Video Clip and Name.\n\n107\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.470\nWhat do you want it to be?\n\n108\n00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.980\nI'm gonna say Multicam_Garden, all right?\n\n109\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.990\nSynchronize, once again,\nI'm gonna use audio.\n\n110\n00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.350\nAnd I'm gonna hope that this works,\ncuz I used three GoPros.\n\n111\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.740\nTwo relatively close to me,\nand then one way far away.\n\n112\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.644\nBut what I did do is I did\ntake my hands and go, boom.\n\n113\n00:06:19.644 --> 00:06:23.030\nNow I could buy a slates,\nslates are cheap.\n\n114\n00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.170\nOr I could use an electric slate,\nwhatever.\n\n115\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.110\nBut by just doing that, boom, this audio\nsync should be able to just find that.\n\n116\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.990\n&gt;&gt; It'll find the clap and\nsync to that particular audio point.\n\n117\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.390\n&gt;&gt; It should be able to use\nthat to a grounded point.\n\n118\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.590\nNow you get other things like,\n\n119\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.060\ndo I wanna move the source\nclips to a Processed Clips bin?\n\n120\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.200\nSometimes when I wanna organize it out,\nyeah, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.480\nSequence Settings, Camera 1, that's fine.\n\n122\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.560\nEnumerate Cameras,\nUse Track Names, Use Clip Names,\n\n123\n00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.560\nI'm gonna enumerate the cameras, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.050\nHere we go.\n\n125\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.530\n&gt;&gt; You can hear the encoder\nin the background.\n\n126\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.733\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's like, [SOUND].\n\n127\n00:06:57.733 --> 00:06:58.675\n&gt;&gt; My computer is starting to take off.\n\n128\n00:06:58.675 --> 00:07:01.200\n&gt;&gt; It's like, why?\n&gt;&gt; You're making me work.\n\n129\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.390\n&gt;&gt; You're making me work,\nboom, and there it goes.\n\n130\n00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:10.690\nSo it looks like I got a fairly\ngood sync on that, not there.\n\n131\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.560\nSo now I have this thing called\na multi-camera source sequence, and\n\n132\n00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.220\nit looks like a stack of pancakes,\nis this what we edit?\n\n133\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.945\nNo, [LAUGH] you're looking at me like,\nyes, no, what?\n\n134\n00:07:21.945 --> 00:07:26.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I actually started doing a-\n&gt;&gt; You're like, stop messing with me!\n\n135\n00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.880\nOkay, but that's kinda what happens.\n\n136\n00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.330\nWhat I'm going to do is I get a new\noption with this where it will say\n\n137\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.280\nOpen in Timeline.\n\n138\n00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.740\nIt's not creating a sequence,\n\n139\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.320\nwhat it's doing is it's allowing me\nto visualize it in the Timeline Tool.\n\n140\n00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.330\nI'm gonna do that, and there it is.\n\n141\n00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.050\n&gt;&gt; Wow, there's all your pieces.\n\n142\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.990\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nit's all stacked up on top of each other.\n\n143\n00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.809\nIt's basically done for me, quote unquote,\n\n144\n00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:54.579\nautomatically what I could have\ntechnically done manually.\n\n145\n00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:58.840\nWhich is, stack all three of\nthese cameras on top, [SOUND].\n\n146\n00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.585\nBut it did it automatically based the on.\n\n147\n00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:05.568\nAnd you'll notice if I zoom in here,\nsee how these are lining up,\n\n148\n00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.570\nsee how these waveforms are lining up?\n\n149\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.361\nSo it's done a pretty good job of that.\n\n150\n00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:16.187\nIf I had somehow blown sync like\ncertain things weren't in sync,\n\n151\n00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:20.515\nthis is where I could come in and kinda\ndrag and fudge some of these in sync.\n\n152\n00:08:20.515 --> 00:08:22.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, maybe it didn't get exactly right.\n\n153\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.575\nYou can kind of move it over.\n\n154\n00:08:23.575 --> 00:08:24.920\n&gt;&gt; So I can just do this and\ndrag it over a little bit.\n\n155\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.940\nOkay, so we're set up to do multicam.\n\n156\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.580\nGonna come back over here, all right?\n\n157\n00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.770\nI'm gonna click out of that cuz\nI don't wanna see it anymore.\n\n158\n00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.270\nLet me find it here, how you doing?\n\n159\n00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.020\nNow guess what I gotta do with this?\n\n160\n00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.628\nWhich is odd,\nI'm going to Ctrl+Click it and\n\n161\n00:08:43.628 --> 00:08:46.630\nyes, Make a New Sequence from the Clip.\n\n162\n00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.560\nThis throws a lot of people.\n\n163\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.720\nIt's like, you've already got a sequence.\n\n164\n00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.170\nIt's like, no,\nI have a multi-camera source sequence.\n\n165\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.630\nSo it's considered a source.\n\n166\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.987\nSo now I go, [SOUND].\n\n167\n00:08:58.987 --> 00:09:01.308\n&gt;&gt; Is it kind of like the left and\nthe right almost,\n\n168\n00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:04.632\nlike you kinda grouped it over in\nthe source, the left-hand side?\n\n169\n00:09:04.632 --> 00:09:05.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.230\n&gt;&gt; But\nnow it's a sequence in the timeline.\n\n171\n00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.160\n&gt;&gt; Now it's a sequence.\n\n172\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.026\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now it's a sequence, and\n\n173\n00:09:11.026 --> 00:09:13.462\nyou're saying, wow,\nthat looks really cool.\n\n174\n00:09:13.462 --> 00:09:15.951\nIt just looks like cameras and\nstuff like that.\n\n175\n00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:21.800\nBut if I come up here\nto the button editor,\n\n176\n00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.990\ntoggle multi-camera view.\n\n177\n00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.181\nBoom.\n\n178\n00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:36.870\nNow I see I can switch\nbetween all of these cameras.\n\n179\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.180\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's all on the V1.\n\n180\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.214\n&gt;&gt; That is all in the V1,\nokay, it's all in the V1.\n\n181\n00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:42.831\nHang on, I'm going to stop this.\n\n182\n00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:48.414\nStop, no, okay, you're terrible, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:48.414 --> 00:09:49.419\nI don't need you.\n\n184\n00:09:49.419 --> 00:09:50.432\nGo away.\n\n185\n00:09:50.432 --> 00:09:55.230\nSo and it will play\n&gt;&gt; Maybe if you are in a controlled space\n\n186\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.792\nlike the one I'm doing my lessons.\n\n187\n00:09:57.792 --> 00:10:01.300\nNow here's the cool thing about this,\nready?\n\n188\n00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.300\nFirst of all, start at the very beginning.\n\n189\n00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.780\nI turned the audio on first, can you tell?\n\n190\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.010\nIt's in sync, that's why we're\nnot seeing any cameras right now.\n\n191\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.220\nOne Go-Pro is about to turn on, cool.\n\n192\n00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.080\nNow here's the next one,\nand here's the next one.\n\n193\n00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.460\nSo I don't really need any of that.\n\n194\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.490\nLet's just cue that out,\nstart at the beginning.\n\n195\n00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.520\nI don't like starting with that shot,\nso I'll start with this shot.\n\n196\n00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.460\nOr maybe this shot, that's supposed\nto be me in front of the camera, so.\n\n197\n00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.685\n&gt;&gt; Let me tell you a little\nbit about Singer's Garden.\n\n198\n00:10:31.685 --> 00:10:33.550\nLet me tell you a little bit about this.\n\n199\n00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.050\n&gt;&gt; Ready?\n&gt;&gt; On three.\n\n200\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.833\nOkay, so one, two,\n\n201\n00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:42.001\nand three.\nIt's kinda like they're describing\n\n202\n00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:46.040\nThe Mess if you watch The Mess.\nIf you didn't, that's okay.\n\n203\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.390\nI established a line.\n\n204\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.180\nIt's 180 degrees on this one.\n\n205\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.116\n&gt;&gt; it looks like all of sudden you say,\nhey,\n\n206\n00:10:52.116 --> 00:10:53.800\nthere's is a little nudge down there,\nwhat's that?\n\n207\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.600\nThat's down here, that's all\nthe edits I just made in real time.\n\n208\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.916\n&gt;&gt; Every time you're\nclicking one of the squares,\n\n209\n00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:02.434\nyou're actually doing-\n&gt;&gt; Every time I click one of\n\n210\n00:11:02.434 --> 00:11:05.180\nthose squares, it created it an edit.\n\n211\n00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.290\n&gt;&gt; As I go to this camera.\n\n212\n00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.050\n&gt;&gt; Go to this camera.\n\n213\n00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:08.820\nGo to that camera.\n\n214\n00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.230\n&gt;&gt; All by that box up there.\n\n215\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.156\n&gt;&gt; Hey, let's remember something,\nkeyboard shortcuts.\n\n216\n00:11:14.156 --> 00:11:16.988\nWhat is one, two, three, four?\n\n217\n00:11:16.988 --> 00:11:18.310\nSelect camera.\n\n218\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.160\nSo that's interesting.\n\n219\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.260\nSo I wonder what happens if I put my\nfingers over one, two, three, and four.\n\n220\n00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.320\nSo this one's one, two, and three, okay?\n\n221\n00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.878\nI'm thinking.\n\n222\n00:11:32.878 --> 00:11:42.810\n&gt;&gt; Are you trying to change the-\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\n\n223\n00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.330\nI don't think I'm gonna do that this time.\n\n224\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.560\n&gt;&gt; Were you trying to change the order,\nlike what is one, what is two?\n\n225\n00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can change that.\n\n226\n00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.290\nBut it's like, no, this one's three.\n\n227\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:49.810\nThis one's two.\n\n228\n00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.740\nThis one's one.\n\n229\n00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.140\nWhy not?\n\n230\n00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:52.740\nThree.\n&gt;&gt; Three, two, one.\n\n231\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.150\n&gt;&gt; Two, one.\n&gt;&gt; We'll just go backwards.\n\n232\n00:11:56.162 --> 00:11:57.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that works.\n\n233\n00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.460\nSo we'll start with three and\na zipline, [INAUDIBLE] first garden.\n\n234\n00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.658\nLet me tell you a little bit about this,\ngreat.\n\n235\n00:12:06.658 --> 00:12:08.640\nAnd then the [INAUDIBLE] garden on three,\nokay?\n\n236\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.389\nSo we got one, two, and three.\n\n237\n00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:18.110\nIt's kinda like they're described in\nThe Mess, if you've watched The Mess.\n\n238\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.110\nIf you didn't, that's okay.\n\n239\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.950\n&gt;&gt; Boom.\nAnd there's the edits.\n\n240\n00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:20.450\nRight there.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n241\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.804\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if set up properly,\n\n242\n00:12:22.804 --> 00:12:25.640\nthis can be pretty great.\n\n243\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.980\nWhat can I do from here?\n\n244\n00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.595\nWell, let's say I cut to the wrong angle.\n\n245\n00:12:30.595 --> 00:12:34.202\nOkay, let's say on this one,\nI didn't want to cut to that angle.\n\n246\n00:12:34.202 --> 00:12:35.340\nWhat do I do?\n\n247\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.362\nRedo the whole thing?\n\n248\n00:12:36.362 --> 00:12:41.205\nNo, Ctrl+Click, down here is gonna\nbe a new thing that says multicam.\n\n249\n00:12:41.205 --> 00:12:43.793\nAnd it'll say, switch it.\n\n250\n00:12:43.793 --> 00:12:44.989\n&gt;&gt; You didn't switch it right there?\n\n251\n00:12:44.989 --> 00:12:45.527\n&gt;&gt; Switch it to Camera 1.\n\n252\n00:12:47.173 --> 00:12:49.858\n&gt;&gt; So if I've messed that up,\nor I can also, and\n\n253\n00:12:49.858 --> 00:12:54.405\nit's best that you do this because this\nis audio that's synced off of the H.\n\n254\n00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.065\n&gt;&gt; This is not from the cameras.\n\n255\n00:12:57.065 --> 00:13:02.240\nThis is from the H6n so it has to\nremain in sync with all the shots.\n\n256\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.764\nSo if I get the Rolling edit tool.\n\n257\n00:13:06.764 --> 00:13:09.584\nCuz the point of really doing\nmulti-cameras is you want to keep this\n\n258\n00:13:09.584 --> 00:13:11.210\ngoing in real time and in sync.\n\n259\n00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.426\nI can say okay, that edit's a little soon.\n\n260\n00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.958\nI like a cutting there instead.\n\n261\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.581\nMaybe this one came a little soon.\n\n262\n00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:22.683\nMove that.\n\n263\n00:13:22.683 --> 00:13:24.000\nMove that over.\n\n264\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.710\nMove this one a little bit.\n\n265\n00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.630\nSo, yeah, and I can move and\nI can edit the edits, so to speak.\n\n266\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.276\nLet me tell you a little bit about this,\ngreat.\n\n267\n00:13:32.276 --> 00:13:36.910\nAnd then the [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Now, here's something interesting\n\n268\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.210\nthat happens with multicam mode that\nyou can have a lot of fun with.\n\n269\n00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:46.310\nLet's say you only wanna\nretool a segment of this.\n\n270\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.580\nLike everything's great, but somebody\nsays, okay, between this endpoint and\n\n271\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.560\nbetween that outpoint,\nyou really kind of blew it.\n\n272\n00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.491\nAnd I'll say, okay, well,\nsomething that will help me is,\n\n273\n00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:02.595\nup here somewhere, play video into out.\n\n274\n00:14:05.573 --> 00:14:07.140\nGonna drag that here.\n\n275\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:14.360\nSo when I'm doing my multi-camera edit,\nyou can take this back to the endpoint and\n\n276\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.530\ninstead of hitting Play,\nI'm gonna hit play into out.\n\n277\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.410\nNow where did I put it?\n\n278\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.720\nLet's scoot this over here a little bit.\n\n279\n00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.400\nDid I put it down there?\n\n280\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.620\nI put it way on the end?\n\n281\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.500\nIs that what i did?\n\n282\n00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.750\nI don't know.\n\n283\n00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.590\nWhere did I put it?\n\n284\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.980\nI bet I screwed it all up.\n\n285\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.430\nLet's try it one more time.\n\n286\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.850\nLet's get planned out.\n\n287\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:36.180\nWe're gonna drag it right there,\nclick OK, there you are.\n\n288\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:43.800\nAnd if I do that-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n289\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.660\n&gt;&gt; All the cameras\n\n290\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.820\nwere on this side of the line.\n\n291\n00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.640\n&gt;&gt; I don't have to worry\nabout it going past.\n\n292\n00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.580\nBecause every time it plays,\nit goes between the in and the out point.\n\n293\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.660\nSo if there's just one section I have to\ncorrect And I don't wanna go into another\n\n294\n00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.280\nsection, I do Play and Out,\nand I'll just do it again.\n\n295\n00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.500\nIt's like, well,\nscrewed that one up again.\n\n296\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.264\nAnd I will do Play and Out,\nI'll even start at the out point,\n\n297\n00:15:08.264 --> 00:15:10.725\nI'm just that crazy, ready?\n\n298\n00:15:10.725 --> 00:15:12.658\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] on this line?\n\n299\n00:15:12.658 --> 00:15:15.890\nWhat are the [INAUDIBLE] over here?\n\n300\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Here all the cameras were\non this side of the line.\n\n301\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.810\n&gt;&gt; And it just re-cut it.\n\n302\n00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.780\nAnd it only plays between the in and\noutput.\n\n303\n00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.660\nIt's like, okay,\nthis is the part we botched.\n\n304\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.160\nWe screwed up this part to this part.\n\n305\n00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.140\nSo just drop it in an out point.\n\n306\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.690\nAnd every time you hit your edits,\nit doesn't go beyond the outpoint.\n\n307\n00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.190\n&gt;&gt; It changes all the cameras so\nyou don't have to do the whole thing.\n\n308\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n309\n00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.600\n&gt;&gt; I just got it.\n\n310\n00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.150\nCuz for awhile, I'm going,\nI see what you're saying.\n\n311\n00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.850\nThis one part we messed up which\ncamera's wanna use switch.\n\n312\n00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:48.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so look.\n\n313\n00:15:48.535 --> 00:15:51.453\nThe whole thing looks great, but\ncan you just recut this part?\n\n314\n00:15:51.453 --> 00:15:53.791\n&gt;&gt; Recut the multi-camera changing-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n315\n00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:54.708\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Thing.\n\n316\n00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:55.773\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n317\n00:15:55.773 --> 00:15:56.656\n&gt;&gt; And it's like,\n\n318\n00:15:56.656 --> 00:16:00.893\nfine I'm just gonna start over instead\nof doing the command click and all that.\n\n319\n00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:01.542\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n\n320\n00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:05.912\nNow, the other thing I can do,\nat the end, people will say, well,\n\n321\n00:16:05.912 --> 00:16:07.470\nhow do I color correct?\n\n322\n00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.242\nAnd it's like,\nthat's a great question, and\n\n323\n00:16:10.242 --> 00:16:14.002\nthat's one of the reasons why you\nhave to remember your source.\n\n324\n00:16:14.002 --> 00:16:19.740\nRemember, that source sequence was three\nvideos stacked on top of each other, okay?\n\n325\n00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.941\nSo I'm gonna get rid of this in and\nout point by going option IO,\n\n326\n00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:28.961\nI have the option to get rid get of it,\nand I will highlight the whole thing.\n\n327\n00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:32.817\nThat's a command A,\nit's fairly common, control, click,\n\n328\n00:16:32.817 --> 00:16:36.541\nI'm gonna go up to the selector,\njust to feel comfortable.\n\n329\n00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:41.845\nControl, click, and\nI'm going to go down to that Multi-Camera,\n\n330\n00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:44.554\nthere's a thing called Flatten.\n\n331\n00:16:44.554 --> 00:16:47.124\n&gt;&gt; When you say flatten,\nthat starts to scare me.\n\n332\n00:16:47.124 --> 00:16:47.976\nIn Photoshop-\n&gt;&gt; I know, in Photoshop.\n\n333\n00:16:47.976 --> 00:16:48.793\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:16:48.793 --> 00:16:49.849\n&gt;&gt; It can be the same thing.\n\n335\n00:16:49.849 --> 00:16:54.052\nThat's, so before you flatten,\nmake a duplicate.\n\n336\n00:16:54.052 --> 00:16:54.784\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n\n337\n00:16:54.784 --> 00:16:57.790\n&gt;&gt; Always make a duplicate\nbefore you flatten, okay?\n\n338\n00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.495\nAlways, now I'm not gonna do that today.\n\n339\n00:17:00.495 --> 00:17:07.227\nBut when you flatten, basically\nlet's say there are three tracks,\n\n340\n00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:11.532\nbut I'm only using one\nat a time in the edit.\n\n341\n00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:16.096\nWhen I flatten,\nit throws away the layers I didn't use, or\n\n342\n00:17:16.096 --> 00:17:21.070\nthe tracks I didn't use to take\nme down to one track, okay?\n\n343\n00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:26.001\nOne track of each that will be easier for\nme to color correct,\n\n344\n00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:28.330\nadd effects, and process.\n\n345\n00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.367\nAnd this is how you want to\nflatten it before you deliver,\n\n346\n00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:32.501\nyou want to flatten it before\nyou do your color correction.\n\n347\n00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:36.355\nBecause yeah, I mean, goPros are great,\nbut they also do your\n\n348\n00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:41.252\nautomatic color balance, so this one in\nthis on the shady side looks like this.\n\n349\n00:17:41.252 --> 00:17:44.437\nThis in the hot blasting sun,\nthis one pointing this way, so\n\n350\n00:17:44.437 --> 00:17:47.350\nit looks like Butch Cassidy and\nthe Sundance Kid.\n\n351\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.433\nNow, we've got The Walking Dead\nfollowed by more Walking Dead.\n\n352\n00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:54.449\nSo I'm gonna have to\nbalance out those cameras,\n\n353\n00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:58.140\nand if I had to do all three at a time,\nit's gonna lock it up.\n\n354\n00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.396\nSo, duplicate, flatten, and then it's\njust like a regular old sequence.\n\n355\n00:18:03.396 --> 00:18:08.390\nSo this is Multicam,\nhow you can edit in real time.\n\n356\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.452\nThe purpose of Multicam is maybe you're\ndoing an interview with somebody and\n\n357\n00:18:12.452 --> 00:18:16.150\nyou want to put two cameras, so\nyou're just gonna cut it in real time.\n\n358\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.128\nOr you're gonna do a demonstration, you're\ngonna do like a cooking demonstration,\n\n359\n00:18:19.128 --> 00:18:20.940\nor something like that,\nyou lay out three cameras.\n\n360\n00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.593\nBecause the purpose is you're\ngonna run through it and\n\n361\n00:18:23.593 --> 00:18:27.169\nthen you're gonna cut it in real time,\nkind of like what the directors and\n\n362\n00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:30.931\nprofessionals do here at CreativePro.TV,\nwhat they're doing right now.\n\n363\n00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:34.746\nBut when you do it as well as they do, you\nneed lots of people and lots of cameras\n\n364\n00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:38.534\nand stuff like this, this is you're\ndoing it yourself and all that, okay?\n\n365\n00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:42.044\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's as if we had all three of\nthese cameras running simultaneously,\n\n366\n00:18:42.044 --> 00:18:44.532\nthey could it in post like\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n367\n00:18:44.532 --> 00:18:46.366\nThey're actually-\n&gt;&gt; They're doing it right now,\n\n368\n00:18:46.366 --> 00:18:46.937\nthey're amazing.\n\n369\n00:18:46.937 --> 00:18:48.611\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's the thing,\n\n370\n00:18:48.611 --> 00:18:53.438\nis that you would be able to do this in\npost, you'd be able to do it in real time,\n\n371\n00:18:53.438 --> 00:18:55.721\nand have a really good time doing it.\n\n372\n00:18:55.721 --> 00:18:59.398\nBut remember,\nthis is kind of a specialty thing, too, so\n\n373\n00:18:59.398 --> 00:19:03.020\nmost people do Multicam,\nit's all that they do.\n\n374\n00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.952\nMitch Jacobson has a great book on\nAmazon.com about cutting what they\n\n375\n00:19:07.952 --> 00:19:10.053\ncall ISO multi-cam, okay?\n\n376\n00:19:10.053 --> 00:19:12.902\nIsolated camera multi-cam, it's very cool.\n\n377\n00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:16.849\nIf you start to do this and\nit's not something you've done before,\n\n378\n00:19:16.849 --> 00:19:21.430\nit's okay to screw it up, because you're\ngonna have to, you forget things.\n\n379\n00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.457\nI forget to do this, I forget to do that,\nand then I go through my little mental\n\n380\n00:19:24.457 --> 00:19:27.320\nchecklist and then it's like,\nI forgot to do this, I forgot to do that.\n\n381\n00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.753\nBut yeah, this is Multicam,\nand it can be a lot of fun.\n\n382\n00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:36.202\n&gt;&gt; And if you capture it, then doing all\nof those, I love just, boom, boom, boom.\n\n383\n00:19:36.202 --> 00:19:39.437\nI feel like I'm my own little director,\nI'm moving around.\n\n384\n00:19:39.437 --> 00:19:40.491\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n385\n00:19:40.491 --> 00:19:43.354\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool, so, all right,\nwell, thank you so much for the Multicam.\n\n386\n00:19:43.354 --> 00:19:47.180\nSo now I feel like we should go ahead and\nswitch over to this shot right here.\n\n387\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.172\nLook at that, that was a one and a two.\n\n388\n00:19:49.172 --> 00:19:50.937\nI know, it's just-\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, you are the best.\n\n389\n00:19:50.937 --> 00:19:51.936\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are the best.\n\n390\n00:19:51.936 --> 00:19:52.952\nYou are like-\n&gt;&gt; Or the worst.\n\n391\n00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:55.832\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no,\nyou make my day a little brighter,\n\n392\n00:19:55.832 --> 00:19:57.693\nyou make my day a little brighter.\n\n393\n00:19:57.693 --> 00:19:58.892\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that's what I do.\n\n394\n00:19:58.892 --> 00:20:02.906\n[LAUGH] But that's where we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign off this episode.\n\n395\n00:20:02.906 --> 00:20:06.852\nSo for another episode of CreativePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n396\n00:20:06.852 --> 00:20:07.363\n&gt;&gt;

How you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.860\n&gt;&gt; How you doing?\n&gt;&gt; Know why I'm dancing?\n\n10\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.650\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n&gt;&gt; Because it's the wild west when\n\n11\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.350\nit comes to 360 Video.\n\n12\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810\nIt's the wild west.\n\n13\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.050\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to make\na really lame circle.\n\n14\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.886\n[CROSSTALK] We're talking about video.\n\n15\n00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:46.345\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were\ngetting me to do-si-do.\n\n16\n00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know what was going on there.\n\n17\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.140\n&gt;&gt; We've got all these things going.\n\n18\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.435\nIt's circular, it's circular.\n\n19\n00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:56.060\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Bring it in people, bring it in.\n\n20\n00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.220\nOkay, so yeah, no, 360 video.\n\n21\n00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.460\nIt is the wild west.\n\n22\n00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.850\nThere's no real standard right now.\n\n23\n00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.330\nBut places like Adobe, even YouTube and\n\n24\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.420\nFacebook are really helping people out\nthat want to experiment with this, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.320\nSo I'm gonna show you what\nAdobe Premiere can do,\n\n26\n00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.760\nbut you need a little outside help, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.194\nSo if I go to my screen here.\n\n28\n00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:22.789\nI've got a 360 degree project\nalready loaded with media, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.250\nSo I'm gonna go into my project.\n\n30\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.805\nGonna use that key make it real big.\n\n31\n00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:28.710\nAnd I have video.\n\n32\n00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.950\nNow you'll notice I have three, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.510\nTwo of them are called stitched_injected\nand one just says MP4.\n\n34\n00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.125\nI wanted to show real quick that what\nI'm using is I'm using a Samsung.\n\n35\n00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:44.330\nOkay, I'm using a Samsung Gear that I got\nfor free because I bought a phone, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.299\nOtherwise, I wouldn't have a 360\ndegree camera, I'm cheap like that.\n\n37\n00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.000\n&gt;&gt; And we saw that when you were\ngoing over your rig setup with the-\n\n38\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.240\n&gt;&gt; Yep, with the little stock cam,\n\n39\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.373\nit's very-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n40\n00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:52.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's great.\n\n41\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.711\nOkay, so\n\n42\n00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:59.400\nthe great thing about it is I can view it\nin Adobe just in its sort of raw form.\n\n43\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.332\nAnd we call this a dual spherical and\nit will play, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:10.910\nIt will play, but the problem is Adobe\ndoesn't process this type, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.472\nIt doesn't process dual spherical because\nthis is not what we call stitched.\n\n46\n00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:18.400\nIn order to make it 360,\nwe have to stitch it.\n\n47\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.700\nNow, at this time,\nAdobe Premiere doesn't stitch.\n\n48\n00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.255\nBut in the future, it might.\n\n49\n00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:28.387\nThose of you who use something like Skybox\nMetal, Adobe has made great strides to\n\n50\n00:02:28.387 --> 00:02:31.450\npair up with Skybox Metal and\ndo some really neat things.\n\n51\n00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.520\nIn my case, what I've done,\nokay, I have a little side,\n\n52\n00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.280\nfree side Software from\nSamsung called Gear 360 and\n\n53\n00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.700\nit's called action director and\nit stitches it together.\n\n54\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.910\nNow there's all kinds of web\nbased stuff that you can look up\n\n55\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.560\nto help you do a stitch.\n\n56\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.380\nSo it looks like this once it's\nbeen stitched, okay, come on,\n\n57\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.460\ncome on, gimme yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.093\nSee sometimes it does this,\nit's like [SOUND] No.\n\n59\n00:02:58.093 --> 00:03:01.170\nAnd it's doing that because it's a 4K.\n\n60\n00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.350\nOkay?\n\n61\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.700\nIt's 4K and it's stitched.\n\n62\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.180\n&gt;&gt; And let me, if you don't mind\nif I interrupt for just a second.\n\n63\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.053\n&gt;&gt; Please interrupt.\n\n64\n00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:11.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The Skybox, can you just\nelaborate a little bit on what that is?\n\n65\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.560\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n66\n00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.745\nIt is a software, and it's mostly used\nas a plugin within AfterEffects or\n\n67\n00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:20.440\nPremiere, to actually give you\nmanual control of your own stitch.\n\n68\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.230\nAnd I'm gonna show you why a lot\nof people like that later.\n\n69\n00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that's not platform agnostic,\nif you wanna say.\n\n70\n00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.260\nSo it doesn't matter if you have\na Samsung, or whatever type of camera.\n\n71\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.430\n&gt;&gt; No, I know folks that are using\narrays of GoPros, like 9,\n\n72\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.308\n12 GoPros to create their own 360.\n\n73\n00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:41.275\n&gt;&gt; And then the Skybox will have\nstitched it all together for you.\n\n74\n00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:41.950\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n75\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.041\n&gt;&gt; But the software that Samsung,\nwell that came with your device,\n\n76\n00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:46.625\nthat you wanna have to stitched.\n\n77\n00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.348\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So if somebody else had a different\n\n78\n00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:51.660\ntype of 360 camera,\nthey might have specific software.\n\n79\n00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.219\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nAnd this is why this is the wild west.\n\n80\n00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean there's no standard yet,\n\n81\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.320\nwhich is kind of fun and\nkind of frustrating at the same time.\n\n82\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.638\n&gt;&gt; And you're saying that Premiere is\nprobably going to put those preset that we\n\n83\n00:04:03.638 --> 00:04:05.240\nsee for all the different cameras.\n\n84\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.056\nEventually-\n&gt;&gt; Eventually.\n\n85\n00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:08.968\n&gt;&gt; Kind of finds the, cuz right\nnow there's really, like you said,\n\n86\n00:04:08.968 --> 00:04:12.050\nthere's no standard, this is what\nevery single camera is gonna use.\n\n87\n00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.630\nThey're all kind of device specific.\n\n88\n00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.706\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nBecause there's so\n\n89\n00:04:14.706 --> 00:04:17.237\nmany different types of camera\narrays that you can use.\n\n90\n00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:19.006\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; So right now I'm just using a simple,\n\n91\n00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:19.740\nconsumer-based.\n\n92\n00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.030\nIt's two low cameras in a capsule and\nit's easily stitched.\n\n93\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.116\nNow, you'll notice when I clicked the one\nthat just said stitched injected,\n\n94\n00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:32.366\nit was kinda like [NOISE] and\nthat's because I made a proxy, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:36.860\nAnd this is what\nan equirectangular looks like.\n\n96\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.160\nOnce it's stitched this is\ncalled equirectangular.\n\n97\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.720\nAnd it looks like this, okay?\n\n98\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.250\nAnd this is what Adobe can work with.\n\n99\n00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.540\nI'm gonna show you how it works.\n\n100\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.864\nNow you're saying, that full resolution,\n\n101\n00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:54.770\nhow am I gonna work that because\nthat is a huge three, look at that.\n\n102\n00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.553\nThat's full 4K, okay, by 1920.\n\n103\n00:04:58.553 --> 00:05:00.886\nWell full 4K for what we're doing.\n\n104\n00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:05.503\nSo you're saying that might tax a system\nwith low RAM and stuff like that, so\n\n105\n00:05:05.503 --> 00:05:06.306\nwhat do I do?\n\n106\n00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.514\nProxy.\nAnd you're saying, but\n\n107\n00:05:08.514 --> 00:05:12.003\nhow do I get these two to\nbe proxies of each other?\n\n108\n00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:15.590\nYou did that last time on the ingest.\n\n109\n00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.220\nI did do it last time on the ingest but\nwatch what Adobe does for you.\n\n110\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.050\nI can click on it, control click and\n\n111\n00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.160\nsay, proxy, I need you to attach\nsome proxies that I've made.\n\n112\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.570\nAnd then I will say it simply\ngrabs that file and says attach.\n\n113\n00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.600\nAnd then it says I found this proxy in\nthis folder, is that the one to attach?\n\n114\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.127\nAnd I will say yes, please do that.\n\n115\n00:05:38.127 --> 00:05:41.080\n&gt;&gt; So it's just confirming\nthe connection between the two, and\n\n116\n00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.598\nyou're manually saying,\nbe with this right here.\n\n117\n00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:47.826\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and Adobe's done\na good job of doing something like\n\n118\n00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:52.230\nthis where I can now say go here and\nsay let me see my proxy, okay?\n\n119\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.940\nLet me allow to use proxies, Click OK.\n\n120\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.910\nAnd yeah, I can now go back and\n\n121\n00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.830\nforth between proxy, non proxy,\neven though it's 360.\n\n122\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.780\nThe other thing I can do is click on\nthe button editor and there's this.\n\n123\n00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.772\nIt says toggle VR video display.\n\n124\n00:06:10.772 --> 00:06:13.073\nI'm gonna put this down here, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:14.050\nJust like we've done before.\n\n126\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.100\nWe did that with multicam, so\nwe can do the multicam view.\n\n127\n00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.980\nClick OK, and then when I click it,\nI should be able to get my VR view.\n\n128\n00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.010\nNo, sometimes this gets\na little twitchy on this side.\n\n129\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.960\nSo we're gonna put it in a sequence, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.440\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nput this in a sequence.\n\n131\n00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.450\nAnd it will do the,\n\n132\n00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.180\nif I drag it, and put it over new item,\nit will create a sequence for me.\n\n133\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.370\nBut I wanna show you how you create\na new sequence that is technically VR.\n\n134\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.404\nNow this really isn't VR.\n\n135\n00:06:46.404 --> 00:06:50.940\nOkay, it's 360, but VR is just\neasy to say, because two letters.\n\n136\n00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the same thing.\n\n137\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.197\n&gt;&gt; It's VR.\nOkay, I do that all the time, it's VR.\n\n138\n00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:59.690\nAlright so you'll notice,\nwe were talking about presets.\n\n139\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.918\nThere's a bunch of them right there.\n\n140\n00:07:02.918 --> 00:07:03.610\nMonoscopic 29.97.\n\n141\n00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.910\nYes, there's a stereoscopic because\nthere's some people doing 360 in 3D,\n\n142\n00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.155\nwhich is really weird and\nI applaud them because I can't do that.\n\n143\n00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:16.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I can do this with ambisonics.\n\n144\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.670\nNow, ambisonics means 360 degree sound.\n\n145\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:24.490\nI've given you 360 degree recording\nthat you get to play around with.\n\n146\n00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.880\nNot only that, it tells you some things.\n\n147\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.770\nFor editing files, make sure you do this.\n\n148\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.340\nNote within the audio preferences, ensure\nthat multichannel mono media default audio\n\n149\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.250\ntrack option is set to adapt it,\nwhich I did at the beginning and\n\n150\n00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.112\nI'll show you where I set that.\n\n151\n00:07:40.112 --> 00:07:43.380\nAll right, now under tracks,\nI'm gonna add a fourth.\n\n152\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.380\nAnd it's gonna be adaptive.\n\n153\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:46.983\nIt's gonna be multi-channel.\n\n154\n00:07:46.983 --> 00:07:50.425\nI'm actually gonna back\nit off to just one track.\n\n155\n00:07:50.425 --> 00:07:53.152\n&gt;&gt; Just really quick,\nwhy are we adding a fourth channel?\n\n156\n00:07:53.152 --> 00:07:57.002\nBecause technically when I recorded it,\nthere are four channels.\n\n157\n00:07:57.002 --> 00:08:00.826\n&gt;&gt; So you're matching what you captured\nwith what you are going to be doing in\n\n158\n00:08:00.826 --> 00:08:02.440\nthis project or the sequence.\n\n159\n00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, and what I want it to do is,\nI need it to adaptive on the output,\n\n160\n00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.550\nas in you're only gonna see one, okay.\n\n161\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.960\nWhen you're working within the sequence,\nyou're only gonna see one track.\n\n162\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.240\nBut on the output,\nI need it to go to four.\n\n163\n00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.840\nAnd it adapts to that in the output so\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n164\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.360\nSo Adobe came up with\nthis adaptive output.\n\n165\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.300\nI'll be honest with you, I've been\nworking for Adobe for a long time.\n\n166\n00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.000\nI don't fully understand adaptive.\n\n167\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000\nIf anybody fully understands it,\ntalk to them for hours,\n\n168\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.020\ncuz I've done that, and then I go.\n\n169\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.720\n&gt;&gt; I still don't know what it is [LAUGH].\n\n170\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.460\n&gt;&gt; You're a genius.\n\n171\n00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.500\nCuz I've grasped enough to make it work.\n\n172\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.940\nBut I don't, I can't remap and\ndo all that, okay, I cut story.\n\n173\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've had this concept.\n\n174\n00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:48.100\nYeah, there's concepts where you're just\nlike, great, I've got 50% of that maybe.\n\n175\n00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.180\n&gt;&gt; It's like, you're amazing [LAUGH].\n\n176\n00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.540\n&gt;&gt; And that's all I've got,\nbut I'll keep on going.\n\n177\n00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.470\nSo, hand wave [LAUGH].\n\n178\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.973\n&gt;&gt; Hand wave.\n\n179\n00:08:52.973 --> 00:08:56.273\nSo I'm just gonna click on it and\nname it 360.\n\n180\n00:08:56.273 --> 00:09:00.300\nLet me I'm just going to zoom back\na little bit so we can all see it.\n\n181\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.610\nName it 360, I mean I'm keeping\nthe naming thing really easy today.\n\n182\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.130\nAnd click okay, all right so\nthere's my sequence.\n\n183\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:15.720\nNow, all I really got to do is,\nI'm going to move this one to video one.\n\n184\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.610\nAnd it looks we're rectangular.\n\n185\n00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.840\nI've already put the toggle\nVR video display here, boom.\n\n186\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.120\nOn the sequence side, what it does is\nit says okay, you can view it now.\n\n187\n00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.430\nGonna squeeze this down a little bit.\n\n188\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.070\nThere it is, okay.\n\n189\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.888\nAnd what I can do is this.\n\n190\n00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:36.960\nWhoo, Look at that.\n\n191\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.620\nSo that's 360 degrees, up, down.\n\n192\n00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.910\nNow see that dot?\n\n193\n00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.610\nThat's the stitch point.\n\n194\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.960\nThat's where the two\ncameras stitched together.\n\n195\n00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.020\nAnd the Samsung Gear Action Director,\nwhich you get for free, does a good job of\n\n196\n00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.424\nstitching, but with Metal Sky Box I could\ngo in there and fine tune the stitch.\n\n197\n00:09:58.424 --> 00:09:59.478\n&gt;&gt; You could move that sphere down?\n\n198\n00:09:59.478 --> 00:10:02.735\n&gt;&gt; Right, you can move the sphere down and\nall this.\n\n199\n00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:06.410\nAnd then when you work with things like\nthat, there's the recorder I used.\n\n200\n00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.970\nI put the camera right above\nthe recorder and there's the dot and\n\n201\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.120\nsome stitch points right there, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.550\nSo that's where I am.\n\n203\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.160\nI'm just gonna set that to 0,\nand I'm gonna set this one to 0.\n\n204\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.740\nCool, and I have a 360 degree video.\n\n205\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:24.050\nNow, could I have used the audio that\nwas like straight off of the camera?\n\n206\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.550\nAbsolutely I could have.\n\n207\n00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:30.427\nAnd then when I was done,\nI could have just gone export, media.\n\n208\n00:10:30.427 --> 00:10:32.900\nCould have just done that.\n\n209\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.670\nIt's gonna take a second,\n\n210\n00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.620\nand you're saying,\nwell how hard is it to export your video?\n\n211\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.770\nIt's this hard, in the video tab,\nyou just put video is VR.\n\n212\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:48.040\n&gt;&gt; That's checked off because of the way\nwe set up the sequence to begin with.\n\n213\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.610\n&gt;&gt; Hey, is it YouTube?\n\n214\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.560\nYeah, I could You do YouTube I\ncould do YouTube 4k, It's like.\n\n215\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.798\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty easy.\n\n216\n00:10:55.798 --> 00:10:57.990\n&gt;&gt; It's easy, Adobe's made it very easy so\n\n217\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.260\nyou can send this up to\nyour YouTube account.\n\n218\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.920\nOr you could send it to a phone and\nthen watch it on your phone or\n\n219\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.580\nyou could do it in\nthe Oculus Rift all of that.\n\n220\n00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.870\nNow what I've done to make life your\nmiserable is I've added 360 degree sound.\n\n221\n00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.830\nOkay, and that's the thing, it's all fun\nand games until audio gets involved.\n\n222\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna click\n\n223\n00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.720\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna drag this,\n\n224\n00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.920\nit's gonna be a little out of sync today.\n\n225\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.470\nOkay?\n\n226\n00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.580\nBut I wonder if I can do this?\n\n227\n00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:28.130\nI wonder if I highlight them and\ncontrol click, let me see something.\n\n228\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.830\nLet me see something.\n\n229\n00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.380\nUsually, sometimes,\nthere's a way to put things into sync.\n\n230\n00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:39.280\nSometimes, ooh, synchronize and\nI'll say synchronize by audio.\n\n231\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:45.400\nI don't have that,\nbecause I didn't put in the other audio.\n\n232\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.550\nSo, it will,\nremember when I did that merge before?\n\n233\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.850\nRemember when I did that merge before?\n\n234\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.660\n&gt;&gt; In the other episodes?\n\n235\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, And I did it on that side.\n\n236\n00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.470\nYou can do a synchronize, so\nif I brought over the audio with this one,\n\n237\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.730\nI could have just said,\nsynchronize it in the.\n\n238\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.700\n&gt;&gt; The audio within a video\ncamera that you captured.\n\n239\n00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nI decided not to do that today,\n\n240\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.185\nI want to listen to go a little quicker.\n\n241\n00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:07.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I do, I do,\n\n242\n00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:12.040\nI want to go a little quicker and here's\nthe thing that really trips people up, and\n\n243\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.030\nI don't blame them.\n\n244\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.590\nIt's trip me up several times,\n\n245\n00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.040\ncuz it's the Wild West,\nI'm gonna hit play, ramp the audio.\n\n246\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.130\nYeah, you gotta use the binauralizer.\n\n247\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.900\nSo yeah, you have to use the binauralizer.\n\n248\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.395\nI am going to go to the audio track mixer,\nand\n\n249\n00:12:37.395 --> 00:12:42.310\non the master output,\nup at the top, I can add effects.\n\n250\n00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.130\nI'm going to add something\ncalled the binauralizer.\n\n251\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.870\nNow, I can't, where is it, where is it?\n\n252\n00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.990\nIt's special.\n\n253\n00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.200\nOkay, and everybody says,\nwhat is a bineuralizer,\n\n254\n00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.900\nthat sounds like a weapon from\na Sci-Fi original movie or something.\n\n255\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.070\n&gt;&gt; It definitely does.\n\n256\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.180\n&gt;&gt; I know, Usually,\nwe used to call it bineural sound.\n\n257\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.820\nOkay, and it was one of the first\nmicrophones, it was made,\n\n258\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.358\nlooked like a mannequin head.\n\n259\n00:13:02.358 --> 00:13:07.590\nWith ear holes drilled into it and\nthen microphones on the inside.\n\n260\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.860\nIt was to simulate how we hear,\nwe hear in binaural sound.\n\n261\n00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.930\nAnd these are incredibly expensive\nmicrophones and they were mostly used for\n\n262\n00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.820\nlike nature recordings, for\nyou to put on your headphones and\n\n263\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.510\nfeel like you're in nature.\n\n264\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.918\nAnd they were great, but\nthey were incredibly impractical.\n\n265\n00:13:21.918 --> 00:13:25.230\nSo now ambisonic microphones\ndo the same thing, but\n\n266\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.730\nthey're shaped like a microphone,\nand they stitch on a planer scale,\n\n267\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:33.020\nit's weird it's math, if you're into it,\nnumerous articles that explain it.\n\n268\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.200\nSo we call it ambisonic sound now, but\n\n269\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.002\nwhen we're listening to\nit we call it binaural.\n\n270\n00:13:39.002 --> 00:13:41.235\nAll we're doing right now\nis just monitoring it.\n\n271\n00:13:41.235 --> 00:13:46.366\n[SOUND] And I need headphones.\n\n272\n00:13:46.366 --> 00:13:48.690\nYou can't do this without headphones.\n\n273\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.800\n&gt;&gt; Because with the headphones\n\n274\n00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.140\nyou can actually hear it really\npanning through your ears.\n\n275\n00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.520\n&gt;&gt; You can actually hear it going around.\n\n276\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n277\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Now, here's what disturbs people.\n\n278\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.020\nThis is just for like monitoring it, okay?\n\n279\n00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.530\nThis is just for monitoring it.\n\n280\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:09.410\nSo when I eventually export it\nI turn off the bineuralizer.\n\n281\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.900\nAnd people say what if you change things?\n\n282\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.610\nThis is where it gets weird.\n\n283\n00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.380\nThe bineuralizer is for proper monitoring.\n\n284\n00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.470\nWhen I want to actually affect the image,\nokay?\n\n285\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:26.800\nI come down to effects, and the\nbineuralizer is on the master track, okay?\n\n286\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.240\nI type in the word Panner,\nP-A-N-N-E-R, okay?\n\n287\n00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.290\nAnd I get something\ncalled Panner Ambisonics.\n\n288\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:41.460\nI drag that onto the actual segment, okay?\n\n289\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.086\nAnd then I go to my effects controls.\n\n290\n00:14:43.086 --> 00:14:47.330\nOkay, let me highlight it.\n\n291\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.040\nThere it is, and there's the panner.\n\n292\n00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:56.220\nAnd essentially, what I can do with\nthe panner is I can activate these and\n\n293\n00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.890\nadjust, down here, the actual space.\n\n294\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.210\nI'm gonna take that off, okay?\n\n295\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.040\nI'm gonna take,\nI'm not gonna key frame it.\n\n296\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.170\nCan you key frame this?\n\n297\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.970\nYes.\n\n298\n00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.720\n&gt;&gt; Because that's when we activate it and\n\n299\n00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.530\nthen it makes the key frames\nas you move it and drag it.\n\n300\n00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.300\n&gt;&gt; You can key frame\nanimate the whole thing.\n\n301\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.610\nLike for where everything is, and it's-\n&gt;&gt; We follow the sound of\n\n302\n00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.280\nwhere it's going within the recording.\n\n303\n00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:19.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay.\n\n304\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.340\n&gt;&gt; So watch, and you can hear.\n\n305\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:28.190\n&gt;&gt; One second, all right, so\nwe are locked and walking around.\n\n306\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.550\n&gt;&gt; So there I am, you can kind of hear it.\n\n307\n00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.170\nLike I said, you really need headphones,\nand then it's-\n\n308\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's slight.\n\n309\n00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.010\nI can hear just a little bit.\n\n310\n00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.050\n&gt;&gt; And then there's tilt, and\nthen you have item called roll.\n\n311\n00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.390\nSo this gets weird.\n\n312\n00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.830\nAnd what you're kind of doing\nright now is eyeballing.\n\n313\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.595\nI've got to eyeball where I'm standing,\njust sort of pan it there.\n\n314\n00:15:48.595 --> 00:15:51.065\n&gt;&gt; See where it,\nkind of following in the video.\n\n315\n00:15:51.065 --> 00:15:53.142\n&gt;&gt; See where it kind of falls,\nall of that.\n\n316\n00:15:53.142 --> 00:16:00.749\nThen I can do, then what I gotta do,\nI gotta remember is to turn off.\n\n317\n00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:06.034\nI'm gonna say turn off the binauralizer,\nthen when we do the export, okay.\n\n318\n00:16:06.034 --> 00:16:08.599\nExport, Media it is VR, okay,\n\n319\n00:16:08.599 --> 00:16:14.500\nit's doing a quick render under audio\nI've got to check a lot of setting.\n\n320\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.180\nOkay, that's coming up, yep ambisonics\naudio is ambisonic all of it,\n\n321\n00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.958\nit's rendering cuz I used the full thing.\n\n322\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:22.801\nYeah, I can click.\n\n323\n00:16:22.801 --> 00:16:25.326\n&gt;&gt; That's why the options not available\nright now cuz it's rendering in\n\n324\n00:16:25.326 --> 00:16:25.977\nthe background.\n\n325\n00:16:25.977 --> 00:16:26.661\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it's taking, yeah it's upset.\n\n326\n00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:30.891\nSo, yeah it's upset and I hit export and\nI didn't want to do that.\n\n327\n00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:33.023\nBut I can move this out of the way.\n\n328\n00:16:33.023 --> 00:16:36.818\nBasically all you're really doing,\nyeah don't encode, okay stop, good,\n\n329\n00:16:36.818 --> 00:16:37.745\nall right, yeah.\n\n330\n00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:40.115\nI hit the button join let them go.\n\n331\n00:16:40.115 --> 00:16:44.857\nOkay, so yeah, audio is ambisonic all\nthis you click that it knows it's\n\n332\n00:16:44.857 --> 00:16:48.295\nambisonic out goes everything\nis absolutely fine.\n\n333\n00:16:48.295 --> 00:16:55.102\nBut even with it being fine,\nI'm going to go to the intertubes here.\n\n334\n00:16:55.102 --> 00:17:00.575\nYou need to read a lot about\nfirst-order ambisonics and\n\n335\n00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:04.425\nwhat the order of the tracks should be.\n\n336\n00:17:04.425 --> 00:17:08.800\nThis is where most people are like,\nI'm just taking the audio off the camera,\n\n337\n00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.070\nI'm done, I am done.\n\n338\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.242\nBut if you really wanna\nget the little H2N,\n\n339\n00:17:13.242 --> 00:17:16.933\nyou've got to explore\nfirst-order ambisonics,\n\n340\n00:17:16.933 --> 00:17:21.679\nyou've gotta understand how to\nset up all four tracks properly.\n\n341\n00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:26.187\nAnd if you really want to put in\nthat labor it can be a big reward,\n\n342\n00:17:26.187 --> 00:17:31.737\nit can be a big reward for doing some\nreally, really great recording, okay.\n\n343\n00:17:31.737 --> 00:17:36.896\nSo give it a whirl, see if you like it,\nif not then just record the audio\n\n344\n00:17:36.896 --> 00:17:41.630\non the camera and ship it out with\nthe audio on the camera, okay.\n\n345\n00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.235\nIf you want everybody to have\nthat experience you can.\n\n346\n00:17:46.235 --> 00:17:50.315\nThe last thing you can\nalso do if you want, okay.\n\n347\n00:17:50.315 --> 00:17:53.021\nMost times when people do this,\n\n348\n00:17:53.021 --> 00:17:58.846\nthey're like I just wanna have\nthe experience of, I put the things.\n\n349\n00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:03.083\nYou can do what's called VR projection,\nand what that is,\n\n350\n00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:08.696\nis instead of the person just putting\non the glasses and moving around, okay.\n\n351\n00:18:08.696 --> 00:18:15.113\nYou can say I'm going to put\nthat on the video, okay.\n\n352\n00:18:15.113 --> 00:18:19.950\nNow often times I keep hitting the wrong\none, I would say, okay good, yeah, yep.\n\n353\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.163\nSee, I am still, this, I love doing this.\n\n354\n00:18:23.163 --> 00:18:26.548\nI've still have this highlighted and I'm\nhitting the tilde key trying to get back.\n\n355\n00:18:26.548 --> 00:18:27.186\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n356\n00:18:27.186 --> 00:18:29.049\n&gt;&gt; And it's like it still wants,\nand it's like,\n\n357\n00:18:29.049 --> 00:18:30.735\nthe computer telling me you're an idiot.\n\n358\n00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.081\n&gt;&gt; You're in the typing place.\n\n359\n00:18:32.081 --> 00:18:34.531\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, if I go to VR projection and\n\n360\n00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.255\nplace it on the video, okay.\n\n361\n00:18:36.255 --> 00:18:41.141\nNow let me go to effects controls,\nthis is where I can\n\n362\n00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:46.249\nactually control the pen and\ntilt by doing key frames,\n\n363\n00:18:46.249 --> 00:18:51.489\nand when you put on the glasses\nit moves around you.\n\n364\n00:18:51.489 --> 00:18:53.521\n&gt;&gt; So you're sending.\n\n365\n00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:54.342\n&gt;&gt; Instead of me doing this.\n\n366\n00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:55.039\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n367\n00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:57.895\n&gt;&gt; I go there, and\nit starts moving I can still move, but\n\n368\n00:18:57.895 --> 00:19:00.831\nI've directed what the experience\nis supposed to do.\n\n369\n00:19:00.831 --> 00:19:05.335\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I could just be standing straight,\nand it's looking around for me.\n\n370\n00:19:05.335 --> 00:19:09.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if you want to do something\nlike you just, okay, just stand there and\n\n371\n00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.152\nlook, don't move and then stuff happens.\n\n372\n00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:12.778\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n373\n00:19:12.778 --> 00:19:15.302\n&gt;&gt; And then you're like aah,\nor you can kinda sit there and\n\n374\n00:19:15.302 --> 00:19:16.922\nyou can kinda move around a little.\n\n375\n00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:18.666\nYou're projecting the experience for\n\n376\n00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:21.530\nsomeone instead of just placing\nthem there and now look around.\n\n377\n00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.339\n&gt;&gt; And they're the director,\nyou're the director in this one.\n\n378\n00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:27.713\n&gt;&gt; You're the director, and\nagain this can be completely key framed.\n\n379\n00:19:27.713 --> 00:19:30.628\nSo from start to finish you can\nproject where they wanna go.\n\n380\n00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:33.743\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, turn the little guy on make\nyour moves and it makes the key frame.\n\n381\n00:19:33.743 --> 00:19:35.807\n&gt;&gt; Yup, it's just like doing\nkey frames and anything else.\n\n382\n00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.737\nSo 360 is fun but\nagain it is the Wild West,\n\n383\n00:19:38.737 --> 00:19:42.995\nwelcome to Deadwood,\nI mean that's really, really what it is.\n\n384\n00:19:42.995 --> 00:19:44.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n385\n00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:44.818\n&gt;&gt; But it can be fun,\n\n386\n00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:47.640\nand it's one of the most fun things\nright now to just experiment,\n\n387\n00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.990\ncrash it, that didn't work.\n\n388\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.678\nTry it again, crash,\nit didn't work, try it again,\n\n389\n00:19:50.678 --> 00:19:53.207\nread a bunch of stuff on the internet,\ncrash, do it again, crash, do it again.\n\n390\n00:19:53.207 --> 00:19:54.074\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n391\n00:19:54.074 --> 00:19:54.693\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n392\n00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.463\nyou have a lot of stories to tell\nbecause I've been playing with 360 and\n\n393\n00:19:57.463 --> 00:19:59.486\nit's terrible, but\nguess what, it's also great.\n\n394\n00:19:59.486 --> 00:20:01.722\n&gt;&gt;

Time-lapsed kitties in the living room.\n\n9\n00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.123\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n10\n00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:33.828\n[SOUND] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Yes.\n\n11\n00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:38.206\n&gt;&gt; So I hear this is going to be something\nsimilar to what I might know of in\n\n12\n00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:41.620\nPhotoshop, so\nI'm kind of excited about this.\n\n13\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.015\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's interesting because I have\na lot of people that have never done\n\n14\n00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:46.460\ntime-lapse before and\nthey ask me about time-lapse.\n\n15\n00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.317\nMy funniest story was what\nsomebody did was they just shot\n\n16\n00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.764\ntwo hours of footage and slowed it down.\n\n17\n00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:56.363\nAnd then they exported that as a file and\n\n18\n00:00:56.363 --> 00:00:58.068\nthey want to know why the file was so\nhuge.\n\n19\n00:00:58.068 --> 00:01:01.388\nIt's because you're taking a lot\nof media and compressing it down.\n\n20\n00:01:01.388 --> 00:01:03.732\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Time-lapse is actually a series-\n\n21\n00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:05.996\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] sorry, this guy.\n\n22\n00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:08.048\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Time-lapse is actually a series\n\n23\n00:01:08.048 --> 00:01:11.632\nof pictures taken in sequence\nto show time moving forward.\n\n24\n00:01:11.632 --> 00:01:16.780\nSo what you're really doing is,\nsingle pictures in a sequence, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.005\nAnd there's several different types\nof cameras that will do this,\n\n26\n00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:21.597\nthat will give you time-lapse.\n\n27\n00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:25.859\nI just wanna show you the correct method\nof bringing it in because some people do\n\n28\n00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.477\nthat and they see these hundreds,\nsometimes thousands of shots,\n\n29\n00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:32.970\nand they're like, so\nI'm just supposed to import all that?\n\n30\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.883\nNope, there's a different way, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:38.470\n&gt;&gt; So your camera, actually you would\nturn it on to the time-lapse setting-\n\n32\n00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.342\n&gt;&gt; A time-lapse mode.\n\n33\n00:01:39.342 --> 00:01:42.707\n&gt;&gt; And turn it on and it [SOUND]\ntakes a picture for every frame-\n\n34\n00:01:42.707 --> 00:01:43.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.280\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever.\n\n36\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.450\n&gt;&gt; In this case, I did it with a GoPro 2.\n\n37\n00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.410\nI did it with my older GoPro.\n\n38\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.340\nAnd what I was going to do is, what\nI'm trying to do in my garden forever,\n\n39\n00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.300\nwe have a lot of hummingbirds and\nthey're so cute.\n\n40\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.220\nAnd I just put it up there and they never\ncome when the camera's there, never.\n\n41\n00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.660\nSo I decided to just do\none of me driving here.\n\n42\n00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.420\nOkay, it was just easy,\njust put it on my dashboard here it comes.\n\n43\n00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.010\nSo a couple of things.\n\n44\n00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.038\nFirst of all, in Preferences, okay, and\n\n45\n00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:14.089\nwhen we went down into Timeline,\ndo we remember this one where we said,\n\n46\n00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.808\nstill image default duration five seconds,\nokay?\n\n47\n00:02:17.808 --> 00:02:22.717\nNow believe it or not, for\ntime-lapse you don't need to worry about\n\n48\n00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:27.620\nthis if you do the method that\nI'm going to show you, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.172\nRight now, let's just leave it that\neverything I bring in is gonna be\n\n50\n00:02:30.172 --> 00:02:30.750\nfive seconds.\n\n51\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.378\nClick OK, I'm going to come over here,\n\n52\n00:02:34.378 --> 00:02:38.551\nI'm gonna come to the media browser,\nright?\n\n53\n00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:42.278\nAnd let's see, I have time-lapse.\n\n54\n00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:45.910\nAnd here they are,\nthey're just a ton of jpegs.\n\n55\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.265\nAnd you're probably saying, all right.\n\n56\n00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:54.870\nSo I'm just supposed to highlight\nall of these and drag them all in.\n\n57\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.928\nFirst thing with that is that means\nthey're all five seconds long, okay.\n\n58\n00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.883\nSo I need to change it to one second or\nwhatever and\n\n59\n00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:07.905\nthen I've got all these files and\nit's like, man, no.\n\n60\n00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:09.313\nBelieve it or not,\n\n61\n00:03:09.313 --> 00:03:15.860\nthis is one of the only times we're not\nactually going to use the media browser.\n\n62\n00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.472\nWe're gonna use a good\nold-fashioned import.\n\n63\n00:03:19.472 --> 00:03:26.870\nI just Ctrl-Click, hit Import, and we're\ngoing out to the actual finder, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.900\nAnd here's why.\n\n65\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.880\nI'm gonna go to the Desktop\n&gt;

For me.\nIf this wasn't, then I would have to go\n\n82\n00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:23.934\nand name them numerically all\nthe way down and then I do Import.\n\n83\n00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:27.181\nAnd I get one single file.\n\n84\n00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:34.780\nI'm gonna double-click that,\nAnd there it is.\n\n85\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.115\nAnd I have my time-lapse\nall in one single file.\n\n86\n00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:41.150\nThere's me driving here\nfrom beautiful Georgia.\n\n87\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.080\nAnd I think I took\na picture every 30 seconds.\n\n88\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.770\nThere it is, and it's done.\n\n89\n00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.990\nAnd it's ready and it is happy.\n\n90\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.010\nAnd that's all there is to it.\n\n91\n00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.890\nI had to get gas at one point, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.575\nSo yeah, and then if I take it out into\na sequence, do I wanna make a sequence?\n\n93\n00:04:58.575 --> 00:05:02.160\nYeah, boom, new item,\nthere it is as a sequence.\n\n94\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.973\nBoom, boom, boom, happy times.\n\n95\n00:05:03.973 --> 00:05:06.668\nAnd I could color-correct if I want to,\nbut it's a time-lapse.\n\n96\n00:05:06.668 --> 00:05:07.180\nWhat does it matter?\n\n97\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.807\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so that's essentially how you do\n\n98\n00:05:10.807 --> 00:05:16.447\na proper time-lapse,\nis you don't use the media browser.\n\n99\n00:05:16.447 --> 00:05:19.982\n&gt;&gt; Which it goes against almost\neverything you've been saying so far.\n\n100\n00:05:19.982 --> 00:05:23.610\n&gt;&gt; Goes against everything,\nyou just do a good, old fashioned import.\n\n101\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.380\nAnd in many cases, a lot of people\nstill just use the import protocol for\n\n102\n00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.000\njust stills.\n\n103\n00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.500\nI've gotten used to\nusing the media browser,\n\n104\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.970\nbut if I'm doing a time-lapse,\nI bring it in through the old import.\n\n105\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.340\nI make sure and hit Options, click that\nimage sequence, make sure they're numeric,\n\n106\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.190\nand here's my, it's great.\n\n107\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.037\nIt's phenomenal, and\nI just edit it in and it is great.\n\n108\n00:05:46.037 --> 00:05:54.320\nNow here's something that is interesting\nthat, and again, this is a GoPro.\n\n109\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.910\nSo of course,\nmost of those aren't wide angle, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.220\nI do have the ability to\ndo this with effects.\n\n111\n00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.690\nLet me go find effects, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.352\nBoom, and if I type in GoPro,\nokay, is that GorPo?\n\n113\n00:06:12.352 --> 00:06:12.865\nGorPo.\n\n114\n00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:14.027\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the\n\n115\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.840\n&gt;&gt; It has this thing where Hero 2, what\n\n116\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.290\nthis is meant to do is correct\nwide angle distortion.\n\n117\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.112\nSo this is a Hero 2, yeah,\n\n118\n00:06:32.112 --> 00:06:35.788\ngenerate, and boom!\n\n119\n00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:40.379\nSo there, yeah, it's meant to\ncorrect wide angle distortion.\n\n120\n00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.731\nIf you don't want the wide angle response,\nthere it is.\n\n121\n00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:47.835\nOkay, and\nthey have all the different models,\n\n122\n00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:51.022\nI'm sure they're gonna have even more,\nokay?\n\n123\n00:06:51.022 --> 00:06:54.857\nAnd if you don't like the way it does it\nautomatically, I'm perfectly fine with it,\n\n124\n00:06:54.857 --> 00:06:58.390\nthere's different types of parameters\nto adjust the curvature and all that.\n\n125\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.580\nAnd I can turn it on,\nturn it off, and see what it is.\n\n126\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.198\nAnd there you go.\n\n127\n00:07:02.198 --> 00:07:05.664\n&gt;&gt; Wow, and you can do all those\nsplittings and the trimmings and\n\n128\n00:07:05.664 --> 00:07:08.105\nmove it all around, put in other things.\n\n129\n00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:11.358\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can color-correct this, I can\nedit it, I can do whatever I want to,\n\n130\n00:07:11.358 --> 00:07:12.645\nit just treats it like a clip.\n\n131\n00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:14.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's now a sequence.\n\n132\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.613\n&gt;&gt; Treats it like a clip, it's a sequence,\neverything is just super dandy.\n\n133\n00:07:18.613 --> 00:07:20.946\n&gt;&gt; Wow, and you see this everywhere.\n\n134\n00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:25.294\nI see this all the time in different\ncommercials and any type of video stuff.\n\n135\n00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:27.810\nIt almost seemed too simple.\n\n136\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.966\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It almost seems like, really,\n\n137\n00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:31.600\nis this it?\n\n138\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.820\nYeah, it is.\n\n139\n00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.568\n&gt;&gt; But it's the thought process of,\nno, you got to go to the finder,\n\n140\n00:07:35.568 --> 00:07:36.462\nyou got to make sure.\n\n141\n00:07:36.462 --> 00:07:37.879\n&gt;&gt; Gotta go to the finder,\ngotta make sure.\n\n142\n00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:38.783\nIt's one of those things.\n\n143\n00:07:38.783 --> 00:07:41.895\nRemember your steps,\nremember your little mental checklist.\n\n144\n00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:45.121\nThat's why when you're doing different\nkinds of work, step back and go, okay,\n\n145\n00:07:45.121 --> 00:07:46.780\nI'm going multi-cam now.\n\n146\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.657\nI'm doing this now.\nMental checklist of everything you need,\n\n147\n00:07:49.657 --> 00:07:51.340\nand you'll forget things.\n\n148\n00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.481\nYou will always forget things.\n\n149\n00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:55.190\nThat's why you can always go back and\nredo it.\n\n150\n00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.285\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, wow, that's neat.\n\n151\n00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:58.971\nJust get in this frame of mind.\n\n152\n00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:01.405\nI always tell people just stop,\ntake a breath.\n\n153\n00:08:01.405 --> 00:08:03.459\nWhere are you, what do you wanna do?\n\n154\n00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:06.330\nWhat do I need to do?\n\n155\n00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.507\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; You have to kind of,\n\n156\n00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:10.913\nI tell people this all the time, and\nthen I totally forget it myself.\n\n157\n00:08:10.913 --> 00:08:13.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, everybody's seen it on these\n\n158\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.020\ncameras with me for\nthe past however many lessons, yeah.\n\n159\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.220\nI hope you don't take this wrong,\n\n160\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.662\nit's making me feel really\ngood cuz I do the same thing.\n\n161\n00:08:20.662 --> 00:08:21.240\n&gt;&gt; We all do, we all do.\n\n162\n00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.712\nOnce you get into this and being creative,\nit's like, yeah, I know what's going on.\n\n163\n00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:28.150\nAnd you forget something and\nyou're like, I'm stupid.\n\n164\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.620\nBut it happens.\n\n165\n00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.260\nIt happens all the time.\n\n166\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.830\nAnd own your mistakes.\n\n167\n00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.950\nThe best stories that you\nhave are the mistakes.\n\n168\n00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.565\nYou'll have so much fun with those.\n\n169\n00:08:36.565 --> 00:08:40.206\nI remember this time I told this guy\nsomething that was completely wrong.\n\n170\n00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:40.880\nAnd that was it, that's what happens.\n\n171\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.364\n&gt;&gt;

we're gonna step it up.\n\n14\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.710\nWe are gonna step it up.\n\n15\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.300\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nI feel like I should start doing some\n\n16\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.250\ndance moves that [CROSSTALK].\n\n17\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.438\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that would probably be-\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna see

00:00:49.320\nOkay, so I'm talking about stepping up\ninput and output because there's times you\n\n21\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.300\njust, sometimes just\nmedia browsers great but\n\n22\n00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.580\nsometimes you need to step\nup what you're doing.\n\n23\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.770\nAnd oftentimes getting\nout of Premier Pro and\n\n24\n00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.680\ncombining it with the other\napplications can be a big help.\n\n25\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.200\nSo what am I going to do?\n\n26\n00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.950\nLet's say I want to bring in some\nmedia okay and I've got a camera card.\n\n27\n00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.640\nI'm going to pretend to\nhave a camera card, so\n\n28\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.770\nI am going to go on my computer here.\n\n29\n00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.510\nI'm going to open this up and I'm going to\nsearch for something called Prelude, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.270\nThere it is, Prelude CC 2017.\n\n31\n00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.980\nI'm gonna open it up.\n\n32\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.780\nOkay, can we do that?\n\n33\n00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.110\nYeah, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.840\nAnd of course, it's Adobe so\nthey have to have this crazy\n\n35\n00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.010\nopening screens that are just beautiful\nand it is like never go away.\n\n36\n00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.120\nPlease never go away.\n\n37\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.900\nAnd then it goes away.\n\n38\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.750\n&gt;&gt; And then it always takes a while-\n&gt;&gt; And then it goes away and\n\n39\n00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.580\nit takes forever.\n\n40\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.150\nSo basically, what Prelude is,\nthey had this, yep, we understand.\n\n41\n00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.669\nThey had this before they actually had\nthe Ingest feature in Media Browser.\n\n42\n00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.720\nWhat I can do with this.\n\n43\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.230\nFirst of all,\nI have to create a new project.\n\n44\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.460\nWhy?\nBecause I should be\n\n45\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.930\nable to repeat what I'm doing.\n\n46\n00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.370\nI'm just going to say this is creative\n\n47\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.650\npro tv.\n\n48\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.100\nOf course,\nI can leave it in the default area.\n\n49\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.280\nAnd for today, I'm gonna go ahead and\nleave it in the default area,\n\n50\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.120\nwhich if I expand this,\nthat's gonna be here, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.820\nIn Adobe Prelude this, and\nthat's gonna be in my documents area.\n\n52\n00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.720\nOkay, I'm just gonna leave it there.\n\n53\n00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.080\nA lot of people like doing that,\nI do my own customs.\n\n54\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.340\nPeople see this, it can be very,\nvery extensive with what you do.\n\n55\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.220\nYou can actually make rough cuts in\nthis and ship it over to premier.\n\n56\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.260\nI'm not going to go that deep, if you want\nto go that deep, it's really easy to do.\n\n57\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.800\nI'm going to go to 'Ingest', okay,\nand we remember what ingest is.\n\n58\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.371\nBasically, that means I'm going to take it\noff of a card and put it somewhere else.\n\n59\n00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.200\nAll right, so\nlet me just go very basic here.\n\n60\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.310\nI'm just going to go to the hard drive,\nusers,\n\n61\n00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.520\nhere's the office, go to the desktop.\n\n62\n00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.380\nThere's the stuff that I'm giving you for\nfree.\n\n63\n00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.150\nOkay, here's Columbia, here's the garden.\n\n64\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.740\nWhat don't I have?\n\n65\n00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.700\nI don't have some seymore.\n\n66\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.820\nIn the other one, here is the video.\n\n67\n00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.690\nThere's Seymour.\n\n68\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.810\nHi, Seymour.\n\n69\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.100\nI'm going to take both,\n\n70\n00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.990\nthen what I'm going to say is\ntransfer clips to a destination.\n\n71\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.610\nAnd they'll say where is that destination?\n\n72\n00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.540\nAnd I'll say browse for a location please.\n\n73\n00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.700\nAnd let's just say I'm going to put it\nright now with the actual project, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.470\nActually no, let's not do that,\nthat will be awful for you.\n\n75\n00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.950\nI'm gonna put this in here and\n\n76\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.560\nI'm just gonna put this as examples cuz\nI'm going to get rid of it later, okay?\n\n77\n00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.680\nExamples and I'll get out that folders\nlater, I could add some folder, And\n\n78\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.330\nthat means it's today's date and\nthe time I'm doing this.\n\n79\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.510\nOkay, I'm not going to do that.\n\n80\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.570\nI could add a transcode.\n\n81\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.910\nAs in to say, hey,\nright now this is Httpcore, but\n\n82\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.570\nI could say make it Quicktime and, you\nknow, do Cineform or something like that.\n\n83\n00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.585\nSome of you who are big users\nmay say that where's ProRes.\n\n84\n00:04:05.402 --> 00:04:08.960\nWe're gonna get to that, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.360\nI'm gonna cancel for now,\nI don't wanna transcode,\n\n86\n00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.280\nbut then there's this then, yeah,\nyou could do a verify if you want.\n\n87\n00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.410\nIf there's any metadata that get's lost or\nit tells you,\n\n88\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.760\nI didn't take this minute out, cuz you\ndon't need it, it'll tell you that.\n\n89\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.220\nI can add another destination.\n\n90\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.650\nNow, why would I wanna do that Maybe,\nVonne, you and\n\n91\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.370\nI are going to end up using\nthe same media off the camera card.\n\n92\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.380\nAnd I could say not only do I\nwant this to go to my computer,\n\n93\n00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.920\nI want it to go up to the Dropbox you and\nI are sharing.\n\n94\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.420\nOr, I want to make an immediate\nback-up to another drive.\n\n95\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.030\nOr if you're a guy like me, you wanna\nmake three backups immediately to three\n\n96\n00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.870\ndifferent drives, one up in the cloud,\nall of this, and it allows me to do that.\n\n97\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.350\nThe reason it saves as a project is I\ncan just open it as a project again and\n\n98\n00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.480\nall my destinations are set.\n\n99\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.630\nAnd I just pop in a card and\ntell it go here.\n\n100\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.740\nAnd if I use the subfolders\nevery time I pop in a new card,\n\n101\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.530\nit's the day and date that I shot it.\n\n102\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.720\nSo if you're doing anything time-sensitive\nthat's most like kind of a documentary,\n\n103\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.980\nyou wanna remember where you, you know,\nwhere you shot it and when you shot it.\n\n104\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.930\nOr when you actually captured it or\nI could put in when I shot it.\n\n105\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.520\nIt's almost setting up like a template for\n\n106\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.920\nall the stuff that you're\ngonna be bringing in.\n\n107\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.030\nAnd I can see why you definitely wanna do\nmultiple destinations, cuz you're probably\n\n108\n00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.410\nworking in project, or even just like\nyou're saying, a backup, that's, you know?\n\n109\n00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.209\n&gt;&gt; A lot of people like me who were and\nstill are a little obsessed with bridge.\n\n110\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.520\n&gt;&gt; Are very much obsessed with Prelude.\n\n111\n00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.660\n&gt;&gt; I love bridge.\n\n112\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.400\n&gt;&gt; I love bridge too.\n\n113\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.550\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the thing and\n\n114\n00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.710\nfor video Prelude can be great\nbecause I just pop it in,\n\n115\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.730\nI type in all my numbers real quick, grab\nmy media and this is all I'm going to do.\n\n116\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.928\n&gt;&gt; This is also kind of\nreminding me of Light Room.\n\n117\n00:05:56.928 --> 00:06:00.060\n&gt;&gt; For Photoshop, it's similar.\n\n118\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.360\n&gt;&gt; That's the thing is notice it\ndidn't used to have this before.\n\n119\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.710\nBut notice I'm getting it from something\nthat looks similar to the media browser.\n\n120\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.280\nSo there's a coordinated\nsort of effort here.\n\n121\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.270\nWhen you go from one to another\nthere's familiarities and\n\n122\n00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.570\nyou can figure it out pretty fast,\nso there's an injust.\n\n123\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.450\nOne of the reasons I also do this is\nbecause it goes in the background,\n\n124\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.370\nand it's done.\n\n125\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.070\nAnd it's done.\n\n126\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.280\nNow, I still have to\nimport that into Premiere.\n\n127\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.860\nAnd I can do that through\nthe Media Browser, or\n\n128\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.880\nthere's a protocol\nwithin that I could use.\n\n129\n00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.970\nBut I prefer to use [INAUDIBLE]\nso I've stepped up my input.\n\n130\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.440\nI've input some media and then I can\ngo get it whenever I want, all right?\n\n131\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.750\nAnd again it's project based.\n\n132\n00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.810\nSo all I have to do is open it up,\ndrop in another card, and\n\n133\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.370\nit goes to all the same destinations.\n\n134\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.120\nIt really helps me with my workflow\nin that I can just pop in a card.\n\n135\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.630\nIt goes to all the destinations,\nall the right folders.\n\n136\n00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.440\nI import it and I just go to work.\n\n137\n00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.460\n&gt;&gt; And I mean, this is something\nif you're doing a lot of footage.\n\n138\n00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.090\nI mean, you pop it in, you go to lunch,\nyou go back, but it's at least doing all\n\n139\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.800\nof that in the background for\nyou, and you can keep on going.\n\n140\n00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's also one of those\nthings where it's like somebody might say,\n\n141\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.490\nwell, we wanna keep the footage.\n\n142\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.200\nAnd this isn't like you shot something for\na plan,\n\n143\n00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.580\nthis gets into a lot of illegal that if\nyou wanna do this, you need to explore.\n\n144\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.800\nI'm saying somebody that company's says,\n\n145\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.890\nwell, can we keep that some of that files\nsomewhere else in case we need to archive?\n\n146\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.270\nYou can create an immediate archive doing\nthis, instead of having do it there, and\n\n147\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.740\nthen go back and say, all right, now,\n\n148\n00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.870\nI came along this,\nyou can start an archive with this.\n\n149\n00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.350\n&gt;&gt; That can be super helpful.\n\n150\n00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can be very, very helpful,\n\n151\n00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.330\ncuz you just wanna get it\n&gt;&gt; And edit.\n\n152\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.620\nNow output, output's where it get really,\nreally fun.\n\n153\n00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.260\nI have created, first of all,\n\n154\n00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.710\nthis is a little cleanup thing,\nthat most people don't know about.\n\n155\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.936\nI've created two sequences,\nI have the 360 sequence, and\n\n156\n00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.032\nI have the Columbia sequence.\n\n157\n00:07:51.032 --> 00:07:56.187\nAnd let's say that's all I'm ever gonna\nuse in this particular project, okay.\n\n158\n00:07:56.187 --> 00:07:59.607\nSo I'm going to come up to file, and\n\n159\n00:07:59.607 --> 00:08:04.490\nthese project settings I\nhave a project manager.\n\n160\n00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.870\nUnder edit I have a thing\ncalled remove unused.\n\n161\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:20.520\nIf I didn't use it in a sequence It\nhas been essentially removed, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:26.930\nYou didn't use it, it's gone and\nI removed it and that is pretty great.\n\n163\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.350\nIt's just remove unused.\n\n164\n00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.660\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I love this feature.\n\n165\n00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.410\nI've seen it in some other programs for\njust like you might have a massive\n\n166\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.600\nlist of things over there in your project\npanel, but it's like I don't remember.\n\n167\n00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.940\nDid I use it, did I not use it?\n\n168\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.940\nIt's like one command just poof gone.\n\n169\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's poof done.\n\n171\n00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Poof, amazing.\n\n172\n00:08:47.385 --> 00:08:50.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That way you sorta keep it clean.\n\n173\n00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.700\nCuz I've seen people with hundreds and\nhundreds of files.\n\n174\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.310\nIt's like, how many are you using?\n\n175\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.430\nIt's like 20?\n\n176\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.425\nIt's like do remove on use and\njust get rid of it.\n\n177\n00:08:57.425 --> 00:08:59.860\nNow, it's not erased, it's not gone.\n\n178\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.260\nIt's just the media is still there,\nthe metadata just goes poof.\n\n179\n00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.740\nIt's like, I don't need all this metadata,\nI don't need all these clips, poof.\n\n180\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.030\nAnother one is this,\nlet's say you want this sequence.\n\n181\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.030\nThis Columbia sequence, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.340\nFirst of all, I'm going to highlight it.\n\n183\n00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.300\nYou know, find it for me in there.\n\n184\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.150\nBoom, opens it up, there it is.\n\n185\n00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.140\nAnd you want this sequence.\n\n186\n00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.330\nAnd we're ike, whoa, I don't, hm.\n\n187\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.460\nThere's a thing in here\ncalled the Project Manager.\n\n188\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.160\nIf I click on the Project Manager,\nit's gonna say, okay,\n\n189\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.800\nyou got two sequences, which one?\n\n190\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.910\nAnd I say, Columbia.\n\n191\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.840\nGreat.\n\n192\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.100\nAnd it will say, collect the files and\ncopy to a new location.\n\n193\n00:09:51.294 --> 00:09:53.380\n&gt;&gt; This is packaged.\n\n194\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.350\n&gt;&gt; It's similar to packaging, but\nbecause we use edit langauge, what\n\n195\n00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.940\neditors are familiar with, this is collect\nthem and move them to a new location.\n\n196\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.080\nAnd I'll say fine,\nthat's what I want to do.\n\n197\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.450\nDo I want to exclude unused clips?\n\n198\n00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.080\nYeah, I didn't use them.\n\n199\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.790\nAny audio conform files?\n\n200\n00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.550\nYes, preview files.\n\n201\n00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.900\nThose are renders, and you might say, I\ndon't want your renders, I'll renounce it.\n\n202\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.480\nNow, here's an interesting thing.\n\n203\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.944\nRename the media files\nto match the clip names.\n\n204\n00:10:20.944 --> 00:10:21.798\nSo, if I name this like boat.\n\n205\n00:10:21.798 --> 00:10:25.570\nBoat with dog.\n\n206\n00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.675\nThe media is still named 001, 002, 003.\n\n207\n00:10:26.675 --> 00:10:30.085\nI could give the option to say, I tell you\nwhat, I'll just rename them so you know\n\n208\n00:10:30.085 --> 00:10:34.220\nwhat they are, and the media files will be\nthe exact same names of the clip names.\n\n209\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:40.200\nI know some people, what they do is they\ndo a collect and move, and the only option\n\n210\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.360\nthey choose is rename the media files to\nmatch the clip names, and here's why.\n\n211\n00:10:47.694 --> 00:10:50.750\nWhat this will do is this\nwill shift out of sequence.\n\n212\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.800\nYou'll get a sequence,\nyou'll be to import it have a lean in, and\n\n213\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.790\nyou'll have basically a new project.\n\n214\n00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.030\nAnd it's all tightly packaged without\nhaving to do drag and drops and\n\n215\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.830\nall that weirdness, okay.\n\n216\n00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.370\nYes, there's a transcode,\nconsolidate and transcode feature,\n\n217\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.110\nif you want to kick it up,\nkick everything up to a higher resolution.\n\n218\n00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.005\nThat was one of the cases of\nremember I didn't have everything,\n\n219\n00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:14.570\nif I didn't have everything in\nmulticam for the same frame rate and\n\n220\n00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.270\nall that, I could try it with this.\n\n221\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:21.920\nI could also do with\nsomething I'm gonna do later.\n\n222\n00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.640\nSo basically, what was I gonna do?\n\n223\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.315\nI'm just talking my face off.\n\n224\n00:11:25.315 --> 00:11:25.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, we were.\n\n225\n00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\nLet me show you something.\n\n226\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.800\n&gt;&gt; Why would you want to do that one\noption of renaming the files in the-\n\n227\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, so let me show you this.\n\n228\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:39.800\nLet me say I decide that I'm going\nto name this one just boat, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.470\nEverything's fine.\n\n230\n00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.600\nNow, I'm going to do a reveal in finder.\n\n231\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.430\nControl click, I just get to talking and\nhaving so much fun.\n\n232\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.060\n&gt;&gt; I called it package,\nbecause I saw any design [CROSSTALK].\n\n233\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.880\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, it's cool.\n\n234\n00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.200\nSo I'm gonna find my revealing finder.\n\n235\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.440\nBoom, I've revealed it.\n\n236\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.630\nAnd I've decided, you know what,\nI'm gonna name this boat2.\n\n237\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.330\nAnd I do that, cool.\n\n238\n00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:09.820\nAnd it might do, yeah,\nit just did this scary thing.\n\n239\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.380\nIt's like this is offline.\n\n240\n00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.935\nDid you, like, rename it.\n\n241\n00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:16.880\nIt doesn't understand\nthe connection anymore?\n\n242\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.730\n&gt;&gt; The connection has been broken and\nthis is what most people don't understand.\n\n243\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.580\nSo I'm just gonna like go through and\nname my media the same name blahblahbalah.\n\n244\n00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.070\nThe link will get cracked if you move\nthe media or if you rename the media.\n\n245\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.800\nYou can move the metadata in the,\n\n246\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.950\nthis thing, the program window all\nyou want and rename it all you want.\n\n247\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.690\nAnd it still stays, but\nif you do anything to the media,\n\n248\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:45.230\nthen you have to do a relink and a lot of\npeople find it really scary, but it's not.\n\n249\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.940\nWatch this.\n\n250\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.050\nI'm just gonna go control click okay, and\n\n251\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.610\nI'm going to say link media, and\nit will say you're looking for boat.\n\n252\n00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.850\nAnd it used to be here, just like okay and\nI'm going to just say, you know\n\n253\n00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.490\nbased on the file name, file extension,\nI'm gonna say locate this please.\n\n254\n00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:11.910\nAnd it's gonna say okay, it used to be\nhere and that's what the name used to be.\n\n255\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.000\nSo go down this path,\nit's like okay I will go down that path.\n\n256\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:23.682\nI will go to Columbia And\nthere is boat, and I will click boat.\n\n257\n00:13:23.682 --> 00:13:27.860\nAnd I will click OK, and it's re-linked.\n\n258\n00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.950\nNow, if I have a series of files that\nare offline, I can highlight all of them,\n\n259\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.190\nand it will do all in the series.\n\n260\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.080\nIt will do everything in the series.\n\n261\n00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're speaking my language right\nnow, cuz I'm fully going to InDesign and\n\n262\n00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.870\nI know where it's like you're seeing\nit in the design, but it's not\n\n263\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.330\nreally in the design, it's out there, and-\n&gt;&gt; It's out there and, yeah, but\n\n264\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.160\npeople get really really scared.\n\n265\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:58.070\nWhen you get really into this, Linking and\nunlinking media is so much fun.\n\n266\n00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.445\nIt can be so great.\n\n267\n00:13:59.445 --> 00:14:02.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean it's like you're a mad\n\n268\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:02.900\nscientist.\n\n269\n00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:08.430\nOkay, so the last thing I wanna show\nyou is a thing called Media Encoder for\n\n270\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.980\nyour output.\n\n271\n00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.090\nOne of the main reasons I use\nMedia Encoder instead of just\n\n272\n00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:18.340\na flat export It's because if I\nuse a media encoder on the export,\n\n273\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.150\nit works in the background and\nI can keep working.\n\n274\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.890\nAnd I like that because somebody will say\nhey give me that Colombia sequence and\n\n275\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.100\nI need four files.\n\n276\n00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.580\nIt's like, okay, you need four files well,\nwe'll make four files.\n\n277\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:38.020\nSo if you control click it you\nshould find an export media.\n\n278\n00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.710\nAll right, and you recognize this\ndialogue, but down at the bottom,\n\n279\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.040\ninstead of Export, I'm gonna hit Queue.\n\n280\n00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.970\nAnd that's going to\nactivate Media Encoder.\n\n281\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.760\nNow, depending on your system,\nthis could take a little time.\n\n282\n00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.070\nAnd what people do is it opens up, and\nthen they're just like, It's not in there.\n\n283\n00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.580\nI'm not seeing it.\nJust go get a sandwich or something.\n\n284\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.890\nNow we got lucky Here,\nthe GoPro is the last one I did.\n\n285\n00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.570\nAnd I'm just going to go ahead and\ndelete that out.\n\n286\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.100\nOkay, I don't need it.\n\n287\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.050\nNotice there's a media browser.\n\n288\n00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.930\nI don't have to do this\nstraight out of Premiere.\n\n289\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.530\nI could take some files and\ndrag them into the queue.\n\n290\n00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.950\nOkay, I can absolutely drag them\ninto the queue, something like that.\n\n291\n00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.919\nHere are my presets.\n\n292\n00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.880\nOkay, can I get a zoom out?\n\n293\n00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.540\nYeah.\n\n294\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.220\nHere are my presets.\n\n295\n00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.040\nWe have audio only.\n\n296\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.470\nWe have broadcast.\n\n297\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.980\nWe have camera.\n\n298\n00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.330\nWe have cinema.\n\n299\n00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.650\nRaptor DCP, we are not going into that.\n\n300\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.770\nDevices, okay, everybody,\n[LAUGH] a TiVo, a Nook.\n\n301\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.130\nYou can create all kinds of preset files.\n\n302\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.820\nDVD and Blu-ray, they're still doing that.\n\n303\n00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.500\nYou can make an image sequence, okay?\n\n304\n00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.970\nYou add some images, make a sequence.\n\n305\n00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:53.795\nVR, already there, look at that,\nmonoscopic for delivery.\n\n306\n00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:58.335\nWeb video, YouTube, okay,\nthere's your 2K for YouTube.\n\n307\n00:15:58.335 --> 00:16:00.693\nHere's Vimeo, here's all these things.\n\n308\n00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.862\nTwitter, they have one for Twitter now.\n\n309\n00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:08.560\nThey have ones for Facebook, it's amazing.\n\n310\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.590\nSo, you might say I need a Facebook,\nI need a etc

and\noff it goes.\n\n321\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.040\n&gt;&gt; Another one of those super time savers.\n\n322\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.830\n&gt;&gt; Not really hard to do just go ahead and\n\n323\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.272\nthrow it in there and que it up and-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n324\n00:16:59.272 --> 00:17:02.297\n&gt;&gt; Those of you who remember the 70's, but\n\n325\n00:17:02.297 --> 00:17:04.320\nwait, there's more okay?\n\n326\n00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:13.045\nSo I got some really cool options down\nhere in the preset browser, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:17.305\nNotice these are sort\nof interesting symbols,\n\n328\n00:17:17.305 --> 00:17:22.135\ncreate new preset, create new preset\ngroup, import presets, export presets.\n\n329\n00:17:22.135 --> 00:17:27.057\nI'm gonna create a new group and\nI'm gonna say, say everyday.\n\n330\n00:17:30.877 --> 00:17:36.477\nAnd instead of having to drag all four of\nthose things, what I'm gonna do is this.\n\n331\n00:17:36.477 --> 00:17:40.527\nI'll say all right,\nI need that nook in there.\n\n332\n00:17:40.527 --> 00:17:41.537\nAnd I need this

00:17:50.530\nIt's just an alias and\nI think everybody understands Alias so\n\n336\n00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.998\nI'm not gonna explain it, boom.\n\n337\n00:17:51.998 --> 00:17:56.032\nAnd Twitter, boom, and the YouTube,\n\n338\n00:17:56.032 --> 00:17:59.710\nI'm just gonna stop there, okay?\n\n339\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.610\nBut yeah, there it is.\n\n340\n00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.500\nAnd then all I have to do is drag\nthat folder onto everything,\n\n341\n00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.490\nI've created a group.\n\n342\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.490\nBut wait there's more.\n\n343\n00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:13.890\nYou asked about hey,\nif I'm gonna use that thing,\n\n344\n00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:19.030\nI want my ProRes in that prelude.\n\n345\n00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:24.220\nIf you want ProRes option in prelude or\nany option, you make it here.\n\n346\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.770\nCuz everything goes through media and\ncoder.\n\n347\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.470\nSo if I say create a new precept.\n\n348\n00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.220\nCreate a new encoding create a new ingest,\ninteresting?\n\n349\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.680\nCuz one will go to encoding,\none will go to ingest and\n\n350\n00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:44.185\nit knows the difference,\nokay you can create an ingest preset,\n\n351\n00:18:44.185 --> 00:18:47.895\nso I will say let's make an ingest preset.\n\n352\n00:18:49.075 --> 00:18:50.145\nAnd what do I do?\n\n353\n00:18:50.145 --> 00:18:52.877\nI'm gonna call it 422.\n\n354\n00:18:52.877 --> 00:18:55.065\nI'm gonna do this really quickly.\n\n355\n00:18:55.065 --> 00:18:57.545\n422 summary on the output,\ncopy files to destination.\n\n356\n00:18:57.545 --> 00:19:03.545\nSo notice this is one for prelude, okay.\n\n357\n00:19:03.545 --> 00:19:05.435\nSo that's an ingest preset.\n\n358\n00:19:05.435 --> 00:19:12.714\nI'm gonna do the end coding here it comes\nnew preset and I'm going to say 422.\n\n359\n00:19:12.714 --> 00:19:14.944\nRight, format needs to be quick time for\n\n360\n00:19:14.944 --> 00:19:17.470\nthat because this is\na quick time animation.\n\n361\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:23.250\nAll right notice it's still not in\nthere that's because I go to video and\n\n362\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.560\nI choose video codec and\nthen boom there it is.\n\n363\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.920\nApple ProRes 422.\n\n364\n00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.180\nAnd I'll just say match to the source.\n\n365\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:39.170\nIf I click Match Source, it doesn't matter\nwhat the frame rate or anything is.\n\n366\n00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.820\nNow, could I save VR as video?\n\n367\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.447\nI could click that and\nsend it to my 422 VR but\n\n368\n00:19:44.447 --> 00:19:47.518\nright now this is just a simple 422.\n\n369\n00:19:47.518 --> 00:19:53.170\nIf I go back to prelude,\nthat is now an option for transcode.\n\n370\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.950\nThat is now an option for transcode.\n\n371\n00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.680\n&gt;&gt; But we did it in the encoder.\n\n372\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.120\n&gt;&gt; You have to do it in coder,\nbecause the encoder is what handles all of\n\n373\n00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.420\nthis codec at this resolution,\nblah blah blah blah blah blah blah.\n\n374\n00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and prelude and\n\n375\n00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.890\nmedia encoder obviously talk to each\nother cuz it's the in and the out.\n\n376\n00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:13.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I could create on that's\nalways H264 at this frame rate at this\n\n377\n00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.210\nresolution, because when we\nshoot on cameras we do multicam.\n\n378\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.000\nAll the cameras are indifferent,\n\n379\n00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.590\neverything good, drag it,\nall the files, boom, done.\n\n380\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.540\nAnd like I said,\nThis'll just do everything.\n\n381\n00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.060\nNow to change the destination all I\nhave to do is click this blue thing and\n\n382\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.630\nchange the destination\nof where it will go.\n\n383\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.000\nAnd I've tried this before and\nit does work.\n\n384\n00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.470\nI could highlight all of them,\nclick one, and\n\n385\n00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.860\nsay put it straight to the desktop,\nchoose.\n\n386\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.350\nNotice it changes them all to the desktop.\n\n387\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.780\nSo there we go and then I hit the green\nbutton I'm not going to get the green\n\n388\n00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.950\nbutton and put a bunch of files on\nthere but this is how it works and\n\n389\n00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.630\nit works in the background.\n\n390\n00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.420\nThe thing that most people don't\nunderstand because it works\n\n391\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.579\nin the background I can come back and\ncompletely edit this sequence\n\n392\n00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.290\nwhile that's working because\nit basically sent just data.\n\n393\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:08.040\nIt sent data about it and it's working off\nof that data at the time of the export.\n\n394\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.570\nSo I can make all kinds of cut,\n\n395\n00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.870\nchanges, color effects, whatever and\nit doesn't affect the export.\n\n396\n00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.610\nIt will be what I chose\nto export at that Time.\n\n397\n00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.510\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n398\n00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.100\nYeah, this is one of those,\nlike, wow, this is so cool,\n\n399\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.520\nI can't wait to be able to do this.\n\n400\n00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.130\nNow you're saving yourself hours,\n\n401\n00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.070\nyou know maybe even to add it all up,\ndays of time doing this.\n\n402\n00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:32.740\nBut there is a back one,\nnow you don't have the excuse to say,\n\n403\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.140\nwell I can't do anything because it's all,\nyou know, tied up.\n\n404\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.220\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know.\n&gt;&gt; I'll have to go get a sandwich.\n\n405\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.823\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\nNo, you gotta keep working.\n\n406\n00:21:39.823 --> 00:21:40.393\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n407\n00:21:40.393 --> 00:21:42.163\nYou're going to have to work on your like,\n\n408\n00:21:42.163 --> 00:21:44.173\nwell I can't really use\nthe encoder right now,\n\n409\n00:21:44.173 --> 00:21:47.705\nwe're gonna have to straight export and\nI'm gonna need to get some lunch.\n\n410\n00:21:47.705 --> 00:21:49.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n411\n00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.090\n&gt;&gt; Or you know,\nyou could just load this up with so\n\n412\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.560\nmany files,\nit's going to take a long time.\n\n413\n00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.155\nThat's the thing.\n\n414\n00:21:53.155 --> 00:21:53.655\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n415\n00:21:53.655 --> 00:21:55.120\n&gt;&gt; But Yeah, no this is great.\n\n416\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.300\nI know a lot of people will say to me,\nIt looks like it's gonna take so\n\n417\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.000\nlong to set up that media encoder,\nor maybe that prelude.\n\n418\n00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.020\nThe amount of time setting\nit up is not going to be\n\n419\n00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:11.830\nas much time as just doing it over and\nover and over again.\n\n420\n00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.080\nYeah, you will see the results.\n\n421\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.250\n&gt;&gt; Right, you will see the results.\n\n422\n00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.780\nBecause you'd spending more time editing,\nmore time creating,\n\n423\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.040\nmore time having fun,\nmore time learning about 360,\n\n424\n00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.470\nbecause you don't have to worry about\nall your exports and imports anymore.\n\n425\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:29.050\n&gt;&gt; Wow, well that is definitely a step up\nfor where you're inputting and outputting.\n\n426\n00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.940\nAnd I was following along right away,\n\n427\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.630\ncuz I was totally relating it\nto different props that I use.\n\n428\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.500\nI'm like.\n\n429\n00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.740\nI know this, this is cool.\n\n430\n00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is gonna work.\n\n431\n00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.531\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n432\n00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:42.680\nWell, thank you so much for\nstepping it up for us.\n\n433\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.080\nBut for now, we're going to go ahead and\nfinish up this episode.\n\n434\n00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.700\nWe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n435\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.400\nWe're Creative PRO TV.\n\n436\n00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.020\nI've been your host Bon Smith.\n\n437\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.640\n&gt;&gt; I'm Jim Biddle.\n\n438\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.560\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n439\n00:22:53.560 -->

Hey, how is it going?\n\n9\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.190\n&gt;&gt; It's\n&gt;&gt; Great, so\n\n10\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.340\nwe're gonna be bringing some outside help?\n\n11\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.700\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we are absolutely bringing\nin some outside help too.\n\n12\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.870\n&gt;&gt; I had to do the same but\nit is freezing in here, so\n\n13\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.320\nI brought my outside help, my sweater.\n\n14\n00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n15\n00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, in Florida.\n\n16\n00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.280\n&gt;&gt; Good.\nYeah\n\n17\n00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have your tank top and\n\n18\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.670\nyour sweater, always.\n\n19\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.930\n&gt;&gt; Tank top and sweater.\n\n20\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.710\nYep\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n21\n00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.530\nwhat are we gonna be talking about here?\n\n22\n00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.870\n&gt;&gt;

Wow.\n&gt;&gt; But what's doing is\n\n180\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.790\nremembered when we looked at lumetri?\n\n181\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:11.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n182\n00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.860\n&gt;&gt; When we looked at lumetri it said,\nokay this is the color breakdown and\n\n183\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.790\nyou can use that as a lumetri lut,\nthat's what essentially doing.\n\n184\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.790\nI hit the bubbles and say freeze\nit right there, that's it, I say\n\n185\n00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:30.910\ngreat and then I can adjust it a little\nbit cuz maybe the temperature is off.\n\n186\n00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.720\nAdjust a little bit like this,\nclick the little K and\n\n187\n00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:41.155\nthen I send this up to my cloud library\nand I I can use this as a creative lot.\n\n188\n00:11:42.465 --> 00:11:45.592\n&gt;&gt; Wow that's neat [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, I can use this as a creative one\n\n189\n00:11:45.592 --> 00:11:49.558\nand the reason why do that, oftentimes is,\nthis will match where I shot.\n\n190\n00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:55.215\nThis will give me the creative area of\nwhere I shot and that helps me do creative\n\n191\n00:11:55.215 --> 00:12:01.241\nlot and sometimes do with an adjustment\nlayer it helps me in my adjustment layers.\n\n192\n00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:05.713\nAnd so yeah, it's really that's one\nof my absolute favorite things and\n\n193\n00:12:05.713 --> 00:12:09.232\nonce again, it goes into your\ncreative cloud account and\n\n194\n00:12:09.232 --> 00:12:13.650\nyou can download it from your\ncreative cloud account and use it.\n\n195\n00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.825\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 'cause you can,\nin all of your apps, you can go ahead and\n\n196\n00:12:15.825 --> 00:12:16.795\nsign into the cloud.\n\n197\n00:12:16.795 --> 00:12:18.800\nEverything's connected to the cloud now,\nso it's super convenient.\n\n198\n00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything is connected\nto that cloud account.\n\n199\n00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:24.438\nYou simply upload it and then you download\nit to the computer, use all of it, and\n\n200\n00:12:24.438 --> 00:12:26.068\nthen save it back up to the cloud.\n\n201\n00:12:26.068 --> 00:12:31.040\nIt's really fun, and these little side\nprograms are great like let's say for\n\n202\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.192\nclip, I'm just out shooting,\nI'm gonna shoot some real fast.\n\n203\n00:12:35.192 --> 00:12:38.496\nAnd then I'm gonna go running back\nto my computer, there it is, or\n\n204\n00:12:38.496 --> 00:12:40.032\nwe've been shooting all day.\n\n205\n00:12:40.032 --> 00:12:44.219\nLet me just get this whole thing of the\ncolor scheme and it'll make it easier for\n\n206\n00:12:44.219 --> 00:12:45.751\nus to create a creative lot.\n\n207\n00:12:45.751 --> 00:12:48.080\n&gt;&gt; And especially I think\nat different times of day,\n\n208\n00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.474\nwhere that's gonna change and\nyou can just kinda capture it as you need.\n\n209\n00:12:51.474 --> 00:12:53.619\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly or, even it might not,\n\n210\n00:12:53.619 --> 00:12:57.391\nI've used this when it's not even\nrelated to what we're shooting.\n\n211\n00:12:57.391 --> 00:13:00.521\nI'm just sitting at a street going,\nwow, this is a great color palette.\n\n212\n00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:02.190\n&gt;&gt;
