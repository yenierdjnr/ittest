Great, thanks for making it easy on me.\n\n8\n00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.423\n&gt;&gt; I know, I love when Daniel does that.\n\n9\n00:00:33.423 --> 00:00:38.420\nThe total expert on this, like well-\n&gt;&gt; No pressure, no pressure, no pressure.\n\n10\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.360\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n11\n00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.498\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n12\n00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:41.951\nWell Vonne, it's great to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:44.065\n&gt;&gt; I know, well I'm really excited for\nthis series-\n\n14\n00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:45.085\n&gt;&gt; Me too.\n\n15\n00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:47.160\n&gt;&gt; To learn all about our Premiere and\nsome video editing.\n\n16\n00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.154\nAnd we're starting from\nthe very beginning.\n\n17\n00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:50.280\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna take it from\n\n18\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.725\na base level and move up, because we\ntalked about it, and this is our overview.\n\n19\n00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:54.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.363\n&gt;&gt; We're actually filming this last, and\n\n21\n00:00:56.363 --> 00:00:59.381\nwe've actually gone through all\nthe episodes and I've learned a lot.\n\n22\n00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:01.944\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; But I wanted to kind of go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:06.213\njust get a quick frame of reference for\njust some terminology.\n\n24\n00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:08.383\nAnd I love how we-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n25\n00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:10.066\n&gt;&gt; Read me cuz-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the read me file,\n\n26\n00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.369\nno one ever reads the read me file.\n\n27\n00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.507\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Read the read me file.\n\n28\n00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.307\n&gt;&gt; Yes, read the instructions.\n\n29\n00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:16.155\n&gt;&gt; Please read the instructions.\n\n30\n00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:20.972\n&gt;&gt; And so one thing that I do\nwhen I'm learning a product is\n\n31\n00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:24.233\nI wanna know the right terminology.\n\n32\n00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:29.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that way I can use it wrongly.\n\n33\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.263\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, we do have some standardized\nlanguage within editing and within Adobe,\n\n34\n00:01:34.263 --> 00:01:37.772\nbut you're always going to\nsay something that's close.\n\n35\n00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:42.496\nFor example, the timeline is a tool and\nsequences go in it, but\n\n36\n00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:47.773\neverybody just says show me the sequence,\nshow me the sequence tool.\n\n37\n00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:48.286\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:48.286 --> 00:01:50.355\n&gt;&gt; I mean it just happens that way.\n\n39\n00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:54.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,and I think it's from just being\nin the industry and you just start using\n\n40\n00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:58.529\nthis terminology and you just use it like\nit's regular language for you, but for\n\n41\n00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:02.572\nme like an outsider coming in, it's like\nwait, was that a sequence or a clip?\n\n42\n00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:05.590\nWait, is it a clip and\na media the same thing?\n\n43\n00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.870\n&gt;&gt; It's a media and file and\nthen everything's going crazy so, yeah.\n\n44\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.828\nThere are some things you\nwanna embed in there.\n\n45\n00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:11.414\nDon't get it wrong but\n\n46\n00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:15.920\nin other cases you can fudge out\na couple of times, it's okay.\n\n47\n00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I know when we go\nthrough all these episodes you\n\n48\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.420\nreally explain all of this and\nI'm, I get it.\n\n49\n00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.987\nBut it took me a couple episodes to\nkinda clear it in my mind of exactly\n\n50\n00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:27.689\nthe sequence and the segments.\n\n51\n00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.282\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So I've actually made a few notes.\n\n52\n00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.245\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you don't mind,\n\n53\n00:02:30.245 --> 00:02:32.501\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nask you a few things and\n\n54\n00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:34.614\ndo a quick overview of\nexplaining something.\n\n55\n00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:37.907\n&gt;&gt; Hit me with the notes, just don't\nhit me like you hit me after the show.\n\n56\n00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:38.407\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n57\n00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:39.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, I'll-\n\n58\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.039\n&gt;&gt; Help me.\n\n59\n00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.367\n&gt;&gt; I'll be gentle. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; All right.\n\n60\n00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:42.178\nGood.\n\n61\n00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:43.940\n&gt;&gt; So we have media versus clip,\n\n62\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.650\nis it the same thing?\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, no.\n\n63\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.887\nSo media is essence, it's what you shot on\n\n64\n00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:54.174\nyour camera or it's the actual file that\nyou've, you can see it as a quick timer,\n\n65\n00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:58.589\na JPEG, or something like that.\nOnce it is brought into Premiere,\n\n66\n00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:02.171\nit becomes what we call a clip or\na masterclip.\n\n67\n00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.138\nThat is metadata that\n\n68\n00:03:04.138 --> 00:03:08.100\nrepresents the media.\nAnd that's why clips, you can change.\n\n69\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.780\nYou can make them longer or shorter.\n\n70\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.501\nYou can rename them.\n\n71\n00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:12.452\nYou can add effects to them and\n\n72\n00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:16.232\nit doesn't affect the actual media.\nIt stays the same.\n\n73\n00:03:16.232 --> 00:03:17.840\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like a nickname,\n\n74\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.389\nlike we're nicknaming this\nparticular thing that's [CROSSTALK]\n\n75\n00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.223\n&gt;&gt; Nicknaming or I often say,\n\n76\n00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:26.985\nthe media is the parts and\nthe clip is the instructions.\n\n77\n00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:28.029\nAnd I can change it,\n\n78\n00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:32.148\nI could rewrite the instructions, put it\nin a nice glossy binder, do all that,\n\n79\n00:03:32.148 --> 00:03:34.251\ndoesn't change the parts.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n80\n00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:34.763\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n81\n00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:36.087\n&gt;&gt; Great, all right, wonderful.\n\n82\n00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:38.823\nNow when we talk about audio, I feel it's\n\n83\n00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:43.904\nthe whole of how we capture it and then\nthere's an audio clip cuz we understand\n\n84\n00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:47.170\nthat clips when it's coming to Premiere.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n85\n00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.775\n&gt;&gt; But then when it goes somewhere\n\n86\n00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:50.975\nelse it becomes a track?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n87\n00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:52.760\nso-\n&gt;&gt; Or am I jumping the gun a little?\n\n88\n00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.290\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, you're fine, you're fine.\n\n89\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.560\nThe thing is when you get into audio,\n\n90\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.910\npeople who do an audio has a very,\nvery specialized language,\n\n91\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.260\nmostly because they don't\nwant to talk to anybody else.\n\n92\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.030\nAnd if you don't speak their language\nthey'll just go, [SOUND] and walk away.\n\n93\n00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.200\nWhen we bring in media, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.100\nWe think of that as input and\nwe say that something has channels.\n\n95\n00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.470\nSo if you record on a camera,\nyou have two channels maybe, or\n\n96\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.550\nsome cameras record like eight channels.\n\n97\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.260\nOr maybe you recorded on a device\nthat gave you four channels.\n\n98\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.362\nThat's considered an input.\n\n99\n00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:30.285\nSo when you put it into a sequence,\nthat's when you see\n\n100\n00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:35.325\nmovies where guys do a mixer and\ndoing stuff like [SOUND].\n\n101\n00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:35.871\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n102\n00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:38.590\n&gt;&gt; And they say we need more tracks, man.\n\n103\n00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.934\nThat's the thing is that\non the output side,\n\n104\n00:04:41.934 --> 00:04:45.430\nwhich is the sequence side,\nyou have tracks.\n\n105\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.686\nAnd that's why something with\ntwo channels, or eight channels,\n\n106\n00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:51.137\ncan go in to one track.\n\n107\n00:04:51.137 --> 00:04:52.670\n&gt;&gt; And that's where I use the wrong C.\n\n108\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.237\nI said clips but when you said channels,\nI was yes, that's right.\n\n109\n00:04:56.237 --> 00:04:56.840\n&gt;&gt; Channels.\n\n110\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.090\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you were saying channels.\n\n111\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.700\nAnd I think that's another one where\nthere's the input and the output are like,\n\n112\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.930\nhow you captured it with your device-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n113\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.410\n&gt;&gt; When it comes into Premiere and\nthen how it goes out of Premiere and\n\n114\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.800\nall that kind of stuff-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n115\n00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.700\nI think we talked a couple of times,\nI like to think\n\n116\n00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.020\nof the left side as the input side and\nthe right side is the output side.\n\n117\n00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.895\nThat's why you have different language,\nlike we have clips and channels and\n\n118\n00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:26.261\ngain for audio, when we're adjusting how\nloud or soft it is, we're adjusting gain.\n\n119\n00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:28.932\nCuz we always said on audio input,\nyou have gain.\n\n120\n00:05:28.932 --> 00:05:31.907\nOn output, you have volume.\n\n121\n00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:33.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n122\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.062\n&gt;&gt; So left side, we have clips,\nwe have channels, we have gain.\n\n123\n00:05:37.062 --> 00:05:41.090\nOn the right side,\nwhich is the output side,\n\n124\n00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.980\nwe have segments, we have volume,\nand we have tracks.\n\n125\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we explain all of this.\n\n126\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.040\nYou explain it very well\nin all these episodes.\n\n127\n00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.340\nSo again, we're just doing\nlisten to the terminology.\n\n128\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.530\nWhen we're saying left and right,\n\n129\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.310\nwe're talking about the physical\nsides of the program.\n\n130\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.386\n&gt;&gt; We can take a quick look right\nnow at the interface, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:07.190\nBecause what we do is we have panels.\n\n132\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.530\nSo we have panels, we have panel groups.\n\n133\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.795\nAnd then everything that's\nsort of on the left side.\n\n134\n00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:16.325\nOkay, everything that's on\nthis left side right here.\n\n135\n00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:19.953\nThe source and the project,\nthat's what I'm considering the left side,\n\n136\n00:06:19.953 --> 00:06:22.442\nthe input side because this\nwhere we get our clips.\n\n137\n00:06:22.442 --> 00:06:27.891\nThe source area is where we take\na clip and we modify it, okay?\n\n138\n00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:34.960\nI'm only gonna take this much right here,\nand you'll learn this as I'm doing it.\n\n139\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.332\nI have marked a segment of\nthis that I'm going to use,\n\n140\n00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:43.033\nand then I bring it down\nhere to the sequence.\n\n141\n00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:49.081\nAnd now I've used a segment of this clip\nwhich now I can adjust it to volume or\n\n142\n00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:52.640\non this side I could've adjusted its gain.\n\n143\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and see right there, the whole,\nokay here is the clip we went in and\n\n144\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.477\nthe source.\n\n145\n00:06:56.477 --> 00:07:00.704\nThat's not a part of just understanding\nthe names of the windows or\n\n146\n00:07:00.704 --> 00:07:03.798\npanels, cuz we use those\nwords interchangeably\n\n147\n00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:07.362\nwithin what we call the workspace\nof any Adobe product.\n\n148\n00:07:07.362 --> 00:07:08.894\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n149\n00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:11.054\nCuz all of these window panel\nthingies that we go in.\n\n150\n00:07:11.054 --> 00:07:12.858\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's like project,\n\n151\n00:07:12.858 --> 00:07:16.205\nokay that's that name, source,\nand then it comes down.\n\n152\n00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:19.030\nAgain that terminology of go up, go up,\n\n153\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.620\ngo up and-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n154\n00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n155\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.055\n&gt;&gt; And that's the thing I couldn't say.\n\n156\n00:07:22.055 --> 00:07:25.320\nCuz technically this is\nthe project panel group.\n\n157\n00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.750\nAnd there are things within it.\n\n158\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.712\nThis is the source panel group.\n\n159\n00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:30.810\nThe source panel which has a panel group.\n\n160\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.130\nAnd I could make that very clear\nthe entire time, but then I would go very,\n\n161\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.940\nvery slow and be worried more about\nsaying it correctly than having fun and\n\n162\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.630\nshowing you what to do.\n\n163\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; One last thing I want to show about\n\n164\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.260\nthe left-right, and\nto explain channel tracks.\n\n165\n00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.190\nThis left side in the sequence,\n\n166\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.640\nand we're gonna talk about this\nseveral times, represents the source.\n\n167\n00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.080\nAnd it has a video channel and\nan audio channel.\n\n168\n00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:02.808\nThis represents the sequence which has\nthree video tracks and four audio tracks.\n\n169\n00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:09.380\n&gt;&gt; That's where you're actually\ndoing all of the editing.\n\n170\n00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.408\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's where we actually.\n\n171\n00:08:10.408 --> 00:08:14.418\n&gt;&gt; Even within Premiere, we can do all\nthese, I keep calling them layers, and\n\n172\n00:08:14.418 --> 00:08:18.490\nI keep referring to it throughout the\nseries, because I see it as layers, but\n\n173\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.079\nthese are tracks [CROSSTALK].\n\n174\n00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:24.142\n&gt;&gt; If you're a Photoshop user or even\nsometimes an After Effects user coming\n\n175\n00:08:24.142 --> 00:08:28.418\ninto Premiere, you're gonna use\nthe language that you're used to, okay?\n\n176\n00:08:28.418 --> 00:08:30.973\nAnd eventually you'll realize\nwhen you bounce back and\n\n177\n00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:34.890\nforth between applications there's new\nterms of different terms because different\n\n178\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.515\ntypes of professionals use\ndifferent apps all the time.\n\n179\n00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:40.441\nIt happens, don't feel bad, yeah.\n\n180\n00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:42.456\nSome people are just gonna tell you, well,\n\n181\n00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:44.530\nthey actually really\nshould be same tracks.\n\n182\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.070\nI mean, it's fine.\n\n183\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n184\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Just take the ribbing and move on.\n\n185\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.223\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\nAnd\n\n186\n00:08:49.223 --> 00:08:53.029\nit's because I've been with you this\nwhole week and you're going through this.\n\n187\n00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:53.588\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n188\n00:08:53.588 --> 00:08:55.217\nYep, there's that terminology.\n\n189\n00:08:55.217 --> 00:08:58.485\nIt's already clicking,\nthe more you hear it and\n\n190\n00:08:58.485 --> 00:09:03.583\nthe more you see it in action as we go\nthrough everything, it will get it, but\n\n191\n00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:09.028\nI just wanted to kinda go through some of\nthose super basics of what is a sequence-\n\n192\n00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:09.842\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n193\n00:09:09.842 --> 00:09:12.270\n&gt;&gt; Because the sequence is over on\nthe timeline, and that's where-\n\n194\n00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.185\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n195\n00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:15.311\n&gt;&gt; We'll be doing the editing,\n\n196\n00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:19.085\nbut the segments are what\nyou want out of your clips.\n\n197\n00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:20.611\n[CROSSTALK] that was your media.\n\n198\n00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:22.668\n&gt;&gt; And then it becomes a game.\n\n199\n00:09:22.668 --> 00:09:23.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n200\n00:09:23.725 --> 00:09:24.352\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n201\n00:09:24.352 --> 00:09:28.762\nAnd so we'll use different words-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n202\n00:09:28.762 --> 00:09:32.300\n&gt;&gt; Throughout here, but we're just kinda-\n&gt;&gt; And you'll catch us doing that and\n\n203\n00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.854\nfun with it.\n\n204\n00:09:32.854 --> 00:09:37.201\nHave fun with the fact that you caught\nus saying maybe something slightly,\n\n205\n00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.850\nhave fun with it please.\n\n206\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I do the same\nthing that the That's not right.\n\n207\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.175\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n208\n00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:45.977\n&gt;&gt; No, bad kitty.\n&gt;&gt; Bad kitty.\n\n209\n00:09:45.977 --> 00:09:46.564\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\nSo\n\n210\n00:09:46.564 --> 00:09:48.599\nI just want to kind of get a frame-up and\n\n211\n00:09:48.599 --> 00:09:51.018\nwe do mention a lot about\nhot keys in this show.\n\n212\n00:09:51.018 --> 00:09:53.030\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we talk a lot about hot keys.\n\n213\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.570\nThere are some very simple ones.\n\n214\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.010\nThe ones that I mention are the ones you\nprobably gonna want to commit to memory or\n\n215\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.920\nwrite down.\n\n216\n00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.870\nAnd then again,\nI will show this several times,\n\n217\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.380\nI'm just gonna go back\nto Premiere Pro here.\n\n218\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.845\nThere is a keyboard shortcuts area\nthat you can fire up and look through.\n\n219\n00:10:08.845 --> 00:10:14.363\nThe other thing is too, I didn't really\nmention this in lessons, but one\n\n220\n00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:20.160\nthing that a lot of people do is instead\nof adding or modifying, they remove.\n\n221\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.220\nBecause they don't use a lot, and they\nwill basically clear the keyboard out as\n\n222\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.960\nmuch as they can and\nthen only add in what they need.\n\n223\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.706\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think it's just\nhow you wanna approach it but\n\n224\n00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:33.255\nput in those hot keys to memory.\n\n225\n00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:37.952\nAnd in the show notes, we do have a link\nto the Adobe website that has shortcuts\n\n226\n00:10:37.952 --> 00:10:39.554\nfor both Windows and Mac.\n\n227\n00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:42.687\nAnd here is another side note,\nwe are using a Mac here-\n\n228\n00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:43.780\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we're just using a Mac.\n\n229\n00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.112\n&gt;&gt; And so we're using Mac terminology like\nthe finder, but if you're in Windows,\n\n230\n00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:50.547\nI mean anybody that does this stuff, you\nkinda just have to translate a little bit.\n\n231\n00:10:50.547 --> 00:10:54.827\n&gt;&gt; If you're a regular PC user, you'll\nknow exactly what it is in PC world.\n\n232\n00:10:54.827 --> 00:10:58.700\nAll my files are Mac, that's the only\nreason while we're using the Mac.\n\n233\n00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.187\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and right here we're going\nto the preferences from the many, but\n\n234\n00:11:02.187 --> 00:11:04.260\npreferences and Windows in the edit menu.\n\n235\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.512\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, they're in different areas.\n\n236\n00:11:06.512 --> 00:11:09.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\na lot of keywords in the length that\n\n237\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.612\nI'm going to give you in the show\nnotes it has the Windows and PC.\n\n238\n00:11:12.612 --> 00:11:16.974\nAnd so if you are on a Windows machines\nyou can still learn everything you\n\n239\n00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:17.563\nneed to.\n\n240\n00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:18.364\nYou just have to do that.\n\n241\n00:11:18.364 --> 00:11:22.617\nThat kind of translation that\nanybody that is bilingual in these\n\n242\n00:11:22.617 --> 00:11:24.359\nplatforms just has to do.\n\n243\n00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:27.164\n&gt;&gt; Again, and when you know a lot of\napplications and you know a lot of\n\n244\n00:11:27.164 --> 00:11:30.128\noperating systems, that's where\nyour language gets switched up.\n\n245\n00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:30.639\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n246\n00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:31.464\n&gt;&gt; No, that's this one.\n\n247\n00:11:31.464 --> 00:11:32.113\nWhoopsie.\n\n248\n00:11:32.113 --> 00:11:35.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there's a lot of times\nwhere I'm, yeah, the alt-drag, and\n\n249\n00:11:35.224 --> 00:11:36.948\nI'm, wait we're-\n&gt;&gt;
