another great\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.550\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.290\nin today's episode we are kicking\noff our Premiere Pro series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.060\nJoining us in the studio to lend\nhis expertise on that very topic\n\n7\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.500\nis our good friend, Mr. James Biddle.\n\n8\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.010\nJames, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.980\nWe're so glad to have you today.\n\n10\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.440\nHow's it going?\n>> Dan, it's great to be here,\n\n11\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.138\nbut\n>> I like you.\n\n12\n00:00:32.138 --> 00:00:34.463\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I like Adobe Premiere,\n\n13\n00:00:34.463 --> 00:00:37.116\neven more [CROSSTALK] I’m\njust gonna go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:41.780\nget started and I wanna talk to everybody\nabout just opening up Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\n15\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.390\nAnd getting into the settings.\n\n16\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.370\nAdobe does a really good\njob of setting this up so\n\n17\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.910\nyou have the ability to just get started\nbut you might want to change some stuff.\n\n18\n00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.630\nAnd they're also very good\nat letting you personalize.\n\n19\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.130\nThe thing I like to do is\nlook at the pretty pictures.\n\n20\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.380\nI love that adobe puts these great\npictures on here to sort of inspire\n\n21\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.600\nInspire to get into editing.\n\n22\n00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.820\nAll right.\nSo here's our opening screen.\n\n23\n00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.630\nWhenever you open any of the suite,\n\n24\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.700\nyou get a screen like this to\nask you what do you want to do?\n\n25\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.610\nAnd it's more than just open a project or\nstart a new project.\n\n26\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.728\nNotice I can get into recent projects,\n\n27\n00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:19.150\nit will say,\nyour recent work will appear here.\n\n28\n00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.802\nSo if you've already been\nworking on something,\n\n29\n00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:22.030\nit just appears right there for you.\n\n30\n00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.570\nYou get to started.\n\n31\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.850\nI can ask a quick question especially\nif there have been any updates.\n\n32\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.630\nWe all know now with a creative Cloud,\nyou get a lot of updates.\n\n33\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.560\nYou have missed something, so you can\njump right in and found out what was new.\n\n34\n00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.340\nI can check on my Cloud account.\n\n35\n00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.970\nBut let me quit rambling.\n\n36\n00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.690\nLet's just get started.\n\n37\n00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.750\nI'm gonna start a new project.\n\n38\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.530\nOkay.\n\n39\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.620\nSo anytime you get lost in\nany of the panels, okay?\n\n40\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.880\nI'm calling this big\nguy right here a panel.\n\n41\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.773\nAnytime you get lost in a panel,\ngo right to the top gray bar, and\n\n42\n00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:52.336\nit will tell you what's going on.\n\n43\n00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:53.610\nA new project.\n\n44\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.420\nThat's fairly simple,\ncoming down, we want to name it.\n\n45\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.270\nPlease don't leave it untitled.\n\n46\n00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.610\nIf you've seen me here,\ndo it for me, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.850\nName your pets.\n\n48\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.890\nCat, dog, you know a great moniker,\nbut you know, Fluffy.\n\n49\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.030\nSomething like that.\n\n50\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.540\nAnd make it something\nthat you can remember and\n\n51\n00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.740\nmaybe it's a little specific\nto what you're doing.\n\n52\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.060\nSo untitled number 927 is so\nfairly non descriptive.\n\n53\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.090\nIt's not gonna be very helpful.\n\n54\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.370\n>> It's non descriptive,\nbut I've seen untitled 927.\n\n55\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.280\nIt looks a lot like 928.\n\n56\n00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.160\nSo, here we go.\n\n57\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.690\nI'm just gonna call this IT PRO TV.\n\n58\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.440\nGive it a little underscore, and\njust say, premier lesson, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.400\nAnd that way,\nI know exactly what's going on.\n\n60\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.800\nNow where's it gonna go?\n\n61\n00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.330\nAdobe does a great job with defaults,\nagain, so\n\n62\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.770\nyou don't have to think about certain\nthings, but you may want to change it.\n\n63\n00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.850\nRight now, I really don't want it going to\nthis hard drive under this default area,\n\n64\n00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.600\nso I will choose browse, and\nI will say I want to put it on this\n\n65\n00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.630\nExternal drive that I brought, and\njust call it Lessons, all right?\n\n66\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.760\nThat way, I'm gonna remember it, and\nI have it on my own private drive.\n\n67\n00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.870\nOnce we get down here, these are some\nsettings that you may wanna explore later\n\n68\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.120\nabout video rendering and playback.\n\n69\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.360\nAdobe gives you options so that you can\nuse the graphics processing card for\n\n70\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.390\na lot of your previews and depending on\nyour type of computer and your graphics\n\n71\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.770\ncard you may be able to, like,\nwe like to say, like scream through this.\n\n72\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.740\nSo we have one here and\nwe'll be able to use it today.\n\n73\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.830\nThese three,\nyou can change a lot of this at any time.\n\n74\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.130\nIf you don't do it now, Adobe always\noffers you the opportunity to do it later.\n\n75\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.210\nSo when I'm working with video, I'll be\nable to do time code or I can see feet and\n\n76\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.550\nframes or just frames depending\non what I'm working on.\n\n77\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.480\nAudio, usually display format.\n\n78\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.670\nAudio samples is fine.\n\n79\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.659\nIf you're somebody that's really into\nbeats, you might want to do milliseconds.\n\n80\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.160\nAlso the capture format.\n\n81\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.790\nCapture is specifically when you\ncome from one medium to another.\n\n82\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.310\nAnd now you may have worked with\ntape before, Dan, I don't know.\n\n83\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.760\nBut if you do tape and\n\n84\n00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.090\ncome in, that's where this capture\npreset can be very, very important.\n\n85\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.930\nIf you're just coming out of\ncard-based media, you're coming off and\n\n86\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.770\ndrive, this really doesn't\nmatter in the beginning.\n\n87\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.800\nAlso, you can display the project item\nname and label color for all instances.\n\n88\n00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.470\nAnd notice when I do that,\nit gives me a little,\n\n89\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.120\nit gives me a little heads up to say,\nif this item is checked, names and\n\n90\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.740\nlabel colors will match\nthe corresponding project item.\n\n91\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.210\nThat may sound a little over descriptive.\n\n92\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.640\nAdobe gives you that over description\nbecause then when you actually do this,\n\n93\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.510\nyou can say now I know what they mean.\n\n94\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.600\nScratch Disks.\n\n95\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.480\nHere's what they're saying is\nif you are capturing items,\n\n96\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.160\nyou're coming off of a tape or\nmaybe you're doing film.\n\n97\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.240\nCongratulations if you are.\n\n98\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.860\nWhere will the files be located?\n\n99\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.220\nIn most cases,\n\n100\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.882\ncaptured video, not going to matter cuz\nyou're probably using card based media.\n\n101\n00:04:56.882 --> 00:05:00.520\nIf you're coming off of tapes or\nfilms, you're gonna have to set this.\n\n102\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.970\nRight now it's gonna default to all\nthese default, same as project.\n\n103\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.110\nSo where that project file is located, and\n\n104\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.720\nit tells me right here,\nvolumes, my drive, and lessons.\n\n105\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.650\nEverything's going to go right there.\n\n106\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.640\nFor today, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nleave that for these lessons.\n\n107\n00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.680\nI can route it to anywhere I want to.\n\n108\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.690\nI can route it to another drive,\nI've known people who have tried,\n\n109\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.600\nyou know I'm going to do it to Dropbox at\nthe same time, or something like that.\n\n110\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.420\nAnd you know it works just well.\n\n111\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.100\nYou can experiment with this.\n\n112\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.890\nAs long as you know where it was,\nyou can retrieve it.\n\n113\n00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.958\nThe only one that I generally\nset in here is captured audio.\n\n114\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:44.280\nNow I'm be pulling off a tape or anything\nlike that and I have some audio on a card.\n\n115\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.110\nThe reason I do this, is there is\na nice voice over feature in here,\n\n116\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.690\nwhere I can read through my laptop or\n\n117\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.070\nit's a little board unto a microphone and\nI'll get an audio file.\n\n118\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.540\nThe way that Adobe premier\nknows how to place that file\n\n119\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.745\nis by using this captured audio setting.\n\n120\n00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:05.251\nI can leave it same as project, and\nit will know exactly where it is or\n\n121\n00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:08.995\nmaybe a special audio\nfolder that I wanna design.\n\n122\n00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:11.925\nIf not, I'm just gonna leave\neverything where it is.\n\n123\n00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:17.360\nThen the one that I usually like to change\na lot, is called project auto save, what\n\n124\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.070\nthis means is, I'm about to create that\nlittle file, that little project file.\n\n125\n00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.580\nI double-click it, it opens and I get it.\n\n126\n00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.130\n>> Magic.\n\n127\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.654\n>> Magic.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.520\n>> Something might happen,\n\n129\n00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.330\nit might explode,\nsometimes things get corrupt.\n\n130\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.780\nSo Adobe offers me this great option\nto say hey, if you forgot to save or\n\n131\n00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.660\nyou're not saving enough,\nat a certain period in time,\n\n132\n00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.950\nwe will create an autosaved backup for\nyou.\n\n133\n00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.110\nAnd generally, you can do it like\nevery five minutes, every ten minutes,\n\n134\n00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.970\nevery two hours, whatever you want.\n\n135\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.560\nAnd you can put it right next to\nwhere your projects are located.\n\n136\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.685\nOr like I do,\nI send it to an to another drive.\n\n137\n00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:01.445\nSo that way, if the project and\nthe autosave are on the same drive and\n\n138\n00:07:01.445 --> 00:07:04.475\nsomething goes kablooie,\nI just lost all my autosaves.\n\n139\n00:07:04.475 --> 00:07:07.395\n>> So the good people at Adobe have\nrealized the fact that we, as humans,\n\n140\n00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:12.187\naren't really great about saving our\nwork before Something critical occurs.\n\n141\n00:07:12.187 --> 00:07:14.907\n>> Or even better,\nbecause Adobe is so exciting and\n\n142\n00:07:14.907 --> 00:07:19.017\nyou just wanna edit, why not just\nhave an automated process to do it?\n\n143\n00:07:19.017 --> 00:07:23.591\nSo I'm thinking about [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\nI'll think about the story I'm telling.\n\n144\n00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:27.391\nInstead of the saving, and\nit's like okay, that's great.\n\n145\n00:07:27.391 --> 00:07:31.053\nI love that, so\nI will send that to something else,\n\n146\n00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:34.023\nalso it's one of those things,\nmaybe I'm working and working and working,\n\n147\n00:07:34.023 --> 00:07:39.130\nand then I realize, okay,\nthis thing I just made Is terrible.\n\n148\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.140\nBut two weeks ago,\nI made this thing that was amazing and\n\n149\n00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.780\nif I go back in the autosaves,\nI can get it from there.\n\n150\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.998\nIt's like it's brilliant.\n\n151\n00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:49.165\n>> That's nice.\n>> Love it and it's like,\n\n152\n00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:50.630\nokay here's some more for two weeks or so,\n\n153\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.314\neven better and\nI'll start working from there.\n\n154\n00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:53.058\nOkay?\n\n155\n00:07:53.058 --> 00:07:57.098\nYou also have the ability to do\nCreative Cloud library downloads.\n\n156\n00:07:57.098 --> 00:07:59.117\nAnd I'm gonna show you\nsome of those later,\n\n157\n00:07:59.117 --> 00:08:03.240\ncuz I made a couple in a side program\nthat's for free, that I did on my phone.\n\n158\n00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.690\nAnd I can load that library\ninto Adobe Premier.\n\n159\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.370\nSo, once I have this done,\nall I have to do is click OK.\n\n160\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.580\nAnd then we get the exciting part.\n\n161\n00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.050\nWe get the interface.\n\n162\n00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.004\nAnd it's like, yes, and there's all\nthe windows I can get all my stuff in.\n\n163\n00:08:16.004 --> 00:08:17.720\nBut then it's like I\nbetter check some stuff.\n\n164\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.910\nAnd what that checking stuff is,\nI come up to the top menu bar and\n\n165\n00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.750\nI go to Premier Pro > CC and\nI go to Preferences.\n\n166\n00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.419\nYou are gonna see there are a lot of them.\n\n167\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.380\nNow, Adobe is a wonderful dense program,\nand I have been using it for\n\n168\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.190\na very long time.\n\n169\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.250\nAnd, technically,\nI am a certified expert instructor.\n\n170\n00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.640\nBut there are some things in\nthis that I have never used\n\n171\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.730\nbecause they are very specialized for\ncertain types of work.\n\n172\n00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.562\nI mean, I've tried them,\nI've demoed them and I've used them, but\n\n173\n00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:50.270\nI don't use them on daily basis.\n\n174\n00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.403\nThat's why there are a lot of settings.\n\n175\n00:08:52.403 --> 00:08:58.200\nSome of them you will set, some of them\nyou will only look at at a specific time.\n\n176\n00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.170\nThe most important one is the top one.\n\n177\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.760\nCome here,\nlet's get to the right one there.\n\n178\n00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.220\nThank you Biddle.\n\n179\n00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.670\nWe're gonna go right to general, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.250\nAnd this is the most important\none that we are going to look at.\n\n181\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.140\nNow [BLANK AUDIO] Starting at the top and\nworking our way to the bottom.\n\n182\n00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.960\nI often tell people, if you get lost, top\nto bottom left to right, front to back.\n\n183\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.420\nJust like like you read a book, just\ngo at this like you're reading a book.\n\n184\n00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.580\nTop to bottom, left to right,\nfront to back.\n\n185\n00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.670\nSo, starting at the top of the general\narea, starting in the left,\n\n186\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.470\nI choose general.\n\n187\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.520\nGoing, and this is interesting,\nDan, I wore the blue shirt today\n\n188\n00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.740\nbecause blue is a very important\ncolor in the Adobe interface.\n\n189\n00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.430\n>> I did not know that.\n\n190\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.850\n>> It highlights what you're working with,\nand\n\n191\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:48.450\noccasionally if you see things\nin blue you can change that.\n\n192\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.110\nOkay?\n\n193\n00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.250\nSo that's very, very important.\n\n194\n00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.360\nSo start, it's like, at start up,\nshow the start screen.\n\n195\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.330\nThat's the thing that I just\nwalked everybody through.\n\n196\n00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.950\nIf you're one of those folks that wants\nto just click on the premier icon,\n\n197\n00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:11.390\nI just wanna get working, I can say just\nopen my most recent and go straight to it.\n\n198\n00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.950\nThe thing that's gonna be upsetting\nabout some of these settings\n\n199\n00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:23.820\nis that these will take place\nafter you have activated them.\n\n200\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.990\nSo let's take, for example,\nwhen opening a project,\n\n201\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:30.158\nshow the opening dialogue,\nshow the start screen.\n\n202\n00:10:30.158 --> 00:10:33.330\nThese are just, Adobe has defaulted it\nto what they think is the most common.\n\n203\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.150\nAnd in most cases, it is the most\ncommon thing that you're gonna do.\n\n204\n00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.260\nBut you can change them.\n\n205\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.320\nVideo transition duration.\n\n206\n00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.630\nRight now, if I create dissolves or\n\n207\n00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.770\nany other transition,\nit's going to be 30 frames.\n\n208\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.260\nNice thing is,\nI can change that to seconds.\n\n209\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.030\nAnd say I would like it to be\na certain amount of seconds,\n\n210\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.560\nlike I want all of them to\nbe three seconds in length.\n\n211\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.140\nWhy?\nI have no idea.\n\n212\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.620\nSo, I'll go back to frames and\njust say, yeah, 30 frames.\n\n213\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.700\nI can do that,\nthe same thing with audio transitions.\n\n214\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.700\nI can say frames,\nmake that 30 frames or change it.\n\n215\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.750\nSometimes I like to do really\nshort audio transitions, so\n\n216\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.424\nI'll make that a five, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:12.424 --> 00:11:14.060\nNow, what this does not do.\n\n218\n00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.130\nSo, Dan, let's say I've already\ncreated a sequence, and\n\n219\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:23.400\nI have all of these nice little audio\ntransitions, and they're all 30 frames.\n\n220\n00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.170\nAnd I say, I go back, and it's like\nI wanted those to be five frames,\n\n221\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.240\nand I change it.\n\n222\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.100\nIt changes nothing that I've already done.\n\n223\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.830\nThis will change what\nI'm going to do next.\n\n224\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.180\n>> So it won't take effect until you-\n>> Won't take effect.\n\n225\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.670\n>> Anything you've done before,\nthat's all still gonna be the same?\n\n226\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.221\n>> Right,\nit's all still gonna be the same.\n\n227\n00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:42.183\nAnd that,\nI know some people find that frustrating.\n\n228\n00:11:42.183 --> 00:11:45.455\nBut it's, then all I have to do is just go\nget those out and put the new [INAUDIBLE].\n\n229\n00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:45.955\n>> Well, I mean,\n\n230\n00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.492\nit makes sense if you think about it\nbecause Adobe's not assuming that you want\n\n231\n00:11:48.492 --> 00:11:49.960\nto change everything you've already done.\n\n232\n00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.079\nThey assume that now that\nyou've changed a setting,\n\n233\n00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.940\nyou wanna change it from here on out.\n\n234\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.590\n>> Exactly.\n\n235\n00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:59.340\nAdobe wants you, their whole philosophy\nis, they want you to create the story,\n\n236\n00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.380\nthey wanna help you create the story.\n\n237\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.900\nAnd they feel like if they did that,\nthey'd be taking over the story.\n\n238\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.054\nSo, that's, I mean,\nthat's part of the psychology, and\n\n239\n00:12:08.054 --> 00:12:09.460\nthat's why I like working with this.\n\n240\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.270\nStill image default duration.\n\n241\n00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.270\nThis is if you wanna do this really cool\nthing like you bring in still photos and\n\n242\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.440\nthen you wanna animate them, and\nmake them fly and blow them up.\n\n243\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.640\nRight now, every still image that I\nbring up will be five seconds long.\n\n244\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:29.400\nI can extend that to, let's say,\nI want them to be 360 seconds.\n\n245\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.550\nYeah, I mean, I can make the still images\nvery, very long so I can work with them.\n\n246\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.897\nThese are where you start getting\ninto some real preference things,\n\n247\n00:12:38.897 --> 00:12:40.487\nlike timeline, playback, auto scrolling.\n\n248\n00:12:40.487 --> 00:12:45.420\nI'm gonna go over later, cuz until you\nsee it, it doesn't make any sense.\n\n249\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.010\nSame thing with vertical mouse scrolling.\n\n250\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.750\nYou might just find that there are certain\nthings that you do, that it's like\n\n251\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.030\nI wanna be able to do this, and\nyou can make it happen here.\n\n252\n00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.430\nWhich is nice, it's really nice\nthat you can customize the system\n\n253\n00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.810\nas much as you want, so that way,\nyou're focusing on the story.\n\n254\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:05.630\nAll right.\n\n255\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:10.470\nSet focus on the timeline when\nperforming in certain overwrite edits.\n\n256\n00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.518\nThat is something that we're gonna, once\nwe start editing that you're gonna wanna\n\n257\n00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:16.890\nsee cuz this can be frustrating for\npeople.\n\n258\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.780\nSome people like it one way,\nsome people like it the other.\n\n259\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.905\nBasically, this is just\nall general setting of\n\n260\n00:13:23.905 --> 00:13:27.365\nhow to make this thing work best for you.\n\n261\n00:13:27.365 --> 00:13:30.335\nAnd general is the best way to start.\n\n262\n00:13:30.335 --> 00:13:33.915\nThe one that I really\nwant to focus on that,\n\n263\n00:13:33.915 --> 00:13:37.410\nonce I bring in some still photos\nthat I've shot, that you really,\n\n264\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.500\nreally wanna take a look at is this one\ncalled default scale to frame size.\n\n265\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.140\nIn most cases, you want this off\nbecause what you're looking to do,\n\n266\n00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.290\nand I took some pictures\nwith a Canon 5D Mark III.\n\n267\n00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.100\n>> That's a nice camera.\n\n268\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.500\n>> Yeah, it's very nice and it's not mine.\n\n269\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.230\nIt's my friend's.\n\n270\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.930\nHe let me borrow it,\nwith a really nice lens.\n\n271\n00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:04.180\nAnd this project is going to be,\nI'm just gonna try and do this.\n\n272\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.000\nIt's gonna be like 1080.\n\n273\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.940\nOkay, it's gonna be 1920 by 1080.\n\n274\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:12.100\nThese pictures are going to be\nlike huge compared to that.\n\n275\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:17.680\nIf I say default scale to frame\nsize is off, when I bring\n\n276\n00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.610\nin those images, they're not going to\ndefault size down to 1920 by 1080,\n\n277\n00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:27.380\nthey're gonna stay this size and that way\nI can animate them, cuz they're oversized.\n\n278\n00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.350\nOkay, they're gonna oversize that way.\n\n279\n00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.520\nIf I turn it on,\neverything's gonna get reduced.\n\n280\n00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.930\nAnd then,\nI'm not gonna have the resolution,\n\n281\n00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.760\nI'm not gonna be able to\nplay around with that.\n\n282\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.600\nThat is why it is automatically off.\n\n283\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.580\nAnd that is why, in most cases,\nyou wanna leave it automatically off.\n\n284\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.350\nCuz you took these giant pictures.\n\n285\n00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.070\nWhy don't you just get in there and\nanimate them, okay?\n\n286\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.425\nSo, that's about all I'm gonna\ndo in the General section.\n\n287\n00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:52.195\nAppearance.\n\n288\n00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:53.695\nThis one is hard, okay?\n\n289\n00:14:53.695 --> 00:14:57.065\nThis is a rough one.\n\n290\n00:14:57.065 --> 00:14:58.175\nOkay, that's better.\n\n291\n00:14:58.175 --> 00:15:02.460\nThis is basically, do I want my\ninterface brighter, do I want it darker.\n\n292\n00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.020\nI can change the highlight\ncolor a little bit,\n\n293\n00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.900\nI can make the kind of darker\n[INAUDIBLE] interactive controls.\n\n294\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:15.150\nIt's really what you want and\nwhat you like in terms of how your user\n\n295\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.648\ninterface appears in terms of light dark-\n>> Gives you a personalization-\n\n296\n00:15:18.648 --> 00:15:20.690\n>> Give you a little personalization,\n\n297\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.060\ndon't go too wacky.\n\n298\n00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.480\nI've seen some really strange things.\n\n299\n00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:30.661\nIf it's so\nbizarre that your head hurts, okay?\n\n300\n00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:32.655\nI mean, it's like, okay?\n\n301\n00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:33.210\nAudio.\n\n302\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:37.280\nA lot of this can be fun to play around\nwith, but I will give you this right now.\n\n303\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.560\nMost of what is set in here\nis pretty much what you want.\n\n304\n00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.221\nThe thing that people want\nto know initially is what is\n\n305\n00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:50.220\nmute input during timeline recording?\n\n306\n00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.326\nWhat is automatic audio\nwave form generation?\n\n307\n00:15:53.326 --> 00:15:54.905\nAnd what is this default audio track?\n\n308\n00:15:54.905 --> 00:15:57.890\nThis is the one that people\nare most concerned with.\n\n309\n00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.604\nSo Mute input during\ntimeline recording means,\n\n310\n00:16:00.604 --> 00:16:06.050\nremember I mentioned that I could do a\nvoiceover, I could read into a microphone.\n\n311\n00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:10.670\nIf this is off,\nwhatever audio might be in the timeline,\n\n312\n00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.115\nlike music or another person speaking,\nI can hear In the headphones or\n\n313\n00:16:15.115 --> 00:16:18.845\nthrough the computer speakers while\nI'm trying to do this voiceover.\n\n314\n00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:21.915\nSo I might say, no, I don't want to hear\nany of that or I'm gonna flub it up, and\n\n315\n00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:24.305\nI had to do it 19 times and\nI'm gonna have all these terrible files.\n\n316\n00:16:24.305 --> 00:16:25.995\nSo you can turn that off.\n\n317\n00:16:25.995 --> 00:16:31.330\nAutomatic audio waveform generation, I'm\nsure if you've gotten into this before,\n\n318\n00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.230\nyou know that there's little audio\nwave forms on the tracks, okay.\n\n319\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.730\nYou have the ability to turn it off,\nin a sense.\n\n320\n00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.740\nWhy, you don't have enough RAM, okay,\nyou're working on a low computer, and\n\n321\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.630\nyou don't want them generated\nuntil you absolutely need them.\n\n322\n00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.850\n>> So this is all about\nreclaiming some system resources-\n\n323\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:48.520\n>> Saving some space.\n\n324\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.968\nSaving some space for yourself,\nalso default audio tracks.\n\n325\n00:16:52.968 --> 00:16:56.968\nWhen we get into audio this\nis gonna start making sense,\n\n326\n00:16:56.968 --> 00:17:01.136\nbecause a lot of what people\nkind of get confused with, and\n\n327\n00:17:01.136 --> 00:17:06.600\nI don't really blame you, in that Adobe,\nyou can have two audios in a clip.\n\n328\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.333\nBut then when you put it in a timeline,\nyou get one track, and\n\n329\n00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:13.094\nthat kind of throws people.\n\n330\n00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:15.120\nAnd I'm gonna go through\nthe Adobe psychology.\n\n331\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.020\nOnce you get it down,\nit's actually really nice\n\n332\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.870\nto be able to just work in\nsingle tracks but dual sources.\n\n333\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.860\nBut this gives you a chance to change that\nif you don't like, if you want mono media\n\n334\n00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:33.320\nto actually come in as mono and not\nnecessarily use the file's protocol, okay.\n\n335\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.840\nSo you get a chance to do that as well.\n\n336\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.501\nCouple of things, the AutoSave.\n\n337\n00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:43.122\nAll right, this is where I’m saying\nautomatically do it every 15 minutes, no,\n\n338\n00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:44.600\ndo it every five.\n\n339\n00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.420\nAnd let me see what the maximum is.\n\n340\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.790\nI always like playing around with\nhow many are they gonna give me.\n\n341\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.089\nI just did something that\nreally frustrates people and\n\n342\n00:17:53.089 --> 00:17:54.507\nI wanted to demonstrate this.\n\n343\n00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:58.007\nAs soon as I entered a number, and\n\n344\n00:17:58.007 --> 00:18:03.450\ndid return,\nit clicked out of the settings.\n\n345\n00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.940\nThis happens to me all the time,\nokay, don't worry about this, okay.\n\n346\n00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.580\nCan I do 999 and just click out?\n\n347\n00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:14.130\nYes, I can have 999 projects,\nlet's see if I can go higher.\n\n348\n00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.405\nThis is the funny,\nthis is the fun part about Adobe,\n\n349\n00:18:16.405 --> 00:18:17.922\nis what are they allowing me to do?\n\n350\n00:18:17.922 --> 00:18:18.674\nI'm going higher.\n\n351\n00:18:18.674 --> 00:18:19.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is great.\n\n352\n00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.516\nSo what this means is that on\nthe auto-saves, as soon as I hit 1,000\n\n353\n00:18:23.516 --> 00:18:28.160\nauto-saves and I go to 1,001,\nthe oldest one then gets removed.\n\n354\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.110\n>> So first in, first out?\n\n355\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.330\n>> First in, first out.\n\n356\n00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.910\nSo, I could say I want so\nmany that the first in,\n\n357\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.360\nfirst out isn't gonna take effect\nuntil I have 1,000 backups.\n\n358\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.204\n>> Gonna run out of storage space.\n\n359\n00:18:38.204 --> 00:18:39.705\n[LAUGH]\n>> Gonna run out of storage space.\n\n360\n00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:42.070\n[LAUGH] The other thing I can also do,\noops, sorry about that.\n\n361\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.810\nI love playing with this.\n\n362\n00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.540\nI can save the backup to\nmy Creative Cloud account.\n\n363\n00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.470\nOkay, save it to my Creative Cloud\naccount as well which is-\n\n364\n00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.116\n>> It's doing it in conjunction with\n\n365\n00:18:53.116 --> 00:18:55.100\nthe save to the local source?\n\n366\n00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.460\n>> So, I'll demonstrate that.\n\n367\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.399\nI will demonstrate that\nas we start working.\n\n368\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.550\nControl Surface is another one.\n\n369\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:06.209\nIf you want to,\na lot of people like really nice\n\n370\n00:19:06.209 --> 00:19:10.761\ncolor control services or\nan audio service.\n\n371\n00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:12.167\nYou can add that here.\n\n372\n00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:16.150\nYou can also do some Device Controls\nif you're working with the tape deck.\n\n373\n00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.160\nSo, if your deck sub type you\ncould control it from here.\n\n374\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.930\nLabels, this is an interesting one.\n\n375\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.410\nEverything gets a label, so if I go\ndown the Label Defaults, if it's a bin,\n\n376\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.810\nit's mango,\nif it's a sequence it's forest.\n\n377\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.300\nI have to kinda go through this, people,\n\n378\n00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.910\nthis is fun cuz you can\ncolor code everything.\n\n379\n00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.330\nSometimes I like color codes.\n\n380\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.460\nI have a friend, he doesn't, so\nhe just changes all of these to white or\n\n381\n00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.940\nanother innocuous color which is fine,\nwhich you can do.\n\n382\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.760\nThe thing that it does not do,\nthat kinda throws people.\n\n383\n00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.560\nLet's say I go and I change this color and\nI just change it to green.\n\n384\n00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:57.955\nIt still says violet, so it's not going to\nchange it to the name of the actual color.\n\n385\n00:19:57.955 --> 00:20:00.010\n[LAUGH] So that's really\na label on the left-hand side.\n\n386\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.950\n>> It's just a label on the left-hand side\nand people get really upset about that.\n\n387\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.390\nThey're like, wait a minute, it's not\nchanged, well, it's not supposed to.\n\n388\n00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.910\nSo the label defaults are, the bin is\nmango, the sequences probably can change,\n\n389\n00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:16.040\nand I can say, no, I want bins to be\nrose The thing that they do that I think\n\n390\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.890\nis very nice, especially when you get your\nsequence into the timeline, your video and\n\n391\n00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.740\nyour audio are different colors.\n\n392\n00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.277\nSo that way, occasionally when\nyou look at a sequence and\n\n393\n00:20:27.277 --> 00:20:30.526\nyou just see all the same color, you're-\n>> What's what?\n\n394\n00:20:30.526 --> 00:20:31.162\n>> What's what?\n\n395\n00:20:31.162 --> 00:20:32.295\nIt's like, colors.\n\n396\n00:20:32.295 --> 00:20:33.480\nColors work, so I can do that.\n\n397\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.740\nMedia, the only thing I really\nwant to cover in this one,\n\n398\n00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.280\nif people wanna dig around into it later,\nthey can.\n\n399\n00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.700\nOccasionally you have a thing called\na cache, and what this means is\n\n400\n00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.350\nyou might open up Premier and\ndown in the little right-hand portion\n\n401\n00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.780\nof the user interface, there's this\nlittle narrow line that just keeps going.\n\n402\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.450\nIt's building.\n\n403\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.600\nYou may have moved a drive somewhere or\nyou may have erased something.\n\n404\n00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.162\nAnd what it's doing is it's\nrebuilding waveforms or\n\n405\n00:21:07.162 --> 00:21:11.841\nit's rebuilding some files that\nare needed for things like H264.\n\n406\n00:21:11.841 --> 00:21:14.936\nThey're called cache files.\n\n407\n00:21:14.936 --> 00:21:20.090\nOccasionally these build up and\nyou might have to clean them.\n\n408\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.410\nAnd you just say clean them out and\nstart fresh.\n\n409\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.310\nSo that's what you wanna do.\n\n410\n00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.060\nNow you wanna make sure that if\nyou're doing this with drives,\n\n411\n00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.090\nyou want the drive attached cuz it's\nonly gonna throw away the cache\n\n412\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.200\nfiles that you don't need any more.\n\n413\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.525\nIf the drive's not attached, it's going\nto throw away all the cache files,\n\n414\n00:21:38.525 --> 00:21:40.925\nwhich is fine,\nit just has to rebuild them.\n\n415\n00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:44.205\nIt just has to rebuild everything,\nwhich just can be time consuming.\n\n416\n00:21:44.205 --> 00:21:46.005\nOkay, that's just a timing issue.\n\n417\n00:21:47.895 --> 00:21:52.880\nThe next one is sync settings, cuz since\neverybody's using the Creative Cloud now,\n\n418\n00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.190\nhow do you want to sync\nyour Creative Cloud?\n\n419\n00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.970\nWhich is a nice setting instead of\njust saying we sync it this way.\n\n420\n00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.440\nThat's not what Adobe likes to do.\n\n421\n00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.120\nAdobe likes to say no,\nhow do you want to do this?\n\n422\n00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.070\nAnd you can say, I have the preferences,\nthe settings, the workspace layouts, and\n\n423\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.700\nthe keyboard shortcuts get saved.\n\n424\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.770\nThose go to my Creative Cloud account.\n\n425\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.700\nAnd then when syncing, ask my preference.\n\n426\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.540\nDo I always wanna upload,\ndo I always wanna download settings?\n\n427\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.280\nOr do I wanna say automatically clear\nthe settings on the application quit?\n\n428\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.340\nWhich means if I'm on someone else's\ncomputer and my Creative Cloud's\n\n429\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.130\non there and it's like I'm gonna leave,\nI want my stuff cleared off of it.\n\n430\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.370\nIt's not because I don't like them,\n\n431\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.420\nbut they're probably going to\nsay why is this stuff on here?\n\n432\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.393\nThat's very weird of you\nto leave your stuff behind.\n\n433\n00:22:38.393 --> 00:22:39.478\n>> Yeah.\n\n434\n00:22:39.478 --> 00:22:41.580\n>> Which we are all\nlearning with the Internet.\n\n435\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:46.310\nSo, I have made a lot of these settings.\n\n436\n00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.580\nI'm happy now, now what?\n\n437\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.410\nNow, I'm gonna get in and I'm gonna\nbring some media in this actual thing.\n\n438\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.546\nAnd I think you and I are gonna end up\ndoing that next time where we actually\n\n439\n00:22:57.546 --> 00:23:00.737\nbring in some media and play around\nwith this interface because you may say\n\n440\n00:23:00.737 --> 00:23:02.770\nI don't, it's just moving everywhere.\n\n441\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.550\nHow do I make it look like something\nthat I want to use instead of this?\n\n442\n00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:10.290\n>> Yeah, this is a little amorphous maybe.\n\n443\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.820\n>> Well, you know, yeah.\n\n444\n00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.380\nAnd so next time it's like how do I,\nI just did all these settings so\n\n445\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.030\nthat it's internally awesome,\nhow do we do the settings so\n\n446\n00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.230\nnow it's externally awesome\nis what we're looking at.\n\n447\n00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.270\n>> Well, awesome stuff, James.\n\n448\n00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.900\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun,\ngreat demonstrations.\n\n449\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.430\nNow, that we've kinda gotten inside of\nthe car, we've looked at all the bells and\n\n450\n00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.570\nwhistles and knobs we can turn to see what\nit's gonna do, and now we understand that,\n\n451\n00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.300\nwe can move on to more complex things.\n\n452\n00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.060\nJames, looks like we've come\nto the end of a great episode.\n\n453\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.080\nWe really appreciate you dropping by.\n\n454\n00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.240\n>> We gotta come back cuz I wanna do\nthe next one cuz I've got this now.\n\n455\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.280\n>> We are gonna come back.\n\n456\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.930\nWe're gonna have plenty more.\n\n457\n00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.060\nBut for this one though looks\nlike we run out of time.\n\n458\n00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.231\nSo you'll have to come back and\n\n459\n00:23:49.231 --> 00:23:51.269\nsee where James take us down\nthe Adobe Premiere road.\n\n460\n00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:52.937\n>> Yes, do.\n\n461\n00:23:52.937 --> 00:23:55.329\n>> That being said,\nwe're gonna again sign off for ITProTV.\n\n462\n00:23:55.329 --> 00:23:57.028\nI've

exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.540\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.620\nIn today's episode we're considering our\nPremiere Pro series sending us back in\n\n6\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.280\nthe studio again today for\na little more about the user interface,\n\n7\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.400\nour good friend Mr.\nJames Biddle, James, welcome back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.910\n>> Hey.\n>> We're super excited to have\n\n9\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.460\nyou here today.\n\n10\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.700\n>> Me too.\n>> What we're gonna learn?\n\n11\n00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.071\n>> Well now it's the interface.\n\n12\n00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:34.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean this is even more fun.\n\n13\n00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.310\nI mean we talked about customizing,\nsome of the internal settings.\n\n14\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.150\n>> And you're like yeah, that was great.\n\n15\n00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.380\nNow we really wanna get into\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.040\n>> What does it look like, and\n\n17\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.890\nhow can I make it look different?\n\n18\n00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.980\nSo a lot of us, we used to call\nthis the big chocolate bar.\n\n19\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.730\nCuz looks like it's so delicious and\nwe wanna get in there.\n\n20\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.360\n>> Break a piece off.\n\n21\n00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.425\n>> Break a piece off, man.\n\n22\n00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:54.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I wanna kinda go over what\n\n23\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.050\nthe language is and how you\n>> You can change it so\n\n24\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.910\nthey could be really cool for you.\n\n25\n00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.640\nSo let me just zoom in real quick.\n\n26\n00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.600\nI wanna make one thing,\nit is kinda boring.\n\n27\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.175\nLike I said,\nsometimes if you're lost go to the top.\n\n28\n00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:10.525\n>> And then in this case,\n\n29\n00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:16.875\nat the top of the interface you can\nalways see where is this project?\n\n30\n00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:19.275\nAnd it's right there,\nit's telling me okay.\n\n31\n00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:22.657\nIt's under my drive in this\nlessons folder I created.\n\n32\n00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:27.727\nThat's the name of it and\nit gets that .prproj.\n\n33\n00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:31.787\nSo occasionally if, this is kind\nof a trick, sometimes people say,\n\n34\n00:01:31.787 --> 00:01:34.880\nI don't know where stuff is and\nI really like using the finder.\n\n35\n00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.310\nThere is ways to not use the finder, but\nthere are some people who love the finder.\n\n36\n00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.690\nAbsolutely fine with that.\n\n37\n00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.630\nIf you remember to search under prproj,\nyou will find projects.\n\n38\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.630\nAnd it's really cool.\n\n39\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.560\nSo, let's look at the entire thing here.\n\n40\n00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.440\nThe first thing we usually start with,\nare the panels themselves.\n\n41\n00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.810\nNow, you're gonna say,\n\n42\n00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.630\nif I come to window In the user\ninterface these are windows right?\n\n43\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.160\nWell yeah there's sort of\na double language to it.\n\n44\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.660\nSo they're windows but\n\n45\n00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.560\nlet me just jump over here to the one\nthat says Source up at the top.\n\n46\n00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.430\nAnd there's a little control menu here,\nyou might hear people call it the stack of\n\n47\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.020\npapers or the stack of pancakes it\nlooks like a line of menu choices and\n\n48\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.700\nthis says panel okay this says panel so\n\n49\n00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.150\nthis highlighted blue area,\nblue shirt, blue being very important,\n\n50\n00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.150\nthat's the panel area and\nI can close this, I can undock it.\n\n51\n00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.260\nThe one that I really like is they have\nthis thing called close other panels\n\n52\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.340\nin the group.\n\n53\n00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.700\nThere might be a bunch of\nstuff in here I don’t want and\n\n54\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.560\nnow I see is the source one.\n\n55\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.440\nSo I get to start kinda clean which\nis neat also there are panel groups.\n\n56\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.290\nSettings and\nyou can have stacked panel groups.\n\n57\n00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.140\nAnd you can now have what\nare called small tabs.\n\n58\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.640\nSo gets even cooler with\nwhat you can do with this.\n\n59\n00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.370\nSo in a general way what am I trying to do\nSo this is currently my editing workspace.\n\n60\n00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.200\nI'm gonna go back up here.\n\n61\n00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.400\nAnd it says, Workspaces.\n\n62\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.380\nAnd I have one called All Panels,\nAssembly, Audio, Color.\n\n63\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.010\nAll of these are pre-built by Adobe, and\n\n64\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.750\nthey're generally a pretty\ngood generic interface.\n\n65\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.820\nFor all of them, but then Adobe's\nlike you don't have to settle for\n\n66\n00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.090\nthat, you can make your own.\n\n67\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.123\nSo I'm going to go to the interface,\nit has the dot,\n\n68\n00:03:28.123 --> 00:03:31.320\nand now I am going to make\nsomething that I want.\n\n69\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.130\nI will come down here to the project Area.\n\n70\n00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.740\nOkay so\nthis is sort of the project area and\n\n71\n00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.680\nthere's a thing here\ncalled the Media Browser.\n\n72\n00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.830\nLet's say I don't like\nthe Media Browser in here.\n\n73\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.110\nI like it up by the source.\n\n74\n00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.840\nWhy?\n\n75\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.340\nIt doesn't matter why.\n\n76\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.080\nIt's what you like.\n\n77\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.310\nSo zoom back.\n\n78\n00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.150\nI'm just gonna click and hold that on\nthe word mia browser, and then move it.\n\n79\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.720\nAnd this is where the purple\nstarts to happen.\n\n80\n00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.270\nWhat I'm going to do, is place this\nwithin the servers panel area,\n\n81\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.030\nthat's why source is lit up.\n\n82\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.700\nNothing else in the user interface,\n\n83\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.300\njust the panel area of source,\nthe source panel area.\n\n84\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.639\nIf I drop it in the direct Center, boom.\n\n85\n00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:25.620\nIt is now a panel within here.\n\n86\n00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.790\nIt's now a panel within there.\n\n87\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.400\nLet me go ahead and undock it.\n\n88\n00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.140\nOnce I undock it, it's free floating.\n\n89\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.470\nIt's floating all over the place.\n\n90\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.830\nSo, if you have a two screen\nsystem this is great.\n\n91\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.420\nYou can undock panels and\nput them in the two screen.\n\n92\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.120\n>> So, going back to my automobile analogy\nthat we talked about in the last show.\n\n93\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.510\n>> Yeah.\n>> Where we learned what everything does.\n\n94\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.110\nNow we're saying, if you want the steering\nwheel in the back seat of the right hand\n\n95\n00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.590\nside of the car and that's what\nyou like then that's what you do.\n\n96\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.860\n>> Yeah, I want the\n>> Modify some of the changes in windows,\n\n97\n00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.640\nI want those really myriads of comments.\n\n98\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.409\nI want all that stuff and\nthat essentially what I'm doing\n\n99\n00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:59.620\n>> It's pretty cool\n\n100\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.702\n>> I want big dragon painted on the side\n\n101\n00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:08.145\n[CROSSTALK] what you may want to do,\nis you might want to say these\n\n102\n00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:13.506\ntwo panels here, the program and\nthe source are side by side.\n\n103\n00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:18.585\nI'd like this media browser panel\nto be on the side of the source and\n\n104\n00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:25.160\nthat's where if I do that purple like to\nthe side now there are these three panels.\n\n105\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.440\nSide by side source program media browser.\n\n106\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.680\nSome people really, really like that.\n\n107\n00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.360\nSo you go from one, two, three.\n\n108\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.610\nIt's like left to right completely.\n\n109\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.050\nSome people absolutely loved that and\nit allows you to do that.\n\n110\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.780\nSo you can put it on the top, left,\nright or bottom of the actual panel.\n\n111\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.980\nNow you're not limited To that.\n\n112\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.830\nYou can also say what if I want it to\nthe complete side of the interface.\n\n113\n00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.630\nAnd one thing we usually do with that\nare the audio meters, over here.\n\n114\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.360\nI can say these are very small.\n\n115\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.270\nIf I just click at the top and\nI get the blue, it's a blue highlight and\n\n116\n00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.600\nthen I just move.\n\n117\n00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.270\nOkay.\n\n118\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.030\nSometimes this is then\nsometimes that hard.\n\n119\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.850\nI didn't really grab it quite right.\n\n120\n00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.550\nCome here, come here you.\n\n121\n00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.120\nCome here.\n\n122\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.630\nOkay, go.\nOkay, good now it's moving.\n\n123\n00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.450\nWatch what happens if I move it\nall the way, I get a green line.\n\n124\n00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.150\nSo I have a green line here now.\n\n125\n00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.220\nI can have it on the left and\non the right, the top.\n\n126\n00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.490\nOnce I do it where the green line is,\nboom, I have put it to the side\n\n127\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.290\nof the entire interface and you'll notice\nthe interface kinda squeezes over.\n\n128\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.540\nAnd I can get this little\nicon any time I want to.\n\n129\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.480\nOnce I've put it on the line,\nI get that one.\n\n130\n00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.160\nAnd we know that that's a resized icon.\n\n131\n00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.210\nAnd I'm just gonna squeeze this down.\n\n132\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.130\nCome here you.\n\n133\n00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.230\nCome here.\n\n134\n00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.930\nYeah, there we go, squish.\n\n135\n00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.290\nAnd now I have these Giant\naudio meters over here.\n\n136\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.950\nAnd I could say, I love this.\n\n137\n00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.140\nThis is the best, its the best thing ever.\n\n138\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.880\nSo, if I come over to Window,\nWorkspaces and\n\n139\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:10.400\nI say I would like to save\nthis as a new workspace.\n\n140\n00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.220\nOkay?\nI want this as a brand new workspace, and\n\n141\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.250\nI'm going to give it a name,\nuntitled workspace is a terrible name.\n\n142\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.085\nI'm going to call this Big audio.\n\n143\n00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:25.292\nAnd click okay.\n\n144\n00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:31.024\nAnd it's highlighted now, okay?\n\n145\n00:07:31.024 --> 00:07:33.690\nIf I have it in this bar area,\nit says, big audio.\n\n146\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.300\nNotice it's blue!\n\n147\n00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.620\nIf it's blue,\nthat's what I'm working with.\n\n148\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.280\nIt's great.\n\n149\n00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.590\nIf I go back to editing,\npeople are generally like, wait a minute.\n\n150\n00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.390\nThis looks like big audio.\n\n151\n00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.709\nWell that's because you\nchanged the editing interface.\n\n152\n00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.270\nAll I have to do is say\nplease in workspaces reset\n\n153\n00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.700\nthis editing workspace back to the saved\nlayout which is the one you got before.\n\n154\n00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.890\nBoom.\n\n155\n00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.240\nNow I wanted to change that\nediting layout itself and say,\n\n156\n00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.590\nI want this editing layout to always\nlook like this, the one call editing.\n\n157\n00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.530\nThen I would've said,\nsave changes to this workspace,\n\n158\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.390\nwhich was the editing workspace.\n\n159\n00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.210\nI didn't want that.\n\n160\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.720\nI wanted to turn a new one.\n\n161\n00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.140\nOkay?\n\n162\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.670\nI also have the ability\nto edit the workspaces.\n\n163\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:28.430\nAs in, I say this, I could have\nalso claimed that from over here.\n\n164\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.650\nI could have, let me just cancel this.\n\n165\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.660\nOften people wonder, what are these?\n\n166\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.530\nWell, they're arrows.\n\n167\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:42.190\nThis is known as the overflow area,\nif you have too many Panels in an area.\n\n168\n00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.240\nIt'll say okay, it's overflowing.\n\n169\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.610\nYou have all panels and\nmetalogging available.\n\n170\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.840\nAnd this will be also if you wanna\ndo it sometimes in the source or\n\n171\n00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.120\nin the project window,\nthe exact same thing will happen.\n\n172\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.200\nYou have too many panels in there and\nyou'll say overflow.\n\n173\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.430\nThere's my history.\n\n174\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.350\n>> I see that on web browsers,\nyou get so many tabs open.\n\n175\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.880\n>> Same thing.\n\n176\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.960\n>> Little arrow pointing.\n\n177\n00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.600\n>> Little arrow, used to be\na little slider which was okay, but\n\n178\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.090\nit was hard to see and\nthen Adobe said you know what,\n\n179\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.580\nwe're gonna do this and\nit was a brilliant change.\n\n180\n00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.580\nAnd I can say Edit Workspaces from here,\ntoo.\n\n181\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.290\nI don't have to go back up there.\n\n182\n00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.630\nAnd then, I can do stuff like this.\n\n183\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.420\nIt's like, I'm very,\nvery particular about having things.\n\n184\n00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.860\nI don't know what people say.\n\n185\n00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.700\nIt needs to be in alphabetical order.\n\n186\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.570\nSo, I'll say, okay.\n\n187\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.830\nSo, that means Audio comes after Assembly.\n\n188\n00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.510\nAnd then Color comes before Editing and\nthen library comes before Titles and\n\n189\n00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.050\nBigAudio comes after Audio.\n\n190\n00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.610\nOkay?\n\n191\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.730\nAnd I'll click okay, and\nit's all been sorted that way.\n\n192\n00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.210\nIt'll be sorted there.\n\n193\n00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.840\nIt'll also be sorted In here,\nthe exact same way.\n\n194\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.300\n>> Very cool.\n>> So, if people like it in\n\n195\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.750\nalphabetical order,\nthey can do it that way as well.\n\n196\n00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.320\nOr it's like, I'm going to put my windows\nat the top, because my windows rule.\n\n197\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.810\nYou can also, in at work spaces, get rid\nof stuff that you don't want to see, okay.\n\n198\n00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.020\nYou can get rid of stuff that\nyou don't want to see in there.\n\n199\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.130\nOr you can pop things\nin the overflow menu.\n\n200\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.330\nThey give you so\nmany choices of things that you can do.\n\n201\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.880\nIt's really really nice.\n\n202\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.675\n>> And I understand that we're\ntalking personalization here, right?\n\n203\n00:10:11.675 --> 00:10:12.380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What's good for\n\n204\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.510\nthe goose might not be good for\n\n205\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.580\nthe gander but-\n>> Right.\n\n206\n00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.480\n>> Is there a way that you see these\nthings getting set up that is,\n\n207\n00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.600\nfor lack of a better term,\nindustry standard,\n\n208\n00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.440\nwhere if I go from one shop-\n>> Right.\n\n209\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.900\n>> To another, I'm typically\ngonna see it laid out like this.\n\n210\n00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.920\n>> Right.\n\n211\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.720\nI will say this, about Adobe.\n\n212\n00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.260\nThey've done a really good job\nof doing sort of the default\n\n213\n00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.420\ninterface as what we often\ncall the clock space, okay?\n\n214\n00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.090\nAs in, we're starting at\nthe project window down here.\n\n215\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.630\nLet me highlight that in blue.\n\n216\n00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.630\nAnd usually we take things\nfrom the project window, and\n\n217\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:50.750\nwe go into the source and\nthen program and timeline.\n\n218\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.100\nSo like I said it was that top to bottom,\n\n219\n00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.510\nleft to right type of flow\nthat usually works best.\n\n220\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.510\nThat is also why I see a lot of folks and\nwhat they do is since project is down\n\n221\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.990\nhere and I'll take the project panel and\nI put it to the side of source, so\n\n222\n00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.890\nthey're reminding themselves, okay,\nso I'm going from here to here.\n\n223\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.350\nHere to here.\n\n224\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.200\n>> Gotcha.\n\n225\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.940\n>> Now,\none of the last things I wanna show that\n\n226\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:22.990\nonce people understand this button, they\nabsolutely love it and then I love it too.\n\n227\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.270\nBecause yes, these panels are small.\n\n228\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.270\nThey're small panels.\n\n229\n00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.636\nIf I put my mouse over these panel and\nI know a lot of people.\n\n230\n00:11:31.636 --> 00:11:35.110\nYou love your mouse,\nyou love your pad i love it too.\n\n231\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.420\nI want these people know I love high keys.\n\n232\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.530\nI love high keys and\n\n233\n00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.980\nif you only learn like ten in Adobe that's\ncool because that's the only ten you know.\n\n234\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.070\nI've seen people that will do this\nelaborate keyboards and then make some and\n\n235\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.190\nthen they forget.\n\n236\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.640\nIf you do ten that you remember,\nyou're set.\n\n237\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:00.000\nOne of the ones that you should remember,\nright below the escape key is tilde and\n\n238\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.510\nI think it's grove accent, none of us\nremember what it's actually called.\n\n239\n00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.090\nI think we get in debates over it.\n\n240\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.640\nBut if I place my mouse over this, and\n\n241\n00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.330\nthen hit that button, whatever was\nunder the mouse goes to full screen.\n\n242\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.520\nIt will give you a full\nscreen view immediately.\n\n243\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.760\nNot only that, when I click it\nagain that's the highlighted item.\n\n244\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.300\nSo if I come over here to\nsay the media browser,\n\n245\n00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.280\nif I come down to the media browser,\ndo the exact same thing and then go back\n\n246\n00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.940\nwith the tilde key, that is now the window\nthat is highlighted and active to use.\n\n247\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.190\nSo this is one of those amazing things.\n\n248\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.910\nThat get used to it and love it.\n\n249\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.770\nBut then you say, I don't like\nit being all the way up there.\n\n250\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.180\nI don't like that key being\nall the way up there.\n\n251\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:52.680\nI hate it.\n\n252\n00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.920\nWell, okay,\nput it some place where you like it.\n\n253\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.839\nThat's another setting.\n\n254\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.990\nIf I go up to the top, Premiere Pro,\nand I say keyboard shortcuts, okay.\n\n255\n00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.770\nWe're now in the keyboard shortcuts area,\n\n256\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.510\nand it's gonna say\nthe Adobe Premiere default layout.\n\n257\n00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.530\nYou can learn the default layout.\n\n258\n00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.940\nI know the default layout,\nI use some of it.\n\n259\n00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.190\nI don't use all of it,\nI do make some custom keys.\n\n260\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.920\nSo, how do I find this?\n\n261\n00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.010\nWell, there's several ways and\nwe just Tilde, okay.\n\n262\n00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.860\nI just did that which was the tilde or\ngrov key.\n\n263\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.610\nAnd what is says is all right.\n\n264\n00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.370\nSome of the language\nit's tough to remember.\n\n265\n00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.243\nMaximize or restore active frame.\n\n266\n00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:43.540\nMaximize or\nrestore active frame under cursor.\n\n267\n00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:48.120\nToggle full screen all these\nthings with modifiers.\n\n268\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.750\nIf you know the modifiers you can really\nyou can do certain things with it,\n\n269\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.140\nmaybe [INAUDIBLE] I just\nwanna hit one button.\n\n270\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.880\nCan I just hit one button?\n\n271\n00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.970\n>> Is that so much to ask?\n\n272\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.780\n>> No, is it too much to ask?\n\n273\n00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.280\n>> I don't think so.\n>> No, it's not.\n\n274\n00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.990\nSo I could highlight this and\nchange it to something else.\n\n275\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:05.690\nImmediately.\n\n276\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.140\nOr, cuz some people get really paranoid,\nit's like well what if I change it?\n\n277\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.050\nBut then, shouldn't I still know it?\n\n278\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.520\nAdobe has this great option where,\nif I come next to it and\n\n279\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.110\nclick, I can have two,\nI can have multiples of the same button.\n\n280\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.120\nAnd I'll say okay,\nwhere do I want this on the keyboard?\n\n281\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.730\nI want it, I don't know, I'm trying\nto think one of my hand usually goes.\n\n282\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.800\nI'm gonna put on A, and then I'll come\ndown and say, just to let you know\n\n283\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.880\nthat is actually the Select Track.\n\n284\n00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:47.260\nForward Tool, and if you do this,\nit's not gonna do that anymore, and\n\n285\n00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:53.270\nyou may say to yourself, I never use that.\n\n286\n00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.830\nOkay.\n\n287\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.930\nIt's automatically changed\nthe name to Custom.\n\n288\n00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.760\nIt's like,\nthis is no longer the default keyboard.\n\n289\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.550\nYou changed something.\n\n290\n00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:04.510\nSo now,\nI can say then let me save this and\n\n291\n00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:10.940\nI will say A is big window.\n\n292\n00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:16.790\nEven if it's just one\nkey you may do more So\n\n293\n00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.930\nit's like,\nall right I'm just gonna do this one.\n\n294\n00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.300\nSave, and that is ace big window and\nI will click okay.\n\n295\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.860\nNow when I come back, here we go.\n\n296\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.490\nI'm gonna hit A does the exact same thing.\n\n297\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.810\nIf I come over here and\nhit tilde, does the same thing.\n\n298\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.000\nNow I have two keys\nthat do the same thing.\n\n299\n00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.210\n>> Well you keep showing me all\nthese cool customizations tha Adobe.\n\n300\n00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.350\nwill grant us, I'm going to start\ndemanding it in all my programs [LAUGH].\n\n301\n00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.910\n>> Okay, well I'm in, and so you know.\n\n302\n00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.390\nLike I said,\nit's a lovely application to do this for\n\n303\n00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:50.610\nthe user interface, and for\nthe keyboards, and all of that.\n\n304\n00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:56.170\nThe reason why, is Adobe wants\nyou to say you're making a story.\n\n305\n00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.440\nYou're telling a story, and\nit doesn't matter what it is.\n\n306\n00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.190\nIs it a feature film?\n\n307\n00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.070\nIs it a something for your friends?\n\n308\n00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.020\nWhatever.\n\n309\n00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.880\nYou wanna be thinking\nabout the actual story.\n\n310\n00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.190\nYou don't just wanna be like I'm\nan expert on Adobe and doing all this.\n\n311\n00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.760\nI am an expert storyteller in\nAdobe Allows me all these things so\n\n312\n00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.590\nI can work as fast as my creativity.\n\n313\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.500\n>> It sounds like Adobe's just basically\ntrying to get out of the way of\n\n314\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.090\nyour creativity.\n\n315\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.800\nInstead of having to learn their\nsystem you can just say, well,\n\n316\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.220\nI'll just change it to where\nI know how it's gonna work.\n\n317\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.330\nIt's gonna be efficient and effective for\nme, now I just focus on my story telling.\n\n318\n00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.110\n>> Right.\nAnd I told the system to go ahead and\n\n319\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.230\nsave these settings to my Creative Cloud.\n\n320\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.170\nSo now when I log in on the computers\nI've got my keyboards and\n\n321\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:42.450\nI've got my work spaces and everything\nthat I need to just get working.\n\n322\n00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.590\nAnd I can say I'm gonna tell a story,\n\n323\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.160\nI've got everything I need,\nI'm focused, I'm in.\n\n324\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.140\nSo that's basically setting up this user\nface and getting it, user interface,\n\n325\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.690\nso basically I can say I'm working,\nI feel comfortable.\n\n326\n00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.370\nI don't feel challenged by the fact\nthat this is a computer application.\n\n327\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.910\nI'm in, I'm working, I'm going.\n\n328\n00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.230\n>> Yeah, this is awesome because a lot\nof times you jump into a program and\n\n329\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.900\nyou feel like you're having to like fight\nyourself to hit keyboard shortcuts or\n\n330\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.510\nwhy is this over here, when it's over\nthere it's so unintuitive for me.\n\n331\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.920\nAnd you're always worried about\ntrying to get things right and\n\n332\n00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.780\nyou're gonna forget because you don't\nhave the option to move it or change it.\n\n333\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.160\nHere they've taken that away, they say\nwe're giving you no restrictions, we want\n\n334\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.140\nyou be able to set this how you need it so\nyou can work efficiently as possible.\n\n335\n00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:27.790\nJames, awesome stuff.\n\n336\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.460\nIs there anything else we need\nto know about the interface at\n\n337\n00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.570\nleast before we go to the next one?\n\n338\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.240\n>> As soon as we go to the next one,\nwe start bringing in footage\n\n339\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.025\nthere's more changes that you\ncan make to the interface.\n\n340\n00:17:38.025 --> 00:17:41.555\nThat will let you work with\nyour footage a lot better and\n\n341\n00:17:41.555 --> 00:17:44.605\none of the things we'll talk\nabout is screen real estate.\n\n342\n00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:47.035\nA lot of people are very concerned\nabout their screen real estate.\n\n343\n00:17:47.035 --> 00:17:48.075\nThey don't want this on there.\n\n344\n00:17:48.075 --> 00:17:49.475\nThey don't want that on there.\n\n345\n00:17:49.475 --> 00:17:52.870\nOr they want and aside from these colors.\n\n346\n00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.020\nIt's like how do I know I've used this?\n\n347\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.630\nHow do I know what this is?\n\n348\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.980\nHow do I know what I shot on this\ncamera or did this person gave me?\n\n349\n00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.780\nThey told me they gave me this but\nI have this, how the heck do I know that?\n\n350\n00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.990\nAnd that's what we're gonna explore\nonce we start getting some footages.\n\n351\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.200\n>> Awesome James, well we appreciate you\nshowing us how to work with the interface\n\n352\n00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.580\na little more and\ncustomize it to our personal needs.\n\n353\n00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.720\nThat being said it looks like we've come\nto the end of another great episode we\n\n354\n00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.630\nthank you again.\n\n355\n00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.060\nThank you guys for watching we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n356\n00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.465\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n357\n00:18:22.465 --> 00:18:23.265\n>> I'm James Biddle.\n\n358\n00:18:23.265 -->

another\ngreat episode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.480\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.524\nIn today's episode, we continue forward\non our series with the Adobe Premier Pro.\n\n6\n00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:26.127\nJoining us back in the studio again today,\nis the man, the myth, the legend,\n\n7\n00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:27.173\nthat is James Biddle.\n\n8\n00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:29.333\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> James, welcome back sir.\n\n9\n00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.157\n>> You are so nice to me.\n\n10\n00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:31.321\nThank you so much.\n\n11\n00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.612\n>> Yeah, well, like to build you up there.\n\n12\n00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:33.365\n>> Aw, that's awesome.\n\n13\n00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.630\n[LAUGH]\n>> Cool, okay.\n\n14\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.400\nSo, now you know how to make a great\ninterface, you know how to get those\n\n15\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.230\nsettings going, we're going to adjust\na few settings once we get into ingesting.\n\n16\n00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.429\nThis is the cool part wanna import and\ningest.\n\n17\n00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.955\nAnd I intentionally skipped something in\nthe first lesson that is new just to show\n\n18\n00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:57.410\nyou that if you forget something you can\nalways go back like 99% you can do it.\n\n19\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.540\nYou can always go back if you forgot.\n\n20\n00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.770\nAll right, so I'm gonna use\nthe standard editing interface.\n\n21\n00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.520\nThat way you can just follow along\nif you did your customization,\n\n22\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.350\ngreat follow along that way.\n\n23\n00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.040\nBut the primary panels I'm going\nto use are down at the bottom.\n\n24\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.010\nI'm going to use the media browser and\nI'm going to use the project window.\n\n25\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.260\nNow, the thing about it is,\nyou might be saying,\n\n26\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.860\nyou might have been with adobe for\na very long time.\n\n27\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.510\nAnd you're saying, I've looked at this\nmedia browser thing, I don't get it.\n\n28\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.980\nWhy can't I just do\nthe old command I import.\n\n29\n00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.420\nYou still can, the thing is that\nis best for pictures and audio.\n\n30\n00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.960\nWhen you get into video,\nI'm gonna demonstrate this.\n\n31\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.402\nThe media browser can\nreally be your friend.\n\n32\n00:01:48.402 --> 00:01:53.110\nBut, what you have to remember is for\nnow it's called a browser.\n\n33\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.850\nBut I'm gonna make it something a little\nbit more than that toward the end.\n\n34\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.485\nSo if we back a bit, I'm gonna do that\nthing where I place my mouse over this and\n\n35\n00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:05.987\nI used the.\n\n36\n00:02:05.987 --> 00:02:11.000\nI'm gonna zoom in, and the other thing I\nhave been harping on is top to bottom,\n\n37\n00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.170\nleft to right, front to back.\n\n38\n00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.170\nAnd that's what I'm doing.\n\n39\n00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.800\nNotice nothing is highlighted right now.\n\n40\n00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.060\nI don't have a drive highlighted\nright now, you know where this is?\n\n41\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.310\nI shot some of this, some of this\nis in my creative cloud account.\n\n42\n00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.210\n>> Hm.\n>> Some of it is in\n\n43\n00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.460\nmy creative cloud account.\n\n44\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.380\nBut let's go to the drive.\n\n45\n00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.607\nStarting at the left, local drive.\n\n46\n00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:38.060\nHere's mine.\n\n47\n00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.970\nThis is a thing that can often be\nconfusing or unsettling to some folks.\n\n48\n00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.700\nAs I'm highlighting on these,\nyou're like, where is my stuff?\n\n49\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.830\nWell, it's showing you\ndirectly what is in each one.\n\n50\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.360\nIn this drive directly,\nthere are those folders.\n\n51\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.780\nWhat I wanna do is drill\ndown into each folder.\n\n52\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.960\nI have this _ITProTV one that I created.\n\n53\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.910\nOkay, if it's a little cramped I'm\ngonna do that, get this, drag it up.\n\n54\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.330\nOkay, good.\n\n55\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.380\nAnd what I've done is I have certain\nthings that I have brought in for today.\n\n56\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.462\nI shot a movie with a friend of mine,\na great director by the name of John Plow.\n\n57\n00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:23.795\nAnd we did a movie together\ncalled The Dance of Hands, and\n\n58\n00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:24.970\nI have some music from that.\n\n59\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.160\nI also shot on two cameras, an AF-100\nwhich I own, and a 5D Mark Three.\n\n60\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.680\nAnd I made a backup from\nsomething called Adobe Clip.\n\n61\n00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.920\nNow, Adobe Clip is a free.\n\n62\n00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.610\nI'm telling you, it's a free application\nyou can get on your android or\n\n63\n00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.040\nyour iPhone.\n\n64\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.260\nAnd what allows you to do is shoot video.\n\n65\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.220\nYou'd actually make a little sequence or\nyou can just shoot individual things.\n\n66\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.950\nPut it in your creative Cloud account and\nthen bring that into Premier.\n\n67\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.040\nAnd it's a great little free\nside program that you can get.\n\n68\n00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.410\nThere is another one I'm gonna show you\nwhen we get into, Color correction.\n\n69\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.730\nBut what I did is I made\na back up of that today so\n\n70\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.140\nwe wouldn't have to worry about\ngoing up and down into the Cloud.\n\n71\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.480\nOnce I get into the Panasonic here.\n\n72\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.693\nThere are even more folders.\n\n73\n00:04:14.693 --> 00:04:17.708\nAnd the more I look into that folder it's\nlike, what am I seeing in that folder,\n\n74\n00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:19.300\nwell the DCIM and all that.\n\n75\n00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.920\nWhen I come down to the private,\nthat is where I see the footage.\n\n76\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.820\nI can't see it on this side because\nwhat I'm doing on the left side\n\n77\n00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.510\nis revealing what's in the folders.\n\n78\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.730\nAnd here's all my footage.\n\n79\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.520\nI shot this.\n\n80\n00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.610\nIt's great.\n\n81\n00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.030\nIt's like I can't see that,\nit's really small.\n\n82\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.060\nOkay.\n\n83\n00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.370\nI'll come down to the bottom and I have\na slider that I can just say make it big.\n\n84\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.270\nAnd it's this really cool thing\nwhere I had a tilt shift lens.\n\n85\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.470\nAnd this is called hover scrubbing.\n\n86\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.000\nWhat I can do is just hover my mouse and\nmove it side to side and\n\n87\n00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.430\nit will give me an idea what's going on.\n\n88\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.150\nOkay, and I'm just playing through it or\nhover scrubbing.\n\n89\n00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.020\nDoing the same thing here,\ndoing the same thing here.\n\n90\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.630\nAnd these look really, really cool.\n\n91\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.259\nAnd you're saying to yourself,\nwhy can't I just do this in the Finder?\n\n92\n00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.140\nGreat question.\n\n93\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.300\n>> James, real quick, how come I\ncan't just do this in the Finder?\n\n94\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.800\n>> I'm so glad you asked.\n\n95\n00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.896\nAll right, you're great.\n\n96\n00:05:15.896 --> 00:05:18.909\nI can Ctrl+Click on this and\nI get three options.\n\n97\n00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.060\nI could say Import, Open In Source\nMonitor, or Reveal In Finder.\n\n98\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.060\nIn this case,\nI want to reveal it in the Finder.\n\n99\n00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.170\nThese are these three MTS files.\n\n100\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.840\nNow, these are almost impossible\nto find based on this file type.\n\n101\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.610\nAnd I'm gonna show you directly.\n\n102\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.868\nI'm gonna go ahead and hide this.\n\n103\n00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:43.992\nCome here.\n\n104\n00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.830\nNH, okay, wait a minute, okay boom.\n\n105\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.726\nEven I can screw this up, come here.\n\n106\n00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:53.028\nCome here you, that's right.\n\n107\n00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:56.310\nShow All I don't know how I did that.\n\n108\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.110\nOkay, let's hide that great.\n\n109\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.815\nIf I come to my drive here.\n\n110\n00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:09.259\nAnd I go to This Panasonic AF 100 No Name.\n\n111\n00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.300\nThat's technically where\nthe files are located, in here.\n\n112\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.560\nAnd you're like, cuz remember I went\nto Private before and it's in there.\n\n113\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.175\nYou're like it's the files are in the\ncomputer, I think we all know that line.\n\n114\n00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:26.075\nSo if I Ctrl+Click, and I show the package\ncontents, then I can go within that.\n\n115\n00:06:27.155 --> 00:06:30.385\nThen I can go within those package\ncontents, and then I can find,\n\n116\n00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:30.995\nthere they are.\n\n117\n00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:39.470\nThe problem is just taking these out\nof there could cause some problems.\n\n118\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:46.300\nWhat I really want to do is keep this\nstructure as intact as possible.\n\n119\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.380\nAnd that is what Media Browser does.\n\n120\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.660\nIt recognizes that cameras\nhave many different types\n\n121\n00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.610\nof methods for handling their media.\n\n122\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.440\nAnd I am allowed to browse it,\nand see it and bring it over.\n\n123\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.770\nAnd that's why we do it through\nthe media browser instead of having to\n\n124\n00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.210\ndig down in the Finder try and open it up.\n\n125\n00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.010\nThe browser says look I understand\nthis file structure and\n\n126\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.430\nI will look at it and\nthen if you want it I will bring it.\n\n127\n00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.529\nNow same thing over here I shot\non the Mark Three EOS digital.\n\n128\n00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.250\nWe got, let's see the DCIM.\n\n129\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.200\nHere we go.\n\n130\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.150\nSo I got some JPGs.\n\n131\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.000\nNotice it's showing me the JPGs and\nthe movie file.\n\n132\n00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.980\nSo it's showing me both.\n\n133\n00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.740\nThere's me.\n\n134\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.870\nI'm talking about my garden.\n\n135\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.030\nIsn't that neat?\n\n136\n00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.660\nIt's actually not my garden, but yeah.\n\n137\n00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.130\nI can actually see different\ntypes of files in here.\n\n138\n00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.400\nI can see everything.\n\n139\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.320\nI can only see, it's like,\nwhat if I only wanna see QuickTime files?\n\n140\n00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.330\nI can set it up that way.\n\n141\n00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.030\nWhat if I only wanna see Read files?\n\n142\n00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.960\nI can set it up that way as well.\n\n143\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.250\nRight now it's just All Supported files.\n\n144\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.000\nI don't wanna separate out.\n\n145\n00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.102\nI wanna see everything.\n\n146\n00:07:56.102 --> 00:07:58.931\nI just want to see everything.\n\n147\n00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:02.026\nAnd then I also have some Audio files.\n\n148\n00:08:02.026 --> 00:08:06.690\nAnd these two that I shot\nat home are Adobe Clip.\n\n149\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.510\nAnd I made these little sequences and\nI'm gonna cut them up later and\n\n150\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.750\nput them up to my Adobe project.\n\n151\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.920\nNow, here's the new thing and\nthis is actually cool.\n\n152\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:24.090\nIf I import something,\nif I just do a straight import into\n\n153\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.440\nAdobe Premier, it stays wherever it is.\n\n154\n00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:36.040\nThe media doesn't move anywhere or\nit does not, quote unquote, ingest.\n\n155\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.190\nSo if I, say,\nbring these files into the project.\n\n156\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.120\nIf the project is on my computer and\n\n157\n00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.210\nthe media is on my drive, it stays on\nthe drive, it doesn't actually move.\n\n158\n00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.180\nBut if you're saying, but\nthat's not what I want to do,\n\n159\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.699\nI actually wanna, when I do this,\nI wanna actually move it somewhere else.\n\n160\n00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.440\nWell you could use a side\napplication called Prelude.\n\n161\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.110\nI love Prelude, some people look at\nPrelude and they go, I'm confused,\n\n162\n00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.630\nI just want to stay in Adobe Premiere.\n\n163\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.060\nSo now you have that option.\n\n164\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.094\nThe interesting thing is,\nI'm gonna go back up to the top here,\n\n165\n00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:13.821\nFile > Project Settings.\n\n166\n00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:16.690\nRemember when we set up\nthe project at the beginning, Dan?\n\n167\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.240\n>> Yeah.\n>> I skipped inject settings\n\n168\n00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.280\ncan be set there.\n\n169\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.500\nI can absolutely set them\nthere at the beginning knowing\n\n170\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.180\nI'm gonna want to bring\nthem in all the time.\n\n171\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.570\nBut I can say ingest, and then it\ngives me a wide variety of options.\n\n172\n00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.060\nDo I want to just copy them,\nas in it will copy them and\n\n173\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.310\nI can send them to a specific place, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.168\nSame as project,\nthat's why it says primary destination.\n\n175\n00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:51.291\nOr, no, Creative Cloud files or\nchoose a new location.\n\n176\n00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:54.520\nIn this case, I'll choose a new location,\nwhich will be kind of sad.\n\n177\n00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.320\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it\nright back on the exact same drive because\n\n178\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.630\nI don't wanna clutter up this thing.\n\n179\n00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.854\nBut I can say all right,\nlet me create a new folder and\n\n180\n00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:09.710\ncall this new cool thing cuz this is\na new cool thing in Adobe Premiere.\n\n181\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:10.900\n>> It's not the old cool thing we had.\n\n182\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.629\n>> No, no, no, there are so\nmany old cool things though, but, okay.\n\n183\n00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:18.259\nSo, and I can do with a verification so\nif there are any problems,\n\n184\n00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:20.768\nthis is why using\nthe media browser is great.\n\n185\n00:10:20.768 --> 00:10:25.414\nIf there are any problems moving things,\nyou can get something like a check sum or\n\n186\n00:10:25.414 --> 00:10:29.530\na verification saying okay,\nI tossed some files or this didn't work.\n\n187\n00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.395\nWhere as the drag and\ndrop, you don't get that.\n\n188\n00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:34.745\nAdobe's giving you every opportunity,\n\n189\n00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:39.010\nit's like if there's a problem,\nit will let you know, in some cases.\n\n190\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.830\nNow this'll be just a straight copy.\n\n191\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.230\nSome people will be like,\nwell what if I wanted to turn this into\n\n192\n00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.550\nsome really robust stuff,\n422 is the big number.\n\n193\n00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.197\nI could say transcode, and\n\n194\n00:10:50.197 --> 00:10:53.498\nthen I have some match source\nthat are already on here.\n\n195\n00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:55.580\nI could transfer, and\nthat's maybe what I'll do.\n\n196\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.890\nI'll say I'm gonna turn that\ninto pro res 422 media.\n\n197\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:08.070\nI'll say boom, done, and\nnotice the ingest went on in here.\n\n198\n00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.070\nI could turn it off again,\nI could turn it on again from here.\n\n199\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.670\nI could hit that wrench right here and\n\n200\n00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:20.980\ngo to the settings one more time and\nsubvert a lot of that.\n\n201\n00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.610\nSo now, I have so many more\noptions that are now available in\n\n202\n00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.954\nthe media browser for people who don't\nnecessarily want to go to Prelude.\n\n203\n00:11:29.954 --> 00:11:33.203\nPrelude is a great application, but\nyou might just want to say look,\n\n204\n00:11:33.203 --> 00:11:34.386\nPrelude is not my thing.\n\n205\n00:11:34.386 --> 00:11:37.661\nI know I can do really\ncool stuff in it but\n\n206\n00:11:37.661 --> 00:11:42.641\nI like these media browser and\nI dont want to leave Premier.\n\n207\n00:11:42.641 --> 00:11:45.650\nSo you don't have to,\nyou absolutely don't have to.\n\n208\n00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.120\n>> Sounds like Adobe's taking\na page out of the Microsoft book,\n\n209\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.660\nwhere somebody makes a great product\nthat works with their software.\n\n210\n00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.712\nAnd they go you know what, we'll just\nincorporate that in to the software.\n\n211\n00:11:55.712 --> 00:11:56.639\n>> Let's just put it in there.\n\n212\n00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:57.357\n>> Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:57.357 --> 00:12:00.084\n>> There are enough people who say\nwhy do I have to go to Prelude?\n\n214\n00:12:00.084 --> 00:12:04.210\nIt's really nice, and it is,\nbut we'll just do it from here.\n\n215\n00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.350\nSo now there's a couple\nof different things.\n\n216\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:12.700\nI could say okay, I just want this one,\nCtrl+click it and say import, okay.\n\n217\n00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.885\nIt's going to ingest because\ningest is checked, okay.\n\n218\n00:12:18.768 --> 00:12:22.720\nWhat I am going to do instead\nis if I want both of these, and\n\n219\n00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.780\nI'll say hey, you know what?\n\n220\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.710\nIt's already in this nice folder\nright here that's already named.\n\n221\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:34.240\nI'm gonna Ctrl+click this folder and\nsay Import.\n\n222\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.560\nSo that way when I come\nover to the project,\n\n223\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.899\nit's already technically created a bin for\nme.\n\n224\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.010\nAnd there it is, and it's already ready.\n\n225\n00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.950\nIt's already ready, and I'm just saying,\nhey, it's already in a bin.\n\n226\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.430\nThat's really cool, I like that.\n\n227\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.640\nI'll go back to media browser,\nand let's see.\n\n228\n00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.200\nThose two are ingested.\n\n229\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.360\nLet me go over to this one and say,\n\n230\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.090\nyou know what, I don't wanna ingest,\nI just want to import these.\n\n231\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:07.240\nSo I will lasso them,\nCtrl+click import, okay.\n\n232\n00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.054\nNow those aren't, Wait a minute,\n\n233\n00:13:11.054 --> 00:13:14.660\nyou're like wait a minute,\nshouldn't they just be out here?\n\n234\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.010\nThere's something I have to be careful of.\n\n235\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.640\nThe last thing I had\nhighlighted was clip backup so\n\n236\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.010\nthey all ended up in clip backup.\n\n237\n00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.550\nAnd its like, aw man!\n\n238\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.770\nA neat trick about making bins is\nthat most people are like, okay,\n\n239\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:37.050\nso I have to come here to this new bin,\nclick it, make it, drag everything out.\n\n240\n00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.150\nInstead, what I'm gonna do is\njust say okay, you know what?\n\n241\n00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:46.031\nI'm gonna take these,\nlasso them, just the top five.\n\n242\n00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:52.689\nAnd I'm gonna drag it over the bin icon\nand it automatically puts them into a bin.\n\n243\n00:13:52.689 --> 00:13:55.800\nAnd then I'll just drag it out of that,\nand now they're separate.\n\n244\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.380\n>> Very nice.\n\n245\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.581\n>> So yeah, and I can just say this okay,\nso this is the stuff from the Panasonic,\n\n246\n00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:03.520\nokay, which I have misspelled,\nsorry, Panasonic.\n\n247\n00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:10.750\nOr, actually, no, I'm gonna say it's from\nthe 100, okay, that's a little easier.\n\n248\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.080\nAnd there we go.\n\n249\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.853\n>> Hey James,\nI hate to stop you really quickly, I'm-\n\n250\n00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:14.435\n>> Yeah, what do you got?\n\n251\n00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:15.907\n>> I'm looking at our screen here and\n\n252\n00:14:15.907 --> 00:14:19.000\nyou're doing a fantastic job of\nzooming in so everybody could see.\n\n253\n00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.316\nThe resolution is bit small,\ncould we bump that up?.\n\n254\n00:14:21.316 --> 00:14:22.840\n>> Is this too tiny?\n\n255\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.818\n>> It's just I have, I got cheaters\non here, I don't see very well.\n\n256\n00:14:24.818 --> 00:14:26.780\n>> Guess what,\nguess who thinks about that?\n\n257\n00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.422\nI mean, look at these.\n\n258\n00:14:27.422 --> 00:14:28.108\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah,\nthere you go, there you go.\n\n259\n00:14:28.108 --> 00:14:30.370\n>> Guess who thinks about that, Adobe.\n\n260\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.910\nIf I go to this menu stack here,\nI can say, look, Font Size.\n\n261\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.650\nExtra Large, how's that for you?\n\n262\n00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.605\n>> That is fantastic.\n\n263\n00:14:40.605 --> 00:14:41.400\n>> Is that better?\n\n264\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.832\nOkay, so now-\n>> These old eyes can see again.\n\n265\n00:14:42.832 --> 00:14:47.605\n>> Yep, and then if I come down here to\nthe bottom to the scaler, there you go and\n\n266\n00:14:47.605 --> 00:14:49.330\nI can bring that up.\n\n267\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.793\nIt's always one of those things you want\nto avoid, and it's pretty hard to see,\n\n268\n00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:57.224\nyou wanna avoid the I can see it now,\njumping into the screen.\n\n269\n00:14:57.224 --> 00:15:00.811\nYeah, there's always something,\nthere's always something.\n\n270\n00:15:00.811 --> 00:15:04.251\nSo I'm gonna go back to the media\nbrowser real quick, which,\n\n271\n00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:06.100\ndoes that have the option?\n\n272\n00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:11.097\nNo, so that could be a little\ntricky because the project area is\n\n273\n00:15:11.097 --> 00:15:13.659\nwhere you sort of live the most.\n\n274\n00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:15.720\nSo that's why they make that option.\n\n275\n00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.552\nSo the last thing I'll do is just\ngo over to this folder right here.\n\n276\n00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:24.735\nNow this folder has everything I want,\nbut it has a mixture,\n\n277\n00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:27.205\nit has a movie and it has some JPEGs.\n\n278\n00:15:27.205 --> 00:15:32.680\nBut you know what,\nit's conveniently into this folder.\n\n279\n00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.733\nSo I'm just gonna say you know what,\njust make that a bin for me and\n\n280\n00:15:36.733 --> 00:15:39.960\nI will handle that when\nI get back over here.\n\n281\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:47.770\nAnd yeah, Notice, We have icons, okay.\n\n282\n00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:54.620\nIf I have an icon like this,\nI have a video and I have audio on this.\n\n283\n00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.641\nIf it was just video,\nI would just have the little film guy.\n\n284\n00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:01.816\nIf it was just audio, I would have\nsomething that looked like that.\n\n285\n00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:05.521\nWhen I come down here, that's a JPEG.\n\n286\n00:16:05.521 --> 00:16:10.720\nOkay, now, and aside from the JPG and\nall that, that is a JPEG.\n\n287\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:19.027\nWhat I can also do is, some people don't\nlike what is known as the list view.\n\n288\n00:16:19.027 --> 00:16:23.000\nI can change it, it's like let me switch\nto the icon view or come up here,\n\n289\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.900\nthen I get these really big icons.\n\n290\n00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:33.480\nIf I double click this one, okay,\nhere are the icons of what I can see and\n\n291\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.239\nit'll say,\nthis one says it only has audio.\n\n292\n00:16:38.239 --> 00:16:41.470\nIf I scroll over it says\nit contains linked audio.\n\n293\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.190\nI wouldn't be able to see any\nvideo if it didn't have any video.\n\n294\n00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.392\nOkay, we'll come over to this one,\nthese are JPEGs,\n\n295\n00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:49.855\nthat's why there's no audio there.\n\n296\n00:16:49.855 --> 00:16:51.865\nSo you always get something.\n\n297\n00:16:54.255 --> 00:16:57.395\nThe other thing that you\nmight be interested in,\n\n298\n00:16:57.395 --> 00:17:01.040\nthis is one of the things where\nwe talk about screen real estate.\n\n299\n00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.025\nSome people love what I'm about to show,\nother people absolutely despise it.\n\n300\n00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:07.862\n>> Loathe even.\n\n301\n00:17:07.862 --> 00:17:10.780\n>> Loathe, loathe, loathe,\nloathe, okay, just like ugh.\n\n302\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.500\nThere are a couple of these.\n\n303\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:19.553\nI'll come back up to this menu,\nand notice it says the icon.\n\n304\n00:17:19.553 --> 00:17:20.615\nCould have gotten it from here.\n\n305\n00:17:20.615 --> 00:17:23.210\nThere's a thing called Thumbnails.\n\n306\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.030\nNow I just showed an icon, so\ninstead of the list, I got thumbnails,\n\n307\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.370\nor I got the other.\n\n308\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.850\nIn this case,\nI can say show me a thumbnail.\n\n309\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.921\n>> We're not talking some weird serial\nkiller's collection of pictures right?\n\n310\n00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:40.415\n>> Not anymore, not anymore.\n\n311\n00:17:40.415 --> 00:17:43.358\nBut notice, instead of icons now I\n\n312\n00:17:43.358 --> 00:17:48.430\nhave thumbnails of what's available and\nI can see them.\n\n313\n00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.690\n>> It gives you a tiny preview.\n\n314\n00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.840\n>> Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.\n\n315\n00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.585\nWell, unlike the icon,\nI can't really hover scrub over this.\n\n316\n00:17:56.585 --> 00:17:58.145\nSo that's why a lot of\npeople love the icons.\n\n317\n00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:06.975\nThe thing that some people love, if I come\nback up over here, Is the Preview Area.\n\n318\n00:18:06.975 --> 00:18:09.489\nI like the Preview Area because\nit does a lot of stuff.\n\n319\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.249\nSo if I say Preview Area,\nthe first thing people say is okay,\n\n320\n00:18:13.249 --> 00:18:15.980\nthat just took away a ton\nof stuff from the top.\n\n321\n00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.520\nIt's like, yes.\nIf you need screen real estate,\n\n322\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.530\nit could be a problem.\n\n323\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:25.522\nBut the thing I like about it is,\nif I click on this video here,\n\n324\n00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:28.883\nit tells me just about everything I want.\n\n325\n00:18:28.883 --> 00:18:33.771\nIt tells me the name of it,\ntells me this was shot at 1280 by 720.\n\n326\n00:18:33.771 --> 00:18:39.210\nIt's that long, it was shot at that\nframe rate, it's got this audio on it.\n\n327\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:45.040\nNot only that, I can get a quick preview,\nand it will play, okay?\n\n328\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.550\nOr I can use this, and\nI can scroll it, and\n\n329\n00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:51.260\nthen some people will say, well,\nwhat does the little camera do?\n\n330\n00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:53.280\nPoster frame.\n\n331\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.028\nWhat that means is if\nyou use the thumbnail,\n\n332\n00:18:57.028 --> 00:19:02.412\nwhat's at the top might not be\nthe best to see in the thumbnail.\n\n333\n00:19:02.412 --> 00:19:04.727\nSo what I can do is say,\nokay when I look at thumbnail,\n\n334\n00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:06.650\nthat's the thing I wanna see.\n\n335\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:10.880\nRight there, the nice, the sharp front and\nall that and I can go boom.\n\n336\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.330\nSo that is now the thumbnail down here,\nokay?\n\n337\n00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.738\nSo I can reset that.\n\n338\n00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:18.850\nEspecially people who use clap slates,\nwhere they've got\n\n339\n00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.570\na lot of stuff at the beginning,\nand then it goes into the front.\n\n340\n00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.320\nYou really wanna say,\nokay, I like the icons, but\n\n341\n00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.200\nI need to set some of them\nto where I need to see it.\n\n342\n00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.990\nThe cool thing about this is,\nonce we start editing,\n\n343\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.890\nthis will tell me how many times\nI've used it in sequences.\n\n344\n00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.200\nAnd which sequences I've used it in, and\n\n345\n00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.900\nthen it will let me go\ndirectly to those sequences.\n\n346\n00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.780\n>> Don't think of it at as\nlosing screen real estate.\n\n347\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.119\nThink of it as gaining information,\nvaluable information.\n\n348\n00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.149\n>> Exactly.\n\n349\n00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:49.171\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Last thing,\n\n350\n00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:50.850\nthat could be a lot of fun in this.\n\n351\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:59.779\nIt'll say, what is a Search Bin, okay?\n\n352\n00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:01.260\nI'm like, what's a Search Bin?\n\n353\n00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.177\nCuz I have a bin that holds everything.\n\n354\n00:20:02.177 --> 00:20:03.380\nBut I have a Search Bin.\n\n355\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.080\nIt's gonna come up here, and it's gonna\nsay, all right, what're you looking for?\n\n356\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.980\nAnd I'll say,\nI can look through all the metadata.\n\n357\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.680\nWe're gonna cover a little bit of that\nwhen we talk about the project window and\n\n358\n00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.930\nthe metadata fields.\n\n359\n00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:17.810\nWell I'll say no, no, no.\n\n360\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:18.664\nJust in the name.\n\n361\n00:20:21.156 --> 00:20:22.682\nAnd what are you looking for?\n\n362\n00:20:22.682 --> 00:20:26.307\nI am looking for .jpg.\n\n363\n00:20:26.307 --> 00:20:29.670\n>> It's like spotlight for-\n>> Exactly, and then I can add more,\n\n364\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.150\nI can add another parameter if I want, but\nit's like, no, that's the only one I need.\n\n365\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:42.390\nBoom and now in this search folder,\nit's just everything with JPEG on it.\n\n366\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.720\nThat's all, that's everything.\n\n367\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.920\nIt did not move it out of the 5D folder.\n\n368\n00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.840\nIt didn't move it out of the 5D folder.\n\n369\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.340\nIt just said, okay, I searched for\nthem, here they are.\n\n370\n00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.172\nIf I delete this folder,\nJPEGs are still there.\n\n371\n00:20:58.172 --> 00:21:01.723\nBut this is an awesome way, instead of\nlike, I don't know where all my JPEGs are,\n\n372\n00:21:01.723 --> 00:21:04.970\nI need to start punching and\npecking through all the bins and stuff.\n\n373\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.410\nI'll just say no, I'm just gonna create\na search folder and say, I'm looking for\n\n374\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.880\nJPEGs.\n\n375\n00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.013\nOr I'm looking for things with this name,\nor looking for things with that, and\n\n376\n00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:16.241\nI can have a bunch I can\nhave a bunch of them.\n\n377\n00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:23.210\nAnd it helps me get through here really\nfast so I can organize my media.\n\n378\n00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.660\nSo that is the importing versus ingesting,\nand\n\n379\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:33.809\nif I jump out real quick, notice,\nthis thing came up, this media encoder.\n\n380\n00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.540\nAnd it told me hey, you said ingest.\n\n381\n00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.775\nAnd when you said ingest, I brought those\ntwo in and I turned them into pro res 422.\n\n382\n00:21:43.775 --> 00:21:47.635\nI just automatically opened for you and\nyou didn't have to worry about it.\n\n383\n00:21:47.635 --> 00:21:51.469\n>> You did that because we made those\nsettings changes in a general area.\n\n384\n00:21:51.469 --> 00:21:52.198\n>> Right, or\n\n385\n00:21:52.198 --> 00:21:56.990\nlike I said, we actually could make\nthem in the actual media browser.\n\n386\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:05.270\nSo here I am, and under new cool thing,\nI have two that are pro res 422.\n\n387\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.140\nThese are the pro res 422 ones.\n\n388\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.030\nThese actually ingested and\nput them somewhere else.\n\n389\n00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:17.480\nThe ones that I simply imported, they're\nright where they were, never moved.\n\n390\n00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.090\nSo you can feel safe that you know the\ndifference between a media browser import,\n\n391\n00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.830\nand an ingest in that case.\n\n392\n00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.938\nAnd that's new, and is a really,\nreally nice, nice feature in this version.\n\n393\n00:22:27.938 --> 00:22:30.346\n>> That's an insanely nice\nfeature to be able to work with,\n\n394\n00:22:30.346 --> 00:22:32.715\nthen you don't have use any\nkind of third party plug in.\n\n395\n00:22:32.715 --> 00:22:34.990\nIt's built right into Premiere.\n\n396\n00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.639\nAdobe has heard our cries and\nhave come to our help there.\n\n397\n00:22:39.639 --> 00:22:42.059\nJames, learned a lot of\ncool stuff in this episode.\n\n398\n00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:44.550\nIs there anything else we need to\ncover before we close the show?\n\n399\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.443\n>> Not in this episode.\n\n400\n00:22:45.443 --> 00:22:48.535\nBut when we get into the next one,\nwe're gonna start looking at a little bit\n\n401\n00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:51.383\nmore in the project window, and\nthen we're gonna start getting into\n\n402\n00:22:51.383 --> 00:22:54.750\nthe source window, and really start\nmanipulating our footage for editing.\n\n403\n00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:55.588\n>> Awesome.\n>> Which is really exciting.\n\n404\n00:22:55.588 --> 00:22:56.291\nThat's the best part.\n\n405\n00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:57.370\n>> Yeah, it is at that.\n\n406\n00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:01.640\nAnd now we know how to get some\nfootage into our Premiere system.\n\n407\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.274\nWe can't wait to see that next episode.\n\n408\n00:23:03.274 --> 00:23:04.580\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n409\n00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.390\nThat being said, it looks we have\ncome to the end of this episode.\n\n410\n00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.516\nJames, we thank you for\nstopping by yet again.\n\n411\n00:23:08.516 --> 00:23:10.170\n>> Thank you, this is so much fun.\n\n412\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.634\nI can't wait til we really start editing.\n\n413\n00:23:11.634 --> 00:23:12.139\n>> It is a good time.\n\n414\n00:23:12.139 --> 00:23:13.107\n>> Cuz that's where it's really powerful.\n\n415\n00:23:13.107 --> 00:23:14.040\n>> That's right.\n\n416\n00:23:14.040 -->

another great episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:18.680\ntoday's episode?\n\n5\n00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.840\nWell yes, you guessed it.\n\n6\n00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.190\nIt's more of our series on Premiere Pro.\n\n7\n00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.648\nAnd joining us back in the studio.\n\n8\n00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:24.200\n>> Yay.\n\n9\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.237\n>> You hear his voice.\n\n10\n00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:27.223\n>> Yay.\n>> The sound of angels coming from,\n\n11\n00:00:27.223 --> 00:00:29.440\nnext to me here, it is Mr. James Biddle.\n\n12\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.630\nHow's it going today, James?\n\n13\n00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.680\n>> I'm good, man, how are you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.340\n>> Good, man.\n\n15\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.040\n>> Great.\n\n16\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.100\nSo, we all want to get\nstarted with editing,\n\n17\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.490\nbut one of the key thins to do is get\nyour project window organized, why?\n\n18\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.440\nIt's going to help you.\n\n19\n00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.330\nI mean, I've seen too many people\nwhat they do is they just keep going,\n\n20\n00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.540\nthey're double-clicking anything.\n\n21\n00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.380\nAnd they can't find anything,\nand then once they find it,\n\n22\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.840\nthey're like, what was I going to do?\n\n23\n00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.280\nSo let's take a look at this real quick.\n\n24\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.680\nI've made it kind of big again,\nokay, I'm going to take\n\n25\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.300\nthis little slider bar down here,\nwhich looks like two sort of mountains.\n\n26\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.470\nMake it a little bigger.\n\n27\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.050\nA lot of people ask me, okay,\nI imported a couple of these, I imported\n\n28\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.020\nthese two folders from mini browser,\ncan I rename them?\n\n29\n00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.750\nAbsolutely, you can rename them.\n\n30\n00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.820\nThere's absolutely no problem with that.\n\n31\n00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.570\nSo I'm just going to\nsay this Garden Clips.\n\n32\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.290\nThis 100, what was that?\n\n33\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.245\nLet me go see.\nOkay, so that was the pants.\n\n34\n00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:29.780\nI'm going to say Garden,\n\n35\n00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.925\nand I'm going to say Focus, because\nwhat I did was I played around with this\n\n36\n00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:38.220\nTilt-Shift lens, so I could get\nthese really weird pieces of focus.\n\n37\n00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.800\nAnd then this last one, I'm just going to\nsay it's the Canon Garden and Interview.\n\n38\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.420\nOkay?\n\n39\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.210\nSo now I've named all of those.\n\n40\n00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.280\nCan I rename actual clips?\n\n41\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.260\nYes.\n\n42\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.390\nThat's not a problem,\nif I rename them here, it's not a problem.\n\n43\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.570\nBecause let's face it, July 23,\n2016, not a great name.\n\n44\n00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.540\nSo, I'm going to say OuterGarden.\n\n45\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.430\nGarder, I'm a terrible speller this is why\nI edit for a living, InnerGARDEN, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.830\nSo that way I just know\nthe difference between the two, and\n\n47\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.940\nI'll leave that capitalized.\n\n48\n00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.940\nWell, I don't care.\n\n49\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.700\nIn here, I've got the movies and the JPGs.\n\n50\n00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.530\nAnd everything is fine.\n\n51\n00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.000\nSo, I want to sort to get a basic\nsystem of doing my bins in this way.\n\n52\n00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.690\nSome people absolutely hate bins.\n\n53\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.770\nYou can hate bins.\n\n54\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.930\nThat's all right.\n\n55\n00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.260\nI love them.\n\n56\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.150\nOne way to organize is with columns.\n\n57\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.390\nLet's take a look, especially this\ncannon one's got mixed media.\n\n58\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.640\nWhen I look at the columns,\nit gives me certain types of information.\n\n59\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.610\nOkay, I come in here, frame rate.\n\n60\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.190\nThis one has a frame rate of 23.976\nbecause I actually shot this video.\n\n61\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.820\nIt tells me, you know,\n\n62\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.910\nwhere it started shooting in the time\ncode, where it ended, how long it is.\n\n63\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.370\nThese are the video in points and\nout points, which we will discuss later.\n\n64\n00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.990\nThey are blue.\n\n65\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.650\nThat means I can change them,\nI can even change them here.\n\n66\n00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.960\nI know if you've ever worked with ends and\nout points before,\n\n67\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.930\nyou generally do that\nin the source monitor.\n\n68\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.420\nI can do that here if I wanted to,\nwhere I could change the in and\n\n69\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.480\nout points, it's kind of crazy.\n\n70\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.330\nThat's how long it is.\n\n71\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.760\nHere's my resolution, here's audio info.\n\n72\n00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.020\nIf I keep scrolling over, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.750\nGet away from me.\n\n74\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.250\nCool.\n\n75\n00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.620\nI have this thing here called good.\n\n76\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.290\nHave a column go good, and\nI can say you know what?\n\n77\n00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.240\nYes, that is good.\n\n78\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.760\nClick, and once I do that,\nthat is searchable.\n\n79\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.020\nSo I can use my search with that,\nor if I click on columns,\n\n80\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.400\nit will allow me to sort in that way.\n\n81\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.670\nOkay, now it's like ascending,\ndescending I can also choose to hide this,\n\n82\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.640\nLet say I'm say I just don't want to deal\nwith certain things right now, okay?\n\n83\n00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.090\nIt's like, wait a minute,\nwhat's happening it's gone, no.\n\n84\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.860\nUnderstood, it's not up in here,\nhide is not up in here.\n\n85\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.180\nWhat will I do?\n\n86\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.920\nI'm going to take any clip and\ncontrol click on it and get this menu,\n\n87\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.200\nwhich is specific to this clip, and just\nsay view the hidden, and now it's back.\n\n88\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.290\nSo, there's all kinds of\ndifferent things that you can do,\n\n89\n00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.310\nthis is generally the panel menu.\n\n90\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.370\nBut when I control click on things,\nI get this little source menu of options,\n\n91\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.230\nand one of them being to hide something,\nto view the hidden,\n\n92\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.200\nI won't want to hide that anymore.\n\n93\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.460\nOkay.\n\n94\n00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.040\nNice.\nSo there are certain things I can do to\n\n95\n00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.980\nall of this.\n\n96\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.710\nI can make custom columns.\n\n97\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.850\nIf you want a custom column,\nit's fairly easy.\n\n98\n00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.850\nI can control click.\n\n99\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.520\nWell, let's take on the first one,\nframe rate.\n\n100\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.230\nIt says metadata display, okay?\n\n101\n00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.220\nAnd then it says all these different types\nof displays, it's plays that you can have.\n\n102\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.380\nIf you're regular Photoshop user, you\nmay want some camera roll information or\n\n103\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.820\nsome Photoshop information that you\nwant to see in these metadata copes.\n\n104\n00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.890\nI don't do that, so\nI don't want to see it.\n\n105\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.220\nBut notice I have this thing called\nPremiere Pro Project Metadata.\n\n106\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.090\nWhen I look in there,\nI have to be able to see the name.\n\n107\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.730\nYou know, if I don't see the name,\nthat's not good.\n\n108\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.270\nSo all these other things,\nmedia start, media end,\n\n109\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.420\nall of these I can choose to see some\nof them, not choose to see others.\n\n110\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.950\nOkay, I'm going to move that back over.\n\n111\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.970\nRights management, proxies,\nall of this stuff that I can choose to see\n\n112\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.690\nwhat I want to see and\nwhat I don't want to see.\n\n113\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.060\nThe other thing is I could add a property.\n\n114\n00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.880\nSo I'm going to add my\nown custom property.\n\n115\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.630\nDan's like I like this.\n\n116\n00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.189\n>> And I could say something like,\nlet's say I want bugs.\n\n117\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.300\nNow, why do I want bugs?\n\n118\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.840\nSo let me say I want it, and\nseparate bugs from flowers.\n\n119\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.320\nI only want to see that, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.570\nType, sometimes you want to go by numbers,\nokay?\n\n121\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.280\nSo you have real numbers, Integers.\n\n122\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.890\nI generally stick to what is called text.\n\n123\n00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.460\nYou can do what's called a boolean search,\n\n124\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.730\nwhere you can put a couple of\nparameters in there and do it that way.\n\n125\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.370\nMost common is text.\n\n126\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.070\nSo I'll just say text.\n\n127\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:31.320\nClick okay, we zoom back out here,\nscroll down, there is my new bugs\n\n128\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.890\nproperty, and I can remove it if I\nwant to, but right now there is bugs.\n\n129\n00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:38.818\nIt's a happy thing.\n\n130\n00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:44.500\nI'm going to go ahead and\nkeep it, I will click okay,\n\n131\n00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.040\ncome back here and\nBUGS is all the way on the edge.\n\n132\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.460\nI don't like that.\n\n133\n00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.180\nIf I click and hold down, I can move it,\nand you'll see a little blue bar\n\n134\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.950\nI can put it right now in front of tape\nname, scroll over a little more, and say,\n\n135\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.030\nyou know, I'd like that closer to\nthe front so I can utilize it, please.\n\n136\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.430\nI put it right next to frame rate and\nI'll say, does this one have bugs?\n\n137\n00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:15.290\nAnd I will say, yes, and then I can sort\nby that column and every time there's yes.\n\n138\n00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.062\nThere's a bug, and it sorts it for me, so\n\n139\n00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.820\nthat way I can separate bugs\nfrom flowers and all that.\n\n140\n00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.850\nSome people love this,\nsome people not to into it.\n\n141\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.300\nIf you're not into it, that's why\nthere are numerous search parameters.\n\n142\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.485\nWe did beforehand.\n\n143\n00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:32.965\nWe did the search bin last time.\n\n144\n00:07:32.965 --> 00:07:35.325\nThe reason I did a search\nbin is because one,\n\n145\n00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:38.435\nit'll put the things I search for\nin a bin.\n\n146\n00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:44.570\nIt also has two parameters,\nI can search by two parameters.\n\n147\n00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.320\nIn the case of just a simple search,\nwhen I come up here.\n\n148\n00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.980\nOkay, notice it's searching through here,\nand\n\n149\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.460\nI'll just say .JPG,\nit will simply reveal the JPGs.\n\n150\n00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.490\nOkay, that's it.\n\n151\n00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.753\nThere's one last one.\n\n152\n00:08:01.905 --> 00:08:04.830\nThat is available in this window,\nif I come down here.\n\n153\n00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:10.670\nNotice there's a search or a find in this\ncase, which is different than a search.\n\n154\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.400\nSo if I do find,\nI will say I already preloaded this.\n\n155\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.130\nI'll say now name, and\nthat name is going to contain jpg.\n\n156\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:27.120\nThe interesting thing about this is when\nI click find, every time I hit find,\n\n157\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:33.000\nit takes me to a new\none through the queue.\n\n158\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.070\n>> I take it it's assuming that the first\none in found is not the one you're looking\n\n159\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.610\nfor, certainly?\n\n160\n00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.310\n>> Right, it's just like find them all,\nand every time I keep clicking it, it's\n\n161\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.868\nlike all right, I'm just going to scroll\nthrough them until I find the right one.\n\n162\n00:08:42.868 --> 00:08:44.830\nSo, you know, there's so\n\n163\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:50.700\nmany different ways that you can search\nthrough and find in this window.\n\n164\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.000\nIt is great.\n\n165\n00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.690\nAnd again-\n>> Obviously very unprofessional software,\n\n166\n00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.810\nand no one will ever use this.\n\n167\n00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:56.720\n>> No, absolutely.\n\n168\n00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.591\nI mean,\nit's going to be all over the place.\n\n169\n00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.360\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n>> You have no idea what's happening.\n\n170\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.740\nAnd one of the reasons why you might\ndo this, you're not a Bing user.\n\n171\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.300\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n172\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.940\nyou do the find because you've got\nstuff everywhere, and it's like okay,\n\n173\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.770\nI just want to find this, and\nevery time you click find,\n\n174\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.260\nit goes to a different one you're like,\nI found it, that's great.\n\n175\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.330\nOr you can also, like I said,\nyou could use columns.\n\n176\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.570\nIf you're doing a lot of work over time,\n\n177\n00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:25.770\nit's great to use columns, because the\ncolumns will maintain that information.\n\n178\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.960\nAnd then you will notice\nwhen I did the search bin,\n\n179\n00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.180\nI could have done a couple of\ndifferent parameters in here, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.420\nWithin those fields.\n\n181\n00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.400\nAnd that would make me happy to do that.\n\n182\n00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:39.930\nOkay?\n\n183\n00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.830\nEspecially if I wanted to find everything,\nbecause what I have done,\n\n184\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:49.337\nwhich is really evil, but\nhappens all the time now, is I'm going\n\n185\n00:09:49.337 --> 00:09:54.010\nto go to the cannon here and zoom in.\n\n186\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.310\nAnd you will notice this little\ninterview I did with me,\n\n187\n00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.480\nwhich is terrible, is shot at 23.976.\n\n188\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.700\nThe other stuff that I\ndid is going to be at 60.\n\n189\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.710\nI shot that at 60 frames per second,\njust so I would have mixed media.\n\n190\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.770\nThis one was shot at 30.\n\n191\n00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.060\nAnd then this stuff was shot at 60.\n\n192\n00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.360\nSo, now what I'm going to have to\ndo when I create a sequence is,\n\n193\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.140\nboy, I've got mixed media,\nwhich one am I going to use?\n\n194\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.510\nThat is crazy.\n\n195\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.540\nThe other thing we may\nwant to do with this\n\n196\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:37.400\nis sometimes I need to organize\nsomething about the clip itself.\n\n197\n00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:43.210\nLet me come down to this thing right here,\n\n198\n00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.000\nokay, this is the movie,\nthis is me talking.\n\n199\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.170\nThis is me doing a lot of talking.\n\n200\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.008\nAll right, we're going to\ncut up this interview later.\n\n201\n00:10:50.008 --> 00:10:53.280\nIf I ctrl+click it,\nthis is where I get the clips menu.\n\n202\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.640\nWhat I am able to do with this is\nI can look at the properties for\n\n203\n00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.850\nthis in a separate menu.\n\n204\n00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:10.680\nI am able to actually reveal this In the\nfinder, but I am also able to modify it.\n\n205\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:16.350\nOccasionally, we may want to modify things\nat the source level before we get started.\n\n206\n00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.110\nOne of them generally\nbeing audio channels.\n\n207\n00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.780\nOkay?\n\n208\n00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:26.730\nSo, we are able to do that,\nI don’t have to do this one by one,\n\n209\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.580\nI can do this to multiple\nfiles at the same time.\n\n210\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.740\nYou may run into the fact where sometimes,\nwhat happens is,\n\n211\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.140\nI’m just going to do\nthis is as an example.\n\n212\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.210\nWhat happens is you brought\nin some footage, and\n\n213\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.030\nyou have noticed the left\nchannel has audio in it.\n\n214\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.660\nThe right channel is either dead or\ntoo low, or making a lovely hiss.\n\n215\n00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.654\nAnd what you want to do is you want\nto get started [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n216\n00:11:50.654 --> 00:11:52.050\nthen you get into the timeline.\n\n217\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:58.350\nAnd it's like,\nnow I have to handle all of that now?\n\n218\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.170\nWhen all I want to do is cut and\nmake a story.\n\n219\n00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.580\nWhat I could do at the source level as\npart of, or that's the project level.\n\n220\n00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.400\nAs part of that beginning organization\nis to say, you know what?\n\n221\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:15.020\nThe right channel on this clip\nmake it the left channel.\n\n222\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.840\nSo now the left channel is in left and\nright, and\n\n223\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.630\nthe audio is clear in both channels, and\n\n224\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.860\nI've done this at the project level,\nand I could do that to multiple files.\n\n225\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:31.590\nAnd that's really what I want to do\nas part of this project organization.\n\n226\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.890\n>> Save yourself a little bit\nof administrative headache.\n\n227\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.400\n>> Save a lot of time, not only that,\nwe're going to, once we really,\n\n228\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:45.250\nreally get into a facts,\nI can save what I just did as a preset.\n\n229\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:54.620\nAnd I could say I could come down here and\nI can say GOODLEFT boom.\n\n230\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.460\nSo now the next time this happens, all I\nhave to do is go to my good left preset\n\n231\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.890\nand it's done, and I'm handling\nall of this in the project window.\n\n232\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.720\nI'm not trying to, and I see so many\npeople trying to do this, and I feel so\n\n233\n00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.020\nbad for them, because they're like okay,\nnow I have everything in a timeline.\n\n234\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.730\nAnd now I have to correct it,\nI have to correct everything,\n\n235\n00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.740\nwhen it could have been\nhandled in the project window.\n\n236\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.030\nSame thing with this guy,\ninterpret footage.\n\n237\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.450\nThis is one of my absolute\nfavorite things to work with\n\n238\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.350\nbecause right now it's saying,\nthis is 23.976.\n\n239\n00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.050\nOkay, or 24p.\n\n240\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.680\nEverybody knows there's 24p.\n\n241\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.120\nLet's say I create.\n\n242\n00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.160\nAnd this will, we're going to do so later.\n\n243\n00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.980\nI created 24 frame,\nthen I created 24 frame sequence, but\n\n244\n00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.500\nI've got some 60 frame per second footage.\n\n245\n00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.610\nIf I put those two together in a sequence,\nthat's 24,\n\n246\n00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.679\nthe 60 is going to look just fine.\n\n247\n00:13:49.768 --> 00:13:52.940\nIt's going to look just fine, but let's\nsay I wanted to run super slow motion.\n\n248\n00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.220\nWhat I could have done is said, hey,\n\n249\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.680\nat the source level assume that that's\n24 frames or in this case, 23.976.\n\n250\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.160\nAnd then it puts it\ninto super slow motion.\n\n251\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.888\nSo I'm able to change these things\nat this project level very nicely.\n\n252\n00:14:11.888 --> 00:14:19.830\nAlso, sometimes maybe you ended up and\nyou got something that was,\n\n253\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.780\nyou have a bunch of interlaced footage,\nbut then you have something progressive.\n\n254\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.700\nIt's like, at this level, I can say,\n\n255\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:33.020\ntake that progressive and conform it to an\nupper field first or a lower field first.\n\n256\n00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.460\nI can handle all of these\nhere at the project level.\n\n257\n00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.670\nThe other two has maybe got a graphic,\nand it has an alpha\n\n258\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.660\nchannel on it which is a transparency,\nis like I don't want an alpha channel,\n\n259\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.090\nunless you take it off,\nignore it, invert it.\n\n260\n00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.800\nOkay?\nSometimes people get the wrong, it's like,\n\n261\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.230\nwait, it's supposed to be black as white,\nwait,\n\n262\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.580\nis the alpha channel black,\nis the alpha channel white?\n\n263\n00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.100\nYou brought it in wrong, I can invert it.\n\n264\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.850\nAnd I can do all of these at the project\nlevel, it doesn't affect media.\n\n265\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.140\nIt just manages the metadata on that.\n\n266\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:09.570\nSo instead of, I'm going to do all these\nand get into timeline and then corrected.\n\n267\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:14.560\nIt's like I have the ability to do\nthis in the actual project window,\n\n268\n00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.540\nand that's part of the organization\nthat I can do is say, okay, blah, blah,\n\n269\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.320\nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n270\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:20.840\n>> It's cool.\n\n271\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.400\nIt really seems like\nan organizational filter.\n\n272\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.840\nSo I say, well here's my raw data or\nmy source.\n\n273\n00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.480\n>> Right.\n\n274\n00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.930\n>> But\njust kind of run it through here and\n\n275\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.160\nmake it look like this when\nit comes out the other end.\n\n276\n00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.350\n>> Right, and it's like-\n>> Even though the source\n\n277\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.960\nfile's not changed.\n\n278\n00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.505\n>> Yeah.\nAnd once I get cutting, and\n\n279\n00:15:33.505 --> 00:15:36.420\nonce I get telling the story,\nI don't want to have to go back and\n\n280\n00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.900\nsay, now I got to fix this,\nnow I got to fix that.\n\n281\n00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.700\nIt's like I'm making something,\nI want to make it.\n\n282\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.960\nIt's kind of like baking.\n\n283\n00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.455\nIt confounds me.\n\n284\n00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:48.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then you know,\n\n285\n00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.410\nusually when I forgot to put some\nstuff out that I was supposed to use,\n\n286\n00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.370\nand then it's like I'm halfway, and this\nis like, set them in and then, you know,\n\n287\n00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.180\nit's like when I should\nhave gotten it ready.\n\n288\n00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.060\nAnd that's what I'm doing right here,\nit seems boring.\n\n289\n00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.190\nBut it really,\nreally helps you if you get in there and\n\n290\n00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:10.090\nyou take care of those items,\nand then you get right into it.\n\n291\n00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.180\nSo that's really what this\nlesson was all about.\n\n292\n00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.090\nJust a quick thing of look,\nit doesn't have to be so elaborate.\n\n293\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.380\nIt doesn't have to be like\nI got to get in there.\n\n294\n00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.880\nIt can be as simple as you want it to be.\n\n295\n00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.410\nIt can be as elaborate as you want to be.\n\n296\n00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.360\nThat's the great thing that Adobe does,\nis how elaborate do you want it to be?\n\n297\n00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.680\nHow simple do you want it to be?\n\n298\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.000\nHere are all the options.\n\n299\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.120\n>> Well, that's great stuff.\n\n300\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.550\nObviously Adobe's not\nleaving any stone unturned.\n\n301\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.680\nThey're making it as simple as possible,\nbut still giving you the functionality,\n\n302\n00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.530\nas little or as much as you need, for\nwhatever your environment is calling for.\n\n303\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.150\nJames?\n>> Right.\n\n304\n00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.190\n>> We thank you for explaining this to us.\n\n305\n00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.600\n>> No problem.\n>> So that we can use this.\n\n306\n00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.670\nDo a better job at making things\neasier for our lives as we get into.\n\n307\n00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.097\nI know you wanted it so bad.\n\n308\n00:16:52.097 --> 00:16:52.700\n>> I know.\n\n309\n00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.330\n>> So guess what,\nwe'll do in our web reserved, and\n\n310\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.470\nyou'll actually get that to something.\n\n311\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.080\nSo that would be fun for\nall of us want it.\n\n312\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.244\n>> Will take it.\n>> Now, that being said,\n\n313\n00:16:58.244 --> 00:16:59.740\nlooks like we've come to\nthe end of this episode.\n\n314\n00:16:59.740 -->

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.330\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.310\nwe continue on with more on\nour series with Premiere Pro.\n\n6\n00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.850\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto keep lending his expertise on that,\n\n7\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.500\nget us informed, is our good friend Mr.\nJames Biddle.\n\n8\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.940\nJames, welcome back sir.\n\n9\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.770\nSo we're gonna have it in there.\n\n10\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.240\n>> Everybody,\nyeah it's good to see you again man.\n\n11\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.280\n>> Yeah man.\n>> Good, so\n\n12\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.600\nnow we have,\nwe've done a lot in the project window.\n\n13\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.600\nWe're gonna do a little more, and then\nwe're gonna get it into the source window.\n\n14\n00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.690\nI wanna show you something, Dan.\n\n15\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.240\nThis is my favorite thing\nthat I watch people do,\n\n16\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.230\ncuz they don't know some of the cool\nthings that you can do in Adobe.\n\n17\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.190\nI just made the project window bigger\nusing that hotkey of ours, the tilde or\n\n18\n00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.060\nthe A key as we set that in our keyboard,\nand\n\n19\n00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.690\nusually what people do,\nlet's say I've got some sync audio here.\n\n20\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.660\nI've loaded in some music.\n\n21\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.830\nLet's say I just want to get some of this\ngarden video into the source monitor and\n\n22\n00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.010\nstart editing it.\n\n23\n00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.740\nWhat most people do is they just\nstart double clicking like crazy,\n\n24\n00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.080\nit's like, okay,\nI'm gonna double click this one.\n\n25\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.360\nAnd then this one, and then when they come\nback, they double click again to load it.\n\n26\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240\nThere's actually a much easier method.\n\n27\n00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.540\nIf I go up here to Close All, now there's\nnothing back in the source window.\n\n28\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.859\nIf I make the project window bigger again,\nif I just highlight all of them,\n\n29\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.660\nif I had the source window I could just\ndrag them all into the source window.\n\n30\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.250\nOr, I can control click and say would you\njust open them in the source monitor?\n\n31\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.647\nAnd all I see is one but if I go up\nhere to the panel menu I can say,\n\n32\n00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:53.959\nokay now show me number four,\nnow show me number five, now show me this.\n\n33\n00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.140\nSo I can load up to 20 of them into\nthe source window and just scroll them.\n\n34\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.020\n>> It's no longer necessary to be Mr.\nJiminy Click-it.\n\n35\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.760\n>> Or most of the time I'm not even\nusing my mouse right now, look at that,\n\n36\n00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.030\nI'm going right through it with a hot key.\n\n37\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.030\n>> You are a wizard, sir.\n\n38\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.220\n>> I know, just call me,\njust the beard, where's my big staff.\n\n39\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.720\n>> That's right.\n\n40\n00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.760\n>> This actually really easy and\nyou can go through your footage very,\n\n41\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.780\nvery quickly.\n\n42\n00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.570\nIf we think about that clock face I\nmentioned a couple of lessons ago.\n\n43\n00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.690\nIf this one is one, source is two.\n\n44\n00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.640\nAnd all I have to do is say, shift one,\nand I go back to the project.\n\n45\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.780\nShift 2, I go to source.\n\n46\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.352\nIf I'm still on source and I keep\nclicking, it will scroll through that.\n\n47\n00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:38.047\nNow, what if you don't like the Shift key,\nit's like too much, and\n\n48\n00:02:38.047 --> 00:02:40.737\nwe've talked about that,\ntoo many acrobatics.\n\n49\n00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:45.163\nI could say, okay,\nI'll go to keyboard shortcuts and\n\n50\n00:02:45.163 --> 00:02:47.858\nI will type in the number two, and\n\n51\n00:02:47.858 --> 00:02:52.300\nokay source monitor is Shift+2,\nselect Camera 2.\n\n52\n00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.810\nOkay, look at this.\n\n53\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.760\nSource Monitor is Shift+2,\nSelect Camera 2 is 2.\n\n54\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.440\nAnd I'm gonna say, that's nice and all,\n\n55\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.239\nthink what I'm gonna do is just get rid\nof Shift+2 altogether and just make it 2.\n\n56\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.190\nAnd then they'll say,\nthat's already in use.\n\n57\n00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.900\nI mean like, I don't care.\n\n58\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.470\nAnd it switches it out,\nit be nice if I just had the number two.\n\n59\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.970\nAnd that's going to save to which one?\n\n60\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.159\nI'll put in the big window, Save As,\n\n61\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.180\nnow just hit Save, and\nnow it's saved on that one.\n\n62\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.110\nIt immediately went to custom cuz it\nthought I wanted to create a new keyboard,\n\n63\n00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.735\nbut I can just do it on the same one,\nand I'm just hitting the number two.\n\n64\n00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:40.130\nAnd it's gonna be great, and\nit's gonna be really cool, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.390\nJust hitting the number two.\n\n66\n00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.350\nVery, very happy thing, and\n\n67\n00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.870\nI loaded up some of my footage and\nI can look through it.\n\n68\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.950\nThis is something new that they\nadded a couple versions back.\n\n69\n00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.140\nWe know these as drag video only\nto make an edit, drag audio only.\n\n70\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.340\nNow without having to go into a menu, if\nI'm on drag audio only, I can just click\n\n71\n00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.140\nit and see the audio waveforms, which is\nmuch much simpler than it used to be.\n\n72\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.640\nIt's just a click, and\nI can click back to video and see that.\n\n73\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.400\nIt's really, really nice and\nreally, really convenient.\n\n74\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.340\nSo one of the things I am gonna do\nis I'm gonna load two more items.\n\n75\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.750\nI'm gonna come back down here to Project,\nmake this a big window, and I have a sync.\n\n76\n00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.210\nThis is something that a lot\nof people might need to do,\n\n77\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.750\nespecially if you're using DSLR cameras.\n\n78\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.630\nAnd I did this on a DSLR camera,\n\n79\n00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.260\nI recorded the audio separately from the\nvideo, and I need to put them together.\n\n80\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.510\nAnd believe it or not, the source\nwindow is a great way to do this.\n\n81\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.013\nFirst thing I'm gonna do though is\nI'm going to, I have it labeled out.\n\n82\n00:04:47.013 --> 00:04:50.300\nI have it labeled out as sync audio, and\n\n83\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.990\nnotice there is no video icon next\nto this, because its just audio.\n\n84\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.650\n>> That makes sense.\n\n85\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.868\n>> Yeah, well,\na lot of people dont get that.\n\n86\n00:04:58.868 --> 00:05:03.950\nSo boom, I'll load it up in there and\nI say to myself play it.\n\n87\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.370\nIt's going to be my lovely voice,\nbirds chirping.\n\n88\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.990\nLet's play a little bit.\n\n89\n00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.140\nHere we go.\n\n90\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.282\nI had to have somebody help me with this.\n\n91\n00:05:14.282 --> 00:05:15.850\nHi, I'm [INAUDIBLE] and I'm currently\ntraining you right now on Adobe Premiere.\n\n92\n00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.825\nOkay, those levels look a little bit low.\n\n93\n00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:19.530\nThey could be better.\n\n94\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.550\nWhat most people will do is they'll say,\nyou know what,\n\n95\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.050\nI'm going to load that into my Timeline\nand then I'm going to do it there.\n\n96\n00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.270\nI wanna talk a little bit about the idea\nthat we are currently on the left side\n\n97\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.280\nof the user interface, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.190\nI made sort of this line right here,\n\n99\n00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.720\nI moved things over so\nthat the source window and\n\n100\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.590\nthe project window are on the left side,\nprogram, timeline are on the right side.\n\n101\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.550\nAnd I'm going by what often times\neditors refer to as downstream,\n\n102\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.960\nwhen you're going from left to right.\n\n103\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.140\nThat's sort of the natural motion okay?\n\n104\n00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.110\nUnless we're reading anime [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n105\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.320\nIt's left to right,\nif it's anime it's right to left.\n\n106\n00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.600\nSo we're going left to right.\n\n107\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.400\nNow, what I wanna do on this side is\nrealize this is a clip, this is a clip.\n\n108\n00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.960\nAnd when I take this sync audio and\ncontrol click it, I have this ability\n\n109\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.650\nto do an audio gain right here.\n\n110\n00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.730\nAnd I can say this is kind of low and\nwhat I would like to do is\n\n111\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.810\nactually bring this up here instead\nof having to do it in the timeline.\n\n112\n00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.860\nWhen I do it in the timeline,\n\n113\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.840\nwhat I wanna do is make fine tuning to\nthose cool fades, feel like it's a mix.\n\n114\n00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.820\nI'm in the studio, man, I'm doing a mix.\n\n115\n00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.430\nRight here is like, this is just too low,\nI'm wanna correct this.\n\n116\n00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.160\nSo I'm gonna bump it up by six decibels.\n\n117\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.700\n>> And what made you choose six decibels?\n\n118\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.490\n>> Just random.\n\n119\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.150\n>> Sounds good.\n\n120\n00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.090\n>> I'm just going random.\n\n121\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.730\nSix is a nice number.\n\n122\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.000\nAnd because I can do this hit or miss.\n\n123\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.030\nAnd if I click OK, boom,\nwatch that wave form.\n\n124\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.590\nWave form got bigger.\n\n125\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.100\n>> It did.\n\n126\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.780\n>> And now if I click it.\n\n127\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.690\n>> Right now, we have a lot of preventive\nand a lot of bamboo back there.\n\n128\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.800\n>> And that's better, it's starting to\nget up, so I can say okay, one more time.\n\n129\n00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.510\nOkay, and here's the interesting part,\nif I go back to Audio Gain,\n\n130\n00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.210\nit'll say okay the gain has been set\nto 6 decibels so I'll do 6 more.\n\n131\n00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.420\nAnd now that's 12.\n\n132\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.350\n>> So it's aggregate?\n\n133\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.875\n>> Yeah, aggregate.\n\n134\n00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:21.500\nMm-hm.\n\n135\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.240\nBring it up.\n\n136\n00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.940\nThere it is.\n\n137\n00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.840\nHighlight that window.\n\n138\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.000\n>> To change it,\nwe're looking to change up the-\n\n139\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.080\n>> That sounds a lot better.\n\n140\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.195\nAnd it's a lot better than the audio\nthat came off of the camera.\n\n141\n00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:36.160\n>> And what a lovely singing\nvoice that man must have.\n\n142\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.270\n>> Thank you, I know.\n\n143\n00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.440\nI just occasionally, you know,\nthe shower, whatever.\n\n144\n00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.630\nI'm just so great.\n\n145\n00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.400\nSo what I'm gonna do now is I\nhave used ye old clap slate,\n\n146\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.050\nlike you've seen in the movies, boom.\n\n147\n00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.280\nOkay, so I have one.\n\n148\n00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.674\nIt's the oldest piece of\nproduction equipment I own, and\n\n149\n00:07:53.674 --> 00:07:55.204\nI'm gonna do a new trick.\n\n150\n00:07:55.204 --> 00:07:58.481\nMost people, when they come up\non something like source window,\n\n151\n00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:00.876\nwhat they do is they\nimmediately hit Spacebar.\n\n152\n00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:02.562\nAnd spacebar's great.\n\n153\n00:08:02.562 --> 00:08:04.587\nIt plays.\n\n154\n00:08:04.587 --> 00:08:06.030\nOkay?\n\n155\n00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.040\nGoing backwards means I have\nto grab the blue play head.\n\n156\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.710\nNotice?\n\n157\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.030\nBlue, like my shirt.\n\n158\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.540\nEverything that's active and usable, blue.\n\n159\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.130\nSo I can pick that up and\nscroll back, play again.\n\n160\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.740\nOr if I put my hands on J, K, and L, and\n\n161\n00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:29.390\nthis works in several windows,\nif I hit L, playhead will move forward.\n\n162\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.200\nIf I hit K, it will pause.\n\n163\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.440\nIf I hit J, it will move backward.\n\n164\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:42.495\nSo now, if I hold down K and\ntap L, I will go forward\n\n165\n00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:47.602\na frame at a time until\nI hear the initial clap.\n\n166\n00:08:47.602 --> 00:08:50.417\n[SOUND] Right there, and\nI've heard the clap.\n\n167\n00:08:50.417 --> 00:08:54.040\nSo I can hold down K, press L,\nand go forward a frame at a time.\n\n168\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.870\nAnd I'm using transport controls just\non the fly with my hand, J, K, and L.\n\n169\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.910\nI know some people who are editors,\nthey've been editing forever.\n\n170\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.000\nAnd those are the only hotkeys they use.\n\n171\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.270\nAnd they do a great job with it.\n\n172\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.939\nSo now, I need to put what's\ncalled a syncing point.\n\n173\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.320\nDown at the bottom,\nwe have the transfer controls.\n\n174\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.110\nA lot of people love using these.\n\n175\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.360\nAnd that's like that's your play, okay,\n\n176\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.890\nyou can step back one frame,\nstep forward one frame.\n\n177\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.800\nSo, instead of using J, K and\nL, I could use these buttons.\n\n178\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.560\nOkay?\n\n179\n00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.220\nI can mark an in point, I can mark an out\npoint, which we're gonna do very soon.\n\n180\n00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.590\nWe can also add a marker.\n\n181\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.510\nNow for doing something like an audio\nsync, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.\n\n182\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.090\nI'm going to drop a marker, boom, and\nthere's the little green guy says,\n\n183\n00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.380\nyou've dropped the marker and\nyou've marked it right there.\n\n184\n00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.800\nIt also shows you, by the way,\nthat that's a marker.\n\n185\n00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.280\nThey give you two things to make sure that\nyou can see it, which is really nice.\n\n186\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.950\nGonna come back down to this window.\n\n187\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.410\nThere is the project.\n\n188\n00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.790\nMake that full screen.\n\n189\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:03.019\nAnd what I need under my,\nLet's see, the garden interview.\n\n190\n00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.112\nThat's me.\n\n191\n00:10:05.112 --> 00:10:09.035\nAnd I will now double-click this one and\nload it in there.\n\n192\n00:10:09.035 --> 00:10:11.085\nAnd I will now find me.\n\n193\n00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:15.380\nOkay, and there's my clap slate.\n\n194\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.490\nLook it's got all\nthe information on it too.\n\n195\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.500\nNow in this case,\nI'll use these buttons to step forward.\n\n196\n00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.920\nOkay, I'm gonna use these.\n\n197\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.750\nAnd go, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.\n\n198\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.120\nOkay and you play, pause.\n\n199\n00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.689\n>> See the arm?\n\n200\n00:10:31.689 --> 00:10:33.179\n>> Yes.\n\n201\n00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:38.363\n>> Now play forward.\n\n202\n00:10:38.363 --> 00:10:39.140\nBoom.\n\n203\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:46.257\nStep back [SOUND] until boom,\nI've got the clap slate.\n\n204\n00:10:46.257 --> 00:10:50.440\nOkay and\nthen drop another marker which is fun.\n\n205\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.960\nI mean it's like usually people\ndo this in a different way and\n\n206\n00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.880\nit can be kind of a problem.\n\n207\n00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.990\nI'll come back down here and\n\n208\n00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:02.570\nI'll say all right I have\nthe video highlighted down here.\n\n209\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.230\nNow I have to do, if I hold down\nthe command key, I can highlight both.\n\n210\n00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.430\nAnd that's just like in most applications.\n\n211\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.870\nIf you use like a command or control key,\nyou can highlight multiple things.\n\n212\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.470\nLike doing the shift key\nyou can do everything.\n\n213\n00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.890\nI will control click just one of them,\nand then I will say merge clips.\n\n214\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.500\nAnd it's going to give me options.\n\n215\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.720\nIt will say, am i synchronizing this\naudio and video by an endpoint?\n\n216\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.840\nDidn't use that, did not use out points,\n\n217\n00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.510\ndid not use timecode,\nI used a clip marker.\n\n218\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.340\nNow the other cool thing, if i wanted to,\nI could do it by audio waveforms.\n\n219\n00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.170\nSince I recorded audio on the camera and\nI recorded on the audio recorder,\n\n220\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.400\nI could say match up the two audio\nwave forms, and have it sync that way.\n\n221\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.220\nI decided to go ahead and\n\n222\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.580\nuse clip markers just to show you\nthis prolonged extended method,\n\n223\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.243\nespecially if sometimes you're using\na camera and nobody recorded audio on it.\n\n224\n00:11:55.243 --> 00:11:57.123\nThat's why you kind of\nwant to do a safety.\n\n225\n00:11:57.123 --> 00:12:00.351\n>> And is there a better or\nworse way of doing this,\n\n226\n00:12:00.351 --> 00:12:03.750\nlike should you have used- [CROSSTALK]\n>> Preferred methods.\n\n227\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.140\nI've often had, you know,\nin this case, the audio needs to be,\n\n228\n00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.510\nI don't want to say pristine,\nbut it has to be pretty good.\n\n229\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.320\nBut I've run into some\nsituations where the audio and\n\n230\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.250\nthe camera is just completely gone.\n\n231\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.120\nSo I'm gonna have to use something like\na clip marker or something like that.\n\n232\n00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.110\nAnd I'm going to say remove\naudio from the video clip,\n\n233\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.810\ncuz I don't want an audio redundancy.\n\n234\n00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.780\nSometimes I want the old audio and the new\nvideo on there, I don't want that one.\n\n235\n00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.420\n>> It's not like tracking metal\nguitars where we have like 12 guitars.\n\n236\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.190\n>> No [CROSSTALK]\n>> Okay, love it.\n\n237\n00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:37.390\nAnd then we'll click OK and\nI do not get a new clip, I just\n\n238\n00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.430\nget a new piece of metadata that says okay\nyou have now merged these two together.\n\n239\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.144\nHere they are.\n\n240\n00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:49.849\nAnd I now have the much better audio on\nit that I recorded on the better audio\n\n241\n00:12:49.849 --> 00:12:50.950\nrecorder.\n\n242\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.020\nAnd it's all set.\n\n243\n00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.110\n>> Now you said this was, the way you're\ndoing it right now is different than\n\n244\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.670\na way a lot of people doing\nit can cause a problem.\n\n245\n00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.211\nWhat way is that specifically?\n\n246\n00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:02.407\n>> Sometimes what they'll do\nis they'll put the audio and\n\n247\n00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:05.195\nthe video in the timeline and\nthen they'll try,\n\n248\n00:13:05.195 --> 00:13:08.730\nthey'll take forever to line it up and\nthen pull it back.\n\n249\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.030\nWhich is fine, I mean,\nif you feel comfortable with that.\n\n250\n00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.040\nThat's okay.\n\n251\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.160\nBut in the case of this workflow,\nyou're adding some metadata that you don't\n\n252\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.970\nreally get when you do it in\nthe timeline that way, and\n\n253\n00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.790\nI'm one of these people when I'm in\nthe timeline I like to do story.\n\n254\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.800\nI like to really work on my story.\n\n255\n00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.760\nIf I can handle this at the source level\nwhen I'm doing my primary organization,\n\n256\n00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.050\nthat's where I really, really prefer it.\n\n257\n00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.280\n>> So you never start spinning your\nwheels trying to do other editing types.\n\n258\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.210\n>> Right.\nIt's like okay, now I have to back up and\n\n259\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.390\ndo some procedural stuff.\n\n260\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.980\nAnd here I'm doing the procedural stuff.\n\n261\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.980\nSo here's me.\n\n262\n00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.760\nAnd yeah, boy.\n\n263\n00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.830\nI look great.\n\n264\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.780\n>> Hi, I'm Jim Biddle and I'm-\n>> Yeah.\n\n265\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.140\nThat's interesting.\n\n266\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.720\nSo just using J, K, and L.\n\n267\n00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.850\nI'm going through here,\nand what I'm gonna do is,\n\n268\n00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.970\nI'm gonna make some segments, as they say.\n\n269\n00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.010\nRight now, this is a clip,\nI'm gonna make segments.\n\n270\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:59.520\nWhen I put them into this sequence,\nthey become a segment.\n\n271\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.530\nThey're a segment of\nthe clip that I have used.\n\n272\n00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:08.690\nThe way we often define this is\nwhat these two people right here,\n\n273\n00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.070\nin point and out point.\n\n274\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.820\nNow, there's, when some people first start\nworking with something like this, they\n\n275\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:21.570\nsay, okay, so if I take multiple parts\nof the clip and put it into sequence,\n\n276\n00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:26.390\ndon't I have to make a duplicate of the\nclip to take the other part and take it?\n\n277\n00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:31.860\nNo, once you've created a segment and\nput it into a timeline, it remembers that.\n\n278\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.040\nSo let me give you an example.\n\n279\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.290\nLet's say I'm just going to define\na segment here at the front.\n\n280\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.972\nOkay I'm going backwards.\n\n281\n00:14:44.764 --> 00:14:45.480\n>> Hi.\n\n282\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.580\n>> And just, I'll go back behind the hi.\n\n283\n00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.570\nNow that little trick is by\nholding down the K key and\n\n284\n00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.000\nholding down J at the same time.\n\n285\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.580\n>> You sound like Optimus Prime,\nit's awesome.\n\n286\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.730\n>> I know it's great,\nit's awesome, it's like yeah.\n\n287\n00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.150\nJust do that all the time.\n\n288\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.380\nAnd then I'll say end point.\n\n289\n00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.970\nThat's what I want.\n\n290\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.670\nHi, I'm Jim Bittle and I'm currently\ntraining you right now on Adobe Premiere.\n\n291\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.620\nOkay, that's fine.\n\n292\n00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.750\nI'm gonna leave it like that with\na little breathe and a little turnaway.\n\n293\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.500\nI'm gonna leave it like that and\njust say, you know what,\n\n294\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.830\nthis is the point where it is out,\nand that is the defined segment\n\n295\n00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.880\nright there that I want to put in\nthe timeline to become a sequence.\n\n296\n00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.290\nThat is what I want.\n\n297\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:35.830\nOne of the more interesting\nthings in Adobe is now what?\n\n298\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.320\nDo I go and do all of my clips?\n\n299\n00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.390\nDo I do all this?\n\n300\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.460\nYou can do it anyway that you\nfeel comfortable with, okay.\n\n301\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.460\nIf you wanna go through and\ndo all of your clips and\n\n302\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.750\nmark some things in there, go right ahead.\n\n303\n00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.510\nIf you want to make sub\nclips we can do that.\n\n304\n00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.371\nWe're gonna do some sub clips next time.\n\n305\n00:15:53.371 --> 00:15:59.031\nIf you want to just get in a sequence, do\nwhatever, there's no standard work flow.\n\n306\n00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:04.228\nDo what you feel you're\ncomfortable with and then move on.\n\n307\n00:16:04.228 --> 00:16:06.533\nIt's like next time it's like okay,\nI'm gonna try this next time,\n\n308\n00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:07.583\nI'm gonna try that next time.\n\n309\n00:16:07.583 --> 00:16:11.480\nIt's a great way to learn how\nto get into Adobe Premiere.\n\n310\n00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.270\nSo what I've done, is I've just\ndefined this first segment right here.\n\n311\n00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.560\nNext up, is creating an actual sequence.\n\n312\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.880\nNow there's some sorta name,\nokay with this.\n\n313\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.860\nThe timeline itself, this guy right\nhere where you see all the blocks and\n\n314\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.600\nall the cool stuff,\nthat is an actual tool.\n\n315\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.450\nWhat you have in a timeline is a sequence,\nso\n\n316\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.380\nthe timeline is the tool that\nyou build the sequence in.\n\n317\n00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:45.450\nRight now, it will say drop\nmedia here to create a sequence.\n\n318\n00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:49.510\nI could have also simply gone to\na piece of media in the project,\n\n319\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.218\ngone control click and\nsaid new sequence from clip,\n\n320\n00:16:55.218 --> 00:16:59.498\nor File,\n\n321\n00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:04.139\nNew, Sequence, and\ngotten this gigantic dialog.\n\n322\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:12.060\nAnd that's where people will say,\nWhich one should I do?\n\n323\n00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.295\n>> That dialog one looks awesome.\n\n324\n00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:17.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it looks awesome to the point\n\n325\n00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.240\nwhere people look at it and go, nope.\n\n326\n00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.170\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> And\nthen never go back to it again.\n\n327\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.120\n>> Run.\n[LAUGH] >> It's not as scary as it seems.\n\n328\n00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.010\nIt just looks scary, it's like, there's\na lot of words on here I don't use at all.\n\n329\n00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:31.200\nWell basically if I'm\nlooking at this clip.\n\n330\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.540\nThis is the clip, it's in 24 frames\nper second and it's a 1280 by 720 and\n\n331\n00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.750\nI have decided that the final\nthing I'm going to make.\n\n332\n00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:46.929\nThe final file I'm sending out of here\nis going to be 1280 by 7 In twenty.\n\n333\n00:17:46.929 --> 00:17:51.540\nSo I could have done,\nmake a new sequence from this clip.\n\n334\n00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.520\nBecause all of those settings from\nthe clip will become the sequence.\n\n335\n00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.055\nOr I could say I'm going\nto click in the center, and\n\n336\n00:18:00.055 --> 00:18:05.655\ndrop this media right here in\nthe timeline, let go, and there we are.\n\n337\n00:18:05.655 --> 00:18:09.985\nAnd the sequence now has\nbeen created right here.\n\n338\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.940\nAnd it is 239 by 976.\n\n339\n00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.090\nAnd it's named itself\nafter the piece of media.\n\n340\n00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.080\nWhich I don't particularly like.\n\n341\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.500\nI'm going to say, Garden Sequence.\n\n342\n00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.490\nAnd I'm just,\nI'm one of these people, one.\n\n343\n00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.830\nI like to put numbers on mine.\n\n344\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.970\nOkay, I like to put numbers on mine.\n\n345\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.920\nAnd there it is.\n\n346\n00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.760\nI have created this garden sequence one.\n\n347\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.820\nAnd it's completely out of whack so\nto speak, which is just fine.\n\n348\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.370\nIt's absolutely just fine for now.\n\n349\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.230\nBut that's what I've\ndone is I've said okay.\n\n350\n00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.980\nI have created this sequence.\n\n351\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.950\nNow one thing I'm gonna do, so\nyou can see a little better,\n\n352\n00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.380\nis I'm going to move this line\nwhere I said left side, right side.\n\n353\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.930\nMove that over.\n\n354\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.100\nGive myself some more screen real estate.\n\n355\n00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:00.500\nOn this timeline and then just\nlike any other window, pop it up.\n\n356\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.220\nOkay, so basically editing,\nwhen we say editing,\n\n357\n00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:10.560\nwe are going from the source to\nthe timeline to create a sequence.\n\n358\n00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.550\nAnd this the video and\naudio that's associated with it.\n\n359\n00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.880\nAnd I can pick it up, I can move it\nall the way back to the beginning.\n\n360\n00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.010\nOr I could do something really cool\nwhere I could control click this and\n\n361\n00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:26.570\nsay ripple delete that, then it will\ngo all the way back to the beginning.\n\n362\n00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.120\nSo there's all kinds of tricks.\n\n363\n00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.020\nThe thing that's cool about the timeline\ntools, there's all kinds of tricks\n\n364\n00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.390\nthat you can do in this to\nmake your life so much easier.\n\n365\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.450\nThis would be, so now, watch me play it.\n\n366\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:46.280\n>> Hi, I'm Jim Mill, and I'm currently\ntraining you right now on Adobe Premiere.\n\n367\n00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.370\n>> Okay, and I got a little breath\nin there, which is to me just fine.\n\n368\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.400\nWhat if I wanted to put\nanother segment of me on this?\n\n369\n00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:03.800\nI could go back to the source, hit L,\n>> Backyard\n\n370\n00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.960\n>> My wife and\n\n371\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.390\nI bought this house last year and-\n>> I'm going to cut,\n\n372\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.030\nI'm going to get rid of all that stuff.\n\n373\n00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.410\nPut an end point right there, play.\n\n374\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.930\n>> The reason why I'm shooting today is\n>> It's a beautiful day.\n\n375\n00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.680\nI haven't seen my backyard in about\na month because I've been on vacation.\n\n376\n00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.430\nAnd we're looking to change it.\n\n377\n00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.850\nWe're looking to change up the garden,\nget rid of the grass,\n\n378\n00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.090\nmaybe turn the back area\ninto a forageable area.\n\n379\n00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.930\nBecause right now we have-\n>> Boom, now instead of stopping it,\n\n380\n00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.770\nI just hit the o key, which is out point.\n\n381\n00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.290\nAnd the way I can know that is\n>> Look at that, if I hover over this,\n\n382\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.710\nit says, look the out point is O.\n\n383\n00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.180\nSo is the in point is I.\n\n384\n00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.300\nI come back over here.\n\n385\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.920\nMost people would just say,\nokay now I can just drag it back over.\n\n386\n00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.760\nOf course you can.\n\n387\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.830\nYou can just easily go whoop, right\nthere and drop it right at that point.\n\n388\n00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.590\nPull the play head back.\n\n389\n00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.520\n>> Hi, I am Tim Mill and I'm currently\ntraining you right now on Adobe Premier.\n\n390\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.210\nAnd the reason why-\n>> Guess what?\n\n391\n00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:07.870\nThat's a jump cut.\n\n392\n00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.120\nI'm gonna show you something\nreally cool later on in effects.\n\n393\n00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.660\nI'm gonna leave that.\n\n394\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.090\nI can make the jump cut disappear.\n\n395\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:19.850\nI can use a new effect in Adobe Premier\nto make the jump cut disappear.\n\n396\n00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.780\n>> The heck you say.\n\n397\n00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.692\n>> I wouldn't lie to you.\n\n398\n00:21:21.692 --> 00:21:23.461\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wouldn't lie to you,\n\n399\n00:21:23.461 --> 00:21:25.630\nwouldn't lie to you guys either.\n\n400\n00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.670\n>> Megan on the other hand.\n\n401\n00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.790\n>> Maybe, maybe the switcher.\n\n402\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.150\nMy luck.\n>> Maybe this will cheer you, no, no,\n\n403\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:29.730\nno, no, not now.\n\n404\n00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:34.050\nBut I'm going to leave that because\nI can always change it later.\n\n405\n00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.840\nI can always change that later and\nI can trim it out.\n\n406\n00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.218\nThese are simple insert edits.\n\n407\n00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:46.560\nOkay, what if I decided I wanted to\ninsert, I'm just taking my playhead\n\n408\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.842\nhere in the timeline they say, right\nthere, I wanna put something right there.\n\n409\n00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:54.990\nI wanna put something right there,\nI wanna put a new shot right there.\n\n410\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:03.700\nI've been making a big deal about,\nthese two windows are on the left side.\n\n411\n00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.048\nThese two are on the right side.\n\n412\n00:22:06.048 --> 00:22:15.460\nPlease note these are on the left side,\nthese are on the right side.\n\n413\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.281\nThese three represent what I\nhave in the source window.\n\n414\n00:22:20.281 --> 00:22:27.550\nSo I have a video and two audios in\nthe source Window that I am working with.\n\n415\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.900\nSo let me just throw this out of order.\n\n416\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.410\nLet me find a new shot.\n\n417\n00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.080\n>> We cleaned out, so\nI'm doing this video so\n\n418\n00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.850\nyou can see what it's\nlike to shoot outdoors.\n\n419\n00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:41.160\nMake a little video that's\nabout 15 to 30 seconds.\n\n420\n00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.740\nBoom, and I'll put in an out point.\n\n421\n00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.330\nOkay, I did that with first with I and\nthen by hitting the key.\n\n422\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:52.220\nAnd now,\nwhat if I want it to go right there?\n\n423\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:58.650\nTo essentially make a cut, drop in right\nthere and push all the rest of this.\n\n424\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:03.500\nOver, most people would think okay I\nneed some kind of tool to make a cut\n\n425\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.320\nthen I have to pull it and all that.\n\n426\n00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.920\nThe simplified way, couple ways,\nif I come down here\n\n427\n00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.950\nto the symbols in my transport\ncontrols I can simply hit Insert.\n\n428\n00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.760\nNow the great thing about Adobe again,\n\n429\n00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.820\nis something that You know some people\nfind it frustrating, other people love it.\n\n430\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.970\nThere's like four or five different\nways to do the exact same thing and\n\n431\n00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.050\ndepending on how you're working,\n\n432\n00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.290\nhaving those four of five different\nways is actually pretty great.\n\n433\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:32.860\nSo lets say I am going to put\nthis segment right there.\n\n434\n00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:38.520\nNow, some of your are like,\nwell how is that going to line up?\n\n435\n00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.440\nSince I have an endpoint,\nhere in the source,\n\n436\n00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.940\nit's going to line up with that play\nhead and then it will simple make a cut,\n\n437\n00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.390\npush that out of the way, the length of\nthe actual segment, which is very cool.\n\n438\n00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:55.924\nI can do this in one of a blue\nmillion ways, now blue, ha.\n\n439\n00:23:55.924 --> 00:24:01.881\nHere is the symbol for insert,\nthat is also a hot button in the transport\n\n440\n00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:07.167\ncontrols for it so I can say okay\nif i just push that it will do it?\n\n441\n00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:09.181\nYep, so it'll do it that way.\n\n442\n00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:10.160\nAnd it made an insert.\n\n443\n00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.160\nIt just inserted it right in there.\n\n444\n00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.050\nNow, somebody will say, well,\nwhat if I don't like that one?\n\n445\n00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.550\nWell, do you like your mouse?\n\n446\n00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.882\nAnd they'll say I love my mouse.\n\n447\n00:24:20.882 --> 00:24:26.272\nI'll say, okay, why don't you\npick it up and drag it over here,\n\n448\n00:24:26.272 --> 00:24:32.260\nand then it gives you a listing of all\nkinds of things that you can choose.\n\n449\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.040\nYou can choose an insert.\n\n450\n00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.340\nYou can choose an overlay.\n\n451\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.600\nYou can insert it after.\n\n452\n00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.810\nIt's like, oops,\nI have the playhead in the wrong spot.\n\n453\n00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.580\nI wanted to actually do it after that one.\n\n454\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.030\nOr I wanted to do it before that one.\n\n455\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.070\nI just wanna do a simple insert.\n\n456\n00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.630\nSo I'm just gonna do an insert,\nlines the endpoint up with that playhead.\n\n457\n00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.160\nBoom, same exact thing.\n\n458\n00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.130\n>> I'm gobsmacked.\n\n459\n00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.630\n>> Okay.\n>> That's amazing.\n\n460\n00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:00.460\n>> Some people will say I like\ndragging from here into the timeline.\n\n461\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.830\nAbsolutely fine, once again.\n\n462\n00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.642\nIf I click and drag it, here's the issue.\n\n463\n00:25:06.642 --> 00:25:09.033\nYou're gonna see a little\nwidget right there.\n\n464\n00:25:09.033 --> 00:25:09.670\nI'll zoom that in for you.\n\n465\n00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.940\nAnd what it does is say, okay, that's not\nan insert, though, that's an overwrite.\n\n466\n00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.930\nAnd it's like that's not what\nI want in this situation.\n\n467\n00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.550\nBut if I quote unquote take command\nof it and hold down the Cmd key,\n\n468\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:27.260\nnow it's making the symbol for\nan insert and it does all the arrows.\n\n469\n00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.143\nBoom, does the exact the same thing.\n\n470\n00:25:31.143 --> 00:25:37.760\nLast item, if I come over here,\nthis insert just says, look, comma.\n\n471\n00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.070\nI could circumvent all that and\njust be Mr. Hotkey and\n\n472\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.830\ngo boom, comma, there it is,\nand I've made an insert.\n\n473\n00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:46.650\n>> My mind is blown.\n\n474\n00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.770\n>> You have your mind blown?\n\n475\n00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.020\nLet me blow your mind one more time.\n\n476\n00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.780\n>> No more mind to blow.\n\n477\n00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:58.699\n>> Let's say, I wanted to do that exact\nsame thing, but I didn't want the audio.\n\n478\n00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.300\nI just wanted the video.\n\n479\n00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.929\nWhat most people do is they'll\nbring everything over and\n\n480\n00:26:05.929 --> 00:26:08.886\nthen they'll lasso the audio and\nthen delete it.\n\n481\n00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:10.549\nI don't have to do that.\n\n482\n00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:14.260\nWhen it's blue, it's active and\nit's changeable in Adobe.\n\n483\n00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.230\nI am not going to worry about\nthis right side whatsoever.\n\n484\n00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.050\nJust the left side.\n\n485\n00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.850\nSo, if you don't want the audio,\nI can simply take out A1 and\n\n486\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.400\nA2 on this left side.\n\n487\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.460\nDon't care about the right side.\n\n488\n00:26:31.605 --> 00:26:34.995\nIf I just hit Insert, boom, there it is.\n\n489\n00:26:34.995 --> 00:26:37.395\nNo audio, because I told you,\nyou don't need it.\n\n490\n00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:40.680\nJust give me an insert,\njust the video, boom.\n\n491\n00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.681\nInsert, same thing.\n\n492\n00:26:45.681 --> 00:26:48.060\nIf I do the hot key, same thing.\n\n493\n00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.480\nThe only time it's gonna change is if\nI drag it from here into the timeline.\n\n494\n00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:57.580\nI would simply drag video only,\nand then do it.\n\n495\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.000\nSo, that's a little bit different.\n\n496\n00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.440\nIt doesn't react to this side in the same\nway because you have this option.\n\n497\n00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.628\n>> Important safety tip, right?\n\n498\n00:27:05.628 --> 00:27:06.967\n>> Important safety tip, you know.\n\n499\n00:27:06.967 --> 00:27:08.367\n>> Gotta make sure you're using\nthe right controls there.\n\n500\n00:27:08.367 --> 00:27:10.553\n>> Yeah,\njust make sure the right controls.\n\n501\n00:27:10.553 --> 00:27:13.388\nAnd that's because, most times when\npeople are doing this by dragging into\n\n502\n00:27:13.388 --> 00:27:15.510\nthe timeline,\nthey don't really care about this.\n\n503\n00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:19.420\nI don't like this, or I don't really use\nit, so I'm just gonna do it this way.\n\n504\n00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.460\nWhich is absolutely fine,\nyou pick what you wanna do.\n\n505\n00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.315\nLastly, just wanna take a look at a couple\nof items in here that you'll probably be\n\n506\n00:27:26.315 --> 00:27:26.890\ninterested in.\n\n507\n00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:31.760\nNotice, I have,\nit shows me all kinds of great symbols.\n\n508\n00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.380\nI can go to the in point, I can go to\nthe out point, and it shows me here.\n\n509\n00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:41.380\nWith that, I have the ability to, wow,\nI wonder if I can go straight to that\n\n510\n00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:46.610\nmarker without click, cuz kinda\nfinding it's not really a happy thing.\n\n511\n00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.825\nIf I hit this plus sign,\nlet me see something here.\n\n512\n00:27:49.825 --> 00:27:51.179\nI wonder if there's a go to?\n\n513\n00:27:51.179 --> 00:27:52.513\nThere is!\n\n514\n00:27:52.513 --> 00:27:54.210\nThere are these go to markers.\n\n515\n00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.480\nAnd what I could say is I really\nlike that, can I put that here?\n\n516\n00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.920\nAnd can I put that one there?\n\n517\n00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.345\nAnd then say OK, and\nnow I can go straight to the marker?\n\n518\n00:28:06.345 --> 00:28:09.530\nYes, and I have that symbol as well.\n\n519\n00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.357\n>> Okay, so I thought I was not\ngonna have my mind blown yet again.\n\n520\n00:28:13.357 --> 00:28:15.639\nUnfortunately, you proved me wrong.\n\n521\n00:28:15.639 --> 00:28:16.415\n>> That's all I got for you.\n\n522\n00:28:16.415 --> 00:28:17.640\n>> That was pretty good,\nthat was pretty good.\n\n523\n00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.140\nI like that.\n\n524\n00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.793\n>> Yeah, so this is just some basic edits,\nwith some inserts.\n\n525\n00:28:21.793 --> 00:28:25.420\nIn the next one, we're gonna try\nsome overwrites and some new stuff.\n\n526\n00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:25.980\nSo, yeah.\n\n527\n00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.512\n>> Well very cool, I actually-\n>> Let's get to it!\n\n528\n00:28:27.512 --> 00:28:28.048\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n529\n00:28:28.048 --> 00:28:31.484\nI actually feel like I could\njump into Premiere right now and\n\n530\n00:28:31.484 --> 00:28:33.419\ndo a bit of editing and get going.\n\n531\n00:28:33.419 --> 00:28:34.245\n>> Good.\n\n532\n00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:36.680\n>> So, this has been awesome stuff, and\nI know you've got a whole lot more for us.\n\n533\n00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.620\nBut our clock has dwindled\ndown to the nothing land and\n\n534\n00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.190\nwe have to come to an end for\nthis episode.\n\n535\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.530\nBut there's another one coming up,\nso you guys should check that out.\n\n536\n00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:46.928\nJames, thanks so much for stopping by.\n\n537\n00:28:46.928 --> 00:28:49.283\n>> Hey, once again,\nI'm ready to go next time.\n\n538\n00:28:49.283 --> 00:28:50.043\n>> Yeah, we appreciate it.\n\n539\n00:28:50.043 --> 00:28:52.929\nHope you've enjoyed it so\nfar, we've got more to come.\n\n540\n00:28:52.929 --> 00:28:55.927\nThanks for watching, we're going to\ngo ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n541\n00:28:55.927 --> 00:28:57.135\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n542\n00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:57.970\n>> I'm James Wittel.\n\n543\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.884\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n544\n00:28:59.884

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.910\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.120\nIn today's episode,\nwe move forward on more of our series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.370\nOn Premiere Pro, and\ngracing our studio with his presence yet\n\n7\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.570\nagain today is our good friend,\nMr. James Biddle.\n\n8\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.950\nJames, sir, so glad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.550\n>> Thank you, thank you, thank you,\ngood to see you, good to see all of you.\n\n10\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.315\nAll right, from what I can see.\n\n11\n00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:38.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so here's the deal.\n\n12\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.640\nWe're gonna move on quickly to\nthe program monitor and the timeline.\n\n13\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.710\nAnd you're gonna see some similarities\nwith the source monitor, but\n\n14\n00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.730\nthe cool thing is,\nonce you get into the program in time, so\n\n15\n00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.700\nmany more new things that you can\ncontrol and make settings for.\n\n16\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.290\nSo I'm going to go back real\nquick to my source monitor.\n\n17\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.400\nI want you to notice something.\n\n18\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.780\nLast time I added an extra\ncouple of buttons there, okay?\n\n19\n00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.350\nI added the go to previous marker,\ngo to next marker.\n\n20\n00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.900\nIf I tighten up this window a little bit,\n\n21\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.420\nnotice once again we will\nget one of these overflows.\n\n22\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.390\nAnd I'll say look, add marker, and\n\n23\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.570\ngo to previous marker, are not seeing,\nbut are still available.\n\n24\n00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.350\nOkay?\nSo if you squeeze up your Windows\n\n25\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.380\nway too much, not only will\nyou get one of those up here,\n\n26\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.330\nyou will get some of those down here, with\nwhat are known as your transport controls.\n\n27\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.530\nIf you're one of those really\ninteresting people that says,\n\n28\n00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.680\nhey I don't need transport controls,\nI know all my hot keys.\n\n29\n00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.655\nGuess what,\nthe wrench deals a lot with settings.\n\n30\n00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:46.165\nSo if I go to Settings I can say,\nI'm going to scroll down here,\n\n31\n00:01:46.165 --> 00:01:49.395\nI can say I don't want to show\nthose transport controls.\n\n32\n00:01:49.395 --> 00:01:55.530\nBoom, even more real estate for you,\nyou hotkey user you, but again that's\n\n33\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.470\njust one of those options, I'm gonna\nput them back on so I feel safe again.\n\n34\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.300\nAll right, if I come back\nover to program and timeline,\n\n35\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.870\nnotice they move simultaneously.\n\n36\n00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.680\nOkay, they move simultaneously,\nbecause this is where you build\n\n37\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.330\nin the timeline that everybody's\ngonna see up here is,\n\n38\n00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.740\nthis is what they're going\nto end up seeing, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.750\nWhen the edits actually happen,\nthis is what it's going to look like,\n\n40\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.670\ndown here is where you control it.\n\n41\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.110\nCouple things up in this window that\nare very much like in the source window.\n\n42\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.890\nNotice this is blue.\n\n43\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.250\nThat's the playhead position.\n\n44\n00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.350\nSo if I click it and move it,\nI can do that in time.\n\n45\n00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.590\nI can also type in values to say,\nI want to go straight to five seconds, and\n\n46\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.600\nit will take me right there.\n\n47\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.680\nSo I could do this let's see, five.\n\n48\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.680\nBoom, and it takes me to five seconds,\nthat's a placeholder.\n\n49\n00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.000\nSo if I had just done five, that is five\nframes, if I do five, come here you.\n\n50\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.350\nLet's say I wanna go to exactly\nfive seconds, five frames,\n\n51\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.730\nfive seconds, boom and\nit will take me right there.\n\n52\n00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.730\nBecause, yes, I can put ins and\n\n53\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.770\nouts points in the timeline to do\nremovals or a different type of edit.\n\n54\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.890\nWhat I was doing before was in\nthe source monitor I was saying okay,\n\n55\n00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.718\nI want this much distance,\nput it here in the timeline, do this.\n\n56\n00:03:18.718 --> 00:03:24.520\nIn a timeline I can say hey,\nI wanna cover up this much distance and\n\n57\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.130\nhave a fill in we're gonna\ndo that in the next lesson.\n\n58\n00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.935\nSo, that's why we have the ability\nto do ins and out points here.\n\n59\n00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:38.085\nAgain, I have another plus on this one,\nso I can add more not only that there's\n\n60\n00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:43.875\na lot more that I can add to it because,\nin the timeline I can record voice over,\n\n61\n00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:50.140\nI can check Closed Captions and\nI can do multi-camera editing.\n\n62\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.190\nLook at that new stuff.\n\n63\n00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.800\nI can toggle displays.\n\n64\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.140\nThere is a lot that I can do\n\n65\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.890\nin this monitor compared to the source\nmonitor because of what I am doing.\n\n66\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.000\nFit to window is going to come into\nplay when we start doing some effects.\n\n67\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.590\nI'll show you why later.\n\n68\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.850\nYes, we do have settings in this.\n\n69\n00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.010\nNotice all kinds of new things that\nwe're gonna be playing around with.\n\n70\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.550\nOne of my favorites, we have this\nthing called Playback Resolution.\n\n71\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.200\nI could because this is\na fairly well-powered laptop.\n\n72\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.110\nI could say play back at full resolution.\n\n73\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.350\nSo as it's playing back with video,\nit plays back at the full resolution.\n\n74\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.210\nIf I've got some ram issues or\nsomething like that,\n\n75\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.460\nI can just choose here, and say, actually\nyou know what, play it back at a quarter.\n\n76\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.450\nNow, the interesting part is,\nyou're saying to yourself hey man,\n\n77\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.830\nyou just kicked it to a quarter and\n\n78\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.540\nit still looks okay play,\nit's like now it looks kind of pooey.\n\n79\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.810\nNow it looks okay.\n\n80\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.680\nWhy is that the case?\n\n81\n00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.270\nBecause if I go back to the wrench,\non the Settings, okay if I go back there,\n\n82\n00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.480\nnot only do I have a playback resolution,\nI have a paused resolution.\n\n83\n00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.640\nSo when it pauses,\nit pauses at full in this case.\n\n84\n00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.350\nI could say, okay,\nI find that mildly disturbing and\n\n85\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.980\nI will pause it at this same resolution.\n\n86\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.320\nBut, I prefer to be like,\nokay, when it's paused,\n\n87\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.350\nit pauses at full because I may\nneed to do something to this.\n\n88\n00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.020\nOr, because I have that same\nability on the source side, and\n\n89\n00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.490\nwe're gonna try this in another lesson,\nI can actually pull export frames.\n\n90\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.960\nOkay, I can pull export frames and\n\n91\n00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.640\nI kinda want that full\nresolution on it when I do it.\n\n92\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.470\nWhat can be done up here if\nI come down to the timeline?\n\n93\n00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.230\nI'm gonna make this Full.\n\n94\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.750\nThere are a lot of settings in\nhere that we will work with.\n\n95\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.780\nNow of course we have a panel menu,\nand this panel menu,\n\n96\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.630\nyup I can close, I can undoc.\n\n97\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.250\nI have a thing called the work area bar.\n\n98\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.390\nI zoom back, if I turn it on, if you\nuse After Effects you are used to this.\n\n99\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.090\nOkay, After Effects uses a work area bar\nto define the area where you're gonna be\n\n100\n00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.020\nworking and\nthe area where you wanna render files.\n\n101\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.910\nMost of us who are editors are like,\nwhat's that, what does that do?\n\n102\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.390\nSo we will turn that off,\nyou can leave it on if you like.\n\n103\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.420\nAudio Waveforms Use Label Color,\nright now,\n\n104\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.250\nthe audio waveforms are green\nbecause that was the label color.\n\n105\n00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.900\nIf I turn them off.\n\n106\n00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.430\nThey're going to be same as the blue.\n\n107\n00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.240\nAnd I don't necessarily like that,\nso I'm going to use the label color.\n\n108\n00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.490\nRectified audio wave forms\nversus non rectified.\n\n109\n00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.500\nMost folks might be used to this.\n\n110\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.790\nWhere's it's on both\nsides of the zero line.\n\n111\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.040\nSome people really prefer a rectified one,\nso we can do that.\n\n112\n00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.020\nThere are many different things\nyou can do in here, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.610\nI'm gonna go ahead and do rectified.\n\n114\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.368\nAnother thing that people like is I\nwant to show video heads and tails.\n\n115\n00:07:00.368 --> 00:07:05.190\nNow you might be saying to yourself,\nI don't see these at all,\n\n116\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.550\nand that is because these\nare kind of smooshed.\n\n117\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.990\nSo here are some new hotkeys, okay.\n\n118\n00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.649\nPlus and minus.\n\n119\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.730\nYou can zoom in toward the play head is,\nokay?\n\n120\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.950\nIf I add a modifier to that.\n\n121\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.080\nIf I add command, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.310\nWhat I'm doing is all the video\ntracks are now sizing up,\n\n123\n00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.950\nand I can now see, on here,\nwhat I had just set.\n\n124\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.120\nWhich is, I want, video head,\nvideo head thumbnails.\n\n125\n00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.327\nSo that way I can have it that way,\nor continuous.\n\n126\n00:07:45.327 --> 00:07:50.357\nContinuous kind of freaks me out,\nso I generally just do heads.\n\n127\n00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:55.232\nI can do, all right,\nthe last thing that I like\n\n128\n00:07:55.232 --> 00:08:00.530\nin here too, reveal sequence in project.\n\n129\n00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.780\nAs in I may have a lot of sequences.\n\n130\n00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.610\nAnd I don't remember where it is.\n\n131\n00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.609\nAnd I can just say,\nyou know what please reveal it.\n\n132\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.490\nIn the project boom and it is done that.\n\n133\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.400\nLet me just zoom in real quick.\n\n134\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.580\nIt's actually highlighted.\n\n135\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.940\nIf it was buried in a bin some\nthere it would bring it out.\n\n136\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.310\nOkay, so once again in here I\nadded that command modifier.\n\n137\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:32.130\nIf I had the option modifier plus minus,\nit will do the audio.\n\n138\n00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.940\nWe do the command modifier again.\n\n139\n00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.900\nIf I do shift plus boom,\njust takes it big.\n\n140\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.650\nAnd it makes it small again.\n\n141\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.930\nSo it jumps in and jumps out.\n\n142\n00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.100\nIf you wanna do them individually,\nyou can just grab the bar,\n\n143\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.410\njust It's kinda like other\napplications that do spread sheets.\n\n144\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.990\nThey'll do that and\nyou can do that exact same thing.\n\n145\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.340\n>> A lot of cool options with\ngetting it just right cuz\n\n146\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.000\nI'm assuming that's actually a big deal.\n\n147\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.810\nIt's not something simple that,\nI can make it bigger or\n\n148\n00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.620\nsmaller, when you're doing\na lot of editing it's probably.\n\n149\n00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.530\nAbsolutely.\n>> A really nice feature to have debating\n\n150\n00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.180\njust right.\n\n151\n00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.410\n>> Like they said, the last thing\nyou wanna do is go burying your head\n\n152\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.530\ninto the monitor when you can zoom in and\n\n153\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.400\nzoom out like this and\nsee it much, much better.\n\n154\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.740\nEspecially if you're\nworking with waveforms or\n\n155\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.290\nif you're working with key frames.\n\n156\n00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.110\nWhich, when we deal with\neffects getting in there and\n\n157\n00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.050\nworking with key frames is critical.\n\n158\n00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.500\nOkay, so coming back, if I go to the\nwrench, it says timeline display settings.\n\n159\n00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.830\nI can choose even though I said earlier,\n\n160\n00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.090\nhey I like video, I can choose to\nsimply not see them whatsoever.\n\n161\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.860\nI can not show the audio waveform.\n\n162\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.490\nClip markers I don't know why, but\n\n163\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.870\nsometimes when you put a marker on a clip\nlike I did before and I synced the audio.\n\n164\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.890\nSome people don't wanna see those markers\nin the timeline, not exactly sure why.\n\n165\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.190\nI'm going to activate duplicate\nframe markers for now, so\n\n166\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.580\nyou can see something a little bit later.\n\n167\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.150\nBut these are a lot of visual choices.\n\n168\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.660\nOkay, this annoys me,\nI don't wanna see this right now.\n\n169\n00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.020\nOr it's critical that I\nsee this at this moment.\n\n170\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.029\nYou can set those in that way, and that's\nusually with the timeline display setting.\n\n171\n00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.920\nOver here, blue,\nonce again playhead position.\n\n172\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.490\nI can move or go to a specific\nplayhead position with that.\n\n173\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:23.930\nWe have two here that are very,\nvery, I would say people love these.\n\n174\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:30.810\nOkay link so if this is on,\nif this is blue every time I tap the video\n\n175\n00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.750\nit will highlight the selected\naudio okay a lot of people like\n\n176\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.610\nthis it's like whenever I hit the video I\nwant to be able to select that audio too.\n\n177\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.620\nIf you turn it off, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.920\nTurn it off.\n\n179\n00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.440\nThen when I click the video, it just\nclicks video or it just highlights audio.\n\n180\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.120\nThat's all it does.\n\n181\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.850\nSo some people like that on.\n\n182\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.720\nThere's a way to subvert this\nthat we'll talk about later.\n\n183\n00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.110\nThe next one is snapping.\n\n184\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.330\nIs that I also want my play\nhead to snap to like edits.\n\n185\n00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.930\nIt's not doing it.\n\n186\n00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.540\nSome people find this\na little bit frustrating\n\n187\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.490\nbecause if I use up down arrows\nit's snapping right to it.\n\n188\n00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:16.690\nAnd they'll say okay, snapping is\nactivated, why isn't this working?\n\n189\n00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.920\nI'm not exactly sure why this\nis a setting but if I come\n\n190\n00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.310\nback up to general preferences,\nin general preferences.\n\n191\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.270\nThere's a thing that says, and\n\n192\n00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.950\nI addressed this in the first video, snap\nplayhead in timeline when snap is enabled.\n\n193\n00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.360\nIt is off.\n\n194\n00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.589\nWhen I now turn it on.\n\n195\n00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:45.811\nNow it snaps.\n\n196\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.760\nOkay, now we'll do the snap.\n\n197\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.730\nAnd you're like,\nwhy does that exist in general settings?\n\n198\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.920\n>> I'm not sure.\n\n199\n00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.680\nI'm sure a long time ago,\nit made sense and\n\n200\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.490\nthey decided you know, we'll keep it in\nbecause so many people know this and so\n\n201\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.990\nmany people use this,\nwe're just going to keep it in.\n\n202\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.990\nSo if you've activated snapping and\nit's not working,\n\n203\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.310\ngo to your general settings and\nmake sure that is set.\n\n204\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.190\nThat's your issue.\n\n205\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.660\n>> That's gotta be super frustrating for\nnew people.\n\n206\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.600\n>> New people are like it's on,\nwhat's happening?\n\n207\n00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.820\nI know it did for me for a while.\n\n208\n00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.920\nI was like, this makes no sense.\n\n209\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.600\nBut I'm sure it has to do with something\nthat's been around for quite awhile and\n\n210\n00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.320\nyou know it adds more customization and\nanytime you can add more customization.\n\n211\n00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.850\nSo you can get in and do the story the way\nyou want it in my opinion even better.\n\n212\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.830\nIt's just one thing you gotta\nclick what's the big deal?\n\n213\n00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.530\n>> Well it's a check mark\n>> this wants a check mark,\n\n214\n00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.810\nand then you check it,\nand it's there, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.901\n>> Obviously that never worked\nin customer support, so.\n\n216\n00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:52.130\n>> [LAUGH] It never worked\nin customer support.\n\n217\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.000\nAbsolutely, so one of the sayings\nI wanted to show you was,\n\n218\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.530\nI went to that and I said,\nI'm going to take off video thumbnails for\n\n219\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.830\nawhile because when I don't really\nneed it, it's a little bit disturbing.\n\n220\n00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.570\nLet's take this back down to being small,\n\n221\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:10.440\nthat I just did the shift minus on that\ncase and just bumped it right back down.\n\n222\n00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.800\nIt said, okay, oop wrong one, I'm going\nto go to the timeline display settings,\n\n223\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.810\nand it said show duplicate frame markers.\n\n224\n00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.990\nWhat that means is this,\nI've already used this shot once,\n\n225\n00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.210\nKenny I've already absolutely\nused this shot once.\n\n226\n00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:32.120\nIf i want to I'm gonna say I'm\ngonna put that again at the end.\n\n227\n00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.200\nAnd then just do a simple insert.\n\n228\n00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.529\nBoom and I get this line.\n\n229\n00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:43.120\nThe line on the bottom is telling me,\nyou have used this again.\n\n230\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.270\nThe little purple line and\n\n231\n00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.130\nthe pink line here at the bottom,\nare telling me you know what?\n\n232\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.920\nYou've used that, and\nyou've used the entire thing.\n\n233\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.170\nSo every time I use this,\nby having that setting on,\n\n234\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.400\nit's like you've reused this footage.\n\n235\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.680\n>> What's the purpose of\nletting us know that?\n\n236\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.400\nOkay one, I may use repeated shots.\n\n237\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.490\nOkay, crowd reactions, or\nin some cases I worked commercials, and\n\n238\n00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.090\nI will make sure the product shot.\n\n239\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.890\nAnd somebody will say how many\ntimes do we use the product?\n\n240\n00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.970\nSeven, it's like where?\n\n241\n00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.930\nThere, there, there and\nthere, and they're like okay.\n\n242\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.440\nOr I do have a repeated\nshot that I really like.\n\n243\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.670\nIt's like, how many times have I used\nthis, and if I used it too close together,\n\n244\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.520\nare people gonna notice\nthat it's gonna maybe loop?\n\n245\n00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.050\nSo that's one of the reasons\nwhy I might do that.\n\n246\n00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:28.730\n>> That makes sense.\n\n247\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.480\n>> Okay?\n>> Yeah.\n\n248\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.340\n>> Which is kind fun.\n\n249\n00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.520\nHere's the interesting thing\nthat I wanted to show you.\n\n250\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.890\nI mentioned it a little bit earlier.\n\n251\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.510\nI'm gonna come back here\nI'm gonna zoom it down.\n\n252\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.720\nOkay, I'm just using those hot keys again.\n\n253\n00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.120\nIn this case, option minus, command minus.\n\n254\n00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.660\nIf I go back to the project window, and\n\n255\n00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.788\nI said,\nI really like this thing up here, okay?\n\n256\n00:14:53.788 --> 00:14:56.690\nThis thing called the preview area.\n\n257\n00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.994\nI'm going to go find,\nzoom back out quickly.\n\n258\n00:15:04.095 --> 00:15:05.300\nThis one.\n\n259\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.290\nOkay, this is the one\nthat I have been using.\n\n260\n00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:12.160\nIn the sequence, this merged one, I go\nby up to the top and say, look at this!\n\n261\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.520\nThere's a new thing that's been added.\n\n262\n00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.740\nIt says, hey,\nyou have used that video four times.\n\n263\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.620\nIt says I used the audio eight\ntimes cuz theres two tracks.\n\n264\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:29.280\nBut, if I click on it,\nit shows me where it's been used.\n\n265\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.121\nAnd then I can say, I would like to\ngo to the third instance of that.\n\n266\n00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:38.736\nBoom, and it takes the play head right to\nthe third time that I have used it, so\n\n267\n00:15:38.736 --> 00:15:43.637\nthis is one of the reasons why I actually\nlike it, it's like have I used that shot?\n\n268\n00:15:43.637 --> 00:15:44.299\nYes.\n\n269\n00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:45.116\nWe've used it here.\n\n270\n00:15:45.116 --> 00:15:46.717\nOkay, go to the first one please.\n\n271\n00:15:46.717 --> 00:15:47.785\nBoom.\n\n272\n00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:52.289\nThe thing is if I've used this in multiple\nsequences, it will note the multiple\n\n273\n00:15:52.289 --> 00:15:57.010\nsequences, and even if the sequence is\nclosed, it will open that sequence for me.\n\n274\n00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.310\nAnd say, okay, yeah,\nyou've used it, boom, there it is.\n\n275\n00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.790\nIt's, you have used it, congratulations.\n\n276\n00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.080\nIt's neat.\n\n277\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.400\n>> By the power of Greyskull.\n\n278\n00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.280\n>> By the power of Greyskull, I have found\nall of this media and where I've used it.\n\n279\n00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.850\nIn the sequence, instead of going like,\nwhat did we use it here?\n\n280\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.500\nWhere was it?\n\n281\n00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.220\nI think it was maybe it was this one.\n\n282\n00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.060\nI don't know.\n\n283\n00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.140\nAnd just scrolling through.\n\n284\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.200\nWhat I can do is say okay,\nI've used it here, here, and\n\n285\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.960\nhere, let's go to the third instance.\n\n286\n00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.020\nBoom, I'm right there.\n\n287\n00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.820\nAnd the thing is, the more you can sort of\nwork, the reason why knowing these little\n\n288\n00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:37.850\nthings about Adobe helps you go through\nyour, I don't wanna say through your story\n\n289\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.360\nfaster, what i like to say is, I'm doing\nthe story as fast as I want to do it.\n\n290\n00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.440\nInstead of going, okay now I have\nto stop and fine this and get this.\n\n291\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.895\nNo, they've put in so\nmany nice options for\n\n292\n00:16:48.895 --> 00:16:53.805\nyou to go to all of these different\nthings, which is really, really nice.\n\n293\n00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:58.995\nOne thing I wanna sort of finish up with\nis before we do any trimming or advanced\n\n294\n00:16:58.995 --> 00:17:02.045\nstuff like we're gonna do in the next\nlesson, let me just zoom in real quick.\n\n295\n00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:07.285\nThese guys right here now,\nthat I'm done editing,\n\n296\n00:17:08.325 --> 00:17:13.810\nI don't care about the left\nside source of these anymore.\n\n297\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.780\nThe only ones I care about\nare the ones on the right.\n\n298\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:22.170\nBecause this is going to allow\nme to do certain things.\n\n299\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:22.950\nOkay?\n\n300\n00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.110\nAs in, this play ahead right here.\n\n301\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.576\nFirst of all the thing you wanna\no realize about the play ahead,\n\n302\n00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:33.220\nlet me just zoom in real quick,\nI lost it, I lost it.\n\n303\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.150\nI knew I was going to do that.\n\n304\n00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:42.650\nIf I zoom in, notice it is a line,\na play ahead is not just a straight line.\n\n305\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.780\nit's an actual frame.\n\n306\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.370\nIt is an actual frame and\n\n307\n00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.020\ndistance because that's if you go write\nthe film there it's precise reservation.\n\n308\n00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.610\nIt's 24 little pictures or\n30 little pictures running down the row.\n\n309\n00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.080\nSo the play ahead has to\nbe one frame of distance.\n\n310\n00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.640\nThat is why if I actually set an in and\n\n311\n00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.850\nan out point, okay, if I hit i,\nnotice it goes to the front.\n\n312\n00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.579\nIf I hit an o, it goes to the back.\n\n313\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:16.620\nThe one thing to realize about this,\ntime is always read from the front,\n\n314\n00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.940\nand I have actually put a selection\nthat is a frame long down here, and\n\n315\n00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.420\none thing I can do Is I can\nsay I want to get rid of that.\n\n316\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:33.100\nI can just say delete and get rid of\nit and I just got rid of a frame.\n\n317\n00:18:37.602 --> 00:18:42.008\nIf I do Option+Delete,\nnotice when I did delete\n\n318\n00:18:42.008 --> 00:18:46.440\nbefore it leaves a gap or\nit's called a lift.\n\n319\n00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.545\nIt lifts that out and then if I wanted\nto add in a new frame I could do that.\n\n320\n00:18:51.545 --> 00:18:54.970\nCmd+Z, I think we all understand that\nCmd+Z or Ctrl+Z, depending on your system,\n\n321\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:55.850\nthat means undo.\n\n322\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.300\nIt's like please undo.\n\n323\n00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.550\nIf I hold Option,\nOption is one of the magic buttons.\n\n324\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.990\nThe more we get into this,\nOption is your friend.\n\n325\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.630\nIf I hold Option and\nthen Delete, that's an extract.\n\n326\n00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.200\nThat actually takes the frame and\ncloses the gap right to left.\n\n327\n00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.690\nNot left to right.\n\n328\n00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:19.430\nThe reason it knows to do this is because\nthe play head is also shaped like\n\n329\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:26.290\nan arrow, and it looks downward, and\nthe only thing it sees is what is blue.\n\n330\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:34.610\nVideo one is activated, A1 is activated,\nA2, A3, A4, so that's why it sees those.\n\n331\n00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.545\nIf it doesn't, see,\nit says I don't see that now.\n\n332\n00:19:38.545 --> 00:19:43.770\nThat's why the other cool thing I\nlike to show people at this point,\n\n333\n00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.330\nI'm gonna take that input and\noutput out of there.\n\n334\n00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.510\nI will show you how to do that really cool\nthing in the advanced editing tutorial.\n\n335\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.500\nSo we'll get into that.\n\n336\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.800\nBut a lot of people like to make cuts,\nlike to use the razor tool.\n\n337\n00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.530\nWhich is really cool.\n\n338\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.940\nThey picked that up and\nthey put it right on the line.\n\n339\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.650\nI'm just gonna do that.\n\n340\n00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:06.850\nAs in, I can make a cut across all\nthose tracks by using our friend K.\n\n341\n00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.980\nRemember my hand might all ready be on J,\nK, and L?\n\n342\n00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.789\nOkay, if I say command K,\nthat is command cut.\n\n343\n00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.467\nAnd it has just made a cut right there.\n\n344\n00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:19.490\nOkay and then I can get rid of that.\n\n345\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:24.130\nNow, if I take out A1,\n\n346\n00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.313\nA2, A3, and A4.\n\n347\n00:20:31.074 --> 00:20:34.473\nIf I do that and I hit Cmd + K again,\n\n348\n00:20:34.473 --> 00:20:40.645\nit only cuts the video,\nbecause that's all it sees.\n\n349\n00:20:40.645 --> 00:20:43.600\nSo this is why when we are editing\n\n350\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.030\nit's very important to realize\nthat left side relationship\n\n351\n00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:53.308\nis what controls getting something\nfrom the source into the timeline.\n\n352\n00:20:53.308 --> 00:20:58.500\nWhen we are working in the timeline,\nit is very much the things on the right\n\n353\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.200\nthat help us control when\nwe're doing certain functions.\n\n354\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.710\nIn there.\nIt's like,\n\n355\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.800\nit's the blue thing looking down.\n\n356\n00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.100\nWhen it sees blue, it's doing it there.\n\n357\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.820\nIf it doesn't see blue, it's like,\ndon't see blue, not doing it.\n\n358\n00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.208\nOkay, so, that is one thing to practice.\n\n359\n00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:18.650\nAnd with command+K, the thing that cuts,\n\n360\n00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.960\nthat is a really cool thing to practice\nwith so you get this idea of okay, so if I\n\n361\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.730\ndon't have this done it'll do this, so\nthen when I start to do other situations.\n\n362\n00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.010\nOkay, now that makes sense.\n\n363\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.430\nThat's one of those\nthings to practice with.\n\n364\n00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.850\nThe other thing that's kind of cool,\nis if you want, and\n\n365\n00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:40.910\nI'm gonna stay with K real quick,\nI really like K, it's my friend.\n\n366\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:41.418\n>> Your go to.\n\n367\n00:21:41.418 --> 00:21:45.870\n>> So sometimes, especially when you're in\na professional situation, you may say to\n\n368\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.770\nme, Dan you may say, Jim I only wanna\nsee between this point and this point.\n\n369\n00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.170\nIt's like I just wanna see that.\n\n370\n00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.740\nI want to keep playing that,\nI wouldn't go any place else.\n\n371\n00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.080\nI'll say okay,\nI'll drop an in point there using i and\n\n372\n00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.110\nI'll drop an out point there using o.\n\n373\n00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.639\nAnd I'll say I just wanna see that point,\nkeep looking at,\n\n374\n00:22:04.639 --> 00:22:06.557\nlooking at and make a decision.\n\n375\n00:22:06.557 --> 00:22:11.114\nMost people they hit play and then they\nmove this back, and they try, and find,\n\n376\n00:22:11.114 --> 00:22:14.060\nthey go, sorry, sorry,\nsorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n377\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.681\n>> Jim Bill and I'm currently training\nyou right now on Adobe Premier.\n\n378\n00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:21.790\n>> That was shift and then K.\n\n379\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:27.460\nAnd what that means is when I do that,\nit's gonna take the play head back and\n\n380\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.090\nwe'll learn how to set these\nvalues in the settings later.\n\n381\n00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.779\nIt's gonna take it back about three\nseconds, go past where that play head was\n\n382\n00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:37.472\nabout two seconds, and\nthen come right straight back.\n\n383\n00:22:37.472 --> 00:22:38.260\nThat is shift-K.\n\n384\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.439\n>> Currently training you\nright now on Adobe Premier.\n\n385\n00:22:40.439 --> 00:22:44.340\n>> So usually if I make an edit that's\nthe first thing I do, is I do a review.\n\n386\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.629\nIf I do Option+K.\n\n387\n00:22:46.629 --> 00:22:47.969\n>> Premier.\n\n388\n00:22:47.969 --> 00:22:52.920\nAnd the reason why I'm shooting today is-\n>> Boom, it only plays between the in and\n\n389\n00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.010\nthe out point and\nI can just keep doing that.\n\n390\n00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.820\n>> And the reason why I'm shooting today-\n>> And if you worked with a director or\n\n391\n00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.180\nproducer was like,\nhow do you feel about that?\n\n392\n00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.300\nMm-\n>> Play it again.\n\n393\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.110\n>> Wanna see it again?\n\n394\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.610\nOkay.\n\n395\n00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.220\n>> And the reason why I\n>> Halfway through.\n\n396\n00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:05.880\nCan you play it again?\n\n397\n00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.440\nYeah, even though it's halfway through\nI can just hit it again so this is why\n\n398\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.450\nI feel that K is one of the most\npowerful keys that you can get to know.\n\n399\n00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.540\nNot only is the pause key with J,\nK and L but if you add option,\n\n400\n00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.820\nit will play between the in and\nthe out point.\n\n401\n00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.570\nIf you add shift it'll\nplay around the edit.\n\n402\n00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.750\n>> So it would behoove you\nto become very familiar and\n\n403\n00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.080\ncomfortable with using the k the and\nthe option k.\n\n404\n00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.530\n>> Right.\nWith k, the option k, the shift k, and\n\n405\n00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.470\nrealizing that this playhead,\nas it looks down,\n\n406\n00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.310\nis responding to what is highlighted.\n\n407\n00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.640\nI kind of call it timeline gymnastics, and\n\n408\n00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.800\njust kind of go through it,\nget comfortable with it.\n\n409\n00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.690\nAnd then when we go into the next set of\nedits, when we start to do overwrites and\n\n410\n00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.610\nreplacements, and we start to pick\nthings up and move them around,\n\n411\n00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:52.589\nand then we do this really cool\nthing called edit to sequence.\n\n412\n00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.230\nThat's really, really fun,\n\n413\n00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:00.860\nwhen you understand how this right side\nworks, and how that plate head works.\n\n414\n00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.850\nSo I hope that was helpful.\n\n415\n00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.900\nI wasn't running too fast.\n\n416\n00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.320\n>> No, Jim, it was awesome actually.\n\n417\n00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.860\nIt was very entertaining.\n\n418\n00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.780\n>> Great, good, all right, all right.\n\n419\n00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.451\nI can go fast. [CROSSTALK] >> Yeah,\nlet me show you how quick [CROSSTALK].\n\n420\n00:24:09.451 --> 00:24:11.427\n>> We have this video done tonight,\nalmost like right now.\n\n421\n00:24:11.427 --> 00:24:13.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, that's fine, okay.\n\n422\n00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.600\n>> No that's good, you had a perfect pace.\n\n423\n00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.240\nI think that it was your\nexplanations are very well done, so\n\n424\n00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.950\nwe're not struggling and going,\nhold on, what are you doing here?\n\n425\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.380\n>> Okay, good.\n>> You're doing a great job,\n\n426\n00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.440\nwe appreciate how much effort you put\ninto this so that we can understand.\n\n427\n00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:26.960\n>> It's all the host.\n\n428\n00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.580\nIt's all the host.\n\n429\n00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.230\n>> Yes.\n\n430\n00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.140\n>> It's all the host.\n\n431\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.396\nWithout him, I don't.\n\n432\n00:24:30.396 --> 00:24:33.607\n>> Stop, stop.\n\n433\n00:24:33.607 --> 00:24:34.664\n>> Okay.\n>> All right Jim,\n\n434\n00:24:34.664 --> 00:24:36.890\nis there anything else we need\nto know about the timeline.\n\n435\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:37.480\n>> Not right now.\n\n436\n00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.020\nIt's a good thing to go\nthrough this lesson,\n\n437\n00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.610\npractice some of these\nthings I talked about.\n\n438\n00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.890\nAnd then when we get into the advanced\nyou'll feel much more comfortable because\n\n439\n00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.550\nit's like, okay, now I'm good with that.\n\n440\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.640\nI'm good with all these things.\n\n441\n00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.310\nI figured out that snap thing.\n\n442\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.280\nNow when we go into the overwrites,\nreplacements,\n\n443\n00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.870\nthings like that you're like, boom.\n\n444\n00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:53.480\nI'm ready.\n\n445\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.650\nI'm ready, I know why this did that.\n\n446\n00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.198\nInstead of going why did it do that,\nI know why it did that.\n\n447\n00:24:58.198 --> 00:24:58.698\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n448\n00:24:58.698 --> 00:25:00.127\n>> That's interesting effect\n\n449\n00:25:00.127 --> 00:25:01.245\n[CROSSTALK].\nI guess we're moving\n\n450\n00:25:01.245 --> 00:25:01.798\non.\n[LAUGH]\n\n451\n00:25:01.798 --> 00:25:02.448\n>> Okay yeah it's\n\n452\n00:25:02.448 --> 00:25:02.990\nlike\n>> That's\n\n453\n00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.150\nright-\n>> Keep up.\n\n454\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.650\n>> We can master these things, and that's\nwhat we're trying to do for you guys.\n\n455\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.150\nHopefully you'll be able to master\nthem after watching this video,\n\n456\n00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.600\nmaybe even just a couple of times.\n\n457\n00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.810\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you'll be squared away\n\n458\n00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:13.650\nand ready to go.\n\n459\n00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.590\nJim, we thank you for joining us today.\n\n460\n00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.610\n>> Again, great.\n\n461\n00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:17.610\nI can't wait to get to the next one.\n\n462\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.776\n>> That's right, it's always like\nan anticipation for the next episode.\n\n463\n00:25:20.776 --> 00:25:23.446\nBut, for this one,\nwe're gonna go ahead and close it down.\n\n464\n00:25:23.446 --> 00:25:24.503\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n465\n00:25:24.503 --> 00:25:27.780\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n466\n00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.512\n>> I'm James Bittle.\n\n467\n00:25:28.512 --> 00:25:29.961\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n468\n00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:39.070\n[Music]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.250\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.320\nAnd today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.310\nwe're kicking off with some\nmore of our Premier Pro series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.100\nJoining us back in the studio to\nlend his expertise on that topic,\n\n8\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.650\nour good friend, Mr. James Biddle.\n\n9\n00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.510\nJames, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.635\nWe're so glad to have you today.\n\n11\n00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:28.720\n>> Hey, it's good to be back, Dan.\n\n12\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.130\nGood to back and\nshowing you guys some stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.280\nNow, when we did the last episode,\nwe talked, we did a lot of insert editing.\n\n14\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.560\nAnd I know a lot of people that when they\nget into this, I love insert editing.\n\n15\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.240\nI'm just, I'm just gonna stick\nwith insert editing, I love it.\n\n16\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.080\nThen there's this comment that\na lot of people make about\n\n17\n00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.780\nwhen you get into an editing system,\nit's just a hammer.\n\n18\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.350\nOkay, it's just a hammer.\n\n19\n00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.680\nWell, to me, when people just wanna use\ninsert editing, it's kind of like saying\n\n20\n00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.420\nI'm gonna go ahead and build this\nbird house with a sledge hammer.\n\n21\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.570\nThere's the right hammer for the job.\n\n22\n00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.520\nSo, today I'm gonna show two\ndifferent types of edits.\n\n23\n00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.910\nBoth of them are kind of overwrites.\n\n24\n00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.240\nOne's gonna be an overwrite edit, and the\nother one's going to be a replace edit.\n\n25\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.240\nAs soon as you see both,\n\n26\n00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.040\nyou're gonna be, I guarantee you're\ngonna love at least one of them, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.170\nSo, let's go back to what\nI was doing yesterday.\n\n28\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.780\nI went ahead and\nput this timeline together.\n\n29\n00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.100\nI'm gonna do a little what we\nwould call a little clean up\n\n30\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.770\nin my project window real quick, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.210\nWhat I did was I created\na couple new things,\n\n32\n00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.400\nand I personally like\nto keep them organized.\n\n33\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.490\nI created this merged clip\nthat I put the audio on.\n\n34\n00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.170\nAnd I created this sequence.\n\n35\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.910\nSo, what I'm gonna do is, and we know\nthat, I'm just gonna move this here so\n\n36\n00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.790\nyou can see it real quick.\n\n37\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.990\nI'm just gonna shimmy up the window here,\nand yeah, look at that.\n\n38\n00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.140\nI can resize this whole thing and\n\n39\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.540\nmake it kind of small, just to work\nwith it with some screen real estate.\n\n40\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.460\nBring it in there.\n\n41\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.010\nI remember I had this\nthing called new bin.\n\n42\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.910\nSo, what I'll say is,\ninstead of just creating,\n\n43\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.450\nI'll say, okay, I'm gonna drag\nthis over to new bin real quick.\n\n44\n00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.370\nLet her go.\nAnd\n\n45\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.990\nI'm gonna say that bin\nis gonna be sequences,\n\n46\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.640\ncuz I'm actually gonna create some more.\n\n47\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.212\nI can work with multiple sequences.\n\n48\n00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:13.390\nAnd then I'm gonna take this one,\nI'm gonna say that this is Merged.\n\n49\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.040\nOkay, merged media, or\nmerged clips in this case.\n\n50\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.520\nI'm gonna use the clips language,\nand keep that as clips.\n\n51\n00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.580\nSo, what is an overwrite?\n\n52\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.530\nBasically, what I had been doing, was I\nwas just putting stuff end to end, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.580\nI was just saying I'm gonna\njust put it end to end,\n\n54\n00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.030\nand everything's gonna be fine.\n\n55\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.940\nWell, what if I don't wanna go end to end?\n\n56\n00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.420\nLet's face it, I like to keep things\nexciting, but in this I'm kind of boring.\n\n57\n00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.735\nOkay?\nI'm just talking about kinda boring.\n\n58\n00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:45.375\nLet's play real quick.\n\n59\n00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:46.455\n>> Hi, I'm Jim Bill.\n\n60\n00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:49.035\nI'm currently training you right now-\n>> This guy is exciting.\n\n61\n00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:50.935\n>> And the-\n>> I'm riveted.\n\n62\n00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:52.085\n>> I know, I can't turn away.\n\n63\n00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:53.973\n>> Today is one and it's a beautiful day.\n\n64\n00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.161\nI haven't seen my backyard\nabout a month [INAUDIBLE].\n\n65\n00:02:56.161 --> 00:03:00.193\nNow, I'm talking about my garden, and\n\n66\n00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:05.300\nyou might wanna say,\nwhy can't I see your garden?\n\n67\n00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.090\nYou shot all that stuff\nthat's in your garden,\n\n68\n00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.045\nwhy do I have to look at you talking?\n\n69\n00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:13.180\nAnd it's like, yeah, sometimes we call\nthis a cut away, we call it B roll,\n\n70\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.860\nwe call it extra.\n\n71\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.580\nThere's all kinds of terms for it.\n\n72\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.780\nIt's like, yeah,\nwhat if I'm talking about it?\n\n73\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.350\nWhy don't I show it to you?\n\n74\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.170\nSo, let's do that.\n\n75\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.530\nI'm gonna go quickly back to\nthe project window and say, okay,\n\n76\n00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.010\nI've got some garden clips here.\n\n77\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.450\nI also have let's see, garden focus.\n\n78\n00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.230\nYeah, I've got these really\ncool things where I did some\n\n79\n00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.220\nshallow depth of field stuff and all that.\n\n80\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.150\nI think I'm gonna use these.\n\n81\n00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.152\nSo, just like I showed you another lesson,\nI'm gonna highlight them.\n\n82\n00:03:41.152 --> 00:03:44.470\nI'll control-click it and say., you know\nwhat, I'm just gonna open all of those\n\n83\n00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.160\nin the source monitor and\nlook for something that I like.\n\n84\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.440\nAnd I remap that key to just two,\nso I'm going boom, boom.\n\n85\n00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.370\nThat's pretty good.\n\n86\n00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.330\nLook at that, that one's nice,\nit's a little plant.\n\n87\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.520\nAnd I did all kinds of stuff, and\nit's like, okay, the camera's wobbly,\n\n88\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.180\ncamera's wobbly, camera's wobbly.\n\n89\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.780\nLook at that!\n\n90\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.330\nNow I do, okay.\n\n91\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.860\nCool, first it's blurry, then it's sharp.\n\n92\n00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.930\nMaybe I do it again.\n\n93\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.710\nLet me do L so\nI can go through this faster.\n\n94\n00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.670\nLet me go back to J.\n\n95\n00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.740\nAnd I'm just keep hitting the J\nkey until I find that point.\n\n96\n00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.980\nWell, okay, so I'll say, you know what,\nI'm gonna start it right about there.\n\n97\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.820\nThrow in an endpoint.\n\n98\n00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.240\nThat's all I'm gonna do is an inpoint.\n\n99\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.960\nI'm gonna make something\ncalled a three point edit.\n\n100\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.970\nBecause what's gonna be more important to\nme is the distance down in the timeline\n\n101\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.910\nthat I wanna cover with this shot, okay?\n\n102\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.940\nI can't really gauge how much time I'm\ngonna use up in this source monitor.\n\n103\n00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.060\nWhat I wanna do is gauge\nit down in the timeline.\n\n104\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.760\nSo, I'm gonna zoom into\nthe timeline real quick and say,\n\n105\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.641\nokay, I want this to go from here,\nand I'll drop an inpoint, okay?\n\n106\n00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:52.310\nHighlight the window,\ndrop an inpoint, play forward.\n\n107\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.390\n>> And we're looking to change it.\n\n108\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.400\nWe are looking to-\n>> Boom, and\n\n109\n00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.130\nI'll say right at that point, out point,\n\n110\n00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.900\nthat's at the point where I want that\nfootage to stop and go back to me talking.\n\n111\n00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.080\nJust for now, okay?\n\n112\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.160\nIt's not supposed to be perfect.\n\n113\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.600\nI can always adjust everything later, but\n\n114\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.480\nthis is the point where I want\nit to go back to me talking.\n\n115\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.250\n>> Quick question, James.\n\n116\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.400\n>> Yeah?\n>> If the video sample that you have\n\n117\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.660\nis not as long as the section that you've\nselected, is that gonna cause a problem?\n\n118\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.680\nOr is that-\n>> That, Dan,\n\n119\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.460\nthat is one of the best questions\nyou can ask, because Adobe,\n\n120\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.960\nlike I said numerous times,\nif you do that,\n\n121\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.100\nthere's always a remedy, and\nthey always give you a warning, okay?\n\n122\n00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.720\nThey always give you a warning.\n\n123\n00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.730\nSo, the thing is, up here, and\n\n124\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.710\nlet me go ahead and\ndemonstrate that right after I do this.\n\n125\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.380\nI only have one point in\nthe source monitor right now.\n\n126\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.950\nAnd what I'm basically gonna say is, hey,\n\n127\n00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.650\nI wanna line up this inpoint with\nthe inpoint down in this timeline.\n\n128\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.670\nAnd to fill in the distance to the\noutpoint, it's just gonna go and go and\n\n129\n00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.060\ngo in what's available on the source,\nuntil it stops at that time.\n\n130\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.470\nNow, the next thing that's gonna\nhappen is a bit of a debate, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.390\nBecause once again,\nI'm gonna ignore this right side.\n\n132\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.360\nIn order to edit,\n\n133\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.450\nI don't need to pay attention to\nwhat's active on the right side.\n\n134\n00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.610\nSo, what some folks will do is like this,\nthen I just don't wanna see it.\n\n135\n00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.960\nI don't wanna look at it.\n\n136\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.300\nOkay, highlight that, get rid of it.\n\n137\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.410\nInstead of clicking every single\naudio singly, I'm going to,\n\n138\n00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.000\nI hope that's a word, I'm gonna hold\ndown the shift key and just hit A1.\n\n139\n00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.410\nAnd now, they're all deactivated.\n\n140\n00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:39.270\nSo the shift will off, on all of them.\n\n141\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.310\nNow, the question is do I take this and\ndo I put it into video one?\n\n142\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.360\nDo I do that?\n\n143\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.820\nHere's the overwrite button.\n\n144\n00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.820\nI'll click it, boom.\n\n145\n00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.280\nAnd what has happened,\n\n146\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.440\nI'm gonna use my little friend, okay,\ngonna use my little friend down here.\n\n147\n00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.480\nSee, I was in the wrong one.\n\n148\n00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.050\nSo now, I'm gonna come back here.\n\n149\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.530\nI can use option-K, and\nit's gonna play the whole front.\n\n150\n00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.280\n>> And, the reason why I'm shooting\ntoday is, one, it's a beautiful day.\n\n151\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.970\nI haven't seen my backyard in a about\na month because I've been on vacation.\n\n152\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.810\nAnd we're looking to change it.\n\n153\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.970\nWe're looking to change it.\n\n154\n00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.910\n>> All right, so it added that in there,\n\n155\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.870\nbut some people say, I don't like the fact\nthat it covered you in this track.\n\n156\n00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.530\nI don't like that because then\nI don't know how to move it.\n\n157\n00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.100\nThere are ways to move it, but\nwhen people say, I don't like that.\n\n158\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.810\nWhy can't I put it one track above?\n\n159\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.140\nYou can.\n\n160\n00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.010\nSome people will say, I never do that.\n\n161\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.840\nSome people say, I always do that.\n\n162\n00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.890\nDepending on your situation, you may\nalways do it, you may never do it, okay?\n\n163\n00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.094\nIt's a preference thing.\n\n164\n00:07:54.094 --> 00:07:58.926\nSo, all I have to do is click\non this video one and say, hey,\n\n165\n00:07:58.926 --> 00:08:03.279\ninstead of putting it in video one,\nplease put it into\n\n166\n00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:08.249\nthe video two track And once again,\nI could hit this button.\n\n167\n00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:12.710\nIt's telling me an overwrite is the period\nkey, which is right next to comma,\n\n168\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.730\nso I have my insert and\noverwrite next to it.\n\n169\n00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.400\nOr I could drag it over to here and\nlets see.\n\n170\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.200\nTheres an insert,\ni think that ones over right, boom.\n\n171\n00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:31.340\nAnd now its on the top and\nit will do the exact same thing as before.\n\n172\n00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.360\nIt will do the exact same thing as before.\n\n173\n00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.540\nLet me option/K at this point.\n\n174\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.950\n>> Hi im Jim Little and I'm currently\ntraining you right now, on Adobe Premier.\n\n175\n00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.620\nAnd the reason why I'm shooting\ntoday is one, it's a beautiful day.\n\n176\n00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.340\nI haven't seen my backyard in about\na month because I've been on vacation.\n\n177\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.980\nAnd we're going to change it.\n\n178\n00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.200\n>> Same thing.\n\n179\n00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.350\nNow, the only thing is,\nit's not properly sized.\n\n180\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.880\nI'm gonna worry about that later.\n\n181\n00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.165\n>> I thought it was just\nartistic- [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n182\n00:08:57.165 --> 00:08:59.686\n>> I did not do picture in picture.\n\n183\n00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:02.040\nBut it's like, okay.\n\n184\n00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.290\nI can put it there.\n\n185\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.990\nI can put in that track and\nall I had to do was say hey,\n\n186\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.790\nI'm gonna put this video and\nmap it into there.\n\n187\n00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.120\nThis one doesn't need to be active.\n\n188\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.190\nDoesn't need to be active at all.\n\n189\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.040\nSo long as it's okay on the right side.\n\n190\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.330\nSo that's an overwrite.\n\n191\n00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:25.040\nInstead of making a cut, pushing things\nout, it just puts it over the top.\n\n192\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.380\nHence in overwrite.\n\n193\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.450\nI can do it in the same track\nas my primary video, or\n\n194\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.640\nI can do it a track above.\n\n195\n00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.985\nI can do it a track above,\nthat's absolutely fine.\n\n196\n00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:39.525\nYou might say,\nwell when don't I want to do that?\n\n197\n00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:41.145\nMaybe you're doing a lot of composites.\n\n198\n00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:43.185\nMaybe you're doing a lot of titles.\n\n199\n00:09:43.185 --> 00:09:46.035\nOr maybe you wanna keep everything,\n\n200\n00:09:46.035 --> 00:09:52.700\nas in absolutely everything that's on the\nquote unquote primary story in video one.\n\n201\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.720\nYou can do that.\n\n202\n00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.440\nYou can absolutely do that, or\nyou can stop at, some people call it,\n\n203\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.390\ncheckerboarding.\n\n204\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.930\nSome people call it stair stepping,\nall kinds of things.\n\n205\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.750\nSo, you are absolutely allowed to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.790\nSo, right now I have a cutaway, okay?\n\n207\n00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.930\nAnd I'm cutting away to this flower.\n\n208\n00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:16.180\nI'm going to adjust the fact\n\n209\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.160\nthat it should be the right scale size and\nmaybe it's not timed up right.\n\n210\n00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.660\nI might adjust that later, right now I'm\nputting together what we call a rough cut.\n\n211\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.510\nIt's like okay it's fine,\nI know it's there.\n\n212\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.718\nI like it, it's really cool.\n\n213\n00:10:27.718 --> 00:10:32.630\nIf it's like, I kinda want to see it, but\n\n214\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.280\nI don't wanna see the picture below it,\nthat's what these are for.\n\n215\n00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.450\nOkay you can Toggle the Track Output,\nthat's why another,\n\n216\n00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.740\npeople like doing it in the second one,\nit's like okay I know I put that in there.\n\n217\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.330\nI kind of want to work in video one right\nnow I don't want to see this in video two.\n\n218\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.500\nI can just click on this eyeball and\nnow I don't see it.\n\n219\n00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.480\nSo I wouldn't see anything\nin track two right now.\n\n220\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.150\nThat's another reason\nwhy people would say,\n\n221\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.770\nI actually like to do my overwrites\nin a second one, if that's okay.\n\n222\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.030\nAnd it's like, of course it's okay.\n\n223\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.610\nDo you feel okay with it?\n\n224\n00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.050\nThen it's fine, okay?\n\n225\n00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.720\nThere are no governing law's.\n\n226\n00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.728\n>> It doesn't effect me so\nI'm okay, I feel good about it.\n\n227\n00:11:14.728 --> 00:11:20.230\nAll right, so that's an over rite and\nI can do many of them.\n\n228\n00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.520\nI can do many of them I can\noverride more pictures but\n\n229\n00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.440\nI can create what we call a Mont,\nso what's a replace?\n\n230\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.150\nA replace is a form of overwrite but\nhere's what gonna happen, let me,\n\n231\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.890\nlet's play this.\n\n232\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.660\nThe garden, get rid of the grass,\nmaybe turn the back area into\n\n233\n00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.660\na forgeable area because right now and\nwe're looking, oops, I repeated a shot.\n\n234\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:47.310\nThat's like, darn it, I repeated a shot,\nI need to add more stuff in there.\n\n235\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.440\nMaybe I could just replace it.\n\n236\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.590\nOr I could replace it with something else.\n\n237\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.910\nLet's say, for example, first off,\nthis thing that I just put in,\n\n238\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.140\nthis flower, I don't like that.\n\n239\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.540\nIt's like, okay, that shot's terrible.\n\n240\n00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.870\nBut what I do like is I like the length.\n\n241\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.500\nThe length looks good.\n\n242\n00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.740\nIt's like, that's exactly how\nmuch of me I want covered.\n\n243\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.020\nBecause what I'm covering is when I\nturn away from the camera and point.\n\n244\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.140\nI like it when I'm facing the camera.\n\n245\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.240\nSo that timing works out when I\njust need to change this shot.\n\n246\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.230\nInstead of having to add ins and\nout points again,\n\n247\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.350\ndo all this stuff, blah blah blah.\n\n248\n00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.960\nWhat can I say is, all right,\nlet me pick a new shot.\n\n249\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.600\nHere in the source model.\n\n250\n00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.790\nOkay, let me pick zero.\n\n251\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.300\nPicture that, no that's kind of dumb.\n\n252\n00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.376\nNo that's that one again.\n\n253\n00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:43.840\nMm-hm, mm-hm, number four.\n\n254\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.050\nOkay that's sort of a walk down that path.\n\n255\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.410\nNumber two is the plant again,\nwhat's number one?\n\n256\n00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.740\nThis one looks pretty.\n\n257\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.850\nI'm gonna use this one.\n\n258\n00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.580\nSo what I will do is this.\n\n259\n00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.020\nJust like when I am in the source\nmonitor and I click a source and\n\n260\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.860\nit gives me a list of menu options,\nI can do that to segments in the timeline.\n\n261\n00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.370\nSo I'm gonna come to this segment here,\nclick on it, Ctrl+Click it and\n\n262\n00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.250\nit's going to give me a lot of options.\n\n263\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.270\nAnd what it gives me is this\nthing called Replace With Clip.\n\n264\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.785\nNow scroll over a little bit and\nit gives me a couple of options.\n\n265\n00:13:20.785 --> 00:13:25.730\nFrom the Source Monitor or From The\nSource Monitor With a Match Frame.\n\n266\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.860\nFirst of all, what I'm gonna say\nis all right I'm gonna go just\n\n267\n00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.220\nfrom the Source Monitor.\n\n268\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.830\nIf I do that, the highlighted clip\n\n269\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:40.040\nwill get replace with what's in the source\nmonitor from the beginning of the clip\n\n270\n00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:45.850\nin the source monitor, or\nfrom an endpoint in the source monitor.\n\n271\n00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.700\nSo right now,\nthere's no endpoint or anything so\n\n272\n00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.840\nit's just gonna go from the beginning and\nI go replace From the source monitor.\n\n273\n00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.840\nBoom, it has now been replaced, okay?\n\n274\n00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.720\nAnd there it is.\n\n275\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.580\nIt has been replaced.\n\n276\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.910\nI have replaced that shot.\n\n277\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.235\nIt's gonna hold the same distance.\n\n278\n00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:05.030\n[INAUDIBLE] So\n\n279\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:10.350\nthat way when I turn around I look great,\nall that absolutely fantastic.\n\n280\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.230\nBut it's not really what I wanted.\n\n281\n00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.610\nWhat I can do with what's called\nmatch frame, is sort of time it out.\n\n282\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.880\nSo as I play it,\nI'm listening to what I'm saying.\n\n283\n00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.380\nAnd we're looking to change it, change.\n\n284\n00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.380\nOkay, I'm just holding down K and\ntapping J to go back.\n\n285\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.980\nRight about there is the word change.\n\n286\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:40.340\nAnd I wish when I replace, on\n\n287\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:45.120\nhere there's this little\nshallow depth thing that I do.\n\n288\n00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.100\nI wish on the word change is where\n\n289\n00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:55.020\nit goes from this being in\nfocus to that being in focus.\n\n290\n00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.950\nI really wish I could do that.\n\n291\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:02.720\nThat's what a matched frame replace is,\nas in this playhead here,\n\n292\n00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:08.860\nokay, on the source and then this playhead\ndown here are the matching frames.\n\n293\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.620\nAnd I want to line those up,\nso if I control click and\n\n294\n00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.240\nsay hey do me a favor,\nreplace this clip but\n\n295\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.700\nuse the matching frame and it will\nsay how will it cover the distance?\n\n296\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.470\nWell say okay here's the matching frame\nthat source scope you're giving me,\n\n297\n00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.200\nI'm gonna do on either side of\nthe frame to fill in the distance.\n\n298\n00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.780\nThat would be like,\nokay from source more of matching frame.\n\n299\n00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:38.202\nSo what I do change, it's hard to\nsee now I'll scale it up later,\n\n300\n00:15:38.202 --> 00:15:42.849\nbut it changes from the front, the and\n\n301\n00:15:42.849 --> 00:15:47.520\nfocus to the little bird\nhouse being in focus.\n\n302\n00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.730\nThere is a little shallow depth of field,\nin the word change, it's like it's art,\n\n303\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.350\nnow I'm a director, I feel good,\nI am an editor and now I am a director.\n\n304\n00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.250\nAnd I can do it that way with a replace.\n\n305\n00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.012\nSo how do I wanna replace this thing?\n\n306\n00:16:01.012 --> 00:16:03.852\nWhere I repeat the shot, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:03.852 --> 00:16:08.161\nHere's why the term match frame\nis also very, very important.\n\n308\n00:16:08.161 --> 00:16:12.530\nRight now,\nI don't have anything highlighted, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.040\nI don't have any tracks highlighted\nin here on the right side,\n\n310\n00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.120\nin the timeline side.\n\n311\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.380\nSo the play head, the site angle's\nlike looking down that blue,\n\n312\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.870\nremember blue shirt?\n\n313\n00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.070\nBlue highlight it's like okay\nI don't really see anything,\n\n314\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.660\nI need to see something.\n\n315\n00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.850\nCan I see something?\n\n316\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.040\nSure.\n\n317\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.812\nI'll turn on video 1 on the right side and\n\n318\n00:16:32.812 --> 00:16:37.760\nI'll say what are you trying to\ndo instead of going back and\n\n319\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.200\ntrying to dig through the project\nwindow to find the clip.\n\n320\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.510\nAnd I know we've all done this before.\n\n321\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.430\nIt's like, okay, now I gotta go back\nto project window, maybe I left it at\n\n322\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.170\nthe source window, I don't know, I don't\nknow where it is, how can I find it?\n\n323\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.180\nI'm gonna to do something\ncalled a match frame.\n\n324\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:56.730\nI'm gonna say, all right, the playhead is\nhere, it sees this frame on this clip.\n\n325\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.470\nI would like to reload this master clip.\n\n326\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:05.130\nNot the segment in the timeline, but\nthe master clip in the source monitor so\n\n327\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.220\nI can find a new area to work with.\n\n328\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.670\nAnd all I have to do think match frame,\nthat's f.\n\n329\n00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.700\nJust gonna hit the f key.\n\n330\n00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.840\nBoom, there it is.\n\n331\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.340\nAnd it's now loaded in the source.\n\n332\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:22.640\nNot only that,\nIt shows me from the segment which ins and\n\n333\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.250\nout points I pulled from it.\n\n334\n00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.780\nNow if I take those in points and\nout points out, if I do option io,\n\n335\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.940\nit did not affect what set\nthe segment that is in the timeline.\n\n336\n00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.290\nIt didn't effect that at all.\n\n337\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.240\nThere are ways that it can,\n\n338\n00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.680\nthat I'm gonna show you during\nworking with visual effects.\n\n339\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.510\nBut for night now, if you do a match\nframe, load it back in the source monitor,\n\n340\n00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.510\npull the in and out points,\nnothing happens to what's in the timeline.\n\n341\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.710\nOkay, nothing.\n\n342\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:52.791\nSo I'm gonna come through here.\n\n343\n00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:54.751\n>> And we're looking to change it.\n\n344\n00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:56.975\nWe're looking to change\nup the garden [CROSSTALK]\n\n345\n00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:57.914\n>> Bored.\n\n346\n00:17:57.914 --> 00:18:03.195\n[NOISE] Boom I just tapped L a couple\nof times to go forward, tap L again.\n\n347\n00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:04.099\n>> So I'm doing this video so\n\n348\n00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:08.077\nyou can see what it's like\n>> Okay, I'm doing this video.\n\n349\n00:18:08.077 --> 00:18:13.347\nI, okay, just gonna do an I for\nendpoint there.\n\n350\n00:18:13.347 --> 00:18:15.260\nOkay, I don't care about anything else.\n\n351\n00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.580\nActually, I am gonna do\nwhat Dan talked about.\n\n352\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.220\nI am going to accidentally\nput in an out point.\n\n353\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:25.139\nI mean accidentally put in an out point,\nit's like OK I have an out point there.\n\n354\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.710\nAnd for replace, how is the replace\nedit going to react to this?\n\n355\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.160\nI'm going to just highlight\n\n356\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.855\nthis clip because I'm going to\ndo the video and the audio.\n\n357\n00:18:36.855 --> 00:18:42.890\nCtrl-click and go replace with\nclip from the source monitor.\n\n358\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.269\nHow did it react?\n\n359\n00:18:47.218 --> 00:18:48.130\nLet's take a look.\n\n360\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.950\nI got these weird funny lines here.\n\n361\n00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.090\nLet's see what it put in.\n\n362\n00:18:58.527 --> 00:19:00.445\nOkay.\n\n363\n00:19:00.445 --> 00:19:03.766\n[SOUND] It took it from the beginning.\n\n364\n00:19:03.766 --> 00:19:08.780\nIt didn't really pay attention to\nthe in and the out point did it?\n\n365\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.820\nNo, it didn't pay attention to it at all.\n\n366\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.830\nOkay so what do I do?\n\n367\n00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.430\nWell, what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n368\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:23.380\ngo back to the endpoint,\ngo to it, and say, you know what?\n\n369\n00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.370\nI'm gonna go ahead and pull these in and\nout points, just gonna pull them.\n\n370\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:31.700\nOption IO and say hey, CTRL click,\n\n371\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.820\nlet's do the replace with\nclip from that match frame.\n\n372\n00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.020\nBoom, now I get what I want.\n\n373\n00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.270\n>> Doing this video so you can see what\nit's like to shoot outdoors, make a little\n\n374\n00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.340\nvideo that's about 15 minutes\n>> And it takes exactly what it needs.\n\n375\n00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.435\n>> In this case, all focusing around-\n>> Okay.\n\n376\n00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:51.475\nSo the replacement edit is a very\ninteresting edit in that sense.\n\n377\n00:19:51.475 --> 00:19:55.555\nWhat if, I had decided to do\nan overwrite replacement?\n\n378\n00:19:57.025 --> 00:20:00.030\nWhat would happen with four points then?\n\n379\n00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.640\nLet me just do that as an example.\n\n380\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.050\nLet's say I'm gonna come back here,\ndrop an in point here,\n\n381\n00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.710\ndrop an out point there in the source\nmonitor, and then say, okay,\n\n382\n00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:14.450\nI wanna put this here as\na reaction shot in the timeline.\n\n383\n00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.310\nAnd I want it to go from there,\nin point to their out point and\n\n384\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.370\nI am gonna get really funky with it,\nlet me do this.\n\n385\n00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:26.550\nLet's say I wanna put this audio 2 down\n\n386\n00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:31.820\ninto audio 4, I am just gonna click and\ndrag it, come on you, lets play nice.\n\n387\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.250\nAnd then what that's gonna do is that's\ngonna put the video into video 2 and\n\n388\n00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.130\nthe audio into a3, a4.\n\n389\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.050\nWe're gonna do this with music later\nwhen we decide to put in a music bed and\n\n390\n00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:46.260\nwe have to map A1 and\nA2 into a lower set of tracks.\n\n391\n00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.230\nSo now I have four points.\n\n392\n00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.250\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n393\n00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.739\nLet's just say I'm gonna\ndo that as an overwrite.\n\n394\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:03.730\nClick this guy and\nthen it's gonna say, okay we get it.\n\n395\n00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.020\nThe source is shorter\nthan the destination.\n\n396\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.910\nWould you like some options?\n\n397\n00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.340\nThe one that's interesting\nthat you should know is,\n\n398\n00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:17.150\nthe default that it goes to,\nis Ignore the Sequence Out Point.\n\n399\n00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.380\nSo there's more preference\nto the source monitor.\n\n400\n00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.230\nSo basically, if you just say yeah,\nI just click OK, I didn't mean to do that,\n\n401\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.450\nthe source is what's more important here,\nnot the sequence.\n\n402\n00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.640\n>> It's assuming that what you're\npulling from the source is what you want\n\n403\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.450\n>> Exactly, it's like-\n\n404\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.390\n>> And forget what else you have.\n\n405\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.480\n>> It's like oops,\nI left something in the.\n\n406\n00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.450\nI have done that before too.\n\n407\n00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.230\nIt's like man,\nthere's an out point in there, what?\n\n408\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.190\nWhat happened?\n\n409\n00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.540\nSo yeah.\n\n410\n00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.760\nYou can also do ignore the source in\npoint, ignore the source out point,\n\n411\n00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.330\nignore the sequence in point.\n\n412\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.830\nThe other one is called change clip speed,\nfit to fill.\n\n413\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:52.020\nWhen we deal with speed, what it will do\nis it will say okay make the clip faster.\n\n414\n00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:58.290\nMake the clip slower by fitting it\ninto the range in the timeline.\n\n415\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.910\nIt doesn't work in the reverse.\n\n416\n00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.490\nOkay?\nThe source would have to fit\n\n417\n00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.240\nin the range of the timeline by\nwhat you selected in the source.\n\n418\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.650\nSo, in this case, I'll say,\nactually, yes, that was correct.\n\n419\n00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.915\nNow, you can,\nsome people are like this upsets me.\n\n420\n00:22:14.975 --> 00:22:19.945\nI just, it's always the fact that I\nalways blow the sequence out point,\n\n421\n00:22:19.945 --> 00:22:23.825\nokay, I can look up the fit to fill and\ndo that as a command.\n\n422\n00:22:23.825 --> 00:22:26.890\nI don't worry about the other stuff.\n\n423\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.590\nIt's like, all right, I can just choose to\nsay, always take this and take this away.\n\n424\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.400\nBoom, there it is.\n\n425\n00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.390\nNow it's funny, I'm gonna have two things.\n\n426\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.040\n>> Cleaned out.\n\n427\n00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.000\nSo I'm doing this video.\n\n428\n00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.060\n>> Whoops, sorry about that,\nlet's go back down here.\n\n429\n00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.780\nGotta watch what's highlighted.\n\n430\n00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.510\n>> It's in blue.\n\n431\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.700\n>> And get rid of the-\n>> I know.\n\n432\n00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.520\n>> You can see what it's like in the-\n>> And delay, I'm talking on the top of\n\n433\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.860\nmyself which is really funny,\nso I did not mean to do that.\n\n434\n00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.100\nBut it shows a demo of this whole thing,\n\n435\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.920\nif you accidentally have four points\ninstead of three, what's gonna happen?\n\n436\n00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.740\nAdobe is full aware of this because,\nas an editor,\n\n437\n00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.830\nI like that a lot because\noccasionally I put something in here,\n\n438\n00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.120\nI put something in there,\nI've completely forgotten about it.\n\n439\n00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.810\nAnd then I get this warning, it's like,\ngreat, instead of me performing an edit\n\n440\n00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:14.290\nand then going, wait a minute,\nI don't understand what's happening.\n\n441\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.810\nAnd I didn't realize, there may be\na situation when there's a point somewhere\n\n442\n00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.740\nthat you completely forgot about,\nyou accidentally hit a button.\n\n443\n00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:26.220\nSo this beautiful little\nwarning is just great.\n\n444\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.600\nSo those are overwrite and\nreplacement edits.\n\n445\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.320\nReplacement being somewhat\nof a form of overwrite.\n\n446\n00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.030\nAnd this is fun to play with.\n\n447\n00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.170\nIt's one of those things like,\nget in a timeline,\n\n448\n00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:41.660\nexperiment, see how it works,\nhave fun with it.\n\n449\n00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.680\nSo yeah, so you've added more tools to\nyour toolkit instead of just going,\n\n450\n00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.830\nI'm always gonna use this.\n\n451\n00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:51.560\nNo, occasionally you wanna use something\nelse, and it can be really cool.\n\n452\n00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.980\n>> Yeah, so you can really expand\nyour horizons because now we\n\n453\n00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.840\nhave the ability to say well yeah you know\nI am gonna make it look a little more\n\n454\n00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.348\nawesome than just to state,\nokay here's a couple of me.\n\n455\n00:24:02.348 --> 00:24:03.680\nIt cut to this,\n\n456\n00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.960\nit cut to that, now we've got a nice\ntransition into another piece of media.\n\n457\n00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.730\nIt all starts to come together, it looks\nlike a better way to tell stories,\n\n458\n00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.240\nor put things together, I really like\nthis, and it wasn't too difficult.\n\n459\n00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.960\n>> No, it's not, especially.\n\n460\n00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.470\nThe great thing about Adobe Premiere is,\nI'm just gonna go mess with something.\n\n461\n00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.150\nYou can always mess with it and\nthen go back.\n\n462\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.530\nRemember the autosaves?\n\n463\n00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.180\nYou can always do that.\n\n464\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.420\nWhat does it do?\n\n465\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.090\nToo many times people are really afraid.\n\n466\n00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.400\nThey're like I'm gonna do something and\nI'm not gonna know what happened.\n\n467\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.340\nNo, it's like what does this thing do?\n\n468\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.090\nClick it up.\n\n469\n00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.450\nIt's like, have fun with it.\n\n470\n00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.540\n>> That's right.\n>> I mean, that's the best part.\n\n471\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.260\nAnd then you have more\nfun with your story.\n\n472\n00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.390\n>> I'm gonna say, if there's a knob, or\na switch, flick it, turn it, do whatever.\n\n473\n00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.020\n>> Why not?\n>> See what'll happen,\n\n474\n00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:49.760\nyou never know, right?\n\n475\n00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.290\n>> It's not like messing with\nyour friend's radio in his car,\n\n476\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:52.870\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n477\n00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.230\n>> It's like don't touch the buttons.\n\n478\n00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.600\nNo, it's like touch the button.\n\n479\n00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.930\n>> Yeah, everything you see, click it find\nout what it does, that's the way to play.\n\n480\n00:24:58.930 --> 00:24:59.730\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n481\n00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.660\n>> Well James,\nwe appreciate you dropping by today,\n\n482\n00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.553\nand showing us how we can do these\noverwrites and replacements.\n\n483\n00:25:04.553 --> 00:25:07.803\nIt's some really cool stuff, hopefully\nit's going to work out very well for\n\n484\n00:25:07.803 --> 00:25:09.560\nyou in your environment as well.\n\n485\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.035\nBut, looking at the clock, looks like\nwe've run out of time for today.\n\n486\n00:25:12.035 --> 00:25:13.983\n>> [SOUND]\n>> Well, not for completely today,\n\n487\n00:25:13.983 --> 00:25:15.710\nwe have more shows we'll shoot today.\n\n488\n00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.440\nHow about that?\n>> Okay, good.\n\n489\n00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.250\n>> So we'll do more for\n\n490\n00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.070\nyou guys out there, we'll give you\na little more of that je ne sais quoi.\n\n491\n00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.180\n>> Little more, little more, okay.\n\n492\n00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.570\n>> All right, we appreciate it,\nwe thank you guys for watching, but\n\n493\n00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.360\nwe are gonna sign off.\n\n494\n00:25:25.360 -->

another\nexciting episode of ITproTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:17.921\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.620\nAnd in today's episode, well, we're going\non with more in our Premier Pro series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.310\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain today to be our muse,\n\n7\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.920\nour guiding star in that endeavor,\nour good friend, Mr. James Bittle.\n\n8\n00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.630\nWelcome back, James.\n\n9\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.440\nWe're so glad to have you.\n\n10\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.489\n>> Thank you, sir.\nI'm a muse now.\n\n11\n00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so we've done quite a bit.\n\n12\n00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.401\nWe've looked at some overwrites,\nwe've looked at some replace.\n\n13\n00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:39.990\nWe're gonna step it up a little bit here.\n\n14\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.480\nWe're gonna really step it up and add\nsome things, because I know at this point\n\n15\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.912\nyou've probably been going through this,\nyou've been practicing.\n\n16\n00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.190\nI'm gonna have positive hopes on that.\n\n17\n00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.580\nYou've been practicing,\ntrying some things,\n\n18\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.910\nand you're like I've got questions.\n\n19\n00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.650\nAnd I think I know what\nthose questions are, and\n\n20\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.220\nI'm gonna answer as many of them as I can.\n\n21\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.050\nSo, what I'm gonna tackle is two things,\nstoryboard edits and\n\n22\n00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.555\nsomething called Automate to Sequence,\nwhich I think you're really gonna like.\n\n23\n00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:07.615\nSo, I'm gonna jump back\ninto my project here.\n\n24\n00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:12.915\nAnd what I'm thinking about doing is\nadding a lot of reaction shots up here.\n\n25\n00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:16.765\nI've got these pictures,\nI've got this other video I shot.\n\n26\n00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:18.145\nMe talking is just kinda boring.\n\n27\n00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:23.870\nAnd what I'm thinking is a lot of people\nget uncomfortable saying I'm gonna,\n\n28\n00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.100\ndo I really have to work on it in this?\n\n29\n00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.400\nCan't I make another sequence,\nand work on it there?\n\n30\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.540\nAbsolutely, you can have\nmultiple sequences.\n\n31\n00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.930\nAnd I'm gonna show you a really cool\ntrick you can do with sequences, too.\n\n32\n00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.730\nSo, let me come back over\nhere to the project window.\n\n33\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.350\nAnd I'm gonna hit the tilda key,\nmake it real big.\n\n34\n00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.800\nAnd I've got everything organized.\n\n35\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.220\nI've even made a sequences bin.\n\n36\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.280\nSo, I'm going to create a new one,\nbut without putting any media in it.\n\n37\n00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.060\nNow, this might be a little bit scary,\nokay?\n\n38\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.720\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm gonna come\nup to File in the menu bar, all right?\n\n39\n00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.600\nAnd there's just a New.\n\n40\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.812\nWithin New, you will find, I can\ncreate a new project, a new sequence.\n\n41\n00:02:05.812 --> 00:02:09.450\nI'm gonna do this later, where people will\nactually work in a different project.\n\n42\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.700\nAnd then they'll say, well,\nif I work in a different project,\n\n43\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.450\nhow do I get a sequence from that\nproject into another project?\n\n44\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.590\nAnd I'm going to show you\nwhy you love media browser.\n\n45\n00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.500\nBut I'm gonna do that later with effects,\nokay?\n\n46\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.870\nFor right now, I'm just gonna\nsay let's do a new sequence.\n\n47\n00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.000\nAnd what will happen?\n\n48\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.940\nThis will happen.\n\n49\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.560\nYou get a menu of how to\ncreate a new sequence,\n\n50\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.265\nhow to build it from the ground up.\n\n51\n00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:38.545\nAnd you may look at it and\ngo, scared, done, gone.\n\n52\n00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:40.125\n>> There's a lot of words on the screen.\n\n53\n00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:41.375\n>> I know, there's a lot of words,\n\n54\n00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.765\nthere's a lot of concepts that\nyou might not be familiar.\n\n55\n00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:46.365\nIt's like, I just wanna make this,\nwhy do I have to know this?\n\n56\n00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:52.267\nWell, with Adobe, you can get close,\nand everything will be fine, all right?\n\n57\n00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:54.197\nSo let me just sorta jump in here.\n\n58\n00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:57.477\nAnd, like I said,\ntop to bottom, left to right.\n\n59\n00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.467\nYou have available presets,\n\n60\n00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:03.650\nas in they know you might be working\nwith a certain kind of camera.\n\n61\n00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.680\nSo, you can just sort\nof target that camera.\n\n62\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.350\nWell, I kind of worked with something,\na digital SLR, so I'll just look in there.\n\n63\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.460\nAnd I'll say, okay, I'm working,\nwhat was my last sequence?\n\n64\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.780\nI don't remember my last sequence.\n\n65\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.520\nSo, let me jump out of this real quick,\nokay?\n\n66\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.740\nAnd go back and say, wait a minute,\nis this 1280 by 720?\n\n67\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.450\nI've got a couple of different\ntricks to figure that out.\n\n68\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.177\nRemember, I could say, by going to the\npanel menu in the timeline, I could say,\n\n69\n00:03:37.177 --> 00:03:40.540\nhey, let's reveal\nthe sequence in the project.\n\n70\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.945\nAnd then, I can use the preview area,\nor I can come up to the top with\n\n71\n00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:50.014\nthe timeline highlighted and say,\nhey, sequence, show me the settings.\n\n72\n00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:54.890\nAnd I'll come up here and\nsay a-ha, it is 1280 by 720,\n\n73\n00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.770\nand it's 23.976 Frames per second.\n\n74\n00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.910\nGreat.\n\n75\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.100\nNow I know if I want my sequences to\nmatch, that's all I need to know.\n\n76\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.970\nSo I'll come up, I'll go sequence.\n\n77\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.200\nI'm sorry, file, no.\n\n78\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.040\nI often, it's so funny,\nI do that a lot where I go to sequence.\n\n79\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.680\nI'm like, I'll get my new sequence there.\n\n80\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.750\nWait a minute.\n\n81\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.040\nIt's File, it's New, it's Sequence.\n\n82\n00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.660\nEverybody does that at some point.\n\n83\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.410\nSo, if you do that,\nwelcome to the Adobe club.\n\n84\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.650\nOkay, so here we go.\n\n85\n00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.330\nAnd I'll say, all right,\nit defaults to DV,\n\n86\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.950\nbecause everything sort\nof started with DV.\n\n87\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.120\nAnd I'll say no, that's not it.\n\n88\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.660\nI'll go to Digital SLR,\ncuz that's all camera.\n\n89\n00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.953\n720.\nAnd it's like a-ha,\n\n90\n00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:40.940\nhere is something with 24 P at 23.976.\n\n91\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.980\nAnd I'll say, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.560\nIt'll have a description.\n\n93\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.276\nIt's generally for a DSLR,\nwhich is kinda what I shot that on.\n\n94\n00:04:49.276 --> 00:04:52.940\nAt 23.976, it's one square pixel.\n\n95\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.530\nHey, this looks a lot like what I did.\n\n96\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.420\nSo, I'll say, okay, hey,\nI can do this, this isn't so bad.\n\n97\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.540\nI'll go to Settings.\n\n98\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.170\nAnd there are things in here like, okay,\nthe editing mode is DSLR, 1920 by 720,\n\n99\n00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.540\nblah blah blah blah blah blah.\n\n100\n00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.640\nWe come down here to something\ncalled video previews,\n\n101\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.430\nwhich we're gonna mess with\nlater at another time, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.170\nBut these are like your renders, where you\ncan actually create renders of effects\n\n103\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.845\nthat might be lower than\nwhat you're working with.\n\n104\n00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:27.800\nWhy?\nBecause that will make your render time go\n\n105\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.530\nfaster, if you need to do that.\n\n106\n00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.562\nMaybe your RAM's not so great.\n\n107\n00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:34.260\nYou've got a great computer, but\nyou had to kinda compromise on the RAM.\n\n108\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.300\nSo, you can make your previews smaller,\nokay?\n\n109\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.460\nYou can take them down.\n\n110\n00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.110\nIt'll render faster.\n\n111\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.760\nAnd then you say but\nwhat happens when I export?\n\n112\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.400\nWell, I'll show you that when we export.\n\n113\n00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.970\nLet's worry about this now.\n\n114\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.830\nOkay.\n>> Eat what's on your plate, Jim.\n\n115\n00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.320\n>> Yeah, I think so.\nBut that's what happens.\n\n116\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.995\nThat's what happens in Adobe until you\nstart thinking, well, what about this,\n\n117\n00:05:51.995 --> 00:05:52.984\nwhat about this will happen?\n\n118\n00:05:52.984 --> 00:05:55.434\nIt's like worry about\nwhat's happening now.\n\n119\n00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:58.750\nEverything in the future,\nyou can take care of.\n\n120\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.250\nTracks.\n\n121\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.070\nThis is where I can say,\n\n122\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.620\nI don't think I want three video\ntracks in this sequence I'm creating.\n\n123\n00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.490\nI'll just make it one, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.970\nI just want one.\n\n125\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.670\nAnd then four audio tracks.\n\n126\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.870\nI'm just gonna add some music.\n\n127\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.122\nAnd believe it or not,\nsince I'm adding music,\n\n128\n00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:21.211\nI'm going to actually have just one.\n\n129\n00:06:22.547 --> 00:06:24.319\nAnd you're gonna say to yourself,\nbut wait a minute.\n\n130\n00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.320\nThe last time we did this,\nhit the little delete key, there's a plus,\n\n131\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.130\nthere's a minus.\n\n132\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.920\nDelete.\n\n133\n00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.240\nSay wait a minute,\nwait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n134\n00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.100\nWhen you added audio last time,\nthere were two.\n\n135\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.410\nI'm gonna show you the difference\nbetween getting a two and a one, okay?\n\n136\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.410\nSo, for that reason,\nI'll add a track back in.\n\n137\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.400\nAnd then the master, as it goes out,\nI'm just gonna leave it as stereo.\n\n138\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.900\nSo, when I come back,\nI can save this preset if I want to, and\n\n139\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.390\nI'll say I can use it again and\nagain and again.\n\n140\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.310\nBut in this case, it's like, no,\nI don't really wanna save it.\n\n141\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.353\nI just wanna do this real quick.\n\n142\n00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:04.813\nI'm just gonna say Picture_Montage, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:04.813 --> 00:07:06.280\nJust like that.\n\n144\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.320\nI'm just gonna use it once.\n\n145\n00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.600\nIt's absolutely fine,\nI'll just use it once.\n\n146\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.910\nClick OK, and I have a new sequence.\n\n147\n00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.730\nAll right?\nI have a brand new sequence.\n\n148\n00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:21.340\nI'm gonna come over here, and\nI'm going hit my tilde key, like that.\n\n149\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.400\nAnd I originally said, hey,\nI'm gonna use the clips.\n\n150\n00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.088\nNow, I have a picture montage, I'm gonna\nmake sure that's in my sequences bin.\n\n151\n00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.810\nSo that way,\nall my sequences are organized.\n\n152\n00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.250\nSome people like that,\nother people don't, absolutely fine.\n\n153\n00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.580\nSo, let's see.\n\n154\n00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.990\nI've got garden clips, a garden focus.\n\n155\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.090\nAnd let's see, do I have any stills?\n\n156\n00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.930\nYeah, I have stills under the interview.\n\n157\n00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.890\nSo, I'm gonna take these, shift-click, and\n\n158\n00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:55.275\nI'm gonna put them first\nin the source monitor.\n\n159\n00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:57.250\nCtrl-click, open in source monitor.\n\n160\n00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.812\nAnd maybe sort through them, and\nadd ins and out points, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:01.812 --> 00:08:05.428\nMay just add ins and out points Now there\nare pictures and that's why this is weird.\n\n162\n00:08:05.428 --> 00:08:06.590\nIt's like, what's going on?\n\n163\n00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.250\nDoes it separate them?\n\n164\n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.120\nYeah it separates them.\n\n165\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.440\nAnd it has them in certain lengths and\nI can put ins and out points on them.\n\n166\n00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.030\nNow let's say I do want to time them out.\n\n167\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.945\nI want them to all be about\ntwo seconds long, okay?\n\n168\n00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:27.490\nWhat I can do is this.\n\n169\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.250\nI'll come through and\nmake this source window big.\n\n170\n00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.760\nTell the key again.\n\n171\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.112\nAnd I'm gonna give myself some handle,\nokay.\n\n172\n00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:37.850\nHandle mean, I'm not gonna do\nthis straight at the front.\n\n173\n00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.840\nI'm gonna go in a little bit.\n\n174\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.680\nDrop an end point and I'll say hey,\nI want this to be five seconds long.\n\n175\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.010\nIt's like, okay.\n\n176\n00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.370\nHow do I make it exactly\nfive seconds long?\n\n177\n00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.480\nHold on.\nShift hit + on here.\n\n178\n00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:59.460\nHighlight, here go, +5,\nthen a period, boom.\n\n179\n00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.550\nAnd I just went forward five seconds and\n\n180\n00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.950\nit's like,\nthat doesn't look like five seconds.\n\n181\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.999\nDon't judge time by looking at the bar,\nokay,\n\n182\n00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:09.600\ndon't judge time by looking at the bar.\n\n183\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.820\nAnd then I will hit out.\n\n184\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.210\nBoom, now here's the issue.\n\n185\n00:09:17.709 --> 00:09:20.340\nIt says five seconds and one frame.\n\n186\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.530\nI mean, how did that happen?\n\n187\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.360\nIf we go back to, and\nI'm gonna zoom in on this, come here,\n\n188\n00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.500\nzoom in, remember our friend the playhead,\n\n189\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.980\nwhen we mark an outpoint on\nthe play head it is at the end.\n\n190\n00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.940\nTime is being mark from here so\nthat's five seconds.\n\n191\n00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.440\nWhen I marked the outpoint\nit was a frame longer.\n\n192\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.070\nSo it's like all I have to remember\nto do is back up one frame,\n\n193\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.740\nhit the outpoint,\nnow that is five seconds, okay?\n\n194\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.361\nNow that is five seconds.\n\n195\n00:09:52.361 --> 00:09:53.174\n>> That's a nifty little trick there.\n\n196\n00:09:53.174 --> 00:09:56.290\n>> Yep, it is kind of fun.\n\n197\n00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.280\nNow, and I can do this in video too.\n\n198\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.749\nI might say you know,\nthis is a terrible name.\n\n199\n00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:06.710\nMIOA something,\nthat is a terrible, terrible name.\n\n200\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.280\nWhat if I wanted to turn\nthis into its own clip?\n\n201\n00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.850\nWhat I can do is say, okay,\nthis that I'm looking at is a clip.\n\n202\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.000\nI can come to Clip in the menu bar and\n\n203\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.570\nsay, rename it, modify it,\nit's hard to do with video.\n\n204\n00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.940\nI could technically try and\n\n205\n00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:29.390\nmake a sub clip of things, but\nwith stills, I really can't.\n\n206\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.799\nLike what people say is, I wanna make\na sub clip of this, wait a minute,\n\n207\n00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:32.377\nI can't do that.\n\n208\n00:10:32.377 --> 00:10:34.086\nCan rename it though.\n\n209\n00:10:34.086 --> 00:10:36.666\nAnd I can say, Elephant.\n\n210\n00:10:38.358 --> 00:10:39.800\nPlant.\nYou know how I know this?\n\n211\n00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.973\nMy wife told me that\nthat's what the name is.\n\n212\n00:10:41.973 --> 00:10:43.270\nAll right, otherwise, I have no idea.\n\n213\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.060\nSo that's called elephant plant.\n\n214\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.220\nSo I can do it up here.\n\n215\n00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:47.888\nOkay?\n\n216\n00:10:47.888 --> 00:10:49.712\nAnd, do that.\n\n217\n00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:55.410\nNow, I can go back and\nI can do this with all of these.\n\n218\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.770\nI can just kind of go through here, and\n\n219\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.170\nI can go boom, all right,\nand I'll do this quickly.\n\n220\n00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:03.290\nDrop in in points, go to this guy.\n\n221\n00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.190\nShift+5point.\n\n222\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.640\nGo five seconds.\n\n223\n00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.210\nOkay, go back one frame.\n\n224\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.670\nAnd I'm using the left and\n\n225\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.210\nright arrows to do frames now instead\nof holding down K and doing J.\n\n226\n00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:22.580\nAnd then going with an out point and\nI got five again, clip, rename it.\n\n227\n00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.700\nI'm just gonna say it looks like a bird\nbath there, bird bath, okay, Birdbath.\n\n228\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.210\nAll right so just two for now.\n\n229\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.270\nWhat I can actually do is once\nI've marked a bunch of these,\n\n230\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:40.290\nlet's say those are the only two\nthat I want to rename and retime,\n\n231\n00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:45.450\nI can actually just lasso all of these and\ngo, you know what?\n\n232\n00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.750\nI'm just gonna put those\nright there in video.\n\n233\n00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.460\nBoom.\n\n234\n00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.670\nThat's a storyboard edit.\n\n235\n00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.040\nWhere I just said, you know what?\n\n236\n00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.930\nThere they are.\n\n237\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.826\nI lassoed them, I timed them out, and\n\n238\n00:11:55.826 --> 00:12:01.522\nhit them and\njust lined them up end to end.\n\n239\n00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:05.090\nThat is exactly what I did, now the rest\nof these are really, really long.\n\n240\n00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.830\nOkay?\n\n241\n00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.900\nBut I've made technically\na picture montage.\n\n242\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:18.400\nNow the next thing you're seeing is\nthat doesn't really look like that.\n\n243\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.050\n>> It does not.\n\n244\n00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.260\n>> No.\nThat's because this sequence is 1280 by\n\n245\n00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.130\n720.\n\n246\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.820\nIf I go back and look at the resolution\nof the pictures, it's quite huge.\n\n247\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:34.628\nSo, if I say, all right,\nI will highlight everything.\n\n248\n00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:36.180\nNow I could either lasso it.\n\n249\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.680\nI could do a Cmd+A.\n\n250\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.980\nAnd I have Ctrl-click.\n\n251\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.380\nAnd I have two options.\n\n252\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.320\nScale to Frame Size or Set to Frame Size.\n\n253\n00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.020\nI'm gonna hit the effects controls here\nand I'm just gonna highlight one of them.\n\n254\n00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.868\nWhen I look at that and I highlight it,\nit tells me certain things.\n\n255\n00:13:00.868 --> 00:13:03.800\nIt's like, this at 100%.\n\n256\n00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:10.342\nIf I look at Scale, it's telling me by\nhighlighting it's like, Scale is 100%.\n\n257\n00:13:10.342 --> 00:13:16.120\nAnd at 100%, it's huge compared\nto this 12 [INAUDIBLE], is big.\n\n258\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.443\nWhat I can say is, if I choose to say,\n\n259\n00:13:22.443 --> 00:13:26.193\nCtrl-click, okay, and\n\n260\n00:13:26.193 --> 00:13:30.118\nset this to the frame size.\n\n261\n00:13:30.118 --> 00:13:30.618\nBoom.\n\n262\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:38.626\nNotice the scale has moved to 18.8, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:38.626 --> 00:13:44.200\nThe 18.8 means, okay,\nit's now a scale of 18.8.\n\n264\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.898\nI can resize this.\n\n265\n00:13:45.898 --> 00:13:50.360\nI can re-size this up to 100,\n\n266\n00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.280\nmaybe go up a little higher,\nwithout losing resolution.\n\n267\n00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.720\nAnd this is where you can do the things\nlike you've seen in documentaries where\n\n268\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.630\nthey take still pictures and\nthey do this crazy motion.\n\n269\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.357\nWhen we get into visual effects,\n\n270\n00:14:02.357 --> 00:14:05.822\nthat's exactly what we're gonna\ndo with these pictures, okay.\n\n271\n00:14:05.822 --> 00:14:09.450\nNow, let me go back.\n\n272\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:14.704\nZ, what would happen if I\ndid scale to frame size?\n\n273\n00:14:14.704 --> 00:14:19.112\nIf I do scale to frame size notice it\n\n274\n00:14:19.112 --> 00:14:23.824\ngoes back to that size from before but\n\n275\n00:14:23.824 --> 00:14:28.234\nit is now considered at 100%.\n\n276\n00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:31.655\nOkay, in a way there's all kinds of\ntechnical language of what it does.\n\n277\n00:14:31.655 --> 00:14:34.700\nIt's kind of rasterize it if you will.\n\n278\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:41.000\nAnd now if I scale too much\nI will lose resolution.\n\n279\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.750\nSo that's why there's a difference\nbetween the set and the scale.\n\n280\n00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.240\nSome people are like, I just wanna scale\nit cuz I just want it to be where it is.\n\n281\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.120\nI don't want all of that extra size and\nall that.\n\n282\n00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.420\nAnd it's like, okay, but\nwhat if you wanna do it lighter?\n\n283\n00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.510\nThen use set.\n\n284\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.620\nIf I don't, use scale.\n\n285\n00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.320\nAnd I can use this in mass.\n\n286\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.600\nLike I said, I can go Cmd+A, Ctrl click,\n\n287\n00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:14.640\nand then say Set to Frame Size and\nit will do all of them.\n\n288\n00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.949\nSo now I've made that happen.\n\n289\n00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:19.060\nOkay, I've made that happen,\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n290\n00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.230\nIt looks like it's moving because\nI just did it real quick.\n\n291\n00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.720\nSo that's kinda cool, so\nthat's a storyboard edit, okay.\n\n292\n00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.330\nThat is a storyboard edit.\n\n293\n00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:36.085\nWhat if I wanna use something\ncool called automate to sequence.\n\n294\n00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:40.825\nAutomate to sequence, the difference\nbetween it is I can choose a sort order.\n\n295\n00:15:40.825 --> 00:15:42.545\nAnd I can do something\nelse that's really cool.\n\n296\n00:15:42.545 --> 00:15:48.245\nSo, if I come back here and do this,\nand I say, all right, let me do this.\n\n297\n00:15:48.245 --> 00:15:50.385\nI'm gonna choose the birdbath.\n\n298\n00:15:50.385 --> 00:15:55.326\nThen I will Cmd click and choose this one,\nCmd click and choose that one,\n\n299\n00:15:55.326 --> 00:15:58.493\nand then Cmd click and\nuse the elephant plant.\n\n300\n00:15:58.493 --> 00:16:02.293\nLet me give myself some real estate here\nso you can see this a little bit better.\n\n301\n00:16:02.293 --> 00:16:06.649\nThat's the issue about this, if I'm trying\nto do this, you need to see the bottom.\n\n302\n00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:12.010\nLeft here, I drag it over this thing and\nit says automate to sequence.\n\n303\n00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:17.000\nAnd I click down, go over it,\n\n304\n00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.070\nlet go, and then it says okay,\nwhat do you want to do?\n\n305\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.470\nIt's like I want to put it in by\nthe way that I selected it not\n\n306\n00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.180\nby the way that it's sorted in the bin.\n\n307\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.670\nPlacement sequentially yes,\n\n308\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.170\nwe are going to talk about\nnumbered markers here in a minute.\n\n309\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.640\nDo it as an overwrite edit, why do I\ncare as an overwrite versus an insert?\n\n310\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.670\nWell, if I'm gonna put it over\nthe top of some existing footage\n\n311\n00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.870\nI'd wanna override that.\n\n312\n00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.970\nIn this case it really doesn't matter.\n\n313\n00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.470\nI can use the in to out range,\nif I have set it, on a couple that I have.\n\n314\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.710\nHere's a cool thing.\n\n315\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:53.890\nI could say hey apply the default\nvideo transition so that's dissolved,\n\n316\n00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:58.250\nit immediately puts in dissolves that\nI can't just do by a storyboard drag.\n\n317\n00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.010\nSo I think I'll do that.\n\n318\n00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.940\nI will click okay and\nyou're like, nothing happened.\n\n319\n00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.130\nWell I've got to come back and\ntake a look at it.\n\n320\n00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.930\nBoom, and there it is.\n\n321\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:14.620\nAnd it did it by the order that\nI put everything in, okay?\n\n322\n00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.010\nIt did it by the order that I selected,\nboom, there it is.\n\n323\n00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.390\nWe're playing it, probably after five\nseconds we should get, yeah, see?\n\n324\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.020\nAnd it automatically\nputs in the dissolves.\n\n325\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.400\nAnd that's really cool.\n\n326\n00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.290\n>> That is cool.\n\n327\n00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.520\n>> And it gives you a chance\nto do this really quick, and\n\n328\n00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.560\nyou can do it by the sort order.\n\n329\n00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.120\nNow, what am I gonna do now?\n\n330\n00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.670\nHere's the thing is occasionally\nyou might decide hey,\n\n331\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.870\nI'm going to do a music montage.\n\n332\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.330\nI want to do this really\ncool music montage.\n\n333\n00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.840\nAnd I wanna do it to the beat of music.\n\n334\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.250\nAnd sometimes that takes\na really really long time.\n\n335\n00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.870\nNot with automated sequence,\nyou can have a lot of fun with that.\n\n336\n00:17:54.870 --> 00:18:00.123\nLike if I go to Music, and I'm just gonna\npick a piece of music here, let's see,\n\n337\n00:18:00.123 --> 00:18:04.933\nI think I have one, let's take a look\nat credits, okay and we gonna play.\n\n338\n00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:06.704\n[MUSIC]\n\n339\n00:18:06.704 --> 00:18:08.330\nOkay that's not a bad one.\n\n340\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.229\nNow,\n[MUSIC]\n\n341\n00:18:12.229 --> 00:18:17.660\nThe thing you may notice is you might say,\nhey, what's going on?\n\n342\n00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.550\nIf I look over here,\nwhy is there only one?\n\n343\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:28.400\nThe last time I did this I had two,\nI had an A1 and an A2.\n\n344\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.340\nThe way this was brought over\nthe way this came in as a file,\n\n345\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.810\nit said, look, yes,\nyou have two channels, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:44.830\nYou have two channels but\nit's only going to go into one track.\n\n347\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.930\nTracks and\nchannels are handled differently.\n\n348\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.450\nI can change this.\n\n349\n00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.110\nIf you just wanna say,\nhey look, I like two channels.\n\n350\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.690\nI like a quote, unquote left and a right.\n\n351\n00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.440\nI don't like this whole\nthing where I'm doing that.\n\n352\n00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:03.150\nIf I come to the credits they just used,\nin the projet file, go Ctrl+click.\n\n353\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.450\nThis is a modification\nof the audio channels.\n\n354\n00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:15.240\nNow what it's saying is look,\nIt's doing stereo.\n\n355\n00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.790\nSo it's gonna put the stereo\nchannels into one track.\n\n356\n00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.400\nAnd I'll say, look.\n\n357\n00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.930\nLet me go mono, okay, with 2.\n\n358\n00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:31.340\nIt's like a-ha, then it'll say,\n1, 2 like that.\n\n359\n00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.410\nClick OK, now we have 2.\n\n360\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.150\nWe have an A1 and an A2.\n\n361\n00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.710\nSome people prefer that, okay.\n\n362\n00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.640\nI'm gonna go ahead and do that for now but\n\n363\n00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.450\nlater on we're gonna do it\nthe other way that the Dolby has.\n\n364\n00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:55.010\nSo, I'll bring this in, just do a quick\nover write, boom, there's my music.\n\n365\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.882\nIt's really loud.\n\n366\n00:19:55.882 --> 00:19:58.417\n[MUSIC]\n\n367\n00:19:58.417 --> 00:20:01.540\nYou might say to yourself,\nhey that's really loud.\n\n368\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:06.770\nCan I modify it over in the source side,\nand will it affect in the timeline?\n\n369\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.470\nA lot of people ask me that, because they\nsay you did that great thing earlier.\n\n370\n00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.900\nOkay let me make these tracks\nbigger using option plus.\n\n371\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.060\nIt's like you did that thing earlier\nwhere what you did was you upped\n\n372\n00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.710\nthe gain in all that.\n\n373\n00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.740\nIf I do it now, is it going to\naffect what's in the sequence?\n\n374\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:30.450\nControl click,\nlet's go to game, audio game,\n\n375\n00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.730\nand I'll say, you know let's kick that\nback about negative six decibels.\n\n376\n00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.540\nOkay, let's adjust that down.\n\n377\n00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.910\nI will click OK.\n\n378\n00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.390\nIt is affected here.\n\n379\n00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.830\nIt is not affected in the sequence.\n\n380\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.380\nSo since I added the whole thing,\nI could do a replacement.\n\n381\n00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:53.050\nI think technically what I'll just\ndo is override this back in, boom,\n\n382\n00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.690\nand you can see the wave difference.\n\n383\n00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.010\n>> Because it was affected only in\nthe source we have to override or\n\n384\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.290\nreplace, sometimes, sometimes,\nyou will affect things in the source that\n\n385\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.900\nwill affect in the sequence,\nand sometimes it won't happen.\n\n386\n00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.390\nIn the case of this gain it didn't really\ndo that, but guess what I could have\n\n387\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.240\nsubverted that by going control things\nsay, hey is that gain available on here?\n\n388\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.460\nYup.\n\n389\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.250\nAnd look, so as audio channels.\n\n390\n00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.330\nI could have done that too which is\ninteresting is that I can technically, and\n\n391\n00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.450\nthen it doesn't affect the source.\n\n392\n00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.930\nSo that's where that left side,\nright side relationship comes on.\n\n393\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:31.910\nAll right, now All I'm gonna do\nis I'm going to add some markers.\n\n394\n00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.230\nAnd just what I feel I like\nthe transition points okay.\n\n395\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.980\nI'm just go play it in\nthe M key it's from marker,\n\n396\n00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.978\nthat's a fairly easy way to remember.\n\n397\n00:21:39.978 --> 00:21:41.360\n>> That's pretty simple.\n\n398\n00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.150\n>> I'm gonna make sure\nthat my clip in here or\n\n399\n00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.170\nmy segment in this case not highlighted.\n\n400\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.990\nOkay, so that way It's add marker and\n\n401\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.390\nit adds it to the actual timeline so\nhere I go.\n\n402\n00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.320\nI'm just going to hit L.\n\n403\n00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.300\nBoom.\n\n404\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.120\nAnd just as I, notice as I do it.\n\n405\n00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:08.833\nBoom.\n\n406\n00:22:08.833 -->

between there.\n\n409\n00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.480\nAlmost like I was gonna\nedit things in there, okay?\n\n410\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.290\nI guess it's kinda wacky.\n\n411\n00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.640\nSo, I'm gonna make sure I put my\nplayhead all the way back to the front.\n\n412\n00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.680\nCause that's where I want\nthis to start happening.\n\n413\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.260\nCome back over here and I can do this\nwith pictures, I can do this with video,\n\n414\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.750\ndoesn't matter,\nmaybe I will start with some pictures and\n\n415\n00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.610\nI'll just lasso this\ngroup here in the middle.\n\n416\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.320\nBring them over automate to sequence and\nchange some of these things.\n\n417\n00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.340\nDo I want them at the selection order?\n\n418\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.800\nJust the sort order is fine.\n\n419\n00:22:55.800 -->

to.\n\n509\n00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.550\nIt's like, sure.\n\n510\n00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.360\nAnd it's not the labor that you go\nthrough, it's like all right, in point,\n\n511\n00:27:16.360 -->

Then they show you how to reorder clips by moving them without creating gaps or overwriting. Finally, they look at trimming; removing unwanted bits of audio/video/both using the Trim Tools to perform Rolling and Ripple edits.",

another great episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.460\nAnd in today's episode, well, guess what?\n\n5\n00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.900\nWe're doing more Premiere Pro.\n\n6\n00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.520\nHopefully that's what you're looking for\ncuz that's what we're doing.\n\n7\n00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.260\nAnd joining us in the studio, to actually\nteach us these methods and the madness,\n\n8\n00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.240\nthat is, our good friend Mr James Biddle.\n\n9\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.070\nJames, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.930\n>> If it was anything else you\nwould all be in big trouble.\n\n11\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.810\nSo yeah, I'm gonna stick with Premiere.\n\n12\n00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.060\nAll right, so upping our game again,\nwe talked a little bit about editing,\n\n13\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.940\ngetting it from left side to right side,\nall that.\n\n14\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.505\nNow we're gonna tackle something\nthat a lot of people try to avoid,\n\n15\n00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.655\nyou don't want to, remember,\ndon't just use a hammer.\n\n16\n00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:54.525\nWe're gonna do some trimming,\nsome moving, and some removing, okay?\n\n17\n00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:58.405\nSo I'm gonna go back to beautiful\nPremiere here, it's so beautiful.\n\n18\n00:00:58.405 --> 00:00:59.265\n>> Lovely interface.\n\n19\n00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:01.300\n>> Now, I call this trimming,\na lot of people don't,\n\n20\n00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.300\nbut I like to call this trimming subclips.\n\n21\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.770\nA lot of people don't\nknow what subclips are.\n\n22\n00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.834\nThey're very cool, actually.\n\n23\n00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:13.343\nI did, let's see, where did I put it?\n\n24\n00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:16.136\n>> Garden focus, garden interview,\n\n25\n00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:21.250\nI could use that search which would\nbe a lot better at this point.\n\n26\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.630\nBut let me just open these all up.\n\n27\n00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.330\nYes, I have this one called\ninner garden and outer garden.\n\n28\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.660\nGonna go ahead and double-click it and\nload it into the source monitor.\n\n29\n00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.240\nAnd say, what i did was I shot\nall this using Adobe Clip,\n\n30\n00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.990\nand I shot it on my phone,\n\n31\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.800\nand I made a little sequence, it was up\non the cloud and then I brought it in.\n\n32\n00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.600\nNow what I did with the interview\nwas I simply put ins and\n\n33\n00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.700\nout points and\nput the different segments of it in there.\n\n34\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.080\nSome people might say, hey, it would\nbe nice if I could take that clip and\n\n35\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.760\nbreak it up into smaller subsets\nthat I could work with, or\n\n36\n00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.830\nsubclips, and you can do that.\n\n37\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.580\nAnd I consider this a form of trimming.\n\n38\n00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.840\nSo let me just show you.\n\n39\n00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.010\nI have several shots loaded in here.\n\n40\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.250\nI'm just gonna keep tapping L, go through\nthem quickly, there's the hummingbird\n\n41\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.870\nfeeder, there's the wasp trap,\nthere's my beautiful banana plant,\n\n42\n00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.000\nthere's the bamboo that's\nIt's taking over my yard.\n\n43\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.620\nAnd so what if I wanted to\nbreak that up into four shots\n\n44\n00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.810\nthat could be in the project window?\n\n45\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.980\nOkay, I showed you in the last\none I can't do that with stills.\n\n46\n00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.340\nBut video, I can do that.\n\n47\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.310\nWatch this.\n\n48\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.730\nPut an end point at the beginning here,\nI'm gonna get close in here.\n\n49\n00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.920\nAll right, use my left arrow, right arrow.\n\n50\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.060\nOkay, pop an out point and\nthen going to clip, make subclip.\n\n51\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.240\nIf you're ever looking, does something\nhave a hot key, look to the right.\n\n52\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.380\nIn this case it is Cmd+U.\n\n53\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.970\nSo, instead of coming to this\nall the time, I could do Cmd+U.\n\n54\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.860\nDo you have to?\n\n55\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.300\nNo, but generally,\nif you make a lot of subclips,\n\n56\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.438\nthen put that in your lexicon\nof things that you're gonna use.\n\n57\n00:03:10.438 --> 00:03:14.210\nAnd in Cmd+U, it's like saying I\ncommand you to make a subclip.\n\n58\n00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.024\nSo I'll do Cmd+U.\n\n59\n00:03:16.024 --> 00:03:16.677\n>> It's a nice pneumonic.\n\n60\n00:03:16.677 --> 00:03:17.610\n>> I know, do you like that?\n\n61\n00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.700\nI very rarely do I have a good one,\nthat's my only good one.\n\n62\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.160\nAnd they'll say make subclip,\nwould you like to rename this?\n\n63\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.346\nAnd I will say yes,\nthis is the hummingbird,\n\n64\n00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:33.590\nhummberbird, yeah, okay,\nI didn't get in this for the spelling.\n\n65\n00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.050\nHummingbird feeder, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.300\nNow it says restrict trims\nto subclip boundaries.\n\n67\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.980\nWhen we get into trimming\nI'll explain what this means.\n\n68\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.035\nEven if it's on now,\nyou can blow it out later.\n\n69\n00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:49.114\nOkay, you can say, aw, man,\nI didn't wanna do that.\n\n70\n00:03:49.114 --> 00:03:51.870\nAdobe always gives you that out.\n\n71\n00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.360\nSo, we'll click OK and\nthen come back to my project window,\n\n72\n00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.050\nboom, and it went right there,\nokay, right there in that area.\n\n73\n00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.550\nOkay, let me scroll up.\n\n74\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.200\nIt's in the same bin that I had before.\n\n75\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.720\nAnd it's just, if I click this,\nit's just the hummingbird feeder.\n\n76\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.340\nIt's nothing else.\n\n77\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.760\n>> Now, this is really nice because I can\njust shoot a continuous piece of footage\n\n78\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.080\nand not worry about so much, okay,\nnow's the perfect shot, start now.\n\n79\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.990\nI could just start shooting and\nwhen the time happens, it happens.\n\n80\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.540\nI let it go after, we come back in here,\nwe make a subclip out of it,\n\n81\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.590\nand we're ready to roll.\n\n82\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.370\n>> And I can break it up.\n\n83\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.077\nAnd what I did just to save some\ntime is I made a subclips bin and\n\n84\n00:04:35.077 --> 00:04:36.551\nI broke up everything.\n\n85\n00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:37.425\nAnd I named them.\n\n86\n00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:39.226\nAnd then there's like okay,\nthere's the BananaPlant.\n\n87\n00:04:39.226 --> 00:04:42.670\nThere's the Bamboo, there's the Frog,\nthere's the BirdFeeder.\n\n88\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.580\nAll of that, the SprinklerFlower.\n\n89\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.310\nAll of it, I just made all those subclips.\n\n90\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.320\nSo I took these long clips and\ncut them into subclips.\n\n91\n00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.870\nAnd I consider that a form of trimming,\nand you can do that at the beginning.\n\n92\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.290\nNow, rearranging or moving,\nI'm going back to my photo montage here.\n\n93\n00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.110\nAnd I'm going to bring this up,\nthere's all my photos, okay.\n\n94\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.730\nI'm not going to worry about\nthe markers right now.\n\n95\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.610\nI'm not going to worry about the markers,\nbut let's say, these are out of order.\n\n96\n00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.080\nLike this one came first,\nthen that one, then that one.\n\n97\n00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.480\nI'm like, no, I actually wanted\nthat one to come next, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.090\nIt's like, I wanted this one here.\n\n99\n00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.100\nSo let me just do a general drag.\n\n100\n00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.780\nTechnically I say click, I should be able\nto just drag that right there, right?\n\n101\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.710\nWell, look at the little icon.\n\n102\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.040\nLet me zoom in there a little bit for you.\n\n103\n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.220\nLook at the little icon, ignore that one.\n\n104\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.550\nThat means overwrite.\n\n105\n00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.890\nSo if I just let go, that's an overwrite\nand there's a gap right there.\n\n106\n00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.200\nIt lifted it out and\nmoved it there, not what I wanted.\n\n107\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.310\nSo you can say, ah-ha,\nwhat about an insert?\n\n108\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.390\nIf I click this and move it over, okay,\nand I've got snapping on which helps.\n\n109\n00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.537\nAnd then I'll say, I remember that\nif I hold down command it switches.\n\n110\n00:06:03.537 --> 00:06:05.106\nAgh!\n\n111\n00:06:05.106 --> 00:06:08.767\nThen I do this, let go, whoopsy doodle.\n\n112\n00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:10.000\nThat didn't work.\n\n113\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.380\n>> And it's like, what just happened?\n\n114\n00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.700\nWell, since it's considering it an insert,\nokay,\n\n115\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.410\nthere's the overwrite, boom,\nmove, hold down command, insert.\n\n116\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.050\nIt's like, look, I'm inserting across\neverything that you have highlighted here.\n\n117\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.490\nAnd it left a gap as well.\n\n118\n00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.220\nWell, I'm just moving stuff,\nso I don't necessarily wanna\n\n119\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.240\nturn a lot of stuff back on,\nturn a lot of stuff back off, so\n\n120\n00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.460\nthis is one of the only times where you\nmay have to do some keyboard gymnastics.\n\n121\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.450\nSo here's what you do,\nI wanna switch these two.\n\n122\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.050\nI'll zoom in just a little more for you.\n\n123\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.239\nI'm gonna grab this, and\nI'm going to move it.\n\n124\n00:06:53.239 --> 00:06:57.130\nIf I don't hold a modifier key,\nthat's an overwrite.\n\n125\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.760\nIf I hold down my Command key,\nthat's an insert.\n\n126\n00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.240\nIf I hold down the option\n\n127\n00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.590\nkey as well, I get this,\nand it's like, what's that?\n\n128\n00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.220\nThis basically means\nrearrange these two clips.\n\n129\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.130\nThat's why it has the little twisty on it.\n\n130\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.960\nSo now I'm gonna let go of the mouse.\n\n131\n00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.960\nI'm gonna keep a hold of Option and\n\n132\n00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.440\nCommand, let go of the mouse,\nboom, and now they've swapped.\n\n133\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.290\n>> And it didn't do anything\nto the audio track as well.\n\n134\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.180\n>> Nope, the audio is fine.\n\n135\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.700\nIt knows that basically\nthis is just a swap.\n\n136\n00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.820\nAnd I don't have to do it with just one,\n\n137\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.640\nlet's say okay,\nthese two should be over there.\n\n138\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.250\nClick, drag, Option Cmd,\nlet go of mouse, those two have swapped.\n\n139\n00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.632\n>> That is magical.\n\n140\n00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:51.213\n>> This is one of those things to\npractice, and really get those hot keys\n\n141\n00:07:51.213 --> 00:07:55.491\ndown, because it could be one of those\nthings like, these shots are out of order.\n\n142\n00:07:55.491 --> 00:08:00.170\nAnd it's really much,\nmuch easier to just move them that way.\n\n143\n00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.323\n>> I was about to say there.\n\n144\n00:08:01.323 --> 00:08:02.032\n>> Yeah.\n>> I assume,\n\n145\n00:08:02.032 --> 00:08:04.566\nthere's a way you can do\nthis through commands--\n\n146\n00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:06.227\n>> Yeah, you can turn tracks off.\n\n147\n00:08:06.227 --> 00:08:08.202\n>> Yeah.\n>> And do this and then move things, but\n\n148\n00:08:08.202 --> 00:08:10.715\nI want to work as fast as I\nwant to tell the story inside,\n\n149\n00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:13.410\nI just need these there,\nthere they are, boom, off I go.\n\n150\n00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.350\n>> Yeah, that way is going around\nyour elbow to get your back.\n\n151\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.340\n>> I, wow, I like that.\n\n152\n00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.040\nCould I steal that?\n\n153\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.690\n>> Yes, go for it.\n\n154\n00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.360\n>> Excellent, you saw it here first.\n\n155\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.720\nOkay, so now I'm going to go\nback to my garden sequence.\n\n156\n00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.380\nStretch this out.\n\n157\n00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.370\nWe're going to talk a little\nbit about trimming.\n\n158\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.700\nNow the trimming is,\nit's interesting, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.228\nA lot of people don't get it, so\nthey avoid it, and I don't blame them.\n\n160\n00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:42.930\nIf you've never worked with film before,\ntrimming can be really,\n\n161\n00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.550\nit could really mess with your head.\n\n162\n00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.550\nIt's not that hard.\n\n163\n00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.580\nLet me see if I can try and\nget it down for you.\n\n164\n00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.890\nOne of the ways that people like to\nessentially get rid of footage in here,\n\n165\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.320\nlet me go ahead and play.\n\n166\n00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.360\nI'm going to hit L.\n\n167\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.910\n>> Hi, I'm Jim Bill, and I'm currently\ntraining you right now on Adobe Premier\n\n168\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.820\nand-\n>> There's that breath right there.\n\n169\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.840\nThere's a breath right at that point.\n\n170\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.110\nNow, how do I get rid of that?\n\n171\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.880\nMost people, yeah,\nyou could get the blade tool.\n\n172\n00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.420\nYou could get the blade tool, the razor.\n\n173\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.600\nMake a cut, select it and cut it.\n\n174\n00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.050\nJust about everybody knows how to do that.\n\n175\n00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.800\nIt's fairly easy.\n\n176\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.200\nYou take your mouse, do it, cut it,\ngo back to the select tool, click.\n\n177\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.230\nLet's explore some different ways\nto quote unquote, trim this,\n\n178\n00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.020\nbefore I get into the trimming tool.\n\n179\n00:09:38.238 --> 00:09:42.280\nI'm going to make sure A1 and\nA2 are on so this reacts.\n\n180\n00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.449\nI could hit endpoint.\n\n181\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.700\nUse the right arrow, go forward,\nand then an out point.\n\n182\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:54.210\nAnd what I've done is I've\nmarked this region, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.860\nNow, you can do the hotkeys for\n\n184\n00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.690\nthis, or I can say, this is a sequence\ncommand and there are two of them.\n\n185\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.530\nA lift and an extract.\n\n186\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.700\nA lift is semi colon, extract is accent.\n\n187\n00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:17.540\nIf I do a lift, notice it filled it in\nwith a gap, not really what I wanted.\n\n188\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.950\nBut with that inpoint and\noutpoint there, I could say, hey.\n\n189\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.810\nLet's try an extraction.\n\n190\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.850\nOkay, boom.\n\n191\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.890\nNow it's been extracted and\nit's closed the gap.\n\n192\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.210\nOkay, it has absolutely closed the gap.\n\n193\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.440\nSo, that is one way of doing that.\n\n194\n00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.350\nWhat if you want to save yourself a step?\n\n195\n00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.690\nYou can absolutely save yourself a step.\n\n196\n00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:51.650\nThis was something they added recently,\nand it is pretty great, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:57.765\nCan I do this in one step\nwithout having to add endpoints,\n\n198\n00:10:57.765 --> 00:11:00.015\noutpoints, do all that, knock wood.\n\n199\n00:11:00.015 --> 00:11:01.875\nSo, watch this.\n\n200\n00:11:03.065 --> 00:11:04.835\nOccasionally, why do I want to do this?\n\n201\n00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:08.285\nMaybe I want to remove something\nfrom the middle, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:10.300\nIf I want to remove something\nfrom the middle, then yes.\n\n203\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.690\nSomething like an extraction's good.\n\n204\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:16.070\nI want to take that out,\ndo an extract, boom, there.\n\n205\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.550\nBut what if the boundary is\nthe beginnings of the actual edit?\n\n206\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.590\nOkay, the edit points here and here.\n\n207\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.530\nWell, I'm going to option the IO and\nget rid of those.\n\n208\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.280\nI'm going to come back to this, and\n\n209\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.030\nI know a lot of people find\nthis really mind blowing.\n\n210\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.867\nSo, come back to the front,\n[SOUND] I love that little thing when\n\n211\n00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:41.538\nsometimes you zoom in and\nit leaves the trails.\n\n212\n00:11:41.538 --> 00:11:43.100\nI absolutely love that.\n\n213\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.870\nThat's not a glitch in Adobe,\nthat's when you zoom in too much.\n\n214\n00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.470\nYou will occasionally get that.\n\n215\n00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.492\nSo now, I did this before by just\nextracting out, and I added in point,\n\n216\n00:11:51.492 --> 00:11:54.523\nout point, and all that,\nI think I'll just do that.\n\n217\n00:11:56.289 --> 00:12:01.809\nAnd some people go, [NOISE] Basically,\n\n218\n00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:07.804\nif I put the playhead where I want it,\nconsider this sort of the beginning,\n\n219\n00:12:07.804 --> 00:12:12.670\nconsider this the end of the clip,\nor the in or the out point.\n\n220\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:19.730\nAnd basically, I'm looking at my keyboard,\nand there are two buttons, q and w.\n\n221\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.370\nQ is the front.\n\n222\n00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.660\nW is the back, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.880\nSo, if I want to get rid of, okay,\n\n224\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:31.810\njust remove from this edit\nto the play head, that is q.\n\n225\n00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.460\nAnd I've done it in one step, okay?\n\n226\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.970\nNow, I move over here, I can do\nthe same thing to this ending edit,\n\n227\n00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.188\nI'm just going to move my play head there,\nwe'll tap L a bunch of times, boom.\n\n228\n00:12:45.188 --> 00:12:47.607\nGo back.\n\n229\n00:12:47.607 --> 00:12:50.420\nAll right?\n\n230\n00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.788\nNow, from the play head to the end,\nI want to to what's technically,\n\n231\n00:12:54.788 --> 00:12:58.802\nit's a form of extraction, but\nwe also call it a ripple delete.\n\n232\n00:12:58.802 --> 00:13:00.194\nW.\n\n233\n00:13:00.194 --> 00:13:01.940\nGone.\n\n234\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.208\nGo forward a little bit.\n\n235\n00:13:05.208 --> 00:13:06.396\nQ.\n\n236\n00:13:06.396 --> 00:13:10.270\nGone.\nSo this Is a form of trimming.\n\n237\n00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.420\nAnd a lot of people, once they see this\nis like, I'm going to use this forever.\n\n238\n00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.183\nAnd you know, yeah, they do.\n\n239\n00:13:15.183 --> 00:13:18.867\n>> Our switcher was like,\nyou have just blown my mind.\n\n240\n00:13:18.867 --> 00:13:21.100\n>> I know.\nI think he actually as we say in,\n\n241\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.796\nhe threw his cans and was like dude.\n\n242\n00:13:23.796 --> 00:13:27.060\n>> We should put a disclaimer here that\nyou should wear a helmet while watching\n\n243\n00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.133\nthis episode because--\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:28.924\n>> It might blow your mind.\n\n245\n00:13:28.924 --> 00:13:30.670\n[LAUGH]\n>> It might do that.\n\n246\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.140\nIt absolutely might do that.\n\n247\n00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.022\nSo now I can do the cool things,\n\n248\n00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:38.760\noption K to go back to the beginning and\nplay just from front to back.\n\n249\n00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.410\nAnd the reason why I'm shooting today is,\none, it's a beautiful day.\n\n250\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.530\nI haven't seen my backyard in about\na month because I've been on vacation, and\n\n251\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.320\nwe're looking to change it.\n\n252\n00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.880\nA lot of ands in there.\n\n253\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.750\n>> You and your ands.\n\n254\n00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.300\n>> I got a lot of ands in there,\nso this is sometimes where Q and\n\n255\n00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.960\nW don't get the job done enough.\n\n256\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.630\n>> You really want to get in there and\n\n257\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:04.220\nget as detailed as possible and\nbring that out.\n\n258\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.440\nSo I can do this, if I want to,\nI can do it with the mouse.\n\n259\n00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.450\nI have a variety of trim tools\navailable to me over here.\n\n260\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.210\nOkay.\n\n261\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.380\nI have rolling edit tool and\nhave rippling edit tool.\n\n262\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.003\nUsually when people first get started,\n\n263\n00:14:22.003 --> 00:14:25.800\nthey are absolutely petrified\nof the ripple edit tool.\n\n264\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:31.010\nBecause you can throw your audio and your\nvideo out of sync if you're not careful.\n\n265\n00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:36.380\nMy general rule with them is if I'm\nusing a ripple tool trim, I'm cutting or\n\n266\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.490\nediting both the audio and the video.\n\n267\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.990\nThat's my general rule of thumb, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.100\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nactivate that tool.\n\n269\n00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.940\nOkay, my mouse is now that tool.\n\n270\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.230\nZoom back out.\n\n271\n00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.850\nWe'll make this,\nwe'll make this big, okay?\n\n272\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.270\nI'm going to do the thing.\n\n273\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.880\nZoom in there for you.\n\n274\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.020\nAnd say all right, so the essential\nproblem is I have an and problem.\n\n275\n00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.948\nI've known this all my life, and\n\n276\n00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:12.837\nas I'm doing it right now,\nI just want to be like,\n\n277\n00:15:12.837 --> 00:15:18.025\nokay, I'm going to kind\nof just move this up\n\n278\n00:15:18.025 --> 00:15:23.960\na bit And it highlights the entire thing.\n\n279\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.720\nBut what I am essentially doing is I just\nwant to get rid of some of these frames,\n\n280\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.290\nor if you think of this as the in point\nthat I set, and not the out point of that,\n\n281\n00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.390\nI'm moving my outpoint, or\ninpoint out a little further in.\n\n282\n00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.050\nLet go.\n\n283\n00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.680\nBecause it's a ripple trend,\nit closes the gap.\n\n284\n00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.401\nNow I can do shift K.\n\n285\n00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.978\nI haven't seen my backyard in about\na month because I've been on vacation.\n\n286\n00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.085\nWe're looking to change it.\n\n287\n00:15:48.085 --> 00:15:49.940\nAnd it's, I'm getting close.\n\n288\n00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.727\nOne of the problems is I have snapping on.\n\n289\n00:15:52.727 --> 00:15:57.312\nIf I take snapping off,\nI can get a little more,\n\n290\n00:15:57.312 --> 00:16:03.630\nI can kind of get in there and\nit won't keep trying to find an edit.\n\n291\n00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.171\nI can go in the opposite direction.\n\n292\n00:16:05.171 --> 00:16:08.712\nNotice up in the window\nthat is the program,\n\n293\n00:16:08.712 --> 00:16:12.733\nit's showing me how many\nframes I'm going back or\n\n294\n00:16:12.733 --> 00:16:17.610\ngoing forward as a bit of a guide,\nAll right,\n\n295\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:22.640\nand the reason we say ripple it's because\nit either makes it longer or shorter.\n\n296\n00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.910\nIt's making the entire sequence longer or\nshorter, that is why it is a ripple, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:34.660\nNow right now, it is also yellow,\nso that denotes it is a ripple.\n\n298\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.420\nBecause there's an overwrite trim as well.\n\n299\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.920\nNo kidding, there's an overwrite trim.\n\n300\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.437\nI'm going to do Shift+K,\nand I'm still like,\n\n301\n00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:47.962\nthis is really hard,\nthis is really upsetting.\n\n302\n00:16:47.962 --> 00:16:50.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n303\n00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.330\nmaybe I need something\na bit more detailed.\n\n304\n00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.580\nI do have the ability\nto use a trimming tool,\n\n305\n00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.260\nso first thing is how do I find that?\n\n306\n00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.950\nOccasionally people just\nbe like I don't know.\n\n307\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.330\nBut if I go into search and\ngo trim, it'll say aha trim edit.\n\n308\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.480\nIt's the letter t, boom.\n\n309\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.860\nThis is the trimming tool,\nright here, okay?\n\n310\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:22.100\nAnd it allows me to work with\ngreat detail on trimming,\n\n311\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:27.600\nso down at the bottom, you will notice,\n\n312\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.140\nit says trim forward,\ntrim backward by one frames, five frames.\n\n313\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.580\nIt will keep a count.\n\n314\n00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.350\nIt will also say,\n\n315\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:38.580\nhey, after you've made that trim, would\nyou like to apply a default transition?\n\n316\n00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.279\nWhy, yes, I would.\n\n317\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.230\nI can also change which side I work with.\n\n318\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.990\nI can work with this side,\nsometimes called the outgoing side.\n\n319\n00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.810\nWe mostly just call it the b side.\n\n320\n00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.420\nOkay, this moment we're at the a side.\n\n321\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.280\nI'm sorry, that's a side, that's b side.\n\n322\n00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.860\nThis is the outgoing,\nthis is coming from its end point.\n\n323\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.160\nNow, instead of dragging, I can do this.\n\n324\n00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.222\nI can either do option right,\nor I can say,\n\n325\n00:18:04.222 --> 00:18:08.722\nokay, go a frame, a frame, a frame,\n\n326\n00:18:08.722 --> 00:18:13.381\na frame, a frame, [SOUND], all right.\n\n327\n00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:17.030\nNow, if I hit space bar,\nit will automatically loop.\n\n328\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.540\nYard in about a month because\nI've been on vacation, change it.\n\n329\n00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.770\nWe're looking to.\n\n330\n00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.976\nOkay, a little too close.\n\n331\n00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:24.063\nGo back.\n\n332\n00:18:26.948 --> 00:18:30.152\nI haven't seen my backyard in about\na month because I've been on vacation to\n\n333\n00:18:30.152 --> 00:18:30.660\nchange it.\n\n334\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.370\nOkay, let me go back two frames.\n\n335\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:37.401\nI haven't seen my back yard in about\na month, because I've been on vacation.\n\n336\n00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:38.920\nTo change it?\n\n337\n00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.560\nOkay, one frame.\n\n338\n00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.014\nWe're gonna go one frame back, boom.\n\n339\n00:18:42.014 --> 00:18:44.910\n>> I haven't seen my back yard in about\na month, because I've been on vacation.\n\n340\n00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.830\nTo change it?\n\n341\n00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.850\nWe're looking.\n\n342\n00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.340\nAnd I can really kinda get in there.\n\n343\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.170\nI may wanna do a little audio crossfade.\n\n344\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:57.530\nBut I can get in there and really tighten\nup the edit between these two items.\n\n345\n00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.710\nThat is what the trim\ntool allows me to do, and\n\n346\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.150\nI can say I'm gonna trim this,\nI'm gonna trim that.\n\n347\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.810\nOr, I can do what's called a rolling edit.\n\n348\n00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:11.044\nNow a rolling edit will affect\nboth sides at the same time.\n\n349\n00:19:11.044 --> 00:19:13.050\nIt will effect both\nsides as the same time.\n\n350\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.900\nYou can do this in audio or video.\n\n351\n00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:23.050\nWe sometimes call them J or L cuts, like\naudio leading video, video leading audio.\n\n352\n00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.557\nI'll give you a terrible example of this,\nDan.\n\n353\n00:19:25.557 --> 00:19:28.746\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you have a conversation,\n\n354\n00:19:28.746 --> 00:19:31.520\nI don't have another person\nto cut to aside from myself.\n\n355\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.720\nI'm gonna come down here and\ndeselect everything, okay.\n\n356\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.530\nI'm just gonna click somewhere and\ndeselect that.\n\n357\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:46.960\nI'm gonna take out A1 and A1 and\ndo the trim tool again, T.\n\n358\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.780\nNow it only grabs the video\nbecause that's what it saw.\n\n359\n00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.680\nNothing else is highlighted so\nthat's what it saw.\n\n360\n00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.980\nNow if I start trimming\nlet me just go back five.\n\n361\n00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.025\nOkay, notice down here I'm\ngonna zoom in just real quick.\n\n362\n00:20:05.025 --> 00:20:10.719\n[SOUND] My audio edit is right there.\n\n363\n00:20:10.719 --> 00:20:12.929\nMy video edit got moved back here.\n\n364\n00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.822\nOkay, so what happens is this\naudio will keep going but\n\n365\n00:20:18.822 --> 00:20:24.810\nit will cut to my video in the next shot.\n\n366\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.749\nOccasionally this is how\nwe smooth out dialog.\n\n367\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.500\nIs when the video edit and\nthe audio edit don't hit at the same time.\n\n368\n00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.140\nLet me play it for you and\nyou'll see how weird it is.\n\n369\n00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.700\nToday is, one, it's a beautiful day.\n\n370\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.413\nI haven't seen my backyard in about\na month because I've been on vacation.\n\n371\n00:20:39.413 --> 00:20:40.305\nWho changed it?\n\n372\n00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:42.555\nOkay, so it's like.\n\n373\n00:20:42.555 --> 00:20:45.273\nBackyard in about a month because\nI've been on vacation, who [SOUND].\n\n374\n00:20:45.273 --> 00:20:50.518\nSo I could technically maybe throw\nin one of the cool transitions that\n\n375\n00:20:50.518 --> 00:20:55.856\nI'm gonna show you in effects to make\nit look like I'm actually saying\n\n376\n00:20:55.856 --> 00:21:01.479\nthat line under my turn, instead of\nthe audio you really couldn't hear.\n\n377\n00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:04.079\nYou're an editor,\nyou're kind of a magician, and\n\n378\n00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:06.760\nyou're making people think that.\n\n379\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.590\nNow this edit is red because\nit is a rolling edit, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.030\nIt's a rolling edit, and technically,\n\n381\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.930\ntechnically unless I put the A8 trim\nall the way at the end of the timeline,\n\n382\n00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.830\nit doesn't make the timeline longer or\nshorter, okay?\n\n383\n00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.820\nTechnically that's the thing.\n\n384\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.880\nIf I dump out of the trim tool here, I'm\ngonna hit T since I looked on there and\n\n385\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.270\nI noticed, okay,\nI noticed that T was the hot key.\n\n386\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.282\nIt was pretty cool.\n\n387\n00:21:33.282 --> 00:21:33.930\n>> For trim.\n\n388\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.510\n>> Yeah it was pretty cool.\n\n389\n00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.455\nWell you never know sometimes,\nI mean, there's other logic.\n\n390\n00:21:40.455 --> 00:21:43.604\nUh-oh, I have a serious\nerror that has occurred.\n\n391\n00:21:43.604 --> 00:21:46.830\nI've blown it up,\noccasionally that happens.\n\n392\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:52.650\nI've done that before, so many times,\njust because maybe I'm asking\n\n393\n00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.650\nit to do a little too much for the power\nof the computer that I'm working on, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.120\nYep, I could say that.\n\n395\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.624\nI could say ignore that.\n\n396\n00:21:59.624 --> 00:22:01.270\n[INAUDIBLE] previous session.\n\n397\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.990\nDo I wanna open it?\n\n398\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.450\nYep, okay.\n\n399\n00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.410\nBeing opened is a recovery project.\n\n400\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.810\nSo yeah, it's like we will try our\nbest to open this project, but\n\n401\n00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:10.720\nwe can make no guarantees.\n\n402\n00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.700\nPlease save this project to a new file.\n\n403\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.230\nSo it's gonna be a recovery,\nand they're gonna say hey,\n\n404\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:24.970\nwe're doing this because we're not sure\nif the other one is okay, so to speak.\n\n405\n00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:30.160\nSo this is a recovery project,\nand notice, how do I know that?\n\n406\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.470\nWe addressed several lessons earlier, aha.\n\n407\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.720\nCopy of.\n\n408\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.624\n>> It's not the original.\n\n409\n00:22:37.624 --> 00:22:39.390\n>> Great, it's not the original.\n\n410\n00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:44.510\nThat's okay, I'll go ahead and work in\nthis recovery like hey look's fine to me.\n\n411\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.640\n>> I'm assuming now if this\nis all fine and dandy and\n\n412\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.890\nyou're like okay everything looks good.\n\n413\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.546\nYou can just override the copy and\nthen you don't have to.\n\n414\n00:22:52.546 --> 00:22:53.598\n>> It's like why even worry about it?\n\n415\n00:22:53.598 --> 00:22:57.010\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's kind of like thank you, Adobe.\n\n416\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.620\nYou know how I do really\nstupid things sometimes.\n\n417\n00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.740\nThank you very much.\n\n418\n00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.360\n>> You know me.\n\n419\n00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.030\n>> You know me.\n\n420\n00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.600\nYou get me, man.\n\n421\n00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.180\nSo, here's a little trick.\n\n422\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:10.290\nWe can do the ripple delete, but\nlet's say I want to do the ripple Edit.\n\n423\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.770\nI want to do it just in video.\n\n424\n00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.540\nLet me zoom in real quick on this, okay?\n\n425\n00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.210\nLet me do the tilde key, zoom in, and say,\n\n426\n00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:25.400\nhey if I do a roller, okay, if I do\nthat rolling edit, nothing happened.\n\n427\n00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.980\nBut if I do this, and it's grabbing both.\n\n428\n00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.710\nWhy is it grabbing both?\n\n429\n00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.735\nBecause I have linking on.\n\n430\n00:23:31.735 --> 00:23:32.849\nLet me taking linking off.\n\n431\n00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.840\nNow it's just grabbing this one.\n\n432\n00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.720\nAnd if I move it,\n\n433\n00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.850\nit's telling me I'm not doing that because\ntechnically it's gonna cause an error.\n\n434\n00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:44.880\nCan I do this one?\n\n435\n00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.750\nNo, the trim is blocked because\nyou're gonna throw it out of sync.\n\n436\n00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:53.602\nIt gives you that warning.\n\n437\n00:23:53.602 --> 00:24:00.858\nIf I hold down the Cmd key and\nthen tap it, it turns red.\n\n438\n00:24:00.858 --> 00:24:03.927\nNow hold it down, trim it on one side and\n\n439\n00:24:03.927 --> 00:24:08.982\nthen you get an overwrite, and\nI can just overwrite on one side.\n\n440\n00:24:08.982 --> 00:24:12.535\nCuz somebody'll say,\nhey maybe I don't wanna roll it,\n\n441\n00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:17.645\nI don't wanna effect both sides,\nI want to just effect the video.\n\n442\n00:24:17.645 --> 00:24:22.625\nDon't wanna throw it out of sync,\nhate seeing that error, what do I do?\n\n443\n00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:27.730\nHold down the Cmd key, and\ninstead what you get, essentially is\n\n444\n00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:37.240\na form of rolling edit but\njust in video or audio.\n\n445\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.740\nAnd it's leaving a gap.\n\n446\n00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.990\nAnd then you can fill it in later,\nyou can adjust it later and you can say,\n\n447\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:47.700\nokay I'm gonna have to deal with this\nlater, right now this is just what I want.\n\n448\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.960\nThis is just absolutely what I want.\n\n449\n00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.249\nLast thing, which is interesting.\n\n450\n00:24:59.994 --> 00:25:04.900\nIf I activate a rolling trim,\nI'm gonna do that real quick.\n\n451\n00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.200\nI'm gonna go back,\nactivate just a rolling trim.\n\n452\n00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.260\nPop it right there.\n\n453\n00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.220\nAnd occasionally you get this from folks.\n\n454\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:21.630\nThey'll say hey, can't you just, without\ngoing into the trim tool, because like\n\n455\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:27.510\nI said the trim tool weirds people out,\ncan't you just trim that over to there?\n\n456\n00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.180\n>> It would seem reasonable.\n\n457\n00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.560\n>> It's like, can't you just do that?\n\n458\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.720\nWell, with the rolling trim activated,\nI can say yes.\n\n459\n00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:42.270\nI can letter e, extend it, over there,\nand I'll extend it over there.\n\n460\n00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.530\nSo that's an extend edit.\n\n461\n00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:48.305\nBecause sometimes people will like,\nI know I want it right there.\n\n462\n00:25:48.305 --> 00:25:51.355\nCan, if I adjust the rolling edits,\nI'll just roll it right over there.\n\n463\n00:25:51.355 --> 00:25:53.115\nYes, I can.\n\n464\n00:25:53.115 --> 00:26:01.645\nBut then there's other stuff that\nAdobe added that's just so much fun.\n\n465\n00:26:01.645 --> 00:26:05.155\nLet me go back real quick, and\nthis is gonna finish this up.\n\n466\n00:26:05.155 --> 00:26:06.395\nThis is like a lot.\n\n467\n00:26:06.395 --> 00:26:08.900\nTrimming does a lot, because this\nis where you get a lot of detail.\n\n468\n00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.820\nAnd you know when you start getting\ninto tools that do a lot of detail,\n\n469\n00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.580\nthere's a lot of buttons,\nand a lot of switches.\n\n470\n00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.290\nSo, let's take a look at this.\n\n471\n00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.795\nRemember if I did w,\nit would just make it go away\n\n472\n00:26:24.795 --> 00:26:25.746\n>> We like the w.\n\n473\n00:26:25.746 --> 00:26:30.957\n>> We like the w, but,\nwhat if I add a modifier to it, so\n\n474\n00:26:30.957 --> 00:26:37.723\nif I had an option w, that is like a lift,\nit lifts it out from there.\n\n475\n00:26:37.723 --> 00:26:42.228\nAnd again, this is track specific\nI only have video selected,\n\n476\n00:26:42.228 --> 00:26:45.710\nI don't have the audio on the right side.\n\n477\n00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:50.650\nIf I do Shift + w, it technically,\nit just did an extend.\n\n478\n00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.820\nIt just did the exact same\nthing without having to have.\n\n479\n00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:00.065\n>> That seemed to be a whole lot\neasier than the way we did before.\n\n480\n00:27:00.065 --> 00:27:03.998\n>> Well if you're in the trim tool,\nif you're already in the trimming tool and\n\n481\n00:27:03.998 --> 00:27:07.322\nyou moved the play head,\nyou just say ha, let me extend it over.\n\n482\n00:27:07.322 --> 00:27:08.200\nIt's like Boom.\n\n483\n00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.590\nI don't have to go back and roll it down,\nI can just say let me just extend it.\n\n484\n00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:17.263\nAnd if you're using the trim tool, the\nextend is a great option, if you're not,\n\n485\n00:27:17.263 --> 00:27:20.540\nShift + w will do the exact\nsame thing as an extend.\n\n486\n00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.800\nAnd, again, it is track specific.\n\n487\n00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.100\nSo, I only had video on and\nit only did the track.\n\n488\n00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.420\nTrimming takes a lot of practice.\n\n489\n00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.990\nBut it gets you used to a lot of\nthe things that you can do in the timeline\n\n490\n00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.590\nvery fine, very minute.\n\n491\n00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:42.620\nMy suggestion, create a sequence,\nI have one that it's called garbage.\n\n492\n00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.630\nAnd what I do is I go through lessons say,\n\n493\n00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.100\nokay he just did this,\nwhat if I do this, what if I do that?\n\n494\n00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.590\nAnd just play along with it and\nthen realize, I can tighten this up.\n\n495\n00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.970\nI can do this, let me try removal,\nlet me try this.\n\n496\n00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.830\nAnd then, boom, you're happy.\n\n497\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.700\nYou are a happy, happy person by\njust going in there, punching and\n\n498\n00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.410\npecking, having a great old time.\n\n499\n00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:04.170\n>> And\nthis really seems to be the meat and\n\n500\n00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.780\npotatoes of what you're gonna be doing\nin any kind of premier work, right?\n\n501\n00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:13.200\nYou're gonna be saying, I have to make\nthis fit together, and if I can't trim it,\n\n502\n00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.880\nor extend it, or do whatever I need to do,\nif I don't know how to do those things,\n\n503\n00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.770\nit's gonna look choppy.\n\n504\n00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:21.240\n>> It's gonna take you more time, because\nwhat I know a lot of people do is, and\n\n505\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:26.430\nthis is interesting when I match framed\nearlier, okay, let me stretch this back.\n\n506\n00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:31.660\nWhen I matched frame earlier, okay,\nand this is important to note.\n\n507\n00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:36.550\nI hit f, what it's telling me up\nin the source, when it loaded it,\n\n508\n00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:41.250\nwas it said, hey this is the source,\nthe merged clip,\n\n509\n00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.070\nyou're looking at that now, that's what\nI loaded for you in the source monitor.\n\n510\n00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.720\nMost people do this, they double-click.\n\n511\n00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.420\nLet me go back to the selection too, which\nis also the v key, double-click this,\n\n512\n00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:59.750\nand they don't realize this,\nthey're saying okay, just to let you know,\n\n513\n00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:08.500\nyou are actually now working with the\nsegment that is in Garden_Sequence_01 So\n\n514\n00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:14.650\nif I do this, pick up this outpoint\n\n515\n00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:19.620\nand move it, it has now affected\nwhat's in the sequence.\n\n516\n00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.440\nI know a lot of people do that.\n\n517\n00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.250\nThey're like yeah that's what I'm gonna\ndo, I'm gonna do that and manipulate this.\n\n518\n00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.460\nYou might not get\nthe detail that you want.\n\n519\n00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.190\nYou absolutely might not get\nthe detail that you want to use.\n\n520\n00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.320\nThere is one method where doing this,\na lot\n\n521\n00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.850\nof people feel a lot more comfortable\nthat I'll come to in another lesson.\n\n522\n00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:44.130\nWhat I'd like everybody to do is to play\naround with all of this basic trimming and\n\n523\n00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.370\nhave fun with it.\n\n524\n00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:50.450\nAnd notice, you'll find some\nhotkeys in there if you just hover\n\n525\n00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:55.750\nover into things, like if I came into\nhere, one last thing real quick.\n\n526\n00:29:55.750 --> 00:30:00.300\nIf you wanna be like,\nthe super commander of the trim tool.\n\n527\n00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.380\nI know a lot of people like to do that.\n\n528\n00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:08.130\nI'll hit t, now, real quick,\nI'm gonna speed through this,\n\n529\n00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:12.100\nso that way you can show your friends and\nthey'll be like really cool about it.\n\n530\n00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.690\nSo, the blue line means\nI'm trimming both sides.\n\n531\n00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.540\nIf I hold down Ctrl and\n\n532\n00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:22.240\nthen hit t, hey I'm doing that side, now\nI'm doing that side, now I'm doing both.\n\n533\n00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.250\nI go through the five stages, so to speak.\n\n534\n00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:28.910\nIf I look at it down here,\nit's like hey, that's red.\n\n535\n00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:33.900\nControl + t, there's a ripple trim on that\nside, there's a ripple trim on that side.\n\n536\n00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.190\nWow, there's an overwrite trim there,\noverwrite trim there.\n\n537\n00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:38.160\nNow we're back to rolling.\n\n538\n00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.174\nI'm just holding down Ctrl and\ndoing t, like that.\n\n539\n00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:46.836\nNow, if I do things like\nOption + left-arrow,\n\n540\n00:30:46.836 --> 00:30:50.880\nthat's trimming with my keyboard.\n\n541\n00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.491\nIf I do the Option + right-arrow and\nall that,\n\n542\n00:30:53.491 --> 00:30:57.230\nif I had Shift + Option,\nI'm going five forward.\n\n543\n00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:02.490\nAnd I'm doing this all with the keyboard,\nand a lot of people really dig that.\n\n544\n00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:08.420\nSo you can dig in there and do the whole,\nboom, Ctrl + t goes through all of it.\n\n545\n00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.290\nHave a great time with it, and\nsometimes the more you feel\n\n546\n00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.300\nconfident in how you control it, the more\nyou feel confident in doing your story.\n\n547\n00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.770\n>> Wow, Jim, this is great stuff.\n\n548\n00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.170\nI hate to do this, but\nwe're running out of time,\n\n549\n00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.160\nand I'm just like,\nthis is great, this is awesome.\n\n550\n00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.844\nI'm gonna go play with this stuff\n[LAUGH] as soon as humanly possible,\n\n551\n00:31:25.844 --> 00:31:28.576\nwhich I guess is now because\nwe have to end our show.\n\n552\n00:31:28.576 --> 00:31:31.860\nBut the good news is,\nJim will be back with more shows.\n\n553\n00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.840\nSo I'm really looking forward to\nseeing what he's got lined up for\n\n554\n00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.290\nus in the upcoming episodes.\n\n555\n00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:37.170\nJim, thank you so much.\n\n556\n00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:37.950\n>> No problem, man.\nGlad to be here.\n\n557\n00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.950\n>> For showing us how to use\nPremiere a little better than we\n\n558\n00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.990\nprobably already know how to do.\n\n559\n00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.040\n>> Nah.\n>> With that being said,\n\n560\n00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.700\nwe do need to sign off.\n\n561\n00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.974\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n562\n00:31:45.974 --> 00:31:46.886\n>>

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.232\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:21.712\nIn this episode, we move forth with\nmore of our Premier Pro series, and\n\n6\n00:00:21.712 --> 00:00:25.522\na voyager that is here to help\nus out with that very endeavor,\n\n7\n00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.230\nmy good friend, [LAUGH] Mr. James Biddle.\n\n8\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.916\nJames, welcome back, sir,\nwe're so glad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:31.612\n>> Good, it's great to be back everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:31.612 --> 00:00:32.802\nHey, last episode,\n\n11\n00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:36.980\ntoward the end there, I got really\nnerded out on the whole trimming thing.\n\n12\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.690\nOnce you really get into Adobe and\nyou learn a lot of this stuff,\n\n13\n00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.312\nyou will do the same thing.\n\n14\n00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:45.711\nYou'll be like watch this, hey,\nwatch this, watch what I do, okay?\n\n15\n00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:49.018\nSo in this one, I wanna address a few\nthings that you might have tried some\n\n16\n00:00:49.018 --> 00:00:52.370\nstuff, and you've run into some\nproblems and clarify a few things.\n\n17\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.379\nBut then we're going to\naddress speed changes.\n\n18\n00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.120\nEverybody loves, let's speed this up,\nlet's slow this down.\n\n19\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.224\nAnd there's a variety of different\nways to do that in Adobe Premier,\n\n20\n00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:05.071\nand some speed changes do different\nthings than others, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.190\nSo I wanna go back to\nmy timeline real quick.\n\n22\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.317\nBecause I bet a lot of you are really,\n[LAUGH] I know a lot of people here\n\n23\n00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:14.442\nhave been nerding out about\nAutomate To Sequence.\n\n24\n00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:17.020\nAnd it's like, this is it,\nthis is gonna save me so much time.\n\n25\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.490\nWell, sometimes you might try it, and\nyou don't get exactly what you want.\n\n26\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.720\nLet me give you an example here.\n\n27\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.009\nI've set up all these markers, and what\nI wanna do is I wanna put in five shots,\n\n28\n00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.877\none here, one here, one here,\none here, and one here.\n\n29\n00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:36.000\nAnd I wanna use that cool\nAutomate To Sequence thing.\n\n30\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.390\nWe talked in one of the earlier lessons\nabout over write, where I said, hey,\n\n31\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.720\nyou can put your other shots,\nyour B roll, or your cut away\n\n32\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.708\nshots in Video 2 instead of Video 1, and\nyou may feel more comfortable about that.\n\n33\n00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:55.690\nWell, let me come back over here to my\nproject window because I'm gonna use\n\n34\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.290\nsome of this footage for\nsomething I'm about to do, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.422\nAnd I've selected five items,\n\n36\n00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:08.140\nand notice nothing is selected so\nfar as the right side.\n\n37\n00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.080\nIf I don't select anything,\nnothing will happen.\n\n38\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.970\nYou know that, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.446\nSo I'll say, I wanna put that in Video 2,\nand it's highlighted.\n\n40\n00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:21.964\nCome over here, I'm gonna drag\nthis over to Automate To Sequence,\n\n41\n00:02:21.964 --> 00:02:25.540\njust plop it on real quick,\nyou know where that's located.\n\n42\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.660\nThe dialog's gonna come up.\n\n43\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.170\nI'm gonna do it in selection\norder cuz I selected everything\n\n44\n00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.910\nin a little bit of a different order.\n\n45\n00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.610\nI'm gonna do it at unnumbered markers,\nI'm gonna do the overwrite edit,\n\n46\n00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.070\nyou already did that before.\n\n47\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.050\nI don't want any audio,\nso I'm gonna ignore it.\n\n48\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.900\nI'm gonna click OK, and you're gonna say,\nhey, that went into Video 2 and\n\n49\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.530\neverything was cool, and\nI'm gonna be so happy.\n\n50\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.640\nWait a minute, it went into Video 1.\n\n51\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.150\nBut I had Video 2 chosen.\n\n52\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.020\nYou'll also notice, there's no sore side.\n\n53\n00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.420\nSince I'm automating it\nstraight to the sequence,\n\n54\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.170\nthis is one of the things\nthat does upset people.\n\n55\n00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.970\nThey say, it's just gonna go\ninto Video 1 every single time.\n\n56\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.820\nYep, that is the default.\n\n57\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.040\nSo I can do it in another sequence, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.090\nI could do it in another sequence, or I\ndid it in a completely different project.\n\n59\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.390\nI did it in a completely different\nproduct, and you'll say, so\n\n60\n00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.020\nwhat do I have to do?\n\n61\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.470\nI have to close the project,\nopen the project.\n\n62\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.780\nWatch this, this is why you will\nlearn to love Media Browser.\n\n63\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.880\nI'm gonna go to the Media Browser\nover here, open it up, and\n\n64\n00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.880\nstart looking through some stuff, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.100\nAnd okay, I bet I put it in LESSONS,\nI did, and\n\n66\n00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.170\nI created a project called Montage.\n\n67\n00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.620\nAnd when I click on it,\nthis is what I used in it.\n\n68\n00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.700\nHey, there's a sequence\nthere called Montage.\n\n69\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.500\nWhat I'm gonna do is Ctrl+Click and\nit's like, wait, so I'm gonna bring it\n\n70\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.160\nusing Media Browser, I'm looking\na completely different project, and\n\n71\n00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.110\nI'm gonna bring that\nsequence into this project.\n\n72\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.330\nYep, just like Menopollusen Voyagers,\n\n73\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.720\ngonna hit that stopwatch,\nboom, bam, there it is.\n\n74\n00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.950\nAnd I have a Montage sequence in here.\n\n75\n00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.620\nNow here's the cool thing I can do.\n\n76\n00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.720\n>> Cooler than that?\n\n77\n00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.312\n>> Cooler than that.\n\n78\n00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:18.119\n>> I can't believe it.\n\n79\n00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:21.400\n>> A lot of people don't realize\nyou can do this with sequences.\n\n80\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.038\nI'm gonna Ctrl+Click it,\ncome down here, and\n\n81\n00:04:25.038 --> 00:04:29.490\nit's gonna say, wait, woah,\nwoah, are you kidding me?\n\n82\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.720\nWhere did it go, where did it go,\nwhere did it go, where did it go?\n\n83\n00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.430\nI have an Open in Source Monitor?\n\n84\n00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.620\nYeah, I do.\n\n85\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.630\nI have an Open in Source Monitor.\n\n86\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.864\nBoom, this is now in the source monitor,\nand I can edit this in,\n\n87\n00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:51.675\njust like, It's a clip.\n\n88\n00:04:51.675 --> 00:04:53.600\nAnd I'll do that, and I'll say overwrite.\n\n89\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.230\nOkay, let's overwrite that in.\n\n90\n00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.160\nIs it not overwriting?\n\n91\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.180\nYou know why?\n\n92\n00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.140\nCuz it's also just like a clip.\n\n93\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.690\nThis V2 thing over here doesn't matter.\n\n94\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.970\nI have to take the V1 on the right side,\npop it in.\n\n95\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.750\nIt was disabled, so I got nothing.\n\n96\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.990\nOverwrite, boom, and you're like,\nwhoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n97\n00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.249\nWhy is it a green line?\n\n98\n00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.182\nWell, right now,\nit's bringing it in as a nest.\n\n99\n00:05:19.182 --> 00:05:23.010\nIf I double-click this,\nit shows me what's inside the nest.\n\n100\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.270\nAnd what's inside the nest\nis all the shots.\n\n101\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.090\nAnd I'll say that is inconvenient.\n\n102\n00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.470\nCan I change this?\n\n103\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.180\nYes, it's with this thing.\n\n104\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.730\nIt'll say, insert and overwrite\nsequences as nests or individual clips.\n\n105\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.550\nNow this has gotta be a before and\nafter kind of situation.\n\n106\n00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.969\nI can't already have the nest in,\nclick this thing, and\n\n107\n00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:51.116\nthen say, now it's not a nest anymore,\nI can't do it that way.\n\n108\n00:05:53.192 --> 00:05:57.267\nIf you see this symbol and it is blue,\nit looks like the sequence symbol and\n\n109\n00:05:57.267 --> 00:05:59.060\nit's xed out.\n\n110\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.860\nThat means, guess what,\nit's coming over as a nest,\n\n111\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.680\nthe individual tracks and\nclips have been marked out.\n\n112\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.110\nIf I click this, then it says look,\nthere's everything.\n\n113\n00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.000\nIt has a Video 3,\nthe Video 1 moved, great, so\n\n114\n00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.590\nnow I can just do this again, okay.\n\n115\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.750\nI'll bring this back,\nput it under the marker, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.960\nAnd overwrite its period, boom, there it\nis, and it comes in as individual clips.\n\n117\n00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.430\nSo now I have my individual clips,\nand I'm very, very happy.\n\n118\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.440\nSo that's what this thing does.\n\n119\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.420\nIf I edit sequences into sequences,\n\n120\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.020\nI can do them as nests,\nwhere everything is encapsulated.\n\n121\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.310\nOr I can just say, don't do that, and\nbreak it out into its individual clips.\n\n122\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.260\nAnd then I am a very happy person.\n\n123\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.429\n>> You are a man of many talents,\nmy friend.\n\n124\n00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:54.230\n>> Hey, it's all I've got,\nman, it's all I've got.\n\n125\n00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.760\n>> Not only did you show us how to import\na sequence from another project, but\n\n126\n00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.230\nyou also successfully referenced\na great 80s television star.\n\n127\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.943\n>> Thank you, it was wonderful, wonderful.\n\n128\n00:07:02.943 --> 00:07:05.441\nI mean, how can you not?\n\n129\n00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:08.915\nHere's another trick before we\nstart working with speed, okay,\n\n130\n00:07:08.915 --> 00:07:11.000\nthough a lot of people\ndon't know about this.\n\n131\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.612\nWhat they'll say is okay, so\n\n132\n00:07:12.612 --> 00:07:16.103\nyou're saying you're putting\nlike B roll of stuff in Video 2.\n\n133\n00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:19.775\nAnd you're putting your interview in Video\n1, am I just supposed to take notes or\n\n134\n00:07:19.775 --> 00:07:20.370\nsomething?\n\n135\n00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.100\nBelieve it or not, you come over here,\nand you look at what's called the header.\n\n136\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.500\nThese are called headers.\n\n137\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.284\nAnd as soon as you make them wider, and\n\n138\n00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:34.900\nyou can see them more,\nthis says Video 1 for the source patch.\n\n139\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.360\nOkay, like we did,\nwe patched Video 1 into Video 2.\n\n140\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.140\nThis is for track targeting when we were\ndoing our things like making cuts and\n\n141\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.510\ndoing all that.\n\n142\n00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.210\nYou say, what's that?\n\n143\n00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.470\nThat's the name.\n\n144\n00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.920\nSo what I can do is I can come down here,\nand\n\n145\n00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.760\nI can Ctrl-Click on the header itself and\nsay please rename this.\n\n146\n00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.950\nInstead of calling it Video 1,\ncall it Interview.\n\n147\n00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:59.188\nBoom, and then I'll Ctrl-Click this one,\nsay Rename, and\n\n148\n00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:05.333\nI'm gonna call this Broll Garden, and\nthen I'll go up to video three and\n\n149\n00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:09.983\nI'll say later I'm going to\nbe using that for titles.\n\n150\n00:08:09.983 --> 00:08:14.495\nAll right,\nnow I've made myself some notes.\n\n151\n00:08:14.495 --> 00:08:17.085\nAnd I have absolutely made\nmyself some notes on this.\n\n152\n00:08:17.085 --> 00:08:17.985\nAnd you're like that's awesome.\n\n153\n00:08:17.985 --> 00:08:19.235\nWhen are we getting your speed?\n\n154\n00:08:19.235 --> 00:08:19.735\nOkay.\n\n155\n00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:24.005\nFirst of all,\nwe're gonna come back over here.\n\n156\n00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:29.960\nI'm gonna do my Shift minus to resize\nthis, or sort of collapse down little bit.\n\n157\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.790\nAnd I'm going to take a look\nat what I have done okay.\n\n158\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.260\nThat is it, that is terrible\nit sort of rectifier itself.\n\n159\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.540\nBut that is terrible\n\n160\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.800\neven though this is technically\na formal trimming I like to call this.\n\n161\n00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.842\nSort of a speed or a time change.\n\n162\n00:08:45.842 --> 00:08:50.070\nI'm gonna do something that people\nkind of feel uncomfortable with.\n\n163\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.670\nIt is called a slip.\n\n164\n00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.505\nBasically what I've done is,\nthat length is great.\n\n165\n00:08:56.505 --> 00:09:02.340\nBut, the area that I've taken\nfrom the clip is wrong.\n\n166\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.735\nOkay I need to move it.\n\n167\n00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:07.620\nSo it's in a better part of the shot.\n\n168\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:14.191\nSo, I have several methods\nby which I can do this.\n\n169\n00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:21.140\nI can double-click it, and then come\nover here and size it down and say okay.\n\n170\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.959\nSo it has this in point and\nout point here.\n\n171\n00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:28.109\nAnd technically,\nit has all of this footage and\n\n172\n00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:31.750\nI wish I could just take the length,\nbut move it there.\n\n173\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:39.940\nIf I zoom in on this, it has a little\nhandle and I can click on it.\n\n174\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.820\nOkay and click, come here, this is what\ngets me every single, there you go.\n\n175\n00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.250\nGrab it and then move it over.\n\n176\n00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.860\nLet me zoom out quickly.\n\n177\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:54.870\nAnd it's now showing me where the endpoint\nlands and where the out point lands.\n\n178\n00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.570\nAnd because I double-clicked\nit from the sequence.\n\n179\n00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.720\nIt's telling me you're working\nwith the one in the sequence.\n\n180\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.140\nSo now if I let go, boom.\n\n181\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.290\nAnd that is one way to slip this.\n\n182\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.580\nSay okay, I like that better.\n\n183\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:15.217\nI like that better and I sort of,\nin a way I have sort of re-timed it.\n\n184\n00:10:15.217 --> 00:10:15.845\nOkay?\n\n185\n00:10:15.845 --> 00:10:17.780\nAnd I like that.\n\n186\n00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.160\nI re-timed it, it looks better.\n\n187\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.000\nYou don't have to do it that way,\nlet me re-time another one.\n\n188\n00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.230\nOkay?\n\n189\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.300\nAnd what I'm just doing is I'm\njust changing its time location.\n\n190\n00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.805\nHere's this cactus.\n\n191\n00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:33.840\nMaybe, that's all right, but\nI think there's a better part of it, but\n\n192\n00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.860\nI like that distance.\n\n193\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.960\nI can come over here to my tools.\n\n194\n00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.490\nAnd say okay there's the Ripple Tool,\nthere's the Rolling Edit,\n\n195\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.350\nthere's the Rate Stretch,\naha, there's the Slip Tool.\n\n196\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.320\nAnd I'll Come back over here.\n\n197\n00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.960\nPut it on top.\n\n198\n00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:55.290\nAnd say okay I'm gonna slip this and up\ntop what it shows me is all right there's\n\n199\n00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:01.310\nyour new end point location, and there's\nyour new out point location on the bottom.\n\n200\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:06.200\nSo I'm gonna start it more in\nto the movement on the camera.\n\n201\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.800\nCome back, and there it is.\n\n202\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.000\nOkay, boom!\n\n203\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.830\nAnd it looks a lot better,\nthat's a lot better.\n\n204\n00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.520\nIt's rallied up a little bit more.\n\n205\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.160\nOkay.\n\n206\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.625\nSo this is a form of retiming if you will.\n\n207\n00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:26.326\nIt's a form of retiming if you will.\n\n208\n00:11:26.326 --> 00:11:33.605\nI can also say maybe the issue here,\nlet me jump in.\n\n209\n00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:39.391\nBring this video up a little bit, is I\nwish I had little less of the sprinkler,\n\n210\n00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:43.610\nlittle more,\njust keep this distance right here.\n\n211\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.260\nKeep this distance, move it\na little bit into the sprinkler and\n\n212\n00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.190\nstretch the frog a bit.\n\n213\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.880\nNow, that's kind of like doing\na double roller trim on both sides.\n\n214\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.640\nDo I have to go into trim mode and\nthen hit it and all that?\n\n215\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.450\nNope, not at all.\n\n216\n00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.550\nWhat I can do is say this is a slip.\n\n217\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.110\nThis is like taking the existing in and\n\n218\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.480\nout points of that clip I had and\nmoving it, slipping it within.\n\n219\n00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.740\nWhat I want to do is slide it.\n\n220\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.760\nI want to slide it left to right.\n\n221\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.530\nOkay?\n\n222\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:16.030\nSo, I come back out here, get my key.\n\n223\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.100\nDown here, I have a slide tool.\n\n224\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.830\nSo, when I did this slip earlier,\n\n225\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.410\nin this window it was showing\nme down here, here's the clip.\n\n226\n00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.150\nIt's changing the in and\nout point location of the clip.\n\n227\n00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.572\nWhen I do the slide now.\n\n228\n00:12:30.572 --> 00:12:35.280\nLet me see if I can zoom in and\nget a little bit better on this.\n\n229\n00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.300\nWhen I hit the slide,\ndown at the bottom it's showing me, and\n\n230\n00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.330\nthis is going to be a little rough.\n\n231\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:47.350\nIt's saying okay,\nthe clips on either side are changing.\n\n232\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.600\nSo, the clips on either side\nare changing a little bit.\n\n233\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.850\nThe one in the center\nstays the same length.\n\n234\n00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:58.420\nThe other ones are trimming on either\nside to get a little more out of it.\n\n235\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.360\nAre there hotkeys for this?\n\n236\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n237\n00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.530\nIt's a little bit of gymnastics\nwhen you do it though.\n\n238\n00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.910\nSo I will let.\n\n239\n00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.350\nThe best way to do that is to\ngo to the keyboard shortcuts,\n\n240\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.152\ntype in slip, type in slide.\n\n241\n00:13:11.152 --> 00:13:14.934\nAnd you can learn that it deals the left\nand right keys or the greater than,\n\n242\n00:13:14.934 --> 00:13:16.460\nlesser than keys.\n\n243\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.440\nSometimes it can be very intuitive,\nsometimes it's not.\n\n244\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.866\nSo now let's deal with actual speed.\n\n245\n00:13:22.866 --> 00:13:26.060\nMaking it fast, making it slower.\n\n246\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.730\nIf I'm gonna stay with tools.\n\n247\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.650\nOkay, and come over here.\n\n248\n00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.192\nOkay.\n\n249\n00:13:32.192 --> 00:13:33.195\nI've got a lot of different tools.\n\n250\n00:13:33.195 --> 00:13:35.598\nI have this one it's called rate stretch.\n\n251\n00:13:35.598 --> 00:13:38.880\nIt's like ooh, I like that.\n\n252\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.510\nWhat does that do?\n\n253\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.360\nIf I click it I will come to the end.\n\n254\n00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.700\nIt kind of looks like a trimming tool.\n\n255\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.555\nOkay, I will come to the end and\nI'll say, hey,\n\n256\n00:13:47.555 --> 00:13:50.766\nI would like the sprinkler to go faster.\n\n257\n00:13:50.766 --> 00:13:52.567\nIt's like, okay.\n\n258\n00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:54.842\nI'll highlight it.\n\n259\n00:13:54.842 --> 00:14:00.477\n[SOUND] And as I do that it's telling\nme the duration is now going down.\n\n260\n00:14:00.477 --> 00:14:03.420\nIf you see the segment get shorter.\n\n261\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.580\nIt's going faster.\n\n262\n00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.480\nIf I make it longer.\n\n263\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.410\nIt's going slower.\n\n264\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.377\nSo now it is slow.\n\n265\n00:14:10.377 --> 00:14:14.461\n>> So it's not actually\naffecting the video itself.\n\n266\n00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:17.496\nIt's not making it a shorter\nvideo it's just, speeding it up.\n\n267\n00:14:17.496 --> 00:14:19.170\n>> Right.\nSo that it fits in a small amount of time.\n\n268\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.610\n>> Right, so in order to be, but,\nyeah, in order to be slower.\n\n269\n00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.340\nIt's gotta look longer.\n\n270\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.340\nAnd notice it's, now it's saying,\nokay you are at 74.44%.\n\n271\n00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.820\nAnd if you move that over there,\nit'll give you a little dialog.\n\n272\n00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.679\nIt's now at 74.4%,\nstarts there, ends there.\n\n273\n00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:35.010\nThe duration is now three seconds.\n\n274\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.850\nSome people love the rate\nstretch tool like that.\n\n275\n00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.540\nThey love that.\n\n276\n00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.590\nBut, maybe I want to type in some values.\n\n277\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.550\nSo let's.\n\n278\n00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:52.170\nFirst of all, I'll come to the banana\ncactus, cuz it's my banana plant.\n\n279\n00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.430\nThat's my cactus.\n\n280\n00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.700\nSo, going forward a little bit,\nwhat I will say is this.\n\n281\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.440\nI'm gonna switch back to the selection\ntool, which is also V, and\n\n282\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.480\nI can control click on this.\n\n283\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.639\nAnd I will say speed duration.\n\n284\n00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.580\nBoom.\n\n285\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.210\nYou may recognize this from other\napplications you might have used.\n\n286\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.230\nThe thing that's nice about this\nis you can change the speed or\n\n287\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.320\nthe duration in tandem.\n\n288\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.489\nIt's like okay, it's two seconds.\n\n289\n00:15:20.489 --> 00:15:25.380\nI wanna just,\nlet me just change it to two seconds.\n\n290\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.622\nOkay, and it's like boom.\n\n291\n00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:28.990\nNow you get two seconds.\n\n292\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.960\nYou didn't have to futz\nwith the speed percentage.\n\n293\n00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.100\nYou can just type that in.\n\n294\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.540\nIt's two seconds, or you could reverse it.\n\n295\n00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.660\nYou want to go in reverse, Ripple Edit.\n\n296\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.790\nIf i have that on, and\nthis is now going faster.\n\n297\n00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.834\nSo the clip is going to be shorter.\n\n298\n00:15:46.834 --> 00:15:53.845\nLet me show you, if I say ripple the edit,\nshifting the trailing clips, okay.\n\n299\n00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.187\nSee that?\n\n300\n00:15:56.187 --> 00:15:59.886\nThe clip that was trailing it,\nmoved with it.\n\n301\n00:15:59.886 --> 00:16:03.850\nThat may not be what you want but\nI Ctrl+click it.\n\n302\n00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.550\nAnd do speed duration and\nsay, don't ripple at it.\n\n303\n00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.540\nIt holds the speed within the clip itself.\n\n304\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.920\nAnd I've sped it up to two seconds.\n\n305\n00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.480\nLife is good.\n\n306\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:27.742\nLet me do the speed again,\nCtrl+click Speed\n\n307\n00:16:27.742 --> 00:16:33.918\nduration let's say I'm going\nto change this to 50%.\n\n308\n00:16:33.918 --> 00:16:36.600\nThat's gonna be slower,\nso it's gonna be longer.\n\n309\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.110\nNo ripple, boom, it remains the same.\n\n310\n00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:46.960\nIt doesn't ripple but\nit's going slower within the clip itself.\n\n311\n00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.910\nIf it rippled then it would\npush everything down.\n\n312\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:56.710\nSo that's why this can be a really\ngood advantage to do this.\n\n313\n00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.420\nThe advantage of using\nthe rate stretch duo and\n\n314\n00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.230\nspeed duration is you can do audio and\nvideo.\n\n315\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.344\nThis last when I'm gonna show you\nis a little bit more detailed and\n\n316\n00:17:10.344 --> 00:17:14.240\nit involves something called a key frame.\n\n317\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:20.380\nBut let's say what I've on both of these\nis I have affected the entire clip.\n\n318\n00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.920\nLike the entire clip became slower,\nthe entire clip went faster.\n\n319\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.710\nWhat if I only wanna do\na little portion of it?\n\n320\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.520\nWe often do this like let's say I'm\nturning my head towards somebody and I go.\n\n321\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.910\nAnd they say hey can you\nspeed up his reaction and\n\n322\n00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.580\nthe clip is this long but\nyou only want to do this much.\n\n323\n00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.220\nYes.\n\n324\n00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.830\nI can do just a speed segment.\n\n325\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:52.730\nSo let me get back in here and\npick something that I wanna do this with.\n\n326\n00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:57.870\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and just go\nright into the timeline on this one.\n\n327\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.830\nProbably gonna be he bird feeder.\n\n328\n00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.220\nAnd what I wanna do is just\ntake a certain portion of this.\n\n329\n00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.824\nSo I'm gonna go to the bird feeder,\nI'm gonna do my tilde key and\n\n330\n00:18:08.824 --> 00:18:11.143\ngo out, let me find what I want.\n\n331\n00:18:11.143 --> 00:18:12.393\nK, L-.\n\n332\n00:18:12.393 --> 00:18:16.345\n>> [INAUDIBLE].\n\n333\n00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:19.043\n>> Yeah, let's say all of\na sudden I want that bird,\n\n334\n00:18:19.043 --> 00:18:21.450\nI want that thing to swing really fast.\n\n335\n00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.180\nWhy?\n\n336\n00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.315\nNo idea but just for a slight second or\nslow down for a slight second.\n\n337\n00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:27.614\n>> Hurricane simulations.\n\n338\n00:18:27.614 --> 00:18:29.200\n>> Hurricane Simulations yes.\n\n339\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.340\nAbsolutely.\n\n340\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.970\nOr basically if you've got shows with\na lot of cars, this is a lot of fun.\n\n341\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.140\nSo I'm gonna need a couple of items.\n\n342\n00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.850\nRight now I have something\non called effects badges.\n\n343\n00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.165\nI need those on.\n\n344\n00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:45.905\nSo this is where I come\nback to my timeline, and\n\n345\n00:18:45.905 --> 00:18:48.835\ncertain things that I don't use often,\nI'm gonna need.\n\n346\n00:18:50.615 --> 00:18:54.715\nSo I need to see video key frames.\n\n347\n00:18:54.715 --> 00:18:55.669\nThere's the line.\n\n348\n00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.760\nAnd I need to make sure effects\nbadges are on, it is on.\n\n349\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.887\nI'm gonna come back over here and\nsay okay,\n\n350\n00:19:03.887 --> 00:19:08.250\nI'm gonna Ctrl + click\non the effects badge.\n\n351\n00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:16.150\nRight now, this is set to Opacity, so\nthat means if you wanna make it disappear,\n\n352\n00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.950\nor fade in and fade out,\nthat's what the line means.\n\n353\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.052\nI'm going to switch it to Time Remapping,\nSpeed.\n\n354\n00:19:22.052 --> 00:19:25.160\nIt's going to save my project real quick.\n\n355\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.170\nThank you, Premiere.\n\n356\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:33.870\nAnd I might, what I need to do is I need\nto have a tool that will set key frames.\n\n357\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.750\nIf you've never worked\nwith key frames before.\n\n358\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.160\nWe talk about persistence of vision.\n\n359\n00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.520\nIn order to have video, you have 24 frames\nin one second, 30 frames in one second,\n\n360\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.280\nhowever you want to look at it.\n\n361\n00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.880\nIn film, when we need to do effects,\nwe have to send it off for processing.\n\n362\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.673\nSo I would take a little wax pencil and\nI would say, okay, on this frame.\n\n363\n00:19:52.673 --> 00:19:56.267\nThis is the key frame this\nis where the effects starts.\n\n364\n00:19:56.267 --> 00:20:01.340\nAnd I'm gonna draw a line to the next\nframe, go this is where the effect ends.\n\n365\n00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.560\nAnd then I'd write in\nthe details of the effect.\n\n366\n00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.610\nSo between those two key frames,\nsomething has to happen.\n\n367\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.230\nThat's exactly what I'm going\nto do here in the timeline.\n\n368\n00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.010\nI could go to the tool, and\n\n369\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.980\nwe'll do this later when we do\nvideo effects in the next one.\n\n370\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.230\nYou're like, can I skip to video effects.\n\n371\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.689\nNo, do this here.\n\n372\n00:20:19.689 --> 00:20:24.130\nUsing the selection tool, if I just\nhold down Cmd, I get this little plus.\n\n373\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.600\nI've now added a key frame.\n\n374\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.370\nI'll play forward just a little bit.\n\n375\n00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.997\nOkay, [NOISE] And I will say,\n\n376\n00:20:34.997 --> 00:20:38.969\nI wanna add a key frame there.\n\n377\n00:20:38.969 --> 00:20:42.160\nHold down Cmd, boom!\n\n378\n00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.930\nThis is what gets people who\nwork with these things a lot.\n\n379\n00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.190\nIf you work with key frames a lot,\nthe first thing you're saying is.\n\n380\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.900\nOkay now I move the actually key frame.\n\n381\n00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.030\nEspecially if you're an active\neffects user, something like that.\n\n382\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.580\nIt's like you know now I\nmove the key frame right?\n\n383\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.010\nIn the case of speed the line\nrepresents the speed.\n\n384\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:07.570\nSo I will say, what I need to do\nis take the line and move it up.\n\n385\n00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.000\nAnd notice it's saying, okay,\nnow it's gonna go faster.\n\n386\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.180\nCool.\n\n387\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.290\nAnd now it goes faster.\n\n388\n00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:22.270\nI can not control the fact that this is\ngoing to ripple when it gets shorter.\n\n389\n00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:22.930\nI can't.\n\n390\n00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.980\nIt's not like in the speed duration\nwhere I say, okay, ripple, don't ripple.\n\n391\n00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.700\nThis is gonna ripple.\n\n392\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.690\nOkay, it's gonna ripple and\nin this case put in a gap.\n\n393\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.759\nIf I jump out real quick and\ntake a look at what I've done.\n\n394\n00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.310\nWhat have you done?\n\n395\n00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.380\nHere we go, let me back up a little bit.\n\n396\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.270\nAnd let me also get this so\nI can see a little more of my timeline.\n\n397\n00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.190\nI'm gonna use that shift minus.\n\n398\n00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.810\nOkay here we go.\n\n399\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.446\nAnd you saw just a little bump in\nthe speed there, just a little bitty bump.\n\n400\n00:21:57.446 --> 00:22:01.280\nIt wasn't much but\nmaybe it made a difference to somebody.\n\n401\n00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.800\nAnd that's what you get.\n\n402\n00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.920\nThe other thing that you\nwant to know about this.\n\n403\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.260\nI'm using my plus minus,\nand I'm using Cmd+-.\n\n404\n00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.780\nI'm gonna roll back with J.\n\n405\n00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.160\nAll right.\n\n406\n00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.160\nThat's the speed line.\n\n407\n00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.250\nI can do this many times in here.\n\n408\n00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.890\nI can add a bunch of key frames.\n\n409\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.050\nI can add a lot of key frames.\n\n410\n00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.900\nAnd do a lot of speed changes like slow\nit down, speed it up, bring it down,\n\n411\n00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.260\nboom, done, crazy.\n\n412\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.900\nAnd it's gonna look weird.\n\n413\n00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.312\nAnd then people will say,\nokay then what are those.\n\n414\n00:22:37.312 --> 00:22:42.860\nThis is what we refer to\noftentimes as a hold,\n\n415\n00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:51.830\nas in it simply goes from 100%, snaps\nto 136%, and then snaps down to this.\n\n416\n00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.020\nIf I take these widgets and\npull them apart.\n\n417\n00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.790\nThen I get a ramp.\n\n418\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:05.770\nAnd now it will ramp a linear ramp from\n100, 101 to 102 is like up to here,\n\n419\n00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:10.500\nand I get a ramp in speed.\n\n420\n00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.280\nIf I click in the center of\nthese two I get bezier handles.\n\n421\n00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.050\nI can then grab the handle and smooth it.\n\n422\n00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.990\nIf you've ever worked with bezier\nhandles in other applications before,\n\n423\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.250\nespecially in Adobe.\n\n424\n00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:26.210\nI just take it and\nit makes a nice smooth ramp.\n\n425\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.850\nOr in some cases, people call it like\nan ease in and an ease out, if you will.\n\n426\n00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:36.290\nAnd I can then smooth that out and\nit looks a bit different.\n\n427\n00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.290\nI'm going to use my friends\nin an out point here.\n\n428\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.010\nCome back.\n\n429\n00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.129\nWhat am I going to do with that?\n\n430\n00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.988\nOf course I'm going to do play and out.\n\n431\n00:23:44.988 --> 00:23:52.600\nOption K, and I know it sounded like ramps\nin and ramps out, nice and smoothly.\n\n432\n00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.486\nSo that's how these speed\nchanges work with this.\n\n433\n00:23:56.486 --> 00:24:01.414\nThe thing is, I can't do audio with this.\n\n434\n00:24:01.414 --> 00:24:05.812\nWhen I use this type of Speed,\nmotion change in the timeline,\n\n435\n00:24:05.812 --> 00:24:10.378\nI can't do audio, you'd have to\nmake some cuts in your audio and\n\n436\n00:24:10.378 --> 00:24:13.440\nkind of fineagle that around a little bit.\n\n437\n00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.870\nIf I go in and I do my interview,\nand I change this real quick,\n\n438\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.695\nit's going to be like okay now\nyou're video is real fast here but\n\n439\n00:24:20.695 --> 00:24:24.135\nyour audio stays the same length,\nnow you're out of sync.\n\n440\n00:24:24.135 --> 00:24:28.315\nAnd there's no way to correct that,\nso be careful when you're doing this.\n\n441\n00:24:28.315 --> 00:24:29.155\nHave fun with it but\n\n442\n00:24:29.155 --> 00:24:32.845\njust realize the limitations of all\nthe things you are working with.\n\n443\n00:24:32.845 --> 00:24:37.700\nWhen you make speed changes in\nthe timeline you're doing a small section.\n\n444\n00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.700\nYou're doing a small section and\nit's going to effect everything around it.\n\n445\n00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.290\nIf I'm doing speed duration or if I'm\ndoing the rate change tool you can do\n\n446\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.720\naudio and\nvideo at the same time keep it in sync.\n\n447\n00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.360\nThings going out of sync really tend\nto disturb people it's like I've done\n\n448\n00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.660\na bad thing.\n\n449\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.380\nYou'll get used to the fact that you\nput stuff out of sync all the time.\n\n450\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.690\nI'm gonna do it later.\n\n451\n00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:04.010\nI'm gonna show you how in one easy step,\nyou can actually put stuff back into sync.\n\n452\n00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.750\nIt's a lot easier than people think it is,\n\n453\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.610\nbecause it's like,\nwait you can click that?\n\n454\n00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.540\nYes you can click that,\nand they didn't know.\n\n455\n00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:14.130\nSo that's speed, that is how speed\nworks in Adobe, and it's really fun.\n\n456\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.000\nYou can do entire clips.\n\n457\n00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.670\nOr you can do small sections of clips,\njust with the key grips.\n\n458\n00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:23.150\n>> Yeah, and I like how they have multiple\ntools for speed for multiple jobs.\n\n459\n00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.190\n>> Exactly.\n>> If we were using our last example like\n\n460\n00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.410\nyou said, doing it with audio's\nnot really gonna be that awesome.\n\n461\n00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:31.190\nCuz it's gonna freak it out,\nit's gonna make it sound weird.\n\n462\n00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.800\nSo it's a tool for a specific job.\n\n463\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.100\nWe have tools for increasing the speed\nwith audio and video as well.\n\n464\n00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.860\nWhen you have those things together you\nhave to know which one to use and when to\n\n465\n00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.380\nuse it and you're doing a fantastic\njob of demonstrating that for us.\n\n466\n00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.880\nJames, we do appreciate it.\n\n467\n00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.840\n>> And I know people get really,\nwhen they see this, they get really upset.\n\n468\n00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.210\nBut it left a gap, now what do I do?\n\n469\n00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.130\nThat's why we did trimming.\n\n470\n00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.680\nYou can trim it over, you can edit it\nover, and take care of it that way.\n\n471\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.410\nSo you've already gone through some\nlessons where you now have this arsenal of\n\n472\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.750\nthings, if that happens it's I could do\nthis, I could do this, I could do this.\n\n473\n00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.425\nThat's not a problem.\n\n474\n00:26:04.425 --> 00:26:06.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's what you learn with editors.\n\n475\n00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.520\nWe're like therapists.\n\n476\n00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.760\nIt's like we'll worry about that later.\n\n477\n00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.140\nEverything's fine, let's just keep going.\n\n478\n00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:10.965\n>> Let's talk about your mother.\n\n479\n00:26:10.965 --> 00:26:12.250\n[LAUGH]\n>> Let's talk about your mom, and\n\n480\n00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:13.520\nhow she affects your timeline.\n\n481\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.470\nSit down, smoke a cigarette.\n\n482\n00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.085\nSo yeah.\n\n483\n00:26:16.085 --> 00:26:19.340\nSo, you're getting,\nthe more you get used to this,\n\n484\n00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.810\nthe more you're gonna feel like, I know\nnine different ways to correct that.\n\n485\n00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.000\nLet me just stay in here now,\nI'll go back and do that later.\n\n486\n00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.770\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n487\n00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:26.840\nThank you so much James.\n\n488\n00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.940\n>> No problem, man.\n>> We appreciate that.\n\n489\n00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.770\nI'm sure you guys are getting\na lot out of this, I know I am.\n\n490\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.920\nThe problem is, is that for\nthis episode we have come to a close.\n\n491\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.920\nWe do appreciate you.\n\n492\n00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.140\nWe thank James for stopping by.\n\n493\n00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.150\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n494\n00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.350\nAnd we're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n495\n00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.960\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n496\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.670\n>> I'm James Biddle.\n\n497\n00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.911\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n498\n00:26:43.911 --> 00:26:52.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.760\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.390\nin today's episode we continue on with\nmore of our Adobe Premiere Pro series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.910\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us out with that,\n\n6\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.860\nis our good friend Mr. James Biddle.\n\n7\n00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.021\nJames, welcome back, sir!\n\n8\n00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:29.007\n>> Hey, what's going on?\n\n9\n00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:30.580\n>> How's it going?\n>> Doing all right, man.\n\n10\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.963\nI'm just really excited.\n\n11\n00:00:31.963 --> 00:00:34.995\nOkay, so\ndid a lot of stuff in the last lesson.\n\n12\n00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:38.895\nNow, what everybody's been clamoring for\nVisual Effects!\n\n13\n00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:40.210\nGaussian blurs!\n\n14\n00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.258\nTints!\n\n15\n00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:41.990\n>> Lightsabers.\n\n16\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.741\n>> Lightsabers!\n\n17\n00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.427\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No lightsabers.\n\n18\n00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:45.090\n>> [CROSSTALK] No lightsabers.\n\n19\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.930\n>> Okay, but they can get close.\n\n20\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.577\nSo what I'm gonna start with first, is\nI'm gonna start with some motion effects,\n\n21\n00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:52.243\nhow you can do the things with stills or\n\n22\n00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:55.030\nvideo to make them move and\ndo some really cool stuff.\n\n23\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.940\nThen we're gonna add some\nstuff onto the clips-\n\n24\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.105\n>> Like lightsabers?\n\n25\n00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:03.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm a poor student.\n\n26\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.270\n>> It's okay, I still value you.\n\n27\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.770\nAnd then I'm gonna show\nyou how to do something\n\n28\n00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.430\nreally cool with Source Clip, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.775\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n30\n00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:15.870\nHere's the really cool thing first,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.800\nstick to the editing interface,\nokay, or the GUI if you will.\n\n32\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.280\nAnd I could switch to the one that's\nspecifically for Effects, but\n\n33\n00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.770\nI wanna go ahead and stick with\nthis one for now if you don't mind.\n\n34\n00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.290\nUsually when we want to\nsee what's on a clip,\n\n35\n00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.910\nin terms of controlling it for\nan effect, okay.\n\n36\n00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.430\nWhen we go up here in the Source area\nin general, this is where it's located,\n\n37\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.050\nEffects Controls, and\nuntil I highlight a segment\n\n38\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.440\nin the timeline, it's empty, all right.\n\n39\n00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.010\nNow what I could do is go through and\nclick each individual one.\n\n40\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.420\nThe issue with that is I've\nhighlighted this one but\n\n41\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.350\nmy play head's all the way over here and\nI'm gonna, all right, let me pull that\n\n42\n00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.090\nover here and then highlight and\nit's a real pain in the butt.\n\n43\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.440\nBut this is what people get used to.\n\n44\n00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.140\nAll right.\n\n45\n00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.930\nThere's a better way.\n\n46\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.530\nAnd because it deals with\nthe blue play head and\n\n47\n00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.110\nthe blue tracks on the right side, I could\nsay, hey, in the sequence do me a favor.\n\n48\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.000\nLet the selection follow\nwhere the play head goes.\n\n49\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.980\nLet me zoom in on this real quick\nusing the till of the key and\n\n50\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.610\nwatch this, now every time I go to\na new clip, that one is highlighted.\n\n51\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.090\nAnd now it's gonna show up in the effects\ncontrols and that makes my life so\n\n52\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.000\nmuch better.\n\n53\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.490\nWhat if I want to switch\nto what's in video one?\n\n54\n00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.400\nFine, then I'll just\nclick video one on and\n\n55\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.310\nturn video two off and it's doing those.\n\n56\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.100\nAnd it saves me so much time and headache\nto have to go, all right, I'll do this and\n\n57\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.350\nthen I have to move this back,\nthat's no fun.\n\n58\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.710\nSo I'll do that.\n\n59\n00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.915\nI have no idea who that\nlittle voice came from.\n\n60\n00:02:57.915 --> 00:02:59.843\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So I'm gonna work with this JPEG\n\n61\n00:02:59.843 --> 00:03:00.990\nright here.\n\n62\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.500\nAs you can see, what I did was\nI brought it into my timeline,\n\n63\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.330\nput it in the sequence, and\nI said, okay, set to frame size.\n\n64\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.180\nI did that.\n\n65\n00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.850\nBut I've still got a little bit over here.\n\n66\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.080\nOkay, I could still see what's under it.\n\n67\n00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.290\nSo, and\nbecause I did set instead of scale,\n\n68\n00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.740\nit's at 18% and I have plenty of\nroom to make this thing move around.\n\n69\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.590\nSo, I'm gonna look under\nthe motion parameters.\n\n70\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.290\nWhat motion parameters do I have?\n\n71\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.740\nWell, I'm divided into three areas.\n\n72\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.190\nFirst of all, I have Motion, and\nif I click in there, Position,\n\n73\n00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.450\nScale, Scale Width.\n\n74\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.277\nIf I choose to separate it,\nI'm doing a uniform scale today.\n\n75\n00:03:43.277 --> 00:03:49.348\nRotation, Anchor Point and\nAnti-flicker Filter.\n\n76\n00:03:49.348 --> 00:03:52.518\nOpacity, I have my blend modes.\n\n77\n00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:56.070\nIt's like oo,\nif I know my Photoshop stuff and\n\n78\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.830\nI know my Blend modes,\nI can do blending in here.\n\n79\n00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.490\nSo I get all of those in here.\n\n80\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.900\nSo it's not just a normal like turn one\nsort of transparent over the other.\n\n81\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.220\nI can blend the pixels together one\non top of the other if I want to.\n\n82\n00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.828\nI also have Time Remapping.\n\n83\n00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:13.570\nSo I could've done the Time Remapping\nin here, but I will tell you,\n\n84\n00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.690\nthat's kind of rough.\n\n85\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.590\nThat is actually kind of rough.\n\n86\n00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.570\nNotice under Opacity, something that we're\ngoing to do in some of the other effects\n\n87\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.200\nlater, I have masks that I can now do in\nhere without having to add another layer.\n\n88\n00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.980\nIt's kind of fun though.\n\n89\n00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.780\nWe're gonna do that with titles later, but\nI can now add a mask to certain effects,\n\n90\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.200\nand only affect a certain area,\nwhich is nice.\n\n91\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.767\nEspecially if you needed\nto blur out my face, if you\n\n92\n00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:44.408\nneed to do a Gaussian blur and blur out\nmy face cuz I was ratting on the mob or\n\n93\n00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:48.263\nsomething, I can just put on the Gaussian\nblur effect, and then do it here.\n\n94\n00:04:48.263 --> 00:04:49.727\nSame thing with Opacity.\n\n95\n00:04:49.727 --> 00:04:52.918\nIf I need to make to something kinda\ndisappear, I could do that as well.\n\n96\n00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:58.700\nAll right, so in motion,\nthe thing I need to affect is the scale.\n\n97\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.230\nSo if I wanted to do\njust overall to the clip,\n\n98\n00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.580\ndoesn't matter, put my little hand on\nthere and bump it up, and there it is.\n\n99\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.610\nThat's nice, that's terrific.\n\n100\n00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.420\nIt's there and it's a happy thing.\n\n101\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.370\nEverything is great.\n\n102\n00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.900\nBut now I want to ramp this up.\n\n103\n00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.190\nI want kind of do like\nthat Ken Burns effect.\n\n104\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.900\nMaybe I want to zoom it in and\nall that, move it around.\n\n105\n00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.400\nOkay.\n\n106\n00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.420\nSo I'm gonna zoom in here.\n\n107\n00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.160\nWhenever I want to do that,\nthe first thing I have to do is say,\n\n108\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.750\nhey, I need to activate some keyframes.\n\n109\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.640\nWhat you want to know about keyframes,\n\n110\n00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.340\nthis is something that\nhas to happen over time.\n\n111\n00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.380\nWhen I just kicked this up to 22%,\nit just did the whole thing.\n\n112\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.660\nWhen I activate keyframes, it's like I\nwant to do something that happens at this\n\n113\n00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.580\nmoment and then interpolate,\nas we say, to another moment.\n\n114\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.280\nThat's why I click on the stopwatch.\n\n115\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.870\nAnd it's like, okay, I have toggled\nthe animation, I get some new things here.\n\n116\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.110\nIt says, hey, here's this new thing,\nit's like, you've added one keyframe.\n\n117\n00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.610\nIt's right there.\n\n118\n00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.010\nI can now add and\nmove keyframes with this button.\n\n119\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.510\nI can also go directly to other\nkeyframes with these buttons.\n\n120\n00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.740\nThese become very helpful later.\n\n121\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.940\nIt's like,\nhow do I know I'm right on that keyframe?\n\n122\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.840\nUse the buttons.\n\n123\n00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.960\nGonna go forward a little bit and\nI'm gonna say, okay,\n\n124\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.060\nthis is gonna be my animation point and I\ncan either drop another keyframe, this is\n\n125\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.760\none of the things, do I drop the keyframe\nfirst or do I change the parameter?\n\n126\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.130\nIt all depends on what you\nfeel most comfortable with.\n\n127\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.020\nSome people say,\nI always drop the keyframe and\n\n128\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.360\nthen change the parameter, everybody\ntells that, I just put in them big thing.\n\n129\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.676\nWhat I'm gonna do is go ahead and\ndrop the keyframe and then say,\n\n130\n00:06:39.676 --> 00:06:45.840\nall right, let me raise that up,\nthat goes really fast.\n\n131\n00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.620\nBring it down and\nsay I wanna raise it up to about, there.\n\n132\n00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.159\nIf I use this and\ngo back to the previous keyframe,\n\n133\n00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:58.720\nit'll take me back there and\nthen I'm just gonna hit Play.\n\n134\n00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.840\nAnd it goes up really fast, and\nit's like, okay, that was really cool.\n\n135\n00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.930\nIt went really fast.\n\n136\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.160\nThen I'll say, you know what,\nmaybe I wanted to extend it a little more.\n\n137\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.640\nDoesn't mean I have to erase the keyframe.\n\n138\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.710\nI'm gonna say, you know what?\n\n139\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.240\nKind of wish clicking it I'd\nhave been more down here.\n\n140\n00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.104\nSo I can pick them up and move them,\nsay it should've been faster,\n\n141\n00:07:21.104 --> 00:07:22.960\nnow I'll make it slower.\n\n142\n00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.950\nSo now it happens a little bit slower,\nlike that.\n\n143\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.586\nThis is a linear keyframe change as in,\n\n144\n00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:35.030\nif I now come over here,\nwhat does this thing do?\n\n145\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.860\nWhat does this exposure triangle do?\n\n146\n00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.570\nBoom.\n\n147\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.690\nIt shows me the interpolation,\nand it is a linear change.\n\n148\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.320\nJust like a ramp.\n\n149\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.809\nDoesn't necessarily look\nreally very natural.\n\n150\n00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:49.007\nSo we're gonna worry about that later.\n\n151\n00:07:49.007 --> 00:07:54.395\nThe thing I'm gonna worry about now is,\nokay When I come to this keyframe,\n\n152\n00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:57.487\nthat framing is really kinda silly pants.\n\n153\n00:07:57.487 --> 00:08:00.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I've gotta do another parameter,\n\n154\n00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.550\nwhich is the position.\n\n155\n00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.361\nToggle the animation,\nthe position of the beginning is fine.\n\n156\n00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.890\nAnd this is one of my little tricks.\n\n157\n00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.690\nI'm sure other people do it too.\n\n158\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.090\nI will, I know that there's\na key frame right here in scale.\n\n159\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.860\nSo, I'll jump forward to that,\ncome back to the scale parameter, or\n\n160\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.800\nthe position parameter.\n\n161\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.350\nI'll go ahead, in this case,\njust start in changing the position.\n\n162\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.400\nNot adding a key frame.\n\n163\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.200\nOkay, so this is x, this is y.\n\n164\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.750\nSo in the y,\nI wanna kinda move this up a bit.\n\n165\n00:08:35.742 --> 00:08:40.430\nAnd say, this little nub in there,\nnow move it back.\n\n166\n00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.071\nIt's like, okay that's better.\n\n167\n00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:44.536\n[SOUND] Okay, it's better.\n\n168\n00:08:44.536 --> 00:08:49.040\nIt does it that way and it's neat.\n\n169\n00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.770\nAnd that's cool.\n\n170\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.404\n>> That's more like KDB.\n\n171\n00:08:53.404 --> 00:08:58.138\n>> Yeah, so now I'll say, but\nthe movement is a little unnatural.\n\n172\n00:08:58.138 --> 00:08:59.810\nThat scaling is a little unnatural.\n\n173\n00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.233\nWhat can I do about that?\n\n174\n00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:04.280\nGo back to the first key frame.\n\n175\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.850\nOkay, I'm gonna highlight it and\nthen Ctrl + click it.\n\n176\n00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.320\nAnd say all right.\n\n177\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.240\nI can do like a bezier curve or\na bezier handle.\n\n178\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.110\nOkay I can do beziers,\nauto-beziers, continuous beziers.\n\n179\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.480\nYou can learn all about this just by going\ninto the little help thing and all that.\n\n180\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.043\nI'm gonna keep it simple.\n\n181\n00:09:27.043 --> 00:09:34.610\nI'm gonna say I wanna ease this out of\nthis keyframe, and it changes the curve.\n\n182\n00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.800\nOkay it changes that curve, and\nI'm gonna click the other one and\n\n183\n00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.970\nsay, Ease In to that one please.\n\n184\n00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:47.280\nAnd notice it's a nice,\nlittle curvy shape there.\n\n185\n00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.552\nAnd if I do that, [SOUND] see?\n\n186\n00:09:50.552 --> 00:09:56.530\nIt has a little bit more of like a camera,\nlittle hand held camera movement to it.\n\n187\n00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.664\nAnd it sort of matches\nthe previous shots a little bit.\n\n188\n00:10:01.664 --> 00:10:03.856\nI like it, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n189\n00:10:03.856 --> 00:10:06.390\nHe'll say, wow, that is cool.\n\n190\n00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.910\nThat is really cool, I like that.\n\n191\n00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.330\nI'd like to do that on\na bunch of different shots.\n\n192\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.250\nAnd it's like, okay,\nlike if I add in another picture, yeah.\n\n193\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.970\nAnd I'll say okay.\n\n194\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.100\nSo I'll come over here.\n\n195\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.121\n>> So you're saying that basically\nonce we've got all the work done for\n\n196\n00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:25.926\none we can just apply that to [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, I can do another.\n\n197\n00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:26.840\nI can do another.\n\n198\n00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.460\n>> I like it.\n\n199\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.730\n>> Here's how we can do that.\n\n200\n00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.850\n>> You're making me feel good.\n\n201\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.800\n>> Am I making you feel good?\n\n202\n00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.020\nThat's what I like man, I love that.\n\n203\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.960\nSo I'm going to just mark an In Point and\n\n204\n00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.970\nOut Point here, make sure video one is\nin video two, and then do an overwrite.\n\n205\n00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.550\nThere it is, that is way too long.\n\n206\n00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.410\nSo I'll say, you know what?\n\n207\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.785\nI should define that\narea down here instead.\n\n208\n00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:47.465\nI-O.\n\n209\n00:10:47.465 --> 00:10:50.330\nOoh, what will happen\nif I do the overwrite?\n\n210\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.845\nIt'll say hey, four points buddy.\n\n211\n00:10:52.845 --> 00:10:56.262\nAnd I'll say okay,\nignore the Out Point on the source.\n\n212\n00:10:56.262 --> 00:10:59.278\nBoom, puts it in there.\n\n213\n00:11:02.148 --> 00:11:05.512\nGo back, I got that thing.\n\n214\n00:11:05.512 --> 00:11:10.865\nIt's way oversized, so\nI will Ctrl + click it,\n\n215\n00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:14.840\ncome down and say Set to Frame Size.\n\n216\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.114\nBoom, done there.\n\n217\n00:11:16.114 --> 00:11:21.400\nNow, if I come back to\njust this guy right here,\n\n218\n00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.051\nokay, this front one.\n\n219\n00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:25.010\nWhat am I gonna do?\n\n220\n00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.050\nWell, this is the easiest solution.\n\n221\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.724\nI can go to File, I'm sorry, Edit.\n\n222\n00:11:35.724 --> 00:11:36.610\nCome here, where did you go?\n\n223\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.990\nOkay, it's not letting me do it.\n\n224\n00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.470\nCome here, why you got to be that way?\n\n225\n00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.020\nTimeline has to be highlighted.\n\n226\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.460\nIt wasn't highlighted.\n\n227\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.280\nI had the segment highlighted but\nthe timeline has to be active,\n\n228\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.990\nand I'm gonna say, Copy.\n\n229\n00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.206\nNow, when I come over to this one,\nthe new one,\n\n230\n00:11:54.206 --> 00:11:58.962\nevery parameter in here,\nconsider them an attribute.\n\n231\n00:12:02.751 --> 00:12:05.240\nPaste Attributes.\n\n232\n00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.070\nCuz usually if I do a paste, it's gonna\nput the video on top, not this time.\n\n233\n00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.000\nPaste Attributes.\n\n234\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.170\nAnd it will say,\nwhat attribute would you like?\n\n235\n00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.100\nAnd I will say, not opacity,\nit didn't do anything there.\n\n236\n00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.476\nNo time remapping, motion please.\n\n237\n00:12:19.476 --> 00:12:21.405\nClick OK.\n\n238\n00:12:21.405 --> 00:12:26.994\nNow, [SOUND] does the exact same thing.\n\n239\n00:12:26.994 --> 00:12:28.610\nSo that's a Paste Attributes.\n\n240\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.758\nThe other option is this [SOUND].\n\n241\n00:12:32.758 --> 00:12:35.420\nWhat if I'm gonna do this again and\nagain, ad infinitum.\n\n242\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.150\nMaybe in another project.\n\n243\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.560\nMaybe another timeline, whatever.\n\n244\n00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.670\nI'm going to highlight the motion\nparameter up here in the Edit Control.\n\n245\n00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.903\nJust gonna highlight that parameter,\n\n246\n00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:52.887\nCtrl + click it and say Save Preset.\n\n247\n00:12:52.887 --> 00:12:59.971\nAnd I'm going to say Ease, or\nno, I'm gonna say zoom in.\n\n248\n00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:06.824\nAnd in the description I might say,\n\n249\n00:13:06.824 --> 00:13:10.936\nZooms in on photos and\n\n250\n00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:15.750\nEase Out Ease In, okay.\n\n251\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:21.360\nNow it says Type, Scale,\nAnchor to In Point, Anchor to Out Point.\n\n252\n00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:27.340\nHonestly I would say about 99% of\nthe time Scale is what you're gonna do.\n\n253\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.640\nWhat does that mean?\n\n254\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.690\nWell I dropped in two keyframes,\nactually four, position and scale.\n\n255\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.686\nAnd let's say this clip is like,\nfive seconds long.\n\n256\n00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:42.765\nIt If I put this preset on something\nnow that is two seconds long,\n\n257\n00:13:42.765 --> 00:13:46.555\nit's going to scale the key\nframes to the length of it.\n\n258\n00:13:47.605 --> 00:13:49.935\nIf I say, anchor it to the In Point,\n\n259\n00:13:49.935 --> 00:13:54.951\nit's gonna keep, it's like okay, you want\nme to put five seconds into two seconds.\n\n260\n00:13:54.951 --> 00:13:57.781\nAfter the two seconds from the beginning,\n\n261\n00:13:57.781 --> 00:14:02.980\nit's gonna cut off whatever key\nframes are after the two seconds.\n\n262\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.750\nOr if I do it from the Out Point,\nit's like, whatever is behind it.\n\n263\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.480\nSo that's like most of\nthe time we do scale.\n\n264\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.700\nAll right, so once I've got\nthat all complete, I click OK.\n\n265\n00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.670\nAnd you're like all right, now what?\n\n266\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:24.954\nI'll come down here to the project area,\nclick the Overflow menu, and say Effects.\n\n267\n00:14:24.954 --> 00:14:29.570\nBring this up and you'll notice\nthere's a thing that says presets.\n\n268\n00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.660\nIf I come in here, there I am, zoom in.\n\n269\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.458\nAnd this is saved in a particular\nfile that we're gonna address\n\n270\n00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:38.096\nmore toward the end.\n\n271\n00:14:38.096 --> 00:14:39.416\nOkay, when we get close to export and\nall that,\n\n272\n00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:40.604\nit's like where is this, all this stuff?\n\n273\n00:14:40.604 --> 00:14:42.135\nWhat if I wanna trade it with somebody?\n\n274\n00:14:42.135 --> 00:14:45.843\nWhat if I'm gonna, well, technically, if\nI want to give it to somebody, all I have\n\n275\n00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:49.530\nto say is Ctrl+click and say Export\nPresetz and somebody could use that, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.950\nI could also create a new\nbin that's all my stuff.\n\n277\n00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:58.050\nI could say My Cool Presets Yeah!\n\n278\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.224\nOkay, terrible name,\nbut hey, why not, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:03.224 --> 00:15:07.973\nAnd once I'd put that in there,\ncome here you, [SOUND] all right?\n\n280\n00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.790\nIt's gonna be in there,\ndid I put it in Mosaics or something?\n\n281\n00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.750\nThere it is, okay,\nI can say hey, you know what?\n\n282\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.510\nLet's put that in there.\n\n283\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.390\nSo now, it's in My Cool Presets, and I can\norganize all the stuff that I've done.\n\n284\n00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.460\nAnd then all I have to do,\nthis isn't going to look very good\n\n285\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.030\nbecause this was done for a picture,\nbut I'm gonna drag it on a video.\n\n286\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.070\nAll I have to do is pick it up and\ndrag it and boom.\n\n287\n00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.230\nAnd now it does it right on.\n\n288\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:33.989\n[SOUND] Okay, and\nthat's going to look absolutely awful.\n\n289\n00:15:33.989 --> 00:15:35.550\nNow-\n>> It's a new style of film.\n\n290\n00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.320\n>> It's a new style.\n\n291\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.700\nIt's great, I mean it's weird.\n\n292\n00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.457\n>> Very avant garde\n>> It's very avant-garde.\n\n293\n00:15:39.457 --> 00:15:41.623\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I could do this, Ctrl+Click and\n\n294\n00:15:41.623 --> 00:15:44.561\nsay that was terrible,\nremove the attributes.\n\n295\n00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:46.794\nAnd I could say, please remove the motion.\n\n296\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.770\nBoom, so that means I don't have\nto do Go into effects controls.\n\n297\n00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.478\nI can just remove the attribute,\nwhich is nice.\n\n298\n00:15:55.478 --> 00:16:00.050\nNow, what if want to do cool things?\n\n299\n00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.490\nIt's like but there's so\nmany cool effects.\n\n300\n00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.700\nIt's like yes there are.\n\n301\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.300\nSo let's do something to sprinkler flower.\n\n302\n00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.680\nLet me go back over to effects,\nclick on this.\n\n303\n00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.470\nWhat do I have available to me.\n\n304\n00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.450\nAll kinds of things.\n\n305\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.730\nWe're gonna talk about lumetri presets\nwhen we get in to color correction.\n\n306\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.200\nHow we can use these as\ntechnically a form of LUT.\n\n307\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.100\nUnder video affects we have adjustments.\n\n308\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.350\nOkay, levels.\n\n309\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.870\nIf you've ever used Photoshop before,\nyou have things like levels.\n\n310\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.550\nAnd a lot of people say I know\nwhat those are, I can use those.\n\n311\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.400\nBlur and sharpen.\n\n312\n00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.500\nGaussian blur is the one\nthat everybody goes to.\n\n313\n00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.510\nGaussian blur,\neverything is going to be great.\n\n314\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.050\nChannels, this will deal a lot with color.\n\n315\n00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.639\nYou have distortions, corner pinning,\nlens distortions, magnifies, mirrors.\n\n316\n00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.507\nSome ones that you are going\nto end up using a lot, okay.\n\n317\n00:16:51.222 --> 00:16:54.703\nOne of the things that you don't ever,\nyou know you can actually find things,\n\n318\n00:16:54.703 --> 00:16:57.050\nit's like what don't I have,\nwhere's cropping?\n\n319\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.520\nOkay, there's Crop,\nthat's under Transform.\n\n320\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.840\nOkay and you can do search and\n\n321\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.710\nsay I remember I thought in motion\neffects there was crop there.\n\n322\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.890\nEverybody thinks crop's there.\n\n323\n00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.530\nNo, it's an effect and\nyou have to get crop in transform.\n\n324\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:14.300\n>> Does Premiere come with a full set of\ndifferent effects, or could you go out and\n\n325\n00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.300\nget third party ones?\n\n326\n00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.250\n>> Absolutely you can get some great\nthird party ones from places like and\n\n327\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.160\nall those places.\n\n328\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.950\nAnd you can get a lot of those and\nuse those in here as well.\n\n329\n00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.840\nBut these are the ones\nthat kinda come standard.\n\n330\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.690\nYou can do clip names and time codes,\nif you need to do burn in time code dubs.\n\n331\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.880\nYou have simeon converters, transitions,\ngradient wipes, transforms,\n\n332\n00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.210\ncrops, edge clippers,\nvertical flip, horizontal flip.\n\n333\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.810\nYou might find yourself\nusing this one quite a bit.\n\n334\n00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:46.110\nLike, let's say that everything\nis shot at the exact same.\n\n335\n00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:49.390\nEverybody's positioned on the left or\neverything's positioned on the flip.\n\n336\n00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:54.400\nYou might want to say, okay,\nlet me go ahead and flip that.\n\n337\n00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.710\nOkay, so there's horizontal and\nthere's vertical.\n\n338\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.450\nAnd you can do both so\nyou can flip flop it.\n\n339\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.020\nAnd people will say, why would I do that?\n\n340\n00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.030\nI have done the thing before why\npeople say, hey turn that camera off.\n\n341\n00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.500\nOkay, and I turn it upside down.\n\n342\n00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.550\nAnd they say, why would I shoot\nanything,the camera is upside down.\n\n343\n00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.660\nIt's totally unethical but\nI've done it before.\n\n344\n00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.270\nAnd then I come in and I horizontal\nflip it, and I vertical flip it.\n\n345\n00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.708\nOkay, but I'm not doing anything wrong.\n\n346\n00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:21.090\nIt's probably somebody just being really\nmean to me, so I'm like yeah, why not?\n\n347\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.260\nAnd then I just add both of those.\n\n348\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.760\nPicture's right, and I'm a happy guy.\n\n349\n00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.730\nLet's play around with my favorite though,\nwhich is definitely Gaussian blur.\n\n350\n00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.410\nEverybody loves Gaussian blur, why?\n\n351\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.840\nBecause it's just neat and\nfun to play with.\n\n352\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.100\nSo I will take it, find it,\ndrag it right on top of Sprinkler Flower.\n\n353\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.240\nOkay, and then all I have to\ndo is scale up the blurriness.\n\n354\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.945\nThere it is and it is nice and blurry.\n\n355\n00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:48.217\n[CROSSTALK] And I have had some fun.\n\n356\n00:18:48.217 --> 00:18:52.880\nnotice it's key framable, so\nI can go from sharp to tubulary.\n\n357\n00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:59.120\nI also, this is new, it use to be if I\nneeded to reset this that's what these do.\n\n358\n00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.900\nAnd I could only reset the entire effect,\nand then Adobe was like,\n\n359\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.310\nclearly that's upsetting a lot of people.\n\n360\n00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:13.090\nSo we will do it so\nyou can reset each individual parameter.\n\n361\n00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.950\nAnd it's okay, so\nnow I'm back to where I was.\n\n362\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.700\nI can say, you know what,\nI only want to blur the flower.\n\n363\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.760\nThe flower has committed a crime and\nis testifying on all of his friends.\n\n364\n00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.770\nAnd I need to do that.\n\n365\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.890\nAnd so mask path, mass feather and all\nthis, and I'll kick up the blurriness and\n\n366\n00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.950\nit only affects in there.\n\n367\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.040\n>> The flower is a rat.\n\n368\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.260\n>> The flower is a rat.\n\n369\n00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.040\nSo Joey the flower is a rat.\n\n370\n00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:46.820\nInteresting thing is if I'm using\nthese new things here, okay?\n\n371\n00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:52.120\nAnd this moves, I actually have\nthe ability to track this mask.\n\n372\n00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.690\nIf the flower moves, I can say,\n\n373\n00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.660\nokay, let me track that forward, and\nit's going to follow the flower.\n\n374\n00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.650\nIt takes a little bit,\ngets a little upset, but it will do it,\n\n375\n00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.970\nit will track it forward.\n\n376\n00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.960\nAnd it will make a ton of key frames and\n\n377\n00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.680\nthen you can adjust individual key\nframes when it comes out, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.570\nI'm gonna get rid of this mask for now.\n\n379\n00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:16.475\nBut you have those and now I just\nhave this giant blurriness of 82%.\n\n380\n00:20:16.475 --> 00:20:21.880\nOnce again, that is a parameter, or\n\n381\n00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.100\nan attribute, that I can copy and\nput to other things.\n\n382\n00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.490\nOr, I can take this,\nI can stack a lot of effects.\n\n383\n00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.310\nLet me do another one, okay?\n\n384\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.520\nThere's blur and sharpen.\n\n385\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.710\nLet me just do a color correction.\n\n386\n00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.580\nLet me do a tint.\n\n387\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.340\n>> I just realized,\n\n388\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.950\nwe've been walking around with Gaussian\nblur set on our eyeballs false, and so.\n\n389\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.892\n>> Exactly [CROSSTALK].\n\n390\n00:20:41.892 --> 00:20:43.510\n>> I made it black and white.\n\n391\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.450\nSo that just made it black and white.\n\n392\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.080\nAnd it's like, I love that, why?\n\n393\n00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.540\nI don't know.\nLet me kick the Gaussian blur back.\n\n394\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.510\nAnd so you say, that looks like Phil.\n\n395\n00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.170\nIt's like, okay, sure, it looks like Phil.\n\n396\n00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.210\nWhy not?\n\n397\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.545\nI can take the Gaussian blur,\ncommand click the tint.\n\n398\n00:20:58.545 --> 00:21:04.060\n>> Ctrl+click that and save that as\na preset of the blur and the tint.\n\n399\n00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.450\nIf I had a motion parameter on it,\nI could do the motion, the gauge and\n\n400\n00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:12.060\nblur, and the tint, and\nsave that as an entire preset.\n\n401\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.730\nOkay, I could save that.\n\n402\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.650\nWhole entire thing and\nput it on things in the future.\n\n403\n00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.130\nFuture projects, timelines, whatever.\n\n404\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:26.370\nSo I have that ability to put\nmultiple effects together and\n\n405\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.340\nwith a motion parameter.\n\n406\n00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.030\n>> That's really cool then.\n\n407\n00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.790\nOnce you create an effect you really\nlike and obviously as a storyteller and\n\n408\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.070\nsomeone that's editing your own work,\nyou're gonna come up with a style\n\n409\n00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.650\nof things that you like and now you\ncan re-use them over and over again.\n\n410\n00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.350\nYou don't have to re-invent the wheel.\n\n411\n00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.540\nYou just grab your predecessors\nyou created and apply the effect.\n\n412\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.790\n>> Exactly, now here's the one.\n\n413\n00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.110\nHere's the one that everybody's like,\nonce I show them this,\n\n414\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:53.210\nthey're like all right, so\ntwo sides to every story.\n\n415\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.490\nTwo sides to every segment.\n\n416\n00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.370\nWatch this.\n\n417\n00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.620\nI'm going to turn off the eyeball in V2 so\nI can't see what's above it.\n\n418\n00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.830\nI can still work on it,\nbut I still can't see it.\n\n419\n00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.340\nVideo 1,\nI'm going to come down to this, of me.\n\n420\n00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.600\nAnd let's face it.\n\n421\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.500\nI shot it so it was too bright.\n\n422\n00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.080\nI shot it so it was too bright.\n\n423\n00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.360\nWas I did was I cut up this clip and\nput it in the timeline.\n\n424\n00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:22.910\nSo, Right now it is saying okay.\n\n425\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.430\nYou have highlighted\nthis in the sequence and\n\n426\n00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.230\nyou are looking at the segment\nthat you'd use in the sequence.\n\n427\n00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.260\nThat's why it's blue.\n\n428\n00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.070\nWhat is this off to the left?\n\n429\n00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.150\nWait, left side.\n\n430\n00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.280\nRight side.\n\n431\n00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.660\nIf I click this, it is saying,\n\n432\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.250\nall right, you would like to\naffect the source clip now.\n\n433\n00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.680\nIt's like, yes, I would.\n\n434\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.660\nIt's like,\nwhat would you like to do to it?\n\n435\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.820\nI will say, I'm just going to\ndo a brightness and contrast.\n\n436\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.070\nDown here.\n\n437\n00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.920\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nfind it down here in color correction.\n\n438\n00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.820\nI'm gonna click on it and drag it up.\n\n439\n00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.400\nAnd it has a little plus sign, boom.\n\n440\n00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:16.660\nAnd I'm gonna say, all right,\nlet's do the brightness, yeah, way up.\n\n441\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.870\nThat's good.\n>> That looks nice.\n\n442\n00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:18.650\n>> That's even better.\n\n443\n00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:19.720\n>> I like that.\n\n444\n00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.880\n>> I love that.\n\n445\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.870\nDo that, adjust some of the contrasts,\nand there you go.\n\n446\n00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.360\nI like that a little bit better.\n\n447\n00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.640\nNow the interesting part is because\nI placed this on the source clip,\n\n448\n00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.930\nit has done every single one in here.\n\n449\n00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.560\nI didn't have to do them individually, and\n\n450\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.198\nbecause this was cut from\nthe source clip they're all done.\n\n451\n00:23:46.198 --> 00:23:49.741\n>> You actually answered a question I was\ngonna ask you which is why are we doing it\n\n452\n00:23:49.741 --> 00:23:52.450\nto the source and not to-\n>> Right So it's, wait a minute,\n\n453\n00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.407\nI've used that source multiple times.\n\n454\n00:23:54.407 --> 00:24:00.850\nIf I put an effect on it,\nit'll go in there every single time.\n\n455\n00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.940\nI could add an individual effect to this.\n\n456\n00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.680\nI simply go back here and say what?\n\n457\n00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.610\nWell, I, well, let's go to my good friend.\n\n458\n00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.107\nI'll just type in G-A-U-S.\n\n459\n00:24:10.107 --> 00:24:10.814\nGasu?\n\n460\n00:24:10.814 --> 00:24:12.495\nNo, G-A-U-S.\n\n461\n00:24:12.495 --> 00:24:15.790\nGaussian blur, Gaussian blur,\nGaussian blur, there you are.\n\n462\n00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.810\nBoom, drop it just on the segment.\n\n463\n00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.110\nYou drop that in the timeline.\n\n464\n00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.160\nKick up the blurriness on that.\n\n465\n00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.790\nIf I come back down here,\nthis is the only one that has it.\n\n466\n00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.260\nAll the rest of them have the effect\nthat I put on the source clip.\n\n467\n00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.110\nCould I do this before I\nput it into the timeline?\n\n468\n00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.700\nAbsolutely.\n\n469\n00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.710\nI could have loaded something\nin the source clip and\n\n470\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.540\ndrug it up to the source clip.\n\n471\n00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:42.010\nBut in this case, since I know I used\nthis multiple times, there we go.\n\n472\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.240\nSo, the blurriness is\nthe only thing I used here.\n\n473\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.190\nSo that's why some people\nwill say wait a minute.\n\n474\n00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:53.150\nBut there's clearly\nsomething on all of these,\n\n475\n00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.690\nthat's why you have this other side.\n\n476\n00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.310\nThat's why you can say, wait a minute,\nthere's an effect here.\n\n477\n00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.960\nIs it on the source clip?\n\n478\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.750\nYes it is.\n\n479\n00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.565\nAnd that way I can say,\n\n480\n00:25:02.565 --> 00:25:07.070\nokay, let me get rid of that Gaussian\nblur on here, just the segment itself.\n\n481\n00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.160\nAnd there you are.\n\n482\n00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.260\nSo you can affect individual\nsegments within the actual sequence.\n\n483\n00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.190\nAnd you can, in fact, source clips.\n\n484\n00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.330\nAnd yes, see?\n\n485\n00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.010\nI did this.\n\n486\n00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.420\nLook it, boom, brightness and\ncontrast, control click.\n\n487\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.110\nI can save that preset.\n\n488\n00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.730\nJust because it is in a source clip\ndoesn't mean I can't save the preset.\n\n489\n00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.620\nI can save it as a preset\nonce I have adjusted it.\n\n490\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.900\nThat is absolutely not a problem.\n\n491\n00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.380\nOne thing I do want to address\nreal quick before we go,\n\n492\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.960\nI was adjusting each individual parameter.\n\n493\n00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:51.130\nSome people say I use other applications,\nand they have a wire frame, and I miss it.\n\n494\n00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.350\nDoesn't this have it?\n\n495\n00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.710\nAnd I'll say wait, what's that?\n\n496\n00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.240\nWell, of course, we have fx,\nif we turn it off and\n\n497\n00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.026\non, that turns the effect on and off,\nso you can see it with or without.\n\n498\n00:26:02.026 --> 00:26:04.260\nI am going to come over here,\n\n499\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.380\nwe address this whole why would I\nwant to not fit this to window?\n\n500\n00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.010\nWell, sometimes I want to zoom in,\nsometimes I want to zoom back.\n\n501\n00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.600\nWhy?\n\n502\n00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:20.230\nBecause if I just highlight motion,\nthere's my wireframe.\n\n503\n00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:24.530\nAnd people are like I love the wireframe,\nbecause then I can do the scale this way.\n\n504\n00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.380\nAnd I can do the rotation this way.\n\n505\n00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.680\nReally?\nAnd then I can move it.\n\n506\n00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.690\nYou are the best.\n\n507\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.630\nSo yes.\n\n508\n00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.560\nI can do that, and\njust crank the homeless printer.\n\n509\n00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.400\nSome people absolutely love the wireframe.\n\n510\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.060\nAnd all you have to do is click\non the actual motion itself, and\n\n511\n00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:43.890\nyou get the wireframe.\n\n512\n00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.800\nThat's what this little symbol means.\n\n513\n00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.940\nIt's like, click on me,\nand you get the wireframe.\n\n514\n00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.349\nIf you go to the individual parameters,\nI go away.\n\n515\n00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.620\nThat sometimes answers the mysterious\nquestion of is there a wireframe?\n\n516\n00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.720\nIs there not a wireframe?\n\n517\n00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.190\nJust remember when you do this,\nyou have to set it back to fit, or\n\n518\n00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.180\nyou're like wait, it scaled up too much.\n\n519\n00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.590\nNo, you adjusted the fit.\n\n520\n00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.800\nSo I hope that encourages people\nto really go in there and\n\n521\n00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.540\ndo something crazy stuff with effects.\n\n522\n00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.430\nAnd now you know how to control\nthe My Key Frames, you know how to stack,\n\n523\n00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:17.280\nadd more, it's like I'm going to put\na bunch on there, and then save it,\n\n524\n00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.090\ndo it as a preset, keyframes are nothing,\nI just want to go from here to here, and\n\n525\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.510\ndoes what it does.\n\n526\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.900\nHere's one last cool thing that\na lot of people ask me about\n\n527\n00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.870\nis what if I want to do that\nthing where I zoom in real quick?\n\n528\n00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:36.960\nAnd it's, yes, I know what you mean, okay?\n\n529\n00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.610\nI know exactly what you mean.\n\n530\n00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.800\nFirst of all, I'm going to go back to Set.\n\n531\n00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.970\nI think I blew out everything.\n\n532\n00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.480\nSo I believe I have to set the frame size.\n\n533\n00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.374\nYep, what if I want to do something?\n\n534\n00:27:46.374 --> 00:27:47.740\nYeah, I loved 24.\n\n535\n00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:54.440\nAnd people will say, hey, do I have to\nmake a cut and then zoom one or the other?\n\n536\n00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.870\nTry it with keyframes.\n\n537\n00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:56.840\nThis is a lot of fun.\n\n538\n00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.570\nWe did a thing where we zoomed in.\n\n539\n00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.159\nWatch this.\n\n540\n00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.710\nI will do a scale parameter on this one,\nokay?\n\n541\n00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:07.650\nI'm going to come here and\nI will activate scale.\n\n542\n00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.010\nThere's one at the beginning.\n\n543\n00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.250\nAnd then here, all right?\n\n544\n00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.230\nI will kick the scale up to,\nI'll just say there,\n\n545\n00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.530\nnot going to mess with position right now.\n\n546\n00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.510\nAnd it's It's linear.\n\n547\n00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.180\nAgain, it defaults to linear.\n\n548\n00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.380\nSo, I'll zoom in and I'll say okay.\n\n549\n00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:30.306\nWe're going to control click\non the first key frame, and\n\n550\n00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:36.490\nsay hold, and that's going to\nhold its value on the first one.\n\n551\n00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:40.060\nOkay.\nAnd then this second one\n\n552\n00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.190\nshould follow suit.\n\n553\n00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.910\nSo now, it should look like this.\n\n554\n00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.980\nHi, I'm Jim Middle, and\nI'm currently training you right now.\n\n555\n00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.360\nSo now, you get that effect where it's\nlike you don't have to cut anything.\n\n556\n00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.320\nYou just do key frames, and you zoom in,\nzoom out, zoom back, and all that.\n\n557\n00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.730\nIt's kind of virtual camera-ish,\nall right?\n\n558\n00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.740\nSo that way it's, we only had one camera.\n\n559\n00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.490\nHow do we make it look like we had two?\n\n560\n00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:07.010\nWell, then I could also take the position\nand I could move it over slightly.\n\n561\n00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.450\nI could make the wider shot look centered,\nand\n\n562\n00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.480\nmake the other one look\nslightly to the right or left.\n\n563\n00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.750\nAnd then I can save the preset and\njust pop it on other things and\n\n564\n00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.500\nsave myself a bunch of time.\n\n565\n00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.500\nSo think about this, you work smarter.\n\n566\n00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.130\nYou learn just a few things,\nyou work smarter, and it's this and that,\n\n567\n00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:29.243\nI'll just do this,\nespecially if it's just do this, do that.\n\n568\n00:29:29.243 --> 00:29:31.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there you go, really cool.\n\n569\n00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.530\nNo lightsabers, sorry.\n\n570\n00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.250\nNo lightsaber, but\nI think this is pretty cool.\n\n571\n00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:38.380\nI mean, I did reference 24.\n\n572\n00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.190\n>> You did.\n\n573\n00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.130\n>> So I mean,\na little Jack Bauer action there.\n\n574\n00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.050\n>> Yeah, you might not tell us\nhow to do lightsaber action.\n\n575\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:49.090\nBut you did teach us how to make\nour stuff look professional,\n\n576\n00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.130\nand that is probably more important.\n\n577\n00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.656\nI know light sabers are fun, but-\n>> I need to go to\n\n578\n00:29:52.656 --> 00:29:53.720\nthe lightsaber dark side.\n\n579\n00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.618\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n580\n00:29:54.618 --> 00:29:56.510\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm so sorry.\n\n581\n00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.070\nCool.\n\n582\n00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:01.460\nSo that is visual effects in a nut shell,\nand you can get in there and\n\n583\n00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.350\nplay around with them, blend them out,\nsee how they work, and\n\n584\n00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:08.630\nhave a great, just have a great,\ngood fun time with visual effects.\n\n585\n00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:09.290\n>> Awesome stuff, Jim.\n\n586\n00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.530\nWe appreciate you showing us how\nto work with these effects and\n\n587\n00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.890\nall the awesome demonstrations\nas you showed as well.\n\n588\n00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:15.830\n>> Well, thank you friend.\n\n589\n00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:16.810\n>> Yeah, well, that being said,\n\n590\n00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.420\nit looks like we've come to\nthe end of another episode.\n\n591\n00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.730\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it,\nhope you learned a little bit.\n\n592\n00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.900\nWe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n593\n00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.670\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Laurie.\n\n594\n00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.290\n>> I'm James Middle.\n\n595\n00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.196\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n596\n00:30:27.196 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.820\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.600\nIn today's episode, we continue on\nwith our Adobe Premier Pro series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.390\nJoining us back in the studio is the\nPremier Pro master himself, that's right,\n\n6\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.150\nMr. James Biddle.\n\n7\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.739\nJames, Welcome back.\n\n8\n00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.001\n>> No pressure there,\nI'm gonna make mistakes, yes I do.\n\n9\n00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.840\n>> You are gonna crash\nhard in this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.537\n>> As soon as you, yeah.\n\n11\n00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:34.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just boom.\n\n12\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.010\n>> As soon as you start making mistakes\nin Adobe, you have joined the club.\n\n13\n00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.062\nIf you claim you've never made a mistake,\ngo away.\n\n14\n00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:41.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean it's like I\n\n15\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.300\nmake mistakes all the time.\n\n16\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.150\nAll right, so transitions now,\nwow, dissolved 3D cube spins,\n\n17\n00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.300\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n18\n00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.970\nHow do we do that?\n\n19\n00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.160\nCan I add multiple\ntransitions at the same time?\n\n20\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.690\nAbsolutely.\n\n21\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.060\nWe're gonna explore it and it's not\na very long lesson, but I will try and\n\n22\n00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.150\nget as dense as possible as the things\nthat you can do with transitions and\n\n23\n00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.850\nmake your life a little bit easier.\n\n24\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.030\nSo we're going back to the old interface.\n\n25\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.650\nI love it, it makes me feel so good.\n\n26\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.330\nOkay.\n\n27\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.370\nCouple things I wanna address.\n\n28\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.090\nHere's something neat.\n\n29\n00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:13.590\nIf I go back up to the top here,\nwhat's that mean?\n\n30\n00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.920\nWhat's the little asterisk mean?\n\n31\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.490\nI bet if I come over here and\ngo save, I bet it goes away.\n\n32\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.030\nIf you have an asterisk up in this\nline right here, right at the end,\n\n33\n00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.810\nit's kind of like warning you,\nyou haven't saved in a while..\n\n34\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.873\nAnd if things go [SOUND] you may lose it,\n\n35\n00:01:30.873 --> 00:01:34.432\nespecially if you don't have your\nauto-save set a certain way.\n\n36\n00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:38.020\nSo that's just a little reminder, it's\nlike whoop, I think I'll do a command or\n\n37\n00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.380\nCtrl-S depending on your operating system.\n\n38\n00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.910\nOr just go to File, Save and\n\n39\n00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.700\nSave, and\neverything will be happy pants okay.\n\n40\n00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.650\nThis is one of the new\nthings I like in Adobe.\n\n41\n00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.440\nYou always have Save As,\nyou can save as and give it a new name.\n\n42\n00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.100\nThey have save a copy now,\nyou can just save a copy of it.\n\n43\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.170\nIt's really cool.\n\n44\n00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.370\nI mean, they really thought about\na lot of these things especially with\n\n45\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.020\nthe save protocol.\n\n46\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.980\n>> Why have we not had that\nin other stuff before now?\n\n47\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.940\nThat's a smart idea.\n\n48\n00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.860\n>> I don't know, I'm telling ya.\n\n49\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.260\nThey think of these things.\n\n50\n00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.320\nAll right, so hit it and tell the key and\ngo into the time line here.\n\n51\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.760\nI've added a few more things.\n\n52\n00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.660\nNow I've added this clip\ncalled Bird House to the end.\n\n53\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.190\nAnd what I wanna do,\nkind of move forward here,\n\n54\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.840\nit doesn't really matter where it ends.\n\n55\n00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.980\nBut I'll say, you know what,\nI wanna do that cool W trick, and\n\n56\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.910\nthen just get rid from\nhere to the point ahead.\n\n57\n00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.210\nAll the way to that back\nend that I don't need.\n\n58\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.680\nDo not want to effect Video One,\nA1, or A2.\n\n59\n00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.570\nSo logically,\nI'm thinking Video Two is activated.\n\n60\n00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.320\nIf I go ahead and hit W.\n\n61\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.870\nWait a minute.\n\n62\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.140\nWhy did it do that?\n\n63\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.930\nAnd like I said, always Command Z or\n\n64\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.140\nControl Z depending on your\noperating system and go back.\n\n65\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.680\nWhy does it do that?\n\n66\n00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.930\nI have followed all of your rules!\n\n67\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.700\nHow have you done this?\n\n68\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.910\nWell, there's one more thing in\nthe header that sometimes you need to pay\n\n69\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.620\nattention to.\n\n70\n00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.050\nI'm gonna zoom into it.\n\n71\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.540\nAnd a lot of people,\n\n72\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.940\nif they have never worked with film you\nwould never even know what this is.\n\n73\n00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.570\nBack when I was in school,\nI think when I was in school,\n\n74\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.560\nI don't remember a lot of it,\nwe worked with film.\n\n75\n00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.190\nAnd they had sprockets, and\nwhen you wanted to roll the audio and\n\n76\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.540\nvideos all at the same time,\nyou loaded them in the sprockets.\n\n77\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.840\nYou locked it in the sync and\n\n78\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.040\nyou turn the little knob and\neverything rolled together.\n\n79\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.910\nOkay?\n\n80\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.970\nOccasionally, you would\ntake things like Titles and\n\n81\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.610\nmaybe not put it in sync like\nwhen you would remove something.\n\n82\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.240\nYou wanted it to stay in a certain\nplace and it would stay there.\n\n83\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.980\nSo we have these things called sync locks.\n\n84\n00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.990\nOk?\nSo I go back to the interface,\n\n85\n00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.950\nthese are the sync locks, all right?\n\n86\n00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.990\nAnd right now this is the weird part.\n\n87\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.590\nThey're not in blue so they're active.\n\n88\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.980\nIf I click it it'll say okay,\nthis is no longer in sync.\n\n89\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.890\nWhat I do actions, they do not have to\nmove left to right in sync together.\n\n90\n00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.920\nSo now that I have taken them out\nof sync and only V2 is activated,\n\n91\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.900\nI can say W and there it is.\n\n92\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.070\nNow, you'll say, that's an awful lot.\n\n93\n00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:26.540\nSometimes when you get toward the finish\npoints of something, you have to\n\n94\n00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.260\nget into these more detailed tools so you\ndon't blow up what you already finished.\n\n95\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.390\nI kinda call it the Swiss watch rule,\nokay.\n\n96\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.600\nWhen you get close to finish, all the\ngears are starting to fit really tight and\n\n97\n00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.190\nit's getting really in there,\nand if you change something,\n\n98\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.270\nyou gotta kinda go back and\nchange everything else.\n\n99\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.140\nIn the beginning it's more like\na Casio watch, you can step on it, but\n\n100\n00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.960\nthe time you put the plastic back\ntogether, and take a lighter and\n\n101\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.110\nit works just fine, that's great.\n\n102\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.320\nOnce you get into the Swiss watch area,\n\n103\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.170\nyou're gonna have to start digging\ninto more precision tools, and\n\n104\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.210\nsometimes that means you've gotta get\ninto something like the sync lock.\n\n105\n00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.973\nI'll just take a shift and turn them all\noff or turn them all back on, audio and\n\n106\n00:05:04.973 --> 00:05:07.440\nvideo across the board.\n\n107\n00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.000\nThe reason why I did this is I'm\nsetting myself up to fail, as in,\n\n108\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.650\nI'm going to start adding transitions, and\n\n109\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.280\nI wanna show what happens if in some\ncases you don't have what we call handle.\n\n110\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.500\nAs in what is handle?\n\n111\n00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.520\nI'll take this first one, the sprinkler,\nand I'll double click it.\n\n112\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.530\nNotice, the area that I am using\nis the endpoint to the out point.\n\n113\n00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.540\nOn either side of it,\nthere is more associated with the clip.\n\n114\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.900\nSo, that means outside the in and\nout points, it is recognizing the timeline\n\n115\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.160\nthat I have handle that can be used\nto make transitions or do trimming.\n\n116\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.260\nIf I don't have that, you can run\ninto a problem with transitions.\n\n117\n00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.180\nSo I have it there.\n\n118\n00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.690\nGot it on the banana.\n\n119\n00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.450\nSo, if I decide to add a transition here,\n\n120\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.780\nI should be fine,\ncuz I've got enough handle.\n\n121\n00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.730\nSo, what are the methods\nby which I can do this?\n\n122\n00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.520\nI could do the drag-and-drop method.\n\n123\n00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.360\nJust come over here.\n\n124\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.675\nOpen up my effects.\n\n125\n00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:12.880\nTilde my way in.\n\n126\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.004\nGo to Video Transitions, and\nI have all kinds of weird things.\n\n127\n00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:20.761\nDissolve, Additive Dissolve,\nCross Dissolve, Dip to black,\n\n128\n00:06:20.761 --> 00:06:22.887\nDip to White, Film Style Dissolve.\n\n129\n00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:26.884\nYou can read some literature on how all of\nthese work or you can just take a look at\n\n130\n00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:29.865\nthem and see how when you get\nout of the minutia of all this.\n\n131\n00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:33.370\nI even have this thing called Morph Cut,\nthat we're gonna use a little bit later.\n\n132\n00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.270\nIt's gonna be really cool.\n\n133\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.850\nAs we get towards the end\nwe are gonna use Morph Cut.\n\n134\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:36.520\nOkay.\n\n135\n00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.140\nCube spins, flip-overs.\n\n136\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.620\nYou can say what's the blue thing?\n\n137\n00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.310\nThe blue thing means this\nis the default transition.\n\n138\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.060\nSo if I use a hotkey to make\nthe default transition for\n\n139\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.470\nvideo it is the cross-dissolve.\n\n140\n00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.990\nLet's say I want it to be the cube spin.\n\n141\n00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.160\nI can Ctrl click on the cube spin and\nsay, set this as the default transition.\n\n142\n00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.500\nNow it's blue.\n\n143\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.670\nIt's the default transition.\n\n144\n00:07:06.327 --> 00:07:11.731\nI'm gonna come back here and\nI'll just take the dissolve.\n\n145\n00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:15.860\nThis cross-dissolve, click and\n\n146\n00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.240\ndrag it in-between these two clips,\njust in-between.\n\n147\n00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.400\nLet me try and zoom in here.\n\n148\n00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:29.190\nOkay, if I drag it, notice it highlights\nboth sides, and I will let go.\n\n149\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.520\nAnd it says,\nyou've put a cross-dissolve there.\n\n150\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.770\nHow do you feel about that?\n\n151\n00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.450\nI feel pretty good.\n\n152\n00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:40.330\nIf I wanna manipulate this in\nthe timeline, I'm just gonna, aha.\n\n153\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.560\nI get a little thing and\nI can actually up the duration.\n\n154\n00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.386\nAnd it's saying it's adding 18 seconds.\n\n155\n00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:50.926\nI'm adding 18 seconds to it.\n\n156\n00:07:50.926 --> 00:07:52.950\nI'm cutting back two seconds.\n\n157\n00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.399\nI wonder how long this was To begin with?\n\n158\n00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:02.645\nIf I click on it,\nI can go to the Effects controls and\n\n159\n00:08:02.645 --> 00:08:06.950\nhere are all the parameters of it.\n\n160\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.940\nI could show the actual sources and\nit will show\n\n161\n00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.120\nme the dissolve that's actually\nhappening or it can just say A and B.\n\n162\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.590\nIt's showing me the time.\n\n163\n00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.760\nIt's showing me it's centered on the cut.\n\n164\n00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.070\nOr I can say it starts on the cut.\n\n165\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.060\nAnd people will say,\nwhy did it move that direction?\n\n166\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.170\nBecause the cut is here and\nthat's where it starts.\n\n167\n00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:31.330\nIf it ends at the cut,\nthen the dissolve ends where the cut is.\n\n168\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.680\nThat's where it seems backward.\n\n169\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.826\nI'm just gonna go with\nyour standard center cut.\n\n170\n00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:42.730\nI'm guessing the original\ntiming on this was 30 seconds.\n\n171\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.590\nHow do I know?\n\n172\n00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.110\nIf I go to Preferences, General.\n\n173\n00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.000\nI'm sorry, not 30 seconds, 30 frames.\n\n174\n00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.340\nI meant to say frames.\n\n175\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.450\nI meant to do that!\n\n176\n00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.610\nYou'll find yourself saying that a lot\nwhen you edit, so I meant to do that and\n\n177\n00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.580\nin your mind it's like I\ndidn't mean to do that.\n\n178\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.000\nSo, it was 30 frames cuz that's\nwhat the default length was set to.\n\n179\n00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.790\nNow let me show you something,\nwhat if I want to change that to 15?\n\n180\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.164\nOkay.\nI have changed it to 15.\n\n181\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.260\nI will hit OK.\n\n182\n00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.960\nThis did not change.\n\n183\n00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:20.850\nThis default lingth is for when you start\ncreating new ones, from here on out.\n\n184\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.080\nIt doesn't affect ones\nthat you've already done.\n\n185\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.700\nOkay?\n\n186\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.514\nYou would have to remove\nthis cross-dissolve like so,\n\n187\n00:09:28.514 --> 00:09:33.910\nhighlight it, hit Delete, it's gone, and\nnow I'll say actually you know what?\n\n188\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:39.560\nI can save myself some time and\njust say, Apply Video Transition and\n\n189\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.800\nit's gonna be the default,\nand it's gonna be 15 seconds.\n\n190\n00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.750\nAnd in this case, I had drug the dissolve.\n\n191\n00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.310\nBut now I have a cube spin.\n\n192\n00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.300\nWhich is way cooler.\n\n193\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:51.800\nYeah.\n\n194\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.840\nYeah, that is not distracting\nfrom the overall story at all.\n\n195\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.750\nThat makes it.\n\n196\n00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.510\nOkay?\n>> And without it, it was just junk.\n\n197\n00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.680\nAnd now, it's a cinematic masterpiece.\n\n198\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.828\n>> Now, it's like Donnie and\nMarie circa 1978.\n\n199\n00:10:04.828 --> 00:10:05.930\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n200\n00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:11.250\n>> All right, if I highlight it now,\nbecause this transition has\n\n201\n00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:15.930\na bit more oomph to it, there are certain\nnew parameters that I could look at.\n\n202\n00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.100\nOkay, so yeah it's 15 seconds, it is that.\n\n203\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.768\nIt also gives me some information.\n\n204\n00:10:21.768 --> 00:10:29.080\nIt will say, the image A spins to reveal\nimage B, mapped onto two faces of a cube.\n\n205\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.560\nAnd you say okay this is one\nof those situations were A and\n\n206\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.220\nB don't quite cut it for\nme can you show me the actual sources.\n\n207\n00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.899\nIt's like okay,\nthere are the actual sources.\n\n208\n00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.710\nI could change the overall duration here.\n\n209\n00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.540\nI could also say,\nright now it says west to east,\n\n210\n00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.240\nnorth to south, east to west,\nthe other one is south to north.\n\n211\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.670\nI'd like to say you know\nwhat I like that and all but\n\n212\n00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.189\nI'd like to go in east to west.\n\n213\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.140\nBoom.\n\n214\n00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:05.980\nSo now it is going east to west, so\nit flips in a different direction.\n\n215\n00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.150\nI can actually say,\nyou know let's do it north to south.\n\n216\n00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.270\nBoom.\n\n217\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.220\nAnd if I come back down here,\ntake a look at it, notice it's now going\n\n218\n00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.330\nnorth to south instead.\n\n219\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.000\nThat's pretty cool, I mean, it's okay.\n\n220\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.700\nYeah.\nBut if you want it to be this visual, for\n\n221\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.660\nthis thing about a garden not so much.\n\n222\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.560\nMaybe if you're doing\nsomething with computers or\n\n223\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.200\nyou want it to be very eye catching\nbecause you need to hold on to somebody,\n\n224\n00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.560\nmaybe something like cube\nspins is a pretty good idea.\n\n225\n00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.840\nI would change the direction\non different ones.\n\n226\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.590\nOkay never mind.\n\n227\n00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.810\n>> It reminds me of after school\nshows from PBS in the 90s.\n\n228\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.760\n>> Exactly, there you go, there you go.\n\n229\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.700\nI can also say, you know what, change,\nI'd say look at this, okay, look at that.\n\n230\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.830\nI will drag my play head over and\nit'll give me some information.\n\n231\n00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.690\nCube spin starts here,\nends there, gives me a duration.\n\n232\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:58.440\nWhat I might do is, I could actually\ndouble-click it, just to do the time.\n\n233\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.935\nAnd I can say, actually make that 30\nframes, boom, and it makes it longer.\n\n234\n00:12:04.935 --> 00:12:07.295\nInstead of having to go all the way\nback to the effects controls, I can say,\n\n235\n00:12:07.295 --> 00:12:09.475\nI just wanna change the time.\n\n236\n00:12:09.475 --> 00:12:10.290\nThat's all I wanna do.\n\n237\n00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.375\nDouble-click and say, all right.\n\n238\n00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:13.205\nLet's make it 45.\n\n239\n00:12:13.205 --> 00:12:14.685\nBoom, okay?\n\n240\n00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.095\nNow it's 45 frames.\n\n241\n00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.130\nAnd it takes a lovely long time.\n\n242\n00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.590\n>> Backyard about a month\nbecause I've been on vacation.\n\n243\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.130\nWe're looking to change it.\n\n244\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.280\n>> That is great.\n\n245\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.290\nWow that is-\n>> Just when I\n\n246\n00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.330\nthought it couldn't get better.\n\n247\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.280\n>> That sparkle motion right there.\n\n248\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.320\nSo I'm gonna get rid of it and\n\n249\n00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.440\nthe thing I will do is I will\nactually make the cross-dissolve.\n\n250\n00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.390\nI'm gonna come back over\nto the Effects window.\n\n251\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:43.200\nAnd make the cross-dissolve,\ncontrol click, the default transition.\n\n252\n00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.485\nNow, we also have audio transitions.\n\n253\n00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:51.130\nCrossbase, we have three, Casa game,\nCasa power, exponential fades, okay?\n\n254\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.720\nSo, we can do audio and\nvideo at the same time if we wanted to.\n\n255\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.230\nSo, we can do them separately,\nwe can do them together.\n\n256\n00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.950\nCase in point,\nlet me come back to this front one here.\n\n257\n00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.990\nOkay I'll come back to the front\nedit here, and let's say for\n\n258\n00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.450\nsome strange reason I want to do.\n\n259\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.040\nAnd I don't have to hit it dead center,\n\n260\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.460\nI can be as just relatively close\nto the edit until the end there.\n\n261\n00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:17.980\nZoom in a bit.\n\n262\n00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.490\nBoom, boom, boom.\n\n263\n00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:26.000\nAnd one thing I do need to do is make\nsure and tell it, Video1, A1, A2 please.\n\n264\n00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.500\nSo it knows what it's\nlooking at when it does this.\n\n265\n00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:37.010\nZoom back out, go to sequence and\nit will say, apply video transition, yup.\n\n266\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.820\nGo back apply, audio transition, yup.\n\n267\n00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.540\nSame thing.\n\n268\n00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.450\nNow, the audio transition\nis only five frames.\n\n269\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.050\nBecause that is the default that I set,\nokay.\n\n270\n00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.660\nThis one is gonna be 30.\n\n271\n00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.510\nThat one is going to be five.\n\n272\n00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.240\nJump back out.\n\n273\n00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.130\nShift K.\n>> Currently training you right now\n\n274\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.150\non Adobe Premiere.\n\n275\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:02.780\nAnd the reason why, notice that\nlittle five frame fade in the audio\n\n276\n00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:10.252\njust sort of smoothed out the audio\njust a little bit and it was happy.\n\n277\n00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:11.500\nSo like a little five frames,\n\n278\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.480\nlittle four frames,\nsometimes it's almost imperceptible.\n\n279\n00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.348\nJust adds a little smoothness to it.\n\n280\n00:14:16.348 --> 00:14:22.660\nSo what could I do to make my life\neasier in that sense, til the end.\n\n281\n00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.760\nZoom back, I can say, okay, you know what?\n\n282\n00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.840\nSince I like that, or\n\n283\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.820\nyou hear somebody that says I love that,\nhow do I do it to everything?\n\n284\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.400\nAnd you go, okay,\nwell actually it's kind of easy.\n\n285\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.610\nZoom in a bit.\n\n286\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.640\nI'm just gonna highlight\nall the other ones.\n\n287\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.570\nI'll just highlight these.\n\n288\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.623\nAnd with them highlighted, say okay,\n\n289\n00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:55.920\nSequence Apply Default Transitions\n\n290\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.430\nto Selection, or Apply Audio Transition.\n\n291\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:07.399\nBoom, and now they all, everything I have\nselected has the fine frame equation.\n\n292\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.195\nWe're looking to change.\n\n293\n00:15:10.195 --> 00:15:12.783\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, now I could do that up here.\n\n294\n00:15:12.783 --> 00:15:16.071\nI have a bunch of pictures now.\n[SOUND] I have a bunch of pictures and\n\n295\n00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:17.951\nI can say, all right.\n\n296\n00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:19.310\nI'm gonna highlight all of them.\n\n297\n00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.130\nSequence.\n\n298\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.920\nApply default transition to selection.\n\n299\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.980\nBoom, did I do that, did I do it?\n\n300\n00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.150\nBoom.\n\n301\n00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:33.670\nOkay, insufficient media.\n\n302\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.600\nThis transition will\ncontain repeated frames.\n\n303\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.976\nWhat does that mean?\n\n304\n00:15:37.976 --> 00:15:43.020\nIf you don't have any handle on your clip,\nas in you're just taking it from\n\n305\n00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:48.407\nthe very front or the very end of the\nsource clip, it's butting up against her.\n\n306\n00:15:48.407 --> 00:15:50.938\nIt's like I have no media, I have nothing.\n\n307\n00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:52.453\nI have no handle.\n\n308\n00:15:52.453 --> 00:15:55.529\nSo Adobe's come up with a thing,\nit's like, we have an idea for you.\n\n309\n00:15:55.529 --> 00:15:59.716\nWhat we'll do is we'll take the last\nframe and just repeat it to\n\n310\n00:15:59.716 --> 00:16:05.040\nmake the transition happen,\ninstead of just saying won't do it.\n\n311\n00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.890\nIt's like, okay, and I will click OK.\n\n312\n00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.050\nHow do I know which one it is?\n\n313\n00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.210\nIt's this one.\n\n314\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:21.370\nWhen you see the hash marks,\nthat means it has used repeated frames.\n\n315\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.550\nIt's on both sides.\n\n316\n00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:29.040\nSo it's saying okay, this side right here,\nthis one gets repeated frames and\n\n317\n00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:34.010\nthis one gets repeated frames\nin order to make this work.\n\n318\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:39.440\nAnd you're like okay,\neverything else is fine and\n\n319\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:46.000\ndandy and has the crosses always on them,\nso let me jump back out.\n\n320\n00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.073\nHere's something, oops, not that.\n\n321\n00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:54.660\nWell, watch this,\nI'm using the up and down arrow keys.\n\n322\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.370\nI am trying to go to cuts, and\n\n323\n00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:02.190\nit's like why is it not going to\nthe head of sprinkler flowers?\n\n324\n00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:08.990\nThat's because V2 is not activated, so if\nV2 is activated, then it sees the edits.\n\n325\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.360\nThat's an interesting thing,\n\n326\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.590\nit's like this is how important\nit is to have tracks highlighted.\n\n327\n00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:19.270\nIf I don't have that highlighted,\nit doesn't see those cuts, and\n\n328\n00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.470\nit's only going to the ones in Video 1,\nA1, and A2.\n\n329\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.370\nTurn that back on,\nnow it will go there, and now I'm happy.\n\n330\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.260\nSo, and so rarely am I happy,\nand I'll just hit Play.\n\n331\n00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.848\n>> I haven't seen my backyard in about\na month because I've been on vacation.\n\n332\n00:17:33.848 --> 00:17:38.126\nWe're looking to change it,\nwe're looking to change up the garden,\n\n333\n00:17:38.126 --> 00:17:42.380\nget rid of the grass, maybe turn\nthe back area into a foragable area.\n\n334\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.840\nSo I'm doing this video, so\nyou can see what it's like to-\n\n335\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.540\n>> Okay, now, is that the weird one?\n\n336\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.200\nWas that the weird one?\n\n337\n00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.860\nI don't know.\n\n338\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.190\nIt is weird, or\nis that just the camera moving there?\n\n339\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.040\nLet's take a look.\n\n340\n00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.380\nNope, just the camera moving there.\n\n341\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.760\nAnd I may wanna edit that.\n\n342\n00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.330\nI can edit behind that if I need to.\n\n343\n00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.640\n>> Make a little video\nthat's about 15 min-\n\n344\n00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.250\n>> All right, now that I'm ready for this,\n\n345\n00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.631\nlet's see how this one turned out.\n\n346\n00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:08.830\n>> 20 seconds, and in this case, it-\n>> Not too bad with the repeated frames.\n\n347\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.000\nIf it were longer, it might be a problem.\n\n348\n00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.390\nLet me highlight it, and\nit shows me on here, saying, okay,\n\n349\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.640\nlook, you've got repeated frames.\n\n350\n00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.770\nI can sometimes change that,\nI can maybe watch this, I'll try and\n\n351\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:30.120\ndo a little trimming here to see if I\ncan get something that will help me out.\n\n352\n00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.570\nReally not happening.\n\n353\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:39.429\nBut sometimes, I can do that because I've\nabsolutely butted heads, I have no space.\n\n354\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.690\nWhat could I maybe do to solve that?\n\n355\n00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.580\nI could slip.\n\n356\n00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.270\nI could get into those things and\nslip things back,\n\n357\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.950\nslip that out point back to get a little\nmore space, all kinds of things,\n\n358\n00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:56.180\nbut they do put in this repeated frames,\nso you can get some of that in there.\n\n359\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.078\nBy slipping, I mean we did this before,\nremember our little friend here,\n\n360\n00:19:01.078 --> 00:19:04.730\nwhere I can say, hey,\nI'll take this clip right here,\n\n361\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.405\nand maybe I'll just get this Slip tool.\n\n362\n00:19:07.405 --> 00:19:09.008\nOkay, boom.\n\n363\n00:19:09.008 --> 00:19:15.675\nGrab it and say all right,\nI need to move this back a little bit and\n\n364\n00:19:15.675 --> 00:19:23.190\ngive myself some space, and\nyou will notice if I now pop in,\n\n365\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:28.725\nthis side lost its hash mark\nbecause that's what I did.\n\n366\n00:19:28.725 --> 00:19:33.885\nI trimmed, or in this case, slipped\nthat side and gave myself some handle.\n\n367\n00:19:33.885 --> 00:19:38.055\nNow I can slip the other side and\ndo the same thing.\n\n368\n00:19:39.455 --> 00:19:42.285\nAnd now I have some handle, and\nit's taken out those repeated frames.\n\n369\n00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:45.215\nSo that's another great thing\nthat Slip will work for,\n\n370\n00:19:45.215 --> 00:19:48.410\nis if you've dead headed all of that.\n\n371\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.610\nSo now you know how to add transitions.\n\n372\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.870\nYou know some of the different\ntransition types.\n\n373\n00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:58.000\nYou know how to do it to multiple things,\njust highlight them, do the default.\n\n374\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.760\nYou could also, like I said,\nin some cases, slip\n\n375\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.170\nthings if you run into these dead heads,\nall kinds of stuff that you can do now to\n\n376\n00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:12.180\nadd transitions to your mix and\ngive it a little life sometimes.\n\n377\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.880\nSometimes it's going from flat pictures,\nmaybe a little dissolve.\n\n378\n00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.455\nAnd especially in the audio, if you add\nthose little frame fades just to smooth\n\n379\n00:20:19.455 --> 00:20:24.110\nout the transitions just a little bit,\nyou won't hear that bump.\n\n380\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.170\nI mean sometimes, you hear that\nin your audio, and you're like,\n\n381\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.880\nI don't understand why there's no bump\nwhen I hear them individually, but\n\n382\n00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.480\nwhen I put them together,\nthere's this little weird odd little bump.\n\n383\n00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.770\nJust put in a little 4-frame,\n5-frame fade, bam, it's gone, okay,\n\n384\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.915\nand you can play around with it,\nchange everything, it's fun.\n\n385\n00:20:42.915 --> 00:20:44.611\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It is really cool stuff, and\n\n386\n00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:48.137\nwhat's cool about this is like we've\nbasically have been working on\n\n387\n00:20:48.137 --> 00:20:48.880\nthese clips.\n\n388\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.020\nYou've been putting them together, and\n\n389\n00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:56.040\nup until now, it's just demonstrating the\neffects or things that you're doing to it.\n\n390\n00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.440\nBut as you add these transitions and\nthese different things and\n\n391\n00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.390\nthese fades, it's starting to look\na whole lot more professional.\n\n392\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.261\n>> Right.\n>> And just by adding those little\n\n393\n00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:03.895\ntidbits.\n\n394\n00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:04.515\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n395\n00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:06.941\nnow we are able to do\nthe exact same thing.\n\n396\n00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:09.943\n>> [CROSSTALK] Sometimes, yeah, sometimes\na cut leads people well into something.\n\n397\n00:21:09.943 --> 00:21:13.400\nSometimes a nice transition leads\nthings properly into the right area,\n\n398\n00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.611\nespecially sometimes\nwith still pictures and\n\n399\n00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:19.160\nespecially if you have that motion\non there, and you do a little bit.\n\n400\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.670\nLooks really, really nice,\n\n401\n00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.210\nand sometimes people say, that is very\nprofessional, by adding that in there.\n\n402\n00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.660\nSo, there you go, now you're adding\nmore tools to your arsenal, and\n\n403\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.000\njust how easy they can be.\n\n404\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.990\nNotice, if you just stick\nto one tool all the time,\n\n405\n00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.570\nyou really don't get the life and\nthe vibrance and the story you want.\n\n406\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.810\nThat's why there's so\nmany tools and eventually like wow,\n\n407\n00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.260\nI can use this tool for this,\nI can use this tool for that.\n\n408\n00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.900\nThe other thing that you wanna know about\neffects and transitions, oftentimes,\n\n409\n00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.710\nAdobe has used them so much,\nthey come up with great ideas, but\n\n410\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.089\nfeel free sometimes to email Adobe and\nsay, hey,\n\n411\n00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:58.460\nI did this with an effect and\na transition, is that okay?\n\n412\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.990\nAnd Adobe will come back and most often\nsay, hey, we never thought of that.\n\n413\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.410\nThat's really great, good for you.\n\n414\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.049\nYou should post that on our forum, or\nyou should talk to other people about it,\n\n415\n00:22:10.049 --> 00:22:12.657\ncuz we never saw that you could\ndo that with that effect.\n\n416\n00:22:12.657 --> 00:22:16.907\nAnd that's one of the nice things about\nAdobe, not only can you tell the story,\n\n417\n00:22:16.907 --> 00:22:18.810\nyou can take effects and say, hey,\n\n418\n00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.410\nI kinda did this and tweaked that and\nmade it this, and what do you guys think?\n\n419\n00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.510\nAnd they always like\nthat kind of feedback.\n\n420\n00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.300\nAnd transitions and effects are a good\nway to sort of get on the forums and\n\n421\n00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.160\nsay hey, I tried this.\n\n422\n00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.470\nWhat do you guys think of,\nyou guys like that?\n\n423\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.530\nAnd so, try it, definitely do that.\n\n424\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.320\nIt gets a great conversation\ngoing about using Adobe, and\n\n425\n00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.170\nespecially about using Adobe Premiere.\n\n426\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.020\n>> Awesome, thank you so much for\nexplaining that to us, and now we know.\n\n427\n00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.280\nYou create a really cool effect.\n\n428\n00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.630\nYou can give it to Adobe and let the\ncommunity of people get their hands on it.\n\n429\n00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.080\nMaybe they can tell a story and\nuse it for their purposes as well.\n\n430\n00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.532\nJim, we do appreciate\nyou stopping by today.\n\n431\n00:22:55.532 --> 00:22:57.040\n>> Hey, I love doing this.\n\n432\n00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.895\n>> This is so much fun, right?\n\n433\n00:22:57.895 --> 00:22:59.310\n>> Do again tomorrow?\n\n434\n00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.470\n>> Yeah, we will.\n\n435\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.300\nWe thank you guys for dropping by, but\nit does look like it's time to sign off.\n\n436\n00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.230\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n437\n00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.610\n>> Can we cue spin out?\n\n438\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.361\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cue spin out, woo.\n\n439\n00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:11.178\nNo, let's not.\n\n440\n00:23:11.178 --> 00:23:12.040\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\n441\n00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.457\nWe'll see you next time guys, bye.\n\n442\n00:23:13.457 --> 00:23:14.836\n>> See you everybody.\n\n443\n00:23:14.836 --> 00:23:23.580\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.929\nI'm you're host Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode, if you have moderate to\n\n4\n00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.032\nsevere plaque psoriasis, we won't be\nable to help you but if you're in for\n\n5\n00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:25.414\nsome more Premier Pro,\nyou've come to the right place.\n\n6\n00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:28.831\nAnd joining us today to help us out with\nthat very endeavor is our good friend Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:29.396\nJim Biddle.\n\n8\n00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.431\nJim, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:31.214\nSir, how's it going?\n>> How you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:35.880\nHey, we're doing audio which to some\npeople is like moderate to severe plaque\n\n11\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.445\npsoriasis in their life.\n\n12\n00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:38.177\n[LAUGH] I know.\n\n13\n00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:41.202\nI know you're like, right now you probably\nhave not been looking forward to this one,\n\n14\n00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:42.400\nit's like audio, really?\n\n15\n00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.940\nIt's like yeah, I know, I've been there,\nI've done audio in my life.\n\n16\n00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.450\nI still do it but\nwhat I want you to know with this\n\n17\n00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.000\nis sometimes people go\nway too far with audio.\n\n18\n00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.190\nKeep it simple because\nsometimes when you try and\n\n19\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.760\ncorrect way to much, it becomes really\napparent that you tried to save something.\n\n20\n00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.680\nSo I'm gonna show you just some simple\nthings in Adobe that you can do and\n\n21\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.520\nyou can feel a little bit more\ncomfortable about how you can do it.\n\n22\n00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.580\nSo I'm gonna dive back\ninto the interface here.\n\n23\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.050\nAnd I wanna just adjust a few things and\ntalk about a few things that we've done\n\n24\n00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.520\nin the past that you might wanna\nknow about specifically with media.\n\n25\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.750\nCuz I'm gonna change to the audio\ninterface in a minute and you may really,\n\n26\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.190\nreally like that or\nyou might just wanna stick with editing.\n\n27\n00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.210\nEither way it's fine.\n\n28\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.820\nOne of the things you've noticed,\nI've been jumping back and\n\n29\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.280\nforth because I don't have allot of\nreal estate on my project window.\n\n30\n00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.398\nI can't see a lot.\n\n31\n00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:37.554\nSo maybe after you're done working with\na lot of your media in the project window,\n\n32\n00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:41.409\nthat's a great time to say, you know what,\nI love the preview area when I'm\n\n33\n00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.349\nworking with it, but I may just let it\ngo and get some more screen real estate.\n\n34\n00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.194\nThat way I can see my bends a little\nbit more and it's easier for\n\n35\n00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:49.490\nme to get to them.\n\n36\n00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.095\nSo as soon as I don't need that\ninformation any more, that's why you have\n\n37\n00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:57.238\nthat option to say, hey, it's a great tool\nbut right now, I don't really need it.\n\n38\n00:01:57.238 --> 00:01:58.999\nSo I'll see you later.\n\n39\n00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:04.180\nOkay, so\nwhat I want to sort of talk about here is.\n\n40\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.350\nWe've made some sub-clips and\nwe've done some merges, and\n\n41\n00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.690\nwe've done things like that.\n\n42\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.710\nAnd I know people will probably say at\nthis point, so I made some sub-clips and\n\n43\n00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.480\nI did a merge, did I create new media?\n\n44\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.638\nAnd where did it go?\n\n45\n00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.870\nEspecially with sub-clips.\n\n46\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.300\nLet me get into the sub-clips here and\nsay all right, I created like Bamboo,\n\n47\n00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.140\nBanana, BananaCactus,\nall of these by going to one clip and\n\n48\n00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.544\nsaying I want to make these\nlittle individual sub-clips.\n\n49\n00:02:34.018 --> 00:02:40.480\nI'm gonna Ctrl+click on Banana here and\nsay, my good friend, Reveal in the Finder.\n\n50\n00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.350\nWhen I go to the finder, it says.\n\n51\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.940\nIt's referencing that master clip still.\n\n52\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.284\nWhen I made the sub-clips,\nit didn't actually create any new media.\n\n53\n00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:58.503\nIt's still referencing the original\nclip that I pulled it from.\n\n54\n00:02:58.503 --> 00:03:00.615\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n55\n00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:02.002\nI didn't create any new media.\n\n56\n00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:03.350\nI haven't done any of that.\n\n57\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.625\nSo that's what happens with sub-clips.\n\n58\n00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.520\nThe big question that a lot of people have\nis we did a merge at the beginning, and\n\n59\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.530\nI have this synced audio here.\n\n60\n00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.738\nAnd let me just go back up here,\nand I have my garden interview,\n\n61\n00:03:17.738 --> 00:03:21.880\nI have my garden clips and\nI have merger clips, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.940\nI call them merger.\n\n63\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.860\nThis is the merge clip.\n\n64\n00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.140\nThis is where I said, hey, take this audio\nand take this video and put them together.\n\n65\n00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.130\nDid I create a new piece of media there?\n\n66\n00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.960\nCtrl+click > Reveal in Finder.\n\n67\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.590\nNo, this is a combined clip and\nit's saying I am\n\n68\n00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.460\nlooking back at both of these clips in\norder to make the metadata for this.\n\n69\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.250\nI'm looking at both of these\npieces of media to create this\n\n70\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.390\nmerged metadata clip in here and\nyou're like, okay.\n\n71\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.440\nSo one of the interesting things is\nwhen you are working with your media,\n\n72\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.260\nwhen you're creating sub-clips,\nwhen you're doing these type of things,\n\n73\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.470\nyou are not actually affecting\nthe media at this time.\n\n74\n00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.086\nThere are other things that you can\ndo in other applications where you\n\n75\n00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:10.215\nwill create new media,\naffect the media in a specific way.\n\n76\n00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:14.104\nIn this case,\nyou're just working with metadata, so\n\n77\n00:04:14.104 --> 00:04:17.158\nyou can feel really confident about that.\n\n78\n00:04:17.158 --> 00:04:21.190\nThe other thing about merge clips,\nI know and as I get into audio,\n\n79\n00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.660\nthe reason I wanted to bring up the merge\nclip thing is a lot of people say,\n\n80\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.850\ndo I really, really have to do that.\n\n81\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.940\nWell, Adobe gives you some options so you\ndon't necessarily have to do that, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.540\nWhen I'm working with a lot of clips,\nand it's like I have a lot of audio and\n\n83\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.730\na lot of video, I wanna put them all\ntogether and merge them in the beginning.\n\n84\n00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.510\nYou may only have one or two, so\nI can do that in the actual timeline.\n\n85\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.660\nSo I created a sequence here\nreal quick that I call Sync.\n\n86\n00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.756\nAnd I'll double-click it, and\nI'm gonna jump back out and\n\n87\n00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:59.030\ncome to Sync, use my tilde key,\nand what do I have here?\n\n88\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.563\nI have exactly what I had done before,\nokay?\n\n89\n00:05:04.563 --> 00:05:08.577\nThis is the interview of me\ntalking with its audio, and\n\n90\n00:05:08.577 --> 00:05:11.819\nthis is the separate\naudio that I recorded.\n\n91\n00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.001\nAnd you might just say,\n\n92\n00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.559\nI would feel more comfortable if I\ncould just look at it in the timeline.\n\n93\n00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:17.470\nAnd that's fine.\n\n94\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.940\nWe were actually playing around with this\noutside in the bullpen a little bit.\n\n95\n00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.544\nIf I highlight everything and\n\n96\n00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:29.760\nthen Ctrl+click in the timeline,\nI can say synchronize.\n\n97\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.890\nAnd it'll be like I can synchronize?\n\n98\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.890\nYes, and I will say Synchronize and\nI get some options.\n\n99\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.880\nIt'll say the Clip Start or the Clip End.\n\n100\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.890\nThat's pretty easy.\n\n101\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.000\nBut sometimes it'll be like, I don't know.\n\n102\n00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.350\nI could do the Clip Marker, or\n\n103\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.240\nI could say if I don't have a marker\non this, I'll say do the audio.\n\n104\n00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.895\nTake the audio waveforms, and try and\nsynchronize match those please.\n\n105\n00:05:54.895 --> 00:05:59.367\nOkay, and it'll say which reference,\none, two, or do a mix down?\n\n106\n00:05:59.367 --> 00:06:02.352\nI am gonna say use number\n1 as the reference.\n\n107\n00:06:02.352 --> 00:06:06.214\nAnd say, let me back off so\nyou can see it happen, OK.\n\n108\n00:06:06.214 --> 00:06:10.548\nBoom, and\nit threw it into a synchronization.\n\n109\n00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:14.732\nNow the thing that happens\nis the top one moves,\n\n110\n00:06:14.732 --> 00:06:19.969\nthat's why you might want to\nline them up as best as you can.\n\n111\n00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:22.299\nBecause it's generally in track one and\ntrack two.\n\n112\n00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:27.436\nEven if I choose track two, video one and\nvideo and audio one are moving.\n\n113\n00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:33.913\nNow from here, I can merge.\n\n114\n00:06:33.913 --> 00:06:37.213\nFrom here I can merge clips.\n\n115\n00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:41.990\nIf I try and merge clips before I\nsynchronize, it gets a little dicey.\n\n116\n00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.688\nSo when you do this in the timeline,\nyou can synchronize first,\n\n117\n00:06:45.688 --> 00:06:47.685\nthen merge the clips, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:50.955\nSo if you want to do it that way,\nyou can do it that way.\n\n119\n00:06:50.955 --> 00:06:52.660\nLet's go back to garden sequence and\n\n120\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.250\nlet's start playing around\nwith some audio at this point.\n\n121\n00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.360\nSome people, they always do their\naudio in the actual timeline.\n\n122\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.360\nSome people will go to the audio\nmixer because they've worked with\n\n123\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.910\naudio mixers before.\n\n124\n00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.400\nIf you haven't, you can actually\nwork with audio mixers in Adobe and\n\n125\n00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.410\nfeel comfortable with it.\n\n126\n00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.150\nTrust me, trust me, please.\n\n127\n00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:19.610\nOkay, so I might switch to a different\nuser interface, I do have an audio one.\n\n128\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.830\nOkay, up here, I could choose it,\nif I've got the Workspaces bar open.\n\n129\n00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.730\nIf not, I can just go to Workspaces and\nchoose Audio.\n\n130\n00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.970\nThat one'll work just as well.\n\n131\n00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.590\nIn this case, since I got this groovy\nwindow here, I'm gonna click it and\n\n132\n00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.780\nhere's what happens.\n\n133\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.410\nIt says you really don't\nneed to see a source window.\n\n134\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.310\nYou need to see the mixers and\nthere's two.\n\n135\n00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.030\nThere's a clip mixer and a track mixer.\n\n136\n00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.091\nWe're gonna talk about that in a minute.\n\n137\n00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:51.738\nAlso I have immediate access\nover here to a larger,\n\n138\n00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:55.422\nwhat we have is a larger project window.\n\n139\n00:07:55.422 --> 00:07:58.206\nAnd now, this is a cool new thing, and\n\n140\n00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:01.604\nyou can do this as well\nnow These have stacked.\n\n141\n00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:07.677\nSo I now have stacked panels\nbelow instead of going left or\n\n142\n00:08:07.677 --> 00:08:10.970\nright on the side like tabs.\n\n143\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.610\nSo I can create stacked now, and\nthis automatically does some stacked ones,\n\n144\n00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.500\nI actually kinda like that.\n\n145\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.660\nSo first thing I wanna do\nis just play through this.\n\n146\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.090\n>> Hi, I'm Jim Biddle and I'm currently\ntraining you right now on Adobe And\n\n147\n00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.580\nthe reason why I'm-\n>> The thing is\n\n148\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.750\nwith your like wait where\nare my auto meters?\n\n149\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.430\nThe auto meters have now been moved okay.\n\n150\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.970\nSince they want to give you as\nmuch real estate as possible.\n\n151\n00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:41.000\nThe audio meters are now\non the audio track mixer.\n\n152\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.040\nThat's like okay I can do that.\n\n153\n00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.150\nI can jump back and forth if I want to.\n\n154\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.140\n>> Maybe turn the back area in-\n>> And,\n\n155\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.720\none of the things that happened is because\nI made that audio gain at the source,\n\n156\n00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.540\nthis is actually up to level and\npretty clean.\n\n157\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.060\nSo that saved me some time.\n\n158\n00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.900\nThe next thing I wanna do is\nadd in some music, all right?\n\n159\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.900\nSo I'm gonna go back here,\nand I've got some music.\n\n160\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.080\nAnd here's the cool thing, this is\na really cool thing that you can do.\n\n161\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.770\nCuz you can either affect the,\nin the timeline you can affect\n\n162\n00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:22.950\nthe audio on the clip itself or\nyou can affect the track.\n\n163\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.900\nSo you may run into this problem.\n\n164\n00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.890\nI have music for something called\nan commercial Commercial, okay.\n\n165\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.980\nLet's say, I have a friend and\nhe makes my music.\n\n166\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.870\nOkay, he makes all my music.\n\n167\n00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.100\nAnd I say, hey I got this interview thing,\nI got going on here man and\n\n168\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.470\nI really need that music keep emailing\nhim, hey, I know you're on tour right now.\n\n169\n00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.200\nI need that music and\nit's really holding me up.\n\n170\n00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.440\nSo, I'm just going to use some placeholder\nmusic and they're like, what's that.\n\n171\n00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.510\nWell, I've got this thing called here and\n\n172\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.580\nI'm just gonna drag it in,\nI'm just gonna drag it in.\n\n173\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.470\nIt's gonna do is an overwrite and\nput in a three.\n\n174\n00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.040\nAnd notice this is one of those\nsituations let me do the thing.\n\n175\n00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:17.430\nIt's like okay you've got\ntwo channels in one track.\n\n176\n00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.060\nAnd let me zoom in.\n\n177\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.020\nI have two channels in one track.\n\n178\n00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.750\nAnd I'm gonna say I'm okay with\nthat because I don't have to affect\n\n179\n00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.400\neither side, I don't have to affect the\nleft or right channel, it's in one track.\n\n180\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.850\nAnd it also means if I had effects,\nif I do volume changes it's gonna do both.\n\n181\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:41.310\nYou maybe saying right now\nwill you split this one?\n\n182\n00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:47.790\nAnd it's two channels in two tracks, so\nI've got to do the volume in one and\n\n183\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.250\nthen add that to the next one or do this,\nthere's a way to circumvent that.\n\n184\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.750\nThere is really a cool way\nto circumvent that, and\n\n185\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.990\nthat's what am gonna shoe you about\nthis sought of mix right now.\n\n186\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.600\nSo, let me pull that\nmusic back a little bit.\n\n187\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.180\nOkay, let me pull it to the front.\n\n188\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.480\nOkay?\nThere is another way to do that.\n\n189\n00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.410\nYou might be the super cool\nperson that knows that,\n\n190\n00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.630\nif there is a gap, right there.\n\n191\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.223\nWhat I can do is Ctrl-click on it and\nsay, ripple delay.\n\n192\n00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:17.040\nBoom, and it'll ripple delay back.\n\n193\n00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.480\nI just decided to give it a time.\n\n194\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.810\n>> Hi, I'm Jim Biddel currently\ntraining you on Adobe Premiere, and-\n\n195\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.813\n>> And that's really, really just sad.\n\n196\n00:11:24.813 --> 00:11:27.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That is some sad music.\n\n197\n00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.570\n>> Depressing.\n\n198\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.960\n>> It's like yeah,\nlet's make my garden even more depressing.\n\n199\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.520\n>> I'm Jim Bittle.\n\n200\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.530\n>> [INAUDIBLE] right now\non Adobe Premiere, and\n\n201\n00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.550\n>> The reason why I'm shooting today.\n\n202\n00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.670\nOne, it's a beautiful day.\n\n203\n00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.760\nI haven't seen my back\nyard in about a month.\n\n204\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.530\n>> So, wow, you know, it's like,\nthat's a sad little garden area.\n\n205\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.640\n>> You expected Edward Scissorhands\nto come out after you?\n\n206\n00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.960\n>> But that's okay.\n\n207\n00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.210\nThat is okay.\n\n208\n00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.270\nI am okay with that.\n\n209\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.650\nAnd people are like, really?\n\n210\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.310\nYou're okay with that?\n\n211\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.860\nYeah.\n\n212\n00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:59.180\nBecause I'm gonna get the new music\nlater and everything is gonna be great.\n\n213\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.230\nIt's like, all right.\n\n214\n00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.452\n>> It's very Slayeresque\nwith the new music, right?\n\n215\n00:12:03.452 --> 00:12:04.742\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly,\n\n216\n00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:06.745\nwe're gonna throw down in the garden.\n\n217\n00:12:06.745 --> 00:12:07.590\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.820\n>> Now, what most people\n\n219\n00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.650\nwanna do when they adjust audio, and\n\n220\n00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.920\nyou can do this in the timeline, you can\n>> Absolutely do this\n\n221\n00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.670\nin the time line I'm gonna zoom in and\njust start at the beginning.\n\n222\n00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.050\nA lot of people call these,\nsometimes they call them rubber bands.\n\n223\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.310\nOkay, these are key frame lines so\nI'm going to,\n\n224\n00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.870\nnotice I get a Nill FX line\nhere at the beginning.\n\n225\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:34.670\nI get a little badge, and it's gonna say,\nokay, so, the volume is a volume level.\n\n226\n00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.110\nI Control click it.\n\n227\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.890\nThere's volume level.\n\n228\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.710\nThere's bypass.\n\n229\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.320\nThere's a channel volume and\nthere's a panner.\n\n230\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.210\nSo, if I was doing channel volume what\nI would try and do is I'm gonna try and\n\n231\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.970\naffect each channel,\njust the left and the right.\n\n232\n00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.210\nSo, I get that.\n\n233\n00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.950\nOkay?\nI get that as a neat little option.\n\n234\n00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:58.030\nWhat I'm gonna make sure and\ndo, is make sure and\n\n235\n00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.700\nshow the audio key frames and\nthe other names okay.\n\n236\n00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:08.020\nSo, here I go, gonna control click and\nwe gonna go volume Level and\n\n237\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.660\nas soon as I put my thing there it's like\nthat's the line that's the volume line.\n\n238\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.930\nAnd I can just say okay\nbring the whole thing down.\n\n239\n00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.720\nAnd it'll tell me about how many\ndecimals that will bring that down.\n\n240\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.640\nBring it down about five and\nI'll give a quick play.\n\n241\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.750\n>> To change it.\n\n242\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:27.012\n[MUSIC]\n\n243\n00:13:27.012 --> 00:13:30.470\n>> Now why is it still so loud?\n\n244\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.290\n>> It's pretty loud.\n\n245\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.500\n>> It's pretty loud.\n\n246\n00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:39.210\nBecause most people want to make all of\ntheir changes using this key frame line.\n\n247\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.700\nWell, I could Control click and\nsay, you know what.\n\n248\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.110\nWhat if I just bring down the audio gain,\n\n249\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.070\nthe overall audio gain\n>> Like I did in the source,\n\n250\n00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.850\njust a little bit, because it's just, no\nmatter how I'm bringing down that volume,\n\n251\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.330\nit's still just really punching it.\n\n252\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.720\nSo, I'm just going to go\narbitrarily negative.\n\n253\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.230\nSix.\n\n254\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.996\nBoom.\nYou'll see the audio piece go down.\n\n255\n00:14:00.996 --> 00:14:03.620\n[INAUDIBLE] into a [INAUDIBLE]-\n>> That's better.\n\n256\n00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.550\nThat's better.\n\n257\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.730\nAnd I wanna get it to a point where\nI can control it much, much more.\n\n258\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.630\n>> This video so\nyou can see what it's like-\n\n259\n00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.560\n>> With the volume.\n\n260\n00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.000\nAnd it's easier for me to do that if\nI effect the source a little bit.\n\n261\n00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.723\nIf I forgot to do it in the source\nI can do that in the timeline.\n\n262\n00:14:19.723 --> 00:14:21.262\nOkay, good.\n\n263\n00:14:21.262 --> 00:14:25.560\nSo now I can create some\nsome groovy face and\n\n264\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.170\nnot easy coming here and I have my.\n\n265\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:34.840\nRemember how we did key frames last time I\ncan go get the pen tool if I wanted to or\n\n266\n00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.040\njust down command down down.\n\n267\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.870\nNow the cool thing is let's bring that up\njust a little bit cuz thing is now it's\n\n268\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.900\nreally goofy on there.\n\n269\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.920\nSo, one of the cool things is\nlike yeah that's pretty linear.\n\n270\n00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.700\nIf I hold down the Cmd key again,\nI'm sorry yeah Cmd key.\n\n271\n00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:02.710\nI can get that Bezier curve and\nI can actually make Like a nice little,\n\n272\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.950\nsee, like a like a good fade that way,\nwith this was not so linear.\n\n273\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.210\nAnd it's a much much nicer fade,\n\n274\n00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.855\nthat's going to be really short,\nso what can I do?\n\n275\n00:15:13.855 --> 00:15:16.335\nYeah, I can pick up that keyframe and\ngo a little further.\n\n276\n00:15:16.335 --> 00:15:18.245\n>> So this is gonna make it\nsound a lot more natural.\n\n277\n00:15:18.245 --> 00:15:21.455\n>> It's gonna sound a lot more natural,\nit's gonna deal with the overall power,\n\n278\n00:15:21.455 --> 00:15:23.365\nyou know, sometimes-\n>> Hi, I'm Jim Biddel and\n\n279\n00:15:23.365 --> 00:15:25.908\nI'm currently training-\n>> So there you go, it's a nice little\n\n280\n00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:27.980\n>> Nice little scoop-in,\n\n281\n00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.070\neverything is great.\n\n282\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.030\nBut I loved it so much,\nwhat am I going to do?\n\n283\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.315\nI'm going to get rid of it.\n\n284\n00:15:35.315 --> 00:15:36.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I loved it so much-\n\n285\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.880\n>> It was hard work,\n\n286\n00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.000\nto the garbage with you.\n\n287\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.168\n>> I'm going to get rid of it,\njust Cmd+Z, Cmd+Z, Cmd+Z, Cmd+Z.\n\n288\n00:15:41.168 --> 00:15:43.140\nAnother Cmd+Z back, okay.\n\n289\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.530\nGet rid of that, up the level goes again.\n\n290\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.880\nWhat if I wanna do this\nIn the audio mixer.\n\n291\n00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.714\nWe have a clip mixer.\n\n292\n00:15:51.714 --> 00:15:58.467\nThe clip mixer is going to do the key\nframes directly on the clip itself.\n\n293\n00:15:58.467 --> 00:16:02.772\nThere may be instances\nwhere you wanna do that.\n\n294\n00:16:02.772 --> 00:16:04.726\nYou don't wanna Send it back to source and\ndo this, do that.\n\n295\n00:16:04.726 --> 00:16:09.310\nMaybe there is just a little dip only\nin the clip that you need to make.\n\n296\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.520\nYou know there's a little pop or\nsomething.\n\n297\n00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.480\nI wanna do that in a clip,\nnot the entire track.\n\n298\n00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.880\nSo you can do that in the clip mixer.\n\n299\n00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.770\nI'm going to work in the track mixer and\n\n300\n00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:26.480\nthis is something that people\nsometimes they just love this, and\n\n301\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:33.715\nI love it too in that I have a fader.\n\n302\n00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:34.296\nI have a fader.\n\n303\n00:16:34.296 --> 00:16:38.830\nCouldn't I just move it up and\ndown and mix the music?\n\n304\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.960\nYeah.\n\n305\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.540\nYeah, if that's what you're used to.\n\n306\n00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.170\nThat's absolutely what you can do.\n\n307\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.240\nSo I'm giving myself a little\nmore real estate on the mixer.\n\n308\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.410\nAnd there are several states of\nwhat is known as automation mode.\n\n309\n00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.340\nRight now it's on read,\nit's just reading what's in there.\n\n310\n00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.320\nLatch, touch and write.\n\n311\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.430\nI'm just gonna to go to write,\nbecause latch and\n\n312\n00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:04.510\ntouch do very specific things\nif you touch the fader.\n\n313\n00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.120\nI'm just gonna go to right, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.120\nThat's all I'm gonna do, and\nmake a mix on this music.\n\n315\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.600\nJust right, and I will bring it down.\n\n316\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:22.800\nAnd if you'll see, trying to see but\n| come back, it goes down.\n\n317\n00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.841\nSo if I play it now.\n\n318\n00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:25.610\nI don't hear the music.\n\n319\n00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:31.530\nI don't hear the music at all because what\nI did was I brought it all the way down.\n\n320\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.630\nNow when I hit play down\nhere Jim Biddle and\n\n321\n00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.360\nI'm currently training you\nright now on Adobe Premier.\n\n322\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.290\nAnd the reason why I'm shooting today,\none, it's a beautiful day.\n\n323\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:46.900\nI haven't seen my back yard in about\na month, because I've been on vacation.\n\n324\n00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.290\nWe're looking to change it.\n\n325\n00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.960\nWe're looking to change up the garden,\nget rid of the grass.\n\n326\n00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.850\nI'm just holding down on the mouse and\nmoving.\n\n327\n00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.460\nSo you can see what it's like\nto shoot outdoors make a little.\n\n328\n00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.840\nJust moving the fader.\n\n329\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.550\nThis is also why this is nice and\n\n330\n00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.350\nit switched to touch because I was having\ntrouble getting it with the touch pad.\n\n331\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.550\nAnd I'd have to go back and and do it.\n\n332\n00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:10.580\nBut this is also why sometimes a really\ncool control surface that Adobe will\n\n333\n00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.450\nsupport.\n\n334\n00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.610\nIt it's good because you know you have\nthe actual things that you can feel.\n\n335\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:16.460\n>> Jim, quick question.\n\n336\n00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.170\nAs you work the fader, and\nwe're watching it preview for us.\n\n337\n00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.810\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is it gonna save all those fades up and\n\n338\n00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.980\ndown, or you're listening?\n\n339\n00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.390\n>> Let me show you something really cool,\nokay?\n\n340\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.790\n>> Okay.\n>> Cuz I've gone back to the timeline.\n\n341\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.710\nI love it when you ask the questions.\n\n342\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.365\nI didn't even write them out for you.\n\n343\n00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:35.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if I do this, and then I say hey,\n\n344\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:43.390\nlet me see, control click,\nlet me see volume, level.\n\n345\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.000\nWhat I need to do now.\n\n346\n00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.420\nRemember these headers?\n\n347\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.220\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n348\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.680\nI'm gonna open this up more and\n\n349\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.620\nnotice there's a little keyframe doodad\nhere, and it says Show Keyframes.\n\n350\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.210\nIf I control click.\n\n351\n00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.510\nIt gives me all of these things.\n\n352\n00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.100\nBut if I just regular clip will say,\n\n353\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.950\nyou're looking at\nClip Keyframes right now.\n\n354\n00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.560\nLet's look at Track Keyframes,\ncuz you used the audio track mixer.\n\n355\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:24.650\nBam, all over a sudden, let me\nsqueeze this over just a little bit.\n\n356\n00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.150\nZoom in.\n\n357\n00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:30.850\nIt's like hey, wow,\nit put in a bunch of keyframes.\n\n358\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.530\nIt's like yes, as I moved the fader,\nit put in the keyframes.\n\n359\n00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.310\nIt will also allow me to say,\nthat was a little too direct.\n\n360\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.500\nI can I can move them.\n\n361\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.190\n>> That's pretty slick.\n\n362\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.840\n>> I can move them and\n\n363\n00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.100\nsay okay I have a bunch of them I need\nto just re align them a little bit.\n\n364\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:45.920\nSo I can go through and\n\n365\n00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.460\ndo them the other thing that's cool if\nI wanted to I could get the pen tool.\n\n366\n00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:57.780\nRight now if I'm I'm lasso-ing,\nyou know I'm just getting the clips.\n\n367\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.550\nBut if I go back and get the pen tool,\nI can lasso key frames and hit delete and\n\n368\n00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.400\nget rid of them.\n\n369\n00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:08.970\nNow let's say for some strange reason,\nI absolutely love this mix.\n\n370\n00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.490\nYou know, that's a power mix.\n\n371\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.040\nRight there.\n\n372\n00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.770\n>> Yeah.\n\n373\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:19.144\n>> But then I say I need the new music.\n\n374\n00:20:19.144 --> 00:20:22.470\nI need the new music.\n\n375\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.215\nIf basically I say,\nokay, what I'm going to.\n\n376\n00:20:24.215 --> 00:20:26.525\nI'm gonna is quickly,\nthis is my method, I gotta get and\n\n377\n00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:29.115\ngo back to clip key frames,\ncuz that way I can grab the clip.\n\n378\n00:20:30.215 --> 00:20:32.305\nAnd I'll say okay, boom.\n\n379\n00:20:32.305 --> 00:20:32.805\n>> Go on.\n\n380\n00:20:34.705 --> 00:20:39.615\n>> If I look back at the track key frames,\nthey're still there.\n\n381\n00:20:39.615 --> 00:20:40.565\n>> They're still there.\n\n382\n00:20:40.565 --> 00:20:44.860\n>> There, so all I have to do now\nis edit in the new music I want\n\n383\n00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.810\n>> And the mix is done.\n\n384\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.990\n>> It's almost like they thought\nahead of time that this is something\n\n385\n00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.730\nthat might occur.\n\n386\n00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.550\n>> This is something that\nactually might occur.\n\n387\n00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:58.000\nYou will not get music from somebody and\nyou have\n\n388\n00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.980\nto wait because they haven't definitely\ndealt with people who make music.\n\n389\n00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.990\n>> Yeah, because what's the point of\ngoing through like a visual survey\n\n390\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.940\nplaceholder music,\nlike what you have here.\n\n391\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.440\nAnd you do all this work on it, and\n\n392\n00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.290\nyou're like, now I gotta do it again,\ncuz I got new music.\n\n393\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:10.840\n>> Exactly.\n\n394\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.600\nSo now all I'll do is I'll take the dance\nof hands, pop it right there, and\n\n395\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.340\nnow I have the mix on the dance of hands.\n\n396\n00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:18.870\n>> Hi, I'm Jim Biddel.\n\n397\n00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.190\nI'm currently training you\nright now on Adobe Premiere.\n\n398\n00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:25.330\nAnd the reason why I'm shooting today-\n>> It is, it's really,\n\n399\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.290\nit's low at the beginning.\n\n400\n00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:26.970\n>> Soft music.\n\n401\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:27.550\n>> It's very soft.\n\n402\n00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.670\nLet me do the montage.\n\n403\n00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.620\nOkay, it's a montage, okay.\n\n404\n00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.170\nBoom boom boom, boom, bam.\n\n405\n00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:34.790\nYep, there we go.\n\n406\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.530\nThere's some audio .wav forms on there,\nso, yeah.\n\n407\n00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.578\n>> There's the thrash metal.\n\n408\n00:21:37.578 --> 00:21:42.027\n>> I'm Jim Biddel, I'm currently training\nyou right now on Adobe Premiere and\n\n409\n00:21:42.027 --> 00:21:42.651\nthe reason\n\n410\n00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:44.199\n[MUSIC]\n\n411\n00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:47.050\n>> That is much better for my [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n412\n00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:51.300\n>> Now the only issue is that on the other\nmusic, I have dropped the source.\n\n413\n00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.970\n>> Right.\n>> By 6 dB, so I'm just going in and\n\n414\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.500\ndrop the source, 6 dB, no problem.\n\n415\n00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:01.696\nSo the next thing, you're gonna say it's\nlike, okay smart guy, that is really cool.\n\n416\n00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:05.390\nHowever, you have, and\n\n417\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.313\nnotice, here's the thing I do like about\nthis audio mixers too that you may miss.\n\n418\n00:22:09.313 --> 00:22:10.280\nIf I'm just doing the audio meters, okay.\n\n419\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.020\nIf I'm just doing the audio meters, what\n\n420\n00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.720\nhappens is I'm gonna\nturn that back to read.\n\n421\n00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.760\nSo I don't fax with it.\n\n422\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.970\nThe thing is, I will only see\non the standard audio meters.\n\n423\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.280\nI've overshot, I've gone into the red.\n\n424\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.320\nBut I don't know which track\nI went into the red on.\n\n425\n00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.190\nWas it the music?\n\n426\n00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.060\nWas it the voiceover?\n\n427\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.540\nWas it both?\n\n428\n00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:38.790\nI can use this to look at it and\nsay okay I went into the red in the music.\n\n429\n00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.100\nSo, I need to find out where I went into\nthe red and back off a little bit and\n\n430\n00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.460\nI can do that, I can just wait and\nsee, boom, there it is.\n\n431\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.340\nAnd it's not gonna be too hard,\nsince it's music.\n\n432\n00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.470\nSo, it'll say, okay, so\nyou did those volume changes in there and\n\n433\n00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.580\nyou did them really,\nreally well what if you've got this thing\n\n434\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.040\nwhere it's like you've got the voice\nover and it's in two separate tracks.\n\n435\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.690\nHow do you control both of those?\n\n436\n00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:04.240\nDo you have to make keyframes in one and\nthen pop them in the other?\n\n437\n00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:11.570\nOr I do something that audio\nguys do called a submix, okay?\n\n438\n00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:15.640\nSo I can have two separates so\nthese two right here.\n\n439\n00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.410\nThe first two are the inner view.\n\n440\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.890\nIf I want to say I can't remember that,\nI could come down to where\n\n441\n00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.760\nit says Audio 1 and I'll say okay Int 1.\n\n442\n00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:34.260\nThis is Int 2, and\nthen this one is gonna be music.\n\n443\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.520\nSo, that way I've got them all labeled out\nand I can remember which one is which.\n\n444\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.470\nThe other thing too is,\n\n445\n00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.810\nonce I rename these,\nremember when I did that with the video?\n\n446\n00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.300\nOkay, it's going to do the same thing\nin the timeline if I rename them\n\n447\n00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.380\non the Audio, okay, if I new name them on\nthe audio track mixer it's gonna rename\n\n448\n00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.830\nthem in the timeline on the headers.\n\n449\n00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.132\nIt's like okay, that's really cool.\n\n450\n00:23:56.132 --> 00:24:01.371\nSo jump back, I can go to Sequence.\n\n451\n00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:03.976\nAnd then down at the bottom,\nI have a thing called Add Tracks.\n\n452\n00:24:03.976 --> 00:24:08.600\nSee what's in the menu bar,\nAdd Tracks, and I'll say OK.\n\n453\n00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.250\nDo I want to add 1 video track?\n\n454\n00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.230\nNo, don't need that, let's make that a 0.\n\n455\n00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.710\nHow many audio tracks do I need?\n\n456\n00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.236\nI not need any audio tracks,\nI need a Submix.\n\n457\n00:24:18.236 --> 00:24:24.022\nOkay, I want one submix track and\ntrack type yeah, let's make it Stereo.\n\n458\n00:24:24.022 --> 00:24:32.559\nAnd I will say OK, and now I get this new\nthing in here and it says it is Submix1.\n\n459\n00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:35.631\nI'm gonna say Submix1 is the interview.\n\n460\n00:24:37.579 --> 00:24:40.170\nAnd your like, okay,\nhow does this thing work?\n\n461\n00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:40.844\nHere's how it works.\n\n462\n00:24:44.698 --> 00:24:47.130\nFirst thing, I have to route it.\n\n463\n00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.580\nWhat this is telling me up here,\nit says Track Output Assignment.\n\n464\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.450\nEverything is going to the Master.\n\n465\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.930\nIt's going right to the Master,\nout stereo.\n\n466\n00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:00.820\nWhat I can say is, can you put\nthe interview one into the interview\n\n467\n00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.280\nsubmaster, and interview two\ninto the interview submaster?\n\n468\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.746\nSo now these two go from one and\ntwo into the submaster and\n\n469\n00:25:09.746 --> 00:25:13.320\nthe submaster goes out to the master.\n\n470\n00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:18.890\nThe advantage of this is\nnow if I want to affect\n\n471\n00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.180\nthe overall volume of both,\ntraining you right now, and\n\n472\n00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.890\nthe reason, since it's on read, it's not\nputting it in a key transmit, but, yeah.\n\n473\n00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.210\nSo now I can control both with one submix.\n\n474\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.030\nSo instead of having to go back and\n\n475\n00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:40.770\nsaying, this should've been two channels\nin one track, I can do a submix.\n\n476\n00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:46.352\nAnd control the volume of both, okay?\n\n477\n00:25:46.352 --> 00:25:48.841\nThis gives me rise to all\nkinds of possibilities.\n\n478\n00:25:48.841 --> 00:25:53.404\nWhat if I've created a whole area of\nspecial effects, like I've got nine tracks\n\n479\n00:25:53.404 --> 00:25:57.040\nof all these special effects and\nI want to lower them all at once?\n\n480\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.620\nPut them all into a submix.\n\n481\n00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.850\nWhat if I have all of my vocal tracks,\nlike I've done six or seven vocal tracks?\n\n482\n00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.860\nPut them all into a submix so\nthat you can do them individually, and\n\n483\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.100\nthen you can do them together.\n\n484\n00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.444\n>> That's funny, they have this.\n\n485\n00:26:10.444 --> 00:26:13.685\nActually, I play guitar and\nI've worked with audio a little bit.\n\n486\n00:26:13.685 --> 00:26:15.730\nAnd there's a thing called\nthe master volume amp.\n\n487\n00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:16.450\n>> Master volume amp.\n\n488\n00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.100\nSame thing.\n\n489\n00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.930\n>> You have multiple channels on the amp,\nthey both have their own volume,\n\n490\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.250\ntypically those amps don't sound good\nunless you crank them up, right?\n\n491\n00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.710\nBut they're so\nstinking loud you can't be near them, so\n\n492\n00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.090\nthey put a master volume on it so\nyou can crank everything up and\n\n493\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.400\nthen use that master volume to turn it\nback down and get the level that you want.\n\n494\n00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.990\nAnd you can control both overall\nvolumes using that master volume.\n\n495\n00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.571\n>> Absolutely.\n\n496\n00:26:34.571 --> 00:26:36.596\n>> Very cool.\n>> So it's the same type of thing so\n\n497\n00:26:36.596 --> 00:26:39.450\nyou have more leeway now with the volume.\n\n498\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:40.280\nWhich is nice.\n\n499\n00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:40.910\n>> It is.\n\n500\n00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.280\n>> The other thing is,\nI do have an audio clip mixer.\n\n501\n00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.210\nDown here in the timeline,\nlet me jump back in real quick.\n\n502\n00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.800\nWhat I did was I came to the header, and\nI exposed, in the header, by making it\n\n503\n00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:56.430\nlarger, I'm doing Option+, you have\nthe ability to show which keyframes.\n\n504\n00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.190\nIf I show just Clip Keyframes, okay?\n\n505\n00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.930\nIf I'm showing just Clip Keyframes,\n\n506\n00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:07.350\nthis is only the clip, but\nI have a mixer for that too.\n\n507\n00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.060\nSo I could do the exact same thing.\n\n508\n00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:15.080\nYou'll notice there is no latch, touch,\n\n509\n00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:20.610\nwrite because those are specifically\ncommands for when you're mixing in tracks.\n\n510\n00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.340\nWhen you wanna mix what\ngoes into the track, okay,\n\n511\n00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.660\nwhich is a channel,\nall you have to do is write key frames.\n\n512\n00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.770\nAnd then when I play and\nmove this up and down,\n\n513\n00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.730\nit will write key frames onto the clip for\nvolume changes.\n\n514\n00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.320\nMost of the time it might be just a cough.\n\n515\n00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.090\nCuz you don't wanna, let's say\nthere's a cough in a certain clip, and\n\n516\n00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.750\nyou don't wanna do it in the track.\n\n517\n00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.490\nYou'd prefer to do it\nin the clip itself and\n\n518\n00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.420\nnot affect the overall mix on the track.\n\n519\n00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.800\nYou could come to the clip mixer, try and\nget it with the fader and it's like, hey,\n\n520\n00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.650\nI did I pretty good job with that,\nI'll just go back and\n\n521\n00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.620\nadjust the individual keyframes,\nno problem.\n\n522\n00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.745\nSo now you have some great\nnew things to play with.\n\n523\n00:28:01.745 --> 00:28:06.107\nYou have the audio clip mixer, the audio\ntrack mixer, and when we come to the next\n\n524\n00:28:06.107 --> 00:28:09.586\nepisode, which is gonna be about\nadding effects to your audio.\n\n525\n00:28:09.586 --> 00:28:11.550\nCuz a lot of it's like,\nI want to add compression.\n\n526\n00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.520\nI want to add reverb.\n\n527\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.260\nI want to do this.\n\n528\n00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.422\nIt's like, cool.\n\n529\n00:28:14.422 --> 00:28:18.271\nI'll show you how you can add\nthem to both individual clips.\n\n530\n00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:22.405\nBut then you can do something like,\nI don't know,\n\n531\n00:28:22.405 --> 00:28:27.694\ncome in with the audio track mixer and\nexposing the effects area so\n\n532\n00:28:27.694 --> 00:28:31.443\nyou can add multiple effects onto tracks,\nand\n\n533\n00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:36.580\nsubmixes, and\neven sometimes the master itself.\n\n534\n00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.679\n>> Wow, you were right.\n\n535\n00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:40.932\nThis is way better than moderate\nto severe plaque psoriasis.\n\n536\n00:28:40.932 --> 00:28:41.801\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I should know,\n\n537\n00:28:41.801 --> 00:28:45.401\nI actually have moderate plaque\npsoriasis so, [LAUGH] there you go.\n\n538\n00:28:45.401 --> 00:28:47.319\nI can vouch for my people.\n\n539\n00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:49.792\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This was a lot cooler.\n\n540\n00:28:49.792 --> 00:28:50.374\n>> Stay strong.\n\n541\n00:28:50.374 --> 00:28:53.187\n>> Yeah, the struggle is real.\n\n542\n00:28:53.187 --> 00:28:54.135\nVery cool stuff.\n\n543\n00:28:54.135 --> 00:28:55.174\nI enjoy things like that.\n\n544\n00:28:55.174 --> 00:28:59.030\nI'm a musician so the audio portion\nof this really tickling my fancy.\n\n545\n00:28:59.030 --> 00:28:59.650\n>> Good, good, good.\n\n546\n00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.064\n>> So I'm really enjoying this.\n\n547\n00:29:01.064 --> 00:29:04.684\nCan't wait to see the audio effects\nepisode we're gonna shoot for\n\n548\n00:29:04.684 --> 00:29:05.466\nthe next one.\n\n549\n00:29:05.466 --> 00:29:07.062\nBut for this, looks like we're done.\n\n550\n00:29:07.062 --> 00:29:08.055\n>> Yep, we are done for the day.\n\n551\n00:29:08.055 --> 00:29:11.695\n>> All right, well, we definitely have\ngotten our feet wet into audio and\n\n552\n00:29:11.695 -->

They get started by working with track and clip keyframes, as well as the sub-frame view for fine tuning. Then they show the steps necessary to add effects like reverb, from the built-in effect plugins. Also discussed is the Loudness Radar tool and audio hardware compatibility and use.",

--> 00:00:15.120\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.900\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.530\nin today's episode we continue on\nwith more of our Premier Pro series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.185\nJoining us back in the studio again,\nthe mix master general himself,\n\n8\n00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:26.840\nis our good friend, Mr Jim Biddle.\n\n9\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.825\nJim, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:28.540\nWe're glad to have you.\n\n11\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.750\n>> Good to be back, man.\n\n12\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.210\nOkay, so we're doing more with audio.\n\n13\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.150\nAnd again, I'm going to address some\nquestions that if you've already played\n\n14\n00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.070\naround with Audio you have\nprobably already asked.\n\n15\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.520\nAnd you're like he didn't talk about that.\n\n16\n00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.740\nWell, sometimes,\nuntil you dig into it and see it,\n\n17\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.270\nyou might not really know\nwhat questions to ask.\n\n18\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.790\nSo I'm gonna jump back into\nthe interface real quick, and\n\n19\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.710\nI wanna show you some stuff, okay?\n\n20\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.980\nNot that, but down here.\n\n21\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.470\nSo, I was saying,\nremember I can show keyframes,\n\n22\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.450\nI can show clip keyframes, or\nI can show track keyframes.\n\n23\n00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.790\nOr in this case, I can also do panning,\nwhen I wanna do it from left to right.\n\n24\n00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.240\nHow do you know which one you are on?\n\n25\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.308\nIf I switch to Track Keyframes > Volume,\n\n26\n00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:14.580\nplease note there's a difference\nbetween these two keyframes.\n\n27\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.480\nThis one has a little plus on it,\nand this one doesn't.\n\n28\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.530\nSo, this one's a Clip Keyframe.\n\n29\n00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.510\nThis one's a Track Keyframe.\n\n30\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.810\nSo, it kind of gives you a quick\nidea of which one you are using.\n\n31\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.690\nSo, you can say, wow, I'm in Track\nKeyframes, let me switch over to Clip.\n\n32\n00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.400\nKinda thing.\n\n33\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.190\nSo, sometimes that will happen,\n\n34\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.330\nwhere you're like, oops,\nI don't know which one's which.\n\n35\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.840\nHere's something else we talked about.\n\n36\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.710\nA lot of people,\nwhen they get into audio, they say,\n\n37\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.160\nhey, talked about this outside,\ncuz I do this sometimes.\n\n38\n00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.970\nThey'll say, hey, I'm working with audio,\nso I should show audio time units, right?\n\n39\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.250\nAnd you turn that on, and it's like\nwait a minute, what are all of those?\n\n40\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.852\nWell, technically,\nthis is a form of subframing.\n\n41\n00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:08.525\nCuz sometimes when you want to get in and\nedit audio, a video frame,\n\n42\n00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:11.260\nokay, when we do that, yeah?\n\n43\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.790\nA video frame might be too large.\n\n44\n00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.720\nSo, we actually wanna really dig down in,\nit's kinda like in the 80s,\n\n45\n00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.770\nif you ever watched Mork and Mindy, when\nMork shrinks down to the microuniverse and\n\n46\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.540\nhe's just so\nsmall in everything he's doing.\n\n47\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.510\nHe loves it.\n\n48\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.158\n>> I do, I do.\nThat was really well done.\n\n49\n00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:30.401\nI'm just, right here.\n>> Thank you, thank you.\n\n50\n00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:31.866\n>> Right on.\n\n51\n00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:33.113\n>> Slow claps, slow claps.\n\n52\n00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:35.370\nBut that's what we're doing is\nwe're really digging down in there.\n\n53\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.760\nSo, usually, when you take your left and\n\n54\n00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.960\nright arrows,\nyou're going a frame at a time.\n\n55\n00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.320\nIf I come up here now,\nI'm going subframes at a time, and\n\n56\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.880\nit's like my play head's not moving.\n\n57\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.260\nThat's because if I really,\nreally zoom in now, okay,\n\n58\n00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.490\nif I really use the plus and really,\nreally get in on those audio waves,\n\n59\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.920\nyou'll see I am now moving subframes.\n\n60\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.060\nI've really zoomed in.\n\n61\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.890\nSo if you're really, so into audio,\nthis could be great for you.\n\n62\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.200\nIf not, just turn it off and\nwork in frames.\n\n63\n00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.680\nSee, notice what happened?\n\n64\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.890\nIt jumped back to a reasonable zoom in for\nframes, not subframes.\n\n65\n00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.060\nSo you don't always need\nto use the audio units.\n\n66\n00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.120\nYou can also view the audio units in the\nsource monitor and the program monitor.\n\n67\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.680\nSo you can zoom in that much to drop a\npoint or a marker, or something like that.\n\n68\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.290\nLast thing was, is hey, you said I could\nget rid of all those track keyframes\n\n69\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.700\nusing some kinda pen thing.\n\n70\n00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.230\nIt's like, yeah,\nif I go back out to the tool menu,\n\n71\n00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.930\nokay, if you wanna just jump\nout into it real quick,\n\n72\n00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.330\nyou'll see you've got the selector and\nthe razor and all that.\n\n73\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.280\nIf you go close to the bottom,\nthere's a pen tool.\n\n74\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.509\nLooks like an old fashioned pen.\n\n75\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.918\nI'm just gonna use the P key, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:55.918 --> 00:03:59.250\nP, boom, and now I get that pen tool.\n\n77\n00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.260\nAnd what I'm allowed to do, let me go\nback to Track Keyframes > Volume, that's\n\n78\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.170\nwhere I can say, hey, let me go down the\nline here, let me zoom back a little bit.\n\n79\n00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.570\nHey, there's a bunch of\nkeyframes right there.\n\n80\n00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.590\nWhen I have the pen tool, I can say all\nright, I'm gonna lasso those keyframes,\n\n81\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.160\nand they all turn blue.\n\n82\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.120\nBlue shirt, blue highlight, boom.\n\n83\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.370\nDelete, and now these keyframes are gone.\n\n84\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.730\nSo, if you need to delete keyframes or\nmove them like that, okay,\n\n85\n00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.810\nor if I hold down the Command key, bezier\ncurve them, I can do that in the pen tool.\n\n86\n00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.337\nIf I wanna go back to the selector,\nit's the V key, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:39.570\nIt's V because it look like\nlittle arrow pointing down.\n\n88\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.170\nAll right?\n\n89\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.010\nSo, I just, I took care of\nsome of those keyframes, and\n\n90\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.690\nI have dealt with all of that.\n\n91\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.870\nThe other thing you might be asking\nis hey, I've got clip keyframes,\n\n92\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.065\nI have track keyframes.\n\n93\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.160\nReally, is there a difference?\n\n94\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.240\nYes, there is.\n\n95\n00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.520\nSometimes you really just\nneed to affect the clip.\n\n96\n00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.220\nOther times, you need to affect the track.\n\n97\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.970\nAnd please notice, I have already\nadded some fades in here, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.870\nI've added some crossfades,\nand if I do a mix and\n\n99\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.050\nI'm just doing the clips,\nthat could really effect my crossfades.\n\n100\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.989\nOr at least to me, to my ear it seems\nlike, I'm affecting the crossfades.\n\n101\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.750\nOnce you work with a little bit of audio,\nyou can just talk some terms and\n\n102\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.060\nbe dangerous and\npeople will back away from you.\n\n103\n00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.410\nWhat I would do is I would say I'm gonna\ndo it in the track because that affects\n\n104\n00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.240\nthe track itself, and that's gonna\nstay away from these dissolves.\n\n105\n00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.830\nOkay?\n\n106\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.780\nThat I put onto my clips.\n\n107\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.855\nAnd people are okay, yeah, yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:37.855 --> 00:05:38.800\nThat's cool.\n\n109\n00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.910\nThat's the general audio answer.\n\n110\n00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.940\nWhen anybody says anything about it,\nsay, yeah it is cool, yeah,\n\n111\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.400\nI know that, okay, yeah, right on.\n\n112\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.750\nOkay, just don't let them know, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.670\nLet me jump back out.\n\n114\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.490\nEffects.\n\n115\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.960\nEffects can be added in one of two ways,\nand we've done it before.\n\n116\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.980\nLet me come down here.\n\n117\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.350\nBoom, that stack, isn't that cool?\n\n118\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.760\nThis stacking?\n\n119\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.710\nIt's great because now, if I jump\ninto the stack, this one pops up and\n\n120\n00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.110\nthe other part of the stack closes.\n\n121\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.690\nSo, you can experiment now with\nstacking your panels, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.050\nThat's kind of fun.\n\n123\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.810\nSo, again,\nI have some audio effects in here.\n\n124\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.440\nThese are the ones that\nare available from Adobe itself.\n\n125\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.420\nCan you add plugins?\n\n126\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.370\nAbsolutely, there are a lot of really\ngreat, if you've got the cash,\n\n127\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.300\nthere's a lot of great plugins out\nthere that you can use with Adobe.\n\n128\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.710\nYou can look them up,\nand they will say, yeah,\n\n129\n00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.330\ncompatible with Premier,\nhere's where you put them, awesome.\n\n130\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.060\nIt's great, so you can use that.\n\n131\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.972\nI'm just gonna use some of\nthe standard Adobe ones for now, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:42.972 --> 00:06:44.354\nIt's like this.\n\n133\n00:06:44.354 --> 00:06:50.510\nIf you want to add to a specific clip,\nlet's say you've got a clip,\n\n134\n00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.860\nand you need to equalize it a little bit,\nokay?\n\n135\n00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.190\nIt's a little too bass heavy,\nyou wanna equalize it up a little bit.\n\n136\n00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.000\nI can look through here for\nsome equalizers.\n\n137\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.220\nNow, what Adobe has done, and especially\nwhen we go into color correction,\n\n138\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.060\nis they have some that are just like, hey,\n\n139\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.350\nyou could go to the equalizer and\nmess around with it.\n\n140\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.860\nThere's the EQ right there.\n\n141\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.414\nAnd mess around with it and\ncreate your own equalization curve.\n\n142\n00:07:17.414 --> 00:07:18.954\nIt's really cool.\n\n143\n00:07:18.954 --> 00:07:26.660\nBut we've already actually made some that\nare pre-built, like a lowpass filter.\n\n144\n00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.940\nIf you've ever needed\na lowpass filter before,\n\n145\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.850\nthat means if you've got some noise in\nthe high in its frequency, you can say,\n\n146\n00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.660\nhey, I want only the low\nfrequencies to pass through.\n\n147\n00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.630\nAnd the highs will get filtered.\n\n148\n00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.870\nSame thing with a high pass filter,\nall right?\n\n149\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.593\nYou've also got some noise that\nyou can deal with if you're,\n\n150\n00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:46.828\nyou have a Guitar Suite,\nyou have a Flanger, [SOUND].\n\n151\n00:07:46.828 --> 00:07:48.998\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n152\n00:07:48.998 --> 00:07:49.981\n>> All kinds of things.\n\n153\n00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:51.250\nA multiband compressor.\n\n154\n00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.971\nSome of these things,\nif you're really into them, it's like,\n\n155\n00:07:53.971 --> 00:07:55.359\nwhat is a multiband Compressor?\n\n156\n00:07:55.359 --> 00:07:56.403\nCompressor, what does it do?\n\n157\n00:07:56.403 --> 00:08:01.483\nThere are some great forums for\nsome people that do a lot of heavy audio\n\n158\n00:08:01.483 --> 00:08:06.227\nthat will talk to you for\na very long time about what they do okay.\n\n159\n00:08:06.227 --> 00:08:10.952\nLet me just go ahead and\nget something like a, I don't know.\n\n160\n00:08:10.952 --> 00:08:13.170\nNotice we also have some\nother interesting things.\n\n161\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.572\nWe have a swap channels.\n\n162\n00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:19.708\nAnd if you've forgotten,\nthis is one of my favorites.\n\n163\n00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:23.013\nYou can do fill left with right,\nfill right with left, and\n\n164\n00:08:23.013 --> 00:08:25.044\nit can only be used on stereo clips.\n\n165\n00:08:25.044 --> 00:08:28.428\nSo, in the music one, if I had\na stereo clip in the single track,\n\n166\n00:08:28.428 --> 00:08:32.510\nand I didn't wanna go back,\nI could just drag that effect on it.\n\n167\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.135\nSo they've added a lot of this\nstuff in it that's really cool.\n\n168\n00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:40.733\nDehammmers, you have some things that\nare legacy as in I really like that past\n\n169\n00:08:40.733 --> 00:08:41.377\nversion.\n\n170\n00:08:41.377 --> 00:08:42.728\nOkay, well, here is this one.\n\n171\n00:08:42.728 --> 00:08:43.581\nI was like okay, thank you.\n\n172\n00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:44.594\nYou're really nice.\n\n173\n00:08:44.594 --> 00:08:49.501\nSo let's just say for\nsome strange reason I wanted just\n\n174\n00:08:49.501 --> 00:08:54.205\na general equalizer on I\ndon't know this first one.\n\n175\n00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:55.802\nI will just drag it right on there.\n\n176\n00:08:55.802 --> 00:09:00.625\nBoom, notice, it's going to both,\nwhich is nice.\n\n177\n00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:06.438\nNow, when I go to the Effects area,\nokay, and I'm going to essentially,\n\n178\n00:09:06.438 --> 00:09:10.427\nwhat am I gonna do,\nthe Effects controls on there.\n\n179\n00:09:10.427 --> 00:09:13.031\nI'm gonna have to do them separately.\n\n180\n00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:17.119\nOkay, I'm going to have to do them\nseparately if I'm doing them as a clip.\n\n181\n00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:20.296\nIf I'm doing it is a track like\nhere we go boom, let me get this.\n\n182\n00:09:20.296 --> 00:09:21.607\nLet me go to window.\n\n183\n00:09:21.607 --> 00:09:22.748\nWhere my effects controls?\n\n184\n00:09:22.748 --> 00:09:24.600\nThere they are, boom.\n\n185\n00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.000\nSo now there's one there and\nif I come down there's one there.\n\n186\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.034\nWhat could I do?\n\n187\n00:09:32.034 --> 00:09:36.941\nI could do that cool thing that I\nhave done before where I'll take one\n\n188\n00:09:36.941 --> 00:09:39.792\ncopy/paste, the paste attributes.\n\n189\n00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:43.359\nI'll do the attributes thing, no problem.\n\n190\n00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:47.418\nWhat if I don't wanna hear\nthe bottom one while I'm working?\n\n191\n00:09:47.418 --> 00:09:50.092\nYou do have a mute.\n\n192\n00:09:50.092 --> 00:09:54.332\nMute will mute individual tracks,\nand I can mute as much as I want.\n\n193\n00:09:54.332 --> 00:09:58.032\nOr I can solo,\nI can just say I wanna solo this track and\n\n194\n00:09:58.032 --> 00:10:01.992\nit mutes everything else\nexcept the one that's in solo.\n\n195\n00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:06.577\nI can solo multiple tracks,\nlike I only wanna hear two and three.\n\n196\n00:10:06.577 --> 00:10:10.751\nIf I got a 24 track thing going, and\nit's like I only wanna hear two and three,\n\n197\n00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:13.885\nit's easier to solo two and\nthree than to mute everything-\n\n198\n00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:14.539\n>> 22 other, yeah.\n\n199\n00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:16.142\n>> Than to mute 22 others.\n\n200\n00:10:16.142 --> 00:10:16.710\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n201\n00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.364\nthat's the difference between solo and\nmute.\n\n202\n00:10:18.364 --> 00:10:20.527\nSo I'll just solo this one for now, hey.\n\n203\n00:10:20.527 --> 00:10:24.604\nSo boom, now, individual parameters,\n\n204\n00:10:24.604 --> 00:10:32.066\nI can do all these individual parameters\ndown here or I can do a custom setup.\n\n205\n00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:35.878\nA lot of these have really cool\ninterfaces, where I can say, all right,\n\n206\n00:10:35.878 --> 00:10:39.040\nlet me just take this mid right here and\nbump that up okay?\n\n207\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.056\nJust sort of in that audible range, so\nI can give myself a little more presence.\n\n208\n00:10:45.365 --> 00:10:46.608\nThat's a little tinny.\n\n209\n00:10:46.608 --> 00:10:50.320\nI can make it a little tinny,\nI can make it bassy,\n\n210\n00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.408\nwhatever I want on the individual clip.\n\n211\n00:10:53.408 --> 00:10:56.061\n>> Can you make yourself\nsound like James Earl Jones?\n\n212\n00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:57.922\nI'm not that good.\n\n213\n00:10:57.922 --> 00:11:01.670\nIt has to start with a good\nvoice too which mine is not.\n\n214\n00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.334\nIf I want to effect the whole track okay.\n\n215\n00:11:05.334 --> 00:11:11.665\nAnd again it's just like audio\neffects are just like video effects.\n\n216\n00:11:11.665 --> 00:11:16.214\nI can drag a bunch of them onto\nan individual clip and make a preset.\n\n217\n00:11:16.214 --> 00:11:18.873\nSo if you've been practicing with that,\nit's like, just do it with audio.\n\n218\n00:11:18.873 --> 00:11:22.461\nDrag a bunch on there, make a preset,\ndrag that onto others.\n\n219\n00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:23.460\nAll kind of things.\n\n220\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.529\nBut if I want to affect the whole track,\nokay,\n\n221\n00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:29.380\nlet's say I've got all my voice in there.\n\n222\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:35.186\nI've got all my music, everything in that\ntrack is supposed to have reverb, or it's,\n\n223\n00:11:35.186 --> 00:11:40.213\nI'm gonna use reverb today, just\nbecause it's the easiest thing to hear.\n\n224\n00:11:40.213 --> 00:11:41.730\nOkay, I'm just reverb is there.\n\n225\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.370\nCompression you have to sort of tune\nyour ear and equalization all that.\n\n226\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.540\nWe’re just gonna use reverb\ncuz they're really cool.\n\n227\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.768\nSo, what I did before is I, [CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n228\n00:11:52.768 --> 00:11:54.101\n>> We are, we are off.\n\n229\n00:11:54.101 --> 00:12:01.470\nSo, what I could do is I could, I now\nhave the ability with this submaster.\n\n230\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.423\nThe submaster does channel or\ntracks one and two.\n\n231\n00:12:05.423 --> 00:12:10.447\nSo now because that's submaster,\nI could put an effect on just track one,\n\n232\n00:12:10.447 --> 00:12:13.557\njust track two, or\nto the submaster itself and\n\n233\n00:12:13.557 --> 00:12:17.570\nit will affect both at the same time,\nwhich is really nice.\n\n234\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.304\nSo like I said,\n\n235\n00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:22.488\nif I'm working with individual parameters\nlike you've done a bunch of sound effects.\n\n236\n00:12:22.488 --> 00:12:25.408\nYou've got cars here, and\nthis here and that here.\n\n237\n00:12:25.408 --> 00:12:30.793\nYou've built individual effects on the car\ntracks, but on the overall submaster for\n\n238\n00:12:30.793 --> 00:12:34.552\nall your sound effects,\nyou have put a compressor, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:34.552 --> 00:12:35.858\nSo, let's just do that for both.\n\n240\n00:12:35.858 --> 00:12:38.284\nI'm gonna go to the submaster and\ngo to here.\n\n241\n00:12:38.284 --> 00:12:42.986\nI have Amplitude and\nCompression, Delay and Echo.\n\n242\n00:12:42.986 --> 00:12:47.573\nIf you've ever used delay before,\ndelay can be a really nice effect,\n\n243\n00:12:47.573 --> 00:12:50.781\nespecially if you use it\na very small pinch of it.\n\n244\n00:12:50.781 --> 00:12:55.934\nLike let's say you have done a thing where\nsomebody's outside talking, and then\n\n245\n00:12:55.934 --> 00:13:01.103\nyou have to record them in a studio and it\nclearly sounds like they're in a studio.\n\n246\n00:13:01.103 --> 00:13:03.202\nAnd you've made the lips sync up and\nall that.\n\n247\n00:13:03.202 --> 00:13:07.701\nYou can add a little bit of delay to make\nit sound like they're sort of what we like\n\n248\n00:13:07.701 --> 00:13:10.337\nto say back into the picture,\nnot on top of it.\n\n249\n00:13:10.337 --> 00:13:12.859\nSo a minute amount of delay works there.\n\n250\n00:13:12.859 --> 00:13:16.337\nEQ there are so many EQ's like I said.\n\n251\n00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:20.185\nYou can, and they pre-built some of them,\nlike a notch filter.\n\n252\n00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:23.940\nLike occasionally you may have\none errant frequency, and\n\n253\n00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.764\nwhat it does is on the eqalsition curve\ncages a little notch just around that\n\n254\n00:13:28.764 --> 00:13:31.533\nfrequency to sort of filter it out, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:33.569\nSo you have some on the sides.\n\n256\n00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:37.770\nI can do that in the EQ by\ncreating my own notch, or\n\n257\n00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:43.316\nthe advantage of the EQ is I can\ncreate multiple notches in that.\n\n258\n00:13:43.316 --> 00:13:47.550\nSo I have all this stuff I can do.\n\n259\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.762\nOne thing we might try and\n\n260\n00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:51.841\ndo a lesson on in the future is\nthe fact we have noise reduction.\n\n261\n00:13:51.841 --> 00:13:56.640\nWe have some that are pre-built like\na de-clicker, a de-crackler, a de-hummer.\n\n262\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.920\nOccasionally, you might get hum\nfrom lights and machinery, and\n\n263\n00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.019\nyou pick a frequency range to\nquote unquote bust that hum out,\n\n264\n00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:05.180\nif you ever a hum buster, it's like that.\n\n265\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.286\nDenoiser, spectral noise reduction.\n\n266\n00:14:07.286 --> 00:14:11.840\nThe thing is, once you start getting into\nreally cool effects they have names that\n\n267\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.357\nare both exciting and\nscary at the same time.\n\n268\n00:14:14.357 --> 00:14:15.847\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like a spectral noise, it's like,\n\n269\n00:14:15.847 --> 00:14:17.252\nI don't even know what a spectrum is.\n\n270\n00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:18.730\n>> That's from Ghostbusters days.\n\n271\n00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.254\n>> Exactly, it's like, don't cross that.\n\n272\n00:14:21.254 --> 00:14:24.216\nAnd then you have some\nspecific Apple plugins.\n\n273\n00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:28.231\nThey have the AU, band pass filters,\ngraphic equalizers, so\n\n274\n00:14:28.231 --> 00:14:30.750\nthese are like A plugin almost, okay?\n\n275\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.608\nAnd you have those.\n\n276\n00:14:31.608 --> 00:14:33.849\nSo let me just go to Reverb, and\n\n277\n00:14:33.849 --> 00:14:38.430\nI'm not gonna worry about Surround,\njust a standard reverb.\n\n278\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.322\nPut it on there.\n\n279\n00:14:40.322 --> 00:14:46.043\nThe interesting thing is they've given\nme so many ways to control this.\n\n280\n00:14:46.043 --> 00:14:51.308\nI can come down here and click this guy,\nand here's all the settings.\n\n281\n00:14:51.308 --> 00:14:56.431\nAnd I can go through each setting and\nadjust this dial for each setting.\n\n282\n00:14:56.431 --> 00:14:57.130\nWhy?\n\n283\n00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.980\nBecause some people that come in to\nthis had those giant boards with all\n\n284\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.628\nthe different knobs, and it's like,\nI don't like that graphic interface thing.\n\n285\n00:15:05.628 --> 00:15:07.211\nI want the little knobs.\n\n286\n00:15:07.211 --> 00:15:10.197\nSo it'll allow you to go through\nthe little knobs and change them that way.\n\n287\n00:15:10.197 --> 00:15:13.514\nA lot of people feel\ncomfortable with that.\n\n288\n00:15:13.514 --> 00:15:14.221\nI'm an editor.\n\n289\n00:15:14.221 --> 00:15:15.794\nI like graphic things.\n\n290\n00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:21.293\nSo if I now double-click and\nI notice I have five slots.\n\n291\n00:15:21.293 --> 00:15:24.792\nIf I double click, I get this.\n\n292\n00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:29.453\nI love this on the reverb it is like I\nget this nice little graphic of here\n\n293\n00:15:29.453 --> 00:15:34.043\nis the room, here is the absorption and\nI have all this cool presets.\n\n294\n00:15:34.043 --> 00:15:35.840\nLike I could say drummer drum out Jay.\n\n295\n00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.039\nLarge room dark and\nnotice the curve changes.\n\n296\n00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.910\nAnd then I could change\nthe parameters here.\n\n297\n00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:46.432\nThis is what when people start working\nwith this do I have to do like a motion?\n\n298\n00:15:46.432 --> 00:15:49.948\nNope, you just go up and\ndown on the dial down wall.\n\n299\n00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:53.947\nYou just click on it and got up and\ndown so we now have a 100%.\n\n300\n00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:56.230\nAnd I say okay I like that.\n\n301\n00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.186\nNow lets take a listen.\n\n302\n00:15:57.186 --> 00:16:00.877\n>> [INAUDIBLE] And the reason why.\n\n303\n00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:06.180\n>> I have the largest garden space ever\nthat is surrounded by concrete it's.\n\n304\n00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.360\n>> Like the astrodome.\n\n305\n00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.650\n>> Exactly surrounded by concrete and\ntile.\n\n306\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:15.960\nI can, here's an interesting part,\nif I hit this little effects right here.\n\n307\n00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.980\n>> That will essentially turn it on and\nturn it off.\n\n308\n00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.680\nSo, I can say, okay,\nwhat's it like with it?\n\n309\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.000\nWhat's it like without it.\n\n310\n00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.640\nAnd I can, I can bypass that.\n\n311\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.740\nI can bypass that.\n\n312\n00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.760\nAnd I can stack even more,\nI could add an equalization to this,\n\n313\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.600\nI could add a compressor, okay, people\nwho are really like into a compression,\n\n314\n00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.400\nyou know,\nit's like equalize then you can press.\n\n315\n00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.620\nI can also put affects on\nthe overall master, like let's say I\n\n316\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.580\ndon't know what your delivery is maybe\nyou have specific delivery to TV or\n\n317\n00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.225\nto the web and\nyou realized okay I'm going to the web and\n\n318\n00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:58.965\nit sounds really good through\na great set of speakers.\n\n319\n00:16:58.965 --> 00:17:01.095\nI think we've all been through this,\nI got this great set of speakers,\n\n320\n00:17:01.095 --> 00:17:06.655\nand it sounds really great, let me\nlisten to it on my computer's speakers.\n\n321\n00:17:06.655 --> 00:17:11.930\nAnd you listen to it on the computer,\nand it's really way over what you need,\n\n322\n00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:17.690\nand what you find yourself doing is\nsort of, you know, hitting this a lot.\n\n323\n00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.360\nIt's like, you hit that volume and\nit goes all the way up and\n\n324\n00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.310\nit's still not really where it needs\nto be for a set of computer speakers.\n\n325\n00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.360\nWhat I usually do, and this is not,\nyou have to do this, this is my technique.\n\n326\n00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.230\nI get it right about in the middle and\nthen I will start\n\n327\n00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.680\ncompressing it to say okay I'm taking\nthe dynamic range which is huge and\n\n328\n00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.370\nI'm saying, I'm making this dynamic\nrange for a set of computer speakers.\n\n329\n00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:47.780\nAnd so for the person that's gonna watch\nthis, they'll have more control over\n\n330\n00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.090\nThe keys to make it loader and softer in\ntheir headphones are on their computer.\n\n331\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.710\nAnd I'm gonna do that on\nthe overall master okay.\n\n332\n00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.450\nI'll do that on the overall\nmaster of everything.\n\n333\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.390\n>> And that's so\nthat it effects everything.\n\n334\n00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.900\n>> Right.\n>> Because if you leave something out then\n\n335\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.550\nit's gonna be kind of\nwonky with everything.\n\n336\n00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.510\n>> Right.\n>> With everything else right?\n\n337\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.390\n>> And you'll figure out you\ndon't have to use very much.\n\n338\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.180\n>> You can use very little compression and\neverything is fine.\n\n339\n00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.670\nThe other thing that Adobe has\nadded that you, they've got a great\n\n340\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:16.230\npage on how to work this, you have\nsomething now called a loudness radar.\n\n341\n00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.770\nAnd I am going to let\nyou see the interface.\n\n342\n00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:27.490\nBasically we now have especially for\ntelevision this thing called the calm act.\n\n343\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.760\nWhich was the whole thing\nabout everybody got\n\n344\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.230\nupset about Explodes\nout of your television.\n\n345\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.410\nSo now there are rules\non your peak volume.\n\n346\n00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.360\nAnd what they've done is they've\ngiven you this radar to see\n\n347\n00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.430\nare you within compliance.\n\n348\n00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.614\nAnd so if I play,\n[SOUND] it's showing you the range,\n\n349\n00:18:50.614 --> 00:18:56.346\nthe little peak meter will go\nred if you done it, see yeah.\n\n350\n00:18:56.346 --> 00:18:58.010\nSo I hit a peak.\n\n351\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.490\nAnd you can kinda figure out where that\nhappened on the radar, scroll back and\n\n352\n00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.810\nsay okay.\n\n353\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.860\nI need to fix this.\n\n354\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.150\nI need to bring the overall level down or\nmaybe I just need make a little\n\n355\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:13.470\ntweak in there, or\nmaybe add an effect to change that out.\n\n356\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.980\nAnd that's what the loudest radar does and\nit gives you a good idea\n\n357\n00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.730\nof what's going on with your loudness and\nif you're having any problem.\n\n358\n00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.530\nSo that's a cool thing\nto put on the master.\n\n359\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.110\nYou can stack five of these.\n\n360\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.980\nIt can get so absurd, sometimes,\nwhen you're doing big mixes for things,\n\n361\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.200\nthat you've got effects on the track, and\nthen you've got effects on submasters, and\n\n362\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.750\nthen you've got effect on the master.\n\n363\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:39.130\nJust remember, sometimes, when you put\ntoo many effects, especially on audio.\n\n364\n00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.700\nIt becomes very apparent\nthat you've touched it,\n\n365\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.180\nyou've put your fingerprints all over it.\n\n366\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.970\nSo very, very subtle changes, and\nlike I said, there are a lot of forums on,\n\n367\n00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.580\nhey I need to boost\nthe audio a little bit and\n\n368\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.790\nI have to tweak the EQ,\nwhat do you guys use?\n\n369\n00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:58.890\nHow do you do it.\n\n370\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.790\n>> I'm thinking more Hollywood audio\npeople should use that radar thing cuz we\n\n371\n00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.010\nwere talking about this the other\nday when watching a movie and\n\n372\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.980\neverybody's whispering, and\nall of a sudden an effect happens and\n\n373\n00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.510\nit's as loud as it can be, and you're like\n>> Can't they find some happy medium\n\n374\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.610\nwhere one volume kinda suits everything?\n\n375\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.360\n>> They should watch\nthat radar a little more.\n\n376\n00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.130\n>> Right.\nAnd also another effect, in here,\n\n377\n00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.310\nyes you have the ability\nto adjust punning in here.\n\n378\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.410\nOkay, and then you do that on your tracks\nand you do it on your on your clips it's\n\n379\n00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:31.340\nlike, you know, sometimes maybe the music\nyou wanna take the music and our move\n\n380\n00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:36.520\nsomebody slightly off center whether\nspeaking the other person and off right.\n\n381\n00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.000\nSomething I could do that here,\nI can also key frame that so,\n\n382\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.190\nI can key frame that as well.\n\n383\n00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:48.340\nJust by saying you know what hey,\nI'm gonna do right and\n\n384\n00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.310\nthen turn that as it's going and\nthen you know.\n\n385\n00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:55.140\nBut just remember that can get very\ndisorienting for people, so be very, very.\n\n386\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:55.890\n>> Take your Dramamine.\n\n387\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.790\n>> Last thing I want to deal with audio\neffects is sometimes this will happen\n\n388\n00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:04.310\ndepending on how many sets of speakers\nyou have or something like that.\n\n389\n00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.406\nI'm gonna go back to Preferences and\ngo to Audio and\n\n390\n00:21:07.406 --> 00:21:11.584\nwe had all this about bringing audio but\nthen we have Audio Hardware.\n\n391\n00:21:14.322 --> 00:21:19.420\nIf you wanna do voiceovers,\nthey're actually very, very easy.\n\n392\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.870\nI'll do a quick one.\n\n393\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.260\nBut you have a default input, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.900\nAnd if you have more microphones and\nall that, you've\n\n395\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.530\nplugged in maybe a little board, you\nwould want to take your input from that.\n\n396\n00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.370\nThis is the thing that happens,\nyou may have more than one output.\n\n397\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:40.170\nI'm using a computer now\nthat has four audio outputs.\n\n398\n00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:45.760\nAnd I'll start playing around\nin a Adobe Premier I'm like\n\n399\n00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.760\nwhy I'm not hearing anything,\nI didn't check my out put and\n\n400\n00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.580\nit get switched to a set of USB headphones\nor microphone that I have on there so\n\n401\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.770\nthat I can have a little\nconference call and for\n\n402\n00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.770\nsome reasons it got switched to that and I\nwill say now I need to set it my main out.\n\n403\n00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.970\nSo occasionally you will need\nto take a look at that okay,\n\n404\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:10.400\nyou might need to take a look at that\nwhich would kinda be, I don't know, good.\n\n405\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.540\nAnd then of course control surfaces,\nif you wanna buy a nice control surface so\n\n406\n00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.980\nyou'll have your own mixer,\nyou can bring that in and you would need\n\n407\n00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:25.250\na you would essentially get what's called\na software protocol to control it.\n\n408\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.100\nSo when you're looking up these\ntypes of controllers that you\n\n409\n00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.960\nmight be interested in\nyou don't need a big one,\n\n410\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.610\nyou don't need one with 24 tracks you can\nget away with one with four or eight.\n\n411\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:38.120\nI have a little one with eight n there and\nI can still do 24 about doing this little\n\n412\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:43.220\ncycle overlay int he software which\nis really easy to use and look it up\n\n413\n00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:49.620\nit's like do you work with the Adobe\nPremier if I move the fader will it move?\n\n414\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.360\nIf I do this will it move?\n\n415\n00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.980\nIf it does all this is it\ngonna do that and so yeah,\n\n416\n00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.300\nyou may wanna ask\nyourself those questions.\n\n417\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:06.020\nNow, the reason I'm just gonna address the\nidea of doing a voiceover very quickly.\n\n418\n00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.960\nSome people do these.\n\n419\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.010\nSome people don't.\n\n420\n00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.430\nIt depends on systems you're\ncoming out of before.\n\n421\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.660\nI have an A4 here.\n\n422\n00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.780\nIt used to be, you just kind of record,\nin some systems you recorded just like\n\n423\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.010\nsomething and\nthen you just ended up on a track.\n\n424\n00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.440\nOne of the cool things I can\ndo is change these headers.\n\n425\n00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.430\nI can control click and\nyou're really a big Audio head.\n\n426\n00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:38.940\nOkay, I can customize this thing and\nI can add new stuff.\n\n427\n00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.520\nWhat is the new stuff?\n\n428\n00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.272\nWell, I can actually add\na little individual audio\n\n429\n00:23:46.272 --> 00:23:51.146\nmeter to each and every track and\nit's really cool.\n\n430\n00:23:51.146 --> 00:23:55.926\nSo now, all of them have their own\nlittle audio meters that you can see.\n\n431\n00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:59.009\nIn each track, which is really cool.\n\n432\n00:23:59.009 --> 00:24:03.386\nThe other thing is if I'm going to do\na voice over, all I have to do is tell it\n\n433\n00:24:03.386 --> 00:24:07.990\nwhich track I'm recording it into,\nand it records into there.\n\n434\n00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.973\nThe other thing I can do is control\nclick it and say all right,\n\n435\n00:24:10.973 --> 00:24:12.974\nlet me look at my voice record settings.\n\n436\n00:24:14.602 --> 00:24:18.700\nAnd this is how I can get\nusing the microphone, okay?\n\n437\n00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.820\nThis is how I can set a bunch of things.\n\n438\n00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.070\nI can say all right, there's my level.\n\n439\n00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.610\nThat's pretty good.\n\n440\n00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.430\nI should really be listening to it.\n\n441\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:30.500\nI could put a pre-roll on it,\nas in, I hit record, and\n\n442\n00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.740\nthen it goes back three seconds,\nand then I know I'm ready to go.\n\n443\n00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.260\nI can do a count down sound ques,\nit will give me the little blips.\n\n444\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.850\nI can do that.\n\n445\n00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:46.020\nAnd then instead of, since I'm on\nthis track, I can name it Voice Over,\n\n446\n00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.120\njust like that, and\nit's set and it's ready to go.\n\n447\n00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.496\nI can change the source,\nI can change the input if I needed to.\n\n448\n00:24:54.496 --> 00:24:59.860\nClick close, that's good, voice on record.\n\n449\n00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.099\nSo now I can record my voice,\n\n450\n00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.230\nIt gives me a lot of feedback\nbecause it's coming through there.\n\n451\n00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.620\nOkay, because it's coming through there,\nso\n\n452\n00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.230\nthat's why I'd want to do it in\nheadphones, but it's recording.\n\n453\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.350\nThe other cool thing I could do\nthat a lot of people don't know,\n\n454\n00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.810\nis let's say I just needed to record\na voice within a specific area.\n\n455\n00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:26.160\nI could go, I and O, and\n\n456\n00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.930\ntell it to just go, to just go between the\nin and the out point, and keep recording\n\n457\n00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.980\nit again, and again, and again, and again,\nand it's going to keep giving me files.\n\n458\n00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.670\nIt will keep giving me files, and\nthese will be real files, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.860\nThese will be real files.\n\n460\n00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:45.260\nLet me go back to my project,\nand there's my voice over wave.\n\n461\n00:25:46.575 --> 00:25:48.340\nControl click, where did it go?\n\n462\n00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:55.829\nIf I reveal it in the Finder,\nit's basically telling me\n\n463\n00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.340\nit went to the place\nwhere projects settings.\n\n464\n00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:09.500\nScratch disks, where you sent\nthe scratch disk for captured audio.\n\n465\n00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.130\nThat's where it's going, and\nthat's where you would find it.\n\n466\n00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.580\nCool.\n\n467\n00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.420\nI can do it from there,\nI can do it from up here.\n\n468\n00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.650\nI can set it to record up here.\n\n469\n00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.262\nI can activate the track.\n\n470\n00:26:21.262 --> 00:26:24.540\nOkay, I can activate the track to record,\n\n471\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.080\nthis is my voice over record,\nhit record, and then hit play.\n\n472\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.920\nThere it is.\n\n473\n00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.030\nNotice I have play into out.\n\n474\n00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.960\nSo, if I set that into\nout to do the voice over,\n\n475\n00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.520\nit'll just go from the in to the out.\n\n476\n00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:42.040\nAnd then I can do it again, and again,\nand again, and again, if you just need to\n\n477\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.756\nrecord one thing in between that\narea to replace a line of dialogue.\n\n478\n00:26:45.756 --> 00:26:49.770\nSo that's voice over,\nand it's pretty cool.\n\n479\n00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:50.610\n>> Yeah, it's pretty slick.\n\n480\n00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:54.710\nI mean, Adobe really has\nleft no stone unturned when\n\n481\n00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.100\nit comes to all the bells and whistles\nthat they've thrown inside of Premier.\n\n482\n00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.465\n>> Like I said, they listen, and\n\n483\n00:26:59.465 --> 00:27:01.915\nvoice over is fun to play around\nwith because you really can't,\n\n484\n00:27:01.915 --> 00:27:05.735\nespecially if you just go into an empty\ntrack, you really can't wreck anything.\n\n485\n00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:07.265\nOkay?\nYou'll create some new media, that's fine,\n\n486\n00:27:07.265 --> 00:27:08.425\nbut you really can't wreck anything,\n\n487\n00:27:08.425 --> 00:27:10.595\nand then you can play\naround with these headers.\n\n488\n00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:13.840\nLike I said, the headers, when you\nget kind of detailed on these things,\n\n489\n00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.560\nthese can be really fun.\n\n490\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.510\nIt's like, yeah, I've got my own\nlittle audio track meters in here now.\n\n491\n00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.260\nAnd then there's the voice over records,\nthere it goes.\n\n492\n00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.220\nAnd again, by control clicking\non a header, you can rename,\n\n493\n00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.560\nI could add a track down here,\nI can add a sub mix,\n\n494\n00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.080\nI can delete this track,\nI could just do a generic Add Tracks.\n\n495\n00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.360\nAnd a lot of people say\nwhy is there Add Track?\n\n496\n00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.120\nWhy is there Add Submix, and\nthen why is there Add Tracks?\n\n497\n00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.240\nBecause maybe I decide instead of just\nadding one track, I need to add five.\n\n498\n00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.370\nInstead of going Add Track,\nAdd Track, Add Track, Add Track,\n\n499\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:49.730\nI'll go to Add Tracks and then say I\nneed five, and two submixes and this.\n\n500\n00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:53.850\nAnd then again, I can go to\nthe Record Settings, take a look at that,\n\n501\n00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:54.790\nsee what I'm doing.\n\n502\n00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:00.160\nIt's not like it's a hit or miss process.\n\n503\n00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.950\nA lot of people used to complain\nto me about other systems,\n\n504\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:06.230\nthey'd say it seems like voice over is so\nmuch, it's hit or miss.\n\n505\n00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.820\nNot in Adobe, you get the same amount\nof control that you get for effects or\n\n506\n00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.650\nmixing by using this voice over tool.\n\n507\n00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.360\n>> Yeah.\nIt's one stop shopping.\n\n508\n00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.770\n>> It really is.\n>> They don't mess around,\n\n509\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.665\nthey say this is a completely\nencompassed package for\n\n510\n00:28:19.665 --> 00:28:22.760\nyou to be able to do all your audio and\nvideo editing.\n\n511\n00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.440\n>> Yeah.\n\n512\n00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.490\nIt's not just this weird little option.\n\n513\n00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:27.621\nIt's an actual tool.\n\n514\n00:28:27.621 --> 00:28:28.978\n>> Right.\n>> That your can use.\n\n515\n00:28:28.978 --> 00:28:31.920\n>> Wasn't something they\nslapped on as an afterthought.\n\n516\n00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.020\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, you got to do some audio.\n\n517\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.048\n>> Yeah, and like I said,\nyou can use that header, or\n\n518\n00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:41.466\nif you're a big track mixer person,\nyou can do record.\n\n519\n00:28:41.466 --> 00:28:47.025\nArm the whole thing for recording,\nand then do play or down here.\n\n520\n00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:49.100\nI just have to arm the whole thing for\nrecording.\n\n521\n00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.012\nAnd then hit play, or play it out.\n\n522\n00:28:52.012 --> 00:28:55.440\nIt's like, if you ever had a cassette\ndeck, you had to hit record and then play.\n\n523\n00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.830\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then you got it.\n\n524\n00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.930\nThose were the days.\n\n525\n00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:58.940\n>> They were the days.\n\n526\n00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:03.620\n>> And again, you are also seeing\nsome coordinated stuff up here.\n\n527\n00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.480\nMute and\nsolo are also available in the timeline.\n\n528\n00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.330\nSo if you're working in here,\n\n529\n00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.240\nit's not like you have to jump\nback in the time line to mute or\n\n530\n00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.910\nsolo, I can mute here, or\nI can solo here no problem.\n\n531\n00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:19.200\nSo yeah, it's nice,\nthey've taken into consideration\n\n532\n00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.190\na lot of different types of people doing\na lot of different types of work in Adobe.\n\n533\n00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.450\nSo If it's one of those\nsituations it's like, wow,\n\n534\n00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:30.710\nI've learned all this stuff, I really\ndon't know this other stuff in Premiere.\n\n535\n00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:36.290\nThat's okay, you may never use it or\nyou may use it to such a small extent\n\n536\n00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.510\nthat you just want to go somewhere and\nlearn something quickly about it\n\n537\n00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:43.580\ninstead of extending an overall knowledge,\nif you will.\n\n538\n00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.120\nSo, yeah.\n\n539\n00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.570\n>> Yeah, I think that was the smart thing\nthey did where they said, you know what?\n\n540\n00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:50.700\nThere are going to be those people out\nthere that typically are going to do video\n\n541\n00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.680\nediting, and not a lot of audio.\n\n542\n00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.420\nTo get into doing a bit of audio\nediting isn't that difficult.\n\n543\n00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.230\nIt's pretty intuitive,\nyou can figure it out really quickly,\n\n544\n00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.230\nand get something that sounds\nprofessional, and that's the point.\n\n545\n00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.800\n>> I can do enough until I bring in my\nfriend and say, okay, look, here, do this.\n\n546\n00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.230\n>> Yeah.\n>> And he sees the Premiere interface and\n\n547\n00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.980\nhe's like, yeah.\n\n548\n00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.800\n>> Yeah. Yeah. >> And\nhe sets it up the way he wants and\n\n549\n00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.170\nhe does it mixing board style.\n\n550\n00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.280\nI'm just sitting there going, okay.\n\n551\n00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.480\n>> And I need it off this.\n\n552\n00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.445\n>> I'm like, fine, yeah.\n\n553\n00:30:16.445 --> 00:30:17.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And he's fine.\n\n554\n00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.240\nSo yeah, that's getting more\nextensive with effects.\n\n555\n00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.520\n>> Yeah.\n>> And more extensive with some of\n\n556\n00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.020\nthe other things that you can do in there.\n\n557\n00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.560\nIt's cool, like I said, keep it subtle.\n\n558\n00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.700\nKeep it subtle.\n\n559\n00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.440\nYou do very subtle audio changes.\n\n560\n00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.830\nPeople will notice, but\nthey won't think it's been doctored.\n\n561\n00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.700\nAnd if you do way too much,\nthen people know, wow,\n\n562\n00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.670\nthey really put a lot of effort into that.\n\n563\n00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:40.447\n>> What are they hiding?\n\n564\n00:30:40.447 --> 00:30:42.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, what are they hiding?\n\n565\n00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:42.710\nYeah, that's great.\n\n566\n00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:43.640\nNo, that's really good.\n\n567\n00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.252\nSometimes when you doctor stuff too much.\n\n568\n00:30:45.252 --> 00:30:45.763\n>> That's right.\n\n569\n00:30:45.763 --> 00:30:47.510\n>> It's like, what did they do wrong?\n\n570\n00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.920\n>> Right.\n>> What did they do wrong?\n\n571\n00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.190\nWhat are they trying to hide from me?\n\n572\n00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.970\nSo yeah.\n\n573\n00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:51.780\n>> Well, very cool, Jim.\n\n574\n00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.500\nThank you so much for showing us how\nto work with the audio faith interface.\n\n575\n00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.120\nIt's not just a video editor,\nand you can work audio.\n\n576\n00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.080\nAnd not just in some low level fashion.\n\n577\n00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.190\nFull fledged audio capabilities\ninside of Premier.\n\n578\n00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.130\nPlay around with it,\nhave a lot of good times with it.\n\n579\n00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:11.480\nYou've shown us a lot of good stuff\nthat will definitely get us going.\n\n580\n00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.160\nEverything that you showed us is great.\n\n581\n00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.520\nIt's the standard type of things you\nneed to know about working with audio.\n\n582\n00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.240\nMake your clips look awesome.\n\n583\n00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.210\nThat's the whole point of\nthis endeavor right here.\n\n584\n00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.970\nThat being said, looks like we've\nrun out of time for this episode.\n\n585\n00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.760\n>> I know,\nit happens at least once every 30 minutes.\n\n586\n00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n587\n00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.162\n>> That, and when that happens,\n\n588\n00:31:30.162 --> 00:31:31.655\nwe got to say goodbye, Jim.\n\n589\n00:31:31.655 --> 00:31:33.835\nWe thank you for joining us today.\n\n590\n00:31:33.835 --> 00:31:35.145\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n591\n00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:36.595\nWe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n592\n00:31:36.595 --> 00:31:39.085\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n593\n00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:39.744\n>> I'm James Middle.\n\n594\n00:31:39.744 --> 00:31:42.037\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n595\n00:31:42.037 --> 00:31:49.380\n[SOUND]\n\n596\n00:31:55.132 --> 00:31:55.850\n>> Lookie lou.\n\n597\n00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:56.730\n>> Yeah.\n\n598\n00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.250\n>> Okay, let's get rid of that reverb.\n\n",

another great\nepisode Episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:18.869\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.440\nwe continue on with our\nAdobe Premiere Pro series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.540\nJoining us back in the studio again\nis our good friend Mr. Jim Biddle.\n\n7\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.250\nJim, what have you got in store for\nus today?\n\n8\n00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.250\n>> I'm dancing because I\nhave the title tool today.\n\n9\n00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.350\n>> You got a little boogie in it.\n\n10\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.700\n>> I do, I do.\n\n11\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.980\nMostly because the title tool is very,\nvery cool.\n\n12\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.300\nMost people think if I wanna\ndo some really cool titles,\n\n13\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.440\nI gotta get out into one\nof the other applications.\n\n14\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.445\nBelieve it or not, you can do so\nmuch with the title tool.\n\n15\n00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:45.455\nIf you just do a little bit of exploring.\n\n16\n00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:47.535\nOkay, so\nwhen we go back in the user interface.\n\n17\n00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:52.071\nAnd I'm gonna go back to the preferences\nreal quick and there was one for\n\n18\n00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:56.849\nthe titler, it's interesting it's\nthe title tool they call the titler.\n\n19\n00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.750\nHere's something interesting.\n\n20\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.040\nThey've added some new things\nthey've added some text engines.\n\n21\n00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.210\nThey've also if editing text in Middle\nEastern languages you know ligatures,\n\n22\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.470\nHindi Digits interesting.\n\n23\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.590\nDefault paragraph direction\ndepending what you are doing.\n\n24\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.100\nThe two classics are what's called\nStyle Swatches and Font Browser,\n\n25\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.110\nnow you see here Aa and then AaegZz.\n\n26\n00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.760\nWhat does this mean?\n\n27\n00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.600\nI will show you and then I'm gonna show\nyou why you might wanna change it.\n\n28\n00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.960\nSo I'm just gonna go Title, uh-oh,\nAdd Fonts from Typekit, what's that?\n\n29\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.790\nThis is a new creative cloud thing,\n\n30\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.888\nwhere you can have a Typekit of your own\nin the creative cloud, and then say, ooh,\n\n31\n00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:46.350\nI have a ton of fonts that are mine, that\nI keep with me all the time on the cloud.\n\n32\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.190\nI'm on a new terminal now, I'm going to\ngo ahead and add those from my Typekit.\n\n33\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.130\nThat's really cool, if you don't, it's\nlike, you guys don't have a font I like.\n\n34\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.500\nWell, if you keep it in your\nCreative Cloud account,\n\n35\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.090\nyou always have the font and\ntype faces that you love.\n\n36\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.300\nNew Title.\nNow, we have Default Still, Default roll,\n\n37\n00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.990\nso that's like rolling credits into\nthe movie or a TV show, or a crawl.\n\n38\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.260\nIf you wanna do a crawl along\nthe bottom for something.\n\n39\n00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.950\nMaybe you've been asked\nto make a commercial and\n\n40\n00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.560\nyou have to put some\ncrawl along the bottom.\n\n41\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.510\nYou can also do it based on the current\ntitle that you're using, or\n\n42\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.770\nbased on a template.\n\n43\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.688\nToday we're just gonna do a default still,\nboom, and\n\n44\n00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:27.110\nit's going to give me some options.\n\n45\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.630\nIt's gonna say New Title.\n\n46\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.100\nNow why does it say, it's got all\nthis stuff, why does it give me\n\n47\n00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.360\nthe option to do something other then 1280\nby 120, 28976, blah, blah, blah, blah?\n\n48\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.440\nMaybe you've started working on titles but\nyou don't have a sequence yet.\n\n49\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.870\nOkay you haven't actually created\na sequence yet, but you're like,\n\n50\n00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.960\nI can get all these titles\ndone ahead of time.\n\n51\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.684\nSo, it gives you options to say, wait\nthis 1920 by 1080 is gonna be this and\n\n52\n00:02:54.684 --> 00:02:56.054\nit's gonna be this time base.\n\n53\n00:02:56.054 --> 00:02:58.415\nAnd you can pre-build them before\nyou don't have to wait for\n\n54\n00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:01.620\nsomebody sitting there going, well,\nI really wish you'd get that done.\n\n55\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.980\nNo, I mean, you could do that.\n\n56\n00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.500\nI'm just gonna call this opener.\n\n57\n00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.860\nCall it opener, click okay.\n\n58\n00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.880\nNow, here is the tool itself.\n\n59\n00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.320\nThere is now some metadata.\n\n60\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.630\nA title in the actual project\nthat we're gonna take a look at.\n\n61\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.390\nBut let's start this thing left to right.\n\n62\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.060\nA lot of interesting options\nthat we can start with.\n\n63\n00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.180\nWe have a selection tool,\n\n64\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.750\na rotator, we can vertically type,\nwe can do an area type.\n\n65\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.950\nVertical area type, different path types,\n\n66\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.550\nall kinds of great things\nto experiment with.\n\n67\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.530\nNow this, these pen tools,\nyou might say, yes key frame in motion.\n\n68\n00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.690\nNope, no key framing of motion here,\nthis is one of the things you can't do,\n\n69\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.620\nyou can't move it.\n\n70\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.820\nYou would put it in a timeline and\nthen move it like you would move or\n\n71\n00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.739\nedit a clip, but\nyou don't do it in the title tool.\n\n72\n00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.710\nWe can create shapes.\n\n73\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.365\nOkay, look.\n\n74\n00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:08.500\nThere's an A and an a right there.\n\n75\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.900\nThere's a bunch of As.\n\n76\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.120\nThis is the thing that you can\nsee these are the style swatches.\n\n77\n00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.380\nAnd you can see it's based on\nthe letters capital A, lowercase a,\n\n78\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.020\nand it's like okay.\n\n79\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.140\nSo I can choose this particular style and\nwork with that style.\n\n80\n00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.880\nIf I come over here,\nthe title is opener now.\n\n81\n00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.890\nPlease notice this now,\nshow background video.\n\n82\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.420\nDon't show it.\n\n83\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.786\nSometimes it upsets people.\n\n84\n00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:41.620\nI don't want to see that, or, instead\nof having to go back into the timeline\n\n85\n00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.760\nto find where this title is,\nI can adjust in here.\n\n86\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.420\nIt's like,\nthis title needs to come at five seconds.\n\n87\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.940\nI can do that.\nAnd,\n\n88\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.200\nthat's what it would look\nlike on five seconds.\n\n89\n00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.470\nAll right, I'll just do it there for\nnow but you don't have to jump back in.\n\n90\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.190\nSo let's go to our title properties,\ntransform, distort,\n\n91\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.612\nfill, all these will become\napparent as I create a title.\n\n92\n00:05:06.612 --> 00:05:10.055\nSo I'm just gonna do this very\nbasic like most people do.\n\n93\n00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:14.545\nJust get my type tool,\nclick and now, up at the top,\n\n94\n00:05:14.545 --> 00:05:18.935\nit starts giving me options for\nmy type faces and fonts.\n\n95\n00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:23.215\nIf I click on this, notice, AaegZz.\n\n96\n00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:26.595\nThat was in the title and to say, okay,\n\n97\n00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:32.019\nthis is what this font is going to look\nlike using those particular letters.\n\n98\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.260\nIf I go back into the preferences and\nsay, hey, you know what?\n\n99\n00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.080\nWhat is the thing I most commonly use?\n\n100\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.430\nMaybe around here it's IT Pro.\n\n101\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.680\nI'll make it go IT Pro so\n\n102\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.460\nthat way I know what IT Pro looks\nlike in that particular typeface.\n\n103\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.260\n>> That's pretty slick.\n\n104\n00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.020\n>> And it's pretty slick.\n\n105\n00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.030\nSo instead of having to go in, I know\na lot of people do this, they type in,\n\n106\n00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.120\nit's like that looks wrong.\n\n107\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.700\nNo, I'll do it this way.\n\n108\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.350\nThey say I can do it here.\n\n109\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.840\nAnd it's very, very cool.\n\n110\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.820\nSo let me figure out what I wanna do.\n\n111\n00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.150\nLet's go up.\n\n112\n00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.920\nThere's a lot of typeface in here.\n\n113\n00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.900\nThere's a lot.\n\n114\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.110\nLets go to one that nobody\never uses called Helvetica.\n\n115\n00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.200\nKidding.\n\n116\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.760\nAll right, and then I'm just gonna\ntype in garden no that's Geneva.\n\n117\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.200\nWe got to get out of that first.\n\n118\n00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.330\nThat'd be smart.\n\n119\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.400\n>> At least it was close.\n\n120\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.820\n>> It was close, all right.\n\n121\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.600\nBoom, come down here, GARDEN.\n\n122\n00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.020\nOops, that changed, I'm a silly person.\n\n123\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.900\nLet me highlight this.\n\n124\n00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.075\nClick, go across, boom,\n\n125\n00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:41.639\ngo back up again, come on, play nice.\n\n126\n00:06:43.783 --> 00:06:48.623\nI could have just hit H, started from\nthere, nope, I have to be clever and\n\n127\n00:06:48.623 --> 00:06:49.870\ndo this.\n\n128\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.920\nHelvetica, boom, there we go,\ngarden, watch this.\n\n129\n00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.727\nLet's make it bold, or,\nboom, I could do this.\n\n130\n00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.940\nHighlight just GAR.\n\n131\n00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.618\nThat's in bold.\n\n132\n00:07:02.618 --> 00:07:05.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know why.\n\n133\n00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.260\nSomebody liked it.\n\n134\n00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.070\nI can make it italic.\n\n135\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.500\nI can underline it,\na lot of things you've seen before, size.\n\n136\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.670\nLet's just make that bigger already.\n\n137\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.630\nStill got GAR.\n\n138\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.380\nThat's cool.\n\n139\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.300\nI think I will do that.\n\n140\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.904\nWhy?\nCuz I'm gonna show you something else\n\n141\n00:07:19.904 --> 00:07:20.800\nyou can do in this.\n\n142\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.280\nRight now it's justified left,\nI can center it, all that.\n\n143\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.340\nIf I were doing a text box.\n\n144\n00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.350\nIf I defined it as saying okay this box,\nit's a text box and\n\n145\n00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.810\nthis box is from here to here.\n\n146\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.460\nI could do those things where I\nsay okay it needs to be centered,\n\n147\n00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.060\nit needs to be this, it needs to be that.\n\n148\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.990\nI can't see it, because it's white.\n\n149\n00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.640\nAnd I'm wearing white.\n\n150\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:51.330\nSo if I come over here to the right,\nnotice I have transform properties.\n\n151\n00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.064\nThey are blue, but there's no key frame.\n\n152\n00:07:54.064 --> 00:07:57.838\nOkay, there's no key framing,\nso I can do the opacity.\n\n153\n00:07:57.838 --> 00:07:59.443\nI can take it down.\n\n154\n00:07:59.443 --> 00:08:00.960\nI can do my x position.\n\n155\n00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.865\nI can do my y position.\n\n156\n00:08:03.865 --> 00:08:05.711\nI do my width,\nhere's something interesting.\n\n157\n00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:09.480\nI can do width and I can do height.\n\n158\n00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.470\nSo now, I've given that a bit more of\na different characteristic by doing that.\n\n159\n00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.000\nIt's like it's hard to see there, okay.\n\n160\n00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.810\nWidth and height.\n\n161\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:25.350\nIf you're not used to these before, this\nis called the title and action safe area.\n\n162\n00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.950\nThat's what these bars are.\n\n163\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.610\nDepending on the type of\nscreen that you are going to.\n\n164\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.620\nIt is recommended that you keep\nyour titles within the inner\n\n165\n00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.860\nbox to make sure it doesn't get clipped,\nokay.\n\n166\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.390\nScreen size has changed,\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n167\n00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.160\nIn the aspects, in the pixels,\nin all of this, it will change.\n\n168\n00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.040\nSo, that's why they say\nthis is a title safe.\n\n169\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.950\nYou put your titles within there,\nyou are generally safe.\n\n170\n00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:50.952\nProperties.\n\n171\n00:08:50.952 --> 00:08:53.540\nLook, I can change the font family now,\nif I wanted to.\n\n172\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.160\nHerculean, so I can do it over\nhere if I wanted to, that's nice.\n\n173\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.450\nI wanted that,\nmaybe I wanted that helvetica neue,\n\n174\n00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.610\nI don't know how to say that.\n\n175\n00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:09.440\nFont style, ultralight,\nI have all these options now, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.830\nBold, bold italic, condensed black,\nlight, light italic, regular, thin.\n\n177\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.810\nI have so many more choices.\n\n178\n00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.050\nLet me do condensed black.\n\n179\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.000\nBoom, lovely.\n\n180\n00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.650\nIt's still white.\n\n181\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.350\nLet's condense black.\n\n182\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.090\nAspect, tracking.\n\n183\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.850\nI'm going to do a baseline shift.\n\n184\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:31.190\nI'm going to take the tool here and\nI'm going to highlight den.\n\n185\n00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.800\nWhat is a baseline shift?\n\n186\n00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.130\nI show this to people a lot if\nthey do like fourth and fifth and\n\n187\n00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.480\nall that and the five is here but\nthey want the T-H to come up.\n\n188\n00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.760\nLet's baseline shift that.\n\n189\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.270\nBaseline shift that up right about there,\nso it's gar-den.\n\n190\n00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.690\n>> I like that.\n\n191\n00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.450\n>> That is lovely, so\nthat's a baseline shift and\n\n192\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:57.020\nit really, you can really dig\ninto this and have a good time.\n\n193\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:57.910\nAlso, let's say, you know what?\n\n194\n00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.640\nLet's slant that a little bit.\n\n195\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.170\nPut a little motion on there.\n\n196\n00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.590\nOkay, that's nice, just slight.\n\n197\n00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.370\nYou also have leading and kerning,\n\n198\n00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.380\nif the space between the letters is too\nclose, and you want to even it out.\n\n199\n00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.650\nSo a lot of this thing that people send\nto another application, it's like,\n\n200\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.290\nI've got to use leading.\n\n201\n00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.030\nI've got to use kerning, you can do\nit right here in the title tool and\n\n202\n00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.460\nit's really cool.\n\n203\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.620\nAll right,\nhere's where it gets really fun.\n\n204\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.980\nWe have this thing called a fill type.\n\n205\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.110\nI have a solid let's fill that with red,\nbecause that's,\n\n206\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.230\nthat's a good graphic choice.\n\n207\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.670\nNo not really.\n\n208\n00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.220\nLet's go with a blue.\n\n209\n00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.180\nClick OK.\n\n210\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.900\nGARDEN, or actually, come on,\nit's GARDEN, it's green.\n\n211\n00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.820\nGreen, I'm emphasizing a green garden,\nGARDEN, boom.\n\n212\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:50.270\nWe can make it a little more interesting.\n\n213\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:56.129\nI can say let me use a linear gradient and\nthis linear gradient has two sides.\n\n214\n00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:00.805\nDouble-click this side and say what's\nanother good color for a garden?\n\n215\n00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:02.656\nA nice blue sky.\n\n216\n00:11:02.656 --> 00:11:08.731\nClick that, Okay and now,\nI have a gradient on this and\n\n217\n00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:13.335\nI can say, okay,\nlet's pull the green back a little bit.\n\n218\n00:11:13.335 --> 00:11:19.780\nPull the blue up, pull the blue over and I\ncan change how the gradient goes on that.\n\n219\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.610\nIt's really fun.\n\n220\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.130\nIt's like, I can really make a lot\nin this, and you're like, wow!\n\n221\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:32.980\nAnd you have your stop color and you have\nyour opacity on the stop color, okay.\n\n222\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.260\nSo I can add a little.\n\n223\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.760\nI can take the opacity\ndown just a little bit.\n\n224\n00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:44.840\nI have this thing called repeating, so\nif I repeat it, I can make lines, okay.\n\n225\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.610\nLet me zoom in here real quick.\n\n226\n00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.750\nOkay, there it is and I will move it over,\nso we can see it a little better.\n\n227\n00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.679\nBut notice by repeating,\nit added these lines in there.\n\n228\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.630\nOkay, boom.\nAnd I've done things like, yeah,\n\n229\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:04.780\nI've made this white, and I've made this\nred, and it looks like a sparkle mint.\n\n230\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've done that.\n\n231\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.820\nPeople like it.\n\n232\n00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.350\nI can not repeat, and\nit's just one over the other.\n\n233\n00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.095\nThat's just fine.\n\n234\n00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:15.238\nI can add some sheen.\n\n235\n00:12:15.238 --> 00:12:20.119\nI can add some texture and\nthere's all kinds of inner strokes,\n\n236\n00:12:20.119 --> 00:12:24.090\nouter strokes, and\nyes of course, a drop shadow.\n\n237\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:29.470\nWith the whole thing, give me a full,\nchange the angle a little bit.\n\n238\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:35.340\nBecause depending on how\nthe light is coming in the actual\n\n239\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.080\nshot, you might,\nif the light is coming from one direction.\n\n240\n00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.900\nAnd then,\nyour drop shadow is going in the other.\n\n241\n00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.350\nThat's not going to look so good.\n\n242\n00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.530\nAdd a little distance on it, and then,\nI can take the opacity down a little bit.\n\n243\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:52.130\nThe thing is, I am in what people\ncall this simple title tool and\n\n244\n00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.850\nI am adding a lot a,\nlot of detail to this.\n\n245\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:01.030\nAnd that's the fun part is,\nthat I can add a lot of detail in here.\n\n246\n00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.890\nAll I have to do now is click out and\nlike, I've lost everything.\n\n247\n00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.910\nNo, it's right here.\n\n248\n00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.380\nIt's right here.\n\n249\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.170\nThis is what frustrates people.\n\n250\n00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.232\nIt's like, okay,\nI'm ready to edit this now.\n\n251\n00:13:12.232 --> 00:13:15.800\nAnd they'll,\nwell they won't double-click the Ben but\n\n252\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.840\nthey'll double click the title and\nit opens back up in the title tool.\n\n253\n00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.570\nAnd you're like man, so I could do\nthat thing, that really cool thing,\n\n254\n00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:29.830\nwhere I say, control click and\nsay open in source monitor.\n\n255\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.730\nBut now,\nthat we're doing really cool things.\n\n256\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.140\nOkay, now that we're advanced,\n\n257\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.360\nif I hold down commandand double-click it,\nit will go in the source bar.\n\n258\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.750\nIt's like no,\nI command you go to into the source bar.\n\n259\n00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.599\nI have to use these mnemonics, or I-\n>> Yes, exactly right.\n\n260\n00:13:47.599 --> 00:13:49.418\n>> So, here's what I'm gonna do.\n\n261\n00:13:49.418 --> 00:13:52.170\nI'll go back to the beginning,\ndrop an end point.\n\n262\n00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.340\nThe other thing was like, plus.\n\n263\n00:13:54.340 --> 00:14:00.890\nOkay, highlight the numbers,\nshift plus three, period.\n\n264\n00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:05.580\nBoom, should go by three seconds,\nhit the out point and now,\n\n265\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.420\nI have a three second version of this.\n\n266\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.550\nAnd I'm just going to do a simple edit.\n\n267\n00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.220\nVideo one is in Video one.\n\n268\n00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.270\nIt's exactly where I want it.\n\n269\n00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.370\nI want it just above and\n\n270\n00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.640\nI'm going to do an insert, boom and\nit's going to pop it right at the front.\n\n271\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:21.700\nGarden.\n\n272\n00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.690\nNow, I might say yeah, that's cool.\n\n273\n00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:32.220\nIt's over black, which is dumb, so\nthat I will overwrite it instead.\n\n274\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.520\nMy overwrite's missing unless I\ncome here to my over flow and\n\n275\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.260\ndo over write, that's better.\n\n276\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:43.080\n>> Hi I'm Jim Milligan,\nI'm currently training you right now on.\n\n277\n00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.270\n>> And I'll say, great, that could use\nsome fades or some cross dissolves.\n\n278\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.800\nLet me go to my effects, okay?\n\n279\n00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:59.520\nAnd I'm just going to double check what,\nyep, cross dissolve is my default.\n\n280\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.770\nIt's got it on there.\n\n281\n00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.650\nI'll just highlight it.\n\n282\n00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.960\nSequence, apply video transition.\n\n283\n00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.060\nIt's going to do it to both sides, because\nI highlighted the entire title, okay.\n\n284\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.760\nBecause I highlighted the entire title and\nthen applied default.\n\n285\n00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.025\nIt put it on both sides for me.\n\n286\n00:15:15.025 --> 00:15:19.070\nThen the default length 30 frames.\n\n287\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.950\nBoom, I got a little title on there!\n\n288\n00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:25.950\nIt's really easy and then I'll say,\nwhat if I want to put an ending title?\n\n289\n00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.460\nYou know, just a little still out.\n\n290\n00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.015\nDo I have to duplicate it?\n\n291\n00:15:34.015 --> 00:15:35.025\nDo I have to recreate it?\n\n292\n00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:37.655\nWe were doing drags before.\n\n293\n00:15:38.895 --> 00:15:41.865\nRemember, we were doing the thing where\nit's like, command drag, do this, do that.\n\n294\n00:15:42.915 --> 00:15:47.530\nIf I hold down the option key,\nokay, let me scooch this over here.\n\n295\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:52.646\nIf I hold down the option key and then,\ndrag it's going to make an immediate copy.\n\n296\n00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.334\nIt's going to make an immediate copy,\nit even copies the fades.\n\n297\n00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:00.420\n>> All the properties?\n\n298\n00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.681\n>> It's great, right.\nAnd it's now separate.\n\n299\n00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:04.644\nIt is now separate.\n\n300\n00:16:04.644 --> 00:16:09.100\nWhat most people think is,\nwait, it says, Copy 01.\n\n301\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.306\nBut I'm gonna click on that and\ncall it Closer, okay and\n\n302\n00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:19.140\nmost people say, wait, if it makes a copy,\ncuz this used to happen.\n\n303\n00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.460\nThey'll say, but I made a copy of that\ntitle and I changed that title and\n\n304\n00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.840\nit changed the first one.\n\n305\n00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.090\nDoesn't do that anymore.\n\n306\n00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.260\nNow if Option, hold down Option,\ndrag it, it's a clean copy.\n\n307\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.460\nAnd I'll just double-click it.\n\n308\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.217\nIt opens it back up in the Title tool,\nand I will say,\n\n309\n00:16:40.672 --> 00:16:43.221\nThanks, like that.\n\n310\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:49.190\nSave it and now at the end it says,\nthanks with a little fade and fade out.\n\n311\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.460\nBoom.\n\n312\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.150\nDone.\n\n313\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.760\nSo that option drag is pretty killer.\n\n314\n00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.790\n>> That's nice.\n\n315\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.290\n>> All right.\n\n316\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:03.350\nNow I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show\nyou, I mean let's face it once you\n\n317\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:08.340\ndo that, doing something like a rolling\ncredit and a crawl fairly easy.\n\n318\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.345\nYou're coming in,\nyou keep typing, you keep typing,\n\n319\n00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:12.620\nyou put it in the timeline and\nyou [CROSSTALK] it's really easy.\n\n320\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.890\nLet me show you something\nelse that this is useful for.\n\n321\n00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.860\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nget rid of this title at the front.\n\n322\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:24.450\nLet's say I would like to, and\nas we get into the next lesson I would\n\n323\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:29.771\nlike to just put almost something\nthat looks like a spot light on me.\n\n324\n00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:30.390\n>> Okay.\n\n325\n00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.708\n>> It's like okay, how do I do that?\n\n326\n00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:38.331\nIt's like all right, first time I wanna do\nis come down here I'm gonna Go ahead and\n\n327\n00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:39.281\npull this fade.\n\n328\n00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:45.620\nWe're gonna pull that, I'll read you this\nby doing something else in a minute.\n\n329\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.175\nI'm just gonna option drag up and\nmake a copy of me, okay.\n\n330\n00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:55.095\nSo I have, if I take this eyeball off and\non, okay, zoom in.\n\n331\n00:17:55.095 --> 00:17:56.265\nTake that eyeball off and\n\n332\n00:17:56.265 --> 00:18:01.475\non, I still see me because there's\na direct copy of me on the top.\n\n333\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.510\nI'm going to go to the title tool.\n\n334\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.460\nNew Title Default Still and\nin this case I'm going to say\n\n335\n00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:17.816\nrelight one Mask, okay?\n\n336\n00:18:17.816 --> 00:18:19.800\nBoom.\n\n337\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.150\nIt's the old way we used to do mask, and\nyou can still do and it's very effective.\n\n338\n00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.530\nYes, you have the mask tool now, and\nmany of the effects we do, a circle or\n\n339\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.840\nsquare or draw your own,\nhere's the kind of the older method.\n\n340\n00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.790\nAnd it still works, and\nit's still a lot of fun.\n\n341\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:40.790\nI'm going to take the wedge tool,\nand just make a wedge, okay.\n\n342\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.280\nMake a wedge.\n\n343\n00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.870\nLight's coming from that direction so\nyeah.\n\n344\n00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.680\nAnd I'm just gonna kind of put it up and\n\n345\n00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.610\nthen stretch it out Like this and\nsay okay.\n\n346\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.800\nThis is it.\n\n347\n00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.950\nI'm not gonna futz around\ntoo much with this today.\n\n348\n00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.100\nBoom.\nAnd, here's the relight mask one.\n\n349\n00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.700\nCommand click, I load it in there.\n\n350\n00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.760\nI'm gonna move video one to video three.\n\n351\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.280\nAnd I'm going to use a new thing.\n\n352\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.340\nI'm going to shift Click on the audio,\nget rid of that get rid of video one.\n\n353\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.670\nVideo two is highlighted in here and I'm\ngoing to use what I call the pirate key.\n\n354\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.800\n>> The pirate key?\n\n355\n00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.040\n>> It's like there are pirates?\n\n356\n00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.080\nYeah there are pirates.\n\n357\n00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.818\nBecause video two is selected on the right\nside if I hit x that marks the clip.\n\n358\n00:19:34.283 --> 00:19:36.790\nIf I option x, it's gone.\n\n359\n00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.544\nBut even if I put the play head here,\nwhat it's going to see is, okay,\n\n360\n00:19:39.544 --> 00:19:41.815\nI see this clip,\nit goes from there to there in video two.\n\n361\n00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:43.860\nIf I hit x, that marks the clip.\n\n362\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.130\nSo I have my immediate end point and\nout point on there.\n\n363\n00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.990\nAnd then I can just say, all right,\nlet me overwrite that in.\n\n364\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.600\nOverride because of the overflow\nit's gonna say hey buddy and\n\n365\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.680\nI'm gonna remove this yeah all\nright I've got four points.\n\n366\n00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.900\nBecause it puts two points on me,\npoints automatically for the title and\n\n367\n00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:09.550\nI say okay ignore the source\nout doom that is okay.\n\n368\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.410\nSo now at the top I've got this right okay\n\n369\n00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.980\nunfortunately that key frame pops but\nhey we're still gonna have fun with it.\n\n370\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:24.430\nGonna go into my effects,\nand I'm gonna get two.\n\n371\n00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.850\nThe first one is a Gaussian blur and\n\n372\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.400\npeople are saying do you use\nanything else but the Gaussian blur?\n\n373\n00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.790\nMy answer to you is no.\n\n374\n00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.230\n>> Shouldn't they just create one big\nprogram called the Gaussian blur?\n\n375\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.520\n>> They should, they should and\nit's all I use.\n\n376\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.600\nSo I'll do that.\n\n377\n00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.310\nHighlight the effects controls and\njust kick that up.\n\n378\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.660\nNice and soft.\n\n379\n00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.150\nNice, soft Gaussian blur on there.\n\n380\n00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.180\n>> Very pretty.\n\n381\n00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.770\n>> Now, gonna come back to effects and\n\n382\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:58.220\ntype in the word track matte,\nor just track, and\n\n383\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.960\nI get this thing called a track\n>> Matte key.\n\n384\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.190\nI am going to put this on\nthe copy of me in the center.\n\n385\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.960\nSo, this requires three things.\n\n386\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.270\nOne, two, three.\n\n387\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.393\nThe first one of me, the copy.\n\n388\n00:21:16.393 --> 00:21:20.470\nThe copy i mad by just holding down\n>> Option dragging straight up and\n\n389\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.640\nthen this shape which I\nput a Gaussian blur on.\n\n390\n00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.180\nTake the track matte key and\nput it on the one in the center.\n\n391\n00:21:29.603 --> 00:21:33.536\nIn the parameters,\ncuz I had the effects controls up and\n\n392\n00:21:33.536 --> 00:21:35.806\nit says now where's the matte?\n\n393\n00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.330\nIt's gonna say None, Titles.\n\n394\n00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.360\nThe matte is in Titles.\n\n395\n00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.740\nWhy does it say Titles?\n\n396\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.550\nbecause that is what I renamed video 3.\n\n397\n00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.231\nI renamed it.\n\n398\n00:21:48.231 --> 00:21:51.220\nIf I come down there and\nopen it back up, it'll say Titles.\n\n399\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.430\nBoom.\n\n400\n00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.660\nAnd now you're like, wow.\n\n401\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.520\n>> Completely removed the effect at all.\n\n402\n00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.450\n>> Let me show you,\nthat didn't do anything.\n\n403\n00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:07.250\nWell if I turn of the bottom,\nthat showing me the track match.\n\n404\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.170\nBasically what it's done is it\nsay okay it replaced the white\n\n405\n00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.570\nwith the image that's in here.\n\n406\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.850\nThat's like okay that's That works.\n\n407\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.630\nWhat do I do with the thing on the bottom?\n\n408\n00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.165\nThe thing I do on the bottom is I\nhighlight that take it to effects\n\n409\n00:22:24.165 --> 00:22:26.984\ncontrols, go to the opacity and\nbring that down.\n\n410\n00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:36.433\nSo now, technically I have\na little shaft of light on me.\n\n411\n00:22:39.114 --> 00:22:40.900\nOkay, I can make it much more extensive.\n\n412\n00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.930\nI turn the effect off and on, you can see.\n\n413\n00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.950\nWe also say this is a way\nyou can create a vignette.\n\n414\n00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.380\nSome people like to create\ntheir vignettes this way.\n\n415\n00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.180\nSome people like to use the new, you know,\nthe effect already has that, look,\n\n416\n00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.690\nthe opacity already has that on there.\n\n417\n00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.870\nWhy wouldn't I use that?\n\n418\n00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.130\nYou can.\n\n419\n00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.610\nBut there's other neat tricks\nthat you can do with this too,\n\n420\n00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.990\nespecially in the title tool.\n\n421\n00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.940\nImagine, and this is an elaborate one, and\n\n422\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.000\nmaybe we'll make a little\nside video on this someday.\n\n423\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.470\nWhere what you can do is, imagine if\nyou just outlined the title in white,\n\n424\n00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:19.190\nuse the track Mac key, and you can have\na little sparkle go through that instead,\n\n425\n00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.080\nlike a little shimmer, and\nit just goes through the outline.\n\n426\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.860\nSo there's so\nmany things you could do with this.\n\n427\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.270\nNow how am I gonna, I had a fade on this.\n\n428\n00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.590\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\n429\n00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.400\nThis is where, okay, I've got three items.\n\n430\n00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:38.783\nIf I highlight Highlight them.\n\n431\n00:23:38.783 --> 00:23:43.218\nI'm an Adobe user cuz I\nalways go to the wrong one.\n\n432\n00:23:43.218 --> 00:23:46.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Clip, nest.\n\n433\n00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.653\nSo, now I nest all of them together.\n\n434\n00:23:48.653 --> 00:23:55.768\nNested sequence, and\nI'm gonna say, relight nest, boom.\n\n435\n00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:58.485\nMove my play head there.\n\n436\n00:23:58.485 --> 00:24:01.950\nSequence, can I apply a video transitions?\n\n437\n00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.866\nI should be able to.\n\n438\n00:24:03.866 --> 00:24:06.030\nVideo transitions are cool.\n\n439\n00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:06.610\nYou know why?\n\n440\n00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.420\nAnybody know why out there?\n\n441\n00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.080\nSomebody's going because you don't\nhave video one highlighted, dummy.\n\n442\n00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:13.670\nExactly.\n\n443\n00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.870\nIt has to look down and see blue.\n\n444\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.360\nExactly.\n\n445\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.090\nIt didn't see any blue.\n\n446\n00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.700\nOnly saw in video two, boom, done.\n\n447\n00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.630\nThere's my cross dissolve.\n\n448\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.380\nBoom, there's my cross dissolve,\nit's right back in,\n\n449\n00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.550\nit's happy, everything is great.\n\n450\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.230\nAnd I did that by nesting.\n\n451\n00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.510\nIt's easier to put,\nif I need to put one thing on there,\n\n452\n00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.820\nlet me nest them all down into one thing.\n\n453\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.975\n>> That way you have so much to look at.\n\n454\n00:24:39.975 --> 00:24:40.861\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n455\n00:24:40.861 --> 00:24:42.724\n>> I have to put it in all three.\n\n456\n00:24:42.724 --> 00:24:45.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nah, boom, done.\n\n457\n00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.310\nSo, yeah, the title tool is very,\nvery extensive with what it does.\n\n458\n00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.900\nAnd like I said, let me just real quick,\nI bet I can do it very quickly.\n\n459\n00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.386\nLet's say I decide to put\nsome rolling credits on here.\n\n460\n00:24:57.386 --> 00:24:59.750\nTitle, New Title.\n\n461\n00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.910\nWe're going to do a roll,\nI was going to say roller, really easy.\n\n462\n00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:07.396\nAll right, and I'm just going to go.\n\n463\n00:25:10.812 --> 00:25:11.628\nThanks.\n\n464\n00:25:11.628 --> 00:25:14.674\nBoom, pick it up,\nI can pick it up with that, or\n\n465\n00:25:14.674 --> 00:25:18.350\nI can say okay,\nhere's the x position over there.\n\n466\n00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.670\nChange that color to red.\n\n467\n00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.170\nLet's make it red,\nbecause that's just obnoxious, okay?\n\n468\n00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.680\nAnd we'll just do red.\n\n469\n00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.120\nBoom, go back to my project.\n\n470\n00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.750\nWindow from the overflow.\n\n471\n00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.040\nOkay.\nThere's the roller.\n\n472\n00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.670\nI'm going to command click it.\n\n473\n00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:37.170\nDoot.\n\n474\n00:25:40.426 --> 00:25:41.280\nIt'll roll.\n\n475\n00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.660\nI have to create an animation for\nit to let it roll.\n\n476\n00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.630\nI didn't do that, but\nthen once I put it in here in video two,\n\n477\n00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.400\nvideo two doesn't have to be highlighted.\n\n478\n00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.640\nJust let me show you.\n\n479\n00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.600\nBoom, boom.\n\n480\n00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.100\nOverwrite.\n\n481\n00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.580\nThinks it's not rolling because I\ndidn't tell it to roll, but I can.\n\n482\n00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.630\nI can tell it to roll.\n\n483\n00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:01.130\nIt's great.\n\n484\n00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.570\nReally cool.\n>> This is how we create that\n\n485\n00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.690\nStar Wars effect.\n\n486\n00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.200\n>> Yeah, do the Star Wars effect.\n\n487\n00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.610\nYeah, that's actually pretty easy.\n\n488\n00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:12.700\nWhat most people don't know is all you\nhave to do is go in and then slant inward.\n\n489\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.960\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, we can do it.\n\n490\n00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.360\nSo yeah, rolling titles, everything\nthat you want to know, boom, in there.\n\n491\n00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.060\n>> That's a pretty simple tool,\nI like that.\n\n492\n00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.190\nI like simple tools.\n\n493\n00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:25.490\nI can't tell you how many different\nsoftwares I've used, and you get into it,\n\n494\n00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.470\nand you're like, what does this do?\n\n495\n00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.050\nHow do I make that work?\n\n496\n00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.070\nAnd it's just overly complex.\n\n497\n00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.330\nPremiere has a lot of complexity to it,\nbut they make it simple to use.\n\n498\n00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.830\nThey make it simple,\nI see what's going on here, and\n\n499\n00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.070\nthat's pretty easy to figure out.\n\n500\n00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.910\nAnd title tool is no exception,\nthat's for sure.\n\n501\n00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:40.720\n>> Nope.\n\n502\n00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.970\nNope.\nNot at all.\n\n503\n00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.120\nIt's really fun.\n\n504\n00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.480\nGet in there,\nplay around with it, enjoy it.\n\n505\n00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.200\nAnd just say hey,\nthis is going to be great.\n\n506\n00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.780\nAnd you can experiment with it too.\n\n507\n00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.220\nEverybody thinks they have to\ngo to another application.\n\n508\n00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.730\nThe other applications are great,\nbut like I said,\n\n509\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.690\nyou really get into that title tool,\nand you're going to have a lot of fun.\n\n510\n00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.320\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n511\n00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.290\nWell, Jim.\n\n512\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:00.720\nVery cool things you've shown us today.\n\n513\n00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.680\nWe appreciate that.\n\n514\n00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.040\nNow that we have a product,\nwe can actually add some text to them, and\n\n515\n00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.340\ncredits will probably be nice for the\npeople that help you work on this thing.\n\n516\n00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.310\nThey like their name in some form or\n\n517\n00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.240\nfashion attached to your project for\nhelping you.\n\n518\n00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.430\nSo, now we can do that.\n\n519\n00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.540\nWe appreciate it.\n\n520\n00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.030\nWe appreciate you guys too, but\n\n521\n00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.935\nlooks like we've come to the end\nof another great episode.\n\n522\n00:27:19.935 --> 00:27:21.610\n>> [SOUND]\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n523\n00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.360\nThere will be more, though.\n\n524\n00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.220\nThere will be more.\n\n525\n00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.720\nThat being said, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n526\n00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.680\n>> I've been James Piddle.\n\n527\n00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.868\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n528\n00:27:31.868 --> 00:27:39.390\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

great\nepisode Of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.560\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.270\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nwith our Premiere Pro series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.890\nJoining us back today is our good friend,\nour mentor,\n\n7\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.100\nour guiding star, Mr Jim Biddle.\n\n8\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.040\nJim, welcome back, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.980\nWe're so glad to have you.\n\n10\n00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.690\n>> Welcome to the adventure, everyone.\n\n11\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.790\n>> Woah there, cowboy.\n\n12\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.110\n>> Like that, okay?\n\n13\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.320\nLet's slow it down.\n\n14\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.580\nAll right, today, Color Correction.\n\n15\n00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.510\nColor correction is great,\ncause we you know, we can mess with color,\n\n16\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.405\nwe can change the looks of everything.\n\n17\n00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:45.960\nBut like audio, put your hands on\nit too much, and it's going to be\n\n18\n00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.500\nfairly obvious that you've done it,\nso we want to keep it subtle.\n\n19\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.950\nCouple things I wanna address in\nthe user interface real quick.\n\n20\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.320\nThere are a couple of things that\nare gonna be very important for\n\n21\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.860\ncolor correction stepping back\ninto some things I've done before.\n\n22\n00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.680\nYou remember I made a nest.\n\n23\n00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.510\nRemember I did this whole relight, and\nI made a nest, and you say that's cool.\n\n24\n00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.370\nYou put like three things in there,\nand you made that track map.\n\n25\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.530\nIf I double click it, I go into the mask,\n\n26\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.540\nand you might say now why\nwould I want to do that?\n\n27\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.360\nLet's say all of a sudden I've\nbeen looking at this, and\n\n28\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.370\nI say you know what, that shape that I\nused there, I don't like that shape.\n\n29\n00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.670\nHow do I replace the shape?\n\n30\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.000\nIt's very easy.\n\n31\n00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.740\nWhat I'm going to do is go in here,\nhighlight the shape,\n\n32\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.700\nhighlight the shape of the top.\n\n33\n00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.850\nIf I go into the in bin,\nI have a new shape.\n\n34\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160\nWith that highlighted I\ncan say hey you know what\n\n35\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.834\nI have something that we've used before,\ncontrol-click.\n\n36\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.335\nAnd [NOISE] replacement clip and\nnow I have one that says from the bin.\n\n37\n00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:48.370\nSo whatever a highlight is in the bin,\nyeah boom.\n\n38\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.330\nNow, I have a new shape it's on there,\nand it maintained everything.\n\n39\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.860\nThat was on the effects controls, okay?\n\n40\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.040\nThe Gaussian blur,\nall those are on the new shape.\n\n41\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.570\nThose didn't get wiped out,\nI just replaced what was in there, and\n\n42\n00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.070\nit has a new shape.\n\n43\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.300\nThe other thing is, we're gonna\ndo sort of this nesting isolation\n\n44\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.030\nwith color correction, but I did that\nrolling title, and it didn't roll.\n\n45\n00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.910\nThat's occasionally you make them so\nfast, you skip something you need.\n\n46\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.170\nSo let me go back to that rolling title.\n\n47\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.290\nOkay?\nIt's really easy.\n\n48\n00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.120\nI'm gonna come back, command click it,\nand load it up here.\n\n49\n00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.990\nAnd like it doesn't roll buddy.\n\n50\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.193\nWell, that's because I skipped a step.\n\n51\n00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:30.979\nAll right.\n\n52\n00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:31.838\n>> It's good reason why it's not rolling.\n\n53\n00:02:31.838 --> 00:02:33.242\n>> I know, it's great reason.\n\n54\n00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:35.859\nI'm gonna come back into\nmy timeline real quick.\n\n55\n00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.679\n>> I'm gonna guess there's\na button that says roll.\n\n56\n00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.360\n>> You're so very close.\n\n57\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.870\nMark that within that end point.\n\n58\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.650\nI'm gonna double-click the new shape,\nall right, not the new shape.\n\n59\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.490\nThat's be silly to make that roll.\n\n60\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.480\nBut I'm gonna double click the opener,\nand we, no, wrong one.\n\n61\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.610\nI keep hitting the wrong one,\nwhy do we keep to it?\n\n62\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.840\nHow about the one that says roller?\n\n63\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.040\nThat's good.\nNow, I can either come to title,\n\n64\n00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.110\nonce I'm on the title tool, I have a lot\nmore options in title than I had before,\n\n65\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.300\none including Roll/Crawl Options,\nwhich is also available right here.\n\n66\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.000\nAnd this is what I forgot to do,\n\n67\n00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.440\nI cannot say yeah start it off screen and\nend it off screen please.\n\n68\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.050\nAnd that's all I have to do to this title,\nand now it's changed.\n\n69\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.350\nThen it comes in here and it rolls.\n\n70\n00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.170\nIt has four points.\n\n71\n00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.580\nIf I go to the out point here,\n\n72\n00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.350\nit's almost like six minutes, and\nI don't need that much time down here.\n\n73\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.600\nSo if I do that 4 point edit thing,\nwrong one.\n\n74\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.930\nDo the overflow.\n\n75\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.360\nIf I do the overwrite from the over flow,\nthat's where I can say\n\n76\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.926\nlet's fit it to fill and\nhave it go faster.\n\n77\n00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:57.850\nClick OK, and\nthen I actually have the roller.\n\n78\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.550\nHere it comes.\n\n79\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.550\nThanks!\n\n80\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.600\nGreat, and I made something just It's for\nyou Dan with a nest.\n\n81\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.629\nJust for you.\n\n82\n00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.370\n>> It's not perfect but\nit's close okay, and I made it.\n\n83\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.595\nThe thing is I can actually put an affect\non the actual nest itself not just\n\n84\n00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:26.907\nwhat's in the nest, and that will\naffect everything that is in the nest,\n\n85\n00:04:26.907 --> 00:04:30.781\nand this can be very important for\ncolor correction.\n\n86\n00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:34.740\nSo when we talk about it,\nI wanna go first to the effects area and\n\n87\n00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.151\ntalk about the fact that yeah we have\na thing called luminary presets,\n\n88\n00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:41.250\nwhich we're gonna look at.\n\n89\n00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.390\nToward the end by going to video facts,\nand\n\n90\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.780\nI go to color correction\nthere's a lot in here.\n\n91\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.700\nBrightness and contrast,\nchange color, change to color,\n\n92\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.250\nchannel mixer, color balance, color\nbalance based on hue saturation luma.\n\n93\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.280\n>> A lot of these turns are gonna\nbe you're gonna be like\n\n94\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.460\nit's just too bright, come on man.\n\n95\n00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.140\nAnd that is kind of the case\nit's like it's just too bright,\n\n96\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.490\nwhat am I suppose to do with this?\n\n97\n00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.720\nHow am I suppose to change this and\nmake it look better?\n\n98\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.463\nWell, we can do some very, very,\n\n99\n00:05:20.463 --> 00:05:26.330\nlike short,\nquick things to make this work.\n\n100\n00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.900\nWhat I'm gonna look for first is\ncalled a three-way color corrector,\n\n101\n00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.290\nit's under something called obsolete.\n\n102\n00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.790\nThey've sort of changed this now, okay.\n\n103\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.820\nThey've changed a few things in the newer\nversion, but they still offer them.\n\n104\n00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.080\nThe other one is the fast color corrector,\nalso under obsolete.\n\n105\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.390\nBut these are some sort of staples\nthat people tend to want to use.\n\n106\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.680\nNow, let's say I'm going to do just me.\n\n107\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.380\nI'm gonna turn off what's above,\nso I can see that.\n\n108\n00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.290\nI'm not gonna go to the color area yet.\n\n109\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.516\nWhat I'm going to say is hey\nI caught up one source clip.\n\n110\n00:06:12.516 --> 00:06:15.250\nOkay, remember that when\nI did my interview thing?\n\n111\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.320\nI cut it all up, and\nwhen I put in effect on it before,\n\n112\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.600\nit affected everything, so the first thing\nI'm gonna do is I'm gonna try that with\n\n113\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.440\na fast color corrector and\njust click and drag it over this one?\n\n114\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.590\nNo, what I'm going to do\nis highlight this one,\n\n115\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.250\ndo what I did before, make sure\nI'm referencing the master for it.\n\n116\n00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.350\nThat has a brightness in contrast on it.\n\n117\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.180\nThat's okay, I can go and\nleave it on there.\n\n118\n00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.500\nAnd say you know what I'm gonna use this\nfast color corrector and drop it on.\n\n119\n00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.650\n>> Does that override the?\n\n120\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.030\n>> No, it will stack.\n\n121\n00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.314\n>> Okay.\n>> They will stack together.\n\n122\n00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:54.240\n>> They work together.\n\n123\n00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.730\n>> So if I decided, hey I'm gonna turn off\nthat brightness and contrast for now, and\n\n124\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.140\nsee if I can just do it with\nthe fast color corrector.\n\n125\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.570\nI will do that.\n\n126\n00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.740\nLet me jump in real quick to show\nyou the fast color corrector.\n\n127\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.890\nIt's a fun little thing and\n\n128\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.460\nmost reasons people love this is because\nit's in color and it's got a little dial,\n\n129\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.330\nand you feel like you're really\ngetting in there and doing some work.\n\n130\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.940\nSo first of all the output composite or\n\n131\n00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.355\nluma generally wanted as\na composite signal on colors.\n\n132\n00:07:21.355 --> 00:07:25.010\nLay-out horizontal, vertical.\n\n133\n00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.750\nWhat is that for?\n\n134\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.280\nThat is to do with something called\nsplit view, and sort of like I sort of\n\n135\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.470\nran through the rolling title and forgot\nto click a couple of things, look for\n\n136\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:39.270\nthings that you can check in this, because\nthese tools tend to be very detailed.\n\n137\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.930\nOkay, they tend to be very, very detailed.\n\n138\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.950\nAnd I can say, show a split view,\nwhich I'm going to in a second.\n\n139\n00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.230\nNow, I have a thing called hue balance and\nangle.\n\n140\n00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.276\nAnd what that allows me to\ndo is adjust the color.\n\n141\n00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:58.425\nI also have what are known as\ninput levels, output levels, and\n\n142\n00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:03.298\nblack level, gray level,\nwhite level with Eyedroppers.\n\n143\n00:08:03.298 --> 00:08:06.701\nSome folks they say okay, look,\n\n144\n00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:12.070\nthis whole color correction thing,\nit scares me.\n\n145\n00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.700\nIt absolutely scares me.\n\n146\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.210\nAre there ways that I\ncan just say help me?\n\n147\n00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.100\nYes.\n\n148\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.560\nYou could do auto black, auto contrast,\n\n149\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.600\nauto white, and\nsimply click those and make it work.\n\n150\n00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.380\nAnd you might get a fairly decent result.\n\n151\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:35.000\nIf you wanna get a little more detailed,\nwhat I can do is I can say,\n\n152\n00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.720\nokay I'm gonna take this eye dropper,\nclick on it and say, all right,\n\n153\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.730\nin this picture,\nI'm saying that right there,\n\n154\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.707\nthat is black, click.\n\n155\n00:08:48.707 --> 00:08:49.779\nEh.\n\n156\n00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.220\nI might have overstepped.\n\n157\n00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.541\nWhite, that is white, and\ngray, I'll say my hair,\n\n158\n00:08:59.541 --> 00:09:05.120\nboom, now I've gone way overboard.\n\n159\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.240\nSo you want to have a larger or\nyou want to have better sampling, but\n\n160\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.250\nI can also just say do the auto black,\nthe auto white and then auto contrast it.\n\n161\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.080\nAnd you'll say that doesn't look\nlike it made much of a difference,\n\n162\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.380\nlet me turn it off and back on.\n\n163\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.899\nActually made a pretty good difference.\n\n164\n00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:22.030\nThat's with it off.\n\n165\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.201\nThat's with it on, and it did fairly well.\n\n166\n00:09:26.201 --> 00:09:27.371\n>> Livened up a little.\n\n167\n00:09:27.371 --> 00:09:30.150\n>> Livened it up a little bit, okay.\n\n168\n00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.920\nI can also adjust these input levels.\n\n169\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.614\nThe more I raise this one up, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:41.411 --> 00:09:46.555\nIt's interesting,\nbecause as I say I'm pulling it backward,\n\n171\n00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:51.150\nyes, but I'm adjusting\nthe input level of each, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.640\nSo then I can sorta get this.\n\n173\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.360\nLooks pretty good.\n\n174\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.980\nAnd what I am attempting to do is\ncreate a fairly balanced shot,\n\n175\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.210\nso that it's not too bright,\nit is not too dark.\n\n176\n00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.440\nSome people are going to\nsay what about scopes?\n\n177\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.460\nWe're going to address scopes in a minute.\n\n178\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.960\nI can also, while I'm working,\nshow a split.\n\n179\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.550\nSo now if I wanna show the split,\nit might be a little hard to see,\n\n180\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.110\nbut see how it gets\nbrighter on the bottom?\n\n181\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.360\nWhat I'm actually doing is I'm\nshowing the before and after.\n\n182\n00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.010\nAnd I can do that horizontally,\nor I can do that vertically.\n\n183\n00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:33.030\nAnd I can say this is what it was,\nthis is what it is, and like okay.\n\n184\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.250\nSo that's what it used to look like.\n\n185\n00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.040\nThis is what it looks like now.\n\n186\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.700\nIt's a very subtle change, and\nthat's all you really need.\n\n187\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.240\nOnce you start making very drastic changes\nlike I did when I wasn't really clicking.\n\n188\n00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.060\nI need to zoom in on this picture in\norder to pull those pixels properly.\n\n189\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.440\nWith it not like this, I really\nneed to do something like 400%, and\n\n190\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.000\nthen really go in and find it.\n\n191\n00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.440\nOr maybe even 150% to really go in and\n\n192\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.540\nfind this is black,\nthis is what I want it to do.\n\n193\n00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.930\n>> So\nyou might have to do some pixel peeping.\n\n194\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.385\n>> Right, ooh I like that.\n\n195\n00:11:10.385 --> 00:11:10.950\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n196\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.380\nSo what I can also do is if I\nwanna make a very simple change,\n\n197\n00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.020\nI can say okay this is my color.\n\n198\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.150\nAnd I can say let me warm\nup this shot a little bit.\n\n199\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.620\nJust pull it toward orange,\nthat's a little too warm.\n\n200\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.390\nThat's like a full on tint.\n\n201\n00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.706\nSo now here, I'm just saying it's outside,\nit's a little warm, maybe that.\n\n202\n00:11:29.706 --> 00:11:32.900\n>> A photo with a 70s disposable camera.\n\n203\n00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.330\n>> Maybe just warm it\nup just a little bit,\n\n204\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.250\nor if it's too warm,\ncool it down just a little.\n\n205\n00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.030\nNot much.\n\n206\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.570\nAnd it allows me to do that very,\nvery quickly,\n\n207\n00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.740\nthat's why it's the fast color corrector.\n\n208\n00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:52.050\n>> Is that how do they get those effects,\nthey use filters on their camera to get,\n\n209\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.600\nI've seen it before where they'll\njust make everything really blue, and\n\n210\n00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.070\nit kinda gives you the sense\nof it being colder,\n\n211\n00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:57.780\nor-\n>> Yes.\n\n212\n00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.870\n>> Whatever, so it's\n>> Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.450\n>> It's kind of an effect.\n\n214\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.950\n>> We are creating a look, and\n\n215\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.560\nthe interesting thing is if I go through,\nI turned up the top.\n\n216\n00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.710\nIt's effected everything,\nbecause the source code.\n\n217\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.700\nIt's even effected it in the nest,\n\n218\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.270\nbecause the pieces of this\nclip are part of the nest.\n\n219\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.000\nThe pieces of this clip part of the nest.\n\n220\n00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.880\nSo that is the fast color corrector.\n\n221\n00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.930\nWe can also use a three-way\ncolor corrector.\n\n222\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.250\nSome people used to go\nright straight to this one.\n\n223\n00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.680\nI just wanna show you a little bit of it,\n\n224\n00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.860\ncuz even though it says absolutely,\nit is still there.\n\n225\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.940\nIt is still there, people are still\ngoing to end up using it, so\n\n226\n00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.150\nI'll come in here and I'll go three.\n\n227\n00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.480\nThree way color correcter,\ndrag it up here.\n\n228\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.390\nBoom.\n\n229\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.240\nNow we get more controls.\n\n230\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:53.595\nWe get more controls that we can work\nwith, because now the color is separated\n\n231\n00:12:53.595 --> 00:12:59.395\ninto shadows, mid-tones and highlights,\nso now I know if I have a color cast\n\n232\n00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:04.190\nin the white like it's a, I could\ndefinitely see the blue in the light.\n\n233\n00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.620\nIn the highlights,\nI can pull that back a little bit.\n\n234\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.160\nMaybe there's a little bit\nof magenta in the shadows.\n\n235\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.670\nI can pull that back a little bit and\ndo that, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.240\nI still have my input levels.\n\n237\n00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.760\nI have my output levels.\n\n238\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.280\nLet's talk a little bit about\na tonal range definition.\n\n239\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:25.160\nRight now, if I turn this one, and I say\nplease show me the tonal range definition,\n\n240\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.350\nI will turn down the arrow,\nand I will say show it.\n\n241\n00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.080\nAnd it's like okay, what is it showing me?\n\n242\n00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.860\nIt's showing me if it's black that\nis considered a shadow, if it is\n\n243\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.300\nwhite that is considered a highlight, if\nit is grey that is considered a mid tone.\n\n244\n00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.330\nSo now I know if I'm correcting\na highlights, where are those highlights,\n\n245\n00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.880\nif I'm correcting shadows what has them.\n\n246\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.240\nSo what I could technically do and\nthis will not change the picture,\n\n247\n00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.280\nit's not re-lighting your picture,\nwhat I could say is let me do this, and\n\n248\n00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.170\nhave less highlights all over\nme by pulling these out and\n\n249\n00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:05.370\njust sort of say okay, I'd like a little\nbit more grey area to play with and\n\n250\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.770\nhighlights to play with too.\n\n251\n00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.550\nSo that way when I adjust the highlights,\nI'm primarily judging this and\n\n252\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.490\nthe shirt, the grey areas here and\nthe shadows there, okay.\n\n253\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.720\nSo, I am allowed to sort\nof re-define that area to\n\n254\n00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.700\nhelp with the color\ncorrection that I am doing.\n\n255\n00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:26.930\nAnd again, let me turn off\nthe show tonal range, okay.\n\n256\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:31.790\nSo now let's say I do a highlight here,\nand I really crank that up.\n\n257\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.910\nI'm gonna get a nice color cast in just\nwhat are highlights like right there\n\n258\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.790\ntop of my head I'm getting older.\n\n259\n00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.990\nThere's a nice magenta on there now,\nin the highlights.\n\n260\n00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.560\nOkay?\n\n261\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.090\nI can twirl that back.\n\n262\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.240\nI can also, notice again I have\nthe three things I can do.\n\n263\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.210\nThe shadows, the midtones and the\nhighlights to auto balance it that way, or\n\n264\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.030\nI can use my input levels.\n\n265\n00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.460\nOkay.\nI can use my input levels, and\n\n266\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.690\nthat interesting their saying\nare you inputing less white?\n\n267\n00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.840\nWhat are you doing.\n\n268\n00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.795\nI'm actually importing, I'm actually\nimputing more by pulling it that way.\n\n269\n00:15:09.795 --> 00:15:14.170\nInputing more shadow, and\n\n270\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.990\nthen the contrast, we often say, sometimes\njust some subtle contrast ranges, so\n\n271\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:23.080\nyou can understand the range from\nwhite to black, gives it definition,\n\n272\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.370\nand it actually saves you time\nfrom actually having to do color.\n\n273\n00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.260\nJust sometimes a little white,\nblack, and then contrast.\n\n274\n00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.580\nCuz what I'm looking to do in this,\nthis primary color correction,\n\n275\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.060\nis just line up the shots\njust to get them consistent.\n\n276\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.660\nI'm not really doing art at this point.\n\n277\n00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.720\nThat some people wanna\njump right into art.\n\n278\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.340\nSo I can do that, I have saturation, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.530\nI also have the auto levels,\nI can do those too.\n\n280\n00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.700\nI have a thing called\nthe secondary color corrector.\n\n281\n00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.042\nWhat is that?\nThat means I can put a mask if my face is\n\n282\n00:15:54.042 --> 00:16:00.634\njust too bright and just do my face, or,\nwhich is a little trickier, I can pull.\n\n283\n00:16:00.634 --> 00:16:01.706\nA color.\n\n284\n00:16:01.706 --> 00:16:07.650\nLet's say, or a highlight, and\nsay I'm just pulling blue.\n\n285\n00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.940\nYour blue is too bright.\n\n286\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.780\nI'll just pull the blue and\nadjust that down.\n\n287\n00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:18.835\nThe thing is if I'm doing that,\nI can no longer really use this a primary.\n\n288\n00:16:18.835 --> 00:16:23.325\nWhat I would do is use this as a primary\nto adjust the overall shot and\n\n289\n00:16:23.325 --> 00:16:29.060\nthen do a little tap with the eyedropper\nin another three way color corrector.\n\n290\n00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.530\nMake that my secondary to\njust do the blue, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.140\nIt's fun to play around with.\n\n292\n00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.570\nI'm gonna throw a set of\nscopes on this real quick.\n\n293\n00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:43.060\nI'm gonna use the new Lumetri Scopes\nto basically try and understand,\n\n294\n00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:49.440\nlet me undock this panel,\nwhat exactly is going on.\n\n295\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.100\nIf I control click on it I will say,\nall right, so\n\n296\n00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.140\nright now I am seeing what\nis known as a waveform.\n\n297\n00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.860\nAnd I'll say the Waveform Type is Luma.\n\n298\n00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:08.205\nSo it's telling me it's looking at the\npicture from left to right then saying,\n\n299\n00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:14.110\nokay, your shadows are fairly crushed and\nyou're too bright.\n\n300\n00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.810\nYour shadows are fairly crushed and\nyou are too bright.\n\n301\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.740\nI can also say all right,\nPresets, Brightness,\n\n302\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.380\nI could say that could\nbe a little brighter.\n\n303\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.150\nOkay, that's better.\n\n304\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.310\nIt's easier for me to see.\n\n305\n00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.540\nSo I've got a wrench for that.\n\n306\n00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.140\nAnd that's exactly what I'm doing.\n\n307\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:36.830\nI'm just taking a look at it and saying,\nall right, now if I adjust this.\n\n308\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.300\nAnd this is just for Luma, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.630\nThis is just for Luma as in,\nlet's go to the Effects Controls,\n\n310\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.980\nthrough a color corrector.\n\n311\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:52.930\nIf I start doing that input and\noutput, you're gonna see,\n\n312\n00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.107\nsee how it's starting to crush up there?\n\n313\n00:17:57.107 --> 00:17:59.737\nOr go way above where I need it.\n\n314\n00:17:59.737 --> 00:18:06.560\nSame thing if I start doing a black or\nif I do the contrast.\n\n315\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.660\nThe contrast is more like\na curve between black and\n\n316\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:16.610\nwhite and I'm starting to sharpen or\ngive it affinity if you will.\n\n317\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.790\nSo that's what this scope will do.\n\n318\n00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.414\nIt only, in this case, is reading Luma.\n\n319\n00:18:20.414 --> 00:18:20.914\nAll right.\n\n320\n00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:30.060\nIf we want to forgo all of this and\ndo something really cool and\n\n321\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:35.840\nnew in Adobe,\nwe can go to the Color window.\n\n322\n00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.210\nOkay, or the color Workspace,\n\n323\n00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:43.920\nwhich quite frankly is a lot of fun but\nat times can be a little bit daunting.\n\n324\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.040\nSo here it is.\n\n325\n00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:53.089\nNow, I'm going to move this over so\nI can just see the right side.\n\n326\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.114\nIt's stacked.\n\n327\n00:18:56.114 --> 00:19:02.447\nSo, if I click I start\nrevealing the stacks.\n\n328\n00:19:02.447 --> 00:19:06.840\nOkay, I start revealing the stacks\non here of what can be done.\n\n329\n00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.830\nSo, this is the Basic Correction, followed\nby a Creative, followed by Curves,\n\n330\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.070\nfollowed by Color Wheels,\nall types of things.\n\n331\n00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:22.850\nThis Color tool is quote unquote through\nthe roof with what you can do, okay?\n\n332\n00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.280\n>> It reminds kind of Lightroom actually.\n\n333\n00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.530\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n334\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.070\nIt has the same kind of paradigm cuz so\nmany people love Lightroom.\n\n335\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.430\nThere you go.\n\n336\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.430\nI mean, how can you not?\n\n337\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.460\n>> Yeah, it's an amazing product.\n\n338\n00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.530\n>> I mean, it is pretty terrific.\n\n339\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:43.780\nSo, then all I need to do is things like,\nokay let me do a basic correction.\n\n340\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.740\nAnd I can do things like\nadjust the color temperature.\n\n341\n00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.330\nI'm gonna highlight this one.\n\n342\n00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.040\nOkay, highlight the one that is put in,\nso I'm working with it.\n\n343\n00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.570\nAnd I can say, okay give me,\norange that up a bit.\n\n344\n00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.770\nOkay, it's warmed up.\n\n345\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.720\nI can adjust the exposure a little bit.\n\n346\n00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.530\nNow, a lot of people say should I\nnot do this if I haven't done RAW?\n\n347\n00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:12.412\nYeah, RAW, which is a photon count,\nprobably would be a little bit easier,\n\n348\n00:20:12.412 --> 00:20:15.104\nbut in this case, no,\nthis is working fine.\n\n349\n00:20:15.104 --> 00:20:16.402\n[CROSSTALK] Adjust the highlights.\n\n350\n00:20:16.402 --> 00:20:19.444\n>> With RAW, really what you're gaining\nout of it is that there is no data\n\n351\n00:20:19.444 --> 00:20:21.106\nthat has been compressed or removed.\n\n352\n00:20:21.106 --> 00:20:22.049\n>> Right.\nSo you're giving it,\n\n353\n00:20:22.049 --> 00:20:23.650\nyou're giving it all kinds of new data.\n\n354\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.325\n>> Exactly, but it doesn't mean you can't\ndo these things to a non-RAW source.\n\n355\n00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:27.083\n>> Exactly.\n\n356\n00:20:27.083 --> 00:20:28.308\nExactly.\n\n357\n00:20:28.308 --> 00:20:30.380\nSo I can do this basic correction.\n\n358\n00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:35.230\nThe interesting thing is in the basic\ncorrection I can either adjust these just\n\n359\n00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:40.530\nby themselves or I can say, I would\nlike an input LUT, or look up table.\n\n360\n00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:46.470\nSo if I have a look up table that I want,\nyou know, like an ALEXA or\n\n361\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:51.040\nan ARRI, or I went on the web and\nI got one, I can put this as an input LUT.\n\n362\n00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.150\nOkay?\n\n363\n00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.900\nAs in, this going to be a primary\ncolor correction for this.\n\n364\n00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:03.014\nAnd then I could do the white balance,\nall of these things in here, click it.\n\n365\n00:21:03.014 --> 00:21:05.930\nI also have a creative LUT.\n\n366\n00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.072\nOkay, a creative LUT\nbeing this crazy names.\n\n367\n00:21:09.072 --> 00:21:10.290\nLet me come over here.\n\n368\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.885\nSo I've got like, what is it, CineSpace.\n\n369\n00:21:12.885 --> 00:21:15.720\nAnd they give me some film stocks.\n\n370\n00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.880\nFuji ETERNA.\n\n371\n00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.410\nI believe they have a BLUE STEEL in here.\n\n372\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.080\nThey were just having fun and they\nmade a BLUE STEEL which is kinda cool.\n\n373\n00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.170\nAnd you can add that after you've made\nyour basic correction, it's like,\n\n374\n00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.110\nokay, it's color-balanced and all that.\n\n375\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.850\nAnd then I will add BLUE STEELl.\n\n376\n00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.270\nSo there is BLUE STEEL.\n\n377\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:35.860\nOkay.\n\n378\n00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.730\nAnd from there in the creative area,\nI usually just, I like to highlight it,\n\n379\n00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:42.610\nif I can.\n\n380\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:48.140\nI can come over here do BLUE STEEL,\ndo the faded film, and once I've\n\n381\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.850\nadded it from here, I like to work on it\nhere, once I've added the lumetry color.\n\n382\n00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:56.150\nAnd I do have a tint in the highlights\nthat I could change about it,\n\n383\n00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:58.980\nall kinds of things.\n\n384\n00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.456\nLet me come through here and it's on all\nof those cuz I did it on the source clip.\n\n385\n00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:09.300\nNow what if I go back to the pictures and\n\n386\n00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.320\nI want to do something\nlike that on the pictures?\n\n387\n00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.920\nJust all this stuff at the top,\nwhat would I do?\n\n388\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.489\nTwo schools of thought.\n\n389\n00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.990\nTwo schools of thought.\n\n390\n00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.350\nHave you ever heard of\nan adjustment layer?\n\n391\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.050\nYou have adjustment layers in Adobe.\n\n392\n00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:34.700\nEspecially, I know a lot of people\nthey'll say they use what is it?\n\n393\n00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.550\nThey use, that is not right.\n\n394\n00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.970\nThey use Photoshop.\n\n395\n00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.380\nAnd it's like, yeah,\nI use adjustment layers all the time.\n\n396\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.020\nIt's like, of course you would.\n\n397\n00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:48.040\nBecause it's really good to use\non photographs without affecting.\n\n398\n00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:54.140\nIf I go to New Item, I have the ability\nto get an Adjustment Layer.\n\n399\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:59.000\nLike an Offline File, a Sequence, Bars and\nTone, I can get an adjustment layer.\n\n400\n00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.110\nAnd a lot of people like doing\ntheir color correction this way.\n\n401\n00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.370\nThey'll do the adjustment layer.\n\n402\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.470\nI'm going to load it up here.\n\n403\n00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.290\nThere's nothing in it.\n\n404\n00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.420\nOkay I will come down to my sequence and\nI'm gonna say all right I want that\n\n405\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:18.760\nadjustment layer in video three and I'm\ngonna put an in point at the beginning and\n\n406\n00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.350\nan out point right here\nat the crazy title, okay.\n\n407\n00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.919\n>> So using an adjustment layer\nkeeps you from affecting the source?\n\n408\n00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.290\n>> Well,\nI'm going to show you what it does.\n\n409\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:28.861\n>> Okay.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n410\n00:23:28.861 --> 00:23:31.733\n>> So then I will say, okay over-write,\n\n411\n00:23:31.733 --> 00:23:36.344\nit's going to say what do I ignore,\nyou ignore the source out,\n\n412\n00:23:36.344 --> 00:23:42.103\nput it across the entire top, jump back\ninto here and it's that big pink line.\n\n413\n00:23:42.103 --> 00:23:48.350\nSo, imagine If you will, if I put\nan effect in the adjustment layer,\n\n414\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:54.733\nespecially like a color correction,\nit will do everything below it.\n\n415\n00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:56.552\nOkay?\n\n416\n00:23:56.552 --> 00:23:59.095\nIt will do everything below it.\n\n417\n00:23:59.095 --> 00:24:03.908\nSo if I come here and\nI make certain that what it\n\n418\n00:24:03.908 --> 00:24:08.350\nis highlighted is the adjustment layer.\n\n419\n00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.333\nAnd then I say okay,\nlet me just go through this real quick.\n\n420\n00:24:13.333 --> 00:24:16.778\nLet me just say under basic correction,\ngive me an input like the Alexa.\n\n421\n00:24:16.778 --> 00:24:21.614\nAnd then give me a creative lot\n\n422\n00:24:21.614 --> 00:24:26.657\nof I don't know, HDR bleach.\n\n423\n00:24:26.657 --> 00:24:31.553\nEverything below this has been affected,\n\n424\n00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:36.860\nincluding me right here,\nand what I did on me.\n\n425\n00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.840\nAnd it's like in some cases, and\nthis is what I often tell people.\n\n426\n00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.946\nIf you do everything in video one and then\ndo an adjustment layer, you can do your\n\n427\n00:24:44.946 --> 00:24:49.075\nprimary connections on all the shot then\ndo the adjustment later to do the look.\n\n428\n00:24:49.075 --> 00:24:54.465\nThe problem is I have two,\nI have two tracks here.\n\n429\n00:24:54.465 --> 00:24:57.513\nI have a V2 and a V1 so\nit's doing everything underneath.\n\n430\n00:24:57.513 --> 00:25:03.399\nSo what I either really want to\ndo is make the adjustment layer,\n\n431\n00:25:03.399 --> 00:25:09.743\nonly the size where the pictures\nare cuz I wanted it on the pictures.\n\n432\n00:25:09.743 --> 00:25:13.232\nOr nest the pictures and\ndo it in the nest,\n\n433\n00:25:13.232 --> 00:25:19.360\nbecause that way it's only\naffecting what's inside the nest.\n\n434\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.063\nSo that's why it's good\nto know the difference.\n\n435\n00:25:21.063 --> 00:25:22.948\nIf some people just say, yeah,\nI'll just use an adjustment layer.\n\n436\n00:25:22.948 --> 00:25:28.260\nNests and adjustments layers exist so\nyou can use them specifically.\n\n437\n00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.146\nIf I can just effect everything\nunderneath the adjustment layer,\n\n438\n00:25:31.146 --> 00:25:33.993\nI will just effect everything\nunderneath the adjustment layer.\n\n439\n00:25:33.993 --> 00:25:37.090\nAnd you will notice,\nadjustment layers do have motion.\n\n440\n00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:42.047\nThey do have opacity, they do\ntechnically have time remapping and\n\n441\n00:25:42.047 --> 00:25:43.980\nthey will hold effects.\n\n442\n00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.690\nAnd so that everything\nunderneath that gets the effect.\n\n443\n00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.340\nSo sometimes in color correction,\n\n444\n00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.220\nthat will work especially if you're\nusing the new color interface.\n\n445\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.225\nAnd again, it's a top to bottom,\nleft to right you go down.\n\n446\n00:25:58.225 --> 00:26:01.786\nAnd I like the way they stack this thing,\nI really do.\n\n447\n00:26:01.786 --> 00:26:06.346\nBecause you can just start with your\nbasic correction and make balance it out,\n\n448\n00:26:06.346 --> 00:26:09.661\ndo your white balance and\nyour contrast and all that, and\n\n449\n00:26:09.661 --> 00:26:11.960\nthen you can go to something creative.\n\n450\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.880\nAnd if you're a big fan of curves,\nyou have curves now.\n\n451\n00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.596\nSo you can do, I can do this luma\ncurve here and change that out.\n\n452\n00:26:22.596 --> 00:26:29.210\nI can add numerous points and\nchange the whole luma curve of everything.\n\n453\n00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:34.130\nI also have a hue saturation curve.\n\n454\n00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.510\nAnd this item is some people they jump\nright to curves, they go I love curves,\n\n455\n00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.700\nI'm using the curves,\nhere come curves, I'm doing it.\n\n456\n00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.611\nOther people love hue saturation luma.\n\n457\n00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:46.560\nLearn to love both.\n\n458\n00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.540\nThe difference between that is if you\nuse a hue saturation luma wheel, you\n\n459\n00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.630\nare not effected or hue saturation curve,\nyou are not effecting the overall luma.\n\n460\n00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.940\nIt's handling the chroma and\nthe luma separately.\n\n461\n00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.870\nNow I know some people who are really,\nreally into color correction,\n\n462\n00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.865\nwill say you're using chroma incorrectly,\nI know I understand that.\n\n463\n00:27:04.865 --> 00:27:06.631\nI'm basically just\ntalking about the color.\n\n464\n00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:11.870\nSo you're effecting the color\nseparately from the luma.\n\n465\n00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:18.490\nIf I'm using curves, it's on a film basis,\nlike red, green, blue make white.\n\n466\n00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.550\nAnd they make luma, so\nsometimes when you affect the red, green,\n\n467\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.690\nblue, you're affecting the overall luma.\n\n468\n00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:30.069\nPractice that as much as possible,\nand you can see the difference.\n\n469\n00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.180\nUsually your dials or\nyour hue saturation curves\n\n470\n00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.830\nare based on a television signal with\na luma or chroma were sent separately.\n\n471\n00:27:40.855 --> 00:27:44.549\nSo that was because people who\nowned black and white televisions.\n\n472\n00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:49.511\nIf they were sending a color signal, still\nhad to be able to see it, so that's why.\n\n473\n00:27:49.511 --> 00:27:51.630\nFilm, film is film.\n\n474\n00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.200\nYou can also get color wheels and\na secondary,\n\n475\n00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.040\nif you activate a secondary you can\ndo your secondaries in there as well.\n\n476\n00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.600\nColor correction is really,\nit is an art form and\n\n477\n00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.830\nit takes a long time to really understand\nhow color affects the brain everything.\n\n478\n00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:12.794\nBut you can get away with some minor,\nminor things using this color or\n\n479\n00:28:12.794 --> 00:28:17.244\nusing what they now call some of\nthe old obsolete tools to color\n\n480\n00:28:17.244 --> 00:28:21.610\ncorrect either each individual clip,\nclips inside a nest or\n\n481\n00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.977\neverything underneath an adjustment layer.\n\n482\n00:28:24.977 --> 00:28:29.811\nOr combination of all three, that's why\nyou wanna understand from the beginning\n\n483\n00:28:29.811 --> 00:28:34.740\nwhy we were putting our media and things\ninto the timeline in a specific way.\n\n484\n00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.720\nEspecially, once we get\nto color correction,\n\n485\n00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.250\nwhich I recommend you\ndoing close to the end.\n\n486\n00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:43.269\nIf you kinda start with color correction\nat the beginning, it gets kinda dicey.\n\n487\n00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:45.630\nBecause then it's like you haven't\nconstructed your story yet, and\n\n488\n00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.800\nyou're like wait why was that purple,\nwhy did I make that blue?\n\n489\n00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.813\nI've gotta do it all over again.\n\n490\n00:28:48.813 --> 00:28:51.859\nSo once you have your story,\nyou can then get into the color and\n\n491\n00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:55.268\nhow you wanna map it, and how you\nwanna make things look really good.\n\n492\n00:28:55.268 --> 00:28:58.274\n>> Yeah, I'm guessing that if\nyou're using multiple sources,\n\n493\n00:28:58.274 --> 00:29:01.792\ndifferent cameras, you throw something\nin there for color correction,\n\n494\n00:29:01.792 --> 00:29:04.531\nyou might overstep your boundary and\nget a little crazy.\n\n495\n00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:08.415\n>> It's a joke, he doesn't like to have\nme tell this, but I had a friend and\n\n496\n00:29:08.415 --> 00:29:12.514\nwe would shoot with him, and we would\nalways call it Blaine's blue camera.\n\n497\n00:29:12.514 --> 00:29:15.206\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I don't know why, but somehow he\n\n498\n00:29:15.206 --> 00:29:18.873\nwould white balance to a sandwich or\nsomething and it was always to blue.\n\n499\n00:29:18.873 --> 00:29:23.242\nAnd so we just created a color correction\nparameter that can you create a preset?\n\n500\n00:29:23.242 --> 00:29:23.889\nYeah.\n\n501\n00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:25.613\nYou know how to do that,\ntake the Lumetri, create a preset.\n\n502\n00:29:25.613 --> 00:29:28.738\nEvery time we saw his camera it's like\nit's Blaine's camera, pop it on there and\n\n503\n00:29:28.738 --> 00:29:30.512\nthen it was fine to look\nlike very other camera.\n\n504\n00:29:30.512 --> 00:29:31.018\n>> Yeah.\n\n505\n00:29:31.018 --> 00:29:32.382\n>> Sometimes yeah, you're right,\nyou may use multiple cameras.\n\n506\n00:29:32.382 --> 00:29:35.996\nA different manufacturer of cameras,\na different color scheme than another and\n\n507\n00:29:35.996 --> 00:29:38.740\nyou could just sort of tighten\nup the look a little bit.\n\n508\n00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.053\nIt's never going to be perfect,\n\n509\n00:29:41.053 --> 00:29:44.862\nwe don't perceive each individual shot and\nall that.\n\n510\n00:29:44.862 --> 00:29:48.138\nIf you can make it consistent\nacross the whole thing, and\n\n511\n00:29:48.138 --> 00:29:51.940\nthen add your super cool look,\nyou'll be much much better.\n\n512\n00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.290\nCuz that way people, they're trying\nto experience the whole thing,\n\n513\n00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:57.250\nnot just one shot to another.\n\n514\n00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.861\nIt's an entire experience, and\n\n515\n00:29:58.861 --> 00:30:02.484\nyou have to remember that when you're\ncolor correcting cuz if you don't,\n\n516\n00:30:02.484 --> 00:30:06.179\nit's like that thing where I rush\nthe rolling title and I forgot something.\n\n517\n00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:10.349\nAnd it's like I forgot one little\nthing and that was a problem or\n\n518\n00:30:10.349 --> 00:30:14.770\nI over extended something and\nthat it made an ever bigger problem.\n\n519\n00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.219\nYou wanna get a nice balance in there, so\n\n520\n00:30:17.219 --> 00:30:20.256\nI always like to call it\ncolor balancing instead.\n\n521\n00:30:20.256 --> 00:30:24.450\nSo it's not so much as a correction\nlike you did something wrong.\n\n522\n00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.252\nAnything can happen in the world of color.\n\n523\n00:30:26.252 --> 00:30:29.766\n>> Or you just want to have a different\nyou think, looks a little flat.\n\n524\n00:30:29.766 --> 00:30:31.113\n>> Yeah.\n\n525\n00:30:31.113 --> 00:30:32.719\n>> Bring a little more color to it,\nadd a little more color.\n\n526\n00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:35.486\nBe careful though, I'm a photographer,\nI'm not in the film.\n\n527\n00:30:35.486 --> 00:30:40.324\nIt's really easy to overcorrect and\nyou'll get bogged, you'll think,\n\n528\n00:30:40.324 --> 00:30:43.718\nyou're moving little\nsliders with just minutiae.\n\n529\n00:30:43.718 --> 00:30:45.110\nJust a little bit-\n>> Yeah.\n\n530\n00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.932\n>> That's a little bit better and\nthose little things that you add up man.\n\n531\n00:30:47.932 --> 00:30:49.057\nIt just looks like junk when your done.\n\n532\n00:30:49.057 --> 00:30:51.768\n>> It's also one things color\ncorrection has gotten so\n\n533\n00:30:51.768 --> 00:30:54.237\nmuch easier to control\nover the past few years.\n\n534\n00:30:54.237 --> 00:30:58.106\nNow the tools are so much easier\nto use and people are like gosh,\n\n535\n00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:59.724\nI can really do color now.\n\n536\n00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:02.261\nNow I'm gonna do really do color and\nyou realize.\n\n537\n00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:03.532\n>> Why is everyone red?\n\n538\n00:31:03.532 --> 00:31:04.473\n>> You don't really have to do that-\n\n539\n00:31:04.473 --> 00:31:05.472\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Much.\n\n540\n00:31:05.472 --> 00:31:06.390\n>> Yeah.\n>> Don't really have to do that much\n\n541\n00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:06.918\nand it looks, pretty good.\n\n542\n00:31:06.918 --> 00:31:07.816\n>> Add a little contrast.\n\n543\n00:31:07.816 --> 00:31:09.363\n>> Add a little contrast.\n\n544\n00:31:09.363 --> 00:31:10.894\n>> Adjust the blacks a little bit.\n\n545\n00:31:10.894 --> 00:31:11.634\n>> Boom.\n\n546\n00:31:11.634 --> 00:31:12.301\n>> Yeah.\n\n547\n00:31:12.301 --> 00:31:12.999\n>> It looks great.\n\n548\n00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:14.131\n>> It is, it is.\n\n549\n00:31:14.131 --> 00:31:14.860\nYou do a great job.\n\n550\n00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.144\n>> Well thank you.\n>> Thank you so much for\n\n551\n00:31:16.144 --> 00:31:18.478\nsharing how to use color\ncorrection inside a Premiere.\n\n552\n00:31:18.478 --> 00:31:21.534\nObviously now that's one thing we have\nto do in Photoshopor [INAUDIBLE] or\n\n553\n00:31:21.534 --> 00:31:22.696\nwhatever your gonna do..\n\n554\n00:31:22.696 --> 00:31:26.994\nIt's built right into Premiere so\nthat's pretty sweet and like I said,\n\n555\n00:31:26.994 --> 00:31:30.249\nit does look a lot like those\nother interfaces as well.\n\n556\n00:31:30.249 --> 00:31:32.061\nProbably because they're made by Adobe,\nthat might have something to do with it.\n\n557\n00:31:32.061 --> 00:31:34.702\n>> And you can feel comfortable\ngoing from one to the other\n\n558\n00:31:34.702 --> 00:31:35.461\nnow-\n>> Right.\n\n559\n00:31:35.461 --> 00:31:36.948\n>> Because the interfaces look so\nmuch alike, so yeah.\n\n560\n00:31:36.948 --> 00:31:38.506\n>> Yeah, awesome stuff.\n\n561\n00:31:38.506 --> 00:31:42.207\nJim we thank you for joining us today,\nbut it is that time yet\n\n562\n00:31:42.207 --> 00:31:44.439\nagain for us to close down the show.\n\n563\n00:31:44.439 --> 00:31:47.593\nThat's right, hang our heads and\nbe down trotting, but\n\n564\n00:31:47.593 --> 00:31:50.691\ndon't worry we'll have another one very,\nvery soon.\n\n565\n00:31:50.691 --> 00:31:53.680\nAnd signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.950\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.200\nin today's episode we continue on with\nmore of our Premier Pros series, and\n\n5\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.170\njoining us back in the studio one more\ntime is our good friend, Mr. Jim Biddle.\n\n6\n00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.430\nJim, welcome back sir.\n\n7\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.670\n>> Hey, it's good to be back.\n\n8\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.740\n>> Nice.\n>> I'm excited,\n\n9\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.980\nbut this is\n>> I know, it's bitter sweet right\n\n10\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.150\n>> This is saving and\n\n11\n00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.830\nexport and other other stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.830\nBut I was guys starting with\nsomething a little bit cool that\n\n13\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.000\nwe might have done in the last lesson.\n\n14\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.140\nSo let's go through the interface real\nquick, I wanna show you something.\n\n15\n00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.030\nRemember when we first started said, hey,\nI use this really cool application for\n\n16\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.250\nmy phone, okay.\n\n17\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.930\nAnd it's like Android iOS thing\nwhere I tool some video, and\n\n18\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.120\nI brought it into my creative cloud and\nthen I was able to use it in Premier.\n\n19\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.580\nWell I used another one\ncalled Adobe Capture, and,\n\n20\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.040\nlet me go to libraries, okay.\n\n21\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.110\nI'm going to go to a workspace\ncalled Libraries up here, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.960\nGonna click that, and I have a look,\nand you're like, well what's that?\n\n23\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.150\nWell, this is a place I go to a lot\nwhere I live called Blue Sky, and\n\n24\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.780\nit's got a little color scheme down here.\n\n25\n00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.590\nAll I did, is I took a picture, and\n\n26\n00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.570\nit broke it down into\nthat little color scheme.\n\n27\n00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.255\nAnd if you've ever looked at\nthe Lumetry effects, you'll say, hey,\n\n28\n00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:39.810\nthat kinda looks like those little color\nthings next to to the Lumetry looks.\n\n29\n00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.850\nThat's exactly what I did using my phone,\nI said, okay maybe I shot\n\n30\n00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.940\na lot of video in this location,\nI'm gonna take this little Adobe thing.\n\n31\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.800\nTake a picture, and\nit breaks it down by a look and\n\n32\n00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.720\nthen all I have to do is\ndrag it on top of a segment.\n\n33\n00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.610\nIt's unfortunately very, very subtle, but\n\n34\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.660\nif I highlight it,\nit's there, there it is.\n\n35\n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.290\nI can turn it off and I can turn it on,\nit's really quite subtle.\n\n36\n00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.280\nIt adds just a little bit of blue to it,\nyou really can't see it to well.\n\n37\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.510\nBut I have added my own Lumetry\ncolor look by using my phone.\n\n38\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.760\nSo if I shot someplace all day or\nif I went somewhere and was like, wow,\n\n39\n00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.840\nI really like this color look breakdown.\n\n40\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.910\nTake a picture, goes in my Creative Cloud,\nI have my own light, and\n\n41\n00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.310\nit's really a lot of fun.\n\n42\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.900\n>> That's an easy way to create a look.\n\n43\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.150\n>> Right, I know, it's real-\n>> Snap on your phone.\n\n44\n00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.720\n>> And it's great, I just took a picture\nof it and you can adjust it there's these\n\n45\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.270\nlittle things on there it's like I want\nthis to be the primary and all that.\n\n46\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.710\nAnd you can look up how Lutz are created\nand what the primary focus of the colors\n\n47\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.550\nis and then when you take this picture,\n'm gonna do this, do this.\n\n48\n00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.190\nIt's really, it's so much fun and\n\n49\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.420\nyou're in the creative process\neven down to these color lights.\n\n50\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.750\nNow couple things I'm getting toward\nthe end I've got everything done.\n\n51\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.880\nI'm gonna go ahead and export this.\n\n52\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.630\nIt's not the best but you know for\n\n53\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.190\nmy friends, this is gonna be\na really cool little video.\n\n54\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.200\nOf course if it was\nsomething more professional,\n\n55\n00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.360\nI want to take some more time,\nshimmy up all the edits and all that.\n\n56\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.790\nSo what can I do now with this?\n\n57\n00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.710\nWell, all kinds of stuff.\n\n58\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.550\nFirst thing,\n\n59\n00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.490\nI'm gonna check, under Preferences there's\nthis thing that says my email address.\n\n60\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.190\nYou wanna email me?\n\n61\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.390\nEmail me.\nIt says Sync Settings Now.\n\n62\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.830\nThis means I'm logged into\nmy Creative Cloud account.\n\n63\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.750\nAnd I've been working with things\nfrom my Creative Cloud account.\n\n64\n00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.820\nNow say, I'm gonna sync my settings\nright now, it's gonna ask me a question.\n\n65\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.150\nIt's gonna say, Okay do you wanna upload\nsettings to keep the local settings and\n\n66\n00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.200\nreplace the cloud settings, or\ndo I want to keep the cloud settings and\n\n67\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.330\nreplace the local settings?\n\n68\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.510\nAnd basically what I say is all right,\nI've been working locally all this time.\n\n69\n00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.080\nI need to replace what's on\nthe cloud cuz it made updates.\n\n70\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.650\nI made updates to my presets, maybe I made\nsome updates to my libraries, and that's\n\n71\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.540\nwhat I'll say is, okay let's upload those\nsettings and it's just going to sync them.\n\n72\n00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.870\nGo on there, take care of it, and\n\n73\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.320\nI've uploaded a lot of the things that\nI've created in terms of preferences.\n\n74\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.370\nRemember I created all of those\npreferences and things like that.\n\n75\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.130\nThose are now loaded up there so\n\n76\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.110\nI can now download them again and\nuse them, all right?\n\n77\n00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.440\nIf I wanted to, I could go here to my\nCreative Cloud icon, say open the folder.\n\n78\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.085\nAnd let's see what been done.\n\n79\n00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:34.530\nBoom, we have a Cloud clip,\nboom, all that,\n\n80\n00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.840\nit's all been uploaded in there so\nI can use it, okay.\n\n81\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.740\nIt's all been uploaded in there so\nI can use it.\n\n82\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.249\nI can also come out to the finder,\ncommand N,\n\n83\n00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.380\ncome to documents,\n\n84\n00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.210\ncome to Premier Pro 10.0, and\nsee what I've been doing.\n\n85\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.920\nHere's my profile from the Creative Cloud\nand the profile from the host, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.080\nSo, the Creative Cloud, see this\nthing called a Effects Presets and\n\n87\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.340\nCustom Items, or\nI'll often call it the prfpset.\n\n88\n00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.420\nIf I've been working on my Creative Cloud,\n\n89\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.160\nevery effect pre-set that I've\ncreated goes into that file, and\n\n90\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.000\nnow that I've done the upload it's gone up\nthere and saved it and I can use it again.\n\n91\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.600\nIf I hadn't been doing that okay.\n\n92\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.860\nIt would have been on this host one,\nwhere it says effects, presets and custom.\n\n93\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.220\nOkay.\nIt would have been on that pfpset.\n\n94\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.800\nThen you say man,\nthat didn't end up in my Creative Cloud,\n\n95\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.760\nnow what, can I never use this again?\n\n96\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.500\nYes you can.\n\n97\n00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.620\nI can actually do this, if you forgot,\n\n98\n00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.590\nit's like,\nI forgot to use my Creative Cloud.\n\n99\n00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.710\nThis occasionally happens,\n\n100\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.080\nit's like I forgot to log in and\nI did all this stuff, I'm done for.\n\n101\n00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.640\nNope, Adobe thought about this long\nbefore they had the Creative Cloud.\n\n102\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.200\nI can go to the presets,\ncontrol click it, and\n\n103\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.450\nsay export it and it will export it,\nas a file, a new prfpset, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.560\nIt says that, prfpset, and\nI can name it anything I want, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.190\nI can say 07/25/2016 ITProTV,\n\n106\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.920\nI can save it anywhere I can\neven save it to my drive.\n\n107\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.690\nSave it, it's gonna be on there.\n\n108\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.380\nOkay, right there it is.\n\n109\n00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.560\nAnd then when I come into a new\nterminal that I'm working on,\n\n110\n00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.990\nI can say, right,\nI didn't put that one on my Cloud.\n\n111\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.300\nI can just import it and puts it in there\nand i have all the presets that I made.\n\n112\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.580\nSo if I forgot to do the Creative Cloud,\nthere you go\n\n113\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.363\n>> You're not out of luck.\n\n114\n00:06:53.363 --> 00:06:56.220\n>> I'm not out of luck,\nAdobe has though of a lot of this things.\n\n115\n00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.620\nOops I forgot to log in, or\noccasionally what happen is,\n\n116\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.260\nI work in places where I'm not allow\nto log in because they have firewall.\n\n117\n00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.700\nAnd they're gonna say, we're not allowing\nyou to login which is a shame but\n\n118\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.020\nAdobe is like, hey you realize not\neverybody will allow you to do this so,\n\n119\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.710\nno problem we'll let you do that.\n\n120\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.480\nOkay, let's say,\nnow I'm getting ready to export, but\n\n121\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.900\nthere's all different kinds of things.\n\n122\n00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.590\nLet's say, Dan, you, or\nmaybe my favorite switcher here,\n\n123\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.420\nmaybe what it is is like hey,\nyou've been working on that project.\n\n124\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.320\nCan you give it to me?\n\n125\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.560\nAnd I'll say, well, yeah,\ndo you want the whole project?\n\n126\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.620\nYeah, and all the media too.\n\n127\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.090\nOkay, maybe, what happens is you\nthink part of it's on this drive,\n\n128\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.820\npart of it's on this drive,it's\nall in separate places.\n\n129\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.650\nThis is not going to be a simple drag and\ndrop.\n\n130\n00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.640\nSo, I can come up here to file and\n\n131\n00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.780\nI have a thing down here\ncalled a Project Manager.\n\n132\n00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.260\nAnd if I click on it,\nI get this dialog which says,\n\n133\n00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.660\nokay you have all these sequences,\nwhich ones do you wanna send?\n\n134\n00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.000\nAnd I'll say to you,\nhey which ones do you want?\n\n135\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.244\nJust say, I just want the garden sequence,\nthat's it.\n\n136\n00:08:07.244 --> 00:08:11.950\nAnd I'll say, okay, and then I can\nsay I'd like you to just collect\n\n137\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.960\neverything involved in this and\njust copy it to a new location.\n\n138\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.190\nTo a new drive.\nIt's like give me your drive,\n\n139\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.030\nand they'll say, okay and\nthey'll do that, I can just do that.\n\n140\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.350\nI have all these options,\nI can say exclude any unused clips, as in,\n\n141\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.510\nif I didn't use it, don't send it over.\n\n142\n00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.970\nI'll say, do you want every file?\n\n143\n00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.890\nNo, just what you used in the timeline.\n\n144\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.810\nOkay, I can rename the media\nfiles to match the clip names.\n\n145\n00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.980\nWhen I did that reveal in Finder before,\nwhat I had named it in the project,\n\n146\n00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.350\nit didn't have the same\nname as the media file.\n\n147\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.390\nBut, you might say, can you do that?\n\n148\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.500\nI'm gonna get confused.\n\n149\n00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.990\nAnd I'll say, sure, it'll do that.\n\n150\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.940\nI can include preview files.\n\n151\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.050\nI mean, essentially what a lot\nof us call render files.\n\n152\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.240\nI can include those too so\nI don't necessarily have to re-render.\n\n153\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.420\nOr you say, no, just go ahead and\ndo that and just let's re-render it.\n\n154\n00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:01.940\nIt's like, okay.\n\n155\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:08.550\nAnd then I could say, a destination path\nplease, where do I want it to go, and\n\n156\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:13.960\nit will give me an idea of calculating how\nmuch disk space I'm going to need for it.\n\n157\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.500\nSo if you give me a drive that's big\nenough I can say okay yeah your drive is\n\n158\n00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.740\nclearly big enough.\n\n159\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.840\nThe other thing I could technically\ndo is I could Consolidate and\n\n160\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.920\ntranscode it for you.\n\n161\n00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.850\nAnd say, give me the individual\nclips the sequence or a pre set.\n\n162\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.330\nI will say, hm, individual clips,\n\n163\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.880\nwhat format Quick Time and\na pre set of ProRes 422.\n\n164\n00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.110\nIt's like, give it to me,\nbut I want it all in 422.\n\n165\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.950\nAnd I'll do that and then you get\neverything and then you just unplug and\n\n166\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.230\ngo, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.280\nYou just unplug and go.\n\n168\n00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:53.170\n>> This is not just your\nmamma's old save and share.\n\n169\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.092\nThis is actually like very granular and\nfiltered even.\n\n170\n00:09:57.092 --> 00:10:01.230\n>> Right, and I could say it's like I\nwanna put this to a smaller drive, but\n\n171\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.230\nI don't have all the space for all the\nmedia, just what I used in the sequence.\n\n172\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.610\nCuz maybe I'm taking on a plane or\nsomething, and\n\n173\n00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.310\nI can't log with my big 64 terabyte\ndrive I get a little one terabyte.\n\n174\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.427\n>> Maybe you can't.\n\n175\n00:10:13.427 --> 00:10:17.885\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, I mean, I have been profiled.\n\n176\n00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:20.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'll just do it to something\n\n177\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.880\nsmaller, only taking the media that\nI actually need to go with me.\n\n178\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.140\nSo that's a project manage.\n\n179\n00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:34.250\nWhat I can also do Is I can say,\nokay, first off, maybe,\n\n180\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:39.060\nI want to do some stills, maybe, I'm gonna\nmake a little package with this, okay.\n\n181\n00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.790\nAnd let's say, that's a good,\nthat's a great frog right there,\n\n182\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.560\nI wanna create some stills for little book\nor if you still make DVDs, a DVD cover,\n\n183\n00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.760\nsomething like that If I come to the\ncamera, and this can be done on the source\n\n184\n00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.970\nor the record side,\nit will say export frame.\n\n185\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.250\nAnd it will be like, okay,\nthe frame I see is the one I wanna export.\n\n186\n00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.610\nThis is a cool thing that's gonna be\nused in the export dialog as well.\n\n187\n00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.250\nIf I click that, it's going to say,\nokay, first of all,\n\n188\n00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:13.700\nwhat is the name I'm gonna say, frog.\n\n189\n00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.660\nFormat, a DPX, a JPEG,\na PNG, a Targa, a TFF.\n\n190\n00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.630\nSomebody might say, just give us a JPEG.\n\n191\n00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:25.060\nMaybe somebody wants to do a little web\narticle on it, say, just give us a JPEG.\n\n192\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.260\nYou choose your location of where you\nwant it This is the cool feature.\n\n193\n00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:37.710\nIt has Import into project,\nas in once I create this\n\n194\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.020\nexported frame, it'll automatically\nput that reference in the project.\n\n195\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.070\nObject so I can use it as a still.\n\n196\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.680\nUsually, what we'd have\nto do is export it.\n\n197\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.200\nGo into the finder, or go into something\nlike the media browser, find it, and\n\n198\n00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.370\nthen bring it back in.\n\n199\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.930\nNo, it has, it's like, okay,\njust pop it back in for me, would you?\n\n200\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.070\nOkay, boom, it creates it.\n\n201\n00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.710\nIf I come back to the project,\nthere it is, Frog.jpg.\n\n202\n00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.520\nIt immediately brought that back into me.\n\n203\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.760\nThat is amazingly convenient, to just\nsay You didn't create a still for me?\n\n204\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.770\nYeah, was it.\n\n205\n00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.070\nCan you export it again?\n\n206\n00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.250\nSure, okay.\n\n207\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.060\nAnd you know where it is and\nit brings it right back into the project.\n\n208\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.520\nSo, now this is the point where I wanna\nmake some stills, maybe for press or\n\n209\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.070\na packet or something.\n\n210\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.380\n>> Now if the W ever needs a salesman for\n\n211\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.280\ntheir premier product\nthen I'll recommend Jim.\n\n212\n00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.430\n>> Thanks.\nIt not like I'm trying to sell it.\n\n213\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.168\n>> I know but-\n>> I'm just saying there's a lot\n\n214\n00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.150\nof convenience here.\n\n215\n00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.590\n>> When you show what it can do and\nhow convenient it actually is,\n\n216\n00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.370\nit's like wow I wanna give that.\n\n217\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.190\nI wanna have that.\n\n218\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:38.780\n>> Okay good.\n\n219\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.180\nIt's all passive I swear.\n\n220\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.190\nSo now, I can go to Export, and we have\n\n221\n00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.160\nmany different things here, we have media,\nwhich is the one we're going to end with.\n\n222\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.990\nWe have a thing called\nan edit decision list.\n\n223\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:56.200\nEdit decision lists were used in case,\nlet's say for some strange reason you're\n\n224\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.370\nworking with someone that has\nanother editing application.\n\n225\n00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.870\nThey might say,\nhey if you send me an edit decision list,\n\n226\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.180\nwhich is basically sort of like a text\nfile of where all the cuts are.\n\n227\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.150\nI can just put that in,\nand then relink the media.\n\n228\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.420\n>> And you can get all kinds of\nwhite papers on how this works.\n\n229\n00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.090\nIt's fairly limited.\n\n230\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.630\nIt's actually very, very limited.\n\n231\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.380\nYou're limited to like one video track and\nfour audio tracks.\n\n232\n00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.660\nBut if you're cutting something simple,\nit's a great way to trade.\n\n233\n00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.080\nYou could also do an OMF.\n\n234\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.250\nThat's oftentimes if somebody has a\nspecific Audio program that they're using.\n\n235\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.230\nThey'll say hey,\nsend me an OMF of this okay?\n\n236\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.190\nAnd that way I have,\nit's kind of like an EDL but\n\n237\n00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.160\nfor audio and I can put all\nthe audio together in my system,\n\n238\n00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.270\ndo all my really cool whiz bang stuff and\nthen send it back to you.\n\n239\n00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.800\nMarkers.\n\n240\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.140\nLet's say you want to send somebody\na market list and you say to yourself,\n\n241\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.090\nwhy would I want to send\nsomebody a marker list?\n\n242\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.810\nThat seems really silly.\n\n243\n00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.630\nWell, what I didn't show you is if I\ncome over, there's a Markers menu.\n\n244\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.430\nAnd this will work for clips, depending\non whether you've highlighted a clip, or\n\n245\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.810\nif I just highlight the timeline.\n\n246\n00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.749\nHere's all the markers.\n\n247\n00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.360\nAnd what I could do, is I can actually\nleave notes for myself with markers.\n\n248\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.730\nInstead of doing little posted or\nsend notes to other people.\n\n249\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.060\nLet's take the first one for example.\n\n250\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.910\nI'm going, actually I'm gonna go to\nthe last marker and double click it.\n\n251\n00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.970\nAnd it comes out with a marker dialogue.\n\n252\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.917\nAnd I'm going to say\nthat the name is color\n\n253\n00:14:24.917 --> 00:14:30.020\ncorrect this area.\n\n254\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.778\nOkay with a lot of exclamation points.\n\n255\n00:14:31.778 --> 00:14:36.460\nComments, too blue.\n\n256\n00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.340\nOkay.\n\n257\n00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.730\nI have this little trick where I\ncan change the color of the marker.\n\n258\n00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.390\nI'll usually send it to people as red.\n\n259\n00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.050\nThat means it needs to be done.\n\n260\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.950\nWhen they've done it,\nthey'll change it to yellow.\n\n261\n00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.900\nAnd then when I say it's okay,\nI'll change it to green.\n\n262\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.320\nIt's a cool part.\n\n263\n00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.250\nIt's this thing called a duration.\n\n264\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.540\nRight now the marker is\njust one little frame.\n\n265\n00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:06.810\nI could say, actually,\nmake that about three seconds in duration.\n\n266\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:11.500\nNow, if I click OK and I come back here,\nthis marker has extended.\n\n267\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.330\nAnd I can grab its little handle and come\nout to where it says color correct this.\n\n268\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:21.800\nOr do enough of the distance that that\nwhole area has to be color corrected.\n\n269\n00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.940\nAnd I can do that with the menu.\n\n270\n00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.830\nIf I click on a clip I have\na marker on that clip.\n\n271\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.980\nSo it's now specific to the marker.\n\n272\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.650\nNow when I unhighlight that\nNow it's back to timeline.\n\n273\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.470\n>> I believe you just\nget tired as a corner.\n\n274\n00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.675\n>> Good job.\n\n275\n00:15:39.675 --> 00:15:41.830\n[LAUGH] So now I could say,\n\n276\n00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.420\nyou know, before I send this,\nthis is what I'm going to say, hey,\n\n277\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.860\nI am exporting you the marker's list so\nyou can take a look at it.\n\n278\n00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.720\nAnd here's what's coming your way.\n\n279\n00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.175\nIt's like, okay, great.\n\n280\n00:15:53.175 --> 00:15:54.331\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We go also,\n\n281\n00:15:54.331 --> 00:15:56.341\nnow this is where there's some confusion.\n\n282\n00:15:56.341 --> 00:16:01.140\nWe also have a Final Cut Pro marker XML,\nI'm just mentioning this because people\n\n283\n00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:06.168\nsay, you might still be working with\nsomebody that has the old Final Cut suite.\n\n284\n00:16:06.168 --> 00:16:08.861\nFor now this is the old Final Cut suite,\nnot the newer version.\n\n285\n00:16:08.861 --> 00:16:10.869\nThey are trying to make\nsome changes to this.\n\n286\n00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:13.105\nSo, Adobe, they listen, and\n\n287\n00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:18.446\nthere are some people listening that\nthat might be a good cross platform.\n\n288\n00:16:18.446 --> 00:16:24.360\nI'm going to do just media, as in\nbasically, I wanna turn this into a file.\n\n289\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.270\nClick that, I wanna make sure\nthe timeline is highlighted.\n\n290\n00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:34.260\nOkay, it's gonna pop up and it, sometimes\nfor people, looks a little daunting.\n\n291\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.970\nAnd they're like, nope,\nnope, nope, nope, scared.\n\n292\n00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.010\nDon't be scared, everything's fine.\n\n293\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.260\nLike I said, top to bottom, left to right.\n\n294\n00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.940\nWe're looking at the source,\nwe're looking at the output.\n\n295\n00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.910\nAnd I could say Scale to Fit.\n\n296\n00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.010\nThis is what it's gonna\nlook like in the source,\n\n297\n00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.350\nthis is what it's gonna\nlook like on the output.\n\n298\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.030\nAnd you might be saying, why is it\ngonna look like that on the output?\n\n299\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:02.320\nBecause we haven't really set yet\nwhat the settings are for the output.\n\n300\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.670\nThe output settings for\n\n301\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.540\nthe export do not have to be\nthe same as what it's getting, okay?\n\n302\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:13.950\nSo, down at the bottom, I can choose\nSequence In/Out > the Entire Sequence.\n\n303\n00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.010\nWhat does that mean?\n\n304\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:21.152\nOccasionally, I get paranoid that I\nmight have some media down at the end\n\n305\n00:17:21.152 --> 00:17:26.132\nbeyond my sequence and I have lost it and\nI don't know cuz sometimes people work\n\n306\n00:17:26.132 --> 00:17:31.127\non the opposite end of their sequence and\nthere's a bunch of stuff down there.\n\n307\n00:17:31.127 --> 00:17:34.066\nAnd if they choose Entire Sequence,\nthey're like, wait a minute,\n\n308\n00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:36.210\nwhy is this one-minute\nthing 20 minutes long?\n\n309\n00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.912\nIt's because you are working down\nthere and you have more media there.\n\n310\n00:17:38.912 --> 00:17:41.460\nSo some people put an in and\nan out point at the beginning and\n\n311\n00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.840\nend of their sequence and\nmake sure they choose Sequence In/Out.\n\n312\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.450\nPeople that are used to using\nAfter Effects may choose the work area\n\n313\n00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.780\nif you like to work in the work area,\nor if I just say,\n\n314\n00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.020\nI only wanna send from here and\nI'll grab this little widget right here.\n\n315\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:01.970\nFrom there to there just as a sample,\nokay, that makes it custom.\n\n316\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.017\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ngo back to Sequence In/Out.\n\n317\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.300\nComing back over here, Export Settings.\n\n318\n00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.650\nI can just say match the sequence\nsettings and notice,\n\n319\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:20.000\nsee now it's fine because what it was,\nwas it was set to DV.\n\n320\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.240\nSo this was making it for\nold NTSC digital video.\n\n321\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.530\nAnd it's like, no, that's wrong.\n\n322\n00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:30.040\nI can match the sequence settings or\nI could say,\n\n323\n00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.230\nI want the format to be QuickTime or\n\n324\n00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:39.290\nany of these to start with like an H264,\nsomething like that.\n\n325\n00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.230\nThis is the wrapper.\n\n326\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.690\nThis is where a lot of\npeople misunderstand.\n\n327\n00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.690\nQuickTime is a wrapper.\n\n328\n00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.120\nThat's what wraps it in.\n\n329\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.180\nWhat's inside is what we have to\nchoose later when we go down to video\n\n330\n00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.060\ncodec, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:59.640\nSo that's one of those things like,\nI hope everybody's okay with this,\n\n332\n00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.090\nyou get a drink, there's the glass.\n\n333\n00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.840\nThat's the wrapper file, that's QuickTime.\n\n334\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.960\nQuickTime is the glass.\n\n335\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.470\nWhat's inside is the codec.\n\n336\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.180\nSo, I'm just telling it what\nits glass is right now.\n\n337\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.420\nPreset is currently Custom.\n\n338\n00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.940\nI could choose from any of these.\n\n339\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.689\nAnd I might say, [SOUND] no, [SOUND]\nthat's not really what I'm looking for.\n\n340\n00:19:22.689 --> 00:19:24.460\nSo I'm gonna leave it as Custom.\n\n341\n00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.800\nI could save a preset that I create.\n\n342\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.580\nI could import a preset that I've\nalready created, or I could just say,\n\n343\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.891\ndelete this because it's terrible.\n\n344\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.766\nThis is what throws some people,\nOutput Name.\n\n345\n00:19:36.766 --> 00:19:38.119\nNot only is this the output name.\n\n346\n00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:44.000\nIf I put this over it,\nthis is where the file is going to go.\n\n347\n00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.860\nSo I can click on it,\nnot only choose a new name, but\n\n348\n00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.550\nchoose where I want it to go.\n\n349\n00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:54.304\nSo, in this case, yeah,\nI want it to go in Lessons, but,\n\n350\n00:19:54.304 --> 00:20:00.140\nI actually want it to go on my drive\nin a separate folder called exports.\n\n351\n00:20:01.235 --> 00:20:04.480\nBecause I'm one of these people,\nI need to keep things separate, or\n\n352\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.560\nit drives me absolutely up a wall.\n\n353\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.303\nGarden Sequence 1 is fine,\nor in this case,\n\n354\n00:20:09.303 --> 00:20:11.769\nI'm gonna say Garden Sequence Client.\n\n355\n00:20:14.522 --> 00:20:15.860\nClick Save.\n\n356\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.240\nI do wanna export the audio,\nI do wanna export the video,\n\n357\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.560\nand it's gonna give me a little summary.\n\n358\n00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.160\nIt's gonna go here.\n\n359\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.600\nThe source is this.\n\n360\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.690\nThis is what you've chosen.\n\n361\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.610\nI'm gonna compare the two and\ngo, that's completely wrong.\n\n362\n00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.440\nI need to come down here and\nmake some changes.\n\n363\n00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.890\nSo, come down here, make some changes.\n\n364\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.890\nChanges that I am making\ninclude the following.\n\n365\n00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.860\nVideo Codec, what do I want this to be?\n\n366\n00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.520\nNot DV, I'll click it, there's ProRes.\n\n367\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.780\nSo I could choose ProRes here and\nsay, there's ProRes 422.\n\n368\n00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.472\nAnd then start finding some codec\nsettings about that basic video settings,\n\n369\n00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:55.655\nmake sure the quality's at 100.\n\n370\n00:20:55.655 --> 00:20:57.936\nIt says 720 by 480.\n\n371\n00:20:57.936 --> 00:21:02.849\nI'm gonna go 1280 by 720.\n\n372\n00:21:02.849 --> 00:21:06.455\nIf that gets all wing dinged up,\ntake the chain off.\n\n373\n00:21:06.455 --> 00:21:12.306\nGo 1280 by 720, okay?\n\n374\n00:21:12.306 --> 00:21:13.750\nDo that, scroll down in there.\n\n375\n00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.040\nYep, frame rate progressive.\n\n376\n00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.110\nAll that, that's cool,\nokay, that looks good.\n\n377\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:25.890\nAudio, Audio Codec Uncompressed,\n48 Hertz, yep, 16 bit.\n\n378\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.470\nThere's always the argument,\nshould it be 24 or should it be this?\n\n379\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.900\nOutput channels are currently Stereo.\n\n380\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.120\nI could make it Mono.\n\n381\n00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.500\nSome people ask, can you send a multimix?\n\n382\n00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:41.825\nAs in, can you send 16 channels of audio?\n\n383\n00:21:41.825 --> 00:21:45.590\nIf you set your audio mixer up\nto do 16 separate channels, yes,\n\n384\n00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.653\nyou can do 16 separate channels.\n\n385\n00:21:47.653 --> 00:21:50.849\nCuz some people are like, I need to send\nall of these as separate channels as it's\n\n386\n00:21:50.849 --> 00:21:53.528\nreplaced with English on one,\nSpanish on the other, and all that.\n\n387\n00:21:53.528 --> 00:21:57.340\nYep, you could do that if\nyou've set it up prior to that.\n\n388\n00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.780\nCaptions, if you need to add captions,\n\n389\n00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.040\nseveral different file formats including\nScenarist closed caption, and all that.\n\n390\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.070\nYou can also export.\n\n391\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:12.250\nSo I can put closed captions on this in.\n\n392\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:16.090\nI should come back and talk to you\nabout doing closed captions in this.\n\n393\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.590\nCuz I can do my own closed captions and\n\n394\n00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.490\nthen export them out either\nas its own file or embed it.\n\n395\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.210\n>> Is there a better way to do it, one or\nthe other, or it's just preference?\n\n396\n00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.969\n>> It depends, sometimes I'll do it\nembedded if I'm sending it to YouTube,\n\n397\n00:22:28.969 --> 00:22:32.311\nif I'm sending several to YouTube\nlike in English, in Spanish and\n\n398\n00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:35.433\na couple of other languages,\nI will do them as sidecar files.\n\n399\n00:22:35.433 --> 00:22:37.611\nThe other cool thing is this, Effects.\n\n400\n00:22:37.611 --> 00:22:39.811\nMaybe you forgot something, or\n\n401\n00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:45.990\nmaybe you didn't wanna waste your time\nwith something before somebody sees it.\n\n402\n00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.300\nIt's like, should I add a lut?\n\n403\n00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.290\nI don't know.\n\n404\n00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.700\nLet me add it here and\nsee how they feel about it.\n\n405\n00:22:54.950 --> 00:23:02.048\nThe other thing I could do, I'm gonna come\ndown, and I could add an image overlay.\n\n406\n00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:08.687\nAs in, before I give this to somebody,\nI'm gonna put a little logo,\n\n407\n00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:13.270\nput my little company logo\non here over the top.\n\n408\n00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.290\n>> A little watermark.\n\n409\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.170\n>> A little watermark,\nI'm gonna watermark it.\n\n410\n00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:20.200\nAnd you'll notice it even has opacity,\nso you do that.\n\n411\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:26.078\nA name overlay, I could do that as well\nto, say, for review purposes only.\n\n412\n00:23:26.078 --> 00:23:29.350\nThe cool thing is I don't have\nto do this in the timeline.\n\n413\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.910\nI can now do this on export cuz\nmost people are like, okay,\n\n414\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.300\nnow I have to do it in the timeline,\nso add the adjustment layer into this.\n\n415\n00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.490\nNope, now I can do this just on the export\nand come back clean and do that later.\n\n416\n00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.290\nAlso, I could do a time code overlay.\n\n417\n00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.570\nBoom, so I can do a time code overlay now,\ndo an offset,\n\n418\n00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:51.390\ndo size, do the opacity, kick that up,\ndo it based off the media file.\n\n419\n00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.580\nWhy do I wanna do this?\n\n420\n00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.023\nIf people send changes,\nit's always nice to, hey,\n\n421\n00:23:57.023 --> 00:24:04.147\nat that point where the cactus does this,\nit's like, do you see the little numbers?\n\n422\n00:24:04.147 --> 00:24:05.030\nWhat do you see on the numbers?\n\n423\n00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.060\n>> Read that off [LAUGH].\n\n424\n00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.250\n>> Read that off, okay, that's where I\nneed to make the change, no problem.\n\n425\n00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.976\nThis is a new thing.\n\n426\n00:24:10.976 --> 00:24:11.944\nThis is kinda cool.\n\n427\n00:24:11.944 --> 00:24:14.400\nWelcome to time tuner.\n\n428\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.550\nLike let's say the current duration\nis 39 seconds in one frame.\n\n429\n00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.470\nLet's say it was supposed to be 40.\n\n430\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.170\nI could technically,\nyou don't wanna do this too much.\n\n431\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.410\nThis is a light touch.\n\n432\n00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.470\nBut instead of having to worry about\nit in the timeline, I could say,\n\n433\n00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.997\nlet me turn on the time tuner and\njust take,\n\n434\n00:24:34.997 --> 00:24:38.560\njust go type it in.\n\n435\n00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:44.338\nLet's go 40 seconds, zero.\n\n436\n00:24:44.338 --> 00:24:46.587\nAnd there you go.\n\n437\n00:24:46.587 --> 00:24:49.383\nAnd then I could choose\nis it a duration change?\n\n438\n00:24:49.383 --> 00:24:51.450\nIs it a target duration?\n\n439\n00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.840\nI'm gonna just say it's a duration change.\n\n440\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.720\nAnd so now that's what I've done,\nis I've just tuned it up and\n\n441\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.470\nmade it just a little bit\nlike one of those things.\n\n442\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.080\nIf it was supposed to be 15 minutes and\nyou only did 12,\n\n443\n00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.669\nand you wanna kick it up three minutes.\n\n444\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.690\nI wouldn't recommend that but for\n\n445\n00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.460\nlittle minor changes like\nwe're just a little bit off.\n\n446\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.190\nAlso a video limiter.\n\n447\n00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.980\nIf you're sending out to television it's\nlike you need to do your signal here and\n\n448\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.760\nyou need to do your signal here.\n\n449\n00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.570\nYou could technically do that on\nthe export instead of the timeline.\n\n450\n00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:26.020\nOnce this is all done I click\nexport it's off to the races.\n\n451\n00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.770\nAnd notice I have a couple of things here.\n\n452\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.120\nI could reset the starting time code.\n\n453\n00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.030\nLike somebody says you're supposed\nto start that at an hour.\n\n454\n00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.910\nDo I have to go all the way back in?\n\n455\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:43.080\nNo I could reset it here, and\nit's like good thank you.\n\n456\n00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.220\nI could import it back\nin into the project.\n\n457\n00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.080\nWhy?\n\n458\n00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.550\nIt used to be that if we did something and\n\n459\n00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.710\nwe had a lot of effects on it,\nour processing might not handle it.\n\n460\n00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.900\nOr you had a lot, ton of cuts.\n\n461\n00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.710\nAnd what you'd have to do is we'd say,\nokay, you have to cook that on there.\n\n462\n00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.350\nYou have to put an in point and\nan out point, make that a solid file, and\n\n463\n00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.800\nlay it back into the timeline.\n\n464\n00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.930\nThat means we'd have to export it,\ngo find it, bring it back again.\n\n465\n00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.810\nNow I can just import it\nback into the project.\n\n466\n00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:16.620\nOr if somebody said, hey what kind\nof file did you export to them?\n\n467\n00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.420\nAnd it's already in the project.\n\n468\n00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.030\nThis is what I did, and\nI had the time code, and all this on it.\n\n469\n00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:21.530\nOkay good.\n\n470\n00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.890\nWe also have this thing\ncalled use previews.\n\n471\n00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:32.227\nIt says applicable only for come on come\nback come here please, please come back.\n\n472\n00:26:32.227 --> 00:26:34.690\nOkay go it's not gonna come back.\n\n473\n00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.380\nBasically this,\nI showed you in the sequence settings.\n\n474\n00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:43.180\nHow you can change your preview size\nin comparison to what the sequence is.\n\n475\n00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.490\nInstead of like, 1280x720.\n\n476\n00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:49.299\nWhy would I want to kick the previews\ndown by a half or a quarter.\n\n477\n00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.440\nBecause on the screen it's only this big.\n\n478\n00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.660\nSo it might say okay, when I render out\npreviews, I only want to render it for\n\n479\n00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.350\na screen this big.\n\n480\n00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:05.260\nSo the previews are actually much smaller\nand a lower quality than I want overall.\n\n481\n00:27:08.278 --> 00:27:15.510\nWhen I export basically, I'm saying I\ndon't want to use the previews, okay?\n\n482\n00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.500\nJust render it out new.\n\n483\n00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:23.170\nOr, if I did use the right sized\npreviews and the kind of previews and\n\n484\n00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:23.900\nrenders that I want.\n\n485\n00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.710\nI can say hey, use the previews,\n\n486\n00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.100\ncuz now my export will go faster because\nit doesn't have to render anything out.\n\n487\n00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:34.290\nSo it's a preference thing, just keep\ntrack of what you're doing with that.\n\n488\n00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.990\nAfter that, you can hit Export.\n\n489\n00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:41.700\nQueue is lit up, but\nyou can hit Export and you get one file.\n\n490\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.890\nAnd the reason why you would use queue,\n\n491\n00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:49.770\nis because maybe what you want to do is\nsend this to something like Media Encoder.\n\n492\n00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.820\nAnd if you send it to\nMedia Encoder then I can,\n\n493\n00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.730\nlet me just show it to you real quick.\n\n494\n00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.350\nI'll hit queue.\n\n495\n00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:01.558\nIt's going to export\nthe data to Media Encoder.\n\n496\n00:28:04.721 --> 00:28:10.340\nAnd it's gonna show it to me over here,\nthis is new, the queue is now over here.\n\n497\n00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.200\nAnd I can get all of\nthese presets down here.\n\n498\n00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.370\nSo instead of just doing this one,\nI can technically say,\n\n499\n00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.780\nnot only do I want that,\nI need to do a Vimeo at the same time.\n\n500\n00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.920\nSo, let me do a Vimeo at 720,\nand stack it.\n\n501\n00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:32.710\nAnd I've stacked it there and\nthen I can hit this green button and\n\n502\n00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:36.040\nit will encode both of\nthese at the same time.\n\n503\n00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:42.540\nCool thing about it is,\none of the reasons why I can stack,\n\n504\n00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.670\nI can also make my own presets.\n\n505\n00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.790\nI can create a folder of presets and\njust drag that folder on to there.\n\n506\n00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.750\nThere's many things that you can do in\nMedia Encoder that I should come back and\n\n507\n00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.350\ntalk about it another time.\n\n508\n00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:59.010\nBut if I do this again file, Export Media.\n\n509\n00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.470\nI'm gonna pretend I went through all that.\n\n510\n00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.745\nLook it's all still there.\n\n511\n00:29:01.745 --> 00:29:03.645\n[CROSSTALK] It's amazing,\nisn't that lovely.\n\n512\n00:29:03.645 --> 00:29:04.210\n>> I like it.\n\n513\n00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.340\n>> It remembers it.\n\n514\n00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:11.340\nSo, if I hit Export now\nI have to stop working.\n\n515\n00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.500\nI'm done.\n\n516\n00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:20.820\nIt is encoding and\nI am done using Premiere Pro for now.\n\n517\n00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.810\nI'm absolutely done using Premiere Pro.\n\n518\n00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.670\nOne of the advantages,\nif you want to use Media Encoder,\n\n519\n00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.430\nas soon as you hit queue,\nit's basically sending.\n\n520\n00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.400\nI believe it sends and\nXML data file of your sequence.\n\n521\n00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.659\nTo Media Encoder I know it's in\nthe data file I think it my be XVML,\n\n522\n00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:38.520\nsend it to Media Encoder.\n\n523\n00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:46.690\nI can then go back and while Media Encoder\nis working work on my sequence again.\n\n524\n00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.580\nThe same same sequence,\n\n525\n00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.950\nthe exact same sequence cuz\nthe data has already been sent.\n\n526\n00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.930\nSo if I wanna keep working\nI could do Media Encoder.\n\n527\n00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.615\nIf I want to take a coffee break.\n\n528\n00:29:54.615 --> 00:29:57.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I could tell someone I'm exporting now.\n\n529\n00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:01.680\nSorry, it's gonna be ten,\n20 minutes, so I'm gonna get going.\n\n530\n00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:06.530\nBut if you wanna keep working and\ndo multiple files, you could queue it and\n\n531\n00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:07.930\nsend it to Media Encoder.\n\n532\n00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.200\nSo that's I mean that is it.\n\n533\n00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.690\nThat is we're making it right now.\n\n534\n00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.620\nWe have a solid firewall,\n\n535\n00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.440\nwe're gonna give it to people so you know\nhow to share, you know how to export.\n\n536\n00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.420\nNow you know some of the things\ncapable in Exports so it's like,\n\n537\n00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.960\nhey I don't have to add a look immediately\nI could add it in the Export and\n\n538\n00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.040\nsee if it just works there\nbefore I do all that.\n\n539\n00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.610\nI can send it to somebody and say,\nhey give me this and I can send them this.\n\n540\n00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:33.562\nSo once again just like every single\nstage of this Adobe is really thought\n\n541\n00:30:33.562 --> 00:30:38.768\nabout when you finish there are so many\nthings you need to do when you finish.\n\n542\n00:30:38.768 --> 00:30:41.685\nLet's make it so\nthat you can do all of those things.\n\n543\n00:30:41.685 --> 00:30:45.761\nAnd I really like the fact that they have\nreally thought it through from start to\n\n544\n00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:48.600\nfinish as to all the things\nthat you may need to do.\n\n545\n00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.220\n>> Well there is no doubt about it\nthey've left no stone unturned.\n\n546\n00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.734\nThey put a lot of time and effort into\nthis system because well they want to\n\n547\n00:30:56.734 --> 00:31:01.475\nbe the premier software out there for\nyou to do your video and audio editing.\n\n548\n00:31:01.475 --> 00:31:05.190\nAnd it looks like they have very well\ndone the job they have set out to do.\n\n549\n00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.870\n>> Yeah.\n\n550\n00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.010\n>> That being said, we've also completed a\njob we have set out to do unless you have\n\n551\n00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:13.090\nany other awesome nuggets\nof wisdom to share with us.\n\n552\n00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.330\n>> I do have awesome nuggets of wisdom,\nbut\n\n553\n00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.330\nI think you've got enough\nnuggets right now.\n\n554\n00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.030\n>> Eat what's on your plate.\n\n555\n00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.070\n>> Eat what's on your plate and\nthen we'll try and\n\n556\n00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.780\ncome back another time and\nfill that plate up again.\n\n557\n00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.060\n>> Well Jim, I look forward\nto it this was a lot of fun.\n\n558\n00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.020\n>> That'd be great.\n\n559\n00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.300\n>> Really enjoyed having you\nhere this was a ton of fun.\n\n560\n00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.750\nHopefully you guys enjoyed\nit as much as we did.\n\n561\n00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.860\nIt was so much fun and\nyou got a lot out of it.\n\n562\n00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.300\nYou can now run to your computers and\nstart filming things.\n\n563\n00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.275\nThrow them in, create sequences.\n\n564\n00:31:40.275 --> 00:31:40.845\nHave a lot of fun.\n\n565\n00:31:40.845 --> 00:31:45.915\nMake transitions and rolling titles and\nstuff like that's a lot of fun.\n\n566\n00:31:45.915 --> 00:31:48.625\nStuff I never knew I was\ngoing to know in my life.\n\n567\n00:31:48.625 --> 00:31:49.575\nJim, thanks again.\n\n568\n00:31:49.575 --> 00:31:50.135\n>> Thank you Dan.\n\n569\n00:31:50.135 --> 00:31:53.325\n>> We appreciate you guys for\nwatching, but it is time to sign off.\n\n570\n00:31:53.325 -->
