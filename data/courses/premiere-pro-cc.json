another great\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.550\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.290\nin today's episode we are kicking\noff our Premiere Pro series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.060\nJoining us in the studio to lend\nhis expertise on that very topic\n\n7\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.500\nis our good friend, Mr. James Biddle.\n\n8\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.010\nJames, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.980\nWe're so glad to have you today.\n\n10\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.440\nHow's it going?\n>> Dan, it's great to be here,\n\n11\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.138\nbut\n>> I like you.\n\n12\n00:00:32.138 --> 00:00:34.463\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I like Adobe Premiere,\n\n13\n00:00:34.463 --> 00:00:37.116\neven more [CROSSTALK] I’m\njust gonna go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:41.780\nget started and I wanna talk to everybody\nabout just opening up Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\n15\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.390\nAnd getting into the settings.\n\n16\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.370\nAdobe does a really good\njob of setting this up so\n\n17\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.910\nyou have the ability to just get started\nbut you might want to change some stuff.\n\n18\n00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.630\nAnd they're also very good\nat letting you personalize.\n\n19\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.130\nThe thing I like to do is\nlook at the pretty pictures.\n\n20\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.380\nI love that adobe puts these great\npictures on here to sort of inspire\n\n21\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.600\nInspire to get into editing.\n\n22\n00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.820\nAll right.\nSo here's our opening screen.\n\n23\n00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.630\nWhenever you open any of the suite,\n\n24\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.700\nyou get a screen like this to\nask you what do you want to do?\n\n25\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.610\nAnd it's more than just open a project or\nstart a new project.\n\n26\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.728\nNotice I can get into recent projects,\n\n27\n00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:19.150\nit will say,\nyour recent work will appear here.\n\n28\n00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.802\nSo if you've already been\nworking on something,\n\n29\n00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:22.030\nit just appears right there for you.\n\n30\n00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.570\nYou get to started.\n\n31\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.850\nI can ask a quick question especially\nif there have been any updates.\n\n32\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.630\nWe all know now with a creative Cloud,\nyou get a lot of updates.\n\n33\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.560\nYou have missed something, so you can\njump right in and found out what was new.\n\n34\n00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.340\nI can check on my Cloud account.\n\n35\n00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.970\nBut let me quit rambling.\n\n36\n00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.690\nLet's just get started.\n\n37\n00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.750\nI'm gonna start a new project.\n\n38\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.530\nOkay.\n\n39\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.620\nSo anytime you get lost in\nany of the panels, okay?\n\n40\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.880\nI'm calling this big\nguy right here a panel.\n\n41\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.773\nAnytime you get lost in a panel,\ngo right to the top gray bar, and\n\n42\n00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:52.336\nit will tell you what's going on.\n\n43\n00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:53.610\nA new project.\n\n44\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.420\nThat's fairly simple,\ncoming down, we want to name it.\n\n45\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.270\nPlease don't leave it untitled.\n\n46\n00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.610\nIf you've seen me here,\ndo it for me, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.850\nName your pets.\n\n48\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.890\nCat, dog, you know a great moniker,\nbut you know, Fluffy.\n\n49\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.030\nSomething like that.\n\n50\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.540\nAnd make it something\nthat you can remember and\n\n51\n00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.740\nmaybe it's a little specific\nto what you're doing.\n\n52\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.060\nSo untitled number 927 is so\nfairly non descriptive.\n\n53\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.090\nIt's not gonna be very helpful.\n\n54\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.370\n>> It's non descriptive,\nbut I've seen untitled 927.\n\n55\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.280\nIt looks a lot like 928.\n\n56\n00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.160\nSo, here we go.\n\n57\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.690\nI'm just gonna call this IT PRO TV.\n\n58\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.440\nGive it a little underscore, and\njust say, premier lesson, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.400\nAnd that way,\nI know exactly what's going on.\n\n60\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.800\nNow where's it gonna go?\n\n61\n00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.330\nAdobe does a great job with defaults,\nagain, so\n\n62\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.770\nyou don't have to think about certain\nthings, but you may want to change it.\n\n63\n00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.850\nRight now, I really don't want it going to\nthis hard drive under this default area,\n\n64\n00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.600\nso I will choose browse, and\nI will say I want to put it on this\n\n65\n00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.630\nExternal drive that I brought, and\njust call it Lessons, all right?\n\n66\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.760\nThat way, I'm gonna remember it, and\nI have it on my own private drive.\n\n67\n00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.870\nOnce we get down here, these are some\nsettings that you may wanna explore later\n\n68\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.120\nabout video rendering and playback.\n\n69\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.360\nAdobe gives you options so that you can\nuse the graphics processing card for\n\n70\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.390\na lot of your previews and depending on\nyour type of computer and your graphics\n\n71\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.770\ncard you may be able to, like,\nwe like to say, like scream through this.\n\n72\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.740\nSo we have one here and\nwe'll be able to use it today.\n\n73\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.830\nThese three,\nyou can change a lot of this at any time.\n\n74\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.130\nIf you don't do it now, Adobe always\noffers you the opportunity to do it later.\n\n75\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.210\nSo when I'm working with video, I'll be\nable to do time code or I can see feet and\n\n76\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.550\nframes or just frames depending\non what I'm working on.\n\n77\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.480\nAudio, usually display format.\n\n78\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.670\nAudio samples is fine.\n\n79\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.659\nIf you're somebody that's really into\nbeats, you might want to do milliseconds.\n\n80\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.160\nAlso the capture format.\n\n81\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.790\nCapture is specifically when you\ncome from one medium to another.\n\n82\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.310\nAnd now you may have worked with\ntape before, Dan, I don't know.\n\n83\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.760\nBut if you do tape and\n\n84\n00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.090\ncome in, that's where this capture\npreset can be very, very important.\n\n85\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.930\nIf you're just coming out of\ncard-based media, you're coming off and\n\n86\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.770\ndrive, this really doesn't\nmatter in the beginning.\n\n87\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.800\nAlso, you can display the project item\nname and label color for all instances.\n\n88\n00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.470\nAnd notice when I do that,\nit gives me a little,\n\n89\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.120\nit gives me a little heads up to say,\nif this item is checked, names and\n\n90\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.740\nlabel colors will match\nthe corresponding project item.\n\n91\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.210\nThat may sound a little over descriptive.\n\n92\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.640\nAdobe gives you that over description\nbecause then when you actually do this,\n\n93\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.510\nyou can say now I know what they mean.\n\n94\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.600\nScratch Disks.\n\n95\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.480\nHere's what they're saying is\nif you are capturing items,\n\n96\n00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.160\nyou're coming off of a tape or\nmaybe you're doing film.\n\n97\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.240\nCongratulations if you are.\n\n98\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.860\nWhere will the files be located?\n\n99\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.220\nIn most cases,\n\n100\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.882\ncaptured video, not going to matter cuz\nyou're probably using card based media.\n\n101\n00:04:56.882 --> 00:05:00.520\nIf you're coming off of tapes or\nfilms, you're gonna have to set this.\n\n102\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.970\nRight now it's gonna default to all\nthese default, same as project.\n\n103\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.110\nSo where that project file is located, and\n\n104\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.720\nit tells me right here,\nvolumes, my drive, and lessons.\n\n105\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.650\nEverything's going to go right there.\n\n106\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.640\nFor today, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nleave that for these lessons.\n\n107\n00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.680\nI can route it to anywhere I want to.\n\n108\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.690\nI can route it to another drive,\nI've known people who have tried,\n\n109\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.600\nyou know I'm going to do it to Dropbox at\nthe same time, or something like that.\n\n110\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.420\nAnd you know it works just well.\n\n111\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.100\nYou can experiment with this.\n\n112\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.890\nAs long as you know where it was,\nyou can retrieve it.\n\n113\n00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.958\nThe only one that I generally\nset in here is captured audio.\n\n114\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:44.280\nNow I'm be pulling off a tape or anything\nlike that and I have some audio on a card.\n\n115\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.110\nThe reason I do this, is there is\na nice voice over feature in here,\n\n116\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.690\nwhere I can read through my laptop or\n\n117\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.070\nit's a little board unto a microphone and\nI'll get an audio file.\n\n118\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.540\nThe way that Adobe premier\nknows how to place that file\n\n119\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.745\nis by using this captured audio setting.\n\n120\n00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:05.251\nI can leave it same as project, and\nit will know exactly where it is or\n\n121\n00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:08.995\nmaybe a special audio\nfolder that I wanna design.\n\n122\n00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:11.925\nIf not, I'm just gonna leave\neverything where it is.\n\n123\n00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:17.360\nThen the one that I usually like to change\na lot, is called project auto save, what\n\n124\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.070\nthis means is, I'm about to create that\nlittle file, that little project file.\n\n125\n00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.580\nI double-click it, it opens and I get it.\n\n126\n00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.130\n>> Magic.\n\n127\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.654\n>> Magic.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.520\n>> Something might happen,\n\n129\n00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.330\nit might explode,\nsometimes things get corrupt.\n\n130\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.780\nSo Adobe offers me this great option\nto say hey, if you forgot to save or\n\n131\n00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.660\nyou're not saving enough,\nat a certain period in time,\n\n132\n00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.950\nwe will create an autosaved backup for\nyou.\n\n133\n00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.110\nAnd generally, you can do it like\nevery five minutes, every ten minutes,\n\n134\n00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.970\nevery two hours, whatever you want.\n\n135\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.560\nAnd you can put it right next to\nwhere your projects are located.\n\n136\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.685\nOr like I do,\nI send it to an to another drive.\n\n137\n00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:01.445\nSo that way, if the project and\nthe autosave are on the same drive and\n\n138\n00:07:01.445 --> 00:07:04.475\nsomething goes kablooie,\nI just lost all my autosaves.\n\n139\n00:07:04.475 --> 00:07:07.395\n>> So the good people at Adobe have\nrealized the fact that we, as humans,\n\n140\n00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:12.187\naren't really great about saving our\nwork before Something critical occurs.\n\n141\n00:07:12.187 --> 00:07:14.907\n>> Or even better,\nbecause Adobe is so exciting and\n\n142\n00:07:14.907 --> 00:07:19.017\nyou just wanna edit, why not just\nhave an automated process to do it?\n\n143\n00:07:19.017 --> 00:07:23.591\nSo I'm thinking about [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\nI'll think about the story I'm telling.\n\n144\n00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:27.391\nInstead of the saving, and\nit's like okay, that's great.\n\n145\n00:07:27.391 --> 00:07:31.053\nI love that, so\nI will send that to something else,\n\n146\n00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:34.023\nalso it's one of those things,\nmaybe I'm working and working and working,\n\n147\n00:07:34.023 --> 00:07:39.130\nand then I realize, okay,\nthis thing I just made Is terrible.\n\n148\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.140\nBut two weeks ago,\nI made this thing that was amazing and\n\n149\n00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.780\nif I go back in the autosaves,\nI can get it from there.\n\n150\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.998\nIt's like it's brilliant.\n\n151\n00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:49.165\n>> That's nice.\n>> Love it and it's like,\n\n152\n00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:50.630\nokay here's some more for two weeks or so,\n\n153\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.314\neven better and\nI'll start working from there.\n\n154\n00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:53.058\nOkay?\n\n155\n00:07:53.058 --> 00:07:57.098\nYou also have the ability to do\nCreative Cloud library downloads.\n\n156\n00:07:57.098 --> 00:07:59.117\nAnd I'm gonna show you\nsome of those later,\n\n157\n00:07:59.117 --> 00:08:03.240\ncuz I made a couple in a side program\nthat's for free, that I did on my phone.\n\n158\n00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.690\nAnd I can load that library\ninto Adobe Premier.\n\n159\n00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.370\nSo, once I have this done,\nall I have to do is click OK.\n\n160\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.580\nAnd then we get the exciting part.\n\n161\n00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.050\nWe get the interface.\n\n162\n00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.004\nAnd it's like, yes, and there's all\nthe windows I can get all my stuff in.\n\n163\n00:08:16.004 --> 00:08:17.720\nBut then it's like I\nbetter check some stuff.\n\n164\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.910\nAnd what that checking stuff is,\nI come up to the top menu bar and\n\n165\n00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.750\nI go to Premier Pro > CC and\nI go to Preferences.\n\n166\n00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.419\nYou are gonna see there are a lot of them.\n\n167\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.380\nNow, Adobe is a wonderful dense program,\nand I have been using it for\n\n168\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.190\na very long time.\n\n169\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.250\nAnd, technically,\nI am a certified expert instructor.\n\n170\n00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.640\nBut there are some things in\nthis that I have never used\n\n171\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.730\nbecause they are very specialized for\ncertain types of work.\n\n172\n00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.562\nI mean, I've tried them,\nI've demoed them and I've used them, but\n\n173\n00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:50.270\nI don't use them on daily basis.\n\n174\n00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.403\nThat's why there are a lot of settings.\n\n175\n00:08:52.403 --> 00:08:58.200\nSome of them you will set, some of them\nyou will only look at at a specific time.\n\n176\n00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.170\nThe most important one is the top one.\n\n177\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.760\nCome here,\nlet's get to the right one there.\n\n178\n00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.220\nThank you Biddle.\n\n179\n00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.670\nWe're gonna go right to general, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.250\nAnd this is the most important\none that we are going to look at.\n\n181\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.140\nNow [BLANK AUDIO] Starting at the top and\nworking our way to the bottom.\n\n182\n00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.960\nI often tell people, if you get lost, top\nto bottom left to right, front to back.\n\n183\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.420\nJust like like you read a book, just\ngo at this like you're reading a book.\n\n184\n00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.580\nTop to bottom, left to right,\nfront to back.\n\n185\n00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.670\nSo, starting at the top of the general\narea, starting in the left,\n\n186\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.470\nI choose general.\n\n187\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.520\nGoing, and this is interesting,\nDan, I wore the blue shirt today\n\n188\n00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.740\nbecause blue is a very important\ncolor in the Adobe interface.\n\n189\n00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.430\n>> I did not know that.\n\n190\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.850\n>> It highlights what you're working with,\nand\n\n191\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:48.450\noccasionally if you see things\nin blue you can change that.\n\n192\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.110\nOkay?\n\n193\n00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.250\nSo that's very, very important.\n\n194\n00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.360\nSo start, it's like, at start up,\nshow the start screen.\n\n195\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.330\nThat's the thing that I just\nwalked everybody through.\n\n196\n00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.950\nIf you're one of those folks that wants\nto just click on the premier icon,\n\n197\n00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:11.390\nI just wanna get working, I can say just\nopen my most recent and go straight to it.\n\n198\n00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.950\nThe thing that's gonna be upsetting\nabout some of these settings\n\n199\n00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:23.820\nis that these will take place\nafter you have activated them.\n\n200\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.990\nSo let's take, for example,\nwhen opening a project,\n\n201\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:30.158\nshow the opening dialogue,\nshow the start screen.\n\n202\n00:10:30.158 --> 00:10:33.330\nThese are just, Adobe has defaulted it\nto what they think is the most common.\n\n203\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.150\nAnd in most cases, it is the most\ncommon thing that you're gonna do.\n\n204\n00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.260\nBut you can change them.\n\n205\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.320\nVideo transition duration.\n\n206\n00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.630\nRight now, if I create dissolves or\n\n207\n00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.770\nany other transition,\nit's going to be 30 frames.\n\n208\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.260\nNice thing is,\nI can change that to seconds.\n\n209\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.030\nAnd say I would like it to be\na certain amount of seconds,\n\n210\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.560\nlike I want all of them to\nbe three seconds in length.\n\n211\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.140\nWhy?\nI have no idea.\n\n212\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.620\nSo, I'll go back to frames and\njust say, yeah, 30 frames.\n\n213\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.700\nI can do that,\nthe same thing with audio transitions.\n\n214\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.700\nI can say frames,\nmake that 30 frames or change it.\n\n215\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.750\nSometimes I like to do really\nshort audio transitions, so\n\n216\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.424\nI'll make that a five, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:12.424 --> 00:11:14.060\nNow, what this does not do.\n\n218\n00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.130\nSo, Dan, let's say I've already\ncreated a sequence, and\n\n219\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:23.400\nI have all of these nice little audio\ntransitions, and they're all 30 frames.\n\n220\n00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.170\nAnd I say, I go back, and it's like\nI wanted those to be five frames,\n\n221\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.240\nand I change it.\n\n222\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.100\nIt changes nothing that I've already done.\n\n223\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.830\nThis will change what\nI'm going to do next.\n\n224\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.180\n>> So it won't take effect until you-\n>> Won't take effect.\n\n225\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.670\n>> Anything you've done before,\nthat's all still gonna be the same?\n\n226\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.221\n>> Right,\nit's all still gonna be the same.\n\n227\n00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:42.183\nAnd that,\nI know some people find that frustrating.\n\n228\n00:11:42.183 --> 00:11:45.455\nBut it's, then all I have to do is just go\nget those out and put the new [INAUDIBLE].\n\n229\n00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:45.955\n>> Well, I mean,\n\n230\n00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.492\nit makes sense if you think about it\nbecause Adobe's not assuming that you want\n\n231\n00:11:48.492 --> 00:11:49.960\nto change everything you've already done.\n\n232\n00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.079\nThey assume that now that\nyou've changed a setting,\n\n233\n00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.940\nyou wanna change it from here on out.\n\n234\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.590\n>> Exactly.\n\n235\n00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:59.340\nAdobe wants you, their whole philosophy\nis, they want you to create the story,\n\n236\n00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.380\nthey wanna help you create the story.\n\n237\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.900\nAnd they feel like if they did that,\nthey'd be taking over the story.\n\n238\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.054\nSo, that's, I mean,\nthat's part of the psychology, and\n\n239\n00:12:08.054 --> 00:12:09.460\nthat's why I like working with this.\n\n240\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.270\nStill image default duration.\n\n241\n00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.270\nThis is if you wanna do this really cool\nthing like you bring in still photos and\n\n242\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.440\nthen you wanna animate them, and\nmake them fly and blow them up.\n\n243\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.640\nRight now, every still image that I\nbring up will be five seconds long.\n\n244\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:29.400\nI can extend that to, let's say,\nI want them to be 360 seconds.\n\n245\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.550\nYeah, I mean, I can make the still images\nvery, very long so I can work with them.\n\n246\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.897\nThese are where you start getting\ninto some real preference things,\n\n247\n00:12:38.897 --> 00:12:40.487\nlike timeline, playback, auto scrolling.\n\n248\n00:12:40.487 --> 00:12:45.420\nI'm gonna go over later, cuz until you\nsee it, it doesn't make any sense.\n\n249\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.010\nSame thing with vertical mouse scrolling.\n\n250\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.750\nYou might just find that there are certain\nthings that you do, that it's like\n\n251\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.030\nI wanna be able to do this, and\nyou can make it happen here.\n\n252\n00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.430\nWhich is nice, it's really nice\nthat you can customize the system\n\n253\n00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.810\nas much as you want, so that way,\nyou're focusing on the story.\n\n254\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:05.630\nAll right.\n\n255\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:10.470\nSet focus on the timeline when\nperforming in certain overwrite edits.\n\n256\n00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.518\nThat is something that we're gonna, once\nwe start editing that you're gonna wanna\n\n257\n00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:16.890\nsee cuz this can be frustrating for\npeople.\n\n258\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.780\nSome people like it one way,\nsome people like it the other.\n\n259\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.905\nBasically, this is just\nall general setting of\n\n260\n00:13:23.905 --> 00:13:27.365\nhow to make this thing work best for you.\n\n261\n00:13:27.365 --> 00:13:30.335\nAnd general is the best way to start.\n\n262\n00:13:30.335 --> 00:13:33.915\nThe one that I really\nwant to focus on that,\n\n263\n00:13:33.915 --> 00:13:37.410\nonce I bring in some still photos\nthat I've shot, that you really,\n\n264\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.500\nreally wanna take a look at is this one\ncalled default scale to frame size.\n\n265\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.140\nIn most cases, you want this off\nbecause what you're looking to do,\n\n266\n00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.290\nand I took some pictures\nwith a Canon 5D Mark III.\n\n267\n00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.100\n>> That's a nice camera.\n\n268\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.500\n>> Yeah, it's very nice and it's not mine.\n\n269\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.230\nIt's my friend's.\n\n270\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.930\nHe let me borrow it,\nwith a really nice lens.\n\n271\n00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:04.180\nAnd this project is going to be,\nI'm just gonna try and do this.\n\n272\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.000\nIt's gonna be like 1080.\n\n273\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.940\nOkay, it's gonna be 1920 by 1080.\n\n274\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:12.100\nThese pictures are going to be\nlike huge compared to that.\n\n275\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:17.680\nIf I say default scale to frame\nsize is off, when I bring\n\n276\n00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.610\nin those images, they're not going to\ndefault size down to 1920 by 1080,\n\n277\n00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:27.380\nthey're gonna stay this size and that way\nI can animate them, cuz they're oversized.\n\n278\n00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.350\nOkay, they're gonna oversize that way.\n\n279\n00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.520\nIf I turn it on,\neverything's gonna get reduced.\n\n280\n00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.930\nAnd then,\nI'm not gonna have the resolution,\n\n281\n00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.760\nI'm not gonna be able to\nplay around with that.\n\n282\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.600\nThat is why it is automatically off.\n\n283\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.580\nAnd that is why, in most cases,\nyou wanna leave it automatically off.\n\n284\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.350\nCuz you took these giant pictures.\n\n285\n00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.070\nWhy don't you just get in there and\nanimate them, okay?\n\n286\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.425\nSo, that's about all I'm gonna\ndo in the General section.\n\n287\n00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:52.195\nAppearance.\n\n288\n00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:53.695\nThis one is hard, okay?\n\n289\n00:14:53.695 --> 00:14:57.065\nThis is a rough one.\n\n290\n00:14:57.065 --> 00:14:58.175\nOkay, that's better.\n\n291\n00:14:58.175 --> 00:15:02.460\nThis is basically, do I want my\ninterface brighter, do I want it darker.\n\n292\n00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.020\nI can change the highlight\ncolor a little bit,\n\n293\n00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.900\nI can make the kind of darker\n[INAUDIBLE] interactive controls.\n\n294\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:15.150\nIt's really what you want and\nwhat you like in terms of how your user\n\n295\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.648\ninterface appears in terms of light dark-\n>> Gives you a personalization-\n\n296\n00:15:18.648 --> 00:15:20.690\n>> Give you a little personalization,\n\n297\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.060\ndon't go too wacky.\n\n298\n00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.480\nI've seen some really strange things.\n\n299\n00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:30.661\nIf it's so\nbizarre that your head hurts, okay?\n\n300\n00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:32.655\nI mean, it's like, okay?\n\n301\n00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:33.210\nAudio.\n\n302\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:37.280\nA lot of this can be fun to play around\nwith, but I will give you this right now.\n\n303\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.560\nMost of what is set in here\nis pretty much what you want.\n\n304\n00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.221\nThe thing that people want\nto know initially is what is\n\n305\n00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:50.220\nmute input during timeline recording?\n\n306\n00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.326\nWhat is automatic audio\nwave form generation?\n\n307\n00:15:53.326 --> 00:15:54.905\nAnd what is this default audio track?\n\n308\n00:15:54.905 --> 00:15:57.890\nThis is the one that people\nare most concerned with.\n\n309\n00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.604\nSo Mute input during\ntimeline recording means,\n\n310\n00:16:00.604 --> 00:16:06.050\nremember I mentioned that I could do a\nvoiceover, I could read into a microphone.\n\n311\n00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:10.670\nIf this is off,\nwhatever audio might be in the timeline,\n\n312\n00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.115\nlike music or another person speaking,\nI can hear In the headphones or\n\n313\n00:16:15.115 --> 00:16:18.845\nthrough the computer speakers while\nI'm trying to do this voiceover.\n\n314\n00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:21.915\nSo I might say, no, I don't want to hear\nany of that or I'm gonna flub it up, and\n\n315\n00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:24.305\nI had to do it 19 times and\nI'm gonna have all these terrible files.\n\n316\n00:16:24.305 --> 00:16:25.995\nSo you can turn that off.\n\n317\n00:16:25.995 --> 00:16:31.330\nAutomatic audio waveform generation, I'm\nsure if you've gotten into this before,\n\n318\n00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.230\nyou know that there's little audio\nwave forms on the tracks, okay.\n\n319\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.730\nYou have the ability to turn it off,\nin a sense.\n\n320\n00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.740\nWhy, you don't have enough RAM, okay,\nyou're working on a low computer, and\n\n321\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.630\nyou don't want them generated\nuntil you absolutely need them.\n\n322\n00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.850\n>> So this is all about\nreclaiming some system resources-\n\n323\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:48.520\n>> Saving some space.\n\n324\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.968\nSaving some space for yourself,\nalso default audio tracks.\n\n325\n00:16:52.968 --> 00:16:56.968\nWhen we get into audio this\nis gonna start making sense,\n\n326\n00:16:56.968 --> 00:17:01.136\nbecause a lot of what people\nkind of get confused with, and\n\n327\n00:17:01.136 --> 00:17:06.600\nI don't really blame you, in that Adobe,\nyou can have two audios in a clip.\n\n328\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.333\nBut then when you put it in a timeline,\nyou get one track, and\n\n329\n00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:13.094\nthat kind of throws people.\n\n330\n00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:15.120\nAnd I'm gonna go through\nthe Adobe psychology.\n\n331\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.020\nOnce you get it down,\nit's actually really nice\n\n332\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.870\nto be able to just work in\nsingle tracks but dual sources.\n\n333\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.860\nBut this gives you a chance to change that\nif you don't like, if you want mono media\n\n334\n00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:33.320\nto actually come in as mono and not\nnecessarily use the file's protocol, okay.\n\n335\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.840\nSo you get a chance to do that as well.\n\n336\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.501\nCouple of things, the AutoSave.\n\n337\n00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:43.122\nAll right, this is where I’m saying\nautomatically do it every 15 minutes, no,\n\n338\n00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:44.600\ndo it every five.\n\n339\n00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.420\nAnd let me see what the maximum is.\n\n340\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.790\nI always like playing around with\nhow many are they gonna give me.\n\n341\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.089\nI just did something that\nreally frustrates people and\n\n342\n00:17:53.089 --> 00:17:54.507\nI wanted to demonstrate this.\n\n343\n00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:58.007\nAs soon as I entered a number, and\n\n344\n00:17:58.007 --> 00:18:03.450\ndid return,\nit clicked out of the settings.\n\n345\n00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.940\nThis happens to me all the time,\nokay, don't worry about this, okay.\n\n346\n00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.580\nCan I do 999 and just click out?\n\n347\n00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:14.130\nYes, I can have 999 projects,\nlet's see if I can go higher.\n\n348\n00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.405\nThis is the funny,\nthis is the fun part about Adobe,\n\n349\n00:18:16.405 --> 00:18:17.922\nis what are they allowing me to do?\n\n350\n00:18:17.922 --> 00:18:18.674\nI'm going higher.\n\n351\n00:18:18.674 --> 00:18:19.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is great.\n\n352\n00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.516\nSo what this means is that on\nthe auto-saves, as soon as I hit 1,000\n\n353\n00:18:23.516 --> 00:18:28.160\nauto-saves and I go to 1,001,\nthe oldest one then gets removed.\n\n354\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.110\n>> So first in, first out?\n\n355\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.330\n>> First in, first out.\n\n356\n00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.910\nSo, I could say I want so\nmany that the first in,\n\n357\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.360\nfirst out isn't gonna take effect\nuntil I have 1,000 backups.\n\n358\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.204\n>> Gonna run out of storage space.\n\n359\n00:18:38.204 --> 00:18:39.705\n[LAUGH]\n>> Gonna run out of storage space.\n\n360\n00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:42.070\n[LAUGH] The other thing I can also do,\noops, sorry about that.\n\n361\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.810\nI love playing with this.\n\n362\n00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.540\nI can save the backup to\nmy Creative Cloud account.\n\n363\n00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.470\nOkay, save it to my Creative Cloud\naccount as well which is-\n\n364\n00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.116\n>> It's doing it in conjunction with\n\n365\n00:18:53.116 --> 00:18:55.100\nthe save to the local source?\n\n366\n00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.460\n>> So, I'll demonstrate that.\n\n367\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.399\nI will demonstrate that\nas we start working.\n\n368\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.550\nControl Surface is another one.\n\n369\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:06.209\nIf you want to,\na lot of people like really nice\n\n370\n00:19:06.209 --> 00:19:10.761\ncolor control services or\nan audio service.\n\n371\n00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:12.167\nYou can add that here.\n\n372\n00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:16.150\nYou can also do some Device Controls\nif you're working with the tape deck.\n\n373\n00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.160\nSo, if your deck sub type you\ncould control it from here.\n\n374\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.930\nLabels, this is an interesting one.\n\n375\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.410\nEverything gets a label, so if I go\ndown the Label Defaults, if it's a bin,\n\n376\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.810\nit's mango,\nif it's a sequence it's forest.\n\n377\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.300\nI have to kinda go through this, people,\n\n378\n00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.910\nthis is fun cuz you can\ncolor code everything.\n\n379\n00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.330\nSometimes I like color codes.\n\n380\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.460\nI have a friend, he doesn't, so\nhe just changes all of these to white or\n\n381\n00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.940\nanother innocuous color which is fine,\nwhich you can do.\n\n382\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.760\nThe thing that it does not do,\nthat kinda throws people.\n\n383\n00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.560\nLet's say I go and I change this color and\nI just change it to green.\n\n384\n00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:57.955\nIt still says violet, so it's not going to\nchange it to the name of the actual color.\n\n385\n00:19:57.955 --> 00:20:00.010\n[LAUGH] So that's really\na label on the left-hand side.\n\n386\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.950\n>> It's just a label on the left-hand side\nand people get really upset about that.\n\n387\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.390\nThey're like, wait a minute, it's not\nchanged, well, it's not supposed to.\n\n388\n00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.910\nSo the label defaults are, the bin is\nmango, the sequences probably can change,\n\n389\n00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:16.040\nand I can say, no, I want bins to be\nrose The thing that they do that I think\n\n390\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.890\nis very nice, especially when you get your\nsequence into the timeline, your video and\n\n391\n00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.740\nyour audio are different colors.\n\n392\n00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.277\nSo that way, occasionally when\nyou look at a sequence and\n\n393\n00:20:27.277 --> 00:20:30.526\nyou just see all the same color, you're-\n>> What's what?\n\n394\n00:20:30.526 --> 00:20:31.162\n>> What's what?\n\n395\n00:20:31.162 --> 00:20:32.295\nIt's like, colors.\n\n396\n00:20:32.295 --> 00:20:33.480\nColors work, so I can do that.\n\n397\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.740\nMedia, the only thing I really\nwant to cover in this one,\n\n398\n00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.280\nif people wanna dig around into it later,\nthey can.\n\n399\n00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.700\nOccasionally you have a thing called\na cache, and what this means is\n\n400\n00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.350\nyou might open up Premier and\ndown in the little right-hand portion\n\n401\n00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.780\nof the user interface, there's this\nlittle narrow line that just keeps going.\n\n402\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.450\nIt's building.\n\n403\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.600\nYou may have moved a drive somewhere or\nyou may have erased something.\n\n404\n00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.162\nAnd what it's doing is it's\nrebuilding waveforms or\n\n405\n00:21:07.162 --> 00:21:11.841\nit's rebuilding some files that\nare needed for things like H264.\n\n406\n00:21:11.841 --> 00:21:14.936\nThey're called cache files.\n\n407\n00:21:14.936 --> 00:21:20.090\nOccasionally these build up and\nyou might have to clean them.\n\n408\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.410\nAnd you just say clean them out and\nstart fresh.\n\n409\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.310\nSo that's what you wanna do.\n\n410\n00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.060\nNow you wanna make sure that if\nyou're doing this with drives,\n\n411\n00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.090\nyou want the drive attached cuz it's\nonly gonna throw away the cache\n\n412\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.200\nfiles that you don't need any more.\n\n413\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.525\nIf the drive's not attached, it's going\nto throw away all the cache files,\n\n414\n00:21:38.525 --> 00:21:40.925\nwhich is fine,\nit just has to rebuild them.\n\n415\n00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:44.205\nIt just has to rebuild everything,\nwhich just can be time consuming.\n\n416\n00:21:44.205 --> 00:21:46.005\nOkay, that's just a timing issue.\n\n417\n00:21:47.895 --> 00:21:52.880\nThe next one is sync settings, cuz since\neverybody's using the Creative Cloud now,\n\n418\n00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.190\nhow do you want to sync\nyour Creative Cloud?\n\n419\n00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.970\nWhich is a nice setting instead of\njust saying we sync it this way.\n\n420\n00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.440\nThat's not what Adobe likes to do.\n\n421\n00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.120\nAdobe likes to say no,\nhow do you want to do this?\n\n422\n00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.070\nAnd you can say, I have the preferences,\nthe settings, the workspace layouts, and\n\n423\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.700\nthe keyboard shortcuts get saved.\n\n424\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.770\nThose go to my Creative Cloud account.\n\n425\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.700\nAnd then when syncing, ask my preference.\n\n426\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.540\nDo I always wanna upload,\ndo I always wanna download settings?\n\n427\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.280\nOr do I wanna say automatically clear\nthe settings on the application quit?\n\n428\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.340\nWhich means if I'm on someone else's\ncomputer and my Creative Cloud's\n\n429\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.130\non there and it's like I'm gonna leave,\nI want my stuff cleared off of it.\n\n430\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.370\nIt's not because I don't like them,\n\n431\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.420\nbut they're probably going to\nsay why is this stuff on here?\n\n432\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.393\nThat's very weird of you\nto leave your stuff behind.\n\n433\n00:22:38.393 --> 00:22:39.478\n>> Yeah.\n\n434\n00:22:39.478 --> 00:22:41.580\n>> Which we are all\nlearning with the Internet.\n\n435\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:46.310\nSo, I have made a lot of these settings.\n\n436\n00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.580\nI'm happy now, now what?\n\n437\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.410\nNow, I'm gonna get in and I'm gonna\nbring some media in this actual thing.\n\n438\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.546\nAnd I think you and I are gonna end up\ndoing that next time where we actually\n\n439\n00:22:57.546 --> 00:23:00.737\nbring in some media and play around\nwith this interface because you may say\n\n440\n00:23:00.737 --> 00:23:02.770\nI don't, it's just moving everywhere.\n\n441\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.550\nHow do I make it look like something\nthat I want to use instead of this?\n\n442\n00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:10.290\n>> Yeah, this is a little amorphous maybe.\n\n443\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.820\n>> Well, you know, yeah.\n\n444\n00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.380\nAnd so next time it's like how do I,\nI just did all these settings so\n\n445\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.030\nthat it's internally awesome,\nhow do we do the settings so\n\n446\n00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.230\nnow it's externally awesome\nis what we're looking at.\n\n447\n00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.270\n>> Well, awesome stuff, James.\n\n448\n00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.900\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun,\ngreat demonstrations.\n\n449\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.430\nNow, that we've kinda gotten inside of\nthe car, we've looked at all the bells and\n\n450\n00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.570\nwhistles and knobs we can turn to see what\nit's gonna do, and now we understand that,\n\n451\n00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.300\nwe can move on to more complex things.\n\n452\n00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.060\nJames, looks like we've come\nto the end of a great episode.\n\n453\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.080\nWe really appreciate you dropping by.\n\n454\n00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.240\n>> We gotta come back cuz I wanna do\nthe next one cuz I've got this now.\n\n455\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.280\n>> We are gonna come back.\n\n456\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.930\nWe're gonna have plenty more.\n\n457\n00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.060\nBut for this one though looks\nlike we run out of time.\n\n458\n00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.231\nSo you'll have to come back and\n\n459\n00:23:49.231 --> 00:23:51.269\nsee where James take us down\nthe Adobe Premiere road.\n\n460\n00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:52.937\n>> Yes, do.\n\n461\n00:23:52.937 --> 00:23:55.329\n>> That being said,\nwe're gonna again sign off for ITProTV.\n\n462\n00:23:55.329 --> 00:23:57.028\nI've
