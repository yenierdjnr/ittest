00:00:12.587\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings,\n\n4\n00:00:12.587 --> 00:00:16.190\neveryone, and welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.840\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison,\nand boy we have a treat for you.\n\n6\n00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.400\nWe're getting started with our\nPRINCE2 Foundation 2017 series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.920\nI was a little afraid I wasn't\ngonna get all those words out.\n\n8\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.810\nAnd in particular we're gonna be looking\nat an intro to PRINCE2 project management.\n\n9\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.650\nAnd here to help us along with that\nvery endeavor is Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.330\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, how are you, Justin?\n\n11\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.791\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:37.698\n&gt;&gt; Now, PRINCE2,\n\n13\n00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:40.340\nI've never actually heard of that before.\n\n14\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.782\nWhat is it all about?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, for a start,\n\n15\n00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:49.810\nPRINCE2 is probably unknown to\nyou because of where you're from.\n\n16\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.170\nNo, and it's got nothing to do with\nthe mountains in the middle of nowhere,\n\n17\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.861\ndon't worry.\n\n18\n00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:58.710\nBut actually PRINCE2 is a project\nmanagement methodology that's actually\n\n19\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.470\nbeing used more widely in Europe, and\nin the UK, and in places like Australia.\n\n20\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.750\nOver in North America it's not really\nbecome as popular until fairly lately,\n\n21\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.210\nto be perfectly honest.\n\n22\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.210\nAnd here in the US, we tend to look\na project management methodology\n\n23\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.320\nfrom the PMI, the Project Management\nInstitute's, sort of view point.\n\n24\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.080\nThere is, and we are trying to ensure\nthat there is, a synergy between the two.\n\n25\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.170\nAnd the reason why you called\nit PRINCE2 2017 is because,\n\n26\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.090\nin 2017 PRINCE2 was updated,\nand so, as I've said,\n\n27\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.282\nwe trying to ensure that we've got\nthat synergy between PMI and PRINCE2.\n\n28\n00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:46.060\nBut PRINCE2 is prevalent as the project\nmanagement methodology, as I've said,\n\n29\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.940\nthroughout Europe and throughout the UK,\nand other places in the world.\n\n30\n00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.120\nSo it's not unusual for\nyou not to have heard of it but\n\n31\n00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.910\nit is, as I said, very prevalent,\nvery popular in other parts of the world.\n\n32\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.376\nSo this is why we're actually\ncovering it here and now.\n\n33\n00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:06.565\nIt is completely accredited,\nit is a certification that we expect\n\n34\n00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:12.230\nall project managers to have certainly\nwithin the UK and within Europe.\n\n35\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.670\nAnd so this is why I kinda wanted to take\na look at this in this particular series.\n\n36\n00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.433\nAnd in this series we're gonna be looking\nat the PRINCE2 foundation material,\n\n37\n00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.823\nthat's the introduction to PRINCE2.\n\n38\n00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:30.610\nWe also have another series\nof PRINCE2 2017 practitioner.\n\n39\n00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.248\nNow, I'm gonna warn you now,\n\n40\n00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:35.788\nfrom here on outwards we're just\ngoing to refer it to as PRINCE2.\n\n41\n00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:41.770\nWe're not going to give it the full title\nof PRINCE2 2017, so don't try and work\n\n42\n00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.100\nout how to say that mouthful all the time.\n&gt;&gt; Well, [LAUGH] that definitely helps me,\n\n43\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.830\nJo, cuz I was like I'm getting winded\ntrying to get all these words in there.\n\n44\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.120\nSo from here on out we're\njust gonna call it PRINCE2.\n\n45\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.405\n&gt;&gt; We're just gonna call it PRINCE2\n\n46\n00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:55.020\nfrom now.\n\n47\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.440\nI mean, there are some differences between\nthe previous version of PRINCE2 and\n\n48\n00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.260\nthis version,\n\n49\n00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.810\nbut what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to cover everything from scratch.\n\n50\n00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.890\nThis is not an update show.\n\n51\n00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.020\nThis is not a show where we're\ngoing to look at the differences.\n\n52\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.930\nThis is the show where we're going to\nlook at the entire PRINCE2 methodology.\n\n53\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.560\nSo we are going to start from scratch.\n\n54\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.896\nSo the first question then\nthat I'm gonna ask Justin, but\n\n55\n00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:22.408\nI know, given the fact that he says that\nhe doesn't know anything about this.\n\n56\n00:03:22.408 --> 00:03:27.953\nWhat do you think PRINCE2 stands for?\n\n57\n00:03:27.953 --> 00:03:32.900\n&gt;&gt; Projects in something, I don't know.\n\n58\n00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.880\nProjects in something?\n&gt;&gt; Projects in\n\n59\n00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.753\nsomething.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n60\n00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:41.250\nI'm not saying something is\nthe actual answer [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.981\nProjects in,\n[SOUND] there's something there.\n\n62\n00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:44.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there is.\n\n63\n00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:47.930\nOkay, I'm surprised you got\nthe first two letters actually,\n\n64\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.132\nI'm impressed.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n65\n00:03:49.132 --> 00:03:52.214\nthat was a total guess.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's actually projects in\n\n66\n00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:56.365\na controlled environment, and\nthat's what PRINCE2 stands for.\n\n67\n00:03:56.365 --> 00:03:57.677\nAnd you'll see, I mean,\n\n68\n00:03:57.677 --> 00:04:01.465\nwe've got a little bit of a reminder\nup there on the screen in front of you.\n\n69\n00:04:01.465 --> 00:04:07.125\nNow, one thing I will tell you about this\nparticular series is that in order to\n\n70\n00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:12.800\nsupport your accreditation, and you will\nbe able to sit your PRINCE2 Foundation\n\n71\n00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.698\nexam once you've watched all of\nthe episodes in this series.\n\n72\n00:04:17.698 --> 00:04:20.100\nSo we do have available for\n\n73\n00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.170\nyou downloadable material that\nwill help you with your study.\n\n74\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.880\nWe're also, at the end of this series,\ngoing to go over a sample exam as well.\n\n75\n00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.550\nEverything that you see on\nthe screen in front of you and\n\n76\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.520\nmore is actually going to be available\nto you so that you can download\n\n77\n00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.200\nalong with the very minimal show notes\nthat are gonna go along with this.\n\n78\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.000\nOr the course descriptions that\nare gonna go along with this.\n\n79\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.260\nYou're going to find this particular\nPowerPoint available to you.\n\n80\n00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.176\nSo, Justin,\n\n81\n00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:57.160\nwhere did you think PRINCE2 came from?\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to\n\n82\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.540\ngo with some government entity.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n83\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.520\n&gt;&gt; Maybe one of those countries you spoke\n\n84\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.510\nabout earlier.\n\n85\n00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.050\nOne of those government institutions\nthat came along with this\n\n86\n00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.540\nproject management style?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n87\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.610\nwell I know that you've heard of ITIL.\n&gt;&gt; I have.\n\n88\n00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, I know this for\n\n89\n00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.270\na fact because I don't shut\nup in the office about it,\n\n90\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.152\nso I know that you've heard of that.\n\n91\n00:05:16.152 --> 00:05:19.327\nAnd PRINCE2 came from the same\nplace that ITIL came from, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:20.980\nIt came from the UK government.\n\n93\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.260\nIt started off in the mid 1980s and it\nhas a very very similar timeline to ITIL,\n\n94\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.160\nand this was really about\nthe UK government, or\n\n95\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.120\nrather the Office of Government Commerce,\nthe OGC, decided that they needed\n\n96\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.620\na way to manage projects within\nthe government environment.\n\n97\n00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.820\nThe OGC,\nthe Office of Government Commerce,\n\n98\n00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.440\nit was called the CCTA before that.\n\n99\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.420\nBut the Office of Government Commerce\nwere responsible for ensuring that\n\n100\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.220\ngovernment upheld and\nstill upholds certain,\n\n101\n00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.090\nwell, I was gonna say rules, but\nmore ethics, to be perfectly honest.\n\n102\n00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.990\nThings like the fact that\nwe've gotta be impartial, and\n\n103\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.360\nthe fact that government has to make\nbest use of taxpayers money, which means\n\n104\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.480\nthe government has to have a focus on\nefficiency as well as effectiveness.\n\n105\n00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.400\nSo what the OGC wanted to do was to\nimplement a way of managing projects\n\n106\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.270\nwith a consistent approach to\nmanaging projects that applied to\n\n107\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.140\nall government departments.\n\n108\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.220\nSo what they did way back in the mid-1980s\nwas they went out into the big wide world\n\n109\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.890\nto find out how projects were implemented,\nwell, in other organizations.\n\n110\n00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.055\nOrganizations that were\nmore attune to managing IT,\n\n111\n00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:41.929\ncuz don't forget back in the 1980s,\nwe didn't have that much IT around.\n\n112\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.574\nAnd so this where PRINCE2 came from,\n\n113\n00:06:45.574 --> 00:06:50.824\nit started off as something called Prompt\nand then we changed that to PRINCE,\n\n114\n00:06:50.824 --> 00:06:55.942\nbecause Projects In Controlled Environment\nsounded a little bit better.\n\n115\n00:06:55.942 --> 00:07:00.934\nAnd in 1996 it was changed to PRINCE2 and\nnow here we are,\n\n116\n00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:07.490\nwe're at PRINCE2 version 2017,\nwhich is the latest version of PRINCE2.\n\n117\n00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.500\nSo, I've already told you that this\nis your foundation test, okay?\n\n118\n00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.910\nSo, I'm gonna tell you a little bit more\nabout the exam, and on the screen in front\n\n119\n00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.530\nof you, you'll see that we've got some,\nI wouldn't say a cheat sheet.\n\n120\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.045\nIt just tells you a little\nbit more about the test.\n\n121\n00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:28.615\nThe test itself is based on absolutely\neverything that we've covered in this\n\n122\n00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:29.990\nparticular series.\n\n123\n00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.700\nAnd that includes everything\nwe are about to cover and\n\n124\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.310\neverything that we've covered so far.\n\n125\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.442\nI'm not gonna tell you that you're\nnot gonna be asked questions\n\n126\n00:07:40.442 --> 00:07:42.014\nabout the history of PRINCE2.\n\n127\n00:07:42.014 --> 00:07:45.570\nI'm not gonna tell you that you\nare gonna be asked questions.\n\n128\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.780\nBut certainly I wouldn't gloss over it,\nput it that way.\n\n129\n00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.439\nIt could be something where we\nmay ask you where it came from.\n\n130\n00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:58.272\nWe're not gonna ask you for specific\ndates, so don't worry too much about that.\n\n131\n00:07:58.272 --> 00:08:00.127\nIt's a one hour test.\n\n132\n00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:04.028\nIt's a multiple choice,\nit's a simple multiple choice for\n\n133\n00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:08.846\nyour foundation test and so you're gonna\nget a question that may ask you A,\n\n134\n00:08:08.846 --> 00:08:11.696\nB, C and D or A, B, C,\nyou have to pick one.\n\n135\n00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:15.680\nThere is only one right answer and\nthere is no negative marking.\n\n136\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.860\nLook how many you get.\n\n137\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.810\nYou get 60 questions in 60 minutes.\n\n138\n00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.910\nNow Justin, I know that your maths\nis great, so can you work that out?\n\n139\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.330\n&gt;&gt; That's one question a minute.\n\n140\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.370\nYou gotta get with it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n141\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.330\nThis is gonna be a very quick test.\n\n142\n00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.300\nTime's gonna go by really, really quickly.\n\n143\n00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.950\nYou are going to feel [LAUGH] as,\nthough, you've done nothing but read for\n\n144\n00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.520\nthat entire 60 minutes but that's true.\n\n145\n00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.680\nOkay, you've got one question per minute.\n\n146\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.640\nThat said,\nI don't want you to rush through it.\n\n147\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.900\nYou look as though you're worried\nabout that though, Justin.\n\n148\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.400\n&gt;&gt; I'm not worried about rushing through\n\n149\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.180\nit but whenever I encounter tests\nlike this, I always think about what\n\n150\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.000\nare appropriate strategies\n&gt;&gt; Can I skip a question if I don't\n\n151\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.480\nimmediately know the answer and return to\nit, like market because that changes how I\n\n152\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.090\nprocess one question a minute.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n153\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.170\nSo what you can do,\nyou can go through each one and\n\n154\n00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.750\nconsecutive, sort of chronological,\nlogical order.\n\n155\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:24.170\nAnd if you don't know the answer to\na question, I will tell you to skip it.\n\n156\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.320\nThe reason why I do that is because there\nmight be a question a little bit later on\n\n157\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.740\nin your test that might\ngive you the answer, or\n\n158\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.530\nat least prompt your memory to answer\nthe question that you skipped.\n\n159\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.120\nSo if you don't know the answer to\nsomething, then that's not a problem.\n\n160\n00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.370\nSkip it and move on.\n\n161\n00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.780\nI've had people that have said to me on\nthis test, when they come back to me and\n\n162\n00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.880\nsaid to me afterwards I didn't do\nthe first term question, and that's okay.\n\n163\n00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.680\nDon't get yourself stressed about it, and\ndon't worry about it, just skip it and\n\n164\n00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.370\nskip as many as you need to until\nyou can answer one with confidence.\n\n165\n00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.130\nAnd then carry on going through and\nyou can go back.\n\n166\n00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.155\nNow if you skipped all 60,\nthat's a problem.\n\n167\n00:10:07.155 --> 00:10:11.630\n[LAUGH] That means that you seriously\nhaven't done enough studying, so\n\n168\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:19.550\nmake sure that you have enough study time\nbefore you take your test, be prepared.\n\n169\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.390\nYou don't have the time\nwith this particular\n\n170\n00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.460\ntest to read through the question\npaper first, and then come back to it.\n\n171\n00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.200\nNow I refer to it as a question paper.\n\n172\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.480\nIt's another interesting thing because\nwhen you said could I skip it and\n\n173\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.000\ncome back to it.\n\n174\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.710\nI was gonna answer that\nquestion with it depends.\n\n175\n00:10:36.754 --> 00:10:40.610\nAnd the reason I was gonna do that was\nit depends on whether you are visiting\n\n176\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:45.460\na Prometric Center or\ntaking a physical test with a piece of\n\n177\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.250\npaper at a particular parametric center,\nwhich you're quite able to do or\n\n178\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.770\nwhether you're taking your test online,\nwhich is what most people will do.\n\n179\n00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.350\nIf you've got a piece of paper\nin front of you, it's really,\n\n180\n00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.830\nreally easy to skip through and\nthen just to go back to something.\n\n181\n00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.690\nIf you're doing it online,\nit's not necessarily so easy.\n\n182\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:10.240\nYou will not be able to have a pen and\npaper with you.\n\n183\n00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.450\nSo you won't be able to mark down,\nwhich questions you've skipped.\n\n184\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.690\nBearing in mind that you go through\neach question in a logical order,\n\n185\n00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.770\nin numerical order that's\nhow it's presented to you.\n\n186\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.811\nYou need to make sure that you\nanswered all 60 questions.\n\n187\n00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.133\nThe pass mark is 55%.\n\n188\n00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:30.712\nIt's 33 points, so\nyou've got to get 33 right.\n\n189\n00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:38.140\nYou can only get 33 right\nif you've answered 33.\n\n190\n00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.080\nIt is a closed book test.\n\n191\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.757\nAnd to be perfectly,\nhonest, you know what,\n\n192\n00:11:44.757 --> 00:11:46.392\nthat's probably the best\nthing it could be.\n\n193\n00:11:46.392 --> 00:11:49.735\nBecause if you've got an hour and\nyou've got a minute per question,\n\n194\n00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:52.400\nyou don't have time to be\nreading through any books.\n\n195\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.740\nAnd it doesn't matter whether you're using\nthe foundation handbook or whether you're\n\n196\n00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.970\nusing the entire PRINCE2 book, you don't\nhave time to be going through a book.\n\n197\n00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:06.110\nSo what I would recommend is you get\nyour study out of the way first.\n\n198\n00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:11.710\nApproach every single question\nin a logical order and\n\n199\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:16.680\nthen, go back and answer any questions\nthat you may have forgotten.\n\n200\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.900\nNow I mentioned that it does\ntake a few people for that.\n\n201\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.620\nAnd PeopleCert are the examining body.\n\n202\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:29.200\nExamining body for, well,\nall of the Acellus accreditations.\n\n203\n00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.983\nNow, I haven't mentioned Acellus before.\n\n204\n00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:36.035\nDo you remember who Acellus is?\n&gt;&gt; No, I do not.\n\n205\n00:12:36.035 --> 00:12:37.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\n\n206\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.120\nI mentioned the OGC\na little bit earlier on.\n\n207\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.350\nAnd about the OGC use to own\nthis particular methodology.\n\n208\n00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.426\nWell, they do and they own a few other\nmethodologies but a few years ago, they\n\n209\n00:12:48.426 --> 00:12:52.843\nhanded over control of these methodologies\nto the governing body called Acellus.\n\n210\n00:12:52.843 --> 00:12:56.440\nAnd if you see in the bottom\nright hand corner of this slide.\n\n211\n00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.420\nYou will see Acellus mentioned and\n\n212\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.760\nthis is why peoples that I mentioned is\nthe examining body on behalf of Acellus,\n\n213\n00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.080\nand Acellus are the accreditors for\nthis particular test.\n\n214\n00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.940\nSo now that we've looked at the history or\n\n215\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.880\nwe've looked at where sort\nof PRINCE2 comes from and\n\n216\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.700\nwho's gonna be managing PRINCE2, I don't\nwant you to be worried about the test.\n\n217\n00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.660\nTell me you're not worried about the test.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not worried about the test.\n\n218\n00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.380\nIt's one of those things where you and\nI have discussed this, test taking\n\n219\n00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.390\nstrategies, how do I approach studying and\nthings, and we share similar viewpoints.\n\n220\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.012\nI tend to do fairly well\non standardized tests.\n\n221\n00:13:31.012 --> 00:13:33.706\nSo, just listen to what the lady says and\n\n222\n00:13:33.706 --> 00:13:36.664\neverything will be all right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I had an old\n\n223\n00:13:36.664 --> 00:13:38.430\nEnglish teacher once,\nshe was actually very old.\n\n224\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.660\nAnd she used to say to me,\ndon't rest on your laurels.\n\n225\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.390\nAnd I never understand what that meant,\n\n226\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.560\nbecause to me laurels was a bush,\nwasn't it?\n\n227\n00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:51.190\nAnyway, apparently it means don't sort of\nassume that you're gonna sail through it.\n\n228\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.060\nYou still have to do some studying.\n\n229\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.850\nI'm not gonna tell you that this is\na particularly taxing test to take, but\n\n230\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:02.250\njust because of the time you've\ngot a time limit on this.\n\n231\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.538\nAnd because you've got one question per\nminute then that does make you feel as,\n\n232\n00:14:06.538 --> 00:14:09.101\nthough, you're a little bit pushed for\ntime.\n\n233\n00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:11.873\nSo do as much study as you can,\nget into it,\n\n234\n00:14:11.873 --> 00:14:16.963\ngo into it with as much confidence as\nyou have, as you'd possibly could have.\n\n235\n00:14:16.963 --> 00:14:20.991\nSo, now that we've taken a look at\nPRINCE2 and where it came from and\n\n236\n00:14:20.991 --> 00:14:23.660\nhow it started off as prompt and\nthen PRINCE.\n\n237\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:29.590\nAnd now, we're going to look at,\nwell, what PRINCE2 does?\n\n238\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.090\nSo the first thing we're going to\nthink about is, what is project?\n\n239\n00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.740\nWhen do we need a project?\n\n240\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.580\nWhat defines a project?\n\n241\n00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.090\nWhat do you think of when\nyou think of a project?\n\n242\n00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.050\n&gt;&gt; I think of a project\n\n243\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.130\nas having a specific set of requirements.\n\n244\n00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.290\nThe person who's requested\nlike these things be done.\n\n245\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:56.085\nA specific timeline and then to some\nextent a description of deliverables.\n\n246\n00:14:56.085 --> 00:14:58.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but you kind of jumped\n\n247\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.614\nstraight in half way through.\n&gt;&gt; I sure did.\n\n248\n00:15:01.614 --> 00:15:03.282\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which is about normal for\n\n249\n00:15:03.282 --> 00:15:04.820\nJustin right here.\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo,\n\n250\n00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.370\nif I could sum it up in 10 minutes\nthen what are we doing here, right?\n\n251\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.900\nYeah, okay, then.\n\n252\n00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.780\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n253\n00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.520\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what to say.\n\n254\n00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.910\nLet's start off at the beginning, right.\n\n255\n00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.710\nIt's a good place to start apparently.\n\n256\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:18.350\nSo I've heard.\n\n257\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:26.310\nA project is needed because we want\nto change something within IT.\n\n258\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.100\nWe want to bring something in.\n\n259\n00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.700\nMaybe it's a new set of requirements,\nas you mentioned.\n\n260\n00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:38.010\nOr maybe we move something that we've\nalready got because it's outdated.\n\n261\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.630\nMaybe you want to change the way\nthat the business works.\n\n262\n00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.207\nThat's why we bring in project.\n\n263\n00:15:44.207 --> 00:15:45.617\nAnd a project is really,\n\n264\n00:15:45.617 --> 00:15:49.728\nlet's think about this simplistically\ncuz I like the simple approach.\n\n265\n00:15:49.728 --> 00:15:51.783\nA project is a big change.\n\n266\n00:15:51.783 --> 00:15:53.136\nThat's what it is.\n\n267\n00:15:53.136 --> 00:15:56.928\nWe have change management for\nsmall changes within IT.\n\n268\n00:15:56.928 --> 00:16:01.401\nMaybe when we want to swap out a server,\nwe have change management that will\n\n269\n00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:04.820\nhelp us with that from\nan operational perspective.\n\n270\n00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.141\nBut sometimes we want to do things\nthat's going to affect either\n\n271\n00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:11.769\nthe entire infrastructure, or\nmaybe it's something that is going to\n\n272\n00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:15.536\naffect the entire organization or\nlarge portions of the organization.\n\n273\n00:16:15.536 --> 00:16:19.990\nAnd so what we need to do is\nbring in project management.\n\n274\n00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:25.510\nBecause we want to manage the change\nin a more controlled way.\n\n275\n00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:30.300\nSo if we take a look at our screen here\nnow, you'll see that the project is\n\n276\n00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:35.240\njust a vehicle, no it's not a car,\nso don't get all excited.\n\n277\n00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.020\nIt's just a vehicular way of\nintroducing large scale changes.\n\n278\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:46.170\nInterestingly enough,\na project is a temporary thing.\n\n279\n00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.290\nIt's a temporary process.\n\n280\n00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.230\nUnlike change control and change\nmanagement, in an operational environment,\n\n281\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:58.880\nwe have change management\nthroughout the live operations,\n\n282\n00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.170\nbecause we're always making changes.\n\n283\n00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:06.270\nA project is started for\na specific reason, and\n\n284\n00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.060\nonce that change has been implemented and\n\n285\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.760\neverything is working okay,\nthat's an important part.\n\n286\n00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.060\nOnce it's been implemented and\nwe're happy with the results and\n\n287\n00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:23.020\neverything is working okay, and\nwe've had that bedding in period,\n\n288\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:29.090\nthen the project team is disbanded,\nor they move on to something else.\n\n289\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.580\nWhich is why a project\nis a temporary entity.\n\n290\n00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.470\nIt's a process that happens on a one on.\n\n291\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:42.821\nSo if you think about the difference\nbetween a closed loop process and\n\n292\n00:17:42.821 --> 00:17:47.797\nan open loop process, well,\ndo you know what the difference is?\n\n293\n00:17:47.797 --> 00:17:50.589\nWe've talked about this before.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You must have seen the terror\n\n294\n00:17:50.589 --> 00:17:52.309\nin my eyes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:17:52.309 --> 00:17:54.286\n&gt;&gt; So closed loop just kinda feeds around\n\n296\n00:17:54.286 --> 00:17:55.740\nback into itself, right?\n\n297\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.420\nStage one feeds into stage two,\nfeeds into stage three,\n\n298\n00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.490\nwhich feeds back into stage one.\n\n299\n00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.573\nI'm using those loosely.\n\n300\n00:18:02.573 --> 00:18:07.435\nBut then a closed loop is, at some point,\nwe gotta go to an outside entity, right,\n\n301\n00:18:07.435 --> 00:18:09.386\nam I thinking of that correctly?\n\n302\n00:18:09.386 --> 00:18:12.088\nAll right, you see?\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah, kind of, kind of.\n\n303\n00:18:12.088 --> 00:18:13.980\nA closed loop feeds around on itself,\n\n304\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.910\nan open loop is a one off thing, okay.\n&gt;&gt; That seems more like a line\n\n305\n00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.298\nthan an open loop to me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can be like that.\n\n306\n00:18:22.298 --> 00:18:22.928\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n307\n00:18:22.928 --> 00:18:23.598\n&gt;&gt; Let's think about,\n\n308\n00:18:23.598 --> 00:18:24.909\nwe've got a thermostat on the wall here.\n\n309\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.070\nAnd that thermostat,\nwe set a specific control on that\n\n310\n00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.430\nthermostat which might be the,\nwell it would be the temperature.\n\n311\n00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.520\nNow, I'll set it to\na different temperature to you.\n\n312\n00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:39.650\nOnly because I work in weird sort\nof numerical values, like Celsius.\n\n313\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:44.840\nBut if I set it to say, 19 degrees,\nwhat will happen is when\n\n314\n00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.120\nthe temperature goes above 19 degrees,\nthen the air conditioning kicks on.\n\n315\n00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.520\nBut then our thermostat remains\nmonitoring the condition.\n\n316\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.200\nAnd then when the temperature\nfalls below 19 degrees,\n\n317\n00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.690\nthen the air conditioning is turned off.\n\n318\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.540\nSo that's what we call\na closed loop process.\n\n319\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.910\nIt's monitoring,\nit's making an adjustment.\n\n320\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.100\nIt carries on monitoring, and\nit makes another adjustment.\n\n321\n00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.340\nAn open loop process.\n\n322\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.750\nOpen loop means it's a one-off thing.\n\n323\n00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.760\nSo as you said, it's a timeline.\n\n324\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.490\nSo it starts off as a request.\n\n325\n00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.310\nAnd then the project happens, we implement\nthe change, but then it's closed,\n\n326\n00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.500\nit's a bit like lighting a fire.\n\n327\n00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.310\nInstead of, or\nmaybe just turning on a fan,\n\n328\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:33.800\ninstead of it responding to\nspecific environmental conditions,\n\n329\n00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.600\nthat fan is just gonna be on until you\ngo and physically turn it off again.\n\n330\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.518\nSo the difference between closed loop and\n\n331\n00:19:40.518 --> 00:19:44.322\nopen loop.\n&gt;&gt; So would you say that a closed loop is\n\n332\n00:19:44.322 --> 00:19:47.250\nmore of a feedback driven process?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n333\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.920\n&gt;&gt; Whereas an open loop is just like,\n\n334\n00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.870\nhere's what it is.\n\n335\n00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.800\nAnd it kind of,\nthe end result is whatever happens,\n\n336\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.430\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n337\n00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.530\n&gt;&gt; If we turn on a fan,\n\n338\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.600\nit might get cooler.\n\n339\n00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.200\nOr it might be in front of a fire, and\n\n340\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.080\nit's blowing hot air.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.450\n&gt;&gt; So it might get warmer.\n\n342\n00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.780\nBut you turn on the fan and\n\n343\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.040\nthe fan did set things.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n344\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.470\nThat's exactly the difference.\n\n345\n00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.300\nOur closed loop process\nisn't gonna be monitoring.\n\n346\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.958\nSo the other thing about a project\nis a project is cross-functional.\n\n347\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:19.350\nAnd by cross-functional we mean\nthat we've got many people for\n\n348\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.740\nmany different areas within\nIT with varying skills.\n\n349\n00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.620\nIt's not something that just\none team gets involved.\n\n350\n00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.960\nSo let's say we were brining in, I don't\nknow, Oracle Pro Financials, think about\n\n351\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.140\nwhat teams would be involved in that.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go\n\n352\n00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.040\nwith accounting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n353\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.276\n&gt;&gt; Probably some SIS admin individuals.\n\n354\n00:20:40.276 --> 00:20:41.844\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n355\n00:20:41.844 --> 00:20:43.900\n&gt;&gt; Maybe some business analysts.\n\n356\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.320\nLike some of the, I don't know\nif those would technically be,\n\n357\n00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.430\ndepends on your business structure.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n358\n00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.610\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n359\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.180\nmaybe even some security individuals.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what about server people,\n\n360\n00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.650\nwhat about infrastructure people?\n\n361\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.690\nI mean, you mentioned sys admin, but\n\n362\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:03.840\nI've got nobody from any networks here,\nI've got nobody from any server teams.\n\n363\n00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.610\nI'm assuming you're thinking,\nwhen you think sys admin,\n\n364\n00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.238\nare you're thinking DBAs or not?\n&gt;&gt; Let's\n\n365\n00:21:11.238 --> 00:21:15.494\njust say operations\nindividuals of some source,\n\n366\n00:21:15.494 --> 00:21:20.286\nbut even then, it kinda gets, eh.\n&gt;&gt; Right, you need lots of people\n\n367\n00:21:20.286 --> 00:21:23.910\nfrom lots of different areas with\nlots of different expertise.\n\n368\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:29.540\nSomebody with just my limited\nexpertise could not just go out and\n\n369\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.330\nimplement Oracle.\n\n370\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:36.450\nAnd so when you think about the fact that,\nwell, you need lots of people,\n\n371\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.930\na lot of people then, are a lot of people\norganizations will actually outsource\n\n372\n00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:44.930\ntheir project management because they\nneed people with specialist skills.\n\n373\n00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.230\nSo we call them cross-functional,\nbut it really\n\n374\n00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.790\nis dependent on your organization as to\nwhether you want to use internal people or\n\n375\n00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.020\nwhether you want to bring\nin external people.\n\n376\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.030\nWe mention again that\nthe project is temporary.\n\n377\n00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:03.233\nAnd so a lot of organizations will\nbring in a temporary team for\n\n378\n00:22:03.233 --> 00:22:07.536\nimplementing that new change and\nthat new, well,\n\n379\n00:22:07.536 --> 00:22:11.753\npiece of software, or\nwhatever it happens to be.\n\n380\n00:22:11.753 --> 00:22:15.162\nThe issue with that is\nyou've got to make sure, and\n\n381\n00:22:15.162 --> 00:22:19.780\nwe're gonna talk about something\ncalled devops a little bit later.\n\n382\n00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:25.731\nBut you've got to make sure that if you do\nthat, then they have a handover period,\n\n383\n00:22:25.731 --> 00:22:31.780\nand that handover period is really going\nto be focused on the operational side.\n\n384\n00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:38.240\nAnd how these operational guys are going\nto manage that new service going forwards,\n\n385\n00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:43.080\ninto the future, including continual\nimprovement activities as well.\n\n386\n00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.380\nBecause each project is unique.\n\n387\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.850\nThere are no two projects the same.\n\n388\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.950\nAnd even if you're trying to bring in\nmaybe two different Oracle databases,\n\n389\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.520\neach one is still going to be unique.\n\n390\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.441\nWhich means that because\nyou're bringing in change,\n\n391\n00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:02.007\nit's going to be filled with risk.\n\n392\n00:23:03.997 --> 00:23:07.493\nWhat do you think of when\nI mention the word risk?\n\n393\n00:23:07.493 --> 00:23:10.196\n&gt;&gt; Could cost more money than it actually\n\n394\n00:23:10.196 --> 00:23:14.249\ngives you back, could cost,\ncould be a security issue,\n\n395\n00:23:14.249 --> 00:23:19.130\nthose are the two things that\nimmediately cropped in my mind.\n\n396\n00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:24.548\nMaybe it was a poor business decision\nif it causes horrific financial impact.\n\n397\n00:23:24.548 --> 00:23:25.218\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n398\n00:23:25.218 --> 00:23:28.093\nwell risk to me means it could fail.\n\n399\n00:23:28.093 --> 00:23:31.352\nYeah, for all of the reasons\nthat you've just mentioned, but\n\n400\n00:23:31.352 --> 00:23:35.050\na risk is something that could fail,\nand it's filled with risk.\n\n401\n00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.593\nIt's filled with opportunities for\nfailure.\n\n402\n00:23:38.593 --> 00:23:43.500\nAs you said, it could be because we run\nout of money, which is a classic one for\n\n403\n00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.911\na project, and\nyou don't mean to make light of that.\n\n404\n00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:50.851\nBut I wonder how many and\nwhat percentage of projects out there\n\n405\n00:23:50.851 --> 00:23:54.657\nactually delivered on time and\nto the right budget as well.\n\n406\n00:23:54.657 --> 00:24:00.770\nSo risk could be that we run out of money,\nor risk could be that we run out time.\n\n407\n00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.620\nNow, that sounds a little\nbit crazy as well.\n\n408\n00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.816\nBut I've known projects that have gone\nover on their time by quite a lot.\n\n409\n00:24:08.816 --> 00:24:13.342\nBut I've also known organizations\nthat have actually tried to bring\n\n410\n00:24:13.342 --> 00:24:14.599\nthe time forward.\n\n411\n00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:18.663\nWe need it sooner, and\nwe need it sooner because of the, well,\n\n412\n00:24:18.663 --> 00:24:21.500\nbecause we need to get to market quicker,\nor\n\n413\n00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.125\nbecause of our competitors, and\nbecause of the organization itself.\n\n414\n00:24:26.125 --> 00:24:28.490\nThey need to do something.\n\n415\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:32.970\nThey want to launch a marketing campaign,\nand so we've got to implement this sooner.\n\n416\n00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.813\nOr maybe even government regulations,\nwe've got some new regulations in\n\n417\n00:24:36.813 --> 00:24:39.445\nregarding reporting and\nregarding our finances.\n\n418\n00:24:39.445 --> 00:24:42.810\nSo we've got to bring this in sooner.\n\n419\n00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:44.789\nProjects are filled with risk.\n\n420\n00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:48.370\nSo part of project management\nis actually managing risk.\n\n421\n00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.743\nSo the definition of a project from a\nPRINCE2 perspective is as is on the screen\n\n422\n00:24:53.743 --> 00:24:54.832\nin front of you now.\n\n423\n00:24:54.832 --> 00:24:59.095\nIt's a temporary organization,\nit's created for the purpose for\n\n424\n00:24:59.095 --> 00:25:04.270\ndelivering one or more business products\naccording to the agreed business case.\n\n425\n00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.260\nAnd we're gonna talk about\na business case in a later episode.\n\n426\n00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:12.680\nSo a PRINCE2 project is a project\nthat applies PRINCE2 principles.\n\n427\n00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:18.080\nIt's a project that meets the requirements\nof the PRINCE2 themes, and\n\n428\n00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.060\nwe'll talk about those a little\nbit later in another episode.\n\n429\n00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:27.630\nIt's got processes that satisfy, well,\nthe objectives of PRINCE2 processes and\n\n430\n00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.538\nit uses PRINCE2 recommended techniques.\n\n431\n00:25:30.538 --> 00:25:35.513\nThis is an important slide, and\nI'm gonna tell you to download this, and\n\n432\n00:25:35.513 --> 00:25:39.060\nI'm gonna tell you to read this over and\nover again.\n\n433\n00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:44.790\nBecause a project cannot\nbe categorized as PRINCE2,\n\n434\n00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:52.110\nor considered as PRINCE2,\nunless it adheres to each one of these.\n\n435\n00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.350\nThis is an important slide.\n\n436\n00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:01.100\nNow, that's not to say that PRINCE2\nis inflexible, because it isn't.\n\n437\n00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:05.510\nPRINCE2, well, should be tailored.\n\n438\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.100\nIt's based on these best practices but\nit should be tailored.\n\n439\n00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:14.000\nAnd PRINCE2 methodologies and\nPRINCE2 themes and PRINCE2 processes\n\n440\n00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.480\ncan be applied to absolutely any project,\nand they can be tailored.\n\n441\n00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.820\nWhat we want from PRINCE2 and\nwhat we need and\n\n442\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.720\nwhat PRINCE2 gives us is\nthis common language.\n\n443\n00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:30.020\nAnd I like the, I mentioned the word\nconsistency right at the beginning of\n\n444\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.720\nthis particular episode and\nI like that word, consistency.\n\n445\n00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.180\nThat's what we want, a common language.\n\n446\n00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.310\nBecause if I don't talk the same\nlanguage as Justin, which I don't.\n\n447\n00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.816\nLet's face, it I don't.\nBut\n\n448\n00:26:40.816 --> 00:26:45.655\nif I don't talk the same language as him\nthe communication can be really difficult.\n\n449\n00:26:45.655 --> 00:26:51.070\nAnd I might ask him for something and he\nmight do something completely different.\n\n450\n00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.492\nIf I ask you, Justin, or\nI tell you that you need to go away and\n\n451\n00:26:55.492 --> 00:26:58.352\nrevise your notes now cuz you've\ngot a test a little bit later on,\n\n452\n00:26:58.352 --> 00:27:01.371\nwhat are you gonna do?\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to rewrite\n\n453\n00:27:01.371 --> 00:27:05.180\nthem.\n&gt;&gt; And then I'll just laugh, because\n\n454\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.425\ndo you know what I asked him to do?\n&gt;&gt; Review them, I'm going to guess.\n\n455\n00:27:09.425 --> 00:27:13.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I asked him to study.\n\n456\n00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.190\nCuz where I come from revise means study.\n\n457\n00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.551\nAnd where you come from-\n&gt;&gt; It means make a revision.\n\n458\n00:27:19.551 --> 00:27:20.127\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n459\n00:27:20.127 --> 00:27:20.950\n&gt;&gt; Where you make changes and\n\n460\n00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.070\nmake it better.\n&gt;&gt; Make a change.\n\n461\n00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.610\nThis is why we have to\nhave a common language.\n\n462\n00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.077\nThis is why PRINCE2 is important,\n\n463\n00:27:28.077 --> 00:27:33.352\ncuz it establishes that common language\nacross the project organization.\n\n464\n00:27:33.352 --> 00:27:37.985\nNow that's not necessarily a common\nlanguage across the whole of IT by\n\n465\n00:27:37.985 --> 00:27:42.869\nthe way, but this is a common language\nacross the project organization.\n\n466\n00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.550\nAll of the participants\nof the project have got\n\n467\n00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.830\nto work together to\nfocus on that viability.\n\n468\n00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.040\nAnd all of our stakeholders\nhave got to be involved.\n\n469\n00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.910\nBut we've all got to be\ntalking the same language.\n\n470\n00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:03.698\nNow, there's something on the bottom\nbullet point there which talks\n\n471\n00:28:03.698 --> 00:28:05.900\nabout the maturity of PRINCE2.\n\n472\n00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.668\nAnd within our AXELOS Suite,\nwe've got something called P3M3\n\n473\n00:28:10.668 --> 00:28:15.710\nwhich is Portfolio Program and\nProject Management Maturity Model.\n\n474\n00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:20.460\nNow, if Justin couldn't say PRINCE2\n2017 Foundation he's certainly not going\n\n475\n00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.585\nto be able to say that, right?\n\n476\n00:28:22.585 --> 00:28:25.960\nPortfolio, program, and\nproject management maturity model.\n\n477\n00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.270\nIt's an assessment.\n\n478\n00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:32.253\nIt's an assessment tool that we will\nuse and assess the efficiency and\n\n479\n00:28:32.253 --> 00:28:34.370\neffectiveness of PRINCE2.\n\n480\n00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.395\nAnd to assess where the PRINCE2,\nwhere the project management and\n\n481\n00:28:38.395 --> 00:28:43.630\nwhere the portfolio and program management\nare working at their most efficient level.\n\n482\n00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:51.280\nSo just before we close for\nthis particular episode, I want to look at\n\n483\n00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.070\nProject Management from\na PRINCE2 perspective.\n\n484\n00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.820\nYou'll see that we have four elements\nlisted on the right hand side there,\n\n485\n00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.620\nand that's Plan, Delegate,\nMonitor and Control.\n\n486\n00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.340\nAnd project management is\nabout a planning, delegating,\n\n487\n00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.040\nmonitoring and\ncontrol of all aspects of a project.\n\n488\n00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:18.330\nAnd look at what is really important\nby the way, motivating team members.\n\n489\n00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.198\nWhy do you think we want\nto motivate people?\n\n490\n00:29:21.198 --> 00:29:23.294\n&gt;&gt; Because that's when you actually get\n\n491\n00:29:23.294 --> 00:29:23.954\nwork done.\n\n492\n00:29:23.954 --> 00:29:27.208\nIf you're just like, just do it already!\n\n493\n00:29:27.208 --> 00:29:28.760\nAnd everybody is not motivated,\n\n494\n00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.476\nthen even if you do get it done you'll get\nit done poorly or maybe it just doesn't\n\n495\n00:29:32.476 --> 00:29:34.478\nget actually accomplished at all.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n496\n00:29:34.478 --> 00:29:36.722\nthere's been a big push\nlately in the industry.\n\n497\n00:29:36.722 --> 00:29:38.796\nAnd I don't know whether\nyou've noticed this, but\n\n498\n00:29:38.796 --> 00:29:41.592\nthere's been a big push towards\norganizational change management.\n\n499\n00:29:41.592 --> 00:29:47.041\nPMI have implemented a big push towards\norganizational change management.If\n\n500\n00:29:47.041 --> 00:29:52.160\nwe look at the other frameworks and\nmethodologies within the Axila Suite,\n\n501\n00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:58.330\nCertainly within ITIL they had a big push\ntowards organizational change management.\n\n502\n00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.980\nIf we look at other\nmethodologies such as Agile and\n\n503\n00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.120\nCyan, they've got a big\npush towards OCM as well.\n\n504\n00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:09.750\nAnd organizational change management is\nabout getting the people along with you.\n\n505\n00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.160\nIt's not good enough just to give them\nsomething to do, you've got to really\n\n506\n00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.120\nexplain why they're doing it, and you've\ngot to bring them on board with you.\n\n507\n00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.020\nIf you don't, like you say,\nit becomes a very sort of\n\n508\n00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.810\ndictatorial environment to work in and\nthe work doesn't get done.\n\n509\n00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:30.490\nIf I'm not bold into something then I'm\nnot gonna work as hard as I should.\n\n510\n00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.710\nAnd maybe that's, you might consider\nthat to be my bad character, but\n\n511\n00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.160\nit's not really about character trade,\nit's human nature.\n\n512\n00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.930\nUnless you've convinced me that something\nis a good idea, I'm going to do it\n\n513\n00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.850\nbegrudgingly and I'm certainly not\ngoing to give it a hundred percent.\n\n514\n00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.547\nAnd I know that you're the same.\n&gt;&gt; I am exactly the same, and I would,\n\n515\n00:30:46.547 --> 00:30:50.730\nsay by and large, as generalization,\nnot everybody applies.\n\n516\n00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.650\nExternal motivation is not as motivating,\nright, this kind of external\n\n517\n00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:00.500\nstimuli is not nearly as motivating as\ninternal stimulus, where you go, I get why\n\n518\n00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.440\nwe're doing this, I've bought into it,\nlet me make sure that it goes well,\n\n519\n00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.558\nbecause I see the purpose of it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n520\n00:31:06.558 --> 00:31:08.795\nthere's a lot of people that think well,\nI'm paying you, so\n\n521\n00:31:08.795 --> 00:31:11.001\ntherefore you should come to work and\ndo what I want you to do.\n\n522\n00:31:11.001 --> 00:31:14.830\nAnd you hear people all around say\nit's not just about the money.\n\n523\n00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.540\nBut the fact of the matter is,\n\n524\n00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.700\nIs that it doesn't really matter what\nyou get paid in certain circumstances.\n\n525\n00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.640\nIf you're not bought into it,\nthen you're really, really not going to\n\n526\n00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:31.130\nundertake the work to 100% of your\nsort of effort your motivation and\n\n527\n00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:34.800\nyour commitment so motivate people.\n\n528\n00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.910\nWe've gotta achieve those project\nobjectives within targets that time,\n\n529\n00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.140\ncost, quality, scope,\nbenefits, risk targets, and\n\n530\n00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.150\nwe're gonna look at that in a lot\nmore detail in another episode.\n\n531\n00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.290\nSo the purpose of project\nmanagement is to organize,\n\n532\n00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:54.380\nis to control the work that's\nrequired to do the planning,\n\n533\n00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.730\nthe delegating, the monitoring and\nthe controlling.\n\n534\n00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:03.130\nAnd so a PRINCE2 Project,\nwell, it looks at them.\n\n535\n00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:07.800\nWe just talked about these, the time, the\ncost, scope, the risk, the benefits and\n\n536\n00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.270\nthe quality, and\nwe are going to in our next episode.\n\n537\n00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.250\nThen we're going to get started\non the PRINCE2 environment, and\n\n538\n00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.700\nwe're going to look at\nthe PRINCE2 environment itself.\n\n539\n00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.400\nSo we're gonna be looking at the processes\nand the themes within PRINCE2, but\n\n540\n00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.250\nfor now, I think this has been quite\nenough for everybody to digest for\n\n541\n00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.260\nthis first episode in\nthis particular series.\n\n542\n00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:35.220\nSo I'm gonna ask you to go away and\ndownload your material now, if you haven't\n\n543\n00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.503\nalready done so, because this is\nyour opportunity to print it out or\n\n544\n00:32:39.503 --> 00:32:42.001\nto keep it in PDF and to make notes on it.\n\n545\n00:32:42.001 --> 00:32:47.022\nBut for this particular episode, well,\nthat's all we're gonna cover for now,\n\n546\n00:32:47.022 --> 00:32:51.380\nand we will see you in our next episode.\n&gt;&gt; Well, this has definitely been a fact\n\n547\n00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.870\nfilled episode and\nthis is just the first one, right?\n\n548\n00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.420\nWe learned a little bit about the exam,\na little bit about PRINCE2, and well,\n\n549\n00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.610\nwe have a lot more coming at you,\nso definitely come on back.\n\n550\n00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.530\nBut for this one,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get outta here.\n\n551\n00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.520\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n552\n00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n553\n00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.014\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n554\n00:33:06.014 --> 00:33:13.352\n[MUSIC]\n\n555\n00:33:13.352 --> 00:33:16.204\n&gt;&gt; Thank

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:16.090\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.320\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and\n\n6\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.410\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore PRINCE2 2017 foundation and\n\n7\n00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.980\nin particular in this episode, we're gonna\nbe looking at the PRINCE2 environment.\n\n8\n00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.611\nAnd here to help us along,\nis Ms. Joe Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:27.910\nHow are you doing today, Joe?\n\n10\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Justin.\n\n11\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.120\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.540\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n13\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.870\nNow, we left off talking about\nlike a prints to project,\n\n14\n00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.240\nin the previous episode.\n\n15\n00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.920\nBut now we're going to talk about\nthe environment where that project\n\n16\n00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.520\ntakes place.\n\n17\n00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.220\nOr am I getting too far ahead here?\n\n18\n00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.050\n&gt;&gt; Well, we started off in the previous\nepisode we looked at the concept of\n\n19\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.280\na project.\n\n20\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.010\n&gt;&gt; And we looked at what PRINCE2\nproject management was all about and\n\n21\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.780\nnow we're going to look more\nclosely at the themes and\n\n22\n00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.670\nthe principles of the PRINCE2\nproject environment.\n\n23\n00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.100\nSo, right now in this particular episode\nwe're going to pay very close attention to\n\n24\n00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.450\nthe PRINCE2 environments.\n\n25\n00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.770\nAnd all of the definitions,\n\n26\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.850\nthe terminology that we use when we\nassociate a project with PRINCE2.\n\n27\n00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.040\nSo, if you remember and\n\n28\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.070\nwe're gonna jump straight back in to\nwhere we left off in our last episode.\n\n29\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.560\nBecause where we left off was\nin this particular slide,\n\n30\n00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.800\nwhich was looking at the aspects\nof the PRINCE2 Project.\n\n31\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.950\nThose aspects that had to be managed.\n\n32\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.899\nNow we kind of left it hanging at\nthe end of the last episode and\n\n33\n00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.539\nI wanted to just mention all that\nof these aspects are interrelated.\n\n34\n00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.199\nI didn't used the word interdependent\nbecause they aren't interdependent but\n\n35\n00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:43.020\nthe are interrelated.\n\n36\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.210\nSo let's think about time and\ncost and quality.\n\n37\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.540\nThese are, well, these quite often appear\nin project management in a triangle each.\n\n38\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.060\nJust the three of them\nwhere we have to balance.\n\n39\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.540\nWe have to have a trade off\nbetween time and cost and quality.\n\n40\n00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.800\nBecause quite often and\nthis not cast in stone.\n\n41\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.600\nThis is just a sort of\na generalization here.\n\n42\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.800\nBut quite often, if we want it quicker,\nit's probably going to cost us more money\n\n43\n00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.050\nand we might have to take a hit,\na compromise, on the quality.\n\n44\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.990\nBut if we want higher quality,\nthen again that's\n\n45\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.560\nquite often going to cost us more money,\nbut it might take us longer as well.\n\n46\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.869\nAnd if you want it cheaper,\nthen it might take longer to produce and\n\n47\n00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:35.940\nwe might be taking\nshortcuts on the quality.\n\n48\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.030\nSo, all of these are interrelated.\n\n49\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.830\nWe can not deliver a project\nwithout considering\n\n50\n00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.720\nall of these particular aspects include,\nI heard risk brought into that triangle.\n\n51\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.280\nSo maybe you might want to.\n\n52\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.067\nAnd you can substitute any of these,\n\n53\n00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:53.730\ninto that particular triangle and\ninto that balance.\n\n54\n00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.800\nAnd then we got to think about\nour tolerances, tolerances is.\n\n55\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.140\nWhat do you think of when\nyou hear the word tolerance.\n\n56\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.010\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking an acceptable\nvariation from like a criteria or a.\n\n57\n00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.660\nFor me I actually think\nof physical measurements.\n\n58\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.380\nI'm like I can this measure to ten\nmillimeter plus or minus one millimeter.\n\n59\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you using that plus or minus\nthere when you talk about a tolerance.\n\n60\n00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.030\nThat's what we're talking about,\nwe are really talking about the acceptable\n\n61\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.810\nsort of levels within which\nthe project could be delivered.\n\n62\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.140\nSo, let's think about, for\ninstance, browsing a website.\n\n63\n00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.160\nIf we were browsing a website,\nthen an acceptable tolerance would be\n\n64\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.380\nI want it to be displayed\nwithin 0.0 five seconds.\n\n65\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.600\nPlus or minus 0.1 of a second.\n\n66\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.230\nSo that would be what we considered\nto be an acceptably tolerance.\n\n67\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.700\nSo when we are defining the project and\n\n68\n00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.600\nwhen we are defining what it is that\nwe're actually going to deliver.\n\n69\n00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.610\nThen it would be within\nthat particular tolerance.\n\n70\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.050\nAnd that particular tolerance would\nbe a quality tolerance, for instance.\n\n71\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.920\nNow, there could be tolerances\nin terms of cost as well.\n\n72\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.320\nI want to come in roughly\nround about half a million.\n\n73\n00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.170\nWhether it's half million pounds or\ndollars or euros.\n\n74\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.580\nIt doesn't really make any difference.\n\n75\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.070\nBut you might say, I want it to come in\naround about a half a million, give or\n\n76\n00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.950\ntake 10,000 for instance.\n\n77\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.050\nThat would be our tolerances.\n\n78\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.730\nSo would you document these?\n\n79\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.400\n&gt;&gt; I would absolutely document these.\n\n80\n00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.904\nBecause then it keeps it from going\n\n81\n00:04:37.904 --> 00:04:43.240\nI thought you said 0.1\nversus .01 versus 0.5.\n\n82\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.230\nYou need to make sure there is some.\n\n83\n00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.750\nDurable and common, I guess proof,\nfor lack of a better word.\n\n84\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.280\n&gt;&gt; Right and this is,\nwe're gonna talk in a later episode,\n\n85\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.090\nwe wanna talk about the business case.\n\n86\n00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.810\nBut this is something that\nhas to be documented.\n\n87\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.090\nAll of your tolerance, whether it's\nthe tolerance to do with cost,\n\n88\n00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.070\nwhether it's the tolerance\nto do with quality.\n\n89\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.150\nOr whether it's the tolerance\nto do with risks or\n\n90\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.190\nbenefits, they should be documented.\n\n91\n00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.970\nBecause as Justin says, you want proof.\n\n92\n00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.590\nNow I'm not talking about proof\nbecause you want to sort of,\n\n93\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.550\nsee, I told you so,\nat the end of a project.\n\n94\n00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.470\nOr I knew it was gonna\ncome in over budget.\n\n95\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.120\nThat's not what we're talking about.\n\n96\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.300\nBut we want to know what the end user and\n\n97\n00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.510\nwhat the customer will accept,\nas an acceptable solution.\n\n98\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.580\nThere is absolutely no point in\nme delivering a financial system,\n\n99\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.570\nI talked about an Oracle\ndatabase in our last episode.\n\n100\n00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.310\nThere is no point in me\ndelivering an Oracle database\n\n101\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.680\nif it doesn't allow me to\nadd two numbers together.\n\n102\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.100\nOr it doesn't allow me to associate\nan invoice with a particular client,\n\n103\n00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.410\nfor instance.\n\n104\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.360\nThere was absolutely no point to\nme having that Oracle database.\n\n105\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.850\nSo we have to have acceptable tolerances.\n\n106\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.640\nAnd it has to be documented,\nit has to be defined.\n\n107\n00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.910\nThere's absolutely no reason why we just\nsaid, well, I want an Oracle database.\n\n108\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.000\nAnd that would be it,\nyou know, full stop, period.\n\n109\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.030\nBecause we need to understand what it is\n\n110\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.040\nthat the Oracle database is supposed\nto achieve within that organization.\n\n111\n00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.390\nAnd we need to understand the tolerances.\n\n112\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.670\nThe amount of leniency\nwe're going to give that\n\n113\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.090\nparticular, that particular piece\nof software, we had a Moscow.\n\n114\n00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Moscow like Russia?\n\n115\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I mean that's where it\ncomes from but have you heard of Moscow?\n\n116\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.670\n&gt;&gt; I've heard the place but I feel like\nthat's not we [LAUGH] were talking about.\n\n117\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.888\n&gt;&gt; No, we're not talking\nabout I've never been there.\n\n118\n00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:46.523\nSo no.\n&gt;&gt; Me either.\n\n119\n00:06:46.523 --> 00:06:48.720\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about that no.\n\n120\n00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.970\nIt looks really pretty though.\n\n121\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.770\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n122\n00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.650\nIt does.\n\n123\n00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.141\n&gt;&gt; MOSCO, must have,\nshould have, could have and\n\n124\n00:06:56.141 --> 00:07:00.760\n[INAUDIBLE] won't have right now,\nor would like for the future.\n\n125\n00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.490\nWe use the term, MOSCO when we're\ndefining our requirements and\n\n126\n00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.210\nwe'll talk about this in a lot more\ndepth again, in another episode.\n\n127\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.783\nBut project should meet right about 80%,\n\n128\n00:07:14.783 --> 00:07:20.300\nI mean, we'll tell you at least\n80% of your must have requirement.\n\n129\n00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.360\nAnd that's within the tolerances and then\nit's up to you to decide on your should\n\n130\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.930\nhaves, your could haves and\nyour would haves.\n\n131\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.750\nBut essentially what we are expecting\nour customers to do and\n\n132\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.480\nour business relationship managers and\nbusiness analysts\n\n133\n00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.550\nwill be doing this in conjunction\nwith our customer organization.\n\n134\n00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.620\nWe're expecting them to detail\nexactly what they must have,\n\n135\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.900\nwhat they should have as part of that\nbudget delivery and what they could have.\n\n136\n00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.287\nAnd what they won't have right now, but\nwhat they might like for the future.\n\n137\n00:07:50.287 --> 00:07:52.709\nNow, he's thinking maybe he's\nthinking about a dream to-\n\n138\n00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:53.533\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm thinking-\n\n139\n00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:54.861\n&gt;&gt; Visit Moscow, for instance.\n\n140\n00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:56.598\n&gt;&gt; Must have versus should have.\n\n141\n00:07:56.598 --> 00:07:57.624\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n142\n00:07:57.624 --> 00:08:01.644\n&gt;&gt; What is the delineation\nbetween those two?\n\n143\n00:08:01.644 --> 00:08:06.591\nSo a must have is, the project is not\ncomplete, unless it has these things.\n\n144\n00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:11.985\nShould have, I'm guessing it has\nsome variability build-in to it.\n\n145\n00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:14.133\nI'm trying to reconcile\nthe difference between those two.\n\n146\n00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:19.891\n&gt;&gt; I think of the way I would generally\nword that to people is, think about it.\n\n147\n00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:24.388\nIf it's not a show stopper, if it's\na show stopper, if you can't have it,\n\n148\n00:08:24.388 --> 00:08:28.841\nthen the project's not complete and\nthat should be on your must have list.\n\n149\n00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:33.392\nIf it's not a show stopper, then it\nshouldn't be on your must have list.\n\n150\n00:08:33.392 --> 00:08:35.594\nIt should be on your should have list.\n\n151\n00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:38.834\nIf it's something that it's okay,\nI'll have it in the next release,\n\n152\n00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:42.640\nthen that should be on your should\nhave list Note on your must have list.\n\n153\n00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.620\nLet's think about this and\n\n154\n00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.740\nI'm just trying to think of an example\nstraight off the top of my head.\n\n155\n00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.684\nLet's say that we were creating or\n\n156\n00:08:50.684 --> 00:08:55.718\nwe were rolling out, deploying some ATMs.\n\n157\n00:08:55.718 --> 00:09:00.756\nATMs, automatic teller machines known as\ncash points in some places of the world.\n\n158\n00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:06.547\nIf we were deploying ATMs, what would\nbe on the must-have list for an ATM?\n\n159\n00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:08.443\n&gt;&gt; It must be able to dispense money.\n\n160\n00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:13.615\nIt must be able to verify\na person's card identity.\n\n161\n00:09:13.615 --> 00:09:18.457\nIt must be able to store money,\nand it must be secure.\n\n162\n00:09:20.397 --> 00:09:22.449\nI feel like there's another one there.\n\n163\n00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:27.146\nIt must be able to interact\nwith some kind of merchant\n\n164\n00:09:27.146 --> 00:09:31.552\nservice to where I can charge you for\nyour usage.\n\n165\n00:09:31.552 --> 00:09:32.993\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz otherwise,\n\n166\n00:09:32.993 --> 00:09:34.982\nI'm just giving away free money.\n\n167\n00:09:34.982 --> 00:09:40.427\n&gt;&gt; Now then, so if that's your must haves,\nwhat about your should haves?\n\n168\n00:09:40.427 --> 00:09:44.477\nWhat other things do you think to\nyourself well, you should have this, but\n\n169\n00:09:44.477 --> 00:09:45.709\nit's not necessary.\n\n170\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:52.100\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a camera in order to\ncatch the images of individuals.\n\n171\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.613\nI don't know what about should haves.\n\n172\n00:09:58.613 --> 00:10:01.302\nSeems like you might have been in\nthe ATM business and I haven't been.\n\n173\n00:10:01.302 --> 00:10:05.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've never actually deployed\nany ATM, but what I can tell you.\n\n174\n00:10:05.842 --> 00:10:07.842\nIf we look at say, for instance, so\n\n175\n00:10:07.842 --> 00:10:11.601\nour must haves would be as you said\nit must be able to dispense cash.\n\n176\n00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:13.751\nSo it must be able to store cash.\n\n177\n00:10:13.751 --> 00:10:18.000\nIt must be able to verify that\nperson is who they say they are.\n\n178\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.236\nIt must be able to I don't know\nwhat else that they you say, well,\n\n179\n00:10:22.236 --> 00:10:25.563\nit must be secure right\nhave security on there too.\n\n180\n00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:29.736\nBut in terms of should have, these are\ncorner not necessarily the nice to have,\n\n181\n00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:30.931\nbut what it should do.\n\n182\n00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:32.500\nIt should have a camera.\n\n183\n00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.642\nBut if it doesn't,\nare you going to delay the rollout?\n\n184\n00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:41.091\n&gt;&gt; As long as it has,\nwe have some means of securing it.\n\n185\n00:10:41.091 --> 00:10:44.491\nSome means of storing cached\nverifying identity and\n\n186\n00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:49.213\nwhether that be through internet\nconnectivity, I think that's fine.\n\n187\n00:10:49.213 --> 00:10:50.751\nBeing able to capture imagines.\n\n188\n00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:52.984\nYeah, it'd be nice.\n\n189\n00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:57.448\n&gt;&gt; And that's the question that we have\nto have to have in project management at\n\n190\n00:10:57.448 --> 00:11:01.092\nthe start of a project is,\nis this going to delay deployment?\n\n191\n00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:05.051\nIf it's going to delay deployment,\nif we're not going to deploy,\n\n192\n00:11:05.051 --> 00:11:08.602\nunless we have it,\nthen that should be on our must have list.\n\n193\n00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:13.482\nIf it's not gonna delay deployment, things\nlike it should be a drive through ATM and\n\n194\n00:11:13.482 --> 00:11:18.156\nthat's something that we have very unique\nin the US that I don't think I've seen\n\n195\n00:11:18.156 --> 00:11:19.823\nanywhere else in the world.\n\n196\n00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:24.906\nSo it should be a drive through ATM,\nbut is it gonna delay deployment if\n\n197\n00:11:24.906 --> 00:11:29.922\nsomebody's gotta park their car and\nget out and then walk to the ATM?\n\n198\n00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:30.821\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't think so.\n\n199\n00:11:30.821 --> 00:11:34.191\nI mean,\nif you're in a major metropolitan area,\n\n200\n00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:36.932\nthat is probably what's gonna happen.\n\n201\n00:11:36.932 --> 00:11:39.240\n&gt;&gt; So there, so it depends where it is.\n\n202\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.888\nAnd so\nbecause we're using that word depends,\n\n203\n00:11:41.888 --> 00:11:45.273\nthen it's probably going to\nappear on the should have list.\n\n204\n00:11:45.273 --> 00:11:50.190\nUnless we're in a high crime area where\nit's more secure to how it is a drive\n\n205\n00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.482\nthru, then it would appear\non the must have list.\n\n206\n00:11:53.482 --> 00:11:55.242\nThere's also some variables\nthat come into it.\n\n207\n00:11:55.242 --> 00:11:58.090\nBut ultimately,\nit's the customer's decision.\n\n208\n00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.852\nIt's the user's decision.\n\n209\n00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:02.538\nIt is not our decision and that's\nsomething else that's really important\n\n210\n00:12:02.538 --> 00:12:06.650\nto remember that when it comes to managing\na project, we are here to deliver value.\n\n211\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:13.242\nWe are here to deliver what we call\na product to the organization.\n\n212\n00:12:13.242 --> 00:12:15.670\nIt's up to them to tell\nus what they want to see.\n\n213\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.569\nIt is not up to us to decide what\nwe're going to give to them.\n\n214\n00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:22.802\nIt's up to them to tell us what they want.\n\n215\n00:12:22.802 --> 00:12:27.220\nIt's not our decision, it's theirs and\nthat's the important part of this.\n\n216\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.500\nSo I talked about the prints\nto environment or\n\n217\n00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.461\nI mentioned it right at the very\nstart of this particular episode.\n\n218\n00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.821\nAnd I said, we were going to\ntake a closer look at this.\n\n219\n00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:40.601\nAnd this is what is going to come up\nin our, well, all of our subsequent\n\n220\n00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:45.960\nepisodes is we're going to be looking at\neach one of these in a greater detail.\n\n221\n00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.774\nWe're going to be looking at what\nwe call the PRINCE2 processes and\n\n222\n00:12:51.774 --> 00:12:55.761\nthe themes, and the principles of PRINCE2.\n\n223\n00:12:55.761 --> 00:13:01.164\nThe first thing though, that I want\nto mention is that each one of these,\n\n224\n00:13:01.164 --> 00:13:06.674\neverything with in PRINCE2 should be\ntailored to suit the environment.\n\n225\n00:13:06.674 --> 00:13:10.751\nSo let's think about the reasons\nwhy we should tailor.\n\n226\n00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:13.859\nIt says here that Taylor who\nhappens to be our director and\n\n227\n00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:19.090\nhe's absolutely wonderful, but that's\nnot the Taylor that we're talking about.\n\n228\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.713\nNot in this particular episode, anyway.\n\n229\n00:13:21.713 --> 00:13:26.883\nTailor, to tailor means\nto adapt a method or\n\n230\n00:13:26.883 --> 00:13:30.665\nprocess to suit the situation.\n\n231\n00:13:30.665 --> 00:13:35.392\nSo here in PRINCE2,\nwe are tailoring everything.\n\n232\n00:13:35.392 --> 00:13:36.546\nWe tailor in our processes.\n\n233\n00:13:36.546 --> 00:13:38.350\nWe are tailoring our environment.\n\n234\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.962\nWe tailor in our principle.\n\n235\n00:13:40.962 --> 00:13:42.530\nYou have to ask the question why.\n\n236\n00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.112\nWhy would we do that?\n\n237\n00:13:45.112 --> 00:13:50.887\nWell, we have to tailor to\nthe output that we want to deliver,\n\n238\n00:13:50.887 --> 00:13:54.343\nthe product that we want to deliver.\n\n239\n00:13:54.343 --> 00:13:59.279\nThere is absolutely no point\nin me having a process and\n\n240\n00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:06.642\na set of processes that focus purely on\nthe GUI, the graphical user interface.\n\n241\n00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:11.456\nYeah, the sort of the user's ability\nto interface with a particular\n\n242\n00:14:11.456 --> 00:14:14.951\nproduct with a particular\nnew piece of software.\n\n243\n00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:19.456\nIf actually what we're delivering is\nsomething that's gonna sit on the back-end\n\n244\n00:14:19.456 --> 00:14:22.880\nand is gonna be accessed by only\nour IT techie people, anyway.\n\n245\n00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:29.243\nSo we want to make sure that\nthe project itself meets the needs of\n\n246\n00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:30.790\nthe organization.\n\n247\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.540\nAnd therefore,\nthat the mechanisms that we use to\n\n248\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.133\ndeliver that project are tailored towards\nnot just the needs of the organization.\n\n249\n00:14:38.133 --> 00:14:41.723\nBut also who we are as\nan organization too,\n\n250\n00:14:41.723 --> 00:14:46.831\nas an IT service provider organization,\nas an IT provider.\n\n251\n00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:50.830\nSo things like we've got a take\ninto consideration are skills.\n\n252\n00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:57.422\nWhat skills do we have in-house and\nwhat skills will we need to outsource?\n\n253\n00:14:57.422 --> 00:15:02.661\nWe may even outsource the entire project\nin which case then we're looking for\n\n254\n00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:05.732\nsomebody who can manage\nthe entire project.\n\n255\n00:15:05.732 --> 00:15:07.330\nSo we may be, well,\n\n256\n00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:14.020\nsimply asking somebody else to take\nover the ownership of that project.\n\n257\n00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.353\nWe still retain accountability for\nit, though.\n\n258\n00:15:16.353 --> 00:15:19.802\nBut therefore, the way that we\nmanage the project will be tailored.\n\n259\n00:15:19.802 --> 00:15:24.103\nBecause we will be managing it\nfrom a very contractual basis.\n\n260\n00:15:24.103 --> 00:15:29.044\nWe'll be looking at our contract and\nensuring that our contract without\n\n261\n00:15:29.044 --> 00:15:33.013\nexternal vendor meets the needs\nof the organization, and\n\n262\n00:15:33.013 --> 00:15:38.683\nthat it also remember our tolerances from\nour previous slide that it also considers\n\n263\n00:15:38.683 --> 00:15:43.550\nall of those aspects, a nd allows us\nto flexibly manage those aspects.\n\n264\n00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.640\nWe have to bring in,\nI mentioned the term flexible there.\n\n265\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.823\nWe have to be able to be flexible\nwhen we're delivering our product.\n\n266\n00:15:51.823 --> 00:15:54.037\nYou've heard the term scout creep?\n\n267\n00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:57.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have been a part of many\n\n268\n00:15:57.825 --> 00:16:02.617\na projects that have indeterminant Ongoing\nscope, it'd be nice to just put that, no,\n\n269\n00:16:02.617 --> 00:16:05.723\nI don't wanna do that but\nit was coming from higher up, so\n\n270\n00:16:05.723 --> 00:16:08.380\nI didn't get to make the decision.\n\n271\n00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.040\n&gt;&gt; We call it shifting goalposts.\n\n272\n00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.390\nThat's basically what it is.\n\n273\n00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.640\nThe goalposts shift\nmidway through a project.\n\n274\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.630\n&gt;&gt; It felt like I was running for the goal\nline but somehow there as like a change in\n\n275\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.850\nphysics and then the goal line\nwas always ever farther away.\n\n276\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.020\nIf you're working on a project,\n\n277\n00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:32.250\nit is not necessarily the greatest feeling\nto have those creeping requirements.\n\n278\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.710\n&gt;&gt; No, it's quite funny because a lot\nof people will consider that agile,\n\n279\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.740\nthan if we use an agile methodology,\nthen agile will\n\n280\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.020\nallow us to have scope creep and\nallow us to shift our goalpost.\n\n281\n00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.680\nBut that's not the case at all.\n\n282\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.338\nWhat Agile allows us to do is\nactually deliver the project in\n\n283\n00:16:49.338 --> 00:16:54.896\nincremental chunks but\nwe're still delivering the same end goal.\n\n284\n00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:57.900\nAnd so,\nwhat else we've got to be flexible here,\n\n285\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.090\nespecially if we're talking about\na waterfall approach and by the way,\n\n286\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:07.560\nwe do have another series on Agile and\nPRINCE2 and the interaction between them.\n\n287\n00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.240\nSo whether we use in a traditional\nwaterfall approach or\n\n288\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.050\nwhether we are using an agile based\napproach, we still need to ensure that\n\n289\n00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:19.920\nthe project is tailored to meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n290\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.250\nNow, if we're using\nan Agile-based approach,\n\n291\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:27.950\nthen we have to be tailored to deliver\nthe project, well, in bite-sized chunks.\n\n292\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:32.300\nWe have to be tailored to be able\nto release on a regular basis.\n\n293\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.110\nIn a waterfall approach,\n\n294\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:39.400\nthen we have to be tailored to meet\nthe schedules of the organization.\n\n295\n00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.360\nWe have to tailored to meet\nthe time that's been given to us.\n\n296\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.650\nThe timeline and the cost, the money\nthat's being given to us as well.\n\n297\n00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.090\nWe also, as I mentioned, tailor to meet\nthe skills of our organization and\n\n298\n00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.110\ntailor to meet the size\nof the organization.\n\n299\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.235\nI had a discussion earlier on today,\nactually, with somebody about red tape.\n\n300\n00:18:00.235 --> 00:18:04.460\n[LAUGH]\nWe love red tape, don't we?\n\n301\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.257\n&gt;&gt; It's probably one of\nmy favorite pasttimes.\n\n302\n00:18:06.257 --> 00:18:10.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're trying to navigate\nyour way around the endless bureacracy?\n\n303\n00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was like I got caught in the\nmiddle of a corn field in Field of Dreams\n\n304\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.465\nand then I never found my wayout.\n\n305\n00:18:16.465 --> 00:18:20.564\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nI quite often feel like that sometimes.\n\n306\n00:18:20.564 --> 00:18:24.100\nAnd yeah, we don't want that.\n\n307\n00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.890\nWe won't remember efficiency.\n\n308\n00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.470\nWe want effectiveness with\nour project delivery.\n\n309\n00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.410\nAnd so, we want to make sure that\nwe can tailor our processes,\n\n310\n00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:38.180\nwe keep it simple and\nthat we tailor them to meet our needs\n\n311\n00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.790\nbut we don't tailor them to meet\nthe bureaucratic requirements, okay?\n\n312\n00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.140\nWe don't want bureaucracy.\n\n313\n00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:51.800\nWe don't just want a process just\nbecause we want to tick a box.\n\n314\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.880\nOkay, that's not the reason\nto have a process.\n\n315\n00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.010\nAnd the process, well,\nit's a structured set of activities.\n\n316\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.040\nAnd we have to have processes\nthat achieve something.\n\n317\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.460\nNot that they're just there because\nwe think that we should have them.\n\n318\n00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.360\nSo every single one of these themes\nas we call them in front of us,\n\n319\n00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.790\nall of these need to be tailored including\nour organization, including the quality,\n\n320\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.000\nthe plans.\n\n321\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.580\nNow, where ever we've\nused a diagram like this,\n\n322\n00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.910\nwe've taken them straight\nout of the PRINCE2 book.\n\n323\n00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.030\nThese are the official Accelos books and\nwe'll talk more about those,\n\n324\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:30.640\nmore about that book as we\nmove through our episodes and\n\n325\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.650\nin our overeview as well, I also mentioned\nabout the official PRINCE2 book and\n\n326\n00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.940\nof course,\nthis is an accredited course and this\n\n327\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.390\nparticular test that you will be taking\nis obviously an accredited test as well.\n\n328\n00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.020\nSo all of the material that we're using,\n\n329\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.170\nI just wanna mention that,\nthis comes straight out of the books.\n\n330\n00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.320\nBut where I have used these\ndiagrams that I'm gonna try and\n\n331\n00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.090\nexplain them as best as I can for you.\n\n332\n00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.360\nSo these are our themes.\n\n333\n00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.470\nBut following on from our themes,\nwe also have our PRINCE2 Principles.\n\n334\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.690\nAnd these are over on\nthe right-hand side there.\n\n335\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.400\nWhich is that focus on products,\n\n336\n00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.720\nmanaging by exception, managing by stages,\nlearning from experience.\n\n337\n00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.870\nAnd all of those principles will\nactually help us to tailor.\n\n338\n00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:22.130\nWe have to tailor our themes and\nwe have to tailor our processes.\n\n339\n00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.190\nAnd so we're going to use\nthese principles, as I say,\n\n340\n00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.800\nto help us with that.\n\n341\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.250\nSo, when it comes to, let's just\nsay we want to take the themes and\n\n342\n00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.590\nthe principles together.\n\n343\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.020\nSo let's just say we take\na look at the business case.\n\n344\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:40.901\nAnd we want to tailor the business case\nto ensure that it focuses on products.\n\n345\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:48.160\nWhat does means is then, our business case\nshould look, should ensure that, not only\n\n346\n00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.030\nare we being able to justify, remember\nthat ROI, that we turn on investment.\n\n347\n00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:58.970\nWe look that at so\nmany of our other series, that ROI,\n\n348\n00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.630\nreturn on investment, is something that\nhas to appear in our business case.\n\n349\n00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:06.700\nBut we should ensure that we\nfocus on our products as well.\n\n350\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.930\nIn our business case,\n\n351\n00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:12.990\nwe identify what our product should\nlook like, remember our must-go list.\n\n352\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.120\nWe identify exactly what it is our\n\n353\n00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.350\norganization require and\nlet's think about our plans then.\n\n354\n00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:27.590\nOur plans, well we should tailor our plans\nto scale, the scale of the organization.\n\n355\n00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:32.640\nTailor to suit the product environment,\nthe project environment.\n\n356\n00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.180\nIn other words, how we're going to\ndeliver that particular project.\n\n357\n00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.368\nIt also should be tailored to meet\nour roles and responsibilities\n\n358\n00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:46.852\nthat we will be defining in our AC\nmatrices for all of our activities.\n\n359\n00:21:46.852 --> 00:21:52.740\nThere is an element of tailoring\nin absolutely everything.\n\n360\n00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.414\nAnd so\nas we move through this particular series,\n\n361\n00:21:56.414 --> 00:22:02.361\nI want you to consider that what we're\ngoing to be doing in every single episode,\n\n362\n00:22:02.361 --> 00:22:06.560\nis we're gonna be focusing\non the best practice.\n\n363\n00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.260\nWe're gonna be focusing on\nwhat's in the PRINCE2 book.\n\n364\n00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:16.700\nBut remember, best practice is what has\nworked in a number of organizations.\n\n365\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.770\nAnd it is what is proven to work.\n\n366\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.220\nBest practice is not plug and play.\n\n367\n00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.370\nThis is not a one size fits all approach.\n\n368\n00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.820\nAnd this is not something that you\ncan simply take out of the book and\n\n369\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.220\napply to your organization.\n\n370\n00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:36.030\nAbsolutely everything in PRINCE2,\nneeds to be tailored to the project.\n\n371\n00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.650\nEverything and\nthere's nothing exempt from this.\n\n372\n00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:45.080\nSo as we move through each particular\nepisode, we're going to be looking\n\n373\n00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:50.280\nmore in depth at the tailoring aspects and\nexactly what we could tailor for\n\n374\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.970\na particular theme and for\neach process and for each principle.\n\n375\n00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.042\nAnd how we could tailor that.\n\n376\n00:22:57.042 --> 00:23:01.990\nSo for this particular episode, we've just\ntaken a very brief look at the aspects and\n\n377\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.546\nthe themes and the principles of PRINCE2.\n\n378\n00:23:04.546 --> 00:23:08.177\nAnd when we come back,\nwe are going to, in our next episode,\n\n379\n00:23:08.177 --> 00:23:12.900\nwe're gonna be taking a more in depth\nlook at up PRINCE2 project principles.\n\n380\n00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.030\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo, this is definitely something\nthat I need to get a little better at,\n\n381\n00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:21.060\nso I'm gonna have to come on back for\nthat next episode and you should as well.\n\n382\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.900\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n383\n00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.840\nSo signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison,\n\n384\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacot.\n\n385\n00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.586\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n386\n00:23:28.586 --> 00:23:34.534\n[MUSIC]\n\n387\n00:23:34.534 --> 00:23:38.166\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

episode of ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.540\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n7\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.770\nwe're continuing on with our\nPRINCE2 2017 foundation series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.330\nAnd well, this is like part two\non our PRINCE2 environment.\n\n9\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.160\nIf you have ever seen part one,\ndefinitely go check that out and\n\n10\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.260\nhere to help us along to further expand\non the prints two environment is well,\n\n11\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.640\nthe one and only Ms.\nJo Peacock, how you doing today Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.900\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great,\nthank you Justin, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.606\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and well there's\na lot to unpack with the PRINCE2\n\n14\n00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.710\nenvironment, so,\nwhere are we going from here?\n\n15\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're going to carry on.\n\n16\n00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.690\nWe're in a Part 2,\nas you've already said and\n\n17\n00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.440\nwe're going to carry on looking\nat our project environment.\n\n18\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.440\nNow, just a quick recap\nover our previous episode.\n\n19\n00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.480\nIn our previous episode, we actually\nlooked at this particular diagram which\n\n20\n00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.250\ncame from the official PRINCE2 book.\n\n21\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.040\nAnd we talked about tailoring in our\nlast episode but in that episode,\n\n22\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.960\nwe introduced the PRINCE2 environment.\n\n23\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.330\nAnd the PRINCE2 environment\nis made up of processes,\n\n24\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.480\nwhich we're going to address\nin subsequent episodes.\n\n25\n00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.690\nIt's also made up with our themes and\nour principles.\n\n26\n00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.680\nAnd then, we took a look at this diagram,\nwhich I, it's one I really, really like,\n\n27\n00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.860\nwhere we kind of took the top\noff our PRINCE2 themes and\n\n28\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.260\nwe looked at our principles.\n\n29\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.020\nAnd in this particular Episode, we're\ngoing to carry on and we're just going to\n\n30\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.433\nexplore those principles and those\nthemes in just a little bit more depth.\n\n31\n00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:42.576\nNow, bearing in mind, this is still\nour introduction to PRINCE2 2017.\n\n32\n00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:47.553\nThis is not an in depth look and we're\ngoing to be looking at each one of these\n\n33\n00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:52.140\nin a lot more depth,\na little bit later in subsequent episodes.\n\n34\n00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.470\nSo we're going to be looking\nat all the requirements for\n\n35\n00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.840\nall of these in subsequent episodes.\n\n36\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.720\nBut what we're going to do right now,\nis we're literally\n\n37\n00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.030\ngoing to just take a quick glance at\nthe principles and the themes, etc.\n\n38\n00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.890\nSo let's start out by\nlooking at our principles.\n\n39\n00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.930\nAnd as you've seen here, our principles\nwhat was in the last diagram, I\n\n40\n00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.850\nwas just trying to get the right word for\nthat up there, that was diagram, it was.\n\n41\n00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.650\nWe've got here,\ncontinued business justification.\n\n42\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.020\nJust a quick word.\n\n43\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.940\nHow long do you think\na PRINCE2 project will take?\n\n44\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna make a complete guess,\nnine months.\n\n45\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.016\n&gt;&gt; There's no right answer to that.\n\n46\n00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.103\nI mean,\nI just deliberately try to trip him up.\n\n47\n00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:39.530\n&gt;&gt; There you go with those\ntrick questions again.\n\n48\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.155\nHow long does it take until it's done?\n\n49\n00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:42.438\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n50\n00:02:42.438 --> 00:02:44.942\nyeah, that's about\nthe right answer actually.\n\n51\n00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:48.946\nYeah, no, a PRINCE2,\nyou should just turn around and say,\n\n52\n00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:51.365\nas long as it takes, really, yeah.\n\n53\n00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:53.150\nThe Prince2 project,\n\n54\n00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.190\nI don't expect the Prince2 project\nto take three months, by the way.\n\n55\n00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.020\nIf you are looking at a three month\nproject, it's probably going to be a very,\n\n56\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.360\nvery small scale project.\n\n57\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.020\nIn which case, then tailoring\nwould be very, very extreme.\n\n58\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.200\nSo, unless you've got a really\ngood set of sound principles and\n\n59\n00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.440\nsound themes and consistency and\na methodology already in place.\n\n60\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.640\nAnd then perhaps for\nsomething like 3 months,\n\n61\n00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.950\nyou might just be looking at using\nChange Management to manage that change.\n\n62\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.660\nBut throughout the length\nof a PRINCE2 project and\n\n63\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.400\nit doesn't matter how\nlong it is going to take.\n\n64\n00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.980\nWhether it's going to take a year, whether\nit's going to take 18 months, two years.\n\n65\n00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.380\nThroughout the project,\nyou need to maintain these principles and\n\n66\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.170\nthat includes this first one.\n\n67\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.090\nContinued, there's a clue in that word,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.700\nContinued business justification.\n\n69\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.270\nI'm gonna ask Justin this question.\n\n70\n00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.280\nI don't why I'm gonna ask him this\nquestion because I dread to think what\n\n71\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.560\nthe answer's gonna be.\n\n72\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.420\nBut Justin,\nhave you ever started something and\n\n73\n00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.430\nthen wondered halfway through\nwhy on Earth you're doing it?\n\n74\n00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.170\n&gt;&gt; Most conversations that I start.\n\n75\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.870\nYeah, it's pretty common place for me but\n\n76\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.160\nI've been in projects like this where you\nget part of the way into the project and\n\n77\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.240\nthen someone goes,\nwhat are we really doing here, anyway?\n\n78\n00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.400\nWe've lost sight of the entire impetus for\nthe project.\n\n79\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.160\n&gt;&gt; Point, the fact to the matter is\nthat life changes, business changes,\n\n80\n00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.210\nyour organization changes.\n\n81\n00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.420\nAnd the longer the project life span,\n\n82\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.210\nthe longer we are expecting to\nhave this project up and running.\n\n83\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.850\nThen the more chance there is of the goals\n\n84\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.260\npotentially moving and\nof the justification changing.\n\n85\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.230\nIn other words, what seemed like\ngood Idea right at the very start,\n\n86\n00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.530\nmight not be a good idea six\nmonths into the project.\n\n87\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.140\nYou never know.\n\n88\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.000\nThe organization will probably change.\n\n89\n00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.250\nMaybe there's some mergers.\n\n90\n00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.820\nMaybe there's some acquisitions.\n\n91\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.330\nMaybe there's some growth or\nmaybe there's been a complete change and\n\n92\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.240\nthere's actually less people there\nthan what you originally anticipated.\n\n93\n00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.630\nMaybe the budget's decreased.\n\n94\n00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.060\nMaybe the budget's increased.\n\n95\n00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.330\nMaybe you've got and\nchange in regulations or\n\n96\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.810\nchange in the ethics of the organization.\n\n97\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.530\nIt doesn't matter what change is.\n\n98\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.840\nIn the real world environment,\n\n99\n00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.500\nyou need to have continued justification\nthroughout the length of the project.\n\n100\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.628\nThroughout the duration of the project.\n\n101\n00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:28.850\nWhich means, that on a regular basis,\n\n102\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.410\nwe need to be verifying\nthat we are still on track.\n\n103\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.710\nNot only to achieve ROI from the project\nreturn on that investment but\n\n104\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.320\nthat it's actually a viable project,\nthat the business still wanted.\n\n105\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.820\nI've seen a lot of projects that have\nhappened in some very, very large\n\n106\n00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.680\norganizations where we didn't continue\nto check the business justification.\n\n107\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.970\nAnd business needs change and\nthat project becomes well, obsolete.\n\n108\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.220\nAnd it becomes obsolete halfway through.\n\n109\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.590\nBut don't worry cuz PRNCE2 has\ngot a way of dealing with that.\n\n110\n00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.600\nBut nevertheless, you've still\ngot to maintain justification.\n\n111\n00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.530\nYou've got to still ask yourself,\nwhy are we doing this and\n\n112\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.120\nwe carry on doing that\nthroughout the project.\n\n113\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.795\nYou're looking very pensive there Justin.\n\n114\n00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:24.350\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm just trying to think about\nwhat's an appropriate frequency but\n\n115\n00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.455\nthen I thought to myself, it depends.\n\n116\n00:06:26.455 --> 00:06:29.567\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess, based on the respective\n\n117\n00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:33.806\ntimeline of the project itself and\nhow frequently or\n\n118\n00:06:33.806 --> 00:06:38.719\nhow much the project could be\naffected by internal changes,\n\n119\n00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.824\nI guess could also be another factor.\n\n120\n00:06:41.824 --> 00:06:44.780\nSo, I kind of answered my own question but\nthat is what I was thinking about.\n\n121\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.041\n&gt;&gt; We'll take a look at the, if we go\nhalfway down this particular slide,\n\n122\n00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.105\nyou'll see that we talk\nabout managing by stages.\n\n123\n00:06:52.105 --> 00:06:54.875\nAnd then, of course, at the bottom\nwe talk about tailoring again.\n\n124\n00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:57.035\nTailoring to suit the project environment.\n\n125\n00:06:57.035 --> 00:07:03.180\nAnd the fact of the matter is what you've\njust said about the length of the project.\n\n126\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.610\nWell, we wanna chunk the project\nup into manageable stages and\n\n127\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.100\nwe'll talk about that in\na little bit more depth.\n\n128\n00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.580\nBut manageable stages means\nthat on a regular basis,\n\n129\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.260\nwe're going to be performing\ncertain chunks of work.\n\n130\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.740\nAnd as we perform these\ncertain chunks of work,\n\n131\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.550\nwe've still got to ask ourselves,\nis this an appropriate time to say okay,\n\n132\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.040\nare we still doing what we need to do,\nis this still the right thing to do?\n\n133\n00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.930\nSo we should be doing\nthat within each stage.\n\n134\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.617\nSo, to answer the question\nabout how often,\n\n135\n00:07:36.617 --> 00:07:41.572\nwe'll we're still having that sort of\nwell, it depends answer but we're getting\n\n136\n00:07:41.572 --> 00:07:46.770\na little more specific because we're\ntalking about each individual stage.\n\n137\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.890\nAnd during each stage, we want to\nbe continuing to ask the question,\n\n138\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.889\nis this project still relevant?\n\n139\n00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:59.024\nAre we still delivering what we need to do\ndeliver to meet the needs of the business?\n\n140\n00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:02.371\nAnd of course we're brining that to\nlearn from experience as well and.\n\n141\n00:08:02.371 --> 00:08:05.444\nNone of these should be\ntreated in isolation?\n\n142\n00:08:05.444 --> 00:08:10.011\nI do not expect you to have one person\nmanaging the business justification, and\n\n143\n00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:12.604\nanother person looking at lessons learned,\n\n144\n00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:16.580\nand another person who defines roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n145\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.350\nAll of these are the responsibility\nof the project board.\n\n146\n00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.200\nBut again, that's something else we'll\nlook at in a little bit more depth.\n\n147\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.430\nHe's still looking pensive.\n\n148\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.520\nThat worries me.\n\n149\n00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.110\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n150\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.325\nI was just thinking, I'm a little\nbitter about some previous experiences.\n\n151\n00:08:31.325 --> 00:08:33.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I was like, so\n\n152\n00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.570\nwe shouldn't put people in silos\nwith single responsibilities and\n\n153\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.160\nno communication between\nrespective channels.\n\n154\n00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.818\nBecause that's not an effective\nway to manage a project?\n\n155\n00:08:41.818 --> 00:08:43.604\n&gt;&gt; Funnily enough, no, it's not, no.\n\n156\n00:08:43.604 --> 00:08:45.700\n&gt;&gt; Aw, man, I tell you what.\n\n157\n00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.610\nIt's eye-opening, Jo, eye-opening.\n\n158\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.430\n&gt;&gt; I mean, personally I like\nto work in asylum, but no,\n\n159\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.690\nit's not really an efficient\nway of working.\n\n160\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.520\n&gt;&gt; Not when, now, if you're the only\nperson responsible for all these pieces\n\n161\n00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.830\nand it's a very small scope project,\nI doubt it's going to happen.\n\n162\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.360\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n163\n00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.140\nEven then, right?\n\n164\n00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.370\nIf you're the only person working on that\nproject, and it was a really small scale\n\n165\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.370\nproject, you still need to be\ninteracting with the business.\n\n166\n00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.000\nYou still need to be interacting\nwith your suppliers.\n\n167\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.130\nYou still need to be interacting\nwith your support people, so\n\n168\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.680\neven then,\nyou shouldn't be working in an asylum.\n\n169\n00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:25.800\nThere is no reason that we should\nbe adopting siloed work at all.\n\n170\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.700\nAnd, I'm glad you mentioned it, actually.\n\n171\n00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.480\nBecause I'm gonna bring\nin this kind of well,\n\n172\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.030\nI wanna talk about the elephant\nin the room right now.\n\n173\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.193\nWe do have an elephant in this room.\n\n174\n00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:43.620\nI don't want him to say\nanything at this point in time.\n\n175\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.680\nThat's this huge big wall that we've\ngot built up between project team and\n\n176\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.500\nsupport team.\n\n177\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.960\nYou know all about this wall.\n\n178\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.910\nI know all about this wall.\n\n179\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.390\nThere is an invisible barrier\nbetween project and support team.\n\n180\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.390\nAnd I hear support people\nsaying to me all the time,\n\n181\n00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.000\nthat projects get thrown all over\nthe fence or thrown over the wall.\n\n182\n00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.230\nAnd the projects aren't actually\nhanded over, but projects are well\n\n183\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.590\njust thrown over to support and\nsupport are left to pick up the pieces.\n\n184\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.110\nAnd I wanna dispel this right here and\nright now.\n\n185\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.830\nThat is not something that we encourage.\n\n186\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.280\nWe will be looking at DevOps, and\n\n187\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.280\nwe will be looking at implementation and\ndeployment.\n\n188\n00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.850\nWe'll be looking at transition\nin other episodes, but\n\n189\n00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.560\nthat is definitely not something\nthat we want to encourage.\n\n190\n00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.600\nWe don't want to encourage\nworking in silos.\n\n191\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.640\nYou remember,\nthe project is cross-functional, and\n\n192\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.340\nthat means our support functions as well.\n\n193\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.480\nWe do not want to be working in isolation\nin a PRINCE2 environment, absolutely not.\n\n194\n00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.230\nI really, really,\nreally don't want to see that.\n\n195\n00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.620\nSure, we should have defined roles and\nresponsibilities, yes we should.\n\n196\n00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.970\nBut some of those roles should\ninvolve that transition\n\n197\n00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.470\ninto the live operating environment.\n\n198\n00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.580\nSome of those roles\nshould involve training.\n\n199\n00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:11.130\nSome of those roles should involve\nhow we get our support team on board.\n\n200\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.790\nThat's what those responsibilities, and\n\n201\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.440\nthe roles that are performing\nthem should be doing.\n\n202\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.760\nSo, no I don't want to\nsee silo-ed working.\n\n203\n00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.730\nNow, one of the things that jumps out at\nme when I look at these principles which\n\n204\n00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.540\nquite often takes everybody by surprise,\nis the managing by exception.\n\n205\n00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.000\nWhat that means is once we put our\nplan in place, then we manage when\n\n206\n00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.310\nsomething goes wrong but\nother than that, we don't micromanage.\n\n207\n00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:46.440\nThe project manager doesn't need to\nbe involved in absolutely everything\n\n208\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.060\nthe budget team are doing.\n\n209\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.598\nThere should be an understanding\nthat the project team\n\n210\n00:11:53.598 --> 00:11:56.146\nare getting on with their work.\n\n211\n00:11:56.146 --> 00:12:01.146\nAnd they are getting on with delivering\ntheir work and performing their\n\n212\n00:12:01.146 --> 00:12:06.727\nactivities within a timeframe that's\nbeen allocated to them, within cost and\n\n213\n00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:12.160\nwithin quality tolerances as well,\nunless they highlight something else.\n\n214\n00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.570\nAnd if they highlight that\nsomething else is wrong,\n\n215\n00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.190\nthat's when project management\nteam will get involved.\n\n216\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:25.310\nWe manage by exception,\nwe do not micro manage.\n\n217\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.930\nI know that that's not true,\n\n218\n00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.980\nJustin you've been involved in a lot\nof projects, and I know that that's not\n\n219\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.400\ntrue necessarily on all of the projects\nthat you've been involved in.\n\n220\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, micromanaging is the preferred\npractice of what I've seen as most.\n\n221\n00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.760\nBut it actually goes the other way.\n\n222\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.520\nWithout an appropriate line of\ncommunication and expectation, and\n\n223\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.310\nto some extent trust,\nI can kind of understand why people kinda\n\n224\n00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:53.260\ngravitate toward that even though I don't\nparticularly like being managed that way.\n\n225\n00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.330\nI wanna know what's going on, I wanna,\n\n226\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:59.020\nbut you gotta have this kind of implied\ntrust and open communication channels.\n\n227\n00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:04.420\nIf you're my manager and something goes\nwrong on what I'm working on, you have\n\n228\n00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.820\nfull trust that I'm gonna say, hey Jo,\nthis went wrong, what do we need to do?\n\n229\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.840\nLet's make a plan, right?\n\n230\n00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Right, if I'm project manager,\nI wanna be able to trust my team.\n\n231\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.540\nAnd if I can't trust my team,\n\n232\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:22.110\nthen this is where you end up getting\ninto the realms of micromanaging.\n\n233\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.940\nBut as a project manager,\nyou have to have that self restraint.\n\n234\n00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.640\nTo understand that if you\nmicromanage somebody,\n\n235\n00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.520\nit goes back to what we said in a previous\nepisode about motivating people.\n\n236\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.100\nIf you micromanage people,\nthen you're not motivating them.\n\n237\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.250\nAnd if you're not motivating them, then\nthey're not gonna deliver their best work.\n\n238\n00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.600\nSo we have to empower people.\n\n239\n00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.370\nIt goes back to trust, as you just said.\n\n240\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.150\nBut we have to empower people to be\nable to deliver what it is that they\n\n241\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.600\nneed to deliver.\n\n242\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.000\nThe focus for a project manager and\n\n243\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.210\na project board, has to be on the products\nthat we are going to deliver.\n\n244\n00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.500\nSo we need to assemble the right team.\n\n245\n00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.300\nRemember it's only temporary.\n\n246\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.030\nWe need to assemble the right team in\norder to be able to deliver the product.\n\n247\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.150\nAnd then we have to tailor\ntheir way of working and\n\n248\n00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.890\ntailor the project management\nto suit the environment.\n\n249\n00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.530\nAnd to suit what we're\nactually going to deliver.\n\n250\n00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.960\nAnd maybe even to suit some people.\n\n251\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.690\nSome people prefer to work from home, so\n\n252\n00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:27.140\nmaybe we tailor our project environment\nto accommodate working from home.\n\n253\n00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.070\nSome people prefer to work maybe early\nmornings, or maybe late evenings.\n\n254\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:37.360\nSo again, maybe we tailor our project\nenvironment to accommodate that.\n\n255\n00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.040\nSo when we talk about tailoring,\n\n256\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.310\nwe're not just talking about making\nsome tweaks to the processes.\n\n257\n00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.620\nWe're talking about tailoring\nthe entire project environment.\n\n258\n00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.200\nNow, I just wanna sort of\ndouble back on one, and\n\n259\n00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.810\nthat we kind of glossed over all of these,\nand that was the learn from experience.\n\n260\n00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.260\nLearn from experience is not just\nsomething that should be within\n\n261\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:02.970\nthe project.\n\n262\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.250\nIt's not just introspective.\n\n263\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.480\nLearning from the experience,\n\n264\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.550\nmeans learning from the experience\nof everybody around you.\n\n265\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.967\nAs we move through these episodes,\n\n266\n00:15:12.967 --> 00:15:17.324\nyou'll go into hear me quite\noften talk about lessons learned.\n\n267\n00:15:17.324 --> 00:15:22.263\nLessons learned from other\nprojects within our organization,\n\n268\n00:15:22.263 --> 00:15:27.018\nlessons learned from the previous\nproject that you managed,\n\n269\n00:15:27.018 --> 00:15:33.787\nlessons learned from individuals, lessons\nlearned from maybe other organizations,\n\n270\n00:15:33.787 --> 00:15:38.840\nlessons learned from information\nthat's available out there.\n\n271\n00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.360\nAnd I know I dread to think what I'm\ngonna get as an answer to this one.\n\n272\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.915\nJustin, so where do you go if you wanna\nfind out information about places?\n\n273\n00:15:46.915 --> 00:15:48.934\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, funny.\n\n274\n00:15:48.934 --> 00:15:49.496\n&gt;&gt; About things.\n\n275\n00:15:49.496 --> 00:15:51.543\n&gt;&gt; Well first I start with my mother.\n\n276\n00:15:51.543 --> 00:15:53.947\nBut then after that I start the internet.\n\n277\n00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:58.166\nAnd you know that first\none's obviously a joke.\n\n278\n00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:02.490\nI would like to think that I always try\nto source people who have had similar\n\n279\n00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.162\nproblems or\nhave tried to do similar things.\n\n280\n00:16:05.162 --> 00:16:08.863\nWhether it be internal or external,\npeople I know, meetup groups.\n\n281\n00:16:08.863 --> 00:16:13.621\nWhatever it may be,\nobviously the internet is a great place.\n\n282\n00:16:13.621 --> 00:16:16.310\nYou gotta be careful with\nvetting appropriate information.\n\n283\n00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.219\nBut within all of those,\nI still come back.\n\n284\n00:16:19.219 --> 00:16:20.641\nAnd this is where I'm a little bitter.\n\n285\n00:16:20.641 --> 00:16:22.599\nThere's an implicit level of trust and\n\n286\n00:16:22.599 --> 00:16:25.636\ntransparency between learning\nfrom other people, right?\n\n287\n00:16:25.636 --> 00:16:30.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I thought you were about to say\nthat about all of these I still come back\n\n288\n00:16:30.029 --> 00:16:30.675\nto my mom.\n\n289\n00:16:30.675 --> 00:16:33.259\n&gt;&gt; I thought that's why and said okay,\n\n290\n00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:37.290\nmaybe Justin's mom knows a lot\nabout project management.\n\n291\n00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.248\nYou don't that, she might do.\n\n292\n00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:40.364\nBut you know what?\n\n293\n00:16:40.364 --> 00:16:43.232\nEverything that you've mentioned,\nincluding your mom,\n\n294\n00:16:43.232 --> 00:16:45.840\ncuz I don't know about\nher life experiences.\n\n295\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.920\nBut anything that you've\nmentioned could be\n\n296\n00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.686\nan experience that you could learn from.\n\n297\n00:16:53.686 --> 00:16:59.030\nAnd I say the word could because the one\nthing that Justin said that really\n\n298\n00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:04.652\nstuck out above everything else was\nthe fact that you've got to be careful.\n\n299\n00:17:04.652 --> 00:17:08.536\nWhat you're gonna get when you ask other\npeople are other people's opinions.\n\n300\n00:17:08.536 --> 00:17:13.166\nWhat you're going to get when you go\nto Google, and when you go to any other\n\n301\n00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:17.886\nwebsite search for that matter,\nis going to be other people's opinions.\n\n302\n00:17:17.886 --> 00:17:22.695\nEven if you go to websites like Wikipedia,\nyou've got other people's opinions.\n\n303\n00:17:22.695 --> 00:17:29.440\nAnd even industry recognized bodies,\nit's still an opinion.\n\n304\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:36.797\nIt's an opinion of their particular\nbody with their particular bias.\n\n305\n00:17:36.797 --> 00:17:39.040\nThere's nothing wrong with other\npeople having opinions, by the way.\n\n306\n00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.400\nAnd there's nothing wrong with\ntaking their lessons learned.\n\n307\n00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.590\nBut it might not necessarily\nbe relevant to your project.\n\n308\n00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.706\nSo all of these are considerations,\nconsiderations that we would take\n\n309\n00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:58.289\ninto our project and take into\nthe way that we manage our project.\n\n310\n00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:01.310\nWhich is why we talk about\nlearning from experience.\n\n311\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:05.140\nAnd it doesn’t necessarily have to\nbe your experience and it doesn’t,\n\n312\n00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.080\nnecessarily have to be experience\nwithin the organization.\n\n313\n00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.739\nBut what we’re saying to you is don’t\nreinvent the wheel every time you\n\n314\n00:18:14.739 --> 00:18:16.260\ncreate a new project.\n\n315\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.144\nEvery time you want to deploy something\nnew, don't reinvent the wheel.\n\n316\n00:18:20.144 --> 00:18:24.460\nIf somebody's done it before then\nlearn from their experience.\n\n317\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.723\nJust remember that what you've got\nis just somebody else's opinion.\n\n318\n00:18:27.723 --> 00:18:29.636\nAnd if it's a supplier, for instance,\n\n319\n00:18:29.636 --> 00:18:33.770\nyou've got their opinion as to what's\nhappened in previous deployments.\n\n320\n00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.860\nIt might not necessarily be relevant for\nyou but\n\n321\n00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.230\nnevertheless, you can still\ntake it into consideration.\n\n322\n00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.081\nSo of course we've already\nlooked at the themes, and\n\n323\n00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.885\nwe looked at those in a previous episode.\n\n324\n00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:50.341\nWe've looked at things like the business\ncase, organization, quality, and\n\n325\n00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:51.081\nrisk, etc.\n\n326\n00:18:51.081 --> 00:18:56.210\nAnd we are going to focus on\nthese more in our next episode.\n\n327\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.747\nBut what we haven't looked at yet\nare processes.\n\n328\n00:19:00.747 --> 00:19:06.396\nAnd you're gonna see on our next slide,\nyou're gonna see what our processes are.\n\n329\n00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:12.450\nBut processes, I want you to remember,\nare suitable for any type of project.\n\n330\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:18.874\nProcess is a set of activities that are\ndesigned to accomplish a specific output.\n\n331\n00:19:18.874 --> 00:19:20.001\nThat's what a process is.\n\n332\n00:19:20.001 --> 00:19:21.579\nIt's something that you do.\n\n333\n00:19:21.579 --> 00:19:27.205\nAnd what we'll tell you that is that\nyou should document what you do so\n\n334\n00:19:27.205 --> 00:19:32.354\nthat you have a, well,\nI don't like to use the word template.\n\n335\n00:19:32.354 --> 00:19:37.060\nBut if you have consistency\nabout something that you do.\n\n336\n00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.309\nMaybe you have consistency about the way\nyou under take a change, for instance.\n\n337\n00:19:41.309 --> 00:19:45.523\nWell, we have to log it first and then we\nhave to make sure that it gets assessed.\n\n338\n00:19:45.523 --> 00:19:49.310\nAnd then we have to ensure\nthat it gets approved.\n\n339\n00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.188\nAnd then we have to assign rules and\nresponsibilities.\n\n340\n00:19:52.188 --> 00:19:57.242\nWe have a standard way of\nperforming that change.\n\n341\n00:19:57.242 --> 00:20:04.200\nThese are our process activities and they\nshould then result in something happening.\n\n342\n00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.615\nThat's an output.\n\n343\n00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:10.061\nWe don't wanna reinvent the wheel\nevery time, as we've said, so\n\n344\n00:20:10.061 --> 00:20:14.070\nwe want to ensure that our activities\nare done in a consistent way.\n\n345\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.066\nSo that if I were to undertake\na particular change, or\n\n346\n00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:19.673\nI were to undertake\na particular deployment.\n\n347\n00:20:19.673 --> 00:20:23.251\nAnd then let's say that I wasn't\ngonna be available for a week,\n\n348\n00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:26.070\nI could hand over that\ndeployment to Justin.\n\n349\n00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:30.458\nAnd Justin would know\nexactly how far I've gone and\n\n350\n00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:36.187\nexactly what he needed to do because\nwe had our processes defined.\n\n351\n00:20:36.187 --> 00:20:41.030\nSo processes define how we\napply the principles and\n\n352\n00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.090\nhow we use the themes within that project.\n\n353\n00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:49.605\nAnd they are aligned to whatever\nmanagement level while it's performing\n\n354\n00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:50.560\nthat process.\n\n355\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.064\nBut of course, processes should be\ntailored to suit our individual needs,\n\n356\n00:20:56.064 --> 00:20:59.410\nthe individual needs of the project.\n\n357\n00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.410\nNow here is a graphic.\n\n358\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:07.820\nAnd this is the graphic that, again,\nI have mentioned from the PRINCE2 book.\n\n359\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.840\nAnd this particular graphic just shows\nus exactly what processes we have.\n\n360\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.270\nSo we have processes, and we're gonna\ngo into these in subsequent episodes.\n\n361\n00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:23.572\nSo pre project and then we have\na process for starting up a project.\n\n362\n00:21:23.572 --> 00:21:26.883\nI know you're impressed by\nthat description, aren't you?\n\n363\n00:21:26.883 --> 00:21:28.657\nThe process title there?\n\n364\n00:21:28.657 --> 00:21:33.512\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's a lot going-\n&gt;&gt; Pretty self-explanatory, right?\n\n365\n00:21:33.512 --> 00:21:34.604\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot going on in there.\n\n366\n00:21:34.604 --> 00:21:36.779\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like there's pretty colors.\n\n367\n00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:39.683\nI was trying to read all the pieces and\nthen I'm, but\n\n368\n00:21:39.683 --> 00:21:42.130\nI'm sure you're gonna take us through it.\n\n369\n00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.364\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we are, we're gonna go through\nall of this in subsequent episodes, so\n\n370\n00:21:45.364 --> 00:21:48.163\ndon't get too hung up about this,\nbut you just need to understand.\n\n371\n00:21:48.163 --> 00:21:52.662\nAnd I like this graphic because it not\nonly does it tell you when each particular\n\n372\n00:21:52.662 --> 00:21:55.864\nprocess happens,\nsuch as the starting up project, and\n\n373\n00:21:55.864 --> 00:21:59.296\nthen initiating a project,\nand then managing a boundary.\n\n374\n00:21:59.296 --> 00:22:03.765\nAnd then controlling a stage and\nthen managing project delivery.\n\n375\n00:22:03.765 --> 00:22:07.796\nNot only does it tell you where\nit happens, so in pre project and\n\n376\n00:22:07.796 --> 00:22:12.303\ninitiation stage, if I can get,\nI'm just trying to get, here we go.\n\n377\n00:22:12.303 --> 00:22:14.045\nWe've got a little cursor here.\n\n378\n00:22:14.045 --> 00:22:18.169\nAnd then in subsequent stages and\nthen in the final stage, but\n\n379\n00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:21.756\nit also tells you what that\nparticular process does.\n\n380\n00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:27.860\nSo this one here, starting up a project\nkinda sits between directing and managing.\n\n381\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:34.020\nBut managing the product delivery, well,\nthat kind of sits in the delivering.\n\n382\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.549\nSo that's actually the nuts and\nbolts whereas those that sit up here,\n\n383\n00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:41.252\nwell, that's in the management level.\n\n384\n00:22:41.252 --> 00:22:44.170\nSo that's at a more senior level.\n\n385\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:48.113\nThis is actually a really useful diagram\ncuz it gives you the timeline across\n\n386\n00:22:48.113 --> 00:22:48.791\nthe top, but\n\n387\n00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:52.931\nit also gives you the management level\nat which these processes are performed.\n\n388\n00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:56.290\nAnd then of course underneath here,\nwe have our processes.\n\n389\n00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.508\nNow, of course, all of these diagrams that\nI've talked about in previous episodes and\n\n390\n00:23:00.508 --> 00:23:03.648\nthat particular diagram as well,\nyou're going to find in here.\n\n391\n00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:04.420\nLook at this.\n\n392\n00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.492\nThis is our official PRINCE2 book.\n\n393\n00:23:08.492 --> 00:23:13.484\nNow, you don't necessarily need this for\nyour foundation but you will need this for\n\n394\n00:23:13.484 --> 00:23:18.680\nyour practitioner if you're looking to\nget your practitioner certification.\n\n395\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.682\nAnd every single diagram that we found,\nincluding that one as well,\n\n396\n00:23:22.682 --> 00:23:25.376\nwell, can be found here\nin our PRINCE2 book.\n\n397\n00:23:25.376 --> 00:23:28.897\nSo I would recommend,\nit's not a requirement for this, but\n\n398\n00:23:28.897 --> 00:23:32.720\nI would certainly recommend that\nyou obtain that PRINCE2 book.\n\n399\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.072\nNow for this particular episode.\n\n400\n00:23:36.072 --> 00:23:39.186\nWell, that's all we're gonna look out for\nright now,\n\n401\n00:23:39.186 --> 00:23:42.232\nbecause what we're going to\ndo is in our next episode,\n\n402\n00:23:42.232 --> 00:23:46.223\nwe are going to take a much deeper\ndive into these PRINCE2 principles.\n\n403\n00:23:46.223 --> 00:23:49.473\nAnd we're going to take a look\nat each one of these in turn and\n\n404\n00:23:49.473 --> 00:23:52.203\nhow they actually apply\nto the PRINCE2 project.\n\n405\n00:23:52.203 --> 00:23:56.859\nSo I'm going to invite you to join\nus back again for our next episode.\n\n406\n00:23:56.859 --> 00:23:58.155\nWell, Jo, I'm definitely excited.\n\n407\n00:23:58.155 --> 00:24:01.950\nNow, before we get out of here,\nI'm actually gonna ask you a question.\n\n408\n00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.332\nSo, I've met some resistence in\nprevious roles about people like,\n\n409\n00:24:05.332 --> 00:24:06.858\ndon't document the process.\n\n410\n00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:07.730\nWe've gotta move fast.\n\n411\n00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.170\nWe gotta get things done.\n\n412\n00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:14.170\nSo there may be some people out there who\ngo, documenting the process slows me down.\n\n413\n00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.220\nWhat are your thoughts on that?\n\n414\n00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.086\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI'm gonna talk to you about bureaucracy.\n\n415\n00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:23.188\nAgain, we talked about this a little while\nago in one of our previous episodes,\n\n416\n00:24:23.188 --> 00:24:28.289\nand let's face it, none of us like red\ntape, and I don't like red tape either,\n\n417\n00:24:28.289 --> 00:24:33.239\nand this is why we'll tell you that you\nshould be tailoring prints to suit your\n\n418\n00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:38.630\nenvironment, but also you should be\ntailoring it for efficiency as well.\n\n419\n00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:42.241\nSo if I want you to do documentation,\nyou know what I'm gonna do?\n\n420\n00:24:42.241 --> 00:24:44.910\nI'm gonna give you an efficient\nprocess to do the documentation.\n\n421\n00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:46.772\nI'm gonna create templates for you.\n\n422\n00:24:46.772 --> 00:24:52.620\nI'm gonna do a lot of the leg work for\n\n423\n00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.500\nyou so that all you need to\ndo is just complete a form.\n\n424\n00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.880\nI'm gonna give you the software\nthat's going to facilitate that.\n\n425\n00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.414\nSo as a project manager all I\nneed to do is just manage, and\n\n426\n00:25:02.414 --> 00:25:07.351\nall you need to do is just undertake\nthe activities, and if you're undertaking\n\n427\n00:25:07.351 --> 00:25:11.498\nthe activities then the software,\nthe tools are going to help us.\n\n428\n00:25:11.498 --> 00:25:14.450\nNow, a tool will facilitate\nproject management.\n\n429\n00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.780\nIt's not going to facilitate anything\nthough if it's not configured\n\n430\n00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.880\nthe right way.\n\n431\n00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.750\nSo what we have to do,\nis we have to ensure that we do all of\n\n432\n00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:29.010\nthe configuration up front, and this is\nwhy we talk about having consistency.\n\n433\n00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.710\nIf we've got consistant processes, and\nwe've got consistant ways of working, and\n\n434\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.360\nwe've got a tool to\nfacilitate that consistency,\n\n435\n00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.650\nthen your documentation should\nbe as minimal as possible.\n\n436\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:44.120\nThat's what I want to do, cuz I know as\na project manager, you hate documentation.\n\n437\n00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.480\nI know that.\n\n438\n00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.020\nI hate documentation.\n\n439\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:53.510\nSo I'm going to use\nwhaterver tools are at my\n\n440\n00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:59.540\nfingertips to be able to remove\nthe documentation from you, why?\n\n441\n00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.892\nBecause if I ask you to do documentation,\nit's gonna be of poor quality,\n\n442\n00:26:02.892 --> 00:26:04.405\nbecause you hate doing it, and so\n\n443\n00:26:04.405 --> 00:26:07.972\nthere is no point in me banging my head\nagainst a brick wall trying to get quality\n\n444\n00:26:07.972 --> 00:26:11.790\ndocumentation [LAUGH] out of you when\nI know you're not going to deliver it.\n\n445\n00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:16.130\nSo, much better for me to look for\na tool that can actually facilitate that.\n\n446\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.847\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo, I agree with you,\nI hate doing documentation, but\n\n447\n00:26:20.847 --> 00:26:23.920\nyou know what I hate worse\nthan doing documentation?\n\n448\n00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.980\nHaving to pick up where someone left\noff with absolutely zero documentation.\n\n449\n00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.269\nSo, I just wanted to get your perspective\non that, and well, we definitely have more\n\n450\n00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:34.559\nto talk about when it comes to Prince2, so\nyou should definitely join us on back, but\n\n451\n00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.639\nfor now we're just gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n452\n00:26:36.639 --> 00:26:39.633\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n453\n00:26:39.633 --> 00:26:40.666\n&gt;&gt; and I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n454\n00:26:40.666 --> 00:26:42.586\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n455\n00:26:42.586 --> 00:26:48.660\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n456\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.633\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.332\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.430\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.907\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.907 --> 00:00:16.099\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n7\n00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.416\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore PRINCE2 2017 foundation.\n\n8\n00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:24.720\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about PRINCE2 principles.\n\n9\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.900\nI was real scared I wasn't gonna\nget that out, but luckily,\n\n10\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.840\nwe have someone who's a lot more masterful\nover when talking about PRINCE2.\n\n11\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.480\nAnd that's the one and\nonly Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.390\nHow are you doing today Jo?\n&gt;&gt; I was great,\n\n13\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.670\nI was wondering where you were going\nwith that at that point in time.\n\n14\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.430\nBut no, we're okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're doing what, see?\n\n15\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.500\nAlready more masterful than\nI even after that intro.\n\n16\n00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.609\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.\n\n17\n00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:49.363\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:50.743\n&gt;&gt; I haven't tried to say it yet, so,\n\n19\n00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:53.080\nit might be that's just a huge,\nbig assumption.\n\n20\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.521\nBut yes, Justin's right, today,\nin this particular episode,\n\n21\n00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.665\nwe're going to be looking more\nat the PRINCE2 principles.\n\n22\n00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:04.452\nI managed it, you just need practice.\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's no arguing in that.\n\n23\n00:01:04.452 --> 00:01:05.842\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n24\n00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:10.810\nin terms of these principles and\nyou looked at these in the last episode.\n\n25\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.890\nAnd in our last episode,\n\n26\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.270\nwe examined the principles that applied to\nabsolutely every single PRINCE2 project.\n\n27\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.070\nWhat I want you to remember and\nwhat I want you to take away from the last\n\n28\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.235\nepisode and something that's important to\ncarry through all of these other episodes\n\n29\n00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:30.560\nare the fact that these principles haven't\njust materialized out of thin air.\n\n30\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.980\nThese principles came from\nthat best practice but\n\n31\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.940\nthese principles need to be tailored.\n\n32\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.830\nAnd the simple fact is that I've already\nmentioned, PRINCE2 is not plug-and-play.\n\n33\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.880\nWe're going to give you principles, we're\ngoing to give you themes, we're going to\n\n34\n00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.600\ngive you processes and we're gonna\ntell you what these processes and\n\n35\n00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.560\nwhat these themes and\nwhat these principles should achieve.\n\n36\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.960\nBut we are not going to give you a perfect\nsolution to manage all of your projects.\n\n37\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.070\nIt is up to you to take\nwhat's in that PRINCE2 book.\n\n38\n00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.840\nRemember the book?\n\n39\n00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.650\nI think I've got a copy\nof it on my desk here.\n\n40\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.820\nLook at that.\n\n41\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.420\nYou're gonna take what's in there and you\nare gonna tailor it to meet your needs and\n\n42\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.280\nto meet your project requirements.\n\n43\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.350\nI can't do that for you,\ncertainly not standing from here.\n\n44\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.830\nAnd so when it comes to taking your test,\nwhich of course,\n\n45\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.870\nyou do have that Foundation test at\nthe end of this particular series.\n\n46\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.570\nWhen it comes to the test,\n\n47\n00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.390\nyou will need to remember that everything\nthat we're talking about is tailorable.\n\n48\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.330\nNow on your Foundation test,\nwe're going to be testing the theory.\n\n49\n00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.220\nSo everything that we've covered here\nis going to be based on the theory.\n\n50\n00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.450\nBut in your practitioner test, we're going\nto be looking at how we can tailor and\n\n51\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.760\nhow we tailor all of our principles and\nour themes and our processes to meet\n\n52\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.840\nthe needs of each individual project and\nto meet the needs of the organization.\n\n53\n00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.020\nWhich is why we talk about these\nprinciples as being empowering.\n\n54\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.350\nAs, well, giving you confidence to\n\n55\n00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.520\nmanage your projects in a way\nthat is well, efficient.\n\n56\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.030\nBut it also meets the needs\nof the organization.\n\n57\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.880\nWe're gonna give you\na really good foundation.\n\n58\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.950\nWe're gonna give you\na really good framework.\n\n59\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.950\nAnd it's up to you to\nbuild on that framework.\n\n60\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.540\nSo do you remember what\nthese principles were then?\n\n61\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.700\nBecause right now,\n\n62\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.190\non the screen infront of you, you will\nsee exactly what the principles were.\n\n63\n00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.330\nWe mentioned in our last episode.\n\n64\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.940\nSo this was continued\nbusiness justification,\n\n65\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.120\nlearning from experience,\nhaving defined roles and responsibilities,\n\n66\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.390\nmanaging by stages and by exception,\nwith the focus on products.\n\n67\n00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.600\nAnd then as we've already mentioned,\ntailored to suit the environment.\n\n68\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.490\nAnd in this episode, what we're gonna\ndo is I'm gonna break these down and\n\n69\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.786\nI'm gonna look at these\nin a lot more depth.\n\n70\n00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:55.827\nOkay, so we're gonna look at each one.\n\n71\n00:03:55.827 --> 00:04:00.733\nNow, I've already mentioned in a previous\nepisode, that the slides that you see\n\n72\n00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:04.445\non the screen in front of you\nare available to you to download.\n\n73\n00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:08.180\nThese are something that you\nare going to need for your study.\n\n74\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.060\nWe don't show all of the slides\nby the way in these episodes.\n\n75\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.540\nSo take a look at what's available to you.\n\n76\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.300\nThey're going to help you in your\nstudy when it comes to your test.\n\n77\n00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.020\nBut more importantly than that, they're\ngonna help you when you are looking to\n\n78\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.000\napply PRINCE2 within the organization,\nas a project management methodology.\n\n79\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.710\nSo let's take a look at\nthis first one then.\n\n80\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.090\nThe first principle we're gonna look\nat is continued business justification.\n\n81\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.615\nI mentioned in a previous episode,\n\n82\n00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:39.160\nthe business justification\nis an ongoing thing.\n\n83\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.440\nIt's a continual thing.\n\n84\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.490\nAnd if you remember, Justin asked\nthe question, how often should we look for\n\n85\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.390\nbusiness justification?\n\n86\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.580\nCan you remember what the answer was?\n&gt;&gt; Typically,\n\n87\n00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.450\nat the end of stages is something\nthat we've talked about,\n\n88\n00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.060\nwhere you reevaluate is what we're moving\ntoward, after this particular stage, is\n\n89\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.170\nthat still what we mean to move toward to.\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is not, you're right,\n\n90\n00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.620\nthis is on a, well, I was going\nto say a secular basis, secular?\n\n91\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.744\nDoes that make any, I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Cyclic?\n\n92\n00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:11.614\n&gt;&gt; Cyclic, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:12.280\n&gt;&gt; Cyclic,\n\n94\n00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.547\nlike we reevaluate this at the end.\n&gt;&gt; I hate that word.\n\n95\n00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:16.596\nRight, yeah.\n\n96\n00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:18.980\nContinual, I like the word continual.\n\n97\n00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.500\nOn a continual basis,\nwhich is iterative, it's regular.\n\n98\n00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.329\nThen we want to be reviewing\nbusiness justification\n\n99\n00:05:28.283 --> 00:05:33.234\nWe're not just interested\nin whether the project is\n\n100\n00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:38.540\ngoing to deliver what\nit's supposed to deliver.\n\n101\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.250\nIn other words,\nwhat's in our business case?\n\n102\n00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.847\nThat's part of it.\n\n103\n00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:49.401\nBut the other part of it, and you could\nsay, well, I was gonna say you could say\n\n104\n00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:53.700\nit's the more important part but\nit's certainly the first part.\n\n105\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.780\nAnd the first part of this\ncontinued business justification\n\n106\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.710\nis actually asking yourself, whether\nthe justification is still validated.\n\n107\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.302\nIn other words, is it gonna meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n108\n00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:13.747\nCuz I guarantee that the needs of\nthe organization have changed.\n\n109\n00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:18.461\nIf you take a look at a project,\nmaybe once every six months, depending on\n\n110\n00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:24.120\nthe lifespan of the project, then who's\nto say that what's happening now.\n\n111\n00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.690\nAnd what's happening in six months time,\nwell,\n\n112\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.550\nwho's to say that they are both gonna\nmeet the needs of the organization?\n\n113\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.890\nThey're probably not.\n\n114\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.830\nWhat I'm trying to say is, if I look\nback six months ago, did my phone,\n\n115\n00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.940\nthe cell phone that I had, did my\nphone meet my needs, six months ago?\n\n116\n00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.759\nYes, it did.\n\n117\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.870\nHave I got a new cell phone now?\n\n118\n00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.780\nYes, I have.\n\n119\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.490\nWhy have I got a new cell phone?\n\n120\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.450\nIt's not just because I want one.\n\n121\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.251\nAll right,\nthat's got something to do with it.\n\n122\n00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:54.357\nI know, I'll admit that.\n\n123\n00:06:54.357 --> 00:06:58.263\nBut actually the reason why I've got\na new cell phone is because they released\n\n124\n00:06:58.263 --> 00:07:00.790\na new cell phone and\nit had better features.\n\n125\n00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.150\nIt had something that I actually wanted.\n\n126\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.320\nWhich means that my wants,\nmy requirements changed.\n\n127\n00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:16.430\nWe talk about value having,\nwell, a perishable life.\n\n128\n00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.470\nValue is perceived.\n\n129\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.940\nThe wants and needs of the organization\nhave a perishable life,\n\n130\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.690\nvalue has a perishable life.\n\n131\n00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:32.030\nIf I gave you an Excel spreadsheet, or\na version of Excel from ten years ago,\n\n132\n00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.470\nwould you value that?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, it\n\n133\n00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.783\nseems more of a headache than it's worth.\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\n\n134\n00:07:38.783 --> 00:07:42.220\nit's exactly the same as any operating\nsystem or anything else for that matter.\n\n135\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.041\nWe're in IT, we're in technology and\nthen the technology arena,\n\n136\n00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:48.328\nsomething has a perishable shelf life.\n\n137\n00:07:48.328 --> 00:07:50.674\nAnd you know what,\nwe're in the 21st century now and\n\n138\n00:07:50.674 --> 00:07:53.997\nthat perishable shelf life is just\ngetting shorter and shorter and shorter.\n\n139\n00:07:53.997 --> 00:07:58.779\nWhy do you think we start talking about\nAgile when it comes to deployment,\n\n140\n00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.798\nwhen it comes to project management and\nintuitive projects?\n\n141\n00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:05.849\nBecause we want iterative releases that\n\n142\n00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:10.442\nare going to meet the needs of\nthe organization at that time.\n\n143\n00:08:10.442 --> 00:08:14.980\nWe have to acknowledge,\nwe have to be smarter at this and\n\n144\n00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.990\nthis is why Prince2, certainly in 2017,\nwe acknowledged that we\n\n145\n00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:25.700\nhave to be smarter at recognizing that\nthe needs of the organization will change.\n\n146\n00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.370\nIn the same way that your\nneeds change variety,\n\n147\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.490\nthe organization's needs\nvariety will change.\n\n148\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.060\nAnd they change very, very rapidly now.\n\n149\n00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.310\nWhich is why we have to ensure\ncontinued business justification.\n\n150\n00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.780\nAnd so\nthe first part of that is that validation.\n\n151\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:46.400\nBut then the second part of the continued\nbusiness justification is well, making\n\n152\n00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.490\nsure that what we're doing, still achieves\nthe goal that we had set out to achieve.\n\n153\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.310\nSometimes, throughout\nthe course of a project,\n\n154\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.940\nsometimes, certain\ntechnologies may become, well,\n\n155\n00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.870\nI was just gonna use the word redundant\nbut we don't like to use that word.\n\n156\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.806\nI might say obsolete.\n\n157\n00:09:03.806 --> 00:09:05.779\nI think that's probably\na better word to use.\n\n158\n00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.380\nCertain technologies become obsolete,\nthey're replaced.\n\n159\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.710\nCertain software becomes obsolete or it is\nreplaced, it's superseded by new software.\n\n160\n00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.201\nWhich means that,\nwhat we're working on right now, well,\n\n161\n00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:23.241\nwe might have to change because if\nthat particular piece of software or\n\n162\n00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:27.144\nthat operating system has just\nreceived an urgent security patch,\n\n163\n00:09:27.144 --> 00:09:31.457\nthen what we're working on right now\nis gonna have to change to accommodate\n\n164\n00:09:31.457 --> 00:09:35.448\nthe urgent security patch that\nthe manufacturer has just released.\n\n165\n00:09:37.885 --> 00:09:42.110\nDo you now understand how\nfluid our environment is?\n\n166\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.780\nOur environment is not static.\n\n167\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.980\nWhen we first came out with\nPRINCE2 as a methodology,\n\n168\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.380\nwhich was remember from previous episodes,\nthe mid 1980s,\n\n169\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.790\nthe environment that we\nwere in was fairly static.\n\n170\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.750\nIt wasn't as fluid as it is right now.\n\n171\n00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.920\nAnd now, well, things change.\n\n172\n00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.210\nWith a lot more frequency.\n\n173\n00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:10.030\nWe have to make sure that whatever project\nmanagement methodology we use, that we\n\n174\n00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:16.650\nare able to support that flexibility, that\nfluidity and those changing environments.\n\n175\n00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.820\nJustin, you looked as though you were\na little bit concerned about something?\n\n176\n00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.710\n&gt;&gt; No, I was just taking it all in.\n\n177\n00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.660\nI was trying to compare\nprevious static things and\n\n178\n00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.950\njust how fluid it is, just working even\nwith cloud technology is the thing.\n\n179\n00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.090\nJust destroy it on and\nbuild it again in the next hour.\n\n180\n00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:33.920\nRight?\nSo,\n\n181\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.100\nit is super fluid comparably.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n182\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.160\nYeah, compared to what it\nwas back in the 1980s,\n\n183\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.340\nwhen this first came out,\nthen yeah, things have changed.\n\n184\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.100\nWhich is why you talked about previous.\n\n185\n00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.050\nWhich is why our next principle is\nabout learning from experience.\n\n186\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.410\nAnd that's learning from\nprevious experience.\n\n187\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.440\nBut it also a learning from\nother sources as well.\n\n188\n00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.010\nSo, look at when we might want\nto conduct a lessons learned.\n\n189\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:06.330\nWe conduct lessons learned exercises when\nwe're starting a project because we want\n\n190\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.780\nto look at similar projects to see\nhow they've particularly progressed.\n\n191\n00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.840\nWe might discover something\nthat we didn't already know,\n\n192\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.880\nwe might discover something about skills,\nfor instance.\n\n193\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.050\nMaybe somebody's got a hidden skill\nthat we didn't know anything about and\n\n194\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.510\nthat was used in a previous project.\n\n195\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.850\nWe also conduct lessons\nlearned at the end of stages\n\n196\n00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:32.570\nas well because we want to ensure\nthat if we've learned something new,\n\n197\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.080\nthen we want to apply\nit to the next stage.\n\n198\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.320\nAnd then we also want to conduct\na lessons-learned exercise at the end of\n\n199\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.880\na project, so that we can apply what\nwe've learned to subsequent projects.\n\n200\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.690\nNow, in a previous episode,\nwe looked at this lessons-learned and\n\n201\n00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.090\nI asked Justin about where he goes\nto find information out from.\n\n202\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:58.070\nAnd we'd realized that Justin's\nmom actually knows quite a lot.\n\n203\n00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.470\nYeah, it was something that came out.\n\n204\n00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.820\nAnd also the Internet\nwill tell us quite a lot,\n\n205\n00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.910\nas well projects within\nour own environment.\n\n206\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.993\nWhat we've gotta remember though, is\nthat everything that we've talked about,\n\n207\n00:12:11.993 --> 00:12:16.061\nwhether it's Justin's mom [LAUGH] or\nwhether it's the Internet or\n\n208\n00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:20.659\nwhether it's previous projects,\nit's a very subjective perspective.\n\n209\n00:12:20.659 --> 00:12:27.109\nWhich means that, the lessons learned,\nthese exercises that we conduct,\n\n210\n00:12:27.109 --> 00:12:31.238\nwhen they are documented,\nthey are going to be or\n\n211\n00:12:31.238 --> 00:12:35.793\npotentially are going to be very,\nvery subjective.\n\n212\n00:12:35.793 --> 00:12:41.100\nIs that a good thing or a bad thing?\n&gt;&gt; I guess it depends on what kind of,\n\n213\n00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.370\nI guess,\nhow much credence you put to those things.\n\n214\n00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.290\nOr verifying your source.\n\n215\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.260\nI mean,\nit's hard to get rid of biases, right?\n\n216\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.830\nSo, we have to be careful there.\n&gt;&gt; We've got to be really careful anyway.\n\n217\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:59.690\nAnd the reason why I ask the question is\ncuz I want everybody to think about this.\n\n218\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:04.110\nRight way back at the beginning\nof this particular series and\n\n219\n00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.200\nin fact, I think it was in episode one and\nwe talked about motivating people.\n\n220\n00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.180\nDo you remember that, when we talked\nabout how important people were?\n\n221\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do remember that.\n\n222\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.180\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n223\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.880\nthis is why the subjectivity\nhas to come into it.\n\n224\n00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.860\nBecause sometimes,\nyou can't always quantify things.\n\n225\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.800\nSometimes, you have a lessons learned\nthat may simply say, you know what?\n\n226\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.110\nJustin's got a bit of a hard head, right?\n\n227\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.050\nHe doesn't learn things very easily.\n\n228\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.290\nIt's gonna be really\ndifficult to quantify that.\n\n229\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.060\nIt's really difficult to be objective\nabout that, that is a subjective opinion.\n\n230\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.210\nBut is that really important?\n\n231\n00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:46.260\nYes, it is because if I know that I've\ngot somebody that maybe could do with\n\n232\n00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.110\na bit of an additional [LAUGH],\n\n233\n00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:52.160\nI was gonna say a bit of an extra\nhand at coaching, for instance.\n\n234\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.660\nBut if I know that I have got\nan additional need somewhere,\n\n235\n00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.910\nthen I want to bring\nthat into this project.\n\n236\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.380\nI want to bring that\nexperience into this project.\n\n237\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.960\nIt could be something like, well,\nJustin's actually really good at certain,\n\n238\n00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.050\nhe's got certain skills and\nwe could really use those.\n\n239\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.210\nBut those skills aren't documented in any\nskills matrices because maybe it lies\n\n240\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.380\noutside the boundaries\nof project management.\n\n241\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.650\nBut this is one of the reason why if\nwe do want to keep that subjectivity\n\n242\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.001\nto those opinions,\nwhat worked well in other organizations or\n\n243\n00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:30.350\nin other projects may work really well for\nyour project.\n\n244\n00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.880\nWhat work badly in other organizations.\n\n245\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.230\nWell, that's a lesson for you to say,\nwell, I'm not going to make that mistake.\n\n246\n00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.990\nBecause I've seen what\nsomebody else has done.\n\n247\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.860\nSo, we don't mind the subjectivity.\n\n248\n00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.570\nSure, we like objectivity.\n\n249\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.570\nSure, we like things to be documented.\n\n250\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.290\nAnd we like to have tangible results.\n\n251\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.780\nBut sometimes, we have to acknowledge\nthat we can't always do that.\n\n252\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.330\nAnd its doesn't mean that just because\nyou can't get it written down in a graph\n\n253\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.060\nthat you should ignore it.\n\n254\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.730\nAnd that has been a mistake\nin the past within IT,\n\n255\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.620\nwhere we forget about the people\naspect and we forget the subjectivity.\n\n256\n00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.170\nAnd we think if it can't written down in a\ngraph, then therefor, we can ignore it and\n\n257\n00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.500\nwe can't.\n\n258\n00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.040\nAnd which is why we want to\nfocus on motivating people.\n\n259\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.850\nAnd we want to focus on the soft skills,\n\n260\n00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.350\nthe soft side of project\nmanagement as well.\n\n261\n00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.492\nAs I've already said, if I haven't\nconvinced Justin that something\n\n262\n00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:28.845\nis a good idea,\nthen he's simply not going to do it.\n\n263\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.500\nSo then that goes along into\nthe defined roles and responsibilities.\n\n264\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:41.510\nAgain, as a principle in defined roles and\nresponsibilities, we want to make sure\n\n265\n00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:47.500\nthat every single PRINCE2 project has\nthese defined roles and responsibilities.\n\n266\n00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:52.761\nSo we're gonna conduct something like\na Raci matrix for each process and\n\n267\n00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:53.869\nfor each activity.\n\n268\n00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:58.137\nYou ever heard of a Raci matrix before?\n&gt;&gt; I have and in a previous series,\n\n269\n00:15:58.137 --> 00:16:00.182\nyou and I talked about a Raci matrix.\n\n270\n00:16:00.182 --> 00:16:04.792\nAnd if I remember correctly,\nit's Responsibility, accountability,\n\n271\n00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:08.830\nconsultancy, and then information,\nlike being informed?\n\n272\n00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.790\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, yeah.\n\n273\n00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.950\nSo what we'll do, really really simply,\nis to map our roles and\n\n274\n00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.920\nresponsibilities for\nany particular activity.\n\n275\n00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.863\nWe will draw out the list of stakeholders,\nand\n\n276\n00:16:19.863 --> 00:16:24.210\nwe generally do that along the top,\na list of stakeholders.\n\n277\n00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.050\nAnd then down the left hand side,\n\n278\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.090\nthen were going to write down each of\nthe activities involved in the process.\n\n279\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.781\nAnd then what we'll do\nis where they intersect,\n\n280\n00:16:33.781 --> 00:16:37.572\nwe'll give everybody a letter,\nR, A, C, or I.\n\n281\n00:16:37.572 --> 00:16:40.838\nResponsible, that means that\nthey're responsible for\n\n282\n00:16:40.838 --> 00:16:43.840\nperforming a particular task or activity.\n\n283\n00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.720\nAccountable means that they\nare accountable for that activity\n\n284\n00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.950\nbeing completed, not necessarily doing\nthe work, but they're accountable for it.\n\n285\n00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.420\nConsulted means that\nwe'll ask their opinion.\n\n286\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.620\nAnd informed means that we tell them of\nthe outcome of a particular activity or\n\n287\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.430\nof the progress of a particular activity.\n\n288\n00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.810\nSo every single activity within\nPRINCE2 and every single process, so\n\n289\n00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.650\ntherefore every single stage, will have a\ndefined set of roles and responsibilities.\n\n290\n00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:14.350\nNow, of course,\n\n291\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:19.000\nthat's completely dependent on\nthe stakeholders that we've got involved.\n\n292\n00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.930\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nstakeholder communication\n\n293\n00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.650\nin another episode a little\nbit later in more depth.\n\n294\n00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.817\nBut we think of our stakeholders\nas not just being within IT.\n\n295\n00:17:29.817 --> 00:17:33.040\nA stakeholder by definition\nis just an interested party.\n\n296\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:38.280\nSo as anybody that's got an interest\nin how that project is progressing,\n\n297\n00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.922\nmy nosey neighbors,\nas they called her in my life.\n\n298\n00:17:41.922 --> 00:17:45.410\nI mean, I kinda wish that she wasn't,\nbut she is right?\n\n299\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.920\nShe's got an interest in what I do,\n\n300\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.720\nespecially whatever I\nget up to in the yard.\n\n301\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.235\nIf I'm throwing balls for the dog,\nshe wants to know what I'm doing.\n\n302\n00:17:55.235 --> 00:17:58.090\nA stakeholder is anybody\nthat's interested.\n\n303\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:03.225\nAnd you mustn't discount anybody that is\n\n304\n00:18:03.225 --> 00:18:08.625\ninterested, why not?\n&gt;&gt; I would guess that they can have\n\n305\n00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:13.687\na bearing on the respected project itself.\n&gt;&gt; I don't like the word bearing.\n\n306\n00:18:15.598 --> 00:18:18.142\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They'd have an impact.\n\n307\n00:18:18.142 --> 00:18:20.544\n&gt;&gt; We're nearly there.\n\n308\n00:18:20.544 --> 00:18:23.574\nThe word I'm looking for-\n&gt;&gt; Sabotage?\n\n309\n00:18:23.574 --> 00:18:24.805\n&gt;&gt; That's a bit mean.\n\n310\n00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:25.583\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n311\n00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:28.186\nI was going negative after those two.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n312\n00:18:28.186 --> 00:18:32.128\nI was gonna use the world influence.\n&gt;&gt; the one I missed.\n\n313\n00:18:32.128 --> 00:18:33.243\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the one you missed.\n\n314\n00:18:33.243 --> 00:18:33.939\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:18:33.939 --> 00:18:35.737\n&gt;&gt; In fact, that was kind of closer,\n\n316\n00:18:35.737 --> 00:18:36.359\nall right?\n\n317\n00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:38.700\nSabotage was a little bit severe.\n\n318\n00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.777\nBut any stakeholder, if they've declared\nan interest in something that you're\n\n319\n00:18:42.777 --> 00:18:45.198\ndoing, then they're gonna\nhave an influence or\n\n320\n00:18:45.198 --> 00:18:48.860\na potential influence on\nsomething that you're doing.\n\n321\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.090\nAnd all it takes is one person,\none negative person,\n\n322\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:57.110\nto undermine the activities of 500 people,\njust to sow those seeds of doubt.\n\n323\n00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.060\nAll right, so now Justin's gonna\nstart talking about sabotage.\n\n324\n00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.470\nOkay, I know this.\n\n325\n00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.072\nYeah, I'm gonna hear\nthis now a bit later on.\n\n326\n00:19:04.072 --> 00:19:09.300\nIt's gonna be I told you, but sabotage\nis kind of just a little bit mean.\n\n327\n00:19:10.832 --> 00:19:14.600\nBut nevertheless, one negative person\ncan undermine absolutely everything that\n\n328\n00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.820\nyou're trying to achieve.\n\n329\n00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.500\nAnd again, we go back to the motivating\npeople and the fact that well, we wanna\n\n330\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.906\nensure that we have everybody that is\nbought into this particular project.\n\n331\n00:19:25.906 --> 00:19:30.643\nSo that's why it's really important to\nidentify who your stakeholders are,\n\n332\n00:19:30.643 --> 00:19:34.892\nincluding third party stakeholders\nlike suppliers and users, etc.\n\n333\n00:19:34.892 --> 00:19:37.880\nThey're not necessarily\npart of the project team.\n\n334\n00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.220\nAnd then of course,\n\n335\n00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.835\nanother principle that we've talked\nabout is the managing by stages.\n\n336\n00:19:43.835 --> 00:19:48.241\nThen, it simply says that we've got\nthat planned, monitored and controlled.\n\n337\n00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:49.270\nDo you remember that?\n\n338\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.910\nWe saw that in the previous episode.\n\n339\n00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:55.150\nWe had a nice diagram for\nthat previous episode\n\n340\n00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:59.020\nof what it is that we're actually going\nto do within the PRINCE2 project.\n\n341\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:06.140\nWe manage iteration by iteration,\nstage by stage.\n\n342\n00:20:08.678 --> 00:20:11.800\nWe're also gonna tie that in to\nmanaging by exception as well,\n\n343\n00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.210\nwhich is our next principle.\n\n344\n00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:18.030\nBut managing stage by stage\nallows us to control each stage.\n\n345\n00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:21.607\nHave you ever seen a project Gantt chart?\n&gt;&gt; I try to stay away from\n\n346\n00:20:21.607 --> 00:20:24.257\nthem as much as possible,\nbecause they kind of make me physically\n\n347\n00:20:24.257 --> 00:20:24.949\nill.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n348\n00:20:24.949 --> 00:20:26.656\n&gt;&gt; But I have seen them, yes.\n\n349\n00:20:26.656 --> 00:20:28.471\n&gt;&gt; A Gantt chart, and hopefully,\n\n350\n00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:32.977\nevery single one of you that's interested\nin this that's been watching this,\n\n351\n00:20:32.977 --> 00:20:35.681\nyou will have seen by now\na project Gantt chart.\n\n352\n00:20:35.681 --> 00:20:41.246\nIt's really easy to look up a Gantt chart,\nif you haven't seen one G-A-N-T-T\n\n353\n00:20:41.246 --> 00:20:46.260\nis how it's spelled, and it literally\nis just a roadmap for the project.\n\n354\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.670\nAnd it contains lots of dependencies,\n\n355\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.860\nit contains all of the activities\nneeded for each project.\n\n356\n00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.570\nI wanna break that down\ninto more focused and\n\n357\n00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:04.150\ntangible bite-sized chunks,\nwhich is the managing stage by stage.\n\n358\n00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:10.840\nSo within each project, I want to\nsee one stage and a Gantt chart for\n\n359\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.430\nthat stage that showed exactly what\nactivities are going to happen and\n\n360\n00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.360\nwhere the dependencies\nlie within each stage.\n\n361\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.230\nNow, there's something interesting about\nthis particular slide that I really wanna\n\n362\n00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.930\ndraw your attention to because\nthis is something that is possibly\n\n363\n00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.610\ngoing to be mentioned in your test and\nthat's halfway down there.\n\n364\n00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:39.414\nWe show the PRINCE2 project must\nhave at least two management stages.\n\n365\n00:21:39.414 --> 00:21:43.020\nSomething's gotta kick the project up,\nthat's that initiation stage.\n\n366\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.590\nAnd then,\nwe have to have at least one other stage.\n\n367\n00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.460\nAnd we'll be looking at management\nstages in another episode, but\n\n368\n00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.690\nwe have to have at least one other stage.\n\n369\n00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.460\nSo we've got to start the project and\nwe've got to close the project as well.\n\n370\n00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.160\nAnd then there may be multiple\nstages throughout that project, but\n\n371\n00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.420\nwe allow for control of each stage.\n\n372\n00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.320\nYou don’t wanna try and\ncontrol the whole project.\n\n373\n00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.760\nLet me give you an example.\n\n374\n00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:23.070\nWhat I’m trying to tell you is that if I\nwanted to get from A to B I’m gonna walk.\n\n375\n00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.180\nAnd I’m gonna take one step at a time.\n\n376\n00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:33.290\nBut I'm only going to plan for\none step in great detail.\n\n377\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.165\nI've got a vision in mind,\nI know that I wanna get over there, but\n\n378\n00:22:38.165 --> 00:22:42.450\nI\"m only going to plan one step in detail.\n\n379\n00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:45.610\nWhy do you think I do that?\n&gt;&gt; Because if you try to plan all your\n\n380\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.590\nsteps, then you make weird assumptions,\nlike we're always going to take the same\n\n381\n00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.670\nsize of steps,\nthat there's nothing gonna be in our path,\n\n382\n00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.882\nthat the path doesn't change, that\nthere's not gonna be a root or a crack.\n\n383\n00:22:54.882 --> 00:22:56.405\nAll right, my bitterness is coming out\n\n384\n00:22:56.405 --> 00:22:57.099\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n385\n00:22:57.099 --> 00:22:59.477\n&gt;&gt; But we need to look at the short term\n\n386\n00:22:59.477 --> 00:23:04.397\nbecause it's easier to plan and\neasier to look at what needs to be done,\n\n387\n00:23:04.397 --> 00:23:08.110\nmore so than 13 steps ahead.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's not just about the word\n\n388\n00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:13.120\neasier either cuz I like the way\nthat you said, things could happen.\n\n389\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.820\nBut it's not just about easiness,\nit's also about efficiency too.\n\n390\n00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.420\nIf I've planned my next five steps, and\n\n391\n00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.620\nthen the first step that I take happens to\nfall short of where I thought I would be,\n\n392\n00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.770\nand all of that planning that I've\njust done is a waste of effort.\n\n393\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.640\nAnd so therefore, it's not just about\neasiness, it's about predictability and\n\n394\n00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.810\nit's about efficiency too.\n\n395\n00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.670\nSo I'm going to plan for\nthe short term in detail.\n\n396\n00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:44.590\nI still have the same long term goal\nin mind and at the end of every step,\n\n397\n00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.740\nI'm gonna check that that long\nterm goal is still valid.\n\n398\n00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.470\nI'm gonna check that I'm going\nin the right direction, but\n\n399\n00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.350\nI'm going to manage stage by stage.\n\n400\n00:23:55.350 --> 00:24:00.512\nAnd I'm also going to manage by exception,\nwhich as you see\n\n401\n00:24:00.512 --> 00:24:06.408\nin the screen in front of you,\nYou'll see what our exceptions are.\n\n402\n00:24:06.408 --> 00:24:11.508\nAnd so we want to think about tolerances,\nfor instance, where we've breached\n\n403\n00:24:11.508 --> 00:24:16.390\nthose tolerances in terms of time and\nquality and scope and benefits.\n\n404\n00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.650\nAnd again, we looked at those in a lot\nmore detail in a previous episode.\n\n405\n00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.830\nWe talk here about forecasting.\n\n406\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:30.610\nNow, I'm not too sure, if we can go full\nscreen, you'll see the rest of that slide.\n\n407\n00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:36.910\nWe talk about forecasting tolerances, and\nwe also talk about efficiency, yet again.\n\n408\n00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:41.410\nWe're bringing efficiency\ninto our project management.\n\n409\n00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:46.291\nAnd I always want us,\nwhen we continue on managing\n\n410\n00:24:46.291 --> 00:24:51.288\nthat project,\nI want us to focus on efficiencies,\n\n411\n00:24:51.288 --> 00:24:57.699\nas well as focusing on another\none of our principles, products.\n\n412\n00:24:57.699 --> 00:25:00.533\nPRINCE2 is, as it says there,\noutput-orientated.\n\n413\n00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:04.850\nWe deliver products to our organization.\n\n414\n00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.860\nAnd a product is defined, and by the way,\nany time during these notes that you see\n\n415\n00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.760\nsomething in bold, that's something\nthat you'll need to remember\n\n416\n00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.750\nbecause it's a definition that\ncould be tested in your exam.\n\n417\n00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.900\nBut a product is an input or\n\n418\n00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.720\nan output that's described in\nadvance that's been tested.\n\n419\n00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.430\nIt's something tangible that we deliver.\n\n420\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.278\nOr it could be something\nthat's fairly intangible, but\n\n421\n00:25:27.278 --> 00:25:29.486\nnevertheless we still have to describe it.\n\n422\n00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:31.663\nAnd we have management products,\n\n423\n00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:35.930\nproducts that are going to help\nus to manage our organization.\n\n424\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:42.072\nAnd you've also got specialist products\nthat do certain specialist activities,\n\n425\n00:25:42.072 --> 00:25:46.730\nthat fulfill certain requirements\nas needed by the business.\n\n426\n00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.845\nWe also mentioned scope-creep\nin this particular slide, and\n\n427\n00:25:51.845 --> 00:25:57.460\nscope-creep is something that, well,\nI wanna draw your attention to.\n\n428\n00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.455\nThis is why we manage stage-by-stage.\n\n429\n00:26:00.455 --> 00:26:05.319\nBecause we are aware that if we've\ngot a focus on continued business\n\n430\n00:26:05.319 --> 00:26:10.050\njustification, we are aware that\nthere could be scope-creep.\n\n431\n00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:14.290\nThat our requirements could change,\nanother reason for\n\n432\n00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.080\nmanaging stage-by-stage.\n\n433\n00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.530\nAnd then what we've also got to do,\nlastly, and our last principle here is\n\n434\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:28.570\nensure that we can tailor to meet\nthe needs of the project environment.\n\n435\n00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:33.416\nAnd that includes things like size,\ncomplexity, a team's capability and\n\n436\n00:26:33.416 --> 00:26:35.774\nskills, and also our risks as well.\n\n437\n00:26:35.774 --> 00:26:41.991\nSo every aspect of the project can be\ntailored, including all of our themes,\n\n438\n00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:46.977\nincluding our principles, and\nincluding all of our skills.\n\n439\n00:26:46.977 --> 00:26:53.180\nAnd well, even when you think about it, we\neven tailor what we're going to deliver.\n\n440\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.810\nWe tailor it to meet the needs\nof the organization at that\n\n441\n00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.120\nparticular point in time.\n\n442\n00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.050\nNow, I mentioned the word tailoring\nbecause in our next episode\n\n443\n00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:08.070\nwhen we come back, we're going to look\nat tailoring in a lot more detail.\n\n444\n00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.371\nBut for now what I want you to do is I\nwant you to download the information that\n\n445\n00:27:12.371 --> 00:27:17.445\nwe've got, the slide deck that you've got,\naccompanying this particular episode.\n\n446\n00:27:17.445 --> 00:27:21.910\nAnd I'd like you to take a look back\nthrough everything that we've covered.\n\n447\n00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.450\nAs always, we're always here in our forum.\n\n448\n00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.410\nAnd so if you do have any questions,\nespecially leading up to your test,\n\n449\n00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:32.680\nif you do have any questions,\nthen by all means, shoot us a question\n\n450\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.250\nthrough on the Q&amp;A that's available\non our course library on our website.\n\n451\n00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.100\nAnd I'll be happy to\nhelp as much as I can.\n\n452\n00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.135\nBut for now, well, we've taken a look\nat our project principles, and\n\n453\n00:27:44.135 --> 00:27:48.640\nwhen we come back in our next episode,\nhere's a little teaser, we're gonna be\n\n454\n00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.857\ntaking a further look at tailoring.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can't wait.\n\n455\n00:27:51.857 --> 00:27:55.111\nAnd goodness knows that I have to\nhave things tailored for me, and\n\n456\n00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:57.790\nI guess project management\nis very much the same way.\n\n457\n00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.500\nSo definitely come on back, but for now\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n458\n00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.260\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n459\n00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.125\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n460\n00:28:04.125 --> 00:28:05.122\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n461\n00:28:06.856 --> 00:28:12.322\n[MUSIC]\n\n462\n00:28:12.322 --> 00:28:15.453\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:17.154\nI’m your host Justin Dennison.\n\n7\n00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:20.965\nAnd well, we’re coming back at you\nwith more PRINCE2 2017 Foundation.\n\n8\n00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:23.967\nAnd in this episode we’re actually\ngonna be looking at Tailoring,\n\n9\n00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:25.502\nthat's very interesting there.\n\n10\n00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:27.241\nAnd here to help us along is Ms.\nJo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:29.356\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n12\n00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:30.064\nThank you Justin.\n\n13\n00:00:30.064 --> 00:00:32.450\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n14\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.354\nAnd we kinda left this off as a teaser\nin the previous episode tailoring,\n\n15\n00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:37.830\nthat makes sense, right?\n\n16\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.955\nWe're kinda gonna make things fit,\nkind of like the off-the-rack suits\n\n17\n00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:44.863\nthat I have to have tailored for myself.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n18\n00:00:44.863 --> 00:00:46.937\nthat's pretty much what we're doing.\n\n19\n00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:50.256\nWe're not gonna talk about\noff the rack suits, but yeah,\n\n20\n00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:53.586\nthis is exactly what we're doing,\nwe're making it fit.\n\n21\n00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.623\nI mentioned in previous episodes,\nand I say this a lot, actually,\n\n22\n00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.180\nthe PRINCE2 is not plug and play.\n\n23\n00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.529\nYou're not going to pick up all of\nthe principles it brings to and\n\n24\n00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:05.436\nall of the things and all of the processes\nis that all we need to have a project\n\n25\n00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:08.184\nmanagement methodology I\nknow that this will work.\n\n26\n00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:11.176\nAnd then just take everything\nstraight out of the PRINCE2 books and\n\n27\n00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:12.551\nthen expect it to work for you.\n\n28\n00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.492\nCuz guess what's gonna happen?\n\n29\n00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:17.023\nChaos, that's what's going to happen.\n\n30\n00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:21.639\nYou cannot take a methodology\nstraight out of the book.\n\n31\n00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:26.756\nExpect to apply it in your\norganization and expect it to work.\n\n32\n00:01:26.756 --> 00:01:29.234\nIt's just simply not\ngoing to work like that.\n\n33\n00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:37.207\nYou have to tailor before you can apply\nthe methodology in you organization.\n\n34\n00:01:37.207 --> 00:01:38.800\nSo what do I mean by tailor?\n\n35\n00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.787\nWell, there's an explanation again in\nyour downloadable material that looks at\n\n36\n00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:45.677\nthe definition of tailoring.\n\n37\n00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:50.953\nNow, I've mentioned before that wherever\nwe have a word in bold in the downloadable\n\n38\n00:01:50.953 --> 00:01:55.206\nmaterial, then that's something\nthat you will need to remember.\n\n39\n00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:58.692\nYou'll certainly need to remember\nthe principle for your test.\n\n40\n00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:02.140\nSo tailoring is described as, well,\n\n41\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.899\nadapting a method or\nprocess to suit the situation.\n\n42\n00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.793\nThis is not squeezing it in, right?\n\n43\n00:02:08.793 --> 00:02:13.194\nThis is not sort of trying to fit\na round peg into a square hole or\n\n44\n00:02:13.194 --> 00:02:14.812\nthe other way around.\n\n45\n00:02:14.812 --> 00:02:17.856\nThis is not a case of squeezing it in,\n\n46\n00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:21.899\nthis is making it viable for\nyour organization.\n\n47\n00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:25.394\nSo this is taking a process and\nsaying okay then,\n\n48\n00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:30.185\nthis particular process is to\ninitiate a project, for instance.\n\n49\n00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:34.292\nSo let me look at what I\nneed to have happened in my\n\n50\n00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:39.554\norganization in order to achieve\nthat particular outcome.\n\n51\n00:02:39.554 --> 00:02:44.984\nWe're not going to give you something that\nis going to fit straight out of the book.\n\n52\n00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:48.027\nWe're not gonna give you something that's\ngoing to work straight out of the book.\n\n53\n00:02:48.027 --> 00:02:52.399\nWhat we're gonna do is tell you\nwhat sort of steps you need and\n\n54\n00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:58.169\nit's up to you to then define those\nprocesses to fit within your organization.\n\n55\n00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.648\nAnd you can tailor processes or themes,\nyou can tailor roles, you can tailor\n\n56\n00:03:03.648 --> 00:03:09.126\nyour management and your hierarchy and\nhow your project team is structured,\n\n57\n00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:14.361\nyou can tailor products, obviously,\nyou can even tailor terminology.\n\n58\n00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:18.017\nNow, there's an interesting one.\n\n59\n00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:22.773\nI have a lot of people that come to me,\nbecause obviously my,\n\n60\n00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:26.506\nI guess,\nspecialty is in governance models and\n\n61\n00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:31.383\nthings like PRINCE2 and PMI and,\nyou know, ITIL and Agile.\n\n62\n00:03:31.383 --> 00:03:35.828\nAnd I have a lot of people who come\nto me and say to me, but this is what\n\n63\n00:03:35.828 --> 00:03:40.771\nit means in the PRINCE2 book and this\nis the definition out of the ITIL book.\n\n64\n00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:46.752\nAnd I say to them, that's great,\nI'm pleased that you remember this,\n\n65\n00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:51.473\nbut what you need to remember\nis the principle behind it.\n\n66\n00:03:51.473 --> 00:03:56.109\nBecause having a definition that comes\nstraight out of the PRINCE2 book is gonna\n\n67\n00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.759\nhelp you pass your foundation test, but\nit's not gonna help you apply any of it.\n\n68\n00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.068\nWhat you need to do is make it fit.\n\n69\n00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:08.884\nI don't care what you call your process,\nI don't care.\n\n70\n00:04:08.884 --> 00:04:13.475\nWhat I care is about the fact that\nyou have a process that facilitates\n\n71\n00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:17.435\nthe start up of a project but\nI don't care what you call it.\n\n72\n00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:20.396\nAnd so when it comes to terminology,\nyes for\n\n73\n00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:26.089\nyour test you're going to need to remember\nthe terms and definitions for your test.\n\n74\n00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:30.234\nBut in order to tailor project\nmanagement to suit your organization,\n\n75\n00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:32.070\nI don't care what you call it.\n\n76\n00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.314\nI don't care what you call\nany of the processes.\n\n77\n00:04:34.314 --> 00:04:41.587\nYou must adapt this methodology\nto suit your organization.\n\n78\n00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:45.309\nYou adopt it as a methodology, but\nthen you adapt it to suit you.\n\n79\n00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.957\nAnd then once we've done that, and\n\n80\n00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:53.518\nthis is another important part of\nthe tailoring, is that the processes and\n\n81\n00:04:53.518 --> 00:04:59.005\nthe principles and the themes are then\nembedded into your organization.\n\n82\n00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:01.820\nIn previous episode,\nI've talked about consistency and\n\n83\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.067\nI've talked about the need for\nconsistency.\n\n84\n00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:07.495\nSo that everybody is aware\nwhat they should be doing and\n\n85\n00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:10.857\neveryone is aware of how\nto achieve certain outputs.\n\n86\n00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:15.893\nSo that if I'm no longer around, well,\nor not for the rest of this week,\n\n87\n00:05:15.893 --> 00:05:19.937\nthen if I have a consistent\nproduct that is documented, or\n\n88\n00:05:19.937 --> 00:05:25.389\nconsistent process that's documented,\nand Justin can pick up the pieces and\n\n89\n00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.799\nJustin can run with this for\nthe rest of the week.\n\n90\n00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:30.149\nSo I've decided then that for\n\n91\n00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:33.887\nthe rest of these episodes that Justin's\ngonna run with this for the rest of them.\n\n92\n00:05:33.887 --> 00:05:35.868\nIs that all right?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, Jo,\n\n93\n00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.424\nit's gonna be a totally different show.\n\n94\n00:05:37.424 --> 00:05:41.218\n[LAUGH] It's gonna be, I'll tell you what,\n\n95\n00:05:41.218 --> 00:05:45.039\nI probably making up a lot of terms.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.716\n&gt;&gt; But since we are tailoring it,\n\n97\n00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:49.174\nI'm gonna tailor the show\nto my own use case.\n\n98\n00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:51.539\nI don't think that's where\nwe are going with this, but\n\n99\n00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.724\nyou don't want me doing that.\n&gt;&gt; Well, put it this way, it's not gonna\n\n100\n00:05:54.724 --> 00:05:58.207\nget any body past the test, is it?\n&gt;&gt; That would be a absolute no.\n\n101\n00:05:58.207 --> 00:05:58.793\n&gt;&gt; That'll be a no,\n\n102\n00:05:58.793 --> 00:05:59.567\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So who is responsible for\n\n104\n00:06:02.246 --> 00:06:04.294\ndoing all of these tailoring then?\n\n105\n00:06:04.294 --> 00:06:07.993\nWell, you'll notice that on this\nparticular slide we've got a list\n\n106\n00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:11.566\nhere the responsibilities and\ndocumentation as well Justin asked\n\n107\n00:06:11.566 --> 00:06:15.606\na question in the previous episode about\nwhy do I have to do documentation?\n\n108\n00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:18.254\nOr because you do [LAUGH] no,\nit's not that.\n\n109\n00:06:18.254 --> 00:06:20.536\nIt's we run that consistency.\n\n110\n00:06:20.536 --> 00:06:23.395\nIf I don't document anything that I do,\n\n111\n00:06:23.395 --> 00:06:28.944\nthen when it comes to handing it over to\nJustin for Justin to pick up the pieces,\n\n112\n00:06:28.944 --> 00:06:33.086\nhe won't know what to do,\nwhich is why I have to document.\n\n113\n00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:36.391\nI'm not saying that document\nneeds to be complex.\n\n114\n00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:41.671\nAnd we want to have the tools in place\nto facilitate the documentation.\n\n115\n00:06:41.671 --> 00:06:45.009\nBut we also need to define roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n116\n00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.325\nAnd those roles and responsibilities and\n\n117\n00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:51.043\nthe activities that they need to\nundertake need to be documented.\n\n118\n00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:55.119\nSo responsibilities for\ntailoring of PRINCE2 then, for\n\n119\n00:06:55.119 --> 00:07:00.524\ntailoring the project management\nmethodology lie with the project board and\n\n120\n00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:04.532\nthe project manager,\nwithin each team manager as well.\n\n121\n00:07:04.532 --> 00:07:08.925\nSo within each team that\nmanager has a responsibility\n\n122\n00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:13.034\nto tailor activities,\nto suit the environment.\n\n123\n00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:17.604\nRemembering that every single\nproject is going to be different.\n\n124\n00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:21.132\nNo two projects are going to be the same.\n\n125\n00:07:21.132 --> 00:07:22.808\nThere needs to be consistency.\n\n126\n00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:27.209\nBut we have to tailor to meet\nthe needs of the project and\n\n127\n00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:30.378\nto meet the needs of the organization.\n\n128\n00:07:30.378 --> 00:07:36.656\nSo we want to ensure that we have\nassurance for every single project.\n\n129\n00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:41.876\nAnd that we have, well, QA,\nQuality Assurance and Project Assurance.\n\n130\n00:07:41.876 --> 00:07:45.197\nMaking sure that the project's\ngoing to do the right thing,\n\n131\n00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:49.179\nbut also making sure that the product\nthat we deliver is the right thing.\n\n132\n00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:51.249\nWell, that's gonna be tailored for\n\n133\n00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:54.535\nevery single project because\neach project is different.\n\n134\n00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:58.057\nIt has a different outcome that's\nrequired, a different output.\n\n135\n00:08:00.211 --> 00:08:02.526\nThat's a pensive look that I\nsee coming from you Justin.\n\n136\n00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:03.811\n&gt;&gt; It's probably nothing mindblowing.\n\n137\n00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:07.118\nI'm just trying to figure out what PID\nstands for, but we haven't go there yet.\n\n138\n00:08:07.118 --> 00:08:09.442\n&gt;&gt; We haven't got there yet, no.\n\n139\n00:08:09.442 --> 00:08:11.017\n&gt;&gt; I'm jumping ahead a little bit,\n\n140\n00:08:11.017 --> 00:08:15.009\nI'm like what is it cuz all I can think of\nis process identifier, but I'm pretty sure\n\n141\n00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:19.610\nthat's not what it is or maybe I'm wrong.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you are.\n\n142\n00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.241\nMaybe I should just give you a quiz.\n&gt;&gt; We do enough of that in these episodes,\n\n143\n00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:25.145\nJo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:08:25.145 --> 00:08:26.217\n&gt;&gt; Most of the time it's just,\n\n145\n00:08:26.217 --> 00:08:26.802\nI don't know.\n\n146\n00:08:26.802 --> 00:08:29.615\nBy the way, is there a I don't know\n\n147\n00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:31.464\ncheckbox on the exam?\n\n148\n00:08:31.464 --> 00:08:32.597\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n149\n00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:33.287\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no,\n\n150\n00:08:33.287 --> 00:08:34.789\nthere isn't an I don't know.\n\n151\n00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.817\nAnd you're never gonna be asked about\nacronyms by the way on your exam.\n\n152\n00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:41.360\nYour acronyms are always\ngoing to be spelled out.\n\n153\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.209\nBut no, we're talking about sort of our\nproject implementation documentation.\n\n154\n00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:48.530\nOkay, that's what we're talking about.\n\n155\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.830\nAnd it's not just one particular document,\n\n156\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.790\nit's a collection of documents that are\nneeded in order to kick off the projects.\n\n157\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.348\nBut it almost becomes our textbook,\nour detra,\n\n158\n00:08:59.348 --> 00:09:02.994\nit is what we're striving for\nwithin the project, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:02.994 --> 00:09:07.080\nBut all of that's gotta be tailored,\ntailored within the project,\n\n160\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.760\nincluding who our change authority is.\n\n161\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.710\nNow, change authority is something that,\nwell,\n\n162\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.340\nit's a concept that you've\ncome across within ITIL, and\n\n163\n00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.820\nyour change authority is the person\nthat authorizes the change.\n\n164\n00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.870\nWhen you're implementing anything\ninto the live environment,\n\n165\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.780\nwhether you're changing an existing\nproduct that's out there, or\n\n166\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.650\nwhether you're bringing in\nsomething completely new,\n\n167\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.650\nyou are going to implement and\ntransition into the live environment.\n\n168\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.450\nSo guess what,\nyou need to go through change control.\n\n169\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.570\nYou can't just do it\nbecause you feel like it,\n\n170\n00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.820\nbecause you may be impacting\nthe live environment.\n\n171\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.150\nIt has to go through change control and\n\n172\n00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.060\nthat means that somebody\nhas got to authorize it.\n\n173\n00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.860\nThere's a general rule of thumb\nwith the authorization on this one.\n\n174\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.790\nAnd that is the bigger the change,\n\n175\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:05.690\nwell the higher the authorization\nmust come from.\n\n176\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.020\nSo if it's a small change, it's just\na change that to affect one particular\n\n177\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.420\nserver, then the authorization might\ncome from that particular service owner,\n\n178\n00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.640\nthey might be the change authority.\n\n179\n00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.600\nIf it's a brand new service that's\ngonna be deployed to the whole of\n\n180\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.750\nthe organization, then your CIO\nmay well be your change authority.\n\n181\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.340\nSo the higher the scale,\nthe bigger the potential impact,\n\n182\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.370\nthe higher the risk then the more senior\nI expect that change authority to be.\n\n183\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.720\nSo here's something that's come straight\nout of your PRINCE2 textbooks and\n\n184\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.050\nthis is the context for tailoring.\n\n185\n00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.360\nWhat do we have to consider\nwhen we are tailoring?\n\n186\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.480\nWell, we mention here constraints and\nthen there's influences as well.\n\n187\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.760\nSo what type of constraints are there?\n\n188\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.770\nWell, such as standards within the\norganization, that might be a constraint.\n\n189\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:07.390\nIf you are for instance maybe\nyou have achieved ISO 27001,\n\n190\n00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.660\nwhich is the international standard for\nIT security.\n\n191\n00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.960\nIf you've achieved that within your\nIT service provider organization,\n\n192\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.350\nthen whatever projects we implement,\nwhatever projects we transition\n\n193\n00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:27.780\ninto the live environment has to make sure\nthat we don't jeopardize that ISO 27001.\n\n194\n00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.280\nBecause if we do jeopardize that then\nwe'll no longer retain that standard and\n\n195\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.410\ntherefore we lose our accreditation.\n\n196\n00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.660\nIt's the same with maybe ISO 20,000 and it\nmay be the same with any other government\n\n197\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.560\nregulations depending on what\nenvironment you work in.\n\n198\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.490\nMaybe you work in pharmaceutical,\nmaybe you work in finance.\n\n199\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:51.120\nWell, if you have to achieve certain\naccreditations or certain standards or\n\n200\n00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.880\nregulations, then any implementation,\n\n201\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:02.680\nany transition of any new project could\naffect that particular accreditation,\n\n202\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.760\nand therefore, it's gotta be considered\nin with your tailoring constraints and\n\n203\n00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.070\nyour tailoring requirements.\n\n204\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.067\nAlso though, what about internal?\n\n205\n00:12:12.067 --> 00:12:16.400\nIf we look at the bottom there on that\nscreen, internal processes and standards.\n\n206\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.500\nInternal ethics,\nI've mentioned in a previous\n\n207\n00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.590\nepisode about using that common\nlanguage and having a common way of\n\n208\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:31.780\nconducting business and making sure that\nwe're all talking in the same language.\n\n209\n00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.490\nIf we have got, and we know we're going to\nhave cross functional project teams, but\n\n210\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.840\nif we have got international project\nteams, international support teams,\n\n211\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.610\nour organization is a global organization.\n\n212\n00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.140\nAnd then we've got a lot more to think\nabout than just that very simple\n\n213\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:56.280\ntranslation from English to French or\nfrom English to Hindi, for instance.\n\n214\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.850\nWe've got a lot more to\nthink about than that,\n\n215\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.410\nwe also have to think about other\nsort of cultural considerations.\n\n216\n00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:06.040\nWe've also gotta think about the,\nit mentions organizational maturity there.\n\n217\n00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.610\nAnd organizational maturity means,\n\n218\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:12.110\nwhat about the capability of the\norganization that we're using to develop\n\n219\n00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:16.950\nour new product and the organization\nthat we are deploying that product into?\n\n220\n00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.690\nIt's no good giving\nsomebody who has never seen\n\n221\n00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:28.290\na cell phone before in their life,\ngiving them the latest iPhone.\n\n222\n00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.660\nThey wouldn't know what to do with it.\n\n223\n00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.840\nSo when we think about\norganizational maturity,\n\n224\n00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.140\ndon't give me something\nthat I can't cope with.\n\n225\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.510\nDon't give me something\nthat I'm not used to and\n\n226\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.070\nthen expect me to be able\nto use it intuitively.\n\n227\n00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.350\nSome technology is intuitive, but\ndifferent people work in different ways,\n\n228\n00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.040\nand different teams\nwork in different ways.\n\n229\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.370\nAnd different cultures have\ndifferent technology, also.\n\n230\n00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:59.200\nSo you cannot assume, and\nwe have to tailor our project\n\n231\n00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.090\nto deliver more value and\ndeliver a product to the organization.\n\n232\n00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.500\nSo we have to understand\nthe organization first.\n\n233\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.414\nAnd then other influences such\nas the scale of the project and\n\n234\n00:14:13.414 --> 00:14:18.139\nthe complexity and the team capability\nwill have an influence over how we tailor.\n\n235\n00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:21.694\nThey'll also have an influence\nover how we source.\n\n236\n00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:26.355\nHow we source our product and\nhow we source our teams as well.\n\n237\n00:14:26.355 --> 00:14:30.446\nThat could be external teams,\nthey could be internal teams but\n\n238\n00:14:30.446 --> 00:14:32.696\nthat depends on team capability.\n\n239\n00:14:32.696 --> 00:14:37.925\nOne thing that I do one to mention,\nthe word simple.\n\n240\n00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:46.400\nWe're really big sort of advocates for\nthe keeping it simple approach.\n\n241\n00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.790\nWe don't like bureaucracy.\n\n242\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.421\nWe don't wanna overcomplicate and\nwe don't want to overengineer.\n\n243\n00:14:51.421 --> 00:14:56.260\nAnd I have already mentioned\nthat step-by-step approach.\n\n244\n00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.490\nSome people may call it an agile approach.\n\n245\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.230\nAnd we're okay with that.\n\n246\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.530\nWe want you to use an agile approach to\nyour project because that agile approach,\n\n247\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.140\nthe iterative approach allows for\n\n248\n00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.320\ncontinual validation of that\nbusiness justification.\n\n249\n00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.680\nMaking sure that we are achieving what\nthe organization wants us to achieve.\n\n250\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.573\nAnd not what the organization\nwanted us to achieve 18 months ago.\n\n251\n00:15:23.573 --> 00:15:27.010\nBecause pretty much 18 months ago,\nthat's obsolete.\n\n252\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.140\nSo we have to consider\nthat agile approach,\n\n253\n00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.494\nwe have to consider the simplicity.\n\n254\n00:15:33.494 --> 00:15:35.845\nWe don't want it too complex and\n\n255\n00:15:35.845 --> 00:15:41.950\nwe want to consider how many organizations\nwere utilizing in our approach as well.\n\n256\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:46.540\nWhat about all our supply organizations,\nwhat about our vendors?\n\n257\n00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.095\nWhat about our customers too?\n\n258\n00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:53.311\nAll of these are gonna have an influence\non how we tailor a project,\n\n259\n00:15:53.311 --> 00:15:57.051\nincluding the program\nenvironment as a whole.\n\n260\n00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:59.341\nThen what I mean with\nthe program environment,\n\n261\n00:15:59.341 --> 00:16:02.500\nis how many projects are we actually\ndelivering at that one time.\n\n262\n00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.721\nJustin as a developer can only work\non one project at anyone time.\n\n263\n00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:10.410\nYou can't work on 15 at anyone time,\n\n264\n00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:11.338\ncan you?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n265\n00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:13.298\nit hasn't to stopped people\nfrom asking me to try.\n\n266\n00:16:13.298 --> 00:16:14.996\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:16:14.996 --> 00:16:17.578\n&gt;&gt; But I think something along those lines\n\n268\n00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:18.758\njust to.\n\n269\n00:16:18.758 --> 00:16:22.849\nEven if you ask someone and they try to\ncontent switching will automatically kind\n\n270\n00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:26.489\nof decimate any individual project.\n&gt;&gt; This is why we talk about efficiency.\n\n271\n00:16:26.489 --> 00:16:28.409\nIt's a really important point.\n\n272\n00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:33.158\nAnd this is why I ask that question\nbecause, it's not efficient to get Justin\n\n273\n00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:37.759\nto work on 15 different projects all\nat the same time, every time he picks\n\n274\n00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:41.990\nup another project, he's gonna\nhave to start from scratch again.\n\n275\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:48.130\nHe's going to have to review where he got\nup to, and therefore start from there.\n\n276\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.790\nWell reviewing where he got up to\npreviously, could take him a day.\n\n277\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.059\nThat's a day's wasted time.\n\n278\n00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:58.420\nSo think about basic time management\nwhen it comes to project management.\n\n279\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.213\nAnd when you're tailoring your team,\n\n280\n00:17:00.213 --> 00:17:03.690\nyou've gotta make sure you're gonna\nget the best out of your team.\n\n281\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.730\nI'm not gonna get the best out of him if\nI've got him doing 15 different things.\n\n282\n00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:12.960\nSo think about the entire program\nenvironment, not just this one project.\n\n283\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.920\nWe've mentioned in previous\nepisodes about working in silos.\n\n284\n00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.208\nAnd if we're all working in silos,\nthen trust me not a lot will get achieved.\n\n285\n00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:24.407\nSome things will get achieved, but nothing\nwill be achieved in an efficient way.\n\n286\n00:17:24.407 --> 00:17:26.247\n&gt;&gt; And along the same lines,\n\n287\n00:17:26.247 --> 00:17:30.598\nsomething that exacerbated it for\nme like these issues were,\n\n288\n00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:35.549\nnon-agreed upon language between\nprojects that had similar goals.\n\n289\n00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:39.340\nLike in one project it would be called\napples and in the other project it would\n\n290\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.486\nbe called manzanas or something, like\nthere's, I would just go, let's just sit\n\n291\n00:17:43.486 --> 00:17:47.515\ndown, let's just take 20 minutes and\ngo here's what we're gonna call them,\n\n292\n00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:51.009\neverywhere, instead of me having to\ndo this mental mapping of going,\n\n293\n00:17:51.009 --> 00:17:55.156\nwait a minute, when I'm on this project\nand they say I'm in manzanas they actually\n\n294\n00:17:55.156 --> 00:17:57.370\nmean apples like in this other project.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n295\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.100\nthat goes back to that language\nthat we were talking about.\n\n296\n00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.760\nAbout having that common language, but\nhaving a common language is not just about\n\n297\n00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.440\nthe words that we use, it's about\nhaving a common Approach to things.\n\n298\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.820\nIt's about having that consistency.\n\n299\n00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.427\nExactly as you've just said.\n\n300\n00:18:12.427 --> 00:18:16.819\nIf I got to work into this way with one\nproject, and I've to go over to this\n\n301\n00:18:16.819 --> 00:18:21.719\nproject to work in a completely different\nway, it's not very efficient for me.\n\n302\n00:18:21.719 --> 00:18:26.895\nAnd it also means that again I'm having\nto pick up the pieces when I start again.\n\n303\n00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:32.110\nSo I don't want to do that, and\nmore importantly as a project manager,\n\n304\n00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.510\na project manager shouldn't\nwant you to do that either,\n\n305\n00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.820\nbecause it's simply just not efficient.\n\n306\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.757\nWe want consistency\nacross our organization.\n\n307\n00:18:39.757 --> 00:18:42.346\nThat's gonna be difficult though,\n\n308\n00:18:42.346 --> 00:18:48.024\nespecially when you start talking about\nlots of individual suppliers because,\n\n309\n00:18:48.024 --> 00:18:53.450\nlet's face it, certainly the trend now\nin the 21st century that we are in,\n\n310\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.145\nthis trend is very much to\nuse software as a service.\n\n311\n00:18:57.145 --> 00:19:01.220\nIt to get that commercial off\nthe shelf product from our suppliers.\n\n312\n00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.262\nThat is very much a trend, and\n\n313\n00:19:03.262 --> 00:19:08.430\nas a trend that means that we are at\nthe behest of a lot of our suppliers.\n\n314\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.856\nWhich means that this supply works in one\nway and this supply works in another way,\n\n315\n00:19:11.856 --> 00:19:13.456\nand this supply works in another way.\n\n316\n00:19:13.456 --> 00:19:15.278\nBut guess what?\n\n317\n00:19:15.278 --> 00:19:20.107\nThis is where these methodologies\nreally really come into sort\n\n318\n00:19:20.107 --> 00:19:22.485\nof their lime light, really.\n\n319\n00:19:22.485 --> 00:19:27.121\nIs that where we have got,\na lot of our supply organizations,\n\n320\n00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:30.421\nall working to the same methodologies, and\n\n321\n00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:35.861\nall applying the same principles,\nand all speaking the same language,\n\n322\n00:19:35.861 --> 00:19:40.170\nthen that actually makes that\ninteraction a lot easier.\n\n323\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:46.018\nAnd this is one of the reasons why these\nmethodologies as best practices work,\n\n324\n00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:51.423\nand it is not just because they'\nare producing efficient products, but\n\n325\n00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:57.200\nalso because it facilitates relationships\nbetween organizations as well.\n\n326\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.640\nSo we started off then,\nwe looked at this particular diagram.\n\n327\n00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.914\nAnd looking at this particular diagram,\nwhen we looked at the context of\n\n328\n00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:11.130\nthe constraints and the context of\ntailoring on a particular product.\n\n329\n00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.775\nBut now I want to expand that,\nand bring actually in\n\n330\n00:20:15.775 --> 00:20:20.864\nthe tailoring into a project\nmanagement methodology.\n\n331\n00:20:20.864 --> 00:20:23.010\nAnd you know why I’m doing it that way?\n\n332\n00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:29.460\nBecause if I do it this way,\nthen I'm gonna have to\n\n333\n00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.887\nconsider tailoring for\nevery single project.\n\n334\n00:20:33.887 --> 00:20:37.370\nEvery single project,\nI'm gonna have to do this for, right?\n\n335\n00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:43.169\nWell if I do it this way,\nthen I do the tailoring once.\n\n336\n00:20:43.169 --> 00:20:50.373\nI tailor our project management method and\nthat is applied to every single project.\n\n337\n00:20:50.373 --> 00:20:52.420\nMake sense, hopefully?\n\n338\n00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.467\nIs there a lightbulb coming on?\n&gt;&gt; At a very 10,000 foot view I\n\n339\n00:20:56.467 --> 00:21:00.153\nget what you're saying,but I think I'm\ngonna hold off with any questions that\n\n340\n00:21:00.153 --> 00:21:02.805\nI might have because I think\nyou may further illuminate,\n\n341\n00:21:02.805 --> 00:21:04.294\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:21:04.294 --> 00:21:06.011\n&gt;&gt; What is meant by using tailoring by\n\n343\n00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:08.510\nmethod owner, or\ntailoring by project manager.\n\n344\n00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.320\nBut at a very abstract view,\nthat make sense.\n\n345\n00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.216\nYou're focusing on not necessarily\nthe individual components of a respective\n\n346\n00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:18.877\nproject, you're focusing on the\nabstraction of those that can be applied\n\n347\n00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:20.169\nover multiple projects.\n\n348\n00:21:20.169 --> 00:21:22.063\nDo I have that right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so\n\n349\n00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:27.441\nwhat I don't want to do is in this one\nI'm gonna tailor individual projects.\n\n350\n00:21:27.441 --> 00:21:30.575\nWell, that means that on\nproject A I'm tailoring,\n\n351\n00:21:30.575 --> 00:21:34.160\nthen project B I'm tailoring,\nproject C I'm tailoring.\n\n352\n00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.630\nThat's not particularly efficient.\n\n353\n00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:41.140\nHere what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna\ntailor our project management methodology,\n\n354\n00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.970\nand then I'm gonna do that once.\n\n355\n00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.350\nAnd then I'm going to apply\nthat to every single project.\n\n356\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.150\nSo instead of tailoring three times,\nI only tailor the one.\n\n357\n00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.910\nSo this is about efficiency.\n\n358\n00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.560\nYet again we've used that word efficiency\nand this needs to come through on\n\n359\n00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.280\nevery single methodology and\nevery single consideration because our aim\n\n360\n00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.810\nis to improve our performance, but it's\nalso to improve business performance too.\n\n361\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.463\nSo in terms of any tailoring\nwe only want to do it once,\n\n362\n00:22:11.463 --> 00:22:14.074\nwe don't want to do it fifteen times.\n\n363\n00:22:14.074 --> 00:22:17.696\nWe don't want to reinvent the wheel\nwith every single project.\n\n364\n00:22:17.696 --> 00:22:19.872\nSure there's going to be tailoring,\n\n365\n00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:23.001\nvery specific tailoring on\neach individual project.\n\n366\n00:22:23.001 --> 00:22:26.316\nBut we want to get\na working model right for\n\n367\n00:22:26.316 --> 00:22:31.730\nus as an organization first, and\nthen we apply it to every project.\n\n368\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:36.955\nAnd we wanna make sure that whatever\nmessage that we use, whatever our end\n\n369\n00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:42.936\nresult is, in terms of what our PRINCE2,\nwhat our project management looks like,\n\n370\n00:22:42.936 --> 00:22:47.680\nwe wanna make sure that that's\napplied across the organization.\n\n371\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.645\nSo that our organization\nembeds methodology.\n\n372\n00:22:53.645 --> 00:23:01.070\nWhether you call it PRINCE2, whether you\ncall it Agile, we're not that bothered.\n\n373\n00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:06.296\nWe just want to make sure,\nthat you have a consistent methodology,\n\n374\n00:23:06.296 --> 00:23:12.448\nthat you apply to all of your projects\nthat's used across all of your projects.\n\n375\n00:23:12.448 --> 00:23:16.227\nIt's embedded into the organization.\n\n376\n00:23:16.227 --> 00:23:18.685\nAnd when we use organizational\nchange management, and\n\n377\n00:23:18.685 --> 00:23:21.410\nI mentioned this in a previous episode.\n\n378\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.790\nOrganizational change management\nlooks at the people side of things.\n\n379\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.150\nIt looks at ensuring that\nwe've got people on-board.\n\n380\n00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:32.950\nAnd we're gonna use that to help us\nto implement a consistent approach\n\n381\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.960\nto project management.\n\n382\n00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.188\nCuz all I need is one person who's\ngonna be negative about this and\n\n383\n00:23:38.188 --> 00:23:40.784\nthat's going to undermine\nabsolutely everybody.\n\n384\n00:23:40.784 --> 00:23:47.254\nSo I want to ensure that we have\ngot everybody on board with this.\n\n385\n00:23:47.254 --> 00:23:53.718\nAnd that I develop those capabilities for\nproject management in everybody,\n\n386\n00:23:53.718 --> 00:24:00.189\nincluding in all of the processes and\nthe people and their behaviors as well.\n\n387\n00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:03.898\nSo think about the size of\nthe organization when we're actually\n\n388\n00:24:03.898 --> 00:24:05.416\nimplementing Prince2.\n\n389\n00:24:05.416 --> 00:24:09.126\nWhen we're implementing a project\nmanagement methodology,\n\n390\n00:24:09.126 --> 00:24:12.070\ndo we do it all in one go\nacross all of our projects?\n\n391\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:17.688\nOr do we do it from what we\ncall an incremental approach?\n\n392\n00:24:17.688 --> 00:24:21.924\nWhich is every new project that comes in,\n\n393\n00:24:21.924 --> 00:24:25.322\nwe will use the new methodology.\n\n394\n00:24:25.322 --> 00:24:30.143\nAnd then we've also got\nsomething called stealth.\n\n395\n00:24:30.143 --> 00:24:34.101\nStealth is not about being sneaky.\n\n396\n00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:38.658\nStealth is also about\norganizational change management.\n\n397\n00:24:38.658 --> 00:24:42.693\nIf we make a big fun fair about\ndoing something and then we try and\n\n398\n00:24:42.693 --> 00:24:45.740\nimplement it and\nwe find that it doesn't work,\n\n399\n00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.181\nthat can have quite\na demotivating effect on people.\n\n400\n00:24:49.181 --> 00:24:54.054\nSo what we may do is we may\nactually implement Prince2\n\n401\n00:24:54.054 --> 00:24:59.146\nmethodologies in an incremental\nway that is pretty much\n\n402\n00:24:59.146 --> 00:25:04.691\nunnoticeable to the organization and\nto the project teams.\n\n403\n00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:08.646\nSo we may start by using certain\nterminology and we may say, okay,\n\n404\n00:25:08.646 --> 00:25:12.614\nI've defined this terminology and\nthis is what I'm going to use.\n\n405\n00:25:12.614 --> 00:25:16.780\nWe may start by bringing in\nelements of certain processes.\n\n406\n00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.080\nSo we're actually implementing by stealth.\n\n407\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.446\nThat's not a bad thing, that's not\nsomething that you want to avoid.\n\n408\n00:25:24.446 --> 00:25:25.877\nThe use of the word stealth,\n\n409\n00:25:25.877 --> 00:25:29.701\nyou quite often think of as having\nsort of negative, sneaky connotations.\n\n410\n00:25:29.701 --> 00:25:31.451\nAnd that's not what it means,\n\n411\n00:25:31.451 --> 00:25:35.033\nwhat it actually means is we\nimplement sort of incrementally.\n\n412\n00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:39.443\nBut the one thing that we've really got\nto do is the bottom bullet point on\n\n413\n00:25:39.443 --> 00:25:41.477\nthat slide is really important.\n\n414\n00:25:41.477 --> 00:25:43.488\nIt's about engaging stakeholders.\n\n415\n00:25:43.488 --> 00:25:45.695\nAnd it's about communicating with them.\n\n416\n00:25:45.695 --> 00:25:50.131\nIncluding communicating where\nwe did something wrong.\n\n417\n00:25:50.131 --> 00:25:55.015\nJust on that last bullet point, do you\nthink that we should communicate when we\n\n418\n00:25:55.015 --> 00:25:57.074\ndo something wrong?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n419\n00:25:57.074 --> 00:26:00.943\nmainly because I've been in positions\nwhere people have not done that, and\n\n420\n00:26:00.943 --> 00:26:05.127\nall it did was make a lot of other things\nmore difficult than they should have been.\n\n421\n00:26:05.127 --> 00:26:05.655\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n422\n00:26:05.655 --> 00:26:08.824\nit's also about establishing\ntrust as well, and\n\n423\n00:26:08.824 --> 00:26:13.133\nit's one of the principles of\norganizational change management.\n\n424\n00:26:13.133 --> 00:26:17.792\nWhich, we have to ensure that when\nwe are making improvements we\n\n425\n00:26:17.792 --> 00:26:20.915\nmake improvements in an incremental way.\n\n426\n00:26:20.915 --> 00:26:25.471\nBut that we not only communicate success,\nbut we communicate failure as well,\n\n427\n00:26:25.471 --> 00:26:27.789\nbecause we've got to establish trust.\n\n428\n00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:32.201\nIf I think that everything\nthat you do goes perfectly.\n\n429\n00:26:32.201 --> 00:26:35.989\nDo you think I believe that?\n&gt;&gt; I think you create-\n\n430\n00:26:35.989 --> 00:26:36.814\n&gt;&gt; The answer's no.\n\n431\n00:26:36.814 --> 00:26:37.452\n&gt;&gt; Either-\n\n432\n00:26:37.452 --> 00:26:38.165\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n433\n00:26:38.165 --> 00:26:38.904\n&gt;&gt; Either you don't believe it-\n\n434\n00:26:38.904 --> 00:26:39.894\n&gt;&gt; The answer is definitely,\n\n435\n00:26:39.894 --> 00:26:40.467\nno, right?\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n436\n00:26:40.467 --> 00:26:43.450\nyou're creating unrealistic\nexpectations of me, for yourself, or-\n\n437\n00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.176\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n438\n00:26:44.176 --> 00:26:45.930\n&gt;&gt; For me that I cannot possibly attained.\n\n439\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.667\nBut either way, it's a negative thing.\n&gt;&gt; In other words, I idolize you and\n\n440\n00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:49.676\nI think you're perfect.\n\n441\n00:26:49.676 --> 00:26:53.325\nIs that what you're saying?\n&gt;&gt; Well, those are your words not mine.\n\n442\n00:26:53.325 --> 00:26:56.917\nBut, it's one of those things where-\n&gt;&gt; We'll let him dream, all right?\n\n443\n00:26:56.917 --> 00:26:58.352\n&gt;&gt; It can lead to that negativity that\n\n444\n00:26:58.352 --> 00:26:59.396\nyou're talking about.\n\n445\n00:26:59.396 --> 00:27:03.864\nLike if you're always expecting\nme to be perfection, and\n\n446\n00:27:03.864 --> 00:27:07.159\nI'm telling you I'm not always perfect.\n\n447\n00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:11.078\nBut you lead me to that,\nyou make sure that I have that unrealistic\n\n448\n00:27:11.078 --> 00:27:15.370\nstandard to try to upheld,\nthen that would possibly make me negative.\n\n449\n00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:20.074\nAnd now, I'm less likely to buy in\ntrying these things even if they\n\n450\n00:27:20.074 --> 00:27:24.206\nare incremental in nature.\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean all of those are true.\n\n451\n00:27:24.206 --> 00:27:26.752\nTo be perfectly honest,\nall of those are true.\n\n452\n00:27:26.752 --> 00:27:28.902\nWe've gotta communicate\nnot just the successes,\n\n453\n00:27:28.902 --> 00:27:30.807\nbut we've gotta communicate the failures.\n\n454\n00:27:30.807 --> 00:27:35.448\nAnd I have got to make sure that\nif I'm talking about you and\n\n455\n00:27:35.448 --> 00:27:40.968\nI want to give you something to do and\nI want to promote you as a person.\n\n456\n00:27:40.968 --> 00:27:43.725\nThen, I can't promote you\nas somebody who is, and\n\n457\n00:27:43.725 --> 00:27:45.917\nI mean promoted you o the big wide world.\n\n458\n00:27:45.917 --> 00:27:48.664\nI don't mean give you a pay raise\nbecause that's not happening.\n\n459\n00:27:48.664 --> 00:27:50.607\nBy the way, just saying.\n\n460\n00:27:50.607 --> 00:27:54.552\n[LAUGH] I want to be able to\nshow you as a human being, and\n\n461\n00:27:54.552 --> 00:27:59.465\nto show that you're not necessarily\ninfallible, because people\n\n462\n00:27:59.465 --> 00:28:04.483\naren't gonna believe if I make you\nout to be something you're not.\n\n463\n00:28:04.483 --> 00:28:07.086\nAnd so\nit's the same with all of our projects.\n\n464\n00:28:07.086 --> 00:28:10.531\nIt's not just about our people,\nit's not just about our skills.\n\n465\n00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:12.636\nIt's the same with project progress.\n\n466\n00:28:12.636 --> 00:28:17.148\nWe've gotta ensure that we communicate,\nnot just our successes but\n\n467\n00:28:17.148 --> 00:28:19.731\nthat we communicate our failures too.\n\n468\n00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:21.638\nBecause that will bring people on board.\n\n469\n00:28:21.638 --> 00:28:23.795\nThat will get them to trust us.\n\n470\n00:28:23.795 --> 00:28:27.564\nAnd that will ensure that,\nactually, we do make progress and\n\n471\n00:28:27.564 --> 00:28:31.928\nthat people are not afraid of speaking\nup during the project progress.\n\n472\n00:28:31.928 --> 00:28:36.735\nAnd that people are not afraid of saying,\nlook, I didn't quite achieve this,\n\n473\n00:28:36.735 --> 00:28:39.695\nI didn't quite get to where\nI was going to get to.\n\n474\n00:28:39.695 --> 00:28:42.812\nAnd that again,\nis something that's really important,\n\n475\n00:28:42.812 --> 00:28:44.661\nthat honesty from our people too.\n\n476\n00:28:44.661 --> 00:28:48.860\nWe're not going to come after you if\nyou didn't quite achieve something or\n\n477\n00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.471\nif you had an error in\ndoing your development.\n\n478\n00:28:51.471 --> 00:28:56.779\nSo in terms of then tailoring Prince2.\n\n479\n00:28:56.779 --> 00:29:00.108\nRemember, as I've said\nin previous episodes,\n\n480\n00:29:00.108 --> 00:29:03.608\nwe can tailor absolutely\nany element of Prince2.\n\n481\n00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:09.140\nWhether, it's the themes, or whether\nit is our principles, or our processes.\n\n482\n00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.787\nAnd as we move into our next episode,\nI want you to come back for\n\n483\n00:29:12.787 --> 00:29:13.917\nour next episode.\n\n484\n00:29:13.917 --> 00:29:17.826\nBecause we're gonna look at those\nPrince2 themes in a lot more depth.\n\n485\n00:29:17.826 --> 00:29:18.330\n&gt;&gt; Well Joe,\n\n486\n00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.586\nI can tell you that Prince2 is starting\nto fit me a little bit better.\n\n487\n00:29:21.586 --> 00:29:23.213\nSo hopefully, there you are as well.\n\n488\n00:29:23.213 --> 00:29:25.570\nBut you're gonna have to come\nback to hear more about themes.\n\n489\n00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.382\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n490\n00:29:27.382 --> 00:29:30.243\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n491\n00:29:30.243 --> 00:29:31.211\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n492\n00:29:31.211 --> 00:29:32.748\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n493\n00:29:34.594 --> 00:29:39.909\n[MUSIC]\n\n494\n00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:43.903\nThank you for watching, ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.462\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.462 --> 00:00:13.044\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.044 --> 00:00:15.594\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:17.409\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.558\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore PRINCE2 2017 Foundation.\n\n8\n00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:25.316\nAnd in particular we're gonna be talking\nabout themes today, business case,\n\n9\n00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:26.318\nin particular.\n\n10\n00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:29.202\nAnd here to help us along is the one,\nthe only, Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:32.016\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:34.681\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n13\n00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:38.397\nAnd, themes for some reason I always think\nof pretty colors and stuff when I hear\n\n14\n00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:41.840\nthe word theme, but I don't think\nthat's where we're going with this,\n\n15\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.505\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n16\n00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:43.906\n[LAUGH] I mean it's entirely up to you.\n\n17\n00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:48.306\nIf you wanna do your business case in pink\nand pale purple, something like that,\n\n18\n00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:51.099\nthat's entirely up to you,\nI'm not gonna judge.\n\n19\n00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:52.439\nI mean but\nthat's not what I was going to [CROSSTALK]\n\n20\n00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:53.263\n&gt;&gt; I feel like you're\n\n21\n00:00:53.263 --> 00:00:56.178\njudging me right now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah that is a possibility.\n\n22\n00:00:56.178 --> 00:00:57.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:59.413\n&gt;&gt; That's all I'm saying.\n\n24\n00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:04.181\nNow what we're gonna do is we're actually\njust going to pick up on the PRINCE2\n\n25\n00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:04.770\nthemes.\n\n26\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.211\nWe explored them in really high level\nin one of our previous episodes.\n\n27\n00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:13.270\nAnd we've got a graphic aid just\nto remind you what the themes are.\n\n28\n00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.760\nAnd that graphic's coming up\non your screen right now.\n\n29\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.020\nSo remember, the themes are those\naspects of the project that\n\n30\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.720\nhave gotta be addressed\nthroughout the project.\n\n31\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.110\nAnd you'll see here we've got\nseven themes, business case,\n\n32\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.870\norganization, progress, change,\nquality, risk, and plans.\n\n33\n00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.400\nAnd the first thing that\nwe're gonna look at,\n\n34\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.400\nthen in this particular episode is\nthe theme of the business case.\n\n35\n00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.380\nSo what is a business case?\n\n36\n00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.610\nWell, the business case theme,\nas an aspect of the project,\n\n37\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.960\nis here to ensure that we\ncompile a business case.\n\n38\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.010\nAnd that we've got mechanisms to judge\nwhether the project is desirable,\n\n39\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.920\nviable, and achievable.\n\n40\n00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.248\nIt's about supporting decision making.\n\n41\n00:02:07.248 --> 00:02:12.638\nA business case is a document, and we\nthink of it traditionally as a document.\n\n42\n00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:17.756\nIt doesn't necessarily have to\nbe a specific document itself,\n\n43\n00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:22.778\nbut it is certainly a representation,\nnot even a reputation,\n\n44\n00:02:22.778 --> 00:02:28.274\nbut a representation of the return\non investment of any new product,\n\n45\n00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:30.670\nor any change to any product.\n\n46\n00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.770\nLet's think about this as being\nthe reason why we want to\n\n47\n00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.360\nimplement a particular product.\n\n48\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.885\nIt's the reason why we want to,\nwell deliver this\n\n49\n00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:48.755\nparticular project, and\nwe wanna make this change.\n\n50\n00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:51.127\nThis is what a business case is.\n\n51\n00:02:51.127 --> 00:02:54.441\nAnd so the business case theme,\nnot only makes sure\n\n52\n00:02:54.441 --> 00:03:00.220\nthat we have a viable business case,\nbut also that we have a viable product.\n\n53\n00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.660\nAnd that we are going to\nevaluate that viable product and\n\n54\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.700\nthe viable business case\nthroughout the project.\n\n55\n00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.660\nRemember, we're going to continually\njustify the business base.\n\n56\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.160\nThis is just a one off thing that we do.\n\n57\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.407\nWe don't just want a business case\nat the beginning of our project,\n\n58\n00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:26.431\nwe want a business case throughout\nour project that is viable and\n\n59\n00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:29.131\nthat meets the needs of the organization.\n\n60\n00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:30.315\nIn other words,\n\n61\n00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:35.647\nensuring that what we are delivering\nmeets the needs of the organization.\n\n62\n00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:36.826\nSo let's take a look.\n\n63\n00:03:36.826 --> 00:03:42.284\nAnd again, this is from our PRINCE2, I had\nto think about what work we were on there.\n\n64\n00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:45.430\n[LAUGH] This is from our PRINCE2 manual.\n\n65\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.310\nSo this is our official PRINCE2 manual.\n\n66\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.100\nAnd here you'll see, that what we\nhave are the outputs, outcomes, and\n\n67\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.275\nbenefits of the business case thing.\n\n68\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.800\nNow what we want to do,\nis make sure that we have got all\n\n69\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.080\nof our business changes considered\nwithin the business case thing.\n\n70\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.330\nThat we have considered\nany side effects and\n\n71\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.670\nany consequences when we\ndocument the business case.\n\n72\n00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.518\nThat we've considered any risks, or\n\n73\n00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:22.700\nanything that might jeopardize\nthis particular new product.\n\n74\n00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.216\nOr anything that might come\nout of this new product\n\n75\n00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:30.750\nthat is not necessarily gonna be\na benefit to the organisation.\n\n76\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.077\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n77\n00:04:32.077 --> 00:04:34.772\nWell let's think about this from\na more practical perspective.\n\n78\n00:04:34.772 --> 00:04:39.476\nSometimes we implement a new\noperating system for instance.\n\n79\n00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:42.408\nAnd by implementing that\nnew operating system,\n\n80\n00:04:42.408 --> 00:04:46.310\nwe might implement tighter\nsecurity measures.\n\n81\n00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.492\nBut as a result of that it means\nthat we have a new password policy,\n\n82\n00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:57.729\nand that new password policy is so tight,\nthat it actually becomes insecure.\n\n83\n00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.052\nBecause people then start writing\npasswords down on post it notes and\n\n84\n00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:05.489\npieces of paper and\nleaving it under keyboards, etc.\n\n85\n00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:08.481\nThat's what we'd call a disbenefit.\n\n86\n00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:12.820\nThat's actually, well,\na risk that we have to consider.\n\n87\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.140\nIt's something that is not\na benefit to the organization.\n\n88\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.527\nSomething that is a result of\nimplementing that new product.\n\n89\n00:05:23.527 --> 00:05:26.652\nWhat I really want you to remember\nis the fact, [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n90\n00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:30.467\nwhat I want you to consider is the fact\nthat, not everything is positive.\n\n91\n00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:34.954\nAnd when we bring in a new product,\nwhen we do something new for\n\n92\n00:05:34.954 --> 00:05:39.980\nthe organization, sometimes\nthe results are not always positive.\n\n93\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.690\nAnd so we have to ensure that our business\ncase documents all of the results,\n\n94\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.480\nincluding the benefits.\n\n95\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.040\nWe have to ensure that we are meeting\nthe needs of the organization,\n\n96\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.820\nmaybe the strategic objectives as we have\nin the bottom right hand corner, but\n\n97\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.130\nthat we are also able to\nquantify any potential, well,\n\n98\n00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.160\nthis benefits as they're called.\n\n99\n00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.280\nSomething that is an adverse effect\n\n100\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.290\nof that particular implementation\nof that particular new product.\n\n101\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.750\nThat also has to be mentioned\nin the business case.\n\n102\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.630\nSo the business case itself, well, as\nI've said, it doesn't necessarily have to\n\n103\n00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.340\nbe a specific document, but it's something\nthat does need to be recorded somewhere.\n\n104\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.370\nSo if we have a project\nmanagement tool that we use,\n\n105\n00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.500\nwe might have the business\ncase recorded in there.\n\n106\n00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.260\nBut it's about justification for\nthe project,\n\n107\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.120\nit's about ensuring that we keep\nthe business case up to date.\n\n108\n00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.865\nI was gonna be really sneaky and just ask\nJustin another trick question as to how\n\n109\n00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:51.001\nmany versions of the business case are\nthere, but to be perfectly honest there\n\n110\n00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:55.156\ncould be as many versions as you need,\ndepending on how long that project was.\n\n111\n00:06:55.156 --> 00:06:56.562\nJustin is looking pleased\nwith himself now.\n\n112\n00:06:56.562 --> 00:06:58.183\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't gonna be a trick question cuz\n\n113\n00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:01.585\nthat's actually how I was gonna answer it,\nas many versions as there needs to be.\n\n114\n00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:02.897\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n115\n00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:04.940\nAnd the business case is not just,\n\n116\n00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.943\nI guess a common misconception is that the\nbusiness case is just produced that once,\n\n117\n00:07:09.943 --> 00:07:12.880\nright, at the very\nbeginning of the project.\n\n118\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.624\nAnd it's kind of almost encased in\nsort of, and it's encased in gold and\n\n119\n00:07:18.624 --> 00:07:22.877\nit's kept somewhere never\nto be touched ever again.\n\n120\n00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:27.925\nThat's not the case, you are revisiting\nthat business case on a regular basis.\n\n121\n00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:32.912\nAt the end of each stage, you want to\nensure that before your next stage of your\n\n122\n00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:37.749\nproject, that your project is aligned\nto the needs of the organization and\n\n123\n00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:41.466\nthat it actually delivers\nthe right business benefits.\n\n124\n00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:47.272\nWhat we're also doing here in this\nparticular theme is we are ensuring,\n\n125\n00:07:47.272 --> 00:07:51.937\nthat we develop an approach to\nmanaging that business case\n\n126\n00:07:51.937 --> 00:07:55.944\nthat we can then use for\neach subsequent project.\n\n127\n00:07:55.944 --> 00:08:01.047\nRemember from our previous episode,\nwe're not just tailoring on a project by\n\n128\n00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:06.010\nproject basis, we're not considering\nthis on a project by project basis.\n\n129\n00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:11.336\nWe are considering a methodology and\ntailoring a methodology that is needed for\n\n130\n00:08:11.336 --> 00:08:16.996\nour organization, a methodology that's\ngoing to work with every single project.\n\n131\n00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.999\nYour were thinking about something there,\nJustin, that kind of worried me.\n\n132\n00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.595\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking about how this\n\n133\n00:08:22.595 --> 00:08:26.510\nis going to morph at\nthe end of each stage.\n\n134\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:31.870\nIf at some point where you\nhave no possible business,\n\n135\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.980\nlike you can't justify anything\nthat's going to add business value,\n\n136\n00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.350\nat that point does that\nmean the project's over?\n\n137\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.690\nEven if thats an unforeseen\nkinda end point?\n\n138\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.430\n&gt;&gt; You know Not every project\n\n139\n00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.510\nfinishes successfully.\n\n140\n00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:50.030\nYou'd be surprised just how many projects\ndon't actually make it through to the end.\n\n141\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.950\nWe have this sort of general misconception\nthat every single project has got to be,\n\n142\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.120\nhas got to be followed through until,\nthrough to fruition, through to the end,\n\n143\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.830\nbut that's not necessarily the case.\n\n144\n00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.734\nSome projects do actually Close midstream,\n\n145\n00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:08.543\nnot all projects go\nthrough to the very end.\n\n146\n00:09:08.543 --> 00:09:11.843\nIt may be because the business\nhas changed its direction and\n\n147\n00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:14.730\ntherefore the project\nis no longer required.\n\n148\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.930\nBut this is one of the reasons why we\nhave to evaluate the business case\n\n149\n00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.020\non a regular basis.\n\n150\n00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.390\nAnd we do that because we wanna ensure\nthat the project remains viable,\n\n151\n00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.900\nto the needs of the business and\nnot just to our requirement.\n\n152\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.880\nSo part of, then, the business case, or\n\n153\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.530\nthe development of the business case\nis to ensure that well, we develop it.\n\n154\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.830\nWe verify it on a regular basis,\nthat's part of the maintenance.\n\n155\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.200\nAnd then we confirm with\nthe business as well,\n\n156\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.340\nthis is not just something\nthat we want to do.\n\n157\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.440\nThis is something that we do on\na regular basis with the organization.\n\n158\n00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.290\nBecause after all,\nthis is called a business case,\n\n159\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.500\nthis is not called an IT case,\nit's called a business case.\n\n160\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:07.530\nSo let's take a look at a graphic that\nwe've got here from our prints to book.\n\n161\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.120\nNow I wonder if we can take a look\nat this full screen for a moment.\n\n162\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.800\nYou'll see that the business case, well\nthe activities in the business case go\n\n163\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.000\nright the way throughout\nthe length of the project.\n\n164\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.265\nAnd the reason why I wanted to take\nthis full screen because you'll see,\n\n165\n00:10:22.265 --> 00:10:26.600\nthat the benefits management approach and\nwe'll come on to that in another episode,\n\n166\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.950\ngoes right the way through until\nthe very end of the project.\n\n167\n00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.900\nSo we're developing a business\ncase pre-project and\n\n168\n00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.630\nthen we're going to maintain it\nthroughout the project to make sure\n\n169\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.310\nthat the project is going to meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n170\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.380\nBut the benefits management approach,\nthat ensures that what we\n\n171\n00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:52.110\nare delivering is meeting\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n172\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.860\nSo what's in purple in\nthose arrows is proactive,\n\n173\n00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.410\nensuring that we're going to meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n174\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.380\nBut what's in orange, that benefits\nmanagements approach is reactive,\n\n175\n00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.026\nit's looking at what we've\nalready produced and\n\n176\n00:11:06.026 --> 00:11:09.000\nmaking sure it does meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n177\n00:11:10.713 --> 00:11:12.840\nYour thinking Justin that worries me.\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo,\n\n178\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.710\nI just wanna make sure that\nI understand this correctly.\n\n179\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.450\nThat subsequent delivery stages,\n\n180\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.810\neven though in this graphic\nit's represented as one time.\n\n181\n00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.544\nThat could actually be 4, 5, 6, 7,\n\n182\n00:11:21.544 --> 00:11:23.040\n8 at nauseam.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n183\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.319\n&gt;&gt; Over the length of the project.\n\n184\n00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:24.848\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n185\n00:11:24.848 --> 00:11:26.524\n&gt;&gt; Because we're gonna be kind of short\n\n186\n00:11:26.524 --> 00:11:28.660\niterations that we're reconfirming.\n\n187\n00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.240\nThe benefits to the business at the end of\n\n188\n00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.810\neach of those stages.\n&gt;&gt; So there is a difference between\n\n189\n00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.840\na traditional, what we called waterfall\napproach and an agile approach.\n\n190\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.370\nAnd PRINCE2 will accommodate both and\nin fact,\n\n191\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.310\nwe do have another series that\nspecifically looks at PRINCE2 and agile.\n\n192\n00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.140\nBut a waterfall approach is where\nwe develop on a regular basis.\n\n193\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:55.740\nBut then we will not release until\nthe end of the actual project itself.\n\n194\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.440\nNow even though that's a traditional\napproach, you'd still be doing benefits\n\n195\n00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.920\nmanagement throughout sort of\nthe iterations of development.\n\n196\n00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.850\nBecause we're still gonna test\nall of the development stages.\n\n197\n00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.790\nWith an agile approach we're\nreleasing that to the organization\n\n198\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.510\non a regular basis and again what we're\ngoing to be doing is we still gonna be,\n\n199\n00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.980\nlooking at the benefits\nthat have been achieved and\n\n200\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.840\nensuring that they meet the needs\nof the organization and\n\n201\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.830\nthat they actually are true to\nwhat's defined in the business case.\n\n202\n00:12:29.942 --> 00:12:31.440\nBut it's obviously more visible for\n\n203\n00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.780\nthe organisation, when we're\ndoing it from an agile approach.\n\n204\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.890\nwhereas a waterfall approach\nis to a certain extent more\n\n205\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.270\nhidden from the organisation,\nbecause we're not realising until the end.\n\n206\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:47.520\nSo, the sort of things we expect to\nfind in a business case and by the way,\n\n207\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.100\nthis is not a definitive list of what you\nshould expect to find in a business case.\n\n208\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:58.590\nThis is just, very simply, a potential\nlist of content for a business case.\n\n209\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.040\nAnd it includes things like an investment\nappraisal, it includes timescales and\n\n210\n00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:09.700\ncosts, justifications, reasons and\nthe options that are available to us.\n\n211\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.820\nThis is something that I\ndo want to mention to you,\n\n212\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.370\nis a business case is not\njust the fate to complete.\n\n213\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.970\nA business case is not just the \"This\nis what we're going to do and\n\n214\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.320\nthen that's it.\".\n\n215\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.540\nThe business case has to list all of\nthe options that are available and\n\n216\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.470\nit mentions there about do something and\ndo the minimum and do nothing.\n\n217\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.220\nBut the business case also\nhas to have a recommendation.\n\n218\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.690\nSo I'm gonna bring in a couple of acronyms\nand now I'm gonna test Justin on this.\n\n219\n00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.760\nDo you know what\nthe difference between VOI and\n\n220\n00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.869\nROI is?\n&gt;&gt; Say that first one again?\n\n221\n00:13:45.869 --> 00:13:46.911\n&gt;&gt; VOI and\n\n222\n00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:50.270\nROI.\n&gt;&gt; Value on investment and\n\n223\n00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.390\nreturn on investment?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n224\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.693\nOkay now define them.\n&gt;&gt; Alright so\n\n225\n00:13:55.693 --> 00:13:59.200\nreturn on investment is I'm putting\nin some of the monetary amount.\n\n226\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.840\nWhat percentage am I\ngonna get back on that\n\n227\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.960\ninvestment?\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n228\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.753\n&gt;&gt; Value on investment, I don't know,\n\n229\n00:14:07.753 --> 00:14:10.839\nI feel like they're related.\n\n230\n00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:15.127\nWhat value is it gonna bring to my\nbusiness based on this respective\n\n231\n00:14:15.127 --> 00:14:16.370\ninvestment?\n\n232\n00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.970\nI don't know.\n\n233\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.671\nI'm spitting all over here, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was just gonna say, we're\n\n234\n00:14:19.671 --> 00:14:22.097\nstruggling here, aren't we Justin, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n235\n00:14:22.097 --> 00:14:23.730\nwe didn't need to make that out loud.\n\n236\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.875\nEverybody could see it,\nthey were like, he's so dumb.\n\n237\n00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:30.060\n[LAUGH] Those are different,\nyou were right about ROI,\n\n238\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.840\neverybody knows about ROI.\n\n239\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.170\nReturn of investment is about the\nfinancial return, what value, what return,\n\n240\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.470\nare we going to get?\n\n241\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:43.060\nSo is this new product going to\nmake us more money as a business,\n\n242\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.984\nbut then we also have\nnon-financial returns.\n\n243\n00:14:45.984 --> 00:14:48.540\nNon-financial returns may.\n\n244\n00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.180\nThen in fact should result in\nsome financial returns but\n\n245\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.730\nthey may be more difficult to justify, so\n\n246\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.220\nthings like adherence to government\nregulations, for instance.\n\n247\n00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.910\nOne of the hot topics right now is GDPR,\nyeah, so\n\n248\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.930\nthat would be considered to\nbe a non-financial return.\n\n249\n00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:09.080\nCuz what we're trying to do by\nadhering to GDPR is actually, well,\n\n250\n00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.880\nit's avoidance of fines.\n\n251\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.550\nThat's what we're trying to do.\n\n252\n00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.350\nSo that would be considered\nto be the value return, so\n\n253\n00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.750\nvalue on investment rather than\na financial return which is the ROI,\n\n254\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.050\nso that's the difference between them.\n\n255\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.730\nAnd the reason why I mentioned this\nright now is because this has to be\n\n256\n00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.730\nin your business case.\n\n257\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.945\nYou don't just want financial returns\nin your business case you also want any\n\n258\n00:15:32.945 --> 00:15:38.603\nnon-financial returns as well.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm guessing the value\n\n259\n00:15:38.603 --> 00:15:44.108\non investment can also be\nperceived as the human factor.\n\n260\n00:15:44.108 --> 00:15:46.226\nWhat things we're gonna\nget back as a human thing?\n\n261\n00:15:46.226 --> 00:15:49.490\nCuz if you bring up the GDPR,\nif you're avoiding fines,\n\n262\n00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.074\nI feel like that's still\ntied to financial.\n\n263\n00:15:52.074 --> 00:15:56.984\nAnd then if you don't adhere to it and\nyour competitors do then...\n\n264\n00:15:56.984 --> 00:16:00.810\nThere are still a financial implications,\nbut what about respecting employee,\n\n265\n00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.313\nI don’t know, happiness with their role,\nis that a value on investment?\n\n266\n00:16:04.313 --> 00:16:06.248\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, I mean it could be.\n\n267\n00:16:06.248 --> 00:16:11.040\nAbsolutely anything that you might\nconsider to be intangible could be\n\n268\n00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.160\na value on investment return.\n\n269\n00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.671\nAnd, but then as I said,\nin most instances we can.\n\n270\n00:16:17.671 --> 00:16:22.593\nIf we do a lot of tweaking,\nif we do a lot of exploratory work,\n\n271\n00:16:22.593 --> 00:16:27.528\nwe can turn the value on investment\ninto a financial return.\n\n272\n00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:29.801\nIt's just that it's more\ndifficult to do so.\n\n273\n00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:34.424\nAnd you mentioned about\nthe fact that with that GDPR it\n\n274\n00:16:34.424 --> 00:16:39.056\nshould probably translate\ninto a financial return.\n\n275\n00:16:39.056 --> 00:16:41.663\nThe fact of the matter is yes,\nit should, but\n\n276\n00:16:41.663 --> 00:16:44.554\nit's not gonna be necessarily\neasy to quantify.\n\n277\n00:16:44.554 --> 00:16:48.162\nIt's things like a value on\na investment return would be\n\n278\n00:16:48.162 --> 00:16:52.400\nsomething like getting to market\nearly before our competitors.\n\n279\n00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.512\nNow that should translate to a financial\nreturn, but how do you prove it?\n\n280\n00:16:57.512 --> 00:16:59.153\nHow do you demonstrate that?\n\n281\n00:16:59.153 --> 00:17:00.870\nWell, it's the same with,\n\n282\n00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:05.247\nas you say increased morale will\ndefinitely create a financial return.\n\n283\n00:17:05.247 --> 00:17:10.112\nBecause increased morale will create a,\nhopefully staff\n\n284\n00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:15.285\nthat are a lot more productive,\nbut how do you quantify that?\n\n285\n00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:20.655\nAnd this is why we consider those\nto be value returns as well.\n\n286\n00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:23.000\nDoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense,\n\n287\n00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.651\ntypically we're gonna say things value\non investment are based on things that\n\n288\n00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:32.302\nare hard to quantify in order to provide\na metric for this is what it was before,\n\n289\n00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.373\nthis is what it is after.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:17:34.373 --> 00:17:36.402\n&gt;&gt; Just because either there are a lot of\n\n291\n00:17:36.402 --> 00:17:39.619\nfactors involved, or\nit's just categorical in nature.\n\n292\n00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:42.546\nLike what is your relative happiness?\n\n293\n00:17:42.546 --> 00:17:43.712\nBetter than it was?\n\n294\n00:17:43.712 --> 00:17:45.465\nLike, what does that mean?\n\n295\n00:17:45.465 --> 00:17:48.398\nSo there's not any\nquantifiable statistics.\n\n296\n00:17:48.398 --> 00:17:52.516\nAs you said, we can kind of hand wave and\nmake that quantifiable, but\n\n297\n00:17:52.516 --> 00:17:57.278\nis it really does it bring any additional\nvalue to our intelligence about that.\n\n298\n00:17:57.278 --> 00:17:58.003\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n299\n00:17:58.003 --> 00:18:02.597\nin fact the slide that we’ve got\nright now, looks at techniques and\n\n300\n00:18:02.597 --> 00:18:07.836\nthe things we might want to consider\nwhen we are compiling the business case,\n\n301\n00:18:07.836 --> 00:18:10.593\nthings like, sort of whole life costs.\n\n302\n00:18:10.593 --> 00:18:15.306\nWe've always called this TCO, in terms\nof IT, Total Cost of Ownership including\n\n303\n00:18:15.306 --> 00:18:18.880\nthings like electricity and\nlicensing, that sort of thing.\n\n304\n00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.982\nBut what about the payback period and\ndiscounted cash flow, sensitivity\n\n305\n00:18:23.982 --> 00:18:29.670\nanalysis, these are also the things that\nwe might consider in our business case.\n\n306\n00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.659\nNow we are in foundation level, and\n\n307\n00:18:32.659 --> 00:18:36.653\nI do not expect you to be\nexperts in any of these.\n\n308\n00:18:36.653 --> 00:18:40.084\nBut I do not expect you to\nknow about any of these,\n\n309\n00:18:40.084 --> 00:18:44.456\nwe are not looking at a financial\nmanagement class right now.\n\n310\n00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:49.818\nHowever, when we come back in practitioner\nand we take a look at our practitioners'\n\n311\n00:18:49.818 --> 00:18:54.822\ntheories, then we are certainly going\nto be exploring these in more details.\n\n312\n00:18:54.822 --> 00:18:59.707\nWhat we are going to do though is\njust take a look at who should\n\n313\n00:18:59.707 --> 00:19:03.442\nbe involved in compiling\nthe business case.\n\n314\n00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:07.371\nIt tells us here that our executive\nis responsible, I'm gonna use\n\n315\n00:19:07.371 --> 00:19:11.663\nthe word accountable here, for\nensuring that there is a business case.\n\n316\n00:19:11.663 --> 00:19:17.564\nBut the user has a responsibly\nto outline what it is they want.\n\n317\n00:19:17.564 --> 00:19:20.804\nThey have a responsibility to\noutline their requirements.\n\n318\n00:19:20.804 --> 00:19:26.023\nBut the project manager actually\ncompiles the business case.\n\n319\n00:19:26.023 --> 00:19:28.491\nAnd he has accountability for\n\n320\n00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:33.830\nensuring that that business case\nis updated on a regular basis.\n\n321\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.616\nAnd how often do we wanna check the\nviability of the business case, Justin?\n\n322\n00:19:37.616 --> 00:19:39.076\n&gt;&gt; At the end of every stage.\n\n323\n00:19:39.076 --> 00:19:39.993\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\n\n324\n00:19:39.993 --> 00:19:43.671\nto make sure that going into\nthe next stage, he is listening.\n\n325\n00:19:43.671 --> 00:19:49.418\nTo make sure they're going into each\nparticular stage that we are doing\n\n326\n00:19:49.418 --> 00:19:54.993\nthe right thing, that we're still\nheading in the right direction.\n\n327\n00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:57.296\nAnd a lot of what we talked about so\n\n328\n00:19:57.296 --> 00:20:01.256\nfar with the business case\nhas been fairly theoretical.\n\n329\n00:20:01.256 --> 00:20:04.335\nEvery single business case\nis going to be unique and\n\n330\n00:20:04.335 --> 00:20:06.637\nis going to be unique to each project.\n\n331\n00:20:06.637 --> 00:20:11.588\nHowever, when we're talking\nabout being efficient what we\n\n332\n00:20:11.588 --> 00:20:16.732\nmean is that we need to ensure\nthat we have a consistent approach\n\n333\n00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:21.701\nto defining a business case and\nto managing a business case.\n\n334\n00:20:21.701 --> 00:20:28.101\nAnd that approach is applicable throughout\nour project management methodology.\n\n335\n00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:32.647\nSo was the content of\nthe business case is going to be\n\n336\n00:20:32.647 --> 00:20:36.466\nappropriate to each individual project?\n\n337\n00:20:36.466 --> 00:20:42.253\nThe business case template and\nthe approach to compiling the business\n\n338\n00:20:42.253 --> 00:20:49.135\ncase should be consistent across every\nsingle project and across our methodolog.\n\n339\n00:20:49.135 --> 00:20:54.513\nSo that at a foundation level\nis our business case thing.\n\n340\n00:20:54.513 --> 00:20:59.461\nAnd in the next episode, we're going to\nexplore further all of our themes within\n\n341\n00:20:59.461 --> 00:21:03.561\nbrainstorm and we;re going to look\nat the theme of organization.\n\n342\n00:21:03.561 --> 00:21:04.351\n&gt;&gt; Jo, thank you so\n\n343\n00:21:04.351 --> 00:21:06.446\nmuch for covering the business case theme.\n\n344\n00:21:06.446 --> 00:21:09.637\nThat's definitely something that have\nin organizations but it's not at\n\n345\n00:21:09.637 --> 00:21:12.735\nthe forefront of decision making and\ncould call some definite issues.\n\n346\n00:21:12.735 --> 00:21:16.379\nBut definitely come on back as we\ncontinue to look at Prince2 themes,\n\n347\n00:21:16.379 --> 00:21:18.003\norganization in particular.\n\n348\n00:21:18.003 --> 00:21:19.822\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n349\n00:21:19.822 --> 00:21:22.622\nSo, signing off for ITPROTV,\nI’ve been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n350\n00:21:22.622 --> 00:21:23.486\n&gt;&gt; And I’m Jo

welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPROTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.262\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:22.020\nAnd we're continuing on with our\nPrince2 2017 foundation series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.270\nIn this episode, we're going to be\nlooking at the organization theme.\n\n10\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.275\nAnd here to help us along is Ms.\nJo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:28.240\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.530\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Justin.\n\n13\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.300\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.164\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n15\n00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:37.273\nNow, organization,\nseems like that could be macroscopic,\n\n16\n00:00:37.273 --> 00:00:40.330\ntalking about the actual business.\n\n17\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.155\nOr are we talking about how I\nput the pencils on my desk?\n\n18\n00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:47.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What probably a little bit of\nboth to be perfectly honest, it depends on\n\n19\n00:00:47.517 --> 00:00:52.770\nhow sort you obsessive you wanna get with\nputting your pencil in your desk, really.\n\n20\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.190\nNo, I'll be serious, I am not interested\nin putting a pencils on your desk.\n\n21\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.440\nWhat I am interested in though,\n\n22\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.690\nis how we organize ourselves to\nbe able to deliver a project?\n\n23\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.602\nYou've seen an organizational chart,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:09.298\n&gt;&gt; Are we talking about like hierarchical,\nlike the chief executive, and COO,\n\n25\n00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:10.492\nCIO and-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n26\n00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:11.507\n&gt;&gt; And who reports to them?\n\n27\n00:01:11.507 --> 00:01:14.455\nYeah, I've seen this.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what we're going to do is\n\n28\n00:01:14.455 --> 00:01:19.279\nwe're going to take a look at\nan organization chart for a project.\n\n29\n00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.790\nNow, there are a couple of things that\nI want you to remember for a project.\n\n30\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.370\nAnd the first is the fact that\na project is a temporary entity.\n\n31\n00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.140\nSo a project is something that is set\nup to deliver a specific product.\n\n32\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.750\nSo when we have our business\ncase established and\n\n33\n00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.620\nour business case is\ngiven the sign off and\n\n34\n00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.700\nwe have that justification,\nthen we will collect our project team.\n\n35\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.810\nAnd that means collecting people\nwith all of the right skills, and\n\n36\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.800\nassigning them the right roles and\nresponsibilities within the project.\n\n37\n00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.930\nThe bigger the scale of the project,\nthe more people you're likely to have.\n\n38\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.570\nAnd that could include internal people,\nit could include external people.\n\n39\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.200\nSo think about an organizational chart,\nand\n\n40\n00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.830\nthen add in roles and responsibilities.\n\n41\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.870\nAdd in a hierarchy and\nthat's what we're gonna end up with.\n\n42\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.465\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of stuff going on there,\nJo.\n\n43\n00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:20.847\nAll right, so roles of responsibilities we\nneed a high ark a key, a high ark a key,\n\n44\n00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:21.444\na hierarchy.\n\n45\n00:02:21.444 --> 00:02:22.458\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of those them.\n\n46\n00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:26.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of those and this is just\nan organizational chart where we have\n\n47\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.823\nthe list of respected individuals or\nwith roles and responsibilities is that\n\n48\n00:02:31.823 --> 00:02:37.090\nnow I'm going to abstract a way into\nthe departments or anything like that?\n\n49\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.480\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember of course PRINCE2\nis cross functional as well.\n\n50\n00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.770\nSo cross functional means you\ncross the functional teams and\n\n51\n00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.540\nthe functional sort of,\nthe set up that we have within our IT.\n\n52\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.675\nSo we're gonna be pulling people with\ndifferent skills from different teams.\n\n53\n00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.481\nAnd yeah, by the way, we're probably\nnot going to be needing the same people\n\n54\n00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:00.020\nthroughout the duration\nof the project too.\n\n55\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.940\nSo we're going to be pulling\nthem in as and when we need.\n\n56\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.554\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat's on the screen.\n\n57\n00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:11.068\nDo you like the look of that?\n\n58\n00:03:11.068 --> 00:03:13.435\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of words Jo,\nI'm not gonna lie.\n\n59\n00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:15.930\nThere's a lot of words and lines on that.\n\n60\n00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.880\n&gt;&gt; You'll notice that what we've got\non the screen in front of you is just\n\n61\n00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.210\na list of the roles that\nwe've got to fill and\n\n62\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.220\nthe responsibilities\nthat they have as well.\n\n63\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.171\nSo we've got somebody that\nneeds to provide guidance.\n\n64\n00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:34.981\nAnd that means, providing sort of minimum\nrequirements of the actual project,\n\n65\n00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:38.093\nguidance on how we're going\nto manage the project,\n\n66\n00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.680\nwhat are the stages going to be like, etc.\n\n67\n00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.640\nAnd then all of the documentation\nthat goes along with that.\n\n68\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.256\nWe do like documentation, and\nthen we've got somebody that's gonna\n\n69\n00:03:47.256 --> 00:03:51.200\nmanage stakeholders, or we've got\na role that will manage stakeholders.\n\n70\n00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.340\nWe've got a role that will\ndeal with support and\n\n71\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.360\nthen all of the activities\nthat are under that.\n\n72\n00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.560\nThis is not an exhaustive, exhaustive\nis easy for me to say, isn't it?\n\n73\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.285\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is not a definitive list.\n\n74\n00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:07.355\nAll right, this is not supposed\nto be a definitive list.\n\n75\n00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:10.975\nOver on the left-hand side, what you have\ngot there, and I wonder if we could just\n\n76\n00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:15.085\ngo full-screen for a moment,\nbecause that left-hand side here,\n\n77\n00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:20.845\nif I can find my mouse, just here, this\nhas come straight out of the PRINCE2 book.\n\n78\n00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:26.935\nAnd you'll see that we've got corporate\nprogram management or the customer.\n\n79\n00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:31.258\nAnd then you've got a directing level,\nyou've got a managing level, and\n\n80\n00:04:31.258 --> 00:04:34.000\nyou've got a delivering level.\n\n81\n00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.070\nAnd all of these have\ngot managers in them.\n\n82\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.560\nSo let's just take a look at this for\na moment,\n\n83\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.740\nand we're gonna go through\nthis one slide at a time.\n\n84\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.970\nBut at the corporate level,\nat the program management level.\n\n85\n00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.440\nYou've got somebody that's\ngoing to be making decisions.\n\n86\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.043\nWhat sort of decisions do you\nthink their gonna be making?\n\n87\n00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.750\n&gt;&gt; The program management.\n\n88\n00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n89\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.660\n&gt;&gt; I guess like a,\nI have no idea Jo, I don't know.\n\n90\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.431\n[LAUGH] It's above my pay grade,\nI'm not at that level.\n\n91\n00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm like, I don't know.\n\n92\n00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:07.382\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's probably above\na lot of our pay grades, but\n\n93\n00:05:07.382 --> 00:05:09.715\nthey're gonna be making\ndecisions on strategy.\n\n94\n00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:12.725\nSo the decisions that they're\ngoing to be making there,\n\n95\n00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:17.020\nare the decisions that are based on\nthe prioritization of the project.\n\n96\n00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.860\nSo we're here in PRINCE2 and\nwe're looking at project management, but\n\n97\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.530\nsomebody's got to give us,\nwell, direction.\n\n98\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.120\nSomebody's got to give us strategy.\n\n99\n00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.370\nSomebody has got to say, this is\nhow much money you've got to spend.\n\n100\n00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.612\nThis is how quickly I want it.\n\n101\n00:05:33.612 --> 00:05:38.858\nAnd this is who we want it delivered to\nand this is who's going to use it and\n\n102\n00:05:38.858 --> 00:05:43.120\nthis is who's gonna benefit and\nthis is why we need it.\n\n103\n00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.830\nThis is our justification.\n\n104\n00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.030\nSo that happens at that level,\n\n105\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.390\nif I can find my cursor again,\nthat happens at this level here.\n\n106\n00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.293\nThat's this corporate management level.\n\n107\n00:05:54.293 --> 00:05:56.270\nI mean, let's be honest.\n\n108\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.620\nI have never come across an organization\n\n109\n00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.770\nthat has only ever had one project\nin play at any one point in time.\n\n110\n00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.850\nI mean, I don't know whether you have.\n\n111\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.060\nNo, there's usually\nmany irons in the fire.\n\n112\n00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.729\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Regardless of where you are.\n\n113\n00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.632\n&gt;&gt; And so, what's happening at that level,\nand that's where the decisions are being\n\n114\n00:06:14.632 --> 00:06:17.824\nmade and that's where your\npriorities are being set.\n\n115\n00:06:17.824 --> 00:06:21.927\nThis is also where decisions would be made\nsort of part way through the project.\n\n116\n00:06:21.927 --> 00:06:25.468\nBut we discussed in a previous episode\nabout the fact that some projects\n\n117\n00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.450\nare terminated unexpectedly.\n\n118\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.614\nSome projects just, you know, we just\nhave to shelve them for whatever reason.\n\n119\n00:06:32.614 --> 00:06:35.970\nMaybe they're no longer viable\nfrom a business perspective or\n\n120\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.282\nmaybe the business has changed direction.\n\n121\n00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:42.120\nAnd that's where that decision\nis made at that level.\n\n122\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.670\nSo think about all of the roles and\nresponsibilities and\n\n123\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.690\nwho is involved at that particular level.\n\n124\n00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.550\nThis is not even at the project level,\nbut they're going to direct the project.\n\n125\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.023\nSo that's our corporate or\nprogram management level.\n\n126\n00:06:56.023 --> 00:07:00.020\nThese are generally senior people,\nthese are our customers.\n\n127\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.300\nWhile we're on the subject, do you know\nwhat the difference between a customer and\n\n128\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.050\na user is?\n\n129\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.756\n&gt;&gt; Customer pays for it, a user uses it?\n\n130\n00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:12.770\nI guess maybe a customer is a paying user.\n\n131\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not necessarily, no, you should\nhave just stopped with the first bit,\n\n132\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.110\ncuz it really was that simple.\n\n133\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.950\n&gt;&gt; That's when you gave me that sideways.\n\n134\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.083\nI was like, I should keep talking.\n\n135\n00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:25.680\n&gt;&gt; No, no, don't keep talking, stop.\n\n136\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.607\nKnow when to stop,\na customer pays, simple as that,\n\n137\n00:07:30.607 --> 00:07:33.901\nbut a customer is sometimes a user.\n\n138\n00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:36.380\nThat one could be a fairly difficult\nconcept to get your head around.\n\n139\n00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.030\nSo let's come up with another example,\nokay.\n\n140\n00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.910\nJustin, let me say that I took you\nout to the coffee shop today and\n\n141\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.870\nI bought you a coffee.\n\n142\n00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.050\nAm I the customer or am I a user?\n\n143\n00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.280\n&gt;&gt; You bought me a coffee.\n\n144\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.960\nYou're the one who paid,\nso you're a customer.\n\n145\n00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.826\n&gt;&gt; And what are you?\n\n146\n00:07:54.826 --> 00:07:56.510\n&gt;&gt; I am the user of said coffee.\n\n147\n00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:02.636\n&gt;&gt; Right, I didn't buy myself one though I\nwas just feeling really, really generous.\n\n148\n00:08:02.636 --> 00:08:05.300\nSo I'm a customer, and he's a user.\n\n149\n00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.200\nHowever, I might buy myself one, too.\n\n150\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:14.440\nAnd if I buy myself one as well, then\nI am a customer, but I am also a user.\n\n151\n00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.190\nHow does that relate to IT?\n\n152\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.940\nWell, really simple.\n\n153\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:23.460\nGenerally, our customers, well, they\ncould be users but generally they're not.\n\n154\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.210\nA customer is somebody who has influence\nover whether the money is spent.\n\n155\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.970\nSo it's somebody with the purse strings.\n\n156\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.420\nIt's somebody with\nthe budget to give to IT so\n\n157\n00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.690\na customer is generally somebody\nin a senior management position.\n\n158\n00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.300\nIt might be a cost center manager,\nor it might your CFO.\n\n159\n00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.490\nIt might be your sales director,\nfor instance.\n\n160\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.512\nThey would be a customer.\n\n161\n00:08:45.512 --> 00:08:49.250\nSo they're not necessarily using\nthe product that you are delivering.\n\n162\n00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.548\nThat's an important\ndifferentiation to make.\n\n163\n00:08:52.548 --> 00:08:55.440\nAnd it's just something\nthat I kind of want to\n\n164\n00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.650\npay a little bit of attention to because\nI'm gonna go back to this coffee shop now.\n\n165\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.800\nSo we're going into a coffee shop.\n\n166\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.860\nAnd I'm taking you for a coffee,\nand I'm not having more myself.\n\n167\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.160\nI'm just a customer.\n\n168\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.150\nWhat am I interested in?\n\n169\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.614\nIn that relationship with that coffee\nshop, what am I interested in?\n\n170\n00:09:19.614 --> 00:09:22.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if you are not a user,\nyou're not having a coffee.\n\n171\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.449\nYou are only buying the coffee.\n\n172\n00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:25.528\nI'm guessing price of said coffee.\n\n173\n00:09:25.528 --> 00:09:30.496\n&gt;&gt; Price of said coffee, and\nalso whether the cup is full.\n\n174\n00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:32.938\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wanna get value for money.\n\n175\n00:09:32.938 --> 00:09:34.711\nDo I care about the taste?\n\n176\n00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:37.760\n&gt;&gt; I'm the one drinking it,\nso I would suspect not.\n\n177\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.938\n&gt;&gt; No, right, but you're the user.\n\n178\n00:09:40.938 --> 00:09:43.500\nWhat do you care about?\n\n179\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:50.350\n&gt;&gt; The taste, the temperature,\nwhat additives, if any, the texture.\n\n180\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.960\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about quality, right?\n\n181\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.874\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n182\n00:09:52.874 --> 00:09:55.463\n&gt;&gt; I know he's gonna drag me outside for\na coffee in a minute.\n\n183\n00:09:55.463 --> 00:09:59.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You care about the quality, and\n\n184\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:04.412\nyet as a customer, I don't\nnecessarily care about the quality.\n\n185\n00:10:04.412 --> 00:10:08.022\n&gt;&gt; Now, I know every single one of you now\nis sitting there going, that's not true,\n\n186\n00:10:08.022 --> 00:10:08.825\nthat's not true.\n\n187\n00:10:08.825 --> 00:10:11.610\nBut hang on a minute,\nbecause we're building on this.\n\n188\n00:10:13.392 --> 00:10:15.800\nAnd now I'm gonna get to the however.\n\n189\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.500\nAs a customer, I'm interested in value for\n\n190\n00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.850\nmoney, because I am not\nactually drinking the coffee.\n\n191\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.450\nTherefore, I'm not a user.\n\n192\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.910\nThere is a but, and there is a however.\n\n193\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.900\nBecause you see,\nif Justin doesn't like his coffee,\n\n194\n00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.840\nif Justin's not happy with it,\nmaybe he gets burned with the temperature.\n\n195\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:41.030\nOr maybe he doesn't like the taste,\nthere's something wrong with the quality.\n\n196\n00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.620\nWhat's gonna happen next time I say\ncome on, Justin, let's go for a coffee?\n\n197\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.892\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say no, or\n\n198\n00:10:47.892 --> 00:10:52.131\nI'm gonna ask you, is it that place where\nI got my face burned or it tasted bad?\n\n199\n00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:54.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, okay.\n\n200\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:58.140\nAnd so you're gonna say no, or\nyou're gonna say, let's go somewhere else.\n\n201\n00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.030\nSo you are going to influence me.\n\n202\n00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.976\nSo users influence customers.\n\n203\n00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:10.680\nNow, a customer can also be a user.\n\n204\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.140\nSo it gets a little bit\ncomplicated there because then\n\n205\n00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.390\nif I was also drinking the coffee and\nI liked the coffee but\n\n206\n00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:23.030\nJustin didn't,\nthen I would still have to listen to him.\n\n207\n00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.370\nNow, I could choose to override him, but\n\n208\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.880\nI'm not gonna do that because\nI respect him too much.\n\n209\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.830\nBut ultimately, one customer and\n500 users are saying,\n\n210\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.670\nno, we don't like that coffee, then we're\nnot gonna go to that coffee shop again.\n\n211\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.910\nSo it's really important, then,\nthat the customer has a say.\n\n212\n00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.860\nBecause in that top left\nof that particular diagram,\n\n213\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.620\nwe had our corporate program management or\nthe customer.\n\n214\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.626\nThe customer is paying for this.\n\n215\n00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:57.560\nBut the customer's influenced by the user.\n\n216\n00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.500\nSo this is our interaction\nwith the business.\n\n217\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:07.680\nAfter all, we are here to give\nthe business what they need.\n\n218\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.361\nThat's why we're here.\n\n219\n00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:14.680\nStill on that left-hand corner\nthen of this particular diagram,\n\n220\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.410\nwe've then got the directing level,\nwhich is the project board level.\n\n221\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.434\nOn the project board level,\n\n222\n00:12:21.434 --> 00:12:25.661\nwell, they're the people that\nwill set out of all of this.\n\n223\n00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:30.070\nThey're the people that are going\nto be controlling the project.\n\n224\n00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.720\nThat's a project board.\n\n225\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.752\nSo let me think about if we take a look\nat each one of these particular levels,\n\n226\n00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:39.845\nI mean, I know that we've\nalready looked at some of them.\n\n227\n00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:44.220\nBut things like who's going to be doing\nwhat, what the project interests are, and\n\n228\n00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.490\nwe're going to come on\nto that in a moment.\n\n229\n00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.200\nWho the project manager is,\nwho the team managers are.\n\n230\n00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.470\nWell, the project board are gonna\nhelp to define some of those.\n\n231\n00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.640\nBut so is the project manager as well.\n\n232\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.980\nAll of these roles need to be filled,\nabsolutely every single one.\n\n233\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.490\nAll of these responsibilities,\nwell, they need to be actions.\n\n234\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.660\nWe can't ignore any one of these.\n\n235\n00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.170\nSo we have a project board.\n\n236\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.581\nSo who would consist of the project board,\nwho do you think?\n\n237\n00:13:15.581 --> 00:13:16.550\n&gt;&gt; The project board?\n\n238\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.700\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwho would the project board consist of?\n\n239\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.300\nLet me put that into proper English.\n\n240\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.810\n&gt;&gt; Probably,\nmaybe the organizing department,\n\n241\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.370\nthe one who has a vested in the project?\n\n242\n00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.090\nWho's the project being done for?\n\n243\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.411\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, but bearing in mind\nthat we've got that in the customer,\n\n244\n00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:32.580\nhaven't we, in that level above.\n\n245\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.159\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess that's.\n\n246\n00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:40.350\nThis delineation is kind of rough for\nme Jo, I'm not gonna lie.\n\n247\n00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.970\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no,\nbecause I'm being sneaky here.\n\n248\n00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.010\nBecause yeah, I don't expect some\nsort of user representative or\n\n249\n00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.910\ncustomer representative to\nbe on the project board.\n\n250\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.720\nBut who else is gonna be\non the project board?\n\n251\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.730\nLet's think about what\na project has to control.\n\n252\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.603\n&gt;&gt; What a project has to control?\n\n253\n00:13:56.603 --> 00:13:58.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:02.029\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing someone from accounting.\n\n255\n00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:08.082\nI guess someone from IT,\nor infrastructure.\n\n256\n00:14:08.082 --> 00:14:11.400\nI'm guessing someone\nfrom your security team.\n\n257\n00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.900\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n258\n00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.896\n&gt;&gt; And-\n&gt;&gt; Is he gonna fall into the trap?\n\n259\n00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:18.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Probably.\n\n260\n00:14:18.013 --> 00:14:20.555\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it's hidden by shrubbery.\n\n261\n00:14:20.555 --> 00:14:23.322\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:26.047\n&gt;&gt; Now those are the ones that I could\n\n263\n00:14:26.047 --> 00:14:29.070\nthink of that kinda, I don’t know.\n\n264\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.010\nJust tell me, Jo.\n\n265\n00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.312\nJust tell me who's on the board.\n\n266\n00:14:32.312 --> 00:14:33.400\n&gt;&gt; My heart just sank.\n\n267\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.600\nThis is one of the things that we\ntalked about on the previous episode.\n\n268\n00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.690\nAnd it does make my heart sink.\n\n269\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:44.426\nDon’t forget the people that are gonna\nsupport the new product after it’s\n\n270\n00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:45.488\nbeen deployed.\n\n271\n00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:50.465\n&gt;&gt; Well, that’s who I was talking about.\n\n272\n00:14:50.465 --> 00:14:52.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course.\n\n273\n00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, always.\n\n274\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.590\n&gt;&gt; In the meantime,\nmy soul has been crushed.\n\n275\n00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.721\nBut no, I've amended that now.\n\n276\n00:14:57.721 --> 00:14:59.296\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm here for Jo.\n\n277\n00:14:59.296 --> 00:15:00.013\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for that.\n\n278\n00:15:00.013 --> 00:15:03.418\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget our support team guys,\n\n279\n00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:05.330\nplease don't.\n\n280\n00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.940\nThat's one of the things that I\nmentioned in a previous episode,\n\n281\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.930\nis that we do have a,\nI'm not going to say a tendency,\n\n282\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:19.180\nbut there is a chance or\na risk that we work in silos.\n\n283\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.260\nIt is something that we do within IT.\n\n284\n00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:27.600\nAnd traditionally, project teams and\ndevelopment teams, that's him over there,\n\n285\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.150\nand the support teams,\nkind of keep themselves to themselves.\n\n286\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.260\nAnd that's not what we want.\n\n287\n00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.110\nWhat we need to have is one cohesive team\n\n288\n00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.810\nin order to be able to deliver\nproducts to the organization.\n\n289\n00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.720\nBecause to deliver successful\nproducts to the organization,\n\n290\n00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.110\nyou've gotta make sure\nthat they're supportable.\n\n291\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.750\nAnd you've gotta make sure that\nthe support team know how to support\n\n292\n00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.820\nthem as well.\n\n293\n00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.041\nSo you're gonna have a representative\non your project board.\n\n294\n00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:55.119\nYou're gonna have a representative\nfrom your support teams,\n\n295\n00:15:55.119 --> 00:15:58.779\na representative from accounting,\na representative from the customer or\n\n296\n00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:01.639\nthe user, a representative\nfrom the development teams.\n\n297\n00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:04.571\nBut bearing in mind that\nthis is a project board\n\n298\n00:16:04.571 --> 00:16:08.832\n&gt;&gt; And these are where decisions are made\n\n299\n00:16:08.832 --> 00:16:11.501\nto do with the project.\n\n300\n00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:14.224\nAnd then underneath,\nyou have your project manager level.\n\n301\n00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:18.213\nNow, your project manager is going\nto be assigning all of the roles and\n\n302\n00:16:18.213 --> 00:16:19.440\nresponsibilities.\n\n303\n00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.670\nI'm not necessarily going to expect\nthe project board to be able to do that,\n\n304\n00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.269\nbecause the project board.\n\n305\n00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:29.265\nDepending on the scale of the organization\nand the scale of the project, project\n\n306\n00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:33.286\nboards are not necessarily going to know\nindividuals and whose got what skills.\n\n307\n00:16:33.286 --> 00:16:37.241\nThat would be down to\nthe project manager to fulfill.\n\n308\n00:16:37.241 --> 00:16:40.513\nAnd then in each functional team, well,\n\n309\n00:16:40.513 --> 00:16:45.470\nwe've got different team managers for\neach functional team.\n\n310\n00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.390\nAnd again,\n\n311\n00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:52.377\nthat depends on the scale of the project\nas to how many team managers you have.\n\n312\n00:16:52.377 --> 00:16:57.233\nSometimes the team manager and the project\nmanager might be the same person, and\n\n313\n00:16:57.233 --> 00:17:00.850\nyou might find that there's\na conflict there as well.\n\n314\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.660\nBecause obviously, the team manager is\ngoing to manage his individual teams and\n\n315\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.290\nmanage the priorities of his teams.\n\n316\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:12.990\nBearing in mind that the individuals\non his team may be working for\n\n317\n00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.410\ndifferent projects not just for\none project.\n\n318\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.270\nAnd of course, if your team manager is\nthe same person as your project manager,\n\n319\n00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.980\nthen you're gonna have\na conflict of interests there.\n\n320\n00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.750\nBecause that particular project is always\ngonna take priority amongst that team.\n\n321\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:31.680\nUltimately, this organization theme is\nthere to establish the structure of\n\n322\n00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.960\naccountability and responsibilities and\nwe've got three interests here.\n\n323\n00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.210\nAnd those three interests\nare the business, the user and\n\n324\n00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:47.870\nthe supplier and\nthe project encompasses all of these.\n\n325\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.770\nWe've looked at the difference\nbetween user and customer.\n\n326\n00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.830\nAnd so the business itself is different,\nwe call them the customer.\n\n327\n00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.153\nThe user has different requirements and\n\n328\n00:17:59.153 --> 00:18:04.927\nthe supplier also has a different\ninfluence on the project, as well.\n\n329\n00:18:04.927 --> 00:18:07.125\nThe business are gonna\ntell us what they want.\n\n330\n00:18:07.125 --> 00:18:09.183\nThey're gonna tell us that they\nwant a full cup of coffee,\n\n331\n00:18:09.183 --> 00:18:10.786\nthat's what the business\nare gonna tell us.\n\n332\n00:18:10.786 --> 00:18:14.674\nAnd they're gonna tell us why\nthey want a full cup of coffee,\n\n333\n00:18:14.674 --> 00:18:19.336\nbut the user's gonna tell us what it\nshould taste like and the supplier?\n\n334\n00:18:19.336 --> 00:18:23.083\nThe supplier's going tell\nus what they can deliver.\n\n335\n00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:27.593\nThat supplier doesn't\nnecessarily have to be internal.\n\n336\n00:18:27.593 --> 00:18:29.180\nSo it doesn't have to be external.\n\n337\n00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.885\nIt can be an internal supplier, as well.\n\n338\n00:18:31.885 --> 00:18:37.211\nSo don't think of supplies as just being\nsomebody outside of your organization,\n\n339\n00:18:37.211 --> 00:18:39.457\nwhich we've got a tendency to do.\n\n340\n00:18:39.457 --> 00:18:44.579\nSo of course, the project sits\nat the apex of all three and\n\n341\n00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:48.328\nthat's where I expect my project to sit.\n\n342\n00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:51.401\nSo we've looked to act\nour management structure.\n\n343\n00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:56.161\nWe looked in that left-hand corner\nof that previous diagram where we've\n\n344\n00:18:56.161 --> 00:19:00.010\nlooked at what actually happens\nat each particular level.\n\n345\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.341\nAt that program level,\nthat program management level.\n\n346\n00:19:03.341 --> 00:19:05.894\nWe're setting the vision and the strategy.\n\n347\n00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:08.478\nThat's where the decisions are made.\n\n348\n00:19:08.478 --> 00:19:12.937\nAt the project board level, that's where\nthe direction for the project is set.\n\n349\n00:19:12.937 --> 00:19:18.623\nThe project manager is responsible for\nthe day-to-day management and the team\n\n350\n00:19:18.623 --> 00:19:24.400\nmanager is responsible for the daily\ndelivery of the actual product themselves.\n\n351\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.846\nLook at what it says in\nthe top right-hand corner.\n\n352\n00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:35.239\nLack of executive support is often cited\nas the top cause of project failure.\n\n353\n00:19:35.239 --> 00:19:40.544\n[LAUGH] That's quite an important one and\nI hear that quite often too.\n\n354\n00:19:40.544 --> 00:19:47.410\nWhen I'm doing consultancy work, I quite\noften come across senior leadership teams,\n\n355\n00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.608\nmanagement teams who have got\na completely different perspective\n\n356\n00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:58.474\non a project to what the individuals\nthat are delivering the project have.\n\n357\n00:19:58.474 --> 00:20:02.147\nThe individuals, the developers delivering\nthe project will tell me one thing and\n\n358\n00:20:02.147 --> 00:20:04.048\nthe leadership team will tell me another.\n\n359\n00:20:04.048 --> 00:20:07.728\nAnd generally, the leadership team tell\nme that everything is going great.\n\n360\n00:20:07.728 --> 00:20:08.956\nIt's all going swimmingly.\n\n361\n00:20:08.956 --> 00:20:13.096\nIt's all going fantastic and we're going\nto get everything delivered on time and\n\n362\n00:20:13.096 --> 00:20:17.236\nthen you go and speak with the individual\ndevelopers who'll tell you a completely\n\n363\n00:20:17.236 --> 00:20:20.066\ndifferent story,\nthat it's all gone horribly wrong.\n\n364\n00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:22.012\nNothings ever gonna be delivered on time.\n\n365\n00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:23.346\nThey don't get any support.\n\n366\n00:20:23.346 --> 00:20:24.925\nThey don't get any money.\n\n367\n00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:28.226\nTheir request for\nresources are never heard.\n\n368\n00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:31.308\nTheir requests for\nnew software is never heard.\n\n369\n00:20:31.308 --> 00:20:34.842\nTheir requests to take a day\noff are never heard, as well.\n\n370\n00:20:34.842 --> 00:20:38.780\nAnd I hear that quite frequently and\nJustin's nodding his head.\n\n371\n00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.937\nThis is something that you've come across,\nas well.\n\n372\n00:20:40.937 --> 00:20:45.989\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have observed this as\nwell where there's this almost like\n\n373\n00:20:45.989 --> 00:20:51.862\nI don't know like management is living\nin some kind of deluded fantasy land.\n\n374\n00:20:51.862 --> 00:20:54.742\nBut likewise, developers may have or\n\n375\n00:20:54.742 --> 00:20:59.513\nthe implementation team may\nactually have kind of a negative,\n\n376\n00:20:59.513 --> 00:21:04.643\nbecause of that horrible disjoint and\nwe talked about resources one\n\n377\n00:21:04.643 --> 00:21:10.043\nof the things that I've seen is\nwithout clear indication of why you're\n\n378\n00:21:10.043 --> 00:21:15.015\ndoing something or impetus could\nthose also be a lack of support.\n\n379\n00:21:15.015 --> 00:21:16.879\nLike hey, you said, do this.\n\n380\n00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:21.498\nBut I did this, but I don't really\nunderstand why like providing the why or\n\n381\n00:21:21.498 --> 00:21:22.316\nthe vision.\n\n382\n00:21:22.316 --> 00:21:25.444\nWould then also be lack of\nsupport in that capacity?\n\n383\n00:21:25.444 --> 00:21:29.540\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember in a previous episode\nwe talked about organizational change\n\n384\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.311\nmanagement?\n\n385\n00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:33.727\nAnd organizational change management and\nabout motivating people, and\n\n386\n00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:34.890\nhow important that was?\n\n387\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.100\nI quite often come across organizations\nwhere senior leadership teams,\n\n388\n00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.180\nthey'll come in at\nthe beginning of something and\n\n389\n00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.780\nthey'll deliver a strategy and they'll\nsay this is what we're going to do and\n\n390\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.100\nthen they disappear and\nyou never hear anything more from them.\n\n391\n00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.055\nThey're not there to answer that question,\nwhy?\n\n392\n00:21:52.055 --> 00:21:56.535\nAnd so by the time that's sort of filtered\ndown to individual developers and\n\n393\n00:21:56.535 --> 00:22:01.086\nthey're asking why something should\nbe done, there's no answer for them.\n\n394\n00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:05.223\nBut there's no support from\nthe senior leadership team.\n\n395\n00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:08.040\nSo when a developer will turn around and\nsay, but\n\n396\n00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.869\nthis is not physically possible, I can't\ndo this in the current infrastructure.\n\n397\n00:22:12.869 --> 00:22:14.447\nThere's nobody listening.\n\n398\n00:22:14.447 --> 00:22:17.065\nThere's nobody there to hear.\n\n399\n00:22:17.065 --> 00:22:21.453\nAnd sometimes, it's a case of\nthe senior leadership team or\n\n400\n00:22:21.453 --> 00:22:25.078\nnot understanding what\nthe developer is saying.\n\n401\n00:22:25.078 --> 00:22:29.946\nAnd that can be a failure in sort of\nproject manager and project board level\n\n402\n00:22:29.946 --> 00:22:34.118\nas well, because somebody has\nto act as a translator for this.\n\n403\n00:22:34.118 --> 00:22:36.676\nI don't expect the project board or\n\n404\n00:22:36.676 --> 00:22:41.718\nthe program team to necessarily\nunderstand how to develop a product.\n\n405\n00:22:41.718 --> 00:22:45.454\nAnd sometimes and\nwe do fall into this as techie people,\n\n406\n00:22:45.454 --> 00:22:50.382\nwe will go to senior leadership or\nwe will go to somebody in the customer and\n\n407\n00:22:50.382 --> 00:22:53.494\nwe'll kind of just\nconfuse them with jargon.\n\n408\n00:22:53.494 --> 00:22:56.035\nWe'll just start using lots of words and\n\n409\n00:22:56.035 --> 00:23:01.126\nwe'll start showing lots of screenshots\nthat make absolutely no sense to them.\n\n410\n00:23:01.126 --> 00:23:04.542\nWe're not particularly great\nat communicating in IT.\n\n411\n00:23:04.542 --> 00:23:05.651\nWe're really not.\n\n412\n00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:09.398\nWe like to communicate in our\nown language, in our own level.\n\n413\n00:23:09.398 --> 00:23:13.860\nAnd so if there is a disconnect between\nthe senior leadership and the developers\n\n414\n00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.202\nactually delivering the product,\nthen again, the developers might feel.\n\n415\n00:23:18.202 --> 00:23:21.270\nSo they are not being understood,\nbecause they're probably not.\n\n416\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.958\nBecause they're speaking\nin two different languages.\n\n417\n00:23:23.958 --> 00:23:25.204\nSo that's an issue.\n\n418\n00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:29.593\nThe other issue, something that you eluded\nto though or just touched on was the fact\n\n419\n00:23:29.593 --> 00:23:33.921\nthat you're being pulled in different\nsort of ways and in different directions,\n\n420\n00:23:33.921 --> 00:23:38.500\nbecause you're not getting the consistent\nleadership where you've got one person in\n\n421\n00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.218\nthe leadership team saying,\nI want you to do this.\n\n422\n00:23:41.218 --> 00:23:43.592\nAnd then somebody else saying,\nno, you need to do this.\n\n423\n00:23:43.592 --> 00:23:44.552\nAnd then you need to do that.\n\n424\n00:23:44.552 --> 00:23:46.786\nWell, I can only do one thing at a time.\n\n425\n00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:48.561\nI can't do three.\n\n426\n00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:53.147\nThis is what I was talking about when\nI mentioned in the previous slide.\n\n427\n00:23:53.147 --> 00:23:56.886\nI mentioned about the fact that\nthe project manager could,\n\n428\n00:23:56.886 --> 00:24:01.696\nif you've got a project manager and\na team manager that are the same people.\n\n429\n00:24:01.696 --> 00:24:05.744\nThe same person,\nthen that could cause conflict.\n\n430\n00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:09.361\nIt could cause a conflict of interest and\nit could cause issues because the one\n\n431\n00:24:09.361 --> 00:24:12.369\ndeveloper, if they're working\non three different projects,\n\n432\n00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:14.950\nthey could be getting pulled\nin three different ways.\n\n433\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.230\nSo we've got to be really\ncareful that senior management\n\n434\n00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.820\nare not just there just as a figurehead.\n\n435\n00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.490\nWe have to be able to support\nour development teams.\n\n436\n00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:32.210\nThe development teams are not\ngoing to deliver a quality product\n\n437\n00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.500\nif they don't have ongoing\nexecutive support.\n\n438\n00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.635\nIt's not just about the support\nright at the beginning,\n\n439\n00:24:38.635 --> 00:24:41.355\nit's not about that strategic direction.\n\n440\n00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:43.780\nIt's about the ongoing support.\n\n441\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.310\nSo this is what it could look like.\n\n442\n00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.000\nYou're thinking, Justin.\n\n443\n00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.010\n&gt;&gt; So I'm thinking about\nthis communication where my\n\n444\n00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.400\ndeveloper goes to senior management or\nsomebody who's building something,\n\n445\n00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.760\nwhatever it may be, and\nconfuses them with jargon.\n\n446\n00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.290\nBut likewise, it could be the other\nway around where management team,\n\n447\n00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:08.090\none of those individuals can go, well,\nI know what I'm talking about, and\n\n448\n00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.460\nrequest things that are just\npractically impossible.\n\n449\n00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:19.350\nDoes that set up the same kind of issues\nin that direction of communication?\n\n450\n00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:23.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely so, and in fact,\nin some of our other series,\n\n451\n00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.690\nI've looked at this and\nI've looked at communication within IT.\n\n452\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.060\nBecause quite generally [LAUGH],\nwe're really not good at it.\n\n453\n00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.730\nCommunication has got to\nbe in a specific language.\n\n454\n00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.110\nDo you know what language that is?\n\n455\n00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.825\n&gt;&gt; A pre-agreed upon language?\n\n456\n00:25:37.825 --> 00:25:39.709\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n457\n00:25:41.681 --> 00:25:42.510\n&gt;&gt; I-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n458\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.253\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n459\n00:25:43.253 --> 00:25:45.094\n&gt;&gt; I want to say English [LAUGH] but\n\n460\n00:25:45.094 --> 00:25:47.385\nit's not what you're looking for.\n\n461\n00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:52.155\n&gt;&gt; You don't communicate in English as far\nas I'm concerned, so don't even go there.\n\n462\n00:25:52.155 --> 00:25:57.095\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're not gonna get into\nan argument of whose English is better.\n\n463\n00:25:57.095 --> 00:25:57.965\nThere's a word for it.\n\n464\n00:25:57.965 --> 00:25:59.605\nIt's at the tip of my tongue.\n\n465\n00:25:59.605 --> 00:26:03.890\nI just can't remember It's not coming.\n\n466\n00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, that wasn't the right thing-\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n\n467\n00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.425\nI know it's not.\n\n468\n00:26:07.425 --> 00:26:09.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The word is audience.\n\n469\n00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.970\nYou've heard me say this before.\n\n470\n00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.170\nYou know I have,\nit's the language of the audience.\n\n471\n00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.760\nIf I'm talking to you,\nit is not your job to try and\n\n472\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.500\nfigure out what on Earth I'm saying.\n\n473\n00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.550\nIt's my job to make sure that I\ncommunicate in a way that I'm understood.\n\n474\n00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.960\nYeah, sometimes that just involves\nme shouting at you, I know right?\n\n475\n00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.560\nBecause that's just\nthe relationship that we have.\n\n476\n00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.030\nBut that's okay, I'm all right with that\ncuz Justin will just shout back at me.\n\n477\n00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:45.270\nBut ultimately, it's your responsibility\nto make sure that you're understood.\n\n478\n00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.230\nIt is not your audience's responsibility.\n\n479\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:53.190\nIf I try and work out what Justin is\nsaying to me sometimes I just stand there\n\n480\n00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.750\nand look at him blankly because I\ndon't understand what he's saying.\n\n481\n00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.410\nBut then he's used to that.\n\n482\n00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.300\nBut it's not my job to figure out\nwhat somebody else is saying.\n\n483\n00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.680\nIt is the job of the communicator.\n\n484\n00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.590\nIt's the job of the person that is\ndoing the communicating to make sure\n\n485\n00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.440\nthat they are communicating in\nthe language of the audience.\n\n486\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.270\nAnd therefore,\nthe responsibility lies on all of us.\n\n487\n00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:21.680\nWhether we're at senior leadership level\nor whether we are at developer level,\n\n488\n00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.460\nthe responsibility lies\non all of us to make sure\n\n489\n00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.520\nthat the person that you're\ntalking to understands.\n\n490\n00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.790\nWhether that is an email\nthat you're sending.\n\n491\n00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.740\nWhether that is a status\nupdate that you're sending.\n\n492\n00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:39.310\nWhether that is a conversation that you're\nhaving on the phone or face-to-face.\n\n493\n00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.350\nIt's your job to ensure that\nthat person understands you.\n\n494\n00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:47.410\nSo you should be asking simple\nquestions just to ensure understanding.\n\n495\n00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.690\nClarifying questions like,\ndid you get that?\n\n496\n00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.690\nDoes that make sense to you?\n\n497\n00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:53.950\nPut that in your own language.\n\n498\n00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.020\nWhat do you think I meant by that?\n\n499\n00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.780\nAnd I know that that sounds simple.\n\n500\n00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.747\nAnd I know that that sounds as though it's\nkind of what we have the same in England,\n\n501\n00:28:01.747 --> 00:28:04.780\nit's kind of teaching your\ngrandmother to suck eggs.\n\n502\n00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.590\nWhich I've never really understood\nthat saying because [LAUGH] it doesn't\n\n503\n00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.221\nmake any sense.\n\n504\n00:28:08.221 --> 00:28:13.681\n&gt;&gt; I would tell you that's an odd [LAUGH]\nI can't say that we had some odd sayings\n\n505\n00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:18.680\nbut you did say it just like teaching\nyour grandmother to suck eggs, right?\n\n506\n00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.926\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know, I know-\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that grandma got\n\n507\n00:28:21.926 --> 00:28:25.890\nthe word she used today, she already knows\n&gt;&gt; I don't think my grandmother ever\n\n508\n00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:26.780\nsucked an egg.\n\n509\n00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Anyway.\n\n510\n00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.660\n&gt;&gt; This does bring up\nan interesting point for me.\n\n511\n00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.090\nSo when I've done things like this,\nwhen I say, does that make sense,\n\n512\n00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.910\ncan you give that back to me?\n\n513\n00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.790\nActually, there's kind of\nthis implicit trust or\n\n514\n00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:44.430\nthere's this understanding that you're\ngoing to tell me if you don't understand.\n\n515\n00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.200\nWe're going to have open communication.\n\n516\n00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.160\nBecause I've spoken to people where I've\nsaid, do you understand, and they go.\n\n517\n00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.700\nAnd then a day later,\nthey finally come to me and\n\n518\n00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:01.030\ngo, well, I don't really understand,\nthat's not efficient.\n\n519\n00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.635\nDo we have to make sure that is\nthe case when we're doing this\n\n520\n00:29:04.635 --> 00:29:08.200\naudience-specific kind of interaction.\n\n521\n00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.430\n&gt;&gt; It's a difficult one.\n\n522\n00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.040\nIt really, really is cuz culture has\na big part to play in this one as well.\n\n523\n00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.540\nSo it's not necessarily just about\nthe language that we're using,\n\n524\n00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.255\nyou've got culture too.\n\n525\n00:29:18.255 --> 00:29:22.200\nAnd some cultures, it's considered\ndisrespectful to use the word no.\n\n526\n00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.400\nSo if I was asking somebody,\nhave you done this?\n\n527\n00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.130\nThe answer, if they consider\nthe word no to be disrespectful,\n\n528\n00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:34.400\nI need to know that the answer that I'm\ngonna get back is always gonna be yes.\n\n529\n00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.360\nSo if I say, have you done this?\n\n530\n00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.700\nThen I'm always gonna get the answer yes.\n\n531\n00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.190\nSo the question that I then ask,\nI have to modify what I'm asking, and\n\n532\n00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:49.130\nthe question that I then ask is, where\nhave you got to with this particular task?\n\n533\n00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:54.950\nSo we have to take responsibility\nourselves to modify our language.\n\n534\n00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:59.340\nWhich is why you'll quite often hear\nme say, did you understand that,\n\n535\n00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.830\nrepeat it back to me.\n\n536\n00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.820\nDid you understand that,\nwhat does that mean to you?\n\n537\n00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.080\nDid you understand that,\nwhat are you going to do now?\n\n538\n00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.075\nSo it's not just a case of\naccepting the word yes.\n\n539\n00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:13.835\nIf somebody just looks at me blankly and\nsays, yeah,\n\n540\n00:30:13.835 --> 00:30:19.025\nokay, that shows that maybe they're\nbeing slightly intimidated by me.\n\n541\n00:30:19.025 --> 00:30:20.428\nI can't think why.\n\n542\n00:30:20.428 --> 00:30:24.305\n[LAUGH] Or maybe they just simply\ndon't understand, in which case,\n\n543\n00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:29.420\nthen I need to take the time to find out\nwhat it is that they don't understand.\n\n544\n00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.720\nIt's my responsibility.\n\n545\n00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:36.920\nIf I don't clarify understanding,\nI'm going to ask you to do something.\n\n546\n00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.970\nYou are not gonna do it.\n\n547\n00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.740\nYou're gonna come back.\n\n548\n00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.850\nYou're gonna ask for\nfurther clarification.\n\n549\n00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.208\nAfter you sat there for\na day and thought about it.\n\n550\n00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:49.440\nIn the meantime, not only have we\nwasted a day, which we have, but\n\n551\n00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.150\nyou've also wasted my time too.\n\n552\n00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.560\nBecause when I spoke to you, you said yes.\n\n553\n00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.840\nAnd now you're coming back and\nyou're asking me again for\n\n554\n00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:04.920\nclarification, and now I'm having to take\nthe time again to explain it to you.\n\n555\n00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.930\nSo it's not efficient.\n\n556\n00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.950\nThis is not about sort of apportion and\nblame.\n\n557\n00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.780\nThis is simply about efficiency.\n\n558\n00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:17.010\nIt's not efficient for me to allow\nyou just to walk off having said yes.\n\n559\n00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:22.400\nI'm always going to make sure that\nyou understand what the direction is.\n\n560\n00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.840\nAnd while we're talking about this, and\nwe're talking about organization too.\n\n561\n00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.710\nAnd we are gonna come back and\n\n562\n00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:31.070\nwe're gonna carry on this conversation\nin another episode, by the way.\n\n563\n00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:36.330\nBut I want to leave you with this\nthought for this particular episode.\n\n564\n00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.020\nAnd that thought is, well,\nit's a question really to Justin.\n\n565\n00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.540\nHow many meetings have you been and\nthat absolutely make no sense whatsoever.\n\n566\n00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.680\nAnd didn't achieve anything at all?\n\n567\n00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.470\n&gt;&gt; All the ones that could\nhave become an email.\n\n568\n00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:51.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Send me a PDF or some check boxes.\n\n569\n00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.056\nAnd I tend to try to read my\ne-mail as much as possible.\n\n570\n00:31:55.056 --> 00:31:59.440\nBut I have been in a few meetings where\nI just went, I don't really know why\n\n571\n00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.898\nwe're here or was I supposed to There\nhave been times where I've thought,\n\n572\n00:32:03.898 --> 00:32:05.845\ndid I come to the wrong meeting?\n\n573\n00:32:05.845 --> 00:32:10.620\nWas that supposed to be for other people\nbecause it was just crazy stuff going on.\n\n574\n00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.510\nNow, Joe you said that we still have\na lot more to cover with, as far as\n\n575\n00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.890\nthe organization theme, which means we're\ngonna have to come back with part two.\n\n576\n00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:21.249\nAre there any final kind of parting\nwords for us before we get out of here.\n\n577\n00:32:21.249 --> 00:32:24.621\n&gt;&gt; Well I kind of, while we were just\ntalking about this, I just kind of wanted\n\n578\n00:32:24.621 --> 00:32:27.640\nto look at the last slide here\nthat we'd got about communication.\n\n579\n00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.840\nBecause we've been talking about this.\n\n580\n00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.191\nAnd one of the things that we say in\nPRINCE2 is that the project manager\n\n581\n00:32:34.191 --> 00:32:36.864\ndefines how we're going to communicate.\n\n582\n00:32:36.864 --> 00:32:40.547\nAnd those meetings that I\nwas talking about there,\n\n583\n00:32:40.547 --> 00:32:44.670\nI ask that question as kind\nof a final question, really.\n\n584\n00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:51.080\nBecause I know that every single one of\nyou, every person watching this right now,\n\n585\n00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.615\nincluding the two of us stood in this\nstudio, have been in meeting where\n\n586\n00:32:55.615 --> 00:32:59.480\nwe walked away and said, well that was\nmeeting that could have been an e-mail.\n\n587\n00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.353\nBecause we discussed a lot,\nnothing was actually achieved, and\n\n588\n00:33:04.353 --> 00:33:10.567\neverybody has walked away feeling as\nthough they don't know what they're doing.\n\n589\n00:33:10.567 --> 00:33:15.447\nOr the most common ones that I've\ncome across are the meetings where we\n\n590\n00:33:15.447 --> 00:33:18.600\nencourage what we call passive resistance.\n\n591\n00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.450\nI say we encourage passive resistance.\n\n592\n00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:26.300\nPassive resistance is\nthat type of person that\n\n593\n00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:31.020\nwalks away from a meeting, having said yes\nand agree to absolutely everything and\n\n594\n00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.700\nthen does nothing about it\nonce they leave the room.\n\n595\n00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.990\nThat's what we call passive resistance.\n\n596\n00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.560\nThey're not being actively resistant.\n\n597\n00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.770\nThey're not sort of getting\ntheir pitchforks out and\n\n598\n00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:43.560\ncampaigning against a particular proposal.\n\n599\n00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.310\nThey're just agreeing to a proposal.\n\n600\n00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:49.030\nThey're just placating the person\nspeaking and then walking away, and\n\n601\n00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.810\nnot getting actively behind it.\n\n602\n00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:54.210\nAnd it goes back into\nthe executive leadership.\n\n603\n00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.350\nBut it also goes back\nto the communication.\n\n604\n00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:03.050\nAnd the fact that if you have passive\nresistance within your organization and\n\n605\n00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:10.605\nwithin your project, then you have\nclearly got a communication issue.\n\n606\n00:34:10.605 --> 00:34:13.225\nSo that's where I'm gonna leave this.\n\n607\n00:34:13.225 --> 00:34:17.715\nYou know whether you've got communication\nissues within your project.\n\n608\n00:34:17.715 --> 00:34:22.475\nAnd when we come back we're gonna\ngo further into the layers of\n\n609\n00:34:22.475 --> 00:34:26.340\norganization for\nthe project itself, and we're going\n\n610\n00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.950\nto look at the various responsibilities\nthat there are at each layer.\n\n611\n00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:31.910\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo, there's a lot to unpack there.\n\n612\n00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:35.470\nI don't know, it's like it's bringing\nback good and bad memories for me,\n\n613\n00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:37.870\nso I'm kind of interested in\nseeing how this resolves itself,\n\n614\n00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.700\nand hopefully you're interested as well.\n\n615\n00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.620\nSo definitely come on back, but for now\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n616\n00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.560\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n617\n00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.310\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n618\n00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:47.677\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n619\n00:34:47.677 --> 00:34:54.136\n[MUSIC]\n\n620\n00:34:54.136 -->

Foundation.\n\n8\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.120\nAnd well, we're coming back with\na part two of our organization theme.\n\n9\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.110\nAnd yeah, if you haven't seen it,\ndefinitely go check out part one.\n\n10\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.546\nThis is part two, and here to help us\nalong and to further the conversion is Ms.\n\n11\n00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:32.130\nJo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.810\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.972\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you,\nJustin, how are you?\n\n14\n00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:41.120\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well, and\nI feel like we left off talking about\n\n15\n00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.830\ncommunication and how that plays into\nthings, but Where are we going from here?\n\n16\n00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, so in part one,\nwe took a look at, well,\n\n17\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.140\nwe took a look at the actual\nstructure itself.\n\n18\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.980\nSo we took a look at the executive level,\nand then the project board, and\n\n19\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.550\nproject manager, and\nthe team manager level.\n\n20\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.050\nAnd we just had a quick,\nbrief look at those.\n\n21\n00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.837\nSo we're going to go into those in a\nlittle bit more detail in this particular\n\n22\n00:01:03.837 --> 00:01:06.160\nepisode and\nwe also looked at communication.\n\n23\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.306\nAnd where I left off was asking\nthe question really simply is,\n\n24\n00:01:10.306 --> 00:01:14.308\nwhat communication or\nwhat language do we communicate in?\n\n25\n00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:17.315\nAnd how many times, oh,no,\nhe knows the answer to this,\n\n26\n00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:18.945\nalready got your hands out now.\n\n27\n00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.255\nGo on then, you're desperate to ask this.\n\n28\n00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:23.955\n&gt;&gt; Audience specific language\nis the language of the audience.\n\n29\n00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:26.165\n&gt;&gt; Right, it is,\nit's the language of the audience.\n\n30\n00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:27.935\nThat's what language we communicate in.\n\n31\n00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:33.600\nAnd I also asked you the question, how\nmany meetings have you actually been in?\n\n32\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.235\n[LAUGH] He's hanging his head here.\n\n33\n00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:41.224\nBut it could literally just been\na meeting that could have been an email.\n\n34\n00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:44.611\n&gt;&gt; Could have been an, or it was just\na meeting for the sake of a meeting.\n\n35\n00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:47.310\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; There was like this compulsion,\n\n36\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.840\nwe should meet.\n\n37\n00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.065\nI'm like, about what?\n\n38\n00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:52.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because, seems like a horrible reason,\n\n39\n00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.940\nit takes a lot of time out.\n\n40\n00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.920\nI can't tell you how many.\n\n41\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.398\nI'm getting bad flashbacks.\n\n42\n00:01:57.398 --> 00:02:00.353\nWe're just gonna leave it as a lot.\n\n43\n00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:04.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know, I see sometimes,\nclient, I was gonna say diaries, but\n\n44\n00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.240\napparently, I've been told diary is not\nthe right word to use, it's a schedule.\n\n45\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.160\nA diary is something that you write\npersonal things in, so I've been told.\n\n46\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.420\nIs that right?\n\n47\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.600\n&gt;&gt; Are we talking about\nlanguage differences?\n\n48\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.300\nBecause a diary is definitely something\nyou write your deepest darkest secrets in.\n\n49\n00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.790\nI've never heard that diary as a schedule.\n\n50\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.268\nI'm not saying it's wrong,\nI just never heard of it.\n\n51\n00:02:26.268 --> 00:02:30.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I would look at my\ndiary for what I'm gonna do today.\n\n52\n00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.020\n&gt;&gt; The more you know.\n\n53\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.004\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Just a little added bonus right there.\n\n54\n00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.847\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So there, because this is\nwhy it's important to communicate in\n\n55\n00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:39.110\nthe language of the audience.\n\n56\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.380\nBecause sometimes you can make mistakes,\n\n57\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.400\nespecially when I turn around to somebody\nsaying, let me check my diary and\n\n58\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.870\nI'll get back to you and then they looked\nat me going, why, what's written in there?\n\n59\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.430\nSo language of the audience,\nremember that one.\n\n60\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.410\nSo let's take a look at, this was\na slide that I flashed up on the screen\n\n61\n00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.130\nin episode one, we didn't really\nget a chance to talk about.\n\n62\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.600\nAnd you will see that what we have\n\n63\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.720\non this particular slide is\nyou've got our project board.\n\n64\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.910\nAnd I asked the question in episode one\nwho should be on our project board, and\n\n65\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.510\nI mentioned that we looked at sort of\nthe maybe the chief financial officer,\n\n66\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.170\nsomebody that's got their\nhands on the purse strings.\n\n67\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.210\nWe've got a user, or a customer.\n\n68\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.140\nBut you'll see also that on our\nproject board we, probably,\n\n69\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.540\ngot a supplier, or\nat least a senior supplier.\n\n70\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.190\nAnd underneath the project board, this is\nwhere those layers of project manager and\n\n71\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.660\nteam manager come in.\n\n72\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.580\nBut we also have, off to the right-hand\nside, the change authority.\n\n73\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.770\nNow, the change authority is somebody that\nwe've mentioned in a previous episode.\n\n74\n00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.050\nAnd in a previous episode I looked at\nthe person that would manage the change,\n\n75\n00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.540\nand the authority that they have.\n\n76\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.540\nAnd I said something to you,\nJustin's standing up.\n\n77\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.110\nNow he's thinking,\n[LAUGH] because he can't remember.\n\n78\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.795\n&gt;&gt; Nope, I sure can't.\n\n79\n00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:05.950\n[LAUGH] I don't even know what\nquestion you're gonna ask me, but I.\n\n80\n00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.540\nI can guarantee one thing.\n\n81\n00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.362\nI probably do not know the answer to that.\n\n82\n00:04:10.362 --> 00:04:12.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got a test.\n\n83\n00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.970\n[LAUGH] All I'm saying is you\nneed to remember this, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.460\nJustin's gonna have a test as well.\n\n85\n00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.920\nJustin gets tests live\nevery single episode.\n\n86\n00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.670\nSo the person that is\nthe change authority,\n\n87\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.790\nis the person with the right level\nof authority to approve the change.\n\n88\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.730\nIn other words,\nthe larger the impact of the change,\n\n89\n00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.580\nthe higher the authority would be.\n\n90\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.040\nSo the more senior the change\nauthority would be.\n\n91\n00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.370\nDo you remember that now?\n\n92\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.060\n&gt;&gt; I do remember that.\n\n93\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.220\nI wouldn't have been\nable to reproduce that.\n\n94\n00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.555\nBut I do remember talking like if\nit was organizational wide impact.\n\n95\n00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:50.650\nIt has to go pretty high up.\n\n96\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.290\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; Necessary to get the thumbs up.\n\n97\n00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.550\nWhere if it's more of a departmental\nimpact, maybe it goes to department\n\n98\n00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.570\nmanager, if it's just this team,\nmaybe it's the team manager.\n\n99\n00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.600\nSo it's like this discreet kind of stair\nstep based on an overreaching impact.\n\n100\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.103\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the hierarchy in change\nauthority is directly proportional to\n\n101\n00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:15.520\nthe scale, the size of the project,\nand the change that is being made.\n\n102\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.112\nSo if it's a small change probably it's\njust gonna be somebody logical that's\n\n103\n00:05:19.112 --> 00:05:19.980\ngoing to approve.\n\n104\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.450\nBut if it's a large change that's\ngonna impact the entire organization,\n\n105\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.980\nthen the proof who will be\nthe change of authority,\n\n106\n00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.080\nwill be probably somebody like your CIO,\nfor instance.\n\n107\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.780\nOkay, and that one's very important.\n\n108\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.698\nThat that one is not necessarily whilst\nthe role sits separate from the project\n\n109\n00:05:35.698 --> 00:05:36.520\nboard.\n\n110\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.990\nIt's important to note that the change\nauthority might actually be a person\n\n111\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.150\non the project board.\n\n112\n00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.200\nBut their responsibilities are different,\nso their responsibilities are separate.\n\n113\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.330\nThe responsibility of change authority\n\n114\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.860\nis not a responsibility that\nlies within the project board.\n\n115\n00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.740\nIt's an activity that is performed\nof behalf of change management and\n\n116\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.670\nnot performed on behalf\nof the project board.\n\n117\n00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.522\nEven though it might be the same\nperson that's doing this, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:05.522 --> 00:06:10.900\nJust remember, and when we talked in\nepisode one about hierarchies and\n\n119\n00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.710\nabout how intricate those\nhierarchies were, and\n\n120\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.950\nI asked Justin if he'd ever\nseen an organizational chart.\n\n121\n00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.000\nThe organizational charts can take many\nforms and it's not just about who reports\n\n122\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.170\nin to whom, but it's also about\nthe responsibilities they have.\n\n123\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.300\nAnd I may have multiple responsibilities\nthat report into different processes and\n\n124\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.910\ninto different roles.\n\n125\n00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.960\nThen that's a classic example,\nwhere the CIO may be on a project board,\n\n126\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.430\nbut they may also be the change\nauthority for a specific change as well.\n\n127\n00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.760\nOne thing that you have to be really\ncareful of is a conflict of interest.\n\n128\n00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.533\nBecause if your CIO is your\nchange authority, then and\n\n129\n00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:57.093\nif they sit on a project board for\na particular project then there is a risk.\n\n130\n00:06:57.093 --> 00:07:01.946\nAnd it's a risk that they are going\nto approve every single change that\n\n131\n00:07:01.946 --> 00:07:05.100\ncomes that way from that project board.\n\n132\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.940\nSo it may well be.\n\n133\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.820\nAnd then what you need to do and\nwhat you decide to do\n\n134\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.780\nis delegate change authority to\nsomebody else, somebody impartial.\n\n135\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.350\nSo you have to bear in mind the conflict\nof interest that may occur there.\n\n136\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.150\nI'm not saying they will but\nthey may occur so bear that in mind.\n\n137\n00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.430\nThe change authority so\nshould somebody that's impartial,\n\n138\n00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.630\nsomebody that's gonna oversize for\nall of the changes and\n\n139\n00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.330\nis not directly responsible for\none specific change.\n\n140\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.770\nSo I mentioned earlier on, and let me\njust go back to this particular slide and\n\n141\n00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.880\nin that left-hand corner of that\nslide we have these four layers.\n\n142\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.510\nWe have a corporate layer,\na project board, a project manager and\n\n143\n00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.620\nour team manager and now.\n\n144\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.416\nWe're going to look specifically at this\nproject board which are our executive,\n\n145\n00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:58.616\nour senior users, and our senior supplier.\n\n146\n00:07:58.616 --> 00:08:03.691\nSo in our project board,\nthe executive Is ultimately\n\n147\n00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:07.880\naccountable for this particular project.\n\n148\n00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.110\nSo the executive is somebody who\ntakes ownership of this project.\n\n149\n00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.840\nIt doesn't always have to be the CIO.\n\n150\n00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.070\nIt's somebody senior because\nthey're ultimately accountable.\n\n151\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.960\nAnd they make all the decisions.\n\n152\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.140\nSo the executive is somebody that you go\nto to say, hey, I've got $ 1 million and\n\n153\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.620\nI'd like this increased functionality,\nand they're the person that says, yeah.\n\n154\n00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.740\nBut look at that third bullet point,\nbecause that third bullet point mentions\n\n155\n00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.660\nthat the executive is responsible for\nprotecting the business interests.\n\n156\n00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.030\nAnd also for the business case as well.\n\n157\n00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.330\nThey take ownership of the business\ncase and the business interests.\n\n158\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.480\nThey are looking at this from\nthe business perspective.\n\n159\n00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.190\nRemember this particular slide.\n\n160\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.030\nWe have the business,\nthe user, and the supplier.\n\n161\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.380\nAnd guess what, we've got our executive\nthat's looking after the business.\n\n162\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.440\nWe've got our senior user that's\nlooking after the user interests.\n\n163\n00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.810\nAnd then we've got our senior supplier\nthat's looking after our supplier\n\n164\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.790\ninterests too.\n\n165\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.410\nSo the executive is looking\nafter the business interest, and\n\n166\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.460\nthey make all the decisions for\nthe business.\n\n167\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.430\nAnd there's only one executive.\n\n168\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.960\nThere can be only one.\n\n169\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.040\nI swear that was a movie.\n\n170\n00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's out of Highlander.\n\n171\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.573\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's why I was sitting over\n\n172\n00:09:31.573 --> 00:09:32.260\nhere smirking.\n\n173\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.352\nI was like, there can be only one I guess.\n\n174\n00:09:35.352 --> 00:09:36.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.591\n&gt;&gt; Now we're gonna\n\n176\n00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:39.140\nget Queen singing, right?\n\n177\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, aw, that was a good soundtrack.\n\n178\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.850\nSo real quick here,\nprotecting business interests,\n\n179\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:50.552\nthat is to make sure that a project\ndoes not cause like undue\n\n180\n00:09:50.552 --> 00:09:55.580\nimpact or a deviation from\nthe original purpose of the business.\n\n181\n00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.940\nOr what forms can that take?\n\n182\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.900\n&gt;&gt; Be careful about what you just said.\n\n183\n00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.000\nCuz you mentioned the deviation\nfrom the original purpose.\n\n184\n00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000\nBut of course you know that projects\nchange, and quite often change midstream.\n\n185\n00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.860\nAnd that's why we manage in stages, so\n\n186\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.090\nthere could be a deviation\nfrom the original purpose.\n\n187\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:17.350\nAnd the executive is there to actually\njustify why that deviation is necessary.\n\n188\n00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.543\nThey're not there to prevent it.\n\n189\n00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:22.100\nThey would be hindering\nthe project in that instance.\n\n190\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.720\n&gt;&gt; Let me clarify,\nnot necessarily the project.\n\n191\n00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.890\nI'm talking about,\nlike have a project that is changing, and\n\n192\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.260\nthis was not the original purpose.\n\n193\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.000\nBut I have a million dollars,\nI wanted you to build this feature, but\n\n194\n00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.667\nit's not like our core business values.\n\n195\n00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:37.556\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's like this ancillary thing.\n\n196\n00:10:37.556 --> 00:10:41.820\nThey're to make sure that we're not\nspending exorbitant amounts of money on\n\n197\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.250\na project to develop features that kinda\ndon't really add any business value.\n\n198\n00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.360\nSo that's what I was talking about,\nnot neccessarily the project,\n\n199\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.410\n&gt;&gt; So let me give you classic example.\n\n200\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:58.889\nSomething that happened to a client\nof mine quite a few years ago now,\n\n201\n00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:02.925\nwhere the CEO had\na dinner party one night.\n\n202\n00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:04.830\n[LAUGH] It was a long, long time ago.\n\n203\n00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.406\nAnd they'd a dinner party,\nand I think their guests,\n\n204\n00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:11.840\nor their neighbor's kid,\nhad come in with an iPad.\n\n205\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.160\nAnd this CEO looked at this iPad and\nsaid, hey, that's great.\n\n206\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.100\nI'm gonna give it all my sales guys,\n\n207\n00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.880\ncuz they need something mobile\nthat they can take out with them.\n\n208\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.790\nThe business, the executive for\n\n209\n00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:32.410\nthat particular project who\nwas the business owner,\n\n210\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.870\nthat was his job to protect\nthe business interest.\n\n211\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.940\nThe executive for that particular project\nturned around and said you know what,\n\n212\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.600\nyou're not having it.\n\n213\n00:11:43.344 --> 00:11:48.540\nAnd the reason that they did that was\nbecause it's not in the business interest.\n\n214\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.448\nEven though it might seem like a great\nidea, right now our IT development team\n\n215\n00:11:53.448 --> 00:11:58.750\nare looking at, they're evaluating tablets\nwith a different operating system.\n\n216\n00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.018\nBecause the iPad,\n\n217\n00:12:00.018 --> 00:12:05.260\nthe Apple product doesn't actually fit\nin without current infrastructure.\n\n218\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.315\nAnd so to actually bring that in would\nmean that we'd have to bring in an Apple\n\n219\n00:12:08.315 --> 00:12:08.900\ndevelopers.\n\n220\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.940\nWe would have to bring in\npeople that could develop apps.\n\n221\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.890\nWe'd have to modify our existing\ninfrastructure in order to be\n\n222\n00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.178\nable to accommodate that.\n\n223\n00:12:16.178 --> 00:12:21.199\nAnd also, all of the apps that\nwe're currently using right now,\n\n224\n00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:25.215\nsuch as our sales-based app,\ndo not have an Apple or\n\n225\n00:12:25.215 --> 00:12:29.140\na Mac version of that particular product.\n\n226\n00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.140\nThis was quite a few years ago now.\n\n227\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.690\nSo that executive makes that decision.\n\n228\n00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.470\nThey would be the one that would say, no,\n\n229\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.170\nyou're doing this just\nbecause you want to.\n\n230\n00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.535\nThere was absolutely no sound business\njustification for this whatsoever.\n\n231\n00:12:42.535 --> 00:12:44.056\nAnd in that instance,\n\n232\n00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:48.790\nthen the executive would actually\ngo back to the CEO and say, no, no.\n\n233\n00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.210\nYou're not having this,\nbut here's an alternative.\n\n234\n00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.812\nNow I don't expect my executive\nto be particularly technical, so\n\n235\n00:12:54.812 --> 00:12:59.040\nI don't necessarily expect them to\nbe able to offer the alternatives.\n\n236\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.873\nBut if you've got that good communication\npath that we talked about in our previous\n\n237\n00:13:02.873 --> 00:13:06.486\nepisode, then the executive's gonna come\ndown and is sit with a developer and\n\n238\n00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:07.051\nsay, hey.\n\n239\n00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:10.230\nLook, this is what they've asked for,\ncan we do this?\n\n240\n00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.750\nIs this possible?\n\n241\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:16.510\nAnd that's when the developers\nshould be saying, no, no.\n\n242\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.410\nWell, it's possible, but\nthis is how much it's gonna cost us, and\n\n243\n00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.936\nit doesn't make any sense to do that.\n\n244\n00:13:20.936 --> 00:13:26.740\nAnd again, that has to be centered\naround the element of trust too.\n\n245\n00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.243\nIf you've got good communication paths,\n\n246\n00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:33.910\nthen you've got an element of trust\nbetween the executive and the developers.\n\n247\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.665\nThe developers know that the executive's\ngonna look after their interests.\n\n248\n00:13:38.665 --> 00:13:42.238\nAnd the executive knows that when they go\nto the developers that they're gonna give\n\n249\n00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.760\nthem the truth.\n\n250\n00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.430\nAnd they're not just gonna say something\njust because they don't want to do it.\n\n251\n00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.416\nSo that's what they're there for,\nis to protect the business and\n\n252\n00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:53.580\nmake sure that there's not gonna be\nnegative impact to the business.\n\n253\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:58.120\nBut it's not just for financial reasons,\nas you mentioned there.\n\n254\n00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.830\nIt's for other reasons too, in that\nit may not fit in with the strategy.\n\n255\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.540\nAnd then we've got what we\ncall our project board.\n\n256\n00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.600\nAnd our project board, well,\nthey're accountable for\n\n257\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.900\nthe success of the actual project itself.\n\n258\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:17.685\nSo while the executive sits on\nthe project board, then the board itself,\n\n259\n00:14:17.685 --> 00:14:24.590\nwell, they make sure that the project\nis going in the right direction.\n\n260\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:28.820\nSo they support the executive\nin their decision making, and\n\n261\n00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.520\nthey also support the project manager too.\n\n262\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.530\nSo they have characteristics\nsuch as the authority they,\n\n263\n00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.660\napparently, they add credibility.\n\n264\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.800\nAnd I say apparently because if\nyou've got the wrong project board,\n\n265\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.990\nthen they're not going to add credibility,\nunfortunately.\n\n266\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:51.940\nWhat they're going to do, though,\nis delegate to the relevant managers and\n\n267\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:57.020\nto all of the other members of\nthe project team, wherever necessary.\n\n268\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.330\nThe executive, by the way,\nit says they can be only one.\n\n269\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.830\nThe executive role cannot be\ndelegated to somebody else.\n\n270\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:06.426\nThe responsibilities of that\nexecutive role should not be\n\n271\n00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:08.780\ndelegated to somebody else.\n\n272\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.585\nThe executive is the person\nwith that accountability.\n\n273\n00:15:13.585 --> 00:15:16.650\n&gt;&gt; But change of authority could\nbe delegated to someone else\n\n274\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.570\nif there is a conflict of interest.\n\n275\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.760\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n&gt;&gt; Like so-\n\n276\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.170\n&gt;&gt; And there's none-\n\n277\n00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.700\n&gt;&gt; If a person that is on here is\n\n278\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.290\na project manager for this one project and\nthey're part of the project, right?\n\n279\n00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.247\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And they would normally,\n\n280\n00:15:28.247 --> 00:15:32.600\nthe change authority for\nthis other thing that I'm guessing,\n\n281\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.300\nwas the board the one that makes the\ndecision to say, hey, you can't do this?\n\n282\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.200\nThis is a conflict of interest.\n\n283\n00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.130\nWould they be the one that does that, or-\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n284\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; No, and that's the interesting point.\n\n285\n00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.808\nSo you said that the change authority\ncould be delegated to somebody else.\n\n286\n00:15:48.808 --> 00:15:53.732\nYes, it could, but it would be the change\nmanager's responsibility to say,\n\n287\n00:15:53.732 --> 00:15:55.680\nno, you're on this project!\n\n288\n00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.643\nYou've got some bias here!\n\n289\n00:15:57.643 --> 00:15:59.130\nYou're not impartial!\n\n290\n00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.452\nAnd so it's actually change management,\nthere's a process.\n\n291\n00:16:01.452 --> 00:16:05.210\nIt's the change manager that says,\nno You're not doing this.\n\n292\n00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.196\nSomebody else is going to do this.\n\n293\n00:16:07.196 --> 00:16:12.908\nNow, I expect that that person, whoever\nthe change authority would have been,\n\n294\n00:16:12.908 --> 00:16:16.016\nI expect them to have some input, perhaps,\n\n295\n00:16:16.016 --> 00:16:20.010\nas to who should be taking\nover their role for them.\n\n296\n00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.540\nBut I do not expect them\nto make the decision.\n\n297\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.090\nYeah, you've got to think about sort\nof that conflict of interest thing.\n\n298\n00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.720\nYou've got to think about the fact\nthat no, that doesn't sound right.\n\n299\n00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000\nSo I'm going to, I'm gonna\ndelegate my responsibility to you,\n\n300\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.670\nand by the way,\nI want you to make this decision.\n\n301\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.150\nYeah, okay then.\n\n302\n00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.709\nYeah, that sounds great, doesn't it?\n\n303\n00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:45.465\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a proxy vote to me.\n\n304\n00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:46.691\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo,\n\n305\n00:16:46.691 --> 00:16:48.180\nyou're gonna do this on my behalf.\n\n306\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What I tell you to do.\n\n307\n00:16:49.495 --> 00:16:51.982\n&gt;&gt; I have $12 for you,\nall right, that kind of thing.\n\n308\n00:16:51.982 --> 00:16:55.769\n&gt;&gt; 12?\nYou think I'm cheap.\n\n309\n00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:58.312\n&gt;&gt; We haven't got paid yet.\n\n310\n00:16:58.312 --> 00:17:03.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So then also, on our project\nboard, then we've got our senior user.\n\n311\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.120\nAnd as I've already mentioned,\nthey're representing the user element.\n\n312\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.110\nNow remember what I said in our previous\nepisode, the user is interested.\n\n313\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.400\nRemember, if you haven't heard this one\nbefore, go back to our previous episode.\n\n314\n00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.140\nThe user's interested in\nwhat the coffee tastes like.\n\n315\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.940\nThey're interested in the what\nthe temperature of the coffee is.\n\n316\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.700\nThey're interested in\nthe usability of the service.\n\n317\n00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.680\nSo they define the requirements and\nthe outcomes.\n\n318\n00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.463\nAnd also, the benefits,\nhow it's going to benefit me.\n\n319\n00:17:31.463 --> 00:17:36.240\nThe senior user, possibly,\ncould be more than one person,\n\n320\n00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.735\nwe'd prefer to have one person\non the project board, but\n\n321\n00:17:40.735 --> 00:17:44.380\nit could be two people that change.\n\n322\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.840\nAs long as they are both looking after the\ninterests of the user community, and as\n\n323\n00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.340\nlong as they're both thinking exactly the\nsame thing, the one thing that we cannot\n\n324\n00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.890\nhave in the project board is one person\none week that's gonna make one decision.\n\n325\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.080\nAnd another person the next week\nthat's gonna make another decision\n\n326\n00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.220\nthat completely contradicts the first one.\n\n327\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.860\nIf that's the case, and we've got\na disagreement, then we need to have\n\n328\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.420\nboth senior users in together, so\nthat we can reach an agreement.\n\n329\n00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.160\nYou do not need to have\na decision made one week\n\n330\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.700\nthat's then rescinded the next week.\n\n331\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.210\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n332\n00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.530\nAnd let's face it, it wouldn't work\nfrom a project management perspective.\n\n333\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.793\nWell, it would delay the project if\nthat's what you're trying to achieve and\n\n334\n00:18:27.793 --> 00:18:29.186\ncause chaos potentially, too.\n\n335\n00:18:29.186 --> 00:18:33.777\nAnd then you've got a senior\nsupplier who is going to represent\n\n336\n00:18:33.777 --> 00:18:38.900\nthe needs of your suppliers and\nyour senior supplier is accountable.\n\n337\n00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.450\nNow this is an important point as well,\n\n338\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.270\nespecially for those you that\nare looking to do your test,\n\n339\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:49.450\nyour senior supplier is accountable for\nthe quality of the product.\n\n340\n00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.380\nRemember what I said in\na previous episode, too.\n\n341\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.250\nYour suppliers are not\nnecessarily external.\n\n342\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.870\nThey could be external or internal.\n\n343\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.100\nThere could be many senior supplier roles.\n\n344\n00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.280\nYou could have one for internal and\nyou could have one for external as well.\n\n345\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:14.640\nBut you are going to have somebody or\na couple of people on your project board\n\n346\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.490\nthat are going to take that\naccountability for what the suppliers\n\n347\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.730\nare going to deliver by way of\nthe project now or by way of the product.\n\n348\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.890\nAnd of course, if you have an internally\n\n349\n00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.260\ndeveloped product then you'll see\nyour supply is going to be internal.\n\n350\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.530\nYou were thinking there, Justin.\n\n351\n00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.240\nI could see the cogs turning.\n\n352\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.118\n&gt;&gt; So this is one of those things where\nsometimes this gets me a little twisted,\n\n353\n00:19:40.118 --> 00:19:43.040\nbecause when I think of supplier,\nI think of hard goods.\n\n354\n00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.210\nI wanna buy 700 tons of corn or\nsomething like that.\n\n355\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.550\nBut really, a supplier, so\n\n356\n00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.308\nif our project is to develop\nan internal admin app, right?\n\n357\n00:19:53.308 --> 00:19:55.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or some kind of admin dashboard,\n\n358\n00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:59.180\nthen our supplier is actually\nour internal development team.\n\n359\n00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:05.200\nAnd they'll be responsible for\nthe quality of that admin dashboard,\n\n360\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.790\nbut the people deciding what it should\nhave on it are the actual user groups,\n\n361\n00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.940\nwhich is the senior users.\n\n362\n00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.570\nSo those two would be interfacing,\nquality, what actually should be there.\n\n363\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.220\nAnd then I guess there is\nan executive part that\n\n364\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.570\nwe need this because this is\ngoing to blah, blah, blah, right?\n\n365\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyour suppliers don't have to be external.\n\n366\n00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.560\nWe think of the term supplier and\n\n367\n00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.070\nwe always think of external people,\nbut it's not.\n\n368\n00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.260\nIf your product is being\ndeveloped in house,\n\n369\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.460\nthen somebody has to represent\nthe development team.\n\n370\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.640\nAnd that's exactly what\nthis role is doing.\n\n371\n00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.350\nIt is representing the development team.\n\n372\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.397\nIt's the same as providing\nsupplier resources,\n\n373\n00:20:44.397 --> 00:20:46.830\nthat's development resources\nwhere I come from.\n\n374\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.950\nBut that's also resources to\ndo with transition as well.\n\n375\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.130\nSo not just development of the product but\nalso transition of the product.\n\n376\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.930\nIn other words,\ndeploying it into the live environment.\n\n377\n00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:03.090\nSo you may have your user groups here\nas well, or not your user groups but\n\n378\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:08.182\nyour support groups represented\nhere as part of that supplier, too.\n\n379\n00:21:08.182 --> 00:21:12.150\nAnd then we've also got\nthe project manager.\n\n380\n00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:17.670\nAnd the project manager, well,\nthey report in to the project board.\n\n381\n00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.450\nAnd of course,\nthe project manager is responsible and\n\n382\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.660\naccountable for\nthe day-to-day management of the project.\n\n383\n00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.630\nInteresting point there,\nI don't know whether you noticed this.\n\n384\n00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.010\nIt says normally from the customer.\n\n385\n00:21:38.648 --> 00:21:40.280\nI see you looking.\n\n386\n00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.270\nI see you thinking.\n\n387\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:47.010\n&gt;&gt; So the project manager is\ngoing to be from the person who\n\n388\n00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.840\nfoots the bill for\nthis respective thing, right?\n\n389\n00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.616\n&gt;&gt; The project manager is gonna be\nsomebody that's going to ensure [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:21:54.616 --> 00:21:57.370\nthat we are not delivering\nwhat we want to deliver.\n\n391\n00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:05.092\nBut we're delivering\nwhat the customer wants.\n\n392\n00:22:05.092 --> 00:22:05.780\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n393\n00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:06.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry,\n\n394\n00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:10.290\nsee I confused those two [LAUGH] and\nthat doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n395\n00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:16.070\nSo if I'm on the Dev Team\nthat is part of those groups,\n\n396\n00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.020\nI'm not building it the way\nI think it should be built.\n\n397\n00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.520\nI'm actually should be building\nit based on what the customer.\n\n398\n00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n399\n00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.060\nAnd that's the key is\nthe project manager should be\n\n400\n00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.530\nbuilding this the way that\nthe customer wants it to be built.\n\n401\n00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.570\nNot necessarily building it in that way.\n\n402\n00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:41.460\nBut certainly they should be delivering\nwhat the customer wants to see and\n\n403\n00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.280\nwhat the customer is willing to pay for.\n\n404\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.640\nAnd so the project manager,\nthe reason why we say it should\n\n405\n00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.280\nbe somebody from the customer is because\nwell, you want somebody empowerful.\n\n406\n00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:59.140\nYou don't want somebody that's gonna be\ninfluenced by the development team because\n\n407\n00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:04.010\nthe development team will probably want\nto put all the bells and whistles on and\n\n408\n00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.320\nthe customer will say well,\nI don't need that right now.\n\n409\n00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.290\nSo what the project manager is\nresponsible for is all of this.\n\n410\n00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.100\nIt's the line management of the team,\nit's the strategy, it's cost management,\n\n411\n00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.552\nit's all of the things we've talked\nabout like communication and quality.\n\n412\n00:23:18.552 --> 00:23:24.270\nThey're also responsible for managing\nthe status of the project as well.\n\n413\n00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.380\nAnd look at this one,\nthe bottom right-hand corner,\n\n414\n00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.070\nit says product versus project needs.\n\n415\n00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:37.190\nThat's where we're saying this is what\nthe product, or this is what the customer\n\n416\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:41.360\nwants in that particular product and\nthis is what the project wants to do.\n\n417\n00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.900\nThis is what the Dev Team want to do.\n\n418\n00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.470\nNow sometimes,\nwe have to do things in a certain way.\n\n419\n00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.380\nLet's get, I mean,\nlet's put that out there.\n\n420\n00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.670\nSometimes, the Dev Team will say to\nyou quite easily, well, you know what?\n\n421\n00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.660\nI can't do it any other way.\n\n422\n00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.632\nYou're gonna have to have it like this.\n\n423\n00:23:56.632 --> 00:24:00.410\nAnd that's where the project\nmanager comes in.\n\n424\n00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.995\nAnd the project manager said, okay,\nthen well, I've got to balance that need\n\n425\n00:24:03.995 --> 00:24:06.545\ncuz the customer wants this\n&gt;&gt; And I understand what\n\n426\n00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:11.046\nthe customer wants and you're saying\nthat you can only deliver this, and\n\n427\n00:24:11.046 --> 00:24:13.960\nI understand that this\nis what you can deliver.\n\n428\n00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.067\nSo therefore, I'm going to have\nto sit down with both of you and\n\n429\n00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:21.180\nworkout a solution that\nsatisfies everybody.\n\n430\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.550\nSo this is what my project\nmanager should be doing.\n\n431\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:30.900\nYou'll see that my project manager\ndoesn't need to be a technical person\n\n432\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.790\nwhich is why we say\nnormally from the customer,\n\n433\n00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.330\nbecause the project manager\ndoesn't need to be technical.\n\n434\n00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.700\nThe project manager needs to\nbe somebody that can manage.\n\n435\n00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.614\nSo it needs to be somebody that's\ngood at organization, for instance,\n\n436\n00:24:45.614 --> 00:24:48.970\nand we've got other roles here as well.\n\n437\n00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.000\nAnd overall, such as Project Assurance.\n\n438\n00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.860\nProject Assurance is a role that is\nconducted sometimes at sort of sublevels,\n\n439\n00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.523\nsuch as assurance from the users and\n\n440\n00:25:00.523 --> 00:25:05.590\nassurance from the business and\nassurance from the suppliers.\n\n441\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:09.846\nBut assurance is about just\nchecking that the fulfillment of\n\n442\n00:25:09.846 --> 00:25:14.360\nthe project is going to deliver\nwhat it's supposed to deliver.\n\n443\n00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.981\nThat the project is going\nalong the right track and\n\n444\n00:25:16.981 --> 00:25:20.200\nit's going to deliver\nwhat it needs to deliver.\n\n445\n00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.850\nThere is a difference between\nProject Assurance and quality assurance.\n\n446\n00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.640\nQA's a role that you've\nheard of within IT.\n\n447\n00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.550\nYeah, what does QA do?\n\n448\n00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.570\n&gt;&gt; So usually when I think of QA,\nI'm thinking of software.\n\n449\n00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.446\nSo they're making sure all the test past,\nthat the features are actually working as\n\n450\n00:25:40.446 --> 00:25:43.420\njust so, either through manual or\nautomative testing.\n\n451\n00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.453\nThey were making sure that it actually\ndoes what it's supposed to be doing and\n\n452\n00:25:47.453 --> 00:25:49.390\nthat it's up to snuff, so to speak.\n\n453\n00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not too sure about\nthe last bit you just said.\n\n454\n00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.876\nBut I like the bit about making sure\nthat it's doing what it's supposed to be\n\n455\n00:25:55.876 --> 00:25:58.910\ndoing and that's exactly\nwhat Project Assurance does.\n\n456\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.429\nProject Assurance makes sure that\nthe project does what it's supposed to be\n\n457\n00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:07.312\ndoing and you'll see that actually,\nthis is split three ways and\n\n458\n00:26:07.312 --> 00:26:09.450\nthis is split into user assurance.\n\n459\n00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.610\nMaking sure that the users\nget what they want out of it.\n\n460\n00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.551\nBusiness Assurance,\n\n461\n00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:16.330\nmaking sure that the business\nare getting what they want out of it.\n\n462\n00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:21.236\nIn other words, it's coming in on time and\nit's coming in according to budget,\n\n463\n00:26:21.236 --> 00:26:25.496\nand then Supplier Assurance is about\nmaking sure that the development\n\n464\n00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:30.332\nteam are getting what they need out of the\nproject in order to be able to develop,\n\n465\n00:26:30.332 --> 00:26:33.110\nand deliver the product\nwithin the project.\n\n466\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.200\nAnd then of course,\nwe've got this change authority and\n\n467\n00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.379\nwe've already spoken about\nthe change authority and\n\n468\n00:26:41.379 --> 00:26:46.400\nthe change authority is the person that is\nresponsible for authorizing the change.\n\n469\n00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.540\nNow it does tell you there that,\n\n470\n00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:53.070\nthat person's not always required and\ndo you know why it says that?\n\n471\n00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.950\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the project doesn't\nactually have any implications.\n\n472\n00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.065\nNow wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n473\n00:26:58.065 --> 00:26:59.710\n&gt;&gt; There's no conflict of?\n\n474\n00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:00.729\nThere's nothing?\n\n475\n00:27:00.729 --> 00:27:06.160\nAs soon as I start to say something-\n&gt;&gt; So for all of you, yeah.\n\n476\n00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.732\nSo for all of you that have\nlistened not every single project\n\n477\n00:27:11.732 --> 00:27:16.870\nrequires change authority,\nit depends on the scale.\n\n478\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:21.850\nSmaller changes don't\nrequire a change authority.\n\n479\n00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.742\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's what I started\nsay in the beginning and\n\n480\n00:27:24.742 --> 00:27:29.190\nyou kinda looked at me like I was like\nokay, well, I guess it's not that one.\n\n481\n00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.265\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if we're talking real kinda\n\n482\n00:27:31.265 --> 00:27:35.470\nentertain things, then maybe you\ndon't need change authority.\n\n483\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.225\nThere's not actually any impact.\n\n484\n00:27:36.225 --> 00:27:38.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n485\n00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.995\nYeah, if it's just a small project,\n\n486\n00:27:39.995 --> 00:27:42.180\nthen we don't necessarily\nneed change authority.\n\n487\n00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.350\nApproval might have been given in advance.\n\n488\n00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:50.200\nAnd then for this particular episode,\nthere is one more role that I want to\n\n489\n00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.660\nlook at and I know that I've already\nspoken about it very briefly in the last\n\n490\n00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.130\nepisode and\nI kind just mentioned it in this episode.\n\n491\n00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.835\nThe team manager,\nthough is the role that is responsible for\n\n492\n00:28:03.835 --> 00:28:08.180\nthe individual development\nteams within the project.\n\n493\n00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.150\nThey're not just development teams.\n\n494\n00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.395\nDon't forget you're bringing\nin support people, as well.\n\n495\n00:28:12.395 --> 00:28:16.814\nYou've got other teams not just\ndevelopers that are responsible for\n\n496\n00:28:16.814 --> 00:28:20.548\nproducing products,\nsuch as our infrastructure team and\n\n497\n00:28:20.548 --> 00:28:23.305\nmaybe our sys admin teams or\neven our DBAs.\n\n498\n00:28:25.145 --> 00:28:28.855\nSo they are going to allocate work\nvia what we call work packages.\n\n499\n00:28:28.855 --> 00:28:32.170\nIn other words, we give developers.\n\n500\n00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.170\nWell, we'll give them a package.\n\n501\n00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.034\nWe'll give them something to\ndo a specific package and\n\n502\n00:28:37.034 --> 00:28:39.730\nwe're gonna talk in other episodes.\n\n503\n00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:44.277\nTake a look at where we start to\nexplore the theory of stages and\n\n504\n00:28:44.277 --> 00:28:49.262\nhow we manage a project by stages\nwhich of course we know is something\n\n505\n00:28:49.262 --> 00:28:53.420\nthat we do here in prints too,\nbut the team manager.\n\n506\n00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.497\nWell, that's the person\nthat is responsible for\n\n507\n00:28:56.497 --> 00:28:59.140\nan individual group of project analysts.\n\n508\n00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.440\nPeople that are actually working\non delivering the products and\n\n509\n00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.430\nthey can be either internal or\n\n510\n00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.900\nexternal as we've already said\nour suppliers could be internal.\n\n511\n00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.770\nAnd therefore, so\ncould our team managers as well.\n\n512\n00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.310\nSo right now, I'm gonna leave it at that.\n\n513\n00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.122\nBecause for this particular episode,\nwe have looked at\n\n514\n00:29:22.122 --> 00:29:27.000\nthe responsibilities of certain\npeople within our peer to do project.\n\n515\n00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.735\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\n\n516\n00:29:29.735 --> 00:29:33.340\nwe're going to carry on with\nthe organization theme.\n\n517\n00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.150\nBut we are going to be taking a look\nspecifically at other stakeholders.\n\n518\n00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.855\nWe're gonna be looking at roles like\nproject support, so people who perform\n\n519\n00:29:40.855 --> 00:29:44.450\nsupport and other stakeholders and\nwe've mentioned some of them.\n\n520\n00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.905\nBut of course, a stakeholder is?\n\n521\n00:29:45.905 --> 00:29:48.600\n&gt;&gt; Someone who holds the stakes.\n\n522\n00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.210\nNow, they have a vested\ninterest in the project.\n\n523\n00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.613\n&gt;&gt; Somebody who's got an interest in the\nproject whether it's a financial interest\n\n524\n00:29:56.613 --> 00:29:59.240\nor any type of interest,\nthat is a stakeholder.\n\n525\n00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.360\nSo we're gonna be looking at\nstakeholders in our next episode.\n\n526\n00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.240\nSo I'm gonna invite you back for\nthe next episode.\n\n527\n00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.090\n&gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, Jo.\n\n528\n00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:11.240\nIf there's anything I've learned working\nwith you just when I think I know what I'm\n\n529\n00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.227\ntalking about, it comes back around and\n\n530\n00:30:13.227 --> 00:30:16.050\nI'm kinda interested to see\nwhat all the stakeholders.\n\n531\n00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.830\nWe're gonna take a look at it.\n\n532\n00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.905\nAnd well, you should join us back\nas we continue our look into\n\n533\n00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:20.810\nthe organization theme.\n\n534\n00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.050\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n535\n00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.810\nSo signing off for ITPro.TV.\n\n536\n00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.090\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n537\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.240\n&gt;&gt; I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n538\n00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:34.750\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC]\n\n539\n00:30:34.750 -->

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:05.505\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:06.800\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.323\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.323 --> 00:00:12.981\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:15.985\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:19.895\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison,\nand we're continuing our Prince2\n\n9\n00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:22.500\n2017 Foundation Course and\nwe're still on themes.\n\n10\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.597\nIn particular, in this episode, we're\ngonna be talking about the quality theme.\n\n11\n00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:29.437\nAnd well, how can we talk about quality\nwithout having someone very special to,\n\n12\n00:00:29.437 --> 00:00:30.497\nwell, teach us all about it.\n\n13\n00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:31.827\nThe one and only, Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n14\n00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:34.517\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling incredibly flattered,\n\n15\n00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:35.377\nthank you, Justin.\n\n16\n00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:36.787\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well.\n\n17\n00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:43.106\nThey say flattery is the, I don't know,\nthey say something about it.\n\n18\n00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:44.275\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] yeah,\n\n19\n00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:45.417\nI'm not sure about that.\n\n20\n00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:48.680\nI think we'll just leave that one there,\nyeah.\n\n21\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.810\nOkay, but thank you anyway, Justin.\n\n22\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.741\nHow are you enjoying our theme so far?\n&gt;&gt; I keep finding out that just\n\n23\n00:00:55.741 --> 00:01:00.204\nwhen I think I've learned something, that\nmakes sense, you throw me a curve ball and\n\n24\n00:01:00.204 --> 00:01:03.214\nI go there's so much more to learn.\n\n25\n00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:05.253\nAnd I guess that's just\nthe nature of the beast,\n\n26\n00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:08.020\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember, we're in foundation,\n\n27\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.230\nand in any foundation class,\nwhat you are learning, and\n\n28\n00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.990\nthe same with the series here,\nwhat you are learning is the foundation.\n\n29\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.619\nIn other words,\nyou're learning all of the terms,\n\n30\n00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.710\nyou're learning all of the definitions.\n\n31\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.290\nSo I know that in all of the episodes so\nfar, what you do have to remember,\n\n32\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.360\nespecially for your test, are the\nterminology, and it is the definition.\n\n33\n00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.250\nUnfortunately, this is what\nI need you to make note of.\n\n34\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.112\nNow, just like pretty much every other\ngovernance class that we have and\n\n35\n00:01:39.112 --> 00:01:43.190\nevery other governance episode that\nwe've done with all of our other series,\n\n36\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.870\nthere is downloadable\nmaterial available for you.\n\n37\n00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.230\nAnd anything that you see on\nthe screens in front you,\n\n38\n00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.990\nall of these slides are available for\nyou to download.\n\n39\n00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.840\nYou'll need to do that for your test.\n\n40\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.220\nYou'll need to do that to study.\n\n41\n00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.740\nYou will also,\nif you're a practitioner test,\n\n42\n00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.040\nyou will also need a copy\nof the Prince2 book.\n\n43\n00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.020\nThat's the official Prince2 book,\nin order to be\n\n44\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.450\nable to sit your practitioner test\nbecause you can use that as reference.\n\n45\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.100\nHowever, for this particular foundation,\nwell, your foundation test is closed book.\n\n46\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.294\nJustin, now here's a quick pop quiz,\n\n47\n00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:22.095\nbecause I just like doing this to Justin,\nright?\n\n48\n00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:23.839\nDo you remember how many questions\nthere were in the foundations test?\n\n49\n00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.260\n&gt;&gt; There were 60 and you have an hour.\n\n50\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.325\nIt's one minute a question, and\nyou have to get, I think you\n\n51\n00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:33.144\nhave to get, you got to get 33 right.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n52\n00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:33.920\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Is that right?\n\n53\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.879\nSee, well remembered.\n\n55\n00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.110\nBut he has been paying attention.\n\n56\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.410\nI'm definitely impressed.\n\n57\n00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.530\nBut yeah, you've got 60 questions.\n\n58\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.820\nYou've got one hour to do them,\nthat's one question per minute.\n\n59\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.450\nSo that's not a long period of time.\n\n60\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.160\nThat's one of the reasons why it's not\nclosed book because let's face it, I mean,\n\n61\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.220\nopen book, sorry.\n\n62\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.000\nBecause, let's face it, you don't have\ntime to be leafing through a book.\n\n63\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.410\nIf you've only got a minute per question,\n\n64\n00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.950\nyou definitely don't\nhave time to be looking.\n\n65\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.630\nSo let's get back to our themes then,\nshall we?\n\n66\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.700\nNow we've just had a quick recap.\n\n67\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.330\nAnd we're on this third theme of quality.\n\n68\n00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.410\nAnd in our last episode I actually\n\n69\n00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.370\nasked Justin if he knew what quality\nassurance was within a project.\n\n70\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.270\nDo you remember what your answer was?\n&gt;&gt; I said,\n\n71\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.020\nI typically think about software\nwhen I think of quality assurance.\n\n72\n00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.150\nAnd you're doing tests to make sure\nthings, features, the bells and whistles,\n\n73\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.220\nso to speak, that are purported to do\ncertain things actually do those things to\n\n74\n00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.363\nmake sure you're getting what is expected.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n75\n00:03:40.363 --> 00:03:45.082\nin Prince2 we define quality.\n\n76\n00:03:45.082 --> 00:03:48.600\nWell, the purpose of this\nquality theme is about,\n\n77\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.570\nyou'll see it on the screen\nin front of you right now.\n\n78\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.530\nIt's to define and implement the means by\n\n79\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.800\nwhich the project will verify that\neverything is fit for purpose.\n\n80\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.770\nIn other words,\nthat everything is as it should be.\n\n81\n00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.420\nWhat does quality really mean?\n\n82\n00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.160\nOne of the biggest challenge\nis quality is a seed.\n\n83\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.100\nIt's defined by the customer and\nit is completely subjective.\n\n84\n00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.460\nNow in a previous episode,\nI used a particular example\n\n85\n00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.210\nto help us to identify the difference\nbetween a customer and a user.\n\n86\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.550\nAnd what I said was, and so\nthis is a quick recap for you,\n\n87\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.660\nbecause this is gonna be important.\n\n88\n00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.470\nIn that a customer is somebody who pays\nand an user is somebody that uses.\n\n89\n00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.550\nAnd I offered, and\nI haven't done it, by the way, but\n\n90\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.970\nI did offer to take Justin out for\na cup of coffee.\n\n91\n00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.250\nHe's only getting one.\n\n92\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.639\nBut it was an offer.\n\n93\n00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.858\nAnd if I take Justin out for\na cup of coffee,\n\n94\n00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:51.890\nthen I am the customer,\nbecause I am buying him a cup of coffee.\n\n95\n00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.280\nNow, if I had a cup of coffee myself,\nbut I'm more likely to drink tea,\n\n96\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.720\nbecause I like to conform to a stereotype.\n\n97\n00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.719\nBut if I had a cup of coffee myself,\n\n98\n00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:05.793\nthen I would also be a user,\nas well as a customer, right?\n\n99\n00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:10.760\nSo a customer pays, the user uses.\n\n100\n00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.719\nDo you remember the difference\nbetween what I valued and\n\n101\n00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:20.588\nwhat you valued?\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] I gotta get things right when\n\n102\n00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:21.569\nI can.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:22.847\n&gt;&gt; So as a customer,\n\n104\n00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:26.420\nyou essentially want bang for your buck.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n105\n00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Is the coffee full?\n\n106\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.290\nHow much is it?\n\n107\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.440\nAm I getting the most for my money?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n108\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.740\n&gt;&gt; As a user, I'm looking for\n\n109\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.210\ntaste, temperature,\n\n110\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.990\nwhat I would say as quality attributes.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n\n111\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.610\n&gt;&gt; Does it taste good to me?\n\n112\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n113\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.860\nyou used the right word there\nbecause you used the word quality.\n\n114\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.710\nHm, I've also said up on that slide\nthere that quality is subjective.\n\n115\n00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.612\nSo if you are using then the word\nquality to describe the taste,\n\n116\n00:05:57.612 --> 00:06:02.033\nyou're using it to describe the,\nwhat else was it?\n\n117\n00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:03.782\nWas it taste, was it temperature?\n&gt;&gt; Mouth feel,\n\n118\n00:06:03.782 --> 00:06:05.814\nI guess is something I heard.\n&gt;&gt; Mouth feel?\n\n119\n00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:07.335\n&gt;&gt; So what I mean is-\n\n120\n00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:10.475\n&gt;&gt; You really have to explain that one.\n\n121\n00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:11.680\n&gt;&gt; How would I explain that?\n\n122\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.260\nSo I've had cups of coffee that\nleave like this weird after,\n\n123\n00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.960\nalmost like a film, if that makes sense.\n\n124\n00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.770\nSo you're like, ew, that's nasty.\n\n125\n00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.030\nI don't like that.\n\n126\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.560\nSo I want the absence of it,\n\n127\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.242\nI want something that's a little cleaner.\n&gt;&gt; Like that kind of coffee that leaves\n\n128\n00:06:26.242 --> 00:06:28.209\na coating on your teeth, is that what\nyou're saying, you don't want that?\n\n129\n00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:29.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's bad.\n\n130\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.216\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's subjective.\n\n131\n00:06:32.216 --> 00:06:33.320\nHow do I measure that?\n\n132\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.547\nSo measuring is difficult, but I think-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n133\n00:06:37.547 --> 00:06:40.760\nI'm not talking about measuring\nthe volume of coffee in the cup.\n\n134\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.100\nHow do I measure what you\nperceive to be quality?\n\n135\n00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.022\n&gt;&gt; I guess you're gonna have to\n\n136\n00:06:47.022 --> 00:06:48.735\nhave me test it.\n\n137\n00:06:48.735 --> 00:06:51.599\nBut is this one of those\nthings where you're wondering,\n\n138\n00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.860\ndo I tell you what I want?\n\n139\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.000\nFor instance, if we go along with this,\nwhat I think tastes good,\n\n140\n00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.910\nI typically like dark roast coffees.\n\n141\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.010\nI like French roast and things like that.\n\n142\n00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.515\nIf you like light coffees,\nwhich I do not, it's still coffee.\n\n143\n00:07:04.515 --> 00:07:08.545\nBut what I perceive, what is good to me,\nis different than you, right?\n\n144\n00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:10.638\nIs that where we are going with this, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n145\n00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:14.395\nkind of because you see,\nI like dark roast coffee, too.\n\n146\n00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:16.685\nAnd we are not getting off\nsubject here by the way.\n\n147\n00:07:16.685 --> 00:07:17.885\nThis is really important.\n\n148\n00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:20.645\nThis is something important for\nyou to understand.\n\n149\n00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.095\nI like dark roast coffee, too.\n\n150\n00:07:22.095 --> 00:07:25.716\nI prefer an Italian to a French,\nbut that's okay.\n\n151\n00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:30.400\nBut you see the thing is that I have\na preference and you have a preference.\n\n152\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.790\nBut that preference doesn't necessarily\nconstitute quality, because I've had\n\n153\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:42.870\na really good Italian dark roast and I've\nalso had really bad Italian dark roast.\n\n154\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.360\nSo how do I denote quality then?\n\n155\n00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.920\nSo let me say, let me just put this into\na little bit of a different perspective.\n\n156\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.890\nAnd let's pretend that I am,\nno, no, forget this.\n\n157\n00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.503\nI'm the customer, you're the user.\n\n158\n00:07:54.503 --> 00:07:59.289\nSo we've got a director with us today,\nthe one who is, well,\n\n159\n00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:03.999\nmaking us Sort of work to certain\nstandards, should we say.\n\n160\n00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:06.250\nThe one who's keeping us in check.\n\n161\n00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.280\nSo let's pretend that Megan,\nour director then.\n\n162\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.840\nMegan is the coffee shop.\n\n163\n00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.890\nShe owns the coffee shop.\n\n164\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:19.830\nHow does she ensure that we come back?\n&gt;&gt; So, are we\n\n165\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.970\ntalking from both of our perspectives?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n166\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.800\nyes because she is not\ngonna be successful.\n\n167\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.920\nI say what we call a service provider,\nshe is not going to be successful if she\n\n168\n00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.440\ndoesn't get, well,\nif she doesn't get our trade,\n\n169\n00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.880\nthat's both of our trades.\n&gt;&gt; So, as a customer, she want.\n\n170\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.700\nYou are making sure that\nthe cup is full and\n\n171\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.840\nit's a fair price.\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n172\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.750\n&gt;&gt; Then you are likely\n\n173\n00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.410\nto come back.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n174\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm over simplifying that a great deal.\n\n175\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.880\nBut for me as a user, she has to conform.\n\n176\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.270\nDoesn't she have to conform to my\n\n177\n00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.870\npreference?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n178\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.050\n&gt;&gt; So she has to say,\n\n179\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.980\ndo you want a dark roast coffee but\n\n180\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.340\nhere is a really good one.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna pay for this for\n\n181\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.530\nyou if you don't like it, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.150\nAnd that makes sense, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.290\nSo I'm not gonna pay for it for\nyou if you don't like it.\n\n184\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:10.310\nSo, you have certain preferences\nthat Megan then has to\n\n185\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.480\nwell, she's the one that has\nto supply those preferences.\n\n186\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.890\nBut I have some preferences, too.\n\n187\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.921\nBoth of those together\nwould denote quality.\n\n188\n00:09:18.921 --> 00:09:22.257\nHow's she going to find out\nwhat we consider to be quality?\n\n189\n00:09:22.257 --> 00:09:24.106\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing she would take a survey.\n\n190\n00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:26.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n191\n00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.220\nSo we talk about qualities\nbeing subjective.\n\n192\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.420\nAnd it's completely subjective.\n\n193\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.740\nAnd in the case of a coffee shop,\nit's completely subjective.\n\n194\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.650\nSo let's try and flip this into an I.T.\nperspective then, should we?\n\n195\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.575\nSo, you have a very,\nvery similar laptop to me,\n\n196\n00:09:43.575 --> 00:09:48.315\nthat's probably because we both\ngot a fairly similar perspective.\n\n197\n00:09:48.315 --> 00:09:51.625\nThis is quite sort of\neerie in one respect.\n\n198\n00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:54.435\nBut most users don't have\nthe same perspective.\n\n199\n00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:58.485\nI can tell you now, that my keyboard\nsetup completely different to yours.\n\n200\n00:09:58.485 --> 00:10:01.152\n&gt;&gt; I will suspect that's a yes because,\n\n201\n00:10:01.152 --> 00:10:07.230\nas a matter of fact, I have played with\noperating systems that have a UK default.\n\n202\n00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.070\nAnd I'm like, my keys aren't working, so\n\n203\n00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.000\nI have to remap them.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.830\nSo I have preferences and\nyou have different preferences as well.\n\n205\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.500\nAnd as it happens, those preferences\nare based on, at the moment,\n\n206\n00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.680\nthose preferences\nare based on our culture.\n\n207\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.640\nYou see,\nit's not that I can't use a US keyboard.\n\n208\n00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.060\nBut some of the keys are in a different\nplace and it makes it difficult for me.\n\n209\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.330\nSo I'm always going to set my keyboard and\nmy language and\n\n210\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.589\nmy spelling intent to English.\n\n211\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.210\nAnd so, that's the way I'm gonna work.\n\n212\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.770\nBut you're not.\n\n213\n00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.250\nLook at the look he's giving me right now.\n\n214\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.780\nYou're gonna,\n\n215\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.930\nyou have a different preference.\n&gt;&gt; I have a different preference on key\n\n216\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.541\nlayout but you know.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n217\n00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:54.697\nlet's not go there with the spelling.\n&gt;&gt; I was just gona say, I'm a pretty good\n\n218\n00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:59.190\nspeller, I also speak english.\n&gt;&gt; He thinks, he thinks.\n\n219\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.905\nIs that what that is?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n220\n00:11:02.905 --> 00:11:05.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm speechless at that point in time,\n\n221\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.720\nyou see, this all,\nthis is an interesting sort of to\n\n222\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.430\nthe person that's actually\ntrying to deliver a project.\n\n223\n00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.320\nBecause we're talking about\nquality assurance and\n\n224\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.210\nwe're talking about managing quality.\n\n225\n00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.820\nAnd we're talking about the fact\nthat different customers and\n\n226\n00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.790\ndifferent users have different\nperspective and different requirements.\n\n227\n00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.990\nSo the question is, do we give absolutely\neverybody everything that they want?\n\n228\n00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.940\n&gt;&gt; No, I would say no,\n\n229\n00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:40.980\nyou give them a subset of acceptable\ncriteria that fulfill a need,\n\n230\n00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.034\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if we were deploying\n\n231\n00:11:44.034 --> 00:11:48.970\nsomething here at ITPRO.TV,\nwe were deploying a new service here.\n\n232\n00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.386\nMy requirement would be,\nI want it in english.\n\n233\n00:11:52.386 --> 00:11:57.170\n[LAUGH] Your requirements\nwould be something.\n\n234\n00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.120\n&gt;&gt; I also want it in English.\n\n235\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.193\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Your flavor.\n\n236\n00:12:01.193 --> 00:12:02.807\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, it's delicious.\n\n237\n00:12:02.807 --> 00:12:04.385\n&gt;&gt; All right, that would be you.\n\n238\n00:12:04.385 --> 00:12:07.140\n[LAUGH] You'd want it in English too.\n\n239\n00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:13.340\nSo, am I gonna get my requirements?\n&gt;&gt; That's a tough one.\n\n240\n00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.270\nI would say, no.\n&gt;&gt; Why because you're\n\n241\n00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.580\njust being mean?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n242\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.880\nI'm not being mean.\n\n243\n00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.220\nI think there's some,\n\n244\n00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.090\nas far as language choices,\nI think there's some outside pressures.\n\n245\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:29.710\nRight?\nI mean, we have our preferences.\n\n246\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.210\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n247\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.790\n&gt;&gt; But if what we are providing or\n\n248\n00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:38.480\nwhat we're using actually interfaces\nwith other individuals and\n\n249\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.050\ntheir preferences, my preference,\nwouldn't that mean that\n\n250\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.540\nwe would use that preference over yours?\n&gt;&gt; Right, just think about all of these.\n\n251\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.970\nIt's funny, all of these influences\nthat actually probably you didn't have\n\n252\n00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.170\nthought about.cuz we keep\ntalking about preference.\n\n253\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.100\nBut then we talk about\nquality as being perceived.\n\n254\n00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.580\nAnd therefore,\nsurely I need my preference.\n\n255\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.520\nWell, you've got something\nelse that's going to\n\n256\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.840\nhave another influence on quality as well.\n\n257\n00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.240\nCuz I've talked about sort\nof language just then and\n\n258\n00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.070\ncuz it's an easy example to use.\n\n259\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.170\nBut here, on ITPRO.TV,\n\n260\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:16.300\nwhere we are physically located,\nas you all know, is in Florida.\n\n261\n00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.480\nSo, for the most part,\n\n262\n00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.450\neverything here would be in your version\nof English, right, for the most part.\n\n263\n00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.750\nExcept, there are other criteria as well,\nthat will influence quality.\n\n264\n00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.870\nDo you know what that\nother criteria might be?\n\n265\n00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.158\nBecause we're abiding by it right now.\n&gt;&gt; Veracity?\n\n266\n00:13:36.158 --> 00:13:37.583\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n267\n00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:41.298\n&gt;&gt; Cultural sensetivity?\n\n268\n00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:42.751\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n269\n00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:45.510\nNo, when have you ever\nknow me to be sensetive?\n\n270\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.595\nAbsolutly not, no.\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n271\n00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:53.510\nare we still talking about lanuage?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n272\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:55.520\n&gt;&gt; So I know\n\n273\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.760\n&gt;&gt; We're in the middle of this right now.\n\n274\n00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.959\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so\n\n275\n00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:02.934\na little like the verbage and\nthe spellings and things for Prince2,\n\n276\n00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:05.450\nin particular, are of --\n&gt;&gt; Go on.\n\n277\n00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.043\n&gt;&gt; The UK spelling\n\n278\n00:14:06.043 --> 00:14:07.081\n&gt;&gt; You're getting there.\n\n279\n00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:10.640\n&gt;&gt; Because of legal ramifications?\n\n280\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's not legal ramifications\n\n281\n00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.892\n&gt;&gt; I guess it's like trademark, copyright\n\n282\n00:14:13.892 --> 00:14:16.740\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's regulations.\n\n283\n00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.420\nIt's because of copyright, etc.\n\n284\n00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:23.060\nSo, the spelling that I'm going to use,\nwhenever we're talking about Prince2 and\n\n285\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:28.410\nwe do this for all of the publications and\nfor other publications as well,\n\n286\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:35.230\nwe're going to use the cultural setup\nof whatever the publication is in.\n\n287\n00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.920\nBecause that would be the regulations.\n\n288\n00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.510\nIn order to attain and achieve,\nand maintain our accreditation,\n\n289\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.880\nwe have to ensure that whatever we use\nthat's copyrighted is exactly as it's\n\n290\n00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:51.030\ncopyrighted and it is not paraphrased and\nis not sort of twisted around in any way.\n\n291\n00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.330\nThat's also a factor for quality.\n\n292\n00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.780\nAll of these that we've talked about,\nperceptions,\n\n293\n00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:04.010\nwe've talked about influences,\nwe've talked about regulations,\n\n294\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:10.880\nwe've talked about preferences as well,\nall of these have an influence on quality.\n\n295\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:17.440\nThe one thing that we have only really\ntouched on, just a smidge, is cost.\n\n296\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.610\nThat also has an impact on quality.\n\n297\n00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.900\nYou automatically assume that\nif you buy the most expensive,\n\n298\n00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.600\nyou're going to get\nthe highest quality but\n\n299\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.580\ngiven that quality is perceived,\nhow does that really work out?\n\n300\n00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.080\nWe go to the supermarket every single day.\n\n301\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.750\nOr I do for some strange reason.\n\n302\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.820\nMaybe I just like it there.\n\n303\n00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.631\nI don't know.\n\n304\n00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:38.692\n[LAUGH] But we go to the supermarket\nevery single day and\n\n305\n00:15:38.692 --> 00:15:42.024\nwe assume, that if we buy\na branded product off the shelf,\n\n306\n00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:46.533\nthen it's going to be the higher quality\nthan that supermarket's own brand.\n\n307\n00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:52.182\nAnd yet that's just an assumption but\nit's a subjective assumption,\n\n308\n00:15:52.182 --> 00:15:58.960\nwe assume that if we buy a commercial off\nthe shelf Wolcott's product, then it's not\n\n309\n00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.915\ngoing to be as configurable as something\nthat would be developed in house.\n\n310\n00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:09.443\nBut then something that's\ndeveloped in-house may not be as,\n\n311\n00:16:09.443 --> 00:16:12.100\nwhats the word I'm looking for now?\n\n312\n00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.590\nIt wouldn't be as compatible with any\nother products that we may have actually\n\n313\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.630\nbought commercially, off the shelf.\n&gt;&gt; Niche?\n\n314\n00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.650\nIt's a very specific,\n\n315\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:27.810\nit interfaces in this particular place and\nthen that's what it does, that's it.\n\n316\n00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.357\nIt is not versatile.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n317\n00:16:30.357 --> 00:16:35.022\nand I've seen a lot of products that have\nbeen developed as result of projects.\n\n318\n00:16:35.022 --> 00:16:38.236\nThat have been developed for particular,\n\n319\n00:16:38.236 --> 00:16:44.470\nspecific organizations in a very sort\nof niche market or a very specific.\n\n320\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.928\nWith a very specific function in mind, but\n\n321\n00:16:46.928 --> 00:16:49.946\nthen when it comes to then\nsay the operating system.\n\n322\n00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:52.516\nWindows being updated,\nwindows got an update,\n\n323\n00:16:52.516 --> 00:16:55.350\nall the sudden that\nproduct doesn't worked.\n\n324\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.620\nBecause it's being well, we call it\npostponed, but it's being telemade, it's\n\n325\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:05.220\nsay telemade products that is just created\njust for that particular environment.\n\n326\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:12.180\nSo, when it comes to project management,\nwhen it comes to Prince, we have to.\n\n327\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:17.450\nThe last bullet point on that slide talked\nabout meeting customer expectations.\n\n328\n00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:22.310\nThis discussion that we just had,\nthis is a discussion that you will need to\n\n329\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.620\nconsider when it comes to,\ndefinitely to your practitioner.\n\n330\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.300\nBecause this is a discussion on\nquality and what influences quality.\n\n331\n00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.718\nBecause once we've ascertained\nwhat quality should look like for\n\n332\n00:17:36.718 --> 00:17:39.422\nour product and\nby the way that was a very,\n\n333\n00:17:39.422 --> 00:17:43.990\nvery quick discussion given that\ndiscussion generally takes weeks.\n\n334\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.715\nWeeks before we can reach an agreement and\nonce we've reached that agreement,\n\n335\n00:17:48.715 --> 00:17:51.140\nwe've then got to document it.\n\n336\n00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.760\nSo how do we ascertain\nwhat quality looks like?\n\n337\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.190\nWell, I was trying to get to\nthis when I talked to Justin.\n\n338\n00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.620\nAnd I said, so\nhow does Megan then ascertain what\n\n339\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:06.460\nshe should sell in her coffee shop,\nwe've got to do things right.\n\n340\n00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.770\nWe've got to utilize the business\nrelationship manager\n\n341\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:14.200\nto help us to define\nwhat the customer needs.\n\n342\n00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.820\nWe've also got to use tools such\nas customer surveys for instance.\n\n343\n00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:24.160\nAnd that's what I was kind of eluding to,\nI was trying to get just into come up\n\n344\n00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.280\nwith that one but he wasn't quite there.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n345\n00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.786\nI'm pretty sure I said surveys.\n&gt;&gt; Did\n\n346\n00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:30.720\nyou?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n347\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.705\nI mean, effectively we're trying to\nfind a way to take something that is not\n\n348\n00:18:34.705 --> 00:18:36.380\nquantitative in nature.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n349\n00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.350\n&gt;&gt; But quantify it in some reasonable\n\n350\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.250\nmanner to where you can\ngain intelligence from it.\n\n351\n00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.100\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we really\n\n352\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.030\nlike surveys actually\nbecause we can do that.\n\n353\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:48.300\nWe can take the sort of qualitative\nmeasurement and make it quantitive, so\n\n354\n00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.070\nwe can say on a scale of one to five.\n\n355\n00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.720\nExactly, how important would you\nrate this particular feature to you.\n\n356\n00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.950\nSo that's exactly,\nwhat we want to do here.\n\n357\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:02.835\nWhen we are looking at quality,\nwe first got to establish what\n\n358\n00:19:02.835 --> 00:19:06.995\nthe customer perceives as quality,\nso we have got to document that.\n\n359\n00:19:06.995 --> 00:19:10.415\nNow we've got to find a way\nto gather that information.\n\n360\n00:19:10.415 --> 00:19:16.045\nSurveys, business relationship management,\nthey're all going to help with it.\n\n361\n00:19:16.045 --> 00:19:19.669\nBut then once we have\ngather those requirements,\n\n362\n00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:22.785\nthen we have got to establish boundaries.\n\n363\n00:19:22.785 --> 00:19:27.200\nAnd we've got to establish ways\nof measuring those requirements.\n\n364\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.900\nMeasuring that during\nthe course of our product,\n\n365\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.660\nwe are actually achieving\nthose quality standards.\n\n366\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:39.180\nAnd again that can be difficult,\nbecause it is going to be subjective.\n\n367\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:44.660\nSo I wanna bring us to this particular\nslide that we have here, look at this.\n\n368\n00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:49.260\nThis is, it looks like quite a busy slide,\nI know that.\n\n369\n00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.620\nBut when it comes to the right\nhand side of our screen here,\n\n370\n00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.510\nyou'll see that we have\nquality definitions.\n\n371\n00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.330\nSo we have planning and\ncontrol and insurance there.\n\n372\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.600\nWe've also got in the top right\nhand corner, what is quality?\n\n373\n00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.319\nThe customer expectations and that's\njust basically what we discussed and\n\n374\n00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:10.540\nthen we've got our quality trail.\n\n375\n00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.710\nNow in the bottom right hand corner,\nthere's this very, very small diagram.\n\n376\n00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:19.130\nBut we're gonna come to that one in a\nmoment so don't worry too much about that.\n\n377\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.770\nThat's all part of well establishing\nwhat quality looks like.\n\n378\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.970\nBut then on the left hand side,\n\n379\n00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.580\nyou'll see that we've got to look\nat ways for reviewing quality.\n\n380\n00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.780\nWe've got to look at ways to\ndocument it within the project and\n\n381\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.550\nlook at ways to get the customer to agree.\n\n382\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:42.774\nAnd to accept that quality is being\ndelivered and has been delivered.\n\n383\n00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:46.897\nThe delivered bit is\nreally important if we use\n\n384\n00:20:46.897 --> 00:20:50.950\nan agile approach then we\ndeliver it incrementally.\n\n385\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.225\nWe have to ensure that quality is\nbeing delivered on a regular basis.\n\n386\n00:20:54.225 --> 00:21:00.800\nThat has to been deliver of course is very\nvery important for the end of the project.\n\n387\n00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.560\nSo qualities not just one of this one\nof exercises that refers to testing.\n\n388\n00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.600\nWhich is probably what a lot\nof people assume that Q-A,\n\n389\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.510\nquality assurance is all about testing and\nit's not.\n\n390\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.080\nAnd the discussions that we've\nhad about quality definition.\n\n391\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.180\nWell, that's incredibly important\nbecause without, first of all,\n\n392\n00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.090\nbeing able to articulate\nwhat quality looks like for\n\n393\n00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:27.780\nthat particular project and\nthere for that particular product.\n\n394\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.400\nWell, if we can't articulate it then we\ncannot measure that we have achieved it.\n\n395\n00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:38.280\nLook at the requirements then,\nthat we have to have the quality.\n\n396\n00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:43.630\nWe have to have quality control,\nso we have to define it.\n\n397\n00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.130\nAnd then we have to be able to measure it,\nthat's the quality assurance.\n\n398\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.520\nAnd we have to communicate also.\n\n399\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.800\nSo, depending on the scale\nof the project and\n\n400\n00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.560\nwe talk about scaling project quite a lot.\n\n401\n00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.590\nDepending on the scale of the project,\n\n402\n00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.320\nwell, we've got to ensure that\nall of these roles are filled.\n\n403\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.130\nAnd the roles and\n\n404\n00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:08.270\nresponsibilities could be quite\nextensive if the scale is very large.\n\n405\n00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:15.630\nI talked about articulating a quality\ncriteria, but it has to be explicit,\n\n406\n00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:21.310\nit has to be articulated with documented\nin a way that developers can follow it.\n\n407\n00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:27.040\nYou see the conversation that we had\naround coffee, we'll go back to that one.\n\n408\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.611\nI don't just didn't\ndescribe it took awhile,\n\n409\n00:22:30.611 --> 00:22:33.180\nbecause we were talking\nabout what quality mean.\n\n410\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.730\nBut I just got in to described,\nwhat he really liked was a door closed.\n\n411\n00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.015\nHe wanted it full bodied and he preferred\nsomething that was a French growth.\n\n412\n00:22:43.686 --> 00:22:48.630\nIt sometimes takes a while to get to those\nspecific, so when we talk about explicit\n\n413\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.070\nquality criteria sometimes\nthe customer doesn't know.\n\n414\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.117\nSo in that circumstance, I would have\nto then demonstrate to Justin, these\n\n415\n00:22:58.117 --> 00:23:04.380\nare the options that are available to you,\nwhich one of these is your preference?\n\n416\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:09.340\nAnd that allows him then to be\nexplicit about his preferences and\n\n417\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.660\nI can then articulate those\npreferences and document them.\n\n418\n00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.620\nJustin doesn't need to know he's the user.\n\n419\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.030\nAnd he doesn't even need to care whether\nthat particular roast of bean is\n\n420\n00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.140\nitalian roast or whether its french roast.\n\n421\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.650\nI mean do you really care?\n&gt;&gt; I just like dark with chocolate\n\n422\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:31.350\nundertone, that's all I'm looking for.\n&gt;&gt; Right So you don't really care about\n\n423\n00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.520\nthe specific as long as it tastes nice and\nthat's most users.\n\n424\n00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.420\nThey don't care about the specifics,\nso what we quite often have\n\n425\n00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.540\nto do is we will have to show the new\noptions that are available to them.\n\n426\n00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.642\nAnd we have to say to them\nthis options available to you,\n\n427\n00:23:44.642 --> 00:23:46.690\nthese options are available to you.\n\n428\n00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:53.276\nGo and play with them and let's see how\nyou feel about these particular options\n\n429\n00:23:53.276 --> 00:23:58.368\nin front of you and then, we'll take\na questionnaire maybe after that.\n\n430\n00:23:58.368 --> 00:24:02.108\nThat just simply asks that question,\nwhat do you think?\n\n431\n00:24:02.108 --> 00:24:07.125\nWhich one did you prefer and\nwhy did you prefer it?\n\n432\n00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:12.310\nWe're also, throughout the project,\nonce we have got that definition,\n\n433\n00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.363\nwe're going to maintain what\nwe call a quality register.\n\n434\n00:24:16.363 --> 00:24:22.078\nAnd what that means is that, well,\nwe're gonna keep a checklist,\n\n435\n00:24:22.078 --> 00:24:27.093\nas it were, throughout the project\nitself to monitor how we\n\n436\n00:24:27.093 --> 00:24:34.040\nare progressing in terms of delivering\nquality, in terms of achieving quality.\n\n437\n00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.440\nBecause when we capture those customer\nexpectations, however we capture them, and\n\n438\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.440\nthey've been documented,\nthen there's an expectation there.\n\n439\n00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.200\nIf I come to you and I say to you,\nwhat coffee would you prefer?\n\n440\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.934\nYou're going to tell me\nwhat coffee you'd prefer.\n\n441\n00:24:52.934 --> 00:24:56.000\nBut what I've done is I've\ncreated an expectation, right.\n\n442\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.021\nWhat expectation have I created?\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n443\n00:24:59.021 --> 00:25:01.530\nyou're gonna deliver whatever I tell you.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n444\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.254\n&gt;&gt; I want civet coffee that is sourced by\n\n445\n00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:08.650\nhand, blah blah blah, I give you these-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n446\n00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.790\n&gt;&gt; Number one, civet coffee is\n\n447\n00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.232\nan interesting thing.\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say,\n\n448\n00:25:12.232 --> 00:25:14.640\nlet's not go there [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's not go there.\n\n449\n00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.350\nBut I guess I could get super specific,\nand\n\n450\n00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.770\nthen that can cause some weirdness, right?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n451\n00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.130\nnot just that, but you can get really,\nreally specific about this.\n\n452\n00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.880\nBut then there's an expectation there\nthat I'm gonna do something about it.\n\n453\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.040\nIf I ask you what coffee do you prefer,\nand do you prefer this and\n\n454\n00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.905\ndo you like this and do you like that, and\nthen you look at me to provide something,\n\n455\n00:25:38.905 --> 00:25:43.725\nyou look at me to make a change,\nif that coffee doesn't change at all,\n\n456\n00:25:43.725 --> 00:25:47.105\nafter I've asked all of these questions,\nthen you're gonna be pretty disappointed.\n\n457\n00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:52.975\nSo it's not just a case of\ngathering customer expectations.\n\n458\n00:25:52.975 --> 00:25:55.465\nWe've also go to manage\nthose expectations,\n\n459\n00:25:55.465 --> 00:25:59.780\nwhich is why we need to\nmaintain that quality register.\n\n460\n00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.173\nSo on our next slide, remember I said\nto you that we're going to look at\n\n461\n00:26:04.173 --> 00:26:07.385\nthis particular slide in\na little bit more detail?\n\n462\n00:26:07.385 --> 00:26:10.460\nThat was that one that was at\nthe bottom right-hand corner.\n\n463\n00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.710\nYou'll see that we have got,\nif we can do a fullscreen on this,\n\n464\n00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.600\nbecause it's quite small, isn't it.\n\n465\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.070\nNow again, this is one of those diagrams,\nit's in that nice shade of purple, so\n\n466\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.390\nthis is one of those diagrams that's\ncome straight from our PRINCE2 book.\n\n467\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.470\nAnd you'll see that we have in\nquality planning from the customer,\n\n468\n00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.448\nwe gather their expectations.\n\n469\n00:26:29.448 --> 00:26:33.030\nAnd then PRINCE2 then takes over and\n\n470\n00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:36.130\nconducts what we call\nthe project response,\n\n471\n00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:41.540\nwhich is where we actually look at how\nwe're planning for delivering quality.\n\n472\n00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.250\nHow are we going to plan\nto meet those expectations?\n\n473\n00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.000\nAnd then we also then\ndocument the tolerances and\n\n474\n00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.840\nthe methods for\nmeeting those expectations.\n\n475\n00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:57.400\nBut then you'll notice it goes back to\nthe customer again for the acceptance.\n\n476\n00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.770\nThey have to sign off acceptance.\n\n477\n00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.540\nAfter we have done our QA,\n\n478\n00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:06.460\nour Quality Assurance testing, it then\ngoes back to the customer for acceptance.\n\n479\n00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:13.100\nWhich means that at the beginning, that\nsecond box down underneath that customer\n\n480\n00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:19.340\ncolumn, you'll see that we have to\ndefine the acceptance criteria.\n\n481\n00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.952\nAnd I asked Justin in a previous\nepisode about MoSCoW.\n\n482\n00:27:23.952 --> 00:27:31.238\nDo you remember what MoSCoW was?\n&gt;&gt; Must have, should have, could have,\n\n483\n00:27:31.238 --> 00:27:36.453\nand wants, like it would be nice if-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, would like in the future or\n\n484\n00:27:36.453 --> 00:27:40.035\nwant to have right now, yeah,\neither one of those will do, yeah.\n\n485\n00:27:40.035 --> 00:27:44.504\nSo MoSCoW is about a list of requirements,\nand\n\n486\n00:27:44.504 --> 00:27:51.090\nwe wanna aim to met at least\n80% of the must have criteria.\n\n487\n00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:53.614\nAnd then some of the should have and\nthe could have.\n\n488\n00:27:53.614 --> 00:27:57.614\nAnd if it's got some of the wanna have\nright now or would like in the future,\n\n489\n00:27:57.614 --> 00:28:00.791\nwell, maybe that's what we'd\nconsider to be a bonus, but\n\n490\n00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:04.115\nit's certainly not a priority for\nthis particular product.\n\n491\n00:28:05.175 --> 00:28:08.675\nSo all of these are captured right\nat the very beginning as you saw.\n\n492\n00:28:08.675 --> 00:28:12.865\nIf we go back a slide and\nwe look at that customer column,\n\n493\n00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:16.425\nyou'll see that these are captured\nright at the very beginning.\n\n494\n00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:20.885\nAnd then, once we've defined\nthe acceptance criteria,\n\n495\n00:28:20.885 --> 00:28:27.220\nthis is when we define the approach\nto delivering quality.\n\n496\n00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.218\nAnd this is what we define right now,\n\n497\n00:28:30.218 --> 00:28:34.200\nafter we've defined\nthe acceptance criteria.\n\n498\n00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.577\nIn other words,\nhow are we going to deliver that?\n\n499\n00:28:36.577 --> 00:28:38.376\nSo planning and controlling and\n\n500\n00:28:38.376 --> 00:28:41.980\nhow we're going to measure\nwhether we've delivered quality.\n\n501\n00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.590\nHow are we going to test quality?\n\n502\n00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:50.000\nNotice, Don, and I've gotta say this,\nthis is not about testing functionality.\n\n503\n00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.990\nTesting functionality is completely\ndifferent to testing quality.\n\n504\n00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:59.324\nDo you know what I mean by that?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n505\n00:28:59.324 --> 00:29:05.609\nactually this plays into a question I had\nkind of about these acceptance criteria,\n\n506\n00:29:05.609 --> 00:29:09.044\nbecause it seems like there's an implicit.\n\n507\n00:29:09.044 --> 00:29:11.940\nLike, this should work or this should do.\n\n508\n00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.380\nBut some of them, I guess, let me back up.\n\n509\n00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.110\nWhen we talk about measurable,\nthey have to be measurable,\n\n510\n00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.920\ndoes that measurement have to\nbe thumbs up, thumbs down?\n\n511\n00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:28.570\nOr does it have to say,\nI want X to be able to.\n\n512\n00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:33.921\nI'm having a hard time just putting\ninto words how to best relate,\n\n513\n00:29:33.921 --> 00:29:39.083\nbecause I've dealt with this before,\nbut I'm not necessarily\n\n514\n00:29:39.083 --> 00:29:44.740\nsaying that I've had a good survey\nof appropriate criteria, right?\n\n515\n00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.960\nPeople are like, yeah,\nthese are the acceptance criteria.\n\n516\n00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.450\nBut a lot of times they're nebulous or\nvery ambiguous.\n\n517\n00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.000\nThey're not necessarily always measurable.\n\n518\n00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.643\nAnd you go, I don't know if I'm gonna\nbe able to do that, because it's not\n\n519\n00:29:55.643 --> 00:29:59.190\nnecessarily something I can say yes or no.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n520\n00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:02.905\nso let me put this in another way, then.\n\n521\n00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:06.125\nCuz I asked you a question\nabout functionality.\n\n522\n00:30:06.125 --> 00:30:11.835\nAnd I said, the difference between,\nwell, in terms of defining quality,\n\n523\n00:30:11.835 --> 00:30:14.655\nfunctionality is not\nnecessarily exactly the same.\n\n524\n00:30:14.655 --> 00:30:17.335\nAnd you asked about how we quantify this.\n\n525\n00:30:17.335 --> 00:30:20.895\nWell, let's just think about the fact that\n\n526\n00:30:20.895 --> 00:30:24.760\nfunctionality is about whether\nyou've got a coffee or not.\n\n527\n00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.840\nYeah, that's functionality.\n&gt;&gt; I guess,\n\n528\n00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.810\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n529\n00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:36.840\nwhat I'm interested in as a project\nmanager, or rather as a coffee shop owner,\n\n530\n00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.568\nI'm interested in whether you really,\nreally liked that coffee.\n\n531\n00:30:39.568 --> 00:30:42.930\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question about,\non a scale of one to ten,\n\n532\n00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:48.148\nhow was your coffee?\n&gt;&gt; So I'm trying to reconcile.\n\n533\n00:30:48.148 --> 00:30:52.821\nI see where you're going, you've\ngiven me more quantitative measures,\n\n534\n00:30:52.821 --> 00:30:56.168\nwould I also drill down on\nrespective portions of it?\n\n535\n00:30:56.168 --> 00:30:58.211\nLike, on a scale of one to ten,\n\n536\n00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:00.990\nhow was the temperature?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n537\n00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.511\n&gt;&gt; On a scale of one to ten,\n\n538\n00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:05.068\nhow was the flavor?\n&gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong with that,\n\n539\n00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:06.018\nbut you've gotta be really,\n\n540\n00:31:06.018 --> 00:31:08.543\nreally careful.\n&gt;&gt; Because you can end up having these\n\n541\n00:31:08.543 --> 00:31:11.313\nimplicit biases that you've built in,\nright?\n\n542\n00:31:11.313 --> 00:31:12.144\n&gt;&gt; No, you know what I\"m gonna do?\n\n543\n00:31:12.144 --> 00:31:17.815\nI'm gonna irritate the life out of you,\nthat's what I\"m gonna do.\n\n544\n00:31:17.815 --> 00:31:22.189\nHow many times do you get a survey and you\nnot fill it out, because you get three or\n\n545\n00:31:22.189 --> 00:31:25.386\nfour sort of sentences into it or\nfour questions into it and\n\n546\n00:31:25.386 --> 00:31:28.282\nthink, I can't be dealing\nwith this anymore.\n\n547\n00:31:28.282 --> 00:31:32.908\nI'm just not gonna bother doing it.\n&gt;&gt; So this is one of those things where\n\n548\n00:31:32.908 --> 00:31:36.979\nyou wanna pick the metrics that are most\nimportant to you or provide the best\n\n549\n00:31:36.979 --> 00:31:41.972\nintelligence for decision making without\nover-burdening the respective individuals.\n\n550\n00:31:41.972 --> 00:31:44.653\n&gt;&gt; Let's just say that we were trying to\n\n551\n00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:48.000\nimplement an email service, right?\n\n552\n00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.867\nI am not gonna ask questions\nbased on the functionality.\n\n553\n00:31:51.867 --> 00:31:56.036\nI am not gonna give you, as a customer,\nI'm not going to present to\n\n554\n00:31:56.036 --> 00:31:59.611\nyou Microsoft Outlook and\nthen side by side with Gmail and\n\n555\n00:31:59.611 --> 00:32:04.247\nthen ask you the question of, does it\nallow you to send and receive email?\n\n556\n00:32:06.266 --> 00:32:09.990\nBecause of course they both allow\nyou to send and receive email.\n\n557\n00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.180\nSo am I going to test whether it sends and\nreceives email?\n\n558\n00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.740\nYes, but is that important to you?\n\n559\n00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:19.374\nNo, because there's\nimplicit assumption there,\n\n560\n00:32:19.374 --> 00:32:23.100\nthat both of them are going to send and\nreceive email.\n\n561\n00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:27.903\nSo as the supplier of that product,\nthere's part of me that can even turn\n\n562\n00:32:27.903 --> 00:32:31.839\naround and say well you know what,\nthe fact that it sends and\n\n563\n00:32:31.839 --> 00:32:37.730\nreceives email is barely incidental\nbecause let's assume it's implied.\n\n564\n00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:43.530\nWhat I need to understand, is whether\nall of the other features work for\n\n565\n00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.190\nyou and how they work for you.\n\n566\n00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.100\nDo you see what I mean?\n&gt;&gt; I get what you're saying,\n\n567\n00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.550\nso would say that there,\nlet me think about this.\n\n568\n00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:58.300\nWould you say there is almost implicit\nacceptance criteria about functionality?\n\n569\n00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:05.390\nLike, if this doesn't work, so let me\nget back to a more tangible product.\n\n570\n00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.380\nLet's say I buy a super car,\nsome kind of exotic car right?\n\n571\n00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.540\nAnd I'm like this gorgeous beautiful.\n\n572\n00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.045\nAnd I'm driving along the road and\nperiodically just cuts off.\n\n573\n00:33:15.045 --> 00:33:16.970\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n574\n00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.472\n&gt;&gt; If I were to ask a survey,\n\n575\n00:33:18.472 --> 00:33:21.909\nlike I'm trying to reconcile\nthat because if you ask me,\n\n576\n00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:24.360\ndo you like how the car looks and drives?\n\n577\n00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.920\nAnd I go, yeah, except when it cuts off.\n\n578\n00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.590\nThat would be about functionality.\n\n579\n00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.620\nI don't see how you tease\napart those respective things.\n\n580\n00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.800\nIf it's a pre-existing solution,\nI understand like Outlook versus Gmail.\n\n581\n00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.320\nThey both send email.\n\n582\n00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.126\nYou assume that they both send the email,\nbut what if they don't?\n\n583\n00:33:43.126 --> 00:33:46.299\n&gt;&gt; Right, but there's a difference between\n\n584\n00:33:46.299 --> 00:33:50.450\nactually being able to do the job and\ndoing it reliably.\n\n585\n00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.397\nIn the example that you gave me,\n\n586\n00:33:53.397 --> 00:34:00.175\nwe get into the rooms of sort of\nwarranty here really of a service.\n\n587\n00:34:00.175 --> 00:34:04.475\nBecause you see, it's a difference\nbetween can it do what it suppose to do.\n\n588\n00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:08.785\nYour super car can it get you from A to B,\nyes it can.\n\n589\n00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:13.430\nDoes it get you from A to B all the time?\n\n590\n00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:15.140\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n591\n00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.460\nSo we're not actually testing the output,\n\n592\n00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.520\nwe're testing whether it is\nreliable at that point in time.\n\n593\n00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:28.010\nSo, it's not the functionality, it's about\nwhether the functionality is maintained.\n\n594\n00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.310\nThe functionality is there,\n\n595\n00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.798\nit's whether it can actually perform at\n\n596\n00:34:35.798 --> 00:34:40.777\nan acceptable warranty level for you.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n597\n00:34:40.777 --> 00:34:42.850\nso I have a follow up to that then.\n\n598\n00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.740\nSo tha'ts a sinle entity.\n\n599\n00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:45.760\nIt is not reliable.\n\n600\n00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.120\nI get what you're saying there.\n\n601\n00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:52.450\nBut would that change, let's say if I'm\na mass producer of these entities but\n\n602\n00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:57.750\nthen it's not that one\nsporadically misbehaves.\n\n603\n00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.340\nIt's out of every thousand,\n\n604\n00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.900\nI have three that just doesn't work.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n605\n00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.790\n&gt;&gt; Is that still a question of quality?\n\n606\n00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.280\nAm I getting too confused about this?\n\n607\n00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.942\nAm I overthinking this a little bit.\n&gt;&gt; Well no,\n\n608\n00:35:07.942 --> 00:35:12.120\nbecause this is exactly what\na project manager has to do.\n\n609\n00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.080\nWe have to remember in a previous episode.\n\n610\n00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.420\nSo then we talked about tolerances.\n\n611\n00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.350\nAnd this is where our\ntolerance is coming to play.\n\n612\n00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.640\nWe have to work out what our\nacceptable tolerances are.\n\n613\n00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.242\nIf we've only got one, and say we've\ngot a production line of cars, and\n\n614\n00:35:26.242 --> 00:35:29.090\nwe've got 10,000, and\nwe've got 1 that fails.\n\n615\n00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.750\nAnd whether it fails,\na complete catastrophic failure or\n\n616\n00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.606\nwhether it is just failing intermittently,\nthat's up to your tolerances to\n\n617\n00:35:37.606 --> 00:35:42.230\ndecide right at the very onset\nwhether that's acceptable or not.\n\n618\n00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.840\nQuality assurance will\ntest your tolerances.\n\n619\n00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:51.000\nAnd it will test to ensure that\nthe functionality of a service\n\n620\n00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.412\nremains within those columns.\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, I'm gonna tell you,\n\n621\n00:35:56.412 --> 00:36:00.712\nI'm gonna have to think on this because\nyou said we're gonna have to come back for\n\n622\n00:36:00.712 --> 00:36:01.356\na part two.\n\n623\n00:36:01.356 --> 00:36:04.634\nSo maybe I'll just let this dance\nbecause I'm getting in my head, and\n\n624\n00:36:04.634 --> 00:36:08.358\nI think I might be overthinking this,\nand maybe there's some other things that\n\n625\n00:36:08.358 --> 00:36:11.160\nshould be revealed to me.\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna do a part two.\n\n626\n00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.190\nWe have got a lot more to cover\nwhen it comes to quality.\n\n627\n00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:19.615\nAnd so what I'd like you to do right now,\nis I would like you to\n\n628\n00:36:19.615 --> 00:36:23.425\nreview all of the downloadable\nmaterial that is available to you.\n\n629\n00:36:23.425 --> 00:36:28.975\nAnd when we come back in part two, we're\ngoing to take a photo look at so that of\n\n630\n00:36:28.975 --> 00:36:34.955\ndescribing in our products themselves, and\nwe are be able to articulate the products.\n\n631\n00:36:34.955 --> 00:36:36.617\nWe gonna look at tolerances.\n\n632\n00:36:36.617 --> 00:36:40.580\nAnd we're also going to look at\nhow we test the quality as well.\n\n633\n00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.350\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo, I'm pretty interested.\n\n634\n00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.630\nThis is one of those things that I'm,\nthis is a lot of questions.\n\n635\n00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.690\nAnd I gotta have them answered.\n\n636\n00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:49.280\nAnd if you still have questions,\ndefinitely come on back for our part two.\n\n637\n00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.430\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n638\n00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.380\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n639\n00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n640\n00:36:55.270 --> 00:37:03.233\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n641\n00:37:03.233 -->

--> 00:00:11.722\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:16.102\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome\nback to another episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:17.900\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.330\nwe're continuing on with our\nPrince2 2017 Foundation Series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.838\nAnd we're back with a part\ntwo on our Quality Theme.\n\n9\n00:00:23.838 --> 00:00:26.690\nIf you haven't seen part one,\ndefinitely go back and check that one out.\n\n10\n00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.793\nAnd here to further our discussion on\nthe Quality Theme, is none other than Ms.\n\n11\n00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:30.315\nJo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:31.034\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:31.034 --> 00:00:33.850\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great,\nthank you Justin, how are you?\n\n14\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.477\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic today Jo,\nI tell you what,\n\n15\n00:00:36.477 --> 00:00:38.589\nwe had some really good discussions.\n\n16\n00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.004\nAnd you really made me think\nabout the Quality Theme, but\n\n17\n00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:44.080\nwe had to cut the last episode off.\n\n18\n00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.345\nAnd, well, we had to come back and\ntalk more about it, so\n\n19\n00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:47.538\nwhere are we going from here?\n\n20\n00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:49.007\n&gt;&gt; Well to be perfectly honest,\n\n21\n00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:53.003\nif you haven't seen episode one of our\nQuality Theme, then I would definitely,\n\n22\n00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:56.090\ndefinitely recommend that you go back and\nwatch episode one.\n\n23\n00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.202\nAnd I would recommend that you sort of\ndo these in, well, quick succession.\n\n24\n00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:03.669\nBecause, where we left off\nat the end of episode one,\n\n25\n00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:08.380\nwe had a really good discussion about\nquality, and what quality meant.\n\n26\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.532\nAnd the fact that quality was perceived.\n\n27\n00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:14.213\nAnd of course, the biggest issue is,\nhow do you measure,\n\n28\n00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:16.330\nhow do you capture that quality.\n\n29\n00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.895\nAnd that's what we looked\nat in episode one,\n\n30\n00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:21.739\nis how you actually capture\nthat quality metric.\n\n31\n00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:27.680\nSo that, you're able, then, throughout\nthe project, at the end of every stage.\n\n32\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.640\nAnd on an ongoing basis, right the way\nthrough to the close of project.\n\n33\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.230\nYou're able, then, to justify whether\nquality has been delivered or not.\n\n34\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.407\nYou're able to, at the beginning,\nquantify what quality looks like.\n\n35\n00:01:41.407 --> 00:01:44.180\nAnd I don't mean just at\nthe beginning of the project,\n\n36\n00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.380\nI also mean at the beginning of\nevery project stage, as well.\n\n37\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.550\nBecause don't forget, with every\nproject stage, we have to go back and\n\n38\n00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.078\nensure that the project is continuing\nto meet the needs of the organization.\n\n39\n00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:02.415\nSo what we're going to do, is we're gonna\ntake a look at what we've got here,\n\n40\n00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.210\nwhich is the Quality Register.\n\n41\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.765\nAnd the Quality Register is a document\nthat we maintain throughout the life\n\n42\n00:02:09.765 --> 00:02:14.715\ncycle of the project that looks\nat quality, quantifies quality.\n\n43\n00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:19.185\nAnd then looks at how we are planning\nnot only to prepare for quality, but\n\n44\n00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:21.890\nalso to test for quality as well.\n\n45\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.591\nSo the Quality Register will also\ndocument where we fall short.\n\n46\n00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.750\nSo, just take a look and\nyou'll see exactly what we mean here.\n\n47\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.580\nSo, we've got our quality identifier and\nour product identifier,\n\n48\n00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.700\nso what should our product look like?\n\n49\n00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.780\nAnd how should it work?\n\n50\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.282\nAnd also what we call it as well?\n\n51\n00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:42.998\nAnd what is that method for\n\n52\n00:02:42.998 --> 00:02:47.720\nproducing quality including who's\ngoing to produce the quality?\n\n53\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.030\nSo who's taking responsibility for that?\n\n54\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.570\nWhen is it due by?\n\n55\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.308\nAnd of course it could be\ndue at various stages,\n\n56\n00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:57.051\nespecially if we're in\nan agile methodology.\n\n57\n00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:58.730\nAnd what about any record?\n\n58\n00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.060\nSo any statements of effects that they\nmay be on producing that quality.\n\n59\n00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.350\nAnd that means recording all of\nthe quality activity as well.\n\n60\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.994\nSometimes, we fall short.\n\n61\n00:03:09.994 --> 00:03:12.834\nAnd we got into an interesting\ndiscussion yesterday,\n\n62\n00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:15.660\nbecause right at the very,\nvery end of the episode.\n\n63\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.372\nIn fact, I will confess that our\nconversation carried on after the end of\n\n64\n00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:22.002\nyesterday's episode.\n\n65\n00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:26.040\nBecause we got into\nthe realms of functionality.\n\n66\n00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.680\nAnd what is considered to be,\nwell what is considered to be quality in\n\n67\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.728\nterms of utility and\nwarranty, if you will.\n\n68\n00:03:33.728 --> 00:03:37.344\nIn other words,\nwhat is the difference between able,\n\n69\n00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:43.090\nbeing able to do a specific job, and\nbeing able to do a specific job, well?\n\n70\n00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.276\nWhere does that boundary lie?\n\n71\n00:03:44.276 --> 00:03:48.209\nAnd I think what Justin had said was,\nthe example you used was some,\n\n72\n00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.940\nyou mentioned a supercar didn't\nyou in yesterday's episode?\n\n73\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.972\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we were talking about what\nI thought would be aesthetic quality,\n\n74\n00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:58.469\nlike it meets my color scheme,\nit looks nice.\n\n75\n00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:02.607\nAnd I said, what if I have a supercar and\nI'm like that's really nice, but\n\n76\n00:04:02.607 --> 00:04:04.150\nthen it breaks down, a lot?\n\n77\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.186\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n78\n00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:06.650\nHow is that quality but\n\n79\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.520\neffectively those are disjoint\nconsiderations when it comes to quality.\n\n80\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.075\nI can have quality of the aesthetic type,\nor the quality of functional type.\n\n81\n00:04:16.075 --> 00:04:19.960\nIf I remember correctly, and then quality\nkind of in these other boundaries, right?\n\n82\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.724\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm gonna bring\nsomething else in as well.\n\n83\n00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:23.900\nSo yesterday, when we were talking,\n\n84\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.260\nwhen we were discussing we looked at\nquality in terms of the functionality.\n\n85\n00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.827\nSo in terms of a supercar,\ndoes it get you from A to B?\n\n86\n00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:37.566\nIf it gets you from A to B, then it\nmeets what we call utility requirements,\n\n87\n00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:40.970\nso it meets the basic functionality.\n\n88\n00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.786\nBut does it get from A to B reliably?\n\n89\n00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:47.959\nWell that reliability meets\na warranty requirement,\n\n90\n00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:51.050\n[COUGH] excuse me, in that reliability.\n\n91\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.546\nWell, it's how often\ndoes it get from A to B?\n\n92\n00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:56.370\nHow often does it break down?\n\n93\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.415\nAnd so we would set, and\nwe've looked at this in previous episodes,\n\n94\n00:05:00.415 --> 00:05:04.340\nwe would set tolerances for\nwhat would be deemed to be acceptable.\n\n95\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.255\nBut I wanna bring another\nelement into this,\n\n96\n00:05:07.255 --> 00:05:10.415\nbecause I mentioned that\nquality is perceived.\n\n97\n00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:13.330\nBut you can perceive quality\nin a number of ways, and\n\n98\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.857\nI can influence your\nperception of quality.\n\n99\n00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:16.980\nIn yesterdays episode,\n\n100\n00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.570\nwhen we talked about quality, we talked\nabout having cups of coffee etcetera.\n\n101\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.244\nAnd we also talked about that Ferrari or\nwhatever supercar it was,\n\n102\n00:05:25.244 --> 00:05:28.505\na Lamborghini or\nwhatever it is that you want.\n\n103\n00:05:28.505 --> 00:05:33.920\nBut let's think about the fact that you\nmight want it in a different color.\n\n104\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.500\nWhat color would you prefer\nyour superssscar to be in?\n\n105\n00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.262\n&gt;&gt; I guess, if you're gonna go that route,\nit's either going to be bright red,\n\n106\n00:05:41.262 --> 00:05:43.803\nbright yellow, or, like murder black.\n\n107\n00:05:43.803 --> 00:05:47.422\n&gt;&gt; Right, I was just gonna say, there's\nonly three colors as far as I'm concerned.\n\n108\n00:05:47.422 --> 00:05:48.898\n[LAUGH] Red, yellow,\nor black, there you go.\n\n109\n00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:50.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.373\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe're gonna be stereotypical, then, and\n\n111\n00:05:53.373 --> 00:05:55.963\nyou'd prefer a red one, let's say, yeah?\n\n112\n00:05:55.963 --> 00:06:00.390\nOkay, so,\nwould you perceive quality, then?\n\n113\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.662\nWould you perceive the same\namount of quality?\n\n114\n00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:08.050\nBearing in mind that I reckon a lot\nof this is in image, just saying.\n\n115\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.613\nBut would you perceive the same amount\nof quality if I gave you a blue one, for\n\n116\n00:06:11.613 --> 00:06:12.181\ninstance?\n\n117\n00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:19.070\n[LAUGH] All right, so, I know you tried\nto lead me down a particular road.\n\n118\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.539\nI don't know-\n&gt;&gt; I used the words.\n\n119\n00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.983\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\nwould I perceive the same quality,\n\n120\n00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:30.730\nif you gave me one of\nthose not three colors?\n\n121\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.661\nYou gave me a dark blue one.\n\n122\n00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:32.207\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n123\n00:06:32.207 --> 00:06:38.060\n&gt;&gt; It probably wouldn't even,\nlike I wouldn't even think about it.\n\n124\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.354\n&gt;&gt; If I gave you one of those cars,\nyou'd perceive quality in it,\n\n125\n00:06:41.354 --> 00:06:42.859\nno matter what color it was.\n\n126\n00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:45.683\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like, wow that is mustard brown.\n\n127\n00:06:45.683 --> 00:06:48.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like it, it looks good.\n\n128\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.026\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's great,\n\n129\n00:06:49.026 --> 00:06:51.210\nit's fantastic because it's free.\n\n130\n00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.698\nThe fact is that you can\ninfluence quality perception.\n\n131\n00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:59.873\nAnd the example that I gave there,\nwas a really simple example,\n\n132\n00:06:59.873 --> 00:07:01.540\nwas the example of cost.\n\n133\n00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.185\nBecause one of these supercars can\ncost a few hundred thousand dollars or\n\n134\n00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:07.336\neuros or pounds.\n\n135\n00:07:07.336 --> 00:07:09.314\nWhereas, if it's given to me,\n\n136\n00:07:09.314 --> 00:07:14.020\nI'm gonna perceive quality in absolutely\nany color that you wanna give me.\n\n137\n00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.920\nNow, if I have to buy it,\nthen I want the red one.\n\n138\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.270\nBecause I perceive quality\nin that red one, and\n\n139\n00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.090\nthat's what I want because I'm paying for\nit.\n\n140\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.448\nAnd so,\nthis is where we can influence quality.\n\n141\n00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.950\nBut whatever we do, we have to record it.\n\n142\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.198\nAnd remember what I said in a previous\nepisode about being able to\n\n143\n00:07:35.198 --> 00:07:37.726\narticulate what quality looks like.\n\n144\n00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:42.690\nAnd it may be that quality changes\nthroughout the actual project itself.\n\n145\n00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.155\nAnd this is why we manage stages, and this\nis why we revisit the quality register.\n\n146\n00:07:47.155 --> 00:07:50.195\nBecause it just isn't right at\nthe beginning of the project.\n\n147\n00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:54.434\nIt says to me, I want this particular\ncar and I want, what do I want?\n\n148\n00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:56.115\nA Ferrari Testarossa and I want it in red.\n\n149\n00:07:56.115 --> 00:08:01.530\nAnd I come back to him,\nmaybe three months later.\n\n150\n00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.440\nWhere are now?\nMaybe third, fourth stage of our project.\n\n151\n00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.380\nAnd I say to him, well, do you know what?\n\n152\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.677\nThis one here,\nis gonna cost you $100,000 less.\n\n153\n00:08:11.677 --> 00:08:16.610\nBut actually they made a limited edition\nnavy blue, and we've got one of those.\n\n154\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.920\nIt's available right now.\n\n155\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.020\nAnd it might be that it's gonna cost\n$100,000 less or it might be that actually\n\n156\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.060\nyou can have this one right now,\nrather than wait for another six months.\n\n157\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.510\nThat will drive the perception of quality.\n\n158\n00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.000\nbecause as I said things may change.\n\n159\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.830\nAnd Justin might realize that actually\nthe bright red that blood red's not really\n\n160\n00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.800\nwork is important what's important is the\nability to be able to get speeding tickets\n\n161\n00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.066\nas often as he likes.\n\n162\n00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:44.794\n&gt;&gt; Well, I will tell you-\n&gt;&gt; Which is what would happen, right?\n\n163\n00:08:44.794 --> 00:08:45.748\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly what would happen.\n\n164\n00:08:45.748 --> 00:08:48.425\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But what I'm hearing is,\n\n165\n00:08:48.425 --> 00:08:52.060\nyou essentially have this balancing act,\nright?\n\n166\n00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.840\nSo you have, we can think of it as a\nseesaw, or you can think of it as kind of\n\n167\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.300\nthis balance on a triangle with\nall these different things.\n\n168\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.807\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n169\n00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:04.621\n&gt;&gt; And then what's happening\nis that you're changing what\n\n170\n00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:09.390\nyou're willing to sacrifice by\nmoving where the balance point is.\n\n171\n00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I want it sooner, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.114\nWhat you can't get you the color.\n\n173\n00:09:14.114 --> 00:09:14.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n174\n00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.090\nI want it sooner, where you need to\nsacrifice your preference and color.\n\n175\n00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm, I can accept that.\n\n176\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:26.760\nOr, I'm okay with waiting longer but\nI don't wanna pay this.\n\n177\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.222\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever and so\n\n178\n00:09:28.222 --> 00:09:32.529\nyou're just kinda tweaking dials necessary\nwith always having a feedback of,\n\n179\n00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:36.039\nif this one gets turned up,\nthis one may have to get turned down.\n\n180\n00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:37.880\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd that's not just,\n\n181\n00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.170\nit's interesting that you say that, wait,\n\n182\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.060\nbecause predominantly we've been\ntalking about the end product here.\n\n183\n00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.240\nBut it's not just with the end product.\n\n184\n00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.160\nIt's also with the, well,\nprocesses themselves.\n\n185\n00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.280\nAnd you'll see that in this\nparticular slide here,\n\n186\n00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.700\nit's also where there are processes, too.\n\n187\n00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.050\nIt's about the way that we do things.\n\n188\n00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:04.620\nSometimes we'll sacrifice maybe\nsome red tape, some bureaucracy and\n\n189\n00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.950\nwe'll jump through a few hoops if it means\nthat we can get it a little bit quicker.\n\n190\n00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.360\nSo again, we're making those\nsacrifices in the process too.\n\n191\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.340\nWe're making those sacrifices in maybe\nour testing I can give you this tomorrow,\n\n192\n00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.800\nbut you won't have the ability to test\nit as thoroughly as you would do if I\n\n193\n00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.870\ngave it to you next month, when\nthere's a whole month free to test it.\n\n194\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.570\nAnd that might be because of\nthe availability of certain people, or\n\n195\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.086\nthe availability of certain resources.\n\n196\n00:10:34.086 --> 00:10:40.990\nBut again, the customer establishes\nwhat they consider to be priorities\n\n197\n00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.730\nin their quality, and\nit's not our decision to make.\n\n198\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.240\nIf Justin's ordered a car, it's Justin's\ndecision, it's not my decision to make.\n\n199\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.040\nIt's Justin's decision.\n\n200\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.980\nAnd we have to remember that.\n\n201\n00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.010\nAnd so\nif we do remain any of our processes,\n\n202\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.730\nif we have to adjust our processes.\n\n203\n00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.320\nIf we have to reduce or\nenhance our testing.\n\n204\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.270\nIt has to be done with Justin's\nconsideration in mind.\n\n205\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.960\nIt has to be done with\nJustin's involvement.\n\n206\n00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.280\nI would go to him and\nI would say to him, do you know what?\n\n207\n00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.320\nWe've got this blue one in, and\n\n208\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.340\nthere's something that's just\nnot quite right about it, and\n\n209\n00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.100\nI'd like to hold on to it for an extra\nweek to test it a little bit more.\n\n210\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.380\nJust to make sure that it's okay\nbefore I hand it over to you.\n\n211\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.880\nI want to test the quality.\n\n212\n00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.980\nBecause I wanna test those tolerances\nthat we were just talking about.\n\n213\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.880\nBut Justin might turn round and\nsay, no, it's okay, I'll do that.\n\n214\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.318\nWhich is what I'd do, actually.\n\n215\n00:11:40.318 --> 00:11:42.505\nI would [LAUGH] say, no, no, no,\nit's all right, I'll have it.\n\n216\n00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:44.580\n[LAUGH] Don't worry, I'll test it.\n\n217\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.142\n&gt;&gt; If it's one or\nif it's coming to a super car maybe, but\n\n218\n00:11:47.142 --> 00:11:50.098\nI'm thinking of this from perspective,\nif you approach me and\n\n219\n00:11:50.098 --> 00:11:53.390\nyou're building something for\nme, and you say, you know what?\n\n220\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.640\nI know we have this timeline,\n\n221\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.250\nI realize this isn't necessarily mission\ncritical right now, can we hold on it for\n\n222\n00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.690\nanother week just to make\nsure everything's just so.\n\n223\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.310\nAgain, you're shaping my perception of\nyou and your respective process, well,\n\n224\n00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.470\nthey're going the extra mile.\n\n225\n00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.790\nSo now I perceive you as\nbeing more valuable, or\n\n226\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.760\nI guess trustworthy or whatnot.\n\n227\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nyou've heard of stress testing, yeah?\n\n228\n00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.420\nNow quite often we will get into a\nposition certainly within IT where we want\n\n229\n00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.980\nto, well, we definitely, it's not a quite\noften we definitely before we release any\n\n230\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.620\nproduct we'll want to stress test it and\nit will be part of that quality assurance.\n\n231\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.460\nWe want to test it until it breaks because\nwe want to know where its tolerances\n\n232\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.660\nare in the real world.\n\n233\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.290\nBut what if we're in\na situation where actually,\n\n234\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:46.550\nwhen we had our sort of daily stand-up\nmeeting it was mentioned that we were\n\n235\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:51.430\ntrying to stress test the product here,\nat our ITpro.TV and it couldn't break.\n\n236\n00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.990\nIt wouldn't break [LAUGH] which is\nquite ironic, but stress testing means\n\n237\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.090\nwe test it until it breaks where we can\nunderstand where it's tolerances are.\n\n238\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.810\nBut what if it won't break?\n\n239\n00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.970\nAt some point in time, the customer's got\nto turn around and say, well, okay, then.\n\n240\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.190\nOn the understanding that it hasn't\nbroke for the last two weeks and\n\n241\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:14.120\nyou have been hammering this new product,\nthen maybe what we do is we say, okay,\n\n242\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.940\nI'm going to accept it, but I need to\nhave the ability to have maybe the end\n\n243\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.660\nof life support extended for another three\nweeks just in case it breaks for us.\n\n244\n00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.590\nBecause we don't know where\nthose tolerances are.\n\n245\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.940\nSo we have to accept that our testing\nhas to be part of our quality metric.\n\n246\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:39.320\nBut sometimes even when you're\ntesting you cannot always\n\n247\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.830\naccommodate for absolutely everything.\n\n248\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.680\nSo we have to make sure that we've got\na good established technique right at\n\n249\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.680\nthe beginning of our project for\nactually doing our quality reviews.\n\n250\n00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.250\nAnd we have to make sure that we\ninvolve all of our key stakeholders.\n\n251\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:00.330\nAnd remember, when we talked in a previous\nepisode, when we looked at organization\n\n252\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.910\nand we looked at, who our stakeholders\nwere, and what their influences were.\n\n253\n00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.460\nAnd really what they cared about.\n\n254\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.760\nNot just what their activities are.\n\n255\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.750\nSo, yes, it involved key parties.\n\n256\n00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.610\nBut remember what the influences\nare of those key parties as well.\n\n257\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.750\nThe other thing that we're going to do,\nand this bottom bullet point is really\n\n258\n00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:25.670\nimportant, is we're going to what\nwe call baseline the product.\n\n259\n00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.700\nPrior to release,\nwhat we're going to achieve and\n\n260\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.230\nwhat we strive to achieve is\na baseline of the product.\n\n261\n00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.930\nThis is what our product looks like now.\n\n262\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.500\nThis is what it should look like.\n\n263\n00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.660\nThis is our product at\nits working optimum.\n\n264\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.340\nWe'll go back to this super car again.\n\n265\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:50.940\nJust before Justin picks up this super\ncar, just before I hand it over to him,\n\n266\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:56.950\nthat car is gonna have the most immaculate\nvalet that you could possibly imagine.\n\n267\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.340\nIt is going to be sparkly clean,\nunderneath in the wheel arches,\n\n268\n00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.710\nin absolutely every little\ncrevice inside that car.\n\n269\n00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.910\nIt is going to be sparkly clean.\n\n270\n00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.450\nThat is the baseline.\n\n271\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.358\nThat is the ultimum product.\n\n272\n00:15:10.358 --> 00:15:15.230\nIt is gonna have zero miles on the clock,\nor zero kilometers on the clock.\n\n273\n00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.470\nThat is the baseline product.\n\n274\n00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.170\nAnything that Justin does to the [LAUGH],\n\n275\n00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.660\nand I was just thinking about Justin and\ndriving, yeah, okay.\n\n276\n00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:29.340\nAnything that Justin may do\nto that car after he's had it\n\n277\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.240\nwill always be compared to the baseline.\n\n278\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.230\nBecause Justin will always hear\nit at home as well, my goodness,\n\n279\n00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.830\nlook at what it looked like\nwhen we first got this car and\n\n280\n00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.070\nnow look what it looks like\nafter you've had it for a month.\n\n281\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.790\nYeah.\n\n282\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, all I got to say Jo,\nis that cars are for driving.\n\n283\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.850\nThat's all I'm gonna say,\nbecause I would definitely stress test it.\n\n284\n00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.737\nAnd you can take that however you want to,\nright?\n\n285\n00:15:51.737 --> 00:15:56.321\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The thing is, though, when it\ncomes to products, and when it comes to\n\n286\n00:15:56.321 --> 00:16:00.851\ncars, one of the other things that we\nknow that our customers are gonna do.\n\n287\n00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:04.350\nIs they're going to make their own,\nI'm gonna use the term loosely,\n\n288\n00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.770\nand I'm probably going to do this as well.\n\n289\n00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.940\nThey're gonna make their\nown enhancements to it.\n\n290\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.250\nEspecially with a car, people want\nto make their own enhancements,\n\n291\n00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.170\nmaybe they want to add a pair of\nfluffy dice onto the rearview mirror.\n\n292\n00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.530\nDon't look at me like that,\n\n293\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.630\nthere are other things that you could\ndo to ruin a perfectly good car.\n\n294\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.840\nBut, people will do that to\ntheir own products as well.\n\n295\n00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.360\nHave you ever been in a position,\n\n296\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.830\nand I know you have, where you've\nmade some changes to a base product,\n\n297\n00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.600\nwhether it's Windows or\nwhatever your operating system may be and\n\n298\n00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.840\nyou've changed all of your colors and\nall of your backdrops and everything else?\n\n299\n00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.540\nAnd then you've had to upgrade and\nit's just wiped out absolutely all of that\n\n300\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.850\ncustomization that you've done because\nit's returned it to a baseline.\n\n301\n00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.500\nAnd one of the reasons why that happens\nis because that was the recorded\n\n302\n00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.330\nbaseline that we had for you.\n\n303\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.730\nThat was what you accepted\nwhen we first deployed.\n\n304\n00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:58.940\nSo with every new release,\n\n305\n00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:04.350\nwe're going to potentially restore it to\nthat baseline until you tell me otherwise.\n\n306\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.800\nSo this is why we want\nto baseline the product.\n\n307\n00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.680\nAnd we want to ensure that whenever we\nmake any changes, either to the baseline\n\n308\n00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.310\nor when we make any changes for the sake\nof quality, that we keep a record of that.\n\n309\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.370\nWe've also got to ensure that\nsometimes we don't meet quality.\n\n310\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.355\nAnd if we don't meet quality, then we've\ngot to ensure that we have got all of our\n\n311\n00:17:28.355 --> 00:17:34.040\nrecords [COUGH] and\nthat we've got all of our [COUGH]\n\n312\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.860\nexcuse me, all of our notes for\n\n313\n00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:43.770\ninstance on what we did to remediate\nthe issue, what we did to improve quality.\n\n314\n00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.260\nOf course, remember,\nwe've got these stages.\n\n315\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.100\nAnd during these stages,\nat the end of every stage, we're going to\n\n316\n00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.560\nbe going back to the user and\nthe customer and say, hey, is this okay?\n\n317\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.550\nAnd the user may well come back and\nsay, actually, no it's not.\n\n318\n00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.040\nAnd you know what?\n\n319\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.910\nI said I wanted it in this color,\nbut I've decided that I really,\n\n320\n00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.370\nreally don't like that color, and I don't\nthink I can cope with it, so I really,\n\n321\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.580\nreally do want it in red.\n\n322\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.120\nIs that scope creep?\n\n323\n00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.520\nThat's kind of one of those ambiguous\nquestions where it really depends on your\n\n324\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.280\ntolerances as to whether you want to\nconsider that to be scope creep or\n\n325\n00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.970\nwhether you want to consider that\nto be a further enhancement.\n\n326\n00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.166\nAnd it also depends on whether\nyou're running in an agile project\n\n327\n00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:29.810\nmethodology or not.\n\n328\n00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.345\nI see you're looking pensive there.\n\n329\n00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:37.114\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those things that\nseems to be more common than not.\n\n330\n00:18:37.114 --> 00:18:40.998\nI'm like, here's what you asked me for,\nyou know, I was thinking.\n\n331\n00:18:40.998 --> 00:18:44.021\nI always heard that the customer is more\nlikely to be able to tell you what they\n\n332\n00:18:44.021 --> 00:18:45.829\ndon't like, than what they actually want.\n\n333\n00:18:45.829 --> 00:18:46.703\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n334\n00:18:46.703 --> 00:18:50.357\n&gt;&gt; So I guess you have to have\npre-established tolerances.\n\n335\n00:18:50.357 --> 00:18:55.881\nWhat are things that we are acceptable\nto make changes if that happens.\n\n336\n00:18:55.881 --> 00:18:59.390\nAnd then after that you go, I don't know,\nthat's a pretty large change.\n\n337\n00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.370\n&gt;&gt; We are really bad in IT.\n\n338\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.387\nAnd I will hold my hands up and\nsay we, because we are really bad in IT\n\n339\n00:19:10.387 --> 00:19:11.913\nat communicating with customers and\nwith users.\n\n340\n00:19:11.913 --> 00:19:17.740\nAnd I've mentioned this before in previous\nepisodes, and in other series as well.\n\n341\n00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:23.250\nAnd we expect customers to be able to\narticulate to us exactly what they want.\n\n342\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.810\nYou're right, we want that.\n\n343\n00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.890\nBut customers can't generally do that.\n\n344\n00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.560\nWhat they come to us with,\ninvariably, is a potential solution.\n\n345\n00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.740\nIt's, I want an iPad.\n\n346\n00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.174\nAnd what we've got to do, and it is our\nresponsibility, especially in this project\n\n347\n00:19:40.174 --> 00:19:44.599\nenvironment, it's our responsibility to\nsit with that customer and to say to them,\n\n348\n00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:45.898\nokay, you want an iPad.\n\n349\n00:19:45.898 --> 00:19:49.700\nDo you really want an iPad or\ndo you want something that's portable?\n\n350\n00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.740\nWhat do you want to be able to\ndo on this particular iPad?\n\n351\n00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.540\nDo you wanna be able to write on it?\n\n352\n00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.624\nDo you wanna draw on it?\n\n353\n00:19:55.624 --> 00:19:58.210\nDo you need a pen or a stylus?\n\n354\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.800\nDo you need to be able to use a keyboard?\n\n355\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.560\nDo you need to connect the keyboard?\n\n356\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.470\nDo you want to attach USB devices?\n\n357\n00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.880\nAll of that sort of thing, that's what\nwe should be asking because you're\n\n358\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.820\nperfectly right, customers generally\ncannot articulate what they want.\n\n359\n00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.930\nBut they'll be very very quick to\narticulate what they don't want,\n\n360\n00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.360\nand what they don't like.\n\n361\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.994\nAnd this is why we have what\nwe call the acceptance record.\n\n362\n00:20:26.994 --> 00:20:31.344\nYou hear of customer acceptance testing or\nuser acceptance testing,\n\n363\n00:20:31.344 --> 00:20:36.219\nCAP tests and UATs, and remember the\ndifference between customer and a user.\n\n364\n00:20:36.219 --> 00:20:41.960\nAnd we've heard of those differences and\nwe've heard of those tests.\n\n365\n00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.360\nWell, quite often it's not\nuntil we get to CAT test or\n\n366\n00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.250\nUAT that somebody comes back to us and\nsays, actually I don't really like that.\n\n367\n00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:55.820\nNow in an agile environment what would\nhappen is we would then use that as a new\n\n368\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.405\nstory, an enhancement as it were,\nfor the next iteration.\n\n369\n00:20:59.405 --> 00:21:02.170\nBut we would still chose\nwhether to accept that or\n\n370\n00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:06.540\nwhether to actually reject\nthat particular enhancement.\n\n371\n00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:11.335\nAnd so, here in our PRINCE2 environment,\nagain whether you are working to agile or\n\n372\n00:21:11.335 --> 00:21:16.265\nto a waterfall approach, you have to agree\nupfront with the customers what tolerances\n\n373\n00:21:16.265 --> 00:21:18.120\nyou're going to accept.\n\n374\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.765\nBecause sometimes, that I want\nit in blue is a show stopper or\n\n375\n00:21:22.765 --> 00:21:27.240\nI don't want it in blue it\nwas the instance that I used.\n\n376\n00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.290\nSometimes that's a show stopper, and\nwe're gonna be able to identify that.\n\n377\n00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.120\nSo we have to have some\nminimum requirements set for\n\n378\n00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.360\nquality including what\napproach we're going to use,\n\n379\n00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.280\nhow stringent are we going to be,\nhow rigid are we going to be.\n\n380\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.780\nBy the way, we don't like rigidity,\n\n381\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.480\nnot within IT because it never really\ndoes us any favors, to be honest.\n\n382\n00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.030\nWe wanna be as flexible as\nwe can within tolerances.\n\n383\n00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.628\nWhat we do have to do, and\nI know that Justin hates this word, but\n\n384\n00:21:55.628 --> 00:21:57.305\nwhat we do have to do is document.\n\n385\n00:21:57.305 --> 00:22:02.138\nOkay, we have to have the sufficient\nlevel of documentation to be able to\n\n386\n00:22:02.138 --> 00:22:06.656\njustify exactly how we ended up\nmaking the decisions that we made and\n\n387\n00:22:06.656 --> 00:22:11.120\nexactly how we ended up delivering\nthe product that we delivered.\n\n388\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:17.285\nThe other thing that I want to mention\nhere is using lessons learned as well.\n\n389\n00:22:17.285 --> 00:22:20.015\nI don't think that there is enough\nemphasis put on lessons learned.\n\n390\n00:22:20.015 --> 00:22:22.955\nAnd lessons learned is not just\nabout looking back at what we\n\n391\n00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:24.995\ndid wrong at the end of a project.\n\n392\n00:22:24.995 --> 00:22:30.155\nIt's about, when we're developing,\nlooking at current projects and\n\n393\n00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:34.185\nlooking at previous projects and\nsaying, okay, what didn't work so well?\n\n394\n00:22:34.185 --> 00:22:37.720\nIn our communication with the customers,\nwhat didn't work so well?\n\n395\n00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.140\nWhat worked really well\nthat we can apply here?\n\n396\n00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.880\nAnd so we can also take lessons\nlearned from things like,\n\n397\n00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.940\nwhat do our customers generally prefer?\n\n398\n00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.300\nYes, I know they've asked for it in blue.\n\n399\n00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.730\nBut, to be perfectly honest,\n\n400\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.150\nwe also know from previous experience that\nthey won't be happy with that either.\n\n401\n00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.000\nAnd so we're gonna try our best\nto deliver it in red for them.\n\n402\n00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.250\nOr maybe we could go for a purple,\nmaybe a mixture of the two,\n\n403\n00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.520\nthat would be quite nice, wouldn't it?\n\n404\n00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.544\nA little bit different.\n\n405\n00:23:04.544 --> 00:23:06.911\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you, Jo.\n\n406\n00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:08.945\nI think I might draw the line\nif you're like Justin,\n\n407\n00:23:08.945 --> 00:23:10.480\nI wanna give you this purple supercar.\n\n408\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.021\nI'm gonna go,\ndoes it really gotta be purple?\n\n409\n00:23:13.021 --> 00:23:15.680\n[LAUGH] I know you're giving it to me.\n\n410\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.385\nAnd I'm not supposed\nto be choosy about it.\n\n411\n00:23:17.385 --> 00:23:18.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n412\n00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.020\nit seems like you could have done\nsomething other than purple.\n\n413\n00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.092\nBut it's funny that you talk about this\nbecause I've seen people who do not engage\n\n414\n00:23:27.092 --> 00:23:32.388\nin these reflective practices, or being\naware even ongoing projects, and they just\n\n415\n00:23:32.388 --> 00:23:37.482\nkeep on trucking along and doing the same\nthing and hoping for different results.\n\n416\n00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:41.194\nAnd it really bothers me when I go,\nyeah but over here,\n\n417\n00:23:41.194 --> 00:23:44.040\nwe did this thing and this is the outcome.\n\n418\n00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.853\nWe're doing the same thing,\nthat was a negative outcome.\n\n419\n00:23:46.853 --> 00:23:49.112\nAnd they go, I don't remember that.\n\n420\n00:23:49.112 --> 00:23:52.434\nAnd part of it is lack of documentation,\n\n421\n00:23:52.434 --> 00:23:57.434\nlack of appropriate records to say,\nthis is what happened.\n\n422\n00:23:57.434 --> 00:23:59.287\nWell, if you carry on\ndoing the same thing,\n\n423\n00:23:59.287 --> 00:24:02.812\ndon't be surprised that you're gonna\ncarry on getting the same results, right?\n\n424\n00:24:02.812 --> 00:24:06.451\n[LAUGH] I mean,\nthat's exactly where we are within IT.\n\n425\n00:24:06.451 --> 00:24:11.254\nThe other thing that does happen within IT\nis you have disparate project teams, and\n\n426\n00:24:11.254 --> 00:24:15.250\nyou have one project team working on this,\nin their own little silo.\n\n427\n00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.360\nAnd another project team working on this,\nin their own little silo, and\n\n428\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.836\nthat lessons learned isn't shared.\n\n429\n00:24:20.836 --> 00:24:25.860\nAnd so really, there isn't anything\nthat comes from here over to there,\n\n430\n00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.480\nfor them to say, look,\nthis didn't work over there.\n\n431\n00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.640\nAnd sometimes,\neven with different customers, and\n\n432\n00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.180\nit confuses the life out\nof customers as well.\n\n433\n00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.790\nBecause even if you've got the same\ncustomer, and they're working with two\n\n434\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:42.210\ndifferent project teams, and those project\nteams aren't talking to each other.\n\n435\n00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.892\nYou can bet your soul that that customer's\nnot going to be very happy with IT,\n\n436\n00:24:47.892 --> 00:24:52.370\ncuz as far as the customer's concerned,\nthey only wanna talk to one person.\n\n437\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.800\nAnd even if it's talking to one person\nabout both of their requirements,\n\n438\n00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.010\nthey want simplicity.\n\n439\n00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:02.120\nIT should be facilitating\ntheir work environment,\n\n440\n00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.980\nit should be facilitating their outcomes,\ntheir achievements.\n\n441\n00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.650\nIT should not be making\nlife more complicated and\n\n442\n00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.420\nmaking life more difficult.\n\n443\n00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.340\nAnd it gets even worse if\nyou're talking to project\n\n444\n00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.200\nteams that are speaking two\ncompletely different languages,\n\n445\n00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.260\nsuch as a supplier and\nan internal IT group, for instance.\n\n446\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.240\nCustomer doesn't want that.\n\n447\n00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.350\nUltimately, we have to deliver\nquality to our users and our customer.\n\n448\n00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.840\nIt's not up to us, and\nI say this time and time again.\n\n449\n00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:33.246\nTo deliver what we want to deliver, we've\ngotta deliver what's quality to them,\n\n450\n00:25:33.246 --> 00:25:38.670\nso we've gotta have the right measures\nin place to be able to control\n\n451\n00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.720\nthat quality as well.\n\n452\n00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:47.170\nAnd so, as it says right at the top there,\nwe've got to maintain a approach,\n\n453\n00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.260\nand we've got to ensure\nthat that approach and\n\n454\n00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.570\nall of the results from our\nactivities are documented, too.\n\n455\n00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.470\nIf we get it right, and\nthese are our benefits.\n\n456\n00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.478\nI always like to call benefits\nsort of a if we get it right.\n\n457\n00:26:00.478 --> 00:26:04.339\nIf we get it right, this is what we'll\nachieve, and if we get it right, we'll\n\n458\n00:26:04.339 --> 00:26:08.569\nhave quality documentation, and we'll\nhave a culture that's focused on quality.\n\n459\n00:26:08.569 --> 00:26:13.033\nThe word collaboration's not in there,\nbecause this comes straight out\n\n460\n00:26:13.033 --> 00:26:16.910\nof the PRINCE2 book, but\nwe'll also have collaboration.\n\n461\n00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.100\nAnd that's what I like to see,\n\n462\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.640\nnot just within our project teams,\nbut also across our project teams.\n\n463\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.610\nSo within our portfolio, as a whole,\nI want to see collaboration.\n\n464\n00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.730\nAnd I also want to see quality, well,\n\n465\n00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:39.585\naddressed in project teams, and in support\nteams, and in our suppliers as well.\n\n466\n00:26:39.585 --> 00:26:46.366\nCuz ultimately, quality is actually\nthe responsibility of everyone within IT.\n\n467\n00:26:46.366 --> 00:26:50.984\nAnd the last thing that you need,\nas a project manager, is to hand over\n\n468\n00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:55.942\na project to support, to have it\ntransitioned into the live environment.\n\n469\n00:26:55.942 --> 00:26:59.609\nAnd then for the support team to be\nsitting there going, well, you know what,\n\n470\n00:26:59.609 --> 00:27:03.180\nthe project team just threw it over\nthe wall to us, we don't know what to do.\n\n471\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.688\nAnd so whenever you've got a problem,\nor any sort of incident, any issue,\n\n472\n00:27:07.688 --> 00:27:09.598\nwe don't know how to handle it.\n\n473\n00:27:09.598 --> 00:27:16.420\nAnd then the quality of service suffers\nto the customer, and guess what?\n\n474\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.084\nIt reflects on you, as a project manager,\n\n475\n00:27:19.084 --> 00:27:23.600\ncuz you're the person that is\nresponsible for delivering the product.\n\n476\n00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.550\nAnd so if the product is being delivered\nand it's not particularly reliable, or\n\n477\n00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.490\nif it's failed and they don't know\nhow to fix it, then guess what?\n\n478\n00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:38.240\nIt reflects on you, so it's really\nimportant that we do take those\n\n479\n00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.285\nlessons learned, and we actually develop\nan entire culture within our project and\n\n480\n00:27:43.285 --> 00:27:46.025\nour portfolio management for quality.\n\n481\n00:27:46.025 --> 00:27:51.980\nSo at this point in time, we've had two\nepisodes where we've looked at quality,\n\n482\n00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.350\nand we spent a little bit of time talking\nabout it, and what quality means,\n\n483\n00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.093\nand how quality is perceived.\n\n484\n00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:02.959\nSo that's what we need to really look at,\nin any great depth,\n\n485\n00:28:02.959 --> 00:28:05.840\nfor our foundation tech.\n\n486\n00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.840\nSo when we come back, in our next episode,\nwe're going to take a look at another\n\n487\n00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.300\ntheme, and we're going to be looking at\nthe theme of planning in our next episode.\n\n488\n00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:19.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you what, Jo,\nit's funny, because as you talk about what\n\n489\n00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.870\nmay seem like to you kinda these\nvery abstract topics, I'm like, yep,\n\n490\n00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:27.110\nI've been there, yep,\nI've seen that happen, yep, that's bad.\n\n491\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.470\nSo definitely pay attention.\n\n492\n00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.618\nSo I'm interested to see how\nplanning goes, and well,\n\n493\n00:28:30.618 --> 00:28:33.330\nhopefully you're interested as well,\nbut definitely come on back.\n\n494\n00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.060\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n495\n00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.418\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n496\n00:28:37.418 --> 00:28:38.146\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n497\n00:28:38.146 --> 00:28:38.858\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n498\n00:28:38.858 --> 00:28:46.201\n[MUSIC]\n\n499\n00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:49.267\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.376 --> 00:00:08.242\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.820\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.657\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:19.367\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and well you\nasked for it so we're bringing it back for\n\n8\n00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.560\nyou, more PRINCE2 2017 Foundation.\n\n9\n00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.460\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\nbe talking about the plan thing.\n\n10\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.892\nAnd here to help us along in that\nvery endeavor is Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:27.872\nHow're you doing today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:29.120\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you Justin.\n\n13\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.940\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.991\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and I said at the\nend of the previous episode I was like,\n\n15\n00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.322\nI'm interested to see how planning goes.\n\n16\n00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:41.463\nSo I'm actually really interested\nto see how this plays out and\n\n17\n00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:44.470\nwhat PRINCE2 says about planning.\n\n18\n00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.990\nBecause I have seen people make\nwhat they say were great plans, and\n\n19\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.760\nthe whole time I'm standing off to\nthe side going, that's a horrible plan.\n\n20\n00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.755\nSo is that what we're gonna talk about,\nthe structure, or the ideals?\n\n21\n00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:01.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what we're gonna talk about\nright now in this particular episode\n\n22\n00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.510\nis the theme of planning.\n\n23\n00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.420\nWe're gonna talk about\nthe importance of planning,\n\n24\n00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.044\nwe're gonna talk about\nthe reason behind planning.\n\n25\n00:01:07.044 --> 00:01:10.370\nWill we look at some structure?\n\n26\n00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.096\nWell, we will look at\na little bit of structure.\n\n27\n00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:18.990\nBut planning is gonna be really purely\ndependent on not only the project itself,\n\n28\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.750\nand the type of project that we have, what\nit is that we're delivering as a product.\n\n29\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.200\nBut also how we're delivering\nit as a product, as well.\n\n30\n00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.143\nWhen it comes to things like a waterfall\napproach or maybe an agile approach,\n\n31\n00:01:31.143 --> 00:01:36.010\nhow are we actually going to be delivering\nour product will have a huge effect\n\n32\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.155\non the type of plans that we make.\n\n33\n00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:41.319\nNow funnily enough,\njust before this episode, Justin and\n\n34\n00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.350\nI were talking about documentation.\n\n35\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.951\nAnd we were talking about sort of\nplanning and we were just talking about\n\n36\n00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:52.715\nthe fact that let's face it, here in IT,\nwe don't like documentation.\n\n37\n00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:53.314\nLook, see?\n\n38\n00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:54.658\nI know he doesn't.\n\n39\n00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:58.842\n&gt;&gt; I don't like writing it, but\nyou know what I dislike more?\n\n40\n00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:00.138\nNot having it.\n\n41\n00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:01.314\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n42\n00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:02.706\n&gt;&gt; Which is kind of this weird dichotomy.\n\n43\n00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.090\n&gt;&gt; You can't have it both ways, right?\n\n44\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.150\n&gt;&gt; You're like, I hate writing it, but\nI really hate more when I don't have it.\n\n45\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.744\nSo sometimes I just suck it up and\nI write minimal documentation.\n\n46\n00:02:10.744 --> 00:02:14.960\nIf nothing else then a quick reference or\nI can hand it to you and go, hey,\n\n47\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.563\nhere's a quick overview.\n\n48\n00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:19.140\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes, and\nI'm gonna be honest here.\n\n49\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.515\nThis is my confession time\nhere because sometimes,\n\n50\n00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:27.343\nI feel a little bit out of place at here\nat ITproTV because I am the only person\n\n51\n00:02:27.343 --> 00:02:32.193\nthat has anything to do with governance\nwhatsoever, [LAUGH] in this place.\n\n52\n00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:37.689\nAnd I am surrounded by other edutainers\nwho are very, very technical.\n\n53\n00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.585\nNow, I have to admit that I'm not young.\n\n54\n00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:45.454\nAnd so I left all of my sorta technical\nworld behind quite a long time ago, and\n\n55\n00:02:45.454 --> 00:02:48.512\nI'm surrounded by people\nthat are technical.\n\n56\n00:02:48.512 --> 00:02:52.546\nBut then, I often look at these people and\nI think, and\n\n57\n00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:55.023\nthis is the reason why I'm here.\n\n58\n00:02:55.023 --> 00:02:58.312\nBecause it's really easy.\n\n59\n00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:00.100\nIt's really, really easy for\n\n60\n00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.993\ntechnical people to just get themselves\nconcentrated just on the technicalities.\n\n61\n00:03:04.993 --> 00:03:10.950\nJust on configuration of servers,\njust on the development of products.\n\n62\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.472\nAnd if we don't have any documentations,\nif we don't have any plans,\n\n63\n00:03:16.472 --> 00:03:20.994\nif we don't have any governance,\nthen it's just chaos.\n\n64\n00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:23.690\nAnd, it's great having technical people.\n\n65\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.134\nAnd in fact, I wouldn't be here, and none\nof us would be here, in our IT environment\n\n66\n00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:33.833\nand in our business environment,\nif we didn't have technical people.\n\n67\n00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:37.873\nBut if there isn't any governance\nbehind the technical people,\n\n68\n00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:42.206\nif there isn't a way of working,\nif there isn't any documentation,\n\n69\n00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:44.198\nif there isn't any structure.\n\n70\n00:03:44.198 --> 00:03:47.669\nThen what happens is everybody\njust does what they want to do,\n\n71\n00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.020\nwhen they want to do it.\n\n72\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.821\nAnd you can imagine,\nnot just the chaos, but\n\n73\n00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:56.121\nalso the quality of the work that's\nthen delivered to the business.\n\n74\n00:03:56.121 --> 00:04:02.370\nWithout any structured processes, without\nany plans, without any documentation.\n\n75\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.210\nWhat we do is, well,\nwe drive our business to use somebody\n\n76\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.620\nelse as an IT service provider,\nthat's exactly what we do.\n\n77\n00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.650\nBecause we do have to\nhave some governance,\n\n78\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.420\nwe do have to have some structure.\n\n79\n00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.290\nNow I'm a big advocate of\nthe keep it simple approach.\n\n80\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.440\nAnd certainly within any of our\nmanagement methodologies and\n\n81\n00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.591\nframeworks here at ITProTV and\ncertainly when we're looking\n\n82\n00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:33.555\nat in this particular instance,\nwe're looking at an AXELOS framework.\n\n83\n00:04:33.555 --> 00:04:37.215\nOr when we're looking at\nEXIN-based frameworks,\n\n84\n00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:41.800\nwhen we're looking at other\nframeworks such as TOGAF and COBIT.\n\n85\n00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.600\nAnd even when we're looking at CMMI for\n\n86\n00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.780\nprocess maturity, there has to be\nan element of keep it simple there.\n\n87\n00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.830\nBut there also has to be\nelement of structure.\n\n88\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.457\nWe want mature processes, and by maturity\nwe mean that we want processes and\n\n89\n00:04:56.457 --> 00:05:01.630\nwe want methodologies that are attuned\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n90\n00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.270\nWe want processes and\nmethodologies that are developed for\n\n91\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.790\nthe needs of the organization, but\nyou know the one thing that we don't want?\n\n92\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.220\nAnd I have to say I sent\nan email earlier on today and\n\n93\n00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.230\nsomebody asked me what my pet peeve was.\n\n94\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.720\nAnd you know what my pet peeve is, and\n\n95\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.920\nthat's probably because\nI'm a process person and\n\n96\n00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.860\nbecause I'm a governance person,\nmy pet peeve though is bureaucracy.\n\n97\n00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.450\nI hate bureaucracy and I hate red tape.\n\n98\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.290\nAnd if you've got too much bureaucracy and\nyou've got too much red tape,\n\n99\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.280\nthen you're doing all of this wrong.\n\n100\n00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.100\nSo, if you perceive, and\nI'll go back to Justin now.\n\n101\n00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.670\nIf you perceive your documentation to\nbe a complete pain to have to complete,\n\n102\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.560\nthen it's been configured wrong.\n\n103\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.700\nCuz your documentation,\nwe should be keeping it simple,\n\n104\n00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.900\nit should be explicit enough and\nthis is the same in our plans.\n\n105\n00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.530\nThey should be explicit enough\nto be able to do the work.\n\n106\n00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.480\nThey should also be flexible enough to\nallow you tolerances within which to\n\n107\n00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.630\ndo the work.\n\n108\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:06.684\nBut it also should be simple enough\nto not restrict you doing your work.\n\n109\n00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:10.296\nAnd simple enough to not restrict\nyou in your day-to-day business.\n\n110\n00:06:10.296 --> 00:06:13.290\nIt shouldn't be over-complex and\nit shouldn't be.\n\n111\n00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.339\nNone of your plans, none of your\ndocumentation, they definitely shouldn't\n\n112\n00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:23.170\nbe bureaucratic and filled with red\ntape and lots of hoops to jump through.\n\n113\n00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.950\nBecause if that's the way that you have\nyour project management structured.\n\n114\n00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.580\nIf that's the way you have\nyour services structured,\n\n115\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.030\nthen what's going to happen is\nyou're gonna end up with chaos.\n\n116\n00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.522\nCuz you're gonna end up with a lot of IT\ntechnical people that want to bypass these\n\n117\n00:06:36.522 --> 00:06:39.720\nprocesses because that's just what we do.\n\n118\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.707\nWe don't like paperwork really.\n\n119\n00:06:42.707 --> 00:06:44.325\n&gt;&gt; I can't argue that I\ndon't like paper work.\n\n120\n00:06:44.325 --> 00:06:46.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I am seeing people use those\n\n121\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.450\nexcuses as a, well,\nit's gonna take up a lot of time.\n\n122\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.520\nIt's a lot of energy.\n\n123\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.630\nIt takes so much.\n\n124\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.990\nAnd I guess initially\nwhen you first start out.\n\n125\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.901\nSometimes you're like, this is simple.\n\n126\n00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:02.094\nBut you may find out that it's not\nquite as simple as possible but\n\n127\n00:07:02.094 --> 00:07:06.250\nthat's where continual improvement of\nyour respective process comes into play.\n\n128\n00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.110\nIf I say, hey Jo, we fill out this\ndocumentation for this thing and\n\n129\n00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.235\nthen you go, well hey, so\nthis takes me like 20 minutes per thing.\n\n130\n00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n131\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.780\n&gt;&gt; Then at that point you go,\nwell let's reevaluate.\n\n132\n00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because it's not as simple\n\n133\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.760\nas we originally thought we had made it,\nright?\n\n134\n00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.970\n&gt;&gt; We talk about documentation and\nplanning specifically, but\n\n135\n00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.780\ndocumentation is meeting\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n136\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.840\nWe talk about our processes as needing\nto meet the needs of the organization.\n\n137\n00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.058\nIf the needs of the organization\nare that we want efficiency and\n\n138\n00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:40.766\nwe want things to be kept simple.\n\n139\n00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:45.099\nThen bringing in a process and bringing in\ndocumentation that is too bureaucratic,\n\n140\n00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.783\nthat has too many steps,\nthat is not simple enough,\n\n141\n00:07:47.783 --> 00:07:50.358\nwell that's not meeting your needs then,\nis it?\n\n142\n00:07:50.358 --> 00:07:53.153\nBecause your needs are for simplicity.\n\n143\n00:07:53.153 --> 00:07:59.647\nSo we have to consider that our needs\nare not separate to the processes.\n\n144\n00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:03.370\nThe processes are actually\npart of our needs.\n\n145\n00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.620\nOne of the other things that organizations\ndo, is that organizations will say well,\n\n146\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.180\nI understand that our IT people need to,\n\n147\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.510\nwell they need to have\nsome degree of structure.\n\n148\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.590\nOur IT people need to have\nsome degree of management.\n\n149\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.864\nAnd so what we're gonna do is instead\nof actually sitting them down and\n\n150\n00:08:23.864 --> 00:08:27.927\nsaying this is the way we do things here,\nhere's our standard operating procedures.\n\n151\n00:08:27.927 --> 00:08:32.052\nWe're going to compensate for\nthese standard operating procedures,\n\n152\n00:08:32.052 --> 00:08:36.252\nby sending them on a PRINCE2 course or,\nsending them on an ITIL course.\n\n153\n00:08:36.252 --> 00:08:39.650\nBecause then that way,\nthey can get their foundation training,\n\n154\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.123\nthey'll understand why we need to\nhave this sort of bureaucracy.\n\n155\n00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:48.630\nAnd then because we need this sort of\nstructure, now they understand it.\n\n156\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.990\nWell we don't need to give them any more\ntraining and they should be able to come\n\n157\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.080\nup with their own structure in terms of\ndocumentation and in terms of planning.\n\n158\n00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.760\nWell guess what?\n\n159\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.560\nIt doesn't work like that.\n\n160\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.320\nIt really doesn't.\n\n161\n00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.090\nJust because you being on a training\ncourse, just because you have watched\n\n162\n00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.540\nthese episodes, does not mean that\nyou're then able to apply it.\n\n163\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.960\nAnd the whole idea of project\nmanagement is to manage a product,\n\n164\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.570\nthat manage a product through\nto delivery to the real world,\n\n165\n00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.550\nto the live environment, to your business.\n\n166\n00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.900\nThe whole idea of PRINCE2\nof a framework and\n\n167\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.690\nof a methodology is to deliver quality.\n\n168\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.980\nBut it's to deliver it in a way,\n\n169\n00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.790\nthat is not bound by bureaucracy,\nthat is not too cumbersome.\n\n170\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.530\nBecause if it was a cumbersome approach,\nand it was just tied up in red tape,\n\n171\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.170\nthen we'd never get anything delivered.\n\n172\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.570\nSo we need to have structure, but\nwe also need to have flexibility.\n\n173\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.780\nYou think?\n\n174\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.090\n&gt;&gt; So it's funny Jo because\nkinda what I'm hearing and\n\n175\n00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:58.280\ndefinitely correct me if I'm wrong is,\nwe should agree as an organization like,\n\n176\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.536\nhere's what I've seen,\nwe need documentation.\n\n177\n00:10:01.536 --> 00:10:02.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n178\n00:10:02.395 --> 00:10:06.144\n&gt;&gt; And then,\nthere's this very abstract decree.\n\n179\n00:10:06.144 --> 00:10:11.350\nYou shall write documentation, and\nthen it's just a free for all.\n\n180\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.430\nBut if we have structure,\nkind of a pre-agreed upon set of,\n\n181\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.810\nlike this is how it's done,\nthen by doing that,\n\n182\n00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.440\nnumber one, we can evaluate whether\nit's working for us or not.\n\n183\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.960\nBut also, even if we're\nworking on different projects,\n\n184\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.810\nwe now share that common thought process,\nand we're going to become more\n\n185\n00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.380\nefficient over time even if it does\ntake us a little bit of time initially.\n\n186\n00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.330\nYou go, I know how to do this,\nregardless of whether it's project A,\n\n187\n00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.208\nproject B, project C.\n\n188\n00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:39.289\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nwe're looking at consistency there.\n\n189\n00:10:39.289 --> 00:10:42.283\nBut the other thing is, do you know\nwhat the word efficiency means?\n\n190\n00:10:42.283 --> 00:10:43.621\nDo you know what efficient means?\n\n191\n00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:47.928\n&gt;&gt; So, how much output I'm getting for\na given input.\n\n192\n00:10:47.928 --> 00:10:49.366\nI'm sorry, I've went physics on you.\n\n193\n00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:50.933\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, all right, yeah.\n\n194\n00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:55.303\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if I put in 300 joules,\nthen I get out 270 joules,\n\n195\n00:10:55.303 --> 00:10:57.214\nI have a 90% efficiency.\n\n196\n00:10:57.214 --> 00:10:59.680\n&gt;&gt; So you're looking at how\nefficient something is, but\n\n197\n00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.920\nwhat does efficient mean?\n\n198\n00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.240\nI don't mean how efficient is something,\nit's an assumption.\n\n199\n00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.800\nWhat do you mean by efficient?\n\n200\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.468\n&gt;&gt; Efficient, again,\nsorry physics, science brain.\n\n201\n00:11:12.468 --> 00:11:13.072\n&gt;&gt; Go on.\n\n202\n00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:16.948\n&gt;&gt; When I think efficient,\nI'm like there is a threshold,\n\n203\n00:11:16.948 --> 00:11:22.310\nof how much output I'm getting for a given\ninput for me to term it as efficient.\n\n204\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.950\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\nto determine something as efficient,\n\n205\n00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.550\nyou're assuming that you\nknow what efficient means.\n\n206\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.969\nWhat you're doing is you're looking there,\nand we're gonna get into this argument,\n\n207\n00:11:30.969 --> 00:11:32.181\nwe could be here for hours now.\n\n208\n00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:34.107\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I feel like this\nis a semantics argument.\n\n209\n00:11:34.107 --> 00:11:36.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is a semantics argument.\n\n210\n00:11:36.383 --> 00:11:39.290\nEfficiency is about minimal waste.\n\n211\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:44.097\nHow efficient something is,\nis how much waste you expend in\n\n212\n00:11:44.097 --> 00:11:48.821\nforming a certain task, or\nproducing a certain outcome.\n\n213\n00:11:48.821 --> 00:11:51.610\n&gt;&gt; And\nI think we're speaking to the same thing.\n\n214\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.530\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n215\n00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.400\n&gt;&gt; Let me further clarify,\nso the cars that we drive-\n\n216\n00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.080\n&gt;&gt; He's gotta get the last\n\n217\n00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.250\nword in by the way.\n\n218\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.940\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n219\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.290\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, so the cars that we drive to\nwork, we both drive gasoline engines,\n\n220\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.550\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n221\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.780\nThey're roughly unless\nthey're newer technology,\n\n222\n00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.114\nthey're roughly about 20%\nefficient plus or minus.\n\n223\n00:12:08.114 --> 00:12:11.495\nAnd what that means is, for a given amount\nof gasoline you get so much output,\n\n224\n00:12:11.495 --> 00:12:12.026\nall right.\n\n225\n00:12:12.026 --> 00:12:12.746\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n226\n00:12:12.746 --> 00:12:16.381\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's acceptable in a gasoline engine.\n\n227\n00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:16.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n228\n00:12:16.996 --> 00:12:21.924\n&gt;&gt; However, 20% efficient for\nyour oven, is probably not,\n\n229\n00:12:21.924 --> 00:12:27.910\nthat means that you're gonna to have\nto crank it or your air conditioning.\n\n230\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.572\nThat means that, you're only gonna to cool\nit down 20% of the time, you're gonna,\n\n231\n00:12:32.572 --> 00:12:35.160\nthat threshold-\n&gt;&gt; Are you talking about air conditioning\n\n232\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.223\nin this studio right now,\nis that what you're talking about?\n\n233\n00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:39.568\n&gt;&gt; No because that is 0% efficient,\nright now.\n\n234\n00:12:39.568 --> 00:12:41.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's all right,\n\n235\n00:12:41.276 --> 00:12:45.210\nyou can't see it but\nit's a little toasting, that's all right.\n\n236\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:50.360\nBut what I'm saying is, is I always think\nof those as a term by term basis because,\n\n237\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.390\nit only makes sense in the context\nof what you're considering.\n\n238\n00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.640\n&gt;&gt; But we talking about processes, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.240\nI wanna forget about car engines and\nI wanna forget about ovens.\n\n240\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.190\nI like to forget about ovens by the way,\nI'm not exactly the world's best cook.\n\n241\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.437\nBut I wanna forget about that and\nI wanna consider processes, and\n\n242\n00:13:06.437 --> 00:13:10.640\nI wanna consider the amount of energy that\nyou're expending trying to do your work.\n\n243\n00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.630\nAnd the fact of the matter is\nthat you want to do your work\n\n244\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.310\nwith as minimal bureaucracy and\nas minimal effort as possible.\n\n245\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.480\nWe all do,\ndon't pretend that you don't, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.503\nWe all do, we wanna get the same output\nfor as minimal input as we possibly can.\n\n247\n00:13:26.503 --> 00:13:32.669\nSo have you ever tried to, let's talk\nabout something that we all hate.\n\n248\n00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:34.490\nHave you ever tried to get a mortgage?\n\n249\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.695\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n250\n00:13:36.695 --> 00:13:37.648\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n251\n00:13:37.648 --> 00:13:41.715\nAnd how many hoops do you have to\ngo through in order to do that?\n\n252\n00:13:41.715 --> 00:13:44.445\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, so\nare we talking of the initial hoops, or\n\n253\n00:13:44.445 --> 00:13:48.245\nare we talking about the 17 follow\nup hoops that I had to jump through?\n\n254\n00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:50.789\nI think there was a flaming hoop that\nI was on a motorcycle at some point.\n\n255\n00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:54.923\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nwhat about the unexpected hoops?\n\n256\n00:13:54.923 --> 00:13:59.488\n&gt;&gt; I make light of this, but this is\nsomething where you go,okay well I have my\n\n257\n00:13:59.488 --> 00:14:04.097\nlast three pay stubs, here's my\ncurrent checking account records.\n\n258\n00:14:04.097 --> 00:14:07.327\nAnd then you get a call, and\nthey go, actually we need six months\n\n259\n00:14:07.327 --> 00:14:11.330\nof your checking account records, and\nwe need the last nine pay stubs and\n\n260\n00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.915\nyou go,\nwhy didn't you just tell me that up front?\n\n261\n00:14:12.915 --> 00:14:14.793\n&gt;&gt; Right, and by checking account,\n\n262\n00:14:14.793 --> 00:14:18.690\nwe mean sort of a current account to\nthose that aren't from round here.\n\n263\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:19.437\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n264\n00:14:19.437 --> 00:14:20.829\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, no, no, no, that's okay.\n\n265\n00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:22.329\n&gt;&gt; An appropriate bank\naccount where your money is.\n\n266\n00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:23.963\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but then, and\n\n267\n00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:27.513\nthen they come to you three months\ndown the line and say, and by the way,\n\n268\n00:14:27.513 --> 00:14:31.085\nwe need that piece of paper that you\nlost 30 years ago, that one, yeah.\n\n269\n00:14:31.085 --> 00:14:34.735\n&gt;&gt; And so can you give me those old\nlove letters your dad sent to your mom?\n\n270\n00:14:34.735 --> 00:14:36.638\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah that's the one.\n\n271\n00:14:36.638 --> 00:14:39.078\n&gt;&gt; You're like,\nI don't see how that has anything in this.\n\n272\n00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:41.829\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You'll see what\nwe mean by bureaucracy,\n\n273\n00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:46.620\nthis is what bureaucracy is like sometimes\nin our world and in our environment.\n\n274\n00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:52.960\nAnd so that is probably as I've already\nsaid my biggest pet peeve is red tape.\n\n275\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.641\nAnd don't bring in documentation and\n\n276\n00:14:55.641 --> 00:15:00.762\nplanning in your project environment\nthat generates too much red tape.\n\n277\n00:15:00.762 --> 00:15:04.955\nBecause when you're presented with all\nof those hoops that you've got to jump\n\n278\n00:15:04.955 --> 00:15:07.192\nthrough, what's your first instinct?\n\n279\n00:15:07.192 --> 00:15:10.059\n&gt;&gt; My first instinct is to quit.\n\n280\n00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:14.070\n&gt;&gt; But your first instinct is to quit,\nor to try and find a way around them?\n\n281\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.450\n&gt;&gt; To find a way, and as a matter of fact,\nnow in subsequent loan applications,\n\n282\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.900\nnot even just mortgages.\n\n283\n00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.044\nI show up with a manila folder,\nwe were talking about this the other day.\n\n284\n00:15:21.044 --> 00:15:23.781\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I show up with like a year of checking\n\n285\n00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:26.120\naccount records, a year of W2 like,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.110\n&gt;&gt; Like I got a thick stack,\n\n287\n00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.150\nI'm like listen, if you don't need any\nmore, I don't know how to help you,\n\n288\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.825\ncuz this is like the last two\nyears of my life on paper.\n\n289\n00:15:33.825 --> 00:15:35.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, okay.\n\n290\n00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.330\n&gt;&gt; But\nit's me trying to get around the process.\n\n291\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Effectively.\n\n292\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n293\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.930\nAnd this is, so\nthat was you trying to be efficient.\n\n294\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.964\nThat was you trying to make\na process more efficient.\n\n295\n00:15:44.964 --> 00:15:46.669\nIt probably didn't work, and\n\n296\n00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:51.323\nit probably wasn't gonna work because I'm\nsure that like I said, is the unexpected\n\n297\n00:15:51.323 --> 00:15:55.126\nhoops that they ask you to jump\nthrough right to the very last minute,\n\n298\n00:15:55.126 --> 00:15:59.325\njust as you think things are going\nswimmingly Then something comes along and\n\n299\n00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:03.220\nbites you on the bum, because\nthe processes just aren't efficient.\n\n300\n00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.150\nWhen it comes to your project,\nthat's where you've got to be.\n\n301\n00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.130\nIf you're not at the most\nefficient with your planning,\n\n302\n00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.920\nif you put in too much bureaucracy,\nthen Justin's gonna go around it.\n\n303\n00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.908\nSo whilst Justin may turn around and\nsay, you know what?\n\n304\n00:16:18.908 --> 00:16:24.040\nI absolutely hate planning.\n\n305\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.110\nI hate all of this documentation,\nbut I need it, but I hate it.\n\n306\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.792\nAnd just as much as he's saying that,\nso is everybody else in your IT team.\n\n307\n00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:35.930\nAnd you know what, even I'm saying that.\n\n308\n00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.543\nI hate bureaucracy and\nI hate all of the documentation.\n\n309\n00:16:39.543 --> 00:16:43.796\nI understand the need for it, probably\nover and above what Justin does, but\n\n310\n00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:45.010\nI still hate it.\n\n311\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.889\nSo the aim is to be as\nefficient as we possibly can.\n\n312\n00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:52.648\nAnd now I'm gonna put a slide up\non the screen in front of you and\n\n313\n00:16:52.648 --> 00:16:56.880\nyou're gonna say to me, how on earth\nis all of this efficient [LAUGH]?\n\n314\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.510\nGoes back to what Justin said\nearlier about consistency, and\n\n315\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.830\nabout having an approach to planning.\n\n316\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.660\nAnd this is something that we have to do.\n\n317\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.373\nSo we're gonna come back\nto that in a minute.\n\n318\n00:17:09.373 --> 00:17:14.259\nBut the purpose of this plan theme\nis to facilitate communication,\n\n319\n00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:18.730\nbut control by defining the means\nof delivering the product.\n\n320\n00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.260\nThis should not be a one-off thing.\n\n321\n00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.377\nWhat I'm gonna encourage\nyou to do is to have\n\n322\n00:17:27.377 --> 00:17:32.402\na consistent methodology,\na consistent approach.\n\n323\n00:17:32.402 --> 00:17:35.935\nI know, before you shout at me and\nsay to me, look, every single project is\n\n324\n00:17:35.935 --> 00:17:39.940\ndifferent, and I get that every single\nproject is different, I know that.\n\n325\n00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.500\nHowever, you should have\na consistent approach.\n\n326\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.815\nWe know that all projects need to have\nsome sort of project implementation\n\n327\n00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:48.705\ndocumentation, we know that.\n\n328\n00:17:48.705 --> 00:17:52.096\nAnd we know that all projects need to\nhave a Gantt chart and a timeline,\n\n329\n00:17:52.096 --> 00:17:53.115\nwe know that.\n\n330\n00:17:53.115 --> 00:17:54.837\nSee, look, what we're doing there is,\n\n331\n00:17:54.837 --> 00:17:57.753\nwe're saying that we know that all\nprojects need to have x, y, and z.\n\n332\n00:17:57.753 --> 00:18:03.660\nAnd if all projects need to have x, y, and\nz, then have a template for x, y, and z.\n\n333\n00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:09.423\nThen that takes away the need to reinvent\nthe wheel with every single project,\n\n334\n00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:12.497\nbecause that's what we should be doing.\n\n335\n00:18:12.497 --> 00:18:15.876\nBut I accept that this particular\ndiagram looks like a bit of a nightmare,\n\n336\n00:18:15.876 --> 00:18:17.970\nand Justin's shaking his head right now.\n\n337\n00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.632\n&gt;&gt; So it's funny, because I've met\npeople who would look at this and go,\n\n338\n00:18:21.632 --> 00:18:23.537\nwe can't do this for every project.\n\n339\n00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:26.710\nBut that's not what this\ndiagram is providing to us.\n\n340\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.610\nThis diagram is saying,\nyou should consider a way to be able to do\n\n341\n00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:35.420\nthese things for every project,\nbut if you systematize and\n\n342\n00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.570\nmake it more consistent, then it's not\nthis crazy throw your hands up and\n\n343\n00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.270\nrun away all the time, you're like,\nman, that's a lot of work.\n\n344\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.140\nIt's, this is how we do it, right?\n\n345\n00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.800\nHave I got that wrong?\n\n346\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.880\n&gt;&gt; You're not wrong at all.\n\n347\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.700\nBut you see, you said something at the\nbeginning there about you don't wanna do\n\n348\n00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.840\nthis for every single project.\n\n349\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.230\n&gt;&gt; Look-\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna argue with you right now,\n\n350\n00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.000\nbecause we do wanna do this for\nevery single project.\n\n351\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.550\nBut hang on a minute.\n\n352\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.230\nHang on.\n\n353\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.240\n&gt;&gt; We're mincing words here, Jo.\n\n354\n00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.350\n&gt;&gt; No, this is really important.\n\n355\n00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.622\nBecause you see, we don't want to do\nthis for every single project, I get it.\n\n356\n00:19:09.622 --> 00:19:11.592\nBut we need to.\n\n357\n00:19:11.592 --> 00:19:14.520\nWe need to do this for\nevery single project.\n\n358\n00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.361\nSo what I'm gonna tell\nyou is then that's why we\n\n359\n00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:19.788\nneed to have that consistent template.\n\n360\n00:19:19.788 --> 00:19:23.068\nWe need to have a structure\nalready in place.\n\n361\n00:19:26.454 --> 00:19:27.984\n&gt;&gt; I don't disagree with you.\n\n362\n00:19:27.984 --> 00:19:30.393\n&gt;&gt; I shocked him into silence\nat that point in time.\n\n363\n00:19:30.393 --> 00:19:31.501\nThat's great.\n&gt;&gt; Let me clarify.\n\n364\n00:19:31.501 --> 00:19:37.550\nWhat I mean is look at this diagram and\ndigest all of these pieces.\n\n365\n00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.382\nI don't wanna do that at\nthe beginning of every project.\n\n366\n00:19:39.382 --> 00:19:42.930\nI wanna look at this diagram and go, what\nis our approach to planning a project?\n\n367\n00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.600\nLet's figure out what our approach is,\n\n368\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.510\nand then we're going to apply that\non all projects moving forward.\n\n369\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.269\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly where we are.\n\n370\n00:19:49.269 --> 00:19:53.160\nAnd that's why this diagram might look\nlike a bit of a mess, I accept that.\n\n371\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.150\nThis diagram might look like\nit's really complicated and\n\n372\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.950\nlike there's a lot to consider.\n\n373\n00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:04.590\nBut this is not something that you want\nto have to consider from a blank piece of\n\n374\n00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.920\npaper with every single project.\n\n375\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.910\nNo, what we should have for\nevery single project are templates.\n\n376\n00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.140\nThat's what we need.\n\n377\n00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.277\nWe need to have a structured approach.\n\n378\n00:20:15.277 --> 00:20:21.870\nSo this is considering a planning\napproach for every single project.\n\n379\n00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:27.110\nSo that when we start a new project,\nwe know what we need to do,\n\n380\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.010\nwe have a consistent way of managing that,\nand\n\n381\n00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.590\nwe have a consistent way of\napproaching our project planning.\n\n382\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.500\nThis is not about reinventing the wheel\nwith every single project, and\n\n383\n00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.810\nthis is not about starting with a blank\npiece of paper with every single project.\n\n384\n00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.645\nIf we know that we've gotta define,\nsay for instance,\n\n385\n00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:49.590\nlet's pick roles and responsibilities.\n\n386\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:53.080\nWe've got to define roles and\nresponsibilities for every single project.\n\n387\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.990\nOkay, so we've already got a team\nof potential project managers at\n\n388\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.230\nthe beginning of a project.\n\n389\n00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.390\nAnd the project board is\ngonna decide on who that is.\n\n390\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:06.590\nAnd what we should have is\na database with people listed,\n\n391\n00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.310\nmaybe our configuration management\ndatabase, that's a great place for it.\n\n392\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.150\nWe should have a database where\nall of our people are listed and\n\n393\n00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.250\nall the skills that they have.\n\n394\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:19.850\nSo defining roles and responsibilities\nshould be no more difficult than going\n\n395\n00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:24.730\ninto the database and putting a little\ntick next to the person's name that you\n\n396\n00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.800\nwant to say, okay, these are the people\nthat I want as part of my project.\n\n397\n00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:35.594\nAnd then if we've got the right tools, and\ntools are always gonna facilitate this,\n\n398\n00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:40.571\nif we've got the right tools,\nthen we bring those people, that staff,\n\n399\n00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:44.079\ntheir skills, their details,\nover to our project\n\n400\n00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:48.997\nmanagement tool that allows us to\ndo resource planning really simply.\n\n401\n00:21:48.997 --> 00:21:53.632\nThe same with our sort of project\nplanning itself and our timeline.\n\n402\n00:21:53.632 --> 00:21:58.200\nAnd in this right-hand side here, you'll\nsee where we've got designing a plan,\n\n403\n00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.720\nidentifying and analyzing products, and\nidentifying activities and dependencies.\n\n404\n00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.120\nIdentifying activities and dependencies,\n\n405\n00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.780\nI mentioned a little word just a little\nwhile ago about a Gantt chart.\n\n406\n00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.858\nIf we already know, and\nwe have got a template and\n\n407\n00:22:13.858 --> 00:22:18.662\na structure for a Gantt chart, it's simply\na case of going into that template,\n\n408\n00:22:18.662 --> 00:22:21.980\nand filling in dates, and\nfilling in the activities.\n\n409\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.846\nBut if we don't have a Gantt chart,\nthen we've got to start it from scratch.\n\n410\n00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:32.160\nAnd we've got to start it from\nscratch with every single project.\n\n411\n00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.660\nSo we don't want to start with a blank\npiece of paper with every single project.\n\n412\n00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:44.360\nWe want to start off with an approach,\nand then we modify that approach for\n\n413\n00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:50.070\nevery project, because every project is\ngoing to deliver a different product.\n\n414\n00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:55.780\nSo when I tell you that the purpose of\nthis theme is to facilitate communication\n\n415\n00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:01.110\nand control, it's to facilitate\ncommunication and control.\n\n416\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.855\nIt is not to hinder communication and\ncontrol.\n\n417\n00:23:04.855 --> 00:23:08.840\nAnd if you're being bound up by red tape,\nand if you're being bogged\n\n418\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.880\ndown by all of the processes,\nthen it's not facilitating anything.\n\n419\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.140\nWe've got to facilitate planning.\n\n420\n00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.360\nIn PRINCE2, what we have is what\nwe call product-based planning.\n\n421\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.315\nSo we want to plan for\nthe release of every single product.\n\n422\n00:23:26.315 --> 00:23:30.688\nAnd we want to communicate to\nall of our stakeholders for\n\n423\n00:23:30.688 --> 00:23:33.391\neach product, for each project.\n\n424\n00:23:33.391 --> 00:23:38.055\nBut nevertheless, we want to\nmake sure that that is as, well,\n\n425\n00:23:38.055 --> 00:23:40.790\nas bureaucracy-free as possible.\n\n426\n00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.894\nSo we want to have a standard approach.\n\n427\n00:23:42.894 --> 00:23:50.970\nAnd this is where PRINCE2 gives us a,\nwell, it gives us a plan for planning.\n\n428\n00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.070\nYeah, that sounds a little bit clumsy,\ndoesn't it?\n\n429\n00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.870\nBut you know what I mean by that.\n\n430\n00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:57.400\nSo what we wanna do is we\nwant to have a plan for\n\n431\n00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.350\nhow we're going to plan every\nsingle individual project.\n\n432\n00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.440\nAnd that plan, that initial plan,\nthat's going to be our, and\n\n433\n00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.000\nI hate the use of the word template but\nit's the best word to use,\n\n434\n00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.420\nthat's gonna be our template for\nmoving forward.\n\n435\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.740\nSo what I'm gonna do, because we've had\nquite a good discussion really on planning\n\n436\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:21.560\nand the need for planning and the reason\nfor planning, what I'm gonna do now is\n\n437\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.386\nbefore we get into the levels of planning\nthat we need, we're gonna take a break.\n\n438\n00:24:26.386 --> 00:24:28.622\nAnd we're gonna come\nback in our next episode.\n\n439\n00:24:28.622 --> 00:24:32.400\nAnd in our next episode, we're gonna\ntake a look at the types of plans and\n\n440\n00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.490\nthe level of planning that we really need.\n\n441\n00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.763\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, we definitely need a little\ntime to digest all of that, because we got\n\n442\n00:24:37.763 --> 00:24:40.960\na little meta there near the end,\nwe're gonna plan out how we're gonna plan.\n\n443\n00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.532\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there's still some details to flesh\n\n444\n00:24:43.532 --> 00:24:46.430\nout there, so\ndefinitely join us back for part two.\n\n445\n00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.350\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n446\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.160\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n447\n00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n448\n00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.114\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n449\n00:24:53.114 --> 00:24:59.425\n[MUSIC]\n\n450\n00:24:59.425 --> 00:25:02.443\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

Francisco.\n\n3\n00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:06.272\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.138\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:12.860\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.870\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.010\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n8\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.000\nwe're continuing on with our\nPRINCE2 2017 Foundation series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.480\nAnd well, we're coming back with\na part two, yeah, that's right,\n\n10\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.540\na part two in our plan theme.\n\n11\n00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.004\nIf you haven't checked out part one,\ndefinitely go check that out.\n\n12\n00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:32.621\nAnd here to help us further along our\nunderstanding of the plan theme is Ms.\n\n13\n00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:33.437\nJo Peacock.\n\n14\n00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:35.932\nHow are you doing today Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Justin,\n\n15\n00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:36.490\nhow are you?\n\n16\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.075\nI am doing fantastic and in the previous\nepisode we looked at that giant chart but\n\n17\n00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:43.958\nwe were like,\nwell it's a little overwhelming.\n\n18\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:48.222\nBut it was really like you should think\nabout these things, how make these like\n\n19\n00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:50.490\na templated, what you said.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n20\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.870\n&gt;&gt; The word is\n\n21\n00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.940\nkinda difficult to come up\nwith an appropriate word.\n\n22\n00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.073\nBut where are we're going here?\n\n23\n00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:57.580\nWe talked about that templated thing.\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we\n\n24\n00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.930\ntalked about in our last episode was we\ntalked about having some consistency.\n\n25\n00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.410\nWe talked about having\na standardized approach to.\n\n26\n00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.080\nYeah, that makes a better word?\n\n27\n00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.840\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n28\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.150\nI think that when we think templated,\nI think we'll go print out form.\n\n29\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.831\nLet me go to the printer and,\n\n30\n00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:17.627\nbut that's not templated in\nthe construct of this is what we do.\n\n31\n00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:18.739\nI think standardized is\na more appropriate provision.\n\n32\n00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.587\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we want a standardized approach.\n\n33\n00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:25.516\nWe want an approach that can be applied\nto absolutely every single project,\n\n34\n00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:27.960\nbut that is not too specific.\n\n35\n00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.751\nSo we need an approach that's flexible.\n\n36\n00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:34.069\nWe need an approach that can be customized\nto every single project but it's\n\n37\n00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.350\na standard approach so that we know that\nour project has to go through these steps.\n\n38\n00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.890\nThese people need to be involved.\n\n39\n00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.870\nAnd we know that that there are certain\nthings that have to happen as part\n\n40\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.034\nof the project.\n\n41\n00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:52.683\nSo let's take a look then at the levels of\nplanning that we have within a project.\n\n42\n00:01:52.683 --> 00:01:56.546\nNow, anything that, and\nI know that I've said this before, but\n\n43\n00:01:56.546 --> 00:01:59.074\nanything that is purple in your diagrams,\n\n44\n00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:04.007\nthat comes straight out of your PRINCE2\nbook, your PRINCE2 manual from AXELOS.\n\n45\n00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:06.839\nWhilst you don't necessarily\nneed that book for\n\n46\n00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:10.993\nyour foundation exam, you will need\nthat for your practitioner exam.\n\n47\n00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:15.682\nSo these materials that available to\nyou for download are suitable for\n\n48\n00:02:15.682 --> 00:02:17.279\nyour foundation exam.\n\n49\n00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:22.670\nAnd your foundation exam is a closed book\nexam, but you will need to have the book\n\n50\n00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.170\nfor your practitioner test if you wish to\ngo on to do your PRINCE2 practitioner.\n\n51\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.390\nSo you'll see here what we've\ngot are levels of plan here.\n\n52\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.240\nNow, you'll notice that we've kind of\nsplit it into two, so right at the very\n\n53\n00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.950\ntop you've got what the customer\nrequirements are and the customer's plans.\n\n54\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.260\nAnd of course the customer is going to\ngive you lots of input in terms of time,\n\n55\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.550\nin terms of the cost or basically what\ntheir budget is when they want it.\n\n56\n00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.010\nWhat it is that they want to see.\n\n57\n00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.610\nAnd what we're going to do\nis we're gonna come up with\n\n58\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.860\nwhat we call an initiation plan.\n\n59\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.940\nAnd that initiation plan is the, well,\n\n60\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.110\nit's all of the information that I\nneed to be able to start my project.\n\n61\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.490\nSo, what is my project going to look like?\n\n62\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.980\nIs it gonna be an agile approach?\n\n63\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.790\nIs it going to be a waterfall approach?\n\n64\n00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.480\nHow many people\nare involved in my project?\n\n65\n00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.340\nWho's going to be on my project board?\n\n66\n00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.550\nWhat time scales are we talking about?\n\n67\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.280\nHow much money do we have to spend?\n\n68\n00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.920\nAll of that is going to be\nin our initiation plan.\n\n69\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.340\nAnd then that next column,\n\n70\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.180\nthe column in the middle is\nthe actual project plan itself.\n\n71\n00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.550\nSo this is how are we going\nto get through the project?\n\n72\n00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.180\nManaging by stages.\n\n73\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.270\nHow are we moving from\none stage to the next?\n\n74\n00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.420\nHow many stages are there?\n\n75\n00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.940\nHow do we get from this stage?\n\n76\n00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.630\nWhat boxes do we have to take in order\nto be able to move from here to here?\n\n77\n00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.460\nSo these are our stage plan.\n\n78\n00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.306\nSo we have that overarching project\nplan and then we have the stage plans.\n\n79\n00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:05.370\nUnderpinning the plan for each stage\nare going to be individual team plans.\n\n80\n00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.594\nAnd these are the plans that are for\nthe developers.\n\n81\n00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:13.109\nSo these are the plans where\neach developer gets to say, and\n\n82\n00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.160\nthis is what I should be working\non at his particular point.\n\n83\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.850\nNow don't forget what's on\nthe right-hand side here, and\n\n84\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.810\nI see Justin's looking at\nthis with a little bit of,\n\n85\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.890\nI don't know, concern I think.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it's concern but\n\n86\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.590\nI just want to make sure I'm not.\n\n87\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.361\nSo when we create our plan,\n\n88\n00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:34.091\nthis overarching goal.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n89\n00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:36.130\n&gt;&gt; These stage plans.\n\n90\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.009\nWe don't go crazy with putting\nall of that out front, do we?\n\n91\n00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.534\nAre these stage plans more of\nan incremental like I have these first two\n\n92\n00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:47.472\nstages and once I get to there, I know\nwhat my end goal is, I still have an idea,\n\n93\n00:04:47.472 --> 00:04:49.525\nbut I still make it a further stage plan.\n\n94\n00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:52.186\nAm I continuously, now wait a minute,\n\n95\n00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:55.655\ncontinually planning at\nthe end of those stages and\n\n96\n00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:59.239\nnot trying to do all of that upfront?\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, and\n\n97\n00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:00.989\nthat's an important point to make.\n\n98\n00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:08.135\nSo your vision, your long-term project\ngoal, you don't want to plan in detail.\n\n99\n00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:12.910\nYou have your long-term project goal and\nthat should always be your goal.\n\n100\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.710\nYou have to bear in mind [COUGH] excuse\nme, that that could be subject to change.\n\n101\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.340\nYeah, we've talked about scope creep and\nwe talked about sort of exceptions,\n\n102\n00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.010\nthings that might happen\nthat you weren't expecting.\n\n103\n00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.120\nYour long-term goal is going to be there,\nbut\n\n104\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.844\nhow you get to that long-term goal,\nyou plan the next step in detail.\n\n105\n00:05:32.844 --> 00:05:37.382\nBut because what each subsequent stage\nis going to be, well it's not even\n\n106\n00:05:37.382 --> 00:05:42.860\npredominantly based, it's purely based\non what happened in the previous stage.\n\n107\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.160\nYou cannot plan the long\nterm in great detail.\n\n108\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.111\nLet's think about this.\n\n109\n00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:53.611\nIf I was walking towards an end goal,\nand I was gonna take one\n\n110\n00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:59.115\nstep after another,\nthen I am going to plan this next step.\n\n111\n00:05:59.115 --> 00:06:05.340\nAnd I'm not gonna plan the next step\nuntil after I've got here, why?\n\n112\n00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.921\nBecause this first step\nmight not actually go,\n\n113\n00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:10.831\nwell I might not take as wide\na stride as I expected to.\n\n114\n00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:13.701\nI might not get to where\nI wanted to get to or\n\n115\n00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:16.904\nI might actually overshoot and\nachieve more.\n\n116\n00:06:16.904 --> 00:06:21.140\nAnd if that happens,\nthat's why we have exception planning.\n\n117\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.130\nIf that happens,\n\n118\n00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.950\nthen any plans that I've done from\nhere on outwards will be obsolete.\n\n119\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.484\nAnd that will be\nan inefficient thing to do.\n\n120\n00:06:28.484 --> 00:06:31.681\nIt's not efficient to plan\nthe long term in great detail,\n\n121\n00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:36.070\nbecause we simply don't know where we're\ngonna get to with every single step.\n\n122\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.701\nDoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; Then that makes sense, for\n\n123\n00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:42.046\nsome reason the vision of coming\nup to a rickety bridge over\n\n124\n00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:44.036\na canyon river with a rope bridge.\n\n125\n00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:46.157\nAnd I know this is negative imagery.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n126\n00:06:46.157 --> 00:06:46.848\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n127\n00:06:46.848 --> 00:06:50.167\nyou're really focused on the couple\nof steps in front of you, right?\n\n128\n00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:51.648\nThe one-\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm focused on turning around and\n\n129\n00:06:51.648 --> 00:06:53.576\ngoing back the other way.\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's that,\n\n130\n00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:55.421\nwe're using this as a metaphor.\n\n131\n00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:57.125\nI would not be on that bridge either,\nright?\n\n132\n00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:57.711\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n133\n00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:59.096\n&gt;&gt; But you're like okay,\n\n134\n00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:01.726\nI can't look at that\nplank that might be broke\n\n135\n00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:05.690\nhalfway across the bridge until I\nmake those first couple of steps.\n\n136\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.533\nI need to get to the other side,\nthat's my goal.\n\n137\n00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:09.811\nFor some reason that's what came to mind,\nJo.\n\n138\n00:07:09.811 --> 00:07:13.221\nIt is somewhat of an odd imagery, but\nI'm like okay, that really make sense,\n\n139\n00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:16.683\nI wanna look directly [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, this face says it all.\n\n140\n00:07:16.683 --> 00:07:19.523\nI mean, I kind of understand\nwhere you are going to\n\n141\n00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:22.229\nwith that one but\nseriously I would be running in\n\n142\n00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.179\nthe opposite direction.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe there's lions in the other\n\n143\n00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:25.753\ndirection.\n\n144\n00:07:25.753 --> 00:07:28.455\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do you know what,\n\n145\n00:07:28.455 --> 00:07:30.532\nI'd rather face the lions.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n146\n00:07:30.532 --> 00:07:32.720\nI'd take my chances with the bridge.\n\n147\n00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.780\nBut if you do decide to take your chances,\nyou're looking right in front of you.\n\n148\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.880\n&gt;&gt; One step at a time, one step at a time.\n\n149\n00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.566\nAnd one of the things we talk about\nwhen we talk about continual improvement\n\n150\n00:07:43.566 --> 00:07:46.912\nis that continual improvement is\nmaking iterative improvements.\n\n151\n00:07:46.912 --> 00:07:48.717\nIt's iterative progress.\n\n152\n00:07:48.717 --> 00:07:51.214\nAnd that's what we need\nto do every single step.\n\n153\n00:07:51.214 --> 00:07:55.504\nEvery single stage must build on\nthe progress that's been made by\n\n154\n00:07:55.504 --> 00:07:56.917\nthe previous stage.\n\n155\n00:07:56.917 --> 00:08:02.492\nAnd so we do have those exception plans\nthat you can see on the right hand side\n\n156\n00:08:02.492 --> 00:08:09.310\nthat are there just simply to accommodate\nwhere things have not gone as expected.\n\n157\n00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.700\nI am not going to say where\nthings have gone wrong, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.060\nCuz that's not always the case.\n\n159\n00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.190\nSometimes things don't go wrong, but\n\n160\n00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.910\nsometimes customers change\ntheir requirements.\n\n161\n00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.620\nOr maybe, it's not the customers\nthat change their requirements,\n\n162\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.110\nsometimes the business\nchanges their requirements.\n\n163\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.960\nSo it's not all about things going wrong,\n\n164\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.960\nit's just about the fact\nthat things change.\n\n165\n00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.580\nAnd so any exception planning\nhas to be planning for well,\n\n166\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.750\nwhat do we need to do to change\nin our subsequent stage?\n\n167\n00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.030\nSo here, and again,\n\n168\n00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:48.750\nthis comes from our PRINCE2 book,\nhere again we have a plan and approach.\n\n169\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.332\nThis is a PRINCE2 out of\nthe box planning approach.\n\n170\n00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:57.532\nNow, I have already said that\nI expect you to tailor this,\n\n171\n00:08:57.532 --> 00:09:03.220\nthat's the word that we use,\nwe're going to tailor this approach.\n\n172\n00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.990\nNow, from your foundation, before your\nfoundation test you're gonna be expected\n\n173\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.575\nto know what our plan and approach is.\n\n174\n00:09:10.575 --> 00:09:14.890\nFor your practitioner you're\ngonna be expected to be able to\n\n175\n00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.470\ntailor this approach.\n\n176\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.051\nSo you're gonna be expected to be able\nto know what we should modify in certain\n\n177\n00:09:21.051 --> 00:09:24.857\nsituations and what it should\nlook like in certain situations,\n\n178\n00:09:24.857 --> 00:09:29.374\njust bearing in mind that every single\norganization is completely unique.\n\n179\n00:09:29.374 --> 00:09:31.850\nAnd every single project is\ncompletely unique as well.\n\n180\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.150\nSo what we're going to do is\nwe're gonna design our plan.\n\n181\n00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.970\nThat's a pre-requisite,\nbut that comes out front.\n\n182\n00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.480\nThis is what our consistent\napproach is going to look like.\n\n183\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.400\nAnd then we define and analyze\nthe products, that's what's needed, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.710\nDefining and\nanalyzing what is needed as an end goal.\n\n185\n00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.590\nRemember, in this particular stage,\nin this particular process,\n\n186\n00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:01.570\nwhat we're doing is simply\ndefining an approach to planning.\n\n187\n00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.840\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n188\n00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.740\nThis is not delivering the product, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.050\nBut this is just defining\nthe approach to planning.\n\n190\n00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.110\nSo we're going to design what\nour plan should look like.\n\n191\n00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.470\nWe're gonna analyze the product,\nwe're gonna identify any activities and\n\n192\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.570\nany dependencies that may exist on these\nactivities and then prepare estimates and\n\n193\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:28.620\nprepare a schedule, or schedule,\nas Justin might say, and\n\n194\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.480\nthen we document our project plan, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:38.367\nAnd documenting our project plan,\nwell, generally looks like this.\n\n196\n00:10:38.367 --> 00:10:40.380\nDo you know what this is\non the right hand side?\n\n197\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.519\n&gt;&gt; Is that a Gantt chart?\n\n198\n00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:48.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not normally purple,\n\n199\n00:10:48.264 --> 00:10:49.696\nall right [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of times [CROSSTALK]\n\n200\n00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:50.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:10:50.744 --> 00:10:52.359\n&gt;&gt; So there are a lot of programs that\n\n202\n00:10:52.359 --> 00:10:56.227\nmake them super fanciful or whatever but\nthis is something you can legitimately\n\n203\n00:10:56.227 --> 00:11:00.460\ndraw on a common whiteboard or something.\n&gt;&gt; You can draw this on a whiteboard and\n\n204\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.324\nquite often, when we're using Agile\napproaches, then you will see what we call\n\n205\n00:11:05.324 --> 00:11:09.687\ninformation radiators, and\ninformation radiators are whiteboards or\n\n206\n00:11:09.687 --> 00:11:14.646\na central repository, a drop box, for\ninstance, where we keep out Gantt chart.\n\n207\n00:11:14.646 --> 00:11:19.800\nAnd it'll actually allow us to track\nprogress through the project itself.\n\n208\n00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.910\nSo we can see just how far we've got and\nwe can see what's been achieved and\n\n209\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.580\nwhat hasn't been achieved.\n\n210\n00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.800\nAnd we should also be able to see when\nthings are needed by what management\n\n211\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.520\nstage they should be in,\nwho's responsible for\n\n212\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.200\nthose activities and\nwhere the dependencies lies as well.\n\n213\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.760\nOrdinarily, what I will see on\nthose lines of that gap chart,\n\n214\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.740\nis I will see little drop down\narrows that show dependencies.\n\n215\n00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.890\nSo, the fact that the detailed design\nhas got to be completed before\n\n216\n00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.830\nthe build happens, for instance.\n\n217\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.007\nSo I'll see dependencies quite often.\n\n218\n00:11:54.007 --> 00:11:56.230\nLike I said, they're not often in purple.\n\n219\n00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.560\nIn fact, no, this has just come\nstraight out of the PRINCE2 book,\n\n220\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.670\nI've not really seen\nany that are in purple,\n\n221\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.445\nit doesn't make for\nreally good reading for everybody, that.\n\n222\n00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.860\nThere are lots of tools out there, there\nare a lot of free tools out there that\n\n223\n00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:16.010\nwill help you to achieve\na project Gantt chart.\n\n224\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.950\nI would tell you, and\nthis is just my own personal opinion,\n\n225\n00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:24.380\nI have seen projects where a Gantt\nchart hasn't been created.\n\n226\n00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:29.280\nBecause you don't then have a high level\nview of how that project is going to\n\n227\n00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.280\nprogress, it can be quite demoralizing for\n\n228\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.670\nthe team that are trying to\nactually deliver the product,\n\n229\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:43.800\nbecause they don't see how\nmuch progress they're making,\n\n230\n00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.910\nthey don't see how close they\nare getting towards their goal.\n\n231\n00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.660\nAnd it can be quite demoralizing\nif you're just working away and\n\n232\n00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.770\nyou're not seeing any achievement.\n\n233\n00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:58.890\nSo, it's always good, I find,\nfrom a visibility perspective and\n\n234\n00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.600\nfrom a motivational perspective, to have\nsome sort of Gantt chart visibility,\n\n235\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.660\nsomething that allows the teams and\n\n236\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.870\nall of your stakeholders to\nsee what the progress is.\n\n237\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.640\nNow, one of the common questions that I\nget asked at this point in time is do we\n\n238\n00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.030\nmake this Gantt chart\navailable to our customer?\n\n239\n00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.840\nI can't answer that for you.\n\n240\n00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.540\nI don't know, is the answer to that.\n\n241\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:27.000\nYou've got to decide, and\nyou've gotta decide based on things like\n\n242\n00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.860\nhow transparent do you want\nto be to your customer, and\n\n243\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.780\nhow transparent do you want\nto be to the business?\n\n244\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.510\nBut you've also gotta\ntemper that with well,\n\n245\n00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.600\nwhat about setting expectations and\nmissetting expectations, rather?\n\n246\n00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.437\nCuz sometimes you promise something, and\nyou promise it by a certain time, and then\n\n247\n00:13:46.437 --> 00:13:50.936\nwhat you're able to deliver is kind of\nlike half of that particular product and\n\n248\n00:13:50.936 --> 00:13:53.820\nit's a month later than\nyou originally thought.\n\n249\n00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.030\nSo, do you choose to make\nthat public to the customers?\n\n250\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.808\nThat's entirely up to you,\nwe like transparency but at the same\n\n251\n00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:07.029\ntime it has to be your decision.\n&gt;&gt; It seems that this would come\n\n252\n00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:11.135\nwith an appropriate education\nabout the usage of these tools for\n\n253\n00:14:11.135 --> 00:14:14.810\nyour respective teams or\na project particularly.\n\n254\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:19.200\nBecause, if someone has\nnot used a Gantt chart,\n\n255\n00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.470\nright, they're not necessarily\ndifficult to read,\n\n256\n00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.097\nI think there maybe\na misalignment of expectations.\n\n257\n00:14:27.097 --> 00:14:29.643\nSay, this is when the delivery dated.\n\n258\n00:14:29.643 --> 00:14:33.830\nNo, no, this is our plan [LAUGH].\n\n259\n00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.920\nThere are things that can happen\nthat will continually alter this.\n\n260\n00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.700\n&gt;&gt; It's like communication of any sort of\n\n261\n00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.300\nschedule, it really is.\n\n262\n00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:51.830\nYou've gotta be really, really careful\nbecause you could misset the expectations.\n\n263\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.950\nAnd it's not just with the customers,\nalso with the team as well.\n\n264\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:01.667\nAnd it can, if you don't keep it updated\nand you don't keep to your time-frames,\n\n265\n00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:07.551\nand you don't achieve your goals when you\nthink you're going to achieve your goals,\n\n266\n00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:10.104\nit can be incredibly demoralizing.\n\n267\n00:15:10.104 --> 00:15:14.521\nAnd it can have a negative effect,\nbecause you would actually see, and\n\n268\n00:15:14.521 --> 00:15:19.085\nthe teams will actually see that maybe\na particular person is not actually\n\n269\n00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:23.796\nkeeping up with their activities, or\nmaybe a particular team doesn't seem\n\n270\n00:15:23.796 --> 00:15:27.366\nto have as big a workload as\nsay some of the other teams do.\n\n271\n00:15:27.366 --> 00:15:32.858\nSo, I've seen Gantt charts that are used\nas a weapon, a weapon to beat up other\n\n272\n00:15:32.858 --> 00:15:39.140\nteams, and a weapon to justify why certain\nteams don't get bonuses for instance.\n\n273\n00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:45.044\nBut I've also seen Gantt charts used\nas a really good communication tool\n\n274\n00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:50.191\nto add visibility to a project and\nto the progress of a project.\n\n275\n00:15:50.191 --> 00:15:54.714\nI like transparency but\nI also like accuracy as well.\n\n276\n00:15:54.714 --> 00:16:00.624\nAnd I am not a huge big fan of\ndisplaying the Gantt chart for\n\n277\n00:16:00.624 --> 00:16:06.677\neverybody to see,\nwhen that Gantt chart is not accurate.\n\n278\n00:16:06.677 --> 00:16:11.531\nAnd there are organizations where I\nhave performed some consultancy, and\n\n279\n00:16:11.531 --> 00:16:13.611\ndone some program management,\n\n280\n00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:19.017\nin where I find that these organizations\ndon't want to make a Gantt chart visible.\n\n281\n00:16:19.017 --> 00:16:23.541\nBecause it's almost as though they are\nthen committing to certain deadlines and\n\n282\n00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:25.162\nthey don't want to do that.\n\n283\n00:16:25.162 --> 00:16:29.830\nWell do you know what, if you do that then\nyou're not particularly being transparent.\n\n284\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.360\nThe customer has no visibility whatsoever\nand therefore if the customer has\n\n285\n00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.560\nno visibility then there's very\nlittle trust there for the customer.\n\n286\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.950\nYou have to weigh that up.\n\n287\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.460\nI can't answer the question for\nyou, but I would always say as\n\n288\n00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.150\nlong as your Gantt chart is accurate and\nas long as you have your estimation and\n\n289\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.090\nyour planning correct, and\nyou know how many stages you want.\n\n290\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.280\nAnd you know exactly what's going to\nhappen in each stage then there is\n\n291\n00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:01.100\nabsolutely no reason whatsoever why you\nshouldn't communicate your Gantt chart and\n\n292\n00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.330\nensure that it's visible.\n\n293\n00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.420\nOne thing I will tell you about\nyour Gantt chart is though,\n\n294\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.290\nyou must keep it up to date,\nit must be accurate.\n\n295\n00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.100\nYou don't put your Gantt chart at the\nbeginning of a project because that's your\n\n296\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.120\nplan, that's your high-level plan and\nthen that's it, it doesn't happen.\n\n297\n00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.950\nIt doesn't get updated at all for\nthroughout the rest of the project.\n\n298\n00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:25.560\nThe other thing that the Gantt chart\ndoesn't contain, are detailed plans for\n\n299\n00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.160\nevery single team.\n\n300\n00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:33.110\nIf you remember,\nif we go back to this particular diagram,\n\n301\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.630\nyou see your team plans\nare underneath your project plan, so\n\n302\n00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.860\nyour project plan is displayed in\na pictorial way using the Gantt Chart.\n\n303\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:47.240\nBut your team plans are underneath that\nand your team plans are where we find\n\n304\n00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.269\nour individual development activities and\n\n305\n00:17:51.269 --> 00:17:54.690\nindividuals like QA and\ntesting activities.\n\n306\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.546\nThey will be in the team plans.\n\n307\n00:17:56.546 --> 00:18:03.780\nI do not expect this Gantt chart to\nhave anything detailed in there.\n\n308\n00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.192\nThat is gonna be one heck of a cumbersome\ndocument if that is what you have got\n\n309\n00:18:08.192 --> 00:18:08.830\nin there.\n\n310\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.740\nYou're thinking.\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n311\n00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.550\n&gt;&gt; That's dangerous.\n\n312\n00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.460\n&gt;&gt; I am, it sometimes is.\n\n313\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.980\nAnd I'm a little over focused\non the Gantt chart, but\n\n314\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:25.070\nI'm trying to make sure that I have\nkind of this approach to planning.\n\n315\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.270\nSo, would you have a chart\nlike this that is for\n\n316\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.140\nthe entire scope of the project\nthat may be less detailed.\n\n317\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:37.440\nWe're talking very microscopic,\nthese are overall kinda thought process.\n\n318\n00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.000\nBut then would you have these also for\nthe respective stage plans,\n\n319\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.390\nwhere it is more detailed or\nmore kind of zoomed in.\n\n320\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:50.276\nSo you would have, here's my overall goal,\nhere's our ultimate timeline but\n\n321\n00:18:50.276 --> 00:18:51.621\nthey are very broad goals.\n\n322\n00:18:51.621 --> 00:18:54.981\nWe're gonna finish our\nplan during this time or\n\n323\n00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:57.240\ndesign rather.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n324\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.400\n&gt;&gt; But then for that stage you would have\n\n325\n00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.520\nkind of this inset, the subset where you\ngo in order to do that, this is what we're\n\n326\n00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.940\ngoing to do over these set of times.\n&gt;&gt; What I'm.\n\n327\n00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.900\n&gt;&gt; Or I'm over thinking this?\n\n328\n00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.960\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, you know what\n\n329\n00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.550\nI'm expecting to see is my overall\nproject plan is going to look like that.\n\n330\n00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.280\nWhat's on the screen in\nfront of you right now.\n\n331\n00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.360\nThat's what my overall project\nplan is gonna look like.\n\n332\n00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.880\nBut then, let's say for instance,\nfor management stage two.\n\n333\n00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.470\nYou will see that we've\ngot two things going on.\n\n334\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.890\nWe've got a detail design and\nwe've got a training syllabus.\n\n335\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.920\nSo, I'd expect both of those bars to be\n\n336\n00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:36.500\nexploded out into individual plans for\nthe teams that are working on those.\n\n337\n00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.340\nBear in mind that they might\nbe cross functional as well.\n\n338\n00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.360\nBut I'd expect those to be exploded out.\n\n339\n00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.140\nAnd I expect the hierarchy\nto look like that.\n\n340\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:53.710\nSo my overall plan is, well,\nit's my overarching project plan.\n\n341\n00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.109\nBut underneath that project plan,\nthen, underneath each of those lines,\n\n342\n00:19:58.109 --> 00:19:59.903\nI expect to see them blown out.\n\n343\n00:19:59.903 --> 00:20:05.276\nNow, whether you're gonna use\nexactly the same tool to do that.\n\n344\n00:20:05.276 --> 00:20:06.717\nThat would be the most efficient and\n\n345\n00:20:06.717 --> 00:20:08.985\nthat's what we're talking\nabout is efficiency here.\n\n346\n00:20:08.985 --> 00:20:11.907\nThat would certainly be\nthe most efficient, but\n\n347\n00:20:11.907 --> 00:20:15.978\nthat again is something that's\nentirely up to your organization.\n\n348\n00:20:15.978 --> 00:20:18.684\nWe're not going to tell\nyou what tools to use, but\n\n349\n00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:21.338\nthat's certainly something\nthat you could do.\n\n350\n00:20:21.338 --> 00:20:26.718\nI've also seen other tools being used\nat that point in time where each\n\n351\n00:20:26.718 --> 00:20:32.350\nindividual team plan is then,\npresented and a different tool.\n\n352\n00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.930\nThere's a danger in that\nin that you update one and\n\n353\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.910\nit doesn't necessarily update the other.\n\n354\n00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:41.940\nAnd of course, again what I'd said to\nyou previously about letting the tools\n\n355\n00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.820\nactually facilitate our efficiency\nin our previous episode.\n\n356\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.975\nThat's exactly where we want to be, and\nhaving separate tools, having disparate\n\n357\n00:20:50.975 --> 00:20:56.455\ntools to mange our project planning\nis not going to promote efficiency.\n\n358\n00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:59.845\nIt's going to promote duplication\nwhich is not efficient.\n\n359\n00:20:59.845 --> 00:21:03.855\nIt's also going to promote\nerrors potentially as well.\n\n360\n00:21:03.855 --> 00:21:07.885\nThose errors being that if I've\ngot one plan that says this and\n\n361\n00:21:07.885 --> 00:21:11.975\nhas this timeline, and I've got\nanother plan that has this timeline,\n\n362\n00:21:11.975 --> 00:21:13.845\nthen how do I know which is accurate?\n\n363\n00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:21.045\nAnd so we wanna have, well, we wanna\nbe as efficient as we possibly can.\n\n364\n00:21:21.045 --> 00:21:24.020\nAnd we really wanna have just\none central repository for\n\n365\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.830\nour project planning, as much as we can.\n\n366\n00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:32.730\nAnd then that central repository\nallows us the ability to\n\n367\n00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.903\ndrill into each individual stages.\n\n368\n00:21:35.903 --> 00:21:39.034\nSo, at this point in time\nwhat we're gonna do is,\n\n369\n00:21:39.034 --> 00:21:44.346\nnow that we've taken a look at high level\nplanning, what I'm going to ask you to do.\n\n370\n00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:49.112\nIn your downloadable material,\nwe have a few slides that\n\n371\n00:21:49.112 --> 00:21:53.877\nlook at appendix D and\nappendix D is from your ITIL book and\n\n372\n00:21:53.877 --> 00:21:57.552\nI would like you to\ndownload those slides and\n\n373\n00:21:57.552 --> 00:22:03.660\njust take a look at the diagrams\nthat are contained in appendix D.\n\n374\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.510\nAnd then when we come\nback in our next episode,\n\n375\n00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:13.560\nwe're going to take a look at certain\nactivities that happen within planning.\n\n376\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.730\nSo for now, appendix d,\ntake a look at the downloadable material.\n\n377\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.090\nYou can either go to that\nappendix in your ITIL book.\n\n378\n00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.340\nSorry, in your PRINCE2 book see I've got,\nsometimes I just have ITIL on the brain.\n\n379\n00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.388\n[LAUGH] And go to the appendix\nD in your PRINCE2 book, or\n\n380\n00:22:29.388 --> 00:22:32.563\ntake a look at the downloadable material.\n\n381\n00:22:32.563 --> 00:22:37.404\nTake a look at those particular diagrams\nand then when we come back we're just\n\n382\n00:22:37.404 --> 00:22:42.243\ngonna expound on those a little bit more.\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo I've taken a quick look\n\n383\n00:22:42.243 --> 00:22:46.204\nat those myself and\nthere's still a lot to cover here.\n\n384\n00:22:46.204 --> 00:22:47.970\nSo we're gonna have to come back for\na part three.\n\n385\n00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:52.390\nAnd it seems we're just kind of zooming\nin with each subsequent part and well,\n\n386\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.340\nthere's always time to\ndigest between those.\n\n387\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.250\nSo definitely come on back but for now,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n388\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.420\nSo signing off for ITPROTV.\n\n389\n00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.000\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n390\n00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.840\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n391\n00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.534\n[MUSIC]\n\n392\n00:23:05.534 --> 00:23:10.790\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.468\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:13.113\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.816\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.615\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:20.733\nwe're continuing on with our\nPrints 2017 Foundation series.\n\n8\n00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.209\nAnd this is a part three,\nyeah, a part three,\n\n9\n00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:25.444\nthere's a lot when it comes to planning.\n\n10\n00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:28.615\nWe're continuing to talk\nabout our planning theme,\n\n11\n00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:31.175\nour plan theme, I put an ing on there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:32.075\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure Jo wouldn't like that.\n\n13\n00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.121\nAnd speaking of Jo, well she's gonna\nhelp us along in this very endeavor.\n\n14\n00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:37.217\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, thank you, Justin.\n\n15\n00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:39.298\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n16\n00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:42.924\nAnd y we've had some pretty good\nconversations in the last two episodes,\n\n17\n00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:44.750\npart one and part two of this series.\n\n18\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.951\nIf you haven't checked those out,\ndefinitely go check those out.\n\n19\n00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:50.999\nBut what else do we have to talk\nabout when it comes to plans?\n\n20\n00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:52.724\n&gt;&gt; What you said go and check these out,\n\n21\n00:00:52.724 --> 00:00:56.619\nbut to be perfectly honest, I mean let's\nface it, part three is not gonna make much\n\n22\n00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.753\nsense unlease you've already\nchecked out parts one and part two.\n\n23\n00:00:59.753 --> 00:01:03.384\nBecause in part one and part two we\nlooked at why we need to plan and\n\n24\n00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:07.237\nwhy we need documentation and\nwhy we need to have some consistency.\n\n25\n00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:11.375\nAnd in part two, we actually paid\nattention to the plans themselves.\n\n26\n00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:15.730\nSo we paid attention to the full matter\nplans and we looked at Gantt chart, and\n\n27\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.889\nwe looked at the other activities and\nteam plans, etc.\n\n28\n00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:20.709\nAnd now here in part three,\n\n29\n00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:24.679\nwe're actually going to look\nat what should be in our plan.\n\n30\n00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.489\nSo in previous episodes,\nwe looked at structure, but\n\n31\n00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:30.186\nnow we're gonna look at what\nshould be in our plans.\n\n32\n00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:31.489\nSo let's tart off then,\n\n33\n00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:35.285\nand very simply all of this is available\nin your downloadable material.\n\n34\n00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:39.845\nSo we're gonna start off with, well what's\non the screen in front of you right now.\n\n35\n00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:44.318\nWhich is the first thing that we should\ndo when we're identifying plans and when\n\n36\n00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:48.737\nwe're doing some planning is to identify\nwhat it is that we should undertake.\n\n37\n00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:53.377\nSo identify our activity and those\ndependencies, remember that Gantt chart.\n\n38\n00:01:53.377 --> 00:01:57.280\nWe had to look at it,\nback in our previous episode.\n\n39\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.269\nSo here we go, I just wanna\nbring that up on the screen, and\n\n40\n00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:04.174\nI wonder if we can just go full screen on\nthat, just so that we can get that in.\n\n41\n00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:09.041\nI know that that's very small,\nyou've seen Gantt chart previously,\n\n42\n00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:10.672\nI should hope you have.\n\n43\n00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.771\nIf you haven't then by all means,\nGoogle it.\n\n44\n00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:14.790\nAnd there's plenty of examples there.\n\n45\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.141\nAnd what I expect to see in the Gantt\nchart are these dependencies.\n\n46\n00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:21.700\nNow unfortunately,\nin this particular Gantt chart,\n\n47\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.821\nthere aren't too many dependencies there.\n\n48\n00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:28.813\nBut if dependency is where we have\nan arrow from one activity to\n\n49\n00:02:28.813 --> 00:02:30.450\nthe next activity.\n\n50\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.898\nIn other words, the second one has\nto happen after the first one.\n\n51\n00:02:35.898 --> 00:02:39.849\nSo the first one has to happen,\nwell first, it kinda makes sense really,\n\n52\n00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:40.632\ndoesn't it?\n\n53\n00:02:40.632 --> 00:02:45.203\nOkay, so these are our activities\nthat are now dependencies, and\n\n54\n00:02:45.203 --> 00:02:51.011\nit says from the product flow diagram, but\nI wanna see these in a Gantt chart format.\n\n55\n00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:55.931\nA Gantt chart format, and we discussed\nthis in our last episode, it's\n\n56\n00:02:55.931 --> 00:03:01.348\ncertainly the most effective at a glance\nview of where we are with our project.\n\n57\n00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:06.989\nAnd by the way, don't forget, and this\nlast bullet point is an important one.\n\n58\n00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.189\nDon't forget your external dependencies\nand your external suppliers as well.\n\n59\n00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.850\nSo we know that suppliers can\nbe both internal and external.\n\n60\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.479\nBut if you have external suppliers\nperforming some of those activities within\n\n61\n00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:29.377\nyour project plan, then you still need to\nfeature them in the actual plan itself.\n\n62\n00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:34.126\nThey still need to have some\nvisibility in that plan and\n\n63\n00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:39.092\nthey should also have visibility\nof the plan itself too.\n\n64\n00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:42.813\nSo don't hide other activities\nfrom your suppliers.\n\n65\n00:03:42.813 --> 00:03:47.556\nYour suppliers have probably got work\ntasks and activities to perform that\n\n66\n00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:51.783\nare dependent on some things\nhappening within your environment.\n\n67\n00:03:51.783 --> 00:03:57.797\nIn which case, then you wanna ensure that\nyour suppliers have access to this and\n\n68\n00:03:57.797 --> 00:04:01.675\nthey can actually see\nwhat's gonna happen first.\n\n69\n00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:06.094\nBy the way, do you think that suppliers\nshould be able to influence the Gantt\n\n70\n00:04:06.094 --> 00:04:09.772\ncharts and the project planning?\n&gt;&gt; So when I think of suppliers,\n\n71\n00:04:09.772 --> 00:04:13.307\nthey are providing things\nnecessary to complete the project.\n\n72\n00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:15.816\nNow what do you mean should\nthey be able to influence it?\n\n73\n00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:20.186\nLike through actual decisions,\nlike this is how it's gonna be or\n\n74\n00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:24.556\nhappenstance, what I mean is I\ncan't provide you this service or\n\n75\n00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:29.572\nthis widget in the time necessary,\nthat would influence the Gantt chart.\n\n76\n00:04:29.572 --> 00:04:33.589\nThat's not a decision they made\nnecessarily, that's just a by product.\n\n77\n00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:34.953\n&gt;&gt; Little bit of both really.\n\n78\n00:04:34.953 --> 00:04:39.429\nBecause don't forget our suppliers are not\njust external, they're also internal too.\n\n79\n00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:42.539\nSo suppliers are people\nlike our developers and\n\n80\n00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.205\nsys admins and\npeople like our infrastructure people.\n\n81\n00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:49.397\nSo therefore, would they have\ninfluence on the Gantt chart?\n\n82\n00:04:49.397 --> 00:04:51.616\nWell of course they would,\nof course they would.\n\n83\n00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:54.619\nIf I'm a project manager,\nI'm gonna come to you and\n\n84\n00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:58.867\nyou're gonna tell me how long it's\ngonna take to do something, surely.\n\n85\n00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:02.138\nSo I'm gonna probably sit down with you,\nand I'm gonna say, so\n\n86\n00:05:02.138 --> 00:05:03.410\nthis bit here, Justin,\n\n87\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.732\nthen how long is it gonna take to do it?\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n88\n00:05:05.732 --> 00:05:07.539\nwhat I do in that time-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.140\n&gt;&gt; Is I think of a number.\n\n90\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.668\nAnd then I multiply it by 3\nbefore I say it out loud.\n\n91\n00:05:11.668 --> 00:05:14.081\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:15.873\n&gt;&gt; No, time estimation is a difficult\n\n93\n00:05:15.873 --> 00:05:18.751\nthing.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n94\n00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.298\n&gt;&gt; I don't think there's any way around\n\n95\n00:05:20.298 --> 00:05:22.628\nit, there being possible\ninfluence on the Gantt chart.\n\n96\n00:05:22.628 --> 00:05:24.043\n&gt;&gt; Well look at what our next slide is.\n\n97\n00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:26.668\nI mean, I'm glad you mention that,\nbut look at our next slide.\n\n98\n00:05:26.668 --> 00:05:28.943\nOur next slide is actually\nprepare estimation.\n\n99\n00:05:28.943 --> 00:05:33.940\nNow, interestingly enough, if you take\na look at in one of our other series and\n\n100\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.105\nthis is a little bit too in depth for\nour PRINCE2 Foundation, but\n\n101\n00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:41.390\nthere's mention here of\nestimating techniques.\n\n102\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.636\nSo what you can do is take\na look at practitioner, or\n\n103\n00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.060\ntake a look at one of our agile series.\n\n104\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.698\nAnd you'll see that actually what we cover\nare some of the estimation techniques.\n\n105\n00:05:50.698 --> 00:05:54.826\nBecause you mentioned about, you'll just\nthink of a number and multiply it by 3.\n\n106\n00:05:54.826 --> 00:05:59.013\nBut actually there's a little bit more\nsophistication to that and we have\n\n107\n00:05:59.013 --> 00:06:03.621\nsomething, we have something in sort of\nproject management called ideal days.\n\n108\n00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.180\nDo you know what an ideal day is?\n&gt;&gt; An ideal day?\n\n109\n00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.331\nIs that like a day at the beach?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I thought you were going\n\n110\n00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:11.175\nto say something like that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:13.707\n&gt;&gt; No, is the answer to that.\n\n112\n00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:19.092\nAn ideal day is actually something that\nwe use in project management estimating.\n\n113\n00:06:19.092 --> 00:06:22.431\nWell, we use it in our job predominantly.\n\n114\n00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:26.988\nBut it's based on the fact that\nnot every day is an ideal day and\n\n115\n00:06:26.988 --> 00:06:29.629\nnot all of our days are an ideal day.\n\n116\n00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.742\nSo I'm gonna ask you some questions,\nJustin, so be prepared for this one.\n\n117\n00:06:33.742 --> 00:06:36.146\nOkay, so\nwhat time did you get in this morning?\n\n118\n00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:36.688\n&gt;&gt; Well, this morning,\n\n119\n00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.581\nin paticular, I got in here about 9:30.\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n120\n00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:40.384\n&gt;&gt; Normally, I get in here-\n\n121\n00:06:40.384 --> 00:06:41.574\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n122\n00:06:41.574 --> 00:06:43.010\n&gt;&gt; 15 to 8 to 8 o'clock.\n\n123\n00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.574\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n124\n00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:46.740\nlet's say 8 AM and what time to do leave?\n&gt;&gt; 5 PM.\n\n125\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.333\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so 17:00,\n\n126\n00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:49.256\nall right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n127\n00:06:49.256 --> 00:06:49.977\n&gt;&gt; Le't stick with 24 hours.\n\n128\n00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.039\n&gt;&gt; All right, sorry, just,\n\n129\n00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.379\nculturally that's-\n&gt;&gt; I know, but\n\n130\n00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.238\nit's just easier to work with.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n131\n00:06:54.238 --> 00:06:54.957\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n132\n00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:56.238\nSo how many hours is that?\n\n133\n00:06:56.238 --> 00:06:57.795\n9 hours.\n&gt;&gt; 9.\n\n134\n00:06:57.795 --> 00:06:59.134\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\n\n135\n00:06:59.134 --> 00:07:03.069\nhow long of a lunch break do you take?\n&gt;&gt; An hour.\n\n136\n00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:06.649\n&gt;&gt; An hour, so that's an 8 hour day.\n\n137\n00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:11.931\nHow many hours are you in the studio?\n&gt;&gt; Am I with you or not?\n\n138\n00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:17.394\nIf I'm with you, we're in here\nabout 6 hours out of the dayish.\n\n139\n00:07:17.394 --> 00:07:18.271\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\n\n140\n00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.771\nwe're in here about 6\nhours out of the day.\n\n141\n00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:24.955\nSo for those 6 hours, are we productive?\n&gt;&gt; I would like to think so,\n\n142\n00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:27.763\nI feel like this is recorded\nevidence about my work habits.\n\n143\n00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:28.326\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:07:28.326 --> 00:07:31.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm getting a little shaky on\n\n145\n00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:32.145\nthis one.\n\n146\n00:07:32.145 --> 00:07:35.265\nI would say yes, we are productive,\neven if we aren't actively recording,\n\n147\n00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:36.327\nwe are being productive.\n\n148\n00:07:36.327 --> 00:07:39.354\nHowever in all actually, there's time for\nsetup between episodes and\n\n149\n00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:42.901\nthings like that.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so the reality of\n\n150\n00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:48.470\nthe situation is that after a 9 hour day,\nyou and I, between us,\n\n151\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:54.063\nwill probably manage to produce\nmaybe 4 hours worth of content.\n\n152\n00:07:54.063 --> 00:07:56.369\nBut that's out of two 9 hour days.\n\n153\n00:07:56.369 --> 00:08:02.641\nSo out of 18 hours, we probably manage\nto produce four hours worth of content.\n\n154\n00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:07.590\nSo our ideal day, then,\nwell, is two hours each.\n\n155\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.150\nThat's an ideal day.\n\n156\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.202\nSo that's how much productivity we manage.\n\n157\n00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:15.920\n[LAUGH] When you put it like that,\nit doesn't sound very much, does it?\n\n158\n00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.060\nAnd that's how much\nproductivity we manage.\n\n159\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:25.270\nJo, I feel like we need to come back and\ndub over and change that, like censorship.\n\n160\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.928\nYou're like it's four hours but\nreally, it's seven hours.\n\n161\n00:08:28.928 --> 00:08:30.733\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n162\n00:08:30.733 --> 00:08:31.516\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if somebody goes and\n\n163\n00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:34.063\nwatch, they're like, hey, they don't\ndo anything but there's actually\n\n164\n00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:35.721\na lot that goes on behind the scenes.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n165\n00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:39.703\nthere's a lot that goes on behind the\nscenes and there's a lot of attitude and\n\n166\n00:08:39.703 --> 00:08:42.457\nthere's a lot of sort of setting up and\nthen, I mean,\n\n167\n00:08:42.457 --> 00:08:46.460\nthat's not including our preparation\nweeks or our preparation time, etc.\n\n168\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.770\nI mean, this is just is we\nwere recorded all day long and\n\n169\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.430\nwe would be in the studio.\n\n170\n00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.120\nBut then I'm looking at in terms\nof output because you see and\n\n171\n00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.510\nthis is one of the big misconceptions when\nit comes to project management is that,\n\n172\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.240\nwell, we assume that if somebody\nis onsite for say eight hours,\n\n173\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.690\nlet's give them an hours worth of\nlunch break, if someone's on site for\n\n174\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.320\neight hours, are they gonna be\nproductive for those eight hours?\n\n175\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.110\nBut you know what?\n\n176\n00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.610\nThey are not.\n\n177\n00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.740\nWe're not doing this,\nwe are not calculating or\n\n178\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.920\nestimating ideal days to give us well,\nammunition as it were,\n\n179\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.020\nthat might happen later on,\nactually, when we leave the studio.\n\n180\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.690\nThis is not about ammunition.\n\n181\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.410\nThis is about effective\nproject management.\n\n182\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:33.960\nIt's about effective estimating,\nwhich is what we're trying to do,\n\n183\n00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.710\nis to effectively estimate how\nmany hours it's going to take or\n\n184\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.670\nhow many days it's going to complete,\nright, let me put my teeth in, shall I?\n\n185\n00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.050\nHow many days it's going to take to\ncomplete a particular activity, so,\n\n186\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.970\nin order to do that,\nwe've got to understand how or\n\n187\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:57.460\nwhat proportion of that day\nis going to be productive.\n\n188\n00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.980\nSo, that's what we call estimating and\nthat's just one way of estimating,\n\n189\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.150\nthere a lot of other ways but\nI'm just giving you an example here.\n\n190\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.680\nSo, when it comes up,\nif we can go back to that slide again,\n\n191\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.920\nwhen it comes up with the prepare\nestimates and basic rules for estimating.\n\n192\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.320\nWhat we're doing here in this planning\nstage is we are defining what rules\n\n193\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.910\nwe're going to use for estimating and what\ntypes of estimating we're going to use.\n\n194\n00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:28.710\nBut essentially, no matter what method\nwe use for estimating, it's still pretty\n\n195\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.700\nmuch the same principle is that we have\ngot to work out what the ideal days are.\n\n196\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.760\nWe've got to work out with just\nexactly how productive we are and\n\n197\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.940\nthen how long it's going to take anybody\nto perform a particular activity.\n\n198\n00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.922\nAnd then and only then,\ncan we then prepare the schedule.\n\n199\n00:10:46.922 --> 00:10:50.900\nOnce we've understood what\nactivities are required and\n\n200\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.450\nhow long those activities\nare going to take.\n\n201\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.100\nAnd that's when we prepare the schedule\nand that's when we assign resources.\n\n202\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.870\nI just want to say something about that.\n\n203\n00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.249\nI'm going to, I don't know,\nshould I ask you?\n\n204\n00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:07.534\nDo you think you're more\nproductive than I am?\n\n205\n00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:11.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is like a Catch 22 for me.\n\n206\n00:11:11.745 --> 00:11:15.405\nIf I say I am more productive,\nthen you're like, really?\n\n207\n00:11:15.405 --> 00:11:19.115\nIf I say I'm not, then they're like,\nJustin is a slacker.\n\n208\n00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:20.330\nI plead the fifth.\n\n209\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.580\nThat's all I gotta say but.\n&gt;&gt; I have no clue what that means\n\n210\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.160\nby the way but anyway.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n211\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:31.390\nThat means that I reserved the right\nnot to incriminate myself [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.050\n&gt;&gt; Guilty as charged then, right?\n\n213\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.940\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; But before we go any further,\n\n214\n00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.540\nI just think about estimations.\n\n215\n00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:42.290\nWe would more than likely get better\nat estimating time as we complete more\n\n216\n00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.340\nprojects and gather data about it,\nlike respect, within a grand scope,\n\n217\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.450\nwe can't get super fine grain but is that\na general consensus, like if you were\n\n218\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.860\nbrand new to, let's say you to starting at\nthe company, your estimation is gonna be\n\n219\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.770\nwidely varied, right?\n&gt;&gt; It's not just about as we complete more\n\n220\n00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.630\nproject but actually,\nas we get further into a project.\n\n221\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.670\nYou see, if I am working with you,\nlet's be honest about this one, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.200\nLet's be completely honest,\nif I am working with you,\n\n223\n00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.970\nthen we achieve a certain amount\nof productivity per day but\n\n224\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.210\nlet's just say that I'm working with Rony,\n\n225\n00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.955\nfor instance, then I achieve\na different productivity rate.\n\n226\n00:12:22.955 --> 00:12:25.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think he's laughing now but\n\n227\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.591\nthis is true.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n228\n00:12:27.591 --> 00:12:28.890\n&gt;&gt; I like how you chose the word\n\n229\n00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.270\ndifferent.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, slightly different.\n\n230\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.750\n&gt;&gt; We don't wanna crush Justine here\n\n231\n00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.255\nin this episode.\n\n232\n00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:38.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What this really means is the fact that\n\n233\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.630\ndifferent teams work differently together.\n\n234\n00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.370\nAnd so, if you have certain\npeople working together,\n\n235\n00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.150\nthere might be certain people that\nyou can't really put together.\n\n236\n00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.965\nBecause you don't, well, you know, their\nproductivity is not gonna be so great.\n\n237\n00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:54.170\nBut if there are any clashes for instance,\n\n238\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.070\nthen there are people that\nmaybe you can't put together.\n\n239\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:01.060\nBut there may be certain people that\nwork really, really well together.\n\n240\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.156\nAnd you might have to do\nsomething with team dynamics.\n\n241\n00:13:04.156 --> 00:13:07.396\nSo, it's not just as you do more and\nmore projects but\n\n242\n00:13:07.396 --> 00:13:12.148\nit's as each individual project\nprogresses, then you might find that yeah,\n\n243\n00:13:12.148 --> 00:13:14.524\nwe can get better with our estimation.\n\n244\n00:13:14.524 --> 00:13:19.266\nBear it in mind that we're managing\nin stages, we're managing in byte\n\n245\n00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:23.612\nsize chunks, so, you'll find\nthat as the project progresses,\n\n246\n00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:27.978\nthen your estimation becomes better and\nbecomes more accurate.\n\n247\n00:13:27.978 --> 00:13:32.446\nAnd also, we can then use that for lessons\nlearned and that lesson was learnt could\n\n248\n00:13:32.446 --> 00:13:36.560\nbe for a future stage but it could\nalso be for a future project as well.\n\n249\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.790\nSo what you've said is right.\n\n250\n00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.560\nBut you can also apply that\nto the actual project too.\n\n251\n00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.360\nSo let's go back to the schedule and\nwhat else should be on the schedule then?\n\n252\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.620\nSo, milestones, in other words,\nplanning out what our stages are?\n\n253\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.800\nWhere are stages are going to be?\n\n254\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.720\nAnd what our milestones are?\n\n255\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.680\nAnd we should see that on\nour project Gantt chart.\n\n256\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.930\nSo let me go back to our\nproject Gantt chart again.\n\n257\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.180\nIf I can navigate here and\nyou see your Gantt chart there.\n\n258\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.500\nAnd so we have certain milestones and\n\n259\n00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.300\na milestone is when\nsomething has been achieved.\n\n260\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:15.050\nSo there may be milestones at the end of\nstage two in that particular example and\n\n261\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:20.105\nthen again, at the end of stage\nthree in that example there.\n\n262\n00:14:20.105 --> 00:14:24.580\nAnd what else have we got then,\ncalculating resources and costs.\n\n263\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.510\nResources does not necessarily\njust mean the people.\n\n264\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:31.497\nIt can also mean the money and\nthe software, hardware, etc,\n\n265\n00:14:31.497 --> 00:14:35.804\nthat they need in order to be able\nto complete various activities.\n\n266\n00:14:37.064 --> 00:14:41.384\nNow we have got another thing on risk and\nwe're going to look at that in,\n\n267\n00:14:41.384 --> 00:14:43.480\nactually, in the next episode.\n\n268\n00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:49.110\nBut part of planning any project\nis going to be analyzing the risk.\n\n269\n00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.890\nSo, making sure that we have activities\nthat allow us to analyze the risk for\n\n270\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:54.840\nthat project.\n\n271\n00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:02.320\nSo not only do we analyze the risks for\nproject management.\n\n272\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.730\nBut we analyze the risk\nbefore we start a project and\n\n273\n00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.320\nalso during the project\nwe'll do risk management.\n\n274\n00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.860\nAnd I'm not gonna spend too much time\nlooking at this because we're gonna look\n\n275\n00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.160\nat this in our next episode.\n\n276\n00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.410\nAnd we're also going to look at risk\nmanagement as we go through all of\n\n277\n00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:24.850\nour themes that are processes\nwithin the project itself.\n\n278\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:30.600\nSo, in subsequent episodes,\nwe're gonna spend more time on this but\n\n279\n00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.210\none thing I do want to point out is\nthat third bullet point down there that\n\n280\n00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:39.620\nit's still a draft until we have\nidentified all of our risks.\n\n281\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.220\nWell, of the risks that\nwere evident at the point\n\n282\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.390\nin time where we completed the plan.\n\n283\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.250\nIt's really important that\nwe perform risk management.\n\n284\n00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:52.355\nWhen I asked to see a risk register for\na particular project plan and\n\n285\n00:15:52.355 --> 00:15:54.124\nit's blank, it's empty.\n\n286\n00:15:54.124 --> 00:15:57.616\nAnd then that tells me we haven't\nbeen doing effective planning at all\n\n287\n00:15:57.616 --> 00:16:00.516\nbecause I'll guarantee that\nsomething is gonna happen,\n\n288\n00:16:00.516 --> 00:16:04.306\nsomething that will need mitigation or\nsomething that will need some sort of\n\n289\n00:16:04.306 --> 00:16:07.992\nimmediate action That should have been\npicked up right at the very start.\n\n290\n00:16:07.992 --> 00:16:10.430\nAnd we talk about SMART planning.\n\n291\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:14.880\nAnd of course SMART means specific,\nand measurable, and achievable, and\n\n292\n00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.430\nrealistic, and timely or timebound.\n\n293\n00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:23.590\nAnd we use that term with objectives, but\nwe also use that with planning as well.\n\n294\n00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.780\nYou know what?\n\n295\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.600\nBe realistic with your planning, but\nbe very smart with your planning.\n\n296\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.030\nAnd if you plan your chunks in manageable,\nbite-size pieces,\n\n297\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.970\nthen you will actually see that you will\nget more achieved rather than trying to do\n\n298\n00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.520\neverything all at the same time.\n\n299\n00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:45.270\nAnd then, of course with any plan, we\nknow that we've got to document the plan.\n\n300\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.809\nSo I know that you've already seen\nthis particular diagram before.\n\n301\n00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:52.880\nAt least you've seen\nthis Gantt chart before.\n\n302\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.110\nOne thing that I want to draw\nto your attention, really is,\n\n303\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.230\nthe fact that we've got\nan executive summary here.\n\n304\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.530\nThat there's a hard or soft copy.\n\n305\n00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.690\nAnd that it's subject to version control.\n\n306\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.350\nDo you think, you know,\nI'm gonna ask you a question.\n\n307\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.640\nDo you really think that there is only\ngonna be one version of this Gant chart?\n\n308\n00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.520\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not,\n\n309\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.640\nand I'm a bit proponent of I try to do\neverything I do in a version-controlled\n\n310\n00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.630\nsystem, even if it's just for me.\n\n311\n00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:23.360\nSo, I'm a full proponent of versioning so\nI can go, what was this, what was that.\n\n312\n00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.750\nAnd it just keeps things nice.\n&gt;&gt; But well, certainly with this,\n\n313\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.140\nat the end of every stage,\nthis is going to be updated.\n\n314\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.520\nNow, we do not want to update\nthis on an ad-hoc basis.\n\n315\n00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.225\nWe don't want to be updating\nit every single day\n\n316\n00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:42.935\nunless we're updating it to say that yes,\nwe've completed a specific task.\n\n317\n00:17:42.935 --> 00:17:45.835\nWe certainly don't want to\nbe reordering tasks and\n\n318\n00:17:45.835 --> 00:17:50.175\nmaking changes other than to say yes,\nsomething has been completed.\n\n319\n00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:53.985\nThat happens at the end-of-stage reviews.\n\n320\n00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:57.600\nAnd so\nthat's when we would do those updates.\n\n321\n00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.450\nNow, it mentions executive summary and\nhard or soft copy.\n\n322\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.030\nAnd in a previous episode, you mentioned,\nJustin, about zooming in on this, and\n\n323\n00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:10.760\nabout actually having sort of plans for\neach team level and for each stage.\n\n324\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.190\nBut what we've got right in front of us\nhere is just that, sort of, that one page,\n\n325\n00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.680\nthat executive view.\n\n326\n00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.760\nNow, it says hard or soft copy, but\n\n327\n00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.860\nI don't know whether you've ever\ntried to print out a Gantt chart?\n\n328\n00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.152\nHave you tried to print out a Gantt chart?\n&gt;&gt; Every time I've tried to print out\n\n329\n00:18:27.152 --> 00:18:28.703\na chart of any type, I'm like,\n\n330\n00:18:28.703 --> 00:18:30.195\nwhere does this page go?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n331\n00:18:30.195 --> 00:18:32.916\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like my printer goes, well,\n\n332\n00:18:32.916 --> 00:18:35.000\nI printed it over 12 pages.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n333\n00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.860\n&gt;&gt; Well what?\n\n334\n00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.140\nAnd four of them are blank.\n\n335\n00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n336\n00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.140\n&gt;&gt; And there's no numbers on\n\n337\n00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:39.890\nthem.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n338\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.834\n&gt;&gt; And there's no numbering scheme, yeah,\n\n339\n00:18:41.834 --> 00:18:43.628\nso.\n&gt;&gt; It's a bit like trying to put a jigsaw\n\n340\n00:18:43.628 --> 00:18:44.320\ntogether.\n\n341\n00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.710\nAnd so if you are going to\nprint your Gantt chart,\n\n342\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.990\nI would ask you to think twice\nbefore you print it as a hard copy.\n\n343\n00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:58.280\nIt's gonna have to be so high level\nas a hard copy that it's going to be\n\n344\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.340\npretty, well, unreadable to be fair.\n\n345\n00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.610\nIf it's not really, really high level,\n\n346\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.470\nthen you're gonna get exactly\nwhat Justin just described.\n\n347\n00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.430\nYou print out a project Gantt chart,\nyou're gonna get 12,\n\n348\n00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:14.250\n15 pages, and you're going to have quite\na few of them that are gonna be blank.\n\n349\n00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.200\nAnd you're going to have to try and\npiece it all together.\n\n350\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.600\nAnd even then, by the time you're finished\nwith the tape and the staples and\n\n351\n00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.760\neverything else, you're still not\nreally going to be any better off.\n\n352\n00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.130\nSo it says hard or soft copy,\nbut to be perfectly honest,\n\n353\n00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.530\nyou're better off with a soft copy.\n\n354\n00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.410\nYou're better off with it online.\n\n355\n00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.590\nWhat about our minimum requirements,\nthen, for our planning?\n\n356\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:43.210\nIt mentions here that the project plan\nhas got to enable the business case.\n\n357\n00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.580\nIn other words, we've got to justify.\n\n358\n00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.960\nIf you remember, in our business case,\nwhen we looked at this,\n\n359\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.820\nthis was our first thing.\n\n360\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.530\nAnd we have to justify\nin our business case\n\n361\n00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.730\nwhy the business wants\nthis particular product.\n\n362\n00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.540\nAnd we also have to justify how\nmuch the project is gonna cost, and\n\n363\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.630\nhow long it's going to run for.\n\n364\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:08.280\nSo the plan that we have has got to\nmeet the needs of the business case.\n\n365\n00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.860\nSo it's got to enable the business\ncase to be, well, to be,\n\n366\n00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.140\nI was gonna say to come to fruition,\nreally.\n\n367\n00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.360\nWe've got to enable us to turn\nthe business case into a reality.\n\n368\n00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.942\nThe business case has got requirements.\n\n369\n00:20:22.942 --> 00:20:27.778\nAnd the plan has got to demonstrate how\nwe're going to turn those requirements\n\n370\n00:20:27.778 --> 00:20:28.810\ninto a reality.\n\n371\n00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.515\nWe have to have a minimum of two stages,\nand we know that.\n\n372\n00:20:32.515 --> 00:20:35.356\nWe've looked at that in\na previous episode as well,\n\n373\n00:20:35.356 --> 00:20:37.820\nbecause we have to have\nan initiation stage.\n\n374\n00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.960\nAnd we have to have at least one other\nstage, such as the closing stage and\n\n375\n00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.630\nthen maybe many stages in between as well.\n\n376\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.200\nAnd so, other things that\nwe should have in our plan,\n\n377\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.430\nwe already spoke about roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n378\n00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.890\nAnd we've already looked at\nthe levels of planning as well, and\n\n379\n00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:59.120\nwe've looked at exception plans too,\nin the previous episode.\n\n380\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:04.750\nOne thing I will say, is that when we\nare doing planning, just a reiteration.\n\n381\n00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.670\nThink about your lessons\nlearned from other projects,\n\n382\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.710\nand maybe from previous\nstages in this project.\n\n383\n00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.585\nAnd remember, as we've just talked about,\n\n384\n00:21:13.585 --> 00:21:17.379\nwe want to review our project\nplan at the end of every stage.\n\n385\n00:21:17.379 --> 00:21:22.121\nJust to see, sort of where we've got to\nand whether there are any exception plans,\n\n386\n00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:25.330\nand then what changes we need to make for\nthe next stage.\n\n387\n00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.710\nSo when we are thinking about planning,\n\n388\n00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:32.430\nthink about what approach we're\ngoing to use to planning.\n\n389\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.153\nIn other words,\nare we using an agile-based approach?\n\n390\n00:21:35.153 --> 00:21:39.250\nAre we conducting our project\nin a waterfall approach?\n\n391\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.210\nHow are we going to plan our stages?\n\n392\n00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.034\nWhat length should our stages be?\n\n393\n00:21:45.034 --> 00:21:47.020\nWhat about our resource planning?\n\n394\n00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.620\nAnd what are we going\nto do with exceptions?\n\n395\n00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.930\nAnd all of these need to be\nconsidered in our planning.\n\n396\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.460\nAnd then, of course, at the bottom\nthere it mentions again estimation and\n\n397\n00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.440\nscheduling.\n\n398\n00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.100\nOne thing that we haven't talked about so\nfar.\n\n399\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.890\nAnd I just want to touch on this, and\nthis is the thought that I'm gonna leave\n\n400\n00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.670\nyou with for this particular episode,\nand that is prioritization.\n\n401\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.620\nQuite often,\nwhen we're planning our projects,\n\n402\n00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.303\nwe plan our activities\nin a sequential basis.\n\n403\n00:22:15.303 --> 00:22:18.867\nBecause we understand what's required,\n\n404\n00:22:18.867 --> 00:22:22.880\nwhat our prerequisites are for\nour next step.\n\n405\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.270\nAnd then, those are prerequisites for\nour next activity,\n\n406\n00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.540\nand those become the prerequisites for\nour next activity.\n\n407\n00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.330\nSo quite often,\nwe don't think about prioritization,\n\n408\n00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.250\nbecause they are sequential.\n\n409\n00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:39.932\nBut nevertheless, in a lot of projects,\nespecially the large-scale projects,\n\n410\n00:22:39.932 --> 00:22:44.210\nyou may be delivering\nfunctionality in certain blocks.\n\n411\n00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.030\nSo we might deliver this\nparticular functionality, and\n\n412\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.140\nwe might have this functionality\nas well that's required.\n\n413\n00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.060\nThink about Microsoft Outlook,\nit's a perfect example.\n\n414\n00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.270\nWhat is the priority?\n\n415\n00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.500\nIs the priority to send and\nreceive email, or is the priority for\n\n416\n00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.320\nour business to have a shared calendar?\n\n417\n00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.890\nThink about which is the priority, and\nthat's the functionality that we want to\n\n418\n00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.900\nwork on first,\nunless you've got any prerequisites.\n\n419\n00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.300\nIf we've got prerequisites and\ndependencies, then obviously,\n\n420\n00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.350\nthat's gonna drive your prioritization and\npotentially drive your planning as well.\n\n421\n00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.660\nSo, in terms of, sort of our foundation\nlevel here, we are at PRINCE2.\n\n422\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.330\nAnd then,\nwe have now finished our planning or\n\n423\n00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:33.560\nplan theme for PRINCE2 Foundation,\nas I've already said.\n\n424\n00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.490\nSo in our next episode, we're gonna ask\nyou to come back, and we're gonna be\n\n425\n00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:42.020\nlooking at the PRINCE2 theme of risk.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo,\n\n426\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.380\nI will tell you,\nthere have been discussions that you and\n\n427\n00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.530\nI have had where I've misused\nterminology on risk, so.\n\n428\n00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.140\nThat one should definitely be\nan interesting show, so I would definitely\n\n429\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.390\ncome on back, but for now, we're going\nto go ahead and get out of here.\n\n430\n00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.350\nSigning off for IT Pro TV I'm your host,\nJustin Dennison.\n\n431\n00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.016\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n432\n00:23:56.016 --> 00:23:58.310\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n433\n00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:04.407\n[MUSIC]\n\n434\n00:24:04.407 --> 00:24:07.351\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.250\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and we're\ncontinuing on with Prince2 2017 foundation\n\n7\n00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.880\nseries and in this episode we're going\nto be looking at the risk theme.\n\n8\n00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.170\nAnd here to help us along and well,\nto make sure we don't get in any\n\n9\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.370\nrisky business, is the one and\nonly Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.693\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Justin.\n\n11\n00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:34.680\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.440\nProbably need to slow down that,\nhow are you doing today, Jo,\n\n13\n00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.510\ncause that just kind of ran\ntogether in that previous one.\n\n14\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.795\nBut we've been talking\nabout Prince2 themes.\n\n15\n00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:48.650\nWe talked about the plan, the,\nwait a minute, I totally forgot.\n\n16\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.350\nWhat was the one before that?\n\n17\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.370\nOrganization.\n\n18\n00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.070\nThere we go.\n\n19\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.970\nBut now we're onto risk.\n\n20\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.699\nWhat do we need to know about risk?\n\n21\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.890\nWhat don't you need to know about risk?\n\n22\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.279\nI mean, you mentioned just a little while\nago about slowing down on our intro,\n\n23\n00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:10.800\nwell i mean, you know that's a risk and\nthat's a risk, it's a threat that maybe\n\n24\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.856\nour director couldn't get all of our\ntitles in at the bottom there in time\n\n25\n00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:18.548\nbecause you were talking too fast.\n&gt;&gt; It was just on that one transition.\n\n26\n00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:20.150\nThe rest of it it's fine.\n\n27\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.280\nIt's the, how are you doing today that for\nsome reason I feel compelled to say\n\n28\n00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.110\nit 700 miles an hour.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And you know why?\n\n29\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.707\nThat's because he really doesn't care,\nhe's not interested in the answer.\n\n30\n00:01:33.707 --> 00:01:36.027\nThat's what it is, and I'm hurt.\n&gt;&gt; I do,\n\n31\n00:01:36.027 --> 00:01:40.325\nyou'll know if I'm not interested in\nthe answer, I'm like, how you doing, Jo?\n\n32\n00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:42.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.950\n&gt;&gt; It'll just be me, kind of.\n\n34\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.750\n&gt;&gt; I don't know whether I should\n\n35\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.000\nbe flattered at this point in time or not,\nbut I'm gonna start talking about risk.\n\n36\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.140\nWhat do you think a risk is?\n&gt;&gt; Something that can have\n\n37\n00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.260\nimpact on a particular\nevent in a negative manner.\n\n38\n00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.870\nOkay, let's take a look at the screen\nthat is in front of us because this is\n\n39\n00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.850\nthe Prince2 definition of a risk.\n\n40\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.200\nA risk is an uncertain event that's going\nto have an effect on the achievement.\n\n41\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.950\nNow you said something about an event\nthat something that could happen,\n\n42\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.960\nthat would have a negative effect.\n\n43\n00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.420\nBut look at what it says there.\n\n44\n00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.360\nThere are two types of risk or\nrather there's one type of risk but\n\n45\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.270\nit can be divided into two.\n\n46\n00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.350\nAnd we've got negative threats and\nwe've got opportunities.\n\n47\n00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.630\nHe's thinking, this is why I\npause here because he's thinking.\n\n48\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.390\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, I will say for the most part\n\n49\n00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.090\nwhen I'm speaking to other individuals,\nwhen I hear a risk or, and I could be\n\n50\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.470\nwrong when I say risk to other people,\nwe tend to think it's a negative thing.\n\n51\n00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.250\nWe don't say I'm risking things\nwill just go really well for me.\n\n52\n00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.640\nIt's usually thought of\nin a negative manner.\n\n53\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I'm risking that things could\n\n54\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.430\ngo really right.\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever had anything happen to\n\n55\n00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.830\nyou, I mean, I know what happened,\nactually, [LAUGH] but have you ever had\n\n56\n00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.370\nanything happen to you that's gone so\nwell that you said to yourself, well,\n\n57\n00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.970\nI wasn't expecting that, that's great.\n&gt;&gt; Jo, I really know you want me to say\n\n58\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.030\nyes, I have, but\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.028\n&gt;&gt; But I can't think of anything.\n\n60\n00:03:21.028 --> 00:03:22.712\n&gt;&gt; But I, in the grand scheme I can fathom\n\n61\n00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:23.880\nthe possibility of that.\n\n62\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.350\nI have seen that happen to other people.\n\n63\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.540\nIt just hasn't happened to me personally.\n&gt;&gt; No, quite often I think to myself,\n\n64\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.672\nyou know what that was a bonus.\n\n65\n00:03:30.672 --> 00:03:33.700\nYeah, there's a risk that\nsomething good can happen\n\n66\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.730\nas well as a risk that\nsomething bad can happen.\n\n67\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.020\nSo we've gotta stop thinking\nabout just the bad.\n\n68\n00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.820\nAnd this is important in project\nmanagement because we've gotta be able to\n\n69\n00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.250\nidentify risks and we've gotta be able to\nidentify both positive and negative risks.\n\n70\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.010\nYes, we always think about negative risks,\nwhat could go wrong?\n\n71\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.590\nBut what could go really well?\n\n72\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.300\nLet's take a look here.\n\n73\n00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.860\nWell, this is what we've got to\n\n74\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.250\nmanage when we're looking at our risk\ntheme, this is what we've got to manage.\n\n75\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.890\nThe first thing that we'll have to\ndo is in that top right hand corner,\n\n76\n00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.320\nwe've got to define what a risk is.\n\n77\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.410\nNow we've already looked\nat that definition,\n\n78\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.790\nit's something that's unexpected.\n\n79\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.000\nThat's a word, isn't it.\n\n80\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.768\nIt's something that's unexpected,\nthat could happen,\n\n81\n00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:31.002\nthat could either prove a threat or\nit could prove an opportunity.\n\n82\n00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:34.616\nI have an issue with the word, unexpected.\n\n83\n00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:37.766\nAnd do you know why I have an issue\nwith the word, unexpected?\n\n84\n00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:39.519\n&gt;&gt; But, how do you plan for\n\n85\n00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:41.730\nsomething unexpected?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n86\n00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.124\n&gt;&gt; It's totally just [NOISE].\n\n87\n00:04:44.124 --> 00:04:45.334\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because what we're talking about\n\n88\n00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:46.700\nhere is,\nwe are talking about the risk theme.\n\n89\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.230\nAnd we're talking about risk management.\n\n90\n00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.540\nAnd as we start going through our\nprocesses within project management and\n\n91\n00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.840\nwithin Prince2, you'lll see that\nwe are trying to account for\n\n92\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.470\nrisks in all of our processes, too.\n\n93\n00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.660\nWell, if a risk is something unexpected,\nthen how do we account for it?\n\n94\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.200\nAnd there in lies the dilemma.\n\n95\n00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.590\nWe’ve got to do risk management but first\nof all we’ve got to outline what our risks\n\n96\n00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.270\npotentially are, but\nthere is another word there, potentially.\n\n97\n00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.960\nA risk is something that’s unexpected and\na risk is something that could happen.\n\n98\n00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.830\nSo we're dealing with a lot of unknowns,\nwith risk management.\n\n99\n00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.690\nBut the trick is,\nnot just to bury your head in the sand and\n\n100\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.580\npretend that nothing's gonna happen and\n\n101\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.720\nthat everything's gonna go perfectly well,\na-okay.\n\n102\n00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.160\nEverything's gonna be delivered on time,\non budget,\n\n103\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160\nand everything exactly\nas the customer asked.\n\n104\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.690\nAnd when was the last\ntime that happened for\n\n105\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.930\nyou?\n&gt;&gt; Anytime someone says that to me,\n\n106\n00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.190\nI go, you're deluded.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.090\n&gt;&gt; I don't think that's ever\n\n108\n00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.990\nhappened for me.\n\n109\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.070\nOne of those things have gone on.\n\n110\n00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.720\nEither we spend a little too much money or\n\n111\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.200\nit took a little more\ntime than we thought.\n\n112\n00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.050\nHey, you know what?\nThis doesn't actually work 100% that\n\n113\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.020\nwe thought it was going to.\n\n114\n00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.990\nSo, I would say that has\nalso not happened for me.\n\n115\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n116\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.560\nwhen it comes to project management,\n\n117\n00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.810\nmost people do expect that projects\nare never going to go according to plan.\n\n118\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.190\nThey'll expect, and in fact,\nmost developers now, they're like you.\n\n119\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.780\nYou're not unusual.\n\n120\n00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.400\nMost developers will say, yeah, okay,\nwell that's not going to happen or\n\n121\n00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.190\nit's never going to come in on time or\nit's never going to come in on budget.\n\n122\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.279\nWith good risk management and\nwith good planning, then it will.\n\n123\n00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.630\nBut that goes back to what we were\nsaying in the previous episode,\n\n124\n00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.890\nabout the fact that you know what?\n\n125\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.760\nYou do need documentation and\nif we didn't have planning and\n\n126\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.190\nwe didn't have documentation, then, and\nwe didn't have the right organization and\n\n127\n00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.220\nthe right processes, then yeah,\neverything's going to be ad hoc.\n\n128\n00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.560\nEverything is going to be chaos.\n\n129\n00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.720\nAnd guess what?\n\n130\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.030\nNothing's gonna come in on time and\nnothing's gonna come in on budget.\n\n131\n00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.540\nHowever, if we have the right\namount of planning and\n\n132\n00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.650\nwe're able to identify any potential\nrisks, then there's a good chance\n\n133\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.510\nthat our project's actually gonna\nhappen the way we expect it to happen.\n\n134\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.040\nAnd that in itself will minimize\nthe likelihood of a risk.\n\n135\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.640\nYou see, going back to this slide here,\n\n136\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.740\nwhat we'll do is we will look for\nand identify, and\n\n137\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.370\nthen we will document, and we talk about\ndocumentation again, the risk procedure.\n\n138\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.938\nAnd you'll see that,\nover on the right-hand side,\n\n139\n00:07:27.938 --> 00:07:29.724\nwe've now got to identify the risk.\n\n140\n00:07:29.724 --> 00:07:30.440\nWe've got to assess the risk.\n\n141\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.050\nWe've got to evaluate it,\nand then estimate it.\n\n142\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.412\nWe've got to plan what we're\ngoing to do with the risk, and\n\n143\n00:07:38.412 --> 00:07:40.910\nthen implement those plans.\n\n144\n00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.680\nAnd then,\nwe've got to communicate that risk.\n\n145\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.727\nSo what we have to have is not just\nan approach to risk management,\n\n146\n00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:52.581\nbut we also have to have\na documented risk register.\n\n147\n00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:54.516\nAnd then, on that left-hand side there,\n\n148\n00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.683\nyou see that we've now\ngot responsibilities.\n\n149\n00:07:56.683 --> 00:07:59.061\nSomebody's gotta take\nownership of the risk..\n\n150\n00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:02.072\nAnd somebody's actually got\nto do the risk management.\n\n151\n00:08:02.072 --> 00:08:07.460\nSo somebody has to, well, perform all\nof those tasks on the right-hand side.\n\n152\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.320\nIncluding somebody having to define the\napproach and define the risk register and\n\n153\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.320\nthen manage the risks,\nright the way throughout the project.\n\n154\n00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.580\nRisk management is a huge,\nbig responsibility in any project.\n\n155\n00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:27.230\nWe have to be able to identify risks and\nwe have to be able to manage risks.\n\n156\n00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.550\nIt's not just the case of writing\nsomething down and telling,\n\n157\n00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.110\nwell that could happen and\nleave it at that.\n\n158\n00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.530\nI want to see well that could happen,\nand what you're gonna do about it?\n\n159\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.280\nWhat are you gonna do to\nprevent it happening or\n\n160\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.140\nwhat are you going to do if it\ndoes happen to accommodate it?\n\n161\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.970\nHm, there two different responses there,\nand\n\n162\n00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.260\nthey were both what we call responses,\nthese are risk responses.\n\n163\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.300\nSo this purpose of risk then is to\nsimply identify it, to assess it,\n\n164\n00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.578\ncontrol it and then approve, improve\nthe ability of the project to succeed.\n\n165\n00:09:03.578 --> 00:09:07.500\nIdentify it, assess it, control it, and\n\n166\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.040\nimprove the ability of\nthe project to succeed.\n\n167\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.540\nSo we've already looked\nat the definition then,\n\n168\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.060\nand I'm gonna give you just\na very very quick recap again.\n\n169\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.670\nRemember it's an uncertain event.\n\n170\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:29.900\nSomething that you're not expecting and\nit could be either positive or negative.\n\n171\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.980\nSo let's take a look at our\nrisk management procedure then.\n\n172\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.660\nAnd our risk management\nprocedure is really simple.\n\n173\n00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.270\nWe identify the risk.\n\n174\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.500\nWe assess it.\n\n175\n00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.790\nWe plan to do something about it.\n\n176\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.020\nAnd then we implement that plan and then,\nas I've already mentioned, we communicate.\n\n177\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.030\nSo let's take a look\nthen at identification.\n\n178\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:58.605\nHow do we identify this?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n179\n00:09:58.605 --> 00:09:59.210\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n180\n00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.970\nmean when I think of risk as I've said\nbefore I was thinking of negative.\n\n181\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.590\nI'm like what can go wrong?\n\n182\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:05.850\nWhat's bad?\n\n183\n00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.769\nWhat are possible failure points?\n\n184\n00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.850\nThose are the things I think about.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n185\n00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.490\n&gt;&gt; I don't think about any positive ones,\n\n186\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:18.310\nso I'm gonna be no help in that capacity.\n&gt;&gt; Well no because what I asked you was,\n\n187\n00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.920\nand this an important point, and\n\n188\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.640\nI've got an acronym, an acronym\nhere that Justin will really like.\n\n189\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.103\nHave you ever heard of\nan acronym called RTFQ?\n\n190\n00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:31.622\n&gt;&gt; Sounds familiar,\n\n191\n00:10:31.622 --> 00:10:34.835\nJo.\n&gt;&gt; R, no?\n\n192\n00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:35.405\n&gt;&gt; RTFQ.\n\n193\n00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:41.499\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, read the full question.\n\n194\n00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:47.250\nYeah, RTFQ, read the full question.\n\n195\n00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.640\nThat's an important one for your test.\n\n196\n00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.900\nThat's a really important acronym for\nyour test, okay.\n\n197\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.410\nYou answer the question as being asked of\nyou and not what you think you have read.\n\n198\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.890\nBe really careful.\n\n199\n00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.600\nThis is at foundation level,\nthey are gonna test your ability\n\n200\n00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.370\nto remember the definitions and\n\n201\n00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:16.460\nremember the concepts that you have\ncovered during these episodes.\n\n202\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.460\nSo at foundation level it's\nvery very important that you\n\n203\n00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:24.400\nanswer the question that is actually being\nasked of you and that you take your time.\n\n204\n00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.330\nTake the time to read the full question.\n\n205\n00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.120\nWatch out for every single word and do\nnot try and skim read through a question.\n\n206\n00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.360\nBecause you know what, if you try and\nskim read through a questions,\n\n207\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.620\nyou're gonna get the answer wrong.\n\n208\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.270\nSo Justin,\nthe question that I asked you was,\n\n209\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.060\nhow do you identify risk?\n&gt;&gt; I feel compelled to read off\n\n210\n00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.815\nthe slide.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n211\n00:11:45.815 --> 00:11:49.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.130\n&gt;&gt; Identify the risk event,\n\n213\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.240\nthe risk cause, the risk effect, or\nwhether it's a threat or an opportunity.\n\n214\n00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.950\nThat's what the bullet point said.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n215\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.090\nthat's not telling you how\nto identify them, is it?\n\n216\n00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.219\nWhat that bullet point is saying,\nis this is what you got to do with it.\n\n217\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.780\nThe first thing, though, you've got to do,\nis find out what's a risk.\n\n218\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.200\nSo what am I gonna do if I'm\ngonna identify my risks?\n\n219\n00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.110\nWhat am I gonna do?\n\n220\n00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.270\nHow am I gonna find out my risks?\n\n221\n00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.800\nIf I look at the risk event and\nthe risk cause, well,\n\n222\n00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.530\nthat's an assumption there that I\nactually got a risk event in mind.\n\n223\n00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.013\nI can't work out the cause of a risk\nif I don't know what the risk is can\n\n224\n00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:29.720\nI?\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n225\n00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so\n\n226\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.165\nthe question that I asked you was,\nhow do we identify risks?\n\n227\n00:12:34.165 --> 00:12:37.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I still don't have\n\n228\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.765\nan appropriate answer.\n\n229\n00:12:39.765 --> 00:12:45.840\n[LAUGH] And don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n230\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.710\nthere's no right and wrong way.\n\n231\n00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.880\nThere's no definitive answer to this and\n\n232\n00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.200\nthis is why I kind of want to\nmake the point with Justin.\n\n233\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.223\nNo I don't want to put my hands\naround his throat and strangle him.\n\n234\n00:12:56.223 --> 00:13:00.180\nNot just yet, we'll save that for\nanother episode, maybe.\n\n235\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:05.110\nThe point I'm trying to make is\nthis is really difficult to do.\n\n236\n00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.170\nThis is not something where we\ncan give you a textbook and\n\n237\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.470\nsay, here go and do this.\n\n238\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.530\nA risk is an uncertain event.\n\n239\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.020\nAnd you've got to manage uncertain events.\n\n240\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.120\nBut if they're uncertain,\n\n241\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.420\nhow on Earth do you find out\nwhat they potentially could be?\n\n242\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.420\n[LAUGH] And\nhe's still looking blank at me right now.\n\n243\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.486\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of a weird argument for\n\n244\n00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:35.503\nme Jo, they're uncertain, so\nhow do you identify them?\n\n245\n00:13:35.503 --> 00:13:38.059\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:39.570\n&gt;&gt; You grab a bunch of dice and\n\n247\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.470\nput them in a Yahtzee thing and\nthrow them down.\n\n248\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.440\nThere you go.\n&gt;&gt; There you go there's the risk.\n\n249\n00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.060\nRight, you know what, it's almost like\nthat sometimes within project management,\n\n250\n00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.540\nand that's not what we wanna do.\n\n251\n00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.030\nSo we wanna try and\n\n252\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.340\ngive you as much of a chance as\nwe possibly can to identify risk.\n\n253\n00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.220\nBecause I know that trying\nto identify potential\n\n254\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.640\nrisk is not something that's really easy.\n\n255\n00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.600\nSo I actually, look, here you go,\nhere's a little bit of a help, but\n\n256\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.680\nit's only a little bit of a help.\n\n257\n00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.650\nSo we'll do things like, we'll look\nat lessons learned from previous\n\n258\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.740\nor even projects that\nare going on right now,\n\n259\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.520\nprevious projects those that are happening\nalready within our portfolio.\n\n260\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.142\nWe will review lessons\nlearned from maybe suppliers.\n\n261\n00:14:29.142 --> 00:14:32.510\nBecause they've implemented\nthis particular product before.\n\n262\n00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.730\nWe'll review lessons learned\nfrom support people because\n\n263\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.680\nthese are the issues that our customers\nnow uses have had in the past.\n\n264\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.680\nSo we will review lessons learned.\n\n265\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.218\nWe'll also take a look at risk checklists.\n\n266\n00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.340\nNow, I'm gonna ask Justin\nthis question again, and\n\n267\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.660\nI asked him this in previous episodes and\nin other shows as well and he always\n\n268\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.050\ncomes back with the same answer, but I'm\nstill going to ask him the same question.\n\n269\n00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.750\nWhere do you go if you need information,\n\n270\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.000\nJustin?\n&gt;&gt; Well I start with my mother, and\n\n271\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.560\nthen I turn to Google when necessary.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what to say.\n\n272\n00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.590\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna change\n\n273\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.180\nmy answer.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n274\n00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.800\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you seem to get a kick out of it so\n\n275\n00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.320\nI'm like, yeah,\n\n276\n00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.670\nthat's what we're going with.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n277\n00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.050\nthat's what we're going with cuz Justin's\nmom knows absolutely everything,\n\n278\n00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.130\ndoesn't she?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n279\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.230\nshe's got a plethora of checklists.\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go.\n\n280\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.650\nShe's probably really,\nreally good at risk management, but\n\n281\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.195\nit clearly didn't rub off.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n282\n00:15:25.195 --> 00:15:30.168\ncan't disagree.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We generally would go to Google\n\n283\n00:15:30.168 --> 00:15:33.146\nif there's something that you,\nand I say Google, but\n\n284\n00:15:33.146 --> 00:15:35.280\nI mean the Internet in general.\n\n285\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.380\nThe Internet is full of what I'd\ncall complementary guidance,\n\n286\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:45.580\ncomplementary to our project management\nitself, and complementary to PRINCE2.\n\n287\n00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.065\nIf you don't know something, generally\nwhat we do is we'll go to the Internet,\n\n288\n00:15:51.065 --> 00:15:53.068\nand we'll ask the internet a question.\n\n289\n00:15:53.068 --> 00:15:57.344\nAnd usually, somebody's had\nthat particular dilemma before.\n\n290\n00:15:57.344 --> 00:15:59.431\nSo they'll be an answer there.\n\n291\n00:15:59.431 --> 00:16:02.183\nSo what we'll do is we'll take that.\n\n292\n00:16:02.183 --> 00:16:04.560\nThat would also be part\nof lessons learned.\n\n293\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.210\nAnd we'll take the information\nthat we find out on the Internet.\n\n294\n00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:12.760\nAnd we'll say, okay then, let's try and\napply this in our particular project.\n\n295\n00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.560\nSo we would use the Internet.\n\n296\n00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.470\nRemember that what's on the Internet\nis somebody else's opinion,\n\n297\n00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.720\nit's somebody else's experience,\nit's what's happened to them.\n\n298\n00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.440\nIt's not necessarily what's\ngonna happen to you.\n\n299\n00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.554\nHowever, we're looking for probable,\n\n300\n00:16:30.554 --> 00:16:34.220\nlikely, uncertain events.\n\n301\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.960\nThere's a whole heap of\nuncertainty in there.\n\n302\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.640\nThere's a whole heap of,\nsort of, the unknown there.\n\n303\n00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.170\nSo if we don't know something, well,\n\n304\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.880\nlet's go to the Internet\nbecause it may be helpful.\n\n305\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.630\nYou might find that it might not be.\n\n306\n00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.720\nBut hey, if we're trying to identify\nsomething that might happen.\n\n307\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.225\nThen we're gonna go to as\nmany sources of data and\n\n308\n00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:59.910\nas many sources of information\nas we possibly can.\n\n309\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.741\nHe's thinking.\n&gt;&gt; So if we do that,\n\n310\n00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:08.000\nbecause I've seen things on the Internet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n311\n00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.360\nhaven't we all?\n&gt;&gt; Where there have been good advice or\n\n312\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.420\nsound advice or data-driven advice.\n\n313\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.490\nAnd then I've seen people\nwho were trolling.\n\n314\n00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:23.450\nIf we use that to inform one of our\ndecisions, does that inherently introduce\n\n315\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.560\nan additional risk in trying\nto alleviate a previous risk?\n\n316\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.730\n&gt;&gt; You're jumping ahead of\n\n317\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.890\nyourself.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\n\n318\n00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.460\n&gt;&gt; You are way ahead of everybody\n\n319\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.010\nelse here.\n\n320\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.650\nWe're still just identifying risk.\n\n321\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.130\nWe're not talking about\ninforming our decisions.\n\n322\n00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.804\nWe're talking about just identifying risk.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n323\n00:17:42.804 --> 00:17:46.116\nit seems like an important thing to think\nabout, because I've seen some horrible\n\n324\n00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:47.406\nadvice on the Internet.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n325\n00:17:47.406 --> 00:17:48.390\nyou're still way ahead of yourself.\n\n326\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:52.040\nI'm not looking for advice,\nI'm looking for potential risks.\n\n327\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.790\nAnd yeah,\nbad advice is one potential risk.\n\n328\n00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.840\nBut I'm not talking about\nwhat I'd do with that risk.\n\n329\n00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.880\nWe're gonna come to that in a moment.\n\n330\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.885\nWhat I'm talking about is\njust identifying the risk.\n\n331\n00:18:01.885 --> 00:18:07.740\nAnd right now, as much information\nas I could possibly get my hands on,\n\n332\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.410\nis going to help me and identify risk.\n\n333\n00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:17.530\nAnd even if there's a low probability, or\nlow vulnerability, as I would call it.\n\n334\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:23.510\nThen even if that exists, it's still\na risk, and it should still be documented.\n\n335\n00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:27.020\nNow whether we choose to just accept\nthat risk and not do anything with it or\n\n336\n00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.831\nwhether we choose to ignore the advice,\nas you call it.\n\n337\n00:18:30.831 --> 00:18:35.003\nAdvice as I'd like to call it that goes\nalong with the risk that's identified on\n\n338\n00:18:35.003 --> 00:18:37.510\nthe Internet, and\nthat's entirely up to you.\n\n339\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.740\nBut we're gonna come up to\nthat in a little while, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.850\nFirst of all, we've got to\nidentify what these risks are.\n\n341\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.980\nNow, we've talked about lessons learned\nand we've talked about Google and\n\n342\n00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.930\nwhat's available on the Internet.\n\n343\n00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.320\nMaybe there's prompt lists.\n\n344\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.990\nAnd again, go back to the industry\nsector that you're in and\n\n345\n00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:00.060\nmaybe there is some industry\nadvice there for you as well.\n\n346\n00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.665\nIf you're in a particular,\nmaybe a production plant, for instance,\n\n347\n00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:10.460\nthen there may be checklists that you have\nwithin that plant to say, well, look.\n\n348\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.480\nLet's say we're in a food\nmanufacturing plant.\n\n349\n00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.280\nThen there's gonna be temperature\ncontrolled areas and there may be\n\n350\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:22.470\nchecklist to say, make sure that you\nensure the temperature in certain areas.\n\n351\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:28.185\nSo whatever you're bringing into IT cannot\naffect temperature controlled areas.\n\n352\n00:19:28.185 --> 00:19:31.170\nCannot affect the thermostats on the wall.\n\n353\n00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.321\nSo there are things like this that\nwe know that are a risk within our\n\n354\n00:19:35.321 --> 00:19:36.542\nenvironment too.\n\n355\n00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:41.350\nAnd then don't forget about brainstorming.\n\n356\n00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:47.480\nBrain storming is what?\n&gt;&gt; We're just spit balling ideas.\n\n357\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.750\nI think of it as just like\nthrowing noodles at the wall and\n\n358\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.270\nseeing which ones stick to the wall.\n&gt;&gt; You mean\n\n359\n00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.370\nspaghetti, right?\n\n360\n00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n361\n00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, noodles.\n\n362\n00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.810\nI mean, it could be linguine, I guess.\n\n363\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.751\nIt doesn't have to be spaghetti.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n364\n00:20:03.751 --> 00:20:04.580\nfettuccine?\n\n365\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n366\n00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.420\nnot a noodle.\n&gt;&gt; That is\n\n367\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.336\na noodle.\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n368\n00:20:08.336 --> 00:20:11.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes it is.\n\n369\n00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.770\n&gt;&gt; I can't believe we're going there.\n\n370\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.290\n&gt;&gt; Anyway I think we should talk,\n\n371\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.160\nbecause we're about to get\ninto some risky interactions.\n\n372\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n373\n00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.610\nthis is going to be a risk but\n\n374\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.200\na noodle is something you put in a wok and\nI'm going to leaving that one there.\n\n375\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.860\nThis is a brainstorm.\n\n376\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.768\nThe one thing that we didn't do\nin that particular brainstorm,\n\n377\n00:20:30.768 --> 00:20:34.060\nwell there were two things that we didn't\ndo in that particular brain storm.\n\n378\n00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.080\nWe didn't reach a conclusion.\n\n379\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.450\nWhich is never a good idea for\na brain storm.\n\n380\n00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:43.010\nWe want to come out of a brain storm\nsession with something such as a list of\n\n381\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:48.430\nidentified risk, and the other thing\nthat we didn't do is have an agenda.\n\n382\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.200\nBecause we need to know\nwhat we're discussing,\n\n383\n00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.120\ndon't we, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; We definitely know what we're\n\n384\n00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.020\ndiscussing.\n\n385\n00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.568\nAnd so sometimes you have\nto turn to the Internet.\n\n386\n00:20:57.568 --> 00:20:58.572\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:20:58.572 --> 00:20:59.640\n&gt;&gt; To help further.\n\n388\n00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.262\n&gt;&gt; Or even Justin's mom, for that matter.\n\n389\n00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.140\nIsn't that right?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, can't argue with that.\n\n390\n00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.020\nSeems like a good source\nof information for\n\n391\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.717\nme.\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at the last item\n\n392\n00:21:08.717 --> 00:21:12.562\nthen that's on that slide and the last\nitem there is a risk breakdown structure.\n\n393\n00:21:12.562 --> 00:21:16.315\nWhat we're gonna do with\nthe risks that we've identified,\n\n394\n00:21:16.315 --> 00:21:18.750\nno matter how we have identified them.\n\n395\n00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.420\nAnd we have identified\nthe risk that Justin and\n\n396\n00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.409\nI can't speak the same language.\n\n397\n00:21:23.409 --> 00:21:25.520\nIt doesn't matter how\nwe've identified them.\n\n398\n00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.680\nWhat we're going to do is we're\ngoing to categorize the risk.\n\n399\n00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.080\nIn other words,\nwe're going to break down the risks.\n\n400\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.820\nRemember what I said,\n\n401\n00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:37.190\nwhat needs to come out of a brainstorm,\nis a list of the risks we've identified.\n\n402\n00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.020\nWe've got to agree on those risks or\nwe've got to break them down.\n\n403\n00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:47.000\nWe've also then got to, well, prioritize\nthose risks in how important they are to\n\n404\n00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.710\nour organization, and how important\nthey are to our project as well.\n\n405\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.770\nSo let's go back to that previous slide.\n\n406\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:59.490\nAnd if we could just blow that slide up\na little bit, you'll see that now on that\n\n407\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:04.940\nbottom right hand corner,\nwe're going to identify the risk.\n\n408\n00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.990\nWe're then going to identify, now we get\non to the next step, Justin, you see.\n\n409\n00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.530\nNow that we've identified the risk,\nnow we look at what could cause the risk.\n\n410\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.050\nAnd what the effect of the risk could be,\nwhether it's a good risk,\n\n411\n00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.610\nwhether it's a bad risk.\n\n412\n00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.870\nWe still haven't got to that point where\nwe're deciding what to do about it.\n\n413\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.530\nNot right now.\n\n414\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:29.026\nBut then we have to put some\ncontext around each risk as well.\n\n415\n00:22:29.026 --> 00:22:31.266\nWhat the customer expectations are, and\n\n416\n00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:35.042\nthis is what I was saying just a little\nwhile ago about our priorities.\n\n417\n00:22:35.042 --> 00:22:39.604\nAnd our priorities will help us\nagain with some context, but\n\n418\n00:22:39.604 --> 00:22:44.740\nthink about our delivery approach,\nthink about our policies etc.\n\n419\n00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.480\nAll of that has got to be\nconsidered when we are, what?\n\n420\n00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.040\nIdentifying risks.\n\n421\n00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.815\nAnd then, once we got to identifying risk,\nnow we get on to assessing the risk.\n\n422\n00:22:57.815 --> 00:23:04.040\nAnd we still haven't even got to the point\nwhere we are doing something about it.\n\n423\n00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:09.060\nWe are just simply assessing\nthe risk at this point in time.\n\n424\n00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.770\nSo now we're gonna assess\nour vulnerability.\n\n425\n00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:17.560\nAnd our vulnerability is the likelihood\nthat that risk is going to happen.\n\n426\n00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:24.990\nIs it a high likelihood, is it a low\nlikelihood, is there a medium likelihood?\n\n427\n00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.610\nThis is what we're gonna do now and\ndon't forget are risks are either,\n\n428\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:33.530\nwell, the threats or\nthey are opportunities.\n\n429\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:37.180\nSo what we're gonna do now,\nis we're gonna estimate the likelihood and\n\n430\n00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.450\nwe're gonna estimate the value.\n\n431\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:44.040\nAnd we're also going to do\nwhat we call a risk profile.\n\n432\n00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.179\nAnd a risk profile is what's on this\nscreen in front of us right now.\n\n433\n00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:51.472\nCan you see that dotted area?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n434\n00:23:51.472 --> 00:23:52.103\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n435\n00:23:52.103 --> 00:23:56.723\nwhat do you think the dotted area means?\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing by the legend in\n\n436\n00:23:56.723 --> 00:23:59.766\nthe lower left hand corner\nit's the risk tolerance line.\n\n437\n00:23:59.766 --> 00:24:02.097\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but what does it mean?\n\n438\n00:24:02.097 --> 00:24:07.508\nThat means that anything above that is\noutside of my acceptable tolerance for\n\n439\n00:24:07.508 --> 00:24:10.976\nrisk?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, that's pretty much it,\n\n440\n00:24:10.976 --> 00:24:11.503\nyeah.\n\n441\n00:24:11.503 --> 00:24:14.418\nWe've given them numbers,\nso what we've done is,\n\n442\n00:24:14.418 --> 00:24:17.900\nthis is straight out of the PRINCE2 book,\nby the way.\n\n443\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.540\nSo what's happened here is,\n\n444\n00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.990\nthese are not priorities, these are just\nthe fact that we've identified risks.\n\n445\n00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.970\nAnd what we're going to do is,\nwe're going to give them numbers,\n\n446\n00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.680\njust to make it easier to put\nonto this particular graph.\n\n447\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:35.720\nAnd then we're going to place them in\na position based on likelihood, or\n\n448\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.670\nprobability, versus impact.\n\n449\n00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:43.675\nAnd so if the probability is really high,\nand the impact is very high as well,\n\n450\n00:24:43.675 --> 00:24:47.297\nthen chances are it's gonna\nfall out of our tolerance.\n\n451\n00:24:47.297 --> 00:24:51.859\nIn other words, if it's gonna have a\nreally high impact, negative impact to us,\n\n452\n00:24:51.859 --> 00:24:54.568\nand the chances of it\nhappening are pretty high,\n\n453\n00:24:54.568 --> 00:24:57.426\nthen we've got to do something about that,\nokay?\n\n454\n00:24:57.426 --> 00:25:02.542\nAnd so the risk tolerance line means\nthat for this particular example,\n\n455\n00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:07.902\nthose three risks that are identified\nin that top-right hand corner?\n\n456\n00:25:07.902 --> 00:25:12.010\nWe've gotta do something about it,\nbecause with those three risks,\n\n457\n00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.612\nthey're going to jeopardize our project.\n\n458\n00:25:14.612 --> 00:25:18.806\nThey're gonna jeopardize\nthe success of our project, so\n\n459\n00:25:18.806 --> 00:25:21.637\nwe've got to do something about them.\n\n460\n00:25:21.637 --> 00:25:25.965\nNow, I'm getting into the realms of\ndoing exactly what Justin did right at\n\n461\n00:25:25.965 --> 00:25:30.172\nthe very start, and making assumptions\nthat these are negative risks.\n\n462\n00:25:30.172 --> 00:25:33.485\nBecause quite simply,\nwe do need to categorize them in\n\n463\n00:25:33.485 --> 00:25:37.745\nterms of whether they are opportunities or\nwhether they are threats.\n\n464\n00:25:37.745 --> 00:25:42.834\nIf they're opportunities, then we want\nthem to be in that top right-hand corner,\n\n465\n00:25:42.834 --> 00:25:46.285\nbut if they are threats,\nthen we don't want them there.\n\n466\n00:25:46.285 --> 00:25:50.784\nAnd so what we've got to do is make\na decision as to what we're going to\n\n467\n00:25:50.784 --> 00:25:51.800\ndo about them.\n\n468\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.010\nSo going back here,\nin the bottom right-hand corner,\n\n469\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.000\nyou'll see that we will use\nthings like risk models.\n\n470\n00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.080\nWe'll have to identify what our\ntolerance is for each individual risk.\n\n471\n00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.960\nWe have to identify what the monetary or\n\n472\n00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.100\nthe financial impact\nwould be of each risk.\n\n473\n00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.510\nThis is part of our assessment, and\n\n474\n00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:22.420\nwe get to this particular graph\nby doing that assessment.\n\n475\n00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.893\nSo what we've done so\nfar to our risk, then,\n\n476\n00:26:26.893 --> 00:26:32.373\nis we have identified risk, and\nnow we've looked at assessing risks.\n\n477\n00:26:32.373 --> 00:26:36.391\nAnd what we're gonna do, we're gonna leave\nthat there for this particular episode.\n\n478\n00:26:36.391 --> 00:26:41.425\nAnd when we come back, we're gonna look\nat our next stage of risk management,\n\n479\n00:26:41.425 --> 00:26:42.885\nof our risk approach.\n\n480\n00:26:42.885 --> 00:26:47.451\nWhich is planning for what we're going\nto do with that risk, and then actually\n\n481\n00:26:47.451 --> 00:26:52.210\nimplementing and communicating what\nwe're doing about risk management.\n\n482\n00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:58.331\nSo come back, because we've got a part\ntwo on the theme of risk in PRINCE2.\n\n483\n00:26:58.331 --> 00:26:59.575\n&gt;&gt; Well, you heard it there,\n\n484\n00:26:59.575 --> 00:27:01.313\nit's definitely gonna be a part two.\n\n485\n00:27:01.313 --> 00:27:04.711\nAnd I told you that I was really bad\nat terminology, and that we were gonna\n\n486\n00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:06.645\nhave some fun in this episode.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n487\n00:27:06.645 --> 00:27:08.333\n&gt;&gt; I called it in the last episode, so\n\n488\n00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:11.370\nif you want to see more of that,\nthen definitely come on back.\n\n489\n00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:16.060\nBut we've identified, we've assessed,\nbut we're not done managing our risk.\n\n490\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.057\nSo definitely come on back, but for now,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n491\n00:27:19.057 --> 00:27:21.923\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n492\n00:27:21.923 --> 00:27:22.981\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n493\n00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:23.667\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n494\n00:27:23.667 --> 00:27:30.944\n[MUSIC]\n\n495\n00:27:30.944 --> 00:27:33.270\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.300\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.720\nwell we're back with more\nPRINCE2 2017 foundation.\n\n8\n00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.040\nAnd well,\nwe're coming back with a part two, yeah,\n\n9\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.490\nthat's right a part two,\nin our risk theme.\n\n10\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.830\nAnd if you haven't seen part one,\ndefinitely go check that out.\n\n11\n00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.290\nAnd here to help us, well, make me realize\nthat I don't know what I'm talking about\n\n12\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.190\nbut also make sure that you\nunderstand the risk theme.\n\n13\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.660\nThe one and only Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n14\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.120\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, how are you, Justin?\n\n15\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.270\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n16\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.140\nI tried to slow down that\nhow are you doing but\n\n17\n00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.240\nit still came off my tongue weird.\n\n18\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.550\nBut I took a risk and\nI don't think it played out well for\n\n19\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.480\nme.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n20\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.530\nyou took a risk arguing with\nme in the last episode, so\n\n21\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.770\nI guess you are a risk taker now, right?\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what,\n\n22\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.770\nmy heart got a little elevated.\n\n23\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.700\nI started sweating.\n\n24\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.970\nI think it was the adrenaline.\n\n25\n00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.430\nI couldn't help myself.\n&gt;&gt; I think it was the air conditioning\n\n26\n00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.248\nactually.\n&gt;&gt; It might have been that also.\n\n27\n00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:06.746\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:09.670\n&gt;&gt; We were actually taking a risk\n\n29\n00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.090\nin episode one.\n\n30\n00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.910\nAnd what we were looking\nat in episode one,\n\n31\n00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.480\nwe were looking at how we identify risk.\n\n32\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.390\nAnd the techniques that we\nuse to identify risk, and\n\n33\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.160\nthen how we actually assess risk and\nthe techniques that we use to assess risk.\n\n34\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.250\nSo looking at priority and\nlooking at impact and\n\n35\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.220\nlooking at the likelihood or\nthe probability of that risk occurring.\n\n36\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.300\nAnd of course, one of the greatest\nrevelations was that, well,\n\n37\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.800\na risk can be either a positive thing or\na negative thing.\n\n38\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.953\nNot just a negative thing.\n\n39\n00:01:41.953 --> 00:01:46.940\nAnd Justin still doesn't agree with that.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of it is probably\n\n40\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.920\ncultural bias or\nhow I typically talk about risk with other\n\n41\n00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.480\npeople where I'm from, we tend to\ntalk about risk in a negative manner.\n\n42\n00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.360\nAnd if it's positive,\nthen we just call it good luck.\n\n43\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.820\nSo I think it might just\nbe a vernacular thing.\n\n44\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.670\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it is,\n\n45\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.180\nI think it really is a case of,\n\n46\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.430\nmost people assume that\nrisk is a negative thing.\n\n47\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.810\nThis has got nothing to\ndo with culture at all.\n\n48\n00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.840\nI mean, the debate that we had about\nnoodles and what we do with them in\n\n49\n00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.280\nthe last episode was definitely\na cultural thing [LAUGH] but risk is not.\n\n50\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.860\nIt really is just a common thought\nthat when we think of the word risk,\n\n51\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.540\nwhen we use the word risk, we always\nuse it to mean something negative.\n\n52\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.800\nBut a risk as we saw in our last episode,\nand in fact,\n\n53\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.650\nwhat I'm actually going to do\nis I'm just gonna go back and\n\n54\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.330\njust grab that slide where we\nlooked at the definition of a risk.\n\n55\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.600\nThe definition of a risk?\n\n56\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.760\nWell, it's an uncertain event.\n\n57\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.480\nAnd that uncertain event could be\npositive or it could be negative.\n\n58\n00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.430\nIt could be a threat or\nit could be an opportunity.\n\n59\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.860\nAnd that's just something that we\nall have to get our head around.\n\n60\n00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.210\nBecause when we use the word risk,\ninvariably whenever we use that word,\n\n61\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.900\nwe use it to mean something negative.\n\n62\n00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.250\nWe use it to mean a threat.\n\n63\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.900\nWe don't necessarily use\nit to mean an opportunity.\n\n64\n00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.600\nLike you say an opportunity we think of,\nwell, that was a bit of a bonus wasn't it.\n\n65\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.460\nAnd that's what we say when something\ngood happens, put it that way.\n\n66\n00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.890\nSo in our last episode then,\nwe looked at identifying the risk.\n\n67\n00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.680\nThan the techniques that we\nwould use to identify risk.\n\n68\n00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.930\nTechniques such as check lists, and\nprompt lists, and brainstorming as well,\n\n69\n00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.510\nand maybe even asking Justin's mom or\nGoogle, for that matter.\n\n70\n00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.270\nAnd then we also looked\nat assessing the risk.\n\n71\n00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.650\nAnd assessing the risk,\nthen we used a Risk Profile.\n\n72\n00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.625\nAnd of course, one of the things we\nsaid was if something was in that top\n\n73\n00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:42.600\nright-hand quadrant then we\nneeded to do something about it.\n\n74\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.110\nNow, that dotted line is what\nwe call our risk tolerance line.\n\n75\n00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.290\nThat's going to be different for\nevery single organization.\n\n76\n00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.220\nYou will have a completely\ndifferent risk tolerance.\n\n77\n00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.010\nYou might for instance say, well look,\nif the probability is very high then it\n\n78\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.680\ndoesn't matter what the impact is going\nto be we've got to do something about it.\n\n79\n00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.860\nOr, it doesn't matter what the probability\nis, but if the impact is going to be\n\n80\n00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.830\nreally high then we're gonna\nhave to do something about it.\n\n81\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.620\nYou will define your own\nrisk tolerance profile.\n\n82\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.630\nWe can't tell you how to do it,\nwe'll just give you an example.\n\n83\n00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.070\nSo now, what we've got to do is decide\nwhat we're gonna do with the risk.\n\n84\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.380\nNow we've evaluated it.\n\n85\n00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.310\nLet's concentrate on the risks that\nare in that top right hand corner.\n\n86\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.000\nThat are outside of our\nrisk tolerance line.\n\n87\n00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.690\nWe've got to do something about it.\n\n88\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.430\nNow, we do have techniques\nsuch as management of risk or\n\n89\n00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.710\nMOR as it's most commonly known,\nthat will help us with risk management and\n\n90\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.430\nhelp us to identify what to do.\n\n91\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.410\nBut appropriate responses would\nbe to avoid or reduce a threat.\n\n92\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.470\nNow we quite often consider\nthat to be risk mitigation,\n\n93\n00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.230\nbut there are two types of mitigation.\n\n94\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.530\nThere is mitigating against the risk, and\n\n95\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.610\nit's mitigated against\nthe impact of the risk.\n\n96\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.890\nHmm, what's the difference?\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n97\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.200\nmitigating the risk,\nI'm going to try to reduce the probability\n\n98\n00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.680\nthat it occurs.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n99\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.640\n&gt;&gt; Mitigating the impact, okay,\n\n100\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.950\nit's going to occur with a high\nprobability, I'm going try to reduce or\n\n101\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.930\nchange how much that affects me,\nor the respective project.\n\n102\n00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.460\nNow, I'm gonna back up and say one thing.\n\n103\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.350\nMaybe it is still not a high probability.\n&gt;&gt; Right, I was just gonna say,\n\n104\n00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.140\nthe one thing that I have exception\nwith that you just said there,\n\n105\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.840\nyou said it's gonna occur\nwith a high probability.\n\n106\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.499\nIt's not necessarily the case.\n&gt;&gt; It may be a lower probability but\n\n107\n00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.560\nit still has a high possibility of impact,\nlike it's impact level-\n\n108\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.920\n&gt;&gt; A high impact [CROSSTALK].\n\n109\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.505\nYeah, so we would mitigate or we could\nchoose to mitigate against the risk, so\n\n110\n00:05:54.505 --> 00:05:58.240\nthat's what we might call for\ninstance fire prevention.\n\n111\n00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.340\nWe try and stop the fire from starting.\n\n112\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.310\nSo if we were in a building we might\nsay in an office building we might say\n\n113\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.660\nthings like, right, no cigarette\nlighters allowed in the office.\n\n114\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.440\nNo matches allowed in the office.\n\n115\n00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.050\nNothing flammable is\nallowed in the office.\n\n116\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.019\nSomething like maybe in the studio\nthere is no hairspray in\n\n117\n00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:22.960\nthe studios cuz I mean that wouldn't\ndo me any good work whatsoever, but\n\n118\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.290\nanyway, we'll try and\nreduce the likelihood.\n\n119\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:32.390\nBut then, what we also might do\nis mitigate against the impact.\n\n120\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.850\nSo we are accepting that\nthe risk could happen.\n\n121\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.920\nWe maybe mitigate to a certain point\nagainst the likelihood or the probability.\n\n122\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.032\nAnd then we say, okay,\nnow let's assume that it does happen,\n\n123\n00:06:45.032 --> 00:06:49.300\nwe're gonna have to try and\nmitigate against the impact.\n\n124\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.520\nSo, by prevention, which is proactive and\nthen we got the reactive part, which is\n\n125\n00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.190\nreduction in the spread of the fire, so we\nmight do things like, certainly in Europe.\n\n126\n00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.690\nWe legally have to have five of those,\n\n127\n00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.170\nwhich allow us to block off\nthat certain portion of the and\n\n128\n00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.000\nallow us to isolate the fire and\nisolate the air flow into the fire.\n\n129\n00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.589\nOr maybe is we have in the US,\nwe'll have five sprinkler systems.\n\n130\n00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:20.670\nAnd so, what they're doing it's\nthey're not preventing fire,\n\n131\n00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.750\nthat's not fire prevention but\nwhat that's doing is that trying to\n\n132\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.210\nminimize the impact caused by the fire.\n\n133\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.850\nSo that would be a mitigation.\n\n134\n00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.920\nNow, when we talk about fire prevention,\nfire prevention falls into both\n\n135\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.620\nthe avoidance of the threat and\ntrying to reduce the threat.\n\n136\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.080\nI'll be honest with you,\nit's more about reducing the threat.\n\n137\n00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.043\nWe're trying to avoid it, but\nyou know what, you can't.\n\n138\n00:07:46.043 --> 00:07:50.779\nIf we're talking about an IT environment\nthen it's at this point in time where,\n\n139\n00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:53.706\nlet's say you having it\nwork topology diagram and\n\n140\n00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:57.136\nyou identify this single point to failure,\nperhaps one.\n\n141\n00:07:57.136 --> 00:07:59.832\nRouter is, well,\nit's there running, it's on.\n\n142\n00:07:59.832 --> 00:08:02.490\nAnd that is a potential\nsingle point of failure.\n\n143\n00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.870\nWe might avoid that threat by\nadding in an additional router, or\n\n144\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.400\nmaybe we'll avoid that threat by adding in\nmirroring on our servers, for instance.\n\n145\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.360\nSo that would be avoidance\nof a particular threat.\n\n146\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.270\nNow obviously,\n\n147\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.800\nagain, we're back to that situation where\nwe're thinking about negative risk.\n\n148\n00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.939\nWe're not thinking about positive risks,\ncuz if it was a positive risk then we\n\n149\n00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:27.593\ncertainly wouldn't want to avoid it,\nor at least I don't think so.\n\n150\n00:08:27.593 --> 00:08:33.407\nOr would we?\n&gt;&gt; Tthe only thing I-\n\n151\n00:08:33.407 --> 00:08:33.908\n&gt;&gt; That's a trick question, right?\n\n152\n00:08:33.908 --> 00:08:37.093\nThat's what you're thinking\n&gt;&gt; The only thing that makes me think is\n\n153\n00:08:37.093 --> 00:08:39.173\nbecause you asked me, I'm like,\n\n154\n00:08:39.173 --> 00:08:43.640\nmaybe there are unforeseen consequences\nfrom having that thing happen.\n\n155\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.070\nLike, well that was a bonus, but man,\nI just got hit with a giant tax bill or\n\n156\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.333\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:52.180\n&gt;&gt; For some reason, that's in my mind.\n\n158\n00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.685\nMan, I just got gifted this million house,\nI gotta pay taxes on it.\n\n159\n00:08:56.685 --> 00:08:59.177\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, let's just say, right,\n\n160\n00:08:59.177 --> 00:09:02.384\nthat this particular series becomes so\npopular, and\n\n161\n00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:04.395\neverybody absolutely loves it.\n\n162\n00:09:04.395 --> 00:09:09.098\nThat we get a lot more views\non this particular series,\n\n163\n00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:12.690\nbut what it does is it crashes our server.\n\n164\n00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.060\nSo that's an opportunity, but\n\n165\n00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.410\nthat opportunity can still result\nin something potentially negative.\n\n166\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:26.091\nSo, yes, we might still want to\nreduce then the opportunities for\n\n167\n00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:28.836\nviewing that particular show.\n\n168\n00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.076\nOr maybe we'll say look, hang on,\n\n169\n00:09:31.076 --> 00:09:35.720\nwe're gonna a maximum number on this\nparticular episode at any one time.\n\n170\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.150\nNumber of concurrent users, for\ninstance, or concurrent viewers.\n\n171\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.742\nSo that would be part of\nsort of avoiding a risk and\n\n172\n00:09:44.742 --> 00:09:47.786\nreducing that particular threat as well.\n\n173\n00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:51.110\nAnd then what about transferring a risk?\n\n174\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.461\nWe quite often will transfer a risk to\nsomebody else, like an external supplier.\n\n175\n00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:58.210\nWe'll say, so you know what,\nwe don't wanna handle this.\n\n176\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.160\nFire prevention,\nwe might get somebody else to come in and\n\n177\n00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.430\ndo some consultancy and\nadvise on what measures can be taken.\n\n178\n00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.300\nAnd we'll transfer that\nrisk to somebody else, or\n\n179\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.980\nwe may choose to share the risk\nwith that particular person.\n\n180\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.125\nOr you might just choose to accept it and\nsay, you know what,\n\n181\n00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:21.220\nit could happen but, hey, it's all right,\nthe likelihood's fairly low.\n\n182\n00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.660\nSo we will just accept it.\n\n183\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.178\nYou were thinking Justin.\n&gt;&gt; So I was just thinking, I mean,\n\n184\n00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:29.533\neffectively that's what you're doing\nwhen you're transferring some of\n\n185\n00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:31.462\nyour infrastructure to cloud providers.\n\n186\n00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:34.050\nAs far as like physical failures and\nthings.\n\n187\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.258\nThat is now their responsibility.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n188\n00:10:36.258 --> 00:10:39.927\n&gt;&gt; And so the risk of failure has been\n\n189\n00:10:39.927 --> 00:10:43.508\noffloaded to them.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n190\n00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:44.850\n&gt;&gt; And, I mean, there's a whole lot there.\n\n191\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.494\nI was just thinking about it.\n\n192\n00:10:45.494 --> 00:10:47.560\nI was like,\nyeah I guess that does make sense.\n\n193\n00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.560\nCuz you're just going,\nthis is up to you now.\n\n194\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.740\nSecurity of the physical infrastructure,\nand then protection against failure.\n\n195\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.320\nAnd to some extent, failure recovery,\ndepending on what the prospective is.\n\n196\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:58.936\n&gt;&gt; Generally,\n\n197\n00:10:58.936 --> 00:11:02.408\nwhat I see when we've got risks that\nare transferred to somebody else, or\n\n198\n00:11:02.408 --> 00:11:04.648\neven risks that are shared\nwith somebody else,\n\n199\n00:11:04.648 --> 00:11:07.789\nI see penalties and incentives in\ncontracts at that point in time.\n\n200\n00:11:07.789 --> 00:11:09.752\nI'm transferring that\nrisk entirely to you.\n\n201\n00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:14.514\nBut if something happens,\nthen you're gonna pay me a huge fee\n\n202\n00:11:14.514 --> 00:11:18.280\nbecause this is data\nthat we're talking about.\n\n203\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.974\nI mean, it's certainly where we are right\nnow is we're in a position with GDPR.\n\n204\n00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:25.802\nAnd with data protection laws,\n\n205\n00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:29.322\nthen you might choose to transfer\nthat data somewhere else and\n\n206\n00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:33.285\nget somebody else to look after it and\nmanage the security on it.\n\n207\n00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:37.982\nBut then you're probably gonna put it\nin place, as I've said, penalties and\n\n208\n00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:42.414\nincentives to actually to cover\nyourselves if something were to happen.\n\n209\n00:11:42.414 --> 00:11:49.950\nBecause there'd be a huge big fine on\nus if we contravened any GDPR rules.\n\n210\n00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.630\nAnd so therefore,\nif we're transferring that risk,\n\n211\n00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:57.260\nthen we also have to transfer then\nthat potential fine that we could get.\n\n212\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:04.095\nSo transferring the risk or sharing\nthe risk is not getting rid of the risk.\n\n213\n00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:06.240\nSo don't think that it is.\n\n214\n00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.165\nThat's possibly one of those\nmisconceptions that people think.\n\n215\n00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:12.740\nWell, I don't have to worry about it\nbecause I've given it to somebody else.\n\n216\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.366\nIt's still there.\nYeah,\n\n217\n00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:17.270\nyou've given it to somebody else to\nmanage, but the risk is still there.\n\n218\n00:12:18.865 --> 00:12:22.368\nYou're thinking.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm thinking.\n\n219\n00:12:22.368 --> 00:12:28.490\nWhenever people say, I've offloaded\nthis risk, but therein live number one.\n\n220\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.101\nIt's still a possibility.\n\n221\n00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:34.251\nBut by doing so,\nis it possible that you are introducing\n\n222\n00:12:34.251 --> 00:12:39.520\nadditional risk from actually\noffloading the previous risk?\n\n223\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.380\nLike the fire suppression company,\nwe can't get a hold of them and\n\n224\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.160\nour suppression system is down and\n\n225\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.326\nnow we have a problem.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n226\n00:12:46.326 --> 00:12:49.185\nwhen it comes to supply management,\nthat in itself,\n\n227\n00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:53.196\nsupply management you have to do risk\nmanagement with supply management.\n\n228\n00:12:53.196 --> 00:12:57.935\nBecause you have to say, well,\nlook, this particular organization,\n\n229\n00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:00.965\nthis file that we\nare transferring risks to and\n\n230\n00:13:00.965 --> 00:13:05.670\nthat we're bringing on board to\nwork with us, what if they fail?\n\n231\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.930\nAre they the only service providers,\nthe only supplier in our particular area?\n\n232\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.310\nOr in our particular market space?\n\n233\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.470\nAnd what if they fail?\n\n234\n00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.200\nWhat if something goes wrong and\nthey're not available, like you say?\n\n235\n00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.560\nSo that, as you say, is a risk in itself.\n\n236\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.190\nSo you might alleviate one risk, but\n\n237\n00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:30.260\nyou might bring another one in\nby alleviating the first one.\n\n238\n00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:35.510\nAnd by the way, like I first said, you're\nnot trying to alleviate the first risk,\n\n239\n00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.485\nwhat you're trying to do is sort\nof bury your head in the sand and\n\n240\n00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.748\nforget about it in some instances.\n\n241\n00:13:41.748 --> 00:13:46.967\nWhat we want to do is we want to get to a\npoint with any successful project where we\n\n242\n00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:52.679\nhave offloaded the risk to somebody else,\nor transferred the risk to somebody else.\n\n243\n00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:57.271\nBut it has been a decision based\non the fact that they have\n\n244\n00:13:57.271 --> 00:14:01.690\nbetter capabilities to manage\nthe risk than we have.\n\n245\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.950\nThat's why we would transfer a risk.\n\n246\n00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.670\nBecause they've got better capabilities\nthan us to manage that risk, and\n\n247\n00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:12.720\nto deal with that risk, and\nto manage the impact of the risk, as well.\n\n248\n00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.720\nThat's why we would do that.\n\n249\n00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.950\nWe wouldn't transfer a risk to somebody\nelse just because we wanted to offload it,\n\n250\n00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.210\njust because we wanted to get rid of it.\n\n251\n00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.190\nThat's not why we transfer risk.\n\n252\n00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:30.310\nWe transfer risk because somebody else\nis better suited to deal with it.\n\n253\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:36.110\nAnd we always have to, the last bullet\npoint on this particular slide,\n\n254\n00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:40.160\nwe always have to prepare\nsort of contingent plans.\n\n255\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.470\nWhat are we gonna do if\nsomething goes wrong?\n\n256\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.650\nWhat are we gonna do if that risk happens?\n\n257\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.423\nBecause it doesn't matter how\nmuch mitigation you put in.\n\n258\n00:14:52.423 --> 00:14:56.282\nIt doesn't matter whether\nyou transfer the risk,\n\n259\n00:14:56.282 --> 00:15:00.769\nwhether you share the risk,\nthere is still a probability,\n\n260\n00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:05.633\nno matter how small,\na likelihood that that risk could happen.\n\n261\n00:15:05.633 --> 00:15:10.608\nAnd so at that point in time,\nyou have to have contingent plans for\n\n262\n00:15:10.608 --> 00:15:12.500\nwhen it does happen.\n\n263\n00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.530\nIt's not an if, it's when it does happen.\n\n264\n00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.810\nBecause you've prepared,\nand if you've prepared,\n\n265\n00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.200\nyou know what to do\nwhen something happens.\n\n266\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.430\nAnd your response is to risk,\nwell, whatever they are,\n\n267\n00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.640\nwhatever those contingent plans\nare you're responses should be smart.\n\n268\n00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.190\nThey should be realistic.\n\n269\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.325\nThey should be very specific.\n\n270\n00:15:33.325 --> 00:15:39.170\nNobody should have any ambiguity as to\nwhat they should be doing in a certain\n\n271\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.170\ninstance, but they should be actionable.\n\n272\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.530\nThey should be achievable.\n\n273\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.281\nThey should be realistic.\n\n274\n00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:50.736\nDon't expect somebody to learn\nyou skills overnight just in case\n\n275\n00:15:50.736 --> 00:15:52.359\nsomething goes wrong.\n\n276\n00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:57.454\nIf I'm not equipped to do that,\nif I don't have the skills to be\n\n277\n00:15:57.454 --> 00:16:03.360\nable to react to a particular type\nof risk, then don't ask me to do it.\n\n278\n00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.815\nOr at least give me the training in order\nto be able to respond to that risk.\n\n279\n00:16:07.815 --> 00:16:12.284\nI see this with risk mitigation,\nquite often where certain things,\n\n280\n00:16:12.284 --> 00:16:16.090\ncertain actions are allocated\nto certain people.\n\n281\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.870\nThey're given those responsibilities, and\n\n282\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.500\nthey've never done\nanything like that before.\n\n283\n00:16:20.582 --> 00:16:24.350\nBut then, the caveat there is that\nthe project manager will say,\n\n284\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.590\nwell it's okay because it's\nnot gonna happen anyway.\n\n285\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.292\nYeah, all right then.\n\n286\n00:16:28.292 --> 00:16:31.097\n[LAUGH] I've heard that so many times and\n\n287\n00:16:31.097 --> 00:16:35.920\nI've seen it go horribly wrong so\nmany times as well.\n\n288\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.080\nAll risks should have an owner,\nbut it should be somebody that is\n\n289\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.780\ncapable of dealing with that risk and\ncapable of dealing with\n\n290\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.990\nwhat we'd call the contingent action,\nshould that risk actually occur.\n\n291\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.690\nNow the risk owner doesn't necessarily\nhave to be the same person as the risk\n\n292\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:59.670\nactionee, as the person that's actually\nactioning or dealing with the risk.\n\n293\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:05.380\nBut, nevertheless,\nall risks should have a risk owner.\n\n294\n00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.230\nAnd then we get into the last step here,\nand in risk management.\n\n295\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:15.550\nAnd that step is communication,\ncommunicating the risks,\n\n296\n00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.290\ncommunicating the likelihood,\ncommunicating the responses to the risks.\n\n297\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.818\nWe have to communicate what should\nhappen if a risk should happen.\n\n298\n00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:30.040\nSo we communicate to all\nof our stakeholders.\n\n299\n00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.220\nWe know who our stakeholders are,\n\n300\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.060\nbecause during project initiation we\nhave identified our stakeholders and\n\n301\n00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.720\nwe look to roll some responsibilities\nduring our organization theme as well.\n\n302\n00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.420\nSo we communicate what should happen,\nwe communicate using many, many tools.\n\n303\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.860\nAnd we should have a communication\nplan for how we communicate with\n\n304\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.640\nall of our stakeholders and we are going\nto look at that during our processes.\n\n305\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.000\nWhen we start to look at our,\n\n306\n00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.360\nour project processes we'll start\nto look at how we communicate.\n\n307\n00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.270\nBut we've got some examples of how\nwe communicate here such as report\n\n308\n00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.530\nthat happen at the end of every stage, for\n\n309\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:12.940\ninstance information radiators that\nhappen throughout stages, dashboards.\n\n310\n00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.820\nThere's no right or\nwrong way of communicating, you know your\n\n311\n00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.960\nstakeholders and you know how you should\ncommunicate to your stakeholders.\n\n312\n00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.570\nThere's a word there though\nthat's really important\n\n313\n00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.750\nwhen it comes to communication and\nthat is the word continual.\n\n314\n00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.140\nYou don't just communicate\non a one off thing and\n\n315\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.355\nthen expect somebody to remember it.\n\n316\n00:18:33.355 --> 00:18:37.012\nI has Justin shaking his head here,\nwhat I see,\n\n317\n00:18:37.012 --> 00:18:40.690\nthings like our service continuity plan.\n\n318\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.700\nI quite often see that when\nI go inside and I'll see\n\n319\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.080\na service continuity plan that was last\ncommunicated to people three years ago.\n\n320\n00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.440\nAnd I'll say to people,\nwhere is your service continuity plan?\n\n321\n00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:57.200\nEspecially if we're doing an ISO\n27001 audit, or an ISO 20000 audit.\n\n322\n00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.328\nAnd I'll go out to people and I'll say,\nso where is your service continuity plan?\n\n323\n00:19:01.328 --> 00:19:06.220\nAnd they got, well,\nit was communicated three years ago, but\n\n324\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.940\nI don't know where it is right now,\nhang on a minute, let me find it.\n\n325\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.960\nI mean in those instances\nwhen we're talking audits,\n\n326\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.450\nin those instances then\nthe organization will fairly audit.\n\n327\n00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.380\nBut other than that, it's very dangerous,\n\n328\n00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.430\nespecially when we're talking\nabout risk-management.\n\n329\n00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:32.390\nWe should all know what to do in\ncase of a threat actually happening.\n\n330\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.920\nAnd so, whether that's invoking\nservice continuity or not,\n\n331\n00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.060\nwe should all know what we need to do and\nhow to do that.\n\n332\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.420\nAnd like I said, we should all have\nthe relevant skills as well in order to be\n\n333\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.080\nable to action our items.\n\n334\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:53.220\nSo for any project then, we do need to\nhave a defined risk management approach.\n\n335\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:59.792\nWhich includes, the procedure for dealing\nwith all of our risks, how to identify\n\n336\n00:19:59.792 --> 00:20:05.109\nrisks, what would be considered acceptable\ntolerances for all of our risks.\n\n337\n00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:10.410\nAnd then how to evaluate and asses each\nrisk, how to allocate responsibilities for\n\n338\n00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:15.010\neach risk, and then how to actually\ndeal with each risk as well.\n\n339\n00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.210\nThe risks are managed right the way\nthroughout project duration and\n\n340\n00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.500\nin fact the risks may even be\ntransferred over to support\n\n341\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.650\nwhen we transition our live service.\n\n342\n00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.870\nCuz if there is risk that a server\nmay fail during development,\n\n343\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.650\nthat server may fail in\nthe live environment also.\n\n344\n00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:39.370\nSo some risks are transitioned along\nwith the actual product itself.\n\n345\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.670\nSo, a risk budget will be established and\nthat may not just be a budget for\n\n346\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.960\nthe actual project,\nit may be a risk budget for\n\n347\n00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.490\nthe life cycle of the product\nitself that we are delivering.\n\n348\n00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.250\nAbove all, our risk management approach\n\n349\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.690\nhas to align with the needs of the\norganization, it has to be what they want.\n\n350\n00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.500\nIt's not about what we want,\nit's about what they want.\n\n351\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.595\nAnd so,\nwe have to have an attitude to risk that\n\n352\n00:21:07.595 --> 00:21:12.184\naligns ourselves with what\nthe organization wants.\n\n353\n00:21:12.184 --> 00:21:15.954\nAnd if the organization wants us to\ntransfer all risk outside to say,\n\n354\n00:21:15.954 --> 00:21:19.160\nyou mentioned cloud service\nproviders earlier on.\n\n355\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.940\nThen, that's what we should do.\n\n356\n00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.320\nBut if the organization wants\nus to keep all of our data, and\n\n357\n00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.589\nmanage all of our data in-house,\nthen again, that's what we should do.\n\n358\n00:21:31.521 --> 00:21:35.110\nWhatever we do has to be aligned\nwith what the organization wants.\n\n359\n00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:41.375\nYou are thinking again.\n&gt;&gt; So we talked about transferring risk,\n\n360\n00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:43.837\nbut correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n361\n00:21:43.837 --> 00:21:48.243\nI think of transferring a risk\nalmost as trading risk.\n\n362\n00:21:48.243 --> 00:21:49.126\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n363\n00:21:49.126 --> 00:21:50.418\n&gt;&gt; What I'm doing is,\n\n364\n00:21:50.418 --> 00:21:55.586\nyeah I'm putting this over here, but it\nalmost seems like when I offload this one\n\n365\n00:21:55.586 --> 00:22:00.690\nthen I get another one in it's place,\nlike there's an equal exchange of risk.\n\n366\n00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.880\nSo, cloud service providers in particular.\n\n367\n00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.301\nOkay, I offloaded that over there, but\nnow what if my connection goes down?\n\n368\n00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:09.844\nWhat if my storage gateway goes down?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n369\n00:22:09.844 --> 00:22:12.897\n&gt;&gt; What if there's these other things that\n\n370\n00:22:12.897 --> 00:22:16.640\nare now risk to you that weren't before?\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n371\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.400\nit goes back to what we were saying\nbefore about transferring risk and\n\n372\n00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.640\nthere you have to do then additional risk\nmanagement in order to transfer risk.\n\n373\n00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.550\nAnd that's exactly the same thing,\nit could be a trade-off.\n\n374\n00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.510\nBy transferring a risk,\n\n375\n00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:37.000\nyou could be transferring a big risk but\naccepting a smaller risk instead.\n\n376\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.150\nSo that could be a trade-off\nthat you're making.\n\n377\n00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.933\nBut what you may do, is you may transfer\na risk, but you may actually make that\n\n378\n00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:49.735\nrisk or compound that risk, and actually\nhave double the risk by doing that.\n\n379\n00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:54.198\nBut you might not have a choice, because\nyou might not have the skills in house so\n\n380\n00:22:54.198 --> 00:22:56.064\nyou might transfer it outside but\n\n381\n00:22:56.064 --> 00:22:59.740\nthere may only be one supplier\navailable to transfer it to.\n\n382\n00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.700\nSo what you're doing is you're compounding\nthe risk of something happening\n\n383\n00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.290\nalong with, and in addition to the risk\nof having just one supplier or having\n\n384\n00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.220\nall your eggs in one basket as it were.\n&gt;&gt; How does this play out\n\n385\n00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.310\nif you have some kind of regulation or\nregulatory individual who says\n\n386\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.690\nthis is how you have to do it?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n387\n00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.841\n&gt;&gt; I guess you just figure out a plan and\n\n388\n00:23:24.841 --> 00:23:27.010\nnecessary to deal with it, right?\n\n389\n00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.410\nBut if it introduces additional\nrisk that you did not have,\n\n390\n00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.394\nif it was in-house or of your choosing.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n391\n00:23:33.394 --> 00:23:37.258\nthink about I guess the latest\nregulation to come into play,\n\n392\n00:23:37.258 --> 00:23:41.216\nwhich is a big one for\neverybody at the moment, which is GDPR.\n\n393\n00:23:41.216 --> 00:23:45.949\nNow GDPR is, it's built on\nthe European Data Protection laws which is\n\n394\n00:23:45.949 --> 00:23:49.491\nsomething that we've had in Europe for\na long time.\n\n395\n00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:52.364\nIt's not something that we've\nhad in the US for a long time.\n\n396\n00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:57.052\nAnd so now that there is a risk\nthat our current suppliers,\n\n397\n00:23:57.052 --> 00:24:03.668\nsuppliers that we may have data with for\ninstance, they may not comply with GDPR.\n\n398\n00:24:03.668 --> 00:24:09.182\nAnd so we have to, at that point in time,\nwe would have to then say,\n\n399\n00:24:09.182 --> 00:24:14.511\nwell you know what,\nunfortunately we have to comply with GDPR?\n\n400\n00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:18.484\nAnd because you're keeping some of our\ndata, if you can't, it's been a great\n\n401\n00:24:18.484 --> 00:24:22.661\nrelationship, thanks very much, but\nwe're gonna have to go with somebody else.\n\n402\n00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:27.450\nBecause regulations state\nthat we have to comply.\n\n403\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:32.474\nAnd it's gonna cost us money to move\nto somebody else, it's either that,\n\n404\n00:24:32.474 --> 00:24:37.196\nor it's gonna cost you more money\nto make your databases more secure.\n\n405\n00:24:37.196 --> 00:24:42.350\nHowever, that's the situation that we're\nin, you can't get around regulations.\n\n406\n00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.902\nWell, you can, you can move out of\nthat particular industry sector, but\n\n407\n00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:49.420\nthen you might as well say goodbye to\nyour business at that point in time.\n\n408\n00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.065\nYou can't get around\nregulations no matter how hard\n\n409\n00:24:52.065 --> 00:24:55.299\nyou try.\n&gt;&gt; That seems like a maybe do\n\n410\n00:24:55.299 --> 00:24:58.045\nsomething shady, but the next risk itself.\n&gt;&gt; Let's\n\n411\n00:24:58.045 --> 00:25:00.676\nnot go there, right?\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that, I'm not saying we\n\n412\n00:25:00.676 --> 00:25:03.211\nshould, I wanna be perfectly clear.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:04.077\n&gt;&gt; Some people are like,\n\n414\n00:25:04.077 --> 00:25:04.990\nwell I could just do this.\n\n415\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:09.253\nYeah, but that in and\nof itself is a huge risk that has a high\n\n416\n00:25:09.253 --> 00:25:10.920\nprobability of.\n&gt;&gt; Going wrong.\n\n417\n00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Of causing things to go wrong.\n\n418\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n419\n00:25:15.134 --> 00:25:18.701\nBut as far as risk management goes,\nthe only thing that I can really\n\n420\n00:25:18.701 --> 00:25:22.971\ntell you about risk management is the fact\nthat you have to identify your risks,\n\n421\n00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:26.520\nthey are completely unique\nto your organization.\n\n422\n00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.649\nAnd yes when we looked in our previous\nepisode about using Google or\n\n423\n00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:35.367\nJustin's mum for that matter, for some\nadvice on what to do with our risk and\n\n424\n00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.228\nadvice on identifying risk.\n\n425\n00:25:37.228 --> 00:25:39.785\nThe simple fact is that\nno two organizations\n\n426\n00:25:39.785 --> 00:25:41.970\nare gonna be exactly the same.\n\n427\n00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:46.438\nSo your risks are going to be\nfairly unique to you and therefore,\n\n428\n00:25:46.438 --> 00:25:50.183\nyou are going to have to accommodate for\nthose risks.\n\n429\n00:25:50.183 --> 00:25:54.533\nYou're gonna have to make\ndecisions on those risks based on\n\n430\n00:25:54.533 --> 00:25:56.970\nthe needs of your organization.\n\n431\n00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.096\nSo if Justin's got no more questions,\n\n432\n00:26:01.096 --> 00:26:06.510\nthen we've actually reached the end\nof our second part of our risk theme.\n\n433\n00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:11.800\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\nwe are going to start with a part one\n\n434\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:17.215\nof the change theme and I can guarantee\nthat change will go into two episodes.\n\n435\n00:26:17.215 --> 00:26:20.715\n[LAUGH] It always does,\nit's always a big challenge to change.\n\n436\n00:26:20.715 --> 00:26:25.377\nSo, I'm gonna invite you to come back and\nwhen you see us again we'll be talking\n\n437\n00:26:25.377 --> 00:26:28.616\nabout change.\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo, I feel like I know more than\n\n438\n00:26:28.616 --> 00:26:31.880\nwhen we started on risk,\nI still have some of the terminology.\n\n439\n00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.826\nA little shaky but that's something\nthat I'm gonna have to work on myself to\n\n440\n00:26:36.826 --> 00:26:39.840\nreduce the possibility of\nJo being mad at me for\n\n441\n00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.840\ngetting terminology wrong.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n442\n00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.959\n&gt;&gt; But definitely come on back,\n\n443\n00:26:42.959 --> 00:26:45.690\nwe're gonna be talking about change but\nfor now we're gonna go ahead and\n\n444\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.680\nget out of here.\n\n445\n00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.391\nSo signing off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n446\n00:26:49.391 --> 00:26:49.990\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n447\n00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.653\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n448\n00:26:50.653 --> 00:26:53.519\n[MUSIC]\n\n449\n00:26:53.519 --> 00:26:57.047\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n450\n00:26:57.047 --> 00:27:02.471\nwatching IT Pro

00:00:06.119\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:08.124\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:11.320\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.850\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITPROTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.510\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwe're continuing on with our PRINCE2\n\n8\n00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.260\n2017 Foundation Series and we're\ncontinuing our discussion about themes.\n\n9\n00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.100\nIn particular in this episode we're gonna\nbe talking about the change theme and here\n\n10\n00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.370\nto help maybe change my mind about all of\nthis is the one and only Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.510\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great,\nthank you Justin, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.470\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and well,\n\n14\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.890\nI just wanna say where I'm from\nmost people say change is bad.\n\n15\n00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.490\nSo I don't know if we're talking\nabout overarching social change or\n\n16\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.680\nactually talking about change within\na project or an organization, right?\n\n17\n00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.350\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna try and\nchange the world, all right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.160\nI mean, once upon a time\nmaybe I would have done, and\n\n19\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.590\nI can change my little portion.\n\n20\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.120\nBut I'm not too sure that\nI could change everything.\n\n21\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.830\nI mean, I could try but you know what?\n\n22\n00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.540\nProbably not on this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI don't think we have quite enough time.\n\n24\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.150\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so, no.\n\n25\n00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.040\nWe've got about 25 minutes and I don't\nthink we've got enough time for this.\n\n26\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.880\nNow, what we're gonna do is we gonna\ntalk about change within a project.\n\n27\n00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:24.980\nI don't really wanna call them negative,\nbut\n\n28\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.120\nI guess they are, I've heard some negative\nthings said about change within a project.\n\n29\n00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.610\nWe use terminology like scope creek, and\n\n30\n00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.330\nshifting goal posts, and that's pretty\nmuch got a negative connotation.\n\n31\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.160\nAnd it's something that, well,\n\n32\n00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.749\nyou probably come across it in every\nsingle project that you've ever been on.\n\n33\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.400\n&gt;&gt; I have and I think it has to do\nwith the context on how to present it.\n\n34\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n35\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.180\n&gt;&gt; Now, what I mean is if it's random,\nhaphazard scope creep or\n\n36\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.150\nchanging goal posts with no justification,\nno backing, no evaluation,\n\n37\n00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.005\nno reflection on why we're doing these\nthings, drives me absolutely mad.\n\n38\n00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:07.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; However,\n\n39\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.480\nat the end of a certain time period\nyou go, we found out some things,\n\n40\n00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.350\nthat this isn't quite gonna work, so\nwe're gonna have to go over here.\n\n41\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.140\nOr you know what,\nthe customer said I don't like blue.\n\n42\n00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.920\nIf we have justification,\nI usually coped with it fairly well.\n\n43\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.790\n&gt;&gt; Right but that wasn't the question.\n\n44\n00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.340\n&gt;&gt; Here we go again.\n\n45\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.845\n&gt;&gt; What was the acronym, Justin?\n\n46\n00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:35.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The acronym, wait a minute.\n\n47\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.400\nRTFQ, read the full question.\n\n48\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.910\n&gt;&gt; Read the full question.\n\n49\n00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.370\nYep, that's something that you'll learn\nto take into your test, isn't it?\n\n50\n00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.795\n&gt;&gt; I don't even remember\nwhat the question was.\n\n51\n00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:49.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought I was answering the question\n\n52\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.712\nand then you said no.\n\n53\n00:02:51.712 --> 00:02:54.850\n[LAUGH] So I don't even know.\n\n54\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.140\n&gt;&gt; What I said was was scope\ncreeper was changing goal posts\n\n55\n00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.460\neither something you've come across\nin your and your project experience.\n\n56\n00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.670\nAnd then you went on to say, well yeah,\nbut if it's authorized, it's okay.\n\n57\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.690\nAnd I don't mind that.\n\n58\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.340\nWhen it's not authorized,\nthen I don't think it, but\n\n59\n00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.990\nI don't care about that cuz that wasn't\nthe question that I asked you, right?\n\n60\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.660\n&gt;&gt; I said yes but\n\n61\n00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.390\nprevious to that, you talked about\nhow it had a negative connotation.\n\n62\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.060\nAnd I was provided some perspective,\nfrom my own about yes, a lot of\n\n63\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.340\ntimes it does have negative connotations\nbut only for me when this occurs.\n\n64\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.920\n&gt;&gt; You just-\n&gt;&gt; And I'm just gonna leave it there.\n\n65\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.550\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nyou just filed that question though.\n\n66\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.430\nYou're not setting a very good example.\n\n67\n00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.540\n&gt;&gt; No hold on.\n\n68\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.620\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying.\n\n69\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.980\n&gt;&gt; I teach by counter example.\n\n70\n00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.302\nListen, I'm showing you what not to do.\n\n71\n00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:47.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.216\n&gt;&gt; This is how to fail a test.\n\n73\n00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.181\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Real good.\n\n74\n00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:53.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n75\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.170\nWe don't want you to be failing tests,\nall right?\n\n76\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.710\nWe really don't want that.\n\n77\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.120\nOkay, the question that\nI asked was really,\n\n78\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.120\nhave you ever been in a project\nthat has had any, and\n\n79\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.960\nthe fact of the matter is we've all\nbeen in projects that have had change.\n\n80\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.590\nNow change can be a bad thing.\n\n81\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.490\nChange can be a good thing.\n\n82\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.410\nLet's take a look at this purpose\nof the change theme here within\n\n83\n00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.270\nproject management.\n\n84\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.030\nAnd the purpose of the change theme is\nactually to identify, identify changes,\n\n85\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.860\nassess them, control them.\n\n86\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.280\nWell, there's also approval as well,\ncuz it says control any potential and\n\n87\n00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.500\napproved changes to the project baseline.\n\n88\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.100\nLet's dissect this for a minute.\n\n89\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.210\nWhat do we mean by baseline?\n\n90\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.110\n&gt;&gt; I read this, and this is a similar\nstatement to the risk theme.\n\n91\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.035\nAnd I was, man,\nI'm about to be taken to task again.\n\n92\n00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what I think,\n\n93\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.510\nthis is an initial measurement of,\nwhere are we right now?\n\n94\n00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.580\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah.\n\n95\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.770\nA baseline is a snapshot\nof where we are right now,\n\n96\n00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.050\nso it's a snapshot of our current state.\n\n97\n00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.607\nSo what do we mean by\na project baseline now?\n\n98\n00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:09.266\n&gt;&gt; How we're making,\nwait a minute, wait a minute,\n\n99\n00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:13.410\nwait a minute,\nhow are we making progress or?\n\n100\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.190\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; No, so in case you're wondering,\n\n101\n00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.800\nhere's how I answer this question.\n\n102\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.000\nI start saying things until Jo stops\ngiving me the stink eye, and then I go,\n\n103\n00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.090\nall right.\n\n104\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.790\nI'm under it.\n\n105\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.970\n&gt;&gt; That's not gonna be that one.\n\n106\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.850\n&gt;&gt; But what are we trying to\naccomplish for this respective project?\n\n107\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.700\nThe project baseline is that\nwe have committed to deliver,\n\n109\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.040\nthat's our project baseline.\n\n110\n00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.450\nSo our project baseline is yeah,\nwhat do we want to accomplish?\n\n111\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.650\nIt's what the output looks like,\nthat's our project baseline.\n\n112\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.160\nAnd so the purpose of this\nChange Theme then is to identify\n\n113\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.060\nwhere that baseline is changed.\n\n114\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.010\nSo it's to identify and\napprove scope creep.\n\n115\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.970\nSo it's to identify and approve when\nthings have changed, to the project.\n\n116\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.670\nThis is not about change\nmanagement that you all know and\n\n117\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.100\nlove that deals with change\nin a live environment.\n\n118\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.130\nThis is not about, well, we are gonna\nstart talking about changing CIs.\n\n119\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.230\nWe're gonna talk about configuration\nitems, and these are things that,\n\n120\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.740\nobviously, you know about from\nthe live production environment.\n\n121\n00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.820\nBut we're not changing the live\nproduction environment,\n\n122\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.750\nwell not just yet anyway, we will be\nimplementing change management in order to\n\n123\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.790\ntransition the project\ninto the live environment.\n\n124\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.240\nBut this is not the same.\n\n125\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.330\nThe changed theme is to identify,\nassess, and\n\n126\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.210\ncontrol potential and\napproved changes to the project.\n\n127\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.447\nNot the change where we transition\ninto the live environment,\n\n128\n00:06:52.447 --> 00:06:57.840\nbecause that's covered by change\nmanagement as opposed to the change theme.\n\n129\n00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.530\nIs that clear?\n\n130\n00:06:59.693 --> 00:07:03.302\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with foggy but\n\n131\n00:07:03.302 --> 00:07:05.730\nI'm running lights.\n\n132\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.110\nI think it'll become clearer as\nwe continue to talk about it.\n\n133\n00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But this is not necessarily\n\n134\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.110\nsomething that I've been entrenched in\na great deal so I'll chalk it up to that.\n\n135\n00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.160\n&gt;&gt; And this is gonna become\na lot clearer as we move\n\n136\n00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.140\nthrough the rest of this\nparticular series as well.\n\n137\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.340\nBecause once we start talking about\nour stages and our project stages, and\n\n138\n00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.280\nwe get to the close in a project stage.\n\n139\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.030\nThat's when we start talking\nabout change management and\n\n140\n00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.720\nmaking changes to the live environment.\n\n141\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.425\nIn other words, transitioning that\nproduct into the live environment.\n\n142\n00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:42.095\nWhich is different to what\nwe're talking about here,\n\n143\n00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:46.724\nwhich is identifying things that\nhave changed in the requirements or\n\n144\n00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:51.935\nthings that have changed in the way that\nwe are going to approach the project.\n\n145\n00:07:51.935 --> 00:07:56.215\nOr the way that we're actually\ngoing to develop the project.\n\n146\n00:07:56.215 --> 00:07:58.175\nSo, the first concept.\n\n147\n00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.540\nThat I want to bring in.\n\n148\n00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.856\nAnd this is something that you\nneed to remember for your test,\n\n149\n00:08:04.856 --> 00:08:09.570\nas well as the RTFQ,\nyou need to remember this for your test.\n\n150\n00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.710\nAnd the fact is, that in PRINCE2,\nwe don't call it a change.\n\n151\n00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.160\nWe call it an issue.\n\n152\n00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.319\nAnd there's a reason why we do that.\n\n153\n00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:24.851\nAnd that is, it's really to allow\nus to differentiate between change,\n\n154\n00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:28.115\nwhich is a change to the live environment,\n\n155\n00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:34.750\nwhich is managed by change management,\nand changes to the project baseline.\n\n156\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.055\nAnd issue is any event that's happened,\n\n157\n00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:42.499\nit wasn't planned, and\nrequires management action.\n\n158\n00:08:42.499 --> 00:08:48.680\nNow, an RFC, or a request for change to\nmake changes to the project, is an issue.\n\n159\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.149\nYeah, I know, I know,\nI knew that this was going to happen.\n\n160\n00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:56.489\nAnd this is why right\nat the very beginning,\n\n161\n00:08:56.489 --> 00:09:00.474\nthis is why I said this is\ngoing to take two episodes.\n\n162\n00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:03.775\nBecause this one's quite a bit\nto get your head around.\n\n163\n00:09:03.775 --> 00:09:06.706\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n164\n00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:10.920\nthis is one of of those things\nI where I was like, I get it.\n\n165\n00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.525\nAn issue is the possibility of change.\n\n166\n00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:15.757\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But then when it's actually, yes.\n\n167\n00:09:15.757 --> 00:09:19.095\nNo that's not what you're saying,\n\n168\n00:09:19.095 --> 00:09:24.047\nan issue in this capacity for\na project is the change and\n\n169\n00:09:24.047 --> 00:09:29.550\nRFC request for change is an issue,\nI'm gonna mess that up.\n\n170\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.875\nI'm not going to lie to you.\n\n171\n00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:34.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's a couple of things\nhere that's definitely confusing and\n\n172\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.760\ncertainly on this particular slide.\n\n173\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.778\nAnd this is the way that it's explained\nin PRINCE2, in the actual manual itself.\n\n174\n00:09:41.778 --> 00:09:45.110\nAnd I'm gonna try and\nmake it as clear as I possibly can to you.\n\n175\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.650\nRead the definition of an issue.\n\n176\n00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.110\nBy the way, please, please,\nplease, please, please, please,\n\n177\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.290\nplease, did I put enough pleases in there?\n\n178\n00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.040\nPlease remember this\ndefinition of an issue.\n\n179\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.805\nYou might get a question that just says,\nwhat is an issue?\n\n180\n00:10:00.805 --> 00:10:02.536\nJust as a hint, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:07.470\nCuz this is one that we find it difficult\nto get our heads around sometimes.\n\n182\n00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.359\nAs Justin is struggling with.\n\n183\n00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:10.259\nAnd by the way,\n\n184\n00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:14.425\nI didn't set Justin up to find it\ndifficult to get his head around this.\n\n185\n00:10:14.425 --> 00:10:18.720\nThis is something that\ngenuinely does need explaining.\n\n186\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.262\nAn issue is anything that's happened,\nwas not\n\n187\n00:10:23.262 --> 00:10:27.670\nplanned, and\nthen needs us to do something about it.\n\n188\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.125\nNow here's an interesting one,\n\n189\n00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:33.675\nbecause then it say underneath\nthere that an issue type is an RFC.\n\n190\n00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:38.720\nAnd a request for change is, well,\nwe call it a change record, maybe.\n\n191\n00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.110\nBut that's planned, surely isn't it?\n\n192\n00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.020\nAnd yet, the definition of an issue\nis something that's not planned.\n\n193\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:52.660\n&gt;&gt; So, in order to reconcile this,\nI get how I would reconcile.\n\n194\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.566\nIt's planned if during the project\ndesign you say, there is a research\n\n195\n00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:02.330\nstage where at the end of this we\nknow we may have to change something.\n\n196\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.096\nIs that planned?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n197\n00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Am I overthinking this?\n\n198\n00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.656\n&gt;&gt; You are heading off down\nthe complete wrong garden path here.\n\n199\n00:11:08.656 --> 00:11:10.390\nAnd I don't want you to do that,\n\n200\n00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.410\nso I'm gonna stop you right now\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n201\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.264\n&gt;&gt; Because it's just gonna\nconfuse everybody else, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:14.264 --> 00:11:21.220\nAn issue is an event that wasn't\nplanned at the start of the project.\n\n203\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.930\nIt's not what we wanted.\n\n204\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:28.120\nRight at the very start, remember what we\ntalked about about our project baselines.\n\n205\n00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.609\nIt wasn't planned as part\nof the project planning.\n\n206\n00:11:31.609 --> 00:11:37.993\nSo when the customer, user, business,\nfirst came to us and said, I want an iPad.\n\n207\n00:11:37.993 --> 00:11:42.520\nWhat they said to us was, I want an iPad.\n\n208\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.840\nSo we planned for an iPad.\n\n209\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:53.340\nAnd now they decided they want a,\nwhat do we call that thing?\n\n210\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.100\nSurface, that's it.\n\n211\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.937\nNow they've decided, I'm trying to think.\n\n212\n00:11:56.937 --> 00:12:00.788\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell Cherokee.\n\n213\n00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:04.640\n[LAUGH] But\nnow they decided that they want a Surface.\n\n214\n00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.920\nThat wasn't planned.\n\n215\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.010\nWe didn't plan for a Surface tablet.\n\n216\n00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.310\nWe planned for an iPad, so\nwe raise an RFC, a request for\n\n217\n00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.500\nchange, to say, I want to change the plan.\n\n218\n00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.690\nI want to change the product\nthat's being delivered, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.370\nThat's what we mean.\n\n220\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.430\nDoes that make sense now?\n\n221\n00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.817\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense right now,\nwhile you're explaining it to me, but\n\n222\n00:12:32.817 --> 00:12:35.967\nI would probably still mess it\nup if you came back to me later.\n\n223\n00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:40.092\nI almost feel like I'm setting something\nup for either this episode or later.\n\n224\n00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:42.201\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, if you come back to me,\n\n225\n00:12:42.201 --> 00:12:44.674\nI'm gonna go, I don't remember.\n\n226\n00:12:44.674 --> 00:12:47.720\nBut I think it's just gonna\ntake a little while to sink in.\n\n227\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.830\n&gt;&gt; It does, it does.\n\n228\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.790\nAnd this is why, like I said,\nright at the beginning,\n\n229\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:55.925\nI wanted us to take two episodes\nto really go through this,\n\n230\n00:12:55.925 --> 00:12:58.570\nbecause I really need\nyou to understand this.\n\n231\n00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.890\nSo an issue is something\nthat we didn't plan for\n\n232\n00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.910\nat the beginning, when we planned,\nwhen we prepared, and\n\n233\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:10.080\nwhen we agreed our project baseline, we\ndidn't prepare for this at the beginning.\n\n234\n00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.941\nAnd an issue is a change to that.\n\n235\n00:13:13.941 --> 00:13:18.311\nWhether it's of specification or whether\nit's as a result of a problem because\n\n236\n00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:21.480\nsomething happened and\nnow we need to fix it.\n\n237\n00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.020\nOr whether it's as\na result of a new request.\n\n238\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.330\nIn other words,\ncan I have something different?\n\n239\n00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.581\nThey are all issues.\n\n240\n00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:30.381\nAnd a new request,\ncan I have something different?\n\n241\n00:13:30.381 --> 00:13:32.529\nCan I have a change?\n\n242\n00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:34.620\nThat's an RFC.\n\n243\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.210\nThat's, can I have\nthe something different?\n\n244\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.939\nAnd of course, it's a change too.\n\n245\n00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:43.490\nAn issue is just a change to the baseline.\n\n246\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.735\nWe've got another description there, and\nwe've got a configuration item record.\n\n247\n00:13:52.191 --> 00:13:57.046\nNow, there's a little asterisk at\nthe bottom of this particular slide,\n\n248\n00:13:57.046 --> 00:14:00.685\nand it says,\nsee also ITL: Service Transition.\n\n249\n00:14:00.685 --> 00:14:03.315\nWe've got an episode on\nITL service transition.\n\n250\n00:14:03.315 --> 00:14:05.655\nThere's also a book on\nITL service transition.\n\n251\n00:14:05.655 --> 00:14:10.395\nAnd the reason why it says see also\nITL Service Transition is because both\n\n252\n00:14:10.395 --> 00:14:15.020\nCIs and RFCs are covered\nin the service transition.\n\n253\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:20.271\nWell, we've got a complete series\non both change management and\n\n254\n00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:26.330\nconfiguration management in service\ntransition, and in the ITL series.\n\n255\n00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.530\nNow, what I want you to\ndo is if you're really,\n\n256\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:34.020\nreally not sure,\nthen go back to your ITL series.\n\n257\n00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.079\nTake a look at the service transition\nseries and then pay very close attention\n\n258\n00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:42.152\nto both change management and service\nasset and configuration management.\n\n259\n00:14:42.152 --> 00:14:47.763\nBecause they will give you a lot more\ndetail, or in that series, I'll give\n\n260\n00:14:47.763 --> 00:14:53.870\nyou a lot more detail descriptions of what\na change is, an RFC and what a CI is.\n\n261\n00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:59.090\nA configuration item is\nthe item of our configuration\n\n262\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.590\nof our infrastructure, basically.\n\n263\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.980\nSo that laptop is a CI.\n\n264\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.860\nThis laptop is a CI, a configuration item.\n\n265\n00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.180\nAnd a CI record, well,\n\n266\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.700\nthat's the record of that CI in\nthe configuration management database.\n\n267\n00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:22.700\nSo all of our CIs will have an asset\nnumber on them, for instance.\n\n268\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.372\nAnd the CI record makes\nreference to that asset number.\n\n269\n00:15:27.372 --> 00:15:29.983\nAnd then it stores all of the data,\n\n270\n00:15:29.983 --> 00:15:35.490\nall of the attributes of that\nparticular CI, that configuration item.\n\n271\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.860\nYou might ask, what that's got\nto do with project management?\n\n272\n00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.634\nAnd I understand that.\n\n273\n00:15:40.634 --> 00:15:43.988\nYou're gonna say, well, that's ITL, it's\ngot absolutely nothing to do with PRINCE2,\n\n274\n00:15:43.988 --> 00:15:45.720\nnothing to do with project management.\n\n275\n00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.030\nYes, it does.\n\n276\n00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:54.251\nBecause when you are compiling a product,\nwhen you are releasing a product and\n\n277\n00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:58.520\ntransitioning it into\nthe live environment,\n\n278\n00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:05.720\nNot only are you effecting a change,\nbut you are also releasing CIs.\n\n279\n00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.430\nWhether you're releasing software or\nwhether you're releasing hardware,\n\n280\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.980\nyou are releasing CIs into\nthe live environment.\n\n281\n00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.134\nAnd therefore,\n\n282\n00:16:15.134 --> 00:16:20.990\nyou need to be updating the CI records in\nthe configuration management database, or\n\n283\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:26.941\nin your configuration management system\nif you have multiple federated databases.\n\n284\n00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:33.639\nIf there's anything there that you\ndon't quite understand in these\n\n285\n00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:38.508\nparticular definitions,\nif you don't understand the term baseline,\n\n286\n00:16:38.508 --> 00:16:43.374\nif you don't understand the term CI,\nor you want further clarification\n\n287\n00:16:43.374 --> 00:16:48.560\non the term Change or RFC, then please\ntake a look at our ITIL series.\n\n288\n00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.420\nWe've got quite a few series\nwithin the ITIL subsection,\n\n289\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.390\ngo take a look at our ITIL landing page.\n\n290\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.757\nIn Foundation, you will see a couple\nof episodes on Service Transition, and\n\n291\n00:17:00.757 --> 00:17:04.200\nthat's gonna give you a very,\nvery high-level view.\n\n292\n00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.770\nGo into the Service Transition series, and\n\n293\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.610\nyou will see some episodes\non Change Management and\n\n294\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.120\nsome episodes of Service Asset and\nConfiguration Management.\n\n295\n00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.273\nAnd they're the episodes that you wanna\nconcentrate on if you want further\n\n296\n00:17:16.273 --> 00:17:17.970\nclarification.\n\n297\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.562\nI don't want you to dismiss that, okay?\n\n298\n00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:26.709\nI really, really, really don't want you,\nand to be honest, in terms of your test,\n\n299\n00:17:26.709 --> 00:17:30.427\nplease don't just think ITIL's\ngot nothing to do with you and\n\n300\n00:17:30.427 --> 00:17:33.878\ntherefore it doesn't matter,\nbecause it does matter.\n\n301\n00:17:33.878 --> 00:17:36.073\nAnd certainly when it comes\nto your Practitioner,\n\n302\n00:17:36.073 --> 00:17:37.560\nyou will be expected to know this.\n\n303\n00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.380\nAnd if you don't understand those\nparticular concepts, you're not going to\n\n304\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.210\nbe able to apply the PRINCE2 project\nmanagement methodology without\n\n305\n00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:50.738\nunderstanding what it is that you're\napplying into the live environment, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:50.738 --> 00:17:55.620\nSo please, that's just sort\nof a almost begging there,\n\n307\n00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.420\nbut go back and take a look at\nthose episodes, they will help you.\n\n308\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.140\nI'm going to take a look at\nthis particular slide then now.\n\n309\n00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:09.021\nAnd you'll see that Change, and\nI'm not calling it change management,\n\n310\n00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:10.845\nI'm calling it the Change theme.\n\n311\n00:18:10.845 --> 00:18:14.912\nAnd I'm deliberately not\ncalling it change management,\n\n312\n00:18:14.912 --> 00:18:19.850\ncuz I do not want you to be\nconfused with change management.\n\n313\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.200\nChange is about making a change\nto what we're going to deliver\n\n314\n00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.887\nto the project, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.050\nNow, we've already looked at the bottom\nright-hand corner there because we've\n\n316\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.940\ntalked about the types of issues.\n\n317\n00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.940\nBut we have to define in\nthe top right-hand corner,\n\n318\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.210\nwe have to define what an issue looks\nlike, how an issue is reported,\n\n319\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:45.600\nhow an issue is authorized, and\nhow we change the baseline.\n\n320\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.620\nSo how we record the current baseline and\nthen make a change once we\n\n321\n00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:56.000\nhave accepted and\napproved that particular issue.\n\n322\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.400\nAnd that would be part of then what\nwe'd call our change control procedure,\n\n323\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.820\nwhich is capturing issues, assessing them,\nand then deciding what to do about them,\n\n324\n00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.990\nand deciding whether they're\ngoing to be approved.\n\n325\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.750\nAnd then in that top left-hand corner\nthen, I want us to think about roles and\n\n326\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.690\nresponsibilities and\nthe fact that people have got to not\n\n327\n00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:23.620\njust identify any issues, but we've\nalso got to have somebody that's going\n\n328\n00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:29.250\nto authorize those issues and authorize\ntheir acceptance into the project plan.\n\n329\n00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.720\nAnd then we're going to have people\nthat are actually, like our developers,\n\n330\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.520\nthat are actually going to\nincorporate those issues and\n\n331\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.485\nincorporate the changes into\nthe project plan, okay?\n\n332\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.340\nSo I'm gonna ask Justin right now,\ndoes that kinda make sense to you?\n\n333\n00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.240\n&gt;&gt; It does,\nI was just sitting here thinking,\n\n334\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:54.720\nI'm really gonna have to be specific in\nhow I think about the word issue, though.\n\n335\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.770\nBecause you just talking now, you're like,\nwell, they're gonna integrate,\n\n336\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.440\nthey're gonna implement, but\n\n337\n00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.370\nwhen I say the word issue-\n&gt;&gt; It's got a negative connotation, right?\n\n338\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.030\n&gt;&gt; It's like, something bad has happened.\n\n339\n00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.677\nIt's almost more akin to a risk event,\n\n340\n00:20:09.677 --> 00:20:14.380\nlike something bad went wrong\nthan necessarily a change.\n\n341\n00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, well-\n&gt;&gt; And I understand why they've chosen\n\n342\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:23.620\nto pick, to say, this is what we're gonna\ntalk about and give it another definition,\n\n343\n00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.940\nso that's handy.\n\n344\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.072\nIt's just my everyday usage of the word,\nissue,\n\n345\n00:20:28.072 --> 00:20:30.466\nit kinda puts my mind in a weird place.\n\n346\n00:20:30.466 --> 00:20:32.644\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say, yeah, and I get that.\n\n347\n00:20:32.644 --> 00:20:36.321\nThink of it like this, okay,\nand this is the best way for\n\n348\n00:20:36.321 --> 00:20:38.294\nyou to think about it as well.\n\n349\n00:20:38.294 --> 00:20:42.039\nThink about it like this, an issue's\nsomething we have to deal with, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:48.000\nSo in that way you kinda, what I'm\ntrying to do is kinda making a bridge\n\n351\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.580\nbetween where you are with the negative\nplace, and the request for change,\n\n352\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.360\nwhich is more of a, I'd like to do this.\n\n353\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.730\nYeah, so think about an issue as being\nsomething you have to deal with.\n\n354\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.924\nDoes that kinda make sense?\n\n355\n00:21:00.924 --> 00:21:03.370\nDoes that sort of appease?\n\n356\n00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.821\n&gt;&gt; That does, I'm just gonna have to trick\nmy brain and go, you gotta deal with it,\n\n357\n00:21:07.821 --> 00:21:11.960\nit's not necessarily a bad,\nit's just something you gotta deal with.\n\n358\n00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.635\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna have to think of it very\n\n359\n00:21:13.635 --> 00:21:14.266\nconsciously.\n\n360\n00:21:14.266 --> 00:21:17.560\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwhat I'm gonna do right now is, and\n\n361\n00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.450\nI did say that we're gonna take this\none into a Part Two, because in\n\n362\n00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.370\norder to look at the change process\nitself, or to look at the actual theme,\n\n363\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.050\nand to look at what we do with Change,\nwe're gonna come back in Part Two.\n\n364\n00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.890\nBecause what I wanna give you opportunity\nto do is kind of digest that,\n\n365\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.860\ndownload the material that\nyou have available to you.\n\n366\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:45.100\nTake a look at maybe at our ITIL series,\nand see what's said in Service Transition\n\n367\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.650\nabout change management, and about an RFC,\nand about configuration items.\n\n368\n00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.140\nBecause when we come back in Part Two, I'm\nnot gonna sort of redefine any of that,\n\n369\n00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.830\nwhat we're gonna do in Part Two is\nwe're just gonna look at the activities\n\n370\n00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.430\nthat have to happen\nwithin the Change theme.\n\n371\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.440\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, it seems like I've got a\nlittle bit of homework before we come back\n\n372\n00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.828\nfor Part Two, and you probably need\nto go do those things that she said.\n\n373\n00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:12.310\nCheck out ITIL, look at those\ndownloadable materials, because if\n\n374\n00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.990\nyou're anything like me, well, those word\nchoices will get you a little bit twisted.\n\n375\n00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.331\nBut definitely come on back cuz we're\ngonna continue on talking about\n\n376\n00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:19.973\nthe Change theme.\n\n377\n00:22:19.973 --> 00:22:23.000\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n378\n00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.940\nSo, signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n379\n00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n380\n00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.519\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n381\n00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:34.383\n[MUSIC]\n\n382\n00:22:34.383 --> 00:22:36.905\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.177\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.177 --> 00:00:11.712\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:15.051\n&gt;&gt; Greeting everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:20.383\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\nwe're back with Prince2 2017 Foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:26.071\nAnd well, we're continuing on with part\ntwo in our change theme and you know what?\n\n8\n00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:27.281\nWe assigned you a little bit of homework.\n\n9\n00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:29.972\nI tried to do mine and\nhopefully you did yours,\n\n10\n00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:32.601\ncuz we're gonna continue that discussion.\n\n11\n00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:36.008\nAnd here to help us with that continuation\nof the discussion, is the one and only Ms.\n\n12\n00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:36.541\nJo Peacock.\n\n13\n00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:37.910\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n\n14\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, great.\nThank you, Justin.\n\n15\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.905\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n16\n00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:46.358\nThe whole time I'm talking,\na lot of times Jo's giving me these looks,\n\n17\n00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.780\nI don't know if I'm doing good or not.\n\n18\n00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.643\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I guess she'll tell me if I need\n\n19\n00:00:50.643 --> 00:00:54.410\nto change something and we'll kind\nof have a pow-wow over it, right?\n\n20\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well if you need to change\nsomething then I'll raise an RFC, and\n\n21\n00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.820\nnow that you've done your homework\nyou know what that is, right?\n\n22\n00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.612\n&gt;&gt; That's a request for change.\n\n23\n00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:04.761\n&gt;&gt; Hey, see, see, it does work sometimes,\n\n24\n00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:08.800\nI can assign some homework and\nactually he might do it.\n\n25\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.270\nI mean that's a risk in itself.\n\n26\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.314\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Again that goes back to our previous\n\n27\n00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:13.560\nepisode, right?\n\n28\n00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.260\nOkay, so\ncan you remember what we called a change?\n\n29\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.893\n&gt;&gt; It was an issue.\n\n30\n00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:22.600\n&gt;&gt; It was an issue, right, it was.\n\n31\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.340\nI'm impressed.\n\n32\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.675\n&gt;&gt; And furthermore, an event that\noccurs that was not planned for,\n\n33\n00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:34.140\nthat requires admin, or\na management intervention?\n\n34\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so not planned for where?\n\n35\n00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.790\n&gt;&gt; At the beginning of the project?\n\n36\n00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, as part of the project plan.\n\n37\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.562\nYep, exactly, so it wasn't part\nof the original project baseline,\n\n38\n00:01:45.562 --> 00:01:47.230\nthat's what we're saying.\n\n39\n00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.140\nAnd we took a look just sort of\nas we left on our last episode,\n\n40\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.950\nwe took a look at this\nparticular slide in front of us.\n\n41\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.820\nDo you remember this one?\n\n42\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.040\nThis was the confusing one I guess or the\ncomplex one, should I say, not confusing.\n\n43\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this one is not too bad cuz it's\nvery similar to our other themes where you\n\n44\n00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.455\ngo, okay, here are all the things that\nneed to come under consideration.\n\n45\n00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:13.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.440\n&gt;&gt; It took me a little while to wrap\nmy head around some of the verbiage.\n\n47\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.737\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthis is why I wanted you to go away and\n\n48\n00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:20.350\njust do a little bit of research.\n\n49\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.333\nDownload the materials, but\nalso do a little bit of research into what\n\n50\n00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:28.720\nan RFC is,\nwhat a configuration item or a CI is.\n\n51\n00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.036\nAnd the difference between a CI and\na CI record, which is of course,\n\n52\n00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:37.230\nthe form where we describe all of\nthe attributes of a specific CI.\n\n53\n00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.960\nAnd a CI is of course what you're going to\nbe deploying into the live environment.\n\n54\n00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.822\nSo now that we've taken a look at that\ndiagram again, and this is all available\n\n55\n00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:51.640\nin your downloadable material,\nI want you to take a look at this, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.160\nNow this one is,\nI know that this is small.\n\n57\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.930\nThis is going to be easy for you, in your\ndownloadable material, but you know what?\n\n58\n00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.140\nIt's in purple and\nyou know what that means?\n\n59\n00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.990\n&gt;&gt; It's from the Prince2 book.\n\n60\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.490\n&gt;&gt; It's from the Prince2 book,\nyep, exactly that, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.240\n&gt;&gt; I'm learning things.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It was in purple,\n\n62\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.250\nit's from the Prince2 book,\n\n63\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.630\nwhich means that you have this available\nto you if you have got your Prince2 book.\n\n64\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.705\nNow I know that your Prince2 2017 book,\nyou won't need necessarily for\n\n65\n00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:25.800\nyour foundation tests, you will need\nit for your practitioner test though.\n\n66\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.425\nSo I would definitely\nrecommend that you go out and\n\n67\n00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:33.060\nyou obtain a copy of\nthat Prince2 2017 book.\n\n68\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.546\nYou'll see here, that what we have\nis a change control technique,\n\n69\n00:03:38.546 --> 00:03:41.250\nand what I want to start off with.\n\n70\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.590\nTake a look in the purple\nboxes that go along the top.\n\n71\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.465\nWhere we capture, where we assess,\nwhere we propose, where we decide, and\n\n72\n00:03:49.465 --> 00:03:51.498\nwhere we implement the change.\n\n73\n00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:56.070\nAlong the bottom with every single change.\n\n74\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.410\nOnce we capture the issue as we call it.\n\n75\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.220\nOnce we capture it, you will see that\nwe determine the priority of it.\n\n76\n00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.250\nIn other words, well, based on impact and\nurgency, is it needed?\n\n77\n00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.770\nWhat is the impact to the project and\nwhat about the urgency?\n\n78\n00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.490\nAnd then we log the issue in our\ndaily log or in our issue register,\n\n79\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.590\nwhatever you want to call it and\nthen we assess this issue.\n\n80\n00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.526\nAnd we assess it on impact on the project\nitself, from the project objectives,\n\n81\n00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:34.340\nwe assess it for\nimpact on the business case.\n\n82\n00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.300\nBecause of course the business cases are\ncontinual justification for the project.\n\n83\n00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.029\nSo we need to make sure that if we\nare accommodating any issues and\n\n84\n00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:50.470\nif we're making changes to the project\nitself, into the deliverables.\n\n85\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.415\nThen we have got to ensure that the\nbusiness case therefore justifies those\n\n86\n00:04:55.415 --> 00:04:57.700\namendments to the deliverables.\n\n87\n00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.828\nAnd again, we wanna check and\n\n88\n00:04:59.828 --> 00:05:04.720\nwe wanna validate that\npriority that we've assigned.\n\n89\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.465\nIf we make any changes to the issue,\n\n90\n00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:12.510\nthen we update the issue register,\nand that's when we propose.\n\n91\n00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.431\nSo now we've done the preliminary work,\n\n92\n00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:18.940\nwe've done almost\nthe evaluation of the change.\n\n93\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.470\nWe've got all of the issue rather, we've\ngot all of the information that we need.\n\n94\n00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.640\nNow we're gonna identify what\nwe can do about that issue.\n\n95\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.749\nSo this is why we talk\nabout identifying options,\n\n96\n00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.050\nit's what we can do about the issue.\n\n97\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.210\nAnd then we make recommendations to\nimplement a solution to that issue.\n\n98\n00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.520\nAnd that's when we make the decision.\n\n99\n00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.210\nThe decision is yes, we're going to do it,\nso we approve it or we reject it or\n\n100\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.220\nmaybe even we defer it.\n\n101\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.000\nAnd we leave it to a later management\nstage in the project perhaps,\n\n102\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.180\nsomething that is an option and\nwe escalate it if we need to.\n\n103\n00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.392\nYou'll notice that there\nare a couple of arrows that\n\n104\n00:06:04.392 --> 00:06:08.470\ngo back up to the project board or\nto the change authority.\n\n105\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.010\nThe project board are the, well they're\nour governments board for our project.\n\n106\n00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.143\nAnd so the project board are going\nto help us to identify the severity,\n\n107\n00:06:19.143 --> 00:06:21.840\nto identify the impact of any issue.\n\n108\n00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.148\nThey may have even requested\na particular issue, and\n\n109\n00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:33.710\nthe change authority is the person that is\ngoing to approve that particular issue.\n\n110\n00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.150\nAnd then once we've got a decision from\nthem, then we implement that issue.\n\n111\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.690\nSo we take the corrective action,\nas it says.\n\n112\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.588\nNow, the term corrective\naction is not one that sort of\n\n113\n00:06:46.588 --> 00:06:49.580\nfills me with joy, should I say.\n\n114\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.206\nBecause sometimes things are in RFC and\nthat's a request, and\n\n115\n00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:54.790\nit's not to fix a problem.\n\n116\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.940\nAnd therefore,\nthat issue is not necessarily negative.\n\n117\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.173\nAnd I know that we had a discussion\nin our previous episode about\n\n118\n00:07:01.173 --> 00:07:03.920\nsort of the negative\nconnotations of the word issue.\n\n119\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.138\nAnd I said to you, well, think of an issue\nof something that's gotta be action,\n\n120\n00:07:08.138 --> 00:07:09.950\nsomething that's got to be done.\n\n121\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.980\nIt's not necessarily negative,\n\n122\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.480\nwhereas then start talking\nabout corrective action.\n\n123\n00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.750\nWell we take corrective if\nit's saying negative issue.\n\n124\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.633\nBut we might also take corrective action,\n\n125\n00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:24.420\nif we've chosen to defer that\nparticular issue for instance.\n\n126\n00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.353\nSo if we've chosen to defer it,\nthe corrective action would be\n\n127\n00:07:29.353 --> 00:07:34.390\nto update the issue register with\na deferral date for instance.\n\n128\n00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.681\nIn terms of sort of continuance\nabout change control technique,\n\n129\n00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:46.670\nhere again, we've got another\ndiagram from our Prince2 manual.\n\n130\n00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.420\nAnd you'll see here that\nwe've got a balance.\n\n131\n00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.226\nChanges are not automatically approved,\n\n132\n00:07:53.226 --> 00:07:56.049\nissues are not automatically\ngiven the go ahead.\n\n133\n00:07:56.049 --> 00:07:59.784\nWe do not automatically say, yes,\nwe're gonna change the product delivery.\n\n134\n00:07:59.784 --> 00:08:06.908\nI mentioned terms like scope And changes\nto requirements in our last episode.\n\n135\n00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:10.640\nAnd we don't know what's great to that.\n\n136\n00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.920\nAnd, as I've just mentioned, we have to\nhave the relevant business justification.\n\n137\n00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.820\nSo we don't always agree,\nwe don't always approve\n\n138\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.640\nan update to the project baseline or\nan update to the project plan.\n\n139\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.980\nWe have to weigh things off.\n\n140\n00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.149\nThat sounds better than balance,\nreally, doesn't it,\n\n141\n00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:31.200\nbecause that's the term\n[LAUGH] that we generally use.\n\n142\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.980\nWe gotta weigh it up.\n\n143\n00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:40.626\nIs the improved quality, or\nis that changing scope worth the risk?\n\n144\n00:08:40.626 --> 00:08:43.100\nIs it worth the cost?\n\n145\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:48.070\nAre the increased benefits worth\nthe risk or are they worth the cost?\n\n146\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.390\nSo we've gotta weigh it out.\n\n147\n00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.380\nWe've gotta make sure that it's\nsomething that we want to do\n\n148\n00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.310\nbefore we then implement that particular,\nwell, issue.\n\n149\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.500\nImplement the change itself.\n\n150\n00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.670\n&gt;&gt; So when assessing an issue with RFC,\nwhatever it may be,\n\n151\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.647\nabout whether we're going to implement\na change deferred, or what, effectively,\n\n152\n00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:11.487\nevery time we go through\na cost-benefit analysis, right?\n\n153\n00:09:11.487 --> 00:09:12.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n154\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.070\n&gt;&gt; So how much is it gonna cost us?\n\n155\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.030\nWhat are the benefits?\n\n156\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.205\nHow do those compare to, is it good?\n\n157\n00:09:17.205 --> 00:09:18.340\nIs it bad?\n\n158\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.040\nIs it minimal increase?\n\n159\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.597\nThese are all the questions that\nwe will do for every issue-\n\n160\n00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:24.968\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n161\n00:09:24.968 --> 00:09:27.590\n&gt;&gt; That would crop up during the project.\n\n162\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's why we have\nthe issue register because, yes,\n\n163\n00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.710\nwe are going to do that, that's why we\nhave that particular process that we just\n\n164\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.520\nlooked up because we wanna\nmake sure that happens.\n\n165\n00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.720\nAnd we also want to make sure that not\nonly is the issue register updated but\n\n166\n00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.790\nthe business case is updated as well.\n\n167\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.600\nIf you remember from our previous\nepisodes, the business case is updated and\n\n168\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.460\nis reviewed within every\nsingle management stage.\n\n169\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:00.300\nAnd so therefore, you have to ensure that\n\n170\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.340\nwhatever change you're making,\nwhatever issue you're addressing,\n\n171\n00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.810\nwell, that it actually meets\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n172\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.930\nAnd that we do have the relevant\njustification for it.\n\n173\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.740\nSo yeah, we've gotta do that\nsorta cost benefit analysis,\n\n174\n00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.420\nif you will, with every single issue.\n\n175\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:24.490\nI have seen some horrendous\nissue registers in projects.\n\n176\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:29.260\nAnd when I say horrendous, I mean where\nwe've got 500 issues that are outlined.\n\n177\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.610\nThat tells me if we've got 500\nissues in an issue register,\n\n178\n00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.111\nthen somebody's got the project\nwrong in the first place.\n\n179\n00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.110\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were gonna say I've\nseen some horrendous ones like ones that\n\n180\n00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.905\ndon't exist.\n\n181\n00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:41.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah.\n\n182\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.020\nI mean I've seen the opposite as well,\nyeah.\n\n183\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.918\nAnd I don't know which is worst,\n[LAUGH] to be perfectly honest.\n\n184\n00:10:46.918 --> 00:10:52.070\n&gt;&gt; Like do I just act\nlike nothing's there or\n\n185\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.770\ndo I have it packed full of things?\n\n186\n00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.951\nI'm not even sure we're talking\nabout the same project when you see\n\n187\n00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:00.920\nan issues list that is 300, 400 lines.\n\n188\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.589\n&gt;&gt; You might.\n\n189\n00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:07.188\nWhen you have that many issues and\nyou just think to yourself, well,\n\n190\n00:11:07.188 --> 00:11:11.630\nsomebody clearly didn't scope out this\nproject correctly in the first place.\n\n191\n00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.920\nWhat do you reckon we do in\nthat instance by the way?\n\n192\n00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.200\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the things where\nat the end of the stage you go,\n\n193\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.020\nthis is this many issues we scoped out,\nI'm gonna make green crayons but\n\n194\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.533\nreally what we need is a fork.\n\n195\n00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:26.992\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n196\n00:11:26.992 --> 00:11:31.000\n&gt;&gt; I would suspect you would go,\nwe're not gonna continue on this to\n\n197\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.290\nimplement all of these issues,\nlike corrective action or whatever.\n\n198\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.270\nIf it was me, I would say, stop.\n\n199\n00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.630\nThis project's done.\n\n200\n00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.060\nLet's scope out the appropriate\nproject and reevaluate.\n\n201\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny you should say that,\n\n202\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.835\nbecause we actually have a process in\nour stages for closing out a project,\n\n203\n00:11:47.835 --> 00:11:52.720\nand it's an unexpected project closeout,\nbasically.\n\n204\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.960\nAnd in that instance,\nif I see an issue register where we've\n\n205\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:04.780\ngot 500 items in there, I will look\nat them and I will actually say,\n\n206\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.750\nthis project has being, if there's\nthat many, then the chances are that\n\n207\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.490\nthe project has been scoped out\nincorrectly in the first place.\n\n208\n00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.750\nAnd then in that instance, you know what,\nI want you to close out the project.\n\n209\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.390\nAnd I want you then to start up a new\nproject where we have scoped everything\n\n210\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.400\nout correctly.\n\n211\n00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.600\nNow that doesn't necessarily\nmean that we start everything\n\n212\n00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.030\nfrom scratch because we've still got\nroles and responsibilities, etc., that\n\n213\n00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.640\nwe can bring into the new project, but\nnevertheless it needs to be a new project.\n\n214\n00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.960\nIt needs to be scoped out.\n\n215\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.750\nIt needs to be planned, because you\ncan't carry on making changes like that.\n\n216\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.680\nYou can't carry on updating\nthe risk register.\n\n217\n00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.810\nThat's actually going to be more effort\nthan going back to the drawing board and\n\n218\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.990\nstarting the process again.\n\n219\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.280\n&gt;&gt; And to some extent,\nyou're more informed at this point.\n\n220\n00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You're like,\n\n221\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.720\nI had all these issues,\nwe didn't think about this correctly.\n\n222\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.940\nWe start a new project, we're now more\ninformed, we have more knowledge,\n\n223\n00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.770\nand maybe we can get to a better\nplan of action, so to speak.\n\n224\n00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.391\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n225\n00:13:09.391 --> 00:13:12.410\nAnd I do expect to see issue\nregisters in every single project.\n\n226\n00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.040\nIf a project doesn't\nhave an issue register,\n\n227\n00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.310\nthen that again tells me that, well,\n\n228\n00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.600\nit doesn't tell me that you haven't scoped\nit out correctly in the first place.\n\n229\n00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.810\nIt tells me that you're making assumptions\nthat you've scoped it out correctly\n\n230\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.530\nright at the very, very beginning and\n\n231\n00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.050\nit tells me that you're not necessarily\naligned with the organization either.\n\n232\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.050\nBecause if there isn't an issue\nregistered, then I would be asking\n\n233\n00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.400\nthe question, well, when was the last\ntime you went back to the users?\n\n234\n00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.480\nWhen was the last time you verified with\nthem that you were on the right track?\n\n235\n00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:46.430\nBecause I have never seen a successful\nproject that there hasn't had\n\n236\n00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.690\nan issue registrar where changes haven't\nbeen requested throughout the project.\n\n237\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.410\nI have never seen a successful\nproject where that's happened.\n\n238\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.150\nI've seen plenty of projects that haven't\nhad an issue register that have gone\n\n239\n00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:02.130\nthrough to fruition where the users\nhave said, well, that's great but\n\n240\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:07.440\nI wanted this or but things have\nchanged now and I need it this way now.\n\n241\n00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.550\nI've seen plenty of that happened.\n\n242\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:14.540\nAnd sometimes projects can be in their\nplanning and in project management,\n\n243\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.410\nwe can be too rigid.\n\n244\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.410\nAnd I teach you right at the very\nbeginning when we started off on this\n\n245\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:25.240\nseries I said, no, don't talk about things\nbeing rigid please because it's not.\n\n246\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.930\nWe've got to be flexible, we have to have\na flexible approach to project management.\n\n247\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.070\nAnd we have to accept that things change.\n\n248\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:37.500\nWe're in the 21st century now and\nIT doesn't stay the same for 6 months.\n\n249\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.930\nSo there's absolutely,\n[LAUGH] two months yeah,\n\n250\n00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:46.800\nthere's absolutely no way that\nour project can stay the same.\n\n251\n00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.020\nNo way at all.\n\n252\n00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.650\nSo if I see a project that doesn't\nhave an issue register, then I'm\n\n253\n00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:57.590\nequally as worried about that project as\nif I see one that has 500 items in it.\n\n254\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.906\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, this issue register,\nthis very large one that we talked about,\n\n255\n00:15:01.906 --> 00:15:07.166\ncould that also\n\n256\n00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:12.050\nkinda the result of a customer that\n\n257\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.790\ndoes not have a clear understanding\nof what they want, in particular?\n\n258\n00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.644\nLike, maybe your scope report was correct\nbased on the information that you were\n\n259\n00:15:19.644 --> 00:15:20.780\ngiven at the time.\n\n260\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.860\nThen every time you show them, they're,\nlike, no actually, we want this now.\n\n261\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.019\nIs that also a possibility\nin this capacity?\n\n262\n00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:31.040\n&gt;&gt; It is, but then that's down to\nineffective business analysis.\n\n263\n00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.600\nAnd it's down to ineffective sorta\nbusiness relationship managements,\n\n264\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.720\nas well, because I expect, if we've got\neffective business relationship manages,\n\n265\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.570\nif we've got effective business analysts,\nthen I expect them to know\n\n266\n00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.670\nthe organization well enough to\nactually know what they want.\n\n267\n00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.765\nAnd, in fact, again, and I know that in a\nprevious episode I said to you go back to\n\n268\n00:15:50.765 --> 00:15:54.343\nITIL and go back to looking at your\nservice transition series in ITIL.\n\n269\n00:15:54.343 --> 00:15:57.338\nGo back to looking at your service\nstrategies series in ITIL and\n\n270\n00:15:57.338 --> 00:16:00.002\nyou'll see what happens\nbefore a project's started.\n\n271\n00:16:00.002 --> 00:16:02.401\nYou'll see where the ideas come from.\n\n272\n00:16:02.401 --> 00:16:07.032\nAnd the best projects are those\nproactive ideas where the business\n\n273\n00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:12.087\nrelationship manager has a really\ngood understanding of the business.\n\n274\n00:16:12.087 --> 00:16:15.604\nAnd has actually taken time and\nhas sat with the business and\n\n275\n00:16:15.604 --> 00:16:17.934\nunderstands what the business needs.\n\n276\n00:16:17.934 --> 00:16:22.499\nAnd actually recommends solutions for\nthe business, rather than waiting for\n\n277\n00:16:22.499 --> 00:16:26.620\nthe business to come to us and\nask for something specific.\n\n278\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.020\nInvariably when\nthe organization comes to us,\n\n279\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.960\nthey'll tell us that they want an iPad.\n\n280\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.100\nThey'll give us the solution, and\n\n281\n00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.430\nthat's what they want, without really\nunderstanding what their needs are.\n\n282\n00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.156\nSo the best projects,\nthe most successful projects,\n\n283\n00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:45.179\nare the ones where business relationship\nmanagement has played a part and\n\n284\n00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:49.243\nhas been proactive in recommending for\nthe organization.\n\n285\n00:16:49.243 --> 00:16:51.779\nRather than those where we've waited for\n\n286\n00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:54.470\nthe organization to come\nto us with a I want.\n\n287\n00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.130\nSo let's take a look then at\nwhat we actually really need in\n\n288\n00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.370\norder to have effective change\ncontrol within our project.\n\n289\n00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:07.850\nUnderstanding that there are going\nto be changes to requirements.\n\n290\n00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:14.870\nWe need to have an approach to change\ncontrol, to managing our issues,\n\n291\n00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:19.590\nthat show us how we identify those issues,\nand assessing those issues.\n\n292\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:25.470\nSo everything that you have seen\nin this particular diagram here,\n\n293\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.530\nwe need to have a structured,\nconsistent approach for\n\n294\n00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:34.530\nhow we perform every single\none of those activities.\n\n295\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.500\nAll of them,\nincluding how we capture our product\n\n296\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.010\nbaselines and\nhow we control our product baselines.\n\n297\n00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:49.237\nIncluding how we're going to manage\nissues throughout the project itself.\n\n298\n00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:51.553\nAnd what we do with\nlessons learned as well,\n\n299\n00:17:51.553 --> 00:17:53.690\nbecause they have to be identified too.\n\n300\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.340\nUltimately, as I've already said to\nyou just now when we were talking,\n\n301\n00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.010\nwe've got to align ourselves\nwith the organization.\n\n302\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.590\nSo this is reliant on good\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n303\n00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.130\nBut it's also reliant on good\nproject management as well.\n\n304\n00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.000\nAnd the project manager,\n\n305\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.870\nwell, should be able to manage\nthe change control approach.\n\n306\n00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.180\nThey should be able to manage\nall of those activities.\n\n307\n00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.563\nYou saw the interaction\nwith the project board and\n\n308\n00:18:23.563 --> 00:18:25.329\nwith change authorization as well.\n\n309\n00:18:25.329 --> 00:18:29.501\nBecause the change authority\nhas to authorize any issues,\n\n310\n00:18:29.501 --> 00:18:31.260\nauthorize any changes.\n\n311\n00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.588\nAnd as we've already said as well,\nwe're doing that cost benefit analysis, so\n\n312\n00:18:36.588 --> 00:18:37.875\nwe have to have a budget.\n\n313\n00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:43.300\nAnd any good effective project manager\n\n314\n00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.480\nwill ensure that we,\nas part of the project budget,\n\n315\n00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.600\nwe have an allocated budget\nto accommodate changes.\n\n316\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.250\nBecause as I've said right at the\nbeginning, we're in the 21st century now.\n\n317\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:00.310\nThings change every, well I was\ngoing to say every couple of months,\n\n318\n00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.340\nJustin thinks every two months.\n\n319\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.160\nSo you have to accommodate for\nthat in your project,\n\n320\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.770\nwhich means that you have to have\nthe budget to accommodate for that.\n\n321\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.080\nBecause when we're bringing in a new\nchange, it's probably going to cost us\n\n322\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.940\nmoney, because we're going to need to\nbring in additional skills to be on it.\n\n323\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:23.260\nSo we need to have a defined\napproach to change control,\n\n324\n00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.910\nand we need to have\na documented issue register.\n\n325\n00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:32.107\nAs well as a daily log,\nas well as a report, and of course,\n\n326\n00:19:32.107 --> 00:19:37.797\nwe've already mentioned our CI record,\nthat's gonna be important as well.\n\n327\n00:19:37.797 --> 00:19:43.044\nDon't forget, if we're making\nany changes to any products,\n\n328\n00:19:43.044 --> 00:19:49.390\nthen they need to be updated in our\nconfiguration management database too.\n\n329\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.930\nJustin's thinking now.\n\n330\n00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.420\n&gt;&gt; So this is one of those\nthings you may kinda gloss over.\n\n331\n00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.663\nBut having this approach,\nit seems like this is a good way\n\n332\n00:19:59.663 --> 00:20:04.002\nto stymie possible what I call shiny\nobject syndrome or anything like that.\n\n333\n00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:07.421\nWhere you have all this expense and\nall this, well,\n\n334\n00:20:07.421 --> 00:20:10.764\nall this change that occurs\nbecause someone goes,\n\n335\n00:20:10.764 --> 00:20:15.260\nI found this new tool that will\nactually help us do this better.\n\n336\n00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.314\nExcept, no one in-house has the skills,\nwe don't have this infrastructure,\n\n337\n00:20:19.314 --> 00:20:21.827\nwe don't have, so\nthere's this over reaching.\n\n338\n00:20:21.827 --> 00:20:26.155\nSo I'm guessing having this approach\nwhere it says this what we're gonna do,\n\n339\n00:20:26.155 --> 00:20:27.872\nit helps stymie that, right?\n\n340\n00:20:27.872 --> 00:20:32.816\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I also don't want you\nto forget the fact that even though\n\n341\n00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:38.650\nwe're in project management,\nwe want to have a DevOps approach as well.\n\n342\n00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.695\nAnd so\nyou don't need to reinvent the wheel,\n\n343\n00:20:41.695 --> 00:20:47.149\nif our operations environment has got\na really good change management process,\n\n344\n00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:50.616\nand it's a change management\nprocess that works.\n\n345\n00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:54.743\nAnd we've got the relevant change\nauthorities in place as well, and\n\n346\n00:20:54.743 --> 00:20:58.657\nwe've got the relevant places for\nstoring documentation and for\n\n347\n00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:02.120\nrecording change,\nthen why aren't we using that?\n\n348\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.800\nThe project environment is\nnot a separate organization,\n\n349\n00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.560\nthe project environment\nis still part of IT.\n\n350\n00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.718\nAnd therefore, as part of IT,\nwe should be working\n\n351\n00:21:15.718 --> 00:21:20.725\nin the same way,\nwe should be using consistency.\n\n352\n00:21:20.725 --> 00:21:24.210\nFor the sake of efficiency,\nwe want consistent methods.\n\n353\n00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:29.875\nSure, we should have a separate,\nI was gonna say, we should have\n\n354\n00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:36.789\na partitioned part of the database where\nwe record changes and record our RFCs.\n\n355\n00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:38.880\nShould it be part of the live environment?\n\n356\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.830\nNot necessarily, however, we should\nstill be looking at the same processes.\n\n357\n00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.920\nWe should still be as efficient\nas we possibly can be.\n\n358\n00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.840\nWe have just as much of\na responsibility for\n\n359\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.460\nefficiency as the operational\nenvironment does.\n\n360\n00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.560\nSo learn from the operational environment,\ndon't act in silos,\n\n361\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:07.350\nbecause acting in silos is just never\nefficient, learn where you can.\n\n362\n00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:12.765\nSo as far as change is concerned,\nwe've looked at what change means.\n\n363\n00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:18.965\nWe've looked at issues, we've looked\nat how we implement a change control\n\n364\n00:22:18.965 --> 00:22:24.895\napproach, and the sorts of activities\nthat we have to ensure that we manage.\n\n365\n00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:27.215\nSo for this particular theme,\n\n366\n00:22:27.215 --> 00:22:31.509\nthen this is our final episode\non that particular theme.\n\n367\n00:22:31.509 --> 00:22:34.777\nAnd when we come back,\nwe're going to be looking,\n\n368\n00:22:34.777 --> 00:22:38.350\nin our next episode,\nat the project theme of progress.\n\n369\n00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.488\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, I'm kind of interested\nto see how progress, I don't know,\n\n370\n00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:46.166\nmy mind is going a bunch\nof different directions.\n\n371\n00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:47.920\nAnd, well,\nyours may be doing the same thing.\n\n372\n00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.410\nAnd the only way you're gonna find\nout is if you join us back and\n\n373\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.520\nsee what progress theme is all about.\n\n374\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.690\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n375\n00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.490\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n376\n00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:58.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n377\n00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.827\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n378\n00:22:59.827 --> 00:23:05.976\n[MUSIC]\n\n379\n00:23:05.976 --> 00:23:08.751\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.242\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.776\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:15.647\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of IT PRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.647 --> 00:00:19.870\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwell, welcome back to PRINCE2 2017\n\n7\n00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.709\nFoundation Series and\nwe're continuing our discussion on themes.\n\n8\n00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:28.237\nAnd in this episode we're actually gonna\nbe talking about the progress themes, and\n\n9\n00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:30.979\nto help us progress through\nthis a little bit more,\n\n10\n00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.784\nis none other than Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:33.744\nHow are you doing Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:35.066\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely good, thank you Justin.\n\n13\n00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:35.902\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:40.149\n&gt;&gt; I\"m doing fantastic, you know it's\nbeen a little longer of a week but\n\n15\n00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.344\nwe finally progressed through the week and\nI think we're getting ready to finish up.\n\n16\n00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:48.372\nBut I'm pretty sure that's not what\nwe're talking about here right?\n\n17\n00:00:48.372 --> 00:00:50.329\n&gt;&gt; You think you're getting\nready to finish up well no.\n\n18\n00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.942\n&gt;&gt; For the week, for the week.\n\n19\n00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:56.394\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no we're finishing up we're\non the last of our themes now for\n\n20\n00:00:56.394 --> 00:01:01.616\nPRINCE2 project management but that's\nas much as we're gonna finish up today.\n\n21\n00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:03.795\nWe've got lots today.\n\n22\n00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:08.340\nWe've got quite a few episodes and\nright now what we're gonna be doing\n\n23\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.289\nis monitoring progress, just a little\ncorrection there Justin by the way.\n\n24\n00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:14.639\n&gt;&gt; That's what I said, progress.\n\n25\n00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:16.798\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah exactly.\n\n26\n00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:19.939\nYeah, well I'm gonna be\nlooking at progress.\n\n27\n00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.688\n&gt;&gt; This reminds me, tomato,\n\n28\n00:01:23.688 --> 00:01:27.767\ntomato, pants, trousers.\n\n29\n00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:29.323\nThey all sound the same to me.\n\n30\n00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:31.148\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They all sound the same to you,\n\n31\n00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:31.665\nall right.\n\n32\n00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:35.919\nOkay, well I just wanna reassure everybody\nthat Justin does actually have his\n\n33\n00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:37.667\ntrousers on not just his pants.\n\n34\n00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:42.263\nBecause otherwise I would be very scared,\nI wouldn't be here.\n\n35\n00:01:42.263 --> 00:01:43.602\nLet's be honest about this.\n\n36\n00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:49.261\n[LAUGH] Let's start taking a look then\nat our final theme within PRINCE2\n\n37\n00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:54.262\nproject management and\nour final theme is the progress theme,\n\n38\n00:01:54.262 --> 00:01:58.048\nand there's a very simple\nexplanation there.\n\n39\n00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:02.622\nIn every single one of these episodes\nthat we've looked at with our themes,\n\n40\n00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:06.199\nwe have had the purpose of each\nparticular theme outlined.\n\n41\n00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:11.299\nAnd just as a little tip for your test,\nbecause I know that you want to do\n\n42\n00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.588\nyour foundation test, well you probably\nneed to be aware of the themes.\n\n43\n00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:20.531\nYou certainly need to be able to recognize\nthem when it comes to your test.\n\n44\n00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:25.964\nIf they ask any questions such as,\nwhat is the purpose of the progress theme?\n\n45\n00:02:25.964 --> 00:02:30.412\nThen I expect you to be\nable to recognize this.\n\n46\n00:02:30.412 --> 00:02:36.401\nNow, don't forget,\nwe are in PRINCE2 project management,\n\n47\n00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:40.361\nand we're in our very, very last theme.\n\n48\n00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:46.818\nAnd a theme is something that goes\nthrough all of the project itself,\n\n49\n00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:50.730\nand the project is completely scalable.\n\n50\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.455\nSo whether we've got two stages or whether\nwe've got 15 stages to that project.\n\n51\n00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:59.213\nWhether it's a waterfall approach project,\nor\n\n52\n00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:02.051\nwhether we're managing\nit is an Agile approach.\n\n53\n00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:08.688\nThe fact is that these things need\nto run through all of our projects.\n\n54\n00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:15.432\nSo a progress theme is about\nmonitoring progress of the project.\n\n55\n00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:17.649\nNow I've just mentioned\na waterfall approach and\n\n56\n00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:19.512\nI've just mentioned an Agile approach.\n\n57\n00:03:19.512 --> 00:03:23.734\nSo ultimately when you think about it,\nthis is flexible.\n\n58\n00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:29.057\nAnd when I said don't forget,\ndon't forget that PRINCE2\n\n59\n00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:34.172\nis not a plug and play option for\nmanaging your projects.\n\n60\n00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:39.515\nit's a methodology that we use to\nmanage projects but it is flexible.\n\n61\n00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:45.693\nAnd we've already talked about tailoring\nand of course PRICE2 needs to be tailored.\n\n62\n00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:49.414\nSo does the progress theme definitely.\n\n63\n00:03:49.414 --> 00:03:53.761\nWe've got to be able to monitor\nprogress bearing in mind that for\n\n64\n00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:57.398\nevery single project,\nprogress will be different.\n\n65\n00:03:57.398 --> 00:04:01.815\nAnd progress will probably need to be\nmeasured in different ways as well.\n\n66\n00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:05.451\nSo what we want to do,\nthe objective of the progress theme,\n\n67\n00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:09.841\nis at says there, it's about\nestablishing the relevant mechanisms.\n\n68\n00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:14.962\nI always add the word relevant in there,\nand it's not out of the PRINCE2 book,\n\n69\n00:04:14.962 --> 00:04:19.396\nthe PRINCE2 book simply says to\nestablish mechanisms to monitor and\n\n70\n00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:21.627\ncompare actual against planned.\n\n71\n00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:25.460\nBut I look at the word,\nI use the word relevance in there and\n\n72\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.608\nI use that quite, I was just\ngonna say quite liberally really,\n\n73\n00:04:29.608 --> 00:04:32.915\nbecause we've gotta have\nrelevant mechanisms.\n\n74\n00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:36.375\nThis is not just about taking out some\nmechanisms out of the PRINCE2 book and\n\n75\n00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.881\napplying them and saying,\nhey, look that will work.\n\n76\n00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:41.086\nThat's not always going to work.\n\n77\n00:04:41.086 --> 00:04:45.967\nWe want to have smart ways\nof managing progress.\n\n78\n00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:48.662\nSo we need to be able to\nmeasure our progress.\n\n79\n00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:50.919\nIt says there look, monitor and compare.\n\n80\n00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.705\nWell if you're comparing,\nyou need to be able to measure.\n\n81\n00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:57.541\nBut sometimes measurement\ncan be quite a challenge.\n\n82\n00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:58.873\nHow do you measure quality?\n\n83\n00:04:58.873 --> 00:05:02.287\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Subjectively.\n\n84\n00:05:02.287 --> 00:05:03.788\nI don't know if that's\nwhat you were [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:05:03.788 --> 00:05:04.598\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n86\n00:05:04.598 --> 00:05:07.620\n&gt;&gt; So you're doing so,\n&gt;&gt; That's quite an ambiguous,\n\n87\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.643\n&gt;&gt; You were somehow trying to quantify\n\n88\n00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:16.801\nthis through either surveys or\nsomething of that nature to gather data.\n\n89\n00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:19.294\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That you can make in assertion about.\n\n90\n00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:22.985\n&gt;&gt; When you think about it, we talked to\none on one of our previous episodes when\n\n91\n00:05:22.985 --> 00:05:24.555\nwe looked at the quality thing.\n\n92\n00:05:24.555 --> 00:05:26.846\nAnd we talked about the fact that,\n\n93\n00:05:26.846 --> 00:05:31.901\nyou've got to be able to measure quality\nand that it's really difficult for\n\n94\n00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:37.198\nour customers sometimes to quantify\nquality, because quality is perceived.\n\n95\n00:05:37.198 --> 00:05:42.341\nAnd so, our customer surveys user surveys,\nare one of the ways that we would actually\n\n96\n00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:47.128\nmeasure quality, and in fact it's really\nimportant, those customer surveys\n\n97\n00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:51.571\nare going to tell us whether we have\ndelivered what was set out to deliver.\n\n98\n00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:56.219\nSometimes the customers will tell\nyou I want something to do this,\n\n99\n00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.792\nI want to have something to write on.\n\n100\n00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.398\nLet's talk about something that Justin and\n\n101\n00:06:01.398 --> 00:06:05.842\nI were discussing with our directors\njust before we started this episode.\n\n102\n00:06:05.842 --> 00:06:10.751\nAbout the fact that we have a requirement\nor I have a requirement anyway, and\n\n103\n00:06:10.751 --> 00:06:14.588\nmy requirement was right well\nI want something to write on,\n\n104\n00:06:14.588 --> 00:06:18.444\nactually what I want is a 75\ninch iPad that's what I want.\n\n105\n00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:23.997\nNow, just imagine that for a moment,\nthat as a customer this is my requirement.\n\n106\n00:06:23.997 --> 00:06:28.666\nAnd then I have been able to give\nthat to the project manager, and\n\n107\n00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:32.558\nnow the project manager is\ngoing to have to sit down and\n\n108\n00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:36.993\nwork out how he's going to\ndeliver that to us as edutainers.\n\n109\n00:06:36.993 --> 00:06:40.536\nHow am I going to deliver\na set of 75 inch iPad?\n\n110\n00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:43.335\nIt's not going to be that\neasy because somehow I\n\n111\n00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:45.647\ndon't think Apple make them just yet.\n\n112\n00:06:45.647 --> 00:06:47.927\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n113\n00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:48.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n114\n00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:53.380\nsome reason my mind went to zip tie as in\na bunch of iPad pros like zip tied, yeah.\n\n115\n00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.268\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I don't think that necessarily,\n\n116\n00:06:56.268 --> 00:06:59.869\nit doesn't fulfill the request\nnecessarily [CROSSTALK].\n\n117\n00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:00.787\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not quite, no.\n\n118\n00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:04.040\nSo we've gotta measure whether we're\n\n119\n00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.091\ndelivering quality as\nthe project progresses.\n\n120\n00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:12.178\nSo we've gotta measure whether we're\nactually progressing in that project.\n\n121\n00:07:12.178 --> 00:07:16.447\nSo quality's a difficult one,\nand surveys will help us.\n\n122\n00:07:16.447 --> 00:07:20.451\nBut really what we want to try and\ndo is we want to try and\n\n123\n00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:26.253\ntake anything that is subjective and\nturn it into an objective measurement.\n\n124\n00:07:26.253 --> 00:07:29.119\nAnd that of course it mentions\nthat the end there for\n\n125\n00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:33.598\nthat particular purpose it mentions\ncontrolling any acceptable deviations.\n\n126\n00:07:33.598 --> 00:07:38.304\nNow, in previous episodes\nwe've used the word tolerance.\n\n127\n00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:40.584\nAnd we've talked about tolerances, and\n\n128\n00:07:40.584 --> 00:07:43.726\nthis is why we talk about\nacceptable deviations as well.\n\n129\n00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:47.062\nRemember we've got tolerances\nthat we can work within.\n\n130\n00:07:47.062 --> 00:07:49.824\nAnd so when I give my requirements or\n\n131\n00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:55.256\nour requirements to our directing team,\nand I say this is what I want,\n\n132\n00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:59.789\nthis is the technology I want,\nI got certain tolerances.\n\n133\n00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:04.283\nMy certain tolerances would be\nsomething like, it doesn't necessarily\n\n134\n00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:09.070\nhave to be 75 inch, it could be 85 inch\nbut I don't want it any less than 70.\n\n135\n00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.190\nSo I've got tolerances there, and\n\n136\n00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.800\nin that one that's quite tangible\ntolerance, you know, that specific size.\n\n137\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.995\nI might also have a tolerance\nover operating system as well.\n\n138\n00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.791\nThis isn't necessarily have to be in iPad,\n\n139\n00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:24.900\nit could have a Windows\nbased operating system.\n\n140\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.266\nWhat I actually want to is\nto this particular ability,\n\n141\n00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:29.808\ndo you remember MoSCoW?\n\n142\n00:08:29.808 --> 00:08:36.488\n&gt;&gt; Must have, should have, could have,\nwill not have the current time or wants.\n\n143\n00:08:36.488 --> 00:08:39.168\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd like in the future,\nwould like, yeah.\n\n144\n00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:43.879\nSo in that particular instance what\nI've done is I've already got a MoSCoW\n\n145\n00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:47.410\nlist in my head,\nit must have the ability to write on it.\n\n146\n00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.260\nI must be able to write and it must be big\nenough that I don't need to keep zooming\n\n147\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.187\nin and zooming back out again.\n\n148\n00:08:54.187 --> 00:08:58.979\nAnd it must be big enough to contain\na lot of information that I need to\n\n149\n00:08:58.979 --> 00:09:02.523\nbuild up mind maps or,\nthey're my must-haves.\n\n150\n00:09:02.523 --> 00:09:07.540\nAnd then we can go into the could-haves\non that one, well, it could\n\n151\n00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.537\nbe a 75 inch iPad or it could be another\noperating system, these are my coulds.\n\n152\n00:09:13.537 --> 00:09:18.851\nSo, I'm quite happy to accept any\nof those within those tolerances\n\n153\n00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:23.620\nthat I just outlined, and\nthen we've got our should haves.\n\n154\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.330\nOr well, sorry you should haves\nwhich is an operating systems,\n\n155\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.660\nthen your could haves, which are the\noptionals, and then you would like or\n\n156\n00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.904\nwon't have right now, well,\nthat could be anything.\n\n157\n00:09:34.904 --> 00:09:39.940\nMy would like would be well, I'd like it\nin white, but you know what, I don't care.\n\n158\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.036\n&gt;&gt; Or it should have blinky\nlights on the edges, right?\n\n159\n00:09:44.036 --> 00:09:46.990\nNo, I'm joking, they shouldn't do that,\nthat would be distracting.\n\n160\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.591\n&gt;&gt; That would be, yeah, yeah.\n\n161\n00:09:48.591 --> 00:09:53.474\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And not necessarily high tech either.\n\n162\n00:09:53.474 --> 00:09:56.933\n&gt;&gt; I guess we all have\na difference in opinions.\n\n163\n00:09:56.933 --> 00:10:02.073\n&gt;&gt; Moving on, [LAUGH] so let's take a look\nat the progress theme in more detail.\n\n164\n00:10:02.073 --> 00:10:05.370\nNow, look at this, we've got a purple\ndiagram, so what does that mean Justin?\n\n165\n00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.897\n&gt;&gt; It came from the PRINCE2 book.\n\n166\n00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:10.888\n&gt;&gt; It came, exactly it did,\nit came from that PRINCE2 manual.\n\n167\n00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:15.712\nAnd you will see on this left hand\nside it tells you that progress is\n\n168\n00:10:15.712 --> 00:10:20.570\nmeasured at all levels but\nmanagement is by exception only.\n\n169\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:27.800\nSo look at the top, top is the corporate\nlevel and they set the project tolerances.\n\n170\n00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.564\nThe Project Board set each\nindividual stage tolerance and\n\n171\n00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:36.790\nthe Project Manager sets the tolerances\nfor the work packages themselves.\n\n172\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.952\nThe Team Manager is responsible,\nor accountable even, for\n\n173\n00:10:40.952 --> 00:10:45.697\nproducing the work, and\nhe will measure the work package progress.\n\n174\n00:10:45.697 --> 00:10:50.312\nWith the Project Manager well,\nhe then delivers\n\n175\n00:10:50.312 --> 00:10:55.267\nthe stage progress to\nthe project board who delivers\n\n176\n00:10:55.267 --> 00:11:00.235\nthe entire project progress\nup to corporate level.\n\n177\n00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:04.125\nI like what it says about\nmanagement by exception,\n\n178\n00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:10.376\nin other words it doesn't say micro\nmanaging, okay, it says manage exception.\n\n179\n00:11:10.376 --> 00:11:12.195\nDo you know what we mean by that?\n\n180\n00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:18.920\n&gt;&gt; Only intervene when something\nis going wrong or kind of awry.\n\n181\n00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.566\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that's basically it,\nis that we don't\n\n182\n00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:28.519\nneed management intervention\nat every single activity.\n\n183\n00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:33.260\nIf you've got the correct plan, so\nremember we've got a theme of plan,\n\n184\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.379\nwell if you've got the right plan,\nif it's a relevant plan and\n\n185\n00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:42.847\nit meets the needs of the organization as\nwell as meeting the output of the project.\n\n186\n00:11:42.847 --> 00:11:46.171\nWhich should therefore meet\nthe needs of the organization,\n\n187\n00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.680\nthen with a relevant plan.\n\n188\n00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.960\nYou shouldn't need to micromanage\nbecause everybody should be aware,\n\n189\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.720\ndon't forget our Gantt charts as well,\nwe've got that at a glance view.\n\n190\n00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.240\nEverybody should be aware of\nwhat their activities are,\n\n191\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.690\nwhat they should be undertaking and when.\n\n192\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.080\nEven in an agile perspective everybody\nshould be aware of what they're supposed\n\n193\n00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.870\nto be doing and therefore we manage\nonly when something happens.\n\n194\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.790\nSomething negative generally,\nso an exception to the plan\n\n195\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.330\nwhen something's not going according\nto the plan that's when we manage.\n\n196\n00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.652\nOther than that, then we let everybody\njust get on with whatever work it\n\n197\n00:12:27.652 --> 00:12:30.834\nis that they're actually\nscheduling themselves.\n\n198\n00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:35.900\nSo we monitor and we control our work\npackage level and that's the team level,\n\n199\n00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.450\nwe monitor it's stage level,\nthat's the progress.\n\n200\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:44.317\nAnd we monitor our project level as well,\nbut when it comes to control,\n\n201\n00:12:44.317 --> 00:12:46.358\nwe manage only by exception.\n\n202\n00:12:46.358 --> 00:12:52.940\nWe should always where we can delegate\nauthority to the level below.\n\n203\n00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.714\nThe last thing that you need is your\nproject manager getting involved in all of\n\n204\n00:12:57.714 --> 00:13:01.400\nthe nitty gritty, all of the nuts and\nbolts of the project.\n\n205\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.810\nI mean lets face it,\nwhen it comes to development\n\n206\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.600\nI'm gonna ask you a question now,\nbe prepared for an honest answer.\n\n207\n00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.970\nHow receptive are you to having a project\nmanager involved in the work that\n\n208\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:14.480\nyou're doing?\n\n209\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.570\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n&gt;&gt; It's okay.\n\n210\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.630\n&gt;&gt; It's not that I'm not receptive.\n\n211\n00:13:25.088 --> 00:13:28.936\nThat's a hard one cuz it's very\ncase by case basis for me.\n\n212\n00:13:28.936 --> 00:13:33.496\nMainly because sometimes I've had\nproject managers who step in, and\n\n213\n00:13:33.496 --> 00:13:36.674\nthey behave like they\nknow all the intricacies.\n\n214\n00:13:36.674 --> 00:13:39.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When in fact I'm like I haven't\n\n215\n00:13:39.313 --> 00:13:41.040\nsee you for like three months.\n\n216\n00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.004\nAnd they're like well you need to do this,\n\n217\n00:13:43.004 --> 00:13:45.145\nwell that's funny you\nneed to get out of here.\n\n218\n00:13:45.145 --> 00:13:47.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n219\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.812\n&gt;&gt; But if they are maybe it's a smaller\n\n220\n00:13:49.812 --> 00:13:54.749\ncompany I've been in this where the\nproject manager has some understanding,\n\n221\n00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:56.340\nI'm fairly receptive.\n\n222\n00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.609\n&gt;&gt; I would change one little\nthing that you said there and\n\n223\n00:14:00.609 --> 00:14:05.147\nI mean bear in mind that I asked for your\nopinion so I can't really turn around and\n\n224\n00:14:05.147 --> 00:14:06.805\nsay I'm gonna change it.\n\n225\n00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:10.253\nBut you said something about the size of\nthe organization, and I would kind of\n\n226\n00:14:10.253 --> 00:14:13.560\nchallenge you to say it was more along\nthe lines of the size of the project.\n\n227\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.431\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can agree with that.\n\n228\n00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:19.482\n&gt;&gt; Which can be directly related to that.\n\n229\n00:14:19.482 --> 00:14:20.693\n&gt;&gt; In my particular case,\n\n230\n00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:24.700\nit was related to the fact that\nthe organization was small.\n\n231\n00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's fine generally\nyou find that the smaller the project.\n\n232\n00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.847\nThe smaller the scale of the project\nthen the more likely it is that\n\n233\n00:14:31.847 --> 00:14:36.058\nthe project manager is gonna be somebody\nwho has the technical understanding.\n\n234\n00:14:36.058 --> 00:14:40.310\nAnd who can actually get involved in\nsort of the nitty-gritty and the detail.\n\n235\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:44.400\nThe larger the scale of the project\nthen the more likely you\n\n236\n00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.900\nare to have a project manager\nwho is purely a manager.\n\n237\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.694\nAnd who therefore is not able to\nget involved in the nitty-gritty,\n\n238\n00:14:52.694 --> 00:14:55.300\nand that's when I ask the question,\n\n239\n00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.694\nhow receptive are you to\nthe project manager being involved.\n\n240\n00:14:59.694 --> 00:15:04.067\nThat's when you get the situation where\nyour project manager generally you're\n\n241\n00:15:04.067 --> 00:15:06.523\nwelcome [LAUGH] within\nthe development team.\n\n242\n00:15:06.523 --> 00:15:10.807\nAnd so you need to ensure that\nwe've got that relationship,\n\n243\n00:15:10.807 --> 00:15:15.431\nwhere the project manager is not\nexpecting to be micromanaging.\n\n244\n00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:17.486\nI also want to talk about, and\n\n245\n00:15:17.486 --> 00:15:21.690\nwe're gonna talk about processes\nin subsequent episodes.\n\n246\n00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:26.086\nAnd so, I do wanna mention obviously\nthat we do have to divide the project\n\n247\n00:15:26.086 --> 00:15:29.991\ninto stages, and we look at\nthe process is within those stages.\n\n248\n00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:34.741\nIn our subsequent episode,\ndon't forget to check those,\n\n249\n00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:39.586\nas we're going through, but\nour progress reporting should\n\n250\n00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:43.872\nbe not just time driven but\nit should be stage driven.\n\n251\n00:15:43.872 --> 00:15:47.825\nBefore you turn around to me and\nyou say to me that's the same thing,\n\n252\n00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:49.639\nthat's not necessarily true.\n\n253\n00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:54.275\nI would expect if I have\ngot my Gantt chart,\n\n254\n00:15:54.275 --> 00:15:58.015\nnow remember that we covered\nthat in our previous episodes.\n\n255\n00:15:58.015 --> 00:16:02.895\nIf I've got my Gantt chart, Then I say,\nright, okay, I've got this list of\n\n256\n00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:07.690\nactivities, and I've got\nthe dependencies between each activity.\n\n257\n00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:12.605\nAnd therefore, if I planned it correctly,\nthen I've planned for\n\n258\n00:16:12.605 --> 00:16:16.575\nwhen each activity is going to happen and\nwhich time?\n\n259\n00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:20.143\nTherefore then, time and\nevent driven would be identical.\n\n260\n00:16:20.143 --> 00:16:25.141\nYes, happy with you saying that,\nbecause this is when I planned for\n\n261\n00:16:25.141 --> 00:16:27.960\nthis particular activity to finish.\n\n262\n00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:33.719\nThat's an event that activity\nis finished at this time, great.\n\n263\n00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:37.368\nNow how often does everything go to plan?\n\n264\n00:16:37.368 --> 00:16:40.507\n&gt;&gt; I would say nearly never.\n\n265\n00:16:40.507 --> 00:16:45.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, I'd like to get us\nto a point where it's all the time.\n\n266\n00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.795\nBut let's be realistic,\n\n267\n00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:51.590\niIt quite often happens that\nthings don't go according to plan.\n\n268\n00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.358\nSo time driven could be every month for\nreporting but event driven well,\n\n269\n00:16:56.358 --> 00:17:00.592\nwe plan for it to be every month,\nbut it turns out that it's not.\n\n270\n00:17:00.592 --> 00:17:04.999\nAnd so we want to ensure\nthat we incorporate both.\n\n271\n00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:08.031\nIt's not just time driven, and\n\n272\n00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:13.770\nit's not just event driven,\nthe focus has got to be on both.\n\n273\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:19.706\nSo as we've talked about time driven,\nwe've got highlight reports and\n\n274\n00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:23.893\nwe've got checkpoint reports\nwhich tells us where\n\n275\n00:17:23.893 --> 00:17:28.580\nthe progress is on a project,\nat a certain point in time.\n\n276\n00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.610\nThat's done on an iterative basis,\n\n277\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:36.530\nit's done at regular intervals throughout\nthe project, so say every month, or\n\n278\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.590\nmaybe every week, we might want to\nbe reducing the highlight report.\n\n279\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.781\nAnd then you've got your event driven\nwhich is I've already mentioned would\n\n280\n00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:49.146\nbe sort of end of stages, or\nit maybe exception based as well.\n\n281\n00:17:49.146 --> 00:17:53.221\nThis event, well an event is\nsomething that's happened.\n\n282\n00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:56.829\nIt's a change of state, and a change\nof state to the project could be that\n\n283\n00:17:56.829 --> 00:17:59.787\nwe've had an exception or\nwe've exceeded the tolerance,\n\n284\n00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:02.590\nor maybe that we've actually\njust finished the stage.\n\n285\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.870\nSo, something else that we want to do,\n\n286\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.720\nis we want to ensure that\nwe manage out tolerances.\n\n287\n00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.940\nRemember what I said to you right\nat the very beginning of this,\n\n288\n00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.860\nin that the beginning we talked about,\nI want a 70 inch iPad or\n\n289\n00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.880\n75 inch iPad and I have some tolerances.\n\n290\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.843\nThose tolerances might change,\nbecause my requirements might change.\n\n291\n00:18:29.843 --> 00:18:34.664\nAnd so I did my must go list,\nmy must have should have, could have, etc,\n\n292\n00:18:34.664 --> 00:18:37.130\nwhen I had my initial requirements.\n\n293\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:42.339\nBut then as the project progresses and\nwe know this, because this is why we\n\n294\n00:18:42.339 --> 00:18:48.569\nhave changed control, this is why we raise\nissues, we know that requirements change.\n\n295\n00:18:48.569 --> 00:18:51.486\nAnd, as those three\nmonths have gone by and\n\n296\n00:18:51.486 --> 00:18:56.940\nI haven't got my 75 inch iPad which,\nis what I was really really looking for.\n\n297\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.288\nWell, this new things that have come out\non the market place in that point in time.\n\n298\n00:19:01.288 --> 00:19:07.636\nSo therefore, my requirements have changed\nand my tolerances have changed now,\n\n299\n00:19:07.636 --> 00:19:13.156\nbecause what turned out to be\na co-tab is now definitely a tab,\n\n300\n00:19:13.156 --> 00:19:15.829\nyeah I should actually have this.\n\n301\n00:19:15.829 --> 00:19:21.230\nSo I could have it in white, or it could\nhave been in any operating system.\n\n302\n00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.975\nBut now I know I want it in purple and\n\n303\n00:19:23.975 --> 00:19:28.825\nnow I know that I want it in\nwindows operating system,okay?\n\n304\n00:19:28.825 --> 00:19:30.480\nSo things do change.\n\n305\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.720\nBut we also exceed tolerances as well.\n\n306\n00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.744\nWe also exceed tolerances in a good way.\n\n307\n00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:42.249\nWe may come in way ahead of schedule or\nwe may come in way under budget.\n\n308\n00:19:44.532 --> 00:19:47.926\nBut let's face it,\nmost projects will if they're going to,\n\n309\n00:19:47.926 --> 00:19:52.480\nwell if they're not gonna come in on\nbudget, they tend to come over budget.\n\n310\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.425\nAnd so, we may exceed\ntolerances in another way, so\n\n311\n00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:59.245\nwe have to have a way,\nremembering we're managing by exception.\n\n312\n00:19:59.245 --> 00:20:03.415\nWe have to have a way of managing this.\n\n313\n00:20:03.415 --> 00:20:08.125\nWe have to have a way of dealing with\nwhen tolerances are exceeded, or\n\n314\n00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:11.215\nrather when tolerances are threatened.\n\n315\n00:20:11.215 --> 00:20:13.445\nIf we know that a tolerance\nis going to be threatened,\n\n316\n00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:17.330\nwe know the threshold is going to\nbe threatened, and then we need to\n\n317\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:22.060\ndo something about it as soon as possible,\nand again the managing by exception.\n\n318\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.230\nSo we wanna ensure that\nwe can control progress.\n\n319\n00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:35.080\nYou don't just, and this is something that\nI like to sort of make sure that everybody\n\n320\n00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.220\nis aware, that we don't just start off\nthe project, and then give everybody all\n\n321\n00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:43.120\nof their activities, print off and\nthen walk away and leave a project.\n\n322\n00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.450\nThat's not what project\nmanagement is all about.\n\n323\n00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:49.370\nProject management is about\ncontrolling the project throughout.\n\n324\n00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.610\nThere is an assumption.\n\n325\n00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:56.373\nThere's an implicit assumption that\nif you've got the plan in writing,\n\n326\n00:20:56.373 --> 00:21:00.802\nwe've all got as part of the planning, we\nensure that we've got the relevant skills,\n\n327\n00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:03.896\nwith the developers and\nwith all of the support teams etc.,\n\n328\n00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:05.741\nto be able to complete the product.\n\n329\n00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:09.917\nThen if we've got all of that in place and\nwe've got all of the activities mapped out\n\n330\n00:21:09.917 --> 00:21:12.374\nthen everything should move smoothly,\nright?\n\n331\n00:21:12.374 --> 00:21:17.514\nI mean, this could be no issue at all, so\nin theory I can just come up with planner,\n\n332\n00:21:17.514 --> 00:21:21.326\nI can just hand it over to you and\nthen just walk away, right?\n\n333\n00:21:21.326 --> 00:21:24.478\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I guess in theory\nyou could do that,\n\n334\n00:21:24.478 --> 00:21:28.950\nI think practically it's\na different state of affairs.\n\n335\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:29.568\n&gt;&gt; Right but\n\n336\n00:21:29.568 --> 00:21:34.212\nthen whose head is gonna be on\nthe chopping block when it all goes wrong?\n\n337\n00:21:34.212 --> 00:21:38.969\n&gt;&gt; I can't answer that, I have seen\nsome things that are like a weird movie\n\n338\n00:21:38.969 --> 00:21:42.160\nat the end where you go I\ndid not see that coming.\n\n339\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.617\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where you go,\n\n340\n00:21:43.617 --> 00:21:46.759\nthey're definitely the one that's gonna\nbe, wait a minute, it's my fault?\n\n341\n00:21:46.759 --> 00:21:48.560\nHow is it my fault?\n\n342\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.479\nSo, I'm probably not the best\nperson to answer this [LAUGH] job.\n\n343\n00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.962\n&gt;&gt; Not that he's jaded in\nthis slide [LAUGH] that is.\n\n344\n00:21:55.962 --> 00:21:57.104\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, not.\n\n345\n00:21:57.104 --> 00:22:02.270\n&gt;&gt; But, you know that actually brings in\nan important point to be honest because,\n\n346\n00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:07.530\nI've seen a lot of developers that are\ncompletely jaded by project management.\n\n347\n00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.260\nThat absolutely constant project\nmanagement and as soon as you walk into\n\n348\n00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.130\nan environment you say, right okay,\nwe're gonna kick off this project.\n\n349\n00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.670\nThere's this collecting growing from\neverybody that it's going to be painful,\n\n350\n00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.630\nit shouldn't be.\n\n351\n00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.950\nIt shouldn't be painful.\n\n352\n00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:31.100\nProject management if it's done correctly,\nevery thing should move smoothly.\n\n353\n00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.284\nWe've had discussions in previous episodes\nwhere we've look at the requirement for\n\n354\n00:22:36.284 --> 00:22:40.490\ndocumentation, the requirements for\nmonitoring progress.\n\n355\n00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:45.940\nThe requirements for justification\nof exactly how far we've gone,\n\n356\n00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.210\nor exactly how much money we spent.\n\n357\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.735\nBut if we don't do any of that,\nthen we just end up with chaos anyway,\n\n358\n00:22:53.735 --> 00:22:56.430\nthere has to be an element of structure.\n\n359\n00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:02.570\nMonitoring progress,\ncontrolling progress, is about structure.\n\n360\n00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.213\nIt's about being aware of\nwhere we are in the project,\n\n361\n00:23:06.213 --> 00:23:10.744\nand ensuring that the project meets\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n362\n00:23:10.744 --> 00:23:15.817\nAnd ensuring that, I love the fact,\nI mean, it's kind of hidden in\n\n363\n00:23:15.817 --> 00:23:21.701\nthe middle of the capturing and\nreviewing lessons, where we've gone wrong.\n\n364\n00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:25.733\nThis is not an excuse to point fingers and\nblame,\n\n365\n00:23:25.733 --> 00:23:30.605\nif some going wrong then what that is,\nis that is a, it's a lesson for\n\n366\n00:23:30.605 --> 00:23:35.142\nthe future, it's something that\nwe can apply to a new project,\n\n367\n00:23:35.142 --> 00:23:40.688\nit's something that we can apply to\na later stage in this particular project,\n\n368\n00:23:40.688 --> 00:23:43.744\nIt should not be about a portion and\nblame.\n\n369\n00:23:43.744 --> 00:23:48.112\nAnd so we should all be able to,\nthe developers right the way through to\n\n370\n00:23:48.112 --> 00:23:51.889\nthe project manager and\nproject board, we should all be able\n\n371\n00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:56.352\nto review the lessons learned with\na very very objective perspective.\n\n372\n00:23:56.352 --> 00:24:01.004\nSo that we can apply those\nlessons learned in the future.\n\n373\n00:24:01.004 --> 00:24:06.651\nUltimately, what we want to be able\nto do is to define our approach\n\n374\n00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:14.268\nto how we're going to control a project in\nour project implementation documentation.\n\n375\n00:24:14.268 --> 00:24:18.438\nAnd we should define how we're\ngoing to manage by stages,\n\n376\n00:24:18.438 --> 00:24:23.110\nhow we're going to perform all\nof our progress reporting.\n\n377\n00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:28.560\nWhat time-based reporting we're going\nto perform, what event-based reporting\n\n378\n00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:35.630\nwe're going to undertake as well, and\nwhat tolerances we're going to manage by.\n\n379\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.800\nWhat are our tolerances for time?\n\n380\n00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.620\nWhat are our tolerances for cost?\n\n381\n00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.302\nWhat are our tolerances for\noutput, for instance?\n\n382\n00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:50.290\nUltimately, what we're trying to\ndo is align with our organization.\n\n383\n00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:56.330\nBut we've also got to align with the\ncontrols that we want to have within our\n\n384\n00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:01.190\nproject management, appear more a project\nmanagement office for portfolio and\n\n385\n00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.940\nfor program controlling.\n\n386\n00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:08.770\nIt goes back to what we said in\na previous episode about consistency, and\n\n387\n00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:14.660\nabout having appropriate controls in\nplace that allow us to be flexible,\n\n388\n00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:19.970\nthat allow each project to run smoothly\nbut still allow for that consistency.\n\n389\n00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.930\nThat as an outsider, I can come\ninto an organization and I can say,\n\n390\n00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:29.332\nlet me see how the progress of\nany particular project is doing.\n\n391\n00:25:29.332 --> 00:25:33.700\nLet me see if this project is\nbeing managed efficiently.\n\n392\n00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.316\nRemember the word efficient.\n\n393\n00:25:35.316 --> 00:25:38.070\nI like that word,\nit's what we're striving for.\n\n394\n00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.520\nIf we have consistency in place,\n\n395\n00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.360\nI was gonna say I'm trying to avoid\nusing the word template because\n\n396\n00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:50.260\na template is just a from that you\nfill out and that's not what I want.\n\n397\n00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.270\nWhat I want and\nwhat we should be aiming for\n\n398\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.360\nis a consistent approach\nto managing our project.\n\n399\n00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.500\nSo a consistent approach when it comes\nto things like our milestone charts and\n\n400\n00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.700\nour Kanban boards and\nour burn down charts.\n\n401\n00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.133\nThat's what we're looking for.\n\n402\n00:26:05.133 --> 00:26:07.411\nWe're looking for a consistent approach.\n\n403\n00:26:07.411 --> 00:26:09.214\nAnd in fact, as we carry on,\n\n404\n00:26:09.214 --> 00:26:13.818\nyou'll see that we've got lots of\ndocumentation here that you may use.\n\n405\n00:26:13.818 --> 00:26:16.315\nBut then this is what I expect,\n\n406\n00:26:16.315 --> 00:26:20.937\nwhy I expect to have progress\nto be reported using these.\n\n407\n00:26:20.937 --> 00:26:25.343\nAnd I also expect you to have templates,\nand I am using that word here,\n\n408\n00:26:25.343 --> 00:26:28.630\nexpect templates for each of these.\n\n409\n00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:35.100\nSo if I look at an issue register from\none project, whilst it might have\n\n410\n00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.410\ndifferent things on, the issue register\nitself, the look and feel of it,\n\n411\n00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:44.410\nshould look exactly the same as\nthe issue register from another project,\n\n412\n00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:48.580\nwhich should look exactly the same as the\nissue register from another project too.\n\n413\n00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:54.770\nHaving that consistency means that\nwe're not reinventing the wheel.\n\n414\n00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.020\nWe're not having to start off\nwith a blank piece of paper.\n\n415\n00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.910\nAnd more importantly, we do have\nthat documentation that demonstrates\n\n416\n00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:10.568\nthe progress of the project that anybody\ncan look at, and that anybody can view and\n\n417\n00:27:10.568 --> 00:27:15.320\nsee where the project has got\nto in terms of deliverables.\n\n418\n00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:21.010\nAnd it's understood by everybody\nbecause they're used to seeing.\n\n419\n00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.871\nSo what we've looked at right now,\nthen, is our last thing,\n\n420\n00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:27.267\nwe've looked at our progress theme.\n\n421\n00:27:27.267 --> 00:27:31.661\nAnd when we come back, what we're\ngoing to do in our next episode is\n\n422\n00:27:31.661 --> 00:27:35.830\nwe're going to start off by\nlooking at our project processes.\n\n423\n00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.080\n&gt;&gt; Project processes.\n\n424\n00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.668\nThose are things where I've\nbeen part of companies where,\n\n425\n00:27:41.668 --> 00:27:43.740\nwe don't need any processes.\n\n426\n00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.840\nIt'll be all right.\n\n427\n00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.740\nWe'll just do it ad hoc.\n\n428\n00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.490\nI strongly recommend you don't do that.\n\n429\n00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.294\nSo definitely join us on back as\nwe start looking at processes.\n\n430\n00:27:51.294 --> 00:27:54.822\nAnd well, as Jo said,\nwe've kind of finished up themes.\n\n431\n00:27:54.822 --> 00:27:56.796\nI'm sure they'll, well,\nbecause they're a theme,\n\n432\n00:27:56.796 --> 00:27:59.160\nthey'll continue to come back up\nhere in the rest of this course.\n\n433\n00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.170\nBut for now, we're gonna ahead and\nget out here.\n\n434\n00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.050\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n435\n00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:04.763\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n436\n00:28:04.763 --> 00:28:05.808\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n437\n00:28:05.808 --> 00:28:12.473\n[MUSIC]\n\n438\n00:28:12.473 --> 00:28:15.651\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n4\n00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:12.998\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:15.117\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.117 --> 00:00:20.660\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\nback with more PRINCE2 2017 foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.290\nAnd well, in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at our introduction to processes\n\n8\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.334\nand here to help us along on that\nvery endeavor is the one and only Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:29.000\nJo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.670\nHow do you do today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n11\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.082\nThank you Justin, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and\n\n12\n00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:37.698\nyou know we kind of alluded to of\nthe previous episode, I am firm believer,\n\n13\n00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:40.630\nthat there should be no\nprocesses in anything,\n\n14\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.935\neverybody should do everything\nin their own way, is that right?\n\n15\n00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:49.218\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna go out on a limb and\nsay no.\n\n16\n00:00:49.218 --> 00:00:51.200\nAnd I wanna be explicit here.\n\n17\n00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.934\nI say that.\n\n18\n00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:57.427\nWith strong, dripping sarcasm.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes,\n\n19\n00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:01.019\nI just wonder why I'm here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] well,\n\n20\n00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.810\nI know why you're here.\n\n21\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.364\nYou're here to help us be better and well,\n\n22\n00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:09.765\nproject management, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n23\n00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:12.070\nthat was the intention, yeah.\n\n24\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.791\nBut, you know,\nthere's such a thing as a lost cause.\n\n25\n00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:17.815\nJust gonna lay that one out there.\n\n26\n00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:21.084\nNo, no Justin,\nwe're never lost course honest.\n\n27\n00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:25.612\nBut, yeah, what we're gonna be looking\nat in this particular episode is we\n\n28\n00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:28.815\nliterally going to do\nan introduction to processes.\n\n29\n00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:31.145\nWe're gonna look at what a process is.\n\n30\n00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:36.845\nAnd before we get into all of our episodes\nwhere we look at specific processes\n\n31\n00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:41.310\nwithin particular project management,\nwe wanna look at the concept of a process.\n\n32\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.120\nSo really, what we're going to be doing,\nis we are going to be discussing quiet\n\n33\n00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.590\na lot and you're gonna see me try to\nconvince just in the little process,\n\n34\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.780\nit's really a good idea, I'm in,\nyou know, we wanna be efficient, right.\n\n35\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.250\nSo what we're gonna do is and\nI've got something here.\n\n36\n00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.439\nIs that you all need and it's this.\n\n37\n00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.938\nI know,\nit's quite a ton really it's quite big.\n\n38\n00:02:06.938 --> 00:02:11.912\nBut in chapter 13, which is what we'll\nbe looking at, and you can see that when\n\n39\n00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:16.595\nyou look at your book, we'll be looking\nat an introduction to processes and\n\n40\n00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:21.528\nthere is going to be quite a few diagrams,\nand as I always say if it's in purple.\n\n41\n00:02:21.528 --> 00:02:23.358\n&gt;&gt; It's from the PRINCE2 books.\n\n42\n00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:27.835\nI wasn't aware,\nI was like what a, it's my turn.\n\n43\n00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:32.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you see something in purple in any\n\n44\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.090\nof the downloadable material that you've\ngot there then it means that it's\n\n45\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.600\ndirectly from the PRINCE2 book and\nit's a diagram directly from that book.\n\n46\n00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.689\nWhat do you think process is?\n&gt;&gt; A process is a structured set of\n\n47\n00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:52.115\nactivities to accomplish a common goal.\n&gt;&gt; He's been reading.\n\n48\n00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:55.158\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I couldn't help it,\n\n49\n00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:59.794\nI've been trying to follow along with and\nI admit, I kinda let the cat out of\n\n50\n00:02:59.794 --> 00:03:02.427\nthe bag [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, right, so\n\n51\n00:03:02.427 --> 00:03:06.330\nI just wanna mention\na couple of things in here.\n\n52\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.290\nObviously, PRINCE2 is originally\nfrom the UK government and well,\n\n53\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.250\nit's actually managed and\ncontrolled now by XLS.\n\n54\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.880\nWhich means that it's the same people.\n\n55\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.385\nThe same organization that\ncontrol management of risk MOR,\n\n56\n00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:30.409\nmanagement of successful programs, PRINCE2\nproject management and of course IT.\n\n57\n00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.180\nFew others too.\n\n58\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.825\nSo that means that what we want to do and\nit's exactly the same as with the other\n\n59\n00:03:36.825 --> 00:03:40.825\nmethodologies that there are out there,\nand we've got quite a few\n\n60\n00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:44.492\ngovernance methodologies in our\nlibrary for you to look at.\n\n61\n00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:49.020\nWhat we're trying to do is we're\ntrying to maintain some consistency.\n\n62\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.140\nAnd I talk about consistency a lot\nthroughout all of our governance shows and\n\n63\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.180\nagain we've got exactly the same\ndefinition of a process\n\n64\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.560\nhere as the definition of a process that\nyou'd find in ITEL as a definition of\n\n65\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.750\na process that you would find in MOR or\nin MSP.\n\n66\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.113\nWe've got the same definition,\na process is a structure set of\n\n67\n00:04:12.113 --> 00:04:16.247\nactivities designed to\naccomplish a specific objective.\n\n68\n00:04:16.247 --> 00:04:20.530\nAnd all the words a process\nis something that you do.\n\n69\n00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.470\nSo just before we start to this particular\nepisode, Justin was saying to me.\n\n70\n00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.029\nQuite tongue in cheek.\n\n71\n00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:33.963\nBut Justin was saying to me about\nthe sort of, as a developer he's been\n\n72\n00:04:33.963 --> 00:04:38.830\nin various environments where people\njust wanna do their own thing.\n\n73\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.140\nThat's great, isn't it?\n\n74\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.690\nI mean, what's wrong?\n\n75\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.089\nIf you've got a developer and\nyou've got a group of developers and\n\n76\n00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:48.793\nthey've all got their own specialists\nskills, what's wrong with just\n\n77\n00:04:48.793 --> 00:04:51.210\nletting them do what they wanna do?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n78\n00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.515\none of the most frustrating things for\nme was lack of efficiency.\n\n79\n00:04:54.515 --> 00:04:58.939\nLike if I was meant to help with\nsomething, something went something\n\n80\n00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:03.379\nwent awry there was an exception or,\nhey, I need you to help on this.\n\n81\n00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.290\nWhat is all of that action?\n\n82\n00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.314\nLike I couldn't tell,\n\n83\n00:05:08.314 --> 00:05:12.610\nit took way more time to get up to speed.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n84\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.510\n&gt;&gt; Or what I figured was a very simple\n\n85\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.025\ntask or like a set of things to do.\n\n86\n00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:21.520\nIt just took me a lot of time to dig in,\nbut\n\n87\n00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.250\nalso, it leads to disjointedness,\nlack of maintainability.\n\n88\n00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.370\nAnd to some extent, sometimes,\n\n89\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.600\na breakdown in personal relationships.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n90\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.296\n&gt;&gt; Why'd you do it this way?\n\n91\n00:05:36.296 --> 00:05:40.005\nYou're wrong and part of it has\nto do with personality type.\n\n92\n00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:42.618\n&gt;&gt; Well, the reason why I ask Justin and\n\n93\n00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:47.421\nthe reason why I don't quite\nunderstand here in breach is because of\n\n94\n00:05:47.421 --> 00:05:49.029\nthe simple fact that.\n\n95\n00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.508\nI can tell you til I'm blue in the face,\n\n96\n00:05:52.508 --> 00:05:56.980\nwhat benefits there are in\nfollowing processes.\n\n97\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.612\nWhat benefits there are, and\nI'll use words like consistency,\n\n98\n00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:04.391\nI'll use words like structure,\nI'll use words like efficiency.\n\n99\n00:06:04.391 --> 00:06:09.594\nBut the amount of time people say to me,\nbut that's just too much red tape,\n\n100\n00:06:09.594 --> 00:06:14.228\nit's too bureaucratic.\n&gt;&gt; But the fact of the matter is that when\n\n101\n00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:19.025\nwe talk about in a project,\nfirst project processes, not so\n\n102\n00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:23.822\neasy for me to say [LAUGH] project\nprocesses are processes that\n\n103\n00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:28.262\nare invariably undertaken\nby people like developers.\n\n104\n00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:33.574\nAnd so, it makes some more sense for\nme to let Justin tell you about\n\n105\n00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:40.880\nthe effects of not having processes in\nplace, because it's him that it affects.\n\n106\n00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.920\nHe's the developer and he's the one\nthat is in an environment where well,\n\n107\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.820\nchaos reigns.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n108\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.780\nI think there's actually\na management used at a few places,\n\n109\n00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.690\nthey call it developer anarchy where\ndevelopers do whatever they want to.\n\n110\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.640\nYou come in during the day and\nyou go I'm gonna do that.\n\n111\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.510\nIt sounds good in principle,\nbecause it allows creative processes, but\n\n112\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.290\nwith that said, I hear the kickback\non it's too bureaucratic.\n\n113\n00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.326\nIt's too much red tape,\nit takes too much time,\n\n114\n00:07:13.326 --> 00:07:18.143\nI'm like I don't think you're accounting\nfor how much time is spent going,\n\n115\n00:07:18.143 --> 00:07:20.680\nI have no idea what's going on, right.\n\n116\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.180\nSo it's funny, I used to be one of\nthose people like, let me do my thing.\n\n117\n00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.640\nBut now, I've slowly come to,\nif we just had, I don't know,\n\n118\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.400\na three-step, here's what you do,\nhere's what you do, here's what,\n\n119\n00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.410\nwhen you're trying to accomplish\nthis particular task.\n\n120\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.271\nThen everybody gets, I know what we've\ngot to do, and there's no ambiguity.\n\n121\n00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:43.317\n&gt;&gt; Right, and this is why,\n\n122\n00:07:43.317 --> 00:07:47.799\nlike I said this is why I let\nJustin tell you exactly what\n\n123\n00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:52.790\nthe advantages are to you\nof following a process.\n\n124\n00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.589\nIt's not about bureaucracy.\n\n125\n00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:59.136\nTrust me, we do not put a process\nin place to create bureaucracy.\n\n126\n00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:02.471\nIt's not in my best interest\nto create bureaucracy,\n\n127\n00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:04.778\nbecause it's more for me to manage.\n\n128\n00:08:04.778 --> 00:08:07.298\nSo it's not in my best\ninterest to do that.\n\n129\n00:08:07.298 --> 00:08:12.548\nIt's not in my best interest to create\na cumbersome way of working for\n\n130\n00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:19.260\nyou because trust me, I've got to listen\nto it in my ear when you are not happy.\n\n131\n00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.820\nIt's not in my best interest to do that,\nthe reason why we create processes.\n\n132\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.890\nJust because of exactly what\nJustin's just been saying.\n\n133\n00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.620\nIn that you end up with chaos\nif we don't have process.\n\n134\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.300\nNow, process brings inconsistency.\n\n135\n00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:42.370\nNot just to Justin, but also brings\ninconsistency to me, as a project manager.\n\n136\n00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.540\nSo I have a certain set of report.\n\n137\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.380\nI have a certain set of templates.\n\n138\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.390\nAnd we've looked at some of those to do\nwith the themes in our previous episodes.\n\n139\n00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:58.375\nAnd so\nI have a consistency to the reporting and\n\n140\n00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:01.395\nto the progress of a project.\n\n141\n00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:04.565\nSo I'm able to look at any\nsay issue register and\n\n142\n00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:08.915\nI'm able to identify what\nan issue register looks like.\n\n143\n00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:12.445\nI don't need to go to Justin and\nsay show me your issue register.\n\n144\n00:09:12.445 --> 00:09:15.675\nI can look at what's on his desk and\nsay that's an issue register.\n\n145\n00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:18.065\nThat must be from this particular project.\n\n146\n00:09:18.065 --> 00:09:19.865\nLet's see what issues we've got.\n\n147\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.030\nSo it actually makes it easier for\nme to manage as well.\n\n148\n00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.820\nIt's not just about it being easier for\nthe developers.\n\n149\n00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.820\nIt's also about it being easier for\nthe project managers too.\n\n150\n00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.995\nSo a process,\nstructured set of activities.\n\n151\n00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:40.285\nIt brings inconsistency and\nit brings inefficiency, but\n\n152\n00:09:40.285 --> 00:09:43.415\nthe one thing that we shouldn't\ndo is bring in bureaucracy.\n\n153\n00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:47.715\nAnd I will tell you now that a process\nshould efficient as it possibly can be.\n\n154\n00:09:47.715 --> 00:09:53.775\nAnd if somebody's telling you or\nsomebody's telling me, that the process\n\n155\n00:09:53.775 --> 00:09:58.630\nis too bureaucratic and then quite simply,\nyou've defined the process wrong.\n\n156\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.150\nBecause if you brought\nin too much red tape,\n\n157\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.740\nthen that's not an efficient process.\n&gt;&gt; So Jo,\n\n158\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.330\nI was kind of thinking about this.\n\n159\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.900\nAnd I think sometimes this\nis a matter of perspective.\n\n160\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.430\nSo a process should lead\nto a standardized autonomy.\n\n161\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.200\nFor individuals would you say\nthat on accurate statement right,\n\n162\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:24.090\nwhat I mean is I don't have come to you\nand go, now how do we do this again?\n\n163\n00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.260\nBut I don't want too much work.\n\n164\n00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.663\nI didn't step one I have to submet\nthis to you for approval and\n\n165\n00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:34.420\nthen I what I should be able\nto do I say this is how we do.\n\n166\n00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.020\nPlus thing X.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n167\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.870\n&gt;&gt; I can go do it without asking you\n\n168\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.110\nor to some extent,\nfiguring out what to do on my own, right?\n\n169\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.900\nI should have some amount\nof standardization.\n\n170\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.930\nBut allow me to undertake\n\n171\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.247\nthe task at hand.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n172\n00:10:54.247 --> 00:10:56.402\n&gt;&gt; A big complaint from developers is that\n\n173\n00:10:56.402 --> 00:11:01.042\nproject managers will micro manage them,\nquite often when project managers don't\n\n174\n00:11:01.042 --> 00:11:05.830\nnecessarily know what developers are\ndoing, they're not particularly technical.\n\n175\n00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.300\nWell a lot of that is because you\nare not following the process.\n\n176\n00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.090\nSo if you are not following\nprocesses that have been set out for\n\n177\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.310\nyou because maybe you perceive\nthem to be too bureaucratic.\n\n178\n00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.575\nIf you are not following them,\n\n179\n00:11:18.575 --> 00:11:22.080\nthen I'm going to be micromanaging you\nbecause I want to know what you are doing.\n\n180\n00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.950\nSo If I put a process in place,\n\n181\n00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.120\nif you follow it, I'm going to trust\nthat you're following the process and\n\n182\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.470\nI'm going to leave you alone and you can\nthen get on with producing your work.\n\n183\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.030\nYou can get on with\nworking to your speed and\n\n184\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.220\nworking in your way and\nI'm just going to trust.\n\n185\n00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.300\nThat you're gonna produce\nthe right output.\n\n186\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.300\nBut if you're not gonna follow\nthe process, if you're gonna say, no,\n\n187\n00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.300\nI want to do this completely my own way,\nthen I don't have any trust.\n\n188\n00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.490\nI don't know that\nthe output's being produced.\n\n189\n00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.610\nIf you don't have anything\nconsistent to show me,\n\n190\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.080\nI can't compare you're progress\nwith somebody else's progress.\n\n191\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.380\nBecause I'm comparing apples with oranges\nbecause you're both working in different\n\n192\n00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.660\nways, so it makes it really difficult for\nme to manage.\n\n193\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.420\nAnd so because it's difficult for\nme to manage, I'm going to micromanage\n\n194\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.430\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK], In that same breath,\n\n195\n00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.395\nshouldn't so.\n&gt;&gt; I agree I think that's kinda\n\n196\n00:12:26.395 --> 00:12:29.830\nthe impetus for a lot of it,\nI wanna make sure that you're doing what I\n\n197\n00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.280\nexpect you to do because.\n&gt;&gt; Well I wanna make sure we're\n\n198\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.460\nachieving progress,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n199\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.670\n&gt;&gt; that's what I wanna make sure.\n\n200\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.900\n&gt;&gt; With that said if we have\n\n201\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.440\nlet's say it's a relatively new process,\nright and this is kind of a project.\n\n202\n00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.960\nIt came together and\nthen it leads to this.\n\n203\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.500\nShould me as a developer\nbe able to provide input\n\n204\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.410\nin order to improve said process?\n\n205\n00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.660\nShould that be part of the goal?\n\n206\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.200\nOr am I outside of my bounds and\nmy capacity?\n\n207\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.020\nI use developer because\n\n208\n00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.290\nthat's my experience.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n209\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.670\n&gt;&gt; But I'm just saying, someone where.\n\n210\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.470\nSomeone on the team is\nmeant to use that process.\n\n211\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.970\nBut if it's not working, he had\nthe project manager make micromanage.\n\n212\n00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.320\nBut also,\nshouldn't there be a feedback loop?\n\n213\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.990\nWhere maybe at the end of a stage or\n\n214\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.600\nsomething like that, you go hey,\nwe're not quite sure this is\n\n215\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.470\nworking how we thought it was going to be.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.110\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if we can improve it.\n\n217\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:31.060\nThat should be part of the respective,\nthat's a process of itself.\n\n218\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.230\n&gt;&gt; And to be pefectly honest,\n\n219\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.140\nwe talk about developers and\nthis is one of the reasons wht you and\n\n220\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.330\nI are sort of working together right now\nbecause what we're doing is,you know,\n\n221\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.320\nI'm talking about managing\nthe work that you do.\n\n222\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.310\nThat's exactly what we\ndo within a project.\n\n223\n00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.920\nIf you wanna know more about and\n\n224\n00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.450\nyou wanna get more into depth in defining\na process and how we define a process.\n\n225\n00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.320\nAnd looking at the feedback loops because\nyes you used the term there which\n\n226\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.160\nI'm very impressed with because that's\nexactly what we call it with a process.\n\n227\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.040\nIs that there should be\na feedback loop in place.\n\n228\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.160\n&gt;&gt; To allow for process improvement.\n\n229\n00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.640\nAnd if you want to know more about that,\n\n230\n00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.570\nthen I'm going to recommend\nthat you go to our IT series.\n\n231\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.410\nRemember what I said to you about\nthe fact that we've got common themes\n\n232\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.230\nthat go throughout all of our\nmanagement methodologies.\n\n233\n00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.431\nYou can go to our IT series and\ngo into foundation and\n\n234\n00:14:22.431 --> 00:14:26.302\nlook in one of the very early\nepisodes where we talk about how to\n\n235\n00:14:26.302 --> 00:14:30.080\ndefine a process.\n&gt;&gt; You can also go to\n\n236\n00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.760\nour IT practitioner episode or series and\n\n237\n00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.410\nyou'll see there that we talk\nabout defining processes as well.\n\n238\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.370\nNow it goes into a lot more\ndepth then we need to go to here\n\n239\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.070\nat foundation level in project management.\n\n240\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.220\nBut essentially,\nwhat we're doing, and by the way,\n\n241\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.860\nif you do that, that's literally just for\nyour own understanding,\n\n242\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.150\nit's not something that's required for\nthe foundation within PRINCE2.\n\n243\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.190\nBut it certainly talks about how\nwe don't just define a process but\n\n244\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.670\nalso how we develop a process\nin an ongoing basis,\n\n245\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.330\nin other words how we\nperform process improvement\n\n246\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:15.340\nhow we evaluate that a process is as\nefficient as it possibly could be.\n\n247\n00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.730\nAnd this is effective\nas it could be as well.\n\n248\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.970\nA process should be both effective and\nefficient.\n\n249\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.880\nEffective means it should do\nwhat it is supposed to do.\n\n250\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.720\nBut it should also do\nit in an efficient way.\n\n251\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.820\nAnd efficiency, we talk about minimal\nwaste and insuring that we do it with\n\n252\n00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:38.740\nminimal time and minimal cost,\nminimal skills, why?\n\n253\n00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.870\nNow when I say minimal skills,\nI mean minimal wastage in terms of skills.\n\n254\n00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.960\nLet me just ask you this question.\n\n255\n00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.010\nSomebody whose over skilled for\na particular role.\n\n256\n00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.687\nThey're gonna be good at their job then,\naren't they?\n\n257\n00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:57.804\n&gt;&gt; You would think however I have found if\n\n258\n00:15:57.804 --> 00:16:03.953\nit is not challenging, you have this\nweird boredom possible recentment.\n\n259\n00:16:03.953 --> 00:16:07.210\nWell they're not using me\nto the best of my capacity.\n\n260\n00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:11.025\nYou may not get the output that\nyou expect from that arrangement.\n\n261\n00:16:11.025 --> 00:16:12.592\n&gt;&gt; No, and in fact actually,\n\n262\n00:16:12.592 --> 00:16:16.956\nan over-skilled person is just as\ninefficient in performing processes and\n\n263\n00:16:16.956 --> 00:16:20.670\nperforming their work as\nan under-skilled person.\n\n264\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.670\nBut there's a huge big difference,\nyou actually get and\n\n265\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.650\nthis is sort of a proven fact.\n\n266\n00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.900\nYou actually get better quality\nout of an under skilled person\n\n267\n00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.280\nthan you do out of an over skilled person.\n\n268\n00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.070\nBecause an under skilled person will go\nout of their way to find out how to do\n\n269\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.270\nsomething.\n\n270\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.745\nWhereas an over skilled person,\nthey kind of do it within next week,\n\n271\n00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:42.570\nthey're not giving it a 100%.\n\n272\n00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:47.760\nAnd actually a process is more\nefficient if it's being performed\n\n273\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.400\nby an under-skilled person, then it is\nbeing performed by an over-skilled person.\n\n274\n00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.110\nNow, I know that that would sound like\na generalization, but it is a proven fact.\n\n275\n00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.530\nThere are statistics\nthat would support that.\n\n276\n00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.360\nAnd so when we talked about efficiency,\nit's not just about\n\n277\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.620\nhaving the right process, and\nthe process should be incredibly flexible.\n\n278\n00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.990\nIt's also having the right people\nto perform the role as well, and\n\n279\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:16.280\ngetting the right people involved that\nI've got that right skill level too.\n\n280\n00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:23.400\nSo take a look then, we've talked about\nthe processes or what a process is, let's\n\n281\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.970\ntake a look at the PRINCE2 processes,\nand remember what I said to you about\n\n282\n00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:33.200\nchapter 13 in your PRINCE2 book which\nis just an introduction to processes.\n\n283\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.660\nAnd these are the processes that you have.\n\n284\n00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:42.040\nNow you'll see, so right along the top\nyou've got a timeline, pre-project,\n\n285\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:48.530\ninitiation stage, any subsequent stages\ndepending on the scale of the project.\n\n286\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.310\nThen final stage, and\nthen post project, afterwards.\n\n287\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.630\nAnd then you'll see down the left hand\nside you've also got delivery managing and\n\n288\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.620\ndirecting.\n\n289\n00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.490\nSo who's going to be\ninvolved in the process?\n\n290\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.160\nSo we've got our starting up a project.\n\n291\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.850\nWe've got initiating a project,\nmanaging stage boundaries,\n\n292\n00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.840\ncontrolling stages,\nthe closing projects here.\n\n293\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.840\nSo these are our processes that we're\ngoing to be taking a look at, and\n\n294\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.840\nit really depends on how many\nsubsequent stages we have,\n\n295\n00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.160\nas to how many processes you have.\n\n296\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.110\nBut there's one thing that\nI want to mention, and\n\n297\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.770\nthis is where we're going to pretty\nmuch leave it for this episode.\n\n298\n00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.910\nIs that as we go through chapter 13,\n\n299\n00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:42.800\nyou will see various symbols or\nwill go through our PRINCE2 processes.\n\n300\n00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.060\nIn chapter 13,\nyou have these particular diagram key.\n\n301\n00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.160\nThis is a really important diagram key.\n\n302\n00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.140\nBecause it tells you that\nif in a diagram like these,\n\n303\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.970\nyou see something that is a purple\nsquare then that is a process.\n\n304\n00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:08.140\nSo let's go back you see these\nare purple squares these are processes.\n\n305\n00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.910\nBut, if it's pale purple\nthen that's an activity.\n\n306\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:18.920\nThen if it's purple and it's an oval,\nthen it's an event or a decision.\n\n307\n00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.380\nAnd then if it's white and\noval then, you get the gist.\n\n308\n00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.790\nYou don't need me to read this to you,\nokay?\n\n309\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.170\nThere is a process diagram key.\n\n310\n00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.980\nThis is really, really going to help you.\n\n311\n00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.008\nBecause as we start to\nmove into processes,\n\n312\n00:19:33.008 --> 00:19:36.750\nyou're going to see a lot of\nthese particular diagrams.\n\n313\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.780\nAnd so I want you to print\nthis page out maybe, and\n\n314\n00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.240\nthen have this with you as we're\ngoing through the processes.\n\n315\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.680\nOr maybe just keep it open in your PRINCE2\nmanual, but this is a really useful key.\n\n316\n00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.630\nAnd so when we come back in our next\nepisode that we are actually going\n\n317\n00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:59.380\nto start on our first\nPRINCE2 process which is\n\n318\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.610\nthe process of starting up a project.\n&gt;&gt; Well the process of starting a project,\n\n319\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.650\nwell there is a lot of\nPs in that sentence.\n\n320\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.424\nBut, definitely print out that key\nbecause this is one of those things where\n\n321\n00:20:11.424 --> 00:20:15.602\ngraphical kind of keys can give\nyou quick glance information, and\n\n322\n00:20:15.602 --> 00:20:17.704\nhelp build your understanding.\n\n323\n00:20:17.704 --> 00:20:19.710\nSo I totally agree with that.\n\n324\n00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.100\nI do things like that even if it's\nnot in the context of PRINCE2.\n\n325\n00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.570\nBut you're gonna have to come on back\nto see how we initiate a project\n\n326\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.800\nbecause right now we are gonna.\n&gt;&gt; Ron, we're starting up a project.\n\n327\n00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.825\n&gt;&gt; Starting up a project.\n\n328\n00:20:29.825 --> 00:20:33.330\nGotta be careful there cuz Jo\nwill get you if you use the wrong\n\n329\n00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.000\nwords.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.580\n&gt;&gt; But for this episode,\n\n331\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.350\nwe're gonna go ahead and shut it down.\n\n332\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.660\nSo signing off for ITProTV I've\nbeen your host Justin Dennison.\n\n333\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n334\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.702\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n335\n00:20:42.702 --> 00:20:49.054\n[MUSIC]\n\n336\n00:20:49.054 --> 00:20:52.072\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.252\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.252 --> 00:00:11.626\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT PRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:15.319\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:19.512\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and we're\nback with more prints to 2017 foundation.\n\n7\n00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:22.985\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntalking about starting up a project.\n\n8\n00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:26.654\nAnd here to help us along in that very\nendeavor is, well, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:27.482\nHow've you been, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:28.057\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n11\n00:00:28.057 --> 00:00:28.668\nThank you, Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:29.203\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:31.161\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n14\n00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:34.713\nSo starting out, I'll be honest,\nthis is not my forte so\n\n15\n00:00:34.713 --> 00:00:39.157\nI don't know how much I'm gonna be\nable to add to starting up a project.\n\n16\n00:00:39.157 --> 00:00:41.452\n&gt;&gt; Well you've gotta start somewhere,\nright?\n\n17\n00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:44.047\nAnd I mean don't you say to\nme this is not your forte.\n\n18\n00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:45.239\nYou are a developer.\n\n19\n00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.262\nAre you trying to tell me you've\nnever worked on any project before?\n\n20\n00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:50.854\n&gt;&gt; I have worked on them but\nI haven't been the one that's, like,\n\n21\n00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:52.054\nstarting things up, right?\n\n22\n00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:55.006\nI mean, I can start my car,\nI can start my lawn mower.\n\n23\n00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.617\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can start cooking when I get home\n\n24\n00:00:57.617 --> 00:00:58.760\n[LAUGH] to do but,\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n25\n00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.435\nwhen it comes to work you wait for\nsomebody to tell you what to do right?\n\n26\n00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.586\n&gt;&gt; yeah, I'm like I don't know what to do,\ntell me.\n\n27\n00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:07.072\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:07.661\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n29\n00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:08.238\nI don't know.\n\n30\n00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:13.044\nSometimes you see some organizations and\nsome groups of people that\n\n31\n00:01:13.044 --> 00:01:17.946\nare desperately in need of leadership\nin management and direction.\n\n32\n00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:22.243\nIn other words, any of the Justin's\nof the world don't really,\n\n33\n00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:23.805\nI think that's yeah But\n\n34\n00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:29.289\nwe are in the episode where we're gonna\nstart talking about starting up a project.\n\n35\n00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.903\nAnd we're gonna look at all\nthe prerequisites that are needed for\n\n36\n00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:34.226\nstarting up a project.\n\n37\n00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:41.092\nCan you remember what\nthe definition of a project was?\n\n38\n00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:44.633\n&gt;&gt; A definition of a project [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I got project, so\n\n39\n00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:48.294\ndefinition of a process\nI'm sorry I'm sorry.\n\n40\n00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:51.629\n&gt;&gt; I was like, it's pretty broad.\n\n41\n00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:55.030\n[LAUGH] So\nit is a structured set of activities,\n\n42\n00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.535\nthat we use,\n&gt;&gt; I don't need to show this, go on.\n\n43\n00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:03.150\n&gt;&gt; That we use to accomplish a goal,\nright, to accomplish something.\n\n44\n00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a structured set of\nactivities designed to accomplish\n\n45\n00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:08.353\na specific objective.\n\n46\n00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:13.463\nYeah, so in other words it's something\nthat we do to get something that we want.\n\n47\n00:02:13.463 --> 00:02:15.580\nYeah, that really is.\n\n48\n00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.918\nSo it's a group of things that we do.\n\n49\n00:02:17.918 --> 00:02:22.790\nBut I also like the use of the word\nstructured because a structured set\n\n50\n00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.494\nof activities means that we are doing\none thing after another, and\n\n51\n00:02:27.494 --> 00:02:29.350\nthere are dependencies.\n\n52\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.529\nSo it's structured and\nwe have consistency.\n\n53\n00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:37.302\nSo there is a consistent\nmethod of doing something.\n\n54\n00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:40.876\nIt's not ad hoc,\nwe don't wanna reinvent the wheel.\n\n55\n00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:43.997\nThis is something that we\ndo on a regular basis.\n\n56\n00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:48.760\nAnd so here what we're looking at is\nthe process of starting up a project.\n\n57\n00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.889\nAnd the purpose of that\nparticular process,\n\n58\n00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.852\nthe one we're looking at in this episode,\n\n59\n00:02:54.852 --> 00:03:00.467\nis to ensure that all of our prerequisites\nfor initiating a project are in place.\n\n60\n00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:05.034\nBut then it actually goes a little bit\nfurther in-depth and it just says and\n\n61\n00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:09.455\nI quite like this cuz sometimes I find\nthat definitions can be a little bit\n\n62\n00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:13.323\nwordy, and I'll often encourage\npeople to paraphrase them.\n\n63\n00:03:13.323 --> 00:03:17.858\nAnd whereas this one doesn't need any\nparaphrasing, because it says by answering\n\n64\n00:03:17.858 --> 00:03:20.980\nthe question do we have a viable and\nworthwhile project?\n\n65\n00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.659\nSo that's basically what you're saying is,\n\n66\n00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.272\nin order to be able to start a project\nyou've got to ask yourself is this needed?\n\n67\n00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:29.759\nIt is viable?\n\n68\n00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.847\nIs it worthwhile?\n\n69\n00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:32.324\nWhy do we want it?\n\n70\n00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:34.113\nWhat is its purpose?\n\n71\n00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.849\nWhat is it going to achieve?\n\n72\n00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.891\nIs it a viable project?\n\n73\n00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:40.394\nIs it gonna cost too much?\n\n74\n00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:45.889\nIs it kind of too, I was gonna say pie in\nthe sky but probably doesn't sound right.\n\n75\n00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.626\nIs it too,\ndo you know what I mean when I say that?\n\n76\n00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:51.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's funny because I was\nthinking just that I was like,\n\n77\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.967\ntoo pie in the sky, right?\n\n78\n00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:56.424\nYour heads are in the clouds,\nit's not achievable.\n\n79\n00:03:56.424 --> 00:03:56.965\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n80\n00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:59.326\n&gt;&gt; Or it's fantastical so to speak.\n\n81\n00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:00.622\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's too far fetched.\n\n82\n00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:06.052\nYeah, earlier on,\nprior to one of our previous episodes,\n\n83\n00:04:06.052 --> 00:04:11.821\nwe were having a discussion on\nsomething that I actually want.\n\n84\n00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:15.333\nWell, it's something that a lot\nof our entertainers want.\n\n85\n00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:20.391\nBut it's something that I I cannot deny.\n\n86\n00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:24.240\nAnd so we came up with, well it was\nin a solution, we are not there yet.\n\n87\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.330\nBut what we're trying to roll around\nis the idea of like a 75 inch iPad.\n\n88\n00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.858\nI think it was kind of the nearest\nanalogy we could come to this.\n\n89\n00:04:32.858 --> 00:04:36.075\nAnd this is what I want,\nis something that I can write on,\n\n90\n00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.898\nbut something that's\na decent size cuz I'm old.\n\n91\n00:04:38.898 --> 00:04:42.901\n[LAUGH] And so this is where we were.\n\n92\n00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:44.872\nAnd so starting off by project,\n\n93\n00:04:44.872 --> 00:04:49.618\nthis particular process is about taking\nthis idea that I've had and take in,\n\n94\n00:04:49.618 --> 00:04:54.305\nand then by the way, I don't have all\nthe ideas all the way around the world.\n\n95\n00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:57.223\nI mean, I've got some good ones but\nit's not always me.\n\n96\n00:04:57.223 --> 00:05:00.089\nIt's about taking this idea and\nthen say, okay,\n\n97\n00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:02.557\nis this available on most of our projects?\n\n98\n00:05:02.557 --> 00:05:07.187\nSo in other word, we're asking\nquestions like, are we just doing this\n\n99\n00:05:07.187 --> 00:05:11.914\nbecause Jo wants it or are we doing\nthis because this has a business need?\n\n100\n00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:16.728\nIs this going to cost too much or\nis this actually going to be\n\n101\n00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:21.167\na viable option that's going\nto give us some return?\n\n102\n00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:25.374\nIs it going to be useful in our shows and\nin our episodes?\n\n103\n00:05:25.374 --> 00:05:30.327\nSo this is what the purpose of\nthe starting up a project process is,\n\n104\n00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:33.166\nit's for simply saying well, look.\n\n105\n00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.114\nIs this good to go?\n\n106\n00:05:35.114 --> 00:05:37.894\nThat's what we're looking for right now.\n\n107\n00:05:37.894 --> 00:05:41.753\nSo take a look at the activities that\nwe're going to be performing here.\n\n108\n00:05:41.753 --> 00:05:45.098\nWe wanna make sure that we've got\nsufficient business justification, and\n\n109\n00:05:45.098 --> 00:05:48.089\nwe wanna make sure that we've got\nall of the relevant authorities.\n\n110\n00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.054\nIn other words,\neverybody that needs to, has said yes.\n\n111\n00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:55.980\nSo people that have the pull\nstrings they've said yes.\n\n112\n00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.193\nThe people that are going to be\nimpacted the users they've said yes.\n\n113\n00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:06.033\nThe developers and the development team\nhave said yes because it's something\n\n114\n00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.730\nthat's within their bandwidth.\n\n115\n00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.200\nAnd also our infrastructure team and\nour current support team they've also said\n\n116\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.813\nyes, because it's something that they\ncan accommodate in the live environment.\n\n117\n00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:21.261\nWe've also gonna make sure\nthat we've got sufficient\n\n118\n00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:25.037\ninformation to define and\nconfirm the scope.\n\n119\n00:06:25.037 --> 00:06:29.503\nWell, in this particular instance, I've\nbeen a typical user and I've kind of said,\n\n120\n00:06:29.503 --> 00:06:31.653\nyou know what I want, this is what I want.\n\n121\n00:06:31.653 --> 00:06:35.475\nAnd this is what users do,\nthey'll come to you with a solution.\n\n122\n00:06:35.475 --> 00:06:38.922\nThey won't come to you with\na list of requirements anymore,\n\n123\n00:06:38.922 --> 00:06:40.759\nthey come to you with solution.\n\n124\n00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:45.368\nSo, we've got to make sure that we've\ngot enough information to be able to\n\n125\n00:06:45.368 --> 00:06:47.794\ndefine what the project is going to do.\n\n126\n00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:52.862\nAnd what the deliverables,\nthe output of the project is going to be.\n\n127\n00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:57.804\nNow, and\nI just wanna bring this one in, and\n\n128\n00:06:57.804 --> 00:07:05.160\njust mention the fact that quite\noften a project changes, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.977\nThe requirements for\n\n130\n00:07:05.977 --> 00:07:08.521\nthe project will change throughout\nthe life cycle of the project.\n\n131\n00:07:08.521 --> 00:07:12.791\nBecause I started off with\nan idea of what I want, but\n\n132\n00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:18.244\nas we work through this,\nthings will change in the outside world.\n\n133\n00:07:18.244 --> 00:07:22.051\nIn the big sort of environment\nwhere technology may change.\n\n134\n00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:27.437\nAs we start off down this journey or\nmaybe the business model changes or maybe,\n\n135\n00:07:27.437 --> 00:07:32.430\nthere was simply had another idea and\ntherefore requirements changed.\n\n136\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.806\nHowever, and it's something that\nwe've mentioned in previous episodes,\n\n137\n00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:38.836\nwe've got to document a baseline.\n\n138\n00:07:38.836 --> 00:07:42.632\nAnd the baseline is what do we\nwanna achieve right now when this\n\n139\n00:07:42.632 --> 00:07:45.706\nproject started off,\nwhat do we want to achieve?\n\n140\n00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:51.005\nSo we have to make sure that there is\nsufficient information available for\n\n141\n00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:54.680\nus to have, a realistic,\nAnd detailed baseline,\n\n142\n00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.050\nwe've got to be able to\narticulate that baseline.\n\n143\n00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:04.010\nAnd then we're also got to be able to\nidentify how we can deliver the project.\n\n144\n00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.130\nDo we do this in agile approach or\ndo we do this in a waterfall approach?\n\n145\n00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:15.930\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question,\nI want a 75 inch iPad, okay?\n\n146\n00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.180\nWe're gonna get into some details now.\n\n147\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.340\nDo we do this in an agile approach or\nin a waterfall approach?\n\n148\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.300\n&gt;&gt; That's a tricky one.\n\n149\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.559\nSo now that you've said then,\n\n150\n00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:33.332\nfull disclosure based on my\nprevious experience I tend to go.\n\n151\n00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:35.644\nWell, let me see if I can put something,\n\n152\n00:08:35.644 --> 00:08:39.929\nmake sure that she actually wants a 75\ninch iPad, or can I simulate that?\n\n153\n00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:44.530\n&gt;&gt; Hang on let me stop you there, do you\nknow the difference between the two?\n\n154\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.930\n&gt;&gt; Between agile and waterfall?\n\n155\n00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:46.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n156\n00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.434\n&gt;&gt; So Waterfall has, my understanding-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n157\n00:08:50.434 --> 00:08:54.027\n&gt;&gt; Lengthier stages that are meant\nto be handed off, between so\n\n158\n00:08:54.027 --> 00:08:58.959\nhere's all my design, here's all of my\ndevelopment, here's all of my testing,\n\n159\n00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:02.890\nand here's my delivery, and\nthose can be lengthier stages.\n\n160\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.505\nAnd agile, I'm building small\nfeatures that come back,\n\n161\n00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:10.576\nthat I re-evaluate in a short\nperiod of time, two to four weeks.\n\n162\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.978\nI actually put my own spin,\nI think that's a very particular flavor.\n\n163\n00:09:19.978 --> 00:09:23.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is the Justin version\nof a waterfall and agile approach.\n\n164\n00:09:23.582 --> 00:09:27.670\nOkay, I'll take exception to\nthe word lengthier for a start.\n\n165\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.580\nA waterfall approach doesn't\nnecessarily need to be lengthy.\n\n166\n00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.840\nIt traditionally is, but\nit doesn't need to be lengthy.\n\n167\n00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.630\nA waterfall approach is an approach\nwhere we are delivering\n\n168\n00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.695\nthe product at the very end,\nthat's when we deliver the product.\n\n169\n00:09:41.695 --> 00:09:45.435\nSo, a waterfall approach\nis something that's useful\n\n170\n00:09:45.435 --> 00:09:49.225\nin an instance where we\nhave one product and\n\n171\n00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:53.725\nall of the functionality is delivered\nat the very end of the project.\n\n172\n00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:58.941\nNow an agile approach is an approach\nto project management where\n\n173\n00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:05.519\nwe deliver functionality on a piece by\npiece and then incremental basis, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:10.846\nSo I talked about continuous delivery but\nI do have personal issues with\n\n175\n00:10:10.846 --> 00:10:16.280\nthe use of the word continuous cuz\nit's actually a continual delivery.\n\n176\n00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.620\nIt's an iterative delivery.\n\n177\n00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:24.210\nSo, yes you're right in agile\nstages we deliver in iterations,\n\n178\n00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.190\nwe deliver in releases,\nwe build in iterations.\n\n179\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.830\nAnd where we build, we build in iterations\nthat could be anything from one to\n\n180\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.680\nfour weeks in length and\nwe release at certain intervals.\n\n181\n00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.210\nSo, we might release at the end of\nevery iteration but if it's every week,\n\n182\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.970\nwe probably won't cuz\nthat's too much disruption.\n\n183\n00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.890\nSo an agile approach,\nwe're releasing functionality bit by bit.\n\n184\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.100\nBut in a waterfall approach,\n\n185\n00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:53.630\nwe're releasing the functionality at\nthe end of the project in its entirety.\n\n186\n00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:58.100\nSo, what do you think then\nis the most appropriate for\n\n187\n00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.380\nthe example that I gave you?\n\n188\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.058\nThe example is that,\nI want a 75-inch iPad and\n\n189\n00:11:04.058 --> 00:11:07.480\nas entertainers we want\none on every studio.\n\n190\n00:11:09.825 --> 00:11:13.459\n&gt;&gt; To actually build something\nbecause as far as I know,\n\n191\n00:11:13.459 --> 00:11:18.600\nit doesn't exist I feel that would be\na better fit for a waterfall model.\n\n192\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.980\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\n\n193\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.310\n&gt;&gt; I tend to think of manufacturing\nas more of a waterfall process.\n\n194\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.930\nAnd, I know there are exceptions to that.\n\n195\n00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:26.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n196\n00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.400\n&gt;&gt; Quick aside, the other reason I\nsay lengthier is all the projects\n\n197\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.890\nthat I've been involved in that are\nwaterfall have been very, very lengthy.\n\n198\n00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.420\n&gt;&gt; You're right, and\nI'm not gonna deny that at all.\n\n199\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:46.500\nBut technically or theoretically\nit doesn't have to be lengthier.\n\n200\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.350\nIt's just that experience will tell\nyou that it quite often is, but\n\n201\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.380\nit just doesn't have to be.\n\n202\n00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.684\nBut, the example that we brought,\nthis does not lend itself\n\n203\n00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:04.208\nto having functionality released\nsort of being drip fed to me.\n\n204\n00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:08.235\nCuz what I want, is I need a solution,\nwe all want a solution,\n\n205\n00:12:08.235 --> 00:12:11.920\na specific solution,\nand we want it to work.\n\n206\n00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:18.132\nNow, there is a difference between an\nagile approach and the phased deployment.\n\n207\n00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:23.073\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not even gonna make eye contact\n\n208\n00:12:23.073 --> 00:12:25.354\nwith you, cuz I know it's gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know he's just ignoring me-\n\n209\n00:12:25.354 --> 00:12:26.307\n&gt;&gt; I know it's gonna be good-\n\n210\n00:12:26.307 --> 00:12:27.286\n&gt;&gt; At this point in time-\n\n211\n00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:28.599\n&gt;&gt; It would be so explain,\n\n212\n00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:31.499\nI'm like that's so easy,\nJo, I'll let you do it.\n\n213\n00:12:31.499 --> 00:12:34.163\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:12:34.163 --> 00:12:35.813\n&gt;&gt; The agile approach is where we\n\n215\n00:12:35.813 --> 00:12:40.960\nare building certain functionality, and\nthen we are releasing that functionality.\n\n216\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.150\nAnd then we're carrying on and we're\nbuilding in the next bit of functionality,\n\n217\n00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.910\nand then we're releasing that.\n\n218\n00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:51.420\nA phase deployment is where we\nare deploying in a phased manners.\n\n219\n00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.560\nSo one week,\nI'm gonna put it in the studio and\n\n220\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.880\nthen the next week I put in a next studio.\n\n221\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.551\nBut I'm still releasing\nexactly the same product,\n\n222\n00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:04.563\nI'm just releasing it in a phased manner.\n\n223\n00:13:04.563 --> 00:13:08.311\nI'm not gonna put it in every single\nstudio all at once because if I do that,\n\n224\n00:13:08.311 --> 00:13:11.600\nand it doesn't work,\nthen I might disrupt every single studio.\n\n225\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.330\nSo a phased approach is kind of almost\nlike dipping your toe in the water and\n\n226\n00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.260\nsaying, or is it too hard?\n\n227\n00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.400\nYou must get into a swimming pool,\ncome on, we live in Florida, right?\n\n228\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.070\nYou get into a swimming pool and\nis it better to jump in all at ones or\n\n229\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:31.095\nis it better to just tend\nto dip one toe in there and\n\n230\n00:13:31.095 --> 00:13:33.215\nthen carry on with that, [SOUND]?\n\n231\n00:13:33.215 --> 00:13:37.358\n&gt;&gt; I am probably not the greatest person\nto ask about this cuz I know it's gonna be\n\n232\n00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.803\ncold but let's go, and\nI just jump right in.\n\n233\n00:13:39.803 --> 00:13:40.841\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But for\n\n234\n00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:44.669\nthe most part I do see people like,\nlet me just stand on my steps,\n\n235\n00:13:44.669 --> 00:13:47.945\nlet me slowly get in here so\nthat it doesn't shock me.\n\n236\n00:13:47.945 --> 00:13:49.529\nNot me, it's all or nothing for me.\n\n237\n00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:53.037\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well you're here we'll talk\na little bit more about that when we talk\n\n238\n00:13:53.037 --> 00:13:56.060\nabout project delivery\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna talk about risk as well\n\n239\n00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.470\nbecause of course we've already talked\nabout the risk thing but we also talk\n\n240\n00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:06.000\nabout the risks of certain deployments,\nfazed versus big bang for instance.\n\n241\n00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.558\nSo what we're doing here in this\nparticular stage then where we\n\n242\n00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:14.686\nare starting up the project\nis making sure that we've got\n\n243\n00:14:14.686 --> 00:14:18.303\nsufficient information\nto determine the scope.\n\n244\n00:14:18.303 --> 00:14:21.660\nAnd also the ways in which\nthe project can be delivered,\n\n245\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.240\nthat's exactly what we just spoke about.\n\n246\n00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.122\nAnd so we look at the actual project\nitself, we look at what's required and\n\n247\n00:14:28.122 --> 00:14:31.380\nthen we say well what does\nit make more sense to do?\n\n248\n00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.690\nSo, in terms of the deliver\nof the 75- inch iPad,\n\n249\n00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.110\nit makes sense to do that\nin a waterfall approach.\n\n250\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.090\nDoesn't mean it's gonna take longer, but\nit also makes sense to deliver it in\n\n251\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.810\na phased manner because we don't want to\nhave every single studio that we have\n\n252\n00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.490\ndown all at the same time,\nbearing in mind that it could impact that.\n\n253\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.160\nSo other parts of starting up\nthe project include finding\n\n254\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.410\npeople that are actually going\nto help us to deliver this.\n\n255\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.110\nSo we have to find people\nwith the right skills.\n\n256\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.510\nWe may have to outsource,\n\n257\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.760\nremember in previous episodes\nwe've talked about suppliers.\n\n258\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.140\nThey can be internal or\nthey can be external as well.\n\n259\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.910\nSo this is the point in time where we\nthink about the scale of the project.\n\n260\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:23.260\nAnd we say, okay, it makes sense for\nus to outsource this particular project or\n\n261\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.160\nit makes sense for\nus to bring in temporary staff to\n\n262\n00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.660\nstaff the actual project itself.\n\n263\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.389\nOr it makes sense for\nus to do it in-house,\n\n264\n00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:40.472\nthis is why we plan how we\nare going to deliver the project.\n\n265\n00:15:43.044 --> 00:15:49.928\nAnd the bottom bullet point, it kind of\nmake sense, it's just common sense but\n\n266\n00:15:49.928 --> 00:15:55.991\nyou'd be surprised how many times\nthat we assume things in projects,\n\n267\n00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:59.895\nwe assume things in In\ndelivering the work and\n\n268\n00:15:59.895 --> 00:16:05.575\nmanaging the stages, we assume\nthat we know what the users want.\n\n269\n00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:09.237\nAnd because we don't want to keep\ngoing back to the users and saying,\n\n270\n00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:11.500\nhey is this okay, will this work?\n\n271\n00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.650\nJustin is shaking his head here.\n\n272\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.960\n&gt;&gt; And it's not surprising to me.\n\n273\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.321\nThe time that this happens with\nunsound assumptions, yeah, all right?\n\n274\n00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:22.446\nI've seen it a bunch.\n\n275\n00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:23.211\nYeah, that will be easy.\n\n276\n00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:25.737\nThis will work, this is fine,\nthis is all good.\n\n277\n00:16:25.737 --> 00:16:28.837\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've got risk management, and\n\n278\n00:16:28.837 --> 00:16:34.320\nwe've talked about evaluating risk\nin when we were looking at themes.\n\n279\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.310\nBut sometimes you need\nto make an assumption.\n\n280\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.860\nSometimes you have to have\nan expectation because, quite simply,\n\n281\n00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.780\nyou don't know what the end\nresult's going to be.\n\n282\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.290\nAnd like I said,\n\n283\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:50.760\nwe talked about this in brisk when\nwe looked at that particular thing.\n\n284\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.060\nBut the key word here\nis that word unsound,\n\n285\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.360\nif we don't have any\nsubstantive evidence for\n\n286\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.350\nany of our assumptions,\nthen why on earth are we making it.\n\n287\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:09.051\nOne of the things that I do especially\nwhen we're doing consultancy, I will\n\n288\n00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:13.542\nquite often walk into an environment and\nI will simply ask one question.\n\n289\n00:17:13.542 --> 00:17:15.882\nAnd that question is why.\n\n290\n00:17:15.882 --> 00:17:17.200\nWhy are you doing this?\n\n291\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.656\nWhy did you make that decision?\n\n292\n00:17:19.656 --> 00:17:25.380\nAnd if I cannot find evidence, yeah,\nand I wanna see things documented.\n\n293\n00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.860\nSure, keep it simple but\nI wanna see things documented.\n\n294\n00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.730\nIf I cannot find evidence as to why\na particular decision has been made,\n\n295\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.530\nthen I have to ask myself,\nwhat is the purpose of that decision?\n\n296\n00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.030\nWhat was it achieving and\n\n297\n00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.720\nhow much time then has been wasted\nbecause you made that decision?\n\n298\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.190\nWe have to ask the question why.\n\n299\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:52.930\nBecause it's not efficient if we don't\nunderstand why we're undertaking\n\n300\n00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.786\ncertain tasks, and why we\nare conducting a project in that way.\n\n301\n00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:59.881\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, if you're ask why, all right?\n\n302\n00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:03.966\nI've asked why, I go,\nwhy are we doing this?\n\n303\n00:18:03.966 --> 00:18:06.286\nI've heard this a lot,\nit's more performing\n\n304\n00:18:08.118 --> 00:18:13.041\nIt's more performant, it's faster,\nit does this thing better.\n\n305\n00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:20.083\nIs your follow-up question, do you ask,\nwell, how do you know that?\n\n306\n00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:21.415\nDo you ever ask that a question?\n\n307\n00:18:21.415 --> 00:18:26.072\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't,\nI have a saying that I use all the time.\n\n308\n00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:28.200\nAnd it comes when I'm doing assessments,\n\n309\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.045\nit comes when I'm doing any\nsort of project management.\n\n310\n00:18:31.045 --> 00:18:35.508\nAnd my saying is simply this,\ntwo words, show me.\n\n311\n00:18:35.508 --> 00:18:37.119\nSo, it's pretty much the same thing,\nright?\n\n312\n00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:38.349\n&gt;&gt; I think it's pretty\nmuch the same thing.\n\n313\n00:18:38.349 --> 00:18:39.008\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n314\n00:18:39.008 --> 00:18:42.928\n&gt;&gt; But what you're saying is our\nassumptions should be based on either\n\n315\n00:18:42.928 --> 00:18:46.035\nsubstantial, anecdotal,\nor empirical evidence-\n\n316\n00:18:46.035 --> 00:18:46.672\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n\n317\n00:18:46.672 --> 00:18:47.581\n&gt;&gt; To support set assumptions.\n\n318\n00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:49.886\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; Not just, I feel,\n\n319\n00:18:49.886 --> 00:18:52.287\nthat it's more performant.\n\n320\n00:18:52.287 --> 00:18:56.588\nIf I hear the words, I feel,\nwhen someone's providing me a, I go,\n\n321\n00:18:56.588 --> 00:18:57.426\nthis is bad.\n\n322\n00:18:57.426 --> 00:18:58.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n323\n00:18:58.344 --> 00:18:59.389\n&gt;&gt; This is real bad.\n\n324\n00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:06.760\n&gt;&gt; No, gut feelings, which I know I've\nheard people say things like that.\n\n325\n00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.480\nWell, I feel that, based on what?\n\n326\n00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.380\nShow me, show me the evidence,\n\n327\n00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:16.370\nshow me that this is how this\norganization traditionally performs.\n\n328\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:20.650\nShow me that this is\nwhat happens in the past.\n\n329\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.980\nShow me that this is how other\nsuppliers have conducted this.\n\n330\n00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.730\nShow me that this is how\nother customers have reacted.\n\n331\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:32.882\nI want to see some form of evidence.\n\n332\n00:19:32.882 --> 00:19:37.071\nI want to see that an assumption\nis not just based on, so\n\n333\n00:19:37.071 --> 00:19:40.088\nwhich way the winds blowing right now.\n\n334\n00:19:40.088 --> 00:19:43.771\n&gt;&gt; They're outside throwing grass up\nin the air going, that's to the left.\n\n335\n00:19:43.771 --> 00:19:44.850\nWe're going over there.\n\n336\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.419\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n337\n00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:49.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I use more performer but\nI I've heard,\n\n338\n00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:53.139\nit's easier this way or\nit's, I don't know.\n\n339\n00:19:53.139 --> 00:19:56.097\nThis always tend to be very nebulous\nwhen people when people tell me.\n\n340\n00:19:56.097 --> 00:20:00.337\nThey're like, it's just this thing and\nthey had an adjective.\n\n341\n00:20:00.337 --> 00:20:06.885\nAnd I go, how do you know that and\nthen it's usually, I feel.\n\n342\n00:20:06.885 --> 00:20:08.521\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n343\n00:20:08.521 --> 00:20:13.471\n&gt;&gt; I feel like you're wrong, is what I\n\n344\n00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:18.820\nfeel like [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, I want to see evidence.\n\n345\n00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:24.940\nI don't want to see you sitting around\nscratching your head in a meeting or\n\n346\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:30.080\nwhatever without any evidence to\nsupport the decisions that you've made.\n\n347\n00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.520\nIf there's been a decision made,\nyou've got to have a reason for\n\n348\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.710\nmaking that decision.\n\n349\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:40.550\nEven if the reason is,\nwell I was in another organization and\n\n350\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.220\nit happened like this and\nthis is what happened.\n\n351\n00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:48.250\nOkay, but still show me,\nshow me exactly what happened.\n\n352\n00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.990\nYou cannot make decisions at this\ncritical point in the project,\n\n353\n00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.090\nyou cannot make decisions based on I feel.\n\n354\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.562\nThe objectives of\nthe starting up a project,\n\n355\n00:21:00.562 --> 00:21:04.180\nthis is a foundation to\nstarting up a project.\n\n356\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:10.230\nIf we get this wrong, then the whole\nproject is gonna go horribly wrong.\n\n357\n00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:14.270\nSo, it's really important\nthat everything that we do in\n\n358\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.564\nthis particular point\nis documented as well.\n\n359\n00:21:17.564 --> 00:21:21.764\nAnd so we document any evidence\nthat we base in our assumptions on,\n\n360\n00:21:21.764 --> 00:21:25.510\nthat we document who our\nauthorities are for instance.\n\n361\n00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.831\nThat we document the business\njustification in that business case.\n\n362\n00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:35.584\nThat we document the scope and we document\nthe reasons why we have the scope.\n\n363\n00:21:35.584 --> 00:21:40.392\nWe document the reasons why we have the\ntimeline, we document the reasons why we\n\n364\n00:21:40.392 --> 00:21:46.030\nhave this budget, and obviously we plan\nfor how we're going to spend the budget.\n\n365\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:50.037\nWe document our roles and\nresponsibilities,\n\n366\n00:21:50.037 --> 00:21:53.538\nwe have stakeholder and RACI matrices.\n\n367\n00:21:53.538 --> 00:21:58.579\nWe evaluate the way that\nthe project is going to work.\n\n368\n00:21:58.579 --> 00:22:02.093\nI talked to you about,\nwe're bringing in an iPad, well,\n\n369\n00:22:02.093 --> 00:22:05.780\nthe 75 inch iPad,\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n370\n00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.210\nAnd I said to you right,\nwhat sort of project would you use,\n\n371\n00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.800\nwhat sort of approach would you use?\n\n372\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.420\nWould you use an Agile based approach, or\nwould you use a Waterfall based approach?\n\n373\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:22.284\nAnd you said to me that, well, actually\nWaterfall approaches are lengthier.\n\n374\n00:22:22.284 --> 00:22:24.699\nAnd so my question is, what makes you say?\n\n375\n00:22:24.699 --> 00:22:26.164\nWhy do you think that?\n\n376\n00:22:26.164 --> 00:22:28.100\nWhat makes you say that?\n\n377\n00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.120\nAnd then you answered me\nwith the question, well,\n\n378\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.170\nbecause in previous experienced\nI've failed and it has always been.\n\n379\n00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.310\nWell, that's because maybe it\nwasn't particularly efficient.\n\n380\n00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.790\nBut what I'm gonna say to you is,\n\n381\n00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:45.460\nshow me the evidence of where the Agile\napproach is better because it's shorter.\n\n382\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.030\nIt shouldn't be shorter.\n\n383\n00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.948\nSo, we have to be careful of making\nassumptions just because something\n\n384\n00:22:52.948 --> 00:22:57.613\nworked well in one particular environment,\nor at one particular time,\n\n385\n00:22:57.613 --> 00:23:02.288\ndoesn't mean that that's the approach\nthat you should take this time.\n\n386\n00:23:02.288 --> 00:23:09.621\nYou have to have the evidence\nnot as you say just I feel.\n\n387\n00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:13.873\nSo, what we are gonna do now that\nwe've looked at what we need to\n\n388\n00:23:13.873 --> 00:23:18.152\nhave in place for starting up a project,\nwhat objectives are?\n\n389\n00:23:18.152 --> 00:23:20.428\nWhat our end goal is?\n\n390\n00:23:20.428 --> 00:23:25.000\nWhen we come back in our next episode,\nwe're gonna take a look at the actual\n\n391\n00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.600\nactivities that we are going to undertake\nas part of starting up a project.\n\n392\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.649\nSo, I'm gonna invite you to come back for\na part two of this particular process.\n\n393\n00:23:35.649 --> 00:23:38.629\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what Jo,\nwho knew that there was so many in's and\n\n394\n00:23:38.629 --> 00:23:41.570\nout's considerations and\njust getting something started?\n\n395\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.119\nBut looks like we're\ngonna have a part two, so\n\n396\n00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:44.522\nyou'll definitely want to come on back.\n\n397\n00:23:44.522 --> 00:23:46.622\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n398\n00:23:46.622 --> 00:23:49.485\nSo signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n399\n00:23:49.485 --> 00:23:50.301\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n400\n00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:51.892\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n401\n00:23:51.892 --> 00:23:58.002\n[MUSIC]\n\n402\n00:23:58.002 -->

00:00:08.658\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:11.816\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:15.788\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:16.885\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n7\n00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:19.746\nAnd boy, you better buckle up\nbecause we have a treat for you.\n\n8\n00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:22.610\nThat's right,\nmore Prince2 2017 Foundation.\n\n9\n00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.645\nAnd in this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:26.758\nwe're gonna be talking about\nthe directing a project process.\n\n11\n00:00:26.758 --> 00:00:30.534\nAnd well, here to help us along is,\nwell, none other than Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:31.296\nHow are you doing, Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:32.225\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, great.\n\n14\n00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:32.844\nThank you, Justin.\n\n15\n00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:33.449\nHow are you?\n\n16\n00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.857\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and\nat the previous episode, I admitted,\n\n17\n00:00:37.857 --> 00:00:42.531\nthere's a lot more to these\nprocesses than I originally thought.\n\n18\n00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:45.179\nSo I'm kind of interested to see how well,\ndirecting a project.\n\n19\n00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.121\nIt seems simple in my mind, but I don't\nif it's necessarily as simple as far as\n\n20\n00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.538\nconsiderations are all\nwe actually have to do.\n\n21\n00:00:51.538 --> 00:00:56.054\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think to be honest though\nthere's a lot more to just manging\n\n22\n00:00:56.054 --> 00:00:59.077\nthe project than most\npeople are exposed to.\n\n23\n00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:03.463\nWell, for most poeple, certainly I mean\nyour experience has been as a developer,\n\n24\n00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:07.099\nand so for most developers,\nyou get involved with your activities,\n\n25\n00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.372\nyou get involved with your pieces of work.\n\n26\n00:01:09.372 --> 00:01:14.225\nBut there's a lot of work, there's\na lot of organization that has to go on\n\n27\n00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.372\nin the background in order\nto make that happen.\n\n28\n00:01:17.372 --> 00:01:20.396\nWe've got to make sure, and we've\ntalked about it in previous episodes,\n\n29\n00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:22.508\nwe've talked about\nthe importance of processes and\n\n30\n00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:24.580\nwe've talked about\nthe importance of structure.\n\n31\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.235\nAnd the importance of\nhaving some consistency,\n\n32\n00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:29.642\notherwise, we've simple just got chaos.\n\n33\n00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:33.136\nWe've got people doing\nwhat they want to do and\n\n34\n00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:39.049\njust imagine how that is in terms of\ndelivering quality to the organization and\n\n35\n00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.378\ndelivering output to the customer as well.\n\n36\n00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:47.335\nSo right now, what we're doing is we're\ngonna take a look at the process of\n\n37\n00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:48.842\ndirecting a project.\n\n38\n00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:54.306\nAnd this is not managing a project,\nthis is directing a project.\n\n39\n00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:58.704\nCuz if you take a look at the purpose\nthat we have on the slides, so\n\n40\n00:01:58.704 --> 00:02:02.368\nthe idea the purpose of\ndirecting a project process,\n\n41\n00:02:02.368 --> 00:02:04.986\nthere's a lot of ps in there, right?\n\n42\n00:02:04.986 --> 00:02:08.075\nThe purpose of that is to well,\nit's at executive level.\n\n43\n00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:14.081\nRemember that executive branch, the\nbranch, the level that make the decisions.\n\n44\n00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:18.227\nAnd this process is above\nall of the other processes,\n\n45\n00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:21.186\nbecause this sits above the project.\n\n46\n00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:26.300\nSo this is well direct in the project,\nnot managing it, but direct in it.\n\n47\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.393\nAnd the purposes to\nenable then these people,\n\n48\n00:02:29.393 --> 00:02:35.203\nthe executives to be accountable for the\nproject's success by making key decisions.\n\n49\n00:02:35.203 --> 00:02:37.572\nSo they have overall control, but\n\n50\n00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:41.832\nthey don't actually manage\nthe project on a day to day basis.\n\n51\n00:02:41.832 --> 00:02:46.542\nAnd I want to draw your attention to that\nsimply because when you initially look at\n\n52\n00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:49.865\nthese processes, you look at them and\nyou think, well,\n\n53\n00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:52.120\nwhy is the direct in a process?\n\n54\n00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.530\nWhy is that happening?\n\n55\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.420\nWhy are we talking about this after we\nstarted talking about this starting up\n\n56\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.037\na process?\n\n57\n00:02:58.037 --> 00:02:59.588\nWell, because this is\nat a different level.\n\n58\n00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:04.810\nSo this encompasses the entire project\nbecause this is at that executive level.\n\n59\n00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.323\nIt's at the project board level, and so\n\n60\n00:03:08.323 --> 00:03:13.915\nthe project board take accountability for\nthe entire project.\n\n61\n00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:17.629\nOkay, and they take accountability for\nensuring that it happened.\n\n62\n00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.934\nThe project manager, on the other hand.\n\n63\n00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:27.029\nWell, his accountabilities for\nthe day to day management of the project.\n\n64\n00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:29.119\nAnd the project board is not,\n\n65\n00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:33.388\nwell I wouldn't normally expect\nthis to be a full time role.\n\n66\n00:03:33.388 --> 00:03:38.417\nI would expect the project board\nto be involved in other things,\n\n67\n00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:42.895\nI'd expect them to be performing\ntheir day to day tasks.\n\n68\n00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:47.212\nBut never the less they still\nhave tasks associated with and\n\n69\n00:03:47.212 --> 00:03:50.318\ndecisions to make and meetings to attend,\n\n70\n00:03:50.318 --> 00:03:55.770\nassociated with directing the project\nthat they're managing right now.\n\n71\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.623\nSo I wouldn't be surprised if\nthe project board or the executives on\n\n72\n00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:05.659\nthe project board were also on\nthe project boards for other projects.\n\n73\n00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.517\nHowever, you've gotta be incredibly\ncareful when it comes to\n\n74\n00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:12.452\nconflict of interests.\n\n75\n00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:15.666\nBecause if we do have any\nconflict of interest, and\n\n76\n00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:18.069\nthey sit on multiple project boards.\n\n77\n00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.695\nAnd perhaps, we want the same\nresources and the same people for\n\n78\n00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:26.716\ntwo projects,\nthen who's gonna make that decision?\n\n79\n00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:29.514\nWell that's going to\noccur at a higher level,\n\n80\n00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:32.545\nit's going to occur at\nportfolio program level.\n\n81\n00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:36.517\nIt's not necessarily going to occur\nat individual project level, but\n\n82\n00:04:36.517 --> 00:04:40.886\nwe've got to be incredibly careful when\nwe're selecting our project board to\n\n83\n00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:43.884\nensure that there are no\nconflict of interest there.\n\n84\n00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:48.757\nAnd the priorities are already set\nbefore we've started out on this\n\n85\n00:04:48.757 --> 00:04:50.394\nparticular project.\n\n86\n00:04:50.394 --> 00:04:53.886\nSo what they actually do,\nif we take a look at the objectives,\n\n87\n00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:58.801\nyou'll see that they cover they activities\nthat's required at the executive level.\n\n88\n00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:04.300\nIncluding giving authority to\ninitiate the projects and giving\n\n89\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.232\nauthority to deliver the products that\nare going to be developed by the project.\n\n90\n00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:15.575\nThey take the responsibility\nof the management decision\n\n91\n00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:19.562\nmaking in that controls in\nthat sort of delegation.\n\n92\n00:05:19.562 --> 00:05:24.025\nAnd they ensure, well,\nthe word ensure would suggest that\n\n93\n00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:28.943\nthey're going to do something\nabout making the project viable.\n\n94\n00:05:28.943 --> 00:05:33.703\nBut I mean, the reality of the situation\nis that they ensure they are responsible\n\n95\n00:05:33.703 --> 00:05:35.250\nfor the decision making.\n\n96\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.883\nSo they're the ones that will come\nto the project manager to say,\n\n97\n00:05:38.883 --> 00:05:41.674\nwe're going a little bit\noff track on the budget.\n\n98\n00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:45.024\nAnd we need to make sure that\nthis project is still viable and\n\n99\n00:05:45.024 --> 00:05:49.900\nwe need to make sure that it's still going\nto deliver a return on the investment.\n\n100\n00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.031\nAnd so therefore, our project manager\nwill be the person that's actually\n\n101\n00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:59.592\nperforming all of the activities\nto get any project back on track,\n\n102\n00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:03.599\nif we've gone under budget or\nmaybe we go in another time.\n\n103\n00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.936\nI really like the fact that it\nrefers to the project board for\n\n104\n00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:12.719\nthis directing of project,\nthis process as being an interface.\n\n105\n00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.817\nIt's kind of a translation\nto the corporate,\n\n106\n00:06:15.817 --> 00:06:19.081\nthe program management\nwith the organization.\n\n107\n00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:23.216\nSo you've got an additional buffer\nin there for the project manager,\n\n108\n00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.030\nso he's not talking\ndirectly to the customer.\n\n109\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.404\nWhy wouldn't you want the project manager\nliaising directly with the customer?\n\n110\n00:06:33.404 --> 00:06:35.434\nJustin is just greening\n[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:06:35.434 --> 00:06:36.824\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So some reason,\n\n112\n00:06:36.824 --> 00:06:41.810\nI feel like this, I have seen this only\npossible conflict to kind of opposition.\n\n113\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.719\nBut also I've seen where customers\nsway the direction of a project\n\n114\n00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:51.016\nwithout any further kind of\nthought process involved, or\n\n115\n00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:55.990\nconsiderations about well this\nis what the customer wants.\n\n116\n00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.339\nIs it really what the customer wants or\nare they just spouting off, or\n\n117\n00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.084\ndo they really know what they want?\n\n118\n00:07:01.084 --> 00:07:04.728\nIt just seems that they may have undo\ninfluence that's the kind of thing\n\n119\n00:07:04.728 --> 00:07:05.404\nI've seen.\n\n120\n00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:09.839\n&gt;&gt; Well bare in mind that the customer is\nnot necessarily in control of the purse\n\n121\n00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:10.474\nstrings.\n\n122\n00:07:10.474 --> 00:07:14.583\nThe customer was we talk about corperate\nbeing in control of the purse strings.\n\n123\n00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:19.050\nIt depends on what level of the customer,\nthe project manager is talking to.\n\n124\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.051\nAnd is it really the role of the project\nmanager to make the decisions\n\n125\n00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:30.121\non what functionality and what features\nshould be included and what shouldn't.\n\n126\n00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:34.278\nThe customer will be coming to the project\nmanager potentially with a big\n\n127\n00:07:34.278 --> 00:07:37.493\nlong list of requirements and\nthis is what I want to see.\n\n128\n00:07:37.493 --> 00:07:39.966\nAnd if it's left out to\nthe project manager,\n\n129\n00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:44.669\nwe could have a long list of functionality\nincluded that's not necessarily needed.\n\n130\n00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:47.933\nOr maybe we don't have the right\nfunctionality because the project manager\n\n131\n00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:51.250\nsimply says, well you know what,\nI don't think that that's necessary.\n\n132\n00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:56.806\nSo there has to be somebody that's sitting\nin between, that's making the decision.\n\n133\n00:07:56.806 --> 00:08:01.027\nIt's looking right across the board and\nsaying, okay Well I understand, Mr.\n\n134\n00:08:01.027 --> 00:08:05.520\nCustomer, that this is what you want,\nbut we've got another five projects.\n\n135\n00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.480\nAnd we're putting funding into these\nparticular projects as well and\n\n136\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.210\nthese are our priorities.\n\n137\n00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.566\nSo this is why we're not gonna discourage\nthis relationship between a project\n\n138\n00:08:15.566 --> 00:08:18.074\nmanager and customer, don't get me wrong.\n\n139\n00:08:18.074 --> 00:08:24.202\nBecause for certain things, we need to\nbe able to go back to the customer and\n\n140\n00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:29.555\nask him to get involved and\nbeta testing and ask him to get involved\n\n141\n00:08:29.555 --> 00:08:36.108\nin ensuring that the product is exactly\nwhat they want and defining our output.\n\n142\n00:08:36.108 --> 00:08:40.521\nBut, at the same time, we don't want the\ncustomer necessarily making the decisions\n\n143\n00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:41.940\nwith the project manager.\n\n144\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.720\nThis is how we end up with scope creep and\n\n145\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.040\nthis is how we end up with\nprojects that go over budget.\n\n146\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:53.260\nSo the direction then this project\nboard also gives us the authority to\n\n147\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.940\nclose the project and\nthey also are accountable for\n\n148\n00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.140\nensuring that well,\nwe realized the post project benefits.\n\n149\n00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.590\nSo that we are able to\n\n150\n00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.910\narticulate that benefits have been\nachieved at the end of the project.\n\n151\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.290\nThe next slide.\n\n152\n00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.665\nIt's in purple which means-\n&gt;&gt; It comes from our Prince Two book.\n\n153\n00:09:17.665 --> 00:09:20.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Look at that this,\nhe's learning, right?\n\n154\n00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.390\nIt's comes from prince two books.\n\n155\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.120\nSo it's in purple.\n\n156\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.092\nDo you remember the key?\n\n157\n00:09:26.092 --> 00:09:26.711\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n158\n00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:29.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you give me just a second here I\n\n159\n00:09:29.771 --> 00:09:32.841\nthink that was on page 163\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n160\n00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:34.913\n&gt;&gt; Hold on a sec I'll get it,\n\n161\n00:09:34.913 --> 00:09:37.585\nwe're almost there, there it is\n\n162\n00:09:37.585 --> 00:09:38.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n163\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:39.810\n&gt;&gt; Justin found the page.\n\n164\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.445\n&gt;&gt; Yep so that's on page 163\nof your Prince Two book.\n\n165\n00:09:43.445 --> 00:09:46.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So square is a process,\n\n166\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.020\nlight purple square is an activity.\n\n167\n00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n168\n00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:56.010\n&gt;&gt; And then the circular ones says\nthis is an exception plan request.\n\n169\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:56.640\n&gt;&gt; No it doesn't.\n\n170\n00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.660\nIt doesn't.\n\n171\n00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.586\nThe circular ones it says\nit's an evental decision.\n\n172\n00:10:03.586 --> 00:10:05.955\n&gt;&gt; But it says right here, I gotta read,\n\n173\n00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:09.247\nsorry it's important to read\nyour key appropriately.\n\n174\n00:10:09.247 --> 00:10:12.009\nIs it event or\na decision which I guess an exception plan\n\n175\n00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:14.630\nrequest would be an event-\n&gt;&gt; It's probably because it's written\n\n176\n00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.000\nin English that's probably-\n&gt;&gt; Hold on there Jo,\n\n177\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.730\nare we really going down this road?\n\n178\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Again.\n\n179\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:19.938\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n\n180\n00:10:19.938 --> 00:10:20.570\n&gt;&gt; For the 17th time.\n\n181\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.315\n&gt;&gt; I remembered the page number,\nyou should be proud of me.\n\n182\n00:10:23.315 --> 00:10:24.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was proud of you.\n\n183\n00:10:24.795 --> 00:10:26.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n184\n00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.908\nlet's take a look at our activities\nthen and as Justin has said,\n\n185\n00:10:29.908 --> 00:10:33.990\nthe activities are the ones that\nare in the pale purple square.\n\n186\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.077\nSo let's put this into some context here.\n\n187\n00:10:36.077 --> 00:10:41.269\nI know that this is a large and\nit looks like a very complex diagram,\n\n188\n00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:45.442\nand I've already told you\nwhen it comes to your test,\n\n189\n00:10:45.442 --> 00:10:50.103\nyou are not expected to remember\nthis particular diagram.\n\n190\n00:10:50.103 --> 00:10:53.740\nNobody is gonna give you a diagram and\nsay, hey look can you fill in the blanks?\n\n191\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.810\nIf you're looking for\nthis actually on a page,\n\n192\n00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.790\nit's under the directing\na project chapter there, Justin.\n\n193\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.250\nIt will be there somewhere.\n\n194\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.100\nJustin's thumb is through the book now.\n\n195\n00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.742\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot, there it is.\n\n196\n00:11:05.742 --> 00:11:09.292\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; There you go, it's on page 181.\n\n197\n00:11:09.292 --> 00:11:14.830\n[LAUGH] Okay so the diagram itself then,\nwhat I'm really, really interested in,\n\n198\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:19.220\nand the reason why I sort\nof make fun of Justin, but\n\n199\n00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.930\nthe reason why I like Justin to take\na look at the key is just to remind us\n\n200\n00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.100\nthat the shapes are really\nimportant in these diagrams.\n\n201\n00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.850\nSo the pale purple boxes, squares,\nrectangles, if you wanna call them that.\n\n202\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.950\nThey sit in directing a project,\nand they are activities.\n\n203\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:43.540\nUnderneath those, then what you have\nare the decisions that need to be made.\n\n204\n00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.410\nAnd these decisions are, well,\n\n205\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.640\nthese are the ones that are related\nto specific activities.\n\n206\n00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.910\nBut right along the very bottom\nof this particular diagram,\n\n207\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.150\nyou have the processes themselves\nsuch as starting up a project,\n\n208\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:01.270\ninitiating a project, managing a boundary\nand control in a stage, and then\n\n209\n00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.230\nwe've also got closing a project there\nas well in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n210\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.210\nBut you'll see the decisions\nalong the top.\n\n211\n00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.060\nAnd I know that even on full screen,\n\n212\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.330\nthis is probably still gonna\nbe a very small font for you.\n\n213\n00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.350\nSo don't forget, this is available\nin your downloadable material, but\n\n214\n00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.170\nit's on page 181 of the Prince Two book.\n\n215\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:28.130\nAnd along the top there, you've got your\ndecisions, and so those decisions well,\n\n216\n00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.340\nthe decisions are what,\nthey're outcomes of particular activities.\n\n217\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.850\nSo if we take a look, we're gonna start\noff, we're gonna follow this timeline.\n\n218\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.950\nYou start off in the bottom\nleft hand corner and\n\n219\n00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:47.950\nwe start off and if we can get this\nonto just full screen there, please,\n\n220\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.920\nthen yeah, I know that it's\nquite a small font for you.\n\n221\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.600\nBut let's try and\ngo through this chronologically.\n\n222\n00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.540\nWe start off with starting up the project.\n\n223\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.170\nAnd then we have a request\nto initiate a project.\n\n224\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.350\nAnd look who it is that\nauthorizes that initiation.\n\n225\n00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.930\nIt's the project board in\nthat directing a project.\n\n226\n00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.730\nAnd they actually initiate and\nthey notify everybody.\n\n227\n00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.450\nThat's right at the very top there.\n\n228\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.360\nThat's the decision.\n\n229\n00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.220\nAnd then once notification has gone out,\nthen you've got the authority.\n\n230\n00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.150\nWe start the project up and we'll be\nlooking at that in another episode,\n\n231\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.430\nthe initiating a project.\n\n232\n00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:32.270\nAnd then we request to deliver a project.\n\n233\n00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.660\nSo that's where we've got\nall of our plans done and\n\n234\n00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.970\nwe've got all of our people in place and\nnow we say, okay can we go ahead?\n\n235\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.590\nAnd look at this, the project board\nagain are authorizing the project.\n\n236\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.000\nAnd then, sort of around the bottom,\nin the middle there,\n\n237\n00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.850\nwhat you've got is you've got control in\na stage and managing a stage boundary.\n\n238\n00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:57.650\nAnd all of these, well,\nthese happen in a circular manner.\n\n239\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:04.860\nBecause we have an authority to proceed,\nthen we manage or control the stage.\n\n240\n00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.510\nIn other words,\nwhat we're actually developing and\n\n241\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:12.000\nthen at the end of the stage, we manage\nthe stage boundary which means that we\n\n242\n00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.400\nsay, okay, did that particular\nstage of the project go well?\n\n243\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.940\nWhat lessons can we learn from that?\n\n244\n00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.910\nDo we have another stage left?\n\n245\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.630\nYes we do.\n\n246\n00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.690\nOkay, then we'll move\non to the next stage.\n\n247\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:30.280\nAnd of course, every time that happens,\nthen the project board\n\n248\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.820\nauthorize the procedure\non to the next stage,\n\n249\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:41.400\nand they give in as well, ad hoc direction\nfor any ad hoc decisions that may be made.\n\n250\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.680\nUntil eventually, we'll get into our final\nstage and once we've got into our final\n\n251\n00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.680\nstage, then they authorize\nmovement to the closing a project.\n\n252\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.205\nAnd that's when, you've got two options\nthere above that closing a project,\n\n253\n00:14:56.205 --> 00:14:56.720\nby the way.\n\n254\n00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.264\nWe've either got a premature close,\nand we looked at that in\n\n255\n00:15:00.264 --> 00:15:03.950\na previous episode where we said,\nsometimes a project needs to\n\n256\n00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:08.819\nbe closed prematurely because maybe things\naren't going in the right direction,\n\n257\n00:15:08.819 --> 00:15:12.601\nor maybe things have changed and\nthe organization has changed.\n\n258\n00:15:12.601 --> 00:15:17.631\nAnd we also l got then a regular close,\nwe've actually delivered the project.\n\n259\n00:15:17.631 --> 00:15:23.043\nAnd then again we go back to the board,\nthe project board to authorize\n\n260\n00:15:23.043 --> 00:15:28.176\nthat closure and then we send out\nthe notification to everybody,\n\n261\n00:15:28.176 --> 00:15:34.460\nall of our stakeholders to say, that\nproject is now considered to be complete.\n\n262\n00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.998\nI know that there's a lot of information\nthere and what I'm very very\n\n263\n00:15:40.998 --> 00:15:46.236\npainfully aware of is the fact that I\ndon't want you to remember all of that.\n\n264\n00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:52.026\nWhat you need to do is remember that\nevery single stage as we progress\n\n265\n00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:57.004\nthrough the project,\nthe movement to every stage has to be\n\n266\n00:15:57.004 --> 00:16:02.914\naccompanied by the relevant\nauthorization from the project board.\n\n267\n00:16:02.914 --> 00:16:07.744\nSo it's the project board,\nnot the project manager,\n\n268\n00:16:07.744 --> 00:16:11.839\nthe project manager manages the project,\nbut\n\n269\n00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:18.561\nit's the project board that then\nauthorize the movement to the next stage.\n\n270\n00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:22.461\nI wanna say something as\nwell along with this,\n\n271\n00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:26.662\nbecause the project board\nhas a responsibility.\n\n272\n00:16:26.662 --> 00:16:30.376\nBut one thing that I really want\nyou to be very careful of when\n\n273\n00:16:30.376 --> 00:16:33.347\nyou have a project board,\nis to ensure that that\n\n274\n00:16:33.347 --> 00:16:37.235\nproject board really understands\nwhat's expected of them.\n\n275\n00:16:37.235 --> 00:16:40.649\nI remember years ago and a long time ago,\n\n276\n00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:44.975\nlong before I'd started\nmoving into governance.\n\n277\n00:16:44.975 --> 00:16:46.684\nAnd long before that and\n\n278\n00:16:46.684 --> 00:16:51.552\nI had to be asked if I would be on\na project board and it was just the case\n\n279\n00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:56.270\nof they needed the support director\ninvolved in a project board.\n\n280\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.152\nAnd so, here you go here is a new project\nand this is when the meeting is and\n\n281\n00:17:01.152 --> 00:17:03.806\nby the way you are in the project board.\n\n282\n00:17:03.806 --> 00:17:07.901\nAnd not once did anybody explain\nto me what was required,\n\n283\n00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:12.606\nand so, I didn't understand what\na project board was there for.\n\n284\n00:17:12.606 --> 00:17:16.416\nI didn't understand what I was expected\nto do and in fact, in those days,\n\n285\n00:17:16.416 --> 00:17:20.810\nI just thought it was just another meeting\nthat I had to attend and that was it.\n\n286\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.770\nBut I spent most of the time at each of\nthese meetings that I was invited to,\n\n287\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.600\nwondering what on earth\nwas expected of me.\n\n288\n00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.021\nWas I supposed to just kinda sit there and\njust node and\n\n289\n00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:35.378\njust yeah okay then let's\nmove on to the next stage.\n\n290\n00:17:35.378 --> 00:17:38.236\nBut of course I have\ncontributed to the meetings but\n\n291\n00:17:38.236 --> 00:17:42.235\nI did not mainly understand the impact\nthat I would have on the project.\n\n292\n00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:46.940\nBecause I assumed that the project\nmanager made all the decisions.\n\n293\n00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.187\nI didn't realised that actually I had\na responsibility as being part of\n\n294\n00:17:51.187 --> 00:17:53.826\nthe project board to make those decisions.\n\n295\n00:17:53.826 --> 00:17:59.161\nAnd, I have noticed that in a lot\nof organisations that is still\n\n296\n00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:06.306\nthe case even today, that a lot of people\nwithin IT, no matter what there roles are,\n\n297\n00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:11.665\nare not necessarily engaged in\nproject management training.\n\n298\n00:18:11.665 --> 00:18:15.805\nAnd therefore, they're not really\naware of what is expected of them,\n\n299\n00:18:15.805 --> 00:18:18.634\nwhen they are brought into\na project to undertake\n\n300\n00:18:18.634 --> 00:18:22.490\ncertain activities including\nthat of the project board.\n\n301\n00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:28.134\nSo, one thing that I really wanted to add\nin there was when you are in the real\n\n302\n00:18:28.134 --> 00:18:33.886\nworld and this is kind of an addition to\nany exam advice that I wanna give you.\n\n303\n00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:37.600\nBut when you are in the real\nworld assign an executive for\n\n304\n00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.040\nthe project board you really need to\noutline what it is you expect of them.\n\n305\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.940\nEspecially if they've never been involved\nin any project management before,\n\n306\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.480\nit's not something that would\nnecessarily be intuitive.\n\n307\n00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:57.454\nSometimes we just assume that the project\nmanager is going to perform all of this.\n\n308\n00:18:57.454 --> 00:18:59.689\nYou see, what the project board does and\n\n309\n00:18:59.689 --> 00:19:04.140\nwhat happens at the executive\nlevel is all of the authorization.\n\n310\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.842\nSo that includes authorizing\nthe initiation of the project\n\n311\n00:19:08.842 --> 00:19:13.355\nthat's authorizing when\nthe project is going to start,\n\n312\n00:19:13.355 --> 00:19:19.185\nthat's authorizing that we can move\nas well onto our subsequent stages,\n\n313\n00:19:19.185 --> 00:19:24.843\nit's verifying that our business\ncase well is a viable business case.\n\n314\n00:19:24.843 --> 00:19:29.125\nIf you've got somebody that doesn't really\nunderstand what they're doing on a project\n\n315\n00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:32.733\nboard, then they're wondering why\nthey're reviewing a business case.\n\n316\n00:19:32.733 --> 00:19:36.964\nWe need to explain that to them,\nthey also take accountability for\n\n317\n00:19:36.964 --> 00:19:38.900\ncommunication as well.\n\n318\n00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.660\nNow as they may not necessarily take\nthe responsibility of performing\n\n319\n00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.140\nthe communication they\nauthorize the communication, so\n\n320\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.040\nthey take accountability.\n\n321\n00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:53.064\nAnd again, we wanna ensure that\nevery project has got a well-defined\n\n322\n00:19:53.064 --> 00:19:56.909\nstakeholder management chart and\na racy matrix too.\n\n323\n00:19:56.909 --> 00:20:01.145\nAnd then of course they authorize\nthe project as a whole,\n\n324\n00:20:01.145 --> 00:20:03.270\nand so the executive board.\n\n325\n00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:08.680\nThe project board takes an accountability\nfor authorizing the entire project,\n\n326\n00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.260\nincluding all of the project\ninitiation documentation.\n\n327\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.543\nThey review all of that, and\nthey approve that prior to release,\n\n328\n00:20:17.543 --> 00:20:21.783\nthey also review and\napprove all of the approaches.\n\n329\n00:20:21.783 --> 00:20:26.823\nRemember in the previous episodes\nwe defined all of our approaches\n\n330\n00:20:26.823 --> 00:20:31.600\nincluding the approach to risk management,\nthat was a theme.\n\n331\n00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.043\nIncluding the approach to planning,\n\n332\n00:20:34.043 --> 00:20:39.020\nincluding the approach to benefits\nmanagement and the approach to quality.\n\n333\n00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:44.341\nWell the project board take\naccountability for approving all of that,\n\n334\n00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:49.671\nand they also authorize the Project\nManager to then start the project.\n\n335\n00:20:49.671 --> 00:20:55.681\nAnd then again, as I have already\nmentioned, during each stage boundary.\n\n336\n00:20:55.681 --> 00:21:01.638\nIn other words, when we complete one\nstage, after we move onto the next,\n\n337\n00:21:01.638 --> 00:21:05.866\nthen the project board will\ntake responsibility for\n\n338\n00:21:05.866 --> 00:21:09.053\nmoving from that one stage to the next.\n\n339\n00:21:09.053 --> 00:21:12.846\nCuz they are the people, the group of\npeople that will sit there and say yes,\n\n340\n00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:16.225\nokay, everything's been completed for\nthis particular stage and\n\n341\n00:21:16.225 --> 00:21:17.959\nwe're good to move on to the next.\n\n342\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.434\nAnd then lastly, cuz we mention in\nthere as part of their activities,\n\n343\n00:21:23.434 --> 00:21:26.713\nwhich is ad hoc direction and\nad hoc decision making.\n\n344\n00:21:26.713 --> 00:21:32.366\nWhenever there's a decision that\nneeds to made a management decision\n\n345\n00:21:32.366 --> 00:21:37.442\nwithin the project itself,\nthen of course I expect the project\n\n346\n00:21:37.442 --> 00:21:43.212\nboard to be able to give direction and\nbe able to make decisions, okay.\n\n347\n00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:49.140\nSo before we allow them to\nauthorize the project closure,\n\n348\n00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.998\nwhich is our last slide in\nthis particular episode.\n\n349\n00:21:52.998 --> 00:21:56.541\nAnd in fact our last slide in this\nportion of the downloadable material,\n\n350\n00:21:56.541 --> 00:21:57.887\nI o have a question for you.\n\n351\n00:22:00.577 --> 00:22:03.114\nHow many people do you think\nshould be on a project board?\n\n352\n00:22:05.693 --> 00:22:08.944\n&gt;&gt; All right, you said think,\nso nothing I say is wrong.\n\n353\n00:22:08.944 --> 00:22:12.458\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna go.\n\n354\n00:22:14.641 --> 00:22:17.464\n&gt;&gt; Trust me,\nJustin everything you say is wrong.\n\n355\n00:22:17.464 --> 00:22:21.883\n&gt;&gt; All right, it sounds like a weird\nal song, but I'm gonna go with five.\n\n356\n00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:26.985\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there was no right or wrong,\nyou were right, yeah, you were right.\n\n357\n00:22:26.985 --> 00:22:27.630\n&gt;&gt; See, I wasn't wrong.\n\n358\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.463\n&gt;&gt; I know, but\nit was kind of a trick question.\n\n359\n00:22:29.463 --> 00:22:31.570\n&gt;&gt; You love those though.\n\n360\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:32.651\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I do, yeah.\n\n361\n00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:33.584\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n362\n00:22:33.584 --> 00:22:36.194\n&gt;&gt; I'll admit this, certainly when\nit comes to your practitioner test,\n\n363\n00:22:36.194 --> 00:22:38.118\nthis is something that you\nwanna be thinking about.\n\n364\n00:22:38.118 --> 00:22:40.828\nIs how many people do I\nneed on a project board?\n\n365\n00:22:40.828 --> 00:22:44.745\nWe've got a saying,\ntoo many cooks spoil the broth,\n\n366\n00:22:44.745 --> 00:22:47.104\nhave you got a saying like that?\n\n367\n00:22:47.104 --> 00:22:51.239\n&gt;&gt; We just say too many cooks in\nthe kitchen, it's one of the those things\n\n368\n00:22:51.239 --> 00:22:55.950\nwhere you just kinda like, you kinda end\nup with immobility and things go awry.\n\n369\n00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.418\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nyou don't want too many decision makers.\n\n370\n00:22:58.418 --> 00:23:02.759\nBecause, everybody's gonna have\nan opinion, and like you say,\n\n371\n00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:07.268\nyou've got too many decision makers and\neverything just goes awry.\n\n372\n00:23:07.268 --> 00:23:13.372\nBut you do need to have a sufficient\nnumber of people on your project\n\n373\n00:23:13.372 --> 00:23:19.377\nboard to enable an objective opinion and\nan objective decision.\n\n374\n00:23:19.377 --> 00:23:23.885\nRather than just an subjective decision,\nwhich is the opinion of one person.\n\n375\n00:23:23.885 --> 00:23:29.125\nSo there has to be a balance, and it has\nto be scaled to the size of the project,\n\n376\n00:23:29.125 --> 00:23:32.430\nso it has to be scaled appropriately.\n\n377\n00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.070\nI don't want, if it is a large project and\nit's gonna take two years to implement,\n\n378\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.160\nI don't expect two people\non the project board,\n\n379\n00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.730\nI'd expect quite a few more than that.\n\n380\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.737\nBut if it's a very small project,\nlike the project we were talking about in\n\n381\n00:23:45.737 --> 00:23:49.869\na previous episode, then Jo wants a 75\ninch iPad, then I expect the project\n\n382\n00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:53.456\nboard's gonna consist of about\nthree people, no more than that.\n\n383\n00:23:53.456 --> 00:23:58.753\nFor something that's going to be\nimplemented across every single studio.\n\n384\n00:23:58.753 --> 00:24:02.741\nSo, think about the scale\nof the project board.\n\n385\n00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:06.717\nAnd then, of course, the last thing that\nI mentioned was before we get to project\n\n386\n00:24:06.717 --> 00:24:08.950\nclosure, then think\nabout how many we need.\n\n387\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.100\nWell, that's something that we should\nthink about before we even start\n\n388\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.140\nthe project.\n\n389\n00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.250\nIs how many people we should\nhave on our project board.\n\n390\n00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:24.240\nProject closure is an activity that\nyour project board will undertake,\n\n391\n00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.520\nand it simply is decided that\nthe project has been closed.\n\n392\n00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:34.890\nNow as somebody who sort of specializes\nin governance and in methodologies,\n\n393\n00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:39.570\nthe one thing that I will tell you, and\nI'm very very passionate about this,\n\n394\n00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.307\nis that early life support.\n\n395\n00:24:41.307 --> 00:24:46.706\nIf you wanna call it sort of a DevOps\nmindset, but early life support,\n\n396\n00:24:46.706 --> 00:24:53.640\na proper period of transition has to be\ncompleted before we close the project.\n\n397\n00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:59.203\nIn other words, I don't want to hear the\nwords or the project team threw it over\n\n398\n00:24:59.203 --> 00:25:04.786\nthe fence to me, and I hear it constantly,\nI hear it every single week almost.\n\n399\n00:25:04.786 --> 00:25:08.447\nNow I'm told that project teams just\nthrown something over the fence to\n\n400\n00:25:08.447 --> 00:25:12.351\nthe support teams and the support teams\nare now trying to pick up the pieces,\n\n401\n00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:14.320\nand they're the words that they use.\n\n402\n00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.890\nWe have to have an appropriate\nlength of early life support.\n\n403\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:23.160\nTransition doesn't just mean,\nhere you go, Justin,\n\n404\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.780\nthis is yours, that's not a transition.\n\n405\n00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.290\nA transition is where I give something\nto Justin and I say, hey look,\n\n406\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.810\nlet's work with this together for\nthe next month.\n\n407\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:39.820\nAnd then once I'm confident that you\nunderstand it and you feel completely\n\n408\n00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.580\ncomfortable with that new service,\nthen I'm going to walk away.\n\n409\n00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:50.535\nBut I'm not going to just give you\nsomething and walk away, it's not a new\n\n410\n00:25:50.535 --> 00:25:55.317\ncellphone and that's something that\nwe really need to embrace better.\n\n411\n00:25:55.317 --> 00:26:00.289\nAnd need to get as a,\nI wasn't gonna say as an organization, but\n\n412\n00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:03.710\nas an industry we need\nto get better at this.\n\n413\n00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:09.828\nBecause the relationship that we have,\nand this is why I mentioned DevOps.\n\n414\n00:26:09.828 --> 00:26:14.312\nBecause the DevOps mindset is about\nexpanding the relationship that exists\n\n415\n00:26:14.312 --> 00:26:18.237\nbetween or doesn't exist sometimes\nbetween the project teams and\n\n416\n00:26:18.237 --> 00:26:21.090\ndevelopment teams and support teams.\n\n417\n00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.177\nThen we have to get\nbetter at our transition,\n\n418\n00:26:24.177 --> 00:26:29.390\nwe have to get better at handing the\nproject over into the live environment.\n\n419\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.856\nAnd this is why the project\nboard needs to be sure\n\n420\n00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:35.717\nthat the project is truly completed and\n\n421\n00:26:35.717 --> 00:26:41.540\nnot just been thrown over the fence before\nthey actually sign off that project.\n\n422\n00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:47.080\nBut that is the directing\na project process and\n\n423\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:52.766\nas we've already said, directing a project\nis high level, it's high level direction.\n\n424\n00:26:52.766 --> 00:26:58.109\nIn our next episode,\nwe're going to get into the actual\n\n425\n00:26:58.109 --> 00:27:02.439\nwork that we do as part\nof the project itself.\n\n426\n00:27:02.439 --> 00:27:08.150\nAnd so we're gonna be looking at that\nstart up initiation of the actual project.\n\n427\n00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:12.760\nSo now, we did a start up, we got our\nexecutive board in place and we've got out\n\n428\n00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.990\nproject manager assigned, and we did that\nin our starting up a project process.\n\n429\n00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:23.200\nAnd now we have ensured that in\nthis directing a project process,\n\n430\n00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.520\nwe have ensured that the project board\nknows what they're going to be doing.\n\n431\n00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.990\nSo now,\nwe're gonna go to the project manager, and\n\n432\n00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:35.280\nwe're gonna get the project manager\nto start and kick things off.\n\n433\n00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.598\nAnd that's gonna be in our next episode,\nso we're gonna invite you to come back and\n\n434\n00:27:39.598 --> 00:27:40.348\njoin us then.\n\n435\n00:27:40.348 --> 00:27:44.224\n&gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what Jo,\nI would definitely mess up starting up and\n\n436\n00:27:44.224 --> 00:27:47.360\ninitiating, and\nI think I have in previous episodes.\n\n437\n00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.660\nSo, be very careful those\nare distinct processes.\n\n438\n00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.688\nAnd, for some reason, while you were\ntalking about handing over the fence,\n\n439\n00:27:53.688 --> 00:27:56.030\nI'll leave you with that\nan interesting thought.\n\n440\n00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.150\nIndividual teams having\nthese catapults for\n\n441\n00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.310\nprojects that they just\nthrow over the fence.\n\n442\n00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.950\nThat's not what we wanna do, but\nthat's how it ended up in my mind.\n\n443\n00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.460\nDefinitely work together and well,\nspeaking of work together it\n\n444\n00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.300\nwould be wonderful if you would come on\nback and join us for our next episode.\n\n445\n00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.030\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n446\n00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.950\nSo signing off for ITPro.TV I've\nbeen your host Justin Dennison.\n\n447\n00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.860\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n448\n00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.116\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n449\n00:28:19.116 --> 00:28:25.538\n[MUSIC]\n\n450\n00:28:25.538 --> 00:28:29.473\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:04.580\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.607\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome back to\n\n5\n00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:14.640\nanother exciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.687\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\nback with more Prince 2-2017 foundation,\n\n7\n00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:23.700\nand in this episode, we're going to\nbe talking about controlling a stage.\n\n8\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.099\nThe process that is and well here to\nhelp us along is none other than Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.940\nJo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.980\nHow you doing today Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.530\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.270\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.520\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, trying to\nget things up and going today, and\n\n14\n00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.270\nwell sometimes I feel\na little out of control, but\n\n15\n00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.750\nhopefully thats not what we're\ngonna talk about today, right?\n\n16\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.520\nOnly sometimes.\n\n17\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.668\n&gt;&gt; Ahh\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:50.960\nYeah I suggest that you have control\nissues a little bit more than sometimes.\n\n19\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.020\nBut anyway.\n\n20\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.210\nYeah what we're doing is we're in our\nprints two project management of course,\n\n21\n00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.078\nand here what we're gonna\nbe talking about even.\n\n22\n00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:02.830\nI was gonna say discussing, or\nI was gonna say controlling, but\n\n23\n00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.110\nwe don't really want to go there.\n\n24\n00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.075\nWe're going to be discussing\ncontrolling a stage.\n\n25\n00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:11.072\nAll of these processes that\nwe've talked about so far,\n\n26\n00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:13.890\nthey all seem to be a bit of a mouthful,\ndon't they?\n\n27\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.085\nI know that, well Justin struggles,\nbut [INAUDIBLE].\n\n28\n00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:19.762\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:22.445\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, I have maintained\n\n30\n00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:24.940\na fairly good flow for most of them.\n\n31\n00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.130\nEvery once and a while I'm like I don't\nknow if I'm gonna be able to get this out.\n\n32\n00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.050\nBut I have been under\ncontrol in that capacity.\n\n33\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n34\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.580\nYeah, I'll give you that much.\n\n35\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.620\nSo, let me ask you a question, then.\n\n36\n00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.670\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n37\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.430\n&gt;&gt; What do you think a stage is?\n\n38\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.158\nWhen it comes to a project,\nwhat do you think a stage is?\n\n39\n00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:44.770\n&gt;&gt; A stage is.\n\n40\n00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.556\nMan, that's.\n\n41\n00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:47.043\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; So it's one of those things where\n\n42\n00:01:47.043 --> 00:01:50.016\nyou're like, okay, in your mind,\nokay conceputally I have an idea\n\n43\n00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:53.070\nof what I wanna say, but I'm having\na hard time putting it into words.\n\n44\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.283\nIt's a predefined set of, man you-\n\n45\n00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:00.970\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about a process, right?\n\n46\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.341\nYou're talking about\na predefined set of activities,\n\n47\n00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:08.290\nthat's a process,\nwe're imprints to processes, sure.\n\n48\n00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.240\nAnd we're looking at the process\nof controlling a stage.\n\n49\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.515\nBut a stage is not actually a process.\n\n50\n00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:18.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'll you what, I'm at a loss, Jo.\n\n51\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, so depending on whether\nyou're in a waterfall approach or\n\n52\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.440\nwhether you're in an agile approach\nOur project will be split into stages.\n\n53\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.080\nAnd stages are, and\nI know where Justin was going with this,\n\n54\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.230\ncuz Justin was talking\nabout sets of activities.\n\n55\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.890\nWhat he actually means is,\ngroups of activities.\n\n56\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.200\nYeah, does that sound a bit better?\n\n57\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.225\nJust say yes.\n\n58\n00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:41.153\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah that'll do.\n\n59\n00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:45.889\n&gt;&gt; That's one of those things where\nwe're cutting a line on terminology, but\n\n60\n00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.560\nwhat do you mean by groups as they're set.\n\n61\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.864\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so\nI'm gonna just whiz back for\n\n62\n00:02:51.864 --> 00:02:56.200\na moment in my slides if I can\nremember how to get back to them.\n\n63\n00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.420\nAnd I'm gonna whiz back to\nsomething that looked like a, wow,\n\n64\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.650\nthat was a long time ago,\nwhere we talked about a Gantt chart.\n\n65\n00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.359\nDo you Remember when we talked about that?\n\n66\n00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.100\n&gt;&gt; I do remember talking\nabout a Gantt Chart.\n\n67\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.324\nThey don't seem that difficult, but\napparently, there's some subtleties.\n\n68\n00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:14.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nhere is a picture of a Gantt chart.\n\n69\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.100\nIf we can put this up\non the full screen so\n\n70\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.880\nyou can see it, what I want to look at is,\nso if you take a look at the stages here.\n\n71\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.890\nAnd in stage one we've got\ntwo lots of activities, and\n\n72\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.180\nwe're grouping them together.\n\n73\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.081\nAnd remember a Gantt chart is a timeline,\nand then in stage two,\n\n74\n00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:38.650\nagain there's two lots of activities\nthat are happening at the same time.\n\n75\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.275\nIn stage three we've got three lots of\nactivities, so this is what we call,\n\n76\n00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:45.240\nyou'll see, the stages.\n\n77\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.370\nAnd this stage is all, well,\nwhat we might call groups of activities.\n\n78\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.170\nAnd so the purpose then of,\nif I can just find the right slide.\n\n79\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.780\nAnd the purpose of the control\nin a stage is this.\n\n80\n00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.080\nTo assign the work to be done.\n\n81\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.316\nI monitor it and deal with issues and then\nreport progress to the project board and\n\n82\n00:04:08.316 --> 00:04:13.322\ntake corrective actions to ensure that\nthe stage remains within tolerance.\n\n83\n00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:16.310\nThere are so\nmany things that we can pick apart there.\n\n84\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.970\nSo we've looked at the stage and\nthe stage contains groups of activities.\n\n85\n00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.420\nSo it's what is happening\nat that point in time.\n\n86\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.310\nWhat you saw there was a Gantt chart\nthat was looking at a specific waterfall\n\n87\n00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.730\napproach, but\nit could still apply to an agile approach.\n\n88\n00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.120\nAnd an agile approach is of\ncourse where we are releasing\n\n89\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.900\nin a continual basis,\nin an iterative basis.\n\n90\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.310\nSo as we develop one\nparticular functionality, and\n\n91\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.720\nmaybe we develop two or\nthree little pieces of functionality.\n\n92\n00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.030\nAnd then we release those together.\n\n93\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.170\nAnd we develop them in what we call\niterations in an agile environment.\n\n94\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.250\nBut in a PRINCE2 environment\nwe're gonna call them stages.\n\n95\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.862\nRemember what I said to you.\n\n96\n00:05:02.862 --> 00:05:05.830\nOkay, whatever's in the PRINCE2 book,\nthat's what you're gonna be tested on.\n\n97\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.850\nBut you are going to tailor\nthis to your environment.\n\n98\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.130\nAnd in tailoring this to your\nenvironment it's up to you to decide\n\n99\n00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.840\nwhat approach you want to use,\n\n100\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.780\nwhether you wanna use a traditional\nwaterfall approach or an agile approach.\n\n101\n00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.220\nAnd it's up to you to decide\non what terminology you use.\n\n102\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.610\nWhether you call it an iteration,\nwhether you call it a stage,\n\n103\n00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.390\nthat is completely up to you.\n\n104\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.970\nHowever, you're gonna be tested on\n\n105\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.680\nthe contents of this wonderful purple\nbook that I've been showing you.\n\n106\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.672\nAnd I say wonderful, and\nI'm not being sarcastic, just for once.\n\n107\n00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:45.717\nYou'll find that the PRINCE2 2017 book is,\nand I know I've said it in previous\n\n108\n00:05:45.717 --> 00:05:50.761\nepisodes, it's really well written, it's\nwritten in a way that it's in plain and\n\n109\n00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:54.975\nsimple English, so people like me\ncan understand, and even Justin.\n\n110\n00:05:54.975 --> 00:05:58.470\n[LAUGH] He's nodding.\n\n111\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.010\nSee he's read some of it actually.\n\n112\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.300\nHe's been really good,\nyou've seen on previous episodes.\n\n113\n00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.170\nHe's been really good at\nfinding the right pages.\n\n114\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.080\nThat's really important.\n\n115\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.540\nThis is not a plug and play methodology.\n\n116\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.150\nNone of our project management\nmethodologies are, however you should be\n\n117\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.850\nable to take this and you should be\nable to adapt it to your environment.\n\n118\n00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.140\nSo for your test, this particular\npurpose that you see in front of you\n\n119\n00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.230\nis something that you need\nto be able to identify.\n\n120\n00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.680\nIt is something that you need to remember.\n\n121\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.760\nIn the real world, what you need to\nremember is the, well it's the principle.\n\n122\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.010\nIt's the understanding of this purpose.\n\n123\n00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.780\nIt's about managing each stage.\n\n124\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.440\nThat's what controlling a stage is about.\n\n125\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.440\nSo, it's about assigning work.\n\n126\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.140\nIt's about monitoring the work, dealing\nwith any issues, changes, we know that.\n\n127\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.270\nReporting progress to the project board,\nand\n\n128\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.120\nthen taking any actions\nwhen something goes wrong.\n\n129\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.080\nSo it's about managing things\nthat are happening in the stage,\n\n130\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.080\npicking up the pieces if something goes\nwrong, dealing with any unusual requests,\n\n131\n00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.740\nor any additional requests, or\n\n132\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.640\nany what we might call scope creep, and\nreporting back to the project board.\n\n133\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.540\nSo who do you think does that?\n\n134\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.180\n&gt;&gt; Project manager?\n\n135\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah.\n\n136\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.950\nSo, the controlling stage,\nactually is an activity.\n\n137\n00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.200\nWell it's a, what do we call it?\n\n138\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.845\nProcess.\n\n139\n00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:28.000\n[LAUGH] It was on the tip\nof my tongue there.\n\n140\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.590\nIt's a process that is managed\nby the project manager.\n\n141\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.660\nCan he delegate?\n\n142\n00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.450\nI feel like this is not something\nthat you would want to delegate.\n\n143\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.130\nI could be wrong about that.\n\n144\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.010\nAnd based on the sideways glance there,\nI'm gonna go with I am wrong.\n\n145\n00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.378\nIt seems like the management and\nmaking sure things are just so\n\n146\n00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:52.414\nwould just be something that the project\nmanager would want to take on themselves.\n\n147\n00:07:52.414 --> 00:07:53.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n148\n00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.660\n&gt;&gt; But I guess parts of that could be\ndelegated to the team managers right?\n\n149\n00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.138\n&gt;&gt; Right, think how big a project is.\n\n150\n00:08:00.138 --> 00:08:05.851\nIf you're talking about an agile\nenvironment Or even a waterfall approach.\n\n151\n00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:08.257\nCertain activities might\nbe absolutely huge.\n\n152\n00:08:08.257 --> 00:08:13.144\nYou might have a set of ten developers\nworking on one particular activity, or\n\n153\n00:08:13.144 --> 00:08:16.250\none particular piece of functionality.\n\n154\n00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:21.598\nAnd if we've got five or six activities\nall happening at the same time,\n\n155\n00:08:21.598 --> 00:08:26.696\nthen is the project manager really\nin a place to be doing all of that?\n\n156\n00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:29.044\nThat seems like a lot of\nmicromanaging to me, and\n\n157\n00:08:29.044 --> 00:08:31.518\nwe don't like micromanaging inPrince2,\ndo we?\n\n158\n00:08:31.518 --> 00:08:32.679\n&gt;&gt; I don't like micromanaging in general.\n\n159\n00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n160\n00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:40.601\n&gt;&gt; But I've heard you say that we want to\nkind of be self-sufficient to some extent.\n\n161\n00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:43.799\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so\nthink about RACI, remember,\n\n162\n00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:47.998\nResponsible, Accountable,\nConsulted, and Informed.\n\n163\n00:08:47.998 --> 00:08:53.240\nAnd in our RACI, matrix, then yes,\nour project manager will be accountable.\n\n164\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.100\nBut a lot of the activities, and\na lot of the day-to-day management?\n\n165\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.100\nAnd don't forget, we manage by exception\nas well, so we don't micromanage, at all.\n\n166\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.330\nA lot of the day-to-day management\nwill be given to the team managers as\n\n167\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.800\na responsibility.\n\n168\n00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.830\nSo they'll be responsible, but of course,\nthe project manager will be accountable.\n\n169\n00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:18.592\nAnd that's something that I really want\nyou to take into your test, itself.\n\n170\n00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:23.118\nWhen it comes to the questions that\nyou're going to be asked in your test,\n\n171\n00:09:23.118 --> 00:09:27.720\nI want you to seriously think about\nwhat makes common sense as well.\n\n172\n00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.290\nAnd I know that, yeah, you need to take\nthat back into your live environment,\n\n173\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.070\nyour day-to-day work.\n\n174\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.580\nIf it doesn't make sense, then I have to\nask the question, why are we doing this?\n\n175\n00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.380\nAnd when we do assessments\nin organizations,\n\n176\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.990\nit's quite often the first\nquestion that I ask.\n\n177\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.130\nAnd I know that I've mentioned\nthis before in previous episodes,\n\n178\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.550\nit's the question of why,\nwhy are we doing this?\n\n179\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:54.010\nBecause if it doesn't make any sense, then\nwhat benefit are you getting out of it?\n\n180\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.531\nSo let's take a look at the activities,\nthen,\n\n181\n00:09:57.531 --> 00:10:00.972\nthat this particular\nprocess then controls.\n\n182\n00:10:00.972 --> 00:10:06.420\nWe wanna make sure that we are focused\non management of the product.\n\n183\n00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.877\nAnd that we're keeping issues,\nand we're keeping risks,\n\n184\n00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:14.710\nremember, issues are changes to the\nproject, we're keeping them under control.\n\n185\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.059\nThe last thing that you want to be,\nthat you want to do,\n\n186\n00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:22.936\nis to have a project where change is so\nfrequent,\n\n187\n00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:26.832\nthat you simply don't\nknow what you're doing.\n\n188\n00:10:26.832 --> 00:10:30.082\nYou've been in some bad projects before.\n\n189\n00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:35.375\n&gt;&gt; I have, I don't know, It's like running\nalong the edge of a roadway that's\n\n190\n00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:40.438\ncut around a mountain, and people\njust keep going, we should turn left.\n\n191\n00:10:40.438 --> 00:10:42.608\nAnd I'm like, but\nthat's over the mountain!\n\n192\n00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:45.699\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's bad, so I've been there, and\n\n193\n00:10:45.699 --> 00:10:50.658\npart of it is not only just bad decisions,\nbut it's misinformed, right?\n\n194\n00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:53.899\nIt's, well, I think this should,\nhow this will go, but\n\n195\n00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:57.419\nthere's no defined processes\nto maintain that consistency.\n\n196\n00:10:57.419 --> 00:11:01.085\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it mentions there that we\nwanna be aligned with the defined benefits\n\n197\n00:11:01.085 --> 00:11:02.188\nfor the organization.\n\n198\n00:11:02.188 --> 00:11:05.530\nAnd I know that we've mentioned\nword tolerances before.\n\n199\n00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.000\nAnd the fact in the matter is that,\nespecially now,\n\n200\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.600\nwe're in the 21st century,\nthings are going to change.\n\n201\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.640\nYes, we know that, I mean, you get\na new phone every six months, almost,\n\n202\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.270\nso we know that things\nare going to change.\n\n203\n00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.832\nBut nevertheless, we have to work\nwithin our defined tolerances,\n\n204\n00:11:21.832 --> 00:11:24.027\nwe have to set them at the very beginning.\n\n205\n00:11:24.027 --> 00:11:28.091\nBecause otherwise,\nthe project could be just never-ending,\n\n206\n00:11:28.091 --> 00:11:30.885\nwe could be subject to change continually.\n\n207\n00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:35.188\nAnd at that point in time, you have to\nask yourself, well, when is project ever\n\n208\n00:11:35.188 --> 00:11:38.890\ngoing to get completed,\nwhen is it ever going to finish?\n\n209\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.550\nSo you have to think about what the end\ngoal of your project is going to look\n\n210\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.330\nlike, and ensure that we remain\nwithin those tolerances.\n\n211\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.424\nAs it says, that last bullet point there,\n\n212\n00:11:50.424 --> 00:11:55.486\nthe project management team is focused\non delivery within the tolerances.\n\n213\n00:11:55.486 --> 00:12:02.408\nIf those tolerances could change,\nhow do you think we'd change them?\n\n214\n00:12:02.408 --> 00:12:06.165\n&gt;&gt; Request for change,\nwould that be part of change management?\n\n215\n00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:10.525\n&gt;&gt; It would be part of change management,\nyes, but who do you think would appove it?\n\n216\n00:12:10.525 --> 00:12:12.446\n&gt;&gt; I feel like that would\nbe an executive decision.\n\n217\n00:12:12.446 --> 00:12:15.191\n&gt;&gt; It's an executive decision, so\nit's down to the project board, yes,\n\n218\n00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:15.827\nyou're right.\n\n219\n00:12:15.827 --> 00:12:18.812\n&gt;&gt; Because those can have\nlarge kind of ramifications,\n\n220\n00:12:18.812 --> 00:12:21.209\nas far as what are acceptable tolerances?\n\n221\n00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.900\nWell, I guess it depends on who's\nthe customer in this capacity, but, right?\n\n222\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:32.041\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, and don't forget, we did\nsay that in one of our previous episodes,\n\n223\n00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:34.897\nwhen we talked about\nstarting up a project.\n\n224\n00:12:34.897 --> 00:12:39.806\nIn that if there is too much change,\nthen it may well be that the best decision\n\n225\n00:12:39.806 --> 00:12:45.100\nwould be to simply, well, close the\nproject, close the project prematurely.\n\n226\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.655\nAnd then restart another project,\nif the change is so\n\n227\n00:12:48.655 --> 00:12:53.641\ndiverse that it bears no resemblance\nto what we originally started out on.\n\n228\n00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:55.029\nSo on the next slide, and\n\n229\n00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:58.990\nI'd like to sort of blow that up\nto full screen if we possibly can.\n\n230\n00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.745\nBecause you can see that that is,\nit's quite a large,\n\n231\n00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:05.940\nwhat's the word I'm looking for, diagram.\n\n232\n00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.696\nAnd of course, it's in purple,\nso what does that mean, Justin?\n\n233\n00:13:08.696 --> 00:13:10.295\n&gt;&gt; That means it comes\nfrom our PRINCE2 book.\n\n234\n00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:15.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so\nthis is our Directing a Project diagram.\n\n235\n00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.220\nAnd you'll see that within the dotted\nline, and I've blown it up and\n\n236\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.780\nput it on the right-hand side there for\nyou, this is our Controlling a Stage.\n\n237\n00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:30.950\nControlling a Stage is going to\nbe tailored completely to your\n\n238\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:36.666\nindividual environment, and\nthat includes all of the activities.\n\n239\n00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:41.317\nSo what I like you to do is,\nI would like you just to take a moment\n\n240\n00:13:41.317 --> 00:13:45.804\njust to download your materials\nthat are available to you.\n\n241\n00:13:45.804 --> 00:13:50.278\nAnd I'd like you just to examine the\nactivities that are going to take place\n\n242\n00:13:50.278 --> 00:13:52.204\nwithin Controlling the Stage.\n\n243\n00:13:52.204 --> 00:13:57.420\nBut I want you just to examine\nthose with a view on tailoring.\n\n244\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.120\nAnd we're gonna talk about,\n\n245\n00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.860\nnow, just how we might consider\ntailoring some of these activities.\n\n246\n00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.750\nNow, those processes that you've got,\n\n247\n00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.580\nall those activities that you've\ngot within that dotted line.\n\n248\n00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.430\nAs I've said, now is your opportunity,\ngo away, and print this off, and\n\n249\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.620\ntake a look at them.\n\n250\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.903\nWe're not gonna go through them\nin too much detail right now.\n\n251\n00:14:16.903 --> 00:14:20.241\nI know that the font is probably\nvery small on your TV, or\n\n252\n00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:23.733\non your screen right now,\ntrust me, it is on mine as well.\n\n253\n00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:27.688\nSo what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna\npoint you to this, remember this?\n\n254\n00:14:27.688 --> 00:14:31.251\nYeah, this is your PRINCE2,\nyour purple PRINCE2 book,\n\n255\n00:14:31.251 --> 00:14:36.360\nand I'm gonna point you to page 217,\nyou'll see this particular diagram.\n\n256\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.696\nWhat you'll also see in subsequent\npages are all of these particular\n\n257\n00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:48.146\nactivities laid out in full, with tips for\nhow you might tailor those activities.\n\n258\n00:14:48.146 --> 00:14:53.099\nNow, when it comes to your test,\nin your test, we're not going to look\n\n259\n00:14:53.099 --> 00:14:57.082\nat these activities in, well,\nnot in any detail at all.\n\n260\n00:14:57.082 --> 00:14:59.554\nAnd there's a reason for that,\nwhy do you think that is?\n\n261\n00:14:59.554 --> 00:15:04.917\n&gt;&gt; Because they have to be\ntailored to any specific project.\n\n262\n00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:07.492\n&gt;&gt; Of anything, of any of the activities,\n\n263\n00:15:07.492 --> 00:15:12.115\nof any of the processes within PRINCE2,\nof project management, these\n\n264\n00:15:12.115 --> 00:15:16.911\nare the activities that are completely\ntailored to any specific project.\n\n265\n00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:22.370\nThese are activities that we simply\ncannot tell you what you need to do.\n\n266\n00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:27.036\nI mean, things like, what have we got\nhere, authorizing a work package,\n\n267\n00:15:27.036 --> 00:15:29.180\nreviewing the work package.\n\n268\n00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.510\nWell, this all makes sense,\n\n269\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.380\nyou've got to authorize work\nbefore you undertake any work.\n\n270\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:39.180\nAnd then you've got to review the status,\nas that work progresses.\n\n271\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.596\nBut how you'd review that status,\nwell, that's completely up to you.\n\n272\n00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:45.911\nWhether you choose to have\nsomething like a Kanban board, or\n\n273\n00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:48.058\nwhat we call an information radiator.\n\n274\n00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:51.488\nOr whether you choose to\nhave a daily stand-up,\n\n275\n00:15:51.488 --> 00:15:55.013\nwhere you talk about your\ncurrent work progress.\n\n276\n00:15:55.013 --> 00:15:57.828\nAnd that's completely up to you.\n\n277\n00:15:57.828 --> 00:16:02.680\nIt's got to be completely tailored, and\nthen things like capturing and assessing\n\n278\n00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.182\nissues, and then reviewing issues, and\ndeciding on what to do, and yes I'm\n\n279\n00:16:07.182 --> 00:16:12.640\nlooking at the book as well because what's\nin front of us is quite a small font.\n\n280\n00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:19.920\nAll of is again completely, completely\ntailored to your particular environment.\n\n281\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.300\nAnd then you've also got things\nlike reporting the highlights and\n\n282\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.370\nthen escalating any issues too.\n\n283\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.360\nAgain completely dependent\non your environment.\n\n284\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.010\nThese are all the sorts of things that\nI expect you to do when you are in\n\n285\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:37.600\na stage of a prints to project.\n\n286\n00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.390\nWhether this is what we call agile,\n\n287\n00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.040\nor whether this is what we call\na waterfall approach, it doesn't matter.\n\n288\n00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.880\nIt still needs to be manged and\ncontrolled.\n\n289\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.030\nBut of course what we're talking about is\nthe process of controlling that state,\n\n290\n00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.970\nwe're not actually talking\nabout doing the work.\n\n291\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.240\nBut because the work is very very\nspecific, and that's gonna be undertaken\n\n292\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.760\nby team members then of course then that\nmeans the controlling of those stages and\n\n293\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:08.030\nthe controlling of that\nparticular work is going to be\n\n294\n00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.360\nincredibly tailored to that\nparticular environment.\n\n295\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.440\nSo let me ask you a question then Justin,\nand\n\n296\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.570\nI know that you're gonna say to\nme that this is a trick question.\n\n297\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:18.840\nBut how many stages could we have?\n\n298\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.666\n&gt;&gt; As many as we possibly need.\n\n299\n00:17:20.666 --> 00:17:21.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n300\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:26.660\n&gt;&gt; To make the project come to fruition or\ndetermine that we gotta stop, this is it.\n\n301\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It does not have any viability.\n\n302\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't forget that\nbecause that could happen.\n\n303\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.920\nSometimes we do within a project.\n\n304\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.212\nWe will say, you know what and\n\n305\n00:17:35.212 --> 00:17:40.495\nI've already suggested it may be because\nof shifting goalposts, or scope group.\n\n306\n00:17:40.495 --> 00:17:42.955\nWe may say that project\nis on longer viable.\n\n307\n00:17:42.955 --> 00:17:48.925\nBut ultimately, it's up to the project\nmanager to decide how many stages we want.\n\n308\n00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:51.755\nIf it's a very large project and\nthere's a lot to deliver,\n\n309\n00:17:51.755 --> 00:17:56.685\nwe might have smaller stages, but\nthere is a lot of activity in each stage.\n\n310\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.420\nBut if it's a project that may go on for\nsome time, but\n\n311\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.290\nit's got less amount of activity\nin terms of less number of people.\n\n312\n00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.230\nIn other words,\nthe scale might be smaller.\n\n313\n00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.510\nThen we might decide\nto have longer stages.\n\n314\n00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.950\nIt's completely up to you.\n\n315\n00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.370\nIt depends on the scale.\n\n316\n00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.870\nIt depends on the urgency.\n\n317\n00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.310\nIt depends on the budget that you have.\n\n318\n00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.820\nThat really is up to you as to\nhow many stages that you have.\n\n319\n00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.760\nWhat we do know is, though,\nthat we do have to tailor this.\n\n320\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.850\nAnd so\njust on the slide in front of you there,\n\n321\n00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:35.960\nyou need to think about these particular\naspects when we are tailoring our stages,\n\n322\n00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.430\nsuch as the products that we have.\n\n323\n00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.170\nI like to call them tools, to be honest,\n\n324\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:45.242\ntools that we're using\nto manage our project.\n\n325\n00:18:45.242 --> 00:18:51.120\nI'm gonna ask you a question\njust because I can, really.\n\n326\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.070\nAnd because this is something that quite\noften we get wrong in the real world.\n\n327\n00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:01.950\nSo, do I tailor my project management\napproaches to suit a tool that I've got?\n\n328\n00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.770\nOr do I tailor the tool to suit\nmy project management approach?\n\n329\n00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.120\n&gt;&gt; That one's a difficult one.\n\n330\n00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.990\nI would say, I would tend to lean toward\ntailoring the tool toward my approach.\n\n331\n00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I don't want you to lean\nthat way, I want you to run that way very,\n\n332\n00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.970\nvery quickly.\n\n333\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:20.950\nWe do not.\n\n334\n00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:26.570\nWe do not tailor our approaches and\nprocesses to meet the needs of our tools.\n\n335\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.820\nOur tools should be tailored to\nmeet the needs of our processes.\n\n336\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.550\nAnd the first thing that we should do, and\nthis is one of the questions that we could\n\n337\n00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.820\nget asked is you tailor\nyour processes first,\n\n338\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.530\nto meet the needs of the organization,\nto meet the needs of the project.\n\n339\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.680\nAnd then you will source a tool, and\n\n340\n00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.420\nthen tailor that tool to meet\nthe needs of your processes.\n\n341\n00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.490\nYou never just go and buy something\noff the shelf and say, that'll do.\n\n342\n00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:57.530\nHang on a minute, I need to tweak the way\nI work in order to accommodate the tool.\n\n343\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.020\nOkay?\nThat's not something that we do.\n\n344\n00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.680\nSo we might have to tailor our product,\nas it says up there, or our tools.\n\n345\n00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.860\nBut we should never tailor our\nprocesses to suit our tools.\n\n346\n00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.700\nWe definitely will definitely have to\ntailor the roles and responsibilities,\n\n347\n00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.110\nbecause it really depends on\nwhat team of developers I need\n\n348\n00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.700\nas to who's going to be doing what.\n\n349\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.130\nAnd think about the scale,\nas I've already said, of the project,\n\n350\n00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.930\nbecause that will determine how we tailor.\n\n351\n00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:25.620\nAnd then, of course,\n\n352\n00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.370\nwe've also talked about the Agile\nenvironment versus the Waterfall approach.\n\n353\n00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.720\nNow, we mentioned supplier\nperspective here.\n\n354\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.310\nAnd in suppliers we talk about\ninternal and external suppliers.\n\n355\n00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:41.410\nAnd so this is not just the people\nthat we're going to bring in\n\n356\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.360\nfrom the outside to do\nsome of the work for us.\n\n357\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.840\nOur suppliers could also be internal.\n\n358\n00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.070\nThey will have advice.\n\n359\n00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.640\nThey will have guidance.\n\n360\n00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.420\nAnd remember,\nwe talk about lessons learnt quite a lot.\n\n361\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.880\nWell, yeah.\n\n362\n00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.640\nThey will have, hopefully,\na list of lessons learnt.\n\n363\n00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.750\nThey will have experience.\n\n364\n00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.480\nAnd so we expect them to bring their\nexperience into the project and\n\n365\n00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.350\nthat's what we are going to, and\n\n366\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:14.700\nthat's what we're going to use to\nhelp us to tailor our project.\n\n367\n00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.920\nAnd then of course think about what our\nprogram and what our portfolio is and\n\n368\n00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.300\nhow many projects we've\nactually got outstanding, and\n\n369\n00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.940\nthink about those resources too.\n\n370\n00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.170\nSome of the resources are shared.\n\n371\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.890\nAnd so we have to consider that when we\n\n372\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.880\nare deciding whose going to\ndo what with any given stage.\n\n373\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:40.060\nI know that it probably seems as\nthough in this controlling stage\n\n374\n00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.460\nprocess that I basically turn around and\nsay, well, it's completely up to you.\n\n375\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.160\nYou'll do what you want.\n\n376\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.480\nThat's not strictly true.\n\n377\n00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.510\nAnd certainly in a practitioner guidance,\nwe look in a lot more depth at\n\n378\n00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.510\nthe sort of activities that\nwe may be undertaking here.\n\n379\n00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.520\nHowever it is true to say\nthat it is going to be very,\n\n380\n00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.120\nvery specific to your environment.\n\n381\n00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.560\nSo whilst we can give you guidelines,\n\n382\n00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.880\nit's entirely up to you as how\nyou choose to manage your stage.\n\n383\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.150\nHow you choose to control the stage.\n\n384\n00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.520\nSo that is really our episode on\ncontrolling the stages of process.\n\n385\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.600\nWhen we come back in our next episode,\n\n386\n00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.970\nwe're going to be looking at\nmanaging product delivery.\n\n387\n00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.880\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo, that's something that,\nI can't wait to see what you\n\n388\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.450\nhave to say about that because\nI've seen a few go horribly awry.\n\n389\n00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.580\nBut you'll definitely have to come\non back to see how that plays out\n\n390\n00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.890\nbecause right now we're going\nto go ahead and get out of here.\n\n391\n00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.810\nSo signing off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Anderson.\n\n392\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:41.600\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n393\n00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.455\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n394\n00:22:42.455 --> 00:22:48.869\n[MUSIC]\n\n395\n00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:52.040\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.037\nWelcome to ITPRO.TV, I'm your host Don\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n2\n00:00:03.037 --> 00:00:06.771\n&gt;&gt; Coming at you live from San Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:10.480\nCalifornia\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV\n\n4\n00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.154\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:15.591\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:20.660\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and we're\nback with more prints to 2017 foundation,\n\n7\n00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.188\nand well, we're talking about\nmanaging product delivery.\n\n8\n00:00:24.188 --> 00:00:27.473\nThat was one of those where I was\nconcerned that I wasn't going to get\n\n9\n00:00:27.473 --> 00:00:28.625\nall of those words out,\n\n10\n00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:32.330\nbut luckily, we have someone who is\na little more adept at that than I am.\n\n11\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.430\nThe one and only Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.430\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm well,\nI was absolutely great, Justin, but\n\n14\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.770\nnow you're making claims about something\nthat you know I can't live up to.\n\n15\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.800\n&gt;&gt; I believe you can.\n\n16\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.130\nI have trust In you, Jo,\nI have faith in you.\n\n17\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.400\nThat you're gonna tell us all\nabout managing product delivery,\n\n18\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.900\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Well I could do that, yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.330\n&gt;&gt; And you're gonna do it so well,\n\n20\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.295\nso eloquently,\nthat it's just gonna blow my mind.\n\n21\n00:00:56.295 --> 00:00:59.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n22\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.560\nI'm leaving the sarcastic\ncomments until later.\n\n23\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.410\nI refuse to be lured into that one.\n\n24\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, ladies and gentlemen you\nshould probably stayed tuned because\n\n25\n00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.380\nI suspect there will be\nsome questioning of Justin.\n\n26\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.020\n&gt;&gt; There will be certainly\nin this episode.\n\n27\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.760\nOne of the first things that\ni'm going to ask you, actually,\n\n28\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.920\nbefore we even get going.\n\n29\n00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.900\nCan you remember what\nour last episode was?\n\n30\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.098\n&gt;&gt; Controlling a stage.\n\n31\n00:01:28.098 --> 00:01:32.734\n&gt;&gt; It was, okay, now when managing product\ndelivery do you know what the different\n\n32\n00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:33.903\nbetween the two is?\n\n33\n00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:35.910\n&gt;&gt; I would say.\n\n34\n00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.550\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; No, see, I told you, here it comes.\n\n35\n00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.910\nThis is going to be it.\n\n36\n00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.950\nDo you know this, Justin?\n\n37\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.450\nNope.\n\n38\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.646\n&gt;&gt; Well one of the good things that I\nreally like about sort of having Justin\n\n39\n00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:51.490\naround is that I can ridicule him.\n\n40\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.780\nNo, no that's not the reason why\nI like having Justin around.\n\n41\n00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.090\nIt's because what Justin does is\nhopefully he's probably feeling or it's\n\n42\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.420\nprobably just what you're feeling right\nnow is what Justin does is quite often.\n\n43\n00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.670\nJustin will get involved and\n\n44\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.310\nask the same sort of questions\nthat you're thinking right now.\n\n45\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.160\nThe sort of questions that come into the\nforefront of your mind as well is what's\n\n46\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.320\nthe difference between the two?\n\n47\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.300\nWhy do we have the two?\n\n48\n00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.960\nBut it's quite simple really.\n\n49\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.600\nAnd the difference between the two\nprocesses is responsibilities,\n\n50\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.010\nin that controlling the stage,\n\n51\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.690\nthe focuses on the word control and\ncontrolling that stage.\n\n52\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.330\nWhereas here,\nwe're managing product delivery.\n\n53\n00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.770\nSo what we're doing is we're\nmanaging delivery of the product\n\n54\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.710\nacross the life of the project.\n\n55\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.740\nSo in the last particular episode,\n\n56\n00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.330\nwe looked at controlling the state, and\nthat was the job of the project manager,\n\n57\n00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.920\nto control and coordinate all of\nthe activities across the state.\n\n58\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.960\nThis, well, managing product delivery\nis the job of the team manager,\n\n59\n00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:10.680\nand this is about managing the product in\nits entirety across the project itself.\n\n60\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.990\nSo if we take a look at the purpose\nthen of managing product delivery,\n\n61\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.150\nit's about controlling that link between\nthe project manager and the team manager.\n\n62\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.240\nSo having a definition\n\n63\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.960\nright up front of this is what\nwe're going to deliver and when.\n\n64\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.180\nAnd the team manager's job is to\ncoordinate, well, each individual team.\n\n65\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.270\nA project goes across functions,\ntherefore across teams, so\n\n66\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.370\nthere will be probably, and\nI use the word probably, not\n\n67\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.770\neven just potentially, for most projects\nwe've got more than one team manager.\n\n68\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.630\nAnd so where as the project\nmanagers role is actually\n\n69\n00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.320\nto coordinate across for\neach individual stage.\n\n70\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.150\nAnd for the length of the project\nis to coordinate at a higher level.\n\n71\n00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.790\nThe team manager is coordinating\nthe work of their own team.\n\n72\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.970\nSo the role of the process, the managing\nproduct delivery It's actually\n\n73\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.130\nto manage the delivery of\nthe product within the team.\n\n74\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.420\nSo it ensures that the work on product\nis authorized and it is agreed.\n\n75\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.790\nAnd that everyone is clear on\nwhat we're going to deliver.\n\n76\n00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.830\nAnd what the thresholds are or\n\n77\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.850\nwhat we call the tolerances for\nthings like effort, cost and time scales.\n\n78\n00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.510\nAnd we are delivering within that\ntolerance, or those tolerances.\n\n79\n00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.200\nAnd that progress information is\nposted on information radiators,\n\n80\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.560\non any updates, any highlight reports.\n\n81\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.660\nAnd the communication happens\nat agreed and regular intervals.\n\n82\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.340\nRegular iterative, I don't just wanna see\nprogress at the start of a project and\n\n83\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.700\nthen at the end of a project.\n\n84\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:05.600\nI want to see well progress is happening\nthroughout the course of the project.\n\n85\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.410\nSo here we have then a small diagram and\nof course it's in purple so\n\n86\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.060\nThat means that it's on page\n237 of our prints to manual.\n\n87\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.710\nAnd it's really simple.\n\n88\n00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.790\nAnd what it is,\nis simply accepting a work package,\n\n89\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.330\nexecuting the work package, and\ndelivering the work package.\n\n90\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.700\nThat almost sounds agile to me.\n\n91\n00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.540\nI don't know about to you.\n\n92\n00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.780\n&gt;&gt; It does and it's not something that\nI typically use the word package.\n\n93\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n94\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.970\n&gt;&gt; To discern, is that just like a,\nhere's a scope of,\n\n95\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.680\nthis little sliced up piece\nthat I need you to do.\n\n96\n00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.230\nIs that what is meant by a work package?\n\n97\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nif we think about this in an agile term.\n\n98\n00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.040\nA work package would be what\nwe'd call an iteration.\n\n99\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.930\nSo it's what is or\n\n100\n00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.760\nwhat stories are included in an agile\nperspective within that iteration.\n\n101\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.230\nSo in other words, this is the, these\nare the chunks of work that we're going to\n\n102\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.990\nundertake at this\nparticular point in time.\n\n103\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.920\nSo within this time span of maybe one,\ntwo, three, or four weeks.\n\n104\n00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.790\nThat's in an agile project.\n\n105\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.330\nWhere in a PRINCE2 project,\nwhich may be operating in an agile way or\n\n106\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.720\nit may be operating in more\nof a waterfall approach.\n\n107\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.290\nThen we're looking at each\nindividual stage and we're saying,\n\n108\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.660\nthese are the activities that we expect\nto be completed within each stage.\n\n109\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.410\nSo if I go back to, and I'm going to go\nright the way back if I can take a look\n\n110\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.200\nat my slides, and we're going to go right\nthe way back to this particular diagram\n\n111\n00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.480\nhere and what I'm interested\nin is that Gantt chart there.\n\n112\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.790\nIf I go back to here you'll\nsee that in each stage\n\n113\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.090\nwe have got sets of activities\nthat we want to undertake.\n\n114\n00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.830\nSo a work package for stage two would\ninclude the detailed design and\n\n115\n00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.180\nthe training syllabus.\n\n116\n00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.290\nThe work package for stage three\nwould include the peripheral design,\n\n117\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:05.600\nthe built facility, and having trained\nstaff that would be part of stage three.\n\n118\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.740\nSo that's what we're trying to release\nthe end of each individual stage.\n\n119\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.609\nWe don't want to say release so\ndon't be released to the live or\n\n120\n00:07:14.609 --> 00:07:15.757\ncreate an environment.\n\n121\n00:07:15.757 --> 00:07:19.669\ni don't mean released to our customers\nbecause obviously that would be in\n\n122\n00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:20.941\nan agile environment.\n\n123\n00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:25.546\nBut that really depends on whether\nwe're doing this in an agile way, or\n\n124\n00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:31.135\nwhether we're looking at basically\na waterfall approach as to when we relate.\n\n125\n00:07:31.135 --> 00:07:34.317\nThere's no right or\nwrong with that at all, so\n\n126\n00:07:34.317 --> 00:07:37.117\nwhat I will tell you is\nthen if we can go back.\n\n127\n00:07:37.117 --> 00:07:40.467\nSo, here we are at our last diagram.\n\n128\n00:07:40.467 --> 00:07:44.347\nWhatever is in that work\npackage is what you want for\n\n129\n00:07:44.347 --> 00:07:47.387\nthat particular stage of development work.\n\n130\n00:07:48.477 --> 00:07:52.697\nSo it's the activities you expect to\nundertake at that particular stage.\n\n131\n00:07:52.697 --> 00:07:54.840\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n132\n00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.300\n&gt;&gt; It does it's just an odd\nterminology for me, and\n\n133\n00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.240\nit would take a little bit to find out,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n134\n00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\ndon't forget about the terminology.\n\n135\n00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.580\nEverything is subject to tailoring\nin a PRINCE2 environment.\n\n136\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:13.460\nNow, sure when it comes to your test\nthen you're not gonna be tested on,\n\n137\n00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.700\ncertainly not for foundation year,\nnot gonna be tested on tailoring.\n\n138\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.810\nAnd you're gonna be tested on\nthe terminology that we use, but\n\n139\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.010\nwhat terminology you choose to use when\nyou get back into your own environment.\n\n140\n00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.140\nWell, that's completely up to you.\n\n141\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.360\nI mean we're certainly\nnot going to come in and\n\n142\n00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.375\njudge you an audit you based on\nthe fact that you changed a word.\n\n143\n00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:34.370\n[LAUGH] So don't worry about that.\n\n144\n00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.520\nIt's just that you\nunderstand the principles.\n\n145\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.210\nAnd the PRINCE2 project works to\nthe PRINCE2 principles and theme.\n\n146\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.060\nIt's not necessarily about being\npedantic over the words that we use.\n\n147\n00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.260\nSo we've got three particular activities\nthat we've got here, accepting the work\n\n148\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.060\npackage, executing the work package,\nand delivering the work package.\n\n149\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.800\nAnd very much like control in\na stage these work packages,\n\n150\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.740\nwell they're gonna be completely\ntailored to your environment.\n\n151\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.400\nSo again, we're not going to\nspend a lot of time talking about\n\n152\n00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.440\nthese particular activities because\nI expect them to be to be tailored.\n\n153\n00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.410\nSo when it comes to\naccepting the work package,\n\n154\n00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.010\nthat means that what we're doing\nis we're reviewing the plan.\n\n155\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.230\nWe're going to produce at this level,\nthis is the team manager,\n\n156\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.610\nwe're going to produce a work plan for\nthe actual team.\n\n157\n00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.340\nMake sure that we can\nactually deliver this and\n\n158\n00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.280\nthat it meets the needs\nof the organization.\n\n159\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.060\nAnd then,\nagree when we're gonna deliver it.\n\n160\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.410\nAnd then, well, we build.\n\n161\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.290\nWhich means that we actually develop the\nproduct and we keep everybody informed.\n\n162\n00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.700\nWhether it's the by use of information\nradiative kanban boards etcetera or\n\n163\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.540\nmaybe ScanDocs.\n\n164\n00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.570\nAnd we obtain any approvals for\nany issues that we may have.\n\n165\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.710\nAnd we then deliver the work package.\n\n166\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.490\nAnd when we deliver the work package,\n\n167\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:03.410\nwell we have to ensure that everything\nis complete as per the quality register.\n\n168\n00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:09.500\nAnd that all of the approvals that we have\nsuch as your customer acceptance etcetera.\n\n169\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.160\nWell did they,\nall those boxes have been tainted.\n\n170\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.400\nEverybody's happy with\nwhat we have delivered.\n\n171\n00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.560\nAnd then we notify the project manager\nthat work has been complete and\n\n172\n00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.860\nthen as you see then that is delivered\nback into the control inner stage.\n\n173\n00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.170\nIn other words its reported back to,\nits delivered back to the project manager.\n\n174\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.150\nSo as we've said with\nthe controlling of stage,\n\n175\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:38.700\nwell tailoring a managing a product,\nhas to be done.\n\n176\n00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.800\nIt's completely up to you,\nwithin your organization,\n\n177\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.280\nas to how you are going to\ntailor this particular process.\n\n178\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.140\nBecause product delivery is going\nto be very, very unique to you.\n\n179\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.500\nSo think about the tools\nthat we're going to use.\n\n180\n00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.150\nRemember what we said in our last episode,\nwhen it comes to tools.\n\n181\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.610\nYou define your process first, you work\nout what you want from a tool, and\n\n182\n00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.620\nthen you go and\nfind a tool to facilitate that.\n\n183\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.160\nYou don't bring in a tool and then try and\n\n184\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.710\ntailor a product to meet the needs of any\ntool that you're using to deliver it.\n\n185\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.680\nThink about who the roles and\nresponsibilities should be.\n\n186\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.680\nAnd obviously it really depends on\nthe scale of the project itself.\n\n187\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:31.000\nAnd whether we're in an agile environment\nor a waterfall approach, environment.\n\n188\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.530\nThink about the perspective of your\nsupplier both internal and external.\n\n189\n00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.990\nThey're gonna use their lessons learnt\nas I've said in a previous episode.\n\n190\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.970\nI want them to bring their\nexperience into this.\n\n191\n00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.270\nIf we're using somebody, we're using\nsuppliers without any experience,\n\n192\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.700\nthen they need to be very,\nvery highly skilled at what they do.\n\n193\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.490\nBut then that means that we have to use\nour experience of our organization in\n\n194\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.480\norder then to ensure that our suppliers\nare able to tailor to meet our needs.\n\n195\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.360\nI don't expect any external suppliers to\n\n196\n00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.560\nnecessarily understand our\nenvironment right from the word go.\n\n197\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:15.170\nBut I expect throughout every single\nstage that they are developing their\n\n198\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.200\ntailoring and that they are enhancing\ntheir knowledge of the environment.\n\n199\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.660\nAnd therefore I expect the lessons\nlearned to be getting greater and\n\n200\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.830\nthe adjustments to the way\nthat we're working to also\n\n201\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.660\nbe made that we're working more\nefficiently as the project goes along.\n\n202\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.920\nSo in terms of managing product delivery,\n\n203\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.840\nthen really it's to say\neverything has to be tailored.\n\n204\n00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.370\nSo that's pretty much all we're\ngoing to cover right now.\n\n205\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:52.410\nYou will need to understand the purpose\nof this particular process for your exam.\n\n206\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.590\nBut everything else is going\nto be tailored to suit\n\n207\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.700\nthe needs of your organization.\n\n208\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.310\nSo when we come back in\nat our next episode what\n\n209\n00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:05.280\nwe're going to take a look at managing\nthe boundaries between stages.\n\n210\n00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.270\nSo we're going to be looking\nat managing stage boundaries.\n\n211\n00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.330\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo I will tell you I'm kind\nintrigued because I I'm not entirely\n\n212\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.580\nsure what is meant by state boundary but\nyou know what,\n\n213\n00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.720\nwe're going to have to come on\nback to see how that plays out.\n\n214\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.890\nBut right now we're going to go ahead and\n\n215\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:21.771\nget out of here\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n216\n00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:24.508\nsigning up for\nITPRO.TV I'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n217\n00:13:24.508 --> 00:13:25.220\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n218\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.010\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n219\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:32.892\n[MUSIC]\n\n220\n00:13:32.892 --> 00:13:35.227\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:06.199\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:08.191\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.735\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.310\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.254\nAnd we're back on PRINCE2 2017 Foundation.\n\n9\n00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.253\nWhoo.\n&gt;&gt; Are you struggling?\n\n10\n00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:23.737\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what is wrong with me.\n\n11\n00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:27.485\nBut in this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about managing a stage boundary\n\n12\n00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:31.405\nand here to help us along and hopefully be\na little bit more eloquent than I am being\n\n13\n00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:33.670\ncurrently is none other\nthan Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n14\n00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.090\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n15\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, clearly I'm a lot more\narticulate than you are today.\n\n16\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.700\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what.\n\n17\n00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.424\nI have no idea what is I have been\novercome by the lack of ability to\n\n18\n00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:47.718\nspeak in any [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; At the end of the episode I'll get you\n\n19\n00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:49.190\ncaffeine, I promise.\n\n20\n00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.085\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nwell I don't know if that's gonna help.\n\n21\n00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.020\nMaybe I need to drink of less caffeine.\n\n22\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.700\n&gt;&gt; Let me take this one, how about that?\n\n23\n00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.000\nYou let me take this and then you\ncan stand there and look pretty and\n\n24\n00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.690\nthat will work for everyone.\n\n25\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.880\n&gt;&gt; I will try my best.\n\n26\n00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.480\nI will try real, real hard.\n\n27\n00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.750\n&gt;&gt; But yeah what we're gonna be looking\nat in this particular episode is managing\n\n28\n00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.590\na Stage Boundary.\n\n29\n00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.629\nNow unfortunately,\n\n30\n00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:15.380\nJustin has kind of scuppered all of my\nplans because I was gonna involve him and\n\n31\n00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.496\nthe first thing that I was gonna do\nwas gonna ask him a question but\n\n32\n00:01:18.496 --> 00:01:22.099\nI'm not too sure whether that's a really\nsensible thing to do right now.\n\n33\n00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.218\n&gt;&gt; Well I like to live on the edge,\nyou like to live on the edge?\n\n34\n00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.415\nI mean we can try it.\n\n35\n00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:27.411\n&gt;&gt; Well we could try it.\n\n36\n00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:29.271\n[LAUGH] And see what happens.\n\n37\n00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:31.418\n&gt;&gt; What's the worst that could happen?\n\n38\n00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:32.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.450\n&gt;&gt; I don't even wanna go there,\n\n40\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.200\nI really don't.\n\n41\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.100\nYou asked me earlier on during one of\n\n42\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.240\nour breaks in between episodes you\nasked what a stage boundary was.\n\n43\n00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.920\nAnd I explained what a stage boundary was.\n\n44\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.420\nI gave him a bit of a heads-up.\n\n45\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080\nSo I'm gonna ask you\nwhat can you remember?\n\n46\n00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.230\n&gt;&gt; A stage boundary is the little\ndotted line on the Gantt chart.\n\n47\n00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.330\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Where we,\n\n48\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.550\nit's like the interface\nbetween two respective stages.\n\n49\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.995\n&gt;&gt; And that's not what I told him, but.\n\n50\n00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:04.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is not what she told me.\n\n51\n00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.805\nBut, that's all I could remember.\n\n52\n00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:10.325\n[LAUGH] Because that's what I asked you.\n\n53\n00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:11.817\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just not too sure how you\n\n54\n00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:14.070\nremembered something\nthat I didn't tell you.\n\n55\n00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.730\n&gt;&gt; No you didn't tell me,\nthat's what I was.\n\n56\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.770\nI ask you about that.\n\n57\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.810\nI remembered my question.\n\n58\n00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.910\nWe lived on the edge there and\nI think we came to the precipice.\n\n59\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.790\n&gt;&gt; I think we kind of came\nto the edge really, really.\n\n60\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.620\n&gt;&gt; Watch out there's\na crevasse right over there.\n\n61\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah and\nI'm tempted to push right now [LAUGH].\n\n62\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.550\nNo, it's that actually he wasn't too bad.\n\n63\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.580\nA stage boundary is we\nknow that we have stages.\n\n64\n00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.160\nWe had them in our Gantt charts, and if\nyou look back at the material that we gave\n\n65\n00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.000\nyou, the downloadable material where you\nsaw the project Gantt chart, and you will\n\n66\n00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.520\nsee that a stage is a set of activities\nthat are happening at that point in time.\n\n67\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.690\nManaging a stage boundary is really simply\nmanaging the end of one's stage and\n\n68\n00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.030\nthen the authorization to\nproceed to the next stage.\n\n69\n00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:07.945\nYeah I remember I used that word?\n\n70\n00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:09.385\n&gt;&gt; It's all coming back to me now Jo.\n\n71\n00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:11.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's all coming back right.\n\n72\n00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:11.915\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n73\n00:03:11.915 --> 00:03:13.895\n&gt;&gt; So if we take a look at the purpose\n\n74\n00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:16.255\nthen of this particular process.\n\n75\n00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:20.075\nIt's about enabling the project\nmanager to provide the project.\n\n76\n00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:24.745\nNot the project team but the project\nwith sufficient information to be able\n\n77\n00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:29.765\nto review what went right and\nthen approve the next stage plan.\n\n78\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.570\nAnd then you'd review that plan and\nthen say okay, yes that's great,\n\n79\n00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.010\nwe've got continued\nbusiness justification.\n\n80\n00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.910\nWe understand the risks and\neverything's looking great.\n\n81\n00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.450\nLet's move onto the next stage.\n\n82\n00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.811\nSo this is what our stage boundary is.\n\n83\n00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:53.906\nAs it says reviewing whether\nwe did well in our current\n\n84\n00:03:53.906 --> 00:03:59.810\nmanagement stage and\nthen approving the next stage plan.\n\n85\n00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.270\nHm, actually this is quite a chunk\nof work when you think about this.\n\n86\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.440\nSo what we've got to do is\nwe've got to look back.\n\n87\n00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.500\nOn the current stage and\nwe've got to say okay what went well and\n\n88\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.370\nwhat didn't go well?\n\n89\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.230\nAnd then we've got to work out\nour plan for the next stage.\n\n90\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.320\nI am gonna ask him another question.\n\n91\n00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.260\nWhy don't we do this right\nat the start of the project?\n\n92\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.213\n&gt;&gt; Well we can't possibly plan out all\nof our stages because that would be way\n\n93\n00:04:29.213 --> 00:04:30.791\ntoo much work up front.\n\n94\n00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:34.167\nWe would plan all these things\nthat could possibly change, right?\n\n95\n00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:38.854\nShouldn't we do this at,\nessentially we plan for the next step.\n\n96\n00:04:38.854 --> 00:04:40.449\nShouldn't we do that at\nthat at that point in time?\n\n97\n00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.388\n&gt;&gt; You kind of got things a little bit\nmixed up on there because you said\n\n98\n00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:46.300\nsomething about we've got\nway too much work up front.\n\n99\n00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.130\nI don't care how much work you got\nup front, to be perfectly honest.\n\n100\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.841\n&gt;&gt; What I mean is,\ntoo much work that is subject to change.\n\n101\n00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:56.154\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n102\n00:04:56.154 --> 00:05:00.548\n&gt;&gt; So I remember a previous episode Jo\nyou said we shouldn't try to plan out all\n\n103\n00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:02.522\nthese stages over the long term.\n\n104\n00:05:02.522 --> 00:05:05.427\nWe should look at just what's in\nfront of us like the next step.\n\n105\n00:05:05.427 --> 00:05:06.937\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n106\n00:05:06.937 --> 00:05:08.797\n&gt;&gt; And I remember, and\n\n107\n00:05:08.797 --> 00:05:13.457\nmaybe I'm remembering wrong\nbecause I have been known,\n\n108\n00:05:13.457 --> 00:05:17.817\nthen the impetus for that was because we\nneeded to reevaluate at the end of each\n\n109\n00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:22.710\nstage to determine Whether we're still\nprogressing in the manner that we hope to.\n\n110\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm gonna change some of your\nwords because I'm gonna take them and\n\n111\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.360\nchange some of them because I think, and\n\n112\n00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.630\nthis is, and I've said this in previous\nepisodes but this is the reason why,\n\n113\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.120\nthis is why we love this\nparticular sort of format.\n\n114\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.050\nThis is why I got Justin here actually,\n\n115\n00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.150\nbecause Justin's asking the questions\nthat you would normally ask me and also\n\n116\n00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.260\nJustin's sort of giving me the directions\nto say, hm okay then well maybe if you've\n\n117\n00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.610\nmisunderstood something then somebody else\nhas probably misunderstood something too.\n\n118\n00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.660\nAnd it's really easy to do.\n\n119\n00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.770\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to re-explain this again.\n\n120\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.750\nSo the reason why we don't plan for\neverything right up front\n\n121\n00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.470\nis not because of the amount of work but\njust because it's inefficient to do that.\n\n122\n00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.110\nBecause, exactly what Justin said,\nthat things could change.\n\n123\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.406\nBut also, we simply don't know where we're\ngoing to be at the end of each stage.\n\n124\n00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:21.679\nThink of it like walking to a destination\nbecause that's what we are doing.\n\n125\n00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:26.820\nAs we're walking to our destination,\nwe take one step after the other.\n\n126\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.030\nIf we plan every single step\nin great detail we are putting\n\n127\n00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.310\na lot of work in but it's not efficient\nfor us to do that because what will happen\n\n128\n00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.320\nis that we will end up with a duplication\nof work we will end up with a lot of.\n\n129\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.420\nI'm gonna use the word redundancy but\nI'm gonna use that in the English sense of\n\n130\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.540\nthe word redundancy which is superfluous\nto requirements because quite\n\n131\n00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.040\nsimply if we've planned this first stage,\n\n132\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.850\nwell we might actually take a bigger\nstep than we thought we were going to.\n\n133\n00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.220\nOr we might take a smaller step\nbecause of unforeseen circumstances.\n\n134\n00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.420\nWhich means that if we've\nplanned the whole thing out,\n\n135\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.680\nthen everything from here onwards,\nis now redundant?\n\n136\n00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.170\nIt's now obsolete.\n\n137\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.550\nIt's useless.\n\n138\n00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.330\nSo it wouldn't be efficient to do that\nbecause it would be just a waste of time.\n\n139\n00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.430\nSo it's not about spending too much time,\nit's about wasting too much time.\n\n140\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.760\nIt would be inefficient to do so.\n\n141\n00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.840\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nstill have a high level goal, but\n\n142\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.750\nwe're just going to plan each\nindividual stage in great detail.\n\n143\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.300\nSo this is why we've still got this\noverarching project planned, but\n\n144\n00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:45.460\nthat's the reason why at the end of every\nstage we now go on to plan the next stage.\n\n145\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.899\nBecause we've got to look back to see what\nwe achieved, and our next stage then is\n\n146\n00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:53.426\ngenerally dependent on how far we\ngot with our previous stage and\n\n147\n00:07:53.426 --> 00:07:57.605\nif there's any remedial work that needs\ndoing, or if there are any issues or\n\n148\n00:07:57.605 --> 00:07:59.006\nany changes to our work.\n\n149\n00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:00.182\nSo does that make sense?\n\n150\n00:08:00.182 --> 00:08:03.750\n&gt;&gt; It does, and\nI think ultimately I was trying to say.\n\n151\n00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.094\nEffectively that.\n\n152\n00:08:05.094 --> 00:08:09.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just I couldn't quite find the words to\n\n153\n00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.580\nbe able to articulate it.\n\n154\n00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.530\nSo when I say that there's a lot of work\nupfront, I'm not saying about the relative\n\n155\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.720\nmagnitude, I'm talking about, I'm gonna\ndo a lot of work knowing that if I do\n\n156\n00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.360\nall of that, I'm only going to keep\nthe benefits from a small portion.\n\n157\n00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n158\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.180\nA lot of the work's gonna be done upfront\nand then a lot of it's going to be wasted,\n\n159\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.730\nand it's important that you're\nable to articulate that.\n\n160\n00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.400\nCertainly when it comes to, well,\nboth your foundation test and\n\n161\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.850\nyour practitioner test.\n\n162\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:40.450\nIn your practitioner test, you will need\nto articulate this, you will need to be\n\n163\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.770\nable to understand why we do\ncertain things in certain ways.\n\n164\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.630\nAnd so it's very important to get your\nunderstanding on the right track.\n\n165\n00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.690\nSo managing the stage boundary then is to\njust look back at what we've achieved and\n\n166\n00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.045\nthen work out what we need\nto do in the next stage.\n\n167\n00:08:57.045 --> 00:09:00.880\nBearing in mind that we're only planning\nour next stage in great detail,\n\n168\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.820\nwe're not planning subsequent\nstages in any detail.\n\n169\n00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.890\nSo here we have then our\nmanaging a stage boundary,\n\n170\n00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.900\nit's our purple diagram,\nwhich means, Justin?\n\n171\n00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.070\n&gt;&gt; It's from my PRINCE2 book.\n\n172\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.840\n&gt;&gt; Hey, look at that, see?\n\n173\n00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.890\nIt's from our PRINCE2 book.\n\n174\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:22.750\nIt's more importanly from page 247 on\nour PRINCE2 book, that's 2-4-7, 247.\n\n175\n00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:28.850\nAnd you'll see that the dotted-line,\nthat sort of pale purple dotted-line,\n\n176\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.250\nthese are the activities that\nare managing the stage boundary.\n\n177\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.380\nNow, when it comes to your practitioner,\nand\n\n178\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.760\nwe'll be looking at that\nin a different series,\n\n179\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.790\nyou'll notice that we talk about inputs\nand outputs a lot more than we do here.\n\n180\n00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.760\nWhat we're focusing on\nhere is what activities\n\n181\n00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.800\ntake place in the managing\nthe stage boundary.\n\n182\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.300\nSo we're going to review\nour previous stage and\n\n183\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.190\nwe are going to then authorize\nmovement to the next stage.\n\n184\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.140\nIn other words,\ndid we finish everything in that stage?\n\n185\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.850\nCan we move to the next stage?\n\n186\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.065\nAnd then how do we plan for\nthe next stage?\n\n187\n00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:07.410\nSo then it simply says,\nplan the next stage,\n\n188\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.120\nwe update the project plan,\nwe update the business case and\n\n189\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.440\nwe report that particular stage end for\nthe previous stage.\n\n190\n00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.750\nAnd any exception plan as\nwell that needs to come in.\n\n191\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.605\nSo if something has not quite gone right,\n\n192\n00:10:21.605 --> 00:10:27.250\nthen we probably need to factor that in\nand we need to then develop and plan for\n\n193\n00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:32.950\ndeveloping a change,\ndeveloping an update, developing\n\n194\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:38.800\na remedial action from any mistake that's\nhappened or any error that's come about.\n\n195\n00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.038\nBecause let's face it,\nwe're in IT and these things happen.\n\n196\n00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:48.830\nAnd we also have to factor in too into\nour plan, any requests for change.\n\n197\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:53.110\nSo any issues,\nany requests to move the tolerances or\n\n198\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.570\nany request for a change in functionality.\n\n199\n00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:03.880\nSo this particular process then, the role\nis to assure the project board that all\n\n200\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.160\nof our previous steps have been completed,\nunless there have been issues and\n\n201\n00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.100\nexceptions, in which case we've got to\nassure them that they've been reviewed and\n\n202\n00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.130\nthat we have made the necessary\nupdates to the plan, and\n\n203\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.210\nperhaps the necessary updates to\nthe business justification as well.\n\n204\n00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:27.710\nAnd then we prepare the next plan for\nthe next stage and update that PID.\n\n205\n00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.170\nSo the project initiation documentation,\n\n206\n00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.480\nwe will need to make sure that\nthat's updated if we need to.\n\n207\n00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.960\nWe also need to update the business case\n\n208\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.440\nif there is any change to\nthe business justification.\n\n209\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:49.390\nAs the project progresses and\nthe project moves through development and\n\n210\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:54.650\nvarious stages,\nI expect that there will be changes\n\n211\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.960\nthroughout the project to the business\ncase, and to the business justification,\n\n212\n00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.630\nbecause I expect there to be\nchanges to the requirements.\n\n213\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:09.120\nWe live in an environment now\nunlike when PRINCE2 came out in\n\n214\n00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.850\nthe 1980s where a PRINCE2 project was\nsomething that maybe took a year,\n\n215\n00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.050\n18 months from beginning to end.\n\n216\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.170\nNow we live in an agile environment\nwhere projects are delivering\n\n217\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.470\non a continual basis,\nand where a project is,\n\n218\n00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.120\nwell, we're expected to be able\nto deliver very, very quickly.\n\n219\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.320\nAnd requirements change\nincredibly quickly.\n\n220\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.530\nBecause technology now,\nin the 21st century,\n\n221\n00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.200\ntechnology changes\nincredibly quickly as well.\n\n222\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.750\nI mean, here we are, and\nwe've just updated PRINCE2 to 2017.\n\n223\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:49.750\nAnd here we are looking at PRINCE2\nsaying okay, then we know that\n\n224\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:54.830\nthe project management environment is\nchanged since the last version came out.\n\n225\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:59.830\nBut we also understand that,\nthat will change as well in the future\n\n226\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.870\nbecause the way that we\ndeliver projects and\n\n227\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:07.350\nthe way that we develop also has\nchanged in the last few years.\n\n228\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:12.718\nThat means that we know that our\nprojects have got to be flexible.\n\n229\n00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:15.890\nWe know they've got to meet\nthe needs of the organization, but\n\n230\n00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.390\nwe still have to have\nthat structure in place.\n\n231\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.580\nIt can't be done in an ad hoc way.\n\n232\n00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.000\nAnd if you look at our previous episodes,\none of our very first episodes in this\n\n233\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.850\nparticular series in fact, we looked\nat the danger to the organization and\n\n234\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:36.000\nthe chaos that just ensuues from not\nhaving any structure to our projects.\n\n235\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.383\nBut we also know that that's got\nto be balance because we've got\n\n236\n00:13:39.383 --> 00:13:43.570\nto get project management flexible\nenough to meet those changing needs.\n\n237\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:50.350\nWe also need to submit any information.\n\n238\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:55.620\nOn the viability of the project back\nto the project board at this point,\n\n239\n00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.050\nit's at this point where I would expect,\nif needed, I would expect\n\n240\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.872\nproject board to make any decisions on\nthe continuing viability of the project.\n\n241\n00:14:05.872 --> 00:14:09.900\nIn other words, whether the project\nshould be prematurely closed or not.\n\n242\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.030\nAnd sometimes we do prematurely\nclose a project, and\n\n243\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:17.340\nit's at this point in time where I expect\nwe have all of the information and\n\n244\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.020\nwe collate all of the information\n\n245\n00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:25.120\nto give to the project board to\nallow them to make those decisions.\n\n246\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.160\nAnd we also record lessons learnt.\n\n247\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.590\nAnd then of course as I've already said,\n\n248\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.980\nwe request the authorization to\nstart that next management stage.\n\n249\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:41.384\nSo what we're doing is, we're planning,\nwe're updating, we're reporting and\n\n250\n00:14:41.384 --> 00:14:46.070\nwe would produce any exception plan,\nanything that has gone wrong.\n\n251\n00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:50.920\nAnything that has stepped outside\nof the agreed tolerances.\n\n252\n00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.962\nThe tolerances that we agreed\nat the beginning of the project,\n\n253\n00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:57.563\nbearing in mind that they could change.\n\n254\n00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:00.121\nSo when we're planning the next stage,\n\n255\n00:15:00.121 --> 00:15:04.937\nthen we need to make sure that we review\nthat project initiation document for\n\n256\n00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:08.413\nany changes and we prepare the plan for\nthe next stage.\n\n257\n00:15:08.413 --> 00:15:10.460\nThat's the detailed plan by the way.\n\n258\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.200\nAnd so we're planning for a stage.\n\n259\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.670\nWho do you think does this, Justin?\n\n260\n00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.770\n&gt;&gt; Planning for a stage.\n\n261\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.070\nWould that, that one's tricky.\n\n262\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.620\nWould the project board be doing that?\n\n263\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.160\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n264\n00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.800\n&gt;&gt; Project manager?\n\n265\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.180\n&gt;&gt; No.\nThe project manager.\n\n266\n00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.770\nYeah, the executive, the project board,\n\n267\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.132\nthey're going to be giving the\nauthorization to move to the next stage.\n\n268\n00:15:30.132 --> 00:15:33.430\nProject manager's gonna be preparing and\nplanning for the next stage, and\n\n269\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:38.620\nthen the team managers are gonna be\npreparing all of the activities,\n\n270\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.976\nthe individual work packages.\n\n271\n00:15:40.976 --> 00:15:42.620\nYeah.\n\n272\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.740\nAnd then of course we've got to\ncreate any CI record as well,\n\n273\n00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.290\nthese are our configuration item records,\nremember?\n\n274\n00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:53.808\nWhen we're in a project,\nwe're updating or we are creating even,\n\n275\n00:15:53.808 --> 00:15:56.754\ndeploying new CIs, configuration items.\n\n276\n00:15:56.754 --> 00:16:00.546\nNow, I know that we've\nmentioned CIs before.\n\n277\n00:16:00.546 --> 00:16:04.995\nA CI is An asset,\nit's either a tangible or\n\n278\n00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:09.459\nan intangible asset to our organization.\n\n279\n00:16:09.459 --> 00:16:15.570\nIf you're not sure about CIs, if you don't\nunderstand what a configuration item is?\n\n280\n00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:19.805\nThen what I'd suggest you do is,\nI would like you,\n\n281\n00:16:19.805 --> 00:16:24.780\npart of your subscription,\ngo to the ITIL series.\n\n282\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.560\nWithin the ITIL series,\n\n283\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.080\nyou have a particularly series\non ITIL service transition.\n\n284\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.240\nGo into service transition, and took\na look at the episode on service asset and\n\n285\n00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.090\nconfiguration management.\n\n286\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.226\nAnd in that particular episode,\n\n287\n00:16:39.226 --> 00:16:42.898\nyou will see a full description\non configuration items.\n\n288\n00:16:42.898 --> 00:16:45.588\nIt will explain to you what\nconfiguration items are,\n\n289\n00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:49.790\nit will explain how they should be stored\nin the configuration management system.\n\n290\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:55.350\nAnd it will also tell you how we'd manage\nconfiguration item records as well, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:17:00.960\nSo if you are unsure of what a CI is,\nand in fact, you know what?\n\n292\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.531\nEven if you're not unsure, I would\nrecommend that you would go to that\n\n293\n00:17:05.531 --> 00:17:08.940\nparticular episode and\ntake a look at CIs, anyway,\n\n294\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.674\nbecause that will help you out for\nthis particular test.\n\n295\n00:17:12.674 --> 00:17:16.485\nJust to make sure that we've all got\nthe same understanding of what a CI is,\n\n296\n00:17:16.485 --> 00:17:19.391\nrather than all of us having\ndifferent understandings,\n\n297\n00:17:19.391 --> 00:17:21.650\ncuz that's not gonna\nhelp you in your test.\n\n298\n00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.105\nSo, planning the next stage means we've\nalso got to update what we perceive as\n\n299\n00:17:27.105 --> 00:17:30.170\nquality, or\nwhat our customers perceive as quality.\n\n300\n00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.682\nSo updating that quality register for\nwhat is expected,\n\n301\n00:17:34.682 --> 00:17:39.110\nas well as updating our issues and\nour risk logs as well.\n\n302\n00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.740\nAnd then we update our current stage plan,\nbecause our plans are, well,\n\n303\n00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:50.580\nthis is a very high-level, this is how\nwe're going to get to the project itself,\n\n304\n00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.680\nthe end deliverable.\n\n305\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.758\nSo that's at high-level,\nthat needs to be updating, but\n\n306\n00:17:56.758 --> 00:17:59.458\nalso the specific change plan as well.\n\n307\n00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:03.120\nOr this specific stage plan,\nsorry, not the change plan.\n\n308\n00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.521\nAnd then revise the entire project plan,\nas I've said,\n\n309\n00:18:07.521 --> 00:18:13.495\nincluding any baselines, any forecasts,\nthey will all need to be revised.\n\n310\n00:18:13.495 --> 00:18:16.500\nAnd then don't forget,\nI've already mentioned the business case.\n\n311\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.386\nAnd the business case\nwill need to be updated,\n\n312\n00:18:19.386 --> 00:18:23.461\nif the justifications have changed,\nif our output has changed.\n\n313\n00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:26.742\nIf the product that we're\ndelivering has changed in any way,\n\n314\n00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:31.050\nthen we need to make sure that we've still\ngot a viable business justification.\n\n315\n00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:38.290\nEven if our product hasn't changed,\nand our requirements haven't changed,\n\n316\n00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.700\nyou should still be evaluating the\nbusiness case at the end of every stage.\n\n317\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.410\nBecause you know what,\n\n318\n00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.910\nbusiness requirements might change,\nthings happen in the outside world.\n\n319\n00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.228\nNew technology is released,\nthat's easy for me to say as well.\n\n320\n00:18:53.228 --> 00:18:57.634\nI thought I would promise that I would\nbe more articulate than Justin, but\n\n321\n00:18:57.634 --> 00:18:59.971\nmaybe not, [LAUGH], but-\n&gt;&gt; It must be something in the air, Jo,\n\n322\n00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:00.639\nit must be something in the air.\n\n323\n00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:04.690\n&gt;&gt; It must be, right, it must be,\nI don't know, atmospheric today.\n\n324\n00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.951\nBut going back to the business case,\n\n325\n00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:10.574\nbecause things change\nin the outside world.\n\n326\n00:19:10.574 --> 00:19:13.820\nAnd the business might decide\nthat they do want something else.\n\n327\n00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.320\nAnd the last thing that we want to do,\nreally, is get three or\n\n328\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.760\nfour stages in, having spent a lot of\nmoney, and I have seen this happen.\n\n329\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.521\nWhere we spent a lot of money\ndeveloping something, only for\n\n330\n00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:26.239\nthe business to turn around and\nsay, well, you know what?\n\n331\n00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:30.015\nBut I wanted that new technology\nthat was released three months ago,\n\n332\n00:19:30.015 --> 00:19:31.285\nI was expecting that.\n\n333\n00:19:31.285 --> 00:19:35.408\nAnd that comes from bad communication\nbetween the business and\n\n334\n00:19:35.408 --> 00:19:38.452\nthe project team, but\nit happens quite a lot.\n\n335\n00:19:38.452 --> 00:19:42.096\nWhere things have changed in\nthe real world, the customer assumes\n\n336\n00:19:42.096 --> 00:19:46.470\nthat the project is going to change\nbecause of that, and the project doesn't.\n\n337\n00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.610\nAnd then we end up not delivering what\nthey want, and their satisfaction and\n\n338\n00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.419\ntheir perception of quality\nis not very high at all.\n\n339\n00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:59.510\nSo at the end of every stage, we need\nto report that that stage has ended.\n\n340\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.590\nIncluding a summary of,\nwell, where we've got to,\n\n341\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:08.954\nincluding a summary of our current\nprogress throughout the project.\n\n342\n00:20:08.954 --> 00:20:12.000\nYou've heard of a burn down chart?\n\n343\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.988\n&gt;&gt; I have.\n&gt;&gt; Do you know-\n\n344\n00:20:12.988 --> 00:20:13.905\n&gt;&gt; I've heard those phrases before.\n\n345\n00:20:13.905 --> 00:20:19.047\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, this is one\n\n346\n00:20:19.047 --> 00:20:22.692\nof the things were, I've not necessarily\never been in a management role.\n\n347\n00:20:22.692 --> 00:20:27.394\nBut a burn down chart is how we\nare progressing over a particular\n\n348\n00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.709\nstage with progress, right?\n\n349\n00:20:29.709 --> 00:20:32.990\nHow many tasks we're finishing\nover a certain time period?\n\n350\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.203\n&gt;&gt; Right, burn down chart\nis how much we've got left.\n\n351\n00:20:37.483 --> 00:20:41.369\nRight, so it's burn down, how much of\nthe project have we burned away, and\n\n352\n00:20:41.369 --> 00:20:43.560\nhow much do we have left?\n\n353\n00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.868\nThat's a burn down chart, and we can apply\nthat to every single work stage, and\n\n354\n00:20:47.868 --> 00:20:48.784\na burn up chart?\n\n355\n00:20:50.584 --> 00:20:53.404\n&gt;&gt; That seems counterintuitive to me,\nbecause I've never set anything on\n\n356\n00:20:53.404 --> 00:20:55.730\nfire and been like, look,\nit grew from the ground.\n\n357\n00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.637\n&gt;&gt; Right-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:20:57.637 --> 00:20:58.349\n&gt;&gt; But that's how much we've done.\n\n359\n00:20:58.349 --> 00:21:02.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthat's like a ramp-up or whatever?\n\n360\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.951\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so it's much we've done\nversus how much we've got left to do.\n\n361\n00:21:06.951 --> 00:21:09.915\n&gt;&gt; Feel like there should be a better\nname for that burn up chart.\n\n362\n00:21:09.915 --> 00:21:12.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH], yeah, you know what,\nthat's completely up to you.\n\n363\n00:21:12.682 --> 00:21:15.969\n&gt;&gt; Someone went, well, we got burn down,\nlet's just go ahead and have a burn up.\n\n364\n00:21:15.969 --> 00:21:19.196\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I've seen this\ncombined into one chart, and\n\n365\n00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:21.170\nI don't mind if that's what you do.\n\n366\n00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.712\nBut this is what we are, this is what\nwe're doing here at this stage end,\n\n367\n00:21:25.712 --> 00:21:29.280\nis we're just reporting as\nto how far we have gone.\n\n368\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.208\nAnd we also want to make note of how\nfar we've got left to go, as well, so\n\n369\n00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.069\nwhat's left.\n\n370\n00:21:34.069 --> 00:21:39.180\nBecause it's when we, it's funny, but it's\nwhen we report on what we've got left?\n\n371\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.042\nThat's generally when the business\nturn around and say to us, but\n\n372\n00:21:42.042 --> 00:21:44.779\nactually, I've forgot about this,\nand I've forgot about that.\n\n373\n00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:49.575\nSo that's the bit where, we've gotta\nmake sure that is communicated.\n\n374\n00:21:49.575 --> 00:21:53.178\nIt's not just a case of, hey look, this\nis how much we've done, but it's also,\n\n375\n00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:55.074\nthis is how much we've got to do, as well.\n\n376\n00:21:55.074 --> 00:21:58.867\nAnd then we've got this exception plan,\nand this exception report,\n\n377\n00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:02.400\ntoo, which is just where\nthings went wrong, really.\n\n378\n00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.978\nIt's, if we've had any issues,\nthese were the issues that we had.\n\n379\n00:22:05.978 --> 00:22:09.634\nOr any problems,\nthis is the problem that we ran into,\n\n380\n00:22:09.634 --> 00:22:12.584\nand this is what we're\ngoing to do about it.\n\n381\n00:22:12.584 --> 00:22:17.499\nOr this is when we've had any requests for\nchange, any RFCs that have come in,\n\n382\n00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:22.320\nthat ask us to do something a little\nbit different to change the output.\n\n383\n00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.928\nAnd so we have to ensure that\nwe produce an exception plan for\n\n384\n00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:28.898\nhow we're going to deal\nwith those exceptions.\n\n385\n00:22:28.898 --> 00:22:33.370\nYou don't just accept them into\nthe project as if nothing's happened.\n\n386\n00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.117\nBecause ultimately,\nthey are going to involve more effort,\n\n387\n00:22:37.117 --> 00:22:39.071\nit's gonna involve more work.\n\n388\n00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:42.008\nAnd that could potentially mean more cost,\nor it could mean a longer time scale,\n\n389\n00:22:42.008 --> 00:22:43.619\nevery single change is\ngoing to cost money.\n\n390\n00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:48.456\nAnd every single change is\ngonna cost money that was never\n\n391\n00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:53.110\njustified right at the very\nbeginning of the project.\n\n392\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.155\nSo it's just not as simple as saying,\nyeah, we can do that.\n\n393\n00:22:58.155 --> 00:23:00.642\nThat answer, which I quite\noften get from developers, and\n\n394\n00:23:00.642 --> 00:23:02.880\nI'm not gonna look at him at all, [LAUGH].\n\n395\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.173\nBut that answer is generally gonna\ncost us a lot more money, and\n\n396\n00:23:07.173 --> 00:23:11.634\nthis is why we have to manage this\nat the end of every single stage.\n\n397\n00:23:11.634 --> 00:23:16.559\nBut of course, ultimately, and these\nare the same criteria that we've got to\n\n398\n00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:20.453\ntailor, as that we've had to\ntailor in every other project.\n\n399\n00:23:20.453 --> 00:23:25.840\nUltimately, we have to tailor this\nparticular process to our needs and\n\n400\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.270\nto our project.\n\n401\n00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.385\nThis is not something that we\ncan just take out of a book and\n\n402\n00:23:31.385 --> 00:23:35.220\nplug-and-play, it has to\nbe tailored to our project.\n\n403\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:41.280\nSo what we've done here is that we've\ntaken a look at this sort of management of\n\n404\n00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.480\nthe boundary in between our stages.\n\n405\n00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.534\nAnd of course, we know we can\nhave as many stages as we want.\n\n406\n00:23:47.534 --> 00:23:50.152\nWhat we're gonna look at now, though,\n\n407\n00:23:50.152 --> 00:23:53.319\nis actually what we do at\nthe end of our projects.\n\n408\n00:23:53.319 --> 00:23:55.336\nSo now, in our next episode,\n\n409\n00:23:55.336 --> 00:23:59.720\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat how we close a project.\n\n410\n00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.582\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, I'm kind of interested\nto see your take on that as well,\n\n411\n00:24:02.582 --> 00:24:05.116\nbecause I've seen this kind\nof just been a, I don't know.\n\n412\n00:24:05.116 --> 00:24:08.292\nIt's almost like someone\nordered a package delivery,\n\n413\n00:24:08.292 --> 00:24:10.926\nthey came up,\nthrew it at the door, ran away,\n\n414\n00:24:10.926 --> 00:24:12.880\ndidn't even ring the door bell-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n415\n00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.878\n&gt;&gt; It was all kinds of bad.\n\n416\n00:24:13.878 --> 00:24:17.231\nSo I'm interested to see how you\ndo this in a more appropriate\n\n417\n00:24:17.231 --> 00:24:17.819\nmanner-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:24:17.819 --> 00:24:19.282\n&gt;&gt; And hopefully you do as well, but\n\n419\n00:24:19.282 --> 00:24:21.870\nfor now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n420\n00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.481\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n421\n00:24:24.481 --> 00:24:25.139\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n422\n00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:26.530\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n423\n00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:32.957\n[MUSIC]\n\n424\n00:24:32.957 -->

00:00:06.323\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:07.645\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:12.938\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Greeting everyone,\n\n6\n00:00:12.938 --> 00:00:15.780\nand welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.045\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.771\nAnd boy, you better buckle up because\nwe got more PRINCE2 2017 Foundation,\n\n9\n00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:21.805\ncoming at you.\n\n10\n00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:24.905\nAnd this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about, closing a project.\n\n11\n00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:29.087\nAnd here to make sure that we do it with\nall the appropriateness that it entails.\n\n12\n00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:30.455\nIs none other, than Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n13\n00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:33.650\nHow are you doing there, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great Justin,\n\n14\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.660\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic,\n\n15\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.286\nI'm actually interested in how i'm suppose\nto do this because I'm pretty sure I've\n\n16\n00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:44.137\ndone it wrong in the past, and seen it\ndone wrong in the past as I look in to\n\n17\n00:00:44.137 --> 00:00:46.257\nthe previous episode right at the end,\n\n18\n00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:50.018\nit's mostly been here you go you just\nthrow it and you run away right?\n\n19\n00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:53.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:58.501\nNo, no this is where I'm gonna get so\nfoaming and so tough.\n\n21\n00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.960\nAnd I'm gonna turn into my mother, almost.\n\n22\n00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.800\nNo, heaven help me.\n\n23\n00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.760\nNo, absolutely not!\n\n24\n00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.355\nNo!\n\n25\n00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:09.200\n[LAUGH] This is the bit, and\n\n26\n00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.660\nit doesn't matter what side of\nan imaginary fence you think you're on.\n\n27\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.470\nWhether you're a project manager or\nwhether you're a service manager,\n\n28\n00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.990\nI can tell you now this is\nthe one process, that causes so\n\n29\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.880\nmany arguments and\nthe well it's not just arguments.\n\n30\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.020\nIt's almost all out war.\n\n31\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.210\nAnd this is the process\nthat causes tension.\n\n32\n00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.040\nAnd this is the process that really can\nsplit an IT service provider in half.\n\n33\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.290\nIt can really divide teams.\n\n34\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.080\nAnd you know what?\n\n35\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130\nI don't care about personalities.\n\n36\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.550\nI'm not interested in that.\n\n37\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.560\nWhat I am interesting in though, is\ndelivering quality to our businesses and\n\n38\n00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.660\nto our customers.\n\n39\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.120\nAnd when we've got\na project management team,\n\n40\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.940\nthat is separate from\nthe service management team.\n\n41\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.840\nAnd we haven't got any\nsynergy between them.\n\n42\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.580\nAnd then unfortunately,\nthe customer does not receive quality.\n\n43\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.100\nAnd if they don't receive quality,\n\n44\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.980\ndo you know what,\nthey're gonna go somewhere else.\n\n45\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.870\nBecause quite frankly,\n\n46\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.600\nthey do not wanna get involved in whatever\ninternal issues are going on within IT.\n\n47\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.600\nAnd that's kind of my stern\ntalking-to you now, right?\n\n48\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.480\nIf I see anybody trying to throw a product\nover the fence to the service guys,\n\n49\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.410\nto the operational guys, I will be\nthe first one to shout and scream.\n\n50\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.470\nBecause that's not what\nwe should be doing.\n\n51\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.250\nWe don't want to encourage division.\n\n52\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.142\nWe don't wanna build a brick wall.\n\n53\n00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:43.570\nWe wanna encourage unity, and\nnow I sound like I'm preaching.\n\n54\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.190\nBut sometimes I feel like\nwe gotta preach this one,\n\n55\n00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.100\nbecause it doesn't happen often enough.\n\n56\n00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.161\nSee, look at him.\n&gt;&gt; So, I will tell you Jo, even though I\n\n57\n00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:59.910\nspeak in a fun manner to bring light,\nsome levity to a subject.\n\n58\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.819\nI will say I have been both on a team\nwhere there has been this kind of nice\n\n59\n00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.072\nintegrated feel, where you, okay I'm\nmaking sure that we know what's going on.\n\n60\n00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:13.180\nAnd everybody's kinda working together, to\nmake sure there's a seamless transition.\n\n61\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.680\nI have also been in a project or two,\nwhere it's just been like, here you go.\n\n62\n00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.817\nI go well what, I don't,\nwhat happened, what?\n\n63\n00:03:22.817 --> 00:03:29.380\nYou just kinda, it's like somebody\nblindfolded you, put you in a car.\n\n64\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.980\nAnd then drove me out to\nthe middle of nowhere and\n\n65\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.020\nsaid cool, we'll see you later.\n\n66\n00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.180\nAnd it's not a good feeling.\n\n67\n00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.800\nI don't think it's appropriate for\nanybody, it doesn't help the project.\n\n68\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.810\nIf this is your business and your goal is\nto deliver outside products to someone,\n\n69\n00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.150\nthis is a horrible way to do it because\nit's going to cause, as you said,\n\n70\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.360\na bunch of tension.\n\n71\n00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.320\nAnd it's funny, I feel like I'm\nnow getting a little [SOUND].\n\n72\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.801\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I noticed you were like,\n\n73\n00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:55.390\nlet's do this.\n\n74\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.540\nBut it infuriates me,\nbecause it doesn't help anybody.\n\n75\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.360\nIt actually frustrates me a great deal.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n76\n00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.140\nit doesn't matter what team\nit's sitting on, right?\n\n77\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.892\nIt doesn't matter whether I am\nadvising project managers, or\n\n78\n00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:09.449\nwhether I'm advising service managers.\n\n79\n00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:14.295\nThis is the area where I see the most\ntension, this is the area where I\n\n80\n00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:19.327\nsee the most conflict as well, and\nit's in this particular process.\n\n81\n00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:22.775\nAnd so, I mean, you've heard of DevOps.\n\n82\n00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:24.940\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; I have, and admittedly so\n\n83\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.378\nbeing a develop rat, I heard the term\nthrown around without fully-\n\n84\n00:04:29.378 --> 00:04:31.151\n&gt;&gt; This is like project products, right?\n\n85\n00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:35.900\nIt's just thrown.\n&gt;&gt; Without fully recognizing or\n\n86\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.410\nthinking about what that entails.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n87\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.950\n&gt;&gt; We say DevOps, a lot of people use that\n\n88\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.270\nterm to justify saying we're\ndevelopers who are now ops people.\n\n89\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.650\nAnd that's not what it means,\nI know that what it means but\n\n90\n00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.243\nI would say early on my career that's\nwhen people would tell me that, I go,\n\n91\n00:04:53.243 --> 00:04:57.990\nI guess I now have to deploy all this and\nmanage all this, not only develop it.\n\n92\n00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.570\nBut I know that's not what it is, but\nto make sure that I don't botch it up.\n\n93\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.443\nWell, you should tell us DevOps is.\n\n94\n00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:06.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm\n\n95\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.570\ngonna talk about something\ncalled early life support.\n\n96\n00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.320\nAnd I'm also gonna talk\nabout DevOps as well.\n\n97\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.020\nSo early life support is something\nwhere we've been working at this.\n\n98\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.940\nNow remember the PRINCE2 came out of\nthe UK government many years ago,\n\n99\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.520\nand so did itill and so\ndid many other frameworks as well.\n\n100\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.310\nSuch as MSP and\nportfolios of change and MOR.\n\n101\n00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.620\nAnd we've always had this concept\nof what we call early life support.\n\n102\n00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.970\nAnd early life support is simply the,\nwhen we deploy a project,\n\n103\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.490\nthen we transition it into\nthe live environment and\n\n104\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.470\nthe project team,\nyes do carry on with the support.\n\n105\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.017\nFor a determined period of time with,\nthe support of that\n\n106\n00:05:54.017 --> 00:05:58.770\nparticular product until it's\naccepted by the customer.\n\n107\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.883\nAnd it's at that point in time, when\nthe service level agreements are signed.\n\n108\n00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:04.820\nThey're not signed before that.\n\n109\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.120\nIt's at that point in\ntime when they're signed.\n\n110\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.340\nAnd that's when the operations\nteam will take over completely and\n\n111\n00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.910\nfully, the support for\n\n112\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.390\nthat particular service as they would\ncall it, or product, as we might call it.\n\n113\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.490\nThat's been around for years, and\nnobody's really taken any notice of it.\n\n114\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.050\nAnd what's happened is, we've now got the,\n\n115\n00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.510\nwe had a team of project\nmanagers not all that long ago.\n\n116\n00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.220\nBut within the last 10 years,\nhe sat there and said, you know what,\n\n117\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.550\nthis transition thing\njust doesn't help at all.\n\n118\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.780\nAnd what we're finding\nis it's not working, and\n\n119\n00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.190\nwe're finding is that we have got projects\nthat are being thrown over the fence.\n\n120\n00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.470\nI like it to, you mentioned\nsomething a little while ago.\n\n121\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.270\nIt's a bit like that package\nbeing left on your doorstep and\n\n122\n00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.180\nthe delivery guy is just running\noff as quickly as possible, and\n\n123\n00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.330\nthen your left with something and\nyou need to return it, or\n\n124\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.570\nyou've got an issue with it and\nyou don't know how to contact anyone.\n\n125\n00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.090\nIt's exactly the same as that, and a group\nof project managers got together and\n\n126\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.310\nsaid this has got to stop.\n\n127\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.220\nSo, what we've got to do is build better\nsynergy between our operations guys and\n\n128\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.690\nthe development guys.\n\n129\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.068\nAnd so what they.\n\n130\n00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:16.592\nI was gonna say what they created and\nit's not what they created,\n\n131\n00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:18.850\ncuz it's an evolution of\nthe early life support.\n\n132\n00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.876\nBut it's taking that concept of early life\nsupport and saying, we're one big team.\n\n133\n00:07:24.876 --> 00:07:30.510\nWe're all working together, and\nif we get our operations guys involved in\n\n134\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:36.280\nthe development of a project,\nthey may not necessarily be developers.\n\n135\n00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.990\nAnd we don't want them to be developers,\nbut they need to be,\n\n136\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.040\nthey're the one that\nare supporting the product.\n\n137\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.340\nSo they're the ones that need to say,\nokay but it's got to be supportable.\n\n138\n00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.430\nIt's got to sit on this platform.\n\n139\n00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.993\nThese are the types of questions.\n\n140\n00:07:49.993 --> 00:07:52.442\nOur users never remember their passwords.\n\n141\n00:07:52.442 --> 00:07:55.288\nSo can we come up with some\nalternative to passwords,\n\n142\n00:07:55.288 --> 00:07:57.197\nbecause they never remember them.\n\n143\n00:07:57.197 --> 00:08:02.170\nSo it means that our operations guys\nare involved in the development.\n\n144\n00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.210\nThey're specifically involved\nin the part of development\n\n145\n00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:12.790\nwhere we are defining and articulating\nwhat the end product should look like.\n\n146\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.350\nAnd then they're also involved,\nthen, in the testing.\n\n147\n00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.030\nBecause they're gonna be testing\nit from a user perspective,\n\n148\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.290\nas well as then involved in\nthe actual deployment itself.\n\n149\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.710\nBut then on the flip side, our development\nguys are involved in the support.\n\n150\n00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.240\nThey're performing that\nearly life support.\n\n151\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.340\nThey're involved in the picking up the\ntelephone when something goes wrong for\n\n152\n00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.710\na set period of time.\n\n153\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.660\nAnd so with our operations guys\nin that development arena,\n\n154\n00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.760\nthey're giving requirements,\nthey're giving service-level targets.\n\n155\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.140\nAnd they're saying to the developers,\nhey, this is what we need.\n\n156\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.600\nWe need you to develop something\nthat's going to deliver this.\n\n157\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.577\nAnd then from the other\nside of things as we move.\n\n158\n00:08:56.577 --> 00:09:00.652\nAnd this is the idea, is that it should\nbe a transition, it should be a move,\n\n159\n00:09:00.652 --> 00:09:02.310\nit should be seamless.\n\n160\n00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:08.680\nAs we move into the operating environment,\nthen the development guys are still there.\n\n161\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.340\nSo the customers have still got\nexactly the same contact details.\n\n162\n00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.720\nAnd the developers are working\nwith operations to sit there,\n\n163\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.930\nliterally on the service desk, and\nlook at whatever queries are coming in.\n\n164\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.300\nAnd, well, you never know.\n\n165\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.250\nWell, we didn't actually anticipate that\nthe users would be working in this way.\n\n166\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.150\nSo maybe we need to add\nan additional stage to this project.\n\n167\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.220\nMaybe we need to change something,\nbecause it's not quite working.\n\n168\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.080\nThe simple fact is, though,\nif this doesn't happen and\n\n169\n00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.790\nyou just leave the package on the doorstep\nand then run away really quickly,\n\n170\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.390\nyou could be left with something\nthat simply doesn't work.\n\n171\n00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:51.470\nAnd like I said just a little while ago,\nyou're gonna get, then, the customer,\n\n172\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:56.610\nthe business, your organization that's\nnot happy with what you've delivered.\n\n173\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.530\nGuess what?\n\n174\n00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.241\nNext time,\nthey're gonna go somewhere else.\n\n175\n00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:03.490\nAnd they might even go somewhere\nelse external for a product.\n\n176\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.090\nOr they might go somewhere else\nexternal for support, as well.\n\n177\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.900\nThey might go to somebody who's doing\nsoftware as a service and say, well,\n\n178\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.410\nwe're gonna use these guys because\nyou're not gonna talk to each other.\n\n179\n00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:21.780\nAnd so it does make me mad\nwhen I see that we still have\n\n180\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.420\nthat mentality of just\nthrowing it over the fence and\n\n181\n00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.400\njust hoping that it's not gonna\ncome back and bite you in the bum.\n\n182\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.590\nBecause it probably will.\n\n183\n00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.310\nAnd as a developer,\nyou must also see that it\n\n184\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:42.405\ndoesn't look too good on you when you've\njust thrown something over the fence and\n\n185\n00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:46.510\nran away.\n&gt;&gt; So I tried my best not to do that.\n\n186\n00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.980\nAnd I think something that you\nspoke to that illustartes the need.\n\n187\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.290\nBecause this is to some extent a mindset,\nalso.\n\n188\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.891\nCorrect me if I'm wrong.\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is,\n\n189\n00:10:54.891 --> 00:10:56.042\nthat's exactly what DevOps is.\n\n190\n00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:58.747\nIt's a mindset, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a mindset.\n\n191\n00:10:58.747 --> 00:11:01.552\nThere were so many times that I wished,\n\n192\n00:11:01.552 --> 00:11:05.632\nbecause we were interfacing\nwith other people, right?\n\n193\n00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:08.832\nI was like, I wish I could sit\ndown with their ops people,\n\n194\n00:11:08.832 --> 00:11:11.111\nwhere we're delivering this product.\n\n195\n00:11:11.111 --> 00:11:15.908\nBecause they're gonna be able to inform\nme early on in the product development.\n\n196\n00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:19.750\nHey, can I do this, is this possible?\n\n197\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:25.320\nI think that's where it would be so much\nhelp, this kind of co-mingling of ideas.\n\n198\n00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.070\nWhere I can inform an ops person,\nthis is what we wanna do,\n\n199\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.440\nthis is why we wanna do this.\n\n200\n00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.040\nAnd they can also give me some perspective\non, our platform doesn't support that.\n\n201\n00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.255\nOr you know what,\nthat's gonna be hard to maintain.\n\n202\n00:11:36.255 --> 00:11:41.053\nSo when I hear those, I'm like,\nthat would have been so nice.\n\n203\n00:11:41.053 --> 00:11:44.361\nLikewise, though, sometimes it\njust didn't play out that way, and\n\n204\n00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:47.720\nit was not a good experience for anybody.\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, and\n\n205\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.680\nit's funny because working with\none client that we have right now.\n\n206\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.950\nAnd they're going through something very,\nvery similar.\n\n207\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.690\nAnd as you say, they're saying that it's\nnot a very good experience for anybody.\n\n208\n00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.330\nAnd a lot of that is because they\nhaven't set out what they want.\n\n209\n00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.200\nAnd they haven't set out,\n\n210\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.980\nthe project team haven't set out what\nthey want from our support people.\n\n211\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.280\nAnd our support people don't really\nunderstand anything about a project.\n\n212\n00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.830\nAnd so there has to be some synergy, and\n\n213\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.370\nthere has to be some\nsort of melding of minds.\n\n214\n00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.180\nBut also an understanding\nbetween them of what each\n\n215\n00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.620\nparticular role should\ndo within the project.\n\n216\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.960\nIt's not a case of having somebody along\nsitting next to you in the project.\n\n217\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.470\nSort of over your shoulder,\nkind of doing the good cop,\n\n218\n00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.110\nbad cop routine on your shoulder.\n\n219\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.625\nThat's not what they're there for.\n\n220\n00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:35.204\nThey're there to contribute.\n\n221\n00:12:35.204 --> 00:12:38.442\nBut if they don't know what\nthey should be contributing,\n\n222\n00:12:38.442 --> 00:12:42.740\nthen you as a developer should know\nwhat sort of questions to ask them.\n\n223\n00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.955\nAnd it can work really well.\n\n224\n00:12:43.955 --> 00:12:48.826\nIt also gives the operations guys a huge,\nbig morale boost as well,\n\n225\n00:12:48.826 --> 00:12:50.740\nbelieve it or not.\n\n226\n00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.960\nBecause, I mean, can you imagine\nsitting on a service desk for eight,\n\n227\n00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:01.370\nnine hours a day,\nfive days a week for years on end?\n\n228\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.325\nYou're being shouted at constantly.\n\n229\n00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:05.550\nIt's sometimes good to get a break.\n\n230\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.310\nAnd I will always say to you if\nyou're managing a service desk.\n\n231\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.150\nYou need to be looking for\n\n232\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.890\nopportunities like this to actually\ntake your team members away.\n\n233\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:18.170\nAnd it makes them feel valued, because\ntheir opinions are being listened to.\n\n234\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.011\nYou look confused by that.\n&gt;&gt; No, sorry,\n\n235\n00:13:20.011 --> 00:13:24.363\nyou had said eight hours a day for\nmany years at a service desk.\n\n236\n00:13:24.363 --> 00:13:25.097\nAnd I was like,\n\n237\n00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:26.750\nI about had a panic attack.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.230\n&gt;&gt; But then I thought of something else.\n\n239\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:32.262\nWouldn't this also make your team as a\nwhole a lot more resilient to any kind of\n\n240\n00:13:32.262 --> 00:13:32.893\nwhoopsie?\n\n241\n00:13:32.893 --> 00:13:36.835\nLike I got sick, right, or\nsomething happened with my family,\n\n242\n00:13:36.835 --> 00:13:41.520\nsomeone could step up and be able to\nassist because we have worked together.\n\n243\n00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.390\nInstead of going, well, Justin was the\nonly one that knew anything about this.\n\n244\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:50.100\nHe's gone, he's out for\nnow, what are we gonna do?\n\n245\n00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:55.115\nResentment, frustration,\nor dissatisfaction on\n\n246\n00:13:55.115 --> 00:13:57.265\nthe level of the customer or the user.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n247\n00:13:57.265 --> 00:13:59.795\nit also means that what you've\ngot on the service desk or\n\n248\n00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:03.285\nin the support teams, you've got people\nthat understand something, as well.\n\n249\n00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:06.627\nSo when a query comes through\nconcerning that particular product,\n\n250\n00:14:06.627 --> 00:14:10.862\nthen you've got somebody that's able to\nturn around and say, hang on a minute.\n\n251\n00:14:10.862 --> 00:14:15.147\nI remember this because I remember getting\ninvolved in this particular discussion.\n\n252\n00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:18.167\nAnd the reason this\nhappened was because of X.\n\n253\n00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:23.837\nRather than making up a particular,\nmaking up an answer, potentially.\n\n254\n00:14:23.837 --> 00:14:30.150\nWhich is sometimes what could happen, is\nthat you want that person to be informed.\n\n255\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.805\nYou wanna have informed people\non the service desk and\n\n256\n00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.285\nin the support environment.\n\n257\n00:14:34.285 --> 00:14:36.050\nAnd you know what?\n\n258\n00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.930\nThis really promotes this.\n\n259\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:44.646\nSo in terms of closing a project,\nwhich is where we are right now,\n\n260\n00:14:44.646 --> 00:14:50.141\nthis process has to happen\non condition that the early\n\n261\n00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:56.390\nlife support and\nDevOps has happened before this.\n\n262\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:01.047\nSo we have to have a transition period,\nnot a handover.\n\n263\n00:15:01.047 --> 00:15:05.110\nI don't want to hear that word,\nnot a throwing over the fence.\n\n264\n00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.234\nWe have to have a transition period.\n\n265\n00:15:08.234 --> 00:15:12.856\nAnd after that transition period, that's\nwhen, at the end of early life support,\n\n266\n00:15:12.856 --> 00:15:14.038\nas I've mentioned.\n\n267\n00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:17.525\nThat's when we're sitting down\nwith the user and saying, okay,\n\n268\n00:15:17.525 --> 00:15:21.839\nthese acceptance criteria, are you okay\nwith all of these acceptance criteria?\n\n269\n00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:26.020\nAnd that happens at the end\nof the early life support.\n\n270\n00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.793\nSo the purpose of closing a project is,\nat the end of that then,\n\n271\n00:15:30.793 --> 00:15:36.478\nto provide that point at which the\nacceptance of the product is confirmed.\n\n272\n00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:40.048\nSo as it says on the screen\nin front of you right now,\n\n273\n00:15:40.048 --> 00:15:43.953\nrecognizing that the objectives\nhave been achieved and\n\n274\n00:15:43.953 --> 00:15:47.460\nthat the project has\nnothing more to contribute.\n\n275\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.390\nI think we've got an issue.\n\n276\n00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.506\nI've got an issue with my teeth today,\nI think.\n\n277\n00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:53.239\nThat's what it is.\n\n278\n00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:56.550\nWe also close a project when\nthings aren't going quite right or\n\n279\n00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.310\nmaybe then when there's no longer\na need for that particular project.\n\n280\n00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.607\nSo some projects are closed\nprematurely as well.\n\n281\n00:16:04.607 --> 00:16:09.034\nSo yes we have the project closure which\nis the typical project closure at the end\n\n282\n00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:13.540\nof early life support but we also have\nprojects that are closed prematurely too.\n\n283\n00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.801\n&gt;&gt; And that's encompassed by that or\n\n284\n00:16:16.801 --> 00:16:18.984\nthat the project has\nnothing more to contribute.\n\n285\n00:16:18.984 --> 00:16:19.565\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n286\n00:16:19.565 --> 00:16:21.469\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that little phrase,\n\n287\n00:16:21.469 --> 00:16:24.289\nimplicitly that means you\nmay be able to cut that\n\n288\n00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:25.174\noff.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n289\n00:16:25.174 --> 00:16:27.169\n&gt;&gt; You're like hey, this doesn't work for\n\n290\n00:16:27.169 --> 00:16:30.762\nus, this viability is no good anymore.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, exactly,\n\n291\n00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:34.927\nexactly it really is about sort\nof contributing to the, well,\n\n292\n00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:38.420\nto the requirements of the organization.\n\n293\n00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.770\nSo here you'll see then we've got our\npurple diagram from our prince two book.\n\n294\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:48.560\nAnd in the closing of project activities,\nwell, we're preparing either planned or\n\n295\n00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.870\npremature closures as we just mentioned.\n\n296\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.620\nWe're handing over the products.\n\n297\n00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:58.620\nIn other words, this is where we're\nsaying okay, you signed off on this.\n\n298\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.880\nIs everything okay?\n\n299\n00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.320\nSo when we say hand over, that doesn't\nmean we throw over the products.\n\n300\n00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.920\nWhat it means is, we say,\nright, am I good to go now?\n\n301\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.480\nAm I good to leave?\n\n302\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.139\nIs everything okay?\n\n303\n00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:16.685\nOkay, and then, what we'll do is,\nwe'll have a lessons learned\n\n304\n00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:20.760\nexercise where we evaluate\nthe efficiency of the project.\n\n305\n00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.400\nAnd we recommend that\nthe executive close the project.\n\n306\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.640\nSo we have to make sure that\nthe user is happy as we say.\n\n307\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.650\nWe have to make sure that\neverything is working smoothly.\n\n308\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:37.620\nAnd so reviewing the performance\nof the actual product\n\n309\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.830\nis something that should be done\nas part of early life support,\n\n310\n00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.110\nincluding ensuring the host\nsite is able to support.\n\n311\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.500\nAll of these should be done\nin the early life support.\n\n312\n00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.930\nBut now what we're going to do is\nwe're going to close the project.\n\n313\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:58.890\nAnd we're going to review the project for\nperformance and for efficiency.\n\n314\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.550\nAnd assess the benefits\nhave been realized.\n\n315\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:10.000\nSo we are going to prepare for the planned\nclosure by updating the project plan,\n\n316\n00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.139\nby getting that signed off, and\nreleasing the project resources.\n\n317\n00:18:15.139 --> 00:18:18.837\nIn other words, all of these people that\nwe've got, that have been working for us,\n\n318\n00:18:18.837 --> 00:18:21.970\nthat have been doing development and\nthen doing that hand over.\n\n319\n00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:25.100\nThen we're going to release those people.\n\n320\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.640\nAnd this is exactly the same, by the way.\n\n321\n00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.970\nIf we have a premature closure,\nwe're going to release records.\n\n322\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.960\nWe're going to update the project plan.\n\n323\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.940\nBut the one thing that we're also going\nto do is agree to recover anything that,\n\n324\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.010\nwell, we may have got rid of.\n\n325\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.329\nSo sometimes, we brought in a project,\n\n326\n00:18:44.329 --> 00:18:49.060\nas part of bringing in that project\nwe're going to retire something else.\n\n327\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.600\nWell, if we prematurely close the project,\nin other words,\n\n328\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.930\nwe decide that the project\nis no longer viable,\n\n329\n00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:59.420\nthen we might have to bring back\nsomething that we thought about retiring.\n\n330\n00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.700\nSo that's part of the premature closure.\n\n331\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:08.980\nAnd then, we want to have a formal\nhand over of the product.\n\n332\n00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.360\nThat's that formal.\n\n333\n00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.110\nIs everything okay?\n\n334\n00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.430\nAre you happy?\n\n335\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.390\nHave you got any questions at all?\n\n336\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.830\nIs it okay if I hand this over to support?\n\n337\n00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:24.475\nOkay, and then we also want to ensure,\nand this bottom one's quite important.\n\n338\n00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:28.640\nCuz the other's fairly self-explanatory,\nbut consulting the change control\n\n339\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.060\napproach, are change management\nokay to sign this off as well?\n\n340\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.110\nThis is not just about whether\nthe customer is okay to sign it off, but\n\n341\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.960\nwhat about change management?\n\n342\n00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.039\nAre they okay that everything\nhas been delivered as stated?\n\n343\n00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.590\nAnd then we go back, and\nwe evaluate the project itself.\n\n344\n00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.500\nThis is where we conduct\na lessons leaned exercise.\n\n345\n00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.777\nSo we review the project for\n\n346\n00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:59.522\nwhat we have delivered against what\nwe said we were going to deliver.\n\n347\n00:19:59.522 --> 00:20:04.807\nAnd we create a report where we will\nreview what's been delivered and\n\n348\n00:20:04.807 --> 00:20:07.550\nalso review how things went, too.\n\n349\n00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:09.920\nCreating lessons learned,\n\n350\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.110\nwho's not gonna benefit?\n&gt;&gt; I think that would benefit everybody.\n\n351\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.420\n&gt;&gt; At this point in time,\n\n352\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.210\nwe're looking to do this for\nfuture projects and for other\n\n353\n00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.080\nprojects that are ongoing right now that\ncould learn from any of those lessons.\n\n354\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.710\nSo it is still important that we do this.\n\n355\n00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.934\nI've heard of a lot of people and\na lot of organizations who've said, no,\n\n356\n00:20:28.934 --> 00:20:30.632\nwe don't bother at the end of a project.\n\n357\n00:20:30.632 --> 00:20:35.210\nBecause we've got nothing else to\nlearn in that particular project.\n\n358\n00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.210\nAnd I say, okay, maybe not in that\nparticular project, but you got plenty\n\n359\n00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:44.040\nto learn for another project.\n&gt;&gt; Man, that would make me really nervous.\n\n360\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.212\nWe have nothing further to learn.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n361\n00:20:46.212 --> 00:20:48.664\n&gt;&gt; I got to find another job, no.\n\n362\n00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:50.901\nThat's what that would tell me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n363\n00:20:50.901 --> 00:20:55.170\nI've got plenty to learn but\nfrom probably somewhere else, right?\n\n364\n00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:00.150\nYeah, the lessons learned is so\nimportant, so important.\n\n365\n00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.500\nAnd then what we'll do is,\n\n366\n00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.230\nwell, we want to communicate\nthat this project is all over.\n\n367\n00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:10.260\nThat's something else that I've\nseen people shy away from as well.\n\n368\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:15.320\nCommunicate in the project\nis being completed and\n\n369\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.730\nnow the project team is being\ndisbanded because everybody's happy.\n\n370\n00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:20.881\nThat's that email that you get.\n\n371\n00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:23.440\nYou know when a parcel's been\ndumped on your doorstep and\n\n372\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.852\nthen you get this email\nsaying it's been delivered.\n\n373\n00:21:25.852 --> 00:21:28.558\nAnd you're the one sitting there\ngoing yeah, but it doesn't work.\n\n374\n00:21:28.558 --> 00:21:32.370\nIt's that, right?\n&gt;&gt; Or it's not even mine.\n\n375\n00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.890\nYou gave me the wrong one,\nor something like that.\n\n376\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:39.340\nNow, that's physical parcels but-\n&gt;&gt; No, but that's exactly why\n\n377\n00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.561\npeople don't like to do this\ncommunication because it's that kind of,\n\n378\n00:21:43.561 --> 00:21:45.580\nyou're adding visibility to it.\n\n379\n00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.400\nYou're saying hey, look,\nyou've got it now, right?\n\n380\n00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.590\nAnd you're okay.\n\n381\n00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:55.490\nAnd you're opening the door up to\ncriticism, or you're opening the door up\n\n382\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:01.100\nto any sort of feedback, and\nthat's what a lot of people don't want.\n\n383\n00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.870\nBut if you've gone through this early life\nsupport, if you've gone through the whole\n\n384\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:10.890\nsort of dev ops, then telling somebody\nright, well I'm walking away right now.\n\n385\n00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.050\nWell, that's okay though.\n\n386\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.460\nJust turn around and say, yeah, okay then,\n\n387\n00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:17.480\nyeah, bye.\n&gt;&gt; On the flip side of that,\n\n388\n00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.150\nit's funny because I know people who are,\nI don't want them to come back,\n\n389\n00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.950\nbut really, again, that goes back\nto what do you have to learn?\n\n390\n00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.670\nYour feedback is where\nyou gain intelligence\n\n391\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.587\nabout how you've performed.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n392\n00:22:30.587 --> 00:22:31.925\n&gt;&gt; So communicating that,\n\n393\n00:22:31.925 --> 00:22:33.560\nI always welcome feedback.\n\n394\n00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.368\nI've worked with some individuals who\nare like, they just kinda sit there, and\n\n395\n00:22:37.368 --> 00:22:38.098\nkinda tuck in.\n\n396\n00:22:38.098 --> 00:22:44.626\nI'm like, but I can't get better, we\ncan't get better, unless we have actual,\n\n397\n00:22:44.626 --> 00:22:48.020\nreliable, and honest feedback.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n398\n00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.350\n&gt;&gt; And maybe that feedback is\n\n399\n00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.840\nthis transition was not a good one, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n400\n00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.270\n&gt;&gt; So we need to reevaluate how\n\n401\n00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:56.970\nwe're doing this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, exactly that, exactly.\n\n402\n00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.860\nAnd so we have to elicit feedback.\n\n403\n00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.560\nCommunication is a two way process and\n\n404\n00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.860\nwe've got to make sure\nthat we elicit feedback.\n\n405\n00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.500\nBut people that run away from doing\nthe communication, invariably it's because\n\n406\n00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.670\nthey know that the lessons learned,\nprobably being quite extensive, right?\n\n407\n00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.082\nThere's a lot to learn,\nwe could have done a lot better.\n\n408\n00:23:16.082 --> 00:23:20.429\nPart of this as well though is\nalso to close off any logs and\n\n409\n00:23:20.429 --> 00:23:23.290\nany documentation too.\n\n410\n00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.060\nWe do not delete anything.\n\n411\n00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.370\nDon't wanna hear about\nyou burning evidence.\n\n412\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.320\nDon't look at me like that.\n\n413\n00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.714\nI've heard this before.\n&gt;&gt; This is not what we mean by a burn down\n\n414\n00:23:34.714 --> 00:23:36.432\nchart, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, no, exactly no.\n\n415\n00:23:36.432 --> 00:23:38.162\n&gt;&gt; Let me make a list of all of the things\n\n416\n00:23:38.162 --> 00:23:40.424\nI need to destroy,\nput through the shredder.\n\n417\n00:23:40.424 --> 00:23:41.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah,\n\n418\n00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:43.560\nno, this is not what we do.\n\n419\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.700\nWe archive the documentation.\n\n420\n00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.362\nWe may wanna go back to\nthis at some point in time.\n\n421\n00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:52.130\nThere's gonna be a huge amount of\ndocumentation produced as part of\n\n422\n00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.430\nevery project, but you know what?\n\n423\n00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.769\nThis is what knowledge management is for.\n\n424\n00:23:55.769 --> 00:23:59.972\nIt's to ensure that that documentation\nis saved somewhere, it's archived.\n\n425\n00:23:59.972 --> 00:24:04.614\nWe might actually want To use it at\nsome point in time in the future, and\n\n426\n00:24:04.614 --> 00:24:08.652\nthen we prepare a draft closure\nnotification for the board.\n\n427\n00:24:08.652 --> 00:24:12.761\nWho do you think actually signs\noff on a project, and says, yes,\n\n428\n00:24:12.761 --> 00:24:17.879\nit's definitely closed?\n&gt;&gt; Here you go with these questions\n\n429\n00:24:17.879 --> 00:24:22.477\nthat I don't know anything about.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's cuz I'm mean\n\n430\n00:24:22.477 --> 00:24:23.947\nyou know.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n431\n00:24:23.947 --> 00:24:25.360\nwe're recommending a project closure.\n\n432\n00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.987\nThe actual closure would be you have to\nsign off, would it be the project board?\n\n433\n00:24:29.987 --> 00:24:30.730\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n434\n00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.227\nIt's the project board, but\nthey would never, or should never,\n\n435\n00:24:34.227 --> 00:24:36.927\nsign off on a project for,\nwell, for two reasons.\n\n436\n00:24:36.927 --> 00:24:41.786\nThey shouldn't sign off a project unless\nthe customer has agreed that they're\n\n437\n00:24:41.786 --> 00:24:46.501\nhappy with everything, or where a project\nhas been prematurely closed, and\n\n438\n00:24:46.501 --> 00:24:49.112\nif a project has been prematurely closed,\n\n439\n00:24:49.112 --> 00:24:52.590\nthen obviously that would be\ndown to the project board.\n\n440\n00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.030\nBut again, there's got to have\nbeen a reason for it, and\n\n441\n00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.630\nthat reason should be documented, and\n\n442\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.940\ntherefore it should be kept in the sort\nof the lessons learned review, and\n\n443\n00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.296\nalso should be archived appropriately,\nalong with the rest of the documentation.\n\n444\n00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:08.350\nEven when a project's\nbeen prematurely closed,\n\n445\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.500\nyou never, ever, want to get rid\nof that documentation at all.\n\n446\n00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.330\nNow, the last thing that I\nwant to talk about is, and\n\n447\n00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:22.702\nthis is the last thing as far as\nour series is concerned as well,\n\n448\n00:25:22.702 --> 00:25:26.340\nis that, just like everything else,\n\n449\n00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:31.790\nwe've got to tailor our project closure\nto meet the needs of the organization.\n\n450\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.120\nBut one thing I've got to\ntell you about tailoring, and\n\n451\n00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.730\nyou'll see exactly the same criteria here\nas you have done in any other process,\n\n452\n00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.092\nbut the one thing I've got to tell you\nabout tailoring, tailoring does not mean\n\n453\n00:25:43.092 --> 00:25:46.333\nremoving early life support, or\nremoving that dev ops environment.\n\n454\n00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.547\nTailoring does not mean well in an\norganization we just through the project\n\n455\n00:25:51.547 --> 00:25:54.010\nover the fence, and\nthen run as quickly as we can.\n\n456\n00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.170\nThat's not tailoring,\nthat's called bad practice.\n\n457\n00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.487\nIt's certainly [LAUGH]\nnot called best practice.\n\n458\n00:25:59.487 --> 00:26:01.340\nSo, I don't ever want to see that.\n\n459\n00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.940\nI never want to go into an organization\nand for them to say, yes,\n\n460\n00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.970\nwell this is the way we do this.\n\n461\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:11.319\nBecause, I can tell you now, I've been to\nso many organizations where I turn around\n\n462\n00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:14.809\nand said, no, this is not the way\nthat you should be doing this, and\n\n463\n00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:18.572\nthis is the way that we recommend for\nyou to actually close off a project.\n\n464\n00:26:18.572 --> 00:26:20.560\nYou do not simply throw it over the fence.\n\n465\n00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.020\nSo tailoring should not involve that.\n\n466\n00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.999\nNow, that's real life,\na real world practical example there, but\n\n467\n00:26:26.999 --> 00:26:31.060\nthat's also something that you have\ngot to plan for your test as well.\n\n468\n00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.490\nSo, talking about your test.\n\n469\n00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:40.780\nIt's at this point in time where we\nhave reached the conclusion of all of\n\n470\n00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:46.560\nour sort of the instructional\nepisodes to do with PRINCE2,\n\n471\n00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.170\nand so certainly with our\nfoundation series, and so\n\n472\n00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:55.170\nwhat we're going to do now, we are going\nto come back for some future episodes, but\n\n473\n00:26:55.170 --> 00:27:00.740\nin our subsequent episodes we're going\nto be looking at the sample paper.\n\n474\n00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.619\nNow, available as part of your\ndownloadable material is a sample exam\n\n475\n00:27:05.619 --> 00:27:06.204\npaper.\n\n476\n00:27:06.204 --> 00:27:10.455\nThis is the official sample exam paper.\n\n477\n00:27:10.455 --> 00:27:13.300\nSo what do you remember about the exam,\nJustin?\n\n478\n00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.588\n&gt;&gt; It is 60 question, you get 60 minutes.\n\n479\n00:27:15.588 --> 00:27:20.907\nYou gotta get, I wanna say,\nwait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n480\n00:27:20.907 --> 00:27:22.791\nYou gotta get 33 of them right or\n\n481\n00:27:22.791 --> 00:27:24.121\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n482\n00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:25.651\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta get a 55%, I think,\n\n483\n00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:26.447\nyou said?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n484\n00:27:26.447 --> 00:27:30.654\nyou gotta get 33 right in order to be\nable to pass your PRINCE2 Foundation.\n\n485\n00:27:30.654 --> 00:27:34.913\nSo now's your chance to\ntake the sample paper,\n\n486\n00:27:34.913 --> 00:27:40.130\ndownload it,\nit's in your downloadable materials, and\n\n487\n00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:46.950\nwhen we come back in our next episode we\nare going to go over the sample paper.\n\n488\n00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:51.040\nNow it's gonna take more than one episode,\nbecause we've got 60 questions, and\n\n489\n00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.740\nthat's quite a lot.\n\n490\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.680\nSo, come back, join us again, and we'll\ntake a look at that sample paper, and\n\n491\n00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.590\nwe'll make sure that you are prepared for\n\n492\n00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.210\nyour test.\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, I do have one question.\n\n493\n00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.509\nAm I gonna be in those episodes,\nor is that gonna be all you?\n\n494\n00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:07.295\n&gt;&gt; Boy, I don't know, I don't know.\n\n495\n00:28:07.295 --> 00:28:09.253\nShould we make Justin take the test,\n\n496\n00:28:09.253 --> 00:28:11.932\nthis is the question.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I guess everybody will\n\n497\n00:28:11.932 --> 00:28:13.978\nhave to stay tuned to find out.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n498\n00:28:13.978 --> 00:28:14.945\n&gt;&gt; But if I'm not,\n\n499\n00:28:14.945 --> 00:28:18.828\nI wish you the best of luck, and\nhopefully it all works out for you.\n\n500\n00:28:18.828 --> 00:28:20.717\nJo is gonna lead the way.\n\n501\n00:28:20.717 --> 00:28:23.087\nI'll be a bystander even if I am here.\n\n502\n00:28:23.087 --> 00:28:25.547\nBut, for right now,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n503\n00:28:25.547 --> 00:28:28.351\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been you host Justin Dennison.\n\n504\n00:28:28.351 --> 00:28:29.407\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n505\n00:28:29.407 --> 00:28:31.235\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n506\n00:28:31.235 --> 00:28:37.408\n[MUSIC]\n\n507\n00:28:37.408 --> 00:28:40.504\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:14.220\nMy name is Jo Peacock.\n\n4\n00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.580\nI'm your host and also your guide for\nthis particular prints to foundation exam.\n\n5\n00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.400\nAnd that's exactly what\nwe're going to be doing,\n\n6\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.820\nis we're going to be looking at\nthe PRINCE2 foundation exam.\n\n7\n00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.750\nNow by now,\nI am hoping that you have completed all of\n\n8\n00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.465\nthe episodes in our PRINCE2 series and\nyour ready to start your test.\n\n9\n00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:38.465\nBut before we do that,\n\n10\n00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:42.245\nI wanna give you a little bit of an\noverview of what the test is going to be\n\n11\n00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:47.745\nlike, give you a little bit of an overview\non the test conditions as well.\n\n12\n00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:50.580\nAnd just prepare you for the test.\n\n13\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.470\nSo the first thing that I'm going to\ntell you to do is to download all\n\n14\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.280\nof the materials.\n\n15\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.740\nAnd hopefully you've already done that.\n\n16\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.860\nSo you've downloaded the PDF that comes\nalong with this particular class.\n\n17\n00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.410\nAnd there are 3 PDF's that\ncome along with the series,\n\n18\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.730\nyou have your course PDF which\nis the Powerpoint slides.\n\n19\n00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.780\nYou also have your sample paper and\n\n20\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.620\nthen you have the answers to\nyour sample paper as well.\n\n21\n00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.110\nSo these are the PDF's that\ncome along with the course.\n\n22\n00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.460\nNow I know that you've downloaded your\nsample paper because that's what we're\n\n23\n00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.690\ngoing to start and go over in this\nparticular sort of mini series, so\n\n24\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.080\nnow you're ready to do your test.\n\n25\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.670\nWell what is the test going to be like?\n\n26\n00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.630\nWell the first thing that you have\nto do is you have to request,\n\n27\n00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.640\nyou have to tell us that you're ready for\nyour test.\n\n28\n00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.500\nAnd you'll request an exam voucher.\n\n29\n00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.890\nNow, the exam voucher, you will be able to\nrequest that on the peoplecert website.\n\n30\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.900\nYou simply log onto peoplecert.org and\nyou are able then to book an exam.\n\n31\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.780\nAnd you can book your prints two\nfoundation exam by telling the,\n\n32\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.370\nby completing the form with all\nyour details and by simply stating,\n\n33\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.710\nI was going to say telling,\nbut it doesn't sound as good.\n\n34\n00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.490\nBy stating that you have\nsat your course with us.\n\n35\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.430\nAnd at that point in time,\nthey will reach out to us and\n\n36\n00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.670\nconfirm that you have actually\nwatched all of the episodes.\n\n37\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.400\nSo yes, that's something that It's part\nof the exemplary requisites that you have\n\n38\n00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.430\nactually spent some time with me and with\nJustin as well, cuz we did have Justin\n\n39\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.510\nhere too, to review all of\nthe requirements for the exam.\n\n40\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.060\nNow one of the things that I'm going\nto recommend that you do as well\n\n41\n00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.330\nprior to doing this is and I know that\nI've done it throughout the actual\n\n42\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.960\nthroughout our episodes is I'm gonna\nrecommend that you get this, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.830\nYou're going to need this for\nyour PRINCE2 practitioner anyway, but\n\n44\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.810\nI would recommend this as well prior\nto taking your PRINCE2 foundation.\n\n45\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.020\nIt's a really useful book,\nreally, really useful.\n\n46\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.850\nI mean in 2017 version of prints to has\nbeen written away that actually very\n\n47\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.560\nsimple, very straight forward, with lots\nof full of points, lots of hints and\n\n48\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.860\ntips and lots of guidance to help you with\nPRINCE2 in your natural environment and\n\n49\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.040\nthen also, help you to audio test tape.\n\n50\n00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.980\nSo, once you've completed all of this and\nyou have filled out their forms ready and\n\n51\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.170\nyou have paid the exam [INAUDIBLE],\nwhat will happen is they will ask you for\n\n52\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.700\na convenient date and time for your exam.\n\n53\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.150\nYou can pick a date and\n\n54\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.070\ntime that is convenient for you,\ncompletely convenient for you.\n\n55\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.930\nI can tell you now that people are sort of\nreally flexible, they're based in Europe.\n\n56\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.140\nBut that doesn't include\nthe exam times at all.\n\n57\n00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.460\nYou can pick a time that really is,\nI mean,\n\n58\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.420\nI've seen exams on Saturday mornings,\nI've seen exams, you know, during the day,\n\n59\n00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.470\non Sundays, but In the past I've also\nseen exams in an evening, now of course,\n\n60\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.630\nI mean that's completely\nrelative to where you are.\n\n61\n00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.270\nSo me saying, Saturdays and Sundays and\n\n62\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.370\nwhatever, that's relative to\nwhere you are in the world.\n\n63\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.510\nSo obviously,\nthat's going to make a difference.\n\n64\n00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.190\nBut there is a widespread,\n\n65\n00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.000\nthere's a plethora of times that\nare available for your test.\n\n66\n00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.330\nThere's a few prerequisites for the test.\n\n67\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.100\nOne is that you must have a PC\nwith a camera, because you have\n\n68\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.670\nto be able to be proctor or invigilator,\nwhatever, you want to call them.\n\n69\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.900\nThe invigilator has to look at you and\n\n70\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.790\nhas to observe you during\nthe examining process.\n\n71\n00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.210\nSo you must have a camera and it either\nmust be attached to the laptop, you know.\n\n72\n00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.320\nMost of them are nowadays they're a part\nof the laptop or it must be an independent\n\n73\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.210\ncamera that again [INAUDIBLE] your\ntest has to sit on your screen.\n\n74\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.730\nThere are a few other\nrequirements as well.\n\n75\n00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.780\nBearing in mind these requirements\nbefore you go into your test,\n\n76\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.570\nbecause the last thing you want\nto do is go into the test and\n\n77\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.110\nfind out you don't have\na suitable environment.\n\n78\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.040\nYou've got to be in a room by yourself.\n\n79\n00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.372\nUnless requirement number one.\n\n80\n00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:06.950\nThat room come have any windows.\n\n81\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.910\nOr if it has co-windows and\nthe curtains must be closed.\n\n82\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.240\nThere is a reason for this.\n\n83\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.530\nWe don't want anybody\nseeing your test paper.\n\n84\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.095\nWe don't want anybody looking over\nyour shoulder because once they live\n\n85\n00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:23.605\nquestions in a live database,\nget out in the big wild world and\n\n86\n00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:27.345\nget into the Internet then we have\nto remove it from our database.\n\n87\n00:05:27.345 --> 00:05:31.145\nThat means that we have to write\nnew question for the exam.\n\n88\n00:05:31.145 --> 00:05:36.020\nSo obviously we put protective\nover our materials.\n\n89\n00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.190\nSo, you can't be overlooked for start.\n\n90\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.760\nYou can't have anybody else in the room.\n\n91\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.960\nThat means no animals, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.370\nUnless you have a dog that is there for\na specific\n\n93\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.360\nreason, like a guide dog for\ninstance, although obviously,\n\n94\n00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.970\nyou know, I don't think that they're gonna\nhelp by barking out the questions for you.\n\n95\n00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.530\nBut unless you have a service animal with\nyou and you can demonstrate that that\n\n96\n00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.030\nis a service animal then you won't be\nallowed any animals in the room either.\n\n97\n00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.680\nNothing that can disrupt you.\n\n98\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.940\nNothing that's going to interfere\nwith you taking the test.\n\n99\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.330\nSo, that means no telephones on your desk.\n\n100\n00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.760\nNo other computers on your desk, nothing\nthat can access the internet in that room.\n\n101\n00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.110\nAnd nothing, especially at foundation\nbecause this is a closed book test,\n\n102\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.500\nso nothing related to PRINCE2 or service\nmanagement at all anywhere in the room or\n\n103\n00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.780\non your desk, I quite often get people ask\nme whether they can do the test at work.\n\n104\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.970\nAnd yes, you can do the test at work but\nyou have to make sure that you're in\n\n105\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.750\nan office with no windows or\nthat there's a blind at the window,\n\n106\n00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.620\nthat you cannot be disturbed and\nthat you're not going to be disturbed.\n\n107\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:56.390\nAnd it has to be sort of an office that's\ndevoid of any IT stuff on the walls,\n\n108\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.090\nthat sort of thing as well.\n\n109\n00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.730\nSo you know, if you want to do it,\nI have had one person say to me,\n\n110\n00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.890\ncan I do it in the bathroom?\n\n111\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.230\nAnd I've said, sure.\n\n112\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.440\nThat's probably a really good place to do\nit, as long as you've got good internet\n\n113\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.200\nconnection, cuz you know you're not\ngoing to be disturbed there and\n\n114\n00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.770\nyou know that you've got nothing\non the walls around there or\n\n115\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.150\nat least I should hope not, right?\n\n116\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.080\nSo, you wanna make sure that\nthe environment is just you, you alone.\n\n117\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.930\nAnd that there's nothing on your desk.\n\n118\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.880\nNow, what about this?\n\n119\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.740\nSure, you can have coffee.\n\n120\n00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.670\nAll right, nobody is gonna say you can't\nhave a coffee or a tea at your desk or\n\n121\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.500\nanything to drink.\n\n122\n00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.360\nYou can have whatever you want.\n\n123\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.330\nYou can have sweets, candy whatever\nyou want to call it if you want to.\n\n124\n00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.050\nBut its only an hour, so you know,\n\n125\n00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.670\nI wouldn't have thought that you might\nneed anything during that period and time.\n\n126\n00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.500\nPen and paper.\n\n127\n00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.830\nNo.\n\n128\n00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.000\nOkay?\nYou cannot write anything down,\n\n129\n00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.230\nagain its down to that protecting\nmaterial in that we don't want\n\n130\n00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.650\nanything written down that could\nthen be taken away from the room.\n\n131\n00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.510\nAgain, so, yeah, nothing to write with.\n\n132\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.550\nYou don't need to write anything.\n\n133\n00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:14.110\nYou will need to have your driving\nlicense or some form of ID with you.\n\n134\n00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.930\nAnd I'll tell you why a little bit later.\n\n135\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.250\nBut its the only thing you'll need for\nyour test is a PC and\n\n136\n00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.780\nyour driving license.\n\n137\n00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.810\nOr a form of a ID, a government issued\nform of ID, by the way, not just\n\n138\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:33.450\nsomething that you knocked up five minutes\nago and then laminated it quickly, okay?\n\n139\n00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.190\nIt has to be government issued.\n\n140\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.370\nAnd it has to have your name and\nyour address on there as well.\n\n141\n00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.790\nAnd a photograph.\n\n142\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.650\nIt can't just be something that just\nprinted off without any photograph.\n\n143\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.470\nWe need to know that it's\nyou taking the test and\n\n144\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.210\nthat you haven't paid somebody\nelse to do it for you.\n\n145\n00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.280\nAlthough why you'd want\nto do that I don't know.\n\n146\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.910\nIf you go through this\nparticular series and\n\n147\n00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.710\nyou've actually go through\nlearning all of the material,\n\n148\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.420\nwhy would you want somebody else\nto take your test for you, right?\n\n149\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.480\nSo now you're ready to take your test.\n\n150\n00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.430\nWell just before you do that,\nthey're going to send you a link.\n\n151\n00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.350\nAnd that link is a link to\nsome downloadable software.\n\n152\n00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.990\nIt's called ExamShield.\n\n153\n00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.830\nYou're going to have to\ndownload that onto your PC.\n\n154\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.520\nNow I've already said that you\nneed to have a camera on your PC.\n\n155\n00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.290\nYou really need to have a PC or\n\n156\n00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.000\na laptop that you\nare the administrator over.\n\n157\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.210\nBecause you have to download\nthis software and it has to run.\n\n158\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.960\nSo, you know, using your home personal\nPC is probably your best bet, okay.\n\n159\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.060\nIt's gonna be really difficult,\n\n160\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.630\nby the way, you cannot take\nthis test over a VPN either.\n\n161\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:52.140\nThe test has to be taken on sort\nof a directly connected network.\n\n162\n00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.210\nSo, it is going to be easier for\nyou to take it at home.\n\n163\n00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.635\nMy personal recommendation\nis take it at home.\n\n164\n00:09:56.635 --> 00:10:00.605\nDon’t take it at the office\nunless you absolutely have to,\n\n165\n00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:02.920\njust try and find a suitable time.\n\n166\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.050\nIt’s an hour long.\n\n167\n00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.590\nTo take it at home somewhere quiet.\n\n168\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.770\nBut don't do it in your living room.\n\n169\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.180\nDon't do it in a open room.\n\n170\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.440\nIt needs to be somewhere\nwhere you can close the door\n\n171\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.550\ncuz they will insist on\nyou closing the door.\n\n172\n00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.460\nWhat I would do personally with this exam\nshield software is a couple of days before\n\n173\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.980\nyour test download the software and\nmake sure that it works.\n\n174\n00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.830\nyou can delete it again if you want to\nafterwards but download the software,\n\n175\n00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.650\nmake sure that it works.\n\n176\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.576\nAnd then 15 minutes before your exam,\n\n177\n00:10:34.576 --> 00:10:39.857\nyou're going to log on and\nwhen the proctor, the inviduator,\n\n178\n00:10:39.857 --> 00:10:45.450\ncomes online she will ask you or\nhe will ask you to show them your ID.\n\n179\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.180\nThey will need to see your photo ID and\n\n180\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.210\nno you can't blank anything out and you\ncan't hold your finger over everything.\n\n181\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.230\nThey want to prove, this is a government\nID, this is a government test,\n\n182\n00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.980\nyeah, this is a test that's\nan officially recognized tests and\n\n183\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.690\ntherefore, [LAUGH] we need to prove\nthat it's you taking the test.\n\n184\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.600\nSo you will need to hold your\nID like this up to the camera,\n\n185\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.850\nto demonstrate that it is actually\nyou that's taking the test.\n\n186\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.520\nAnd then the individuator will\nask to look around the room and\n\n187\n00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.760\nat that point in time you\nneed to use your laptop or\n\n188\n00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.900\nyour camera and literally turn it\naround and scan around the room.\n\n189\n00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.570\nThat's so that they can see that there\nisn't anything around that could help you\n\n190\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.665\nwith the test, that you haven't\ngot anything on your desk.\n\n191\n00:11:33.665 --> 00:11:36.415\nLike a cellphone that you\nhaven't got another PC,\n\n192\n00:11:36.415 --> 00:11:39.875\nthat you don't have anything\nthat can access the internet.\n\n193\n00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:43.425\nAnd to make sure that there's nobody\nthat could look over your shoulder and\n\n194\n00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:45.555\nno one hiding underneath\nyour desk as well.\n\n195\n00:11:46.775 --> 00:11:50.965\nAnd then once you put your\nlaptop back down then they will\n\n196\n00:11:50.965 --> 00:11:54.315\nask you if you have any questions and\nthey'll tell you what you need to do.\n\n197\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:00.570\nNow if you're listening to\nthe invigilator through headphones\n\n198\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.740\nit will ask you to take them out and\nthat's because somebody could\n\n199\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.530\nbe giving you instructions over\nthat headset or that headphones.\n\n200\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.320\nSo they will ask you to remove it.\n\n201\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.740\nBut they will ask you to keep your\nmicrophone on at all during the test.\n\n202\n00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.690\nOne of the things that they\nwant to check [LAUGH] is that\n\n203\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.390\nyou're not reading questions out loud.\n\n204\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.730\nAnd they're gonna watch to make sure that\nyou're not reading questions out loud.\n\n205\n00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.540\nAnd this is why they ask you\nto leave your microphone on.\n\n206\n00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:32.375\nThe other thing that this\nExamShield software will do,\n\n207\n00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:37.405\nthis ExamShield software gives them\naccess to see the controls on your PC.\n\n208\n00:12:37.405 --> 00:12:42.135\nAnd so they will be able to tell if you've\ngot your microphone turned down to a low\n\n209\n00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:47.175\nvolume, then they're going to ask you\nto turn it up to a higher volume so\n\n210\n00:12:47.175 --> 00:12:49.135\nthat they can hear you and so\n\n211\n00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:52.285\nthat they can hear what else is\ngoing on in the background as well.\n\n212\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.210\nSo at this point time and\nnow you've downloaded the material.\n\n213\n00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.740\nYou've downloaded the ExamShield software.\n\n214\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.130\nYou have logged on at your allotted\ntime or fifteen minutes beforehand.\n\n215\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.680\nAnd you've spoken to your invigilator and\nthey've looked around the room and\n\n216\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.440\nthey've asked you to\nremove your headphones.\n\n217\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.800\nOnce you've done all of this.\n\n218\n00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.100\nThen they will ask you if\nyou're ready to start the test.\n\n219\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.470\nAnd they will display\nthe exam in front of you.\n\n220\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.280\nIt's at that point in time\nwhen the clock will start.\n\n221\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.030\nNow you know that you've got 60 questions.\n\n222\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.670\nYou've got an hour to\nanswer every question.\n\n223\n00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.220\nAnd you have to get 33 right.\n\n224\n00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.000\nIn order to pass.\n\n225\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.240\nIt's closed book but to be perfectly\nhonest that is actually quite fortuitous.\n\n226\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:46.720\nBecause, let's face it,\n60 questions in 60 minutes.\n\n227\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.870\nThat's a minute per question,\n\n228\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.805\nyou're not going to have time to be\nthumbing through a book in that time.\n\n229\n00:13:51.805 --> 00:13:56.670\nAnswer with your gut instinct, remember\nthe acronym I gave you during one of\n\n230\n00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:06.139\nthe episodes, a couple of the episodes\nRTFQ, right, read the full question.\n\n231\n00:14:06.139 --> 00:14:11.590\nDon't answer what you think is being\nasked, answer what is being asked of you.\n\n232\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.160\nDon't try and interpret\na question read it word for word,\n\n233\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.830\nread the full thing, read the full answer.\n\n234\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.090\nAnd answer what is being asked not\nwhat you think is being asked.\n\n235\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.850\nYou don't have to answer them\nin chronological order, right?\n\n236\n00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.790\nOr numerical order.\n\n237\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.660\nYou don't have to go one through to 60.\n\n238\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.290\nYou don't have to do that but\nwhat you could do is you could say.\n\n239\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.030\nWell you know what I don't know number\none offhand I'll skip that one.\n\n240\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.000\nI don't know number two,\nI'm gonna skip that one.\n\n241\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.610\nI don't know number three.\n\n242\n00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:48.730\nAnd go through until you find one that\nyou do know and then start from there.\n\n243\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.240\nIt's perfectly acceptable.\n\n244\n00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.210\nIt'll get you in the right frame of mind.\n\n245\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.130\nJust remember that you do have to go\nback and you won't have a pen and paper.\n\n246\n00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.180\nTo be able to make note of\nthe ones that you skipped.\n\n247\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.790\nSo it's really important to\nensure at the end of the test\n\n248\n00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.870\nthat you have answered\nevery single question.\n\n249\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.460\nYou don't get any negative marks for\ngetting one wrong, but\n\n250\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.930\nobviously, if you don't answer one, then\nyou're not gonna get it right, are you?\n\n251\n00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:21.720\nSo, once you have finished, answering your\npaper, once you finished with everything,\n\n252\n00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.300\nthen at that point in time, you click on\nsubmit in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n253\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.100\nThat's when the invigilator\nwill come back on line.\n\n254\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.160\nYou won't believe it, but they have\nbeen there, watching it the whole time.\n\n255\n00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.700\nThey will come back on line and\nthey would say, are you sure,\n\n256\n00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.180\nthat you definitely want\nto submit your text?\n\n257\n00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:39.905\nAnd you say.\n\n258\n00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:41.830\nYes.\n\n259\n00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.640\nAnd at that point in time then there\nwill be a few minute delay, but\n\n260\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.320\nat that point in time\nthe screen will disappear.\n\n261\n00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.310\nAnd after a couple of minutes or so you\nwill get, the invigilator will lead you.\n\n262\n00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.920\nAnd then you will get,\n\n263\n00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.500\non that particular screen it will tell\nyou whether you have passed or failed.\n\n264\n00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.950\nThat is a preliminary result,\nit is not your definitive result.\n\n265\n00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.700\nIt is not your certificate.\n\n266\n00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.930\nIt's just the preliminary result.\n\n267\n00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.550\nIt's just going to tell you\nwhether you passed or failed.\n\n268\n00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.840\nSo you don't know how many you've got.\n\n269\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.200\nBut you know how well you got on.\n\n270\n00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.650\nA couple of days later, it's usually\nabout three to four days later,\n\n271\n00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.360\nyou're gonna get an email.\n\n272\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.790\nSo make sure when you register that you\nput the right email address in there.\n\n273\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.170\nBecause a few days later you're gonna get\nan email telling you what your result was.\n\n274\n00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.780\nThat is your official confirmation that\nyou have either passed or failed, that.\n\n275\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.490\nThe preliminary result is not your\nofficial confirmation because that\n\n276\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:45.680\npreliminary result doesn't,\nwell it hasn't been independently marked.\n\n277\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.600\nIt hasn't been looked at independently and\n\n278\n00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.990\nthat is just an automated response as\nto the, what you've actually selected.\n\n279\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.260\nSo it has to be independently proctored.\n\n280\n00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.490\nIt has to be looked at again before\nyou actually are given your results\n\n281\n00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.910\nI mentioned your email\naddress is really important.\n\n282\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.840\nI would always recommend that you use\na personal email address and not your work\n\n283\n00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.200\nemail address because it's important\nthat it doesn't go to your junk file.\n\n284\n00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.810\nYou wouldn't believe how many people had\ntheir exam results pass through to their\n\n285\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.410\njunk file and then they've emailed me and\nsaid I can't find my exam result.\n\n286\n00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.340\nAnd I say well I've had it.\n\n287\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.590\nAnd that reminds me, there are only two\npeople in the world that will actually\n\n288\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:33.690\nknow your test result, one is you and\n\n289\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:38.130\nthe other person is the person that\nyou listed as your instructor for\n\n290\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.920\nyour course,\nwhich obviously happens to be me.\n\n291\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.340\nSo you will need to\nmake a note of my name.\n\n292\n00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:50.210\nBecause you have to have sat a class or\nin this case a series.\n\n293\n00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:54.270\nYou have to have watched this\nseries with an accredited trainer.\n\n294\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.530\nSo you will need to use my name.\n\n295\n00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.170\nAnd the only two people in the world who\nget to find out what your results are you\n\n296\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.940\nand me and that's it.\n\n297\n00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:01.840\nNobody else.\n\n298\n00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.520\nAnd if your manager ever tries to contact\nme to ask me what your results were?\n\n299\n00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.040\nTrust me, with GDPR data protection,\nno, we're not allowed to do that.\n\n300\n00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.850\nAnd there's absolutely no way that\nwe would do that ethically, anyway.\n\n301\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.560\nSo really, you're the only\nperson that gets your result.\n\n302\n00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.980\nYou will get the certificate and\nyour certificate is downloadable,\n\n303\n00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.820\nagain, as PDF.\n\n304\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.370\nAnd it will just simply\nsay that you have passed.\n\n305\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:32.850\nThey will not say what your result it's\njust that you have been successful but\n\n306\n00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.820\nthen you have achieve this\nparticular qualification.\n\n307\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:43.800\nSo that's it really, that's your exam\nthat's what is going to be like.\n\n308\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:50.860\nSo, what we gonna do now, is I know\nyou've already sat your sample paper and\n\n309\n00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.270\nin our next episode then\nwe gonna come back and\n\n310\n00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:58.420\nwe're gonna start to look over the sample\npaper that you've already taken.\n\n311\n00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.330\nAnd hopefully,\nyou will found it really, well.\n\n312\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.418\nReflective of what the subjects that\nwe've actually covered during our series.\n\n313\n00:19:08.418 --> 00:19:15.150\nSo come back into our part two and\nwe will see you for our exam review.\n\n314\n00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.882\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.928\nour PRINCE2 2017 version Foundation Test.\n\n4\n00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:20.609\nI'm Jo Peacock, I'm your host and\nyour guru I think,\n\n5\n00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.650\nyour guide through your sample paper,\nand so\n\n6\n00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.820\nhopefully by now you've had a change\nto take a look at the sample paper.\n\n7\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.140\nAnd what we're going to do is we're going\nto go through every single question,\n\n8\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.300\nwell one by one.\n\n9\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.390\nSo let's get going then shall we,\nand let's take a look and\n\n10\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.520\nour first look at question number 1.\n\n11\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.498\nWhich statement about controls is CORRECT?\n\n12\n00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:47.110\nWell, let's take a look at them, shall we?\n\n13\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.840\nA highlight report is\nan event-driven report, is it?\n\n14\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.480\nActually no, a highlight report is,\nwell it's something\n\n15\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.140\nthat we produce on a regular basis, so\nit's time-driven, not event-driven.\n\n16\n00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.550\nException report is time driven?\n\n17\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.737\nWell, no, we produce an exception\nreport when something has happened,\n\n18\n00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:10.651\nan exception so, therefore,\nit is event driven.\n\n19\n00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:11.990\nAnd a daily log?\n\n20\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.200\nWell, if it's daily then that's suggests\nto me that it is time driven, so,\n\n21\n00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.050\nno, the answer here is D.\n\n22\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.745\nA checkpoint report is\na time-driven control.\n\n23\n00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:26.416\nOkay because checkpoints\nhappen at regular checkpoints\n\n24\n00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:30.119\nat regular times throughout a stage, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.904\nSo which document then,\nmoving on to number 2 is used to identify\n\n26\n00:01:34.904 --> 00:01:39.960\ninterested parties that need to be\ninformed of project disclosure?\n\n27\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.685\nRTFQ, that's one of my favorite acronyms,\nand it really applies in this one, okay.\n\n28\n00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:51.420\nWhich document is used to identify?\n\n29\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.690\nThis is not which document communicates,\nit's asking you which document do\n\n30\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.500\nwe use to identify who we're\ngoing to communicate to?\n\n31\n00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.551\nRead the full question, and so which\ndocument is gonna use to communicate?\n\n32\n00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:15.560\nWell any project closure, well,\nhow do we identify those people?\n\n33\n00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.017\nWe identify those people in our\ncommunication management approach.\n\n34\n00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:24.379\nWe certainly wouldn't identify who we're\ngoing to talk to in a change control\n\n35\n00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.504\napproach, not for project closure.\n\n36\n00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:31.128\nAnd we certainly wouldn't identify who\nwe're going to communicate to in an end of\n\n37\n00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:33.120\nproject report.\n\n38\n00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.160\nNo, because there's an assumption\nthere that that report is going to be\n\n39\n00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.762\ncommunicated to somebody.\n\n40\n00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:43.022\nSo that's not the right answer and D the\nproject brief yet again we should already\n\n41\n00:02:43.022 --> 00:02:47.469\nknow who we're gonna communicate to before\nwe've outlined the project brief, and\n\n42\n00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.860\nthat happens right at\nthe beginning of the project.\n\n43\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.058\nSo the answer there is C, so\nwhat about number 3 then?\n\n44\n00:02:56.058 --> 00:03:00.200\nIdentify the missing words\nin the following sentence.\n\n45\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.746\nAny change to the products\nagreed at the start of the stage\n\n46\n00:03:06.746 --> 00:03:11.711\nis monitored as part of what\nprocess on a day to day basis?\n\n47\n00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:16.870\nSo any change to products that\nare agreed at the start of the stage,\n\n48\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.330\nis monitored as part of what process?\n\n49\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.215\nWell, we know that controlling a stage,\n\n50\n00:03:24.215 --> 00:03:30.100\nthat process actually monitors\nprojects on a day to day basis.\n\n51\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.540\nWhat about directing a project?\n\n52\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.322\nWell, directing the project is very,\nvery high level.\n\n53\n00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:41.463\nAnd that's the project board,\nisn't it, that directed the project.\n\n54\n00:03:41.463 --> 00:03:46.320\nSo monitoring,\nthat's a little bit too detailed for them.\n\n55\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.100\nManaging a state boundary, well that's\nabout looking at the end of one stage and\n\n56\n00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.405\nthen planning for the next stage.\n\n57\n00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:57.890\nAnd that's not monitoring,\nthat's the authorization to proceed.\n\n58\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.601\nAnd closing a project is when we say,\nyes, the project is definitely closed and\n\n59\n00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:07.101\nhas met all the acceptance criteria and\nthe customer has signed off on it, so\n\n60\n00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:09.098\nthat's not monitoring either.\n\n61\n00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:11.560\nSo, it is B, controlling a stage.\n\n62\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.912\nSo question number 4 then,\nwhich two statements\n\n63\n00:04:16.912 --> 00:04:21.746\nabout continued business\njustification are correct?\n\n64\n00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:26.150\nSo let's see what makes sense, and\nwhat I tend to do with these particular\n\n65\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.844\ntypes of questions,\nI want to go down one through to four, and\n\n66\n00:04:29.844 --> 00:04:32.790\nI want to put a tick\nnext to the right ones.\n\n67\n00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.094\nAnd a cross next to the ones\nI believe to be wrong and\n\n68\n00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:39.647\npossibly a question mark\nif I don't know the answer.\n\n69\n00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:46.426\nSo, which two statements about\ncontinued justification are correct?\n\n70\n00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:50.550\nNumber 1, should the business\njustification for a project be documented?\n\n71\n00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.730\nWell I should think so most definitely.\n\n72\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.294\nSo I'm going to put a tick next to that.\n\n73\n00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:58.459\nNow immediately I know that number one is\ncorrect then now I can eliminate B and\n\n74\n00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:00.280\nC straightaway.\n\n75\n00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.368\nSo I know that the answer is either A or\nD.\n\n76\n00:05:04.368 --> 00:05:06.280\nSo let me look at number 2.\n\n77\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.510\nIs the project manager responsible for\nthe business justification?\n\n78\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.279\nNo, it's not the project manager, is it?\n\n79\n00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.501\nThe person responsible for\nthe business justification well,\n\n80\n00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:21.620\nit's actually at the executive level,\nit's most senior than that.\n\n81\n00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.046\nSo I don't agree with that one, but\nI'm gonna put a question mark against it.\n\n82\n00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:29.100\nI'm not even gonna look at number 3,\nand do you know why?\n\n83\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.810\nCuz I've eliminated B and C,\nso it all hinges on either A,\n\n84\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.383\nwhich is 1 and 2, or D, which is 1 and 4.\n\n85\n00:05:37.383 --> 00:05:41.886\nSo let me see whether number 4 is correct\ncuz I was a little bit unsure about\n\n86\n00:05:41.886 --> 00:05:42.620\nnumber 2.\n\n87\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.359\nSo number 4 is compulsively projects\nstill required business justification,\n\n88\n00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:48.200\nabsolutely.\n\n89\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.220\nEvery project requires\nbusiness justification so\n\n90\n00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.570\nthat means, then my answer is D, 1 and 4.\n\n91\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.086\nSo let's take a look at number 5 then.\n\n92\n00:06:00.086 --> 00:06:05.150\nNow bear in mind it might seem to you that\nwe are rushing through these questions.\n\n93\n00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.703\nBut trust me, we've got one\nminute per question in your test.\n\n94\n00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:13.901\nAnd so whilst I'm giving a little bit\nof an explanation with each particular\n\n95\n00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:17.574\nquestion, you'll realize that\nactually there is enough time for\n\n96\n00:06:17.574 --> 00:06:20.370\nyou to be able to go\nthrough each question.\n\n97\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.118\nRead the full question and\nstill answer it in that minute, okay?\n\n98\n00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:28.674\nPRINCE2 mandates,\nthat means it's compulsory,\n\n99\n00:06:28.674 --> 00:06:33.859\nthat the project board represents\nprimary stakeholder interests, okay?\n\n100\n00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:36.450\nSo which principle does this follow?\n\n101\n00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.049\nIs it managing by stages\nlet's read that again,\n\n102\n00:06:41.049 --> 00:06:46.489\nmandates that the project board\nrepresents primary stakeholder interests.\n\n103\n00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.380\nWell, managing by stages isn't\nabout stakeholder interests.\n\n104\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.275\nFocusing on products doesn't seem to\nbe about stakeholder interests either.\n\n105\n00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:59.531\nDefined roles and responsibilities, that's\nabout defining who our stakeholders are,\n\n106\n00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:04.060\nand what their responsibilities are,\nin other words, what their interests are.\n\n107\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.059\nIt looks like C to me, but let's just\neliminate D to be on the safe side, and\n\n108\n00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:09.788\nD is learning from experience.\n\n109\n00:07:09.788 --> 00:07:15.070\nAgain, that doesn't represent stakeholder\ninterests so the answer there is C.\n\n110\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.822\nSo when do we confirm\nwhether an objective,\n\n111\n00:07:19.822 --> 00:07:22.819\nthe project's objectives\nhave been achieved?\n\n112\n00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.175\nWell that makes sense to me to be doing\nthe close in a project process so\n\n113\n00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:28.234\nthat would be A.\n\n114\n00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:34.240\nBut let's check that the, well let's\ncheck that they the others aren't valid.\n\n115\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.030\nSo during the final end stage assessment,\nthe final end stage assessment,\n\n116\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.610\nwe are assessing the end\nstage has gone okay.\n\n117\n00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.711\nWe still have to have\na closing the project process,\n\n118\n00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:53.848\nto close out the project formally,\nit's not assessing a stage.\n\n119\n00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:58.527\nSo, it's not B, well, it's not D,\ncuz that's assessing the stage,\n\n120\n00:07:58.527 --> 00:08:01.160\nwell, that's controlling the stage.\n\n121\n00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.613\nSo that's not part of delivering\nthe project's objectives either,\n\n122\n00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:10.227\nit's part of project closure, and\nduring managing product delivery?\n\n123\n00:08:10.227 --> 00:08:13.764\nNo, because yet again,\nit's part of project closure, so\n\n124\n00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:16.257\nwe'd already ascertained that it was A.\n\n125\n00:08:16.257 --> 00:08:19.343\nWe knew that, but\nwe were just eliminating the others, and\n\n126\n00:08:19.343 --> 00:08:21.950\nwe know now that the others\nare definitely wrong.\n\n127\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.292\nSo let's take a look at\nquestion number 7 then.\n\n128\n00:08:25.292 --> 00:08:31.657\nWhich statement correctly describes\nproject assurance and quality assurance?\n\n129\n00:08:31.657 --> 00:08:36.550\nProject assurance provides assurance\nto the project stakeholders.\n\n130\n00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.773\nWhereas quality assurance\nprovides assurance to\n\n131\n00:08:39.773 --> 00:08:43.921\nthe wider corporate program or\ncustomer organization, okay?\n\n132\n00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:46.986\nYeah, I'm quite happy about\nthat project assurance.\n\n133\n00:08:46.986 --> 00:08:51.017\nProvides assurance to the project\nstakeholders that the project is\n\n134\n00:08:51.017 --> 00:08:52.200\ngoing okay.\n\n135\n00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.138\nAnd quality assurance,\nremember, quality is perceived,\n\n136\n00:08:55.138 --> 00:08:57.162\nbut quality is required by the business.\n\n137\n00:08:57.162 --> 00:09:01.902\nSo quality assurance provides\nassurance to the organization, yeah,\n\n138\n00:09:01.902 --> 00:09:06.806\non quality of the product, I'm happy\nwith A, but let's take a look at B.\n\n139\n00:09:06.806 --> 00:09:11.919\nB says they are both the responsibility\nof the project board,\n\n140\n00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:15.850\nbut project assurance may be delegated.\n\n141\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.197\nProject assurance, that's\nthe assurance of the entire project,\n\n142\n00:09:19.197 --> 00:09:20.735\nthat it's meeting the needs.\n\n143\n00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:24.860\nThat it's doing what it's supposed to do,\nthe entire project.\n\n144\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.224\nThat doesn't sound to me like that's\nsomething that should be delegated\n\n145\n00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:29.588\naway from the project board.\n\n146\n00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:31.780\nSo I don't like that statement, C,\n\n147\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.100\nare both independent of\nthe project management team.\n\n148\n00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.827\nWell, you've got to manage these,\nhaven't you?\n\n149\n00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:41.600\nIf the answer makes you laugh,\nthen it's probably the wrong answer, okay?\n\n150\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.801\nIf it makes you chuckle, then it's\nthe wrong answer, and what about D then?\n\n151\n00:09:45.801 --> 00:09:50.675\nProject assurance and quality assurance\nare both the responsibility of corporate\n\n152\n00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:53.340\nprogram management or the customer.\n\n153\n00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.117\nWhy on earth would we give project\nassurance to the customer?\n\n154\n00:09:57.117 --> 00:10:01.590\nIt doesn't make any sense at all,\nso the answer here is A.\n\n155\n00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.264\nSo let's take a look at number 8,\nthe number 8,\n\n156\n00:10:07.264 --> 00:10:11.828\nidentify the missing words\nin the following sentence.\n\n157\n00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:14.381\nIf a baseline product, baseline product,\n\n158\n00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:19.005\nthat means that we understand what the\nproduct is that we're going to deliver.\n\n159\n00:10:19.005 --> 00:10:20.563\nWe've got our baseline.\n\n160\n00:10:20.563 --> 00:10:25.261\nIf it requires modification,\nthe recommended something procedure or\n\n161\n00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:28.787\nequivalent procedure should be used.\n\n162\n00:10:28.787 --> 00:10:30.600\nWell, that's subject to change control,\nisn't it?\n\n163\n00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.472\nIf it's been baselined and\nwe know what we're supposed to deliver.\n\n164\n00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:36.620\nIf there is any other\nchanges to that delivery,\n\n165\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.142\nthen it's got to be subject to change\ncontrol, and therefore issue management.\n\n166\n00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:46.903\nBecause we know that we refer to changes\nas issues within project management.\n\n167\n00:10:46.903 --> 00:10:51.577\nSo whilst risk management may play a part\nin this, we will have to evaluate risk,\n\n168\n00:10:51.577 --> 00:10:54.370\nbut that's part of change control.\n\n169\n00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.729\nAn exception management is not\nan exception, nothing has gone wrong,\n\n170\n00:10:58.729 --> 00:11:01.718\nnothing has been found\nduring the development.\n\n171\n00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:03.550\nAnd quality control?\n\n172\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.005\nNo, it's not about quality,\n\n173\n00:11:06.005 --> 00:11:10.735\nthis is about changes to requirements,\nso the answer is C.\n\n174\n00:11:10.735 --> 00:11:14.335\nSo according to the manage by\nexception principal, in other words,\n\n175\n00:11:14.335 --> 00:11:16.020\nwe don't want to micromanage.\n\n176\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.353\nWhat should be defined to establish\nlimits of delegated authority?\n\n177\n00:11:21.353 --> 00:11:27.210\nShould it be the scope, the costs,\nthe time scales, or the tolerances?\n\n178\n00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.724\nWell, I would say most definitely it\nshould be the tolerances because it's\n\n179\n00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:33.497\nabout establishing limits.\n\n180\n00:11:33.497 --> 00:11:37.400\nAnd it is most definitely D,\nno tolerances.\n\n181\n00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.808\nSo let's look at 10, then.\n\n182\n00:11:39.808 --> 00:11:44.175\nWhich two statements are correct\nabout the minimum requirements for\n\n183\n00:11:44.175 --> 00:11:46.390\napplying the change theme?\n\n184\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.218\nNow, I've already told you once before,\nokay?\n\n185\n00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:53.533\nWhat we do is we just go down number 1,\n2, 3, and 4, and we put a tick or\n\n186\n00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:56.824\na cross next to the ones that\nwe think are right or wrong.\n\n187\n00:11:56.824 --> 00:12:01.461\nSo, which of these then are the correct\nabout the minimum requirements for\n\n188\n00:12:01.461 --> 00:12:03.235\napplying the change theme?\n\n189\n00:12:03.235 --> 00:12:05.090\nMinimum requirements.\n\n190\n00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.559\nIdentified issues must be assessed for\n\n191\n00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:11.463\ntheir impact on the business\njustification for the project.\n\n192\n00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:13.213\nIs that a requirement for\nthe change theme?\n\n193\n00:12:13.213 --> 00:12:17.022\nAbsolutely, yes, we have to understand for\n\n194\n00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:20.840\nany particular change to the requirements.\n\n195\n00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.643\nThen we have to understand what\nthe impact is to the organization and\n\n196\n00:12:23.643 --> 00:12:25.427\nthe impact to the business requirements.\n\n197\n00:12:25.427 --> 00:12:30.680\nIn other words, the impact to the project,\nso yes, that's got to be a requirement.\n\n198\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.517\nProject issues.\n\n199\n00:12:32.517 --> 00:12:36.258\nWe know that that's what we call changes,\nmust be captured, examined, and\n\n200\n00:12:36.258 --> 00:12:38.460\nmanaged throughout the project life cycle.\n\n201\n00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.094\nWell, that makes sense to me so\nI'm going to go with yes on that one.\n\n202\n00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:45.995\nSo number 3, the actual status\nof products must be verified\n\n203\n00:12:45.995 --> 00:12:50.810\nin order to ensure that this\nmatches the authorized state.\n\n204\n00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:56.734\nHm, that doesn't make sense to me at all,\nnot to do with change control anyway.\n\n205\n00:12:56.734 --> 00:13:00.974\nWe're talking about change control and\nthen we're talking about the status of\n\n206\n00:13:00.974 --> 00:13:04.770\nproducts must be verified,\nverified against what?\n\n207\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.767\nTo ensure that it matches\nthe authorized state.\n\n208\n00:13:06.767 --> 00:13:11.400\nWe're talking about changes, we're talking\nabout planning something different.\n\n209\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.945\nThat's what we're talking about,\nso that doesn't make any sense.\n\n210\n00:13:13.945 --> 00:13:17.147\nA budget must be established to pay for\nrequests for\n\n211\n00:13:17.147 --> 00:13:22.050\nchange and their analysis, no,\nthat's part of the project budget.\n\n212\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.184\nWe have to have some contingency\nin our project budget,\n\n213\n00:13:25.184 --> 00:13:29.263\nright up front we must have added in\nsome contingency to pay for changes.\n\n214\n00:13:29.263 --> 00:13:33.950\nIf there are any changes, and a budget\nmust be established to pay for requests.\n\n215\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.350\nWell, not all changes are requests,\n\n216\n00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.725\nthey're maybe because of exceptions and\nproblems.\n\n217\n00:13:39.725 --> 00:13:42.468\nSo number 4 is not\nnecessarily true either.\n\n218\n00:13:42.468 --> 00:13:46.130\nAnd certainly, as I said,\nnot all changes are requests,\n\n219\n00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.630\nso therefore, the answer's got to be 1 and\n2, and there we go.\n\n220\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.850\nA is our answer for number 10.\n\n221\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:58.649\nSo number 11 then, the purpose\nof a control in a stage process?\n\n222\n00:13:58.649 --> 00:14:02.500\nWell, is it to agree, perform,\nand deliver project work?\n\n223\n00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.639\nI'd be all right with the perform and\ndeliver if it wasn't for\n\n224\n00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:11.700\nthe fact that it'd be controlling\nthe stage doesn't agree anything.\n\n225\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.408\nOkay, we're just controlling a stage,\nwhat about number 2?\n\n226\n00:14:15.408 --> 00:14:18.122\nTo draft a plan for the next stage, no,\n\n227\n00:14:18.122 --> 00:14:23.575\nthat's in managing stage boundaries,\nand agrees tolerances for the stage.\n\n228\n00:14:23.575 --> 00:14:28.460\nAgain, that would be in managing\nstage boundaries for the next stage.\n\n229\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.973\nSo to take actions so that the sage\nremains within tolerance, yeah,\n\n230\n00:14:31.973 --> 00:14:34.285\nthat's controlling the stage, isn't it?\n\n231\n00:14:34.285 --> 00:14:36.210\nSo the answer there is D.\n\n232\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.689\nWhat is likely to be avoided by applying\n\n233\n00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:46.425\nthe tailor to suit the project principle?\n\n234\n00:14:46.425 --> 00:14:51.190\nSo what are we going to avoid\nthen if we tailor things?\n\n235\n00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.062\nAre we going to avoid\nunnecessary management effort?\n\n236\n00:14:54.062 --> 00:14:57.670\nI should hope so, I mean,\nthat's the whole idea of tailoring.\n\n237\n00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.561\nSo that we meet the needs of\nthe organization and therefore,\n\n238\n00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:02.667\nwe don't have to micromanage everything.\n\n239\n00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:06.260\nAre we going to avoid project risks?\n\n240\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.741\nNo, because some risks\nwe just want to accept,\n\n241\n00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:11.543\nwe don't necessarily want\nto avoid them all anyway.\n\n242\n00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:13.310\nAre we going to avoid training?\n\n243\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:18.719\nAbsolutely not, [LAUGH], although I know\na lot of people would have liked it,\n\n244\n00:15:18.719 --> 00:15:21.897\nbut no, we're not going to avoid training.\n\n245\n00:15:21.897 --> 00:15:27.497\nProcurement procedures, no, we're not\ngoing to avoid procurement procedures.\n\n246\n00:15:27.497 --> 00:15:32.360\nWe have to follow procurement procedures\nwhenever we're procuring anything.\n\n247\n00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.804\nSo the only thing that we're going to\navoid then is unnecessary management\n\n248\n00:15:36.804 --> 00:15:40.056\neffort, I'm all right with that,\nthat makes sense.\n\n249\n00:15:40.056 --> 00:15:45.320\nSo what about the number 13, what is the\nresponsibility of the team manager role?\n\n250\n00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.207\nWell, we know that the responsibility of\nthe team manager is to manage the team\n\n251\n00:15:50.207 --> 00:15:51.475\nwithin the stages.\n\n252\n00:15:51.475 --> 00:15:55.559\nSo is there a way to accept authorized\nwork packages in the project manager?\n\n253\n00:15:55.559 --> 00:16:00.956\nDefinitely, that's right, is their job\nto review the highlight report for\n\n254\n00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:04.020\nthe previous reporting period?\n\n255\n00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.450\nNo, that will be the project manager,\nokay.\n\n256\n00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.809\nIs their work to or their job to\nreview the tailoring approach and\n\n257\n00:16:10.809 --> 00:16:13.647\nits applications for project controls?\n\n258\n00:16:13.647 --> 00:16:17.688\nNo, cuz if we're controlling a project\nthen that's part of the project board.\n\n259\n00:16:17.688 --> 00:16:21.404\nIt will be between the project manager and\nthe project board.\n\n260\n00:16:21.404 --> 00:16:23.280\nIs their job to examine and\n\n261\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.383\nescalate issues taking\nnecessary corrective actions.\n\n262\n00:16:27.383 --> 00:16:33.676\nIs their job to examine and\nto escalate issues, issues are changes.\n\n263\n00:16:33.676 --> 00:16:38.125\nSo if we're examining changes and were\nescalating and that's something that's\n\n264\n00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:41.941\ndone as part of the controlling a project,\nor controlling the stage.\n\n265\n00:16:41.941 --> 00:16:44.971\nSo that's actually part of\nthe project manager's role.\n\n266\n00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:49.439\nSo the responsibility of the team\nmanager is to accept what packages and\n\n267\n00:16:49.439 --> 00:16:52.572\nthen to deliver those work packages,\nso it's A.\n\n268\n00:16:52.572 --> 00:16:59.655\nNumber 14 then, in which situation might\nthe control inner stage process be used?\n\n269\n00:16:59.655 --> 00:17:02.953\nWell, to control a stage, obviously.\n\n270\n00:17:02.953 --> 00:17:07.714\nSo is it to manage a long initiation\nstage of a complex project?\n\n271\n00:17:07.714 --> 00:17:11.841\nYes, definitely, it's asking for\na might, so yes.\n\n272\n00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:15.563\nIs it to manage activities\nof a complex program?\n\n273\n00:17:15.563 --> 00:17:22.216\nNo, that's not part of controlling stage,\nis it, that's what the team manager does.\n\n274\n00:17:22.216 --> 00:17:25.813\nSo is it part of organizing\nsupport activities\n\n275\n00:17:25.813 --> 00:17:29.885\nfollowing the handover of\nproducts to operations?\n\n276\n00:17:29.885 --> 00:17:32.922\nOrganizing support activities,\nthat's part of closing a project.\n\n277\n00:17:32.922 --> 00:17:39.513\nAnd what about creating an exception\nplan to replace the current stage plan?\n\n278\n00:17:39.513 --> 00:17:43.707\nRight, an exception plan\ndoesn't replace a stage plan.\n\n279\n00:17:43.707 --> 00:17:47.355\nNot at all, it might be fed into\na stage plan, the next stage plan but\n\n280\n00:17:47.355 --> 00:17:50.747\nthen that would be part of managing\nthe stage boundary, so no,\n\n281\n00:17:50.747 --> 00:17:52.864\nD doesn't make any sense whatsoever.\n\n282\n00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:57.581\nSo the answer is actually A,\nit's to manage a long stage.\n\n283\n00:17:57.581 --> 00:18:00.193\nSo, remember the question says might.\n\n284\n00:18:00.193 --> 00:18:04.937\nAnd what they're doing with this\nparticular question is that they\n\n285\n00:18:04.937 --> 00:18:07.400\nare giving you sample scenarios.\n\n286\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.114\nAnd they're expecting you to\nbe able to work out which\n\n287\n00:18:12.114 --> 00:18:16.108\nscenario that particular process matches.\n\n288\n00:18:16.108 --> 00:18:19.115\nAnd out of all of them,\nA is the most likely.\n\n289\n00:18:19.115 --> 00:18:21.635\nSo what about number 15 then?\n\n290\n00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:25.685\nWhat is PRINCE2's recommended\napproach to planning?\n\n291\n00:18:25.685 --> 00:18:28.622\nDo we identify activities and\ndependencies?\n\n292\n00:18:28.622 --> 00:18:31.949\nI would say so,\nwe do that in a project Gantt chart.\n\n293\n00:18:31.949 --> 00:18:35.432\nDo we describe the means of\ncommunication for a project?\n\n294\n00:18:35.432 --> 00:18:37.604\nNot as part of planning, no.\n\n295\n00:18:37.604 --> 00:18:42.643\nBecause, well, you don't know who\nyou're communicating to first of all.\n\n296\n00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:45.460\nWe've got to find out who\nare stakeholders are and\n\n297\n00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.365\nthen we work out how we're going\nto define our management approach.\n\n298\n00:18:49.365 --> 00:18:53.603\nWhat about implementing responses for\nopportunities?\n\n299\n00:18:53.603 --> 00:18:57.805\nWell there is no default to that,\nis there, that's something that we have\n\n300\n00:18:57.805 --> 00:19:01.288\nto think about part of any project so\nthat's part of the plan.\n\n301\n00:19:01.288 --> 00:19:05.990\nSo it's not approach to plan in itself,\nthat should be part of the plan.\n\n302\n00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.708\nAnd baseline in project deliverables,\nagain,\n\n303\n00:19:08.708 --> 00:19:11.435\nit's an activity,\nit's something that we do.\n\n304\n00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:15.943\nSo it's not part of the plan,\nit's actually one of the activities, or\n\n305\n00:19:15.943 --> 00:19:18.348\nsorry, it's not part of planning but\n\n306\n00:19:18.348 --> 00:19:22.049\nit's one of the activities\nthat we undertake in the plan.\n\n307\n00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:26.892\nThis is another fine example of RTFQ,\nof reading the full question.\n\n308\n00:19:26.892 --> 00:19:31.701\nThe question's not asking you what\nshould be included in a plan, cuz B, C,\n\n309\n00:19:31.701 --> 00:19:33.895\nand D should be included in a plan.\n\n310\n00:19:33.895 --> 00:19:38.343\nThe question's basically\nasking you how we plan, okay.\n\n311\n00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:41.652\nSo be very, very careful,\nit's the approach to planning.\n\n312\n00:19:41.652 --> 00:19:45.066\nYou're having to identify what\nactivities we need to do.\n\n313\n00:19:45.066 --> 00:19:48.920\nB, C and D are the activities,\nor some of the activities.\n\n314\n00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.945\nRTFQ, be really, really careful, okay?\n\n315\n00:19:51.945 --> 00:19:53.005\nNumber 16 then,\n\n316\n00:19:53.005 --> 00:19:57.124\nwhat's the advantage of applying\nthe learn from experience principle?\n\n317\n00:19:57.124 --> 00:20:00.839\nOf course, this is about lessons learned,\nlearn from experience.\n\n318\n00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:04.588\nAnd if we can just go full screen on this\nparticular one cuz I know some of this is\n\n319\n00:20:04.588 --> 00:20:06.622\non the bottom right-hand corner there.\n\n320\n00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:13.227\nSo does learn from experience allow the\nproject board to delegate cost tolerances?\n\n321\n00:20:13.227 --> 00:20:17.832\nLearning from experience is not gonna\nhave anything to do with Delegating cost\n\n322\n00:20:17.832 --> 00:20:19.937\ntolerances, that makes no sense.\n\n323\n00:20:19.937 --> 00:20:22.986\nAllowing the project team to\nfully understand their roles and\n\n324\n00:20:22.986 --> 00:20:24.048\nresponsibilities.\n\n325\n00:20:24.048 --> 00:20:27.124\nThat's not about learning from experience,\nthe lesson's learnt.\n\n326\n00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:30.340\nIt's not gonna help me understand my\nroles and responsibilities, okay.\n\n327\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.938\nAllowing the project manager to delegate\ntime tolerances to the team manager.\n\n328\n00:20:34.938 --> 00:20:39.280\nAgain, that doesn't make any\nsense cuz it's about delegation.\n\n329\n00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.350\nLearning from experience is about,\nlooking at what went wrong and\n\n330\n00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.941\nlooking at what went right in either\nprevious projects or our own project.\n\n331\n00:20:47.941 --> 00:20:52.330\nAnd then working out which we can\napply to this current project.\n\n332\n00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.475\nSo it actually, D makes more sense\nallowing the team to identify\n\n333\n00:20:56.475 --> 00:21:01.098\nimprovements to be made,\nthat's why we would learn from experience.\n\n334\n00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:04.048\nThe others, again, don't make any sense.\n\n335\n00:21:04.048 --> 00:21:08.368\nIf it makes you laugh or it leaves you\nscratching your head, then at that point\n\n336\n00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:12.369\nin time what I want you to do is to\nwalk away from that particular answer.\n\n337\n00:21:12.369 --> 00:21:13.612\nSo number 17, then,\n\n338\n00:21:13.612 --> 00:21:17.849\nwhich is a responsibility of the business\nrepresentative on the project board?\n\n339\n00:21:17.849 --> 00:21:21.994\nIs it A, to set tolerance levels for\nthe project?\n\n340\n00:21:21.994 --> 00:21:26.742\nThe business representative it's not\ntheir job to set tolerance level.\n\n341\n00:21:26.742 --> 00:21:31.786\nThey would be able to advise on what they\nthink that tolerance level should be but\n\n342\n00:21:31.786 --> 00:21:34.509\nits not their job to set tolerance levels.\n\n343\n00:21:34.509 --> 00:21:38.758\nIs it B, to ensure that the project\nrepresents value for money?\n\n344\n00:21:38.758 --> 00:21:42.902\nWell, we know that that is one of the\nstated responsibilities of the business\n\n345\n00:21:42.902 --> 00:21:44.703\nrepresentative, we know that.\n\n346\n00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:46.279\nLet's take a look at C then,\n\n347\n00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:50.102\nconfirming that the project delivers\nthe required functionality.\n\n348\n00:21:50.102 --> 00:21:54.933\nThey can't do that, I mean, they can\nadvise with the customer acceptance\n\n349\n00:21:54.933 --> 00:21:58.473\ntested, and\nthey can certainly advise on sign-off.\n\n350\n00:21:58.473 --> 00:22:02.867\nHowever, they're not gonna advise\non confirming that the project\n\n351\n00:22:02.867 --> 00:22:05.497\ndelivers the required functionality.\n\n352\n00:22:05.497 --> 00:22:09.368\nThat's down to the project manager to make\nsure that the project actually delivers it\n\n353\n00:22:09.368 --> 00:22:10.722\nbut on managing the project.\n\n354\n00:22:10.722 --> 00:22:14.977\nAnd what about checking\nthe required quality levels\n\n355\n00:22:14.977 --> 00:22:18.756\nare achieved by\nthe the project's products?\n\n356\n00:22:18.756 --> 00:22:22.030\nThat's something that\nthe customer would do.\n\n357\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:26.457\nThey would be able to confirm that\nwe've got the required quality levels.\n\n358\n00:22:26.457 --> 00:22:31.117\nHowever, quality assurance Would\nactually check that the required quality\n\n359\n00:22:31.117 --> 00:22:32.485\nlevels are achieved.\n\n360\n00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:36.409\nThat's a role by the quality assurers and\nthen the customer signs them off.\n\n361\n00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:41.947\nSo the answer here is: B, ensuring\nthat the represents value for money.\n\n362\n00:22:41.947 --> 00:22:46.544\nSo what makes a project\nthen a PRINCE2 project?\n\n363\n00:22:46.544 --> 00:22:49.925\nWell a PRINCE2 project is\na project that has processes\n\n364\n00:22:49.925 --> 00:22:53.243\nthat satisfy the objectives\nof PRINCE2 processes.\n\n365\n00:22:53.243 --> 00:22:58.524\nAnd I know that I've said throughout\nour episodes, we expect you to tailor.\n\n366\n00:22:58.524 --> 00:23:01.786\nAnd if that means tailor in what\nyou call things, then that's okay.\n\n367\n00:23:01.786 --> 00:23:07.103\nWe expect you to tailor, if you don't\ntailor, then you can't plug and\n\n368\n00:23:07.103 --> 00:23:12.964\nplay PRINCE2, and it's simply not going\nto work in an efficient way for you.\n\n369\n00:23:12.964 --> 00:23:14.624\nSo we know that A is true.\n\n370\n00:23:14.624 --> 00:23:18.943\nB has permanent project organization\nto deliver a long term result.\n\n371\n00:23:18.943 --> 00:23:25.491\nPermanent, no, a project is a temporary\norganization, so it's definitely not B.\n\n372\n00:23:25.491 --> 00:23:29.624\nEstablish technology to\nimprove business as usual.\n\n373\n00:23:29.624 --> 00:23:32.258\nOkay, we understand that whatever we do,\n\n374\n00:23:32.258 --> 00:23:36.950\nwhen we're implementing a new project\nit's to improve business as usual.\n\n375\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:41.397\nBut there's no technology that's gonna\nwave a magic wand and do that for you.\n\n376\n00:23:41.397 --> 00:23:45.634\nThe tool is only ever as good as\nwhat it's been programmed to do.\n\n377\n00:23:45.634 --> 00:23:48.664\nAnd you have to configure the tools\nto do what you want it to do.\n\n378\n00:23:48.664 --> 00:23:52.163\nTechnology itself isn't gonna\ndeliver anything like that.\n\n379\n00:23:52.163 --> 00:23:55.530\nAnd so it applies some of\nthe PRINCE2 principles but\n\n380\n00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.988\nthat doesn't make any sense does it?\n\n381\n00:23:57.988 --> 00:24:00.778\nWhen we've got option A there which it's\n\n382\n00:24:00.778 --> 00:24:05.570\ngot project processes to satisfy\nthe objectives of the two processes.\n\n383\n00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.450\nSo the answer there is A, most definitely.\n\n384\n00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.550\nWhat about risk probability then,\nnumber 19?\n\n385\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:22.230\nWell, risk probability is about\nthe likelihood of a risk occurring.\n\n386\n00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.810\nIs it probable that this\nis going to happen?\n\n387\n00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.750\nIs this likely?\n\n388\n00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.670\nOkay, that's what probability is.\n\n389\n00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.030\nSo is it the scale of the risk?\n\n390\n00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.630\nNo, we consider that\nwhen we're managing risk.\n\n391\n00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:38.670\nWe consider scale and likelihood, but no,\nit's not about the scale or the impact.\n\n392\n00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:42.370\nIs it about the probable effect\nof the project to be enabled?\n\n393\n00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.750\nNo, because we're talking\nabout risk probability.\n\n394\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.480\nOkay, so we're talking about\nindividual risk, so it's not B.\n\n395\n00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.230\nIs it a probable timeframe within\nwhich the risk might occur?\n\n396\n00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.950\nNo, we're not talking about timeframes,\nwe're talking about specific risk, so\n\n397\n00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.930\nit is actually B,\nas I mentioned that word, likelihood.\n\n398\n00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.570\nWhich describes then,\nnumber 20, the implement step.\n\n399\n00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.260\nWithin the recommended\nrisk management procedure.\n\n400\n00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:17.390\nWell, we know what implement is, because\nwe identify risks, then we assess them.\n\n401\n00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.510\nThen we decide what we're\ngoing to do about them,\n\n402\n00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:24.880\nand then we implement that mitigation or\nthat action, as it were.\n\n403\n00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.830\nSo what is the implement step?\n\n404\n00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.300\nWell, it's about\nimplementing the activity.\n\n405\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:37.500\nSo is it where project support allocates\nthe risk budget to fund the response?\n\n406\n00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.000\nNo, implement is about doing.\n\n407\n00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.480\nIs it whether it's going to decide\nthe best response to control the risk?\n\n408\n00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.190\nNo, because that's where\nthe decision is made, and\n\n409\n00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.120\nso null implement is the next step.\n\n410\n00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.030\nIs it about the risk going around\nactually carrying out activities?\n\n411\n00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.670\nYes, definitely.\n\n412\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.570\nAnd what about formulating\nan approach to risk management?\n\n413\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.780\nWell, that's way back in that\nrisk management process.\n\n414\n00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.810\nSo no, it's not that.\n\n415\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.210\nIt is actually C.\n\n416\n00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.395\nLet's look at 21 then.\n\n417\n00:26:09.395 --> 00:26:14.050\n21, what is the objective of\nthe initiated project process?\n\n418\n00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.220\nAn objective, it is not asking for\nthe main objective.\n\n419\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.590\nIt is just asking you to\nidentify one objective\n\n420\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.820\nof the initiated project process.\n\n421\n00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.980\nAssuring that they're, sorry,\n\n422\n00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.750\nto ensure that there's authority\nto initiate the project.\n\n423\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.480\nNo, because that should already\nhave been done prior to\n\n424\n00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.260\nthe initiating a project process,\nso, no, it's not it.\n\n425\n00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.390\nTo prepare plans for\nsubsequent delivery changes, no,\n\n426\n00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.556\nthat's part of controlling a project.\n\n427\n00:26:45.556 --> 00:26:49.470\nAnd then managing stage boundaries.\n\n428\n00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.020\nSo it's not B.\n\n429\n00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:54.613\nTo summarize how the organization's\nproject management method will be\n\n430\n00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:56.740\ntailored for the project?\n\n431\n00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.010\nYes, that's part of\ninitiating the project.\n\n432\n00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.550\nAnd what about D then, to request\nauthority from program, corporate,\n\n433\n00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.560\nor the customer to deliver the project?\n\n434\n00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.000\nNo, that happens right\nat the very beginning\n\n435\n00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.080\nwhen we are considering\nthe business justification.\n\n436\n00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.920\nSo the answer here is C, summarize how\n\n437\n00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.730\nour project management method is going to\nbe tailored for this particular project.\n\n438\n00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:29.030\nSo number 22 then, the minimum\nrequirement for the risk theme or\n\n439\n00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:33.330\nis it to assign risk actionees to\nundertake planned risk responses?\n\n440\n00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:35.090\nIs that a minimum requirement?\n\n441\n00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.770\nNo, because quite,\n\n442\n00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:43.140\nsometimes you might not want to respond\nto risk other than to just accept it.\n\n443\n00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.480\nSo therefore,\nyou don't necessarily need an actionee.\n\n444\n00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.230\nSo that's not going to be a minimum,\nis it?\n\n445\n00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.840\nB to escalate identified\nthreats to the project board.\n\n446\n00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.660\nAgain, not all of them need escalation.\n\n447\n00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.660\nC to record threats in a risk register.\n\n448\n00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.140\nWe know we've definitely got to do that.\n\n449\n00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.140\nAnd establish a risk\nbudget to fund responses.\n\n450\n00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.610\nNo, because sometimes we\njust wanna accept risk, so\n\n451\n00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.270\nthere doesn't necessarily\nhave to be a budget.\n\n452\n00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:12.313\nSo the answer there then is C.\n\n453\n00:28:12.313 --> 00:28:16.672\n23 then, if a work package is\nforecast to exceed its tolerances,\n\n454\n00:28:16.672 --> 00:28:20.350\nhow should the team manager\ninform the project manager?\n\n455\n00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:27.660\nSo does he or she submit an exception\nreport or an exception plan?\n\n456\n00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:33.240\nNo, it's not an exception,\nnothing's gone wrong.\n\n457\n00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.070\nWhat we want to raise is an issue.\n\n458\n00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.750\nIt goes on our issue register,\nso we raise an issue.\n\n459\n00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:43.340\nIt's not a risk,\nit's something that is going to happen.\n\n460\n00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.710\nSo, no, we want to raise an issue.\n\n461\n00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:47.430\nWe want to identify this and\n\n462\n00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:52.520\nwe want to inform the project\nmanager immediately that we know.\n\n463\n00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:58.690\nWho's responsible for documenting\nany tailoring of work packages?\n\n464\n00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.030\nIs it the executive?\n\n465\n00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.990\nNo, it's not the project board.\n\n466\n00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:04.850\nIs it the project manager?\n\n467\n00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:09.550\nYes, it is, documenting\nthe tailoring of the work packages.\n\n468\n00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.540\nIt's not the team manager.\n\n469\n00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.120\nThe team manager's role is to actually\nmanage the delivery of the work packages.\n\n470\n00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.800\nSo project support?\n\n471\n00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.220\nNo, it's not their role.\n\n472\n00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.600\nTheir role is an administrative role and\nlooking after all of the administration\n\n473\n00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.800\nand all of the documentation within the\nproject, but they don't actually perform\n\n474\n00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.570\nthe documentation, because I don't\nexpect that role to be a technical role.\n\n475\n00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.270\nSo it is actually going to be B,\nthe project manager.\n\n476\n00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.120\nSo number 25 then,\nwhat is a minimum requirement for\n\n477\n00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.840\napplying the quality theme?\n\n478\n00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.890\nWell, let's take a look.\n\n479\n00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.002\nIt is to define the use and\nformat of quality records?\n\n480\n00:29:48.002 --> 00:29:51.640\nThat seems a little bit specific for\na theme, doesn't it?\n\n481\n00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.770\nTo define the project's approach\nto quality insurance, well, no,\n\n482\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.570\nthat's part of quality.\n\n483\n00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:04.300\nWell, say that is part of quality but\nto define approach to quality insurance,\n\n484\n00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:11.468\nwe need to do that little bit\nlater on during the projects and\n\n485\n00:30:11.468 --> 00:30:17.320\nI don't know, is that a minimum\nrequirement do you think?\n\n486\n00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.800\nWell, let's take a look.\n\n487\n00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.490\nThere's something about that that\nmakes me feel a little bit uneasy, so\n\n488\n00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.550\nlet's take a look at the others.\n\n489\n00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:29.560\nTo define the proxy measures that\nindicate achievable benefits,\n\n490\n00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.140\nI don't remember covering that at all,\ndo you?\n\n491\n00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.120\nProxy measures to indicate\nachievable benefits.\n\n492\n00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.730\nHow would proxy measures\nindicate achievable benefits?\n\n493\n00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.380\nSo what do proxy measures mean?\n\n494\n00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.621\nDoes that kind of mean sort\nof deferring measurements?\n\n495\n00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:51.779\nWell, you don't wanna differ\nmeasurements to achieve benefits and\n\n496\n00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:53.450\nquality is perceived.\n\n497\n00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:57.201\nSo we wanna think about if we're gonna\nmeasure that about maybe surveys etc.\n\n498\n00:30:57.201 --> 00:31:00.574\nAnd think about\nthe deliverables themselves.\n\n499\n00:31:00.574 --> 00:31:03.102\nWhat about defining the approach?\n\n500\n00:31:03.102 --> 00:31:05.300\nThe project to showrooms.\n\n501\n00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.470\nWhat's project assurance?\n\n502\n00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:13.230\nProject assurance is about ensuring\n\n503\n00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:18.500\nthat the project delivers\nthe quality that's defined in,\n\n504\n00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.380\nwell, in all of our business\njustification and in our quality.\n\n505\n00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.980\nSo minimum requirement?\n\n506\n00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.110\nWell, is that we have to\nhave project assurance, and\n\n507\n00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:33.340\nwe have to ensure that a project\ndelivers what it's supposed to deliver.\n\n508\n00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:39.850\nCareful with that one, because B had me\ntempted, and I don't know about you, but\n\n509\n00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:44.220\nit talked about the project\napproach to quality assurance.\n\n510\n00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.880\nWell, quality assurance is going to be,\n\n511\n00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.377\nthe definition of quality\nis defined by the customer.\n\n512\n00:31:50.377 --> 00:31:55.192\nAnd so therefore I expect the customer to\nbe involved in some of the testing for\n\n513\n00:31:55.192 --> 00:31:56.090\nthat as well.\n\n514\n00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:00.016\nSo the answer there is D, but be careful,\nthat's one you're gonna have to think\n\n515\n00:32:00.016 --> 00:32:04.646\nabout there and there are going to be\nsome hard ones in this particular test.\n\n516\n00:32:04.646 --> 00:32:07.650\nSo what is the purpose\nthen of the quality theme?\n\n517\n00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.676\nIs it to establish mechanisms to judge\nwhether a project is desirable and\n\n518\n00:32:11.676 --> 00:32:12.470\nachievable?\n\n519\n00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.880\nNo, that's business justification.\n\n520\n00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.219\nIs it to look for\n\n521\n00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:20.670\nways to improve the effectiveness\nof the management of the project?\n\n522\n00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:25.601\nYes, okay it is because again, it's about\nproject assurance, making sure that we\n\n523\n00:32:25.601 --> 00:32:30.120\ncan deliver what we are supposed\nto deliver in terms of quality.\n\n524\n00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.460\nIs it to control uncertainty?\n\n525\n00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.900\nDefinitely not.\n\n526\n00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.378\nNo, that's not quality.\n\n527\n00:32:35.378 --> 00:32:39.830\nNo, that would be down to risk\nmanagement controlling uncertainty.\n\n528\n00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.811\nAnd is to establish mechanisms to\ncontrol any unacceptable deviation?\n\n529\n00:32:45.811 --> 00:32:50.090\nNo, the project manager will have to do\nthat as part of just managing the project,\n\n530\n00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.360\ncontrolling the project itself.\n\n531\n00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.720\nSo the answer there is, B.\n\n532\n00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.690\nNumber 27 then, what is the purpose\nof the business case theme?\n\n533\n00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:04.956\nWell, the business case theme,\nthat purpose is to well,\n\n534\n00:33:04.956 --> 00:33:09.835\ncompile the business case which\nmeans justification as to whether\n\n535\n00:33:09.835 --> 00:33:14.452\nthis project is going to deliver a return,\neither financial or\n\n536\n00:33:14.452 --> 00:33:17.522\nnon-financial, to the organization.\n\n537\n00:33:17.522 --> 00:33:21.400\nSo, is it to establish mechanisms for\nmanaging issues?\n\n538\n00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.680\nAbsolutely not.\n\n539\n00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.701\nIs it to establish methods to judge\nwhether the ongoing project is justified?\n\n540\n00:33:27.701 --> 00:33:28.293\nYes.\n\n541\n00:33:28.293 --> 00:33:31.870\nDoes it assess and\ncontrol on certain events?\n\n542\n00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.040\nNo, definitely not.\n\n543\n00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.980\nDoes it describe how\nproducts will be delivered?\n\n544\n00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.040\nNo, that sounds very much like a plan,\nthat doesn't sound like a business case.\n\n545\n00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:45.000\nA business case is a justification for\na significant item of expenditure.\n\n546\n00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.237\nSo, of course, the answer to that is B.\n\n547\n00:33:48.237 --> 00:33:53.185\nSo which process then, number 28, provides\nthe project board with the information\n\n548\n00:33:53.185 --> 00:33:56.450\nit requires in order to commit\nresources to the project?\n\n549\n00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:59.166\nWhich process?\n\n550\n00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.450\nIs it managing product delivery?\n\n551\n00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.718\nIf you're committing\nresources to the project,\n\n552\n00:34:03.718 --> 00:34:05.503\nit better be at the beginning, right?\n\n553\n00:34:05.503 --> 00:34:08.400\nIt's not gonna be halfway\nthrough the project or\n\n554\n00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.812\nonce the project's been established.\n\n555\n00:34:10.812 --> 00:34:12.400\nSo it's not gonna be A.\n\n556\n00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.678\nIt's gonna be an initiating\na project surely.\n\n557\n00:34:15.678 --> 00:34:19.531\nIt's not gonna be in controlling\nthe stage because again,\n\n558\n00:34:19.531 --> 00:34:22.239\nit should be done right to the beginning.\n\n559\n00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:25.992\nAnd it's not going to be in\ndirecting the project because,\n\n560\n00:34:25.992 --> 00:34:30.881\ndirecting the project is that, well\nthat one's owned by the project board.\n\n561\n00:34:30.881 --> 00:34:34.908\nAnd it's asking here, which process\nprovides the project board with\n\n562\n00:34:34.908 --> 00:34:38.680\nthe information it needs to\nessentially direct a project?\n\n563\n00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.220\nSo it's going to be initiating\nthe project that's going to do that.\n\n564\n00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.908\nBecause basically you're asking for\n\n565\n00:34:44.908 --> 00:34:49.590\nwhich process provides information\nto directing a project.\n\n566\n00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.404\nWell, so it's not gonna be D, is it?\n\n567\n00:34:51.404 --> 00:34:52.720\nIt's actually going to be B.\n\n568\n00:34:52.720 --> 00:35:00.520\nAnd number 29, which two statements\ndescribe a highlight report?\n\n569\n00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:05.340\nA highlight report is, well,\nwhere are we right now?\n\n570\n00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.160\nHow are we doing?\n\n571\n00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.790\nSo, does it provide a summary\nof the stage status?\n\n572\n00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:11.141\nYes, it does.\n\n573\n00:35:11.141 --> 00:35:14.900\nIs it used by the project board to\nmonitor the progress of the stage?\n\n574\n00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.030\nYes, it is.\n\n575\n00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.416\nSo that's number 1 and 2.\n\n576\n00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:23.380\nSo I'm erring towards A, but let me\njust check the others just to make sure.\n\n577\n00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.320\nIs it produced by the project manager\nwhen a new risk is identified?\n\n578\n00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.336\nNo, that's a risk register.\n\n579\n00:35:28.336 --> 00:35:32.102\nAnd is it used by the project manager\nto escalate with the exception?\n\n580\n00:35:32.102 --> 00:35:33.900\nNo, of course not.\n\n581\n00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:38.080\nThe highlight report is a highlight of\nthe actual progress of the project.\n\n582\n00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.960\nSo the answer there is A, 1 and 2.\n\n583\n00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.594\nAnd so now, question number 30.\n\n584\n00:35:43.594 --> 00:35:46.242\nWhich is gonna be the last question for\n\n585\n00:35:46.242 --> 00:35:52.030\nthis particular episode cuz we're\nhalfway through this particular test.\n\n586\n00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.459\nAnd so,\nwe're gonna come back in episode two and\n\n587\n00:35:54.459 --> 00:35:58.440\nwe're gonna take a look at questions\n31 through through the questions 60.\n\n588\n00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.803\nSo let's take a look at number 30 then.\n\n589\n00:36:00.803 --> 00:36:06.980\nWhich product provides the version number\nof all products in a particular stage?\n\n590\n00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.008\nWhich product?\nI don't like the wording of that,\n\n591\n00:36:10.008 --> 00:36:11.830\nit does sound a little bit clumsy.\n\n592\n00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:17.010\nYou could say, well, which document or\nwhich activity, for instance,\n\n593\n00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:22.620\nbut it's definitely a document,\nwhich is why they're saying about product.\n\n594\n00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:26.330\nWhich provides the version\nnumber of all products?\n\n595\n00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:27.928\nIs it gonna be an issue register?\n\n596\n00:36:27.928 --> 00:36:31.040\nNo, because this is not\nnecessarily an issue.\n\n597\n00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.610\nIs it a product status account?\n\n598\n00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:33.217\nYes.\n\n599\n00:36:33.217 --> 00:36:35.910\nIs it the description?\n\n600\n00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.288\nNo, because that's not gonna\ngive a version number,\n\n601\n00:36:39.288 --> 00:36:41.498\nthat's just gonna give\na description of the product.\n\n602\n00:36:41.498 --> 00:36:45.730\nWhat you're talking about in version\nnumbers, you're talking about attributes.\n\n603\n00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:48.720\nAnd so the attribute is gonna\nbe listed in the status account.\n\n604\n00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.950\nAnd is it the CI record?\n\n605\n00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:58.818\nNo, it's not necessarily the CI\nrecord because the CI record\n\n606\n00:36:58.818 --> 00:37:01.971\nwill just list the attributes of one CI.\n\n607\n00:37:01.971 --> 00:37:09.110\nThat is an individual CI record,\nbe very careful on this one.\n\n608\n00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.641\nAnd this is the last question for\nthis particular episode and\n\n609\n00:37:11.641 --> 00:37:13.040\nwe'll be back in a little while.\n\n610\n00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.940\nBe really careful.\n\n611\n00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.271\nRemember to RTFQ, read the full question.\n\n612\n00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:23.260\nWhich product provides the version\nnumber of all products?\n\n613\n00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.630\nThe CI record would be right.\n\n614\n00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:30.333\nIf we were just talking about one product,\nbut we're not,\n\n615\n00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:33.260\nwe're talking about all products.\n\n616\n00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.112\nAnd so that would be in\nthe product status account.\n\n617\n00:37:37.112 --> 00:37:40.463\nNow, I know that in previous episodes,\n\n618\n00:37:40.463 --> 00:37:46.470\nI have referred you through to\nthe ITIL series that we have done.\n\n619\n00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:51.285\nI would recommend that if you\nare confused about status accounting and\n\n620\n00:37:51.285 --> 00:37:55.447\nif you are confused about the CI records,\nfor instance, and\n\n621\n00:37:55.447 --> 00:38:00.930\nconfiguration management, I would\nrecommend that you go to your ITIL series.\n\n622\n00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:06.458\nYou have access to that, it's under the\nops and project management, operations and\n\n623\n00:38:06.458 --> 00:38:11.470\nproject management in the course library,\nand go into service transition.\n\n624\n00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:16.236\nAnd within service transition,\nthere is an episode on Service Asset and\n\n625\n00:38:16.236 --> 00:38:21.313\nConfiguration Management or SACM,\ntake a look at that episode and there will\n\n626\n00:38:21.313 --> 00:38:26.572\nbe much more of an in depth description\non asset and configuration management.\n\n627\n00:38:26.572 --> 00:38:31.039\nSo, CIs configuration items and\nstatus accounting and\n\n628\n00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:35.120\nalso the configuration\nmanagement database.\n\n629\n00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.643\nSo if you are confused,\nthen go to that particular episode.\n\n630\n00:38:39.643 --> 00:38:42.610\nSo we've looked at questions\n1 through questions 30.\n\n631\n00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.476\nAnd as you've seen, we had a little\nbit of talk at the beginning,\n\n632\n00:38:45.476 --> 00:38:47.210\nso we've just gone over 30 minutes.\n\n633\n00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:52.220\nSo you'll see that you still can\nanalyze each question, but you're not\n\n634\n00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:58.180\ngoing to have time to sit there and\nput your feet up and twiddle your thumbs.\n\n635\n00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.092\nSo what I'm gonna do for now, we're\ngonna take a little bit of a break and\n\n636\n00:39:02.092 --> 00:39:04.403\nthen when we come back\nin our next episode,\n\n637\n00:39:04.403 --> 00:39:08.146\nwe're gonna take a look at questions\n31 through to question 60.\n\n638\n00:39:08.146 --> 00:39:11.746\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

your Prince\n2 2017 Foundation sample paper.\n\n4\n00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.790\nSo in part 1, we took a look at questions\n1 through 30, and here we are in part 2,\n\n5\n00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.665\nand we're gonna take a look at\nquestions 30 through to questions 60.\n\n6\n00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:32.995\nAnd as ever, I am Jo Peacock,\nI am here as your guru and\n\n7\n00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:35.495\nyour guide through these\nlast 30 questions.\n\n8\n00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:38.345\nSo lets jump straight in,\ncuz you know what?\n\n9\n00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:40.730\nWe're under a time pressure here,\naren't we?\n\n10\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.960\nWe've only got an hour and\nwe've got 60 questions to do.\n\n11\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.411\nSo let's take a look then at number 31.\n\n12\n00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:50.327\nAnd this is another one of these ones I,\nI always like these multiple choice\n\n13\n00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:54.910\nones because you can simply just put that\ntick and that cross next to each answer.\n\n14\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.820\nSo number 31, which two statements\nabout the risk theme are correct?\n\n15\n00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.050\nSo does risk identify how to manage\nrisk at corporate program management or\n\n16\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.990\ncustomer level of an organization?\n\n17\n00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.130\nDoes it?\n\n18\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.940\nYes, it does.\n\n19\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.320\nIt identifies how to manage risks\nat program management, yeah.\n\n20\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.325\nDoes risk management aim to\nsupport better decision making\n\n21\n00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:22.610\nthrough good understanding of\nthe threats and opportunities?\n\n22\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.613\nYes, it does.\n\n23\n00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:27.334\nBut we're talking about\nthe risk theme here,\n\n24\n00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:29.854\nnot about risk management in particular.\n\n25\n00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:32.840\nDoes it explain risk management activity?\n\n26\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.530\nNo, no, no, of course not,\nbecause the risk\n\n27\n00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.610\nbeing is not about explaining explicit\nactivities for risk management.\n\n28\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.680\nIt's about cutting a method to\nidentify risk into managers.\n\n29\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.760\nSpecific activities, that's part\nof the individual risk management.\n\n30\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.684\nDoes it identify, assess and\ncontrols approved changes to that?\n\n31\n00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:58.920\nNo, that's change control.\n\n32\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.810\nNo, risk management doesn't identify or\nassess, or\n\n33\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.960\ncontrol changes to the baseline.\n\n34\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.540\nSo the answer here is\nmost definitely 1 and 2.\n\n35\n00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.360\nSo what about number 32 then?\n\n36\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.340\nWhat must be recorded in project\ninitiation documentation to meet\n\n37\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.160\nthe minimum requirements for\napplying the progress theme?\n\n38\n00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.460\nThat is about identifying\nhow we’re going to progress.\n\n39\n00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.010\nSo do we need an overall approach\nto managing by exception?\n\n40\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.580\nYes, we do.\n\n41\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.890\nAnd this is in that PID,\nthat Project Initiation Documentation.\n\n42\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.610\nDo we need to have the tailoring\nrequired for progress reports?\n\n43\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.870\nYes, we do, but not part of the progress\ntheme, cuz that's too specific.\n\n44\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.779\nRemember, our themes\nare our overall approaches.\n\n45\n00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:53.500\nThey have to be overarching thought\nprocesses rather than detailed tailoring.\n\n46\n00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.330\nDoes it include the tolerance\nareas that will not be controlled?\n\n47\n00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.160\nNo, we wanna control all tolerance,\nso that doesn’t make any sense.\n\n48\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.600\nDoes it detail the levels of\nmanagement control that will be used?\n\n49\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.290\nWhat, in the progress thing?\n\n50\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.240\nNo, it doesn’t.\n\n51\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.650\nAgain, that’s part of\nthe individual project management.\n\n52\n00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.055\nSo the answer to that is,\nan overall approach.\n\n53\n00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:18.280\nThat's the most, remember,\nthis is very high-level, and\n\n54\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.950\nthat's the most high-level answer\nthat's actually appropriate.\n\n55\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.970\nSo which theme establishes\nmechanisms to monitor and\n\n56\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.540\ncompare actual achievements\nagainst those plans.\n\n57\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.900\nWell again, that's progress.\n\n58\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.910\nNow, one thing that I do want to tell you\nhere, though, and I wanna point this out.\n\n59\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.280\nWe've had a couple of instances in\nour last episode and in this one,\n\n60\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.070\nwhere we've had questions that\nhave been grouped together.\n\n61\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.180\nThat is not usually the case, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.628\nI cannot guarantee that you're gonna have\nquestions that are grouped together, or\n\n63\n00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:53.170\nyou're not gonna have questions\nthat are not grouped together.\n\n64\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.164\nI can't guarantee one way or\n\n65\n00:03:55.164 --> 00:04:01.110\nthe other cuz the questions are randomly\nselected, so don't rely on that.\n\n66\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.097\nNow, in this particular test,\nwe don't necessarily have the time to read\n\n67\n00:04:05.097 --> 00:04:08.536\nthrough all of the questions first,\nso be incredibly careful.\n\n68\n00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:12.918\nIf you don't know one, immediately, time\nis of the essence, move on to the next one\n\n69\n00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:16.994\nbecause there maybe a question a little\nbit later on, this'll do with the same\n\n70\n00:04:16.994 --> 00:04:21.050\ntheme or the same topic, and that might\nhelp you answer that other question.\n\n71\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.632\nSo number 34 then,\nwhich role is responsible for\n\n72\n00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:28.580\nmanagement of risk assigned to it?\n\n73\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.320\nWell, that's the owner.\n\n74\n00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.280\nIt's not the actionee.\n\n75\n00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.420\nIt's the owner, the owner is responsible.\n\n76\n00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.490\nThe actionee might actually help\nwith some of the actions, but\n\n77\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.050\nwho's responsible for\nthe management of the risk?\n\n78\n00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.168\nThat's the risk owner.\n\n79\n00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:53.640\nAgain, I'm gonna use my acronym,\nread the full question, okay,\n\n80\n00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.380\nbecause that's going\nto help you with that.\n\n81\n00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.236\nIf you misread the question or\nyou answer the one,\n\n82\n00:04:59.236 --> 00:05:03.459\nthe question that you think is being\nasked, then you're gonna go with C.\n\n83\n00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:04.550\nBe careful.\n\n84\n00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.580\nWhat's a responsibility\nof the change authority?\n\n85\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.870\nWell, we know that the change authority\napproves change and that the larger\n\n86\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.090\nthe scale of the change or the higher the\nimpact of the change, we know that, well,\n\n87\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.290\nwe know that that will be a higher level\nof authority of proving that change.\n\n88\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.430\nSo let me take a look there,\n\n89\n00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.630\nis it to ensure that an acceptable\nsolution is being developed?\n\n90\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.190\nNo, because that's very technical, and\n\n91\n00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.460\nI don't expect the change\nauthority to do that.\n\n92\n00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.970\nTo prepare a team plan?\n\n93\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.550\nNo, that's not part of the change\nauthority, they're to approve changes.\n\n94\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.490\nTo maintain project files according\nto document control procedures?\n\n95\n00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.540\nNo, they're not maintaining project files.\n\n96\n00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.980\nThis is a change authority to\nsomebody who approves change, so\n\n97\n00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.120\ntheir job is therefore to approve or\nreject requests for change.\n\n98\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.020\nSo what about number 36 there?\n\n99\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.400\nNumber 36 says, what does applying\nmanagements by stages principle,\n\n100\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.640\nwhat does that ensure?\n\n101\n00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.140\nDoes it ensure that the customer's quality\nexpectations are captured and agreed?\n\n102\n00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.865\nThat's not part of managing by stages.\n\n103\n00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.030\nDoes it ensure that the project is\nproperly initiated before work begins?\n\n104\n00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.632\nWell, yes, because that's one of the first\nstages, is initiating the project, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:30.632 --> 00:06:33.084\nSo what about C then?\n\n106\n00:06:33.084 --> 00:06:37.230\nDoes it ensure that project management\nunderstands what they're accountable for?\n\n107\n00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.715\nNo, that's the RACI matrix,\nthat's not part of managing the stage,\n\n108\n00:06:41.715 --> 00:06:44.277\nthat's part of directing the project.\n\n109\n00:06:44.277 --> 00:06:48.285\nAnd does it ensure that\nthe project is only started and\n\n110\n00:06:48.285 --> 00:06:53.040\ncontinued if it's desirable,\nviable, and achievable?\n\n111\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.760\nWell, that's actually part of ensuring\nthe business justification for\n\n112\n00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.910\nthe project, and\nit's part of the project board.\n\n113\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.640\nThey will ensure that that is continued.\n\n114\n00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.030\nSo the answer there is B,\nthe project is properly initiated.\n\n115\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.030\nSo number 37 then, identify the missing\nword in the following sentence.\n\n116\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.324\nA management stage can\nbe longer when risk is?\n\n117\n00:07:18.324 --> 00:07:22.990\nRisk is low, when risk is, now,\nI've just given you the answer, haven't I?\n\n118\n00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.260\nTypically, in the middle of projects,\nyes, it can be longer when the answer,\n\n119\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.900\nwhen risk is lower.\n\n120\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.190\nIf there's not as much risk,\n\n121\n00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.160\nthen the management stage could be longer\nbecause we've got less risk to manage, so\n\n122\n00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.910\ntherefore, we've got more time to actually\ndedicate to delivering an outcome.\n\n123\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.700\nSo number 38 then,\nwhat takes place during closing a project?\n\n124\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.494\nWell, I'd like to think as part of\nclosing a project, we have sign off,\n\n125\n00:07:48.494 --> 00:07:52.851\nand that project, that product, is then\ntransferred over to our support teams for\n\n126\n00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:54.238\nthem to actually manage.\n\n127\n00:07:54.238 --> 00:07:59.152\nSo, post-project benefit\nreviews are performed.\n\n128\n00:07:59.152 --> 00:08:02.072\nI'd like think that they\nwere performed Well,\n\n129\n00:08:02.072 --> 00:08:06.455\nslightly earlier than during\nthe actual closing the project process.\n\n130\n00:08:06.455 --> 00:08:11.358\nWe need to ensure that we're\ndelivering benefit way before we say,\n\n131\n00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:13.527\nare we ready to close this out?\n\n132\n00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:16.123\nOwnership of the product is\ntransferred to the customer.\n\n133\n00:08:16.123 --> 00:08:21.874\nYes, most definitely ownership is\ntransferred during the closing a project.\n\n134\n00:08:21.874 --> 00:08:25.730\nAn end stage report is prepared for\nthe final stage.\n\n135\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.509\nNo, we're at the end of the final stage.\n\n136\n00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:32.841\nSo you can't prepare this for\nthe final stage, we're in it.\n\n137\n00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:38.369\nAnd project closure notification\nis reviewed and approved.\n\n138\n00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:43.073\nWell, the project closure\nnotification is actually delivered\n\n139\n00:08:43.073 --> 00:08:45.344\nduring the closing a project.\n\n140\n00:08:45.344 --> 00:08:48.979\nSo it is actually B,\nis the answer to this.\n\n141\n00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:53.629\nAnd now let's flip from closing\na project to starting up a project.\n\n142\n00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:56.370\nAnd what's the purpose of\nstarting up a project?\n\n143\n00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.766\nWell, is it to understand the resources\nand costs to deliver the project products.\n\n144\n00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:05.172\nNo, because when we're\nstarting up a project we don't\n\n145\n00:09:05.172 --> 00:09:10.034\nnecessarily know at that point in time,\nthat's part of initiating a project.\n\n146\n00:09:10.034 --> 00:09:16.073\nIs it to ensure that there's authority\nto deliver the projects products.\n\n147\n00:09:16.073 --> 00:09:21.628\nNo, because ensuring that there's\nan authority to deliver the products,\n\n148\n00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:25.466\nwell that's the project\nboard has that authority.\n\n149\n00:09:25.466 --> 00:09:30.679\nAnd of course we've got to ensure that\nproject board has got the authority.\n\n150\n00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:33.461\nBut they don't necessarily\ndelivery the products,\n\n151\n00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:36.128\nit's the team managers\nthat deliver the product.\n\n152\n00:09:36.128 --> 00:09:40.452\nIs it to do the minimum to decide\nwhether it's worthwhile initiating\n\n153\n00:09:40.452 --> 00:09:42.096\nthe project definitely.\n\n154\n00:09:42.096 --> 00:09:47.033\nA and B happened during initiation\nwhere as C is doing the minimum\n\n155\n00:09:47.033 --> 00:09:51.252\nto decide whether this is a good idea or\nnot basically.\n\n156\n00:09:51.252 --> 00:09:56.807\nWhat about creating products\nrequired to control the project.\n\n157\n00:09:56.807 --> 00:10:03.088\nAgain, well think about this, I want you\nto RTFQ on this one, defining the product\n\n158\n00:10:03.088 --> 00:10:08.776\nrequired to control the project would\nbe done during project initiation.\n\n159\n00:10:08.776 --> 00:10:13.346\nBut the word that was in there that's\ndesigned to throw you is the word create,\n\n160\n00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:15.503\ncreating the management products.\n\n161\n00:10:15.503 --> 00:10:17.448\nWe don't always create\nour management products.\n\n162\n00:10:17.448 --> 00:10:21.356\nQuite often, we'll go out and\nbuy them off the shelf, not create them.\n\n163\n00:10:21.356 --> 00:10:25.402\nWatch out for little words like\nthat again, read the full question,\n\n164\n00:10:25.402 --> 00:10:26.739\nread the full answer.\n\n165\n00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:27.999\nSo number 40 then,\n\n166\n00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:32.552\nin a customer/supplier context what's\nthe responsibility of a supplier?\n\n167\n00:10:32.552 --> 00:10:36.275\nWell, the supplier is doing something for\nthe customer, okay.\n\n168\n00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:41.599\nSo, is it to deliver the benefits,\nis that a responsibility of the supplier?\n\n169\n00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:47.619\nWell, we don't necessarily know\nthat we're delivering benefits.\n\n170\n00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:50.391\nIt's not up to the supplier to\narticulate what benefits are.\n\n171\n00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:53.796\nThey're gonna deliver outputs,\nthey're gonna deliver product, but\n\n172\n00:10:53.796 --> 00:10:56.881\nthey're not necessarily gonna\ndeliver benefits, it's not A.\n\n173\n00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:58.925\nIs it to provide a project mandate?\n\n174\n00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:05.799\nNo, that's down to management, that's got\nnothing to do with the supplier at all.\n\n175\n00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:07.849\nIs it to deliver\nthe outputs of the project?\n\n176\n00:11:07.849 --> 00:11:10.259\nYes, it is, that's one of their roles.\n\n177\n00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:13.131\nIs it to provide the requirements for\nthe product?\n\n178\n00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.742\nNo, that's the customer\nprovides the requirements.\n\n179\n00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:19.100\nSo, the only one that makes\nsense in that one is C.\n\n180\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.555\nSo what's the minimum requirement for\napplying the organization theme, then?\n\n181\n00:11:23.555 --> 00:11:28.210\nIs it to ensure, in other words applying\nthe organization theme means that we're\n\n182\n00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.609\nproperly organized to deliver the\nrequirements and to deliver the outputs.\n\n183\n00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:36.835\nSo, is it to ensure that the senior\nuser verifies user requirements?\n\n184\n00:11:36.835 --> 00:11:39.259\nNo, that's not a minimum requirement.\n\n185\n00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:44.017\nThat is a requirement but it's not\na minimum requirement before organization.\n\n186\n00:11:44.017 --> 00:11:47.224\nIs it to ensure that the change\nauthority is delegated?\n\n187\n00:11:47.224 --> 00:11:52.375\nNo, because more often than not we don't\nwant to delegate change of authority,\n\n188\n00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:54.585\nI mean we can but we don't want to.\n\n189\n00:11:54.585 --> 00:11:59.455\nIs it to ensure that all responsibilities\nof the project board are fulfilled?\n\n190\n00:11:59.455 --> 00:12:03.669\nYes, we wanna make sure that everybody's\ngot roles and responsibilities.\n\n191\n00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:07.278\nIs it to ensure that supplier\nresources are available?\n\n192\n00:12:07.278 --> 00:12:13.213\nNo, that's down to the project manager to\nensure that the resources are available.\n\n193\n00:12:13.213 --> 00:12:17.190\nPerhaps even the program\nportfolio manager to manage\n\n194\n00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.115\nresources across all of the projects.\n\n195\n00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:23.909\nSo the answer here is C.\n\n196\n00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:29.157\nWhat about number 42 then, when should the\nteam manager produce a checkpoint report?\n\n197\n00:12:29.157 --> 00:12:33.557\nWe know that the checkpoint report\nwas time driven because we know\n\n198\n00:12:33.557 --> 00:12:37.805\nthat from that first question\nthat we had in this sample paper.\n\n199\n00:12:37.805 --> 00:12:41.107\nAnd if we don't remember it from\nthe materials that we covered,\n\n200\n00:12:41.107 --> 00:12:43.627\nwe certainly know that\nfrom the first question.\n\n201\n00:12:43.627 --> 00:12:48.706\nSo then, is it to ensure, or when\nshould we produce a checkpoint report?\n\n202\n00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:53.486\nSo should we produce it when a work\npackage is being negotiated?\n\n203\n00:12:53.486 --> 00:12:58.254\nMm-hm, not necessarily, no,\na checkpoint is a point in time and\n\n204\n00:12:58.254 --> 00:13:02.186\nit's up to us to decide when\nthat checkpoint would be.\n\n205\n00:13:02.186 --> 00:13:05.966\nSo we could produce it when\nwe're negotiating it, but\n\n206\n00:13:05.966 --> 00:13:10.005\nsurely we'd want to produce\nit after we've negotiated.\n\n207\n00:13:10.005 --> 00:13:10.912\nWhat about B then?\n\n208\n00:13:10.912 --> 00:13:13.169\nAt the frequency agreed\nin the work package.\n\n209\n00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:15.763\nYeah, I like that sound of that one,\nthat sounds a lot better doesn't it.\n\n210\n00:13:15.763 --> 00:13:16.629\nAnd what about C?\n\n211\n00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:21.006\nOn completion of quality check and\nactivities for each product.\n\n212\n00:13:21.006 --> 00:13:24.436\nNo, it's about a check point\nthough as to how we're doing, or\n\n213\n00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:28.465\nhow we're progressing in the work package,\nnot just quality checking.\n\n214\n00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:31.346\nBe careful, watch out when\nyou're reading these questions.\n\n215\n00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:35.180\nMake sure, and I keep saying this, that\nyou answer the question that's being asked\n\n216\n00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.265\nof you, and that you understand\nwhat it is they're talking about.\n\n217\n00:13:38.265 --> 00:13:41.227\nAnd a checkpoint report\nis a point in time,\n\n218\n00:13:41.227 --> 00:13:44.365\nit's not just limited to quality checking.\n\n219\n00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:48.942\nWhat about when reviewing\nhow a stage is progressing?\n\n220\n00:13:48.942 --> 00:13:52.913\nYou know what,\nwhen I look at that it's not bad but\n\n221\n00:13:52.913 --> 00:13:56.139\nthen if I look at that and\ncompare it to B.\n\n222\n00:13:56.139 --> 00:14:01.761\nB's got something about it that\nsays I've got a point in time,\n\n223\n00:14:01.761 --> 00:14:05.166\nI've got something that's agreed.\n\n224\n00:14:05.166 --> 00:14:09.740\nThere's something about that that's\na lot more specific than D, and\n\n225\n00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.612\nthe answer is definitely B.\n\n226\n00:14:11.612 --> 00:14:17.215\nSo which statement describes then, number\n43, the directing a project process?\n\n227\n00:14:17.215 --> 00:14:21.733\nDoes it enable a project board to\nassure that there is continued\n\n228\n00:14:21.733 --> 00:14:23.705\nbusiness justification?\n\n229\n00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:28.303\nWell, I should like to ensure that we've\ngot continued business justification,\n\n230\n00:14:28.303 --> 00:14:29.690\nI'd like that for sure.\n\n231\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:33.658\nDoes the directing the project cover\nthe day to day activities of the project\n\n232\n00:14:33.658 --> 00:14:34.222\nmanager?\n\n233\n00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:35.398\nNo, that way too specific.\n\n234\n00:14:35.398 --> 00:14:39.541\nRemember, directing a project is\nat high level it's a project goal.\n\n235\n00:14:39.541 --> 00:14:43.123\nDoes it ensure there\nare regular progress meetings,\n\n236\n00:14:43.123 --> 00:14:47.511\nagain we're talking about specific\nmanagement of the project.\n\n237\n00:14:47.511 --> 00:14:49.485\nSo that's a bit too detailed, and\n\n238\n00:14:49.485 --> 00:14:53.446\nwhat about d does it begin on\ncompletion of the initiating a project?\n\n239\n00:14:53.446 --> 00:14:58.209\nNo, directing a project is about\nthe entire project itself,\n\n240\n00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:02.067\nit's about the direction\nof the entire project.\n\n241\n00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:04.880\nSo actually the only\none that's right is A.\n\n242\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.707\nWhat about the plans theme then?\n\n243\n00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:11.580\nNumber 44,\nwhat's a purpose of the plans theme?\n\n244\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.451\nIs it to identify, assess,\nand control uncertainty?\n\n245\n00:15:15.451 --> 00:15:20.708\nNo, that would be risk management, about\nidentifying and assessing uncertainty.\n\n246\n00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:22.828\nWhat about establishing\na coding system for\n\n247\n00:15:22.828 --> 00:15:25.010\nall components of the project's products?\n\n248\n00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.839\nHas to do with configuration management,\nno.\n\n249\n00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:32.737\nTo define the means of\ndelivering the product,\n\n250\n00:15:32.737 --> 00:15:37.615\ndefine the means,\nthat sounds like planning to me, okay.\n\n251\n00:15:37.615 --> 00:15:41.240\nTake a look at D,\nproducing a benefits management approach.\n\n252\n00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.319\nNo, that's definitely not\ngonna be in the plans theme,\n\n253\n00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.255\nbecause plans are about planning.\n\n254\n00:15:46.255 --> 00:15:48.500\nSo the only answer there is C.\n\n255\n00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.827\nAnd number 45 then, the purpose\nof a quality management approach.\n\n256\n00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:58.626\nIs it A, to define customer quality\nexpectations for the project?\n\n257\n00:15:58.626 --> 00:16:04.146\nOkay, is it about defining quality\nexpectations or is it about B,\n\n258\n00:16:04.146 --> 00:16:10.170\nto define quality standards that\nare going to be applied to the project.\n\n259\n00:16:12.015 --> 00:16:15.945\nYou see, quality expectations is about an\noutput, it's about what the customer wants\n\n260\n00:16:15.945 --> 00:16:21.445\nto see, whereas quality standards is\nabout the ongoing application of quality.\n\n261\n00:16:21.445 --> 00:16:25.495\nAnd if we're talking about quality\nmanagement and that's ongoing, again,\n\n262\n00:16:25.495 --> 00:16:27.755\nbe really carefully about the wording\n\n263\n00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:32.620\nbecause that could be the difference\nbetween a right answer and a wrong answer.\n\n264\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.340\nSo, I'm going with D.\n\n265\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.560\nIs it to identify the level of quality\nrequired for each product, too specific.\n\n266\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.710\nWe're talking about a quality approach.\n\n267\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.710\nI'm still going with B.\n\n268\n00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:49.680\nI ought to summarize the planned\nquality management activities,\n\n269\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.390\nthey are specific too.\n\n270\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.780\nSo, I'm definitely going with B.\n\n271\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.100\nNumber 46 then.\n\n272\n00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.030\nWe're still talking about quality.\n\n273\n00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:03.887\nHow does defining a product's quality\nrequirements support the 'focus on\n\n274\n00:17:03.887 --> 00:17:06.910\nproducts' principle?\n\n275\n00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:12.070\nDefining quality requirements, does\nthat provide the project's tolerances,\n\n276\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.940\nso that authority can be delegated?\n\n277\n00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.920\nI don't know where that came from but it's\ngot absolutely nothing to do with quality.\n\n278\n00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.660\nBy providing the responsibilities\nof the project management team.\n\n279\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.630\nIs that focused on products?\n\n280\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.130\nNo.\n\n281\n00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.590\nProviding justification for\n\n282\n00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:30.760\nthe project to be initiated,\nis that focused on a product?\n\n283\n00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.110\nNo.\n\n284\n00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.310\nOkay, so\nwhat about them providing an explicit\n\n285\n00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.960\nunderstanding of what\nthe project must deliver.\n\n286\n00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.420\nWell that's a product, right?\n\n287\n00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:45.280\nSo then that means that the answer is D.\n\n288\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.950\nWhat's a feature of PRINCE2?\n\n289\n00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:52.840\nNumber 47, is it a method specifically\ndesigned for technical projects?\n\n290\n00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.735\nNo, it can be applied to\nany project to be honest.\n\n291\n00:17:55.735 --> 00:17:57.350\nDoes it promote continual learning?\n\n292\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.290\nYes it does cuz we talk about\nlessons learned all the time.\n\n293\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.839\nDoes it include many\nmotivational techniques?\n\n294\n00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:09.390\nNo, not that I'm aware of anyway.\n\n295\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.660\nIs it designed to manage both projects and\nprograms?\n\n296\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:18.040\nNo because we actually had a methodology\nfor management of successful programs.\n\n297\n00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.710\nSo it is actually B in our lessons learnt.\n\n298\n00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.790\nNumber 47 then,\nwhich roles should not be combined?\n\n299\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.150\nWell, we know this.\n\n300\n00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.530\nIs it the project board,\nwhich is made up of a number of people and\n\n301\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.450\nthe change authority.\n\n302\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.098\nCould the person whose a change\nauthority sit in on the project board?\n\n303\n00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:41.020\nYes they could because the project\nboard is made up of many people.\n\n304\n00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.000\nAnd so, you're not necessarily\ngoing to get somebody who is,\n\n305\n00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.730\nyou're not going to get\na conflict of interest.\n\n306\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.110\nPut it that way.\nThe project manager and the team manager.\n\n307\n00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.490\nCould we combine those roles?\n\n308\n00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.440\nMost definitely because we're\ntalking about a small project.\n\n309\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.170\nThen most definitely,\nthose roles could be combined.\n\n310\n00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.780\nWhat about the executive and\nthe project managers?\n\n311\n00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.830\nSo one's going to manage and\none's going to direct.\n\n312\n00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.260\nCould we combine those roles?\n\n313\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.890\nWell, that sounds as though they could\npotentially be a conflict of interest\n\n314\n00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:16.030\nthere because you know what if the project\nmanager wants approval for something?\n\n315\n00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.760\nWell, if they're the executive then\nthey're just going to give approval to\n\n316\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.560\nthemselves anyway.\n\n317\n00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.079\nWhat about project manager and\nproject support?\n\n318\n00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:25.934\nHere, we can combine those.\n\n319\n00:19:25.934 --> 00:19:28.890\nYeah cuz project support is\nan administrational role, so\n\n320\n00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.710\nyes, they can be combined.\n\n321\n00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.200\nSo the answer then is same.\n\n322\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.300\nWhat is a characteristic of a project?\n\n323\n00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.780\nIs it low risk?\n\n324\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.420\nNo.\n\n325\n00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.450\nSome are quite high risk.\n\n326\n00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.880\nIt doesn't avoid stress and\nstrain between organizations?\n\n327\n00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.410\nNo, most definitely not.\n\n328\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.640\nAnd in fact, if we don't get that\ntransition from project to operations,\n\n329\n00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.450\nright, it's going to increase the strain.\n\n330\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.030\nWill it maintain business as usual?\n\n331\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.840\nNo, that's about operations.\n\n332\n00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.240\nSo, does it involve\ncross functional teams?\n\n333\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:19:59.850\nOf course it does.\n\n334\n00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:08.400\nSo question 50 then, which is an objective\nof the managing a stage boundary process?\n\n335\n00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.710\nSo we know that this happens\nat the end of every stage and\n\n336\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:16.990\nwe are handing over from\none stage to the next.\n\n337\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.430\nWe're authorizing movement\nto the next stage.\n\n338\n00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.900\nSo, what's an objective?\n\n339\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.380\nIs it to request authorization to\nstart the next stage, I'd say so.\n\n340\n00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.760\nIs it to ensure that all threats and\nopportunities for\n\n341\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.270\nthe current stage have been closed?\n\n342\n00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.100\nNo because sometimes we carry them over.\n\n343\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.298\nAnd all threats and opportunities,\nno, we don't always wanna close those,\n\n344\n00:20:37.298 --> 00:20:40.550\nlike I say, we carry them over,\nthat's our risk register.\n\n345\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.300\nWhat about C then?\n\n346\n00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.870\nTo ensure that work on products\nallocated to the team for\n\n347\n00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.830\nthe next stage is authorized.\n\n348\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.760\nThat's very specific, isn't it?\n\n349\n00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.390\nAll we're doing is just authorizing\nstarting on the next stage.\n\n350\n00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.240\nC sounds like something that\nthe team manager would do.\n\n351\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.050\nAnd what about to implement\nactions to resolve\n\n352\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.690\ntolerance deviations from the stage plan?\n\n353\n00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:07.340\nNo, that sounds like something\nthe project manager would impress\n\n354\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.060\nfrom the project board.\n\n355\n00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.315\nIt doesn't sound like something that\nwould happen as part of managing a stage\n\n356\n00:21:12.315 --> 00:21:14.780\nboudary, that could happen at any time.\n\n357\n00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.200\nSo of course the answer is A.\n\n358\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:23.290\n51 then, in which process is authorization\ngiven to deliver the project's product?\n\n359\n00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.430\nIs it starting up?\n\n360\n00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.630\nIs it initiating?\n\n361\n00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.970\nIs it managing a boundary or\nis it directing a project?\n\n362\n00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.925\nWell we know that directing a project\nis performed by a project board and\n\n363\n00:21:35.925 --> 00:21:40.810\nthey will give the authorization\nto actually deliver the products.\n\n364\n00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.010\nNot the project manager.\n\n365\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.546\nThey don't give the authorization\nto deliver the project or\n\n366\n00:21:46.546 --> 00:21:47.872\ndeliver the product.\n\n367\n00:21:47.872 --> 00:21:51.437\nIt's done by the project board,\nso it is D.\n\n368\n00:21:51.437 --> 00:21:54.605\nAnd number 52 then,\nwhat's a minimum requirement for\n\n369\n00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:57.130\napplying the business case theme?\n\n370\n00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.830\nShould we be documenting the\nresponsibility for defining standards for\n\n371\n00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.450\nthe business case?\n\n372\n00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.930\nYes, we should.\n\n373\n00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.500\nWe need to know what's gonna\nbe in our business case.\n\n374\n00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.230\nAnd I've already mentioned\nthat we should have templates.\n\n375\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.180\nAnd I mentioned this in previous episodes,\nwe want efficiency,\n\n376\n00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:19.110\nso we should have templates, so\nthat there should be minimum standards.\n\n377\n00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.800\nDo we want to appoint a senior user\nfrom an area of the business impacted\n\n378\n00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.610\nby the project?\n\n379\n00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.680\nIs that a minimum requirement?\n\n380\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.660\nIt's probably not a bad idea but\nit's not a minimum requirement.\n\n381\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.470\nDo we wanna have a benefits management\napproach approved by participants of\n\n382\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.600\nthe benefits reviews?\n\n383\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.250\nLet me repeat that again.\n\n384\n00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.510\nDo we want to have a benefits\nmanagement approach\n\n385\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.570\napproved by participants\nof benefits reviews?\n\n386\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.010\nIs that part of the business case?\n\n387\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.540\nNo, definitely not.\n\n388\n00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.700\nThat's part of benefits approach,\nbenefits management.\n\n389\n00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.400\nWhat about D then,\n\n390\n00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.250\ndelegating the development of business\njustification to the project manager?\n\n391\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.210\nIs that a minimum requirement?\n\n392\n00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.930\nNo.\nIt's something that could be done but\n\n393\n00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.480\nit's not a minimum requirement.\n\n394\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.900\nWhat about the project\ninitiation documentation,\n\n395\n00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.560\nhow is it used during\nthe closing of a project?\n\n396\n00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.140\nWell, I would say as a comparison,\nisn't it,\n\n397\n00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:19.680\nbetween this is what we wanted to do and\nhave we done it?\n\n398\n00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.520\nSo, A looks good,\nit's used as the basis for\n\n399\n00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.610\ncomparing the original aim to\nwhat was actually achieved.\n\n400\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.580\nProviding controls for\nthe final stage of the project?\n\n401\n00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.640\nNo, definitely not.\n\n402\n00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.010\nThis is an initiation documentation.\n\n403\n00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:38.060\nAnd what about, is it updated to include\nrelevant lessons from previous projects?\n\n404\n00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.532\nWell, it might be\nthroughout the project but\n\n405\n00:23:41.532 --> 00:23:43.960\nit's [LAUGH] certainly not during\nthe closing the project process.\n\n406\n00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.570\nDoes it provide the project\nproduct description for\n\n407\n00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.230\napproval by the project board that's\nright at the beginning of the project?\n\n408\n00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.100\nSo no, it's definitely A.\n\n409\n00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.254\nCommon sense approach here.\n\n410\n00:23:55.254 --> 00:23:59.596\nSo number 54 then,\nwhich process aims to ensure that during\n\n411\n00:23:59.596 --> 00:24:04.029\nthe project all parties understands\nThe project objectives.\n\n412\n00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:09.550\nRight, during the project,\nall project and all parties understand.\n\n413\n00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.620\nWell that's part of then initiating\nthe project, cuz it's about\n\n414\n00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:20.540\ngoing through the project and setting\nup a stakeholder communication plan.\n\n415\n00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.660\nThat's what we should be doing here.\n\n416\n00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.140\nDuring, and in fact, I was trying to get\nthat during C, initiating a project.\n\n417\n00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.745\nManaging a stage boundary,\nwhen do we undertake that?\n\n418\n00:24:32.745 --> 00:24:36.083\nWell, close to the end of\nevery single management stage,\n\n419\n00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:39.020\ncuz it gives us the authority\nto move on to the next.\n\n420\n00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:44.810\nSo, the only answer to that\none that makes any sense is A.\n\n421\n00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.240\nIt's at the end of every management stage.\n\n422\n00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.753\nSo number 56 then.\n\n423\n00:24:49.753 --> 00:24:52.249\nWhat is a project outcome?\n\n424\n00:24:52.249 --> 00:24:56.730\nWell a project outcome is\nwhat we are delivering.\n\n425\n00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.730\nSo it's the outcome that the user,\n\n426\n00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:05.360\nthe customer sees as a result\nof using the project's outputs.\n\n427\n00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.876\nSo, is it A then?\n\n428\n00:25:06.876 --> 00:25:10.620\nA measurable improvement that is\nperceived as an advantage by one or\n\n429\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.070\nmore stakeholders.\n\n430\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.870\nNo, because it's not one or\nmore stakeholders,\n\n431\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.410\nwe're talking about our customs here.\n\n432\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.460\nIs the outcome the reason for the project?\n\n433\n00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.900\nNo the outcome is what you achieve\n\n434\n00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:26.170\nby using the products\ndelivered by the project.\n\n435\n00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:30.220\nSo is it the results have changed\nderived from using the project's output?\n\n436\n00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.860\nYes, it is.\n\n437\n00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.690\nIt's certainly not a specialist product.\n\n438\n00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:39.887\nA product is different from an outcome,\nso it is C.\n\n439\n00:25:39.887 --> 00:25:42.140\nAnd what about number 57 then?\n\n440\n00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.870\nIdentify the missing words\nin the following sentence.\n\n441\n00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:51.276\nSix aspects of project\nperformance to be managed are,\n\n442\n00:25:51.276 --> 00:25:55.043\n[SOUND] cost and time scales and scope.\n\n443\n00:25:55.043 --> 00:25:57.660\nSo what else do we want to manage then?\n\n444\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.367\nWell we want to manage benefits,\nwe want to manage quality, and\n\n445\n00:26:02.367 --> 00:26:04.121\nwe want to manage risk.\n\n446\n00:26:04.121 --> 00:26:08.074\nThese are something that you're going\nto have to remember by the way,\n\n447\n00:26:08.074 --> 00:26:11.400\nbecause you need to be able\nto identify these, okay?\n\n448\n00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.390\nAnd the answer to this one is B.\n\n449\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.810\nIt is benefits and quality and risk.\n\n450\n00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.273\nThese are six aspects\nof project performance.\n\n451\n00:26:19.273 --> 00:26:23.647\nWe covered that way back in one of\nour very, very earlier episodes, so\n\n452\n00:26:23.647 --> 00:26:27.220\ntake a look back at that if\nyou didn't quite get that one.\n\n453\n00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:32.430\nSometimes the easiest ones are the ones\nthat you'll likely to miss in your test,\n\n454\n00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.260\nso be careful.\n\n455\n00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.356\nSo question number 58 then,\n\n456\n00:26:36.356 --> 00:26:40.789\nwhich management stages must a PRINCE2\nproject consist of, as a minimum?\n\n457\n00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:44.540\nWe know we need to have at\nleast two stages, don't we?\n\n458\n00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.100\nSo we need to have an initiation stage,\nand\n\n459\n00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.800\nthen we need to have at least one other\nstage that covers the rest of the project.\n\n460\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.740\nSo, we know we need at least two.\n\n461\n00:26:55.082 --> 00:27:00.540\nSo and number A says, starting up\ninitiation and at least one other.\n\n462\n00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.780\nNo, well that makes it three.\n\n463\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.825\nSo that's not right.\n\n464\n00:27:02.825 --> 00:27:07.320\nB says, at least one stage for\ndeveloping and the closing stage.\n\n465\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.450\nWell what about startup?\n\n466\n00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.650\nWe need an initiation.\n\n467\n00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.632\nC says initiation in at\nleast one other stage.\n\n468\n00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:15.480\nOkay, that's right.\n\n469\n00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:20.590\nD says initiation and at least one stage\nfor developing and the closing stage.\n\n470\n00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.700\nNo you can combine developing stage and\n\n471\n00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.000\nthe closing stage, so\ntherefore the answer is C.\n\n472\n00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.750\nWhich statement about project\nstakeholders is correct?\n\n473\n00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:35.950\nA stakeholder is anybody who is\ninterested, it's an interested party.\n\n474\n00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.400\nSo must all stakeholders be identified\nat the start of the project?\n\n475\n00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.075\nThat doesn't make any sense, does it?\n\n476\n00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:44.240\nCuz quite often you can't\nidentify them all straightaway.\n\n477\n00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.940\nSometimes they just keep sort of\ncoming out of the woodwork, right?\n\n478\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.150\nSo, it's not A.\n\n479\n00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:49.788\nWhat about B?\n\n480\n00:27:49.788 --> 00:27:52.570\nAre all stakeholders members\nof the project board?\n\n481\n00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.070\nCan you imagine the size\nof the project board and\n\n482\n00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.860\nthe length of the meetings\nif that were the case.\n\n483\n00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.100\nNo, are all stakeholders external?\n\n484\n00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.981\nNo, definitely not.\n\n485\n00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:06.888\nAll three principal categories of\nstakeholder have their interest\n\n486\n00:28:06.888 --> 00:28:09.080\nrepresented by the project board.\n\n487\n00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:15.360\nThat's right, that's the users, the\nsuppliers, and the project team itself.\n\n488\n00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.759\nSo, three principle categories of\nstakeholder, and that's right.\n\n489\n00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:22.474\nSo the answer there is D.\n\n490\n00:28:22.474 --> 00:28:26.004\nAnd now our last question then,\non this sample paper,\n\n491\n00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:29.170\nwhat should be provided\nby the project mandate?\n\n492\n00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.650\nWell, it's at the beginning\nof the project, and\n\n493\n00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.420\nthe project mandate is our terms\nof reference for a project.\n\n494\n00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.570\nSo the answer there is A.\n\n495\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:44.810\nIt's not a detailed business case, this\nis just the mandate to start a project.\n\n496\n00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:49.080\nIt's not specific tolerances, and\nit's not a plan for the initiation stage,\n\n497\n00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.490\nbecause they are way too detailed for\na mandate.\n\n498\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.460\nSo the answer there is A.\n\n499\n00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.580\nSo how did you get on?\n\n500\n00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:05.300\nYou've got to get 33,\nthat's 33 out of 60 in order to pass.\n\n501\n00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.357\nHopefully everybody passed.\n\n502\n00:29:07.357 --> 00:29:11.265\nBut if you didn't,\nthen the one's that you've failed,\n\n503\n00:29:11.265 --> 00:29:14.630\nmake a note of the ones that\nyou failed and go back.\n\n504\n00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.405\nTake a look at those episodes again and\n\n505\n00:29:17.405 --> 00:29:23.052\nsee if there is anything that you need\nto study again before you sit your test.\n\n506\n00:29:23.052 --> 00:29:27.179\nBut at this point in time,\nyou're now ready to sit your live test, so\n\n507\n00:29:27.179 --> 00:29:29.930\nI'm gonna wish you good luck.\n\n508\n00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.841\nAnd let us know how you get on,\nbecause I'm always interested to hear.\n\n509\n00:29:35.803 --> 00:29:40.738\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
