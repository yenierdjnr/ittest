Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n4\n00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.860\nIn today's episode we're gonna be talking\nabout professional development and\n\n5\n00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.490\nspecifically advanced communications.\n\n6\n00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.600\nAnd here to help us with that we\nhave John Spence who is an author,\n\n7\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.100\na speaker, a businessman, an entrepreneur.\n\n8\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.772\nJohn, tell us a little bit about yourself.\n\n9\n00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:29.900\n&gt;&gt; I began my early career at\nthe Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n10\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.800\nAt age 26, I was named CEO of that\nfoundation overseeing projects in\n\n11\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.660\nabout 20 countries around the world.\n\n12\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.800\nSince then, I've been the owner or\nCEO of five other firms, three of them\n\n13\n00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.910\ninternational, written about seven books\nand for the last 20 years, I've traveled\n\n14\n00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.340\nall over the world to help businesses and\npeople improve and be more successful.\n\n15\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.270\n&gt;&gt; Great, well, I think a great\nplace to start that journey\n\n16\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.080\nin professional development is\nwith advanced communications and\n\n17\n00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.190\nwhat we're talking about today.\n\n18\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.300\nAnd so when I think about communications,\nI think about talking, and\n\n19\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.870\nasking questions and then listening.\n\n20\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.380\nSo where do you wanna start today?\n\n21\n00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, you put it in the order\nthat most people think about it,\n\n22\n00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.820\nwhich is talking first.\n\n23\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.290\nBut in a lot of the research I've done,\nlooking at people that\n\n24\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.440\nreally admire communicators,\nit's actually asking questions and\n\n25\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.850\nlistening are the two\nmost important skills.\n\n26\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.880\nSo, we're gonna start with some\nadvanced questioning skills.\n\n27\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.620\nAnd here is the big idea with this,\n\n28\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.950\nis the quality of your questions\ndetermine the quality of your answers.\n\n29\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.610\nAnd if your really trying to get good\nsolid information from the person\n\n30\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.380\nyou are talking too, it's essential\nthat you take the time to ask really\n\n31\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.030\npointed questions that is gonna get you\nthe answers and the information you need.\n\n32\n00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.470\nAnd there is a couple of tricks to that,\na couple of tools.\n\n33\n00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.530\nAnd the first tool I like\nis one called cushions.\n\n34\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.940\nAnd what a cushion does is it says\nbecause I read some information,\n\n35\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.690\nbecause I saw something, I now need\nto ask you this detailed question.\n\n36\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.840\nSo it sounds something like I was\nlooking over the email you sent me and\n\n37\n00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.070\nreading about the problems\nyou're expressing and\n\n38\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.830\nI was wondering if you can take about two\nor three minutes and help me understand,\n\n39\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.950\nin as much detail as possible,\nexactly where you think you need help.\n\n40\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.550\nSo what I've done there, is I've said,\nI'm not just gonna bullet point you,\n\n41\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.105\nYou know,\nI need you to tell me what's going on.\n\n42\n00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:14.190\nSo I'm gonna ease into that question.\n\n43\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.300\nSee there's a reason I'm asking\nthis sort of a question.\n\n44\n00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.020\nSo that's a cushion.\n\n45\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.950\nThe condition also does something like\nthat which says I've studied this,\n\n46\n00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.850\nI've talked to someone on my team, there's\nsome new data that just came out, or\n\n47\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.080\na new version of the software,\nwhatever whatever it might be.\n\n48\n00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.950\nAnd because of this new condition, I've\nnow got to ask you some more information.\n\n49\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.560\nSo that one, again,\n\n50\n00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.320\nwould sound like I understand that there's\nbeen some issues in your department.\n\n51\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.745\nIt's probably because we\ninstalled a different version.\n\n52\n00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:48.065\nBecause of that can I take a minute and\nget you to give me some feedback on this.\n\n53\n00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.695\nSo the cushioning is in.\n\n54\n00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:54.045\nThe condition always uses the piece of\ninformation as the driver of the question.\n\n55\n00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:56.855\nThe next thing I like are scale questions.\n\n56\n00:02:56.855 --> 00:03:01.816\nAnd these are real easy, I use them a ton\nmyself which is on a scale of one to ten,\n\n57\n00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:03.770\nhow challenging is this issue?\n\n58\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.780\nHow bad is the problem?\n\n59\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.280\nAnd if someone says a nine, you go,\nokay I've got an emergency here.\n\n60\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.430\nI've got to work on it.\n\n61\n00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.950\nIf they go a three you go, great.\n\n62\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.700\nWell, let's get to it.\n\n63\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.630\nWe can put it in the queue or\nwherever it might be.\n\n64\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.240\nThe other way I like to use\nthese is comfort level.\n\n65\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.940\nSo I bring someone something new to\nlook at, some new system to work on.\n\n66\n00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.200\nAnd they've never seen it before.\n\n67\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.748\nAnd I say on a scale of one to ten,\n\n68\n00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:30.900\nwith ten being I'm super comfortable,\nI understand this, got it, no problem,\n\n69\n00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.935\nand one being, I don't understand\nthis at all, where are you right now?\n\n70\n00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:38.210\n[LAUGH] And again,\nif they say three, you go uh-oh.\n\n71\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.260\nWhat will it take to get you to a five,\nor to a seven, or to a nine?\n\n72\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.500\nSo those scale questions are a good way\nto make it easy for someone to tell you\n\n73\n00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.740\nhow they feel, their level of concern,\nhow well they're understanding things.\n\n74\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.390\nThe next one is a real fun one and\nprobably going to work great for\n\n75\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.330\nIT people, is what I call expansion or\ncontraction questions.\n\n76\n00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.460\nAn expansion question is when you've got\nsomeone that you ask them a question and\n\n77\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.678\nthey just answer it with yes or no.\n\n78\n00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:09.179\n[SOUND] Yeah,\nthis is not helping me at all.\n\n79\n00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:13.871\nSo an expansion question says could you\ntake two or three minutes and share with\n\n80\n00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:19.190\nme everything you're concerned about so\nI can really understand your problem?\n\n81\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.420\nSo I'm forcing through the question to get\nthe person to give me more information,\n\n82\n00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.480\nmore data,\nnot just answer it with a yes or a no.\n\n83\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.470\nThe reverse of that id when you get\nsomeone that you ask them a question and\n\n84\n00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.940\nthey go on 15 minutes and\ntell you everything that's ever happened.\n\n85\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.170\nFirst time they saw a computer,\nfirst time they ever had a laptop.\n\n86\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.170\nAnd all this information you don't need.\n\n87\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.760\nOn a contraction question, you go could\nyou just take one minute or less and\n\n88\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.490\nshare with me the single\nmost important thing\n\n89\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.860\nyou think I need to know\nabout this situation?\n\n90\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.200\nSo one says, talk a long the time, the\nother one says basically just shut up and\n\n91\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.870\ntell me what I need to know.\n\n92\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.670\nAnd then the last one is what\nI all relationship questions.\n\n93\n00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.310\nAnd what relationship\nquestions are all about.\n\n94\n00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.849\nDoes this feel comfortable to you?\n\n95\n00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.010\nDoes it seem like I'm on track with you?\n\n96\n00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.203\nDo you feel like everything is going okay?\n\n97\n00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:08.500\nSo I've hit the logical\nquestions of asking for data.\n\n98\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.720\nNow I'm asking relationship or emotional\nquestions to see do they feel okay?\n\n99\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.330\nAm I going at a good pace?\n\n100\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.450\nAm I teaching them things they need to do?\n\n101\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.190\nAm I solving the problems that they have?\n\n102\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.022\nSo that they feel good about\nhow I'm interacting with them.\n\n103\n00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:24.650\n&gt;&gt; All right John,\nI never actually realized there were\n\n104\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.860\nthat many different types of questions but\nI guess it doesn't matter\n\n105\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.830\nwhat kind of questions you ask if you\ndon't take time to listen to the answers.\n\n106\n00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.130\nSo what are some tips there to\nhelp us kind of listen better?\n\n107\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you put it real well Peter.\n\n108\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.510\nStep one is you've got to be insanely\ncurious and ask great questions.\n\n109\n00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.830\nAnd in the words I like to use,\nyou've got to be an intense listener.\n\n110\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.290\nAnd there's five levels of listening.\n\n111\n00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.430\nSo let's go through those.\n\n112\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.120\nLevel one is not listening.\n\n113\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.628\nNot paying attention at all.\n\n114\n00:05:49.628 --> 00:05:52.600\nNot, looking down at your cell phone,\nnot looking up at all and\n\n115\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.375\nbeing completely out of the conversation.\n\n116\n00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:58.720\nLevel two is distracted listening and\nin distracted listening,\n\n117\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.130\nnow you're looking at your monitor, you're\nchecking your texts, you're doing things.\n\n118\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.450\nAnd you're kind of nodding and\nlooking up every now and then.\n\n119\n00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.300\nBut they can tell you're not\nreally in the conversation.\n\n120\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.270\nLevel three is listening to answer.\n\n121\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.980\nAnd this is what a lot of people do.\n\n122\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.490\nI hear you talking, but\nthe whole time you're talking,\n\n123\n00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.440\nI'm thinking about how am I gonna\nanswer this, how can I fix the problem,\n\n124\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.450\nwhat am I gonna say next,\nwhat do I say to look good.\n\n125\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.420\nSo you're only partially listening and\n\n126\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.760\nmostly thinking in your head about what\nyou wanna say when they finally shut up.\n\n127\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.800\nThe next level is attentive listening.\n\n128\n00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.160\nAnd in attentive listening,\nyou're doing the things you need to.\n\n129\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.930\nYou've got good body language.\n\n130\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.890\nYou're paying attention.\n\n131\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.340\nYou're using head nods.\n\n132\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.830\nYou're catching their information.\n\n133\n00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.120\nYou're paraphrasing and\n\n134\n00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.260\nsummarizing which are two really\nimportant tools in listening.\n\n135\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.460\nParaphrasing, well let me go backwards.\n\n136\n00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.750\nSummarizing says,\nI listened to you and I heard you.\n\n137\n00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.550\nYou just said, a, b, c,\nand d, is that correct?\n\n138\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.280\nI can summarize the information\nyou gave me exactly.\n\n139\n00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.580\nAnd that shows you're listening,\nthat's really great.\n\n140\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.180\nParaphrasing on the other hand says,\nI listened to you carefully enough that I\n\n141\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.958\ncan reword what you just said,reword and\nsay it in my own words.\n\n142\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.644\nIn other words,you just said a,b,c and\nd but\n\n143\n00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:14.730\nto me it sounds like\nwhat you mean is x,y,z.\n\n144\n00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.010\nIs that correct?\n\n145\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.400\nAnd if the other person looks at you and\nsays yes.\n\n146\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.090\nWhat they've realized is this\nperson listened so well that they\n\n147\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.333\nunderstood what I said and gave it back to\nme in a different way that I agree with.\n\n148\n00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:27.770\nSo that's attentive listening.\n\n149\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.050\nIt's got the body language,\nsummarizing, paraphrasing.\n\n150\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.540\nThe highest level is intense listening.\n\n151\n00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.720\nAnd at this level you're actually\nhearing things that aren't being said.\n\n152\n00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.410\nAnd a lot of this is around empathy,\nand emotion, and\n\n153\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.390\nlooking for people who are upset,\nor frustrated, or\n\n154\n00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:48.270\nconfused, and being able to see from their\nbody language that even though you're\n\n155\n00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.280\nlistening in they're talking, that you're\nnot really making an emotional connection.\n\n156\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.700\nAnd that last level\ndoesn't happen very often,\n\n157\n00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.010\nthat's usually only between very very\nclose friends, spouses, things like that.\n\n158\n00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.106\nOnly about 30 % of people reach\neven the active listening level.\n\n159\n00:08:03.106 --> 00:08:07.720\nSo one of the biggest problems\nin almost all organizations is\n\n160\n00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.670\npoor communications and one of the number\none limiting factors in people's careers\n\n161\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.370\nis not being able to communicate\nefficiently and listen intensely.\n\n162\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.980\n&gt;&gt; John I think on that one I was the\nthird one I was listening to the answer\n\n163\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.640\nbecause I was kind of getting ready for\nmy next questions here.\n\n164\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.840\nBut once I learned that was that\nwas maybe not the best way to go I\n\n165\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.320\ntried to focus up a little bit.\n\n166\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.140\nBut you mentioned some things\nlike repeating the answer back,\n\n167\n00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.590\nare there any other tips to\nhelp us be better listeners?\n\n168\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the things that I use,\n\n169\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.590\ngreat question,\nis what I call calming the monkey mind.\n\n170\n00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.580\nAnd the monkey mind is that voice that's\nrunning in your head the whole time.\n\n171\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.890\nSometimes thinking of\nwhat you're gonna answer.\n\n172\n00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.402\nBut it's going on and on and on,\nand it sounds just like this.\n\n173\n00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:55.236\nOkay right now you're going,\nwhy isn't John talking, what's he doing,\n\n174\n00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:56.690\ndid my video freeze?\n\n175\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.840\nThat's the mind that runs in your head,\nand one of the ways to be an exceptional\n\n176\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.000\nlistener is to get rid of the monkey\nmind by replacing it with repeating what\n\n177\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.630\nthe other person is saying, over and over\nagain in your head as they're talking, so\n\n178\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.060\nagain I'll use my, okay they're talking\nabout a, talking about a and b.\n\n179\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.210\nA, and b, and c.\n\n180\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.650\nC is most important, a is second\nimportant, b is third important.\n\n181\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.740\nA,b,c and then when they stop you guys,\nlisten to you very carefully, and\n\n182\n00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.720\nyou talked about three things, a,b and\nc, c is the most important to you.\n\n183\n00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.780\nA is the second most important and\nc is the most important.\n\n184\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.760\nAnd what's neat about that is that they\nmight say it once You've heard it 10,\n\n185\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.370\n15, 20 times in your mind by repeating it,\nand it gives you a great memory for\n\n186\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.830\nwhat you actually discussed.\n\n187\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.130\n&gt;&gt; That's great John, so it sounds like\nit's not only important how you listen,\n\n188\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.980\nbut kind of how your body's\nreacting as well, and\n\n189\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.470\nwhat you're doing while you're listening.\n\n190\n00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nactually they say that about 73% or more,\n\n191\n00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.320\ncould be all the way up to 93%\nof communications is non verbal.\n\n192\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.680\nYour body language,\neye contact, how open you are,\n\n193\n00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.130\nyour vocal inflection, your tone,\nall of that adds to the message.\n\n194\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.940\nAnd sometimes, if done poorly,\nit can outdo the message,\n\n195\n00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.840\nyou can't actually hear it.\n\n196\n00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.470\nSo, when you look at it,\nyou wanna do things like this,\n\n197\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.990\nand I'll look to you to be\nable to do this together.\n\n198\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:19.170\nYou wanna open up and\nhave a good stance, you wanna be able to\n\n199\n00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.400\nlook the person in the eye, but not\nstaring down, just sort of make points.\n\n200\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.510\nI think taking notes is critical if\nyou're gonna ask important questions,\n\n201\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.840\nyou wanna take good notes, so it's\nan open stance, leaning in, taking notes,\n\n202\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.180\nusing nod heads,\nkeeping square to the person.\n\n203\n00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.460\nAlso using nonverbal, or verbal cues for\n\n204\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.080\nshowing them that you're listening\nby going, mm-hm, yeah, I got that.\n\n205\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.170\nI heard that, yeah, I'm listening.\n\n206\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.970\nNot I agree, because if they say\nsomething you don't agree with\n\n207\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.010\nI've caught people that go,\nyes, I agree, I agree, I agree.\n\n208\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.395\nThen you say something you know they\ndon't agree with and they go, I agree.\n\n209\n00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:51.100\nYou're not listening to me.\n\n210\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.950\nSo you've gotta match your body language,\nshowing intently that you're listening.\n\n211\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.090\nIt's important I'm not\nlooking at anything.\n\n212\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.400\nI'm not distracted.\n\n213\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.260\nI'm taking notes.\n\n214\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.230\nI'm smiling.\n\n215\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.590\nI've got everything going,\nwhile I'm paraphrasing, summarizing, and\n\n216\n00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.160\nasking superb questions.\n\n217\n00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.410\nIf you can put that package together,\n\n218\n00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.080\nthat will really allow you to be\na much more effective communicator.\n\n219\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and John, I think it's, really,\nespecially important to be taking notes\n\n220\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.770\nwhen we're talking about more technical\ntopics like you might be in IT.\n\n221\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.230\nOtherwise it maybe looks like you're\nreally not paying that much attention, or\n\n222\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.750\nit could be worrisome to the person\npresenting that you're not\n\n223\n00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.520\npaying attention it makes me\nthink about in restaurants when\n\n224\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.210\nthe waiter is taking your order and\nnot writing down what you're saying, and\n\n225\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.240\nI just know it's not gonna work\nout well in that situation.\n\n226\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's one of my pet peeves too.\n\n227\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.750\nI love it when you got ten\npeople at a table, they come up,\n\n228\n00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.070\nthey just stand there,\nyou make your order.\n\n229\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.650\nAnd you know this is not coming out right.\n\n230\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.300\nThere's no way it's gonna happen.\n\n231\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.240\nWell, you make a great point because\nthis is exactly the same thing that\n\n232\n00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.820\nhappens if someone is, if you ask a great\nquestion that's highly focused and\n\n233\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.000\nsomeone takes the time to give you\nan in depth, robust answer and\n\n234\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.720\nyou don't write anything down,\nyou know what you've just told them?\n\n235\n00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.170\nI wasn't listening.\n\n236\n00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.950\nSo the key idea here is you want to\nuse all that body language I was\n\n237\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.140\ntalking about, leaning in, smiling, head\nnods, and writing really good notes so\n\n238\n00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.690\nthat as you go between them they're\nseeing you take all these notes.\n\n239\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.260\nAnd I use a couple of tricks for this.\n\n240\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.570\nIf I hear them say something important\nI will put a big star next to it.\n\n241\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.250\nAnd that way as they're talking,\nI've got it, and I'm nodding, and\n\n242\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.950\nwe're going along.\n\n243\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.339\nAnd then they say it again,\nI'll put another star and maybe a one.\n\n244\n00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:25.442\nAnd then they'll keep going and\nit'll be another star.\n\n245\n00:12:25.442 --> 00:12:29.789\nAnd what that allows me to do is when\nthey've finally finished talking, I've got\n\n246\n00:12:29.789 --> 00:12:34.010\nthree or four areas that I know their\npriorities, I've got four of five stars,\n\n247\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.042\nI use a pound sign for numbers,\nI got a big clock for time.\n\n248\n00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:39.824\nSo I say here's the numbers you\nshared with me, the amount of time\n\n249\n00:12:39.824 --> 00:12:42.822\nyou think it'll take and\nhere's the three major things you covered.\n\n250\n00:12:42.822 --> 00:12:45.902\nAnd that's a really clear\nindication that I'd been listening,\n\n251\n00:12:45.902 --> 00:12:48.982\nthe information they're giving\nme is extremely important, and\n\n252\n00:12:48.982 --> 00:12:52.290\nI've written it all down,\nwhich means I will remember it.\n\n253\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.080\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI would've written down more here, John,\n\n254\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.990\nbut you've got some great\nnotes that you gave me.\n\n255\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.690\nBut I think, looking at the clock now,\nwe're about out of time for this episode.\n\n256\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:04.910\nAre there any other key takeaways, looking\nback at the things we've discussed,\n\n257\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.820\nin terms of questions and\nlistening and body language?\n\n258\n00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the most important\nthing to remember about this,\n\n259\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.610\nthis is a learned skill.\n\n260\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.470\nThis isn't something you\njust practice once or\n\n261\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.220\ntry that it takes years of practice.\n\n262\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.530\nI mean I've been teaching this for\n20 years and I still struggle with it.\n\n263\n00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.500\nSo asking great questions,\nbeing very curious,\n\n264\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.570\nan intense listener, taking fantastic\nnotes and having wonderful body language.\n\n265\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.670\nThe more you practice it,\nthe better you'll get.\n\n266\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.770\nAnd you can look up in a year or two and\n\n267\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.390\nyou will have completely changed the way\nyou communicate with other people,\n\n268\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.390\nwhich will be a huge positive\nboost in your career.\n\n269\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.000\n&gt;&gt; Well thanks John,\n\n270\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.720\nI think that's a great look at some of\nthe advanced communication skills and\n\n271\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.920\ncertainly it gonna help us in\nour professional development.\n\n272\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.560\nAnd I know we have a lot more\nof professional development\n\n273\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.080\nskills to talk about coming up in future\nepisodes but that's gonna do it for\n\n274\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.340\nus, on this episode.\n\n275\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.730\nSo, going ahead and\nsigning off for BizProTV.\n\n276\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.440\nI've been your host Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n277\n00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm John Spence.\n\n278\n00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.385\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n279\n00:14:01.976 --> 00:14:11.976\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
