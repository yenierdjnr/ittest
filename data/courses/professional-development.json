Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n4\n00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.860\nIn today's episode we're gonna be talking\nabout professional development and\n\n5\n00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.490\nspecifically advanced communications.\n\n6\n00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.600\nAnd here to help us with that we\nhave John Spence who is an author,\n\n7\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.100\na speaker, a businessman, an entrepreneur.\n\n8\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.772\nJohn, tell us a little bit about yourself.\n\n9\n00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:29.900\n&gt;&gt; I began my early career at\nthe Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n10\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.800\nAt age 26, I was named CEO of that\nfoundation overseeing projects in\n\n11\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.660\nabout 20 countries around the world.\n\n12\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.800\nSince then, I've been the owner or\nCEO of five other firms, three of them\n\n13\n00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.910\ninternational, written about seven books\nand for the last 20 years, I've traveled\n\n14\n00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.340\nall over the world to help businesses and\npeople improve and be more successful.\n\n15\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.270\n&gt;&gt; Great, well, I think a great\nplace to start that journey\n\n16\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.080\nin professional development is\nwith advanced communications and\n\n17\n00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.190\nwhat we're talking about today.\n\n18\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.300\nAnd so when I think about communications,\nI think about talking, and\n\n19\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.870\nasking questions and then listening.\n\n20\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.380\nSo where do you wanna start today?\n\n21\n00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, you put it in the order\nthat most people think about it,\n\n22\n00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.820\nwhich is talking first.\n\n23\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.290\nBut in a lot of the research I've done,\nlooking at people that\n\n24\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.440\nreally admire communicators,\nit's actually asking questions and\n\n25\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.850\nlistening are the two\nmost important skills.\n\n26\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.880\nSo, we're gonna start with some\nadvanced questioning skills.\n\n27\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.620\nAnd here is the big idea with this,\n\n28\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.950\nis the quality of your questions\ndetermine the quality of your answers.\n\n29\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.610\nAnd if your really trying to get good\nsolid information from the person\n\n30\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.380\nyou are talking too, it's essential\nthat you take the time to ask really\n\n31\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.030\npointed questions that is gonna get you\nthe answers and the information you need.\n\n32\n00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.470\nAnd there is a couple of tricks to that,\na couple of tools.\n\n33\n00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.530\nAnd the first tool I like\nis one called cushions.\n\n34\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.940\nAnd what a cushion does is it says\nbecause I read some information,\n\n35\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.690\nbecause I saw something, I now need\nto ask you this detailed question.\n\n36\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.840\nSo it sounds something like I was\nlooking over the email you sent me and\n\n37\n00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.070\nreading about the problems\nyou're expressing and\n\n38\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.830\nI was wondering if you can take about two\nor three minutes and help me understand,\n\n39\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.950\nin as much detail as possible,\nexactly where you think you need help.\n\n40\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.550\nSo what I've done there, is I've said,\nI'm not just gonna bullet point you,\n\n41\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.105\nYou know,\nI need you to tell me what's going on.\n\n42\n00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:14.190\nSo I'm gonna ease into that question.\n\n43\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.300\nSee there's a reason I'm asking\nthis sort of a question.\n\n44\n00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.020\nSo that's a cushion.\n\n45\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.950\nThe condition also does something like\nthat which says I've studied this,\n\n46\n00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.850\nI've talked to someone on my team, there's\nsome new data that just came out, or\n\n47\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.080\na new version of the software,\nwhatever whatever it might be.\n\n48\n00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.950\nAnd because of this new condition, I've\nnow got to ask you some more information.\n\n49\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.560\nSo that one, again,\n\n50\n00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.320\nwould sound like I understand that there's\nbeen some issues in your department.\n\n51\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.745\nIt's probably because we\ninstalled a different version.\n\n52\n00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:48.065\nBecause of that can I take a minute and\nget you to give me some feedback on this.\n\n53\n00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.695\nSo the cushioning is in.\n\n54\n00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:54.045\nThe condition always uses the piece of\ninformation as the driver of the question.\n\n55\n00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:56.855\nThe next thing I like are scale questions.\n\n56\n00:02:56.855 --> 00:03:01.816\nAnd these are real easy, I use them a ton\nmyself which is on a scale of one to ten,\n\n57\n00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:03.770\nhow challenging is this issue?\n\n58\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.780\nHow bad is the problem?\n\n59\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.280\nAnd if someone says a nine, you go,\nokay I've got an emergency here.\n\n60\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.430\nI've got to work on it.\n\n61\n00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.950\nIf they go a three you go, great.\n\n62\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.700\nWell, let's get to it.\n\n63\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.630\nWe can put it in the queue or\nwherever it might be.\n\n64\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.240\nThe other way I like to use\nthese is comfort level.\n\n65\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.940\nSo I bring someone something new to\nlook at, some new system to work on.\n\n66\n00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.200\nAnd they've never seen it before.\n\n67\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.748\nAnd I say on a scale of one to ten,\n\n68\n00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:30.900\nwith ten being I'm super comfortable,\nI understand this, got it, no problem,\n\n69\n00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.935\nand one being, I don't understand\nthis at all, where are you right now?\n\n70\n00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:38.210\n[LAUGH] And again,\nif they say three, you go uh-oh.\n\n71\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.260\nWhat will it take to get you to a five,\nor to a seven, or to a nine?\n\n72\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.500\nSo those scale questions are a good way\nto make it easy for someone to tell you\n\n73\n00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.740\nhow they feel, their level of concern,\nhow well they're understanding things.\n\n74\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.390\nThe next one is a real fun one and\nprobably going to work great for\n\n75\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.330\nIT people, is what I call expansion or\ncontraction questions.\n\n76\n00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.460\nAn expansion question is when you've got\nsomeone that you ask them a question and\n\n77\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.678\nthey just answer it with yes or no.\n\n78\n00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:09.179\n[SOUND] Yeah,\nthis is not helping me at all.\n\n79\n00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:13.871\nSo an expansion question says could you\ntake two or three minutes and share with\n\n80\n00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:19.190\nme everything you're concerned about so\nI can really understand your problem?\n\n81\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.420\nSo I'm forcing through the question to get\nthe person to give me more information,\n\n82\n00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.480\nmore data,\nnot just answer it with a yes or a no.\n\n83\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.470\nThe reverse of that id when you get\nsomeone that you ask them a question and\n\n84\n00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.940\nthey go on 15 minutes and\ntell you everything that's ever happened.\n\n85\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.170\nFirst time they saw a computer,\nfirst time they ever had a laptop.\n\n86\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.170\nAnd all this information you don't need.\n\n87\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.760\nOn a contraction question, you go could\nyou just take one minute or less and\n\n88\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.490\nshare with me the single\nmost important thing\n\n89\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.860\nyou think I need to know\nabout this situation?\n\n90\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.200\nSo one says, talk a long the time, the\nother one says basically just shut up and\n\n91\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.870\ntell me what I need to know.\n\n92\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.670\nAnd then the last one is what\nI all relationship questions.\n\n93\n00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.310\nAnd what relationship\nquestions are all about.\n\n94\n00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.849\nDoes this feel comfortable to you?\n\n95\n00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.010\nDoes it seem like I'm on track with you?\n\n96\n00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.203\nDo you feel like everything is going okay?\n\n97\n00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:08.500\nSo I've hit the logical\nquestions of asking for data.\n\n98\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.720\nNow I'm asking relationship or emotional\nquestions to see do they feel okay?\n\n99\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.330\nAm I going at a good pace?\n\n100\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.450\nAm I teaching them things they need to do?\n\n101\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.190\nAm I solving the problems that they have?\n\n102\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.022\nSo that they feel good about\nhow I'm interacting with them.\n\n103\n00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:24.650\n&gt;&gt; All right John,\nI never actually realized there were\n\n104\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.860\nthat many different types of questions but\nI guess it doesn't matter\n\n105\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.830\nwhat kind of questions you ask if you\ndon't take time to listen to the answers.\n\n106\n00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.130\nSo what are some tips there to\nhelp us kind of listen better?\n\n107\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you put it real well Peter.\n\n108\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.510\nStep one is you've got to be insanely\ncurious and ask great questions.\n\n109\n00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.830\nAnd in the words I like to use,\nyou've got to be an intense listener.\n\n110\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.290\nAnd there's five levels of listening.\n\n111\n00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.430\nSo let's go through those.\n\n112\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.120\nLevel one is not listening.\n\n113\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.628\nNot paying attention at all.\n\n114\n00:05:49.628 --> 00:05:52.600\nNot, looking down at your cell phone,\nnot looking up at all and\n\n115\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.375\nbeing completely out of the conversation.\n\n116\n00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:58.720\nLevel two is distracted listening and\nin distracted listening,\n\n117\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.130\nnow you're looking at your monitor, you're\nchecking your texts, you're doing things.\n\n118\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.450\nAnd you're kind of nodding and\nlooking up every now and then.\n\n119\n00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.300\nBut they can tell you're not\nreally in the conversation.\n\n120\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.270\nLevel three is listening to answer.\n\n121\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.980\nAnd this is what a lot of people do.\n\n122\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.490\nI hear you talking, but\nthe whole time you're talking,\n\n123\n00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.440\nI'm thinking about how am I gonna\nanswer this, how can I fix the problem,\n\n124\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.450\nwhat am I gonna say next,\nwhat do I say to look good.\n\n125\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.420\nSo you're only partially listening and\n\n126\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.760\nmostly thinking in your head about what\nyou wanna say when they finally shut up.\n\n127\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.800\nThe next level is attentive listening.\n\n128\n00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.160\nAnd in attentive listening,\nyou're doing the things you need to.\n\n129\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.930\nYou've got good body language.\n\n130\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.890\nYou're paying attention.\n\n131\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.340\nYou're using head nods.\n\n132\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.830\nYou're catching their information.\n\n133\n00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.120\nYou're paraphrasing and\n\n134\n00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.260\nsummarizing which are two really\nimportant tools in listening.\n\n135\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.460\nParaphrasing, well let me go backwards.\n\n136\n00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.750\nSummarizing says,\nI listened to you and I heard you.\n\n137\n00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.550\nYou just said, a, b, c,\nand d, is that correct?\n\n138\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.280\nI can summarize the information\nyou gave me exactly.\n\n139\n00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.580\nAnd that shows you're listening,\nthat's really great.\n\n140\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.180\nParaphrasing on the other hand says,\nI listened to you carefully enough that I\n\n141\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.958\ncan reword what you just said,reword and\nsay it in my own words.\n\n142\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.644\nIn other words,you just said a,b,c and\nd but\n\n143\n00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:14.730\nto me it sounds like\nwhat you mean is x,y,z.\n\n144\n00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.010\nIs that correct?\n\n145\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.400\nAnd if the other person looks at you and\nsays yes.\n\n146\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.090\nWhat they've realized is this\nperson listened so well that they\n\n147\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.333\nunderstood what I said and gave it back to\nme in a different way that I agree with.\n\n148\n00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:27.770\nSo that's attentive listening.\n\n149\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.050\nIt's got the body language,\nsummarizing, paraphrasing.\n\n150\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.540\nThe highest level is intense listening.\n\n151\n00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.720\nAnd at this level you're actually\nhearing things that aren't being said.\n\n152\n00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.410\nAnd a lot of this is around empathy,\nand emotion, and\n\n153\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.390\nlooking for people who are upset,\nor frustrated, or\n\n154\n00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:48.270\nconfused, and being able to see from their\nbody language that even though you're\n\n155\n00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.280\nlistening in they're talking, that you're\nnot really making an emotional connection.\n\n156\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.700\nAnd that last level\ndoesn't happen very often,\n\n157\n00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.010\nthat's usually only between very very\nclose friends, spouses, things like that.\n\n158\n00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.106\nOnly about 30 % of people reach\neven the active listening level.\n\n159\n00:08:03.106 --> 00:08:07.720\nSo one of the biggest problems\nin almost all organizations is\n\n160\n00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.670\npoor communications and one of the number\none limiting factors in people's careers\n\n161\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.370\nis not being able to communicate\nefficiently and listen intensely.\n\n162\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.980\n&gt;&gt; John I think on that one I was the\nthird one I was listening to the answer\n\n163\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.640\nbecause I was kind of getting ready for\nmy next questions here.\n\n164\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.840\nBut once I learned that was that\nwas maybe not the best way to go I\n\n165\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.320\ntried to focus up a little bit.\n\n166\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.140\nBut you mentioned some things\nlike repeating the answer back,\n\n167\n00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.590\nare there any other tips to\nhelp us be better listeners?\n\n168\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the things that I use,\n\n169\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.590\ngreat question,\nis what I call calming the monkey mind.\n\n170\n00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.580\nAnd the monkey mind is that voice that's\nrunning in your head the whole time.\n\n171\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.890\nSometimes thinking of\nwhat you're gonna answer.\n\n172\n00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.402\nBut it's going on and on and on,\nand it sounds just like this.\n\n173\n00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:55.236\nOkay right now you're going,\nwhy isn't John talking, what's he doing,\n\n174\n00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:56.690\ndid my video freeze?\n\n175\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.840\nThat's the mind that runs in your head,\nand one of the ways to be an exceptional\n\n176\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.000\nlistener is to get rid of the monkey\nmind by replacing it with repeating what\n\n177\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.630\nthe other person is saying, over and over\nagain in your head as they're talking, so\n\n178\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.060\nagain I'll use my, okay they're talking\nabout a, talking about a and b.\n\n179\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.210\nA, and b, and c.\n\n180\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.650\nC is most important, a is second\nimportant, b is third important.\n\n181\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.740\nA,b,c and then when they stop you guys,\nlisten to you very carefully, and\n\n182\n00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.720\nyou talked about three things, a,b and\nc, c is the most important to you.\n\n183\n00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.780\nA is the second most important and\nc is the most important.\n\n184\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.760\nAnd what's neat about that is that they\nmight say it once You've heard it 10,\n\n185\n00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.370\n15, 20 times in your mind by repeating it,\nand it gives you a great memory for\n\n186\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.830\nwhat you actually discussed.\n\n187\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.130\n&gt;&gt; That's great John, so it sounds like\nit's not only important how you listen,\n\n188\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.980\nbut kind of how your body's\nreacting as well, and\n\n189\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.470\nwhat you're doing while you're listening.\n\n190\n00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nactually they say that about 73% or more,\n\n191\n00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.320\ncould be all the way up to 93%\nof communications is non verbal.\n\n192\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.680\nYour body language,\neye contact, how open you are,\n\n193\n00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.130\nyour vocal inflection, your tone,\nall of that adds to the message.\n\n194\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.940\nAnd sometimes, if done poorly,\nit can outdo the message,\n\n195\n00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.840\nyou can't actually hear it.\n\n196\n00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.470\nSo, when you look at it,\nyou wanna do things like this,\n\n197\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.990\nand I'll look to you to be\nable to do this together.\n\n198\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:19.170\nYou wanna open up and\nhave a good stance, you wanna be able to\n\n199\n00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.400\nlook the person in the eye, but not\nstaring down, just sort of make points.\n\n200\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.510\nI think taking notes is critical if\nyou're gonna ask important questions,\n\n201\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.840\nyou wanna take good notes, so it's\nan open stance, leaning in, taking notes,\n\n202\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.180\nusing nod heads,\nkeeping square to the person.\n\n203\n00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.460\nAlso using nonverbal, or verbal cues for\n\n204\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.080\nshowing them that you're listening\nby going, mm-hm, yeah, I got that.\n\n205\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.170\nI heard that, yeah, I'm listening.\n\n206\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.970\nNot I agree, because if they say\nsomething you don't agree with\n\n207\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.010\nI've caught people that go,\nyes, I agree, I agree, I agree.\n\n208\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.395\nThen you say something you know they\ndon't agree with and they go, I agree.\n\n209\n00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:51.100\nYou're not listening to me.\n\n210\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.950\nSo you've gotta match your body language,\nshowing intently that you're listening.\n\n211\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.090\nIt's important I'm not\nlooking at anything.\n\n212\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.400\nI'm not distracted.\n\n213\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.260\nI'm taking notes.\n\n214\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.230\nI'm smiling.\n\n215\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.590\nI've got everything going,\nwhile I'm paraphrasing, summarizing, and\n\n216\n00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.160\nasking superb questions.\n\n217\n00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.410\nIf you can put that package together,\n\n218\n00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.080\nthat will really allow you to be\na much more effective communicator.\n\n219\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and John, I think it's, really,\nespecially important to be taking notes\n\n220\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.770\nwhen we're talking about more technical\ntopics like you might be in IT.\n\n221\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.230\nOtherwise it maybe looks like you're\nreally not paying that much attention, or\n\n222\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.750\nit could be worrisome to the person\npresenting that you're not\n\n223\n00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.520\npaying attention it makes me\nthink about in restaurants when\n\n224\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.210\nthe waiter is taking your order and\nnot writing down what you're saying, and\n\n225\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.240\nI just know it's not gonna work\nout well in that situation.\n\n226\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's one of my pet peeves too.\n\n227\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.750\nI love it when you got ten\npeople at a table, they come up,\n\n228\n00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.070\nthey just stand there,\nyou make your order.\n\n229\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.650\nAnd you know this is not coming out right.\n\n230\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.300\nThere's no way it's gonna happen.\n\n231\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.240\nWell, you make a great point because\nthis is exactly the same thing that\n\n232\n00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.820\nhappens if someone is, if you ask a great\nquestion that's highly focused and\n\n233\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.000\nsomeone takes the time to give you\nan in depth, robust answer and\n\n234\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.720\nyou don't write anything down,\nyou know what you've just told them?\n\n235\n00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.170\nI wasn't listening.\n\n236\n00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.950\nSo the key idea here is you want to\nuse all that body language I was\n\n237\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.140\ntalking about, leaning in, smiling, head\nnods, and writing really good notes so\n\n238\n00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.690\nthat as you go between them they're\nseeing you take all these notes.\n\n239\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.260\nAnd I use a couple of tricks for this.\n\n240\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.570\nIf I hear them say something important\nI will put a big star next to it.\n\n241\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.250\nAnd that way as they're talking,\nI've got it, and I'm nodding, and\n\n242\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.950\nwe're going along.\n\n243\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.339\nAnd then they say it again,\nI'll put another star and maybe a one.\n\n244\n00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:25.442\nAnd then they'll keep going and\nit'll be another star.\n\n245\n00:12:25.442 --> 00:12:29.789\nAnd what that allows me to do is when\nthey've finally finished talking, I've got\n\n246\n00:12:29.789 --> 00:12:34.010\nthree or four areas that I know their\npriorities, I've got four of five stars,\n\n247\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.042\nI use a pound sign for numbers,\nI got a big clock for time.\n\n248\n00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:39.824\nSo I say here's the numbers you\nshared with me, the amount of time\n\n249\n00:12:39.824 --> 00:12:42.822\nyou think it'll take and\nhere's the three major things you covered.\n\n250\n00:12:42.822 --> 00:12:45.902\nAnd that's a really clear\nindication that I'd been listening,\n\n251\n00:12:45.902 --> 00:12:48.982\nthe information they're giving\nme is extremely important, and\n\n252\n00:12:48.982 --> 00:12:52.290\nI've written it all down,\nwhich means I will remember it.\n\n253\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.080\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI would've written down more here, John,\n\n254\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.990\nbut you've got some great\nnotes that you gave me.\n\n255\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.690\nBut I think, looking at the clock now,\nwe're about out of time for this episode.\n\n256\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:04.910\nAre there any other key takeaways, looking\nback at the things we've discussed,\n\n257\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.820\nin terms of questions and\nlistening and body language?\n\n258\n00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the most important\nthing to remember about this,\n\n259\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.610\nthis is a learned skill.\n\n260\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.470\nThis isn't something you\njust practice once or\n\n261\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.220\ntry that it takes years of practice.\n\n262\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.530\nI mean I've been teaching this for\n20 years and I still struggle with it.\n\n263\n00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.500\nSo asking great questions,\nbeing very curious,\n\n264\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.570\nan intense listener, taking fantastic\nnotes and having wonderful body language.\n\n265\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.670\nThe more you practice it,\nthe better you'll get.\n\n266\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.770\nAnd you can look up in a year or two and\n\n267\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.390\nyou will have completely changed the way\nyou communicate with other people,\n\n268\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.390\nwhich will be a huge positive\nboost in your career.\n\n269\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.000\n&gt;&gt; Well thanks John,\n\n270\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.720\nI think that's a great look at some of\nthe advanced communication skills and\n\n271\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.920\ncertainly it gonna help us in\nour professional development.\n\n272\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.560\nAnd I know we have a lot more\nof professional development\n\n273\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.080\nskills to talk about coming up in future\nepisodes but that's gonna do it for\n\n274\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.340\nus, on this episode.\n\n275\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.730\nSo, going ahead and\nsigning off for BizProTV.\n\n276\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.440\nI've been your host Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n277\n00:13:57.440 -->

Well, let me sort of frame this up.\n\n13\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.130\nAfter 23 years I've worked with\ncompanies all over the world.\n\n14\n00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.873\nThis is now the single biggest issue\nthat most organizations are faced\n\n15\n00:00:42.873 --> 00:00:46.003\nwith is lack of accountability and\ndisciplined execution.\n\n16\n00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.620\nIf you'd asked me about ten years ago,\n\n17\n00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.076\nit was lack of a well communicated\nvision and strategy for growth.\n\n18\n00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:55.396\nAnd by the way a lot of people say but,\nI'm not the CEO,\n\n19\n00:00:55.396 --> 00:00:56.522\nthe president or the owner.\n\n20\n00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.600\nIt's not my job to set the vision.\n\n21\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.800\nThe truth of the matter is,\n\n22\n00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.410\nis if you lead one person, they look to\nyou to set the vision for the two of you.\n\n23\n00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.500\nSo the big problem I saw then\nwas lack of a well-communicated,\n\n24\n00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.270\ncompelling vision and strategy for growth.\n\n25\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.160\nAnd no matter where you are in\nthe organization, you have to have that.\n\n26\n00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.350\nIf you had fast-forwarded a couple\nmore years, the biggest issue I saw\n\n27\n00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.060\nwas lack of courageous communication,\npoor communication skills, and\n\n28\n00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.200\nespecially unwilling to talk about\ndifficult, uncomfortable, awkward things.\n\n29\n00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.570\nThey knew the economy was tough.\n\n30\n00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.100\nThey knew they might\nhave to do some layoffs.\n\n31\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.290\nThey knew there was gonna be\nproblems in their organization.\n\n32\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.530\nThey just didn't want to talk about it.\n\n33\n00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.560\nThey hoped it went away,\nand hope is not a strategy.\n\n34\n00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.920\nBut you fast forward to today, single\nbiggest problem, disciplined execution,\n\n35\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.550\nlack of accountability.\n\n36\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.060\nSo those are the things that when\nI look at this, are the issues.\n\n37\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.180\nAnd in accountability,\n\n38\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.830\nthere's five things it takes to\ncreate a culture of accountability.\n\n39\n00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.500\nSo let's go through those right now.\n\n40\n00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.980\nNumber one Is 100% clarity plus\nappropriate authority and resources.\n\n41\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.010\nIn other words, if you're gonna hold\nsomeone accountable for something,\n\n42\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.730\nespecially something mission critical\nthat's gotta get done right,\n\n43\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.110\nyou need to sit down with that person and\n\n44\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.400\ntake the time to very clearly\noutline your expectations.\n\n45\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.500\nWhat is success looks like, how is success\nmeasured, what's the timeline, what am\n\n46\n00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.020\nI expecting to have happened at the end of\nit, who is the user, what is the budget,\n\n47\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.640\nhow much resources you have available,\nwhat level of authority do you have?\n\n48\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.110\n&gt;&gt; So John, is that a one sided\nconversation where if I'm your boss\n\n49\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.790\nI'm telling you here is what I expect of\nyou or is this kind of a two way street?\n\n50\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.510\n&gt;&gt; Well at first it's one way.\n\n51\n00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.790\nAs the leader the manager lays this out.\n\n52\n00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.070\nNow comes step two after\nyou've gotten 100% clarity\n\n53\n00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.280\nplus appropriate authority and\nresources, next step is 100% agreement.\n\n54\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.790\nAnd Peter this is where there\nis a discussion about it.\n\n55\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.820\nAnd what you want to have\nhappen is you want that person\n\n56\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.620\nyou're holding accountable to\nsit down in front of you and\n\n57\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.330\nsay I understand exactly\nwhat success looks like.\n\n58\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.640\nI understand the metrics, the timeline,\nwho the user is, what the budget is.\n\n59\n00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.790\nI believe, and here's where it is,\nI believe this is a reasonable goal and\n\n60\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.250\nI accept 100% accountability.\n\n61\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.400\nUntil you get those two things\nyou don't have accountability so\n\n62\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.750\nthis is the part where it is a discussion.\n\n63\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.190\nAt some level it's a negotiation.\n\n64\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.690\nThe boss, the manager might say this\nis non negotiable, this part, but\n\n65\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.550\nthey talk until, and this is critical, the\nperson says I understand this completely\n\n66\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.460\nand I accept 100% accountability.\n\n67\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.720\n&gt;&gt; And you mentioned the key point there\nthat in order to have success with this,\n\n68\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.910\nyou've gotta be able to track it.\n\n69\n00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.250\nSo you've gotta come up with,\nat that meeting, what are those metrics.\n\n70\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.560\nAnd so for example in IT,\nit might be up time,\n\n71\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.050\nit might be response time to support\ntickets and things like that.\n\n72\n00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.010\nBut what are the ways to kind of\n\n73\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.980\nmake sure that you're on the same\npage in terms of the accountability?\n\n74\n00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.310\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly right, and\nthat's actually step three.\n\n75\n00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.850\nAnd there's a couple things about\nthe metrics in accountability.\n\n76\n00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.800\nFirst one is the metrics and\n\n77\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.780\nthe measurements must be binary,\nin a term you all know very well.\n\n78\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.550\nIt's zero or one, yes or no, no guessing.\n\n79\n00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.200\nOne of my favorite phrases is and\n\n80\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.840\nthis goes perfectly in the IT world is,\nambiguity breeds mediocrity.\n\n81\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.600\nSo step three then you've got 100%\nclarity plus appropriate authority and\n\n82\n00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.950\nresources 100% agreements,\nthat step three then is track and post.\n\n83\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.590\nAnd there is two key ideas\naround track and post.\n\n84\n00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.832\nThe first one is you gotta make\nit really easy to understand.\n\n85\n00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:33.940\nThose metrics are binary, there's no\nguessing, there's no ambiguity and\n\n86\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.930\nthe way I think about it is they've\ngotta be able to look at the goals,\n\n87\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.620\ntheir major goals, and within three\nseconds see how they're doing.\n\n88\n00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.220\nSo the one I normally use is it's green,\nyellow, red.\n\n89\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.670\nYou're either doing great,\nyou're on track,\n\n90\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.520\nyou're on time, you're doing fantastic.\n\n91\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.980\nYellow you're in a cautionary,\nwe're worried, we're concerned.\n\n92\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.730\nOr red you're falling behind.\n\n93\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.020\nAnd you are about to get in trouble.\n\n94\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.180\nSo step one then in the track a post\nis make it super easy to understand.\n\n95\n00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.860\nStep two then is highly visible.\n\n96\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.420\nIt's everywhere, it's posted everywhere\nfor everyone to see, from the highest\n\n97\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.520\nperson in the organization or\nthe team, to the lowest person.\n\n98\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.030\nEverybody's major goals are posted\neverywhere, and it's exceedingly\n\n99\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.890\nclear to see when you look at it exactly\nwhere everyone stands against those goals.\n\n100\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.420\n&gt;&gt; And I think it's important what you\nsaid about kind of the red, yellow,\n\n101\n00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.230\ngreen to get an idea as you're going\nbecause if you give me this goal and\n\n102\n00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.080\nthis new task,\nI might not be an expert at it by day one.\n\n103\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.730\nBut to kind of see where those\nareas that I need to improve.\n\n104\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.690\nSo is there a kind of time frame that\nyou recommend for these types of goals?\n\n105\n00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.763\nIs this something that,\nthis is your weekly goal or\n\n106\n00:05:36.763 --> 00:05:39.350\nthis is your quarterly goal,\nor your yearly goal?\n\n107\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.150\n&gt;&gt; Well what you want to look at is\nthe major goals, the stuff that's gonna\n\n108\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.600\nmove the organization,\nthe team, the business forward.\n\n109\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.300\nWe don't want to track every goal\nWe want to track the make or\n\n110\n00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.970\nbreak stuff that's gonna\nhave the biggest impact.\n\n111\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.760\nMy idea there to would be is to\ntrack it as often as possible.\n\n112\n00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.060\nMaybe not daily but definitely weekly and\na bid minimum of monthly.\n\n113\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.090\nNow, here's what happen to most of the\norganizations when you tell people let's\n\n114\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.720\nuse weekly.\n\n115\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.460\nEvery single week we're gonna take\nyour goals, put them on a big thing so\n\n116\n00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.360\neverybody can see it and its gonna be\nreally easy to tell if you're green,\n\n117\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.430\nyellow, or red.\n\n118\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.020\nAnd they go!\n\n119\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.420\nEveryone's gonna see my goals and\nhow I'm doing.\n\n120\n00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.880\nMost people get scared, or\nactually, here's what happens.\n\n121\n00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.810\nAbout 10% of the people in\nthe organization love it,\n\n122\n00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.400\nbecause they're the superstars.\n\n123\n00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.600\nThey're the ones that are always\ngonna be green, green, green, green.\n\n124\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.247\nThey get to stand next to it and\ngo look, I'm Mr. Green.\n\n125\n00:06:26.247 --> 00:06:29.138\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Then you're gonna have a whole\n\n126\n00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:31.270\nbunch of people in\nthe middle organization,\n\n127\n00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.010\n70 to 80% that freak out,\nthey look like a deer in headlights!\n\n128\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.678\nAnd then you've got about\n10% at the bottom that fall\n\n129\n00:06:37.678 --> 00:06:41.594\non the ground like a two-year-old with a\nwet diaper [SOUND] and that's the ones you\n\n130\n00:06:41.594 --> 00:06:45.534\ngo it's been a pleasure working with you\nand you make them available to industry.\n\n131\n00:06:45.534 --> 00:06:49.560\nBecause what they've just told you is I'm\nmediocre and now everyone's going to see.\n\n132\n00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.270\nI'm gonna be yellow, red, yellow, red,\nyellow, red So that's the next step,\n\n133\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.440\nstep three is track and post.\n\n134\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.410\nAnd now we're gonna go to step four,\nwhich is when people freak out like that,\n\n135\n00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.250\ninstead of saying, hey you slipped from\ngreen to yellow, you're in trouble.\n\n136\n00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.820\nOr you're slipping into yellow and\nwe're gonna come and yell at you.\n\n137\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.240\nStep number fours is coach,\nmentor, train, support.\n\n138\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.810\nIn other words slipping from green to\nyellow, doesn't get you into trouble,\n\n139\n00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.040\nit gets you help.\n\n140\n00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.580\nThat people come rushing into support you,\nto assist you, you get a coach,\n\n141\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.190\nyou get a mentor, you get to watch\nsome more programs on ITProTV.\n\n142\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.650\nWe do everything we can to\nget you back up into green.\n\n143\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.370\nAnd what eventually happens is, and\nit takes a while people realizing\n\n144\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.620\nthat the tracking isn't for punishment,\nthe tracking is for help and support, and\n\n145\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.010\nPeter, as soon as they got to that level,\nyou know what they want?\n\n146\n00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.640\nMore tracking.\n\n147\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.100\n&gt;&gt; More tracking, exactly.\n\n148\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.930\nWell, and so what happens then, at the end\nof this period when obviously, like you\n\n149\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.700\nsaid, if things are yellow or red,\nyou've got some things to take care of,\n\n150\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.990\nbut If it's green, there's also\nsome steps you can take as well.\n\n151\n00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the key idea here\nis you wanna do two things.\n\n152\n00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.560\nWith green,\nis you wanna celebrate success lavishly.\n\n153\n00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.390\nWhen I say lavishly,\nI don't mean throwing around $100 bills or\n\n154\n00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.840\ngiving somebody a massive bonus.\n\n155\n00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.130\nAlthough, that's nice.\n\n156\n00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.680\nWhat I'm saying is a handshake,\na pat on the back, a thank you card,\n\n157\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.540\nsome flex time,\ndinner out with their significant other.\n\n158\n00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.190\nSomething to say you made a promise.\n\n159\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.130\nYou kept the promise.\n\n160\n00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.220\nYou delivered on your goals.\n\n161\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.990\nHere is the reward, here is the bonus.\n\n162\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.940\nThank you very much.\n\n163\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.380\nSo you celebrate both big and small wins.\n\n164\n00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.120\nThe other side of that is,\nyou must deal decisively with mediocrity.\n\n165\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.250\nThat if someone is consistently\nyellow red, yellow red.\n\n166\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.900\nYou're coaching, you're mentoring,\nyou're training, you're supporting.\n\n167\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.130\nEveryone on the team is helping.\n\n168\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.100\nThey're doing everything they can\nto get them back up in the green.\n\n169\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.540\nAnd I can't get them back up into green\n\n170\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.510\nthen when you do either turn them on\na performance plan or terminate them,\n\n171\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.970\nremove them from the organization,\nnobody feels bad about it.\n\n172\n00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.020\nBecause it's obvious you've been spending\nweeks or months supporting them,\n\n173\n00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.810\nhelping them, trying to get them better so\nit doesn't come as a shock.\n\n174\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.700\nI don't quote a lot of CEOs, but I do have\n\n175\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.680\none favorite Jack Welch quote from GE I\nnever fired anybody who was surprised.\n\n176\n00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.760\nAnd this tracking and posting makes it\nsimple to everyone in the organization,\n\n177\n00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.020\nto see who's doing well, why they get a\npromotion, why they might get more money,\n\n178\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.010\nand to see who's struggling and\n\n179\n00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.770\nto clearly see that everybody tried to\nhelp the person that was struggling and\n\n180\n00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.160\nthey didn't make it,\nwhich is why they're not here anymore.\n\n181\n00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.920\n&gt;&gt; It makes a lot of sense.\n\n182\n00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.920\nSo, this sounds like it's not just a\nchange in some procedural things that you\n\n183\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.470\ndo to your company but\nit's a shift in the culture.\n\n184\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is all around creating\na culture of accountability which is if\n\n185\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.930\nwe go to most business leaders today and I\nasked them what they look for an employee,\n\n186\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.430\nof course they want competence, they want\nsomeone who's proactive in all things but\n\n187\n00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.290\nI can boil it all down to two words\n&gt;&gt; I want people with\n\n188\n00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.490\nan ownership mentality.\n\n189\n00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.880\nAnd what we're trying to create here\nis a culture of extreme customer focus,\n\n190\n00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.890\nwhere people are highly talented and\ncompetent, getting better every day,\n\n191\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.220\nthey understand their clear goals, and\nthen they're very disciplined about\n\n192\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.590\nexecuting on those goals and taking\nhigh levels of personal accountability.\n\n193\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.270\n&gt;&gt; Great John, I appreciate that and\n\n194\n00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.480\nit looks like we're getting close to\nrunning out of time for this episode,\n\n195\n00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.730\nso any last key take aways on\nthe essentials of accountability here?\n\n196\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the thing that a lot of people\nstruggle with is they think holding other\n\n197\n00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.920\npeople accountable makes them mean or\ntough or someone to be feared.\n\n198\n00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.226\nAnd the truth of the matter is when\nyou use the process I just laid out,\n\n199\n00:10:19.226 --> 00:10:23.045\nIt's very fair, it's very reasonable,\nthere's no emotion involved in it,\n\n200\n00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:26.066\nthere's no politics, and\nall you're doing is holding people\n\n201\n00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:29.920\naccountable to the promises they made\nto help the business be successful.\n\n202\n00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's one\nof the key points there.\n\n203\n00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.310\nThere's gonna be that finger pointing\nbecause at the end of the day,\n\n204\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.190\nthis is what they agreed to, so\nthey're only being accountable for\n\n205\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.870\nthe things that they said\nthey'll be accountable for.\n\n206\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.480\nSo I think that's a great place\nto go ahead and leave off for\n\n207\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.010\nthis episode though, for\nthe essentials of accountability.\n\n208\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.880\nWe've got a lot more professional\ndevelopment skills coming your way with\n\n209\n00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.520\nJohn, so go ahead and\nstay tuned to BizProTV.\n\n210\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.470\nBut I'm signing off now.\n\n211\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.100\nI've been Peter VanRysdam.\n\n212\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n213\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.817\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n214\n00:10:56.231 --> 00:11:05.411\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n4\n00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.610\nAnd today we're continuing our\nseries on professional development.\n\n5\n00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.282\nAnd specifically today, we're gonna talk\nabout achieving business excellence.\n\n6\n00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.930\nAnd here to help us do that is someone\nwho, I think has done that for himself,\n\n7\n00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.860\nMr. John Spence.\n\n8\n00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.690\nJohn, how you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.520\n&gt;&gt; Great, Peter, how are you?\n\n10\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.620\n&gt;&gt; Good, great, thanks.\n\n11\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.770\nNow, achieving business excellence,\nthat's easy,\n\n12\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.815\nwe should be able to knock\nthat out here in 20 minutes.\n\n13\n00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:29.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where do we start?\n\n14\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nas we've talked about this before,\n\n15\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.440\nI've built my entire career on\nmaking complex things simple.\n\n16\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.570\nAnd all of this started\nafter I wrote my first book.\n\n17\n00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.560\nAnd that book was 53,518 words long.\n\n18\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.290\nI didn't actually type it.\n\n19\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.030\nI spoke it using a dictation software.\n\n20\n00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.590\nAnd when I finished that book, I loaded it\ninto this software program called Wordle.\n\n21\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.750\nAnd what what Wordle does, it allows you\nto put the text of a document in and\n\n22\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.040\nit scans it, takes out the uhs and\nthe thes and all that stuff, and\n\n23\n00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.360\nit creates a pattern of the ideas and\ntheir picture of it, a word cloud.\n\n24\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.790\nAnd the bigger the word is in the word\ncloud the more times it was in the text.\n\n25\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.390\nSo I loaded my 53,518 words in there.\n\n26\n00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.470\nAnd it gave me this really cool picture\nof my entire book, all the main ideas.\n\n27\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.160\nAnd I'm a visual learner,\nso that was really cool.\n\n28\n00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.885\nBut then I realized I'm not that smart.\n\n29\n00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:22.880\n[LAUGH] So I went to a couple of my\nfriends, some of the top authors, CEOs,\n\n30\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.760\nand I asked them for their copies\nof their books, or memos, or ideas.\n\n31\n00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.560\nI won't drag you through the whole thing,\nbut instead of 53,000 words\n\n32\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.140\nI loaded about 240,000 pages into Wordle,\nfrom all the top business thinkers,\n\n33\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.240\nall the top business books in the world,\nand it gave me a word cloud.\n\n34\n00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.270\nAnd I looked at that word cloud and\nit was still too complex.\n\n35\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.870\nSo I worked on it, worked on it, and I\ngot it down to what I call my formula for\n\n36\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.230\nbusiness excellence.\n\n37\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.920\nAnd this are four things that I believe\nare fundamental to building a successful\n\n38\n00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.330\norganization, whether it's a few people,\na few hundred or a hundred thousand.\n\n39\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.690\nSo, here's the equation and\nthen I'll explain it quickly.\n\n40\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.600\nIt's in parenthesis for those of you that\nare highly analytical to know about math,\n\n41\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.200\nwhich I don't.\n\n42\n00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.130\nIt's T Plus C plus ECF multiplied by DE.\n\n43\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.610\nSo let's go through that.\n\n44\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.100\nFirst one is tower.\n\n45\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.790\nAnd for most organizations and\nespecially the ones you all work for\n\n46\n00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.510\nin the IT division,\nthe success of the business is directly\n\n47\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.270\ntied to the quality of people that you\ncan get, grow and keep on your team.\n\n48\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.890\nOther people can buy the same hardware,\nthey can buy the same software, but\n\n49\n00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.420\nwhat they can't buy is super-talented\npeople and growing them.\n\n50\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.190\nThat's one of the only sustainable\ncompetitive advantages\n\n51\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.130\nleft to most businesses,\nreally good talented people.\n\n52\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.480\nSo step one is, and again even if\nyou don't run the organization,\n\n53\n00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.602\njust talking about your team or two or\nthree people working on a project.\n\n54\n00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:53.350\nYou wanna get the best\npeople you can possibly get.\n\n55\n00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.580\nThe top talent and\n\n56\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.410\nthen the big caveat to this,\nmore important is you need to be talent.\n\n57\n00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.810\nYou've got to constantly be reading,\nstudying, upgrading your skills,\n\n58\n00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.790\nupgrading your communication skills,\nyour professional skills, your IT skills.\n\n59\n00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.840\nConstantly learning and\ngrowing and improving, so\n\n60\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.050\nthat you're recognized as\ntalent in the organization.\n\n61\n00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.940\nThe next letter is C, and\nwhat C stands for is culture.\n\n62\n00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.238\nAnd there's two sides to the culture coin.\n\n63\n00:03:20.238 --> 00:03:25.017\nSide one is the culture that employees\nwant and there's been a ton of studies and\n\n64\n00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:26.500\nresearch on this.\n\n65\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.650\nAnd I'll break it down here to seven or\neight key ideas\n\n66\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.310\nof what most employees look for in\na business that they want to work in and\n\n67\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.530\nhas what they we consider\na great place to work.\n\n68\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.280\nFirst of all, it's a fun place to work and\nthat doesn't mean we got\n\n69\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.650\nrock climbing walls and sushi bars and\neverything else, so that's nice.\n\n70\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.210\nBut what it really means,\nin the way I can phrase this is,\n\n71\n00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.490\npeople smile just as much when they\ncome to work as when they leave.\n\n72\n00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.410\nThey look forward to getting there in the\nmorning, they're excited about their job,\n\n73\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.840\nthe work they're doing,\nwho they work with,\n\n74\n00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.340\nwhich means also that they work with a lot\nof people they consider their friends,\n\n75\n00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.300\nsome of them even their best friend.\n\n76\n00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.030\nThey take pride in the organization,\nthey're proud of the work they do, they\n\n77\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.690\nget a lot of praise for great work, and\nthey feel like their work is meaningful.\n\n78\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.950\nAnd I can bring you a couple more but\n\n79\n00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.470\nit gives you an idea of\nwhat do employees look for?\n\n80\n00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.330\nNow the other side of that coin is what do\nemployers look for, bosses and managers?\n\n81\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.660\nAnd it's pretty simple.\n\n82\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.570\nThey want top talent with\nan ownership mentality.\n\n83\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.500\nPeople that are pro active,\ninnovative, creative,\n\n84\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.110\ndon't wait to be told what to do,\ngo out and do it.\n\n85\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.410\nAnd look at the business\nas if it were their own.\n\n86\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.780\nEvery dollar that comes in, every bit\nof their budget they wanna maximize\n\n87\n00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.760\nefficiency and effectiveness,\nminimize waste.\n\n88\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.510\nSo when you look at creating a great\nculture, it's not only a great culture for\n\n89\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.550\nthe employees where they love to\ncome to work and do great work.\n\n90\n00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.220\nBut it's also a culture that\nhas disciplined execution and\n\n91\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.010\ndelivers the results and\nhas accountability.\n\n92\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.070\nAnd makes sure that\nthe business is going forward.\n\n93\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.350\n&gt;&gt; But\nI think at the end of the day, John,\n\n94\n00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.966\nwe can all agree that a foosball table-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n95\n00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:56.537\n&gt;&gt; - is a great part of any company\n\n96\n00:04:56.537 --> 00:04:57.136\nculture.\n\n97\n00:04:57.136 --> 00:05:02.165\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I might say can-\n&gt;&gt; But moving forward,\n\n98\n00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:06.450\nI'm looking at ECF and I'm trying to\nguess what that is and I have no idea.\n\n99\n00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.979\nSo help me out.\n\n100\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.080\n&gt;&gt; ECF stands for\nExtreme Customer Focus or\n\n101\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.700\nyou could call it in your\nworld extreme client focus.\n\n102\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.860\nHere is what I always is whoever\nunderstands their customers,\n\n103\n00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.130\nthe people they serve the best\nhas a huge advantage.\n\n104\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.800\nSo the idea here is you\nwanna service mindset,\n\n105\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.600\nyou wanna deeply understand the people\nthat you deliver you work for,\n\n106\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.580\nunderstand their needs, their wants,\ntheir fears, their wishes, their desires.\n\n107\n00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.160\nThe more focused you are on your client,\nyour customer.\n\n108\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.900\nThe better job you can be in\ndelivering exactly what they need.\n\n109\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.700\nAnd this is an extremely\nimportant part of a culture.\n\n110\n00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.230\nBecause at the end of the day,\nit's the people that you serve\n\n111\n00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.200\nthat pay all the bills, or\nallow you to keep your job.\n\n112\n00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.660\nSo we take those three things.\n\n113\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.320\nWe've got top talent with\na winning culture, both for\n\n114\n00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.870\nemployees, and for the business,\nthat is extremely customer client focused.\n\n115\n00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.800\nAnd then you multiply it\nby disciplined execution.\n\n116\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.315\nBy having a team that has both\npersonal accountability, plus mutual\n\n117\n00:06:04.315 --> 00:06:07.595\naccountability, where everybody knows\nwhat they're trying to achieve.\n\n118\n00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:09.165\nAnd they come in everyday with, and\n\n119\n00:06:09.165 --> 00:06:13.755\nthey're focused on it, they build it into\nthe DNA of the organization, it's on\n\n120\n00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:18.760\nall of the meeting agendas and notes that\neverything is around not just talking, but\n\n121\n00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.210\nactually delivering what\nthey promise to deliver.\n\n122\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.800\n&gt;&gt; Well you said at the beginning,\n\n123\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.030\nwell I joked that we can't do business\nexcellence in 20 minutes here.\n\n124\n00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.853\nBut I think like I said\nyou simplified it and\n\n125\n00:06:29.853 --> 00:06:33.938\nput in a little container here\nwhere we kind of understand it.\n\n126\n00:06:33.938 --> 00:06:38.317\nAnd I think the difficult part now is\nfiguring out how to find the great talent\n\n127\n00:06:38.317 --> 00:06:42.080\nand how to build that company culture and\nkind of get that focus and\n\n128\n00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.870\nthat binding from the team but any other\ntips here for building those things.\n\n129\n00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, the idea here is,\nthese aren't the only four things.\n\n130\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.680\nYou've still gotta have good financial\nmanagement, quality products and\n\n131\n00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.450\nservices, all those sort of things.\n\n132\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.040\nBut I believe that if you look at this\nequation, and on a scale of one to ten,\n\n133\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.980\nwith ten being world class.\n\n134\n00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.900\nYou've gotta be a solid eight, nine, or\n\n135\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.832\na ten ifs you wanted to grow a succesfull\nbusiness and sustain that success.\n\n136\n00:07:08.832 --> 00:07:11.840\n&gt;&gt; All right John that's really helpful\nand I think I understand the culture and\n\n137\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.900\nI understand getting good talent.\n\n138\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.874\nBut the extreme customer focus,\nthat's a little more nebulous for me,\n\n139\n00:07:17.874 --> 00:07:20.558\ncan you help me honing on\nby what you mean by that?\n\n140\n00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:23.253\n&gt;&gt; Peter, when you look at extreme\ncustomer focus we're gonna take it down\n\n141\n00:07:23.253 --> 00:07:25.170\nanother level and go a little bit deeper.\n\n142\n00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.950\nThere's three elements underneath\nthat that I call the web of value.\n\n143\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.620\nThe first one is very much like\nwhat I was talking about before.\n\n144\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.710\nIt's called VOC and that stands for\nthe Voice of the Customer.\n\n145\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.120\nThat means that if you really wanna deeply\nunderstand the needs of your customer,\n\n146\n00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.810\nyou've gotta capture their\nvoice in lots and lots of ways.\n\n147\n00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.552\nThrough one on ones, surveys,\n\n148\n00:07:44.552 --> 00:07:48.683\nnet promoter scores VIP meeting's\ntaking folks to lunch, whatever it is,\n\n149\n00:07:48.683 --> 00:07:53.138\nevery method could possibly use to deeply\nunderstand there needs, there wants,\n\n150\n00:07:53.138 --> 00:07:57.656\ntheir wishes, their fears, their desires\nbecause the more you understand that,\n\n151\n00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:00.522\nas I said,\nthe better job you can do in serving them.\n\n152\n00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:03.779\nSo that's VOC,\nown the Voice of the Customer.\n\n153\n00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:07.920\nThe next one is MOT which stands for\nMoments of Truth.\n\n154\n00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.370\nAnd many people tell me this is one\nof the most powerful ideas I teach.\n\n155\n00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.330\nThis came from a gentleman\nnamed Jan Carlzon, years and\n\n156\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.140\nyears ago, he was named the CEO\nof Scandinavian Airway.\n\n157\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.190\nAnd at the time, Scandinavian Airway\nwas in serious financial trouble And\n\n158\n00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.410\nhe looked at it and said, if we're\ngoing to have to rebuild this company,\n\n159\n00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.370\nwhy don't we rebuild it on the shoulders\nof the very best customers,\n\n160\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.770\nwhich is someone like me who travels\n200 days a year, the business traveler.\n\n161\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.717\nAnd he said, let's look at it and\nwe'll look at all of the touch points,\n\n162\n00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:41.989\nall of the places we interact with that\ncustomer and out of that we'll identify\n\n163\n00:08:41.989 --> 00:08:46.860\nthe three, four, five moments of truth\nthat make or break the relationship.\n\n164\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.600\nSo I like to use the example of\ngoing to a restaurant for this.\n\n165\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.620\nAnd I did the research if you\nwould take your family or\n\n166\n00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.990\nfriends out to a restaurant for dinner.\n\n167\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.620\nThere's about 170 touch points.\n\n168\n00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.650\nFrom is it easy to find the place?\n\n169\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.820\nIs the signage bright?\n\n170\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.580\nIs it easy to drive in and out?\n\n171\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.100\nIs the parking lot clean?\n\n172\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.990\nIs the shrubbery attractive?\n\n173\n00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.230\nDo they greet you at the door?\n\n174\n00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.360\nAll of those are touch points but\nin pretty much\n\n175\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.420\nevery restaurant on the face of the earth\nthere's only four moments of truth.\n\n176\n00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.840\nFour things they must do flawlessly\nif they wanna take someone and\n\n177\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.380\nturn them into a customer evangelists.\n\n178\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.530\nSomeone who loves the restaurant,\nrecommends it to all their friends,\n\n179\n00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.030\ncomes back all the time,\nbecomes a real regular, a patron.\n\n180\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.330\nSo and I've asked thousands of people\nthis and they all pretty much get it,\n\n181\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.460\nand here they are.\n\n182\n00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:40.010\nGood quality food, good service,\nreasonable prices, cleanliness, that's it.\n\n183\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.100\nThose are the four things that most people\nlook for in a restaurant if they're going\n\n184\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.610\nto become a patron and\ncome back over and over again.\n\n185\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.980\nSo if I went to a restaurant and\nlet's say, Peter, I took you, you and\n\n186\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.940\nI went out to dinner.\n\n187\n00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.450\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, be my pleasure.\n\n188\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.210\nWhat do you like?\n\n189\n00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.930\nWhat's your favorite type of food?\n\n190\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.010\n&gt;&gt; Let's go Steakhouse.\n\n191\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.770\nSteakhouse, so we go to the steakhouse\nthey great us at the door it's beautiful\n\n192\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.360\nthey got you know it's a country western\nsteakhouse there are folks out front\n\n193\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.490\nding ding you know playing country music.\n\n194\n00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.570\nThey're all dressed in cowboys hats.\n\n195\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.547\nThe service is amazing they sit us down\nright away, keep the beer ice cold.\n\n196\n00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:17.470\nWe look at the menu the prices\nare really reasonable.\n\n197\n00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.070\nYou order a huge steak, it comes out\nit is the best steak you've ever had.\n\n198\n00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.510\nJuicy, delicious, cooked perfectly.\n\n199\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.640\nThen you get up to use the restroom.\n\n200\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.000\nYou go in there, it looks like\nnobody's cleaned it in five years.\n\n201\n00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.970\nIt's disgusting.\n\n202\n00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.320\nIt's nasty.\n\n203\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.120\nAre you ever going there again?\n\n204\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:31.930\n&gt;&gt; Probably not.\n\n205\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.077\nOr maybe take out.\n\n206\n00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:37.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, you look at it and say,\nif this is what the bathroom looks like,\n\n207\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.430\nI wonder what the kitchen looks like.\n\n208\n00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.810\nAnd for most people that's a no-go.\n\n209\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:42.890\nI'm never going back there again.\n\n210\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.100\nThe food was great, the service is great,\nthe price reasonable, but\n\n211\n00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.450\nthe place is disgustingly dirty,\nit's off my list.\n\n212\n00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.070\nWell, here's the key idea,\nit's the same thing with your customers.\n\n213\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.960\nOut of all the things you do with\nyour clients your customers,\n\n214\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.680\nyou know the hundreds of places you\ntouch them, there's three, four, maybe\n\n215\n00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.150\nfive moments of truth that make or break\nyour relationship with your customer.\n\n216\n00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.430\nYour internal customer or\nexternal customer.\n\n217\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.330\nSo, you've got to understand those deeply.\n\n218\n00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.100\nYou've got to find out what those are and\nthen I'm not a process guy,\n\n219\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.620\nI don't like check list and stuff which\nis weird to say to somebody in IT but\n\n220\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.780\nI understand this, if you want repeatable\nsuccess, you must have process.\n\n221\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.706\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think that would\nbe an interesting exercise,\n\n222\n00:11:24.706 --> 00:11:27.811\nto maybe sit your team down and\ntry to come up with what are these\n\n223\n00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:31.476\ndifferent touch points, the key\nmoments of truth in your own business.\n\n224\n00:11:31.476 --> 00:11:34.581\nHave a great discussion and\nkinda find out what everyone thinks and\n\n225\n00:11:34.581 --> 00:11:38.418\nif you are all on the same page and how to\nmaximize those and make those better than.\n\n226\n00:11:38.418 --> 00:11:40.143\nBut you mentioned one more.\n\n227\n00:11:40.143 --> 00:11:41.291\nYou've got, three pointers?\n\n228\n00:11:41.291 --> 00:11:45.046\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the last one is called WOM,\nwhich is Word of Mouth.\n\n229\n00:11:45.046 --> 00:11:47.684\nAnd what we wanna do is do\nthose first two so well.\n\n230\n00:11:47.684 --> 00:11:51.349\nListen to our customers, understand them,\nunderstanding their needs,\n\n231\n00:11:51.349 --> 00:11:55.186\ndefine the moments of truth and which by\nthe way Peter I think is a great exercise\n\n232\n00:11:55.186 --> 00:11:58.060\nto sit down with your team and\ntalk about this.\n\n233\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.490\nBut at the end of the day the only person\nwho can tell you what the moments of truth\n\n234\n00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.230\nare is your customer.\n\n235\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.730\nSo you gotta go talk to them.\n\n236\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.630\nOnce you do those first two,\nwhat you want to drive is number three,\n\n237\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.270\nwhich is Word of Mouth.\n\n238\n00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.600\nYou want your client/customer to be so\nexcited about the work you've done, they\n\n239\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.890\ntell everyone else in the organization,\nthey tell your boss, your manager.\n\n240\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:24.030\nIf you're going to outside customers, you\nwant them to be incredibly delighted, so\n\n241\n00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.680\nthat they tell everyone they\nshould do business with you.\n\n242\n00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.276\nSo you wanna own the voice of\nthe customer to understand them.\n\n243\n00:12:29.276 --> 00:12:33.858\nOut of all the touch points identify\nthose moments of truth and deliver them\n\n244\n00:12:33.858 --> 00:12:38.366\nflawlessly and if you do those two you\nget out of control happy customers,\n\n245\n00:12:38.366 --> 00:12:42.270\nwho drive lots of word of mouth,\nbusiness or promotions.\n\n246\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.010\n&gt;&gt; John, I think that;s a great\npoint thinking about the example of\n\n247\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:45.630\na restaurant.\n\n248\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.230\nIf you are the manager\nof the restaurant and\n\n249\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.030\nmaybe there is an employee bathroom\nin the back and you have no idea\n\n250\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.090\nthat there's this issue with the customer\nbathroom until someone comes and\n\n251\n00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:57.040\ntells you or you ask your customer which\nis probably a little more important there.\n\n252\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.090\nBut, so I think we've covered\na lot of stuff in this episode.\n\n253\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.818\nWe've got that formula, I didn't\nthink there was going to be math but\n\n254\n00:13:01.818 --> 00:13:04.823\nluckily it wasn't, and we figured out\nyou have to have a foosball table, and\n\n255\n00:13:04.823 --> 00:13:05.856\nsome other things there.\n\n256\n00:13:05.856 --> 00:13:10.080\nBut what are some of the key take\naways from this episode for you?\n\n257\n00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.800\n&gt;&gt; The major things to think about here\nis this is not as complex as you thought.\n\n258\n00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.070\nThere's just a handful of things\nthat if they're done superbly,\n\n259\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.380\nwill absolutely drive\nsuccess in your organization.\n\n260\n00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.520\nThe biggest one is it's all\ndriven by talent, which is you.\n\n261\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.750\n&gt;&gt; Great John, well, I appreciate your\nhelp with this and helping simplify this\n\n262\n00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:35.470\nfor us and show us how clear it can be,\nit's not easy, but its also not confusing.\n\n263\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.660\nSo, its just figuring out that stuff.\n\n264\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.533\nSo, I think that that's a good point for\n\n265\n00:13:39.533 --> 00:13:42.231\nus to go ahead sign off on this\nepisode though, we have a lot\n\n266\n00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:46.440\nmore coming on professional development in\nfuture episodes so stay tuned for those.\n\n267\n00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.010\nBut signing of now for\nBiz Pro TV I'm host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n268\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:50.730\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n269\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.680\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n270\n00:13:54.214 --> 00:14:04.214\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Great, Peter, thank you.\n\n7\n00:00:20.432 --> 00:00:21.397\n&gt;&gt; Great.\nNow, John,\n\n8\n00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:24.330\nwhat exactly are we talking\nabout with leader of the future?\n\n9\n00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.910\nIt sounds like some futuristic\nrobot movie or something?\n\n10\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.900\n&gt;&gt; We could go there.\n\n11\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.850\nThere's a lot of things\nhappening in that area, but\n\n12\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.870\nactually I've been teaching leadership for\nabout 20 years.\n\n13\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.150\nIn the last five or\nsix years it has started to change, and\n\n14\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.990\nthe requirements for\nbeing a successful leader in the future\n\n15\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.740\nare now different than they were 10 or\n15 years ago.\n\n16\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.270\nDid a big research study on this,\nI mean, studying it for years, and\n\n17\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.880\nI boiled down the pattern of what\nI saw around great leadership\n\n18\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.250\nto seven words that begin with C.\n\n19\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.250\nThe first one is character.\n\n20\n00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.590\nTell the truth all the time, period.\n\n21\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.130\nHonesty, Integrity.\n\n22\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.040\nThat's actually based slightly\non another research study\n\n23\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.020\ndone by two of my colleagues,\nKouzes and Posner.\n\n24\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.140\nThey did a 30-year research study on\nfour continents with almost 3 million\n\n25\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.400\nrespondents, and\n\n26\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.720\nthey asked them this question,\nsame question I asked in my survey.\n\n27\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.190\nWhat are the characteristics of\na leader you would willingly follow?\n\n28\n00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.470\nThey came up with six key things.\n\n29\n00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.900\nThe first one was honest.\n\n30\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.140\n89% of the people worldwide,\nthat's 30 years,\n\n31\n00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.190\n3 million people 89 percent had the same\nfirst answer tell me the truth.\n\n32\n00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.100\nThe second thing they have was\nforward looking, in another word for\n\n33\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.142\nthat would be visionary.\n\n34\n00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:35.610\nThat's, again, no matter where\nyou are in your organization,\n\n35\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.290\nif you leave one person, they look to you\nto set the vision for the two of you,\n\n36\n00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.590\nso everyone has to be visionary.\n\n37\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.010\nThe third one was competent.\n\n38\n00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.270\nYou got to be really good at what you do,\n\n39\n00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.620\nyou actually have to\nbe good at Two skills.\n\n40\n00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.960\nYour job skills, whatever those are,\nyour IT skills and your leadership skills.\n\n41\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.580\nSo, you've got to be competent\nin both those areas.\n\n42\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.610\nThe next one was inspiring and\n\n43\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.590\nthat doesn't mean you've got to go ra\nra sis boom ba and be a cheerleader.\n\n44\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.660\nIt can be very humble, quiet, focused.\n\n45\n00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.690\nIt's inspirational passion.\n\n46\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.490\nIf you're not excited about\nwhat you're doing, don't expect\n\n47\n00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.380\nanyone else in the organization\nto be excited about it either.\n\n48\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.600\nThose were the four original.\n\n49\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.230\nHonest, forward looking, competent and\ninspiring and two more added the list.\n\n50\n00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.660\n&gt;&gt; Great.\nI think you made,\n\n51\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.480\nwell you made a lot of good points\nthere but one I wanted to reiterate is\n\n52\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.970\nthat we're not just talking about the CEO\nof a company, we're talking about.\n\n53\n00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.160\nAnyone is a leader.\n\n54\n00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.760\nYou could be down in the mailroom but\nif you lead the mailroom these things\n\n55\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.980\napply to you as well so we're not just\ntalking about the board of directors.\n\n56\n00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah these are for\nleader in any level in the organization.\n\n57\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.960\nAnd frankly the truth of the matter is\neveryone in every organization leads\n\n58\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.510\nin some way.\n\n59\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.340\nAnd I know that sounds cliche but\nit's the truth.\n\n60\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.250\nI've worked in hundreds of companies.\n\n61\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.660\nAnd everybody plays a leadership role.\n\n62\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.060\nSo those first four were honest,\nforward looking, competent, inspiring.\n\n63\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.500\nAnd then in the last five years,\n\n64\n00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.960\nthank you millennials, two more have\njoined the list, fair and supportive.\n\n65\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.500\nSo let me take their entire research\nproject under my first c of character and\n\n66\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.450\nsummarize it.\n\n67\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.270\nHere's basically what\nall of those folks said.\n\n68\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.640\nI want a leader who will tell me the\ntruth, who has a clear idea of where we're\n\n69\n00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.320\ngoing, who has the skills to get us there\nsuccessfully, is excited about going with\n\n70\n00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.910\nme, and will treat me fairly and\nsupport me along the way.\n\n71\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.900\nTo me, all of that falls under\nme first c of character.\n\n72\n00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.450\nThe second c is courage and\nwhat they've got to be courageous enough,\n\n73\n00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.970\ntherefore, is to be vulnerable.\n\n74\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.830\nTo admit, I might be the leader,\nI might lead this team, this group,\n\n75\n00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.160\nthis division, this company, but\nI don't have all the answers.\n\n76\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.500\nI need help.\n\n77\n00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.780\nSo you have to be courageous enough to\nsay, I need some assistance, some help,\n\n78\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.380\nsome support.\n\n79\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.900\nThat's why I put you on my team.\n\n80\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.180\nYou're really good at what you do, and\nI need you to help me, and not try to\n\n81\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.630\npretend like I can handle everything The\nnext Company we talked about a little bit\n\n82\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.460\nbefore but the word I like to use\nhere is Is gonna be exceedingly got\n\n83\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.630\nwhat you do which means committing\nyourself to life long running and\n\n84\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.420\ntoday there was no excuse for\nnot being really got what you do.\n\n85\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.000\nThere is all kind of staff in the internet\nthings like IT pro TV Great books.\n\n86\n00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.020\nLectures you can listen to.\n\n87\n00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.580\nSo, there's no excuse not to be constantly\nlearning, growing and getting better.\n\n88\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.040\nSo, competence is the next one.\n\n89\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.250\nNow we're gonna move to the next\none which is communication.\n\n90\n00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.190\nAnd of course, the folks said I want\na leader who's a great communicator,\n\n91\n00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.300\nwho can stand up and be inspiring and talk\nabout the vision and the direction and\n\n92\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.440\nthe strategy.\n\n93\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.310\nBut what they said was much more\nimportant was getting a leader who\n\n94\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.170\nasked great questions and listens.\n\n95\n00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.260\n&gt;&gt; I think communication is so\n\n96\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.600\nimportant that we actually had an entire\nepisode on it earlier in this series.\n\n97\n00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.550\nSo definitely go back and\nwatch that if you haven't yet.\n\n98\n00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.290\nTo just kind of stressing\nhow important that one is.\n\n99\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.380\nSo what's the next one?\n\n100\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.220\n&gt;&gt; Well the next one is collaboration,\nand here's what, again, and\n\n101\n00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.500\nthe way I came up with this research\nis I interviewed about ten thousand\n\n102\n00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.332\nhigh potential employees at top companies\naround the world, and I asked the same\n\n103\n00:05:08.332 --> 00:05:12.360\nquestion what are the characteristics\nof a leader you would willingly follow.\n\n104\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.430\nSo right now we've got character Courage,\nconfidence, communication, collaboration.\n\n105\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.400\nAnd what this says is I understand\nyou're my boss, my manager.\n\n106\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.090\nYou're the leader, but\nI want you to be a partner, and\n\n107\n00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.690\na peer, and\na team member most of the time.\n\n108\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.670\nI wanna see you roll up your sleeves,\nget in there,\n\n109\n00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.130\nget shoulder to shoulder,\ndo work with us And then if every now and\n\n110\n00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.570\nthen you gotta pull rank and say, do it\nbecause I'm the manager or the leader or\n\n111\n00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.660\nthe owner or whatever it might be,\nI'm fine with that.\n\n112\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.290\nBut if you're constantly telling me that,\n\n113\n00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.980\ngood people will leave\nbecause they have options.\n\n114\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.480\nSo as a collaborator,\nyou wanna be a great team member.\n\n115\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.870\nYou get in there and do work with them.\n\n116\n00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.800\nUnderstand the work they do.\n\n117\n00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.280\nnd if you do that, every now and\nthen you can pull rank.\n\n118\n00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.640\nAnd the next one we're gonna\nlook at is compassion.\n\n119\n00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.150\nAnd this has really changed\na lot too around the millennials\n\n120\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.630\nwho say my job is important but\nit's not my life.\n\n121\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.730\nI'll come, I'll give you the forty, fifty\nhours, whatever I'm getting paid for.\n\n122\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.830\nBut I've got friends,\nI've got hobbies, I've got a faith,\n\n123\n00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.300\nI've got a sport I play,\nI've got a favorite brew pub I go to, and\n\n124\n00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.640\nI'm gonna leave here and\nI'm gonna have a life out of here.\n\n125\n00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.990\nI want some balance.\n\n126\n00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.100\nAs a matter of fact, when we look at the\nyounger generation coming into work today,\n\n127\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.920\nthey've got a few different\ndesires than someone my age, 52.\n\n128\n00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.790\nHas about what they look for\nin a leader in a job.\n\n129\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.730\nWhen I entered the workforce, when my\nboss said, jump, it was, how high sir?\n\n130\n00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.390\nIt was all men.\n\n131\n00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.450\nAnd it was all command and control.\n\n132\n00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.760\nToday, it's exceedingly\nimportant when you lead people,\n\n133\n00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.660\nto lead with empathy, inclusiveness,\nto help them see purpose in their work,\n\n134\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.560\nso that they feel like they're doing\nmeaningful work They wanna work with\n\n135\n00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.390\ncool colleagues, folks that are smart,\nand bright, and talented.\n\n136\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:00.130\nThey wanna have an impact on social issues\nas part of their job, and all of this goes\n\n137\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.130\nto having the compassion to understand\nThat it's not just a job for them.\n\n138\n00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.700\nAnd it's not work life integration or\nwork life balance.\n\n139\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.640\nIt's work life integration, one work\nwhere my job is just part of who I am.\n\n140\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.630\n&gt;&gt; So John, is this why we're calling\nthis leader of the future then?\n\n141\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:20.330\nIs this kind of the change from the skills\nand the qualities of a leader in the past?\n\n142\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you'd looked at, Peter,\n\n143\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.430\nabout ten years ago,\n&gt;&gt; The pendulum was way over as I\n\n144\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.000\nmentioned command and control.\n\n145\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.410\nEverything was under militaristic,\ntheory x, do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do style.\n\n146\n00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.530\nPeople just give edicts and\nsaid you do this or else.\n\n147\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.650\nThen the pendulum swung way over for\nmany years to management by numbers.\n\n148\n00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.080\nEverything was spreadsheets,\nand efficiency, and\n\n149\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.670\nspeed, and cost\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n150\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.210\npeople managed organizations\nlike people were cogs.\n\n151\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.190\nJust things they took in, moved out.\n\n152\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.840\nLay these hundred people off, fire these,\n\n153\n00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.230\nmove that thing,\nmove that off to another country.\n\n154\n00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:56.050\nNow the pendulum is in the middle\naround empathy, teamwork, leadership.\n\n155\n00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.400\nAnd there's a theory of leadership\nthat most of this is focused on,\n\n156\n00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.720\ncalled Servant Leadership\n&gt;&gt; By a gentleman named Greenleaf and\n\n157\n00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.290\nthis is all understand sort\nof the pyramid is flip.\n\n158\n00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:09.750\nAnd the leader is actually serve\nthe people that they quote and quote lead.\n\n159\n00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.720\nAnd because so much work today is\nbased on talent and making sure you\n\n160\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.160\n&gt;&gt; You can keep and grow the best talent\n\n161\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.870\nit's essential now that leaders create\ngreat relationships with their talents.\n\n162\n00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.560\nAnd that they're empathetic and\ncompassionate to their needs.\n\n163\n00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.720\nThe last C which leads beautifully\ninto that is contribution.\n\n164\n00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.850\nAnd what this means is,\nafter you have all those other Cs.\n\n165\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.370\nYou've got character, you're a great\ncommunicator, and you're compassionate,\n\n166\n00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.420\nand collaborator.\n\n167\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.950\nAnd you've built this up\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n168\n00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.090\nyou built a level of\nleadership authority and\n\n169\n00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.630\nyou've got access to resources, and\nyou've got some influence and some power.\n\n170\n00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.790\nThat now you take all that and\nyou give back.\n\n171\n00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.030\nThe phrase I like to use is,\n\n172\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.780\nyou plant the seeds of trees\nunder which you may never sit.\n\n173\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.560\nThat you make an investment\nin building other leaders\n\n174\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.840\nin doing things today that would ensure\nother leaders in your organization.\n\n175\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.340\nThat your organization Is successful,\nthat your team is successful.\n\n176\n00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.630\nSome of the companies I work with\nin Japan are a little bit different\n\n177\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.020\nthan the ones here.\n\n178\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.120\nIn America, because of Wall Street and\nother pressure,\n\n179\n00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.760\nwe often make very short term decision.\n\n180\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.830\nGotta get this done, finish this week,\ngotta make these numbers,\n\n181\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.980\ngotta meet Wall Street's expectation.\n\n182\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.309\nAnd we can be very short-sighted\nin the decisions we make.\n\n183\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.020\nWe see this sometimes when a CEO gets\nfired, and gets $100 million golden\n\n184\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.420\nparachute as they leave even though\nthey ran the company into the ground.\n\n185\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.155\n&gt;&gt; Be so lucky.\n\n186\n00:09:29.155 --> 00:09:34.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But some of the companies\nin Japan I work with, the CEO does\n\n187\n00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.820\nnot get paid a penny of their bonus until\n20 years after they leave the company.\n\n188\n00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.920\nSo that means they have to sit at\ntheir desk and make 20 year decisions.\n\n189\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.960\nNot what's best for\nthe company today but what's best for\n\n190\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.610\nthe company today, five years from now,\nten years from now.\n\n191\n00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.740\nSo when I look at contributions about\nhow can I take what I have learned as\n\n192\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:57.280\nthe leader and give it back to my people,\nmy community, my company and the world.\n\n193\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.060\nAnd leave a legacy of leadership.\n\n194\n00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not gonna be\nsomething that essentially\n\n195\n00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.180\naffects the stock price tomorrow.\n\n196\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.910\nBut it's gonna make the company better.\n\n197\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.010\nIt's gonna make the employees better.\n\n198\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.570\nAnd it's gonna work out well for everyone.\n\n199\n00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.360\nSo that's an interesting one\nI hadn't thought of before.\n\n200\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.520\nSo any closing thoughts on this one?\n\n201\n00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'd like to reiterate something\nwe talked about earlier that no matter\n\n202\n00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.830\nwhere in the organization you are\n&gt;&gt; you're a leader.\n\n203\n00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.420\nAnd maybe you don't feel like you're\na leader in your organization, but\n\n204\n00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.610\nyou are in your family, or\nyour community, or your hobby.\n\n205\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.710\nWhatever it might be, that all of these\nskills I'm teaching are effective for\n\n206\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.660\nleading in any situation at any level.\n\n207\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.370\n&gt;&gt; And if you're effective as a leader at\none level, then hopefully you can move on\n\n208\n00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.340\nto those further levels and\ncontinue to advance your career.\n\n209\n00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.090\nBut John, I'm looking at the clock and I\nthink we're All wrapped up on this episode\n\n210\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.830\nfor time so we're going to go ahead and\nwrap this one up but\n\n211\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.810\nwe have a lot more episodes on other\nprofessional development skills coming up.\n\n212\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.860\nSo be sure to stay tuned for those.\n\n213\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.580\nFor now I'm signing off for Biz Pro TV.\n\n214\n00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.170\nI'm Peter VanRosdam.\n\n215\n00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:54.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n216\n00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.806\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n217\n00:10:56.806 --> 00:11:05.996\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Peter VanRysdam, and\n\n4\n00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.201\ntoday we're continuing to talk\nabout professional development.\n\n5\n00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:16.180\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ntalking about how to be a trusted advisor.\n\n6\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.285\nAnd here to help us guide through that\nwe've got someone who I trust very much,\n\n7\n00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:21.280\nMr. John Spence.\n\n8\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.830\nJohn, how you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.830\n&gt;&gt; Great, Peter, and you?\n\n10\n00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.652\n&gt;&gt; I am fantastic, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:23.652 --> 00:00:24.370\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n12\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.060\n&gt;&gt; So\nin talking about being a trusted advisor,\n\n13\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.070\nlet's first take the first\npart of that and trust.\n\n14\n00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.010\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n15\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.899\nHow do we build trust\nwithin our organization?\n\n16\n00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.982\n&gt;&gt; Trust can be an ambiguous term,\nso I created my own definition,\n\n17\n00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:40.580\nwhich I call the four Cs of trust.\n\n18\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.510\nAnd that is you must\nconsistently communicate\n\n19\n00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.540\nthat you're competent and you care.\n\n20\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.320\nConsistently communicate you're competent,\nyou care.\n\n21\n00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.010\nLet's look at how I put those\ntogether in four levels of trust.\n\n22\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.710\nThe lowest level, or level one,\nis high competence, low concern.\n\n23\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.326\nI'm extremely good at what I do,\nvery talented, genius, brilliant, but\n\n24\n00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:00.955\nI'm an ass.\n\n25\n00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:03.960\n[LAUGH] We don't trust people like that.\n\n26\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.730\nThe word I use is respect.\n\n27\n00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.240\nI respect their skill,\ntheir talent, their expertise, but\n\n28\n00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.530\nI do not trust them because I know\nthey don't care about me at all.\n\n29\n00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.930\nThe next level is low confidence,\nlow concern.\n\n30\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.685\nI'm incompetent and I don't care, yeah,\nI work at the post office [LAUGH].\n\n31\n00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:21.704\nWell, I only say that because I was\nteaching some folks from the post office,\n\n32\n00:01:21.704 --> 00:01:23.290\nand one of them said, hey, that's us.\n\n33\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.820\nI go, that's not funny, and\nhe goes, no, that's us.\n\n34\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.178\nWe're incompetent, we don't care.\n\n35\n00:01:26.178 --> 00:01:27.991\nI guess it's just that one guy, I hope.\n\n36\n00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:31.430\nBut low competence,\nlow concern, that's distrust.\n\n37\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.860\nSomeone who's not smart,\ndoesn't have skills, and\n\n38\n00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.250\ndoesn't care about you, doesn't work.\n\n39\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.530\nThe next one is high concern,\nbut low competence.\n\n40\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.650\nReally nice person, incredibly friendly,\n\n41\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.800\nlove to have them over to the house\non a weekend for barbecue, or\n\n42\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.430\ngo play golf together, but\nunfortunately, they're incompetent.\n\n43\n00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.715\nAnd typically, when you have\nsomeone like that on your team,\n\n44\n00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:53.800\nyou're the one that has\nto do all their work.\n\n45\n00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.610\nSo the word I use there is affection.\n\n46\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.830\nI like them, they're kind, they're sweet.\n\n47\n00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.811\nAnd we have a saying for this South, as\nyou will know, Peter, he's trying so hard,\n\n48\n00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:04.453\nbless his heart, he's an idiot.\n\n49\n00:02:04.453 --> 00:02:05.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here in the South.\n\n50\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.300\n&gt;&gt; Here in the South, but so\nthat's high concern, but low competence.\n\n51\n00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300\nSo when we're looking at trying to\nbuild trust in an organization,\n\n52\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.400\ntrust as an individual,\nyou want high competence, high concern.\n\n53\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.070\nYou must consistently communicate\nyou're competent, you care.\n\n54\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.710\nHigh competence, high concern, and\nI can boil that all down to one phrase.\n\n55\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.100\nI'm good at what I do, and\nI do it because I care about you.\n\n56\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.870\nProblem with this is it can take a long\ntime to build up trust like that,\n\n57\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.210\nweeks, months, or years.\n\n58\n00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.270\nAnd you can lose it in just a few seconds.\n\n59\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.519\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I've done that before, I'm sure.\n\n60\n00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.372\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now that we understand trust,\n\n61\n00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:42.938\nhow do we take that into\nthis trusted advisor role?\n\n62\n00:02:42.938 --> 00:02:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm gonna really push this to\na high level because I have fairly high\n\n63\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.690\nexpectations around this\nidea of trusted advisor.\n\n64\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.810\nBecause I think it's one of the key things\nthat differentiates a good employee\n\n65\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.910\nfrom a great employer, salesperson, or\nIT technician, whatever it might be.\n\n66\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.780\nAnd so the first challenge is, what do you\nbelieve it would take to be first class?\n\n67\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.140\nWhat do you truly think to do your\njob the best in the world would do?\n\n68\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.740\nI'll give a very quick example.\n\n69\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.805\nWhen I decided I'd go into this field,\nbeing a consultant,\n\n70\n00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:16.943\na professional speaker trainer,\nI looked around the world.\n\n71\n00:03:16.943 --> 00:03:20.008\nAnd at that time, Tom Peters,\nwho wrote In Search of Excellence,\n\n72\n00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:22.800\na couple other books,\nwas number one in the world.\n\n73\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.780\nSo what I did is,\n\n74\n00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.360\nI wrote out a check list of everything\nTom Peters had done to become number one.\n\n75\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.330\nWhere did he work?\n\n76\n00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.370\nWhat was his expertise?\n\n77\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.045\nDid he write books?\n\n78\n00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:30.810\nWhere did he travel?\n\n79\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.970\nEverything.\n\n80\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.860\nI created that list, and\nthen I got up every day and\n\n81\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.470\nstarted checking stuff off that list.\n\n82\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.410\nAnd about four years ago,\nI actually got named with him as\n\n83\n00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.180\none of the top 100 professional leadership\nspeakers in the world, so I caught him.\n\n84\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.570\nAnd I don't say that to impress you,\n\n85\n00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.650\nbut to let you know that,\nthat's how easy it really is.\n\n86\n00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.610\nWhat would it take to be world class,\ncreate a very clear and\n\n87\n00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.490\nspecific checklist, then get up every day\nand just start checking stuff off that.\n\n88\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.690\nThat's the first step to\nbecoming a trusted advisor.\n\n89\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.170\nNow, I also have a couple of levels here\n\n90\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.580\nof what it takes to build yourself\nup to being a trusted advisor.\n\n91\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.614\nAt the lowest level,\nit's just good solid general business,\n\n92\n00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:11.585\neconomic global information,\nare you reading, studying?\n\n93\n00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.105\nNot to be an expert on it, but so\n\n94\n00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:16.620\nthat you can carry on a conversation\nwith your customer, your client.\n\n95\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.111\nYou see how other things impact your\nbusiness, your employer, the economy,\n\n96\n00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:23.777\njust good solid general\nbusiness knowledge.\n\n97\n00:04:23.777 --> 00:04:29.313\nLevel two is you must be an expert at your\njob, and I do not use that word lightly.\n\n98\n00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:33.910\nWhen I say expert, I mean, you've gotta\nbe really, really good at what you do.\n\n99\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.760\nConstantly learning, studying,\n\n100\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.620\nimproving, doing everything you can\nto be at the very top of your game.\n\n101\n00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.970\nNext, you've gotta\nunderstand your customer.\n\n102\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.870\nWhat do they want?\n\n103\n00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.320\nWhat's important to them?\n\n104\n00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.740\nWhat needs do they have?\n\n105\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.810\nWhat keeps them up at night?\n\n106\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.040\nWhat are they concerned about\naround their IT issues?\n\n107\n00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.560\nSo you gotta really understand\nyour customer deeply.\n\n108\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.750\nOnce you've got those levels,\nI've got good general business knowledge,\n\n109\n00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.340\ngood business acumen.\n\n110\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.744\nI'm world class at my job,\ntruly great at it.\n\n111\n00:05:03.744 --> 00:05:06.870\nI understand the people that\nI serve extremely well.\n\n112\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.280\nThat allows you to get to the highest\nlevel, which is the trusted advisor,\n\n113\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.560\na partner, and a peer.\n\n114\n00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.700\nWhere you bring solutions to problems\nthey didn't even know they had yet.\n\n115\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.640\nThat you're making recommendations, or\nI like to say, you see around the corner.\n\n116\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.220\nThat you help them by understanding\ntheir workload, what they're doing so\n\n117\n00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.410\nwell that you can figure out how to\nfix things before they go wrong.\n\n118\n00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.826\n&gt;&gt; Now John, a lot of what we've been\ntalking about leading up to this\n\n119\n00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:37.098\nin other episodes has been leadership and\nhow these skills can help you as a leader.\n\n120\n00:05:37.098 --> 00:05:40.989\nThis, to me, sounds like something that,\ndoesn't matter if you're a leader or not,\n\n121\n00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:43.514\nbut being a trusted advisor\ncan be something to strive for\n\n122\n00:05:43.514 --> 00:05:44.948\nin any position of the company.\n\n123\n00:05:44.948 --> 00:05:45.531\nIs that true?\n\n124\n00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:49.347\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to me, this is something that\nunderlines being a great employee, and\n\n125\n00:05:49.347 --> 00:05:52.400\nthis is an investment in you and\nyour career.\n\n126\n00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.220\nOnly about 5 to 10% of people ever\nget to the level of trusted advisor.\n\n127\n00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.620\nIt's not hard to do, but it takes a lot\nof work, and it takes a lot of homework.\n\n128\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.910\nThere's a three letter acronym I use\nto help people think about this.\n\n129\n00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.710\nYears ago,\n\n130\n00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.750\nI was asked by a large company to do\na speech on the essence of excellence.\n\n131\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.410\nAnd I got it down to three key\nletters to be truly excellent, FDA.\n\n132\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.210\nThe first one is focus,\nyou've gotta be extremely focused\n\n133\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.520\non your philosophy of excellence,\non that checklist we just talked about.\n\n134\n00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.860\nOn all the levels of becoming a trusted\nadvisor, especially that competence level.\n\n135\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.460\nYou gotta be intensely focused on that,\nlooking at it everyday.\n\n136\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.035\nThe D stands for discipline.\n\n137\n00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:36.160\nYou have to have the discipline\nto actually do it.\n\n138\n00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.750\nNot just put it on a notepad,\nnot just talk about it,\n\n139\n00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.200\nnot just make it a goal, but actually\nget up everyday and live that list,\n\n140\n00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.350\nlive what it takes to\nbe a trusted advisor.\n\n141\n00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.260\nAnd then the A stands for action.\n\n142\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.700\nThe amount of action you apply determines\nthe amount of results you get.\n\n143\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.520\nLittle bit of focus, not quite\nsure how to be a trusted advisor,\n\n144\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.650\nhow to take your career to the next level,\na little bit of discipline.\n\n145\n00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.050\nI know that I don't do it every day,\nor a little bit of action.\n\n146\n00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.750\nThe outcome is mediocrity, and once you\nstart accepting mediocrity in your life,\n\n147\n00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.300\nyou become a magnet for\nmediocrity in your life.\n\n148\n00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.570\nSo those are how I look at building up\nthis level of being a trusted advisor.\n\n149\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll never look at\nthe FDA the same way now.\n\n150\n00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.948\n[LAUGH] So are there any other tips or\n\n151\n00:07:15.948 --> 00:07:19.560\nsteps that we need to take\nto be that trusted advisor?\n\n152\n00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's two more\nthings I'd like to bring up.\n\n153\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.920\nOne was a big aha moment for\nme when I was early in my career.\n\n154\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.840\nBecause sometimes I felt like\nit was me versus my boss or\n\n155\n00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.260\nme versus one of the other departments.\n\n156\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.110\nOr when I was in sales,\nit was me versus the customer, and\n\n157\n00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.250\nthen I realized we all want the same\nthing, the exact right solution.\n\n158\n00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.260\nIf I bring in a solution that doesn't\nwork and I get it done quickly and\n\n159\n00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.660\nI think it's fantastic and\nI deliver it and I'm proud of it, but\n\n160\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.890\nit doesn't work for\nthe customer, it doesn't work.\n\n161\n00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.700\nSo, we're both on the same team.\n\n162\n00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.990\nIt's not me versus them arm wrestling.\n\n163\n00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.380\nIt's us working together as a team,\nas partners, to try to get the exact\n\n164\n00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.780\nright solution that's best for both of us,\nwhich is what a true trusted advisor does.\n\n165\n00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.620\nOne of the ways you do that,\n\n166\n00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.820\nwhich is my second point, is to be\nreally good at managing expectations.\n\n167\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.620\nI think a lot of problems happen when we\nhave poor communication, we don't clarify\n\n168\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.950\nthe expectations, and our client or\ncustomer has expectations way up here.\n\n169\n00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:15.800\nAnd we deliver this and\n\n170\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.770\nthink it's awesome, and\nthey still think that we failed.\n\n171\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.880\nSo if you can manage those expectations\nappropriately through good communications,\n\n172\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.550\nunderstanding your client, doing all that,\nthen you can set the expectations here.\n\n173\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.030\nWhere you know you can always meet or\n\n174\n00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.830\nexceed them consistently, which again,\npositions you as a trusted advisor.\n\n175\n00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's say now that you\ndidn't watch our earlier episode about\n\n176\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.690\nlistening skills.\n\n177\n00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.490\nCan you give us a quick recap,\n\n178\n00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:45.850\nkind of going back to how to build trust\nand then how to be a trusted advisor?\n\n179\n00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.360\n&gt;&gt; We just talked with trust is,\n\n180\n00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.040\nthe four Cs, consistently communicate\nyou're competent, you care.\n\n181\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.130\nOne of the most important ways you do\nthat is asking excellent questions.\n\n182\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.060\nAnd the best way to think of how\nto ask an excellent question is,\n\n183\n00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.020\nthink of the answer you wanna get.\n\n184\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.320\nI'm not being manipulative here.\n\n185\n00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.970\nI'm saying, what information do you need?\n\n186\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.780\nWhat data do you have to collect?\n\n187\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.440\nWhat is the answer I need?\n\n188\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.050\nThen back up and formulate a question\nthat will get the person to say that.\n\n189\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.680\nOne of the tricks that I always use is I\nwant to get the other person to tell me\n\n190\n00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.170\nwhat I want them to hear.\n\n191\n00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.590\nInstead of me saying, you need this,\nI wanna ask them enough questions,\n\n192\n00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.900\nthey say, I really need this.\n\n193\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.380\nYou go, great, I can deliver that for you.\n\n194\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.360\nAnd then the other thing around\nthat is to be an intense listener.\n\n195\n00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.330\nAnd that's all about summarizing,\nparaphrasing,\n\n196\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.030\nrepeating in your head over and\nover again.\n\n197\n00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.050\nBeing totally focused on\nthe person that's in front of you,\n\n198\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.890\ngiving you this extremely important\ninformation, writing good notes.\n\n199\n00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.410\nSo that they know, again as a trusted\nadvisor, you care about them.\n\n200\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.110\nYou've asked these great questions,\nyou're focused on their needs, and\n\n201\n00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.790\nyou're going to remember it.\n\n202\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.086\nBecause you took the time\nto take careful notes,\n\n203\n00:09:48.086 --> 00:09:51.054\nread them back to them,\nsummarized them, paraphrased them,\n\n204\n00:09:51.054 --> 00:09:53.861\nand clearly demonstrated that\nyou're good at what you do.\n\n205\n00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:55.663\nAnd you do it because you care about them.\n\n206\n00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:57.967\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI think this is a great goal to set for\n\n207\n00:09:57.967 --> 00:10:00.920\nyourself to become a trusted\nadvisor in your company.\n\n208\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.560\nIt helps you as an employee, helps you as\na leader, and it's something that you can\n\n209\n00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.440\nkinda put into action right away,\nso I think that's fantastic.\n\n210\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.450\nBut, John, it looks like we're about\nout of time for this episode, so\n\n211\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.140\nany closing thoughts?\n\n212\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.920\n&gt;&gt; Just the dedication\nof lifelong learning.\n\n213\n00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.980\nYou'll never be a trusted advisor\nunless you're insanely competent, so,\n\n214\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.750\nyou've gotta continue to invest\nin yourself and in your career.\n\n215\n00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.750\n&gt;&gt; Great, great ideas,\ngreat suggestions there.\n\n216\n00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.880\nSo that's gonna do it for us for\nthis episode on BIZPRO.TV, but\n\n217\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.630\nwe've got a lot more great content.\n\n218\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.390\nSo make sure to check that out.\n\n219\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.170\nBut signing off for now,\nI've been your host, Peter VanRysdam.\n\n220\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:34.930\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n221\n00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.851\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n222\n00:10:36.851 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:05.811 --> 00:00:07.432\nHello and welcome to BizProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:07.432 --> 00:00:09.050\nI'm your host Peter VanRsydam and\n\n3\n00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.680\ntoday we're continuing our series\nabout professional development.\n\n4\n00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.671\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngetting into some of the fun stuff,\n\n5\n00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.084\nthe fundamentals of negotiation.\n\n6\n00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:21.200\nAnd here to help us with that is a master\nnegotiator, our expert, John Spence.\n\n7\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.950\nJohn, how are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.920\n&gt;&gt; Great, Peter, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.140\n&gt;&gt; I am well, thank you.\n\n10\n00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.510\nSo, I'd like to talk about this.\n\n11\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.160\nWe're thinking about negotiation\nnormally in a sales process,\n\n12\n00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.510\nbut is this just for sales or\nis this negotiation across the business?\n\n13\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.361\n&gt;&gt; No.\nPretty much whatever role you play in\n\n14\n00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:40.705\na business, there's going to be\ntimes when you have to negotiate,\n\n15\n00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:44.051\ntimelines on projects, resources,\ngetting people on your team,\n\n16\n00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:47.300\nmaybe need some flex time, and\nyou can't turn things in on time.\n\n17\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.780\nSo there's always negotiations\ninside of an organization, and\n\n18\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.300\nuse some of the same elements as what you\nmight do for a sales negotiation, but\n\n19\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.870\nthey're a little bit different.\n\n20\n00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I'm assuming based on our\nprevious episodes that you either have\n\n21\n00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.990\nan acronym, or you have broken this\ndown into the six major points.\n\n22\n00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.610\nSo what do you got for us this time?\n\n23\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I have the five\nfundamentals of negotiation.\n\n24\n00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:11.530\n&gt;&gt; Five.\n\n25\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have gotta have a number on it.\n\n26\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.095\nAnd what I've done is I've taken several\nlarge courses, read a bunch of books,\n\n27\n00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:22.303\nnegotiated the largest deal I've\never negotiated was $3.2 billion.\n\n28\n00:01:22.303 --> 00:01:25.631\nA lot of experience, but I looked at\nit and said, out of all those things,\n\n29\n00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:28.369\nwhat are the three, four,\nfive and it turned out to be five,\n\n30\n00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.220\nkey things that if you do these well\nit's sort of the AD-20 principle.\n\n31\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.900\nSo, here are the five things you\nhave to do to be a great negotiator.\n\n32\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.050\nNumber one, be exceedingly well prepared,\n\n33\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.150\ndo you homework,\nwrite out notes, have a plan for\n\n34\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.380\nthe negotiation, make sure you collect\nlots of data, come to the negotiation.\n\n35\n00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.620\nAnd it depends on the size of negotiation.\n\n36\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.160\nIf I'm walking down the hallway to ask,\nif I can turn something in it 4:00\n\n37\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.380\no'clock this afternoon instead of at noon,\nI don't need to do a lot of prep.\n\n38\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.490\nIf I'm going to negotiate\na major project standards for\n\n39\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.860\nwhat people want in their work,\nall kinds of things like that\n\n40\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.970\nthat are much more detailed,\nreally gotta do a lot of homework.\n\n41\n00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.610\nSo step one is be\nexceedingly well prepared.\n\n42\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.390\n&gt;&gt; Tom can you, it's always helpful for\n\n43\n00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.950\nme when you have kind of\nan example to go off of.\n\n44\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.690\nSo let's put kind of\na story around this and\n\n45\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.210\nI think one negotiation that everybody\nis pretty used to is buying a car.\n\n46\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.660\nThat's something if you've\nnever been in business before,\n\n47\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.630\nyou've probably done that.\n\n48\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.920\nSo being prepared in\nthat case would be what?\n\n49\n00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.970\nGoing and doing your research online,\nchecking out prices at competitors,\n\n50\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.780\nthings like that.\n\n51\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.550\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n52\n00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.663\nYou go to CarFax,\nyou'd look online at several other.\n\n53\n00:02:36.663 --> 00:02:41.470\nYou pick a type of car you want and I'd\nlook at four or five dealers in the area.\n\n54\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.920\nI'd look at CarFax,\nI would look at motor trends to get\n\n55\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.620\nall the feedback I could and\ncreate a file.\n\n56\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.350\nFor two reasons, a,\nto show you have done your homework.\n\n57\n00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.370\nBut number two is when you\nwalk into the dealership,\n\n58\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.440\nthey can see that you're\nvery well prepared.\n\n59\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.180\nYou probably know as much or\nmore about the car and\n\n60\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.390\ntheir competitors than they do.\n\n61\n00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.750\nSo that shows them a very\nhigh level of preparation.\n\n62\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.530\nSame thing works internally when\nyou're negotiating with other people.\n\n63\n00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.750\nThe second thing about negotiations or\nnumber two is having lots of ways to win.\n\n64\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.050\nAnd it's one of my favorite phrases and\n\n65\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.350\nI think it's the two most\nfundamental things for negotiation.\n\n66\n00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.874\nTypically, whose having the best prepared\nto win and has most ways to win, wins.\n\n67\n00:03:25.874 --> 00:03:29.150\nSo let us go back to our car example.\n\n68\n00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.190\nIf I walk onto the lot and let me see,\n\n69\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.220\nI'll use an Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer,\ncuz I used to own one of those.\n\n70\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.830\nIf I walk on the Ford lot and I say,\nI'd like an Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer.\n\n71\n00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.380\nI'd like it in green, I want the leather\ninterior, I need the tow package,\n\n72\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.500\nI want the upgraded stereo,\nI wanna make sure it has tinted windows,\n\n73\n00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.790\nand it's got heated seats and\nI go through all these things.\n\n74\n00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.297\nThere's probably only one on\nthe lot that meets my criteria, and\n\n75\n00:03:56.297 --> 00:03:58.479\nnow the car dealer has all the leverage.\n\n76\n00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:03.350\nI only have one way to win, and\nthey hold the one thing that I wanna win.\n\n77\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.280\nSo I'm at a real disadvantage.\n\n78\n00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.080\nBut if I walked on the car lot and said\nI'm interested in buying a truck today.\n\n79\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.330\nIt doesn't even have to be a Ford.\n\n80\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.350\nI'd like a green, a brown,\nsomething like that.\n\n81\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.930\nJust not yellow or white,\nnot crazy about yellow or white.\n\n82\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.940\nAnd if I have to I can go with white.\n\n83\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.900\nI'd like something with a tow package but\nI can have it put on.\n\n84\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.990\nMoon roof would be nice, not necessary.\n\n85\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.800\nGotta have air conditioning,\nthat's for sure, live in Florida.\n\n86\n00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.690\nIt would be great if it had an upgraded\nstereo but it's not that big of a deal.\n\n87\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.510\nNow out of the 500 cars on the parking\nlot or trucks there's probably a dozen or\n\n88\n00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.120\nso that meet my criteria.\n\n89\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.460\nSo if they show me one and\nit isn't exactly what I want,\n\n90\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.620\nI can try to negotiate down on price.\n\n91\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.860\nIf they won't hit me there, I'll just\ngo fine, let's look at another one.\n\n92\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.076\nSo I have multiple ways to win.\n\n93\n00:04:50.076 --> 00:04:54.586\nAnd the way this now goes to\nnegotiating side of a business is,\n\n94\n00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:58.660\nI wanna win a,\nthis is my perfect outcome would be a, but\n\n95\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.620\nb would be acceptable too, and\nc would work, and I'd even go for d.\n\n96\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.536\nBut I can take part of a and\npart of d and put together for a two.\n\n97\n00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:11.564\nAnd now you've got all\nthis ways to switch and\n\n98\n00:05:11.564 --> 00:05:16.358\ncome up with deals that you're happy\nwith and other side is happy with.\n\n99\n00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.201\nSo again your gotta be extremely\nwell prepared and have lots and\n\n100\n00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:18.805\nlots of ways to win.\n\n101\n00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:22.311\n&gt;&gt; Yes, as I say don't put all your\neggs in one basket giving yourself\n\n102\n00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:26.819\nmultiple outcomes, then you're gonna find\nan option that's gonna work for you, so\n\n103\n00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:27.865\nthat makes sense.\n\n104\n00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:30.600\nSo that was number two,\nso what's number three?\n\n105\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Number three is I call\nthink I call the continuum.\n\n106\n00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.870\nAnd this is especially important for\ninternal negotiations.\n\n107\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.270\nWhen you begin a negotiation you\nhave to decide both for yourself and\n\n108\n00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.700\nthe other person,\nare they your negotiating partner?\n\n109\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.928\nAre they negotiating counterpart?\n\n110\n00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:48.050\nOr are they your negotiating opponent?\n\n111\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.640\nAnd the way you find out is you ask\nquestions and share information.\n\n112\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.940\nIf they're your negotiating partner,\nthey're gonna answer your questions.\n\n113\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.487\nThey're gonna give you data.\n\n114\n00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:57.710\nYou're gonna have a conversation.\n\n115\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.740\nThey're gonna do everything\nthey can to help you.\n\n116\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.170\nIt's truly gonna be aimed at win-win.\n\n117\n00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.811\nThat's your negotiating partner.\n\n118\n00:06:03.811 --> 00:06:08.750\nYou're negotiating counterpart is polite,\nbut not overly helpful.\n\n119\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.480\nThey're not aggressive, but they're\nnot giving you everything you want.\n\n120\n00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.880\nThey're just saying hey,\nlet's get a good deal.\n\n121\n00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.492\nI'm not particularly concerned\nif you're not very happy.\n\n122\n00:06:18.492 --> 00:06:21.350\nI wanna win, but I don't need you to lose.\n\n123\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.320\nI'm okay if we,\nit's just we walk away feeling all right.\n\n124\n00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.740\nAnd then if they're your negotiating\nopponent, that's lose win.\n\n125\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.460\nThey want you to lose and they win.\n\n126\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.002\nThey're not gonna give you information,\nyou ask questions.\n\n127\n00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:37.220\nOne of the best ways is to ask\nquestions you know the answer to and\n\n128\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.317\nsee if they tell you the truth,\nand here's the idea around,\n\n129\n00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:42.720\nI've got two big ideas around this.\n\n130\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.110\nIs as you enter the negotiation it's\nmy opinion at least that you should\n\n131\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.190\nassume that the other person\nis your negotiating partner.\n\n132\n00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.920\nAnd share information with them\nbe open and as soon as they\n\n133\n00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.980\ngive you a red flag they refuse to answer\na question they refuse to give you data.\n\n134\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.130\nThey give you data that\nyou know is not correct,\n\n135\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.050\nthen they jump up on the continuum not\nmy partner could be my counter part.\n\n136\n00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.680\nThen you ask them a few more questions.\n\n137\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.291\nYou negotiate for awhile.\n\n138\n00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:10.330\nYou see their position.\n\n139\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.160\nAnd now they're getting more aggressive.\n\n140\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.710\nAnd they're refusing to give you data.\n\n141\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.680\nAnd they're asking for things that\nyou really don't wanna give them.\n\n142\n00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.937\nNow you skip it up into\nnegotiating opponent.\n\n143\n00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:21.260\nBut here's what most people do.\n\n144\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.040\nThey walk in thinking\nwe're against each other.\n\n145\n00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.610\nAnd they start at opponent, opponent and\n\n146\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.160\nit's very hard to get to win-win when\nboth of you are being aggressive or\n\n147\n00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.760\nnot sharing information or trying to\nmake sure that you get the better deal.\n\n148\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.220\nPart two of that is you have to\nunderstand the relationship.\n\n149\n00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.760\nI'll give you an example on this one.\n\n150\n00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.290\nI had a friend years ago\nthat wanted to buy a car.\n\n151\n00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.780\nHis wife had just had another baby.\n\n152\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.893\nThey needed a big Suburban.\n\n153\n00:07:47.893 --> 00:07:52.710\nSo we went into the car dealership,\nand he found the car he wanted,\n\n154\n00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:59.347\nit was about $23,000 used Suburban,\nand he negotiated it down to $20,005.\n\n155\n00:07:59.347 --> 00:08:07.050\nAnd they get to the table, and the\nsalesperson says, all right, it's $20,005.\n\n156\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.050\nAnd my friend says no,\nI'm just gonna pay $20,000.\n\n157\n00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.850\nI wanna write a check for 2-0-0-0-0.\n\n158\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.182\nI don't want the $5.\n\n159\n00:08:13.182 --> 00:08:15.780\nAnd the salesperson goes no,\nyou're gonna give me the $5.\n\n160\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.610\nAnd you can see where this was going.\n\n161\n00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.870\nBack and forth, back and forth.\n\n162\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.350\nFinally the salesperson gets so\nexasperated he reaches into his pocket,\n\n163\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.970\npulls out $5, throws it on the table and\nsays, there, I'll pay the $5.\n\n164\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.880\nBut I hope you never have to\nbring it back for service.\n\n165\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.747\nSo if you plan to never\nsee this person again,\n\n166\n00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:36.243\nyou can negotiate very aggressively.\n\n167\n00:08:36.243 --> 00:08:38.846\nBut internal negotiations,\nmost of the time,\n\n168\n00:08:38.846 --> 00:08:43.810\nyou gotta see them in the hallway later,\nyou gotta work on other projects together.\n\n169\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:50.550\nSo having a competitive opponent style of\nnegotiation internally is not a good idea.\n\n170\n00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.660\n&gt;&gt; So it sounds like if you walk\ninto the negotiating room and\n\n171\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.440\nyou draw a line in the sand\nright at the beginning.\n\n172\n00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.930\nNot only are you setting that kinda\nadversarial relationship, but\n\n173\n00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.630\nyou're going against number two.\n\n174\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.620\nYou're saying here's my one outcome\nthat I'm gonna be happy with and\n\n175\n00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.100\nanything else looks like you're losing.\n\n176\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.945\nSo I think that's important.\n\n177\n00:09:07.945 --> 00:09:10.639\nCuz I think a lot of people go into those\nespecially with the car negotiating\n\n178\n00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:13.013\nexample go into that thinking,\nall right, this is my opponent.\n\n179\n00:09:13.013 --> 00:09:15.039\nAnd coming in with an open mind,\n\n180\n00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:18.880\nmaybe you don't tip your hand\ncompletely at the beginning.\n\n181\n00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.250\nBut you go until they give you signs\nthat it's going to be a problem.\n\n182\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.860\n&gt;&gt; And that reminds me of another idea.\n\n183\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.840\nThank you, Peter.\n\n184\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.810\nIs the idea of anchoring.\n\n185\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.740\nAnd what anchoring says is,\n\n186\n00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.940\nyou probably need to think about\nthe number you want and set that.\n\n187\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.660\nAnd typically,\n\n188\n00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.280\nwhoever sets the first number sets what\nthe negotiations are gonna evolve around.\n\n189\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.277\nIf you walk in and say, I don't wanna\nspend anything over $20,000 on this com,\n\n190\n00:09:43.277 --> 00:09:47.818\nabsolutely not, the salesperson is\ngonna try to sell you something for 22.\n\n191\n00:09:47.818 --> 00:09:49.650\n[LAUGH] So it's gonna be close.\n\n192\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.653\nBut if you say, I'm open to anything.\n\n193\n00:09:51.653 --> 00:09:55.020\nI just want to get the right car,\nthey're gonna start you at $30,000.\n\n194\n00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.540\nSo if you can set that first number at\nleast you pull everything to your number.\n\n195\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.120\nAnd you might negotiate\na little bit one way or\n\n196\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.940\nthe other, but you've anchored\nwhere the negotiation will start.\n\n197\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.450\n&gt;&gt; And I used to work with a salesperson.\n\n198\n00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.783\nThat kind of reminds me.\n\n199\n00:10:07.783 --> 00:10:11.560\nThey talked a lot about\nwhoever speaks last.\n\n200\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.520\nSo they would say, okay,\nthe price of this car is gonna be $20,000.\n\n201\n00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.540\nAnd then if there's silence in the room.\n\n202\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.840\nWell, that silence is awkward for\neveryone and they're waiting for\n\n203\n00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.400\nyou to say, okay or how about 18?\n\n204\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.640\nBut if you don't say anything then\nthe salesperson kinda starts to feel like,\n\n205\n00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.500\nokay, 19, how about 19?\n\n206\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And just shut your mouth.\n\n207\n00:10:30.785 --> 00:10:33.790\n[LAUGH] Put your pencil down,\njust wait and listen.\n\n208\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.570\nAnd let them come back with a number.\n\n209\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.890\n&gt;&gt; That was a famous IBM trick.\n\n210\n00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.548\nWhoever speaks last wins.\n\n211\n00:10:40.548 --> 00:10:44.170\nPut your number on the table,\nthen shut up.\n\n212\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.200\nThere's another neat thing that\nthey used in IBM in sales, but\n\n213\n00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.420\nthis works with negotiations, too,\nis creating what's called FUD.\n\n214\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.830\nFear, uncertainty, and doubt.\n\n215\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:11:00.220\nIf you can inject the element of emotion\nand fear and questioning yourself, and\n\n216\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:06.070\ndoubt, you're a lot less confident in your\nposition, and what you're negotiating for.\n\n217\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.160\nSo two big ideas that came from IBM.\n\n218\n00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.480\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\nAll right, so what's number four here?\n\n219\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.040\nNumber four is very similar to anchoring,\nbut\n\n220\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.300\nit's making sure you don't\nget off the anchoring point.\n\n221\n00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.070\nIt's called your BATNA.\n\n222\n00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.940\nAnd what your BATNA is,\nis your best alternative to\n\n223\n00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.180\na negotiated agreement, your BATNA.\n\n224\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.110\nAnother way to look at it,\nit's your walk away point.\n\n225\n00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.140\nWhat is the number or the date or the time\n\n226\n00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.460\nthat is your real line in the sand\nthat you absolutely can not go beyond?\n\n227\n00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.490\nIf you go beyond it you have made\na really bad deal for yourself.\n\n228\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.630\nSo in our car example,\nI walk in with a price in my head.\n\n229\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.110\nThe most I can humanly pay today,\nno matter what is $28000.\n\n230\n00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.300\nThat's it.\n\n231\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.273\nAnd as soon as we get to that point, if\nI'm disciplined and a good negotiator and\n\n232\n00:11:56.273 --> 00:11:59.926\nthey say it's $29,500,\nI go, no, can't do it.\n\n233\n00:11:59.926 --> 00:12:02.640\nAnd this can be hard sometimes.\n\n234\n00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.150\nSelling your house,\nthere's tough things that if\n\n235\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:10.700\nyou don't know your BATNA before you get\nthere, you will almost always cross it.\n\n236\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.176\nBecause you're thinking in your head,\nwell, 28, I could probably make 29500.\n\n237\n00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:16.570\nThen you get home, you realize,\nI can't afford this.\n\n238\n00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.040\nThis was a bad deal.\n\n239\n00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.970\nSo you've got to clearly sit down\nbefore you get to negotiation,\n\n240\n00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.412\nthink about what are the parameters\nthat make the least acceptable deal.\n\n241\n00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:29.857\nWhat's the worst deal I can make and\nstill feel good about it and\n\n242\n00:12:29.857 --> 00:12:32.900\nthat I didn't get totally\ntaken advantage of?\n\n243\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.396\nAnd that is your BATNA.\n\n244\n00:12:34.396 --> 00:12:37.140\nAnd if it gets beyond that,\nyou should walk away.\n\n245\n00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.465\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I do the same\nthing at the black jack table.\n\n246\n00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:41.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll say, all right,\n\n247\n00:12:41.276 --> 00:12:42.037\nI sit down with $100.\n\n248\n00:12:42.037 --> 00:12:45.840\nIf I get down to zero, I'm walking away,\nI'm not going to the wallet.\n\n249\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.440\nBut if I get up to 200,\nI'm walking away then too,\n\n250\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.680\ncuz I know if I keep playing\nI'm gonna lose it all.\n\n251\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.290\nSo, going in with those expectations and\nsaying,\n\n252\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.730\nhere's what I'm gonna be happy with.\n\n253\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.170\nI'd love to have this happen, but\nif this happens, I need to walk away and\n\n254\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.250\nstep away from the table.\n\n255\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's one of the biggest\nmistakes that people make.\n\n256\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.920\nAnd it actually leads to the fifth one,\nit's because they get emotional.\n\n257\n00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.140\nThey start to get angry or\nupset, or excited and\n\n258\n00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.060\nthey start to make decisions\noff the top of their head.\n\n259\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.390\nBut if you've done the other things,\n\n260\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.480\nyou've been well prepared, you've got lots\nof ways to win, you're negotiating from\n\n261\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.862\na place that is reasonable compared to how\nthe other person is negotiating from you.\n\n262\n00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:28.177\nYou've figure out your BATNA and\nyou know when it's a time to walk away,\n\n263\n00:13:28.177 --> 00:13:32.580\nthen if you start to get emotional we\nhave a thing we call go to the balcony.\n\n264\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.016\nAnd what go to the balcony means\nis you try to go up above and\n\n265\n00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:41.040\nlook down at yourself negotiating and\nsaying am I following all my own rules?\n\n266\n00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.760\nAm I keeping my data in mind?\n\n267\n00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.311\nAm I focused on my BATNA?\n\n268\n00:13:44.311 --> 00:13:47.642\nAm I getting emotional and\nneed to take a break?\n\n269\n00:13:47.642 --> 00:13:49.492\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; That's what I thought you meant when\n\n270\n00:13:49.492 --> 00:13:53.305\nyou said go to the balcony of I need to\nstep outside for a minute and calm down.\n\n271\n00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:56.040\n&gt;&gt; Well let's use a great\nexample around that.\n\n272\n00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.400\nThere's a typical negotiations gambit,\nis what they call them,\n\n273\n00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.660\ncalled good cop bad cop.\n\n274\n00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.419\nThis is kinda like when the car person\nbrings their sales manager in and\n\n275\n00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:08.943\nyou're negotiating and the salesperson's\nlike man I'd love to sell this to you for\n\n276\n00:14:08.943 --> 00:14:12.400\n28,000 but my boss he's not\nletting it go for under 29.\n\n277\n00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.640\nIt's not my fault.\n\n278\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.030\nThen the boss comes in, the manager,\nand they start to beat up on you.\n\n279\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.822\nThis is oftentimes just a tactic,\na trick, to put pressure on you.\n\n280\n00:14:20.822 --> 00:14:25.698\nAnd what you do then is you say I had\na big Diet Coke before I came in,\n\n281\n00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.020\nand I just need a minute or two.\n\n282\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.250\nWhy don't you guys talk amongst yourselves\nand I'll be back in four or five minutes.\n\n283\n00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.420\nAnd you go off and go to the balcony.\n\n284\n00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.120\nRest, relax, regain, come back.\n\n285\n00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.530\nIf they're still angry,\none's still angry, you say,\n\n286\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.460\nyou seem a little frustrated and\npossibly need to take a breather.\n\n287\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.865\nAnd actually I'm a little thirsty, you\nhave any water, could I have some water?\n\n288\n00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:49.140\n[LAUGH] And you go take another break.\n\n289\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:54.620\nHere's what happens, after two or three\ntimes they either, you figured out that\n\n290\n00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.760\none is actually against you or\nit's a trick and they'll quit it.\n\n291\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.940\nOr you can use one other thing which\nis fine, I'll just put this out.\n\n292\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.240\nIf one plays good cop and\n\n293\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.670\nthe other one plays bad cop, what you\ndo is you ask the bad cop to leave and\n\n294\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.510\nyou tell the good cop, hey listen,\nwe're on the same team here man.\n\n295\n00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.510\nWe both want the same thing.\n\n296\n00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.740\nWe've been working on this.\n\n297\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.900\nYou're really on my team, right?\n\n298\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.680\nAnd they say yeah,\nI'm trying to help you John.\n\n299\n00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.860\nI can't understand why he's\nnot negotiating with us.\n\n300\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.860\nIt's driving me crazy.\n\n301\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.190\nAnd you say great, then I want you\nto go negotiate with him for me, and\n\n302\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.750\ncome back with my answer.\n\n303\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.980\nAnd tell him or her that, if they continue\nto be aggressive, rude, angry, or mean,\n\n304\n00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.640\nI'm just gonna get up and leave.\n\n305\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.460\nAnd you pit them against themselves.\n\n306\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.500\nSo if you go out enough times and\ncalm down, or\n\n307\n00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.130\nyou pit them against themselves,\ntypically they'll end the tactic.\n\n308\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.550\nThey'll realize it isn't gonna work.\n\n309\n00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.709\nHowever, if they continue to do that, what\nthey've told you is one of them really is\n\n310\n00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.716\nangry, mad, or upset, or maybe both.\n\n311\n00:15:44.716 --> 00:15:47.380\nAnd here's a big,\nbig key point I can end on.\n\n312\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.290\nNever, ever negotiate with someone\nthat's angry or aggressive or\n\n313\n00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.830\nhighly emotional, cuz it is impossible\n\n314\n00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:59.760\nto get to a win-win agreement negotiating\nwith someone that doesn't want you to win.\n\n315\n00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, John, I was about to tell you,\nwe're kind of ramped up on time here,\n\n316\n00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.490\nand was gonna look for a key takeaway.\n\n317\n00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.570\nThat sounds like a great one.\n\n318\n00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.255\nAnd also, what did you say earlier,\nthe most prepared-\n\n319\n00:16:08.255 --> 00:16:10.312\n&gt;&gt; Who's ever the best prepared to win,\n\n320\n00:16:10.312 --> 00:16:13.170\nand has the most ways to win,\ntypically wins.\n\n321\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.940\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic I think that’s a great place\nfor us to stop for negotiating, but\n\n322\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.990\nwe got a lot of great episodes coming up\nin this professional development series.\n\n323\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.430\nSo, be sure to stay tuned for those, but\nfor now we’re gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n324\n00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.080\nFor Biz pro TV,\nI’ve been your host Peter Vanrysban.\n\n325\n00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.960\n&gt;&gt; And I’m John Spence.\n\n326\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.800\n&gt;&gt; And we’ll see you next time.\n\n327\n00:16:29.800 -->

host Peter VanRysdam, and today,\n\n4\n00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:13.190\nwe're continuing in our series\nabout professional development.\n\n5\n00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.290\nAnd specifically today, we're talking\nabout something I could've used in a lot\n\n6\n00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.570\nof my relationships at\nhome conflict resolution.\n\n7\n00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.230\nAnd here to help us is someone who,\nwe haven't had any conflicts yet,\n\n8\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.750\nbut we'll see.\n\n9\n00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.870\nSo John Spence, how you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.460\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\nI'm looking forward to this too.\n\n11\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.280\nI think it's one of those things you\nshould have been taught at an early age,\n\n12\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.920\nand most of it learn it by chance.\n\n13\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.009\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\nI think within business,\n\n14\n00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:39.189\nthere's oftentimes a lot of conflict,\npersonalities clash, things like that,\n\n15\n00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:43.270\nor even in negotiations in meetings\nif you have different ideas.\n\n16\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.260\nSo where do we start\nwith conflict resolution?\n\n17\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.678\n&gt;&gt; Well we start with first the idea,\nthat conflict can be healthy.\n\n18\n00:00:48.678 --> 00:00:53.310\nThere is some good interactions,\n\n19\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.210\nmaybe some strong interactions,\nreally getting excited, or motivated,\n\n20\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.200\nor passionate about something,\nis not necessarily a negative conflict.\n\n21\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.680\nOne of my clients, Microsoft,\n\n22\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.910\nhas a great saying,\nthat people are safe, ideas are not.\n\n23\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.360\nAnd the idea when they get in a meeting\nis, I'm not going to attack anyone at\n\n24\n00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.310\nthe table, but I'm gonna rip every\nidea apart, make it the best I can.\n\n25\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.810\nAnd I think that's a great\nexample of very healthy conflict.\n\n26\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.210\n&gt;&gt; And it sounds like, maybe don't take\nan idea that you had too personally then.\n\n27\n00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.700\nThis is just your idea that\nyou're throwing out and\n\n28\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.770\nif the idea gets ripped apart,\nthat's the idea, and not you as a person.\n\n29\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nbecause it's everyone's job there.\n\n30\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.580\nThey tell everybody when we go\ninto one of these sessions,\n\n31\n00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.050\nthe goal is to get the best idea.\n\n32\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.730\nSo all of you should throw in other ideas,\nother suggestions, and\n\n33\n00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.540\ndo your best to make whatever great\nidea somebody put out even better.\n\n34\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.180\nSo nobody takes it personally.\n\n35\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.970\nIt's the way that they do the same thing\nwhen someone else throws out an idea.\n\n36\n00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.240\nAnother big thing around conflict\nis mostly it isn't me versus you.\n\n37\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.280\nIt's a miscommunication.\n\n38\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.780\nSomeone didn't fully understand\nwhat the other person was saying.\n\n39\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.360\nThey made an assumption.\n\n40\n00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.690\nThey inferred things, or they simply\nhave two different points of view which\n\n41\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.290\nare both valid but different, and\nthey don't understand each other.\n\n42\n00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.270\nAnd they actually can't understand how\nthe other person would feel that way.\n\n43\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.645\n&gt;&gt; And maybe you wanna go back and\nwatch the video we did about listening.\n\n44\n00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:22.940\n[LAUGH] Because, I think, it could be\nthat you weren't completely listening.\n\n45\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.310\nYou were thinking about your idea,\nand what you were gonna say next.\n\n46\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.130\nAnd didn't realize that maybe you're\ntalking about the same thing here, but\n\n47\n00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.340\nyou're just saying it\nin two different ways.\n\n48\n00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.240\nSo make sure you're paying attention and\ntaking notes and\n\n49\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.350\ndoing all those things we\ntalked about in that episode.\n\n50\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well that's one of\nthe main things to do here.\n\n51\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.100\nIs to take your time, ask good questions,\nback up for a minute, go slow.\n\n52\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.130\nListen intently, write notes,\nhave good body language, and\n\n53\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.530\nreally try to put yourself in\nthe other person's shoes and\n\n54\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.570\nunderstand what they're\nthinking without your own bias.\n\n55\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.000\nI'll give you an example of this,\nit's sort of a fun one.\n\n56\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.700\nIn many parts of the world\npeople love to eat bugs.\n\n57\n00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.940\nIt's part of their main diet,\nit's commonplace there.\n\n58\n00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.690\nMatter of fact,\nin some places, big, giant,\n\n59\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.980\njuicy bugs are their favorite things!\n\n60\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.795\nNot so much for me.\n\n61\n00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:16.250\n[LAUGH] I prefer a big,\n\n62\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.730\njuicy steak, which in other parts of\nthe world would make them nauseous.\n\n63\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.720\nThey would think it's the most disgusting\nthing in the world to be eating a big,\n\n64\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.250\njuicy piece of cow, or meat, or anything.\n\n65\n00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.360\nBut the key is is those\nare both valid beliefs.\n\n66\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.710\nThose are both valid ideas.\n\n67\n00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.640\nAnd if you can't get past the part\nthat you just see things differently,\n\n68\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.200\nyou're not against me,\nthen conflict becomes unhealthy.\n\n69\n00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.440\nSo it's that idea of listening, backing\nup, taking an extra minute, trying to put\n\n70\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.810\nyourself in the other person's shoes, and\nreally withholding your own judgment.\n\n71\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.230\nAnd Stephen Covey from Seven Habits of\nHighly Effective People had a great pro\n\n72\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.270\nhere, seek first to understand\nthan to be understood.\n\n73\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think there's no conflict\nhere cuz I'm on the same page.\n\n74\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.490\nI'll take the steak over the cockroach or\nthe sautéed scorpion any day but\n\n75\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.390\nhow, what are some of the ways that we can\nmake sure we avoid that kind of confusion?\n\n76\n00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.020\n&gt;&gt; Well there's a couple of things before\nwe get into what I call the five levels of\n\n77\n00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.240\nconfrontation that I want to throw on\nthe table as another idea on this.\n\n78\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.320\nThe first one is states versus traits.\n\n79\n00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.310\nThe way you look at this\nis if this is just a state.\n\n80\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.060\nThis person is just angry today or\nfrustrated or something bad happened at\n\n81\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.830\nhome or they didn't get enough sleep or\nthey're not feeling good.\n\n82\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.970\nThen you need to give him you\nknow the benefit of the doubt.\n\n83\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.200\nGive him a little leeway.\n\n84\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.220\nThey're just in a bad state today.\n\n85\n00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.290\nThe reverse is if this is a trait.\n\n86\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.040\nIt's who they are all the time.\n\n87\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.820\nIt never changes.\n\n88\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.560\nThen also don't take it personally because\nyou realize it isn't this situation.\n\n89\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.810\nIt isn't me.\n\n90\n00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.873\nThey're mat at everybody,\nthat's just who they are.\n\n91\n00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.755\nSo states versus traits.\n\n92\n00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:55.928\nAlong that thing is an idea\nthat I call the evil people.\n\n93\n00:04:55.928 --> 00:05:00.208\n[LAUGH] Everybody in our life has a few\npeople who are constantly in a state\n\n94\n00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:04.630\nof aggression, they're angry,\nthey're mad, they're frustrated,\n\n95\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.350\nthey're prejudicial, they're constantly\ncausing trouble, and they're evil.\n\n96\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.960\nAnd there's nothing you can do about it.\n\n97\n00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.340\nThe only defense to an evil\nperson is distance.\n\n98\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.510\nGet away from them.\n\n99\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.100\nMinimize your exposure.\n\n100\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.190\nAnd if I could magically come in and\nremove those two or\n\n101\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.730\nthree evil people from your life,\nthree more reach up the next day.\n\n102\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.990\nSo, you just have to realize that,\nthat's part of your life.\n\n103\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.020\nWhich brings me to another key point, read\na big books about a thousand pages and\n\n104\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.940\nblow the whole book down to one key\nidea that whenever anyone is ugly or\n\n105\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.150\nmean or rude or prejudicial,\nit's a cry for help or loving response.\n\n106\n00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.720\nThey're either trying to tell you-\nI don't hate you, I hate myself or\n\n107\n00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.300\nmy life or I'm so unhappy,\nand you look happy.\n\n108\n00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.270\nI have to take it out on you.\n\n109\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.040\nCuz I can't stand seeing you happy,\njoyful,\n\n110\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.530\nhaving a great life,\nwhile I'm so miserable.\n\n111\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.050\nSo, it's hard to understand that but\nthat means it's not me, it's them.\n\n112\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.100\nIt's nothing I've done.\n\n113\n00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.880\nIt's something that's\ngoing on in their life.\n\n114\n00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.420\nIt's a cry for help.\n\n115\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.360\nThey're in pain but\nthey're taking the pain out on me.\n\n116\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.360\nThe other side of that is\nit's a loving response.\n\n117\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.010\nSomeone has said something to me\nthat I take as painful or hurtful or\n\n118\n00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.380\nthat they're against me.\n\n119\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.620\nBut they're doing it because they truly\nhonestly have my best interest at heart.\n\n120\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.894\nGreat example of this is if you have\na kid, young big kid and the kid goes,\n\n121\n00:06:23.894 --> 00:06:25.628\n[SOUND] and they put their hand inside.\n\n122\n00:06:25.628 --> 00:06:27.110\nYou go, don't put your hand in that.\n\n123\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.600\nAnd they look at me and go, I hate you.\n\n124\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.315\nAnd you go, no sweetheart,\nI'm only doing this because I love you.\n\n125\n00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:36.360\n[LAUGH] So when someone does\nget confrontational with you.\n\n126\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.680\nYou wanna back up and say,\nis it a state or trait.\n\n127\n00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.470\nIf it's a trait, are they an evil person.\n\n128\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.270\nAnd if they are an person is this\na cry for help or a loving response?\n\n129\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.730\n&gt;&gt; Misery loves company.\n\n130\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sounds like.\n\n131\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.580\nSo John, you mentioned that there are five\n\n132\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.030\nlevels of conflict you\nwanted to talk about.\n\n133\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.340\nWhat are those?\n\n134\n00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.680\n&gt;&gt; Sure,\nlevel one is basically zero conflict.\n\n135\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.530\nYou're starting to get into the conflict,\n\n136\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.740\nyou can tell this isn't\ngonna go the right way.\n\n137\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.880\nAnd you just shut up and listen.\n\n138\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.080\nYou give the other person the full floor.\n\n139\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.340\nYou don't interrupt them.\n\n140\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.650\nYou don't defend.\n\n141\n00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.670\nYou don't try to give\nthem other information.\n\n142\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.830\nYou just sit and listen with\nfully trying to understand them.\n\n143\n00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.070\nBy the way, very, very few people do this.\n\n144\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.650\nIf you just learn this one thing,\nthat when someone else is upset,\n\n145\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.960\nto just say, I can tell you're upset.\n\n146\n00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.940\nI could see you're a little frustrated.\n\n147\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.650\nLet me just sit here and listen to you for\n\n148\n00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.960\nas long as you think\nyou need to talk to me.\n\n149\n00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.370\nUntil you feel like I understand\nwhat you're upset about.\n\n150\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.740\nFirst of all they'll pass out cuz no\none's ever done it to them before.\n\n151\n00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.570\nAnd most of the time they'll talk\nthemselves out of being angry or\n\n152\n00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.800\nthey'll give you the information you need.\n\n153\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.240\nTo go ahead and settle the conflict.\n\n154\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.880\nSo that's level one, listen,\ndon't interrupt, shut up.\n\n155\n00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.230\nLevel two is I statements.\n\n156\n00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.740\nAnd what I statements say is,\nI've listened to you and\n\n157\n00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.320\nfrom my point of view here's\nwhat it seems is happening.\n\n158\n00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.800\nNot I think you're wrong, you say,\nI understand what you said But\n\n159\n00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.040\nthe way I see it is slightly different.\n\n160\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.330\nAnd this is how I see it.\n\n161\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.860\nOr I'm confused.\n\n162\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.920\nThe way I'm looking at this and\n\n163\n00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.770\nfrom my own experience it seems to me\nthat this might be another option.\n\n164\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.040\nSo you're not attacking them.\n\n165\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.260\nYou're saying I listened to you,\n\n166\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.610\nI understood you, now let me tell\nyou how I see the situation.\n\n167\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.920\nThat's level two.\n\n168\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.770\nLevel three is called negotiation.\n\n169\n00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.120\nAnd basically, negotiation,\n\n170\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.080\nthis is what it is, I've listened to you,\nyou've listened to me.\n\n171\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.440\nWe don't agree, can we sit down\ntogether and work through this and\n\n172\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.940\nuse the negotiation skills we taught\nearlier, about coming to a win,\n\n173\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.120\nwin agreement that we\nboth feel good about?\n\n174\n00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.420\nThat level three.\n\n175\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.470\nLevel four is called\ngentle confrontation and\n\n176\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.514\nin gentle confrontation which basically\ngonna say is I have listen to you,\n\n177\n00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:54.960\nyou've listened to me, we've attempted\nto negotiate this and we can't do to\n\n178\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.590\nnegotiation it would be really helpful\nif you change your actions or behaviors.\n\n179\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.180\nAnd if you don't something\nbad might happen.\n\n180\n00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.170\nAnd the example I use is someone\nturns in their work late or\n\n181\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.820\nshows up to a meeting late.\n\n182\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:13.200\nAnd you say you know Peter when you show\nup to a meeting late it holds us all back\n\n183\n00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.320\nand we can't get started on time\nwhich means we run overtime.\n\n184\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.190\nAnd it's really difficult for\nthe rest of us.\n\n185\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.420\nAnd it would be wonderful if you\ncould make an extra point to show up\n\n186\n00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.640\nat meetings on time If not, it's gonna\nbecome a real uncomfortable situation.\n\n187\n00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:33.360\nSo I've asked you to please change your\nbehavior or do what I need you to do.\n\n188\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.000\nAt the highest level it's firm or\ndirect confrontation.\n\n189\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.320\nAnd at this level you use\nall the other things.\n\n190\n00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.120\nI've listened to you,\nyou've listened to me, no negotiation.\n\n191\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.490\nI've politely asked you to change,\nyou won't.\n\n192\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:47.460\nSo Peter,\n\n193\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.345\nif you don't start showing up to meetings\non time, you won't work here, anymore!\n\n194\n00:09:50.345 --> 00:09:54.710\n[LAUGH] And here's the thing that I've\nlearned after twenty years of doing it.\n\n195\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.340\nOr I'll ask you, Peter,\nwhere do you think most people start?\n\n196\n00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.170\n&gt;&gt; They probably start at number five.\n\n197\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:09:59.830\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n198\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.530\nYou start at five, and once you're there\nyou've got no, you can't back down.\n\n199\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.220\nSo it doesn't take hours to do this, it\nmight take only a couple of minutes to go\n\n200\n00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.980\nthrough the five stages, but as most\npeople, if you start at level five, you've\n\n201\n00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.180\nalready started at the most escalated\nconflict and there's no way to go back and\n\n202\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.130\nstart at level one, or\nit's exceedingly challenging.\n\n203\n00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.910\nSo start at level one and\nmove to level five.\n\n204\n00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.950\nIt might only take a minute or\nseveral minutes.\n\n205\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.190\nBut it will make all the difference.\n\n206\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.730\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I was gonna ask, so you\nwant to start at level one is what you're\n\n207\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.290\nsaying not not just kind of pick\nwhich level based on what you think\n\n208\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.990\nthe situation warrants or what type of\nperson or traits you're seeing with them?\n\n209\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah unless you've got someone who is\ntruly an evil person and the conflict is\n\n210\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.310\nalready out, even then I would recommend\ntry and to start at level one.\n\n211\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.720\nIt might be especially challenging,\nit might take at extra lot of effort.\n\n212\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.860\nBut on the normal conflict with you know,\nco-workers in a meeting or something like\n\n213\n00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.550\nthat, and in specially home, by all means,\nstart at level one and move your way up.\n\n214\n00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.220\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like once you recognise\nthat there is conflict, just try and\n\n215\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.400\nkeep your emotions in check.\n\n216\n00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.930\nAnd that way you won't\njust jump to number five.\n\n217\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.930\nBut you'll be able to start at listening.\n\n218\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.370\nSo what else John?\n\n219\n00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.810\nAny other points about\nconflict resolution?\n\n220\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.050\n&gt;&gt; Well you just said one of\nthe most important things.\n\n221\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.490\nAnd there's an extremely powerful tool\n\n222\n00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.450\nI teach around keeping your emotions\nin check, and it's called the gap.\n\n223\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.510\nAnd what the gap means is no matter what\nhappens, no matter what someone says,\n\n224\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.690\nno matter what happens in your life,\nno matter what someone does,\n\n225\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.510\nthere is always a gap between stimulus and\nresponse.\n\n226\n00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.050\nWhen something happens and\nhow you choose to respond to it.\n\n227\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.310\nPeople that don't handle\ntheir emotions well.\n\n228\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.280\nThose things are connected.\n\n229\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.280\nSomething happens, they automatically blow\nup, get excited, get angry, yell, scream.\n\n230\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.370\nAnd it might be a millisecond or\nten seconds or a minute.\n\n231\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:50.510\nBut people that can get control of\nthat gap and say, this just happened.\n\n232\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.310\nHow do I wanna respond?\n\n233\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.900\nAnd this,\nthe tool I teach is the ideal you.\n\n234\n00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.100\nIf under tremendous pressure, and\n\n235\n00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.950\nthe conflict strain,\nyou're starting to get angry.\n\n236\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.040\nIf you could stop and say,\nnow what do I feel like doing?\n\n237\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.100\nOr I can get away with?\n\n238\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:04.810\nOr what are the rules?\n\n239\n00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.380\nBut what would the ideal me do here?\n\n240\n00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.970\nIf I could handle this conflict elegantly,\nbeautifully, and\n\n241\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.250\nin a way I was extremely\nproud of it what would I do?\n\n242\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.320\nAnd I coach people to get it\ndown to a couple of keywords.\n\n243\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.580\nMine are kind, loving, gentle.\n\n244\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.950\nIt's kind of hard to yell or scream,\n\n245\n00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.960\nget out of control, threaten people\nif in the back of my mind I'm saying,\n\n246\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.870\nwhen something happens I must be kind,\nloving and gentle.\n\n247\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.830\nAnd this is a learned skill.\n\n248\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:35.340\nFor those of you that lose your emotions\na lot, lose your temper, you try this and\n\n249\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.530\nyou'll get it one out of ten times.\n\n250\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.180\nThen it's three out of ten times,\nand then it's eight.\n\n251\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.380\nAnd eventually over the course of years,\n\n252\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.600\nusually, you will get to where nine\ntimes out of ten you can stop.\n\n253\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.270\nYou can think about where\nyou want to be in that gap.\n\n254\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.900\nAnd then you can act and\nbehave like the ideal you.\n\n255\n00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.475\nAnd it totally changes the way you\ninteract with other people during\n\n256\n00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:55.210\nconflict.\n\n257\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Great, so one of the things that I, the\nkey take aways that I have from this is\n\n258\n00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:03.340\nit's not necessarily just about avoiding\nconfrontation because not only is.\n\n259\n00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.560\nIs confrontation is always going\nto come up in form or another.\n\n260\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.780\nBut confrontation isn't always bad either.\n\n261\n00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.810\nSo it's more about going through these\nsteps, identifying the type of person you\n\n262\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.940\nhave that conflict with and figuring out\nthe best way to resolve it, and do so\n\n263\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.140\nin a peaceful and professional manner.\n\n264\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n265\n00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.530\nI think the big take away I would leave\nyou is it's not about you, typically.\n\n266\n00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.650\nIt's a miscommunication,\n\n267\n00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.260\nyou see things differently,\nyou both have different information.\n\n268\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.080\nVery, very rarely it is\na personal confrontation\n\n269\n00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.826\nIt's usually over information data or\nmisunderstandings.\n\n270\n00:13:34.826 --> 00:13:38.820\n&gt;&gt; And if you're at a company that\nhas no conflict in the boardroom or\n\n271\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.610\nat the negotiating table you're probably\nnot getting all the ideas out and\n\n272\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.570\nyou don't have an environment that's\nreally conducive to people having that\n\n273\n00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.600\nkind of discussion.\n\n274\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.490\nBut that is kind of a great point for\n\n275\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.000\nus to leave off on this episode\ncuz we are out of time.\n\n276\n00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.540\nBut we've got a lot more great\nepisodes coming up on more\n\n277\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.480\nprofessional development skills, so\nbe sure to stay tuned for those.\n\n278\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.770\nBut for now, we're going to sign off for\nBusiness Pro TV.\n\n279\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.830\nI've been your host, Peter Van Reisdam.\n\n280\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.428\n&gt;&gt; And I'm John Spence.\n\n281\n00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:04.928\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n282\n00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:14.928\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Peter VanRysdam.\n\n4\n00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:12.770\nAnd today, we're continuing in our\nseries on professional development.\n\n5\n00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.840\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\nwe're talking about some key ideas for\n\n6\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.670\ncareer development, and here to help\nus we have the expert in house.\n\n7\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.810\nThe entrepreneur, the speaker,\nthe business coach, the everything,\n\n8\n00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.430\nJohn Spence.\n\n9\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.065\nJohn how are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:25.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm doing great today.\n\n11\n00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.358\nThanks Peter.\n\n12\n00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:29.145\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what are we talking\nabout when say career development today?\n\n13\n00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:33.241\n&gt;&gt; Oftentimes I'm asked to give talks\nat universities, or things like that,\n\n14\n00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.899\nabout what are the most important\nelements to build a great career.\n\n15\n00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.638\nAnd this works anywhere in your career,\nbut they're things that I see as\n\n16\n00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:44.502\nfundamental to truly building a highly\nsuccessful career that you enjoy,\n\n17\n00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:48.500\nthat you're passionate about,\nand that you're very good at.\n\n18\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.840\nAnd I'm gonna be borrowing from\na couple of my friends that are authors\n\n19\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.070\nthat have really put forward some great\nideas that are succinct and spot on.\n\n20\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.200\nAnd the first one is from a friend\nof mine named Tim Sanders.\n\n21\n00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.110\nAnd Tim wrote a great book\ncalled Love is the Killer App,\n\n22\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.460\nas in application as IT thing there.\n\n23\n00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.020\nAnd what he talked about is\nthe three key things it takes\n\n24\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.310\nto build a world class career.\n\n25\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.080\nAnd I think he just nailed it here.\n\n26\n00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.240\nAnd the three things are K-N-L, K-N-L.\n\n27\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.080\nThe K stands for knowledge.\n\n28\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.010\nYou've got to be bright, sharp, smart,\n\n29\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.880\nand talented at something that's\nhighly valuable in the marketplace.\n\n30\n00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.050\nYou've got to have skills, ideas,\n\n31\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.340\nexpertise, information that people\nare more than willing to pay for.\n\n32\n00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.970\nSo you've got to be highly\nknowledgeable at something that's very,\n\n33\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.550\nvery valuable in the marketplace.\n\n34\n00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.950\nThat's the K.\n\n35\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.040\nThe N stands for network.\n\n36\n00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.340\nA lot of the right people need to know\nthat about you, and by right people,\n\n37\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.350\nit's what I call hubs.\n\n38\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.460\nAnd a hub is somebody that,\nby the nature of who they are,\n\n39\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.510\nif they're really impressed with what\nyou know, they don't tell a few people.\n\n40\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.270\nThey tell a few hundred, a few thousand,\nor a few hundred thousand, or more.\n\n41\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.170\nI'll give you a great example.\n\n42\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.670\nWhen I wrote my book Awesomely Simple\nseveral years ago it was doing okay.\n\n43\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.120\nIt won a few awards, not that great.\n\n44\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.150\nAnd it was number 1131 on the bestseller's\nlist on Amazon, not so much.\n\n45\n00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.530\nBut then Guy Kawasaki, a colleague,\n\n46\n00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.850\nthe former marketing director at Apple was\nkind enough to put out a tweet about it.\n\n47\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.890\nAnd he suggested, read John Spence's book,\nAwesomely Simple,\n\n48\n00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.710\nreally good, I highly recommend it.\n\n49\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.120\nSent it out, and I went from number\n1131 to number 11 in one day and\n\n50\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.985\ngot back ordered at Amazon for\na full month and a half.\n\n51\n00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:35.472\nThe reason?\n\n52\n00:02:35.472 --> 00:02:38.300\nHe has 1.8 million Twitter followers.\n\n53\n00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.060\nSo the idea here is yes,\n\n54\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.690\nI want to meet anyone I can, anyone of\nquality, integrity, that has great ideas.\n\n55\n00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.080\nI want a great network around me.\n\n56\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.430\nBut I also especially want to focus on the\nhubs, the people that know if I'm really,\n\n57\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.170\nreally good at what I do,\nthen they can tell a lot of people.\n\n58\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.975\nAs long as you have the third element,\nwhich is love,\n\n59\n00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:01.980\nit's knowledge, network, love.\n\n60\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.370\nAnd love says, if you're an honest, kind,\n\n61\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.750\nloving person of integrity,\nyou've got an amazing reputation for\n\n62\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.950\ntelling the truth, a lot of the right\npeople know that about you, hubs.\n\n63\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.420\nAnd they also know that you're really,\n\n64\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.530\nreally good at something that's highly\nvaluable in the marketplace, you have any\n\n65\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.290\njob, in any company, anywhere in the world\nat about any reasonable price you want.\n\n66\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.540\nSo the three questions you have\nto ask yourself everyday are,\n\n67\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.560\nwhat did I learn today, who did I meet\ntoday, and did I live my values today?\n\n68\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.478\nAnd I think if you focus on those\nthree things that builds a really good\n\n69\n00:03:33.478 --> 00:03:34.570\nfoundation.\n\n70\n00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of easy to understand\nthe knowledge and the process for\n\n71\n00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.860\nthat, and the networking as well,\nand planning to do that, and\n\n72\n00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.920\nfiguring out the skills for that.\n\n73\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.820\nBut the love kind of seems\nlike the tricky one.\n\n74\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.490\nSo what are some things that I can do to\nmake sure that people that I meet and\n\n75\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.820\nknow that I am knowledgeable will\ntake tha extra step and refer me?\n\n76\n00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.960\n&gt;&gt; Well it's interesting\nyou used the word refer.\n\n77\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.590\nBecause, people think referrals are for\nyour business, bringing in more customers,\n\n78\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.140\nand they are, but you also want\nreferrals for you as a professional and\n\n79\n00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.550\nthat's not just externally,\nit's internally as well.\n\n80\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.530\nYou want people inside of your company, if\nyou work in large corporation, to refer to\n\n81\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.840\nyou as someone who's excellent to other\ndepartments, their boss, up the chain.\n\n82\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.720\nIf you're working with different\ncompanies you want referrals.\n\n83\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.260\nSo, referrals are actually for\neverybody, and a couple of years ago,\n\n84\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.870\na friend of mine recommended I get\na book specifically on referrals.\n\n85\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.350\nNow I won't give you the title of it, but\nI went to order it at Amazon.com, and\n\n86\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.240\nI buy a lot of books.\n\n87\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.850\nI read over 100 business books a year,\nand I go there, and the book is $68.\n\n88\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.747\nAnd I'm used to paying $10, $12 for\nan e-book or maybe 25 for a normal book,\n\n89\n00:04:43.747 --> 00:04:46.990\n$70 for book, but\nmy friend said it was great.\n\n90\n00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.637\nSo, I hit the one click and ordered and\nit showed up at my house, gets there,\n\n91\n00:04:51.637 --> 00:04:55.138\nit's 26 pages long with big pictures and\nblank pages.\n\n92\n00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:58.530\nI mean the worst thing it have been it\nwould only bad if it been a pop-up book,\n\n93\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.450\nwoulda been the only thing that was worse.\n\n94\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.038\nSo I'm reading through it and\nI see one of the chapter titles says,\n\n95\n00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:06.350\nthe four keys to referability.\n\n96\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.810\nAnd my entire business\ngenerates around referability,\n\n97\n00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.210\ninside of companies and\noutside of companies.\n\n98\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.190\nSo I flipped there real quick, and\n\n99\n00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.760\nthere were four ideas there that I looked\nat them when I first heard them and\n\n100\n00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.620\nsaid, this is the stupidest\nstuff I've ever seen.\n\n101\n00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.000\nThis is just so mundane.\n\n102\n00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.940\nIt doesn't, it's crazy.\n\n103\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.160\nAnd at the time my wife and\nI owned two companies together and\n\n104\n00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.150\nwe were building a custom home.\n\n105\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.200\nAnd I went and read them to her and\nI said, sweetheart, and here they are,\n\n106\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.260\nshow up on time, do what you say\nyou will do, finish what you start,\n\n107\n00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.490\nsay please and thank you.\n\n108\n00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.000\nI added a fifth, which is always give\njust a little bit more than they expect.\n\n109\n00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000\nBut he had four in the book and\nI added the fifth.\n\n110\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.886\nSo I went to my wife, and I went, honey,\n\n111\n00:05:47.886 --> 00:05:51.269\nout of all the people we work with in\nour two companies, all our vendors,\n\n112\n00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:54.399\neverything, and all of the people\nworking on our house right now.\n\n113\n00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:59.377\nCan you name one that consistently\nshows up on time, does everything they\n\n114\n00:05:59.377 --> 00:06:04.436\nsay they will do, finishes everything\nthey start, always says please and\n\n115\n00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:09.033\nthank you, and always give us just\na little bit more than we expect?\n\n116\n00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:11.350\nAnd the answer was no.\n\n117\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.320\nI bet you would have\na hard time doing that.\n\n118\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.010\nI mean, if I know someone that\nmeets those criteria consistently\n\n119\n00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.600\nI become a raving fan for that company.\n\n120\n00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.050\nI tell everybody.\n\n121\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.360\nI want everybody to know I've\ngot a place I eat breakfast.\n\n122\n00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.190\nWhen I'm not traveling I eat breakfast at\nthe same place for the last 15 years, and\n\n123\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.680\nI love it and I tell everybody about it.\n\n124\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.800\nSo the idea here is in your career, if you\ncan consistently do those five things.\n\n125\n00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.810\nShow up on time, do what you say you'll\ndo, finish what you start, say please and\n\n126\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.610\nthank you, and\nalways keep a little bit more than expect,\n\n127\n00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.860\nyou will be building an incredibly strong\nfoundation for taking your career forward.\n\n128\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.799\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I haven't been paying\nthe most attention cuz I've been trying to\n\n129\n00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:53.857\ngo back while you've been talking and\nfigure out so that's $68 for the book,\n\n130\n00:06:53.857 --> 00:06:56.645\nfour ideas, what is that,\n$17 an idea basically?\n\n131\n00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:58.972\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If my math is right, but.\n\n132\n00:06:58.972 --> 00:07:02.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well the gentleman that I got this from\n\n133\n00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.090\ncharges $50,000 a day for\npersonal coaching.\n\n134\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.480\nBecause ideas like that, although they\nlook simple can be life changing.\n\n135\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.670\nI've taught that idea all over the world,\nand all over the world,\n\n136\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.720\npeople say the same thing.\n\n137\n00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.340\nI don't know anyone, or very few people\nknow anyone that meets those criteria.\n\n138\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.260\nWhich means if you went back and said, I'm\ngonna be one of the people that meets all\n\n139\n00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.430\nfive of those criteria, you would\nabsolutely crush the competition.\n\n140\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.110\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n141\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.419\nWell what other points do we have\nhere about career development?\n\n142\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.470\n&gt;&gt; One of the other things, and\nyou were starting to ask about the love,\n\n143\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.630\nthat sounded a little bit\nambiguous to you a little.\n\n144\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.830\nHow do you do that?\n\n145\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.780\nIt's very simple.\n\n146\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:47.140\nI've got a Walt Disney quote I love,\nwhen values are clear, decisions are easy.\n\n147\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.990\nSo the next step is,\n\n148\n00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:54.150\nto matching that knowledge network love\npart, is what are your core values?\n\n149\n00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:59.000\nWhat are the three, four, five, six things\nyou hold very dearly as the way you\n\n150\n00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.300\nwanna live your life, the person you wanna\nbe, the reputation you wanna create,\n\n151\n00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.130\nthe image you wanna portray?\n\n152\n00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.781\nAnd write those down and\n\n153\n00:08:06.781 --> 00:08:10.130\nthen measure everything you do in\nyour life against those values.\n\n154\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.120\nAgain, teaching this for more than 20\nyears, I will challenge people in my\n\n155\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.380\nclasses, how many of you now have\na written list of your core values?\n\n156\n00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.770\nAnd maybe only 5 to 8% of\nthe people will raise their hand.\n\n157\n00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.140\nSo it's very hard to make good decisions\n\n158\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.930\nwhen you don't know what\nyou're basing them on.\n\n159\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.230\nLet me reverse that to make\nit even more powerful.\n\n160\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.350\nYou can make even the most difficult and\nchallenging decisions in your life about\n\n161\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.970\nyour family, your career, whatever it\nmight be, if you have really clear values.\n\n162\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.290\nBecause you just look at the value and\n\n163\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.560\nsay, is what I'm about to do\nright now gonna match that value?\n\n164\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.390\nAnd that's big about the love part with\nintegrity, honesty, and reputation.\n\n165\n00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.620\n&gt;&gt; And that's something that we take\nseriously here at BizProTV, and\n\n166\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.630\nthat's why I love working here and\nthe parent company Edutainment Live.\n\n167\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.450\nWe have our five main values.\n\n168\n00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.260\nAnd whenever we have a tough decision and\nwe're debating back and forth,\n\n169\n00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.870\nwe'll always kind of step back and say,\nwell, how does this relate to our values?\n\n170\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.690\nAnd, for example, the biggest one\nis we exist for our members, for\n\n171\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.740\nthe people out there watching.\n\n172\n00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.430\nAnd so, oftentimes it'll make\nthose five choices you had, well,\n\n173\n00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.450\nit becomes clear that we\nwanna go with this one.\n\n174\n00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.880\nBecause that is what helps us offer\nthe best product to our members,\n\n175\n00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.320\nso having those values identified before\nwe go into these kind of decision making\n\n176\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.810\nthings helps us come up\nwith the best answer.\n\n177\n00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.030\n&gt;&gt; And in business that makes total sense.\n\n178\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.650\nWe've got our mission, our vision,\nour values, our core purpose.\n\n179\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.850\nMost companies would never think of trying\nto go forward in being a successful\n\n180\n00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.930\ncompany without having\nthose things in place.\n\n181\n00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.986\nIt's exact same for your life.\n\n182\n00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:43.176\nWhat are your core value,\nwhat's your mission, what's your purpose,\n\n183\n00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:46.624\nanother thing that I think fits in this\nwell is what's your personal definition\n\n184\n00:09:46.624 --> 00:09:47.712\nof success?\n\n185\n00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.320\nIn a business we measure this pretty\neasily, it's the bottom line,\n\n186\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.010\nit's how big our market share is,\n\n187\n00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.840\nit's how much we give back to\nthe community, we can put a number on it.\n\n188\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.660\nBut sort of like, it's tough to make great\ndecisions if you don't have clear values.\n\n189\n00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.470\nIt's very hard to feel successful\n\n190\n00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.170\nif you've never defined\nwhat success is for you.\n\n191\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.980\nAnd the big idea around this is\neverybody's definition is different.\n\n192\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.650\nIn America, we typically, and\neven if you look up the definition,\n\n193\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.850\nbelieve that success is money,\nfame and power.\n\n194\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.620\nYou've got to be really rich,\nextremely famous and\n\n195\n00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.980\nvery powerful to be\nconsidered highly successful.\n\n196\n00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.080\nI'm fine with all those things,\nif that's really what you value.\n\n197\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.340\nBut my definition of personal success\nis when your self-concept and\n\n198\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.820\ncore values are in harmony\nwith your daily behaviors.\n\n199\n00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.040\nIn other words,\nyou thought deeply about who you wanna be,\n\n200\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.050\nwhat your core values are, what you really\nstand for, any thought about, I got\n\n201\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.150\nup every day of my life with just awesome,\nI was having fun and I enjoyed it.\n\n202\n00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.420\nAnd then you get up everyday and\nyou actually lived that.\n\n203\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.280\nYou might become rich,\nfamous, and powerful.\n\n204\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.860\nNo one in the world might know you.\n\n205\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.390\nIt doesn't matter as long as you can put\nyour head on your pillow at night and\n\n206\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:00.140\ngo, another fantastic day, lived my\nvalues, life is the way I want it to be,\n\n207\n00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.600\nthis is fantastic.\n\n208\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.830\nSo another challenge in this is write down\nyour own personal definition of success.\n\n209\n00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:12.890\nWhat you have to be, think, feel, or have\nin order for you to feel truly successful?\n\n210\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.600\nAnd this is your definition,\nnot anybody else's.\n\n211\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.480\nDon't worry about society,\ndon't worry about your family,\n\n212\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.660\ndon't worry about anything else.\n\n213\n00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.370\nJust sit down and say, for me in my life,\n\n214\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.610\nif I can achieve these things,\nI will feel extremely successful.\n\n215\n00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, John and I see we have\nanother acronym down here, FDA,\n\n216\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.140\nwe had an FDA before.\n\n217\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.850\nIs this the same FDA\nin a previous episode?\n\n218\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.470\n&gt;&gt; Well we've covered two things in\nthe previous episode around doing well for\n\n219\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.900\nthe year, and I wanted to quickly touch\non them again because they are two more\n\n220\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.790\nfundamental thing about career success.\n\n221\n00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.578\nAnd I will just hit them very fast.\n\n222\n00:11:46.578 --> 00:11:50.754\nTo be successful in your life you\nmust have a plan, P-L-A-N, and\n\n223\n00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:53.111\nhere is what that acronym stands for.\n\n224\n00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:56.942\nPrepare for the journey,\nlauch into action, analyse and\n\n225\n00:11:56.942 --> 00:12:00.160\nadjust as you go and\nnetwork with those you know.\n\n226\n00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.691\nYou're gonna see some overlap here because\nthese are fundamental great ideas.\n\n227\n00:12:03.691 --> 00:12:06.640\nYou gotta sit down and think about\nwhat you want and write out a plan.\n\n228\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.930\nYou gotta get up every day and\nwork really hard on it.\n\n229\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.810\nYou gotta constantly adjust as you go,\nbecause things are gonna go wrong,\n\n230\n00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:12.570\nthings will change.\n\n231\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.880\nAnd then you need to surround yourself\nwith great people of high integrity,\n\n232\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.890\nwho are good at what they do,\nthat want to see you succeed.\n\n233\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.790\nThey'd love to see you successful.\n\n234\n00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.580\nAnd then once you've got all these\nother elements I've talked about,\n\n235\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.570\nthe KNL, the five keys to referability,\npersonal values,\n\n236\n00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:35.460\npersonal definition of success, you use\nthe other acronym we talked about, FDA.\n\n237\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.590\nFocus, discipline, action.\n\n238\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.680\nOnce you've got that philosophy,\nyou've gotta be insanely focused,\n\n239\n00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.550\nintently focused on your\npersonal philosophy of success,\n\n240\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.810\nyour definition of success,\nyour core values.\n\n241\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.190\nSo very,\nvery focused on what you wanna do,\n\n242\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.760\nwho you truly wanna be,\nwhere you wanna go.\n\n243\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.470\nThen you have to have enough\ndiscipline to actually do that.\n\n244\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.920\nNot just write it on a piece of paper or\n\n245\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.190\ntell a few friends about it or\nput it in an app on your iPhone, you know.\n\n246\n00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.580\nBut actually live that with discipline.\n\n247\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.910\nAnd then the last thing is the amount of\naction you apply determines the amount of\n\n248\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.700\nresults you get.\n\n249\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.530\nIf you apply a little bit of action\nyou get a tiny bit of results.\n\n250\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.480\nIf you apply massive action with\ndiscipline that's highly focused,\n\n251\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.760\nyou can build an entire,\nan extremely successful life and career.\n\n252\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.670\n&gt;&gt; That PLAN acronym sounds a lot\nlike what our IT audience or\n\n253\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.150\nsoftware developers might understand.\n\n254\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.736\nIt's kind of the Agile and Lean approach\nof get it out there, launch it, and then\n\n255\n00:13:33.736 --> 00:13:38.411\npivot, analyze it and make any changes you\nneed to before you go and network then.\n\n256\n00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:41.494\nBut always be kind of making\nsure you're analyzing so\n\n257\n00:13:41.494 --> 00:13:44.670\nthat you're putting out the best product.\n\n258\n00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of people say, doing\nthis in a company nobody argues with,\n\n259\n00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.940\nof course we have to have a plan in\nAgile and pivot and do all that.\n\n260\n00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.490\nIt's exactly the same in your life, and\n\n261\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.330\nvery few people approach\ntheir own life like that.\n\n262\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.605\nAnd the way I like to say it is,\n\n263\n00:13:57.605 --> 00:14:00.240\nthey're just hoping that\nthings turn out all right.\n\n264\n00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.710\nAnd hope is not a strategy.\n\n265\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen people take the Agile\napproach to planning a wedding,\n\n266\n00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.750\nusing the same run down and burn and\ncharge, and all those kinds of things.\n\n267\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.800\nBut, John I'm looking\nat the notes here and\n\n268\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.990\nit looks like we're wrapped up on this.\n\n269\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.410\nSo any key takeaways for\nthe ideas for career development?\n\n270\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the key thing is that no\none else is gonna do this for you.\n\n271\n00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.720\nPeople will help you, they'll assist you,\nyou can read books, you can watch videos.\n\n272\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.640\nYou can do all this stuff, but if you're\nnot committed to lifelong learning,\n\n273\n00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.390\nconstantly doing the sort of\nthings I'm talking about here.\n\n274\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.100\nYou're not gonna achieve the level of\nsuccess you want by however you define it.\n\n275\n00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.370\nBut at the end of the day it's up to you.\n\n276\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.920\n&gt;&gt; And something you said earlier,\nevery day say,\n\n277\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.960\nwhat did I learn, who did I meet, and-\n&gt;&gt; Did I live my values today?\n\n278\n00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.670\n&gt;&gt; Did I live my values today?\n\n279\n00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.840\nThat's fantastic.\n\n280\n00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.134\nBut looking at the clock and\n\n281\n00:14:49.134 --> 00:14:52.406\nlooking at my coffee looks like we're\nabout out of time for this one.\n\n282\n00:14:52.406 --> 00:14:56.371\nWe're gonna go ahead and close down\nthis episode on career development, but\n\n283\n00:14:56.371 --> 00:15:00.154\nwe've got a lot more professional\ndevelopment content coming your way so\n\n284\n00:15:00.154 --> 00:15:01.630\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n285\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.190\nBut signing off for BizProTV,\nI've been your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n286\n00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:05.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n287\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.377\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n288\n00:15:07.377 --> 00:15:17.377\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

continuing to talk about\n\n3\n00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.205\nprofessional development, and\nspecifically in this episode,\n\n4\n00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.800\nwe're talking about delegating down and\nmanaging up.\n\n5\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.470\nAnd here to help us,\nwe have an expert, John Spence.\n\n6\n00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.210\nJohn, how you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.550\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great today, Peter, you?\n\n8\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.490\n&gt;&gt; I am fantastic, thank you.\n\n9\n00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.917\nI'm a big believer in delegation and\nmaking sure that you have a team that for\n\n10\n00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:31.664\na lot of people, it's threatening\nto have a really great team.\n\n11\n00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.854\nBut I love to hire people that are smarter\nthan me and really rely on them for\n\n12\n00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:37.590\nsome great things,\nthat's what I've done with my team here.\n\n13\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.140\nBut what are you talking about\nwhen we say, delegating down?\n\n14\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, and\nit's delegating down or across.\n\n15\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.512\nIt's hard to delegate to your peers a lot,\nthat's more of a negotiation,\n\n16\n00:00:47.512 --> 00:00:49.160\nas we talked about earlier.\n\n17\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.920\nBut what I'm looking at here is, and it's\na very simple idea, with the speed and\n\n18\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.330\npace of business today,\nyou can't do it alone.\n\n19\n00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330\nNobody can, things move too fast.\n\n20\n00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.410\nThere's too many moving parts, too much\nstuff happening in the marketplace, and\n\n21\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.550\nyou've got to have people\non your team to help you.\n\n22\n00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.920\nAnd of course, and\n\n23\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.110\nyou said something interesting that\nI'll bring up a little research on it.\n\n24\n00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.900\nThere was a large research\nproject a couple years ago.\n\n25\n00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.100\nThey looked at about 8,000,\nquote unquote, leaders, senior managers.\n\n26\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.850\nAnd they said,\nwhat kind of a follower do you wanna have?\n\n27\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.830\nDo you wanna have someone\nthat's a yes man or woman?\n\n28\n00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.630\nWho, whatever you say, sure,\nI gotta handle whatever you say.\n\n29\n00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.177\nOr the fence sitter, who sort of waits and\nsees and makes sure it's a good idea.\n\n30\n00:01:31.177 --> 00:01:34.570\nAnd as soon as everybody else is on board,\nit's going good, they jump on board.\n\n31\n00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.825\n&gt;&gt; See which way the wind's blowing.\n\n32\n00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:38.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\nsee which way the wind's blowing.\n\n33\n00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.940\nAnd then you've got the people\nwho are the challengers.\n\n34\n00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.990\nWho are constantly challenging your ideas,\n\n35\n00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.730\ntrying to make them better, asking why,\nbringing up other data, other information.\n\n36\n00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.610\nAnd they ask these folks, who would\nyou like to have as your followers?\n\n37\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.650\nAnd what do you think\nthe number one answer was?\n\n38\n00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.190\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know what I think it should be,\n\n39\n00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.076\nbut I'm guessing most\npeople said the yes men.\n\n40\n00:01:58.076 --> 00:01:59.181\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n41\n00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:04.930\n82% of the people said I'd prefer to\nhave yes men or women on my team.\n\n42\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.946\nOnly about 5% wanted the challengers,\n\n43\n00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:10.880\nwhich is the exact opposite of the way\nit should be, as you pointed out.\n\n44\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.742\nI want people on my team that are smart,\nfast, bright, and smarter than me, which,\n\n45\n00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:16.796\nfor you and I,\nis not too high of a challenge.\n\n46\n00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:17.787\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n47\n00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:22.960\nwhen you do have to delegate to those\nfolks, you've gotta look at it this way.\n\n48\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.422\nYou're juggling a lot\nof balls as a manager.\n\n49\n00:02:24.422 --> 00:02:28.320\nYou gotta figure out which ones\nare rubber and which ones are crystal.\n\n50\n00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.280\nThe rubber balls, you can drop and\nlet other people pick up.\n\n51\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.330\nIf you drop one of the glass or\ncrystal balls, it's in serious trouble.\n\n52\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.840\nSo part of it is backing up and\nsaying, what can I say no to?\n\n53\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.220\nWhat can I trust other people\nto do as well or better than me?\n\n54\n00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.240\nNot just exactly the way I would do it,\nbut that the outcome would be there, and\n\n55\n00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.210\nthen learn to delegate to them.\n\n56\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.740\nI learned this when I\nwas a very young CEO.\n\n57\n00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.660\nWhen I first got in,\nI thought this is great,\n\n58\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.610\nI have the corner office, got glass walls,\nand I get to make all the decisions.\n\n59\n00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.010\nEverything had to come across my table.\n\n60\n00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.870\nUntil I looked up one day and\nrealized my entire staff was standing\n\n61\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.250\ndown the hallway waiting for\nme to make decisions.\n\n62\n00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.070\nI was the bottleneck in the company.\n\n63\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.530\nAll of the work was being held up because\nI was trying to oversee all of it.\n\n64\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.980\nAnd I was afraid,\nas you mentioned, to delegate.\n\n65\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.600\nSo I brought my whole staff together,\nand I said,\n\n66\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.840\nfrom now on,\nthere's four levels of delegation.\n\n67\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.690\nLevel one, it's your decision to the staff\nperson, this is what I hired you for.\n\n68\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.960\nYou're better at it then me, you've\ngot more experience, more knowledge.\n\n69\n00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.933\nYou just make this decision totally on\nyour own, and then you own the outcome.\n\n70\n00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:32.358\nLevel one, your decision,\nyou own the outcome.\n\n71\n00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:36.000\nLevel two, you probably need to\nget some feedback on this, but\n\n72\n00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.640\nit doesn't have to be from me.\n\n73\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.900\nIt might be from the CFO, or the head of\nmarketing, or our membership director,\n\n74\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.760\nwhatever it might be,\nor the IT department.\n\n75\n00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.650\nGo get some feedback, some advice.\n\n76\n00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.080\nThen you make the decision and you own it.\n\n77\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.960\nAnd after you've asked for\nadvice a couple of times,\n\n78\n00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.160\nit should switch to a level one decision.\n\n79\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.730\nLevel one, you make it, you own it.\n\n80\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.860\nLevel two, get some advice, input,\nyou make the decision, you own it.\n\n81\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.140\nLevel three, it's a team decision.\n\n82\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.433\nWe're gonna pull everybody together and,\nor\n\n83\n00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.736\nthe appropriate people\ntogether on the team.\n\n84\n00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:09.341\nAnd we're gonna talk about this,\ndiscuss it, and as a team, together,\n\n85\n00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:11.270\nwe're gonna decide on the direction.\n\n86\n00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.457\nAnd even if I, as the manager or\nleader, do not agree with you,\n\n87\n00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:21.073\nif the entire team says go this way, and\nI say I think we should go that way,\n\n88\n00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:24.975\nI'm going to make the decision\nthe way the team wants to do it.\n\n89\n00:04:24.975 --> 00:04:28.470\nAnd the team will not own it,\nI will own it.\n\n90\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.230\nSo level three says team decision and\nthen whatever the team decides,\n\n91\n00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.480\nI as the leader make the decision\nthat way, go along with it.\n\n92\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.150\nAnd I represent that decision\nas if it were my own.\n\n93\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.360\nThat's level three, level four is\nit's my decision as the leader.\n\n94\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.630\nI'm gonna do what I think I need to do, I\nmight ask for your feedback, I might not.\n\n95\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.170\nI might have more information,\na higher view.\n\n96\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.020\nI might know something you don't know.\n\n97\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.180\nBut I'm gonna make this decision,\nI own it.\n\n98\n00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.740\nBut I need you to follow it.\n\n99\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.880\nWhich is why the level three of\nI'm gonna follow your decision,\n\n100\n00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.780\nI'll take responsibility for\nit, allows you to\n\n101\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.620\nhave this level four decision where\nyou're saying, I make the decision.\n\n102\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.930\nI need you to trust me and follow me.\n\n103\n00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.340\nHere's what I found out.\n\n104\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.810\nAbout 70%, 80% of the decisions I\nwas making were one, two, or three.\n\n105\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.490\nProbably 60% of them were level one.\n\n106\n00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.680\nSo, after that then, when someone\nwould come to my office and say, John,\n\n107\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.170\nI really need help, I'd go mm-mm,\nlevel one, level one.\n\n108\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.750\nGo back, make the decision.\n\n109\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.320\nOr they come in, John, I really,\nI go, no, no, level two.\n\n110\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.940\nGo talk to Peter, or go talk to Tim,\nor go talk to Robin.\n\n111\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.340\nI don't have the information on that.\n\n112\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.510\nGo talk to them, they'll make\nthe decision with you, then you own it.\n\n113\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.750\nRarely did we do a level three team, but\nwhen we did, I did do what the team wanted\n\n114\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.120\nto do, and I took full responsibility and\naccountability for the outcome.\n\n115\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.340\nAnd very, very, very rarely did I\nmake a level four decision, but\n\n116\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.110\nwhen I did,\nmy entire team got right behind me.\n\n117\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.980\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like a culture thing as well\nthat you've gotta kind of instill that\n\n118\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.990\nculture at the beginning within your\nteam and also within the company.\n\n119\n00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.113\nI'm thinking back to that 82%, that the\nreason those people are probably feeling\n\n120\n00:05:58.113 --> 00:06:01.605\nthe way they are is because they're\nworried if my boss sees that I've got\n\n121\n00:06:01.605 --> 00:06:04.255\nthis genius working under me\nthat has this great idea.\n\n122\n00:06:04.255 --> 00:06:09.240\nThat maybe they'll give them my job, so\nhaving that culture where delegation and\n\n123\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.830\nempowering your employees to really\nmake those decisions on their own.\n\n124\n00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.540\nThat's a great thing in a company culture,\nI think.\n\n125\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's essential to running a great\nbusiness that can be agile and quick and\n\n126\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.700\nadaptable in a market place.\n\n127\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.540\nWhere decisions are made correctly and\nquickly, and that people feel like they\n\n128\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.780\nhave a say in the outcome,\nthat gives them a stake in the outcome.\n\n129\n00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.280\nAnd all those things are great.\n\n130\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.200\nThere's the other side of it though,\n\n131\n00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.260\nis when you delegate to someone who\ndoesn't deliver what they promised, who is\n\n132\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.830\nconsistently not meeting the standards and\nnot doing the work they need to do.\n\n133\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.930\nAnd when you've got someone like this, and\nit depends on the size of the company,\n\n134\n00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.910\nin large organizations, multinational\ncompanies, you've got an HR department,\n\n135\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.050\na very strict way to handle this.\n\n136\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.770\nBut there's a tool I teach\nthat you can use there first.\n\n137\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.504\nOr if you've got a small\nto medium sized company,\n\n138\n00:06:56.504 --> 00:07:01.620\nyou're a team within an organization,\na way to deal with employees\n\n139\n00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.310\nwho aren't delivering what they need to\ndo, who aren't meeting the standards.\n\n140\n00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.392\nAnd as I have four or five of everything,\n\n141\n00:07:07.392 --> 00:07:09.675\nthis one is called\nthe Four Pieces of Paper.\n\n142\n00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:12.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here's the scenario.\n\n143\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.100\nYou've got an employee who you hired,\nbeen there for a while.\n\n144\n00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.670\nMaybe they've only been\nthere a short time.\n\n145\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.980\nYou really had a high level of\nconfidence they were gonna be great.\n\n146\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.770\nYou believe in them, but\nthey are not getting their work done.\n\n147\n00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.830\nThey're just not delivering the quality,\nor it's not on time.\n\n148\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.670\nBut they're not meeting\nthe requirements of the job.\n\n149\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.960\nHere's what I would do.\n\n150\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:36.270\nI call him in my office and say,\nI hired you, Dave, I think you're great.\n\n151\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.300\nYou've been working hard, but\n\n152\n00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.970\nright now, I hear from your manager\nthat you're not up to speed.\n\n153\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.310\nYou're not doing what you need to do.\n\n154\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.850\nAnd if we can't fix this, you will no\nlonger be working for the company.\n\n155\n00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.460\nBut that's not what I wanna have happen,\nI want you to stay.\n\n156\n00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.840\nSo what we're gonna do is,\nI've got four pieces of paper here.\n\n157\n00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.690\nI'd like you to take piece of paper number\none, and write out clearly, as measurable,\n\n158\n00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.670\nspecific, binary, one, zero,\nno guessing, no ambiguity.\n\n159\n00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.930\nAs clearly as possible what you're\ngonna do in the next 90 days\n\n160\n00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.130\nto prove that you should stay on the team.\n\n161\n00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.030\nWhat are you gonna deliver?\n\n162\n00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.730\nHow will you act?\n\n163\n00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.920\nHow will you behave?\n\n164\n00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.390\nWhat will your work product look like?\n\n165\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.640\nIn as much detail as possible, tell me\nwhat you'll deliver over the next 90 days\n\n166\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.830\nto show everyone here you should stay\non the team and stay in the company.\n\n167\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.520\nAnd it changes, the speed might change.\n\n168\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.660\nIn your company, it might be a month,\nit might be six months,\n\n169\n00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.080\nit all depends on the pace.\n\n170\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.330\nMost of the companies I've owned or\n\n171\n00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.070\nrun, 90 days was plenty,\nthat's piece of paper number one.\n\n172\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.120\nThey sit there, they write it all out,\nthey look at it, then you discuss it.\n\n173\n00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.340\nYou negotiate it, you talk about it, and\nwhen you both get to a position when you\n\n174\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.630\nfeel this is really good,\nif you did this in the next 90 days,\n\n175\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.380\nit would be really great,\nbe impressive, you both sign it.\n\n176\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.020\nIt's not a contract, it's a promise\nbetween two professionals that say,\n\n177\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.690\nyou're going to accomplish\nthis in the next 90 days, and\n\n178\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.500\nwe're both in full agreement on it,\npiece of paper number one.\n\n179\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.630\nPiece of paper number two is what do\nyou need from me as your manager or\n\n180\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.370\nleader to make that happen?\n\n181\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.270\nWhat doors do I have to kick down?\n\n182\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.500\nWhat walls do I have to jump over?\n\n183\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.090\nWhat resources, training, help, support?\n\n184\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.400\nWhat is everything I have to do to set you\nup for success, to accomplish everything\n\n185\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.404\nyou've just promised to do on\npiece of paper number one?\n\n186\n00:09:11.404 --> 00:09:14.730\nAnd again, we negotiate, I need\na helicopter to go to work every morning.\n\n187\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.581\nNo, we're not doing that.\n\n188\n00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:17.642\n[LAUGH] But as long as it's reasonable and\n\n189\n00:09:17.642 --> 00:09:21.228\nyou might have to renegotiate some\nstuff on piece of paper number one.\n\n190\n00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:24.534\nBut you get both of them there and\nthen again, you sign it together,\n\n191\n00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:27.122\njust a promise between two professionals.\n\n192\n00:09:27.122 --> 00:09:29.570\nI'm gonna give you everything\non this piece of paper.\n\n193\n00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.140\nPiece of paper number three is if I\nachieve everything on piece of paper one,\n\n194\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.190\nI nail it, I deliver it all.\n\n195\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.200\nWhat is a small reward you'd like\nin addition to keeping your job,\n\n196\n00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.030\nwhich is pretty cool, but something small?\n\n197\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.510\nDinner out with your significant other,\na flex day, a new parking spot,\n\n198\n00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.360\nnew plastic plant for your office, [LAUGH]\nsomething really valuable like that.\n\n199\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.920\nBut what can I give you in addition\nto saying congratulations,\n\n200\n00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.070\nyou've done a wonderful job,\nyou're back on the team.\n\n201\n00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.730\nAnd that piece of paper number four is,\nif I give you\n\n202\n00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.610\neverything on piece of paper number two\nand you do not deliver everything you\n\n203\n00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.470\npromised on piece of paper number one,\nwhat should the ramifications be?\n\n204\n00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.330\nAnd almost everyone puts either I'll\nquit or I should be terminated.\n\n205\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.650\nSo there's the four pieces of paper,\nyou're signed,\n\n206\n00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.150\nwe've both got a copy of it.\n\n207\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.010\nAnd it's pretty simple.\n\n208\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.600\nYou meet every Monday or Wednesday or\nFriday for 20 minutes in the morning, and\n\n209\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.255\nyou go over the four pieces of paper.\n\n210\n00:10:17.255 --> 00:10:18.720\nHow're you doing on piece\nof paper number one?\n\n211\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.510\nGot almost all of it done.\n\n212\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.640\nDo you need anything else from\nme on piece of paper number two?\n\n213\n00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.401\nHere's what typically happens.\n\n214\n00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:27.422\nAt about 70 days or so,\nabout two weeks left,\n\n215\n00:10:27.422 --> 00:10:31.510\nthey come in your office, and\nyou got one or two scenarios.\n\n216\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.880\nOne, they've got about 95,\n99% of the stuff done, they've nailed it.\n\n217\n00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.070\nAnd you just look at them and\ngo, you're amazing.\n\n218\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.570\nWe're all so proud of you,\nyour performance right now is perfect.\n\n219\n00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.900\nWe're incredibly happy.\n\n220\n00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.010\nI'm gonna rip these things up.\n\n221\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.660\nI'm gonna give you the thing I promised\non piece of paper number three.\n\n222\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.610\nWe're gonna forget this ever happened.\n\n223\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.540\nJust continue to perform\nthe way you're performing, and\n\n224\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.880\neverything will be perfect.\n\n225\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.720\nThat's 15% of the time or less.\n\n226\n00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.290\nMost of the time, they come in,\nand you say well, Mary,\n\n227\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.780\nwe got about two weeks left,\nabout ten days.\n\n228\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.795\nAnd you've only accomplished about 11%\nof the stuff you promised you'd do.\n\n229\n00:11:06.795 --> 00:11:11.209\nDo you really believe you're gonna\nbe able to get that last 85,\n\n230\n00:11:11.209 --> 00:11:13.990\n90% in the next 14 days?\n\n231\n00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:18.860\nAnd, in my career, I've only had\nto fire a handful of people, but\n\n232\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.930\nI've had a bunch of people self-terminate.\n\n233\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.470\nAt that point, say, no, I'm not doing it.\n\n234\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.700\nI promised it, you gave me everything.\n\n235\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.660\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ngive you my two weeks.\n\n236\n00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.750\nEvery now and then,\nI've had to terminate somebody.\n\n237\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.720\nBut here's the key point here is,\nthey never say, this isn't fair.\n\n238\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.490\nSay no, you wrote it.\n\n239\n00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.960\nI didn't understand what\nI was supposed to do.\n\n240\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.770\nNo, you wrote the list.\n\n241\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:37.990\nYou didn't give me what you said.\n\n242\n00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.760\nNo, here it is, I signed everything,\nI gave you four more things.\n\n243\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.850\nSo instead of them saying, you set unfair\ngoals, you didn't give me enough time,\n\n244\n00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.120\nyou didn't help me.\n\n245\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.970\nYou can say, no, this was you, you set\nthe goals, you set the measurements,\n\n246\n00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.250\nyou set the timeline, we agreed on it.\n\n247\n00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.090\nI gave you everything you asked for, and\n\n248\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.160\nyou did not meet the standards\nthat you agreed you would.\n\n249\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.610\nI'm afraid that you're not\ngonna be working here anymore.\n\n250\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.760\nLove, John.\n\n251\n00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, papers three and four kind of\nsound like the carrot and the stick there.\n\n252\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.430\nAnd you're really holding\nthe employee accountable.\n\n253\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.240\nPaper number two, you're saying, okay,\nhere's the things as the manager that I\n\n254\n00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.990\nneed to do or that you need to do,\nlet's say, you're my manager in this case.\n\n255\n00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.270\nAnd that kinda sounds like to me maybe\na good segue to the second half of this,\n\n256\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.180\nwhich is managing up.\n\n257\n00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.570\nBecause you need to hold that\nperson accountable as well,\n\n258\n00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.950\nis that kind of a fair statement?\n\n259\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.654\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, let me make one\nlast point on the first thing is,\n\n260\n00:12:28.654 --> 00:12:31.980\nis you don't always have to\nhave number three and four.\n\n261\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.750\nSo you could just use this as meeting\nwith some people on your team and saying,\n\n262\n00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.200\nall right, what are you gonna\naccomplish in the next 90 days?\n\n263\n00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.330\nWhat do you need from me to get it?\n\n264\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.310\nJust a great management tool.\n\n265\n00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.840\n&gt;&gt; Number three, in a lot of cases,\nthe reward is, you get to keep your job.\n\n266\n00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.930\n&gt;&gt; And you get your salary, right?\n\n268\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.660\nThat's kind of like a commission\nin a sales department.\n\n269\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.870\nThat seems to be what it is a lot.\n\n270\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.400\nWell, number three is,\nyeah, we keep you employed.\n\n271\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that happens a lot.\n\n272\n00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.840\nSo, now let's talk about the other\nsituation, which is when you need to do\n\n273\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.800\nsomething like this with your boss,\nyour manager, what I call managing up.\n\n274\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.670\nSo, you've got a problem, an issue,\npotentially dysfunctional boss,\n\n275\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.932\nand it's impacting your\nability to do your work.\n\n276\n00:13:08.932 --> 00:13:11.354\nAnd if you sit there,\nyou're gonna go crazy.\n\n277\n00:13:11.354 --> 00:13:16.430\nSo there's a continuum on this from the\nleast aggressive to the most aggressive.\n\n278\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:21.240\nSo at the least aggressive is if you've\ngot an issue, a problem with your boss,\n\n279\n00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.730\nyour manager, and you really feel\nlike you gotta handle it, change it.\n\n280\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.480\nLevel one, or\nthe first part of the continuum,\n\n281\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.690\nis, if you have a good relationship with\nhim, go and just have a chat with him.\n\n282\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:36.070\nTake them to lunch, sit down, go in their\noffice, close the door, and using the I\n\n283\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.540\nstatements and the other things we've\ntalked about in conflict resolution is\n\n284\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.780\nhave a professional, unemotional,\nclear discussion about the issues\n\n285\n00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.610\nyou see and how you feel you might be\nable to work through them together.\n\n286\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.700\nThat's if you have a great relationship.\n\n287\n00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.560\nIf you don't have a great relationship,\nlevel two then is\n\n288\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.140\nmaybe get a couple of other people\nthat are in your department or\n\n289\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.740\nyour group that also feel that\nsame pressure, that same stress.\n\n290\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.760\nAnd say, hey, can the three or four of\nus go talk to our manager together?\n\n291\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.250\nSo, it's a small group of you going,\n\n292\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.250\nand try to pick people that they trust,\nthey respect, they like.\n\n293\n00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.160\nSo it isn't just you complaining,\nbut it's three or\n\n294\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.790\nfour of their top employees\nexpressing a concern.\n\n295\n00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.370\nThe next level would be, go to someone\nelse at your boss' peer level or\n\n296\n00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.620\nabove them, who you have a relationship\nwith, maybe a mentor or coach.\n\n297\n00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.270\nAnd say, hey,\nI'm having some problems around this area.\n\n298\n00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.160\nAnd A,\nI'd like your advice on how to handle it,\n\n299\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.250\nB, would you be willing to go talk to\nDave Bobsu, whoever it might be, and have\n\n300\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.350\na discussion with him about how they might\nbe impacting their employees in this area.\n\n301\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:47.120\nSo go by yourself, go with a few trusted\nother people, go over their head, and\n\n302\n00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.650\nask for advice and help in mentoring, not\ngetting a change, not asking for a change.\n\n303\n00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.830\nAt this level, if there's still no change,\nthe next one is, overwhelm them with data.\n\n304\n00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.410\nBring them a survey,\nstart sending some articles to them.\n\n305\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.650\nGive them information and ideas,\nand the way I typically do this is,\n\n306\n00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.750\nI will send three or four articles\nthat I know the person will like.\n\n307\n00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.840\nIt's on a topic they like, a subject they\nlike, something they're excited about in\n\n308\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.550\nleadership, or motivation, whatever,\nand start a discussion around it.\n\n309\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.080\nSo the first few times, it's safe, and\nit's something they wanna discuss and\n\n310\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.470\nthey're excited about.\n\n311\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.460\nThen you drop the bomb [LAUGH] on them\non the fifth or sixth one, and send them\n\n312\n00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.790\nan article about their dysfunctional\nbehavior, or managing up, or doing change.\n\n313\n00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.830\nAnd that way, you've opened it up for\ndiscussion there.\n\n314\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.340\nIf that doesn't work, now we're getting\nmore and more aggressive, then you go with\n\n315\n00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:38.060\na big group of people to the boss, or\nyou get a letter and all of you sign it.\n\n316\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.082\nI had to do this once in one\nof the companies I worked at.\n\n317\n00:15:41.082 --> 00:15:44.480\nAnd 26 of us, I wrote a letter and\n26 of us signed it and\n\n318\n00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.490\nsent it to the board of\ndirectors of the company.\n\n319\n00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.790\nIt was a smaller organization.\n\n320\n00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.370\nAnd the board intervened to try to help.\n\n321\n00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:55.550\nWhen that didn't work, you get to\nthe highest level, which is, you quit.\n\n322\n00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.780\nAnd if you really wanna be aggressive,\nyou send a letter to the board or\n\n323\n00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.360\nto the CEO on the way out,\nsaying this is why I left, and\n\n324\n00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.450\nI hope that this gets fixed for\nthe other people in the organization.\n\n325\n00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.450\nSo you go from very simple,\nnice conversation, all the way up to,\n\n326\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.380\nI quit, and take a parting\nshot on your way out the door.\n\n327\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.282\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz John, it sounds like the\nchances of getting your manager to self\n\n328\n00:16:16.282 --> 00:16:19.960\nterminate, and even though you might wish\nfor that, that's probably pretty slim.\n\n329\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.902\nBut I think we're about out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n330\n00:16:23.902 --> 00:16:26.390\nI wanna point out, though,\nyou mentioned a few things there.\n\n331\n00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.070\nYou mentioned negotiation,\nyou mentioned conflict resolution,\n\n332\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.280\nall things we've talked\nabout in other episodes.\n\n333\n00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.547\nSo I think it's important to\ntake the time and go back and\n\n334\n00:16:33.547 --> 00:16:37.133\nsee because all these things kind of, I'm\nstarting to see they're interconnecting.\n\n335\n00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:39.168\nAnd that would be a really\ngood thing to go back and\n\n336\n00:16:39.168 --> 00:16:40.666\nmake sure you get all these pieces.\n\n337\n00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.612\nAnd that will help you in\nthe delegating down and managing up and\n\n338\n00:16:43.612 --> 00:16:46.180\nall the other professional\ndevelopment skills here.\n\n339\n00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.930\nBut looks like we're out of time for\nthis episode, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n340\n00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:50.930\nwrap things up.\n\n341\n00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.470\nSo signing off for BizProTV,\nI've been your host, Peter VanRysdam.\n\n342\n00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm John Spence.\n\n343\n00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.756\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see\n\n344\n00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:04.348\nyou next time.\n\n345\n00:17:04.348 --> 00:17:06.488\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
