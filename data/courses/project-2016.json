          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.518\nHello, thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:15.367\nI'm here to introduce you to the CompTIA\nproject plus exam for PK 004.\n\n3\n00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:20.300\nWhat we hope to do is tell you a little\nbit more about the exam details.\n\n4\n00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.280\nTo talk about the exam objectives,\na little bit, and\n\n5\n00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.380\nto show you what we'll be\ncovering in our show, as well.\n\n6\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.460\nSo, let's go ahead and, get started.\n\n7\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.970\nIf you want to learn more details about\nthe exam, the easiest place to go,\n\n8\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.130\nof course, is to the CompTIA website.\n\n9\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.140\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n10\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.293\nIf you go ahead and\ntype in your favorite browser,\n\n11\n00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:42.652\nthis particular link right here\ncertification.comptia.org that\n\n12\n00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:46.651\nautomatically brings you pretty\nmuch to this page right here.\n\n13\n00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:50.815\nAnd you'll see as you hover over it,\nit's very sensitive you'll click on\n\n14\n00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:55.773\ncertification and then, once you actually\nselect certifications, you can scroll down\n\n15\n00:00:55.773 --> 00:01:00.180\nand see all of the different CompTIA\ncertifications that there are.\n\n16\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.730\nWe, though, we're gonna be\nfocusing in on CompTIA Project+.\n\n17\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.636\nSo I'm simply gonna\nclick on the link there.\n\n18\n00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:09.140\nAnd it's gonna say,\nClick For More Details.\n\n19\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.380\nAs I do so, that will help me\nto focus in on CompTIA Project+.\n\n20\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.330\nAnd this exam code, it says PK0-003.\n\n21\n00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.033\nYou're probably wondering, hey that's\nkind of a little bit tricky there.\n\n22\n00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:24.650\nAnd the reason why is that both exams\nare actually still valid right now.\n\n23\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.020\nNow as I scroll through here,\nI'm gonna scroll down.\n\n24\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.360\nAnd even though there's an overview and\n\n25\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.800\nit talks about what this is to help\nyou measure the skills for, and\n\n26\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.810\nwhy you would choose to sit for this exam,\nwe're gonna look at the exam details.\n\n27\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.270\nBecause you've already chosen to sit for\nthis exam, and\n\n28\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.240\nyou're now in preparation mode.\n\n29\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.258\nAnd you'll notice, it actually that it\ndoes have both exam details going on.\n\n30\n00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:52.330\nSo, the PK0-003 is still valid, but\nas of this particular date that you see,\n\n31\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330\nthe PK0-004, is also available as well.\n\n32\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.660\nSo we're gonna focus in on this\nleft-hand column just at the beginning.\n\n33\n00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.860\nNow, when you start taking a look,\nthere, of course,\n\n34\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.860\nis the exam description, telling you\nthat the focus of the exam has changed\n\n35\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.170\na little bit since the earlier\nedition of the exam.\n\n36\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.340\nAnd then as we scroll down through here,\n\n37\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.560\nnotice that this is what we want to focus\nin on for some of the exam details.\n\n38\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.000\nYou are gonna see a maximum, okay, and\n\n39\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.960\nthe key here is the word,\nmaximum, of 95 questions.\n\n40\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.267\nSo that does mean that you may\nactually get less than 95.\n\n41\n00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:30.760\nYou shouldn't ever get\nmore than 95 questions.\n\n42\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.620\nBut, just saying that, right?\n\n43\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.030\nBefore you take the exam,\n\n44\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.500\nmake sure you always come back\nto the web page and verify it.\n\n45\n00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.510\nThis number can change and CompTIA does\nstress that, that they can change these\n\n46\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.500\nnumbers or these details at\nany time that they choose to.\n\n47\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.180\nSo as of the recording of this\nentire show that we're about to see,\n\n48\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.850\nthat is what you're gonna see here, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.290\nSo it's gonna be about 95 questions or\nsomewhere around there.\n\n50\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.261\nNotice that they include\nof course multiple choice,\n\n51\n00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.890\nas well as multiple response questions.\n\n52\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.670\nDrag and drops, so that means you have\nto place things in specific order, or\n\n53\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.570\nin an arrangement that they choose.\n\n54\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.107\nAnd the passing score is a 710\nbased on a scale of 1 to 900.\n\n55\n00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:16.314\nThe recommended experience is at\nleast a year of cumulative project\n\n56\n00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:19.880\nmanagement experience or\nthe equivalent education.\n\n57\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.330\nNow that doesn't mean that you've had\nto have managed an entire project\n\n58\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.780\nby yourself, but at least have had\nthat project management experience.\n\n59\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.080\nCurrently in US dollars the exam\npricing is about $294 but\n\n60\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.430\nmake sure you do take\na look at this link and\n\n61\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.420\ncheck out the area that you're in\nwherever you are in the world and\n\n62\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.450\nthat will help you out as well to make\nsure you get the proper pricing tube.\n\n63\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.424\nYou are also going to be testing normally\nthrough a Pearson VUE testing center, so\n\n64\n00:03:48.424 --> 00:03:51.245\nwherever you're local\ncenter is going to be.\n\n65\n00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:55.647\nMake sure you do know where that is and\nthat you arrive there about 15 minutes\n\n66\n00:03:55.647 --> 00:03:58.219\nearly, before you get\ninto the exam itself so\n\n67\n00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.320\nthat they can get all the processing\ndone that they need to.\n\n68\n00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.860\nNow, what about details on the exam and\nwhere can I find that so\n\n69\n00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.270\nthat I can study a bit more effectively.\n\n70\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.430\nWell, the great thing is,\nit's right here on the website as well.\n\n71\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.750\nAs I scroll down over on\nthe right-hand side, notice\n\n72\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.640\nright here it says you can get these\nsample questions and exam objectives.\n\n73\n00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.010\nAnd you simply of course fill out\nthe information that you want and\n\n74\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.890\nif you want sample questions\nit'll show you some.\n\n75\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.600\nIf you don't, just simply uncheck that and\n\n76\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.520\nthen of course tell them your training\nstatus and when plan on taking it and\n\n77\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.410\nwhether or not you want to be\ninformed of special promotions.\n\n78\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.550\nNow it doesn't sound like anything big,\nbut\n\n79\n00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.650\nyou may get discount vouchers if you\nsee this sometimes so it does happen.\n\n80\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.760\nI went ahead and downloaded the latest\nobjectives that we have, so\n\n81\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.530\nif I click on this tab, you'll see here is\nwhat the objectives normally look like.\n\n82\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.600\nSo they'll come to you in a the form\nof a PDF that you can print off, but\n\n83\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.240\nhere's the latest exam objectives and\n\n84\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.720\nalways go to the website itself to verify\nthat you do have the latest edition.\n\n85\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.410\nAs we scroll on through here, it will kind\nof go through some of the same things that\n\n86\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.150\nwe've just talked about but a little\nbit more detail on the exam itself.\n\n87\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.180\nSo, notice they give you\nall the information.\n\n88\n00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.210\nThe same thing that we've\njust talked about here.\n\n89\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.868\nThe key for you, again, is to make sure\nyou pay attention to that exam number.\n\n90\n00:05:16.868 --> 00:05:21.650\nPK0-004 is pretty much the key here.\n\n91\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.720\nNow, what are we going to\nactually see on the exam?\n\n92\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.860\nWell right here, you gonna see that it's\nactually divided into four different areas\n\n93\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.860\nand their not equally weighted.\n\n94\n00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.415\nThe first part the project basics itself\ntakes up nearly 40% of the the exam.\n\n95\n00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:42.495\nSo make sure you do focus heavily\non those project basics, and\n\n96\n00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:46.165\nunderstand those fundamentals that\nyou need to in project management.\n\n97\n00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:48.675\nThe same thing with the project\nconstraints in which\n\n98\n00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:51.385\nyou'll need to go over those\ndetails on how do you actually\n\n99\n00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:54.620\nput in the limits that you\nwant on your project as well.\n\n100\n00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.260\nAnd then of course, how do you manage\nchange and the communication process?\n\n101\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.190\nAnother quarter of the exam.\n\n102\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.580\nAnd finally, some of the project tools and\ndocumentations.\n\n103\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.240\nNow for the show that we are about\nto continue and produce for\n\n104\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.070\nyou right here at ITProTV, we will be\ngoing over every single one of these\n\n105\n00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.170\nexam objectives that you see right here to\nensure that you do get maximum coverage.\n\n106\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.120\nNow, viewing the videos by themselves\nis not gonna be sufficient.\n\n107\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.270\nYou'll have to put in some homework time.\n\n108\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.830\nMake sure that you go ahead and\n\n109\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.100\nyou try and put them into a scenario\nthat you'll understand and know and\n\n110\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.370\nmake sure you wrestle with these\nconcepts a little bit more.\n\n111\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.260\nSo you'll see on the very\nbasics here they'll cover\n\n112\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.380\nkind of the same things here,\nproject roles, responsibilities.\n\n113\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.050\nSome of the different standard project\nphases in which you'll go through, and\n\n114\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.800\nof course even some of the cost control,\norganizational structures, and scheduling.\n\n115\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.270\nAs well as, they've added in, of course,\nAgile methodology in here for us.\n\n116\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.640\nAnd as you continue to go on through,\nyou'll see more and more of that.\n\n117\n00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.210\nGoing through the project constraints,\nwe'll actually slow down and\n\n118\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.160\ntake some good detailed looks at some\nof these different project constraints.\n\n119\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.000\nAnd this is where we're giving\nsomething else here too,\n\n120\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.770\nwhich is this phrase right here,\ngiven a scenario.\n\n121\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.740\nSo do not think that\nthe multiple choice questions\n\n122\n00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.930\nare always just gonna be\nabout you picking just one.\n\n123\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.180\nYou have to actually take a look at\nthe scenario, understand the context\n\n124\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.830\nto be able to answer completely and\nwholly what needs to be done.\n\n125\n00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.910\nDon't read into the questions too much,\nbut make sure\n\n126\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.800\nwhen you answer the question, you answer\nfully the entire question itself.\n\n127\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.040\nSame thing with the Communication and\nChange Management,\n\n128\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.790\nin which will go over strategy.\n\n129\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.573\nAs well as, of course, the details that\nwe need in terms of communication, and\n\n130\n00:07:39.573 --> 00:07:43.355\nfinally you actually end up seeing, as I\nscroll down here into the project tools\n\n131\n00:07:43.355 --> 00:07:47.549\nand documentations, we'll take a look at\nthese different tools and documentations.\n\n132\n00:07:47.549 --> 00:07:51.915\nAnd we'll talk about them, make sure you\nhave a good understanding of that as well,\n\n133\n00:07:51.915 --> 00:07:55.090\nas we continue throughout\nthis particular show.\n\n134\n00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.820\nSo if you are getting prepared and you\nare saying, hey, I need some details and\n\n135\n00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.451\nI need to learn more about getting for\nthe Project+ exam itself,\n\n136\n00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:08.130\nwell ITProTV will have\nthe show right here for you.\n\n137\n00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.444\nSo if you're ready get started,\n\n138\n00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:14.500\ncheck this out in the very next\nvideo following this show.\n\n139\n00:08:14.500 -->
