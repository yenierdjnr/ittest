          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.518\nHello, thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:15.367\nI'm here to introduce you to the CompTIA\nproject plus exam for PK 004.\n\n3\n00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:20.300\nWhat we hope to do is tell you a little\nbit more about the exam details.\n\n4\n00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.280\nTo talk about the exam objectives,\na little bit, and\n\n5\n00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.380\nto show you what we'll be\ncovering in our show, as well.\n\n6\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.460\nSo, let's go ahead and, get started.\n\n7\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.970\nIf you want to learn more details about\nthe exam, the easiest place to go,\n\n8\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.130\nof course, is to the CompTIA website.\n\n9\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.140\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n10\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.293\nIf you go ahead and\ntype in your favorite browser,\n\n11\n00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:42.652\nthis particular link right here\ncertification.comptia.org that\n\n12\n00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:46.651\nautomatically brings you pretty\nmuch to this page right here.\n\n13\n00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:50.815\nAnd you'll see as you hover over it,\nit's very sensitive you'll click on\n\n14\n00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:55.773\ncertification and then, once you actually\nselect certifications, you can scroll down\n\n15\n00:00:55.773 --> 00:01:00.180\nand see all of the different CompTIA\ncertifications that there are.\n\n16\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.730\nWe, though, we're gonna be\nfocusing in on CompTIA Project+.\n\n17\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.636\nSo I'm simply gonna\nclick on the link there.\n\n18\n00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:09.140\nAnd it's gonna say,\nClick For More Details.\n\n19\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.380\nAs I do so, that will help me\nto focus in on CompTIA Project+.\n\n20\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.330\nAnd this exam code, it says PK0-003.\n\n21\n00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.033\nYou're probably wondering, hey that's\nkind of a little bit tricky there.\n\n22\n00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:24.650\nAnd the reason why is that both exams\nare actually still valid right now.\n\n23\n00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.020\nNow as I scroll through here,\nI'm gonna scroll down.\n\n24\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.360\nAnd even though there's an overview and\n\n25\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.800\nit talks about what this is to help\nyou measure the skills for, and\n\n26\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.810\nwhy you would choose to sit for this exam,\nwe're gonna look at the exam details.\n\n27\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.270\nBecause you've already chosen to sit for\nthis exam, and\n\n28\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.240\nyou're now in preparation mode.\n\n29\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.258\nAnd you'll notice, it actually that it\ndoes have both exam details going on.\n\n30\n00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:52.330\nSo, the PK0-003 is still valid, but\nas of this particular date that you see,\n\n31\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.330\nthe PK0-004, is also available as well.\n\n32\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.660\nSo we're gonna focus in on this\nleft-hand column just at the beginning.\n\n33\n00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.860\nNow, when you start taking a look,\nthere, of course,\n\n34\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.860\nis the exam description, telling you\nthat the focus of the exam has changed\n\n35\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.170\na little bit since the earlier\nedition of the exam.\n\n36\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.340\nAnd then as we scroll down through here,\n\n37\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.560\nnotice that this is what we want to focus\nin on for some of the exam details.\n\n38\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.000\nYou are gonna see a maximum, okay, and\n\n39\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.960\nthe key here is the word,\nmaximum, of 95 questions.\n\n40\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.267\nSo that does mean that you may\nactually get less than 95.\n\n41\n00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:30.760\nYou shouldn't ever get\nmore than 95 questions.\n\n42\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.620\nBut, just saying that, right?\n\n43\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.030\nBefore you take the exam,\n\n44\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.500\nmake sure you always come back\nto the web page and verify it.\n\n45\n00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.510\nThis number can change and CompTIA does\nstress that, that they can change these\n\n46\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.500\nnumbers or these details at\nany time that they choose to.\n\n47\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.180\nSo as of the recording of this\nentire show that we're about to see,\n\n48\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.850\nthat is what you're gonna see here, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.290\nSo it's gonna be about 95 questions or\nsomewhere around there.\n\n50\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.261\nNotice that they include\nof course multiple choice,\n\n51\n00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.890\nas well as multiple response questions.\n\n52\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.670\nDrag and drops, so that means you have\nto place things in specific order, or\n\n53\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.570\nin an arrangement that they choose.\n\n54\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.107\nAnd the passing score is a 710\nbased on a scale of 1 to 900.\n\n55\n00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:16.314\nThe recommended experience is at\nleast a year of cumulative project\n\n56\n00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:19.880\nmanagement experience or\nthe equivalent education.\n\n57\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.330\nNow that doesn't mean that you've had\nto have managed an entire project\n\n58\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.780\nby yourself, but at least have had\nthat project management experience.\n\n59\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.080\nCurrently in US dollars the exam\npricing is about $294 but\n\n60\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.430\nmake sure you do take\na look at this link and\n\n61\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.420\ncheck out the area that you're in\nwherever you are in the world and\n\n62\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.450\nthat will help you out as well to make\nsure you get the proper pricing tube.\n\n63\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.424\nYou are also going to be testing normally\nthrough a Pearson VUE testing center, so\n\n64\n00:03:48.424 --> 00:03:51.245\nwherever you're local\ncenter is going to be.\n\n65\n00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:55.647\nMake sure you do know where that is and\nthat you arrive there about 15 minutes\n\n66\n00:03:55.647 --> 00:03:58.219\nearly, before you get\ninto the exam itself so\n\n67\n00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.320\nthat they can get all the processing\ndone that they need to.\n\n68\n00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.860\nNow, what about details on the exam and\nwhere can I find that so\n\n69\n00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.270\nthat I can study a bit more effectively.\n\n70\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.430\nWell, the great thing is,\nit's right here on the website as well.\n\n71\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.750\nAs I scroll down over on\nthe right-hand side, notice\n\n72\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.640\nright here it says you can get these\nsample questions and exam objectives.\n\n73\n00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.010\nAnd you simply of course fill out\nthe information that you want and\n\n74\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.890\nif you want sample questions\nit'll show you some.\n\n75\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.600\nIf you don't, just simply uncheck that and\n\n76\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.520\nthen of course tell them your training\nstatus and when plan on taking it and\n\n77\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.410\nwhether or not you want to be\ninformed of special promotions.\n\n78\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.550\nNow it doesn't sound like anything big,\nbut\n\n79\n00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.650\nyou may get discount vouchers if you\nsee this sometimes so it does happen.\n\n80\n00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.760\nI went ahead and downloaded the latest\nobjectives that we have, so\n\n81\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.530\nif I click on this tab, you'll see here is\nwhat the objectives normally look like.\n\n82\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.600\nSo they'll come to you in a the form\nof a PDF that you can print off, but\n\n83\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.240\nhere's the latest exam objectives and\n\n84\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.720\nalways go to the website itself to verify\nthat you do have the latest edition.\n\n85\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.410\nAs we scroll on through here, it will kind\nof go through some of the same things that\n\n86\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.150\nwe've just talked about but a little\nbit more detail on the exam itself.\n\n87\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.180\nSo, notice they give you\nall the information.\n\n88\n00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.210\nThe same thing that we've\njust talked about here.\n\n89\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.868\nThe key for you, again, is to make sure\nyou pay attention to that exam number.\n\n90\n00:05:16.868 --> 00:05:21.650\nPK0-004 is pretty much the key here.\n\n91\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.720\nNow, what are we going to\nactually see on the exam?\n\n92\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.860\nWell right here, you gonna see that it's\nactually divided into four different areas\n\n93\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.860\nand their not equally weighted.\n\n94\n00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.415\nThe first part the project basics itself\ntakes up nearly 40% of the the exam.\n\n95\n00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:42.495\nSo make sure you do focus heavily\non those project basics, and\n\n96\n00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:46.165\nunderstand those fundamentals that\nyou need to in project management.\n\n97\n00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:48.675\nThe same thing with the project\nconstraints in which\n\n98\n00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:51.385\nyou'll need to go over those\ndetails on how do you actually\n\n99\n00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:54.620\nput in the limits that you\nwant on your project as well.\n\n100\n00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.260\nAnd then of course, how do you manage\nchange and the communication process?\n\n101\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.190\nAnother quarter of the exam.\n\n102\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.580\nAnd finally, some of the project tools and\ndocumentations.\n\n103\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.240\nNow for the show that we are about\nto continue and produce for\n\n104\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.070\nyou right here at ITProTV, we will be\ngoing over every single one of these\n\n105\n00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.170\nexam objectives that you see right here to\nensure that you do get maximum coverage.\n\n106\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.120\nNow, viewing the videos by themselves\nis not gonna be sufficient.\n\n107\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.270\nYou'll have to put in some homework time.\n\n108\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.830\nMake sure that you go ahead and\n\n109\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.100\nyou try and put them into a scenario\nthat you'll understand and know and\n\n110\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.370\nmake sure you wrestle with these\nconcepts a little bit more.\n\n111\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.260\nSo you'll see on the very\nbasics here they'll cover\n\n112\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.380\nkind of the same things here,\nproject roles, responsibilities.\n\n113\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.050\nSome of the different standard project\nphases in which you'll go through, and\n\n114\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.800\nof course even some of the cost control,\norganizational structures, and scheduling.\n\n115\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.270\nAs well as, they've added in, of course,\nAgile methodology in here for us.\n\n116\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.640\nAnd as you continue to go on through,\nyou'll see more and more of that.\n\n117\n00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.210\nGoing through the project constraints,\nwe'll actually slow down and\n\n118\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.160\ntake some good detailed looks at some\nof these different project constraints.\n\n119\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.000\nAnd this is where we're giving\nsomething else here too,\n\n120\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.770\nwhich is this phrase right here,\ngiven a scenario.\n\n121\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.740\nSo do not think that\nthe multiple choice questions\n\n122\n00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.930\nare always just gonna be\nabout you picking just one.\n\n123\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.180\nYou have to actually take a look at\nthe scenario, understand the context\n\n124\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.830\nto be able to answer completely and\nwholly what needs to be done.\n\n125\n00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.910\nDon't read into the questions too much,\nbut make sure\n\n126\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.800\nwhen you answer the question, you answer\nfully the entire question itself.\n\n127\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.040\nSame thing with the Communication and\nChange Management,\n\n128\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.790\nin which will go over strategy.\n\n129\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.573\nAs well as, of course, the details that\nwe need in terms of communication, and\n\n130\n00:07:39.573 --> 00:07:43.355\nfinally you actually end up seeing, as I\nscroll down here into the project tools\n\n131\n00:07:43.355 --> 00:07:47.549\nand documentations, we'll take a look at\nthese different tools and documentations.\n\n132\n00:07:47.549 --> 00:07:51.915\nAnd we'll talk about them, make sure you\nhave a good understanding of that as well,\n\n133\n00:07:51.915 --> 00:07:55.090\nas we continue throughout\nthis particular show.\n\n134\n00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.820\nSo if you are getting prepared and you\nare saying, hey, I need some details and\n\n135\n00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.451\nI need to learn more about getting for\nthe Project+ exam itself,\n\n136\n00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:08.130\nwell ITProTV will have\nthe show right here for you.\n\n137\n00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.444\nSo if you're ready get started,\n\n138\n00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:14.500\ncheck this out in the very next\nvideo following this show.\n\n139\n00:08:14.500 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.184\nWelcome, if you're searching for\nall things CompTIA Project+,\n\n2\n00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:07.860\nyou're in the right place.\n\n3\n00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.116\nIn this particular short segment,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n4\n00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:16.288\ncover the differences\nbetween the PK0-003 exam, and\n\n5\n00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:21.220\nwe'll look at the new updated\nobjectives for the PK0-004 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.562\nWith us, to help go into detail,\nwe have Sir Ronnie Wong, thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:26.120\nbeing with us today, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.760\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.650\nhaving me back as we take a look at\njust some basic comparisons here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.810\nNow if you've been studying for the\nprevious edition of the exam, you probably\n\n11\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.890\nfound it a little bit overwhelming\nin terms of the amount of material.\n\n12\n00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.130\nAnd that was because they were really\npreparing you to become what they thought\n\n13\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.050\nwas a good senior manager on a project\nthat you would end up managing.\n\n14\n00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.124\nSo they kind of put themselves in\na comparison with the idea of actually you\n\n15\n00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:54.030\nactually becoming\na senior project manager.\n\n16\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.130\nSo that was the focus and\nthe scope of everything that they did.\n\n17\n00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.980\nAnd so you went over a lot of details in\nterms of the way that the planning went\n\n18\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.240\nout, and all the actual incredible amounts\nof formulas that you had to learn, and\n\n19\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.190\ndetails in terms of WBS,\nand so many other things.\n\n20\n00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.110\nWell, with the newer exam objectives,\nthough,\n\n21\n00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.520\nthey've changed the scope of this\nbecause they realized that there was\n\n22\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.600\nalready another certification that\nreally held that place very well.\n\n23\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.690\nWhich, of course, is the PMP exam instead.\n\n24\n00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.130\nSo what they did is they said, look, let's\nfocus in instead on the idea here of being\n\n25\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.350\nmore of an assistant to a project\nmanager that might be working.\n\n26\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.900\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about,\nand\n\n27\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.160\nhere's where they've changed\nthe focus on the exam.\n\n28\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.860\nSo on my computer,\nI've actually listed three different\n\n29\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.200\nareas in which you'll see here,\nor different roles, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.670\nOne as a junior project manager, and\n\n31\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.470\nyou can see where they might\nactually be in charge of a project.\n\n32\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.530\nBut this time,\nsmall to medium size projects here,\n\n33\n00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.050\nwhere they actually end up managing\na lot of different things.\n\n34\n00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.940\nBut overall though,\n\n35\n00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.850\nthey will still end up reporting\nto a senior project manager, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.560\nWith previous experience, you also see\nthe idea of that project coordinator,\n\n37\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.820\nokay, who actually does help out with\nthe project management itself, but\n\n38\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.293\nmanages to coordinate\nall of the resources and\n\n39\n00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.570\nensures that everything happens\nwhen it actually needs to happen.\n\n40\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.220\nAnd then, of course, the scheduler here,\n\n41\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.390\ntoo, who really does manage\nthe overall schedule.\n\n42\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.100\nAnd to understand those ideas and\nthose concepts of project management\n\n43\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.340\nare really helpful,\neven at the most basic levels.\n\n44\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.280\nSo that is where it comes down\nto the big differences between\n\n45\n00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.560\nthe previous iteration on the exam,\nthe 003, and\n\n46\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.080\nalso the 004 as the focus and the audience\nthat they're trying to address.\n\n47\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.660\nSo what you'll see as a big difference\nhere in terms of the content is that even\n\n48\n00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.770\nthough in the 004 we cover kind\nof the most basic formulas, a lot\n\n49\n00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.280\nof the advanced and more complex formulas\nare essentially not going to be covered,\n\n50\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.240\nbecause they know that you're probably\nheading on to a more advanced type of\n\n51\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.500\nproject management certification.\n\n52\n00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.470\nSo that's where you do see\nthe differences there.\n\n53\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.385\nAlso, you tend to see where you're gonna\ntake a look at the idea of planning, and\n\n54\n00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:09.155\nit really does seem like that we don't\ngo into the execution and controlling,\n\n55\n00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:12.556\nand even the closing phase of\nthe project management and\n\n56\n00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:17.434\nthe learning phase of project management,\ntoo much inside of the PK-004.\n\n57\n00:03:17.434 --> 00:03:21.330\nSo, let's talk about the differences\nthen in terms of the exam.\n\n58\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.900\nOkay, so\nwe take a look at my screen one more time.\n\n59\n00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.280\nWe'll see the actual comparison\ndifferences in the domain objectives.\n\n60\n00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.040\nAnd you'll notice right away that what\nthey've done is they have reduced this\n\n61\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.275\nto actually taking away at least one of\nthe actual objective domains here, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:39.690\nWhereas before there were five,\nnow they've focused it in on\n\n63\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.440\npretty much just really project basics,\nwhere they've actually taken the idea of\n\n64\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.430\neach individual process group, or\nthe idea of phases instead, and\n\n65\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.340\nnow they've turned them into just\nsaying overall project basics.\n\n66\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.131\nUnderstanding the idea of just\nregular project constraints, and\n\n67\n00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:01.810\nthen communication and change management,\nas well as documentation and tools.\n\n68\n00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.612\nYou won't notice that over here on\nthe earlier iteration, every single one of\n\n69\n00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:10.688\nthose phases really had their own\nparticular domain objectives,\n\n70\n00:04:10.688 --> 00:04:14.530\nwhich meant that you covered\nthem in much more detail.\n\n71\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.130\nAnd that is because they wanted you\nto understand those process groups\n\n72\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.570\nincredibly well, which is great,\nbecause that's something that we needed.\n\n73\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.510\nBut they realized that they were\npretty much competing against PNP,\n\n74\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.880\nwhich was not what they\nreally wanted to do.\n\n75\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.260\nSo instead, they've kind of\nhit a more basic market here.\n\n76\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.350\nAnd saying hey, if you've been\ninvolved in project management,\n\n77\n00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.520\nrecommended idea of at least 12 months of\nexperience in assisting in projects, or\n\n78\n00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.030\nbeing a part of a project, and needing\nto understand project management because\n\n79\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.090\nyou're gonna be a junior project manager,\nor the scheduler,\n\n80\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.750\nor a coordinator, here's\nthe information that you really need.\n\n81\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.500\nSo essentially, when it comes down to it,\nthey made the exam a lot more focused for\n\n82\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.610\nthose guys,\n\n83\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.040\ninstead of just trying to throw\neverything underneath the sun at you.\n\n84\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.020\nWhich was a lot more hefty in terms\nof the depth of the material, and\n\n85\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.730\nthe volume of the material, and\n\n86\n00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.240\nnow it's actually more streamlined and\nfocused towards who they wanted to.\n\n87\n00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.085\nSo if you are one of those people,\nin which you are seeking out this idea,\n\n88\n00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:15.950\nof saying, hey I am gonna be a project\nmanager, I am gonna be a project schedule,\n\n89\n00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.410\nor a coordinator here, this is gonna be\nthe show that you want to watch as we\n\n90\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.160\ncontinue on to go through every single\nexam objective right here in this show.\n\n91\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.729\nSo stay tuned for\nthe great content to come.\n\n92\n00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.242\n[MUSIC]\n\n93\n00:05:35.242 --> 00:05:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Ronnie defines Projects as a temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service or result whereas programs refers to an ongoing effort that is repetitive and follows existing procedures. They also discuss  what a project as part of a portfolio is and how it can be beneficial. Whether it be categorizing a landscaping service to developing a java program for a website make sure you feel comfortable understanding and identifying  the differences of a project versus program.",

You're watching IT Pro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.840\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at IT Pro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.370\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose and\nwe'll be looking at Project Plus.\n\n6\n00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.780\nSpecifically, we're gonna be\nlooking at our Project properties.\n\n7\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.480\nAnd we have Mr. Ronnie Wong to\ngo ahead and help us with that.\n\n8\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.850\nThank you for coming, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.790\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue on to see\n\n10\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.580\nsome of the elements that we need to\nunderstand if we're gonna be involved in\n\n11\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.850\nproject management of any sort.\n\n12\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.115\nNow here when we start talking\nabout the project plus,\n\n13\n00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:44.020\nnow remember that we're really taking\nthe initial steps to get entry and\n\n14\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.640\nto get an understanding, a foundational\nunderstanding of project management.\n\n15\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.960\nBut that means we have to start\nat the very beginning as well.\n\n16\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.180\nAnd sometimes it's hard to kinda\njust jump into the topic when\n\n17\n00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.580\nyou might be just told,\nhey you'd be a good project manager.\n\n18\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.830\n&gt;&gt; So exactly what is a project Ronnie?\n\n20\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.450\nAnd then how do we actually begin with,\nwhat's the purpose of creating a project?\n\n21\n00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.930\n&gt;&gt; Well now we start taking a look here\nat the idea of what a project really is.\n\n22\n00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.540\nAnd that's something that we want\nto make sure that we focus in on.\n\n23\n00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.920\nWhat does this do?\n\n24\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.030\nWhat does a project do that regular\nwork does not do for us and\n\n25\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.690\nthat's where we really begin.\n\n26\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.450\nThe total focus of our project is that\nit is a temporary endeavor first and\n\n27\n00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.400\nforemost.\n\n28\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.570\nAnd that means that there is gonna be\na very solid beginning to this project,\n\n29\n00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.510\nand that there's gonna be of course\nan established end to the project as well.\n\n30\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.350\nNow, not only do we have that as far\nas the time limit goes, but it has some\n\n31\n00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.970\ntype of goal that happens in which we take\nwhatever it is, tools and techniques and\n\n32\n00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.630\nwhatever we do, to make sure that\nwe end up creating something, okay.\n\n33\n00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.960\nSomething that is unique, and\n\n34\n00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.080\nthat something that's unique can either be\na product, it can be some type of service,\n\n35\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.190\nor it can be some type of result that\nwe're hoping to achieve In the end.\n\n36\n00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.270\nIt's not normally just one thing, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.510\nSo when we start to take a look them\nat this idea of why do we need it?\n\n38\n00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.110\nWell, we actually need projects to exist,\n\n39\n00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.950\nbecause well there are several factors\nhere that we have to think about.\n\n40\n00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.180\nOne is fairly easy.\n\n41\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.930\nWhatever it is that we think that we need,\n\n42\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.530\nwe prime might have actually done a search\nfor it and we realized something.\n\n43\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.538\nIt doesn't yet\nexist at any particular time.\n\n44\n00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:29.870\nSo what we're doing here is we are filling\nthe gap in which we tried to look for\n\n45\n00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.560\nand all of a sudden we realized, it's\nnot within the environment that we can\n\n46\n00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.940\nactually find right now or we don't see\nit actually existing somewhere else.\n\n47\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.720\nSo at this particular point you\nmight have tried to purchase it, and\n\n48\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.110\nyou realized you can't purchase it.\n\n49\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.360\nYou might have tried to find something\nthat's actually out there, and\n\n50\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.540\nit couldn't be found.\n\n51\n00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.760\nOr it may be something that's so\n\n52\n00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.750\nunique it just hasn't been thought about\nyet in the context that you're doing.\n\n53\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.220\nDon't get me wrong,\nyou actually understand that there's\n\n54\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.860\ntons of stuff out there and\nmore than likely what you need does exist.\n\n55\n00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.650\nYou're just not able to find\nit at that particular point.\n\n56\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.130\nSo at that point you may find that out, is\nthat hey, I need a project to help me to\n\n57\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.990\ncreate this unique value of\nwhatever it is that I'm producing.\n\n58\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.550\n&gt;&gt; So would that be something\nthat you might do in house or\n\n59\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.130\nis that typically outsourced?\n\n60\n00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.890\n&gt;&gt; Well it just depends on what\nyou need to create, right?\n\n61\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.590\nSo depending on your product,\n\n62\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.600\nyou might find some different things or\nwhatever result that you want.\n\n63\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.030\nSo let's take a look at\nmy screen here just for\n\n64\n00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.110\na moment to help us to make sure that\nwe have at least the basic facts\n\n65\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.010\nconcrete in our head before\nwe move on here, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.870\nSo remember that it's\na temporary endeavor,\n\n67\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.980\nundertaken to create a unique product,\nservice, or result.\n\n68\n00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.750\nLet me give you some examples here, so\n\n69\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.170\nthat we understand what we\nmight be talking about.\n\n70\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.050\nAs far as a product goes,\nlet's talk about the idea of men's razors.\n\n71\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.203\nNow I'm pretty sure Cherokee, I'm not\ngonna say that you use a men's razor, but\n\n72\n00:03:47.203 --> 00:03:49.305\nwhat I'm gonna say is this,\nright, the very fact is,\n\n73\n00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:51.428\nmen's razors have been around for\na long time, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:51.428 --> 00:03:55.132\nAnd you might be looking at it,\nand going, why is that a product?\n\n75\n00:03:55.132 --> 00:03:59.860\nThat's not anything that's\nreally unique into itself, so\n\n76\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.740\nwhy would you have this\nlisted as a project here?\n\n77\n00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.680\nWell, in this instance is the way that\nwe've chosen to advance the idea of\n\n78\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.860\nrazor blade technology, right?\n\n79\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.220\nSo when I grew up,\nthere was really only the Bic razor.\n\n80\n00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.040\nIt had one blade on it and\nhad a yellow handle,\n\n81\n00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.250\nthat was a disposable razor at that point.\n\n82\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.860\nSo I came along in that era where\ndisposable razors were just really getting\n\n83\n00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.880\npopular.\n\n84\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.333\nBut before that it was just\nthose razors that you bought and\n\n85\n00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:29.401\nyou kind of had this metal handle and\neverything, and then you did that.\n\n86\n00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:33.746\nBut overall though,\nas the technology advanced,\n\n87\n00:04:33.746 --> 00:04:39.312\nnow today you have five razors that\nhave lubricant on it and gels.\n\n88\n00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:41.495\n&gt;&gt; And made it vibrate to get\ncloser to [LAUGH] the skin.\n\n89\n00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:43.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you name it.\n\n90\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.710\nAll the idea there is it took\na project for somebody to say,\n\n91\n00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.320\nlook, I want a closer shave, and\nso these companies did what?\n\n92\n00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.990\nThey formed a project to go, all right,\nhow do we get a better razor?\n\n93\n00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.209\n&gt;&gt; A razor is already a razor,\n\n94\n00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:59.336\nwhich is the sharpest thing that I\nknow that I would have in my house, so\n\n95\n00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:02.580\nhow do you actually get something\nsharper that gives you a closer blade.\n\n96\n00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.540\nWell it took a project\nbefore they realize.\n\n97\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.099\nWhat if I start adding two razors?\n\n98\n00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.600\n&gt;&gt; Now Ron,\nyou keep using this term project.\n\n99\n00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.690\nBut how would a project\nreally differ from a program?\n\n100\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n101\n00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.450\nWhen it comes down to the nature\nof a program, a program and\n\n102\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.600\na project really do kind of go hand and\nhand.\n\n103\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.400\nBut a lot of times here\nwhat happens is that,\n\n104\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.740\nwhatever project that you're working on,\neventually ends up in a program.\n\n105\n00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.360\nA program is ongoing work.\n\n106\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.430\nSomething that has procedures that we tend\nto follow on a day-by-day basis here.\n\n107\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.843\nAnd after a while,\nthat project essentially is the result and\n\n108\n00:05:36.843 --> 00:05:40.976\nthen whatever's carried on in which we\ntend to make money off of at the end or\n\n109\n00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:42.832\nwe tend to use on the daily basis.\n\n110\n00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:46.010\nThat is what actually begins\nto become a program, as well,\n\n111\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.053\nwhen you start looking at something.\n\n112\n00:05:48.053 --> 00:05:51.504\nSo, the idea here is we take\nthat razor blade as an example,\n\n113\n00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:56.337\nthe idea of producing that razor, okay,\nwhether it's five blades vibrating with\n\n114\n00:05:56.337 --> 00:06:00.640\nthe lubricating gel that heats up made\nof a magnum core whatever it may be.\n\n115\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n116\n00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.050\nSuper fancy.\n\n117\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super fancy razor.\n\n118\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.270\nWell, the Production behind that,\nthe program behind that now\n\n119\n00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.840\nis manufacturing,\nis the ability to market that and\n\n120\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.070\ncontinue to market that as being\nthe best razor on the market.\n\n121\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.710\nYou name it, that's what we have as\nfar as projects and products going\n\n122\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.800\nhand in hand when you start to see\nthe difference here to do that, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.530\n&gt;&gt; So, as far as some reasons to actually\nto start a project, maybe I do have this\n\n124\n00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.490\nproduct or service and I see that there\nis a need to go ahead and improve.\n\n125\n00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.895\nWould that be a good reason to go\nahead and begin and start a project?.\n\n126\n00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:42.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, projects normally start just base\noff of anything like what we were saying\n\n127\n00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:44.625\nhere really at the beginning, right?\n\n128\n00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:47.455\nIt might be something that you go,\nI can improve on that, okay.\n\n129\n00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:49.735\nIt might be something you\njust haven't seen before, so\n\n130\n00:06:49.735 --> 00:06:51.305\nthat's another one that you have.\n\n131\n00:06:51.305 --> 00:06:54.125\nYou might also end up recognizing that,\n\n132\n00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:57.430\nhey the solutions that are out\nthere just are not good enough.\n\n133\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.280\nSo you might find yourself with multiple\nreasons to actually go ahead and\n\n134\n00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.220\ndo something like this as well.\n\n135\n00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.910\nNow when we start mentioning\nthat idea of projects and\n\n136\n00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.340\nmaking sure that we understand,\nthe key that makes that project itself,\n\n137\n00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.380\nwhatever it is, whether it's a product,\nor a result, or a service, or\n\n138\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.520\nwhatever it is here, is actually\ngoing to be well, limited by three,\n\n139\n00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.580\nwhat we call constraints in\nterms of project management.\n\n140\n00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.994\nAnd that is limited resources,\nlimited time, as well as limited costs,\n\n141\n00:07:23.994 --> 00:07:27.534\nin other words, you don't have unlimited\ncosts to do whatever you want to.\n\n142\n00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:29.648\nYou have a budget that you have to set.\n\n143\n00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:34.220\nThere's a time period for\nyou to develop whatever this is.\n\n144\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.280\nIt was the brand new razor\nblades they told you, hey,\n\n145\n00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.510\nI wanna get this out to market before\nmy competitor comes ahead of me.\n\n146\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.780\nAnd so what's my time limit gonna be?\n\n147\n00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.140\nThis could be the next four months, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.130\nSo it might be something like that.\n\n149\n00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.370\nAnd then of course resources.\n\n150\n00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.993\nWell, how many people are you gonna allow\nme to make sure that I work on something\n\n151\n00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.099\nlike this as well?\n\n152\n00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:56.481\nSo products are usually the first\nthing that we think about but\n\n153\n00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:59.865\nremember that it can actually\nextend to the idea of services as\n\n154\n00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:02.223\nwell as results that we\ntend to see as well.\n\n155\n00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:06.591\nSo let me go back and talk about this idea\nof services and results just briefly,\n\n156\n00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:07.840\ntoo, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.574\nWith something like a service,\nyou can actually take a look at, well,\n\n158\n00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.030\njust take ITProTV itself.\n\n159\n00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.465\nIt's not that we believe that\nwe were just the best people or,\n\n160\n00:08:16.465 --> 00:08:17.996\neven though we are, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:19.167\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Of course.\n\n162\n00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:20.652\n&gt;&gt; But it's not that, okay,\n\n163\n00:08:20.652 --> 00:08:24.915\nthe idea here is that we believe that we\ncould offer a unique service in the field\n\n164\n00:08:24.915 --> 00:08:27.972\nof IT training,\nespecially certification training.\n\n165\n00:08:27.972 --> 00:08:32.101\nAnd so we came up with a project that\nsaid we're gonna start ITProTV, and\n\n166\n00:08:32.101 --> 00:08:35.700\nthat's pretty much what it\nactually ended up doing.\n\n167\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.650\nSo in that sense, we're competing in\nthe marketplace, but we actually said\n\n168\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.950\nwe can do it differently, we can do it a\nlittle bit better, so we chose to do that.\n\n169\n00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.835\nThe other thing, of course, is the idea\nof a result that can happen as well.\n\n170\n00:08:47.835 --> 00:08:52.568\nITProTV recently underwent a move\nhere where we're now moved\n\n171\n00:08:52.568 --> 00:08:57.129\ninto a larger facility so\nthat we can produce more content.\n\n172\n00:08:57.129 --> 00:09:01.501\nAnd the end result of that move was to\nactually have more studios that went up,\n\n173\n00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:04.060\nso that we can produce more content.\n\n174\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.084\nAnd at the end of the day,\nthat's what ultimately is the goal,\n\n175\n00:09:07.084 --> 00:09:10.565\nis that that result is that even though\nwe were doing fine in two studios,\n\n176\n00:09:10.565 --> 00:09:13.441\nwe actually wanted to go ahead and say-\n&gt;&gt; Improve, evolve.\n\n177\n00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:17.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and to grow to actually\ndo more and more content.\n\n178\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.521\nSo it took a project for someone to say\nhey, we need to move from two to fiv.\n\n179\n00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:24.862\nAnd then,\nhere's what we need in every studio and\n\n180\n00:09:24.862 --> 00:09:27.030\nhere's how all that comes together.\n\n181\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.030\nAnd so there was a project management team\nthat actually ended up taking that on.\n\n182\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.530\nAnd so when you start taking\na look at all these together,\n\n183\n00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.060\nthat's where all of a sudden you start\nseeing the idea of a project that has\n\n184\n00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.500\nvery tangible results, such as\na product behind you or even a service.\n\n185\n00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.640\nOr maybe something a little bit\nmore intangible, such as results.\n\n186\n00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.660\nIn the very end, you hope,\nbecause you don't know until you try it,\n\n187\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.360\nis that you'll actually end up\ngetting the result that you want to.\n\n188\n00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.130\nSo just realize that overall, though, when\nyou start to talk about the fundamentals\n\n189\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.190\nhere and the basic understanding\nof the properties of a project,\n\n190\n00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.200\nthere's a lot more to it than just saying,\nit's something that we do.\n\n191\n00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.171\nIt actually does have a little\nbit more involved into that.\n\n192\n00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:11.330\nAnd usually it's, again,\nconstrained by that idea of time, cost,\n\n193\n00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.500\nas well as the requirements or\nthe scope of the entire project, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.340\nAll right, so as we continue to take\na look at this particular aspect of it,\n\n195\n00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.271\nwe've also talked about\nthe idea of a program.\n\n196\n00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:26.517\nAnd what makes this different is, well,\n\n197\n00:10:26.517 --> 00:10:31.040\nwhat we have here is that projects can\nexist in several different formats.\n\n198\n00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.910\nBy itself, it can be a project that\nexists and something brand new starts.\n\n199\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.160\nITProTV is essentially\na good example of that.\n\n200\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.660\nIt didn't exist before, it started, and\n\n201\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:46.210\nnow we exist as the outcome of that\nparticular project of where ITProTV began.\n\n202\n00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.311\nI now work here as one of the actual\nshow hosts right here on ITProTV.\n\n203\n00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:50.985\n&gt;&gt; You get paid for this?\n\n204\n00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:52.765\n&gt;&gt; And I do get paid for\nit, believe it or not.\n\n205\n00:10:52.765 --> 00:10:54.433\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of strange too,\n\n206\n00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:55.670\nyes I understand.\n\n207\n00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.050\nBut overall though,\nwhen we start doing that,\n\n208\n00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.725\nnow I'm actually in that program\nworking for ITProTV to do so.\n\n209\n00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:06.060\nSo we start to see where\nthis is a changeover and\n\n210\n00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.040\nthis is what starts to happen.\n\n211\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.690\nSo a lot of projects end up as a program\n\n212\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:15.090\nafter everything is done that\nstarted the initial result of this.\n\n213\n00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.730\nNow the other thing, of course then,\n\n214\n00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.390\nis a project can end up in a portfolio for\nother people as well.\n\n215\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.180\nSo a great example of that\nis actually the ITProTV\n\n216\n00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.890\nstudios that's going on right here, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.510\nNow, what do I mean by that?\n\n218\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.440\nWell, when we actually decided\nthat this is the studios,\n\n219\n00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.740\nthat we were gonna go on our brand new\nstudios, perfectly fine that we did so.\n\n220\n00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.010\nBut we actually hired\na team that actually said,\n\n221\n00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.830\nall right, here's what needs to be done.\n\n222\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.369\nAnd here's what we're gonna do.\n\n223\n00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.619\nAnd it's not that I had to come in and\nactually mount all these cameras up and\n\n224\n00:11:45.619 --> 00:11:46.650\ndo everything.\n\n225\n00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.680\nIt was a whole team of people.\n\n226\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.120\nAnd they now can actually say at the end\nof that entire project when everything is\n\n227\n00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.890\nfinally wrapped up and all to the end,\nthat we now become what we call,\n\n228\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.740\nof course, a project in their portfolio.\n\n229\n00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.526\nIn other words, it now becomes a thing,\nI know that's the worst word to put it.\n\n230\n00:12:04.526 --> 00:12:05.566\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I keep saying the word project.\n\n231\n00:12:05.566 --> 00:12:09.602\n&gt;&gt; I understand, it's a way to\nvalidate that company's experience.\n\n232\n00:12:09.602 --> 00:12:12.147\nThey say look, this is what I've done,\nthese are the photos,\n\n233\n00:12:12.147 --> 00:12:13.168\nthe studios look great.\n\n234\n00:12:13.168 --> 00:12:15.502\nAnd then we're part of\ntheir portfolio in a sense.\n\n235\n00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:19.102\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is, it's something in\nwhich we really do become part of for\n\n236\n00:12:19.102 --> 00:12:19.846\nanother team.\n\n237\n00:12:19.846 --> 00:12:23.272\nSo projects,\nyou find them just about everywhere.\n\n238\n00:12:23.272 --> 00:12:26.404\nNormally people like that idea of\nthe portfolio because it allows for\n\n239\n00:12:26.404 --> 00:12:29.268\nsomebody to come in go, well,\ncan you really do that project?\n\n240\n00:12:29.268 --> 00:12:31.491\nWell, now they can point\nto us as a portfolio.\n\n241\n00:12:31.491 --> 00:12:33.552\nSo not only-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've already done it, ask Ronnie.\n\n242\n00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:35.495\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, ask Ronnie [LAUGH] whether or\n\n243\n00:12:35.495 --> 00:12:37.610\nnot it can actually be done that way,\nsure it can.\n\n244\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.980\nSo that's what we generally end\nup taking a look at as well when\n\n245\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.430\nyou start seeing where projects\nnormally exist in the world today too,\n\n246\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.178\nwhen you start having to\ndeal with them overall.\n\n247\n00:12:49.178 --> 00:12:52.700\nNow, we wanna make sure that there's\na clear distinction here between that\n\n248\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.990\nidea of a project and program.\n\n249\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.960\nAnd I've kinda muddled it a little bit\nby telling you that projects begin and\n\n250\n00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.420\nthey normally end as programs overall,\nokay?\n\n251\n00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.370\nBut in this sense, when we start to do\nsomething like this, we have to then,\n\n252\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.820\nof course, be able to distinguish\nthat idea of that program.\n\n253\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.766\nAnd remember that programs tend to have\nsome type of procedure and repetitive\n\n254\n00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:16.962\ntask that they have, and existing things\nthat they actually have to end up doing.\n\n255\n00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:17.938\nSo for example,\n\n256\n00:13:17.938 --> 00:13:22.541\nwhen we start taking a look at a program\nthat makes it different from a project,\n\n257\n00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:27.420\nyou might take, let's say, not the idea\nof creating a brand new baseball.\n\n258\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.630\nOkay, so let's say that somebody says,\nlook baseballs.\n\n259\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.375\nWe can make them faster and\nthat would take a project for\n\n260\n00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:36.720\nsomebody to actually be able to\ntake that and go, here it is.\n\n261\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.276\nWe're gonna make a brand new baseball\nthat's gonna be used in major league\n\n262\n00:13:40.276 --> 00:13:44.173\nbaseball so that pitchers can actually\nhave more distinguished types of pitching\n\n263\n00:13:44.173 --> 00:13:45.171\nthat they want.\n\n264\n00:13:45.171 --> 00:13:47.770\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were gonna say\nit has LEDs and blinky lights.\n\n265\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.010\n&gt;&gt; It could be LEDs and\n\n266\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.490\nblinky lights that might actually\ndistract the batter, that is true.\n\n267\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.770\nYeah, no doubt that that could happen.\n\n268\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.780\nBut it could be where somebody says that's\nthe project they wanna undertake and\n\n269\n00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.220\nthey start developing that.\n\n270\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.017\nBut the manufacturing of the baseballs\nis more of a program, right?\n\n271\n00:14:03.017 --> 00:14:07.120\nSo once they actually get that idea and\nthat concept in mind, it's not that\n\n272\n00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.855\nbuilding a brand new baseball,\nhopefully nobody would ever do that.\n\n273\n00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:11.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But people will\n\n274\n00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.400\nprobably end up doing that\nat some point in time.\n\n275\n00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.150\nThat is something that would be\nakin to what we call a program.\n\n276\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.050\nThe same thing when it comes down\nto even teaching of concepts,\n\n277\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.990\nsuch as teaching algebra in high school,\nokay.\n\n278\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.726\nNow that in itself is not that you're\ninventing algebra to teach, but\n\n279\n00:14:27.726 --> 00:14:30.638\nyou're now part of a program\nthat actually says what,\n\n280\n00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:33.320\nyou're teaching algebra\nin high school as well.\n\n281\n00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.620\nAnd so you're actually doing that as\na repetitive and daily task that you have.\n\n282\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.560\nAnd even housekeeping services\nin something like a hotel\n\n283\n00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.110\nwould be more of a program.\n\n284\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:47.000\nNow if you were inventing new housekeeping\nservices like a super concierge\n\n285\n00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.840\ntype of service or whatever the next\nlevel of housekeeping might be.\n\n286\n00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.361\nWell, that would be one thing, but\n\n287\n00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:56.420\nprograms tend to be everywhere when\nyou start to do that as well, okay.\n\n288\n00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.120\nSo those are keys for\nus in understanding that then.\n\n289\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.961\nAnd so the great thing is, this actually\ngives me a chance then to quiz Cherokee-\n\n290\n00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:06.858\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n291\n00:15:06.858 --> 00:15:10.263\n&gt;&gt; On just a couple of different things\nthat we can kind of point out here\n\n292\n00:15:10.263 --> 00:15:11.950\nto see what's happened, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.145\nSo Cherokee, one of the key aspects that\nwe might end up facing on the exam is\n\n294\n00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:18.600\nsomethings that's fairly simple.\n\n295\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.970\nWhich is to be able to distinguish\nthe difference between a project and\n\n296\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.860\na program.\n\n297\n00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.584\nSo if you kind of remember how we\ndescribed a project, you gotta\n\n298\n00:15:27.584 --> 00:15:32.240\nremember the idea of that temporary\nendeavor and the idea of the constraints.\n\n299\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.782\n&gt;&gt; A program being repetitive.\n\n300\n00:15:33.782 --> 00:15:35.124\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a program being repetitive.\n\n301\n00:15:35.124 --> 00:15:36.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, let's see how we do.\n\n302\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.620\n&gt;&gt; And having something like that.\n\n303\n00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.810\nSo let me kind of give you some examples\nhere and let's see what you can do, okay.\n\n304\n00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:47.515\nSo if you are actually a service\ncontractor for landscaping,\n\n305\n00:15:47.515 --> 00:15:52.135\nwould that be a program or\nwould that be a project?\n\n306\n00:15:52.135 --> 00:15:56.969\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so from what I've gathered,\nit seems like if I were trying to invent\n\n307\n00:15:56.969 --> 00:16:00.804\na new type of, I don't know,\nfertilizer to grow my yard and\n\n308\n00:16:00.804 --> 00:16:05.378\nit was something new and impressive\nthen it would be more of a project.\n\n309\n00:16:05.378 --> 00:16:10.014\nBut here in Florida it rains,\nwe have sunshine, [LAUGH] Unfortunately,\n\n310\n00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:11.686\nthe grass keeps growing,\n\n311\n00:16:11.686 --> 00:16:17.260\nwhich would require a repetitive\nservice that would fall under program.\n\n312\n00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit kinda bears out like that, right?\n\n313\n00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.890\nNow, what if Cherokee, instead of\nsaying the idea here of creating some\n\n314\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:26.100\nbrand new type of, what did you say?\n\n315\n00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.120\nOf soil, is that what?\n\n316\n00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:27.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, fertilizer.\n\n317\n00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.345\n&gt;&gt; Fertilizer.\n\n318\n00:16:28.345 --> 00:16:29.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Instead of trying to create\n\n319\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.330\nsomething like that,\nscientifically and in a lab somewhere,\n\n320\n00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.640\nwhat if she said I was actually\nthe landscape designer?\n\n321\n00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.250\nAnd we had just,\n\n322\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:45.530\nthat a golf course had just hired her\nto design the what, entryway landscape.\n\n323\n00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Would that be a project?\n\n324\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.160\n&gt;&gt; I think that would fall under project,\nyes.\n\n325\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.660\nIt's a temporary endeavor.\n\n326\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah because you're gonna end\nup designing the project, and\n\n327\n00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:58.570\nonce that's over, you might actually\nhave to do it depending on whether or\n\n328\n00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.070\nnot this your company or not.\n\n329\n00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.420\nBut it may be where you go all right.\n\n330\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.980\nSo now I've designed it,\nit's been approved.\n\n331\n00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.870\nWe now start to implement it.\n\n332\n00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:09.940\nAnd in that sense,\nit now becomes your program to do what?\n\n333\n00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.970\nTo carry out, to finish everything.\n\n334\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.650\nBut if you were just asked to design it,\nthat could be the idea of a project.\n\n335\n00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.915\n&gt;&gt; And then, I could take photos and\nincorporate it into my portfolio.\n\n336\n00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:21.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is actually true.\n\n337\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.710\nYou could end up doing that.\n\n338\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.826\nSo yeah, very good when we\nstart to see issues like that.\n\n339\n00:17:25.826 --> 00:17:30.490\nBut you do wanna take a look at some of\nthe examples that you might end up seeing\n\n340\n00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:35.290\nand distinguish them in\nthe terms in which we described.\n\n341\n00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.800\nAll right, so\nlet's try another one here Cherokee.\n\n342\n00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.920\nAll right, so if you are now hired\ninstead to teach, let's say, algebra,\n\n343\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.750\neither in high school, or you might\nactually hear the term upper school.\n\n344\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.672\nWell, what do you think?\nWould that be a project or\n\n345\n00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:51.322\na program at this point?\n\n346\n00:17:51.322 --> 00:17:54.898\n&gt;&gt; Well, since this was actually one\nof the examples you had given us,\n\n347\n00:17:54.898 --> 00:17:56.730\nI was paying attention.\n\n348\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.742\nRonnie did say that that would\nbe an example of a program.\n\n349\n00:18:00.742 --> 00:18:04.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwhat makes it a program Cherokee?\n\n350\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.030\n&gt;&gt; Well the fact that we have\na pre-existing methodology and\n\n351\n00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.690\nwe're just continually teaching.\n\n352\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.300\nIt makes it repetitive in that sense.\n\n353\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.010\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n354\n00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.930\nSo let's change that idea\nthat teaching element up cuz\n\n355\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.640\nthat can be a little bit tricky.\n\n356\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.280\nOkay.\n\n357\n00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.770\nSo let's say instead, Cherokee, since you\nactually do work in IT, that instead,\n\n358\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:29.620\nmy company were to hire\nyou to do a two-month\n\n359\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.490\ntraining on Office 365 so that all my\nemployees could get up to speed and\n\n360\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.850\nworking with Office 365 and make sure\nthey know the ins and outs of it.\n\n361\n00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.890\nYou're still teaching.\n\n362\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.850\nWould that be considered a program or\na project at this point?\n\n363\n00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:48.041\n&gt;&gt; I think that, because you've\nspecifically given me a timeline, a time\n\n364\n00:18:48.041 --> 00:18:52.523\nframe to complete my training, I would\ngo ahead and consider that a project.\n\n365\n00:18:52.523 --> 00:18:56.342\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that temporary endeavour\nis key, but also with that time spent\n\n366\n00:18:56.342 --> 00:19:00.160\ngiving us a time limit as far as our\nconstraint goes, and more than likely that\n\n367\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.660\nmeans that you're gonna be budgeted so\nmuch money, and here's the requirement.\n\n368\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.690\nIs that my company is going to\nsuccessfully migrate over to Office 365 if\n\n369\n00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.940\nwe're to do that.\n\n370\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.750\nAnd that indicates more of the idea\nof a project rather than teaching.\n\n371\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.770\nAnd I pointed that out\nspecifically because it's very\n\n372\n00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.770\neasy to see one as being a program,\nlike teaching a high school or a college,\n\n373\n00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.580\nor whatever course it is and\njust teaching that as ongoing.\n\n374\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.800\nBut now notice this as a contractor\nit might be something else,\n\n375\n00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.602\nlike this as well.\n\n376\n00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:30.366\nOkay?\nAll right, so\n\n377\n00:19:30.366 --> 00:19:33.858\nCherokee one more IT example here\njust because we are where we are.\n\n378\n00:19:33.858 --> 00:19:34.605\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n379\n00:19:34.605 --> 00:19:35.253\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n380\n00:19:35.253 --> 00:19:38.004\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet's say instead that I hired you though,\n\n381\n00:19:38.004 --> 00:19:38.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n382\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:44.401\n&gt;&gt; To be a developer, to develop\nspecific Java programming for ITPROTV.\n\n383\n00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:44.923\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n384\n00:19:44.923 --> 00:19:47.730\n&gt;&gt; Would that be, what do you think?\n\n385\n00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.131\nThis time I didn't give you\na time limit or anything?\n\n386\n00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:53.990\n&gt;&gt; Are we doing a specific project?\n\n387\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.220\nI can't even say the word here.\n\n388\n00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.770\nBut let's say, what would be your goal for\nme and when you hire me?\n\n389\n00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.115\n&gt;&gt; Some, let's just say,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:01.320\n&gt;&gt; As a Java type\n\n391\n00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.920\nof application that needs to run.\n\n392\n00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.922\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then I'm gonna go with a project\nhere, because normally you would go ahead\n\n393\n00:20:06.922 --> 00:20:09.880\nand code that particular\nelement that you're requesting,\n\n394\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.623\nand then the job would be finished.\n\n395\n00:20:11.623 --> 00:20:15.481\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so in that sense, yes, the\njob would be over, it doesn't mean that\n\n396\n00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:19.459\nCherokee's job couldn't end up evolving\nat that point inside of that company to\n\n397\n00:20:19.459 --> 00:20:23.693\nwhere we say, all right, Cherokee you did\nsuch a great job here's another project.\n\n398\n00:20:23.693 --> 00:20:27.490\nAnd we give her another project or\nwe might just say what?\n\n399\n00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.333\nWe need Cherokee on board full time,\nand so\n\n400\n00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:31.393\nshe just works as our\nJAVA programmer instead.\n\n401\n00:20:31.393 --> 00:20:31.908\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n402\n00:20:31.908 --> 00:20:36.186\n&gt;&gt; Now if I say that, right, if I say\ninstead, Cherokee we need to hire a JAVA\n\n403\n00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:40.270\nprogrammer, well you're now apart\nof the ITProTV program instead.\n\n404\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.010\nYou're not part of a project anymore.\n\n405\n00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:42.990\n&gt;&gt; Makes Sense.\n\n406\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.050\n&gt;&gt; It's just trying to work\non a particular endeavor.\n\n407\n00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.180\nMakes sense?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maintain and evolve, and\n\n408\n00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.910\neven improve the Java that we\ncurrently have for ITPRO.TV.\n\n409\n00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so at the very beginning and\nthe foundations here,\n\n410\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.660\nwhen we start seeing this idea\nof project properties, right?\n\n411\n00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.640\nSo is really key that we understand\nthe goals that we have in place.\n\n412\n00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.480\nNow, I wanna kind of go backward just\na little bit here to make sure that we\n\n413\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.660\nunderstand just a couple of things,\nand make sure that we point them out.\n\n414\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.270\nAnd so I went ahead and\ntyped them up on my screen so\n\n415\n00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.650\nthat we can see them\njust a little bit better.\n\n416\n00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.875\nAnd make sure that we\ntalk about it as well.\n\n417\n00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:26.645\nOkay and then we've got just a little bit\nmore that we need to cover to help us to\n\n418\n00:21:26.645 --> 00:21:29.555\nget ready for the rest of our\nshow that we'll have, right?\n\n419\n00:21:29.555 --> 00:21:34.265\nSo remember that when it comes\ndown to project management itself,\n\n420\n00:21:34.265 --> 00:21:40.900\nthe ultimate goal, right, is to deliver\nsome unique product or service or result.\n\n421\n00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.670\nNow the key here is to remember that,\nthat can actually be tangible, or\n\n422\n00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.940\nit can be intangible.\n\n423\n00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.280\nA product definitely is tangible.\n\n424\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.900\nUsually something like services\nare definitely tangible as well.\n\n425\n00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.100\nBut there can be intangible results\nthat it actually sets up what,\n\n426\n00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.280\nsuccess in the future we need to.\n\n427\n00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.490\nSo it is very possible that we do that.\n\n428\n00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, looking at those tangible\nprojects, I think it might,\n\n429\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.230\nin some ways be a little bit easier,\nif you have those baseballs and\n\n430\n00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.870\nyou can see any kind of obvious defects or\nmalfunctions.\n\n431\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.920\nBut when it comes to things like our\nsurfaces, sometimes that requires a little\n\n432\n00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.830\nextra investigation like our voice of\nthe customer and some exploratory.\n\n433\n00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.770\nAnd even like some prep ahead of time.\n\n434\n00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.890\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt that there's actually\nalong the process here where you'll have\n\n435\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:32.340\nto actually do a little bit of quality\ncontrol and quality assurance here.\n\n436\n00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.310\nSo just realize that projects themselves\ndon't necessarily mean that they're always\n\n437\n00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.040\nsuccessful, so\n\n438\n00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.580\neven though we might have a result,\nthe result could be a negative result.\n\n439\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.400\nSo, let's say that Cherokee\ndoes hire me to do a project,\n\n440\n00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.990\nand to produce something, some product.\n\n441\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.680\nAnd at the end of it,\nI hand it over to Cherokee and\n\n442\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.715\nCherokee goes, Ronny that's junk.\n\n443\n00:22:50.715 --> 00:22:52.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's just a piece of junk.\n\n444\n00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.730\nI don't want it at all.\n\n445\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.600\nWell, the project still existed,\n\n446\n00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.360\nand she now has something tangible in her\nhand that she can point out as being junk.\n\n447\n00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.470\nBut it is possible.\n\n448\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.610\nSo, not every project ends\nsuccessfully is my point here.\n\n449\n00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:05.670\nNow, of course,\n\n450\n00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.920\nbetter project management is gonna help\nyou to end this project successfully.\n\n451\n00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.350\nAt least that's what we're hoping for.\n\n452\n00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.195\nI just kinda realize that,\nthat that's what we'll also see.\n\n453\n00:23:13.195 --> 00:23:17.600\nRemember that intangible idea too is\nthat it could be where we're setting up\n\n454\n00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.180\nthe project so that we can have\nbetter processes in the end as well.\n\n455\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.050\nSo it might be that we realize that for\n\n456\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:28.650\nus to streamline something else,\nwe need to actually establish a program.\n\n457\n00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.780\nIn other words we have a project to\nestablish a program, I know that's weird.\n\n458\n00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.480\nThat says that here's how we're gonna\ndo things to make it a little bit more\n\n459\n00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.470\nstreamlined.\n\n460\n00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.370\nSo in the end,\n\n461\n00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.590\nwe don't know if it's gonna work until it\nactually works in true production here.\n\n462\n00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.740\nSo that is very possible, okay?\n\n463\n00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.435\nNow the other thing that we wanna point\nout here as a way of review as we take\n\n464\n00:23:46.435 --> 00:23:49.584\na look on my screen here,\nis the idea of a temporary endeavor,\n\n465\n00:23:49.584 --> 00:23:52.702\nremember that there's a beginning and\nan established end.\n\n466\n00:23:52.702 --> 00:23:57.569\nBut notice is this, okay, it doesn't\nindicate how long it's going to take,\n\n467\n00:23:57.569 --> 00:24:02.291\nso that's kind of a weird concept\nespecially if you're very western mind,\n\n468\n00:24:02.291 --> 00:24:06.345\nand we say, it begins at 8:00,\nends at 5:00 here, So for\n\n469\n00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:08.925\nus we just count up\nthe hours in between and\n\n470\n00:24:08.925 --> 00:24:14.240\nwe say that's how long the projects gonna\ntake but project don't tend to that.\n\n471\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.000\nWe just say that there is gonna be\na definite beginning to the project and\n\n472\n00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.200\nthere is a definite end but the duration\nitself can actually span over.\n\n473\n00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.270\nWell, it could weeks,\nit could be hours, it could be days,\n\n474\n00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.730\nit could be whatever it might be.\n\n475\n00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.280\nBecause the idea of duration\nis not taken into account\n\n476\n00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.600\nof a project especially when you're\ntrying to produce something unique.\n\n477\n00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.112\nYou don't know how long it's gonna take\nunless you've already produced something\n\n478\n00:24:38.112 --> 00:24:38.903\nfairly similar for\n\n479\n00:24:38.903 --> 00:24:41.738\nmaybe another company that you might\neven be able to estimate that.\n\n480\n00:24:41.738 --> 00:24:47.090\nSo the idea of a temporary\none is also key, too.\n\n481\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.120\nNow, we've also talked about the\nconstraints here, such as resources and\n\n482\n00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.970\nquality, as well as time.\n\n483\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.820\nSo this also means that projects\nneed to have scheduled work, okay?\n\n484\n00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.520\nBecause what we'll end\nup finding out is that\n\n485\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.720\nsome work can be done in a certain order.\n\n486\n00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.240\nSome work has to be done in a certain\norder, or other work can't get done, so\n\n487\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.560\nwe'll see that as well.\n\n488\n00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.520\nAnd also on resources too, and quality,\nthere has to be some type of assurance\n\n489\n00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.703\nthat it meets a minimum quality\nstandard and requirement too.\n\n490\n00:25:14.703 --> 00:25:18.508\nAnd then ultimately of course is for\nsome stakeholder satisfaction.\n\n491\n00:25:18.508 --> 00:25:20.230\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie,\n&gt;&gt; Is just gonna help us.\n\n492\n00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.770\n&gt;&gt; Sorry to interrupt you there but\nfor some of us,\n\n493\n00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.850\nsince we're just starting out\nhere with our project plus,\n\n494\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.540\nsome of us might not be familiar\nwith this term stakeholder.\n\n495\n00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.220\nCould you kinda clue us in there?\n\n496\n00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're gonna talk about this\na little bit more in detail but\n\n497\n00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:36.400\na stakeholder is somebody that has\nsome type of interest in that project.\n\n498\n00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.780\nAnd usually that interest has\nto deal with either money, or\n\n499\n00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.150\nthey've invested some type of time.\n\n500\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.220\nSo now that they've given\nyou money to start it,\n\n501\n00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.620\nthey've produced some type of time, they\ndesire to see that project done so they\n\n502\n00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.190\nmight even offer you some expert advice\nto doing this when you start seeing it.\n\n503\n00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.230\nBut that's what we start to\ntake a look at is that normally\n\n504\n00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:59.010\nit actually is designed to\nmeet somebody's satisfaction.\n\n505\n00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.743\nSo we don't just produce products and\nprojects to just have products and\n\n506\n00:26:02.743 --> 00:26:06.967\nprojects, we actually produce it because\nsomebody's normally requested it and\n\n507\n00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:08.514\nwe hope it meets their goals.\n\n508\n00:26:08.514 --> 00:26:11.800\nNow here's the key statement I\nwant us to get to understand.\n\n509\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:16.950\nThe problem is understanding what the heck\nthe satisfaction actually means here.\n\n510\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.780\nSo what we normally talk about at this\npoint, let's take a look at my machine\n\n511\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:24.340\nagain, is the idea of what we\ncall smart goals here, okay?\n\n512\n00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:28.810\nSo notice I talk about specific\nmeasurable, attainable, realistic, and\n\n513\n00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:29.700\ntimely.\n\n514\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.330\nAnd the way that we tend to do that is\nby using some type of worksheet, okay?\n\n515\n00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:35.920\nNow I came up with this one on my own.\n\n516\n00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.890\nThere's plenty out there on\nthe internet that you can just type in\n\n517\n00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:43.470\nsmart goals worksheet and you'll come\nup with them in all different designs.\n\n518\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.150\nHere's the way I always envision\nit as far as the table goes and\n\n519\n00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.910\nI don't know why I do that,\nI just always do.\n\n520\n00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:54.260\nSo normally when you do start to say,\nhey, here is my overall project, okay?\n\n521\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.050\nYou might actually go ahead and print\nout this for every stakeholder, okay.\n\n522\n00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.240\nWhat is it that must be done, okay?\n\n523\n00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.580\nWhat are we actually trying to do?\n\n524\n00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.001\nHow do you know that you actually\nhave accomplished it, okay?\n\n525\n00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:10.700\nHow do you know when everything's\nactually been achieved here?\n\n526\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.700\nSo you not only have measurable\ngoals that you actually say, hey,\n\n527\n00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.290\nI've actually hit that mark.\n\n528\n00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.563\nYou actually have to ask,\nif this possible, okay?\n\n529\n00:27:17.563 --> 00:27:19.400\nAnd then is it realistic?\n\n530\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.710\nCan we actually do it?\n\n531\n00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.480\nWe might find out something,\nespecially on this realistic one.\n\n532\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That it's realistic for\n\n533\n00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.710\nsomebody else that has more\nresources than you do.\n\n534\n00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.297\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It might not be realistic for\n\n535\n00:27:28.297 --> 00:27:31.270\nyou that may not have as\nmany resources as well.\n\n536\n00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.550\nAnd then ultimately, timely here.\n\n537\n00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.640\nSo everybody might end up saying,\nall right, as they come together and\n\n538\n00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.470\nstart to do a product, and this is key,\nwhat you don't want is somebody saying,\n\n539\n00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.770\nhere it is, here's the product.\n\n540\n00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.550\nAnd then Cherokee looking at it going,\nwell,\n\n541\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.540\nthat wasn't what I envisioned at all,\nI didn't have any of that in mind.\n\n542\n00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.010\nAnd now you're going, well I just\nspent $10,000 producing this and\n\n543\n00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.810\nnow you're telling me it's not\nwhat you wanted, Cherokee.\n\n544\n00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.790\nI'm gonna be fairly upset if\nyou do something like that.\n\n545\n00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:58.160\n&gt;&gt; Putting it in black and white just\nsolidifies and makes sure that everyone's\n\n546\n00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.870\non the same page, no pun intended but,\n&gt;&gt; Well, it really does.\n\n547\n00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.910\nIt helps to keep everything realistic,\nright?\n\n548\n00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:08.410\nCuz remember that there are people\nout there, that they are dreamers,\n\n549\n00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:09.850\nwhich is great, okay?\n\n550\n00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:10.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n551\n00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.750\n&gt;&gt; And we love the idea of\nsomebody dreaming about this.\n\n552\n00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.662\n&gt;&gt; But in the end, we might find\nout that that dream is unrealistic.\n\n553\n00:28:16.662 --> 00:28:19.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is not anywhere attainable, okay?\n\n554\n00:28:19.777 --> 00:28:24.440\nThere is no way for us to measure that we\ncan hit that particular dream mark that\n\n555\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.030\nthey have, and it's not very specific.\n\n556\n00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:32.120\nIf you tell me I want you to design me\na car that floats in the cloud, well,\n\n557\n00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.230\nwhat does that mean?\n\n558\n00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.470\nWhat does something like\nthat actually mean?\n\n559\n00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.550\nWhat do you mean by floating in the cloud?\n\n560\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.990\nHow do you measure that?\n\n561\n00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.910\nIs it okay if it only floats in,\n\n562\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.820\nin other words,if I produce\na cloud at ground level?\n\n563\n00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.370\nIs that actually a card\nfloating in the cloud at all?\n\n564\n00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.555\nHow do you define float at this time?\n\n565\n00:28:49.555 --> 00:28:52.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, so there's a lot of those things.\n\n566\n00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:56.080\n&gt;&gt; It would make that rush hour traffic so\nmuch easier to deal with,\n\n567\n00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.880\nthat is for sure.\n\n568\n00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so now all of a sudden\nyou are going, I am doing this for\n\n569\n00:29:00.175 --> 00:29:02.189\nthe idea of traffic, now you gotta go,\n\n570\n00:29:02.189 --> 00:29:05.631\nwait a minute is that actually\neven manageable in gains anywhere?\n\n571\n00:29:05.631 --> 00:29:07.430\nRegardless of whether you're actually\nin the car, floating in the car.\n\n572\n00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:08.910\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n573\n00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:13.242\nthat's the goal in the ideas that normally\nyou have something that's fairly in other\n\n574\n00:29:13.242 --> 00:29:16.200\nwords something that can\nbe put down on paper.\n\n575\n00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.840\nSo that we can see it and that we can work\nwith it a little bit better when we start\n\n576\n00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:25.020\nto take a look at those ideas of\nbeing able to do that as well.\n\n577\n00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.964\nSo keeping all that in mind,\n\n578\n00:29:26.964 --> 00:29:31.986\nwhen we start to take a look at the\nproperties here it really is helpful if we\n\n579\n00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:37.181\nunderstand that all this is involved\nin what a project actually has in hand.\n\n580\n00:29:37.181 --> 00:29:41.170\nBut there's a problem though Cherokee.\n\n581\n00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.640\nWell, there always are problems but\nthat's what you and\n\n582\n00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.820\nI are here to understand and do.\n\n583\n00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.377\nProjects, when they\nare at the dream level,\n\n584\n00:29:48.377 --> 00:29:52.430\nwhen they are at the very beginning,\nthey're always this big, okay?\n\n585\n00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.291\nEverybody can always turn it, and\nsee it, and look at it and go, man,\n\n586\n00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:58.916\nthat's exactly what I want to produce,\nokay?\n\n587\n00:29:58.916 --> 00:30:02.585\nWhen it hits the reality here,\nin these smart goals,\n\n588\n00:30:02.585 --> 00:30:07.850\nwhen it starts to actually say,\nhow can we do something like this?\n\n589\n00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:12.150\nNow all of a sudden, you find out\nit actually requires a project\n\n590\n00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.230\nthat has a project within it,\nthat has multiple\n\n591\n00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:18.850\nprojects that actually help build that\nbefore you can actually build this.\n\n592\n00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.170\nSo in other words,\nprojects are like weddings here, Cherokee.\n\n593\n00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:22.990\nThey only get bigger and\n\n594\n00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.500\nthey only get more complex if\nyou don't manage them well.\n\n595\n00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we're here to discover\n\n596\n00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:32.490\nis the way that we help to manage that\nby using project management tools and\n\n597\n00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:34.630\nwhat we have out there\nas far as skills go.\n\n598\n00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.200\nThat's what's gonna really\nhelp us to keep that\n\n599\n00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.415\nfrom being a wedding that starts off with,\nwe're just gonna have two people.\n\n600\n00:30:41.415 --> 00:30:44.005\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And six weeks later it's 10 and\n\n601\n00:30:44.005 --> 00:30:48.885\nthat nice little reception\nthat started off with ten.\n\n602\n00:30:48.885 --> 00:30:52.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know we've got photo booths and\nchocolate fountains and everything else.\n\n603\n00:30:52.645 --> 00:30:56.745\nAnd so now it's become reproduction,\nwell, projects can do the same things.\n\n604\n00:30:56.745 --> 00:31:00.055\nProject management is what helps us to\nkeep that manageable and so we've got\n\n605\n00:31:00.055 --> 00:31:03.790\na lot more tools and we've got a lot more\ntechniques that we need to talk about.\n\n606\n00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.670\nBut overall though, here is the beginning.\n\n607\n00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.540\n&gt;&gt; I think you've done\na really good job Ronnie.\n\n608\n00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:12.148\nWe've been able to look at the very\nconcept in bringing our ideas to\n\n609\n00:31:12.148 --> 00:31:17.460\nfusion with the process here,\nour project plus training and\n\n610\n00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.350\nI appreciate you coming today and\nI appreciate all of you folks.\n\n611\n00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.590\nI think we're about time\nto wrap up here today.\n\n612\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.900\nSo thank you for joining us here\nat ITProTV, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n613\n00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.291\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome to another great\nepisode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.545\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose and\n\n5\n00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:21.190\ntoday, we're gonna be looking\nat CompTA's Project Plus.\n\n6\n00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.560\nSpecifically, we're going to be looking\nat roles and responsibilities and\n\n7\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.420\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong with us today to\ngo ahead and cover some of these topics.\n\n8\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.566\nThank you for being here Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:34.120\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue on to take a look\n\n10\n00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.020\nat this idea of project management and\n\n11\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.680\nsome of the different roles and of course,\nthe responsibilities that are out there,\n\n12\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.870\nthat need to ensure that they're\ncovered to have a successful project.\n\n13\n00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.390\nNow the problem that we have with projects\nand project managements, fairly simple.\n\n14\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.160\nProjects can be relatively\nsmall if not extremely small,\n\n15\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.570\nwhere everything might end up\nbeing done from conception,\n\n16\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.740\nfrom the very beginning, the initiation,\nall the way to the closing by one person.\n\n17\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.050\nAnd in that sense, we don't really\nneed multiple roles, right,\n\n18\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.000\nbecause all the responsibility essentially\nlies in that one person doing everything.\n\n19\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.640\nBut more than likely, and the majority\nof the time, what you're gonna end up\n\n20\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.660\nseeing instead though, is that projects\ntend to go beyond the single person.\n\n21\n00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.460\nAnd when that starts to happen, you might\nstart to see, especially as the project\n\n22\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.600\ncontinues to grow to where it's actually\na complex project, where there's projects\n\n23\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.430\nwithin projects, or different phases of\ndifferent projects that have to go on, and\n\n24\n00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.700\nmultiple projects happening at one time,\nto build your project,\n\n25\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.310\nyou're gonna see that these roles are\nactually very important to distinguish.\n\n26\n00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940\nAnd so those responsibilities\nthat we tend to have\n\n27\n00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.620\nare actually going to be separated out,\nand we'll see that a little bit more.\n\n28\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.850\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, you speak about these\ncomplex projects, but to get a good\n\n29\n00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.750\ntemplate, or a canned place to start,\nare there any specific roles and\n\n30\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.320\nresponsibilities that are a little\nmore generic, that can be used for\n\n31\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.740\nmultiple projects?\n\n32\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what you're gonna end up seeing\noverall though, that even though specific\n\n33\n00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.870\ntypes of technical fields will have maybe\neven certain roles that are only going to\n\n34\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.880\nbe specific to those fields, almost every\nproject, in terms of project management\n\n35\n00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.260\nare going to figure out and kind of fall\ninto, well, several different roles.\n\n36\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.670\nAnd that's what we're gonna\nreally break down into,\n\n37\n00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.890\nis we're gonna talk about each of these.\n\n38\n00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.280\nWe're gonna take a look at the idea\nof what we call a project sponsor,\n\n39\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.130\nor a champion, of course.\n\n40\n00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.930\nAnd we're gonna describe that and\nmake sure we understand what the roles and\n\n41\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.940\nresponsibilities are.\n\n42\n00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.630\nWe're also gonna take a look at\na project manager as well so\n\n43\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.690\nthat we understand even though the entire\nshow is about project mangers, we want to\n\n44\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.240\nunderstand what their particular\nrole is gonna be and why they're so\n\n45\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.810\nimportant and even stakeholders,\nat least, for this episode too.\n\n46\n00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.900\nThat's what we're gonna end up seeing.\n\n47\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.390\nBut there's actually a lot more and\n\n48\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.920\nI think that might actually\ntake us at least at this point,\n\n49\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.570\nthat'd bring us through some of them and\nwe'll probably see a bit more as we go on.\n\n50\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.960\n&gt;&gt; So when you said sponsor and champion,\nthose are actually two separate words,\n\n51\n00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.590\nterminology there that we need to know?\n\n52\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to whether or\nnot they're gonna be separated out or\n\n53\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.740\nwhether they're two in one, it really\ndepends on the size of the project itself,\n\n54\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.620\nas well as the scope of the project and\nhow big it's actually going to be.\n\n55\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.610\nSo I hate to say it, it really does\ndepend on the person itself too.\n\n56\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.320\nAs I started to think about it I was like,\nyeah that matters, that matters, but\n\n57\n00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.170\nit also depends on the person.\n\n58\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.950\nSo normally someone that's a project\nsponsor, let's go ahead and\n\n59\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.500\nput it this way if we can,\na project sponsor is the one that has\n\n60\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.550\nlegal authority, and\nhas ownership of that project.\n\n61\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.370\nSo they can sign off on this particular\nproject by approving you know\n\n62\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.240\nthings that need to go on so that the\nproject can begin, can talk about funding,\n\n63\n00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.340\ncan do all that stuff, but\nthey may not have the technical expertise\n\n64\n00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.300\nin terms of getting that project\nstarted and understanding some\n\n65\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.150\nof the challenges that may be\nthere in that sense, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.080\nAnd if you have something like that,\nthen that's gonna be two separate roles.\n\n67\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.400\nYou're gonna have a project sponsor\nthat essentially says look,\n\n68\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.950\nI'll sign off on this,\nI wanna see it carried out.\n\n69\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.120\nI wanna make sure it's actually going\nright, and they'll sign off on it.\n\n70\n00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.370\nBut then you need somebody that\nhas that technical expertise and\n\n71\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.680\nwhen they have that,\n\n72\n00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.350\na lot of times that particular person\nbecomes what we call a project champion.\n\n73\n00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.320\nThat particular project champion not\nonly has that technical expertise, but\n\n74\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.220\ncan see how to overcome some of the issues\nthat may have to be carried out inside of\n\n75\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.060\nthat project as well and they become\nan advocate, a cheerleader, a coach,\n\n76\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.900\nwhatever you want to call them, that\nwill help to get this through as well.\n\n77\n00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.810\nSo normally people working on\na project ultimately, their particular\n\n78\n00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.030\nwork ends up at the project champion so\nthat they can review it and\n\n79\n00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.070\nactually say, here's who's gonna\nbe responsible for this as well.\n\n80\n00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.960\nSo there's a lot of things that go on\nhere, but it actually does seem that\n\n81\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.110\nwhen things are happening at this level,\nthe project sponsor and\n\n82\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.880\nthe project champion at the planning\nstage, they're really heavily involved\n\n83\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.920\nin high level types of planning,\nbut they're not involved in\n\n84\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.970\nevery single technical detail even\nthough the champion may understand that.\n\n85\n00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.150\nSo in that sense,\n\n86\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.440\nit could be the person itself that says, I\ndon't have the technical expertise for it.\n\n87\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.390\nSo he goes and finds a champion while he\nremains the sponsor or it could be that,\n\n88\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.940\nthat individual himself has\nboth the technical expertise\n\n89\n00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.970\nas well as owns the project and\nhe can actually do them both.\n\n90\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.740\nSo you might see a combination of them and\n\n91\n00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.400\ninside of Comptia's Project + here,\nthey only really call out,\n\n92\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.930\nactually both as being one particular\nindividual a lot of times.\n\n93\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.710\nAnd if you go to the PMI's\nofficial project\n\n94\n00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.410\nmanagement body of knowledge, they don't\neven mention the term project champion.\n\n95\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.940\n&gt;&gt; And how important would you\nsay that this individual's role\n\n96\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.170\nwould be to the overall\ncompletion of the project?\n\n97\n00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.630\n&gt;&gt; Well to the overall completion of\nthe project, you don't have the ability to\n\n98\n00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.240\ncomplete the project without the project\nsponsor signing off at the very end, okay.\n\n99\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.680\nYou also may not have\nthe ability to say technically,\n\n100\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.190\nwe've done everything that we needed to,\nyet the project champion doesn't\n\n101\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.450\nhave an understanding of how\neverything went together.\n\n102\n00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.630\nSo in that sense,\nthey are actually very important roles,\n\n103\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.240\nthat has the signing authority as\nwell as the technical authority,\n\n104\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.740\nto say everything was done\nthe way that it needed to be.\n\n105\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.740\n&gt;&gt; Would this individual also\ndirectly embark on project tasks, or\n\n106\n00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.470\nare they mainly overseeing the completion?\n\n107\n00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.950\n&gt;&gt; Well normally on a project,\nsponsor and the idea of the champion,\n\n108\n00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.600\nis that they are really\nthere to oversee things, and\n\n109\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.020\nto ensure that things are getting\ndone at a very high level.\n\n110\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.560\nNow it doesn't mean that they can't be.\n\n111\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.930\nLike I said, depending on the project\nitself, if it's a small project and\n\n112\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.430\nthere's only one or\n\n113\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.420\ntwo people, they may actually also be\nright there doing the work as well.\n\n114\n00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.740\nSo it is very possible we'll end up seeing\nthat in terms of the project champion and\n\n115\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.640\nthe project sponsor.\n\n116\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.920\nSo it can be both.\n\n117\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.270\nIt can be a single individual,\nit could be two separate individuals.\n\n118\n00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.520\nIt really does depend on a lot of\nthe different variables that are there.\n\n119\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, if you were looking for\napproval for a particular change or\n\n120\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.620\nproject and you had to present it in front\nof a board, then that would be an example\n\n121\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.130\nof having multiple individuals\nthat could play in that roll.\n\n122\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.220\n&gt;&gt; More than likely, right.\n\n123\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.480\nThe project sponsor may actually\nbe the one sitting there saying,\n\n124\n00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.930\nall right tell me why this needs to be\ndone on this project, and the champion may\n\n125\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.550\nbe the one that advocates, here's why that\nchange needs to be done or here's what\n\n126\n00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.000\nneeds to be done because without it, we\ncan't actually make the project finished.\n\n127\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.150\nSo in that sense if they\nseparate the roles,\n\n128\n00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.290\nyou do have where they're\nworking in conjunction but\n\n129\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.140\nat the same time, the project champion is\nlike the technical adviser to the project\n\n130\n00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.200\nsponsor himself who ends up signing\noff on whether or not to do that, and\n\n131\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.580\nends up having that authority to be\nable to release funds when needed to.\n\n132\n00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.080\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n133\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.349\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n134\n00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:50.026\nwe also wanna take a look then at the idea\nhere of what we call the project manager.\n\n135\n00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:54.586\nNow remember that everything that we're\ntalking about here in the Project+,\n\n136\n00:07:54.586 --> 00:07:59.092\nreally evolves around that sphere of\nwhat we call project management itself.\n\n137\n00:07:59.092 --> 00:08:03.404\nAnd in that sense, there's a ton of tools,\nthere's a ton of techniques,\n\n138\n00:08:03.404 --> 00:08:06.074\nthere's a ton of different\nskills that you and\n\n139\n00:08:06.074 --> 00:08:09.310\nI are going to at least\nlearn the fundamentals of.\n\n140\n00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:14.003\nTo understand what the project manager and\nproject management actually does for us.\n\n141\n00:08:14.003 --> 00:08:17.976\nAnd that is where we want to begin,\nas well as having a good,\n\n142\n00:08:17.976 --> 00:08:20.046\nsolid understanding of that.\n\n143\n00:08:20.046 --> 00:08:22.350\nSo that's what we wanna take up now.\n\n144\n00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:27.060\n&gt;&gt; So the role of project manager, would\nthey also go ahead and partake in those\n\n145\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:32.580\nactual project tasks, or does their\nrole evolve throughout the project?\n\n146\n00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that's a great question.\n\n147\n00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.050\nOnce again, you hate to say this,\nit goes back to the size of the project or\n\n148\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.330\nthe complexity of the project itself.\n\n149\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.830\nYou might find the project manager\nneeding to partake in it, but normally,\n\n150\n00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.750\nhere's where people mistake this.\n\n151\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.926\nWhen you come off of working for,\nlet's say,\n\n152\n00:08:50.926 --> 00:08:54.922\na project leader of some sort or\nworking on a project team.\n\n153\n00:08:54.922 --> 00:08:57.307\nAnd they end making you\nthe project manager,\n\n154\n00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:02.090\nyou always feel like you need to jump in\nthere and help, and finish and do things.\n\n155\n00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.368\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The reality is the project manager,\n\n156\n00:09:04.368 --> 00:09:07.780\nthough, which is kind of strange here,\nthey should be\n\n157\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.310\ncoming up with a way to manage all\nthose things that need to be done.\n\n158\n00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.020\nAnd I have a story about that, Cherokee.\n\n159\n00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.720\nI used to do some training out of the\nplace that did phosphorus mining, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.910\nAnd they had multiple project\nteams working out there, and\n\n161\n00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.170\ntheir way of actually promoting\nsomebody to project manager was simple.\n\n162\n00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.440\nIt was always getting the guys\nworking off the line and\n\n163\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.100\ndoing those mining projects to come off\nthere and to become the project manager.\n\n164\n00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.110\nWell, when it came down to the project\nmanagement then, they were normally\n\n165\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:41.180\nassigned to, let's say, four different\ncrews of teams that they had to work with.\n\n166\n00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.741\nAnd every time when\nsomebody wouldn't show up,\n\n167\n00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:47.183\nthat project manager would just\njump in and actually do the work.\n\n168\n00:09:47.183 --> 00:09:50.840\nNow, you might go, well, that's great,\nthat's what a project manager should do.\n\n169\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.690\nThere's a problem with\nsomething like that, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.260\nIt's that the project manager himself,\nwhen he does that,\n\n171\n00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.130\nhe is now taking his time\naway from the management side\n\n172\n00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.140\nof the three other projects to\njust help this one project out.\n\n173\n00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.753\nAnd even though that\nsounds like it's good,\n\n174\n00:10:05.753 --> 00:10:09.130\nit can be very detrimental to\nthose other three projects.\n\n175\n00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.867\nSo a project manager really needs to stay\non top of the focus, which is saying-\n\n176\n00:10:12.867 --> 00:10:14.018\n&gt;&gt; So they can delegate accordingly.\n\n177\n00:10:14.018 --> 00:10:16.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the management that they need.\n\n178\n00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.281\nSo normally, they don't participate\nin the actual direct task itself, but\n\n179\n00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.913\ntheir roles can change as\nthe project moves through.\n\n180\n00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:27.176\n&gt;&gt; So let's say I'm one of those\nindividuals, like a team project member,\n\n181\n00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:31.770\nthat has been delegated, too, and I have\nan obstacle that I need to overcome.\n\n182\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.760\nAnd I have a question that I\nneed to address to a superior.\n\n183\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.290\nOut of those terms,\nthe sponsor, the champion, and\n\n184\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.550\nthe project manager, who would I report\nto directly or communicate with?\n\n185\n00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.116\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is where it gets\na little bit more complex, once again,\n\n186\n00:10:44.116 --> 00:10:45.163\ndepending on the project.\n\n187\n00:10:45.163 --> 00:10:48.725\nIf it's a large project, you report to\nwhoever your team leader is going to be,\n\n188\n00:10:48.725 --> 00:10:50.120\nand they raise that question.\n\n189\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.150\nIf they don't have that, then you normally\nreport up the line to whoever the team\n\n190\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.040\nproject leader actually reports to to\nfigure out where that's going to be.\n\n191\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.332\nAnd they might address some\nkind of controls to give them.\n\n192\n00:10:58.332 --> 00:11:01.738\n&gt;&gt; So there's definitely a chain of\ncommand in place for one to follow.\n\n193\n00:11:01.738 --> 00:11:05.780\n&gt;&gt; Ideally, yes, okay,\nin reality, not necessarily so,\n\n194\n00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.350\nespecially if you work with part-time\ncontractors, if you do other things.\n\n195\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.170\nYou might find out that the ultimate\nauthority lies in how much authority\n\n196\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.050\nthat picker team was given.\n\n197\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.830\nSo in this sense, the project manager,\nthough, has laid out,\n\n198\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:18.730\nessentially, the plan.\n\n199\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.310\nAnd that's what I wanted to get back to\njust briefly when you talk about this\n\n200\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.410\nidea, which is a great idea, that the\nproject manager's role really does change\n\n201\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.190\nthroughout the duration of the project.\n\n202\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.360\nAt the very beginning,\nwhen nothing is actually done,\n\n203\n00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.950\nthe project manager is already\nthere trying to say and\n\n204\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.010\ntrying to think about what\ndo I need to manage, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.270\nWho do I need to manage?\n\n206\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.090\nHow do I manage it?\n\n207\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.900\nHow do I schedule this?\n\n208\n00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.570\nHow do I get all this stuff done?\n\n209\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.020\nAnd they work very hard during\nthat initialization phase.\n\n210\n00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.163\nBut then it comes to the planning side\nwhere they set all this stuff down and\n\n211\n00:11:50.163 --> 00:11:51.800\nthey start putting it into a project plan.\n\n212\n00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.450\nAnd so their particular paperwork and\n\n213\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.333\ntheir ability to get all the plans in\nplace is where the project manager\n\n214\n00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:03.332\ntends to do the majority of\nthe work that needs to be done.\n\n215\n00:12:03.332 --> 00:12:07.307\nBut then when we have the monitoring and\nexecution of that project,\n\n216\n00:12:07.307 --> 00:12:12.262\nhis particular role doesn't actually get\nmore intense as much as he's now checking\n\n217\n00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:17.310\nthe work versus what the plan was and\ntrying to see if it actually matches up.\n\n218\n00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.760\nIf it doesn't match up,\n\n219\n00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.555\nhe's the one that may send the message to\nwhoever is actually doing the execution,\n\n220\n00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:26.620\nsaying, hey, here's where you're behind,\nor hey, I see you're ahead.\n\n221\n00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.030\nCan you send me the information so\nthat I can actually figure out,\n\n222\n00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.720\nwhy did you get ahead on this particular\nproject when I had you planned for this.\n\n223\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.240\nSo that he can actually figure out whether\nor not it's because of the plan, or\n\n224\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.235\nwere those people very efficient,\nor did they cut some corners?\n\n225\n00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:44.201\nSo the project manager has a lot to do,\nbut in that execution phase,\n\n226\n00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:45.600\nnot as much hands-on.\n\n227\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.677\nAnd at the very end,\nhe's the one that decides whether or\n\n228\n00:12:48.677 --> 00:12:52.090\nnot this is actually going to be\nthe final kind of deliverable.\n\n229\n00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.890\nHe's gonna hand it to the sponsor.\n\n230\n00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.760\nThe sponsor then will decide whether or\nnot this is actually going to be the one\n\n231\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.110\nthat says, hey,\nwe're done with this project.\n\n232\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.370\nWe're ready to turn this over to whoever\nthe customer is and our stakeholders, and\n\n233\n00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.702\neverything is good.\n\n234\n00:13:03.702 --> 00:13:09.872\nSo you'll see that his role does change\nthroughout the entirety of the project.\n\n235\n00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:14.681\nAll right, so the other thing that we\nhave then as we start to take a look\n\n236\n00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:19.350\nat that role of the project manager\nis that his role is really big.\n\n237\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.600\nIt's gigantic,\nin terms of what needs to be done.\n\n238\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.000\nAnd so you will have project managers\nof varying skill and, of course,\n\n239\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.510\nof varying levels that they have.\n\n240\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.920\nSome project managers you'll never see.\n\n241\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.630\nOkay, some of them will\nactually be right there onsite,\n\n242\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.810\nsome of them will\nactually be on your team.\n\n243\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.980\nThey'll be working and in hand with you.\n\n244\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.548\nIt just depends on what you have\nto think about there, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:42.548 --> 00:13:45.523\nSo, so far we've talked about\nthe idea of the project sponsor,\n\n246\n00:13:45.523 --> 00:13:48.520\nas well as the project champion and\nthe project manager.\n\n247\n00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.670\nThere are many different layers to this,\nbut\n\n248\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.260\nat least you understand what\nthose roles are going to be.\n\n249\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.790\nSo when you start seeing this, really,\nwhen it comes down to the functionality of\n\n250\n00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.533\nwhat they manage, they start by\nmanaging the scope, the time, and\n\n251\n00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:07.196\nthe resources of the project by putting it\ninto that idea of the project plan, okay,\n\n252\n00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:10.041\nand seeing everything that\nneeds to be done there.\n\n253\n00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:12.280\nThat's what they actually end up doing.\n\n254\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.560\nThey're massaging all these elements\ntogether within those constraints of time\n\n255\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.470\nrequirements and cost to try and get\nthe overall temporary endeavor done, okay?\n\n256\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:27.637\nAnd at the most basic level, they manage\nthe quality assurance that the project\n\n257\n00:14:27.637 --> 00:14:31.410\nis getting done at the requirements\nthat it actually needs to be done at.\n\n258\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.630\nAnd it's not just done because\nwe completed something.\n\n259\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.990\nAnd then they are absolutely\nresponsible for whatever is created.\n\n260\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.490\nSo even though the project\nsponsor himself owns it,\n\n261\n00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.071\nthe project manager is ultimately\nresponsible for the quality, and\n\n262\n00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:51.070\nfor the time, and for\nthe cost of the overall project himself.\n\n263\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.190\nSo there's a lot that goes on with\nthe idea of the project manager.\n\n264\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great, I see another\nterm we have here is stakeholder.\n\n265\n00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.700\nRonnie, you explained this to us a few\nmoments ago, but just to kind of reiterate\n\n266\n00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.220\nand cover that term, how would you\ngo ahead and define stakeholder?\n\n267\n00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is where the terminology is\nkinda fuzzy and doesn't really make sense\n\n268\n00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.010\nif you haven't been dealing in\nthe realm of project management.\n\n269\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.110\nEverybody always puts it in these terms.\n\n270\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:21.100\nA stakeholder is someone, okay,\nhe, she, whatever it might be,\n\n271\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.200\nokay, that has a vested interest.\n\n272\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.690\nAnd that's the term that always bothered\nme, vested interest in the project, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.717\nNow that idea of vested interest,\nwhat do you think that means, Cherokee?\n\n274\n00:15:30.717 --> 00:15:34.005\n&gt;&gt; Well, see, when I trained for\nproject management,\n\n275\n00:15:34.005 --> 00:15:36.789\nit was with a different\ncertificate agency.\n\n276\n00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:41.718\nAnd the way I was taught was that\nbasically anyone who would be\n\n277\n00:15:41.718 --> 00:15:45.779\naffected by the overall\noutcome of that project,\n\n278\n00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:50.628\nwhether it be employees,\ncustomers, the shareholders.\n\n279\n00:15:50.628 --> 00:15:55.966\nAnd even depending on the scope of your\nproject, it could even be the public.\n\n280\n00:15:55.966 --> 00:16:00.912\n&gt;&gt; Right, so anyone who is affected by\nit could potentially be a stakeholder in\n\n281\n00:16:00.912 --> 00:16:01.929\nyour project.\n\n282\n00:16:01.929 --> 00:16:06.306\nAnd that's normally what you do mean when\nyou start taking a look at the overall\n\n283\n00:16:06.306 --> 00:16:08.600\nrealm of the project itself.\n\n284\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.560\nBut stakeholders a lot of times, right,\n\n285\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:17.210\nthey are the ones who are responsible for\nthe project work getting done, okay.\n\n286\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.700\nNow, you can have stakeholders that have\na vested interest in two particular ways.\n\n287\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.870\nOne, of course, is negatively.\n\n288\n00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.430\nAnd the other one,\nof course, is positively.\n\n289\n00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.600\nNormally, on project management,\n\n290\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.490\nwe mean the positive idea here,\nnot always the negative idea.\n\n291\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.330\nBut normally,\nthat's who we're talking about.\n\n292\n00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.030\nIf somebody has a vested interested\nin that project being completed,\n\n293\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:41.630\nthat means that they absolutely have\nput some time into that project.\n\n294\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.410\nWhether it was because they\noffered their own expertise\n\n295\n00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.640\ninto the insights of how\nthat project is to be done.\n\n296\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.330\nOr they may have actually went ahead and\nput up some money to help that\n\n297\n00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.080\nproject get started, or get carried\nthrough in that particular portion and\n\n298\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.400\nthey expect a return from that or\nit could be actual effort that they put.\n\n299\n00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.520\nIn other words, they're part of a team\nwhich is now again part of the actual\n\n300\n00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.330\noverall project, which needs to get\ndone so that their company can get paid.\n\n301\n00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.280\nYou name it,\nthey become a stakeholder as well just by\n\n302\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.460\nthe very fact that they're\ndoing work on the project, too.\n\n303\n00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:24.310\nSo in that sense they have a very real way\nof doing things that can really affect us,\n\n304\n00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:29.440\nthe very fact is a project stakeholder\nregardless of how small it can be,\n\n305\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.050\ncan really affect the overall\nproject steering,\n\n306\n00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.080\nnow in a positive way, hopefully,\n\n307\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.380\nthat's what the majority especially if\nI'm the project manager I want you to do.\n\n308\n00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.110\nBut the very fact is,\nCherokee mentioned something.\n\n309\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.630\nThat even the public could actually be\nconsidered a stakeholder in my project,\n\n310\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.430\nand what if they don't want\nmy project to come through?\n\n311\n00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:52.130\nThey can literally be the people that\nsteers my project to the point where\n\n312\n00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.530\nit just has to end.\n\n313\n00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.150\nBecause nobody else wants it,\neven though I might want it.\n\n314\n00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.490\nIt might be something that actually\nends because that particular stakeholder\n\n315\n00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:04.590\nhas a vested interest in not,\nin that project either not completing, or\n\n316\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.410\nnot even taking place at all.\n\n317\n00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nthe internet's really even shaped that.\n\n318\n00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.439\nHave you seen a lot of those web sites\nwhere they have those start-up companies,\n\n319\n00:18:11.439 --> 00:18:12.554\nand they have to go ahead and\n\n320\n00:18:12.554 --> 00:18:15.853\nget x amount of contributors to the public\nto go ahead and support their project,\n\n321\n00:18:15.853 --> 00:18:18.457\nto even purchase the supplies to\ngo ahead and continue to do so.\n\n322\n00:18:18.457 --> 00:18:21.236\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and to me,\nthat's a little bit unusual.\n\n323\n00:18:21.236 --> 00:18:21.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because,\n\n324\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.170\nyou can't, you know,\nyou hate to say this, right?\n\n325\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.586\nWhere does the money go if all of\na sudden, now, you have another group that\n\n326\n00:18:27.586 --> 00:18:31.061\nsays look, here's 10,000 people\nthat contributed a dollar each and\n\n327\n00:18:31.061 --> 00:18:33.686\nall of a sudden, you go,\nwell, I needed 15,000.\n\n328\n00:18:33.686 --> 00:18:35.430\nWhere does the money\nactually end up going?\n\n329\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.770\nWhat ends up happening to that\nmoney if it doesn't do anything?\n\n330\n00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.060\nAnd a lot of times, you just don't know.\n\n331\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.360\nSo the idea that somebody can have a\nvested interest in your project is great,\n\n332\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.910\nbut when you start thinking about it for\n\n333\n00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.960\nyour project management ideas, you always\nthink about it in terms of, at least for\n\n334\n00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.170\nme, concretely,\nthe way that I always do it.\n\n335\n00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.460\nAs they invest time in my project,\nthey invest money into my project,\n\n336\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.700\nthey put any type of work to help me,\nto get that project successful,\n\n337\n00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.530\nthat's normally who I think about as\nbeing a stakeholder in my project and\n\n338\n00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.680\nthat's important to make, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.643\nSo, even if they offer me at least\na modicum of advice as a subject matter\n\n340\n00:19:11.643 --> 00:19:14.639\nof expert and\nI told them what I was I doing.\n\n341\n00:19:14.639 --> 00:19:17.950\nAnd they're like,\nhere's what I'd like to see you do, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:22.440\nEven that statement unto itself means that\nthat person has now actually invested some\n\n343\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.450\ninterest in my project,\nwhich helps me to succeed.\n\n344\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:30.170\nI would consider them a vested interest\nin the project and a stakeholder.\n\n345\n00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.810\nAnd all these are actually very important.\n\n346\n00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.590\nBecause remember, a project stakeholder,\n\n347\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.270\nnot necessarily just a simple one\neven though it could be, okay.\n\n348\n00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.490\nSuch as a project sponsor,\nhe's a stakeholder in the project, right.\n\n349\n00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.190\nProject manager is if\na project sponsor says look,\n\n350\n00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.710\nI don't want this project to succeed,\nthe project will never get off its ground.\n\n351\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.440\nOkay, it's just not going to happen.\n\n352\n00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.210\nSo even though he might actually\nbe the original sponsor\n\n353\n00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.170\nhe may choose-\n&gt;&gt; You're fired-\n\n354\n00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.500\n&gt;&gt; After a while, yeah he's fired or\n\n355\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.460\nyou're fired or whatever it might be.\n\n356\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.940\nIf you're a project manager and\nyou decide to quit,\n\n357\n00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.810\nwell remember there's ramifications for\nthe rest of the project that goes on to.\n\n358\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:08.527\nSo everybody that's a stakeholder\nnormally likes the idea of status quo,\n\n359\n00:20:08.527 --> 00:20:10.680\nlikes the idea of positive pushes.\n\n360\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.190\nBut it doesn't mean it\nalways happens as well.\n\n361\n00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.760\nSo there's a lot of different roles that\nwe're actually seeing right here just\n\n362\n00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.600\nas we begin.\n\n363\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.070\n&gt;&gt; And thank you for\nexplaining those, Ronnie.\n\n364\n00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.975\nI think you did a really great job\ndefining those roles and their\n\n365\n00:20:21.975 --> 00:20:26.070\nresponsibilities but I think let's gonna\ngo ahead and wrap it for this episode.\n\n366\n00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:30.890\nSo thank you guys for tuning in with us\ntoday and I'm Cherokee Boose, signing off.\n\n367\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.325\nAnd I'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; Have a great day.\n\n368\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.802\n[MUSIC]\n\n369\n00:20:39.802 --> 00:20:43.184\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.488 --> 00:00:15.630\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.460\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.430\nAnd if you're here you've probably been\nfollowing along with our CompTIAProject+\n\n6\n00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.150\ntraining.\n\n7\n00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.640\nWe've just wrapped up talking about some\nintroductory roles and responsibilities.\n\n8\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.634\nAnd in this episode we're\ngonna go ahead and pick up and\n\n9\n00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:33.162\nlook at if we were going to look\ndown that tier, that hierarchy.\n\n10\n00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:36.117\nWe will look at some additional roles and\nresponsibilities and\n\n11\n00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:38.579\nwho better to help us with\nthat then sir Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for being with us, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me on the\nshow as we continue on taking a look at\n\n14\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.230\nsome of these different roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n15\n00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.750\nWe're moving on to, well,\njust some additional\n\n16\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.990\nroles that we have to understand that\nyou're normally gonna end up finding.\n\n17\n00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.370\nAnd this is really one of\nthe roles that the CompTIAProject+\n\n18\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.720\nexamination is really designed to help\nvalidate the skills and knowledge for,\n\n19\n00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.660\nwhich is the idea of something that\nwe call a project coordinator.\n\n20\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.440\nNow, Cherokee, when we hear about\nthe idea of a project coordinator,\n\n21\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.550\nwhat terms come to your mind\nwhen you hear coordinator.\n\n22\n00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.720\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps scheduling, and adhering\nto certain deadlines and timelines?\n\n23\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.700\nYeah, that's exactly what it sounds like,\n\n24\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.630\nis that there's something\nthat needs to be coordinated.\n\n25\n00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.030\nIn other words,\nneeds to be arranged and danced or\n\n26\n00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.240\nwhatever it might be that two things\nare gonna have to come together at least\n\n27\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.070\nto make sure that everything\nis actually getting done.\n\n28\n00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.720\nAnd that's the same thing that's really\ntrue about accomplishing a project\n\n29\n00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.620\nsuccessfully at the very end,\nis that it's not so\n\n30\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.650\nmuch about an incredible micromanagement\nas much as it's about bringing\n\n31\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.580\nall of these different forces that\nare in play, into some type of dance or\n\n32\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.980\nsymphony or organization that\nallows them to work together.\n\n33\n00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.650\nNow when I talk about\nthese different elements,\n\n34\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.140\nright, we're really talking about the\nconstraints that we have on our project.\n\n35\n00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.200\nThe idea of understanding what\nthe requirements are of the project.\n\n36\n00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.980\nThe idea of understand that\nwe're under a time limit and\n\n37\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.100\nthat there is a cost value associated that\nall these elements have to come together.\n\n38\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.230\nAnd normally it requires the idea\nof what we call a project\n\n39\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.270\ncoordinator is what we have here.\n\n40\n00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.356\nSo that is where we want\nto begin is in this idea.\n\n41\n00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:22.350\nNow, when we start talking about it\nremember that we rarely take a look at\n\n42\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.821\nthe idea of a project sponsor as\nwell as the idea of the manager,\n\n43\n00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.380\nthe project manager itself and\nthe actual stakeholder itself.\n\n44\n00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.320\nSo there's a lot going on when\nwe start to take a look on\n\n45\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.540\n&gt;&gt; It does sound like a lot is going on,\n\n46\n00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.130\nwe've got all these different roles.\n\n47\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.640\nAnd so, Ronnie could you please tell\nme exactly what needs to happen,\n\n48\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.100\nwhat needs to transpire for that\nactual project to be accounted for and\n\n49\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.230\nconsidered to be complete.\n\n50\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.220\n&gt;&gt; When you start to take a look at it,\nright, and the project itself,\n\n51\n00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.680\nyou can kind of compare the idea of\nthe project coordinator's role and\n\n52\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.470\nresponsibilities to what we would call\nsomething like an air traffic controller.\n\n53\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.780\nOr even the idea of some\ntype of professional juggler\n\n54\n00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.420\nthat keeps everything\nin the air at one time.\n\n55\n00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.090\nAnd that's what you have when you\ntalk about air traffic control and\n\n56\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.440\nyou talk about a juggler.\n\n57\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.450\nEverything that's actually in play,\n\n58\n00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.440\nright, is all good until something goes\nwrong and that's were the coordination\n\n59\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.410\ncomes in to make sure that everything is\nactually proper in a way that needs to be.\n\n60\n00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.590\nNow when you don't have that,\nI'm gonna use the juggler example cuz\n\n61\n00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.140\nthe other examples really bad here,\nis if the juggler,\n\n62\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.340\nprofessional juggler drop something\nthe need thing about that juggler is that,\n\n63\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.230\neven though he might drop something it's\nvery easy for somebody to go ahead and\n\n64\n00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.830\npick up something and toss it back in,\nand he could continue to juggle.\n\n65\n00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.550\nBut the idea here is that somebody\nhas to have those skills and\n\n66\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.910\nthat particular set of skills and\ndetermination to make it work.\n\n67\n00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.330\nAnd so that's what we wanna focusing\non is, what are those responsibilities,\n\n68\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.800\nlike Cherokee's talking about,\nto make it work out here.\n\n69\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.238\nThe main particular role, okay, and\n\n70\n00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:59.880\nduty of somebody that's gonna\nbe the project coordinator,\n\n71\n00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.740\nhe is there to ultimately support the\nproject manager in multiple ways, okay.\n\n72\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.840\nFirst and foremost of course is\nfunctional coordination of the project.\n\n73\n00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.430\nNow when I say that what does that mean?\n\n74\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.010\nThat means that a lot of times you're\ngonna have multiple project teams that\n\n75\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.000\nare going to be competing for resources\nat times, for the amount of dollars\n\n76\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.410\nthat they need, for whatever might be\nscheduling time on a particular machine.\n\n77\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.240\nYou name it, that what has happened is\nthat somebody needs to keep that common\n\n78\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.980\nidea of coordinating when these things\nare to happen so that nobody is actually\n\n79\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.990\ncheated out of any particular time that\nthey need to finish up what they need.\n\n80\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.250\nBut it has to be, again, scheduled, it has\nto kind of be managed in that way as well.\n\n81\n00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.380\nThe other thing here is\nproper documentation.\n\n82\n00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.400\nThe project manager may work\non a ton of documentation but\n\n83\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.170\nhe may not know where everything is.\n\n84\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.430\nThe coordinator is the one that\ncan pull out the information\n\n85\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.810\nthat needs to be there at the time when\nit's needed, when it's requested as well.\n\n86\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.000\nSo proper backup and documentation,\nas well as administrative support for\n\n87\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.230\nthe entire project is gonna be,\n\n88\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.290\nnormally on the responsibility\nof the project coordinator.\n\n89\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.920\nNow, notice that in this particular role,\nthey don't have to know an extreme\n\n90\n00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.460\namount of project management details or\nevery skill that a project manager has.\n\n91\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.560\nBut has at least to know the basics and\nthe fundamentals of project management,\n\n92\n00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.380\njust like what we're talking about\nhere in the CompTIAProject+.\n\n93\n00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.830\nSo they have to have something like this.\n\n94\n00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.930\nThey also need to have that ability\nof understanding how to schedule, and\n\n95\n00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.500\nthe idea of time management is a big one.\n\n96\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.930\nAnd ultimately at the end, they have to\nhave the foundations of being able to do\n\n97\n00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.980\nsome quality checks that need to go on if\nwe have deliverables that come around too.\n\n98\n00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.900\nBecause all this actually does come\non to the entire project itself.\n\n99\n00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.790\nThe coordinator is what makes sure\nthat things are where they need to be,\n\n100\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.430\nthe right people are where they need\nto be and everything is done on time.\n\n101\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.170\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, with that project\ncoordinator be the one who's\n\n102\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.690\nactually scheduling individual tasks, so\nwould that be offset to a specific role\n\n103\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.300\nthat would be considered\nit's own separate realm.\n\n104\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, once again,\nwe have the idea of the project manager,\n\n105\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.190\ncan the project manager do exactly\nwhat Cherokee's talking about.\n\n106\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.440\nYes, okay.\n\n107\n00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.343\nBut does it mean that they should\ndo what Cherokee's talking about?\n\n108\n00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:28.940\nNot necessarily.\n\n109\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.230\nSo in this sense, even though the project\ncoordinator should absolutely\n\n110\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.800\nhave an understanding of what needs to be\nwhere and how that needs to be, in a small\n\n111\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.640\nproject, he may take that role on or\nshe may take that particular role on and\n\n112\n00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.730\nnot have to worry about\nanybody else doing it.\n\n113\n00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.270\nBut in reality as\nthe project gets larger or\n\n114\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.500\nmore complex,\none person may not be enough.\n\n115\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.480\nAnd what we might do\ninstead is actually end up\n\n116\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.050\ngetting what we call a project\nscheduler instead, that will help to\n\n117\n00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.320\nschedule out these things and that's\nwhat we tend to look at as well, okay.\n\n118\n00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.390\nSo when we start taking a look\nat the idea of a scheduler,\n\n119\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.060\nif you have a coordinator you may be\nwondering why the heck is a scheduler.\n\n120\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why time management so\n\n121\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.780\nimportant when it comes to\nour projects here, Ronnie?\n\n122\n00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.640\nYeah, it's very important\nbecause remember that for\n\n123\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.420\nus a project always resides within\nthose three constraints, okay.\n\n124\n00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.600\nTime, the idea of requirements, and\nof course the idea of cost here.\n\n125\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.450\nAnd time is one of those requirements\nthat we have to actually live with, or\n\n126\n00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.250\nthe constraint that we have to live in.\n\n127\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.010\nAnd it's never actually\nmeasured from without it.\n\n128\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.840\nSo in that sense, even if we\nhave a ton of resources on hand,\n\n129\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.260\nthey may not be available for\nthat particular time, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.886\nEven though we may have all\nof the money that we need,\n\n131\n00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:52.586\nwe may not be able to release it if\nthere's not resources to release them to\n\n132\n00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:54.276\nin that particular time as well.\n\n133\n00:07:54.276 --> 00:07:58.165\nSo you can imagine that during\nthe duration of the entire project,\n\n134\n00:07:58.165 --> 00:08:01.012\nit's very important then\nThat we learn how to use\n\n135\n00:08:01.012 --> 00:08:04.426\ntime as a resource just like\neverything else that we have.\n\n136\n00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:09.460\nAnd be able to ensure that we have it\navailable to us when we need it available.\n\n137\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.060\nAnd a scheduler, somebody that's\nfocused in on time management.\n\n138\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.800\nAnd on getting the resources that\nare actually in place that we need\n\n139\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.940\nis gonna be very key for us.\n\n140\n00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.800\nSo a scheduler essentially\nhelps us by developing them and\n\n141\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.590\nmaintaining the overall\nproject schedule itself.\n\n142\n00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.670\nNow remember, the IBS schedule actually is\ndetermined in a couple of different ways.\n\n143\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.450\nIt's not just about days that\nare actually available to work, but\n\n144\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.800\nit's also about the overall time that they\nhave to work on the project itself, too.\n\n145\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.350\nSo there's a lot of\ncoordination that goes on.\n\n146\n00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.700\nBut the idea of actually scheduling it and\nmaking sure that that person is there,\n\n147\n00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.660\nmaking sure those resources are there,\n\n148\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.740\nmay actually fall into that responsibility\nof the project scheduler, too.\n\n149\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so just to recap I want\nto make sure I understand this.\n\n150\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.920\nSo not only are they responsible for the\ninitial task of scheduling, but they also\n\n151\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.160\nneed to kind of crack the whip, so to\nspeak, to make sure everyone is on task.\n\n152\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.390\nAnd they're actually providing any\nkind of deliverables at certain kind\n\n153\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.720\nof tollgates that had been accounted for\nahead of time.\n\n154\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, it could be the scheduler's\nresponsibility, okay.\n\n155\n00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.990\nUsually the scheduler, though,\nis not the enforcement side of things, so\n\n156\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.660\nhe puts it on or\nshe just puts it onto the schedule and\n\n157\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.650\nallows everybody to see\nwhat the schedule is.\n\n158\n00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.235\nIf things starts falling behind,\n\n159\n00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:27.472\nthen the enforcement part really\ncomes with the coordinator, okay.\n\n160\n00:09:27.472 --> 00:09:30.486\nThe coordinator is the one that\nunderstands that even though this\n\n161\n00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:33.500\nparticular scheduler may be\nhandling the schedule for one team,\n\n162\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.920\nit may not be handling it for every team.\n\n163\n00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.110\nSo it's the coordinator that says, here's\nwhy you have to do this on this date\n\n164\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.180\nbecause I have another crew coming in\nright behind you on this date, okay.\n\n165\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.290\nSo not every single scheduler\nwill have everything, but\n\n166\n00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.230\nthey'll know that here's\nthe dates are available.\n\n167\n00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.010\nAnd they actually take the resources,\nwhether it's people,\n\n168\n00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.720\nwhether it's materials,\nwhether it's a piece of equipment.\n\n169\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.510\nThey have to actually go, all right,\nhere's what it's scheduled for, and\n\n170\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.310\nhere's where it needs to be.\n\n171\n00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.375\nSo a scheduler could,\nif the project is small enough,\n\n172\n00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:05.320\nactually be the one that\nhas to do that enforcement.\n\n173\n00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.840\nBut not generally a lot of times are they\nactually gonna be that particular person.\n\n174\n00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.270\nBut what they need to do, though, is if\nthey want to enforce it, they need to\n\n175\n00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:19.340\nmake sure that they do get performance\nreports from whoever they're scheduling,\n\n176\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.780\nto make sure they're actually getting\nthe information that they need.\n\n177\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.210\nAnd they need to make sure that everything\nthat they're actually doing, okay,\n\n178\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.750\nthat they're actually told\nwhen it's accomplished or\n\n179\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.340\nhow far along that they are.\n\n180\n00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.520\nSo they know that on the following day or\non whatever remaining time they have,\n\n181\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.280\nthey'll know how much work\nstill needs to be scheduled.\n\n182\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.860\nSo there's a lot more to it than\njust saying, I'm on the calendar.\n\n183\n00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.240\nThere really does have to be a concerted\neffort from the scheduler as well as those\n\n184\n00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.570\nwho are scheduled, to be able to have\nthat open line of communication.\n\n185\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.150\nSo the scheduler knows, all right,\ntoday we accomplished 30% of our work.\n\n186\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.290\nWe were supposed to be at 50, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.650\nWell, if I know that, that means tomorrow,\nI still have to accomplish about 70% of\n\n188\n00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.990\nthe work, when I should have actually\nonly had to accomplish half of it.\n\n189\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.500\nAnd I know that I either\nneed more resources, or\n\n190\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.820\nI need to actually change the actual\noverall project deliverables,\n\n191\n00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.248\nor I need to throw money at\nit until it actually works.\n\n192\n00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:16.340\nSo the scheduler's actually very\nimportant in that particular aspect\n\n193\n00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.360\nof what we do inside of our project.\n\n194\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.524\nBut just kind of remember that you may\nhave a project manager that has this\n\n195\n00:11:22.524 --> 00:11:26.150\noverall schedule and\nhe can follow that from beginning to end.\n\n196\n00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.733\nBut he doesn't know the details,\nwhereas a scheduler himself or\n\n197\n00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:33.447\nherself, may actually be able to\nlook into their team and realize,\n\n198\n00:11:33.447 --> 00:11:37.890\nhere's how long this takes, and\nthen report that on up the chain, too.\n\n199\n00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.560\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, you've explained some\nmanagerial rules such as the sponsor,\n\n200\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.630\nthe champion, the stakeholder,\n\n201\n00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.560\nthe project manager, the project\ncoordinator, even the scheduler.\n\n202\n00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.650\nBut how would you define those individuals\nwho are actually responsible for\n\n203\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.460\nthe teamwork and\nbeing a part of that project?\n\n204\n00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:59.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, normally we define it as\nbeing the project team itself.\n\n205\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.280\nThese are the people that really do put\ntheir hands to the work that actually\n\n206\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:09.000\nneeds to be done to accomplish the task so\nthat the project itself can be successful.\n\n207\n00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.100\nNow the project team itself, of course,\neven though we're talking at\n\n208\n00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.840\na very high level function, we've gotta\nrealize that there's a lot that goes\n\n209\n00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.620\ninto the project team before it really\nbecomes a team sometimes, right?\n\n210\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.390\nSo in a small project, remember,\nit might just be two people.\n\n211\n00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.380\nAnd if they work together for a long time,\n\n212\n00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.680\nthey know each other, there's not a lot\nof set up and prep that needs to be done.\n\n213\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.400\nBut if this team is brand new,\nyou may find yourself in the process of\n\n214\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.350\nactually building the idea of a team\nthat can work, coordinate and\n\n215\n00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:45.110\nbe able to function together before\nany work actually gets done here.\n\n216\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.630\nSo the idea of a project\nteam is what we need.\n\n217\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.950\nAnd that, of course, includes different\nskill sets that need to be brought\n\n218\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.300\ntogether so\nthat the project team can work.\n\n219\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.200\nThe idea of collaboration that they\nhave the skills to communicate and\n\n220\n00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.890\ncollaborate with each other to\naccomplish what they need as a team.\n\n221\n00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:04.580\nAnd the ability for\nthem to function working together.\n\n222\n00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.230\nWe know people that can actually\nwork as individuals, but\n\n223\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.460\nwe also need the people that can\nactually work together as well.\n\n224\n00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.760\nThat's where the project team comes in.\n\n225\n00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.420\nNow my whole point behind saying all that,\nright, is saying that even though we're\n\n226\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.470\ngonna talk about it in the span of\nthree or four minutes here, okay.\n\n227\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:25.130\nThe overall real and ultimate nature\nbehind this is actually much more complex\n\n228\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.700\nwhen you have to talk about building\na team and doing some of the other things.\n\n229\n00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.860\nAnd realizing there's gonna\nbe problems on the team.\n\n230\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.710\nAnd we're gonna get all into that in\nterms of resource coordination and\n\n231\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.870\nmanagement in future episodes.\n\n232\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.200\nBut just kinda realize, at least at this\nlevel, you're gonna see that there's gonna\n\n233\n00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.380\nbe that project team that we really\nhave to at least kind of coordinate and\n\n234\n00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.130\nget together at the very\nbeginning to help us out.\n\n235\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.040\nNow when we start to do this, right,\nthat means that we have to ask\n\n236\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.160\nthat very same question here about, all\nright, so what is it that a project team\n\n237\n00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.820\ndoes to make the entire\nproject then successful, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.200\nWell, overall when we start\nto think about it, okay,\n\n239\n00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.030\nthe project team is probably\ncalled together for a reason.\n\n240\n00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.190\nOne, it might be again each\none of their skills, right,\n\n241\n00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:17.127\nadded together make up every skill that we\nneed to to accomplish the project, okay.\n\n242\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.820\nSo their own expertise is\nprobably what builds and\n\n243\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.620\nadds value to them being on our team.\n\n244\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.650\nAnd that's why we need them, okay,\nso it is possible to do that.\n\n245\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:34.000\nAlso, there are particular contribution,\nokay, hopefully as far\n\n246\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.080\nas there being a project team member gives\nus the deliverable that we're looking for\n\n247\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.030\non the schedule that we're looking for\nas well.\n\n248\n00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.960\nThere's always that time when you\nask somebody can they do that?\n\n249\n00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.910\nThey answer, yes,\nof course, I can do that.\n\n250\n00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.230\nAnd then you go and\ncheck on them in a week.\n\n251\n00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.190\nAnd you say, hey, can you do this?\n\n252\n00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.860\nThey're saying, yes, I can do that.\n\n253\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.090\nYou go and check on them in three weeks.\n\n254\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.470\nCan you do this?\n\n255\n00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.360\nYes, of course, I can do it.\n\n256\n00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.840\nAnd then,\nyou go back to them six weeks later.\n\n257\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.517\nAnd they're saying look,\nI can do this, but\n\n258\n00:15:04.517 --> 00:15:07.765\nI can't do it in the time\nyou're pushing on me to do it.\n\n259\n00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:11.471\nYou're saying, wait a minute, we're six\nweeks in and this is your first time at\n\n260\n00:15:11.471 --> 00:15:14.650\nexpressing that you couldn't do it\nin the time that I'm giving you.\n\n261\n00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.500\nNow all of a sudden you realize that maybe\nthey were not the best particular member\n\n262\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.050\nof the team because it does require a bit\nof a time constraint that we got to work\n\n263\n00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:25.894\nwith as well.\n\n264\n00:15:25.894 --> 00:15:30.190\nSo when you have something like that,\nyou've got to be willing then, as a team,\n\n265\n00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.717\nokay, and\nwhoever's actually working on it,\n\n266\n00:15:32.717 --> 00:15:36.761\nto realize that everything that you do\nis underneath that time constraint,\n\n267\n00:15:36.761 --> 00:15:40.965\nthat requirement constraint, as well\nas the cost constraints that you have.\n\n268\n00:15:40.965 --> 00:15:45.668\nAnd this means we also depend on them for\nsomething very easily as far as project\n\n269\n00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:50.239\nmanagers go, which is to estimate\ndurations of overall tasks that we have.\n\n270\n00:15:50.239 --> 00:15:53.337\nSo they normally can contribute\nto that as well as the cost and\n\n271\n00:15:53.337 --> 00:15:56.762\neven dependencies that have to go\non before they can do their work.\n\n272\n00:15:56.762 --> 00:16:00.315\nAnd this is something else that you and\nI might not see as a project manager.\n\n273\n00:16:00.315 --> 00:16:04.883\nWe might not see that as we actually have\nadded on tasks to our project plan that\n\n274\n00:16:04.883 --> 00:16:07.341\nwhen we say here's what needs to be done,\n\n275\n00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:11.020\nthat six other things needed to\nbe done before I can do my task.\n\n276\n00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.400\nAnd when something like that happens,\n\n277\n00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.320\nwell that means everything\nhas to be at a standstill.\n\n278\n00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.490\nAnd sometimes that project team\nmember is the only one that sees it.\n\n279\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.700\nYou do need to listen to\nthem when this happens.\n\n280\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.500\nBut just kind realize that it's the team\nmembers or the project team itself\n\n281\n00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.920\nis who's gonna help to accomplish\nthe successfulness of your project, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:31.082 --> 00:16:36.710\nAll right, lastly we also want to take\na look at a group that you might see,\n\n283\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.140\nyou might never see.\n\n284\n00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:43.733\nAnd you normally only see them in fairly\nlarge particular types of companies,\n\n285\n00:16:43.733 --> 00:16:47.900\nwhich is what we call a project\nmanagement office or a PMO.\n\n286\n00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:53.268\nNow the exam itself, probably you'll\nsee the term project management office.\n\n287\n00:16:53.268 --> 00:16:57.300\nBut acronyms are pretty much a mainstay\nin just about any professional\n\n288\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.700\ncertification that you go after.\n\n289\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.250\nSo you might as well learn that one,\n\n290\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.950\nPMO stands for\nProject Management Office, okay.\n\n291\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.490\nSo, when you start having something like\nthis it could be that you work for a very\n\n292\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:13.720\nsmall company you never heard of a PMO,\ndon't have one, and that's perfectly fine.\n\n293\n00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.860\nBut in large companies,\n\n294\n00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.720\nthe ones that are always doing projects,\nthey kind of realized something.\n\n295\n00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.690\nThat the better way to accomplish and\n\n296\n00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:27.450\nto make a project successful is to have\nthe resources and the tools available.\n\n297\n00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:32.225\nAnd actually even some expertise\navailable that a particular\n\n298\n00:17:32.225 --> 00:17:34.348\nproject manager can have.\n\n299\n00:17:34.348 --> 00:17:38.277\nSo that he doesn't have to go and\nsearch for every single resource himself.\n\n300\n00:17:38.277 --> 00:17:41.877\nOr devote a ton of time into\nprojects that may be fairly similar,\n\n301\n00:17:41.877 --> 00:17:45.960\nwhen they can go project management\noffice to help them out.\n\n302\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.177\nSo the project management office\ndoes multiple things for us, and\n\n303\n00:17:50.177 --> 00:17:54.994\none of course is it helps us to understand\nthe values of that company by saying\n\n304\n00:17:54.994 --> 00:17:57.160\nas you start a project.\n\n305\n00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.780\nHere are the standards that you\nare going to be held to, okay,\n\n306\n00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.630\nwhen you start working on that project.\n\n307\n00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.500\nAnd that's kind of a big one.\n\n308\n00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.233\nDepending on the company itself, you may\nfind one particular company not adhering\n\n309\n00:18:09.233 --> 00:18:12.825\nto any real particular standards\nthat they really care about.\n\n310\n00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:14.262\nBut you might find other companies,\n\n311\n00:18:14.262 --> 00:18:16.216\nespecially companies\nthat are publicly traded.\n\n312\n00:18:16.216 --> 00:18:20.526\nWhere they might absolutely follow\nparticular types of regulations or\n\n313\n00:18:20.526 --> 00:18:24.690\nset of standards or practices that\nthey expect you to have throughout\n\n314\n00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.640\nthe entire organization as well as for\nyour project.\n\n315\n00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.740\nThe best place for you to learn about it\nis not in the coffee room from some guy as\n\n316\n00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.940\nyou are working through your project\nlike man I can't believe this.\n\n317\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.970\nI don't know why they're not\nallowing me to do this here.\n\n318\n00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.120\nI can tell you, but\n\n319\n00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.390\nwhere the authority of that comes from\nis that project management office.\n\n320\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.050\nSo it's something that you do want to\nmake sure that if your company has one,\n\n321\n00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.540\nyou check that out, cuz that's gonna be\nthe best resource for you as well, okay?\n\n322\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.390\nAlso along with that project management\noffice, depending on what type of project\n\n323\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.180\nyou're on, you might find out that you're\nnot the one that set the deliverable.\n\n324\n00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.060\nThey're the ones that set what\nyou're actually going to deliver.\n\n325\n00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.590\nSo be aware, you go in as a project\nmanager and they say, here it is Cherokee.\n\n326\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.610\nHere's the project you're\ngonna be working on, okay.\n\n327\n00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.665\nHere's what we expect you to deliver,\nhere's what we expect you to do.\n\n328\n00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:15.500\nAnd you can go well who\nthe heck came up with this?\n\n329\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.890\nAnd they're gonna say we did.\n\n330\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.760\nAnd that's it, you're working for\ntheir company, so\n\n331\n00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.380\nit's not that you have to decide that.\n\n332\n00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.000\nSo as a project manager you may not\nactually have to go through the majority\n\n333\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.220\nof the initiation phase of your project.\n\n334\n00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.910\nOr they've actually already\ndecided that for you,\n\n335\n00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.080\nso they set up everything in that sense.\n\n336\n00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.350\nThey provide for\nus key areas of governance.\n\n337\n00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.410\nIn other words, they're the overseers\nof your particular project.\n\n338\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.870\nYou are in charge, you are able to do\neverything that you need to do, but\n\n339\n00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.830\nwhen it comes down to\nthe governance of that project,\n\n340\n00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.910\nthat's where you're gonna find\nguidelines for regulations.\n\n341\n00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.490\nThey may also hold the key performance\nindicators that we tend to actually look\n\n342\n00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.690\nfor, to verify that our project is\nstill on time, on task, and on budget.\n\n343\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.650\nThey may provide additional resources and\ntools.\n\n344\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.650\nWhen you go,\nthis is what I need to get done, and\n\n345\n00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.830\nyou might go,\nI don't know of anything that does that.\n\n346\n00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.130\nIt could be the project\nmanagement office says,\n\n347\n00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.650\nhere's what you need to get that done.\n\n348\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.370\nAnd they tell you,\n\n349\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.880\nhere's how you requisition it,\nhere's how you do this, and\n\n350\n00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.250\nit helps you do that without you having to\nfigure out the entire process by itself.\n\n351\n00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.560\nIt can even go into the areas of you,\nas a project manager,\n\n352\n00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.755\nsaying, here's the consequences\nof it not being done.\n\n353\n00:20:24.755 --> 00:20:28.220\nNon-performance, you name it,\nwhatever it can be.\n\n354\n00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.100\nDocumentation that you have to keep.\n\n355\n00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.920\nThey're the ones that are gonna have all\nthat documentation if you need to fill\n\n356\n00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.850\nout forms,\n\n357\n00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.520\nif you need to follow templates to ensure\nthat you're doing the proper worksheets.\n\n358\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.280\nYou name it, it's going to help you out.\n\n359\n00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.360\nYou might be wondering why do we\nneed all this if I'm working for\n\n360\n00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.300\na big company that has all\nthe resource int he world?\n\n361\n00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.055\nEven big companies don't have every\nsingle resource on this planet.\n\n362\n00:20:49.055 --> 00:20:53.360\nThey always have to actually depend on\nthe very fact that there's a pool of\n\n363\n00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.150\nproject managers that they have.\n\n364\n00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.780\nMaybe a pool of resources\nthat they depend on.\n\n365\n00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.910\nAnd those even have to be\nscheduled between projects.\n\n366\n00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.896\nSo you've got to realize that\nthere's a lot more to it, for\n\n367\n00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:07.662\na large organization that actually has\na small pool instead of just a single\n\n368\n00:21:07.662 --> 00:21:09.361\norganization that only has one.\n\n369\n00:21:09.361 --> 00:21:12.243\nIn other words you're going to do every\nproject and so you have to do it.\n\n370\n00:21:12.243 --> 00:21:15.163\nSo there's a lot of\ndifferent types of roles and\n\n371\n00:21:15.163 --> 00:21:19.112\nresponsibilities out there that\nyou're likely to encounter.\n\n372\n00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:22.040\nIt doesn't mean that you're gonna\nencounter every single one every time you\n\n373\n00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.170\nwork on a project.\n\n374\n00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.540\nBut just kind of realize that you're\ngonna see at least some of these\n\n375\n00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.630\nas you actually start into your career\nin terms of project management.\n\n376\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat was my next question, Ronnie.\n\n377\n00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.552\nYou've covered the essentials,\nthe ones that Comptia wants us to know.\n\n378\n00:21:34.552 --> 00:21:39.277\nBut then I was going to ask you if we\nalways had to have those particular roles\n\n379\n00:21:39.277 --> 00:21:40.340\nfilled.\n\n380\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.757\nAnd then also If we have a particular\nproject that's a little more\n\n381\n00:21:44.757 --> 00:21:49.656\nspecific to our industry, or\nenvironment could we add additional, and\n\n382\n00:21:49.656 --> 00:21:52.083\nthen delegate roles in that sense.\n\n383\n00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:53.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're gonna have to, right?\n\n384\n00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.290\nSo everything that we've talked about\nreally is kinda more the generic\n\n385\n00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.930\nstaple of roles that you'll generally see.\n\n386\n00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.370\nAs your project grows more complex,\nyou'll need to add additional roles in.\n\n387\n00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.491\nIf your particular project, actually,\n\n388\n00:22:07.491 --> 00:22:10.348\nis more technically specific\nto something that you do.\n\n389\n00:22:10.348 --> 00:22:13.609\nWell, you'll find out that there may\nactually be additional roles that\n\n390\n00:22:13.609 --> 00:22:16.612\nyou actually have that help to\ncontrol things a little bit better.\n\n391\n00:22:16.612 --> 00:22:20.330\nOr help to guide you along a little bit\nmore and you'll depend on them as well.\n\n392\n00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.680\nAnd it also of course depends on\nthe way that your company is set up for\n\n393\n00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.550\nhow projects take place.\n\n394\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.080\nYou name it,\nyou're gonna see that as well.\n\n395\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.240\nNow, as far as all these roles go,\njust remember that not everything\n\n396\n00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.190\nalways ends up being a name and title role\neven though functionally they're that way.\n\n397\n00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.530\nAnd what I mean by that is that you\nmight find out like in a small company\n\n398\n00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.770\nnobody says that there's\na project actually even going on.\n\n399\n00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.620\nI know that's weird,\nthat they don't officially name a product.\n\n400\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.652\nThey may not even officially\nname a project manager, but\n\n401\n00:22:51.652 --> 00:22:55.103\nthe roles just tend to fit\nin the way that they do.\n\n402\n00:22:55.103 --> 00:22:58.954\nAnd you become this kind of\nvirtualized project in itself and\n\n403\n00:22:58.954 --> 00:23:03.046\nthe only thing that happens is\ntasks are essentially assigned.\n\n404\n00:23:03.046 --> 00:23:06.410\nAnd you're working on that project and\nyou just don't even feel like,\n\n405\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:07.714\nthat it's a real project.\n\n406\n00:23:07.714 --> 00:23:13.316\nBut it can happen without any real titles\ngoing on, or even documentation at times.\n\n407\n00:23:13.316 --> 00:23:15.112\nSo it is possible.\n\n408\n00:23:15.112 --> 00:23:16.068\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie yeah,\n\n409\n00:23:16.068 --> 00:23:20.148\nlike you mentioned earlier I think you\nreally hit the nail on the head when you\n\n410\n00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:23.676\nsaid over time your teams are really\ngonna get to know each other.\n\n411\n00:23:23.676 --> 00:23:26.640\nAnd work together more as a unit\nrather than individually.\n\n412\n00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.810\nSo I think that's where\nyou'll start to notice that.\n\n413\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll see that especially\non those teams as things start\n\n414\n00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.450\nto work in that way.\n\n415\n00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.340\nBut in those companies that really say,\n\n416\n00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:40.240\nlook we don't separate out into project\nmanagement teams and we don't do that.\n\n417\n00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.150\nIs it good that they do?\n\n418\n00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.970\nYes, and you might be wondering why?\n\n419\n00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:48.040\nWell, remember that not everybody's\ngonna be there at every time.\n\n420\n00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.188\nAnd so you might find that during\nthe life of that particular company, or\n\n421\n00:23:52.188 --> 00:23:57.089\nduring your particular life cycle at that\ncompany, that things change constantly.\n\n422\n00:23:57.089 --> 00:24:00.648\nWell, if somebody isn't officially\nassigned these types of roles,\n\n423\n00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:02.649\nespecially with project management.\n\n424\n00:24:02.649 --> 00:24:05.043\nIt's difficult for\na new person to come in and\n\n425\n00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:07.752\nunderstand where is this\nauthority coming from and\n\n426\n00:24:07.752 --> 00:24:12.550\nwhy am I supposed to be doing this and\nhow am I supposed to function in this way.\n\n427\n00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.290\nSo if your company does have that ability,\nor\n\n428\n00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.210\nwhoever's working, to setup some type of\nformalized type of project management,\n\n429\n00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.640\nit's gonna be better for\nanybody that comes in that works with you.\n\n430\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.600\nIf they don't, well,\nit's not that is impossible to do it,\n\n431\n00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.390\nit's always been done and always probably\nwill still continue to be done, but\n\n432\n00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.560\noverall it just makes a little bit more\ndifficult when they don't understand\n\n433\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.080\nwhy the big time push, why do we\nhave to do it in this bigger budget?\n\n434\n00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.808\nWhat's going on here?\n\n435\n00:24:39.808 --> 00:24:42.990\nAll that it's just because of the way\nthat we kind of functionally work in\n\n436\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:48.090\nthe project ourselves and we don't ever\nthink about formally naming these things.\n\n437\n00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:51.490\nAnd so you'll see, to tell you\nthe truth it kinda boils down to\n\n438\n00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.820\neven something like the show\nthat we are doing right now.\n\n439\n00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.610\nThe very fact is, it's a show,\nit's based around the certification,\n\n440\n00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.800\nif I sit there and look at it,\nwe didn't call it a project but\n\n441\n00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.240\nit comes down to a project, is what\nwe're actually working on right now and\n\n442\n00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.140\nmaking sure that we deliver\nthe information that we need to.\n\n443\n00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.180\nMaking sure that the show\nwas as good as possible.\n\n444\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.040\nIt's all about what we do right now.\n\n445\n00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.470\nBut we didn't never call it a project.\n\n446\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:18.990\nI didn't assign Cherokee\nas a project manager.\n\n447\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.755\n&gt;&gt; No, but\nwhat you've told us from before,\n\n448\n00:25:20.755 --> 00:25:23.235\nit's technically a project\nbecause we do have a timeline,\n\n449\n00:25:23.235 --> 00:25:26.805\nwe have a set number of episodes that\nwe're going to cover this content, but\n\n450\n00:25:26.805 --> 00:25:32.175\ncumulatively if we incorporate it into all\nof the course library within ITPro.TV,\n\n451\n00:25:32.175 --> 00:25:34.625\nwould that be considered a program?\n\n452\n00:25:34.625 --> 00:25:38.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually does end up being\na program, because what ends up happening\n\n453\n00:25:38.175 --> 00:25:42.590\nnow is that people can access it the same\nway, they can use it over and over again\n\n454\n00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:47.870\nto help them to achieve their goal inside\nof the CompTIA certification realm.\n\n455\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.200\nSo just kind of realize that a lot\nof these things do end up happening,\n\n456\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.535\nwhether it's ad hoc, just like what I\nwas telling you about as an example,\n\n457\n00:25:55.535 --> 00:25:57.550\nof like our show right now.\n\n458\n00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.660\nSo, you know, it's like I said,\nI didn't say Cherokee,\n\n459\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.600\nyou're the project coordinator here,\nI didn't tell her to schedule it, I didn't\n\n460\n00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.220\ndo that, it's just our assigned roles in\nwhat we do inside of our company, then\n\n461\n00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.610\nwe ended up saying, hey, here's the show\nthat we're gonna do and we call it a show.\n\n462\n00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.280\nI'm not exactly the project manager,\nbut you can kinda see where\n\n463\n00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.370\nyou just fall into the roles that you need\nto to make sure that everything gets done.\n\n464\n00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.935\nSo, some companies work well like that,\n\n465\n00:26:21.935 --> 00:26:24.810\nITPro.TV is actually one\nthat does that a lot.\n\n466\n00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.802\nAnd that's because we've worked together\nfor quite a long time, the majority of us.\n\n467\n00:26:28.802 --> 00:26:31.730\nCherokee is relatively new, but\nshe's worked around us enough.\n\n468\n00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.210\n&gt;&gt; I've known you guys for a long time.\n\n469\n00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's worked around us for\nquite a while, in that sense.\n\n470\n00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.510\nBut at the same time, it's because\nit's that nature and that idea and\n\n471\n00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.590\nwhat you will see in terms of teams and\nteam building, that we have this trust and\n\n472\n00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:47.870\nrespect enough to be able to do so\nand to trust each other to do it.\n\n473\n00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.860\nAnd so you will see that.\n\n474\n00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.290\nSo in everything that we said here,\nthis is all great exam material, right?\n\n475\n00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.300\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, we've covered,\n\n476\n00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.840\nwe've hit all the individual roles that\nCompTIA really want you to focus on.\n\n477\n00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.190\nRonnie, I think you did a great job there.\n\n478\n00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:04.710\nFor those of you at home,\nwe've got a lot more Project+ coming so\n\n479\n00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.670\nstay tuned for that.\n\n480\n00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.400\nThank you for joining us here.\n\n481\n00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.420\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n482\n00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.450\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n483\n00:27:09.450 -->

and\n\n10\n00:00:28.798 --> 00:00:30.460\nhelp identify some of those basics.\n\n11\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.290\nThank you Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.650\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.662\nAs we continue on with some of the CompTIA\nProject+ episodes here on this show.\n\n14\n00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:41.160\nWe want to take a look especially,\nabout the idea of cost control.\n\n15\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.700\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhy do we need center in on this.\n\n16\n00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.260\nWell remember that project management\nitself really revolves around\n\n17\n00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.020\nthree separate constraints.\n\n18\n00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.380\nOne of course is the requirements,\nthe other is time, and\n\n19\n00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.020\nthe third one is cost itself.\n\n20\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.220\nSo, we make sure that as project managers\nthat we are constantly on top of the cost\n\n21\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.630\nbecause if we don't what ends\nup happening is fairly simple.\n\n22\n00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.090\nThe project can quickly start to, again,\n\n23\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.320\nexceed how much we actually\nhad budgeted for it.\n\n24\n00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.456\nAnd when we talk about the idea of excess,\nwe're not talking about spending $10 or\n\n25\n00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:18.310\n$15 over what we thought\nthe project would be.\n\n26\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.650\nSometimes this turns into thousands of\ndollars, if not even more than that, and\n\n27\n00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.840\ntime starts slipping, and you name it.\n\n28\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.430\nSo keeping control of our cost\nis really going to be important.\n\n29\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.840\nAnd what we want to do here,\nespecially when we start taking a look at\n\n30\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.720\nthe CompTIA Project+ is that we\nwanna understand at least what\n\n31\n00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.410\nare some of those basic cost\ncontrols that we wanna keep in mind.\n\n32\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.930\nSo what do we normally need\nto determine when we start to\n\n33\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.570\nthink about something like this?\n\n34\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.670\nWell we wanna make sure that as we\nare overseeing and as we are managing,\n\n35\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.700\nof course,\nall the different project expenses.\n\n36\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.908\nAnd trying to do everything that we can\nto make sure that we're on top of it.\n\n37\n00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:04.010\nIs that we're really just trying to\ndetermine really one overall goal.\n\n38\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.395\nWhich, of course,\nis gonna be total project cost itself.\n\n39\n00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.502\nWhen I say that, what do I mean?\n\n40\n00:02:09.502 --> 00:02:15.200\nI mean accounting essentially for every\npenny that is spent upon that project.\n\n41\n00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.380\nWhether we're talking\nabout human resources or\n\n42\n00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.330\nwhether we're talking\nabout material resources.\n\n43\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.590\nWhether we are talking about of\ncourse equipment of some sort.\n\n44\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.610\nWe need to make sure to account for\nall of that and that that gets budgeted or\n\n45\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.940\nthat that actually gets, being able to\nhold accountable to the project itself.\n\n46\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.290\nBecause if not, it means that we don't\nhave a successful project as well.\n\n47\n00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n48\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.960\nIt's easy to go ahead and identify and\nsee how that budget is being allocated,\n\n49\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.900\nwhen we take the actual time to go\nahead and input that information.\n\n50\n00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.260\nBut it's kind of a big task, Ronnie.\n\n51\n00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.507\nSo how do we actually do that?\n\n52\n00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:54.680\nHow do we go ahead and make it easy on us?\n\n53\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.560\n&gt;&gt; Well as far as making it easy,\n\n54\n00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.990\nit depends of if you're already\ngood at managing money, right.\n\n55\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.820\nIt might be easier if\nyou're already good at it.\n\n56\n00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.340\nIf you're like me,\nthe easiest way I manage money is simple.\n\n57\n00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.370\nI think my wife gives me $25 at\nthe beginning of the week and\n\n58\n00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.120\nas long as I don't spend it I'm okay.\n\n59\n00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.960\nSo my own money is actually\nmanaged fairly easily.\n\n60\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.959\nBut I'm joking guys, don't go poor Ronnie.\n\n61\n00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.670\nBut just kinda take a look at it this way,\nright?\n\n62\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.670\nManaging the budget, okay,\nunderstanding that it does take time.\n\n63\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.010\nAnd it actually takes a bit\nmore preparation to plan and\n\n64\n00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.890\nprepare the entirety of the budget, okay.\n\n65\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.650\nBecause we do have things that will pop up\nduring the duration of the project that we\n\n66\n00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.960\nhaven't planned for, and\n\n67\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.940\nthose are potential risks that we\nactually have to worry about as well.\n\n68\n00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.705\nSo inside of project management, when you\nactually are taking a look at controlling,\n\n69\n00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:48.050\nof course, costs in doing this.\n\n70\n00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.850\nYou have to actually manage,\nand you have to plan, and\n\n71\n00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.000\nyou have to prepare for\nthese unforseen risks as well.\n\n72\n00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.080\nAnd other things that can happen\nsuch as delays in your project.\n\n73\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.280\nSuch as a piece of a equipment that was\nrenting for fairly cheap during the winter\n\n74\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.450\nnow during the summer months is actually\nhigher than what you expected to pay.\n\n75\n00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.660\nSo, there also, of course,\n\n76\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.350\ncan be unexpected expenditures\nthat are out there.\n\n77\n00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.950\nBut you start by beginning\nto manage the budget itself.\n\n78\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.630\nAnd so once you start to take a look\nat all that was assigned to you,\n\n79\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.720\nthis is where you start breaking\ndown that total project cost and\n\n80\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.390\nstart to try and key in on that.\n\n81\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.530\nNow, the way that we begin that really\nhelps us out, is that we start off with\n\n82\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.360\nessentially what we've actually\nplanned for the project, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.920\nAnd in project management terms, we call\nthat the project cost baseline itself.\n\n84\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.320\nSo let me show you an example of what\ntends to happen inside of a project, and\n\n85\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.900\nthis is how you tend to plan money out.\n\n86\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.740\nSo here on my computer I went ahead and\n\n87\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.620\nI created just kind of this\nlittle graph to help us out.\n\n88\n00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.525\nNotice that at the bottom I have the six\nphases of the project that we having going\n\n89\n00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:54.059\nthrough.\n\n90\n00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:59.369\nAnd instead of actually putting in really\nvalue amounts, such as the US dollar,\n\n91\n00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:03.770\nor Euro, or whatever it might\nbe that you actually work with.\n\n92\n00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.030\nI just started saying, hey look,\nlet's just talk about cost here.\n\n93\n00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.850\nThe single US dollar sign here,\nof course, being the most minimal.\n\n94\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.130\nVersus the highest cost that\nwe can have in our project.\n\n95\n00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.390\nAnd what you start to see\nhere is this green line or\n\n96\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.620\nlime green line that you see.\n\n97\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.700\nLet me see if I can make\nthat a little bit thicker so\n\n98\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.700\nit actually stands out\na little bit more in bold.\n\n99\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.080\nThere we go.\nThat's actually a little bit better, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.520\nSo, when you take a look at this,\n\n101\n00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.930\nyou're probably going,\nRonnie what am I looking at?\n\n102\n00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.500\nWell, in a project, right, you have\nto manage the money, not by saying\n\n103\n00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.970\nhere's the money that we have, so as long\nas I don't spend all of it I'm okay, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.100\nAt the very end of the project,\nI still have some left, I'm okay.\n\n105\n00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.100\nWell, the problem that we\nhave is as you noticed this,\n\n106\n00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.700\nthis is all going over time\non the horizontal axis here.\n\n107\n00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.740\nFrom the beginning to the end of\nthe project, is what we were seeing, so\n\n108\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.570\nthat takes time to accomplish.\n\n109\n00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.520\nNotice that what I'm actually showing\nyou here is that in the initiation and\n\n110\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.370\nin the planning phases, notice that\nthe curve right here is relatively flat.\n\n111\n00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.220\nNow I say relatively flat, but what am\nI saying when I am showing you this?\n\n112\n00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.940\nI am saying that the project, of course,\nas it continues to go on in time,\n\n113\n00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.850\nyou're gonna be expending money right?\n\n114\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.990\nSo it's gonna cost you something\nas you go through, and\n\n115\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.150\nin the planning phase it\nis not gonna cost a lot.\n\n116\n00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.780\nBut notice here at the beginning of\nthe execution phase somewhere around here,\n\n117\n00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.670\nnotice that it all of a sudden sky-rockets\nduring the execution phase and\n\n118\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.295\nthe monitoring phase, as well.\n\n119\n00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:38.790\nRemember those two really go hand in hand,\nand\n\n120\n00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.620\nwhat is that actually about then, when we\nstart taking a look at the cost base line?\n\n121\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.740\nIt means that we're actually\nplanning something like this.\n\n122\n00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.080\nWhere we go alright, we know that as\nfar as the money expenditure goes.\n\n123\n00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.620\nThe way that we're going to plan out\nthe expenditure of this money is\n\n124\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.530\nfairly simple.\n\n125\n00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.200\nAt the beginning,\nwe're not going to actually spend as much.\n\n126\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.654\nAnd notice here towards the end,\nat the closing and the training,\n\n127\n00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:02.915\nnotice it levels off again.\n\n128\n00:07:02.915 --> 00:07:05.870\nIt's still at the highest levels,\nyou go why didn't that drop back down?\n\n129\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.570\nWell remember that over the duration of\nthe project you are spending that money.\n\n130\n00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.570\nSo by the end of that particular project\nthat should be the highest amount that you\n\n131\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.850\nhave that you spent overall.\n\n132\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.430\nBut it's during these phases it\nshould kind of level off and\n\n133\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.090\nyou'll see where it's kind of flatlined.\n\n134\n00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.580\nBut notice in the execution and\n\n135\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.690\nmonitoring this is essentially where\nyou actually realize something.\n\n136\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.490\nThat's where you need to make sure\nyou have the most money available,\n\n137\n00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.700\nthe most funds that are available for\nyour costs to take place.\n\n138\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.166\nAnd you want to make sure that\nyou plan out your costs in\n\n139\n00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:42.806\nthis particular way by first taking\na look at that cost baseline for us.\n\n140\n00:07:42.806 --> 00:07:47.161\nOkay, now when we talk about that, right,\nyou're saying, why is this plan so\n\n141\n00:07:47.161 --> 00:07:48.050\nimportant?\n\n142\n00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:54.059\nIt's important because we want to make\nsure that it's a comparison point for\n\n143\n00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:57.396\nus when we do start spending money, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:57.396 --> 00:08:01.753\nAnd that way we can track whether or not\nwe're going to Actually have enough money,\n\n145\n00:08:01.753 --> 00:08:06.050\nfor certain phases of our project and\nwhether we're not gonna have enough money,\n\n146\n00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.373\nfor certain phases too.\n\n147\n00:08:07.373 --> 00:08:12.000\nSo let me show you an example,\nof what I'm talking about there as well.\n\n148\n00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.302\nSo as we take a look, what I've now got\nis something a little bit different.\n\n149\n00:08:15.302 --> 00:08:16.752\nLet me make those lines thicker.\n\n150\n00:08:16.752 --> 00:08:19.660\nWhen I'm sitting here making it,\nI'm like yeah, that looks great.\n\n151\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.595\nBut then when I look at it on camera it's\nlike, that looks kind of weak and anemic.\n\n152\n00:08:22.595 --> 00:08:24.883\nSo let me kind of compare those two.\n\n153\n00:08:24.883 --> 00:08:27.970\nThen we'll kind of, there we go.\n\n154\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.200\nThat'll make then kind of about even.\n\n155\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.896\nNow Cherokee notice,\nI pretty much have the same slide,\n\n156\n00:08:33.896 --> 00:08:36.060\non the green lie that I have here.\n\n157\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.810\nSo that's what I had\noriginally planned out.\n\n158\n00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.926\nBut as I started spending money,\n\n159\n00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:45.320\nnotice here in the initiation\nplanning looks just about identical?\n\n160\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.042\nIt seems to have gone\njust about hand in hand.\n\n161\n00:08:48.042 --> 00:08:52.787\nBut now I notice that during\nthe beginning of the execution phase,\n\n162\n00:08:52.787 --> 00:08:57.885\nmine actually rose a little bit ahead\nof the actual cost baseline here.\n\n163\n00:08:57.885 --> 00:09:00.348\nSo what do you think that that means,\n\n164\n00:09:00.348 --> 00:09:06.090\nwhen you start seeing it kind of rise up\nfaster than what the cost baseline was.\n\n165\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.240\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, that spike may be indicative of\nperhaps an unforeseen, expense or cost.\n\n166\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you start to take a look at,\nif it's something unexpected,\n\n167\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.020\nwhat you might see that, even though\nI actually planned it to go this way.\n\n168\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.340\nThat somewhere right at the beginning,\n\n169\n00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.790\nI ended up having to expend a little\nbit more money faster than I thought.\n\n170\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.900\nAnd now all of a sudden,\n\n171\n00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.080\nthe budget actually took off on\nthis particular curve instead.\n\n172\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.420\nBut notice that it evened\nout sooner though.\n\n173\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.520\nSo what I actually thought\nI had planned for,\n\n174\n00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.920\nwhich was this kind of,\nI knew that the costs were going to rise.\n\n175\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.920\nCuz normally what happens\nat the beginning,\n\n176\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.770\nof some type of execution phase that\nwe have of a particular work package.\n\n177\n00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.500\nYou tend to buy equipment.\n\n178\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.080\nYou tend to have everybody on hand, that\nyou need to get everything started and\n\n179\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.030\nmake sure everything is on task.\n\n180\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.596\nSo you tend to have expenditures,\nbut I kind of didn't account for\n\n181\n00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:00.661\nthe very fact that,\nI expended a lot more than I thought.\n\n182\n00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:05.189\nBut notice that that allowed me\nnow at some particular point where\n\n183\n00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:06.929\nthe project evened off.\n\n184\n00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:09.564\nAnd notice that at this\npoint even during part way,\n\n185\n00:10:09.564 --> 00:10:12.704\nthrough the execution in controlling or\nmonitoring phase.\n\n186\n00:10:12.704 --> 00:10:17.260\nIt kind of leveled off, all the way\nthrough the remainder of my project.\n\n187\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.950\nSo that way,\nwe can keep track of things like that.\n\n188\n00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.830\nAnd we can compare, whether or\n\n189\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.900\nnot we're actually taking a look\nat the total cost of the project.\n\n190\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.467\nMaking sure that we account for\nall the payments, that we're going now and\n\n191\n00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:30.354\nall the expenditures,\nthat we're actually having.\n\n192\n00:10:30.354 --> 00:10:34.384\nAnd seeing that, and that way as we start\nto do this, and we're starting to count\n\n193\n00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:38.318\nalong, and starting to make that curve\nhappen, as we're starting to see it.\n\n194\n00:10:38.318 --> 00:10:41.893\nWe can make adjustments as we need to,\nor actually try and\n\n195\n00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:44.800\nfigure out what it is that's causing.\n\n196\n00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.530\nSomething like this to go on.\n\n197\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.670\n&gt;&gt; This is really nice,\nbecause not only does it give us the full\n\n198\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.640\noverview of how much was spent, but\nyou can also see here when it was spent.\n\n199\n00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.032\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at least to the most\nbasic point right now.\n\n200\n00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.841\nIf you're actually managing the project.\n\n201\n00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:00.994\nIn other words, if you have somebody\nthat's actually doing this,\n\n202\n00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.296\nan accountant that's working for you.\n\n203\n00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:05.113\nThey'll keep you on board with\nthis if you tell them, hey look,\n\n204\n00:11:05.113 --> 00:11:06.324\nhere's what we need to do.\n\n205\n00:11:06.324 --> 00:11:10.580\nAnd they start saying this, they'll go\nahead and send up a red flag for you, so\n\n206\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.960\nthat you know.\n\n207\n00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.680\nWait a minute, this is what's gonna\nhappen and you might be wondering like,\n\n208\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.650\nwhy does it matter?.\n\n209\n00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.226\nCuz it, even out in the end.\n\n210\n00:11:17.226 --> 00:11:20.978\nBut remember that, what this might mean\na little bit later on if I actually used,\n\n211\n00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:22.810\nspent too much money at the beginning.\n\n212\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.719\nWell what about those\nparticular work packages,\n\n213\n00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:29.020\nthat are toward the end\nof the project itself?\n\n214\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.770\nI might find out something,\nthat I spent so\n\n215\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.450\nmuch money at the beginning,\nit didn't matter.\n\n216\n00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.240\nThat even though I had planned for\n\n217\n00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.660\nthe cost to continue to go up,\nit evened out before I actually needed to.\n\n218\n00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.900\nWhere I said it's not because I wanted to,\n\n219\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.380\nI just don't have any\nmoney to do anything else.\n\n220\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.060\nWhere I have to just level it off, and\n\n221\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.760\nin that particular sense overall that\nmeans I might not meet a requirement.\n\n222\n00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.960\nOr I took a few shortcuts or\nwhatever it might be,\n\n223\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.480\nwhere I said I need to start\ncutting costs now to do that.\n\n224\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.390\nSo hopefully, you actually are taking a\nlook and that when we start talking about,\n\n225\n00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.570\nmanaging and controlling the costs.\n\n226\n00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.290\nA cost baseline,\nis something that really does help us out.\n\n227\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.780\nBecause we can track that,\nfrom the very beginning.\n\n228\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.140\nAnd then as we actually start to see it.\n\n229\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.430\nWe can now start making adjustments,\nthe way that we need to.\n\n230\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.820\nTo ensure that we have everything that\nwe need, as far as getting that up and\n\n231\n00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.510\nrunning, as well.\n\n232\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.020\nNow the other thing that\nwe also need to talk about,\n\n233\n00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.870\nso this is kind of\nthe big picture overview.\n\n234\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.460\nIs that we really need to be good,\nat tracking expenditures.\n\n235\n00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.480\nExpenditures can get a little\nbit out of hand and I know,\n\n236\n00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.580\nI'm the worst at this idea itself.\n\n237\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.470\nSo, I hold on to my old car and\nI repair it for as long as I can.\n\n238\n00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.660\nBut, there does come a point\nin which all those repairs,\n\n239\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.490\nequal up to more than\nthe value of the car.\n\n240\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.860\nThat's the kind of car I really own.\n\n241\n00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.312\nThat literally the repairs come out to be\nmore than the car's actually worth a lot\n\n242\n00:12:55.312 --> 00:12:56.250\nof times.\n\n243\n00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.310\nSo, there comes a point and time in which.\n\n244\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.770\nI didn't think and\nsee it that way, because why?\n\n245\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.500\nI wasn't keeping track of\nthe expenses over time.\n\n246\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.699\nI look at it as being, what's $50 here,\nwhat's a couple of hundred dollars here,\n\n247\n00:13:08.699 --> 00:13:11.918\nwhat's just a few hundred\nmore every once in a while.\n\n248\n00:13:11.918 --> 00:13:14.849\nAnd then after that particular\namount of time, I start to look at\n\n249\n00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:18.072\nall the expenses like, I can't\nbelieve I spent that much on that car.\n\n250\n00:13:18.072 --> 00:13:20.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not worth that much money.\n\n251\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.910\nWell, the same thing can\nhappen with a project as well.\n\n252\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.800\nSo expenditure tracking, is one of the\nbiggest things that we can actually do.\n\n253\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.680\nBecause it’s something that we\nreally need to do especially if\n\n254\n00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.450\nwe’re actually limited by time,\nand by the cost itself.\n\n255\n00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:41.190\nSo it's not enough just to know, that we\nhave an amount of money that we can spend.\n\n256\n00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.482\nIt's not enough just to go,\nI haven't spent what I've been allocated.\n\n257\n00:13:45.482 --> 00:13:50.367\nYou need to make sure that you\nknow when the expenses occur,\n\n258\n00:13:50.367 --> 00:13:53.596\nso that toward the end of your project.\n\n259\n00:13:53.596 --> 00:13:57.021\nYou're not out of money for future\nexpenditures, that are actually there.\n\n260\n00:13:57.021 --> 00:14:00.631\nSo it's very possible that\nyou will end up seeing.\n\n261\n00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:04.365\nThat if you don't keep track of these\nexpenses over the period of time,\n\n262\n00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:06.741\nyou might end up at the end,\ngo wait a minute.\n\n263\n00:14:06.741 --> 00:14:10.779\nJust two weeks ago Cherokee,\nwe had this much money.\n\n264\n00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:15.296\nAnd then Cherokee goes, yeah, here's these\nexpenses that I should've turned in.\n\n265\n00:14:15.296 --> 00:14:17.165\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like James says, a money pit.\n\n266\n00:14:17.165 --> 00:14:20.881\nSo, it's not difficult to go ahead,\nand analyze,\n\n267\n00:14:20.881 --> 00:14:23.930\nand identify, where your money is going.\n\n268\n00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.940\nThere are a lot of different tools,\n\n269\n00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.140\nespecially even pie graphs are great,\npie charts are great for that.\n\n270\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.160\nSo you can use colors, and\n\n271\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.280\nyou're like look there's the little,\nthe car section of my circle there.\n\n272\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now expenditure tracking\nreally is where accountants come in,\n\n273\n00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.820\nthe people that love to crunch numbers.\n\n274\n00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.940\nThey're really good at\nthis to help you go,\n\n275\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.560\nlook Ronnie, don't get me wrong,\nhere's how much money you had,\n\n276\n00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.650\nbut this is what's happening right\nnow is I'm showing that on the track.\n\n277\n00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.550\nIn other words, of whatever curve\nthat they were measuring off,\n\n278\n00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.240\nthat you're spending too\nmuch money too fast.\n\n279\n00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.570\nNow, let's take a look at this and\nwe'll talk about that idea in a moment.\n\n280\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.595\nSo, what we're actually taking a look at\nhere, is that this actually works as long\n\n281\n00:15:06.595 --> 00:15:09.079\nas everything is coming in\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n282\n00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:11.932\nSo, the problem that we have\nwith something like this,\n\n283\n00:15:11.932 --> 00:15:13.456\neven in the actual spending.\n\n284\n00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:18.900\nIs that we don't know if everybody, is\nreporting the information that they need.\n\n285\n00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.800\nSo it could be that example,\nthat I just talked about right here.\n\n286\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.150\nThe very fact is everything looks good,\nuntil now the accountant says,\n\n287\n00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.960\neverything's great.\n\n288\n00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:33.480\nBut now, he says, Cherokee hasn't turned\nin her expenditures, for two weeks.\n\n289\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.758\nWell, now all of the sudden,\nit becomes a little bit more challenging,\n\n290\n00:15:36.758 --> 00:15:40.013\nbecause that means I don't really\nknow where I am in terms of expenses.\n\n291\n00:15:40.013 --> 00:15:42.378\nSo this particular line right here,\n\n292\n00:15:42.378 --> 00:15:46.270\ncould actually be higher at one\nplace than I actually think,\n\n293\n00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.639\nand that means I spent more money,\nat one particular point in time.\n\n294\n00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:54.750\nThan I really need to, and that might\nactually end up hurting a little bit out.\n\n295\n00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.590\nHere, as we're trying to finish\nup some of those projects too.\n\n296\n00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.007\nSo we really need to make sure\nthat the expenditure reports,\n\n297\n00:16:02.007 --> 00:16:03.817\nfrom our people that actually.\n\n298\n00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:07.319\nAuthorize to do expenditures,\nright, are actually coming in.\n\n299\n00:16:07.319 --> 00:16:10.750\nAnd it's a very important process\nto ensure that all this works and\n\n300\n00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.920\nflows in the way that we want to.\n\n301\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.424\nIf we have a very tight budget and\na very tight timeline and\n\n302\n00:16:16.424 --> 00:16:20.074\nyou have to actually set that\nup to where to tell the people,\n\n303\n00:16:20.074 --> 00:16:22.848\nthese expenses need to be turned in daily,\nor\n\n304\n00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:27.538\nthey need to be turned in at the beginning\nof the week, whatever it might be.\n\n305\n00:16:27.538 --> 00:16:31.987\n&gt;&gt; Or perhaps if you have a limit for\napprovals, say, anything over $200,\n\n306\n00:16:31.987 --> 00:16:34.256\nit needs to have so and so's approval.\n\n307\n00:16:34.256 --> 00:16:36.133\nSo that you don't have any surprises.\n\n308\n00:16:36.133 --> 00:16:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's actually a great point to make.\n\n309\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.060\nSo, you might go ahead and\n\n310\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.010\njust set a trigger here where,\nif you need to do this, then do that.\n\n311\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:47.700\nBut, overall though, whatever it is\nthat reporting has to go on, okay?\n\n312\n00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.330\nNow, I was just mentioning\nwhat can happen though is,\n\n313\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.260\nonce you actually figure this out, right?\n\n314\n00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.640\nYou might find out that what really helps\nyou out here is something that's going to\n\n315\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.370\nshow you whether you're actually\nspending money at a normal rate or\n\n316\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.130\nwhether you're spending it too fast or\nwhether you're spending it too slow.\n\n317\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.271\nYou might go,\ncan we possibly spend it too slow?\n\n318\n00:17:06.271 --> 00:17:06.907\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH ]\n\n319\n00:17:06.907 --> 00:17:08.003\n&gt;&gt; You possibly can,\n\n320\n00:17:08.003 --> 00:17:10.819\nbecause it can also show\na few different things.\n\n321\n00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:14.925\nSo, let me kind of show you at least\nsome different definitions that we have\n\n322\n00:17:14.925 --> 00:17:16.370\nto point out here, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.240\nThere is something in project management\nthat we call a Burn Rate, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.690\nNow, this is different, we're gonna\ntalk about agile methodology in\n\n325\n00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.970\na couple of episodes from now,\nwhere you're gonna hear the term,\n\n326\n00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:33.630\nthe idea here of the story burn,\nor something like that.\n\n327\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.460\nBut this is not the same as that,\nthat's called a burn down,\n\n328\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.390\nis what that one's called.\n\n329\n00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.440\nThis is called a Burn Rate, so, I wanna\nmake sure that we don't confuse those,\n\n330\n00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.670\nbecause they are two different things,\nokay?\n\n331\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:48.230\nThe idea of the Burn Rate, you don't\nhave to memorize these formulas so\n\n332\n00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.390\nmuch here, but you do need to\nunderstand what we're talking about.\n\n333\n00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:57.186\nThe very fact is what can happen\nis that the actual expenditures\n\n334\n00:17:57.186 --> 00:18:01.990\nactually might be higher than\nwhat we have planned for.\n\n335\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.530\nSo, we normally take something what's\ncalled the actual cost, which is AC here,\n\n336\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.940\nand then the Earned Value which is,\nof course, the expected value,\n\n337\n00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.130\nhow much we're expecting that we've\nspent at this particular point.\n\n338\n00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.290\nSo, when we do a ratio\nof those two things,\n\n339\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.600\nwhat we might end up seeing here\nis what we call the Burn Rate.\n\n340\n00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.480\nSo, when we do that ratio here,\nand we get a greater than one,\n\n341\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.960\nit normally tells you right away that,\nat this particular point,\n\n342\n00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:35.350\nthe budget is being spent faster than\noriginally planned, but notice that I\n\n343\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:41.250\nonly call it an indicator that\nthe project may finish over the budget.\n\n344\n00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.480\nSo, it is very possible.\n\n345\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.430\nIt doesn't always mean that, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.700\nIt means, at that point in time,\nit looks like that it may.\n\n347\n00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:52.350\nNotice if it's less than one, it means\nthat it may finish under the budget,\n\n348\n00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:57.580\ncuz it means you're spending the money\nslower than you possibly can as well,\n\n349\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.760\nthen it's there.\n\n350\n00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.960\nAnd so, at this point, it may finish\nunder budget, it's always a possibility.\n\n351\n00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.720\nIf it equals to one, that means it's\nbeing spent originally as planned, and\n\n352\n00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.510\nshould finish on budget as well, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.236\nSo, those are the ideas that\nwe need to keep in mind.\n\n354\n00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:15.985\nNow, Cherokee, normally when I think\nabout this because of, really,\n\n355\n00:19:15.985 --> 00:19:19.932\nthe way that I manage my money,\nunder budget always sounds better, right?\n\n356\n00:19:19.932 --> 00:19:23.795\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm looking at this diagram,\nand I'm just learning,\n\n357\n00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:28.027\nI'm, my checking account is probably\nBurn Rate greater than two.\n\n358\n00:19:28.027 --> 00:19:28.580\n&gt;&gt; Greater than two.\n\n359\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK].\n\n360\n00:19:29.261 --> 00:19:30.736\nThat's a little high, yeah.\n\n361\n00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:34.384\nThat means you spent the money, and now\nyou're trying to account for it somehow.\n\n362\n00:19:34.384 --> 00:19:37.216\nYeah [LAUGH] so, so at this point,\nyou can see some of that.\n\n363\n00:19:37.216 --> 00:19:41.320\nSo, let me show you an example here then,\nof how this works out.\n\n364\n00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.840\nSo, let me go ahead and do this.\n\n365\n00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.020\nI'm gonna use simple numbers,\nbecause well, that's me here.\n\n366\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.290\nSo, normally you might see these two\nas being the formulas, the bottom\n\n367\n00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:55.228\none is probably what you'll see more\noften, top one, that's probably more of\n\n368\n00:19:55.228 --> 00:20:00.960\nthe PMBOK idea here, where you just take\none divided by the Cost Performance Index.\n\n369\n00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.340\nWell, how do you get\nthe Cost Performance Index?\n\n370\n00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.450\nActual cost divided by the Earned Value,\nokay?\n\n371\n00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.432\nSo, let's say that you get Earned Value,\nand you get the actual cost here.\n\n372\n00:20:10.432 --> 00:20:12.314\nI just put $50,000 in US dollars,\n\n373\n00:20:12.314 --> 00:20:14.696\nas far as what I was expecting\nto spend at that point.\n\n374\n00:20:14.696 --> 00:20:17.717\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, when you say earned value,\nare you saying,\n\n375\n00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:21.074\nwould that be equivalent to a ROI,\nor a return on investment?\n\n376\n00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:22.145\n&gt;&gt; Not yet.\n\n377\n00:20:22.145 --> 00:20:22.834\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n378\n00:20:22.834 --> 00:20:25.104\n&gt;&gt; So, this is actually just saying,\n\n379\n00:20:25.104 --> 00:20:28.746\nhere's how much we expected\nto spend up into this point.\n\n380\n00:20:28.746 --> 00:20:29.978\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; How much we believe,\n\n381\n00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:32.030\nfrom everything that we've done,\nhere it is.\n\n382\n00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:36.500\nHere's our earned value, here's what we've\nactually expended to that point, okay?\n\n383\n00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.250\nSo, then you go ahead and\nyou divide it up.\n\n384\n00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.780\nAnd there it is, I get 1.5, okay?\n\n385\n00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:46.140\nWell, if that's true, that actually tells\nme something here, that more than likely\n\n386\n00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.930\nI'm starting to head towards trouble\nas far as being an indicator,\n\n387\n00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.780\nthat I'm actually over budget\nat that point and time.\n\n388\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.283\nThat may not matter to you at this point,\nbut you might find out later on it does.\n\n389\n00:20:57.283 --> 00:20:59.362\nSo you go, I was expecting\nto see something like this.\n\n390\n00:20:59.362 --> 00:21:00.350\nNo big deal, but\n\n391\n00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:05.151\nif you actually have this figure show up\nand set up a point you're not expecting,\n\n392\n00:21:05.151 --> 00:21:10.200\nthat's when it gets a little bit more\ninto the dangerous area here, okay?\n\n393\n00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.049\nNow, when I was talking here about\nwhy this is very important is that,\n\n394\n00:21:14.049 --> 00:21:17.899\nbecause we planned everything out,\naccording to what we were talking\n\n395\n00:21:17.899 --> 00:21:20.859\nabout earlier here,\naccording to our project plan.\n\n396\n00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:23.536\nOop, let me see if I can zoom in again,\njust so\n\n397\n00:21:23.536 --> 00:21:25.801\nthat we can see this a little bit more.\n\n398\n00:21:25.801 --> 00:21:28.580\nTry it again, just a little bit, okay.\n\n399\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.200\nSo, just when we start to\ntake a look at this, okay?\n\n400\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.520\nBelieve it or not, doing the under\nthe budget, or the over the budget.\n\n401\n00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.260\nNeither of those two are actually\nreally good for us, okay?\n\n402\n00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.340\nAnd you might be wondering well,\n\n403\n00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.370\nwhy is coming in under budget\nnot a good thing, okay?\n\n404\n00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.900\nWell, it's not a good thing\nif you don't understand why\n\n405\n00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.790\nit hasn't come under budget.\n\n406\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.692\nOver budget can be caused by many things,\nright?\n\n407\n00:21:52.692 --> 00:21:56.332\nNormally, overexpending\nis really the big one.\n\n408\n00:21:56.332 --> 00:22:00.150\nIn other words, something actually costing\nmore than it should, at any point in time,\n\n409\n00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.505\nwhether a service, whether you had to\nhire more people, that's never a good\n\n410\n00:22:03.505 --> 00:22:06.938\nthing because it means you didn't account\nfor it the way that you needed to do.\n\n411\n00:22:06.938 --> 00:22:11.188\nBut under-expenditures,\nif you don't know why it happened,\n\n412\n00:22:11.188 --> 00:22:16.069\nmore than likely it means somebody has\nagain made this ad hoc decision away\n\n413\n00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:20.640\nfrom your project plan to say,\nyou wanna know something?\n\n414\n00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.930\nI don't care that Ronnie says I need\nto use a number six here, okay?\n\n415\n00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:28.190\nWe're gonna go with a number four instead,\nbecause it's behind the wall,\n\n416\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.800\nit doesn't matter.\n\n417\n00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.020\nNow, I don't care what\nyou're talking about,\n\n418\n00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.238\nbut just kinda think about it that way,\nright?\n\n419\n00:22:32.238 --> 00:22:37.530\nThey decided to do some\ncost savings there without\n\n420\n00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.540\nnotifying the project management\nteam that things have changed.\n\n421\n00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:45.246\nWell, what if that particular thing\nthat we're actually having to put number\n\n422\n00:22:45.246 --> 00:22:50.025\nsixes in requires that for load bearing,\nor requires it because it's actually\n\n423\n00:22:50.025 --> 00:22:53.187\nsome type of regulation that\nit needs to be in there.\n\n424\n00:22:53.187 --> 00:22:54.533\nWell now, what does that mean?\n\n425\n00:22:54.533 --> 00:22:57.460\nThat means, even though it\nactually came in under budget,\n\n426\n00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.400\nwe now have to go back to our project and\ndo what?\n\n427\n00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.640\nFix it.\n\n428\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.570\nWe literally have to tear that thing\nout again, put in the right stuff, and\n\n429\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.720\nnow we've expended twice\non that one thing.\n\n430\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.240\nAnd so, under budget may actually indicate\nthat either a corner was cut at some\n\n431\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.500\npoint, or it could indicate\nthat somebody's being really\n\n432\n00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.780\nefficient at everything that's going on.\n\n433\n00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.650\nBut usually, you plan for\nthese things, and\n\n434\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.690\nwhat you wanna find out is,\non either side, right?\n\n435\n00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.419\nWhether over budget or under budget,\n\n436\n00:23:26.419 --> 00:23:32.060\nthat everything is actually gonna be\njustified in some way, somehow, okay?\n\n437\n00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.762\nIdeally, everything should be on budget.\n\n438\n00:23:34.762 --> 00:23:38.943\nAnd so,\nthe Burn Rate helps us determine how\n\n439\n00:23:38.943 --> 00:23:43.250\nfast we're expending the money versus not.\n\n440\n00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.930\nSo, you wanna take a look at these and\nthese are, by far, the most basic things.\n\n441\n00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:50.920\nSo, let's go ahead and make sure that\nwe understand at least the four or\n\n442\n00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.050\nfive different things that we want to\nnormally have a control over, okay?\n\n443\n00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:59.460\nSo, as far as the basic cost,\nas far as your projects go, right?\n\n444\n00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.690\nWe wanna make sure that we know now to\ndetermine the overall total cost of\n\n445\n00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.470\nthe project, and this is how we\ndo it is by accounting for, well,\n\n446\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.090\nall the payments and\nall the expenditures of our project, okay?\n\n447\n00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:14.796\nAnd we need that at the very beginning\nto help us to determine our baseline,\n\n448\n00:24:14.796 --> 00:24:18.220\nabout when that cost is\nalso gonna be expended.\n\n449\n00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.637\nNormally, when you see this, as far as\nin a chart form, like I'm showing you,\n\n450\n00:24:21.637 --> 00:24:24.100\nyou'll always see that\nkind of s shaped graph.\n\n451\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.762\nBecause there's always\n\n452\n00:24:28.762 --> 00:24:33.646\na beginning which you're\n\n453\n00:24:33.646 --> 00:24:38.086\nnot spending a lot, but\n\n454\n00:24:38.086 --> 00:24:44.524\nthen during the execution phase,\n\n455\n00:24:44.524 --> 00:24:49.408\nit's always gonna kind of\n\n456\n00:24:49.408 --> 00:24:54.736\nangle up very suddenly, and\n\n457\n00:24:54.736 --> 00:25:00.064\nthen level off at the top, so\n\n458\n00:25:00.064 --> 00:25:05.836\nyou always see that idea of that\n\n459\n00:25:05.836 --> 00:25:11.608\nkind of s shaped graph as well,\n\n460\n00:25:11.608 --> 00:25:18.050\nor chart when you see it, okay?\n\n461\n00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:18.730\nAnd the key there,\n\n462\n00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:22.590\nof course, is making sure that we're\nright on budget as much as possible.\n\n463\n00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.655\nSo, there's a lot that goes on here,\n\n464\n00:25:24.655 --> 00:25:27.444\njust even in the most basic\nof our cost management.\n\n465\n00:25:27.444 --> 00:25:29.967\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you for\ngiving us those examples, Ronnie.\n\n466\n00:25:29.967 --> 00:25:31.752\nI think I was able to go ahead and\n\n467\n00:25:31.752 --> 00:25:36.286\nunderstand how to come up with my total\nproject cost by looking at my baseline,\n\n468\n00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:40.819\nand I did a find my budget, and then\nalso implementing expenditure tracking,\n\n469\n00:25:40.819 --> 00:25:45.421\nand even expenditure reporting, and\nof course, my favorite, the burn rate,\n\n470\n00:25:45.421 --> 00:25:49.590\nto help even identify if we're\nspending money at too rapid of a rate.\n\n471\n00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.840\nSo, thank you very much for that Ronnie,\nand thank you guys for joining us today.\n\n472\n00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.480\nStay tuned for some more great\nProject+ episodes coming this way.\n\n473\n00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.245\nSigning off, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n474\n00:26:00.245 --> 00:26:00.975\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

00:00:12.680\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.715\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\ngreat episode at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.005\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.959\nToday, we're gonna be diving further\ninto the fabulous world of Project +.\n\n7\n00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:26.740\nAnd we're gonna be looking at how to\nidentify team organizational structures.\n\n8\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.430\nWith us, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.980\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.270\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.350\nAs we continue on taking a look\nat more of the CompTIA Project+,\n\n12\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.250\nspecifically talking about these different\ntypes of organizational structures that we\n\n13\n00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.290\nhave in place that we have to learn how\nto deal with as we are project managers.\n\n14\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.070\nSometimes what you'll find out is that\nnot every organization is ready for\n\n15\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.140\na project to begin.\n\n16\n00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.120\nAnd that means that your particular\nrole may be a little bit different\n\n17\n00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.600\nthan the idea of what you might\nconsider what a project manager may be.\n\n18\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.046\nAnd so we want to make sure that you\nare at least familiar with where you might\n\n19\n00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:04.588\nfind yourself as being a project manager,\n\n20\n00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:07.574\nwithin these different\ntypes of organizations.\n\n21\n00:01:07.574 --> 00:01:12.045\nBecause it will help you understand what\nthe authority that you might have, and\n\n22\n00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:14.847\neven what your position\nis in the overall scheme,\n\n23\n00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:17.750\nof how that organization\nis actually built.\n\n24\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.860\nAnd then we wanna talk about some of the\nimpacts that we're actually going to end\n\n25\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.800\nup seeing, depending on that\nstructure that's actually in place.\n\n26\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.910\nSo, that is what we\nare going to take a look at.\n\n27\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.370\nSo, Cherokee, in terms of organizations,\nwhat we have to think about, of course,\n\n28\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.440\nis large organizations and of course,\nsmall organizations that are out there,\n\n29\n00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.250\nand talk about the structures\nthat are generally in place.\n\n30\n00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.690\nSo Cherokee, I know that you've actually\nworked for a bigger company in which\n\n31\n00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.900\nthere's actually been many different\nlevels of authority that's been there.\n\n32\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.950\nAnd I've really kind of have worked for\nkind of a medium company before,\n\n33\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.950\nbut never anything as big as\nmaybe what you've worked for.\n\n34\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.965\nDid you find the idea of\nactually having to work with so\n\n35\n00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:00.782\nmany different levels\na little bit challenging?\n\n36\n00:02:00.782 --> 00:02:05.156\n&gt;&gt; I think, that's a good question,\nbut I think it really depends\n\n37\n00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:09.947\non how your hierarchy,\nthat communication, is actually executed.\n\n38\n00:02:09.947 --> 00:02:13.367\nIt can be very difficult,\nif done properly,\n\n39\n00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:16.250\nthen it shouldn't be an issue at all.\n\n40\n00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.789\n&gt;&gt; None.\nYeah, I understand and\n\n41\n00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.170\nthat's what we all hope for.\n\n42\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.916\nBut the very fact is, exactly what\nyou said, it could be difficult,\n\n43\n00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:23.831\nit might not be.\n\n44\n00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:27.057\nBut it really is dependent upon how\nthat company was structured and\n\n45\n00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:29.591\nset up and\nespecially if project management is new,\n\n46\n00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:33.520\nyou might find out that there's a few\nmore challenges that are in place.\n\n47\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.940\nSo what we wanna do is make sure that\nyou understand the basics, the overall\n\n48\n00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.840\nmost general categories of organizational\nstructures that are in place.\n\n49\n00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.220\nAnd when we start dealing in\nterms of project management,\n\n50\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.530\nwe tend to see what we call\nfunctional types of organizations.\n\n51\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.380\nWe also tend to see what we call\nmatrixized organizations or\n\n52\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.990\nmatrix based organizations.\n\n53\n00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.840\nAnd then finally there is what we call\nprojectized type of organization as well.\n\n54\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.470\nAnd we're gonna break those down for us so\n\n55\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.640\nthat we understand some of\nthe fundamentals of some of the ins and\n\n56\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.560\nouts of what each of those means,\n\n57\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.560\nespecially compared to what you might\nbe familiar with as a project manager.\n\n58\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.347\nSo the first one, of course, let's take\nan example in a scenario like this,\n\n59\n00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:16.896\nin which a company that already\nhas everything in place.\n\n60\n00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:19.730\nThe function of a traditional\nstandard project,\n\n61\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.381\nnot a project excuse me,\na traditional standard company goes.\n\n62\n00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.128\nAnd then what they started to do was say,\nlook,\n\n63\n00:03:26.128 --> 00:03:28.900\nwe really need project managers, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.120\nWe really need to be able to turn some\nof the ways that we're doing things,\n\n65\n00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.870\ninto projects to make them\na little bit more streamlined.\n\n66\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.350\nOr because we wanna develop new products\nand this is where we have to ask\n\n67\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.760\nthe question where in the world\ndoes the project manager fit in?\n\n68\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.670\nSo let me show you kind of\nan organizational chart in which\n\n69\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.920\nyou might see when you start to\ntake a look at something like this.\n\n70\n00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.340\nSo let's take for an example here,\n\n71\n00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.120\nwe always talk about a functional\ntype of structure, okay.\n\n72\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.365\nWhat we tend to have, of course,\n\n73\n00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:57.909\nis when you take a look at\nit from the top from, okay.\n\n74\n00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.769\nFrom the CEO, even the chief executive\nofficer here may actually be\n\n75\n00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.946\nin charge of all of these\ndifferent departments over all,\n\n76\n00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:10.612\neach particular department unto itself,\nright,\n\n77\n00:04:10.612 --> 00:04:16.346\nis independently managed by whoever is\nactually at the top of that department.\n\n78\n00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:20.736\nAnd then they managed their own staff,\nthey manage everything they need to and\n\n79\n00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:25.500\nthey simply go ahead and they make reports\nback to the CEO, as well, to help us.\n\n80\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.130\nSo this hierarchy in nature by itself\n\n81\n00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.210\nactually tends to be a fairly\nsolid type of structure.\n\n82\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.180\nBecause now, as independent departments,\nright, notice that the human\n\n83\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.750\nresources here and their staff are not\ndependent upon the finances, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.630\nNor is the marketing dependent\nupon the production etc,\n\n85\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.740\nas we continue to go through here.\n\n86\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.368\nEvery department essentially can\nfunction on its own as a small kind of\n\n87\n00:04:51.368 --> 00:04:55.761\nindependent company by itself even\nthough it's serving the whole\n\n88\n00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:58.046\ncompany when we start to see this.\n\n89\n00:04:58.046 --> 00:05:02.801\nNow, notice that what I put up here in\nthe upper left hand corner though, okay.\n\n90\n00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:07.200\nSo if you already have an existing\ncompany, okay, well now, where in\n\n91\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.762\nthe world does the project manager\nfit into this particular structure?\n\n92\n00:05:11.762 --> 00:05:15.618\nWhen you start to see something like this,\noverall.\n\n93\n00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:20.957\nWell notice that they could actually\nend up being just another department.\n\n94\n00:05:20.957 --> 00:05:24.081\nWe can add them on the right hand side,\nI don't have no space to do it.\n\n95\n00:05:24.081 --> 00:05:27.996\nBut we could add them on the right\nhand side just as another tree,\n\n96\n00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:32.346\na branch that comes off underneath\nthe CEO as being a project manager and\n\n97\n00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:35.840\nthen he would actually have his own staff.\n\n98\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.140\nBut what does this actually do then,\nfor these other departments, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.070\nThey might actually start wondering well,\nwhat is he managing projects for?\n\n100\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.460\nA human resource person may actually\nbe able to see the value and need for\n\n101\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.400\nthe financial department, okay,\nmight actually see the value and need for\n\n102\n00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.027\nthe marketing.\n\n103\n00:05:53.027 --> 00:05:56.830\nProduction may see, hey,\nwe do need customer relations so\n\n104\n00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.230\nthat we can sell stuff.\n\n105\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.070\nWe do need marketing so\nthat they can sell stuff here.\n\n106\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.794\nBut overall though, okay,\nthey might not see the need for\n\n107\n00:06:04.794 --> 00:06:08.822\na project manager having his own\ndepartment and doing things.\n\n108\n00:06:08.822 --> 00:06:11.455\nBecause they don't know what\nhe's going to be working on or\n\n109\n00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:13.110\nshe's going going to be working on.\n\n110\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.520\nTo the point where they don't\nknow what's happening, okay.\n\n111\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.190\nSo in this sense,\npeople that end up working in this\n\n112\n00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.860\nparticular type of structure,\nthey have everything well established.\n\n113\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.766\nAnd it makes it easy for them, then,\nto stand out in their own department as\n\n114\n00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:31.867\nthey work and as they do things to\naccomplish whatever that department needs.\n\n115\n00:06:31.867 --> 00:06:35.041\nBut there's also, of course,\nsome other advantages too,\n\n116\n00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:37.290\nwhere not only can they actually stand up.\n\n117\n00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.420\nThey can actually make an entire\ncareer out of human resources or\n\n118\n00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.980\nout of the production or out of the\nmarketing department that you see here.\n\n119\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.524\nAnd so, those are things that you\nreally are able to make sure that if\n\n120\n00:06:48.524 --> 00:06:52.205\nsomebody is in this particular\norganization change.\n\n121\n00:06:52.205 --> 00:06:55.940\nIn other words, status quo is probably\nsomething that's fairly good, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.270\nBecause it means, what?\n\n123\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.700\nThey know exactly what has to be done so\nthat they don't rock the boat.\n\n124\n00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.300\nThey know exactly what has to\nbe done if they wanna stand out.\n\n125\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.415\nThey know exactly what needs to be\ndone here, and the they're not gonna\n\n126\n00:07:06.415 --> 00:07:09.435\nreally get in trouble by anybody\nelse's department as well.\n\n127\n00:07:09.435 --> 00:07:13.767\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and from that diagram I\ncould even see how that project manager\n\n128\n00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:17.232\nprobably has to have some\npretty good personal skills.\n\n129\n00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:22.820\nBecause you want to have that extra\nbuy in from those department heads.\n\n130\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.950\nAnd you don't wanna seem like\nyou're stepping on any toes.\n\n131\n00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.283\nSo you need to have good communications\nintra department with all those different\n\n132\n00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.109\ndepartments.\n\n133\n00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:35.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, you bring up a good concept\nthere, that we have to remember, okay.\n\n134\n00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.030\nSo as a project manager, your particular\nposition is probably not a department\n\n135\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.480\nhead, but\nyou're just called the project manager.\n\n136\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.640\nNow, what is it that every other\nparticular department head's gonna realize\n\n137\n00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.540\nabout a project manager?\n\n138\n00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.436\nThey're gonna realize that what the\nproject manager may need at times, right,\n\n139\n00:07:52.436 --> 00:07:55.183\nis a resource from their\ndepartment to work.\n\n140\n00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:59.001\nSo in other words, what you might find\nout as a project manager is that you're\n\n141\n00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:01.610\nactually requesting help from,\nlet's just do it.\n\n142\n00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.520\nI'm trying to figure out\nthe best way to do it.\n\n143\n00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.594\nYou're actually just requesting help from,\nlet's say,\n\n144\n00:08:06.594 --> 00:08:09.620\nthese three departments unto itself.\n\n145\n00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.870\nWell, if you're actually only doing that.\n\n146\n00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.930\nSo you, as a project manager,\nyou're saying, hey,\n\n147\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:19.300\nI need to go to those department heads and\nrequest a couple of people to help me out.\n\n148\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.640\nWell now, what does that particular\ndepartment head, might he actually think?\n\n149\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.430\nHe's just trying to pull\nsomebody away from my team.\n\n150\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.110\nSo now I'm going to be down at\nleast one person while they go and\n\n151\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.430\nwork on Cherokee's project.\n\n152\n00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.620\nAnd so I'm going to be shorthanded\nduring this point in time.\n\n153\n00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.350\nSo that can happen.\n\n154\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.050\nSo, Cherokee is right.\n\n155\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.310\nHe or\nshe has to be able to develop very good\n\n156\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.590\nsolid working relationships\nwith these other guys.\n\n157\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.930\nAnd I'm not saying it has to tiptoe, but\n\n158\n00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:53.490\nit needs to be able to understand the\ndynamics of these particular individuals\n\n159\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.250\nincredibly well in this\ntype of organization.\n\n160\n00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:03.380\nWithout that understanding, they will\nunintentionally step on people's feelings\n\n161\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.930\nand really get somebody kinda bent out off\nshape when the project manager walks in\n\n162\n00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.520\nand says, all right, so, I need you to\njust assign two people to me right now.\n\n163\n00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.302\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n164\n00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing my project and\n\n165\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.940\nI need two people from your department.\n\n166\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.510\nOnce again, why?\n\n167\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.780\nBecause I need them.\n\n168\n00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.180\nWhat more than likely,\nyou're gonna find that,\n\n169\n00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.970\nyou have to do a little bit\nmore explaining to do so.\n\n170\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.870\nSo, in a particular organization\nwhich everything is established,\n\n171\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.780\nit's very difficult for somebody to\nsay yeah that sounds great, okay.\n\n172\n00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.960\nIt really is, because they're used to\nthings working the way that they are, and\n\n173\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.720\nit's very easy, like I said for\n\n174\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.710\nthem to say status quo is\nhow we like things to be.\n\n175\n00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:48.070\nSo in this particular situation then,\na project manager has,\n\n176\n00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:54.240\nmore than anything here,\ndisadvantages that he has to work through.\n\n177\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.140\nOne of the great advantages, right,\nhopefully for a project manager,\n\n178\n00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.600\nis that he has good communication skills.\n\n179\n00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.710\nBut the other one, the big disadvantages\nactually come in different ways, right?\n\n180\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.550\nOne, your authority may be\nlimited as a project manager.\n\n181\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.590\nIn other words, you may not be able\nto go into the marketing guy and go,\n\n182\n00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.740\nalright, assign me one person right now.\n\n183\n00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.680\nAnd that particular marketing guy,\nwhoever the head is, or\n\n184\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.720\nwhoever she is says, you know something?\n\n185\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.805\nYou didn't even ask.\n\n186\n00:10:21.805 --> 00:10:24.180\n[LAUGH] You didn't even ask.\n\n187\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.480\nI'm just not even going to\npay attention to that and\n\n188\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.580\nyou don't have any real authority to say,\nI'm taking this guy.\n\n189\n00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.860\nThat kind of puts a dent\nin your particular project.\n\n190\n00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.460\nAt least I think it would,\nCherokee, right?\n\n191\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you can't get resources,\n\n192\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.580\nwhat are the chances of you\nfinishing that project.\n\n193\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.510\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, maybe you could go ahead\nand implement some sort of documentation\n\n194\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.450\nthat needs to be submitted and\nthat's just part of your regular process.\n\n195\n00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.440\nSo that's something they'd\nbecome to expect and\n\n196\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.560\nyou get in the habit of doing that so you\ndon't encounter these kind of situations.\n\n197\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and what is the chances of that\nparticular type of documentation getting\n\n198\n00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.855\nlost on the actual department head's desk?\n\n199\n00:10:59.855 --> 00:11:01.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fairly good.\n\n200\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.910\nLet's just put it that way.\n\n201\n00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.380\nNow I'm joking about that by far but-\n&gt;&gt; CC the boss.\n\n202\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.550\n&gt;&gt; You'd have to actually\nstart doing that, and\n\n203\n00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.000\nonce you start doing that\nguess what starts to happen?\n\n204\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.470\nDoors start closing again because\nnow you're not working through what?\n\n205\n00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.960\nThe process that has always been\nestablished, you're not even taking\n\n206\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.100\nthe time to learn about who these\npeople are and exactly what's going on.\n\n207\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.870\nSo, there are disadvantages.\n\n208\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.830\nYour authority might be equal to theirs\nbut it's not ever going to be where\n\n209\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.730\nthe CEO says whatever\nthe project manager needs right?\n\n210\n00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.230\nYou better give it to him.\n\n211\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.260\nIt might not be that.\n\n212\n00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.600\nAnd the reason why is the CEO also has to\nwork with these people even though he's in\n\n213\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.750\ncharge, he still has to realize that,\nall it takes is for\n\n214\n00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.450\none particular department head to say,\n\n215\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.440\nI've been here longer than you, and\nthis is what's gonna happen really.\n\n216\n00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.880\nAnd you might go, no that situation would\nnever happen, but they don't have to\n\n217\n00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.340\nalways be the one that's actually the guy\nthat's always anti whatever the CEO wants.\n\n218\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.870\nAll they have to do is just put in\na few road blocks along the way, and\n\n219\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.510\nthey can actually kind of be a little\nmore headache than we think.\n\n220\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.760\nSo in this sense,\nsome of those disadvantages,\n\n221\n00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.450\nreally at the very beginning here\nmay be of limited authority.\n\n222\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.750\nThe other thing that you might find\nout is actually just the opposite.\n\n223\n00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.110\nLet's go back to by diagram here just for\na moment.\n\n224\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.420\nSo I can point this out.\n\n225\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.390\nSo let's say what starts to happen is\nCEO announces to his entire company,\n\n226\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.860\nespecially the department heads here,\nokay.\n\n227\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.890\nHe says we're hiring a project manager to\nwork on projects, now that sounds cool,\n\n228\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:38.050\neverybody's actually on board\nwith that because what did now\n\n229\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.930\nthe marketing head realize?\n\n230\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.660\nI've got six projects that I really\nneed accomplished here, okay.\n\n231\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.520\nThe production team goes, there's at least\ntwo projects that actually need done,\n\n232\n00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.000\nand great, because this guy\nhas project manager skills,\n\n233\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.610\nhe can help me get that done here.\n\n234\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.680\nCustomer relations may actually go up.\n\n235\n00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.560\nHere's a project that\nreally needs to be done for\n\n236\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.070\nus to be able to actually reach our\ncustomers, yeah, don't hit your customers,\n\n237\n00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.050\nto be able to reach our customers\na little bit more effectively.\n\n238\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.550\nAnd now we actually have a project\nmanager that has, you hate to say,\n\n239\n00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.270\ntoo many projects to actually\ndeal with at one time.\n\n240\n00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.330\nSo when you select one or\nthe other, guess what?\n\n241\n00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.320\nThat may become a personal\nissue between those heads.\n\n242\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.380\nLike, why did you choose\nmarketing over productions?\n\n243\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.150\nWhy did you do that?\n\n244\n00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.760\n&gt;&gt; I think something that could help\nthere, Ronnie, is if you go ahead and\n\n245\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.860\nattach some kind of\nfinancial aspect to it.\n\n246\n00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:35.460\nA lot of times that helps provides\nsome kind of quantification for\n\n247\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.550\nwhich project have precedent\nin a triage situation.\n\n248\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.790\n&gt;&gt; Well, you really do hope\nthat's what would happen, right?\n\n249\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.960\nAnd but sometimes, you don't have\nthat particular luxury because,\n\n250\n00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.650\nwhat you also find out and\nyou realize, is that even though\n\n251\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.000\nyou get these particular people\nthat want these projects, and\n\n252\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.440\nthey're saying I'm willing to let you\nhave these two people for your project.\n\n253\n00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.010\nThose two people are probably not gonna\nbe fully 100% dedicated to that project,\n\n254\n00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.350\nthey're still going to\nbe required to do what?\n\n255\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.760\nTo get their own work done inside of that\nparticular functional structure instead.\n\n256\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.020\nSo they're splitting their time, they're\nsplitting the actual overall resources,\n\n257\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.600\nand you're having to deal with\nless than you think as far as\n\n258\n00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.000\nthe resources that are on hand for\nyou to finish that project as well.\n\n259\n00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.350\nThe other thing, of course,\nis now, as a project manager,\n\n260\n00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.180\ninstead of you actually being able to\nchoose the project and work through it.\n\n261\n00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.770\nNow you're the one that has to\nanswer to the production manager.\n\n262\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.750\nWell, I don't I can't tell you why\nI don't have everything up and\n\n263\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.580\nrunning that you want to yet.\n\n264\n00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.810\nWell, you're the project manager\nyou should have gotten this\n\n265\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:39.890\ndone at this point.\n\n266\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.620\nWell, I didn't consider you were\nworking with part time resources or\n\n267\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.340\nthat you had six projects that were dumped\non you and you had to choose one and\n\n268\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.850\nyou chose theirs.\n\n269\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.370\nEverybody's working on it part time, you\nhave to actually think about these things\n\n270\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.890\nin this type of structure overall when\nyou start to take a look as well.\n\n271\n00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:55.550\nOkay?\n\n272\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.160\nIt also means that\nthe project manager himself.\n\n273\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.090\nAs far as resolutions go, to seeing\neverything through, he can't do it.\n\n274\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.820\nSo he has to actually assign\nsupervisors even within\n\n275\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.335\nthese projects that are not working\nas far as full time work goes.\n\n276\n00:15:11.335 --> 00:15:14.680\nHe may actually have to start two or\nthree projects and just say all right,\n\n277\n00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.450\nyou're going to be in charge of this one,\nyou're going to be in charge of this one,\n\n278\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.250\nand you're going to be\nin charge of this one.\n\n279\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.660\nAnd then just wait for the reports.\n\n280\n00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.680\nKind of a little bit hefty here.\n\n281\n00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.460\n&gt;&gt; I see.\nNow, when we look at this we see a matrix.\n\n282\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.310\nHow can we go ahead and\n\n283\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.540\nutilize a matrix design to help\nus get through this process?\n\n284\n00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, it actually comes\ndown to that company itself.\n\n285\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.344\nThat we have to actually think about a few\ndifferent things here when we start.\n\n286\n00:15:37.344 --> 00:15:42.600\nNow, when we start to take a look\nat the idea of a matrix type,\n\n287\n00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.560\ntype of organization.\n\n288\n00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.170\nLet me go ahead and switch here.\n\n289\n00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.230\nThere's actually three different\ntypes of matrix based organizations.\n\n290\n00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.743\nThere's what we call weak, there is\nthe idea of what we call a balanced, and\n\n291\n00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:54.730\nthere is a strong matrix as well.\n\n292\n00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.394\nNow, Cherokee, I'm gonna try to\ndo something really quickly here.\n\n293\n00:15:57.394 --> 00:16:00.394\nWhat I want you to do,\nit is like the shell game,\n\n294\n00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:04.230\nkeep your eye on the little pea\nthat is underneath the shell.\n\n295\n00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Keep your eye on the project manager is\n\n296\n00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.060\nwhat I want you to take a look at.\n\n297\n00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.100\n&gt;&gt; Ronny, you do realize I am\nnot wearing my glasses right.\n\n298\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.710\n&gt;&gt; Well that is fine because you\nshould be able to see this okay.\n\n299\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's see.\n\n300\n00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.600\n&gt;&gt; So here, and notice here,\n&gt;&gt; And notice here.\n\n301\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.160\nSo when we start to take a look at each\none of those, what are we actually saying?\n\n302\n00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.650\nWell, this is a company that really\nwants to include a project manager.\n\n303\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, I see them incorporating\nthat project manager, and bumping\n\n304\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.570\nup that hierarchy, and maybe putting\nthem into specific departments there.\n\n305\n00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it looks like that can\nhappen, but it just depends on how well\n\n306\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.900\nthat they situate this\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n307\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.840\nin a Weak Matrix,\nthat's not what happens, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.770\nSo, this is the way that this began.\n\n309\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.080\nWhat they find out, is that everybody is\nworking in a functional structure, but\n\n310\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.750\nnow that they realized that they want to\nbegin to start working projects in, they\n\n311\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:59.620\nnormally promote somebody on the staff\nlevel here to being a project manager.\n\n312\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n313\n00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.590\n&gt;&gt; And the promise, they're still probably\nworking in one of these departments.\n\n314\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:07.060\nSo their particular job is still split\n\n315\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.358\nwhen they start to do\nstuff like this as well.\n\n316\n00:17:09.358 --> 00:17:14.290\nSo yeah she end up with, at that point,\nwhen the financial department\n\n317\n00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:19.570\nneeds something done then that person, the\nfinancial manager, is actually the boss.\n\n318\n00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:22.350\nWhen the project manager\nneeds something done,\n\n319\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.740\nnow he's the boss on that\none particular project.\n\n320\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.060\nBut it may just be that one project.\n\n321\n00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.570\nEverything else he really\ndoesn't have any control over.\n\n322\n00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:34.380\nSo at this point, you have now shared\nauthority between two different people.\n\n323\n00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.110\nThe project manager that\nreally works as your coworker.\n\n324\n00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.625\nBut then on the project, he's your boss.\n\n325\n00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:39.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n326\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.700\nAnd then, the financial head,\n\n327\n00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.980\nyou actually have the boss,\nwho's actually the department boss, and\n\n328\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.420\nhe's the one that also makes\ndecisions with your time, as well.\n\n329\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.700\nSo you have to actually answer to\nboth when you have that, okay?\n\n330\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.360\nThe other thing of course, then, is that a\nproject manager, even though he might work\n\n331\n00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.650\nfor The financial department and\nhe's now the project manager.\n\n332\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.160\nIn theory, because he's actually\nkind of a boss at the same,\n\n333\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.300\nhe should be able to go over\nto marketing and say what,\n\n334\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.900\nI need somebody to help me on this,\nwho can you assign to my project, okay?\n\n335\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.350\nWell now here it is,\nthe marketing manager's now saying look.\n\n336\n00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.850\nYou really just work for\nso-and-so over in finances.\n\n337\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.800\nAnd you're telling me you need to\nactually take somebody off of my team?\n\n338\n00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.090\nAre you joking me?\n\n339\n00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.950\nThis is not something I really like,\nbut it can happen, right?\n\n340\n00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:31.940\nSo yes, you end up finding out that you do\nend up having a kind of a cross-department\n\n341\n00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.740\nsupport that needs to happen as well.\n\n342\n00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.880\n&gt;&gt; Again,\nI think it's really important to go ahead.\n\n343\n00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.000\nAnd I don't wanna sound\nlike a broken record but\n\n344\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.530\ncommunication is so important here.\n\n345\n00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:47.910\nAnd a lot of times if you ever do meet\nsome resistance, communication, okay?\n\n346\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.130\nSo you really have to explain and\nkinda break it down.\n\n347\n00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.310\nYou don't have to be rude about it but\nyou can say, look.\n\n348\n00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.060\nThis is what I need to have accomplished.\n\n349\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.590\nThis is why we're doing it and\nfrom my experience even coming from maybe\n\n350\n00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:04.650\na security standpoint, you know if someone\nisn't adhering to your password policy\n\n351\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.620\nyou are trying to force them to abide by\nthat or something, you can say this is why\n\n352\n00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.960\nwe do something because it is important\nto us as a whole, as an organization.\n\n353\n00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.040\nMaybe you have a company that\nhas a trade secrets, okay?\n\n354\n00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.610\nThink about two major soda brands,\nand what sets them apart?\n\n355\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.250\nMaybe one brand has a better\nrecipe than the other, so\n\n356\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:29.270\nif one were to obtain that recipe by\ngetting into their important data then\n\n357\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.220\nit really kinda puts\nthings into perspective.\n\n358\n00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.780\nYou don't have to be rude about it,\n\n359\n00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.480\nbut you really just wanna\nexplain it sometimes.\n\n360\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.470\n&gt;&gt; And that's true.\n\n361\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:42.530\nThe very fact is communication, good solid\ncommunication pattern are really key to\n\n362\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.730\na project manager surviving and\n\n363\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.690\neven thriving in those\nsituations when it's possible.\n\n364\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.221\nThe kind of drawback also that you have\nhere with the weak matrix is simple,\n\n365\n00:19:52.221 --> 00:19:54.140\nis that you may have no authority at all.\n\n366\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.540\nIn other words your base,\nbest authority is that you request help.\n\n367\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.610\nGet resources from other departments,\nbut you may not have that authority\n\n368\n00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:07.980\nto actually just re-assign people into\nthe project that you are working on.\n\n369\n00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.480\nNow, along with this then is also that\nidea of what we'll call a balanced one.\n\n370\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.000\nNow here it is, I was trying to tell\nCherokee to keep her eye on the project\n\n371\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.630\nmanager notice that here in\nthe Project Manager, he essentially\n\n372\n00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.100\ndoes become the Project Manager and\nhe might be assigned to that one, but\n\n373\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.700\nat this particular point he might\nhave equal authority, okay?\n\n374\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.480\nSo in other words he might work\npart time for Human Resources,\n\n375\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.910\nbut really the other part time job,\nhis full title here's also gonna be\n\n376\n00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:41.350\nthe idea of the project manager as well\nwhere he does have some moderate or\n\n377\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:46.830\nlow to moderate authority in which he can\nactually assign a few more resources to.\n\n378\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.290\nAnd be able to actually coordinate\nresources among the different departments\n\n379\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.150\nand of course, to find that balance\nof work that needs to be done.\n\n380\n00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:59.120\nAnd this is a little bit better\nthan the idea of the weak matrix,\n\n381\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.090\nin the very fact that all you're\ndoing there is requesting, so\n\n382\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.180\nyour authority may be incredibly low here.\n\n383\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.420\nA little bit more centered around\nthe very fact that you're now\n\n384\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.350\nconsidered someone that has authority\ninside of that organization, too.\n\n385\n00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.300\nOkay.\n\n386\n00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.340\nAnd then finally,\nthere is the idea of a strong matrix.\n\n387\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.190\nNow, this is what,\nI don't wanna say hope to see.\n\n388\n00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.180\nI kind of reduced the departments well,\n\n389\n00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.980\nbecause, this can actually end\nup happening in this sense.\n\n390\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.490\nWhereas everybody else had customer\nrelations, and different things.\n\n391\n00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.640\nWell, what if I actually realize\nthat what I need more than that,\n\n392\n00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.990\nis simply project management?\n\n393\n00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.000\nWell, you might actually have now,\n\n394\n00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.380\nan entire project management department,\nokay.\n\n395\n00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.110\nTo know where they actually\noperate on equal authority and\n\n396\n00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:47.760\nthey might have their own entire\nproject team by themselves.\n\n397\n00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.680\nOr they may have the authority now to be\ngoing from moderate to high authority.\n\n398\n00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.500\nAnd actually a full time job to being\nable to reassign resources to them\n\n399\n00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.390\nto manage everything that they need to,\nokay?\n\n400\n00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.050\nSo that is as close to ideal as we get\n\n401\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:09.620\nif we're trying not to change the overall\nproject organization structure itself.\n\n402\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.420\nBut we're trying to blend it into\nthe organization that exists.\n\n403\n00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.580\nSo this might be one of the higher\nones that we'll see and\n\n404\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.740\nI'll kind of put these in a tabular\nform here in just a moment.\n\n405\n00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:25.500\nLastly, here's what would be considered\nideal for our project manager, okay.\n\n406\n00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.370\nAn entirely projectized type\nof organization though.\n\n407\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.850\nEverything is pretty much a project, okay?\n\n408\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.280\nSo everything that you work on\npretty much becomes a project.\n\n409\n00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.950\nAnd then another portion of your\ncompany then becomes a manufacturing or\n\n410\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.890\nthe production team unto itself.\n\n411\n00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.540\nBut this is what you actually hope for, in\nwhich you have full dedicated resources,\n\n412\n00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.770\nyou have full authority over your teams.\n\n413\n00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:52.410\nAnd your answer and your responsibility is\ngoing to be, to hear that hierarchy is,\n\n414\n00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.080\nwhether it's the CEO or\nthe project management office, that's what\n\n415\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.910\nwould actually be more ideal in terms\nof working on a project here, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:06.120\nWith this you actually take\nthe actual projects themselves,\n\n417\n00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.990\nwe're not so worried about the\nfunctionality of the rest of the company,\n\n418\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.190\nbecause everything's actually managed\nin terms of projects anymore.\n\n419\n00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.900\nWe now have moderate to high authority,\nand\n\n420\n00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:19.120\nalso every resource that we hire tends\nto actually work on these projects, and\n\n421\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.580\nthey actually have the ability to do all\nthis, so now you even have the ability\n\n422\n00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.900\nas a project manager to add in ad\nhoc resources when you need them.\n\n423\n00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.220\nBecause you have the full\nauthority of your project as well.\n\n424\n00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.540\nSo, all these different types\nof organization structures,\n\n425\n00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.040\nare things you might find yourself in.\n\n426\n00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.060\nThis would be more ideal in a big company.\n\n427\n00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.190\nNow, what about in a small company?\n\n428\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.375\nIn a small company, you probably again,\n\n429\n00:23:42.375 --> 00:23:44.818\ndon't even assign\nthe role project manager.\n\n430\n00:23:44.818 --> 00:23:48.716\nEssentially it becomes more of\na situation that has to happen, and\n\n431\n00:23:48.716 --> 00:23:53.393\nyou take that onto yourself, and that's\nwhat ends up happening a lot of times.\n\n432\n00:23:53.393 --> 00:23:57.238\nBut we do need to see a comparison of\nthese, because it really does help.\n\n433\n00:23:57.238 --> 00:24:02.845\nSo let's help us by taking a look at some\nof the things we need to focus in on here,\n\n434\n00:24:02.845 --> 00:24:03.390\nokay?\n\n435\n00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:08.650\nSo let me see if I can do something really\nquickly here to make this, there we go.\n\n436\n00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.050\nThat'll actually make\nit a little bit better.\n\n437\n00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:14.040\nI don't even have to move\nmy zoom out here, okay.\n\n438\n00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.260\nSo when you start taking a look\nat how this impacts them,\n\n439\n00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.650\na project manager's ability to do things,\nright?\n\n440\n00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.210\nAnd what their roles and\nresponses will be, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.520\nSo over here on the left-hand side,\n\n442\n00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.056\nnotice we're taking to\nthe project manager authority.\n\n443\n00:24:28.056 --> 00:24:30.100\nThe resource availability\nof that project manager,\n\n444\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.590\nas well as who's actually gonna\nmanage the budget for these projects.\n\n445\n00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:38.070\nAnd what his role is, and even if they\nhave administrative staff to help us out.\n\n446\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.670\nSo here's how it breaks down when you try\nand kind of put it all together, okay?\n\n447\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:48.740\nIn a functional organization, notice that\nthe authority here is little to none,\n\n448\n00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.140\nand even the resource availability,\nthey're only available if\n\n449\n00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.240\nthe actual functional managers say,\nyes, you can have them.\n\n450\n00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.690\nThe budget though, you may not\neven have a budget at this point.\n\n451\n00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.190\nIn other words, it may be one\nof the functional managers says,\n\n452\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.160\nyeah you're going to have this resource,\nand I have to pay for it, and that's all I\n\n453\n00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.370\nreally care about, and that this is how\nmuch time you have to work with him.\n\n454\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.170\nBut notice that your role\nmay be part time, and\n\n455\n00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.810\nany other staff that you might have, is\ngoing to be considered part time as well.\n\n456\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:20.620\nIn the week matrix here, okay,\nwe actually now go to low.\n\n457\n00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.730\nAnd notice the functional manager pretty\nmuch has control of the budget again and\n\n458\n00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:25.710\nyou're still at part-time.\n\n459\n00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:29.200\nWhen we start getting it\nto companies that start\n\n460\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.930\naccepting the idea of project\nmanagement a little bit better, right.\n\n461\n00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.730\nYou now go into moderate and\nwhat, you now share authority.\n\n462\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:42.120\nAnd now the budget isn't mixed because you\ndo actually share the authority itself,\n\n463\n00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.690\nbut your role is now considered full time.\n\n464\n00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.540\nAnd then of course, as you start moving\ntowards stronger and stronger, notice that\n\n465\n00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:53.019\nnow you may even have high authority, and\nnow you have your own budget to deal with.\n\n466\n00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.911\nAnd then you actually\nhave full-time resources.\n\n467\n00:25:56.911 --> 00:26:01.480\nUltimately here, in a projectized\nenvironment, notice that you have\n\n468\n00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.410\ntotal authority, a lot of times, to do\nwhat you need to as a project manager.\n\n469\n00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.180\nAnd that your particular role here and\n\n470\n00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.760\nall the support staff you need is really\ndedicated to your management as well.\n\n471\n00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.780\nAnd all organizations tend to kind of\nbreak down into these types of structures\n\n472\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.560\nwhen they're larger organizations.\n\n473\n00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.300\nNow you may wonder, are we really\ngonna have to break this down?\n\n474\n00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.740\nWell in real life, right,\n\n475\n00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.790\nyou're gonna find yourself fitting\ninto one of these generic roles.\n\n476\n00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.130\nNow there's specialized\nones that are out there.\n\n477\n00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:36.120\nBut overall though, if you actually do\nfind yourself in a weak-matrixed one, so\n\n478\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.440\nkind of remember,\nyour authority's fairly limited there.\n\n479\n00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.930\nIf you're actually in a projectized one,\nand\n\n480\n00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.470\nyou're the project manager,\nyou'll have full control.\n\n481\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:49.560\nSo there's a big range of\nauthority that you have,\n\n482\n00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.800\nas well as control of your resources.\n\n483\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.990\nAnd that's what it really boils down to,\ndepending on the organization you're\n\n484\n00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.760\nworking with and that's a great chart\nyou have provided for us there Ronnie.\n\n485\n00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.630\n&gt;&gt; It really just explains everything\nthat we've covered so far.\n\n486\n00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.430\nWe see your different organizational\nstructures as well as the authority that's\n\n487\n00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.950\nassociated with each one\nof those types there.\n\n488\n00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.370\nSo, it's a good stopping point for today.\n\n489\n00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.980\nThank you Ronnie for being with us and\nthank you guys so much for tuning in.\n\n490\n00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.920\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n491\n00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n492\n00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.864\n&gt;&gt; Signing off, have a great day.\n\n493\n00:27:18.378 --> 00:27:24.311\n[MUSIC]\n\n494\n00:27:24.311 --> 00:27:27.662\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

They convey the importance to decomposition, or breaking down the scope into workable components to help estimate duration, allocate resources and assign costs. We create different levels of our WBS during decomposition. We see the top level as the project, the 2nd sub level as work units and lower levels being called work package levels. Ronnie also shows us an example of a WBS dictionary to help us understand how to decipher a WBS without having to rely on interpretations of the document.",

00:00:12.266\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.276\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:17.480\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.730\nToday we're continuing with our\nProject+ CompTIA certification.\n\n7\n00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.560\nWe're gonna be looking at how to\nexecute and design a project schedule.\n\n8\n00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.210\nAnd the title of this episode does\nlook a little transposed, but\n\n9\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.505\nthat's how CompTIA calls that out.\n\n10\n00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:31.585\nIsn't that right, Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:33.994\n&gt;&gt; It really is,\nwe're taking a look at executing and\n\n12\n00:00:33.994 --> 00:00:36.134\ndeveloping that idea\nof a project schedule.\n\n13\n00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:39.745\nSo we are actually gonna talk about,\nof course, development first, and\n\n14\n00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:42.731\nthen we'll talk about execution\nin just a little bit, too.\n\n15\n00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:44.866\nNow, when we begin to take a look, well,\n\n16\n00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:48.294\nremember that we're still in\nthe planning phases of our project.\n\n17\n00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:50.503\nAnd initiation,\neven though we've talked about it and\n\n18\n00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:52.153\nwe've really summarized those things.\n\n19\n00:00:52.153 --> 00:00:55.996\nBut overall, though, we need to begin\nby taking a look, very seriously,\n\n20\n00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:58.880\nat the idea of, well, a project schedule.\n\n21\n00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.680\nAnd when it comes down to it, this is\nwhere we start to actually take things\n\n22\n00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.580\nthat we would have learned\nin that initiation phase,\n\n23\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.430\nsuch as understanding the project scope\nitself, and now breaking that scope.\n\n24\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.978\nIn other words, what we hope to see at\nthe end of the project now down into,\n\n25\n00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:15.870\nwell, workable units.\n\n26\n00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.415\nSo that is what we actually need to talk\nabout today because, well, a lot of times,\n\n27\n00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:24.340\nif we're actually beginning our career\nin project management, we may be told,\n\n28\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.730\nhere's what we need, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.100\nAnd now you're sitting there wondering,\nwell,\n\n30\n00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.270\nhow do I get to that point to do that?\n\n31\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.320\nAnd that's what we're\nactually going to talk about,\n\n32\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.670\na big concept that we call the WBS,\nor the work breakdown structure.\n\n33\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.650\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what is the purpose\nof a work breakdown structure?\n\n34\n00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.440\n&gt;&gt; Well, the work breakdown structure\nreally does help us to make sure that we\n\n35\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.300\ncan take that idea,\nthe entire project scope, and\n\n36\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.590\nreally break it down into workable and\nmanageable units, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.790\nSo let's take a look at my screen\nas we help to answer that question.\n\n38\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790\nAnd I hate putting just a bunch\nof words beside my head here so\n\n39\n00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.900\nthat you can see them.\n\n40\n00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.710\nBut there's just so\nmany concepts that it's very difficult,\n\n41\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.010\nif you don't seem them, that you're\ngonna kind of get lost in them, as well.\n\n42\n00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.030\nSo first and foremost, at least for\nyou as a project manager, okay,\n\n43\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.930\nit really gives you a graphic display\nof the entirety of the project scope.\n\n44\n00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.513\nScopes are normally written\nin sentences and, of course,\n\n45\n00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:21.681\nthen paragraphs to give you an idea\nof what they hope to expect to see.\n\n46\n00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:25.916\nAnd maybe even a rough diagram of what\nthey believe that the product should turn\n\n47\n00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:26.860\nout to be.\n\n48\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.120\nThe unusual thing here on the deliverable\nend, what we might find out is, later on\n\n49\n00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.580\nas we go through the project, it won't\nlook exactly like the original drawing.\n\n50\n00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.790\nIt just never does sometimes, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.930\nBut that's at least the first\nthing that we have.\n\n52\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.110\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhy is that important?\n\n53\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.920\nBecause it's important for\nus to now be able to take that and\n\n54\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.600\nput it down into something that we can\nsee that can be manageable units, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.860\nNow, when we do so, what will also happen,\nokay, is that at the end of\n\n56\n00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.720\nus working through this idea of creating\na work breakdown structure, it will\n\n57\n00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.350\nalso give us inputs then to all of these\nother types of activities that we see.\n\n58\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.750\nOkay, so the work breakdown structure\nallows us now to be able to plan out\n\n59\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.430\nthe idea of a duration of some type of\nproject, or even a part of a project.\n\n60\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.390\nNow, when I talk about the idea of\nthe duration, we're not specifically\n\n61\n00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.390\nmentioning the idea here of\nhow long something will take,\n\n62\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.720\nas far as the overall beginning and\nend so much.\n\n63\n00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.450\nBut how long will a particular task\ntake us is what we actually need to do.\n\n64\n00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.180\nSo sometimes we might be told,\nhere's what you need to create,\n\n65\n00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.070\nRonnie, you need to create a chair.\n\n66\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.410\nOkay, we all know that there's\nmany different types of chairs,\n\n67\n00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.390\nbut how do I know how long\nthat's going to take?\n\n68\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.190\nI may not have ever had that before,\nso I may consult with some experts.\n\n69\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.230\nI may actually go and talk to a carpenter.\n\n70\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.280\nAnd I may go, all right, here's how long\nit should take me to develop a chair.\n\n71\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.080\nIn other words,\nbe able to actually estimate.\n\n72\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.160\nWell, a work breakdown structure\nshould allow us to do that.\n\n73\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.680\nAnd the whole goal behind it is to say,\nall right, we need to make\n\n74\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.660\nsure that we can manage whatever we're\nassigned in manageable units, and\n\n75\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.100\nin realistic units of time, as well.\n\n76\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.300\nSo being able to estimate activity\ndurations is a very important\n\n77\n00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.870\npart of what we do to try and\nhelp out with that.\n\n78\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.814\nSo you might find out that activities,\nas far as their time goes,\n\n79\n00:04:19.814 --> 00:04:22.753\nit normally is broken up,\nin terms of duration,\n\n80\n00:04:22.753 --> 00:04:28.160\ninto minutes that something could go on,\ninto, of course, hours then, days, weeks.\n\n81\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.151\nAnd heck, months, even years at times,\nwhat the overall duration of a particular\n\n82\n00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:36.018\npart of your project may\nactually end up being.\n\n83\n00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:39.564\nSo you have to be able to come up with\nsome type of estimate if you're ever gonna\n\n84\n00:04:39.564 --> 00:04:42.320\naccomplish it in a realistic way, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.100\nThe other thing that it helps us to do\nis determine what we call the idea of\n\n86\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.060\nwork effort here, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.777\nNow, work effort has to do with the fact\nthat we might find out through the work\n\n88\n00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:57.641\nbreakdown structure that there are certain\ntasks that can be done, actually,\n\n89\n00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:02.527\na lot quicker than what we think, as we\nactually assign more resources to them.\n\n90\n00:05:02.527 --> 00:05:05.832\nOr, they're only gonna get done\nin a particular amount of time,\n\n91\n00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:08.970\nregardless of how many resources\nwe assign to them, as well.\n\n92\n00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.550\nAnd what we're talking about there is\nthat there are what we call effort-driven\n\n93\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.970\ntypes of tasks.\n\n94\n00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.720\nAnd then there's what we call\nnon effort-driven tasks.\n\n95\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.110\nNow, if you haven't heard that term before\nand you're new to project management,\n\n96\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.830\nwell, let's go ahead and try and give\nyou an example of an effort-driven task.\n\n97\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.090\nSo Cherokee, let's take this for\nexample, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.136\nThat I am told by our head chef,\nwhoever that is,\n\n99\n00:05:31.136 --> 00:05:34.705\nthat I'm going to be peeling 50 pounds.\n\n100\n00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:37.764\nOkay, let's make it 100\npounds to make them nice,\n\n101\n00:05:37.764 --> 00:05:41.640\neven numbers, 100 pounds of onions,\nokay, by myself.\n\n102\n00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.340\nAnd when I do that and I'm trying to\nestimate how much time it might take me,\n\n103\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.970\nwell, in this particular\neffort of trying to\n\n104\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.370\nhave 100 pounds of onions peeled back and\neverything that I need to,\n\n105\n00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.010\nI might guess that it might take me,\nlet's say, four hours altogether.\n\n106\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.381\nI don't know how long it\nwould actually take me, but\n\n107\n00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:02.357\nlet's say it's four hours, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:06.511\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, in that sense, I've now estimated\n\n109\n00:06:06.511 --> 00:06:13.090\na duration for that entire task, but it\ncan be an effort-driven task in this way.\n\n110\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.855\nLet's say that as Cherokee walks by,\n\n111\n00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:18.400\nI realize that she's just kind of\nwondering about what she should be doing.\n\n112\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.250\nSo I hand her a knife and I go, Cherokee\nhelp me peel these 100 pounds of onions.\n\n113\n00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.170\nAnd she's going to love me for\n\n114\n00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.050\nit because she's gonna smell\nlike onions afterwards, anyways.\n\n115\n00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.005\nSo when she does that, well,\nwhat should end up happening?\n\n116\n00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:34.320\nWell, if this is an effort-driven task,\nessentially, we split.\n\n117\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.960\nOkay, in all reality,\nit may not be a split,\n\n118\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.567\nbut let's say that in theory-\n&gt;&gt; What are you trying to say\n\n119\n00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:40.227\nhere, Ronnie?\n\n120\n00:06:40.227 --> 00:06:42.771\n&gt;&gt; Well, what I may say is that\nyou may be faster than I am, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:43.336\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n122\n00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.967\n&gt;&gt; So you may actually end\nup peeling more than I am.\n\n123\n00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:47.835\nBut in the way that we calculate this out,\nright,\n\n124\n00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:51.521\nit may mean that what we probably\nwill do is that Cherokee will end\n\n125\n00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:56.250\nup peeling 50 pounds of it and\nI'll end up peeling 50 pounds of it.\n\n126\n00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.684\nNow, if that's true, and I said 100 pounds\nis gonna take me four hours, right,\n\n127\n00:07:00.684 --> 00:07:03.067\nwell, now I have two\npeople working on that.\n\n128\n00:07:03.067 --> 00:07:09.138\nWell, my duration of the task itself\nis going to shorten into two hours,\n\n129\n00:07:09.138 --> 00:07:11.160\ninstead of four.\n\n130\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.840\nSo in other words, what should have\naccomplished in four hours because one\n\n131\n00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.440\nperson is working on it now\nis actually accomplished in\n\n132\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.090\ntwo hours because two people\nare working on it instead.\n\n133\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.620\nAnd you might be wondering, well,\nwhy is it that if the overall work\n\n134\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.340\nitself is four hours long,\nhow can it be accomplished in two hours?\n\n135\n00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.432\nWell, remember that I'm putting\nin two hours of work and\n\n136\n00:07:30.432 --> 00:07:34.660\nCherokee is putting in two hours of work,\nbut we're doing it simultaneously.\n\n137\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.537\nThat still equals four hours of\noverall work that needs to be done.\n\n138\n00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:42.044\nBut because we've divided it over,\nwell, two resources instead of one,\n\n139\n00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:44.112\nthat's where we can shorten the duration.\n\n140\n00:07:44.112 --> 00:07:47.205\nAn effort-driven task\nnormally can do that, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:50.895\nNow, the other one that's probably more\ncommon than what we realize, which is,\n\n142\n00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:53.582\nlet's take, for an example,\na non effort-driven task.\n\n143\n00:07:53.582 --> 00:07:57.983\nOkay, now in our studios, our brand new\nstudios that we've actually just moved\n\n144\n00:07:57.983 --> 00:08:02.710\ninto, there's a lot of painting that\nwent on inside of these studios, okay.\n\n145\n00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.360\nEvery wall inside of our studios is black.\n\n146\n00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.700\nAnd we've got some different\nsound insulation and\n\n147\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.580\nsome foam up, but\nit was painted black overall.\n\n148\n00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.400\nNow in this particular instance here,\nwhy is this not considered and\n\n149\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.940\neffort driven task?\n\n150\n00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.990\nWell it depends on how many\npeople you have assigned to.\n\n151\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.150\nBut let's say one person\nwas assigned to this.\n\n152\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.930\nWell we can't go ahead and put on\na second coat until the first coat dries.\n\n153\n00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.260\nIt doesn't matter how many\npeople you have painting, right?\n\n154\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.460\nSo let's say we have six people painting.\n\n155\n00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.430\nWell, now they've painted the entire wall.\n\n156\n00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.240\nWell, it's not like they can go around and\nput a second coat on that immediately.\n\n157\n00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.730\nThey still have to wait for it to dry.\n\n158\n00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.040\nYou could pay for six people to wait for\n\n159\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.300\nthe wall to dry before\nthey put a second coat or\n\n160\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.660\nyou could say hey let's get the other guys\nto paint all the rest of the rooms here.\n\n161\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.070\nAnd then by the time we get done,\n\n162\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.500\nmaybe we'll be able to put\nup a second coat then.\n\n163\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.824\nSo sometimes you have to wait, and it\ndoesn't matter how many people you assign\n\n164\n00:08:55.824 --> 00:08:59.509\nto the resources, there's gonna be time in\nbetween when something like that happens.\n\n165\n00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:02.965\nConstruction's actually a good example\nof some of these and actually of both of\n\n166\n00:09:02.965 --> 00:09:06.059\nthese, where you might have some that\nwhere the more people that help,\n\n167\n00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:08.500\nthe better it's gonna be but\nlet's say that here it is.\n\n168\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.380\nYou're waiting for a foundation to\nbe poured before anything can start.\n\n169\n00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.300\nWell, that's it.\n\n170\n00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.050\nEverybody has to wait on that\ntruck as the foundation's poured.\n\n171\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.380\nSo you can have everybody there on day\none when there's no foundation and\n\n172\n00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.710\nnothing's being poured.\n\n173\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.840\nYou can be paying them all.\n\n174\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.890\nBut they're still gonna have to wait\nuntil that foundation's poured.\n\n175\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.500\nAnd of course, cured,\ndried and ready to go up.\n\n176\n00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.120\nAnd so you still have to\nwait on something like that.\n\n177\n00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.060\nSo breaking this down\nright by using the word\n\n178\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.690\nBreakdown Structures is\nreally gonna help us out.\n\n179\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.310\nNow, these remaining two here, okay,\n\n180\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.900\nit actually helps us to figure out how\nmany resources that we have and then,\n\n181\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.080\nof course, ultimately how much money we're\ngoing to budget for something like this.\n\n182\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.150\nAs we start to use this as well, okay.\n\n183\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.750\nNow we wanna make sure that\nalso what is very clear here.\n\n184\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.710\nIs that because this is a graphical\ndisplay of the project scope itself.\n\n185\n00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.570\nThis helps us to understand\nthat what we have\n\n186\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.870\ninside of the work breakdown structure\nreally is what's involved in the project.\n\n187\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.490\nAnd that whatever is not in here\nat this particular point in time,\n\n188\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.610\nis not gonna be included\nin the project as well.\n\n189\n00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.820\nIn other words,\nsetting some exclusions up is going to be,\n\n190\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.540\nreally kind of the key for\nus to understand this.\n\n191\n00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.580\nSo that's what it really does do.\n\n192\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.270\nAnd a lot of it just looks like the hay.\n\n193\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.550\nWe're really just setting up for\n\n194\n00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.660\nthese other activities to come\nwith work break down structure.\n\n195\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.390\nSo just kinda realize that at least at the\nbeginning, this is what we tend to see and\n\n196\n00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.310\nits overall purpose, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.560\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\nThank you for that.\n\n198\n00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.800\nSo aside from project preparation,\nare there any other additional\n\n199\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.210\nbenefits that we see directly from\nour work breakdown structure?\n\n200\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, the key is the one that\nwe've really been talking about.\n\n201\n00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.580\nBut we need to put it into\nthe proper CompTIA terminology and\n\n202\n00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.890\nproject management terminology.\n\n203\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.690\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n204\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.630\nAnd hopefully this will\nhelp us out as well, okay?\n\n205\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.350\nSo really, what we've been talking\nabout here up into this point,\n\n206\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.300\nis that idea what we'll\ncall decomposition.\n\n207\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.890\nNow, if you've been watching one of those\ntrue like detective channels on TV and\n\n208\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.630\nstuff, it's not the same thing, right.\n\n209\n00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.160\nWe're not talking about that.\n\n210\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.850\nBut what we're talking about now,\nis being able to take the scope itself.\n\n211\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.450\nAnd breaking up into work packages or\n\n212\n00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.690\nwork components,\nwhatever term that you want to call it.\n\n213\n00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:20.100\nI think the pembot calls\nit a work package overall.\n\n214\n00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.680\nAnd this is what we need to do because\nthat's where the manageable unit is gonna\n\n215\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.380\nbe and that's why our project\nmanager needs to understand.\n\n216\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.930\nHe wants to be able to\ntake the information and\n\n217\n00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.720\nsay all right here is a manageable unit.\n\n218\n00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.090\nHe don't wanna have too much on it,\n\n219\n00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.930\nhe doesn't wanna have too little\nbecause both of them, right,\n\n220\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.750\ntoo much means it's overwhelming for\nwhatever team I'm gonna assign this too.\n\n221\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.780\nToo little means,\n\n222\n00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.790\nI'm wasting resources by assigning\ntoo many resources to it as well.\n\n223\n00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.010\nSo, over,\nyou can either do something like that.\n\n224\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:52.350\nBut this is the whole goal, is to make\nit into the perfect manageable units for\n\n225\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.090\nyour your work, to your project team.\n\n226\n00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.180\nI keep saying work team.\n\n227\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.240\nYour project team to help out.\n\n228\n00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.460\nSo that's what you want to do is,\nand the way that we break that down,\n\n229\n00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.370\nright, is that it's the amount of\nwork accomplished as a time estimate.\n\n230\n00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.920\nOkay, I don't know why I actually\nhave that two times here,\n\n231\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.660\nbut time estimates,\nis just my typing ability is terrible.\n\n232\n00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.070\nSo that is key, now what does that mean,\nthat means that when I say hey,\n\n233\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:24.860\nhere is what we are going to do,\nI now make an estimate based on,\n\n234\n00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:30.810\neither my own expert judgment, based\non information that I asked the team,\n\n235\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.540\nhow long is it gonna take us to,\nlet's take for\n\n236\n00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.420\nan example migrating over ten class.\n\n237\n00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:43.370\nHow long is it gonna take Cherokee\nto go ahead and be able to install.\n\n238\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:51.190\nLet's say Windows server 2012\non these two machines and\n\n239\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.210\nmake them into a cluster and do on it.\n\n240\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.850\nWell I'm not trying to tell her that\nshe has to do it on the spot, but\n\n241\n00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.680\nwhat I'm saying is I need an estimate\nof how long that's going to take and\n\n242\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.790\nis that actually going to be enough\nwork as far as work package go?\n\n243\n00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.170\nOr do I need to actually\nassign more to it?\n\n244\n00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.250\nSo that's what we want to do.\n\n245\n00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.570\nAnd then at that point figure out how\nmany resources we assign to it and\n\n246\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.750\nthe ultimate cost and value.\n\n247\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.940\nAnd then that gives us some detail\nabout how this work is gonna proceed.\n\n248\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.100\nAnd then secondly of course, is making\nsure that the team understands and\n\n249\n00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.040\nthe work breakdown structure.\n\n250\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.810\nThat exclusions are considered\nkey as well as deliberate, okay?\n\n251\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:33.940\nSo this way, my team doesn't take for\nexample here,\n\n252\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.940\nwell Ronnie, because you asked for this,\nokay, I also gave you this as well.\n\n253\n00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.300\nNow don't get me wrong,\nthat happens all the time.\n\n254\n00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.530\nAnd Don Pezet,\nhe's the one that actually said, Ronnie,\n\n255\n00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.920\nyou are the classic example of this idea\nof what we call over-production, okay?\n\n256\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.430\nSo Don was making fun of\nme cuz one time we set up\n\n257\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.520\nan actual testing environment for\nsomething.\n\n258\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.140\nHe said, Ronnie,\nI really need two 2012 server,\n\n259\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.840\njust like what we're talking about here.\n\n260\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.810\nAnd I need them to actually do this.\n\n261\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.700\nAnd I did, that's what I thought I did.\n\n262\n00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.310\nBut on top of that I went and\nI added an antivirus, I turned on DNS,\n\n263\n00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.960\nI went ahead and made sure that\neverything was actually set up\n\n264\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.695\nwhat I thought was actually\nthe way that he wanted to.\n\n265\n00:14:12.695 --> 00:14:17.250\nNow, I just really needed those machines\nup and running so that I could get this.\n\n266\n00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.320\nI didn't realize that.\n\n267\n00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.820\nSo an overproduction can be just as bad\nas an underproduction at that point.\n\n268\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.360\nBecause it means that\nif I'm over producing,\n\n269\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.940\nthat's going to go into cost over runs,\nsome different things that happen.\n\n270\n00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.300\nSo the benefit of the work breakdown\nschedule here is to make sure that,\n\n271\n00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.040\nthat manageable unit is really\nthat manageable unit and\n\n272\n00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.200\nthat somebody isn't spending more\ntime on it then they realize.\n\n273\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.870\nBecause if you do, and\nit's on your own personal time,\n\n274\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.750\nthat particular resource\nis going to burn out.\n\n275\n00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:50.750\nOr they may just start to think\nthat hey this is harder than what\n\n276\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.080\nwe thought it was gonna be and\nthey didn't know what to do.\n\n277\n00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.400\nAnd we might have actually\nbeen saying exactly that.\n\n278\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.880\nI only need this amount\nof work to be done,\n\n279\n00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.210\nand here it is you're trying\nto accomplish the whole thing.\n\n280\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.060\nBut, I really had this scheduled for\nCherokee to finish and\n\n281\n00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.430\ndo instead and, you've done it.\n\n282\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.150\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, I can relate 100%.\n\n283\n00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.560\nThere have been actual situations where,\nespecially from an IT perspective.\n\n284\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.230\nLet's say someone's workstation\nisn't operating properly, and\n\n285\n00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.020\ninstead of trying to put all of.\n\n286\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.310\nAnd having your IT background\ntroubleshooting is just kind of ingrained.\n\n287\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.787\nSo you wanna find the root cause,\nor the problem and try to solve,\n\n288\n00:15:24.787 --> 00:15:26.445\nand fix remedy the situation.\n\n289\n00:15:26.445 --> 00:15:28.761\nHowever, from a business perspective,\n\n290\n00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:32.608\nsometimes it's more beneficial to\nget that end user up and running.\n\n291\n00:15:32.608 --> 00:15:36.367\nOkay, let's get this machine over to\nthe IT department when we have time and\n\n292\n00:15:36.367 --> 00:15:40.260\nresources to go ahead and handle that and\njust keep our employees productive.\n\n293\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.979\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that that's\nkind of the key here when\n\n294\n00:15:43.979 --> 00:15:46.721\nwe start figuring out\n&gt;&gt; The idea of how this work breakdown\n\n295\n00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:49.706\nstructure works, and\nthat's what we're heading to next,\n\n296\n00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:52.104\nis we wanna take a look at\nhow do we break this up and\n\n297\n00:15:52.104 --> 00:15:56.047\nhow do we actually show it and display it\nand Do some of the things that we need to.\n\n298\n00:15:56.047 --> 00:15:58.726\nSo we wanna talk about the way\nthat this breaks down, and\n\n299\n00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:02.900\nwe're gonna take a look at the levels\nof creating a work breakdown structure.\n\n300\n00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.445\nNow, do not take this as being\n100% always gonna be exactly\n\n301\n00:16:07.445 --> 00:16:11.411\nthe way that you're gonna\nsee it from everybody else.\n\n302\n00:16:11.411 --> 00:16:14.351\nThis is kind of the Ronnie Wong\nwork breakdown structure,\n\n303\n00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:15.555\nin the way that I see it.\n\n304\n00:16:15.555 --> 00:16:17.930\nYou'll see people actually do\nmanage this in different ways.\n\n305\n00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.711\nThey might use an Excel spreadsheet,\n\n306\n00:16:19.711 --> 00:16:22.617\nthey might do some of the different\nthings that are out there.\n\n307\n00:16:22.617 --> 00:16:26.160\nBut we're just talking about\na high level overview, right?\n\n308\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.396\nSo usually,\nyou begin with this top level project.\n\n309\n00:16:29.396 --> 00:16:32.737\nNow that's normally gonna be our\nproject scope that we are told, or\n\n310\n00:16:32.737 --> 00:16:35.561\nthat we're a part of when we\nstart the initiation phase.\n\n311\n00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:38.653\nThat is considered the top level\nof a work breakdown structure,\n\n312\n00:16:38.653 --> 00:16:42.110\nif you're gonna try and\ndo it in outline form like I am.\n\n313\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.640\nAnd then once you have\nthat as a project manager,\n\n314\n00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.970\nyour next goal is in this\nfirst sub level here, okay?\n\n315\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.950\nTo break that up, that scope up either\ninto the major deliverables and\n\n316\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.550\nthat's key, okay.\n\n317\n00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:58.642\nWhat is it that you're going to produce\nfrom this that will give you the scope or\n\n318\n00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:00.937\nyou can break it in the sub projects,\nokay?\n\n319\n00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:04.210\nNow what's the difference between\na deliverable and sub project?\n\n320\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.330\nNot too much, but if you believe\nthat you can actually say, hey,\n\n321\n00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.730\nI can say that this is what we're gonna\nproduce at the end of this work package,\n\n322\n00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.660\nthen make it a deliverable.\n\n323\n00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.700\nIf you believe it's gonna take\nmultiple processes for you to\n\n324\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.610\nactually end up with that deliverable,\nmake it into a sub project, okay?\n\n325\n00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.697\nThen at that point, we wanna actually\nget into the second sub level here.\n\n326\n00:17:25.697 --> 00:17:29.892\nAnd then we break down into what\nwe call the work unit itself or\n\n327\n00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:31.713\nthe work package, okay?\n\n328\n00:17:31.713 --> 00:17:36.100\nSo at that point you don't have to,\nthere's a couple of different ways you can\n\n329\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:41.120\nactually end up doing this, now you can\neven break this down into smaller levels.\n\n330\n00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.877\nBut notice the key here,\nwhat ever level that you chose to stop,\n\n331\n00:17:44.877 --> 00:17:47.883\nthat should be where the work\npackage actually is.\n\n332\n00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:52.108\nAnd you actually know that you finished\nfilling out the entire work package.\n\n333\n00:17:52.108 --> 00:17:55.529\nWhen you do have the resource and\nthe cost managements, okay?\n\n334\n00:17:55.529 --> 00:17:59.590\nAnd also the resource that are assigned,\nto accomplish the activity.\n\n335\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.860\nSo notice that everything has to come\ntogether before we've actually really\n\n336\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.010\nfinished this in reality.\n\n337\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.750\nNow there's a couple ways that this\nnormally happens, Cherokee, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.375\nDuring a meeting as a project manager,\nokay?\n\n339\n00:18:14.375 --> 00:18:19.278\nIf I call you in as a subject\nmatter expert on something, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:19.278 --> 00:18:21.767\nSo what we might do is I might sit and go,\n\n341\n00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:25.171\nhere is the overall top\nlevel scope of things, okay?\n\n342\n00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:29.474\nSo let me bring up my example that I have\nactually been using throughout, so far,\n\n343\n00:18:29.474 --> 00:18:32.680\nand make sure I actually\nhave everything here.\n\n344\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.800\nTrying to, and make sure it's\nactually on the screen, there we go.\n\n345\n00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.370\nSo let's say that at this top level here,\nwhere it says,\n\n346\n00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.070\nmigrate users to thin clients.\n\n347\n00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.850\nThat was actually the overall\nproject that we talked about and\n\n348\n00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.460\nmy overall scope of what I needed to do.\n\n349\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.604\nAnd then at this first sub level here,\nokay?\n\n350\n00:18:49.604 --> 00:18:53.808\nWhat I have and actually multiple ones\njust trying to extent out to the end here.\n\n351\n00:18:53.808 --> 00:18:57.505\nWhat I did, is I said look,\nhere's how I broke this down.\n\n352\n00:18:57.505 --> 00:19:02.225\nAnd Cherokee, and maybe some of the other\npeople that I have on my project team,\n\n353\n00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:05.335\nthey look at this, and\nnow they realize something.\n\n354\n00:19:05.335 --> 00:19:09.740\nHey, Ronnie, on system 1.2 here,\nsystem testing, okay?\n\n355\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.466\nYou don't really spell it out, and we\nshould probably break that down a little\n\n356\n00:19:13.466 --> 00:19:15.616\nbit more, cuz that could involve anything.\n\n357\n00:19:15.616 --> 00:19:18.802\nWell as a project manager,\nI have two choices at this point.\n\n358\n00:19:18.802 --> 00:19:20.268\nI could try and flesh it out.\n\n359\n00:19:20.268 --> 00:19:22.510\nIf I'm the technical expert\nat this point to doing it,\n\n360\n00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.970\nthat's probably the best thing I could do.\n\n361\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.960\nBut if Cherokee is the technical\nexpert on this particular point here.\n\n362\n00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.797\nI might say, Cherokee,\nyou're absolutely right, so\n\n363\n00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:37.708\nhere's part of your task that's going\nto head up system testing here.\n\n364\n00:19:37.708 --> 00:19:42.066\nIs I need you to flash out the rest\nof the work packages for me, so\n\n365\n00:19:42.066 --> 00:19:46.605\nthat I can include that into my\nwork breakdown structure, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:46.605 --> 00:19:49.760\nSo you don't have to do it all, okay?\n\n367\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.520\nYou actually can, when you start\nmeeting and start developing this,\n\n368\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.120\nis that you might find out that you're\nreally good in some parts of it and\n\n369\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.310\nmaybe not so good in other parts of it.\n\n370\n00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.690\nAnd that's why you do have that\nteam to really help you out,\n\n371\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.280\nto flash everything out, to do that.\n\n372\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.370\nSo there's multiple ways that can\nbe handled when we start taking\n\n373\n00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.160\na look at that work breakdown structure.\n\n374\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.353\nBut just kind of realize that's\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n375\n00:20:12.353 --> 00:20:17.008\nIs wanna make it that smallest manageable\nunit that could be divided up into work\n\n376\n00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:22.150\npackages for everyone on our project to\nbe able to follow as we do this, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.690\nSo now that we have that idea and\n\n378\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.690\nthat understanding of just the breakdown,\nright?\n\n379\n00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:34.259\nYou've got a good solid at least\nintroduction to the way that we need to,\n\n380\n00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:40.033\nat least begin the planning part of\nwhile everything else is gonna happen.\n\n381\n00:20:40.033 --> 00:20:42.410\nAnd this is one of those\nimportant elements that we have.\n\n382\n00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.021\nNow the other thing I wanna point out is,\nlet's take a look at this numbering system\n\n383\n00:20:45.021 --> 00:20:46.564\nhere, cuz you might have\nactually looked at it.\n\n384\n00:20:46.564 --> 00:20:49.670\nAnd said, hey, what's the numbering about?\n\n385\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.570\nSo let's go back to my diagram here,\nand notice how I have this broken up.\n\n386\n00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.961\nUp here at the top, I have 1.0,\n\n387\n00:20:55.961 --> 00:20:59.769\nnow you can pick any numbers\nthat you want to or, okay?\n\n388\n00:20:59.769 --> 00:21:07.574\nDepending on your particular placement\ninside that company as a project manager.\n\n389\n00:21:07.574 --> 00:21:12.474\nAnd if you pick a project that's actually\nassigned to you by the project management\n\n390\n00:21:12.474 --> 00:21:18.000\noffice, they may go ahead and tell you\nwhat your project number is going to be.\n\n391\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.115\nSo you might find out that\ninternally in that company,\n\n392\n00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:25.610\nyou're actually 35-135.1, okay?\n\n393\n00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:29.284\nAnd so everything in your project\nis gonna begin with 35 and\n\n394\n00:21:29.284 --> 00:21:33.475\nthen dot whatever else I said,\nI can't even remember at this point.\n\n395\n00:21:33.475 --> 00:21:37.825\n135, and then yeah,\nshe start breaking that down.\n\n396\n00:21:37.825 --> 00:21:40.270\nAnd now you might be wondering,\nwhy is that important?\n\n397\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.822\nBecause that allows for the project\nmanagement office to keep track.\n\n398\n00:21:43.822 --> 00:21:47.286\nAnd to actually know that everything\nrelated to your project is gonna\n\n399\n00:21:47.286 --> 00:21:50.402\nbegin with this particular\ncommon type of numbering system.\n\n400\n00:21:50.402 --> 00:21:52.351\nIt's good for the accounting department.\n\n401\n00:21:52.351 --> 00:21:54.340\nIt's good for everything else\nthat you're gonna be doing.\n\n402\n00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:59.108\nAnd then as you're managing multiple\nprojects, it doesn't get confused here.\n\n403\n00:21:59.108 --> 00:21:59.758\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n404\n00:21:59.758 --> 00:22:02.970\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we wanna make sure that\nwe keep track of these numbers as well.\n\n405\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.080\nSo it is your first time looking at it,\nthat's why I wanted an explanation of you.\n\n406\n00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.451\nYou're saying, yeah,\nthat's old hat, no big deal.\n\n407\n00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:11.928\nGood for you, cuz you'll be ready for\nthe exam on that, but overall though.\n\n408\n00:22:11.928 --> 00:22:14.231\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just kind of realize that's what it\n\n409\n00:22:14.231 --> 00:22:18.235\nbreaks down to is the idea of tracking and\nbeing able to refer to it fairly easily.\n\n410\n00:22:18.235 --> 00:22:20.988\nBecause sometimes even those\ntasks in between, right?\n\n411\n00:22:20.988 --> 00:22:26.368\nThey can almost be identical\nall the way up until one word.\n\n412\n00:22:26.368 --> 00:22:32.010\nSo the idea of installing servers,\nthe idea of installing operating systems.\n\n413\n00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:35.622\nWell again, notice that even\nthe beginning of those two tasks.\n\n414\n00:22:35.622 --> 00:22:38.728\nThey are different tasks, but\nthey do begin with the word installing,\n\n415\n00:22:38.728 --> 00:22:40.320\nvery easy to confuse them.\n\n416\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.496\nAdding in that number helps\nto distinguish them as well.\n\n417\n00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:46.117\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it seems a little bit of over\nkill but it really isn't, because if I'm\n\n418\n00:22:46.117 --> 00:22:49.924\na time crunch and I'm like hey, Ronnie,\ncan you go ahead and take a look at that?\n\n419\n00:22:49.924 --> 00:22:53.105\nIf I'm trying to delegate and\nI quickly give you that number,\n\n420\n00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:56.118\nit's just really clarifies\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n421\n00:22:56.118 --> 00:23:00.089\n&gt;&gt; And that's the whole key behind the\nwork breakdown structures clarification\n\n422\n00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:00.880\nfor everyone.\n\n423\n00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.846\nNow just saying that, right?\n\n424\n00:23:01.846 --> 00:23:05.142\nYou hate to say this,\nthis is like a skeleton, okay?\n\n425\n00:23:05.142 --> 00:23:08.827\nThe great thing is we're right down\nthat kind of time of year at least,\n\n426\n00:23:08.827 --> 00:23:10.451\nat the point we're recoding,\n\n427\n00:23:10.451 --> 00:23:14.150\nin which there's a lot of skeletons\nthat's gonna be walking around.\n\n428\n00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.830\nSo hopefully, you know what I\nwas talking about here, okay?\n\n429\n00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.739\nBut overall though, that's what we're\ndoing is we're setting up the skeleton for\n\n430\n00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:22.117\nthe structure of the way\nour project is going to go.\n\n431\n00:23:22.117 --> 00:23:24.661\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nI think there's even an actual tool.\n\n432\n00:23:24.661 --> 00:23:26.894\nI don't know if CompTIA\ncalls it out specifically,\n\n433\n00:23:26.894 --> 00:23:28.890\nyou might be able to help us with that.\n\n434\n00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.461\nBut it is called a fishbone diagram,\n\n435\n00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:32.602\nbecause it looks like\nthe bones of an actual fish.\n\n436\n00:23:32.602 --> 00:23:33.565\n&gt;&gt; It really does, yeah,\n\n437\n00:23:33.565 --> 00:23:36.323\nthat's a little bit more on the time\nmanagement type of thing here.\n\n438\n00:23:36.323 --> 00:23:41.190\nBut yeah, no, it does work that fishbone\nis actually another way to do some\n\n439\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.600\nof these things too.\n\n440\n00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.234\nNow the other thing that we have\nthough is there's a problem, right?\n\n441\n00:23:46.234 --> 00:23:48.576\nAs long as I understand\nwhat the breakdown is.\n\n442\n00:23:48.576 --> 00:23:51.489\nRemember that I told you that\nit actually has to have,\n\n443\n00:23:51.489 --> 00:23:55.655\nThe cost assignment's actually done,\nthe resource assignment's done.\n\n444\n00:23:55.655 --> 00:23:58.569\nThe project manager also needs to know\nabout some of the details in this and\n\n445\n00:23:58.569 --> 00:24:00.273\nwhat's also excluded from these things.\n\n446\n00:24:00.273 --> 00:24:05.736\nWell, the diagram that I showed you\ndoesn't have any of that, okay.\n\n447\n00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:09.330\nSo that means that if I were to hand\nthese diagram off the Cherokee,\n\n448\n00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:13.200\nCherokee could take,\nlet's go back to my diagram here.\n\n449\n00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.240\nAnd let's say 1.13, right,\nSetup End User Thin Clients, okay.\n\n450\n00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.220\nCherokee could take that and\ninterpret it on her own, okay.\n\n451\n00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:28.770\nTo say, this is what Ronnie means by\nSetup End User Thin Clients there, okay.\n\n452\n00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:33.118\nNow, I might not have actually told\nCherokee what I expected from there, okay.\n\n453\n00:24:33.118 --> 00:24:36.813\nSo in other words, it could be that she\ntakes that initiative on her own and\n\n454\n00:24:36.813 --> 00:24:39.640\nshe says this is how I'm gonna set it up.\n\n455\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.780\nAnd then, somebody else comes along and\n\n456\n00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.070\ngoes I don't believe that that's\nwhat Ronnie really meant.\n\n457\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.006\nAnd they start setting up\ndifferently somewhere else, okay.\n\n458\n00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.535\nSo we need something that\nreally helps to clarify okay,\n\n459\n00:24:50.535 --> 00:24:53.410\nwhat each of these things mean.\n\n460\n00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:57.300\nAnd that's when we actually move into\nwhat we call the WBS Dictionary.\n\n461\n00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:03.430\nNow, on this one, I can't tell\nyou it's not 100% on the exam.\n\n462\n00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.530\nIt's not exactly called out\non the exam objectives.\n\n463\n00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:10.141\nBut overall, though,\nyou need this to understand the WBS, okay?\n\n464\n00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:13.640\nThis is what fleshes out\nthat skeleton here, okay.\n\n465\n00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.920\nIt gives us not only the breakdown, okay.\n\n466\n00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.540\nBut it also provides a description and\n\n467\n00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.260\ninside of that dictionary okay,\nit lists every deliverable.\n\n468\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.780\nWhatever that account identifier is the\nnumbering system that we're talking about,\n\n469\n00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.820\nthe description of whatever\nwe're actually doing.\n\n470\n00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.600\nResources, cost estimates,\nacceptance criteria, you name it, okay.\n\n471\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.080\nBut essentially, this is what\nactually connects us to saying hey,\n\n472\n00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.010\nthe WBS and the statement of work,\nthis is how they actually are formed here.\n\n473\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.310\nAnd you might be wondering\nwhy is that important, okay.\n\n474\n00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.500\nSo that's why we actually wanna take\na look at this a little bit more.\n\n475\n00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.440\nOkay, so Cherokee, any question?\n\n476\n00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.490\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm doing\npretty good at this point.\n\n477\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:54.940\nIt's kind of like our WBS dictionary\nis our little pocket dictionary.\n\n478\n00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.808\nI wanna keep it on hand,\nso we can make heads or\n\n479\n00:25:56.808 --> 00:25:59.030\ntails out of exactly\nwhat we're doing here.\n\n480\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nlet's show you a couple of examples.\n\n481\n00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.859\nI know we're coming close to\nthe end of our time together, but\n\n482\n00:26:03.859 --> 00:26:05.998\nlet's just show you just\na couple of examples here.\n\n483\n00:26:05.998 --> 00:26:09.850\nNow the great thing is,\nI know this is kind of unusual.\n\n484\n00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:11.800\nAt least for me, I think it's unusual.\n\n485\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.200\nBut I pulled this one up\njust on the Internet here.\n\n486\n00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.335\nAnd this is from the Department\nof Housing, okay,\n\n487\n00:26:17.335 --> 00:26:21.080\ntthe US Department of Housing and\nUrban Development here.\n\n488\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.630\nAnd they really do have a complete here,\n\n489\n00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.470\nProject Planning and\nManagement version 2.0.\n\n490\n00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.912\nThis is their WBS Dictionary whenever\nthey've been working on a project.\n\n491\n00:26:33.912 --> 00:26:36.159\nAnd they're working on one called-\n&gt;&gt; Does it tell you how many\n\n492\n00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:36.872\npages is on there?\n\n493\n00:26:36.872 --> 00:26:38.056\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot, okay.\n\n494\n00:26:38.056 --> 00:26:39.507\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, so\n\n495\n00:26:39.507 --> 00:26:43.029\nthis one actually is quite a few pages,\n1 of 29 so far.\n\n496\n00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:44.051\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n497\n00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:45.212\n&gt;&gt; Now we're not gonna go over everything.\n\n498\n00:26:45.212 --> 00:26:48.718\nBut here is just a basic table of\ncontents, so it's a fairly long document.\n\n499\n00:26:48.718 --> 00:26:53.839\nBut I wanna do is get down just\nan example of this idea, okay.\n\n500\n00:26:53.839 --> 00:26:58.217\nSo here notice they have the description,\nthey have the element here and\n\n501\n00:26:58.217 --> 00:26:59.957\nthey have what we need here.\n\n502\n00:26:59.957 --> 00:27:02.310\nNow, you might wondering\nwhy this is important?\n\n503\n00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.700\nIt's important because of the example\nthat I was using with Cherokee.\n\n504\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.840\nIf Cherokee really does\nhave a misunderstanding, or\n\n505\n00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.656\nif two people have a misunderstanding\nabout what established the project sponsor\n\n506\n00:27:13.656 --> 00:27:17.232\nor determined the project IT,\nwhatever it might be, okay.\n\n507\n00:27:17.232 --> 00:27:18.980\nComplete the project initiation form.\n\n508\n00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.990\nThat's a good one,\ncuz thing is gigantic, okay.\n\n509\n00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.687\nIf they're not sure exactly what that\nmeans, they don't always have to wait for\n\n510\n00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:27.239\nme to come out of a meeting, okay.\n\n511\n00:27:27.239 --> 00:27:29.656\nThey don't have to wait for\nme to respond to an email,\n\n512\n00:27:29.656 --> 00:27:32.480\nsaying what's actually gonna be clarified.\n\n513\n00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.850\nI should simply have this WBS dictionary\nmade available to them, okay.\n\n514\n00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:44.470\nAnd then this essentially allows them\nto see how it was defined, okay.\n\n515\n00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:49.210\nSo that way, if there is a clarification\nthat needs to be made between two of my\n\n516\n00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:55.700\nteam members or even between two\nseparate project team leaders.\n\n517\n00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.490\nWell, guess what?\n\n518\n00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.692\nIt's right here, that separation\nshould be able to be done and they\n\n519\n00:27:59.692 --> 00:28:04.040\nshould be able to refer to this, because\neverybody will have the same guide, okay.\n\n520\n00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.681\nSo it's not like Cherokee's\ngonna have version 3.0,\n\n521\n00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:10.513\nand Tom is gonna have version 2.0, okay.\n\n522\n00:28:10.513 --> 00:28:14.998\nThey should have the same one and be able\nto help distinguish that and that's really\n\n523\n00:28:14.998 --> 00:28:18.857\nwhat the dictionary helps us to do and\nto be able to clarify that as well.\n\n524\n00:28:18.857 --> 00:28:22.256\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it looks like that's a lot\nof work, but I could definitely see\n\n525\n00:28:22.256 --> 00:28:25.321\nthe benefits of doing a little bit\nof extra prep work to go ahead and\n\n526\n00:28:25.321 --> 00:28:27.724\nsave time once your projects\nalready kicked off.\n\n527\n00:28:27.724 --> 00:28:29.698\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is no doubt\nthat it really does help.\n\n528\n00:28:29.698 --> 00:28:33.735\nBut the problem is, right, if you've never\ndone it before, it's really scary to try\n\n529\n00:28:33.735 --> 00:28:36.628\nand go, I need to complete\nan entire glossary for my project?\n\n530\n00:28:36.628 --> 00:28:38.560\nIn theory, yes, okay.\n\n531\n00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.190\nBut this is where your project team\nhelps during the planning is that,\n\n532\n00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:46.310\nthis is where I go to Cherokee and say all\nright, Cherokee for the task that I have\n\n533\n00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.025\nassigned to you, you've completed\nyour WBS dictionary too, right?\n\n534\n00:28:50.025 --> 00:28:52.474\nAnd Cherokee says, absolutely [LAUGH].\n\n535\n00:28:52.474 --> 00:28:54.216\nAnd then she returns that in,\n\n536\n00:28:54.216 --> 00:28:59.100\nand then I include that into my compendium\nof all of those WBS dictionaries.\n\n537\n00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.380\nAnd then that's reviewed and accepted or I\nactually go Cherokee, I need more details\n\n538\n00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.000\non this before I can include that\ninto the official project plan.\n\n539\n00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.240\nNow the great thing is there's templates,\nokay.\n\n540\n00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.430\nSo let me show you another one\nthat's actually out there for\n\n541\n00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.770\nyou that will help you out, as well.\n\n542\n00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.480\nSo you can go out and\n\n543\n00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.380\nsearch for WBS structure dictionary\ntemplates if you want to.\n\n544\n00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.763\nAnd so here's one, this one is from\nthe CDC, the Centers of Disease Control.\n\n545\n00:29:22.763 --> 00:29:25.085\nI know, don't ask me why,\nI don't have a clue.\n\n546\n00:29:25.085 --> 00:29:29.903\nBut they even show you versions here of\nhow many versions of this dictionary can\n\n547\n00:29:29.903 --> 00:29:31.294\nactually be in place.\n\n548\n00:29:31.294 --> 00:29:35.000\nNow, that's actually key,\nbecause you will have documents updated.\n\n549\n00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.400\nSo everybody needs to have\nthe proper version or\n\n550\n00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.330\nthey have to have the appendix\nthat comes out to help them out.\n\n551\n00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.950\nSo just kinda realize that you might\nactually end up seeing that as well.\n\n552\n00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:45.580\nBut then, they break it down,\n\n553\n00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.190\nthey show of course some of\nthe elements of how you use it.\n\n554\n00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.850\nBut here it is, here are the definitions\nthat you actually have and\n\n555\n00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:52.950\nwhat's normally included in that.\n\n556\n00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.440\nLet me zoom in just a little bit there.\n\n557\n00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.300\nWBS Code, the element and\nthe element description itself and\n\n558\n00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.320\nthen of course, any other documentation\nthat we may be referring to\n\n559\n00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.640\nsuch as some type of regulation, some type\nof other standard that we have out there.\n\n560\n00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.500\nAll that also needs to be\nincluded into the idea\n\n561\n00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.340\nof everything that we have in terms of\nthat work breakdown dictionary as well,\n\n562\n00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.850\nbecause it's very important that we\nhave all of that criteria right there.\n\n563\n00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.560\nNow in these that they show,\n\n564\n00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.230\nright, they're not as detailed\nas what I was listing before.\n\n565\n00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.910\nLet me see if I can pull that diagram\nup where it has all of these.\n\n566\n00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.070\nBut normally, traditionally you have this.\n\n567\n00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.170\nNow you'll probably not see this\nparticular description anymore.\n\n568\n00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.240\nThis was actually in an earlier\nversion of the PMBOK,\n\n569\n00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.690\nit no longer appeared in the fourth and\nfifth edition anymore.\n\n570\n00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:47.930\nSo even this has kind of gone away but\nthe concept of using a WBS has not.\n\n571\n00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:52.022\nSo even though they don't say you have to\nlist all these things out anymore, really\n\n572\n00:30:52.022 --> 00:30:56.186\ntoday it's more of a description to help\npeople if there's any type of discretion.\n\n573\n00:30:56.186 --> 00:30:58.324\nNo, what do I wanna say, discrepancy.\n\n574\n00:30:58.324 --> 00:30:59.241\n&gt;&gt; Discrepancies.\n\n575\n00:30:59.241 --> 00:30:59.926\n&gt;&gt; Discrepancies.\n\n576\n00:30:59.926 --> 00:31:01.762\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See I was trying to get the word out,\n\n577\n00:31:01.762 --> 00:31:02.562\nit just wasn't working.\n\n578\n00:31:02.562 --> 00:31:07.097\nDiscrepancy, then this is where they\ngo to help break that kind of tie\n\n579\n00:31:07.097 --> 00:31:08.668\nbreaker to help us out.\n\n580\n00:31:08.668 --> 00:31:12.068\nSo WBS and WBS Dictionary go hand in hand,\n\n581\n00:31:12.068 --> 00:31:15.869\nyou really can't have\none without the other.\n\n582\n00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.120\n&gt;&gt; I think that about does it today.\n\n583\n00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.990\nWe're here on time, a good place to stop.\n\n584\n00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:24.470\nRonnie, you did a great job of\nexplaining how to go ahead and\n\n585\n00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:28.060\ndesign and\nexecute our project schedules and\n\n586\n00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.900\nhow we can actually implement our work\nbreakdown structure, the importance of it.\n\n587\n00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.300\nYou've given us some really great\nanalogies, thank you for that.\n\n588\n00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.760\nAnd diagrams, also templates,\nlike you just were showing us.\n\n589\n00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.140\nSo guys, just keep mind the templates\nare out there available online.\n\n590\n00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.130\nAnd of course, you gonna really need\nto find one that works best for\n\n591\n00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:45.760\nyour organization.\n\n592\n00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.090\nBut I think that's about it for today.\n\n593\n00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.840\nSigning off, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n594\n00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n595\n00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.599\n&gt;&gt; Have a great day and\nthank you for tuning in.\n\n596\n00:31:53.599 --> 00:32:00.206\n[MUSIC]\n\n597\n00:32:00.206 --> 00:32:03.085\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

00:00:12.082\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.670\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.860\nIf you've been following along and\nstudying with our CompTIA Project+ shows,\n\n7\n00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.150\nyou know that we just looked at how to\nexecute and design our project schedule.\n\n8\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.940\nNow we need to go ahead and\ntake a further look at that, so\n\n9\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.540\nwe know that we're ready to go ahead and\nmake our project schedule.\n\n10\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.460\nWe know how we wanna design\nour work breakdown structure.\n\n11\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.315\nBut how do we go ahead and start, Ronnie?\n\n12\n00:00:37.315 --> 00:00:40.000\nWhere do we need to start, and\nwhat do we need to make it work?\n\n13\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.810\n&gt;&gt; Well when we start to take\na look then at the idea here, and\n\n14\n00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.940\nCompTIA's Project Plus, about making\nsure we can design the schedule, right.\n\n15\n00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.670\nThe great thing is, if I can\nactually get words out of my mouth,\n\n16\n00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.010\nif I have my work breakdown\nstructure already created.\n\n17\n00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.380\nNow I need to get into\nthe true arena of scheduling.\n\n18\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.700\nNow there are people out there that\nare masters at scheduling things that need\n\n19\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.600\nto be done.\n\n20\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.590\nFor me it's as simple as looking\nat a calendar and saying,\n\n21\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.360\nI have an appointment that day.\n\n22\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.410\nAnd that is at the heart and\n\n23\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.770\nbasis of normally things that we\nneed to do and get accomplished.\n\n24\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.450\nBut it comes down to a project here, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.300\nWe not only have to be able to talk\nabout the idea of scheduling in terms of\n\n26\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.610\ntime, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.890\nAs far as a date goes, okay.\n\n28\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.850\nBut we need to also be able to\ntrack things like duration as well.\n\n29\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.090\nAnd then work hours too.\n\n30\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.650\nSo now, all of sudden, it becomes a little\nbit more challenging in that task and\n\n31\n00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.640\nin that duty.\n\n32\n00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.540\nEspecially if I'm doing it using,\nlet's say,\n\n33\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.108\njust a regular, a calendar of some sort.\n\n34\n00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:49.860\nEven one of those big desk calendars that\nyou have, not saying it can't be done.\n\n35\n00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.310\nPeople have done project management that\nway for years and years and years but\n\n36\n00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.610\nnow today we have what we\ncall PMIS types of software.\n\n37\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.590\nAnd that means Project Management\nIntegration Software, is what we have.\n\n38\n00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.900\nAnd that means that what they do is they\ntake multiple components together and\n\n39\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.142\npull them into one piece of software that\nwill help to do everything that I was\n\n40\n00:02:14.142 --> 00:02:15.090\ntalking about.\n\n41\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.920\nAnd be able to manage it all\nfrom one location instead.\n\n42\n00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.572\nAnd there's many piece of software\nthat's out there like that.\n\n43\n00:02:21.572 --> 00:02:25.400\nAnd it depends on the size and scope of\nyour project, and how much money you're\n\n44\n00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.430\nactually willing to spend on this stuff,\nto decide which one you're gonna use.\n\n45\n00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.742\n&gt;&gt; Especially for industries that utilize\nSCOTUS systems, if that have any kind\n\n46\n00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:37.740\nof valve systems, any kind of remote\ntelemetry that's going on there.\n\n47\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.920\nSo it just kind of\nintegrates all together.\n\n48\n00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.650\nIt really does.\n\n49\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.140\nIt helps because those, certain types\nof software of course are designed for\n\n50\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.400\ncertain industries.\n\n51\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.180\nBut there's actually general and\n\n52\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.560\nvery generic types of project management\nsoftware that's out there as well.\n\n53\n00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.930\nAnd you can find them ranging from\nfree products all the way to well,\n\n54\n00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.600\nfairly expensive products.\n\n55\n00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.940\nI'm gonna choose to want\nto make a demonstration,\n\n56\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.260\nthe one that I am most familiar with,\nwhich is Microsoft's Project instead.\n\n57\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.740\nAnd that's because that's the one that\nI've really used over time in terms of\n\n58\n00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.060\nproject management.\n\n59\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.859\nAnd it's the one that I feel like that's\nreally gonna give you still the same\n\n60\n00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.357\nactivities that you'll normally see.\n\n61\n00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:15.027\nAnd the same feel of things that you have\nto accomplish when you start setting up\n\n62\n00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:16.080\na schedule.\n\n63\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.630\nBut we're gonna show you\nthat Microsoft also, and\n\n64\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.360\nthis is not a Microsoft show, of course.\n\n65\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.880\nBut where they've actually\ntaken a little bit of time and\n\n66\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.540\ninitiative to make it easier for\na project manager to\n\n67\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.860\nmanage your project, by using\nMicrosoft Project, which is their product.\n\n68\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.160\nAnd the way that it actually begins to\nwork is fairly neat, at least for me,\n\n69\n00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.280\nthat's what I have thought in the past.\n\n70\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.640\nSo let's go ahead and get started here.\n\n71\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.032\nSo I'm gonna bring up Microsoft Project\non my computer, and so\n\n72\n00:03:45.032 --> 00:03:46.955\nthere it is, I'm gonna launch it.\n\n73\n00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:48.899\nAnd it's actually simply\ngoing to come up and\n\n74\n00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.250\nit's gonna ask me what it is I want to do.\n\n75\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.360\nAnd let me just go in and pick one.\n\n76\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.280\nI'm just gonna pick-\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\n\n77\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.910\nI noticed from this menu here,\nit looks like we can go ahead and\n\n78\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.030\nintegrate a lot of different\nthings such as Excel spreadsheets.\n\n79\n00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.660\nOne thing that I really love that's\nalso a Microsoft product would\n\n80\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.180\nbe Microsoft Visio.\n\n81\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.030\nSo are we able to go ahead and really,\n\n82\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.060\nit looks like they have some\ngood integrations set up here.\n\n83\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.790\nWell, they do.\n\n84\n00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.550\nThey allow you to pull information\nfrom a lot of different sources here.\n\n85\n00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.120\nExcel's actually the easy one because\na lot of people do use Excel for\n\n86\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.210\ntheir project management instead.\n\n87\n00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.280\nHere they're trying to show you\nthat at least at the beginning that\n\n88\n00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.320\nyou do have some options.\n\n89\n00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.500\nRight here, they have several templates is\nwhat they also have where we can do that.\n\n90\n00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.335\nAnd I'm just trying to find,\nlet's use the simple project plan.\n\n91\n00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:36.760\nAnd we'll create one right here,\ntoo, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.420\nNow when we talk simplistic,\nthey just went ahead and\n\n93\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.730\nmade the most generic\nproject they possibly can.\n\n94\n00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.655\nAnd we're gonna get rid of some,\nnot extraneous but\n\n95\n00:04:44.655 --> 00:04:47.080\na little bit of the fancy features.\n\n96\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.080\nSo, that we can set up and\nsee what we need to do.\n\n97\n00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.090\nSo, when it comes down to the very\nbeginning okay, of what starts to happen.\n\n98\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.700\nOnce you have your work break down\nstructure, you can now start to use this\n\n99\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.040\nportion over here as an Excel\nspreadsheet if you want to, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.278\nBut, it allows us to go ahead and\nmake entries such as our task.\n\n101\n00:05:08.278 --> 00:05:13.716\nNow summary task one and two and three,\nnormally this would kind of be our\n\n102\n00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:19.990\nsecond level or our top level breakdown\nof our WBS that we might enter in there.\n\n103\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.900\nAnd then these other tasks\nthat are indented in between,\n\n104\n00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.380\nnormally become our sub-tasks, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.140\nIn other words, that smaller WBS package,\nwork package that we have.\n\n106\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.530\nNotice the duration is also shown here.\n\n107\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.670\nAnd the start and finish date to those.\n\n108\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.576\nAnd this actually does have it rolled\nup where summary task number one,\n\n109\n00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:46.917\neven though it starts on Friday the 21st,\nand ends on Thursday the 27th.\n\n110\n00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:49.720\nI was trying to make sure that we\nzoom in so that we can see that.\n\n111\n00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.434\nWe really didn't have to\nactually know all those dates.\n\n112\n00:05:52.434 --> 00:05:55.451\nOkay, all we needed to know was\nactually to be able to set,\n\n113\n00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:59.720\nthe very beginning here of what we call,\nour baselines, to help us out.\n\n114\n00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.720\nNow, when we've looked a little\nbit at another episode,\n\n115\n00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.930\nwhere we talked about cost baselines,\nright.\n\n116\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.810\nWhere it shows how much money we\nexpend over the period of our project.\n\n117\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.890\nWe showed you a chart that\nhelps us out to do that.\n\n118\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.400\nAnd that's set up for comparison so\nthat as we start having actual cost,\n\n119\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.300\nwe can compare it to the base line.\n\n120\n00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.970\nBut when you first start\nwith Microsoft Project here.\n\n121\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.890\nLet me do this other thing.\n\n122\n00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.090\nI'm just gonna open up a blank project and\n\n123\n00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.780\nshow you what happens at\nthe very beginning, okay.\n\n124\n00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.360\nThe first thing that you have to do is\nreally almost set up a baseline as well.\n\n125\n00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.421\nYou click on information over here and\nthe first bit of information that you want\n\n126\n00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:47.857\nis what your project is gonna be named so\nhere I'm just gonna call it Project 001.\n\n127\n00:06:47.857 --> 00:06:53.410\nOkay, I know a great long, very creative\nname but it's not really that creative.\n\n128\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.410\nAnd then, it actually asked me for\ntwo things.\n\n129\n00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.070\nOkay and it actually only\nneeds one of these two things.\n\n130\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.330\nOkay, so it's saying hey, what date\nwould you like to start on, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.240\nSo in other words, once I set this date,\nso let's say that I want to start this on,\n\n132\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.974\nWe'll do the, I know it's kinda weird,\n\n133\n00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:16.670\nbut October 31st is actually kinda\nthe same week as November begins.\n\n134\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:23.340\nSo let's start on a Monday, October 31st\nhere, as of this particular recording.\n\n135\n00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.510\nAnd notice that I could go ahead and\nput in a finish date, at this point too.\n\n136\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.950\nNow, I'm not gonna go ahead and\nput in a finish date right now and\n\n137\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.373\nthen I'm gonna click OK.\n\n138\n00:07:32.373 --> 00:07:37.570\nAnd once I do, okay, you can see where\nit starts filling in information for me.\n\n139\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.000\nIt went ahead and said, hey,\nhere's the date you're going to start.\n\n140\n00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.710\nNow, if I start to, let me see if\nI can zoom out a little bit here.\n\n141\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.509\nSo I can add in,\nlet's say this is gonna be, Subtask,\n\n142\n00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:57.426\nlet's just call it task,\nTask number 1 at this point.\n\n143\n00:07:57.426 --> 00:08:02.436\nThis can also be A particular task\nthat I add in and now when you start\n\n144\n00:08:02.436 --> 00:08:08.160\nto actually add in stuff, it will also\nhelp you by rolling these tasks up.\n\n145\n00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.880\nAnd so I wanted to just show you\nat the least the beginning here.\n\n146\n00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.530\nAnd show you what's happened, okay.\n\n147\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.160\nSo notice that this top one\nhere is actually bolded.\n\n148\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.970\nAnd so when they added in task number one\nand they said that was two days that was\n\n149\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.000\nfine so, if I know that task and the one\nwas supposed to take me three days.\n\n150\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.180\nWell, all I had to do is come in here and\ntype then three day and\n\n151\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.440\nnow noticed it changes the summary okay.\n\n152\n00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.670\nThen task number two, let's say that it\nsupposed take me five days that changes\n\n153\n00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:42.000\nand all these places that are actually\nmarked in blue here start just change.\n\n154\n00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.290\nAnd that all started when I did\nhave just a project start date.\n\n155\n00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.500\nWe didn't have to enter in any\nof these additional dates here.\n\n156\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.030\nThe software was able to calculate that\nout and as I start adding in tasks and\n\n157\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.080\nestimates in there,\nit will start to calculate out start and\n\n158\n00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.640\nfinish dates for everything that I have.\n\n159\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.070\nAnd then at this point I also would\nneed to add in some resources.\n\n160\n00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:11.230\nSo I can add in some additional resources\nover here, by clicking on this drop down,\n\n161\n00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.590\nand if there was resources that\nare listed they would show up here,\n\n162\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.520\nbut if they're not here it means I\nwould need to go to a different sheet,\n\n163\n00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.810\nwhich is called resources.\n\n164\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.360\nAnd then select assign resources and\nI don't have any resource names here.\n\n165\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.150\nSo I would actually need to create\nresources and then assign them in there.\n\n166\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.500\nAnd then that would start to change as\nwell based on their work data as well.\n\n167\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.640\nSo it really does help to actually\nhave the resource assignments and\n\n168\n00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.120\nto allocate those resources\nthat are available.\n\n169\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.910\nAnd once your have that set up before any\nwork is done during your planning then,\n\n170\n00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.950\nthere's a way inside Microsoft Project,\nthat what you can do is then take\n\n171\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:52.310\na snapshot of this entire project and\nset it as a baseline, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.790\nSo here, let's say that this\nis the baseline, I click set.\n\n173\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:01.530\nAnd now I create a baseline, and\nthen once my project starts being used,\n\n174\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.730\nI can now create a report based on\nthe baseline, versus also what the actual\n\n175\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.630\nstuff is gonna be as I update\nall of these durations and\n\n176\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:17.160\nthe time elements that are also involved\ninside of what we tend to see, okay.\n\n177\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.930\nSo there is a lot of information\nthat we can take a look at\n\n178\n00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.280\nwhen we start to do this.\n\n179\n00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.940\nNow the other thing that we also have\nto determine is what is gonna be\n\n180\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.360\nhow we count the duration itself, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.630\nMicrosoft Project, by default,\nuses the terms days, but\n\n182\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.990\nyou can change this if you needed to,\nto let's say four hours.\n\n183\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.380\nSo if I wanted to, I could do four hours.\n\n184\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.460\nAll right, so\nI can actually change not only to hours,\n\n185\n00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.560\nbut I can also change it\nto minutes if I wanted to.\n\n186\n00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.670\nIf I can ever stop double\nclicking on anything 15 minutes.\n\n187\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.250\nAnd notice that I can track all\nthe way down to minutes, hours, days.\n\n188\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.840\nAnd even at some point here I want to come\ndown here so that we can even see months.\n\n189\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.910\nSo I could actually do six months.\n\n190\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.340\nNotice that I can do that and even years.\n\n191\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.560\nSo that would be silly on this one,\ncuz it doesn't make any sense.\n\n192\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.530\nLet's see, why is that all I have to do,\n\n193\n00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.190\nit doesn't like that on\nthat particular duration.\n\n194\n00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.420\nSo I was hoping I could, but\napparently it does not want me to do that.\n\n195\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.520\nSo it actually allows me to do at\nleast minutes, hours, and days.\n\n196\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.430\nAnd probably even weeks if we wanted to.\n\n197\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.540\nLet's see if six weeks will work.\n\n198\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.860\nNope, so it allows that.\n\n199\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.770\nBut at one point it actually allowed\nyou to do years if you wanted to and\n\n200\n00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.720\nmonths and weeks.\n\n201\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.950\nSo now it actually has a breakdown, so if\nyou say I don't really need a whole day,\n\n202\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.600\nyou can actually make it smaller.\n\n203\n00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.760\nNeed just a couple of hours.\n\n204\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.070\nYou can do that and you need minutes.\n\n205\n00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.460\nYou can even break down to that\nparticular assignment as well.\n\n206\n00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.980\nSo this is actually where it becomes very\nimportant that you have as much as you can\n\n207\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.100\nestimating those durations\nto as close as possible\n\n208\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.310\nto be able to help you to figure\nthose things out too, okay?\n\n209\n00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:10.100\nNow the other thing that we can also do is\nonce we can do something like this, right?\n\n210\n00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.880\nNotice that I don't now have to\nactually track the resource.\n\n211\n00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.230\nAll the resource information would\nbe entered into Microsoft project,\n\n212\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.050\nI can now track the duration\nof a particular task.\n\n213\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.430\nI can track when a task actually\nstarts and supposed to finish as well.\n\n214\n00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:29.400\nWe can do all of that information\nfrom one piece of software.\n\n215\n00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.790\nIf not, I would need at\nleast an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n216\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.430\nI would need some calendaring system, so\n\n217\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.910\nit could use something like\nMicrosoft Outlook if I wanted to.\n\n218\n00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.910\nI would need a task list of some sort,\n\n219\n00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.690\nto ensure that I put everything\ndown at the same time.\n\n220\n00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.770\nI would also need to be able to work\nwith scheduling coordinators to\n\n221\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.880\ndo everything that I need to do to verify\nthat the resources weren't over allocated.\n\n222\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.120\nThere's a ton of different things that,\nright here,\n\n223\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.200\nin a single application that helps\nus to determine that as well.\n\n224\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.250\nSo, here that actually does help us to\ndetermine the overall duration of things,\n\n225\n00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.580\nas we start to, to see things here.\n\n226\n00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.940\nSo we'll actually end up,\n\n227\n00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.770\nlet me see if I can scroll up to\nthe top on this particular one.\n\n228\n00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.090\nIt actually does just\nbegin that summary task.\n\n229\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.800\nThere's a lot of times where\nyou can create a project\n\n230\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.620\ntask that will essentially\nroll up everything and\n\n231\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.330\nshow you like the overall\nduration of the entire project.\n\n232\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.070\nThis one is not created inside\nof the template itself, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:29.350\nNow once you have those things set up and\nno work has actually begun,\n\n234\n00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.310\nthis is were you begin adding in what\nwe call milestones into your project.\n\n235\n00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.090\nNow we've talked about this\nin the previous episode\n\n236\n00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.220\nwhere we were able to\nessentially take anything okay.\n\n237\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.140\nAnd say here's where we make a go and\nno go decision, okay.\n\n238\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.520\nWhether the project's gonna proceed or\n\n239\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.670\nwhether it's not gonna\nproceed from this point.\n\n240\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.570\nAnd the nice thing is,\nthey actually even have one right here for\n\n241\n00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.790\nus as a demonstration.\n\n242\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.300\nSo on task number four,\nnotice that this one has zero duration.\n\n243\n00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.400\nMicrosoft Project automatically sets this\nand you can see where the difference in\n\n244\n00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.770\nthe color is which is going to be well,\na black diamond.\n\n245\n00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.930\nAnd that is actually a project\ntask that has no duration and\n\n246\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.780\nthe way that this is describing\nit is that this is a summary\n\n247\n00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.363\nof the number one task that's\nactually to be completed here,okay.\n\n248\n00:14:18.363 --> 00:14:22.330\nSo,that's what we tend to have when we\nstart to see that, and that milestone\n\n249\n00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.470\nagain gives us that little break and don't\nactually cost any time, it actually says\n\n250\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.360\nhere's what is going to take for us to go\nahead and make sure that we have a place\n\n251\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.160\nthat we can mark in our project here\nto say what the milestone is gonna be.\n\n252\n00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.120\nAnd you can set that up throughout\nyour entire project schedule\n\n253\n00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.970\nas you choose to do something\nlike this as well, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.330\nSo there's a lot of information that\nwe can jam into one product and\n\n255\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.570\nthe neat thing is it can keep track of\nit all and it can adjust if for us.\n\n256\n00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.080\nSo that when we start to take a look at\nhow long something is actually going to\n\n257\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.830\ntake, or\n\n258\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.970\nwhen we should finish a particular task\nby, I have it by every single task.\n\n259\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.960\nAnd then at the very end at this point I\nnotice that my latest date is actually\n\n260\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:08.070\ngoing to be Monday of November 14th,\n\n261\n00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:12.050\n2016, down here,\nwhich is my final date so far.\n\n262\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.930\nBut as I add i more information all\nthat will actually readjust and\n\n263\n00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.880\nas I change more information\nthat's what will also happen.\n\n264\n00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.930\nAnd actually I'm even lying to you,\nthere's 126 days, and then for\n\n265\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.210\nsix months, so\nactually April 17th instead.\n\n266\n00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.060\n&gt;&gt; And this is pretty awesome.\n\n267\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.170\nIf you had something like Office\n365 set up you could go ahead and\n\n268\n00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:32.180\nmake changes to your documents,\nand pretty much in real time,\n\n269\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.770\nother employees are to able\nto access your changes and\n\n270\n00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.060\nthe shared information that you\nhave throughout organization there.\n\n271\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's so much more and\nthis is were I would you know,\n\n272\n00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:46.040\nI would recommend that if your gonna\nhey I've never seen that product before\n\n273\n00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.240\ncan I learn more about it.\n\n274\n00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.823\nYou can, you can go to ITPro Tv library\nand there's actually a whole show.\n\n275\n00:15:50.823 --> 00:15:54.356\nOn Microsoft Project, at least to get\nyou through that introductory level and\n\n276\n00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:56.991\nunderstanding, how you can\nmanage it more effectively.\n\n277\n00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:57.807\nHere we're not.\n\n278\n00:15:57.807 --> 00:15:59.227\nWe're not trying to teach you the product.\n\n279\n00:15:59.227 --> 00:16:01.496\nAnd that's why I'm just trying\nto hit the highlights overall.\n\n280\n00:16:01.496 --> 00:16:04.720\nBut just realize that you can use\nsomething like this to help you out.\n\n281\n00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.500\nTraditionally, you'd need\nmultiple tools to do so instead.\n\n282\n00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:14.400\nNow there comes another issue with\nmanaging projects the old fashioned way,\n\n283\n00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.756\nwhich is by using pen and paper, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:16.756 --> 00:16:21.000\nAnd that is, it's very difficult for\nus to see what tasks\n\n285\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.280\nactually depend on a particular task and\nwhat tasks don't.\n\n286\n00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.580\nSo let me show you what I'm talking\nabout here and what you're seeing, okay.\n\n287\n00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.050\nSo notice that I have\nthis entire column here.\n\n288\n00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:33.320\nAnd this particular column,\n\n289\n00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.250\nlet's see if I can zoom in again,\nit is called Predecessors, okay.\n\n290\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.220\nSo in terms of predecessors,\nit's very difficult for\n\n291\n00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.650\nyou to see this until I scoot this over.\n\n292\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.790\nAnd now you start seeing these bars here.\n\n293\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.830\nAnd let me see if I can,\nI'm gonna zoom out on the bar so\n\n294\n00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.660\nthat we can see it just\na little bit better.\n\n295\n00:16:56.621 --> 00:17:00.380\nTrying to make it so that we can see and\nunderstand, there you go, okay.\n\n296\n00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.540\nSo there's not a lot to activities\non this very generic thing.\n\n297\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.000\nBut it allows you to see what actually\nis dependent on other things,\n\n298\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.690\nokay, based on a time element.\n\n299\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.550\nSo in the way that this is\nactually showing up here, okay.\n\n300\n00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.100\nYou actually do realize something,\n\n301\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:22.270\nthat this particular task here cannot\nbegin until the other one finishes, okay.\n\n302\n00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.100\nAnd the same thing we have throughout\nthis project, so take a look at this\n\n303\n00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.700\nlong blue bar here and-\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, just to harken what what\n\n304\n00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.720\nyou were talking about earlier,\nthat example of the paint drying.\n\n305\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.270\nSo would this relate as far\nas our predecessors here?\n\n306\n00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.300\n&gt;&gt; It can, it actually does show\nyou that something like that\n\n307\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.380\ncan affect your schedule,\nand there's reasons why.\n\n308\n00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.450\nNow, lets talk about how do we\nactually break that down and\n\n309\n00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.600\nhow do we actually\nchange things like that.\n\n310\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.700\nSo here, I'm gonna switch\nutilities here just for a moment.\n\n311\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.670\nTo help us out so that we can see how\nit normally is displayed in a project\n\n312\n00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.380\nmanagement information system.\n\n313\n00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.390\nI think I said integration system earlier\non, but it's actually information system.\n\n314\n00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.316\nSo, when you tend to see those bars,\n\n315\n00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:07.436\nhere's what I'm representing\nright here are those bars.\n\n316\n00:18:07.436 --> 00:18:09.158\nEach one of those bars and\n\n317\n00:18:09.158 --> 00:18:13.210\nthe length of them represents\na duration to a task, okay.\n\n318\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.480\nSo when you have multiple\ntasks inside of your project,\n\n319\n00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.090\nyou're going to link them all together so\nthat it forms one big project.\n\n320\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.350\nSo there are really four different\nstyles here as we start to take a look\n\n321\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.210\nto show up.\n\n322\n00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.150\nSo here it is.\n\n323\n00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.080\nWhen you start to see this the first\none right here is actually what we call\n\n324\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.260\nfinish to start.\n\n325\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:41.070\nNow in the finish to start type of\npredecessor or dependency here okay.\n\n326\n00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.370\nLet me show you what goes on on this one,\nokay.\n\n327\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.220\nSo what we normally do is that\nwe link these tasks together.\n\n328\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.860\nSo there's a couple of things that\nhave to happen in a finish to start.\n\n329\n00:18:56.983 --> 00:18:59.653\nI'm going to make that a little bit\nbigger so that we can see it and\n\n330\n00:18:59.653 --> 00:19:00.800\nI'll make it a solid line.\n\n331\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.250\nThere we go, okay, so\nwhat is this really saying here, okay?\n\n332\n00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.470\nWell, because of the way that\nthe language is, okay, you and\n\n333\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.980\nI would say things, I think, okay.\n\n334\n00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.580\nAt least here in the United States,\nthis is how we would say it, okay?\n\n335\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.380\nTask A here or B or whatever it is, okay.\n\n336\n00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.933\nThe first task has to finish, okay,\n\n337\n00:19:20.933 --> 00:19:25.930\ncompletely before\nthe second task can begin.\n\n338\n00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.160\nOkay, so that sounds normal, okay.\n\n339\n00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.740\nNow in project management\nit's never like that.\n\n340\n00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.680\nThere's never such a thing this is\nthe way that normal people speak, right?\n\n341\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.060\nSo the way that this actually says it,\nnotice it says Finish to Start,\n\n342\n00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.408\nit really says this.\n\n343\n00:19:40.408 --> 00:19:43.925\nBefore task b here, this blue bar,\n\n344\n00:19:43.925 --> 00:19:48.980\ncan begin it's task, task a must finish.\n\n345\n00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.650\nStill saying the same thing that\nI had said a little bit earlier.\n\n346\n00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:52.950\nBut that's the proper terms and\n\n347\n00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.490\nwhat they're talking about\nhere is a predecessor.\n\n348\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.300\nSo what is this relationship\nto a predecessor and\n\n349\n00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.690\nthat's how these bars are normally\ndone when you start to see this, okay.\n\n350\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:07.250\nSo when you actually have something\nlike that, you're like okay.\n\n351\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.090\nThat actually makes sense that\nthis has to completely finish.\n\n352\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.800\nJust like we're talking\nabout paint drying.\n\n353\n00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Before the second coat can go on.\n\n354\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.430\n&gt;&gt; So this may be a little\nbit of a silly question.\n\n355\n00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.710\nBut would you go ahead and\n\n356\n00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:21.560\ndefine that second activity as\na successor or is that a term they use?\n\n357\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do use the term successor\nas well, so you do have that,\n\n358\n00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.840\nor you call it a dependency as well.\n\n359\n00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.170\nThat it is dependant upon\nthe first task finishing.\n\n360\n00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.630\nSo it really does depend on what project\nmanagement terms you come from and\n\n361\n00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.830\nyour background that\nyou're gonna find out.\n\n362\n00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.740\nIn Microsoft Project,\nthey're called dependencies and\n\n363\n00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.940\npredecessors is what\nthey tend to be called.\n\n364\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.090\n&gt;&gt; We're looking here at this diagram and\nwe have different types of predecessors\n\n365\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.180\nand dependencies,\nis that what I'm understanding here?\n\n366\n00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.285\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, and, yes,\nyou do need to know about them.\n\n367\n00:20:51.285 --> 00:20:53.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So a good thing we're going over them,\n\n368\n00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.730\nso we'll go over them, okay?\n\n369\n00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.670\nNotice the second one over here on\nthe right-hand side, and I will again make\n\n370\n00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:05.970\nthe link for us and\nlet's see what we can do here, okay.\n\n371\n00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.270\nNow, Cherokee this one looks a little bit\nstrange because we're probably saying\n\n372\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.660\nwhat in the world is this one about, okay.\n\n373\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.580\nNow this one is a little bit strange in\nthe very fact that it says that before\n\n374\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:24.240\ntask b, the second task can begin,\ntask a has to begin, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.930\nSo in other words,\nthe way that I would normally say it is,\n\n376\n00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.250\ntask A and B can begin on or\nabout the same time.\n\n377\n00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:32.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,\n\n378\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.035\nsee to me, my language is much more clear.\n\n379\n00:21:35.035 --> 00:21:37.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Than the way that the predecessory-\n\n380\n00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:37.960\n&gt;&gt; Start to start.\n\n381\n00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, start to start, right?\n\n382\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.420\nTask a and b can start on or\nabout the same time.\n\n383\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.930\nIt doesn't mean that it has to, okay.\n\n384\n00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.150\nSo that's where it gets\na little bit tricky.\n\n385\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.590\nIt essentially says that as long as\ntask a has begun, then I can begin.\n\n386\n00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.550\n&gt;&gt; So really,\nif task a has been completed,\n\n387\n00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.460\nas long as task b starts afterwards,\nwe're still in the clear?\n\n388\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes as far as the start\nto start relationship.\n\n389\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:08.150\nNow if actually task a has to be\ncomplete before task b starts,\n\n390\n00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.810\nthen you're at a finish to start.\n\n391\n00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:10.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n392\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:15.270\n&gt;&gt; So in other words if task a has to be\ncomplete, totally done before task b can\n\n393\n00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.175\nstart you're at a finish-\n&gt;&gt; Different terms got it.\n\n394\n00:22:17.175 --> 00:22:17.909\n&gt;&gt; To start, yeah.\n\n395\n00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:18.420\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n396\n00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.820\n&gt;&gt; If task a begins then\nsometime in the next day,\n\n397\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.250\nsometime in the next few weeks,\nwhatever you might want to call it.\n\n398\n00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:32.190\nAs long as its actually started its\nprocess then you can start as well, okay.\n\n399\n00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.130\nSo, and you hate to say that.\n\n400\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.730\nThe relationship that I have here\nis I always thing about cooking.\n\n401\n00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.910\nCuz why?\nI love food, that's why, okay.\n\n402\n00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:44.200\nSo my daughter, she just told me that\nshe wants to go to culinary school,\n\n403\n00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.340\nwhich is great okay.\n\n404\n00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.880\nBut she can only make one thing at a time,\nokay.\n\n405\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.270\nSo if she makes something for\ndinner, she finishes this and\n\n406\n00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.570\nthen she makes that, okay.\n\n407\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.468\nSee for me, i will actually go ahead and\nstart making something and\n\n408\n00:22:56.468 --> 00:22:57.981\nthen put another thing on, okay.\n\n409\n00:22:57.981 --> 00:22:59.553\nSo, I go all right what takes the longest?\n\n410\n00:22:59.553 --> 00:23:02.590\nAnd so what I do, I start cooking\nwhatever takes the longest.\n\n411\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.312\nAnd as soon as that's started,\nwhat do I do?\n\n412\n00:23:04.312 --> 00:23:08.598\nI go and start my second item on the\nstove, much to the chagrin of my wife and\n\n413\n00:23:08.598 --> 00:23:10.155\nthe mess that I make.\n\n414\n00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.375\nBut overall though,\nthat's what I think about here.\n\n415\n00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:15.035\n&gt;&gt; I don't even really think about it,\nbut I do the same thing, Ronnie.\n\n416\n00:23:15.035 --> 00:23:17.285\nI guess I always thought it\nwas the little bit of OCD.\n\n417\n00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:19.845\nBut technically, it would be\na form of project management so\n\n418\n00:23:19.845 --> 00:23:21.805\nthat everything can\nfinish at the same time.\n\n419\n00:23:21.805 --> 00:23:23.825\nYour food is warm and ready to serve.\n\n420\n00:23:23.825 --> 00:23:24.505\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yeah.\n\n421\n00:23:24.505 --> 00:23:25.545\nSee, it's great, yeah.\n\n422\n00:23:25.545 --> 00:23:27.230\nThat's another way to think about it.\n\n423\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.380\nBut that's like I said,\n\n424\n00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.580\nthat's probably because I'm\nhungry more than anything else.\n\n425\n00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.900\nThat I always think about food in\nthat way, so, but that's the other.\n\n426\n00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.230\nAll right, let's take a look\nat our third one here, okay.\n\n427\n00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.260\nNow the third one is finish to finish.\n\n428\n00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.490\nNow Cherokee,\nyou've already gotten the head start,\n\n429\n00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.299\nI already told you what\nthese other two mean.\n\n430\n00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:49.212\nYou want to take a guess at what\nthis one would actually mean here?\n\n431\n00:23:49.212 --> 00:23:52.767\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to assume\nthat the Dependency,\n\n432\n00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:57.308\nthe second one there is not\ncompleted until at least A or\n\n433\n00:23:57.308 --> 00:24:00.891\nthe first one is successfully completed.\n\n434\n00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:03.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is absolutely right, yeah.\n\n435\n00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:10.580\nIt's kind of a weird one, but\neven if the second task were to finish.\n\n436\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.090\nEven if you go, I'm done with mine.\n\n437\n00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.570\nAccording to the way that project went,\nyou're not really done yet.\n\n438\n00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.180\nI know it's so strange right?\n\n439\n00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.380\nYou're not done until what?\n\n440\n00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.010\nUntil that other one is finished.\n\n441\n00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.060\nSo let's use our food analogy,\ncuz that'll actually work here, right.\n\n442\n00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.502\nSo I can say that dinner is ready to go,\nokay.\n\n443\n00:24:28.502 --> 00:24:32.362\nBut if I only have one of all\nthe plates that I wanna serve,\n\n444\n00:24:32.362 --> 00:24:35.950\nI really don't have dinner ready to go,\nokay?\n\n445\n00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.710\nI need all of them to be done\nbefore it's actually ready to go.\n\n446\n00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.127\nAnd so\nthe same thing with the finish to finish.\n\n447\n00:24:42.127 --> 00:24:43.660\nVery good, yeah, so here it is.\n\n448\n00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.920\nAll of them have to be finished.\n\n449\n00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.650\nSo in other words, task B is not\nfinished until task A is also finished.\n\n450\n00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:54.050\nThe way that I like to say it is the other\nway instead, which is task A and B,\n\n451\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.830\nthey need to be finished on or\nabout the same time instead.\n\n452\n00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.460\nAnd that's really the key here, okay?\n\n453\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.420\nBut really the true predecessor of your\nrelationship is the way that Cherokee\n\n454\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.350\ndescribed it.\n\n455\n00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:08.930\nIs that task B is not finished until\ntask A is also finished as well.\n\n456\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.860\nSo it just depends on that time element.\n\n457\n00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.380\nNow by far the hardest one to understand,\nand\n\n458\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.900\nthere's no really good\nexamples of this one.\n\n459\n00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.310\nCuz I have looked over the planet and\n\n460\n00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:25.690\nI can't even think of a time in\nwhich I can even use one here, okay.\n\n461\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.100\nNow in this one it sounds\nthe most logical, right?\n\n462\n00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.999\nStart to finish, okay.\n\n463\n00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.200\nThat to me is the most logical idea,\nright?\n\n464\n00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.760\nYou start something and\nyou finish it, okay.\n\n465\n00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.250\nBut, notice the way that this\nturns out here is that task A,\n\n466\n00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.616\nbecause it's pointing to\nthe start side of it, right?\n\n467\n00:25:43.616 --> 00:25:47.516\nTask A, here, okay, it really,\n\n468\n00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:52.098\nlet me make sure I say this right, okay.\n\n469\n00:25:52.098 --> 00:25:56.484\nSee, I can't even get it right here, okay.\n\n470\n00:25:56.484 --> 00:26:02.260\nSo task A has to go ahead and,\nno, see I did it backward.\n\n471\n00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.760\nThat's why my arrows are killing me, cuz\nthis is the exact same arrow that I drew.\n\n472\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.340\nSo it's backward, so let me redraw that.\n\n473\n00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.245\nThat is why I messed up.\n\n474\n00:26:09.245 --> 00:26:13.550\nI was like, why is that about to say\nthe same thing as finish to start.\n\n475\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.867\nSo, let me redraw that one,\ncuz I was about to make a big mistake.\n\n476\n00:26:15.867 --> 00:26:17.891\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI was just looking in the chat here.\n\n477\n00:26:17.891 --> 00:26:18.665\nWe have, Mr.\n\n478\n00:26:18.665 --> 00:26:23.515\nDavid said, he said, imagine having Gordon\nRamsey as the boss for project management.\n\n479\n00:26:23.515 --> 00:26:26.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He is a little tough, yeah,\n\n480\n00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:26.610\ndefinitely.\n\n481\n00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:30.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nnow let me kind of re-cue this one for\n\n482\n00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.360\nus here, cuz I really did mess up.\n\n483\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.440\nI was like, why does that look\nexactly like finish to start?\n\n484\n00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.660\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n485\n00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.590\nSo here is the difference, okay.\n\n486\n00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.070\nNotice this one though,\nthis one's a little bit strange, okay.\n\n487\n00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:46.242\nSo this one essentially says task B can\n\n488\n00:26:46.242 --> 00:26:51.230\nnot finish until task A starts, okay.\n\n489\n00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.740\nTask B cannot finish until task A starts.\n\n490\n00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.420\n&gt;&gt; It sounds pretty obvious there.\n\n491\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.110\n&gt;&gt; It does?\n\n492\n00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.980\nYeah, that sounds, I was gonna say,\nall right Cherokee,\n\n493\n00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.610\nI'm gonna put you on the spot then.\n\n494\n00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.430\nNo, yeah,\nthis one is a very difficult one, okay.\n\n495\n00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.710\nSo much so that most people\ndon't even really count this.\n\n496\n00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:12.290\nBut it is one of the ones that you\ncan actually end up seeing as well.\n\n497\n00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.740\nBut there's no real good\ndescription of this particular one.\n\n498\n00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.060\nAnd even examples of something\nlike this are very hard to find.\n\n499\n00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.480\nSo much so that all of the examples\nthat I found just were so\n\n500\n00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.060\ntechnically mentally\njumping through the hoops.\n\n501\n00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.060\nI couldn't even tell you how\nto explain it in that sense.\n\n502\n00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.320\nI can't even think about a time when that\nwould actually happen where I would say\n\n503\n00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.590\nall right,\nI can't really finish until you begin.\n\n504\n00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.610\nBut you can see it sometimes, right?\n\n505\n00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.190\nThe very fact is it might\nbe programming of some sort\n\n506\n00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.400\nthat you might follow logic like this.\n\n507\n00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.540\nNow look, my work can't begin,\nor can't really finish up.\n\n508\n00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.510\nI can't really finish my job\nuntil you begin to work on yours.\n\n509\n00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.620\nI don't see how that would affect me,\nbut that's usually the idea.\n\n510\n00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.146\nSome type of programming language\nthat goes on and looping and stuff.\n\n511\n00:28:00.146 --> 00:28:03.589\nAnd that's where you tend to have these\nloops that have to do all of the stuff\n\n512\n00:28:03.589 --> 00:28:04.430\nthat it has to do.\n\n513\n00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.890\nBut so it is very possible, but\n\n514\n00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.000\nit's not one of the very common\nones that you'll end up seeing.\n\n515\n00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000\nSo just realize that\nthat can be done there.\n\n516\n00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.970\nNow, when you start to take\na look at this, right?\n\n517\n00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:19.216\nSetting up dependencies are kind of neat.\n\n518\n00:28:19.216 --> 00:28:23.345\nBecause all I have to do inside of\nMicrosoft Project here is that I can\n\n519\n00:28:23.345 --> 00:28:28.110\nselect task number 4, and\nthen I go to the Predecessor tab here.\n\n520\n00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:32.660\nAnd when I do that,\nthis is where I can come in and\n\n521\n00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.630\nchoose, well, any of those\noptions that are available to me.\n\n522\n00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.460\nSay here's exactly how I want it to go.\n\n523\n00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.107\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Do I want it to be Finish-to-Start,\n\n524\n00:28:39.107 --> 00:28:41.376\nStart-to-Start, Finish-to-Finish,\nStart-to-Finish?\n\n525\n00:28:41.376 --> 00:28:41.980\n&gt;&gt; And now we know what they mean, yay!\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n526\n00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.510\nnow you know what they\nmean at the same time.\n\n527\n00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n528\n00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.110\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou can actually set those things up.\n\n529\n00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.330\nThe key for you is at least\nunderstanding the very basics.\n\n530\n00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:55.080\nBut if you do need to set them up and\nthat's the way that you have to.\n\n531\n00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.990\nSo you'll actually end up seeing that you\ncan change those relationships to help you\n\n532\n00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.270\nto manage your schedule\na little bit better.\n\n533\n00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.630\nSo setting up predecessors or\ndependencies, even though CompTIA kinda\n\n534\n00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.890\nseparates those out in what we\nactually end up calling them.\n\n535\n00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.499\nThere's plenty of different project\nsoftware that may do it a little bit\n\n536\n00:29:13.499 --> 00:29:14.264\ndifferently.\n\n537\n00:29:14.264 --> 00:29:18.155\nBut just understand that that's,\nprobably more than anything,\n\n538\n00:29:18.155 --> 00:29:22.947\nyou'll need to make a decision or a choice\nin which of those you would choose if they\n\n539\n00:29:22.947 --> 00:29:26.380\ntell you here's what the requirement is,\nright?\n\n540\n00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.822\nThat which one shows this,\nand you just gotta know.\n\n541\n00:29:29.822 --> 00:29:33.080\nSo just take what we've taught\nhere just a little bit.\n\n542\n00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.940\nAnd be able to try and\napply it into your realm of thinking and\n\n543\n00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.860\nsee if the analogy fits for\nyou, and that's the way to go.\n\n544\n00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, thank you for\nshowing us that software and\n\n545\n00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:46.480\nexplaining how we can actually integrate\nthose terms, our dependencies and\n\n546\n00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.400\nour predecessors into the actual\ntools that we have available for us.\n\n547\n00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.460\nThere's a lot that we've\ncovered in this episode, but\n\n548\n00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.090\nI still think there's more to come.\n\n549\n00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.670\nSo, for those of you at home, please\nstay tuned for an additional episode.\n\n550\n00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.860\nI think this will go ahead and\ncreate a part three for our execute and\n\n551\n00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.230\ndevelop our project schedules.\n\n552\n00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.630\nThank you for tuning in today,\nI'm Cherokee Bouse\n\n553\n00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.530\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n554\n00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.689\n&gt;&gt; Signing off, have a great one.\n\n555\n00:30:11.349 --> 00:30:17.260\n[MUSIC]\n\n556\n00:30:17.260 -->

00:00:12.286\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:14.991\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:17.115\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.834\nToday we're gonna be\ncontinuing our Project+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:24.800\nAnd our show here is going to specifically\nfocusing on how to execute and\n\n8\n00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.480\ndesign our project schedules.\n\n9\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.730\nIf you've been following along,\nyou know we've been looking at that for\n\n10\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.240\nthe past two episodes, but there are still\nsome details that we want to cover.\n\n11\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.350\nAnd with us today we have Mr. Ronnie Wong\nto go ahead and head up those details.\n\n12\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.190\nThank you.\n\n13\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you again for having me on\nthe Project+ Show as we continue on to\n\n14\n00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.800\ntake a look at some of these details\nin developing our project schedule.\n\n15\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.960\nNow, when we took a look before, we were\ntalking about the idea of predecessors and\n\n16\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.970\ndependencies.\n\n17\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.621\nWe showed you how you can use a tool like\nMicrosoft Project to really kind of rail\n\n18\n00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:59.923\nin, or fence in, all those details\nthat we need to as a project manager,\n\n19\n00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:01.921\nto have them all in one location.\n\n20\n00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:06.582\nEven though we talked about the idea\nof the predecessor relationship,\n\n21\n00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:11.087\nwe briefly mentioned the idea here,\nof course, dependencies, and\n\n22\n00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:13.430\nthat they really go hand in hand,.\n\n23\n00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.298\nAnd we need to cover a few more\ndetails on dependencies and\n\n24\n00:01:16.298 --> 00:01:20.120\nthen move on to other topics to help us\nto determine what we call, of course,\n\n25\n00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.469\nthe critical path, which is something that\nwe'll really kind of have to focus in on.\n\n26\n00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.490\nSo we actually have those\ndetails ahead of us, as well.\n\n27\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.690\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat what we're talking about, then.\n\n28\n00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.450\nAnd here we're just going to take a look\nat the idea here of some dependencies.\n\n29\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.490\nAnd then we'll talk about what's\nactually on our screen, as well.\n\n30\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.860\nSo whenever we have a task that's actually\nahead of us, what we're gonna end up\n\n31\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.020\nseeing here is we're gonna talk\nabout the idea of early starts and\n\n32\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.580\nearly finishes, and then late starts and\nlate finishes, as well.\n\n33\n00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.390\nAnd we'll move this into\nthat realm of the diagram.\n\n34\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.230\nNow, before we get here, we need to\njust take a little bit of time and\n\n35\n00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.820\nfocus in on dependencies\njust a little bit more.\n\n36\n00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.230\nSo let's go ahead and\ntalk about those as well, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.060\nNow, when it comes down to dependencies,\n\n38\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.820\nwe showed you how you can create those\ntypes of predecessor relationships.\n\n39\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.002\nBut the problem that you and\nI might have is how do we know what's\n\n40\n00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:18.377\nactually a dependent relationship,\nand what isn't one, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:22.011\nWell, there's actually multiple types of\ndependencies that you should be aware of.\n\n42\n00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:26.890\nAnd that will help to allow you,\nthen, so say, all right, here's how,\n\n43\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.718\nas I set up these predecessors,\nwhat is dependent upon that task doing?\n\n44\n00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:35.630\nAnd so we need to at least\nlogically talk about that.\n\n45\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.900\nSo in terms of dependencies,\n\n46\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.990\nthere's actually three different types\nthat we have to worry about, okay.\n\n47\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.300\nThe first one is what we\ncall a mandatory dependency.\n\n48\n00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.680\nAnd a mandatory type of dependency\nis really when it actually depends\n\n49\n00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.620\non the type of work that's\nactually being done, okay.\n\n50\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.330\nSo in this particular sense,\n\n51\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.800\nwork has to actually be completed\nbefore another one gets started.\n\n52\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.090\nWell, in that sense,\nthat means, hey, we really are.\n\n53\n00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.560\nIt's not an idea of I want\nit to actually be where this\n\n54\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.950\nfinishes before this, it really has to\nactually be done before I can continue on.\n\n55\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.720\nSo let's give an example in\nterms of construction, okay.\n\n56\n00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.570\nI wanna go ahead and\nframe up my house, okay,\n\n57\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.690\nbut I don't have a foundation poured\nthat a frame can be built on.\n\n58\n00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.640\nWell, in that sense,\nthat's a mandatory dependency.\n\n59\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.700\nThat means before I can proceed\nframing up the framework for\n\n60\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.000\na house that I might want to build,\nthe foundation must be finished, and must\n\n61\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.790\nbe poured and everything must actually be\ncompletely cured the way that it has to.\n\n62\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.250\nSo that's an example of\na mandatory type of dependency.\n\n63\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.570\nNow, there's also, of course,\n\n64\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.310\nwhat we call a discretionary\ntype of dependency, as well.\n\n65\n00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.945\nIn terms of discretionary dependency,\nthis is some type of procedure driven or\n\n66\n00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:53.200\nprocess driven dependencies.\n\n67\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.700\nNow, I mentioned this before\nin a previous episode, but\n\n68\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.070\nwe can go back to something like this\nwhere it might be regulatory, as well.\n\n69\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.920\nSo in this example, I've actually\nused a friend of mine that used to\n\n70\n00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.700\nbuild cabinets for private airplanes.\n\n71\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.620\nAnd even though he could actually\nbuild all of those cabinets, and\n\n72\n00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.420\nthen install them into 100 airplanes\nat a time, he always had to wait.\n\n73\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.670\nAfter he finished building\neither the cabinet or\n\n74\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.350\nthe top surface of that cabinet, he had\nto wait until the inspector came by and\n\n75\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.830\ninspected it, and\njust simply signed off on a sheet.\n\n76\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.900\nIf he didn't get that sign-off, he was\nnot able to move on to the next step.\n\n77\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.900\nWell, it's not that the signing\noff did anything, right.\n\n78\n00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.150\nIt was just signing a sheet of paper,\nit didn't actually do anything for\n\n79\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.100\nthe work being progressed along.\n\n80\n00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.680\nBut it was one of the discretionary\ndependencies that airplane manufacturers\n\n81\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.690\nsay, look, every single thing,\nright, cuz you're up in the air.\n\n82\n00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.510\nYou have to follow these procedures, and\nthey wanted to make sure that everything\n\n83\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.700\nwas inspected as it went\ntogether on that airplane.\n\n84\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.747\nSo that was a discretionary\ntype of dependency, okay.\n\n85\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.165\nWe also have, then, external dependencies\nthat we have to also begin to understand,\n\n86\n00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:08.230\nas well.\n\n87\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.838\nNow, external dependencies are things\nthat are beyond our control.\n\n88\n00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:16.890\nOkay, so when we start taking a look at\nthe idea of external dependencies that we\n\n89\n00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.990\nhave, well, let's go back to that\nexample of the construction, okay.\n\n90\n00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.270\nSo here it is, I bought my piece of land,\nand now I am ready to frame up my house.\n\n91\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.945\nThe problem that I have, I already told\nyou, is I don't have the foundation ready.\n\n92\n00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:36.788\nIt's actually not there, so I need to\nwait for the foundation to be poured.\n\n93\n00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:41.014\nSo I go and I call whoever actually\npours foundation and I say, all right,\n\n94\n00:05:41.014 --> 00:05:43.893\nI want a foundation to be\npoured right now, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:43.893 --> 00:05:48.388\nAnd they tell me, well, Ronnie,\nwe can pour a foundation,\n\n96\n00:05:48.388 --> 00:05:54.720\nwhatever size you need, but I need 24\nhours in advance before I can do that.\n\n97\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.690\nOr I might need 48 hours in advance,\nwhatever it might be,\n\n98\n00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.650\nbefore I can come out and\npour the foundation that you want.\n\n99\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.840\nWell, that's an external dependency.\n\n100\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.950\nIn other words, I can't do anything\nbecause I'm actually dependent upon what?\n\n101\n00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.120\nThat person saying I can deliver it either\nright now or I can deliver it in 24 hours.\n\n102\n00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.790\nSo in that sense, it's not anything you\ncan control, it's pretty much the way that\n\n103\n00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.570\nthey have it, and so\nyou might have to depend on those.\n\n104\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.150\nSo each one of those,\nknowing whether it's a discretionary,\n\n105\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.720\na mandatory or even the idea\nhere of an external dependency,\n\n106\n00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.180\nis what's gonna really help\nyou set those predecessors up.\n\n107\n00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and being able to identify\nthose dependencies ahead of time.\n\n108\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.210\nI mean,\nyou're aware of any potential obstacles,\n\n109\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.500\nyou're just getting a heads up so\nyou're not blindsided by any of these.\n\n110\n00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it really is,\nit's something that we definitely\n\n111\n00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.938\nneed to be aware of before we actually\nget into the execution stage of things.\n\n112\n00:06:43.938 --> 00:06:47.170\nBecause if it's at the execution stage and\nwe're now worrying about dependencies\n\n113\n00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.200\nthen, while not in the planning stage,\nwe're gonna find ourselves\n\n114\n00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.470\nreally behind the eight ball and\nwe're not gonna know what to expect.\n\n115\n00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.920\nNow, the other things, of course,\nare fairly business like\n\n116\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.370\ntypes of things that we have to worry\nabout in terms of scheduling, as well.\n\n117\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.290\nAnd then we'll get into\nthe critical path method.\n\n118\n00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.240\nOne, of course, is understanding what the\nsequence of tasks that have to be done.\n\n119\n00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.250\nAnd that's where understanding\nthe predecessor and\n\n120\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.690\nthe dependency relationships\nreally do help.\n\n121\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.870\nBut also understanding the time schedule.\n\n122\n00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.820\nIn other words, what is the overall\ntime schedule that you have?\n\n123\n00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.270\nYou might find out something\nthat your sequence is different,\n\n124\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.770\nif you actually are given a deadline and\nsay here's when it has to be completed by.\n\n125\n00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.314\nYou might actually sequence things a\nlittle bit differently to get you to that\n\n126\n00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:31.655\npoint where you know you can complete\neverything by that deadline date.\n\n127\n00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:35.579\nOr it could be that they say,\nlook, here it is.\n\n128\n00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.477\nWe want to make sure that\nyou begin by this date, so\n\n129\n00:07:38.477 --> 00:07:43.050\nthat we'll have it at some future date\nthat we believe is gonna happen, okay.\n\n130\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.773\nSo you might schedule things out a little\nbit differently if you start from a start\n\n131\n00:07:46.773 --> 00:07:47.605\ndate, instead.\n\n132\n00:07:47.605 --> 00:07:52.273\nAnd then say let me figure this out in the\nplanning stage of how long this is gonna\n\n133\n00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:54.558\ntake, and I can give you an estimate.\n\n134\n00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:57.506\nWell, that's a little bit\ndifferent in the way that\n\n135\n00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.592\nyou're gonna sequence your\ntasks to get things done.\n\n136\n00:08:00.592 --> 00:08:04.576\nSo when you use some type of project\nmanagement information system,\n\n137\n00:08:04.576 --> 00:08:08.930\nyou end up seeing where they\nallow you to schedule from both.\n\n138\n00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.140\nBut once you do that you're now setting\ninto your schedule what they call\n\n139\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.340\nof course a hard constraint, if you're\ndoing it from a project end date instead.\n\n140\n00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.320\nAnd that means everything has to actually\nhave a particular type of constraint\n\n141\n00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.460\ncalled a finish on date, in other words\nit has to actually be done this way for\n\n142\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.860\neverything to be completed by this date.\n\n143\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.700\nSo you'll see it's one of the hardest\nconstraints that you can work with\n\n144\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.430\nbecause it means everything else has to be\nset around that to make everything work.\n\n145\n00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.390\nSo there's a lot of things that go on when\nyou start taking a look at the idea of\n\n146\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.800\nsequencing of tasks as well,\nas well as the prioritizing of tasks too.\n\n147\n00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.910\nSo in terms of scheduling,\nthere's a lot of considerations because\n\n148\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.240\nyou are literally scheduling so\nmany moving parts, so\n\n149\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.260\nmany different pieces, so many elements\nyou have to consider in terms of time.\n\n150\n00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.380\nBefore everything does come together for\nthe work on your one project.\n\n151\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.210\nSo it's a lot, a lot, a lot of information\nthat has to actually be done here, okay?\n\n152\n00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.020\nAll right, so\n\n153\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.170\nin this sense then we do just have to\ntake a moment and start to go right.\n\n154\n00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.230\nNow that I understand all these elements,\nokay.\n\n155\n00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.860\nThat all this has to be in place and\n\n156\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.950\nthen I have some durations\nthat I can work off of, okay.\n\n157\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.040\nWhat do I do with those durations and\n\n158\n00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.590\nhow do I start calculating\nfinish dates with them, okay.\n\n159\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.970\nWell, the great things is, in today's\nworld, in the 21st century, heck,\n\n160\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.760\neven in the latter half\nof the 20th century,\n\n161\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.460\nyou started to have the beginnings of\nthose project information systems.\n\n162\n00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.020\nIn other words, you take those information\nin and you enter them into those project\n\n163\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.930\ninformation system and\nyou're off and you're ready to go.\n\n164\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.465\nBut what if you don't have them.\n\n165\n00:09:47.465 --> 00:09:50.490\nWhat if you're now facing a.\n\n166\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.660\nLet's say.\n\n167\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.720\nYou're sitting down for an examination,\nlike CompTIA Project+ exam.\n\n168\n00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.140\nAnd they show you this interesting looking\nchart here and say, hey, how do you\n\n169\n00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:06.250\nactually determine what is the possible\nearliest finish date for this one task?\n\n170\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.930\nOr the latest finish date for\nthis one task, okay?\n\n171\n00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.100\nWell, you have to be able to do\nsomething like that as well.\n\n172\n00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.760\nAnd when we start to talk about\nthat in project management terms,\n\n173\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.910\nwe're actually determining what we\ncall the critical path of a project.\n\n174\n00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.410\nAnd the critical path of the project\nis the longest uninterrupted run from\n\n175\n00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:31.290\nthe beginning to the end of that project,\nor that particular portion of the project.\n\n176\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:37.390\nWith no areas of float or the idea of\ndown time that we have in between.\n\n177\n00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.240\nSo that is what we're trying to determine.\n\n178\n00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.930\nSo that's where it brings us back to,\n\n179\n00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.470\nwhen we're taking a looking at our\ndiagram just a little bit before, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.330\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at my\nmachine and let's see where it begins.\n\n181\n00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.830\nOkay, now not everybody\ndoes this in the same way.\n\n182\n00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.250\nEvery once in a while you'll see\nthis where people make bubbles or\n\n183\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.800\ncircles out of them instead,\nand that's perfectly fine.\n\n184\n00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.460\nBut this is kind of the easiest way, and\n\n185\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.640\nthis is the way that I learned\nhow to do this method instead.\n\n186\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.960\nSo you normally just make a square,\n\n187\n00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.100\nand then in the upper left hand corner,\nyou have your earliest start.\n\n188\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.350\nNow we're actually talking\nin terms of duration, okay.\n\n189\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.240\nSo notice the D here is for duration, and\n\n190\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.770\nthen we have our earliest start date and\nthen we have our earliest finish date.\n\n191\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.490\nNow we're gonna just use simple numbers\ninstead of real dates at this point cause\n\n192\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.230\nit can get confusing but\nwe'll show you how this is done.\n\n193\n00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.540\nAnd then we're also gonna\ndetermine the latest start and\n\n194\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.790\nthe latest finish that this particular\ntask can take and help us out, all right.\n\n195\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.350\nSo that is what we actually\nneed to determine.\n\n196\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.110\nNow any time that we actually get finished\ngoing through and determining the earliest\n\n197\n00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.590\nstart and the earliest finish, the latest\nstart and the latest finish here,\n\n198\n00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.270\nwhen we start to do that, our goal is to\ndetermine this idea that we call float.\n\n199\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.550\nOkay, or if you actually come\nfrom the Microsoft Project world,\n\n200\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.710\nthey call it slack, is what they call it.\n\n201\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.460\nThere's that time that it actually is\na gap in between that we don't really know\n\n202\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.070\nwhy everything's not actually lining\nup to finish one thing after another.\n\n203\n00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.600\nBut it actually ends up happening\nin our project schedule.\n\n204\n00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.770\nAnd we're gonna take a look at this.\n\n205\n00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.440\nThe reason why we have to know this idea\n\n206\n00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.320\nis because what you're\ngonna end up finding out\n\n207\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.130\nis that not everything in a project\nwill progress in a linear format, okay.\n\n208\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.210\nAnd that means that what you might find\nout is that two tasks that actually\n\n209\n00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.860\nbegun as a single work package might\nactually end up splitting into two tasks.\n\n210\n00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.540\nAnd then end up coming back together for\nthe next task to go on.\n\n211\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.150\nAnd they're going to end up being\ndependent on one another, so they're going\n\n212\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.010\naffect each other's end dates,\nis what's going to end up happening.\n\n213\n00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.360\nSo let me show you an example of\nhow we begin to calculate something\n\n214\n00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.010\nlike this out.\n\n215\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.970\nSo the way that we do this.\n\n216\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.700\nLet me make the screen a little bit\neasier to see, at least I hope we can.\n\n217\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWhat's going on here?\n\n218\n00:12:54.455 --> 00:12:55.150\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n219\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.580\nSo what is going on right here, okay.\n\n220\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.365\nIs that we're gonna start off with task A,\nand\n\n221\n00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:08.896\nthose there's a B, C, D,\nE, F, G, H and I, okay.\n\n222\n00:13:08.896 --> 00:13:12.804\nWhat you're seeing at this point\nis that it began with task A but\n\n223\n00:13:12.804 --> 00:13:17.020\nnow it's gonna end up splitting\nof into two possible directions.\n\n224\n00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.404\nIn other words both of these have\nto be done before the entire,\n\n225\n00:13:21.404 --> 00:13:24.925\nthat particular work package or\nbranch can be finished.\n\n226\n00:13:24.925 --> 00:13:29.865\nOkay, so we need to actually determine\nhow long each one of these packages\n\n227\n00:13:29.865 --> 00:13:35.395\nwill take place so we can begin to\nschedule them if we're going to do this.\n\n228\n00:13:35.395 --> 00:13:39.275\nNow, the way that we begin is that\nnotice that underneath task A,\n\n229\n00:13:39.275 --> 00:13:42.630\nas well as all the other letter tasks\nthat we have, we have a number.\n\n230\n00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.230\nAnd that one right there in\nthe center is gonna be what we called\n\n231\n00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.130\nthe duration of our task, okay.\n\n232\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.270\nSo when we start to figure this out\nwe're gonna make two passes, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:59.311\nOne is what is called a forward pass and\nthat is when we\n\n234\n00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:05.168\nactually run through the calculation\nfrom this way, okay.\n\n235\n00:14:05.168 --> 00:14:08.040\nIn other words, we're gonna actually\nrun through it from left to right.\n\n236\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.240\nAnd then the other one is\nwhat we call a backward pass.\n\n237\n00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.923\nAnd that will actually help us,\nwhen we actually run through it.\n\n238\n00:14:18.306 --> 00:14:21.290\nIn this particular direction instead.\n\n239\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.540\nSo we're gonna actually see\nboth of them in action and\n\n240\n00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:29.160\nthen we can determine float from\nactually using this insert.\n\n241\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.650\nSo let's see how this\nactually done to help us out.\n\n242\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.310\nNow the map is gonna seem a little bit\ndifferent than the way that you and\n\n243\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.050\nI normally do map,\nit's not because the arithmetic,\n\n244\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.120\nit's the way you that we have\nto count duration, okay.\n\n245\n00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.970\nSo let's take for an example task A here.\n\n246\n00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.220\nIt's suppose to actually be a task\nat let's say last one deck, okay.\n\n247\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.750\nSo if we we're to talk about\nthat one day task here.\n\n248\n00:14:53.790 --> 00:15:01.220\nWell the earliest day that I can start on\nthis task is gonna be what, one day, okay.\n\n249\n00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.360\nSo in that sense,\nif I take that one day, and\n\n250\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:10.610\nI'm saying that particular task last\none day, is gonna finish well on,\n\n251\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.520\nat the end, excuse me, of day one, okay?\n\n252\n00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.670\nSo if a one day task\ntakes a whole one day,\n\n253\n00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.730\nthat means it actually finishes\non that same day, okay.\n\n254\n00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.110\nSo just bear with me on this if\nyou're going, okay, that hopefully so\n\n255\n00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.630\nfar makes sense.\n\n256\n00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:34.176\nSo that means that the earliest\npossibility that task B can actually begin\n\n257\n00:15:34.176 --> 00:15:40.268\non the dependency here, which for us is\ngonna be a finished to start dependency.\n\n258\n00:15:40.268 --> 00:15:45.153\nTask A finishes and\nnotice the arrow on the finish side right\n\n259\n00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:50.528\nthe right hand side here of this\ntask going to what the beginning or\n\n260\n00:15:50.528 --> 00:15:56.409\nthe start side of this task, so\nthis is a finish to start relationship.\n\n261\n00:15:56.409 --> 00:16:04.980\nThat means that the earliest that task B\ncan begin is going to be on day two, okay?\n\n262\n00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.770\nSo if the earliest that task B can begin,\nand that task's duration is supposed to\n\n263\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:15.450\ntake two days, what that means is\nactually, if we use days, right.\n\n264\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.310\nSo if this began on January 1st,\na one-day task should also end on, what?\n\n265\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.695\nJanuary 1st, make sense?\n\n266\n00:16:21.695 --> 00:16:22.482\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n267\n00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:26.644\nthen the earliest that task B\ncan begin should be January 2nd.\n\n268\n00:16:26.644 --> 00:16:27.560\n&gt;&gt; Ending on January 4th.\n\n269\n00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.576\n&gt;&gt; You would think that, that's exactly.\n\n270\n00:16:30.576 --> 00:16:31.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n271\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.420\nthat's what I was hoping would happen,\nI was hoping to trick Cherokee here.\n\n272\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.250\nAnd yeah, because how,\nyou and I count what?\n\n273\n00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.500\nThat means that if we start on the 2nd,\nthat means two days later is what?\n\n274\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.270\n3rd and 4th.\n\n275\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n276\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.348\nyou're forgetting that if we begin\nat the beginning of what, day two,\n\n277\n00:16:46.348 --> 00:16:49.400\nthere's an eight-hour workday there,\nthat's day two.\n\n278\n00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.360\nThere's one day.\n\n279\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n280\n00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.470\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen day three is actually our second day.\n\n281\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.600\nOkay, because yes,\nyou have another eight-hour day.\n\n282\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.851\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So the earliest finish here is day\n\n283\n00:16:59.851 --> 00:17:00.811\nthree, okay?\n\n284\n00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:01.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n285\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.888\n&gt;&gt; Because we're actually doing work\non what, the second and the third.\n\n286\n00:17:04.888 --> 00:17:05.495\nMake sense?\n\n287\n00:17:05.495 --> 00:17:06.031\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n288\n00:17:06.031 --> 00:17:07.410\n&gt;&gt; So two days, all right.\n\n289\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.900\nSo notice that we're\nfollowing this pattern then.\n\n290\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.710\nSo the earliest that task C can begin\n\n291\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.810\nis the day after because I'm\nat the end of here, right.\n\n292\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.520\nI'm at the end of the finish of\nthe business day of day three, so then.\n\n293\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.470\nThe earliest finish date\nright here is day four.\n\n294\n00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.280\nStart date, excuse me, okay.\n\n295\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.017\nStart date, my fault.\n\n296\n00:17:29.017 --> 00:17:30.023\n&gt;&gt; You already have me confused,\n\n297\n00:17:30.023 --> 00:17:32.276\nyou're telling me that two plus two\ndoesn't equal four any more so.\n\n298\n00:17:32.276 --> 00:17:33.158\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n299\n00:17:33.158 --> 00:17:35.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is where durations matter.\n\n300\n00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.460\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Because the way that we're calculating,\n\n301\n00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.990\nright, is not at the end of the business\nday but it's at the beginning.\n\n302\n00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.710\nSee when we count, right, we always count\nfrom the end of that number and go up.\n\n303\n00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.970\n&gt;&gt; You would think, yeah, but no.\n\n304\n00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:46.749\n&gt;&gt; That's what you would think, okay.\n\n305\n00:17:46.749 --> 00:17:47.612\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n306\n00:17:47.612 --> 00:17:50.172\nnotice that that's not the way\nthat this one works here.\n\n307\n00:17:50.172 --> 00:17:50.770\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n\n308\n00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.494\n&gt;&gt; So now if we actually start on the 4th,\nwe count what,\n\n309\n00:17:55.494 --> 00:17:59.660\nthe 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th, right?\n\n310\n00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.295\nThat's four days.\n\n311\n00:18:00.295 --> 00:18:01.180\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n312\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthis would actually end on the 7th.\n\n313\n00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:05.967\nSo far, so good?\n\n314\n00:18:05.967 --> 00:18:07.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n315\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee, here it is.\n\n316\n00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.392\nI'm gonna throw you under the bus, okay.\n\n317\n00:18:10.392 --> 00:18:12.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if this actually finishes,\n\n318\n00:18:12.915 --> 00:18:17.324\ntask C ends up at the end of day seven,\nso we're done with all of day seven,\n\n319\n00:18:17.324 --> 00:18:19.974\nwhat's the earliest that task D can begin?\n\n320\n00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:23.471\n&gt;&gt; This one is going to be day eight?\n\n321\n00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:24.087\n&gt;&gt; Eight!\n\n322\n00:18:24.087 --> 00:18:26.821\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's so weird,\n\n323\n00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:28.060\nI just wanna make sure.\n\n324\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.990\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm with you, I'm with you,\nso we begin on the day of day eight.\n\n325\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.930\nNow if we begin day of day eight,\nright, Cherokee?\n\n326\n00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.500\nHave I done any work so far?\n\n327\n00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.065\n&gt;&gt; Not yet.\n\n328\n00:18:36.065 --> 00:18:36.591\n&gt;&gt; Not yet.\n\n329\n00:18:36.591 --> 00:18:40.560\n&gt;&gt; So that means that if it's a three-day\ntask I have all of day eight.\n\n330\n00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.531\nSo January 8th.\n\n331\n00:18:41.531 --> 00:18:48.707\n&gt;&gt; The 9th, and 10th,\nthat should be my EF, Finish.\n\n332\n00:18:48.707 --> 00:18:50.435\n&gt;&gt; So on the 10th here, okay, so\n\n333\n00:18:50.435 --> 00:18:55.020\nthat's what we should end up seeing\nat least I think that's right, okay?\n\n334\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.770\nSo there is that idea where we\nactually do finish that way.\n\n335\n00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.503\nWell, that means that\nthe final task over here.\n\n336\n00:19:01.503 --> 00:19:03.800\nWhat do you think on task I?\n\n337\n00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.530\n&gt;&gt; Task I?\n\n338\n00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.810\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say 11?\n\n339\n00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.342\n&gt;&gt; You'd be wrong.\n\n340\n00:19:07.342 --> 00:19:10.102\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What's going on here?\n\n341\n00:19:10.102 --> 00:19:13.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, see notice that we\ndidn't hit the bottom half, right?\n\n342\n00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.565\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering about that.\n\n343\n00:19:14.565 --> 00:19:16.248\n&gt;&gt; See?\n&gt;&gt; Is it happening in tandem or\n\n344\n00:19:16.248 --> 00:19:17.830\nis there something else going on?\n\n345\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nat this point the way that it's showing,\n\n346\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.430\nit is happening in tandem, okay.\n\n347\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.904\nSo in other words,\nwe are actually seeing this, and so\n\n348\n00:19:26.904 --> 00:19:29.833\nthis particular task on I, right?\n\n349\n00:19:29.833 --> 00:19:34.068\nWe don't know which of these two arrows\nhere is actually going to affect, what,\n\n350\n00:19:34.068 --> 00:19:36.090\nthe beginning date of I.\n\n351\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.420\nWe don't know yet, why?\n\n352\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.870\nBecause I haven't determined what?\n\n353\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.910\nThe bottom path, okay, make sense?\n\n354\n00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but are you saying also that\none of those paths may have a higher\n\n355\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.320\nprecedence than the other,\nlike your prioritization?\n\n356\n00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.685\n&gt;&gt; Not precedence, but\nlet's see how this works out,\n\n357\n00:19:50.685 --> 00:19:52.960\nat least I hope this is gonna work out,\nall right.\n\n358\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.217\nSo now let's start with E here, okay, so\n\n359\n00:19:56.217 --> 00:20:02.190\nif we actually now go through 1,1,\nthat means on task E, day two, okay.\n\n360\n00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.167\nSo day two, a single day task,\nso that would be January 2nd,\n\n361\n00:20:06.167 --> 00:20:07.784\nthat should also end on.\n\n362\n00:20:07.784 --> 00:20:08.851\n&gt;&gt; The 3rd.\n\n363\n00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:11.283\n&gt;&gt; The 2nd, yeah,\nremember that we start at the beginning.\n\n364\n00:20:11.283 --> 00:20:13.401\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n365\n00:20:13.401 --> 00:20:17.756\n&gt;&gt; Just trying to make sure cuz I can\ndo math wrong just as easily, okay.\n\n366\n00:20:17.756 --> 00:20:18.345\n&gt;&gt; No, you're right.\n\n367\n00:20:18.345 --> 00:20:22.351\n&gt;&gt; So then task F, the earliest day that\nit can begin is at the end of day two,\n\n368\n00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:24.810\nwhich is actually what, day three, okay.\n\n369\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.900\n&gt;&gt; The 3rd.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n370\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.480\nthe 3rd, and this one has five days, okay.\n\n371\n00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.180\nSo we count the 3rd.\n\n372\n00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.600\n&gt;&gt; May 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n373\n00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.004\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 6th and 7th, yeah.\n\n374\n00:20:34.004 --> 00:20:35.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I had to count slower.\n\n375\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.020\nSee, Cherokee's so\nmuch faster in her mind than I am.\n\n376\n00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.025\nSo it is at day seven here, okay.\n\n377\n00:20:42.025 --> 00:20:45.679\nSo now that means task G,\nthe earliest that that one can begin.\n\n378\n00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:46.816\n&gt;&gt; I can't even see that number.\n\n379\n00:20:46.816 --> 00:20:47.460\n&gt;&gt; It's eight.\n\n380\n00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.981\n&gt;&gt; It's here, it's eight.\n\n381\n00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:50.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's an eight.\n\n382\n00:20:50.645 --> 00:20:53.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here, let me zoom in, there we go.\n\n383\n00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.682\nCan you see that one now?\n\n384\n00:20:53.682 --> 00:20:54.202\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's better.\n\n385\n00:20:54.202 --> 00:20:58.694\n&gt;&gt; All right, so task eight,\nokay, or task day eight.\n\n386\n00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:01.898\nSo January 8th, it's a four-day duration.\n\n387\n00:21:01.898 --> 00:21:04.187\nAll right, Cherokee,\nhelp me out here, eight?\n\n388\n00:21:04.187 --> 00:21:05.972\n&gt;&gt; Eight, nine, ten, eleven.\n\n389\n00:21:05.972 --> 00:21:10.530\n&gt;&gt; Eleven, so here's eleven.\n\n390\n00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.390\nI'll see if I can scoot on over here,\nokay.\n\n391\n00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.840\nSo that means that at\nthe end of day eleven-\n\n392\n00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.540\n&gt;&gt; Which we've already surpassed\n\n393\n00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.742\nthe previous track.\n\n394\n00:21:18.742 --> 00:21:23.657\nWe've already surpassed our previous\ntrack here, so this means that this can\n\n395\n00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:27.689\nactually, H here has to begin on\nday 12 and it can finish when?\n\n396\n00:21:27.689 --> 00:21:30.569\n&gt;&gt; And this is a one day, so\nit can also finish on the 12th.\n\n397\n00:21:30.569 --> 00:21:36.639\n&gt;&gt; On the 12th here, okay, so now this\nis where we have what, information.\n\n398\n00:21:36.639 --> 00:21:41.260\nI have day 10 and I have day 12, okay?\n\n399\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.350\nTask I is dependent upon both, right,\n\n400\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.790\nremember the start to finish\nrelationship says what?\n\n401\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.196\nThat task I can what?\n\n402\n00:21:53.196 --> 00:21:56.860\n&gt;&gt; Begin once my other tasks are complete.\n\n403\n00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes, once the other task,\nthe preceding task is complete.\n\n404\n00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.864\nNow that means that if I start\nthis on the 11th, right,\n\n405\n00:22:04.864 --> 00:22:07.953\nif I start I on the 11th,\nwhat happens to H?\n\n406\n00:22:07.953 --> 00:22:10.853\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be behind the ball,\nyou're not gonna be ready for\n\n407\n00:22:10.853 --> 00:22:12.520\nwhatever you need for that task I.\n\n408\n00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.737\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is where now we\nstart seeing where both paths have\n\n409\n00:22:16.737 --> 00:22:18.738\nan influence on one, right.\n\n410\n00:22:18.738 --> 00:22:19.990\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n411\n00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.275\n&gt;&gt; So that means I have to come back now\nand say that the earliest then that task I\n\n412\n00:22:24.275 --> 00:22:28.105\ncan begin, because I've finished now what,\nthe end of day 12.\n\n413\n00:22:28.105 --> 00:22:29.144\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n414\n00:22:29.144 --> 00:22:29.726\n&gt;&gt; Is what?\n\n415\n00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:30.789\n&gt;&gt; The 13th.\n\n416\n00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:36.252\n&gt;&gt; 13th, okay, so\nnow that we have the 13th which means,\n\n417\n00:22:36.252 --> 00:22:40.970\none-day task,\ncan also end on the 13th as well.\n\n418\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:41.488\nMake sense?\n\n419\n00:22:41.488 --> 00:22:42.590\n&gt;&gt; That does.\n\n420\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now we've actually\nmade the forward pass here and\n\n421\n00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.470\nwe're starting to see some\ninformation pop in, okay.\n\n422\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.990\nNow we have to do the other one\nto determine which one has float,\n\n423\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:57.110\nbecause that's the area that we can\nactually adjust the schedule and\n\n424\n00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.280\nnot really actually influence\nthe overall schedule as well, okay.\n\n425\n00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.823\nSo we make any adjustments we need to,\nwe try and\n\n426\n00:23:02.823 --> 00:23:07.480\nput it in that area which we'll find gaps\nin, okay, so that's what's gonna happen.\n\n427\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.201\nRonnie, should I be prepared to see\nthese types of questions on the exam or\n\n428\n00:23:12.201 --> 00:23:17.243\nbe able to identify when these tool kits\nor these tasks should be completed by?\n\n429\n00:23:17.243 --> 00:23:18.945\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n430\n00:23:18.945 --> 00:23:19.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just so I know.\n\n431\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now don't get me wrong.\n\n432\n00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.780\nAre they gonna actually make\nyou do the whole thing?\n\n433\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.092\nI can't tell you that, okay,\n\n434\n00:23:26.092 --> 00:23:29.410\nthere's a reason why I can't tell\nyou that, but I can't tell you.\n\n435\n00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.790\nBut what I can tell you is,\n\n436\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.470\nat least, I would be prepared to\nunderstand how this works, okay.\n\n437\n00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Both the forward and\n\n438\n00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:36.970\nthe actual backward path and\n\n439\n00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.100\nthen something else we're\ngonna show you here, right?\n\n440\n00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.090\nSo let's work on the other end,\nokay, going through here, okay.\n\n441\n00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:46.150\nSo now we're gonna start with task I here.\n\n442\n00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.246\nAnd so that means that on the bottom half,\nright?\n\n443\n00:23:48.246 --> 00:23:51.875\nWe're talking about late start,\nlate finishes here,\n\n444\n00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:56.826\nthe latest that this task can actually\nfinish is gonna be the 13th, okay?\n\n445\n00:23:56.826 --> 00:23:59.882\nThat's because we already seen that,\nhey, that's the final date.\n\n446\n00:23:59.882 --> 00:24:04.628\nAnd that means that for this one,\nit can actually begin on what day?\n\n447\n00:24:04.628 --> 00:24:08.273\nThe 13th, oops, all right.\n\n448\n00:24:11.735 --> 00:24:13.391\nLet me see if I can zoom back out here.\n\n449\n00:24:13.391 --> 00:24:16.598\nAll right, so we'll take the top half\nagain and we'll go on through, okay?\n\n450\n00:24:16.598 --> 00:24:21.316\nSo now, if we go to D that means\nthat the latest that this particular\n\n451\n00:24:21.316 --> 00:24:23.185\ntask can finish, right?\n\n452\n00:24:23.185 --> 00:24:27.348\nIf I know that the latest that\nit can start is the 13th here.\n\n453\n00:24:27.348 --> 00:24:29.130\nThis would be 12, day 12 and\n\n454\n00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.930\nthen we actually do the same\nthing going backward, right?\n\n455\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.649\nSo for me to determine the early finish,\nright?\n\n456\n00:24:35.649 --> 00:24:38.866\nDay 12, 11, 10,\n\n457\n00:24:38.866 --> 00:24:44.150\nso that should be day 10, okay?\n\n458\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.625\nThen that means the earliest\nthat this one can\n\n459\n00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:52.991\nfinish should be 9, if I'm right, okay?\n\n460\n00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:57.798\nIf I'm right here, so nine, eight,\n\n461\n00:24:57.798 --> 00:25:03.080\nseven, six, I think [LAUGH] if my, here.\n\n462\n00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.001\nAnd then day six, the earliest\nthis one will finish is gonna be,\n\n463\n00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:10.569\noop wait, make sure I said that.\n\n464\n00:25:10.569 --> 00:25:14.532\nNine, eight, seven, six,\nyeah that's four, right.\n\n465\n00:25:14.532 --> 00:25:17.529\nSo this should be five here, and\n\n466\n00:25:17.529 --> 00:25:22.635\nthen this one here is gonna be five and\nfour right here,\n\n467\n00:25:22.635 --> 00:25:27.310\nunless I did some math wrong,\nwhich I could have.\n\n468\n00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.959\nLet me verify that I actually\ndid that right, okay?\n\n469\n00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:36.376\nSo here, day 13, we subtract 1 day and\nthen we take 10 here,\n\n470\n00:25:36.376 --> 00:25:40.474\nthe day before, 6, 5, 4, 2, yep.\n\n471\n00:25:40.474 --> 00:25:44.670\nThere we go, and now I have to\nactually wait on this one too, right?\n\n472\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.625\nBecause I don't have what?\n\n473\n00:25:46.625 --> 00:25:47.615\nThe other one down here.\n\n474\n00:25:47.615 --> 00:25:49.876\nSo even though these\nnumbers may be different,\n\n475\n00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:53.162\nI may find out something is not gonna\nactually work out that I want to.\n\n476\n00:25:53.162 --> 00:25:58.679\nAll right, so now we actually start\ndown here at the same thing with H,\n\n477\n00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:02.057\nand then we'll finish this up right here.\n\n478\n00:26:02.057 --> 00:26:04.920\nThis will be 12 and 12,\n\n479\n00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:11.028\nwhich means that this 1 will\nactually have 11, right?\n\n480\n00:26:11.028 --> 00:26:14.560\nAnd then we take away 4, so 11,10, 9, 8.\n\n481\n00:26:18.378 --> 00:26:21.903\nAnd then the earliest that this\n1 can finish is gonna be, or\n\n482\n00:26:21.903 --> 00:26:26.857\nyeah, latest that can finish is gonna be\nday 7, so that day 8 can actually begin.\n\n483\n00:26:26.857 --> 00:26:31.377\nSo we subtract 5 from that, so 7,\n\n484\n00:26:31.377 --> 00:26:34.859\n6, 5, 4, 3, right?\n\n485\n00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:35.742\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, okay.\n\n486\n00:26:35.742 --> 00:26:40.347\nJust again, I'm not as fast as Cherokee,\nI'm kinda slow here.\n\n487\n00:26:40.347 --> 00:26:46.474\nThat means that this one is gonna be 2,\nand then that same day too here.\n\n488\n00:26:46.474 --> 00:26:52.880\nOops, let me scroll back, and\nnow between the both of these, okay?\n\n489\n00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.390\nWhat is the latest finish that\nI can have for these two?\n\n490\n00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.523\nWell the latest one that I can\nhave is actually 2 here, okay?\n\n491\n00:27:01.523 --> 00:27:06.492\nBecause I can't do this backward where I\nsay, that this starts off on day 4 when\n\n492\n00:27:06.492 --> 00:27:11.403\nthis 1 is supposed to start on what date,\nor the latest start is on day 2 here.\n\n493\n00:27:11.403 --> 00:27:17.367\nSo it's here that this takes\npresent where this becomes a 1 and\n\n494\n00:27:17.367 --> 00:27:21.650\nthen day 1 oops, it's right here, right?\n\n495\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.778\nNow, what you might see, right?\n\n496\n00:27:23.778 --> 00:27:25.502\nIs not the whole thing, in other words,\n\n497\n00:27:25.502 --> 00:27:27.947\non the exam you might not have\nto fill out the whole thing.\n\n498\n00:27:27.947 --> 00:27:31.111\nBut what if they were to\nleave two of these blank?\n\n499\n00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:35.290\nThey were to say, oops, [LAUGH] you\nneed to erase they whole thing.\n\n500\n00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:42.671\nLet's say that they actually said this and\nthey said, determine this, okay?\n\n501\n00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.210\nYes, they do expect that you can do that,\nokay.\n\n502\n00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.480\nIt's very possible, okay?\n\n503\n00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.180\nOr they may ask you to determine\nwhich of these have flowed in them.\n\n504\n00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.859\nNow, that's were it's\nactually a little bit easier,\n\n505\n00:27:57.859 --> 00:28:00.428\nI say a little bit easier here,\nlittle bit more here.\n\n506\n00:28:00.428 --> 00:28:02.200\nAnd the way that we\ndetermine float is here.\n\n507\n00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.829\nWe take the late start and\nwe subtract the early finish.\n\n508\n00:28:05.829 --> 00:28:08.420\nAnd wherever we get\na difference there's float.\n\n509\n00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.271\nSo let's just do a couple of them in\nthe time that we have remaining here.\n\n510\n00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:15.573\nWell, notice here at the very end,\nI went ahead and determined this one.\n\n511\n00:28:15.573 --> 00:28:19.466\nBecause the late start and or excuse me,\n\n512\n00:28:19.466 --> 00:28:26.464\nlate finish subtracted from the late\nstart, I'm gonna get that right.\n\n513\n00:28:26.464 --> 00:28:27.613\nThat's 0, okay?\n\n514\n00:28:27.613 --> 00:28:28.250\nSame thing.\n\n515\n00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.190\nEarly start or early finish and\nearly start, 0.\n\n516\n00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.521\nThere's no float.\n\n517\n00:28:33.521 --> 00:28:39.439\nSame thing here for task H, as I try and\nthere we go, for task H that becomes 0,\n\n518\n00:28:39.439 --> 00:28:44.600\nand notice this whole bottom here,\nhas no float in it, okay?\n\n519\n00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.866\nSo if you actually do this, where you\ntake a look at all these numbers and\n\n520\n00:28:47.866 --> 00:28:51.308\nthey're essentially identical,\nyou won't have any float time, okay?\n\n521\n00:28:51.308 --> 00:28:58.764\nIt's just not gonna happen, but notice\nhere though you do have float here, okay?\n\n522\n00:28:58.764 --> 00:29:02.441\nBecause I can see 8 and 10,\nthere's a difference here and then 10 and\n\n523\n00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.173\n12 there's a difference here.\n\n524\n00:29:04.173 --> 00:29:07.729\nThere's could be a float there, and\nthat's could be like 2 to 3 days.\n\n525\n00:29:07.729 --> 00:29:12.584\nSame thing here,\nthere's could be a float along here,\n\n526\n00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:16.004\nand then there's a float here, okay?\n\n527\n00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:18.771\nOn this one, but\nwe're not actually determine that,\n\n528\n00:29:18.771 --> 00:29:20.466\ncuz theres no float on that okay?\n\n529\n00:29:20.466 --> 00:29:22.992\nBut this one actually gonna be 0.\n\n530\n00:29:22.992 --> 00:29:27.490\nSo all of those other numbers,\nthey actually will determine days afloat.\n\n531\n00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:33.254\nSo there's 2, let's that there's 4.\n\n532\n00:29:33.254 --> 00:29:35.344\nActually, we've subtract\nthem out to do that.\n\n533\n00:29:35.344 --> 00:29:38.750\nSo here it would be,\nlet me make sure I'm telling you right.\n\n534\n00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.465\nSo late start minus early start, okay?\n\n535\n00:29:42.465 --> 00:29:48.060\nSo late start, early start,\nthis is 2 days, okay?\n\n536\n00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:52.248\nSo this 1 right here,\nlate start minus early start, 2 days.\n\n537\n00:29:52.248 --> 00:29:54.259\nThis one's same thing so 2 days.\n\n538\n00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:56.208\nNow what does that help you determine?\n\n539\n00:29:56.208 --> 00:29:59.269\nWell it'll let you know that\nif you affect anything up here\n\n540\n00:29:59.269 --> 00:30:01.776\nin terms of extension to\nthe project duration.\n\n541\n00:30:01.776 --> 00:30:07.320\nBy a day, or a day here, or a day here\nis not gonna effect the overall project.\n\n542\n00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.430\nIf you need to affect the project it's\ndown here where there's no room for\n\n543\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.142\nanything to adjust before you affect\nthe end date of that project or\n\n544\n00:30:15.142 --> 00:30:16.616\nthe end result over here.\n\n545\n00:30:16.616 --> 00:30:20.505\nSo you're actually determining that,\nthis path down here at\n\n546\n00:30:20.505 --> 00:30:24.830\nthe bottom Is my critical path\nbecause all of my float is gone.\n\n547\n00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:25.925\nThere's no wiggle room.\n&gt;&gt; Less wiggle room.\n\n548\n00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:27.886\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly that's what I was thinking.\n\n549\n00:30:27.886 --> 00:30:32.044\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so that is actually what you're\nactually starting to see right there when\n\n550\n00:30:32.044 --> 00:30:33.171\nyou start to do that.\n\n551\n00:30:33.171 --> 00:30:38.099\nSo this is a skill that most of us\nare probably never gonna have to do in\n\n552\n00:30:38.099 --> 00:30:38.885\nreality.\n\n553\n00:30:38.885 --> 00:30:43.613\nBut on the exam, you gotta at least know\nhow to determine something like I just\n\n554\n00:30:43.613 --> 00:30:47.415\nshowed you, and the idea of\nfloat here to understand, okay?\n\n555\n00:30:47.415 --> 00:30:49.870\nSo there's a lot of\ninformation right there.\n\n556\n00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.251\nIt's probably a great place for\nus to at least kinda take a breather, and\n\n557\n00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:54.591\njust try and to soak that in.\n\n558\n00:30:54.591 --> 00:30:57.402\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of those things,\nkind of like subnetting, right Ronnie?\n\n559\n00:30:57.402 --> 00:30:59.609\nYou just gotta practice it\nin order to become fast.\n\n560\n00:30:59.609 --> 00:31:02.970\nSo that you're not stressing\nout during the exam.\n\n561\n00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:03.989\n&gt;&gt; No, you're right.\n\n562\n00:31:03.989 --> 00:31:05.314\nThe very fact is like I said,\n\n563\n00:31:05.314 --> 00:31:08.085\nthey're not gonna give you\na whole thing like this, okay?\n\n564\n00:31:08.085 --> 00:31:11.536\nIt's probably going to be elements from\na single one the majority of the time.\n\n565\n00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:14.106\nAgain, I can't exactly tell you.\n\n566\n00:31:14.106 --> 00:31:17.216\nOne I'm not allowed to, but\ntwo, I really don't know.\n\n567\n00:31:17.216 --> 00:31:20.416\nBut overall though, just kinda\nrealize if you can determine float.\n\n568\n00:31:20.416 --> 00:31:23.657\nIf you know how to actually determine\nwhere you can actually find that,\n\n569\n00:31:23.657 --> 00:31:25.380\nthat's gonna be great.\n\n570\n00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.951\nDetermine an early start date or\na late start date, or a early finish,\n\n571\n00:31:28.951 --> 00:31:29.685\nearly start.\n\n572\n00:31:29.685 --> 00:31:32.602\nAll that stuff,\nmake sure you can do all that.\n\n573\n00:31:32.602 --> 00:31:35.964\nAnd you might find yourself right there,\nand they're gonna say yeah,\n\n574\n00:31:35.964 --> 00:31:37.025\nthat's what he can do.\n\n575\n00:31:37.025 --> 00:31:38.901\nAnd that's actually a good thing for us.\n\n576\n00:31:38.901 --> 00:31:41.851\nSo it's a good skill for\nus to have, just in case we don't\n\n577\n00:31:41.851 --> 00:31:46.101\nhave that project management information\nsystem, where we can get access to it.\n\n578\n00:31:46.101 --> 00:31:49.218\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, this has been a lot of\ninformation we've looked at so far, but\n\n579\n00:31:49.218 --> 00:31:50.239\nwe're not quite done.\n\n580\n00:31:50.239 --> 00:31:52.489\nWe have a couple more topics\nthat we need to address.\n\n581\n00:31:52.489 --> 00:31:55.315\nWe need to look at our quality dates and\nour governance dates.\n\n582\n00:31:55.315 --> 00:31:56.698\nDo you think you can\nhelp us out with that?\n\n583\n00:31:56.698 --> 00:31:58.588\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I can, so let's go ahead and\n\n584\n00:31:58.588 --> 00:32:01.298\ntake a look at a couple of\nlast topics here on project\n\n585\n00:32:01.298 --> 00:32:05.602\nschedules that will really, I'll round\nout what we need to understand as well.\n\n586\n00:32:05.602 --> 00:32:09.355\nNow, Cherokee mentioned those two specific\nideas of what we called gates and\n\n587\n00:32:09.355 --> 00:32:13.690\nthere's some specific types of gates that\nwe need to make sure that we understand.\n\n588\n00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:16.590\nWhich are called quality gates and\ngovernance gates as well.\n\n589\n00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.810\nBut let's take a look\nat my machine here and\n\n590\n00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.520\nthat will help us out just a little bit.\n\n591\n00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.420\nWell, either one,\n\n592\n00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.330\nwhether we're talking about quality gates\nor the idea of governance gates here,\n\n593\n00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.910\nwell they're specific types of\ngo no go types of decisions.\n\n594\n00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.270\nYou might hear the term project gate,\nmilestone,\n\n595\n00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.900\nwhatever it might be that's\npretty much the idea here.\n\n596\n00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.190\nNow, in your project there\ncould be many of them or\n\n597\n00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.970\nthere might just be a few of them.\n\n598\n00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:46.207\nWith quality types of gates what we're\nactually saying is that we establish\n\n599\n00:32:46.207 --> 00:32:50.509\ncertain times within our project where\nwhat we say is that we check the quality\n\n600\n00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:51.648\nof what the work is.\n\n601\n00:32:51.648 --> 00:32:56.221\nAnd if the work continues to meet\nthat bench mark that is when\n\n602\n00:32:56.221 --> 00:33:01.250\na decision is made by someone\nwhether it's the project manager,\n\n603\n00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.634\nproject team, project sponsor that says,\n\n604\n00:33:04.634 --> 00:33:10.900\nwe're gonna continue on with this\nbecause this is what I'm looking for.\n\n605\n00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.630\nBut this allows us to put in those\nearly warning systems that says,\n\n606\n00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:18.290\nyes, we still find value in this work.\n\n607\n00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.470\nProjects can be very easily lost at the\nvery end once you spent all the money for\n\n608\n00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:26.150\nyour project and now you're company is\ndown, well, it could be hundreds of\n\n609\n00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.840\nthousands of dollars as well for a small\ncompany, I'd say $50,000 to $60,000 and\n\n610\n00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.730\nyou worked on the whole project and now\nsomebody says, this is not up to snuff.\n\n611\n00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.360\nWell, what happens to all the money?\n\n612\n00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.530\nYou can't recoup that very easily.\n\n613\n00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:39.770\nSo setting up what we call,\n\n614\n00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:43.450\nof course, quality gates says, here's what\nwe're going to do, a quality inspection.\n\n615\n00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:45.070\nAnd then, we'll decide whether or\n\n616\n00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.590\nnot we're actually proceeding\non with what we need to.\n\n617\n00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.580\nIt's very important.\n\n618\n00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.640\nBecause if we don't have\nthese quality checks,\n\n619\n00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.690\nwe could produce a dud at the end and\nsay, well, I did all the work for it.\n\n620\n00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.930\nYou still owe me to finish that.\n\n621\n00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.820\nSomebody I know says, you did all\nthe work but I'm not paying you for\n\n622\n00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.670\nthat because I don't like it at all.\n\n623\n00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:04.890\nThat would be terrible.\n\n624\n00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.100\nSo setting up quality gates\nis actually a very good thing\n\n625\n00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.240\nthat can be put in place\nthat checks on the quality.\n\n626\n00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:17.660\nThe same idea is pretty much identical in\nterms of governance gates but this time\n\n627\n00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:22.600\nIt is how we've actually chosen for\nthat procedure to go on.\n\n628\n00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.020\nSo this is more procedural and this sense.\n\n629\n00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.680\nSo what we want to do is we want\nto actually know whether or\n\n630\n00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:33.570\nnot the management is still actually\ninvolved in what we do here.\n\n631\n00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:38.339\nSo this actually gives us certain times\nwithin our particular project instead,\n\n632\n00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:42.910\nthat says, look, somebody can say I\ndon't really agree with this anymore.\n\n633\n00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:46.233\nWhether it's legislative\nat this particular point,\n\n634\n00:34:46.233 --> 00:34:49.530\nwhether it's management,\nclient's signing off.\n\n635\n00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:50.920\nWhatever it might be.\n\n636\n00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:55.650\nThat we just don't have everything that\nwe need, and in the project, as well.\n\n637\n00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:00.050\nSo both of these types of gates\nhere are really just saying\n\n638\n00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.900\nthere's different types of markers\nthat we need to make sure of, and\n\n639\n00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.790\nwhat we don't want again is that the very\nend of the project for somebody to find\n\n640\n00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:11.550\nand say, we should have scrapped that\ntwo weeks ago and we just chose not to.\n\n641\n00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.960\nSo it allows us to stop it at any\npoint without expending anymore money,\n\n642\n00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.860\nand these are really good ideas.\n\n643\n00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.010\nSo setting those gates up during planning,\nI'm saying here's where I want to check,\n\n644\n00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.860\nis actually a manager's best friend,\nbecause it allows him,\n\n645\n00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.760\nif everything's not working, the way that\nit needs to, that he can now go ahead and\n\n646\n00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.130\ncut off that particular point and move\non to a different project that he needs.\n\n647\n00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:36.470\nSo setting these gates up are great\nways to actually provide very good,\n\n648\n00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.640\nsolid metrics and a point that says\nI'm accountable up to this point and\n\n649\n00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.290\nthen after that we're done\nif we actually need to be or\n\n650\n00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.335\nI'm continuing on with the management\nof this project as well.\n\n651\n00:35:46.335 --> 00:35:49.025\nSo that's what we talked about when we\ntake a look at governance gates as well as\n\n652\n00:35:49.025 --> 00:35:49.955\nquality gates.\n\n653\n00:35:49.955 --> 00:35:50.765\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Ronnie,\n\n654\n00:35:50.765 --> 00:35:54.055\nfor explaining that to us and everything\nelse you've covered in this episode.\n\n655\n00:35:54.055 --> 00:35:59.222\nWe've taken a look at our dependencies,\nour mandatory, our discretion, external.\n\n656\n00:35:59.222 --> 00:36:03.617\nWe also looked at how to prioritize in\nsequence tasks in addition to determining\n\n657\n00:36:03.617 --> 00:36:04.739\nour critical path.\n\n658\n00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:06.887\nSo I think we're good to go for\nthis episode.\n\n659\n00:36:06.887 --> 00:36:09.095\nThanks so much for tuning in today.\n\n660\n00:36:09.095 --> 00:36:10.943\nI'm Cherokee Boose\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n661\n00:36:10.943 --> 00:36:11.487\n&gt;&gt; Signing off.\n\n662\n00:36:11.487 --> 00:36:14.144\nHave a great one.\n\n663\n00:36:14.144 --> 00:36:19.718\n[MUSIC]\n\n664\n00:36:19.718 --> 00:36:23.366\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.302 --> 00:00:15.292\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITPPRO.TV,\n\n4\n00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.050\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.590\nToday we're gonna be looking\nat CompTIA's Project+.\n\n6\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.330\nSpecifically we'll be identifying our\nagile basics for our methodology.\n\n7\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.310\nSo we have with us today Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.570\nRonnie, thank you for being with us today.\n\n9\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.360\nWhere do we start?\n\n10\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.430\nHow do we learn these methods?\n\n11\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Well when we start to take a look\nat the idea of using agile methodology,\n\n12\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.970\none of the things that we wanted to begin\nwith is you might be wondering why?\n\n13\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.460\nIf you've come from\nthe world of programming and\n\n14\n00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.400\nthat you've understand kind of\nthe benefits of the agile method.\n\n15\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.650\nBut if you come from the world\nof project management outside\n\n16\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.540\nof the IT world a lot of times, you'd\nprobably go, wait a minute, that's so\n\n17\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.110\ndifferent than anything that we've talked\nabout in terms of project management.\n\n18\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.900\nSo, when you start talking about\nthe idea of just project management, so\n\n19\n00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.330\nwe'll do a basic comparison here and\nthen we'll show you a diagram that I\n\n20\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.190\nhope will help to explain it\na little bit better as well.\n\n21\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.730\nSo, when you start talking\nabout project management,\n\n22\n00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.746\nremember the phases that we\ntend to go through, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:14.400\nThe initiation,\nthe planning, the execution,\n\n24\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.390\nas well as the controlling\nkind of going hand in hand.\n\n25\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.540\nAnd then we have the closing and\nin CompTIA land, we also have, of course,\n\n26\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.400\nthe training which ends everything, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.080\nBut in all of those stages,\n\n28\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.380\nthe way that it's designed is that\none stage builds upon the next.\n\n29\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460\nSo the closing actually builds upon what\nwe've actually done in the execution and\n\n30\n00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.910\nthe controlling stage.\n\n31\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.000\nExecution and controlling builds upon what\nwe actually did in the planning stage.\n\n32\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.850\nPlanning, of course, builds upon and\nexpands on the initiation stage as well.\n\n33\n00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.750\nSo that at the very end,\nyou get this big gigantic product, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.150\nWhich is really what we hope is that\nour project really does deliver through\n\n35\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.300\non that unique result, product or\neven a service that we have.\n\n36\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.030\nAnd that everything's\ngonna be satisfactory.\n\n37\n00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.590\nWell, the problem that we have in terms of\njust regular project management is that as\n\n38\n00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.920\neffective as it is,\nit doesn't really lend itself to\n\n39\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.390\nchanges that may happen over time during\nthe project at any particular point.\n\n40\n00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.730\nIf you want to make changes in project\nmanagement in the way that we've talked\n\n41\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.130\nabout so far, it's easier to make\nchanges in the initiation phase,\n\n42\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.130\nit's easier to make changes\nduring the planning phase.\n\n43\n00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.780\nOnce you get into\nthe execution phase though,\n\n44\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.910\nthat's when changes now become burdensome.\n\n45\n00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.195\nThey become complex,\n\n46\n00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:34.045\nthey become things in which you\nwould rather not have to deal with.\n\n47\n00:02:34.045 --> 00:02:36.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we even saw where we\nmight have to go ahead and\n\n48\n00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:38.663\nsubmit those changes to\na change advisory board.\n\n49\n00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:41.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometime a change advisory\nboard that is usually what ends up\n\n50\n00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:43.135\nhappening there.\n\n51\n00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:46.845\nAnd so what starts to happen is that you\nstart to realize something that a lot of\n\n52\n00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:51.530\nsmall projects,\nchanges like that might be incredibly\n\n53\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.520\na hassle to you, but you might still be\ntold, you're still gonna have to do it.\n\n54\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.760\nI still want that in there.\n\n55\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.750\nI don't care what it takes,\nyou still need to do it.\n\n56\n00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.120\nAdd then you find out that you really do\nhave to kind of go, all right, well, for\n\n57\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.030\nus to do that we have to re-tool something\nelse or we actually have to reshape\n\n58\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.820\nsomething that we did six weeks ago to\nmake sure that element gets included in.\n\n59\n00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.320\nSo instead, what has started to happen in\nthe realm of project management is simple,\n\n60\n00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.780\nis that they started looking at other\nareas that were highly technical in terms\n\n61\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.740\nof their processes that they did, and\n\n62\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.930\nthey chose the idea of\nagile types of management.\n\n63\n00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.110\nAnd this is normally done in the software\nrealm, in the developer realm,\n\n64\n00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.970\nbecause of how easily they're able\nto take on changes and they don't\n\n65\n00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.290\ntake on long term planning in the way that\nregular project management talks about it.\n\n66\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.410\nSo, let's take a look at a diagram that\nwill help us to figure this out so\n\n67\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.250\nthat we can see a little\nbit more graphically and\n\n68\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.320\nhopefully it will stick into your mind and\ndo this, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.210\nSo, the way that agile works is that\nthey compare everything to the way\n\n70\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.070\nthat we used to do things, right?\n\n71\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.620\nSo if you're developing\nsome type of software,\n\n72\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.500\nthe traditional approach is simple,\nyou do analysis, and\n\n73\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.430\nthen you design the software, then you\nstart actually coding the software,\n\n74\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.330\nin other words doing the work, ultimately\ntesting it at the very end here,\n\n75\n00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.396\nyou end up with the software\nthat somebody requested, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.850\nNow notice how everything actually\ndepends on the other thing before.\n\n77\n00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.150\nI can't test anything unless I've already\ngone through analysis, design and coding.\n\n78\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.620\nI can't code anything if I haven't\ndesigned anything and I haven't done\n\n79\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.340\nanalysis that helps me to figure out\nwhat it is I'm actually coding for.\n\n80\n00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.900\nSo, when you start doing that, the real\ntest is that deliverable at the end.\n\n81\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.072\nWhether or not that product,\nthat software,\n\n82\n00:04:38.072 --> 00:04:40.031\nactually works the way that we want it to.\n\n83\n00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:42.706\nSo, in that same way,\nit's like project management, right?\n\n84\n00:04:42.706 --> 00:04:46.407\nThe initiation, the planning,\nthe execution, the controlling, and\n\n85\n00:04:46.407 --> 00:04:47.560\nthen the closing, and\n\n86\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.240\nthen of course, the testing there when\nyou add in the CompTIA language, right?\n\n87\n00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.770\nThen at the end you have that product,\nyou have everything that you want.\n\n88\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.740\nBut this is where it becomes\ndifficult when changes happen, right?\n\n89\n00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.010\nIf you're in the middle of coding and\nnow the sponsor of your project says,\n\n90\n00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.790\nhey, here is an extra\nelement I want you to add in.\n\n91\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.100\nWell, remember, you've already designed\nwhat it's supposed to look like.\n\n92\n00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.680\nYou've already designed what\nyou think is the end and\n\n93\n00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.780\nwhat you agreed upon with that\nsponsor that's the end, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.190\nAnd so, all of this designing\nmay have actually taken,\n\n95\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.090\nlet's say, four to six weeks to design.\n\n96\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.780\nAnd now you're three\nweeks in the coding and\n\n97\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.940\nnow somebody says,\nI need you to add this in there.\n\n98\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.310\nWell, now, you can't just go, well,\nI'm just gonna add that in later on and\n\n99\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.900\nwe'll just continue testing.\n\n100\n00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.570\nYou might actually find yourself\nhaving to start all over\n\n101\n00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.170\nbefore you can get to that point again.\n\n102\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.120\nThe way that agile actually does this\nis a little bit different in this way.\n\n103\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.710\nAgile says, look,\nhere's what we want to do instead, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.720\nThere is no long-term\nplanning as a requirement.\n\n105\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.850\nNow what does that mean?\n\n106\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.130\nDoes that mean they don't wanna\nsee the software that they wanna\n\n107\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.270\ndevelop at the very end?\n\n108\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.290\nNo, that's not what they mean.\n\n109\n00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.190\nWhat they mean, instead, is that they work\nin smaller workable units in this way.\n\n110\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.410\nThat they plan a little bit, and they say,\n\n111\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.750\nwhat's actually gonna help us to have our\nfirst step to give us the overall product?\n\n112\n00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.407\nAnd then they work on that as hard as they\ncan and then they work on the next step.\n\n113\n00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:20.307\nAnd what they really end up accomplishing\nat the very end is they have the product,\n\n114\n00:06:20.307 --> 00:06:24.567\nthe software that they want,\nnot because they were all working towards\n\n115\n00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:28.614\nthe end result in that way, but\nthat everybody along the project was\n\n116\n00:06:28.614 --> 00:06:32.306\nworking on smaller projects that\nended up as a result of that,\n\n117\n00:06:32.306 --> 00:06:36.520\nthe result of those ended up adding\nup into the entire project itself.\n\n118\n00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.600\nSo in everything that they do, you take a\nlook at it in a vertical manner this way.\n\n119\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.970\nLet me see if I can emphasize that a\nlittle bit more for the first step there.\n\n120\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:53.220\nThe bolder green line indicates that when\nwe begin to start working at this point,\n\n121\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.050\nwe just go, all right, how do we subdivide\nup what this big gigantic project is\n\n122\n00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.430\ngonna be into smaller,\nworkable chunks here and smaller goals?\n\n123\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.600\nAnd then we do an analysis for each one\nof those particular workable units.\n\n124\n00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.330\nAnd then we design, and we code, and\nwe test right there before we move on.\n\n125\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.660\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, if we look at our\nsmaller workable chunks here,\n\n126\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.740\nis there any kind of set duration, or\nany kind of recommendations that you have?\n\n127\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.640\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes and no, right?\n\n128\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.600\nLike anything else, it depends on\nthe world that you're working.\n\n129\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.330\nIn the software development world, usually\nthese particular smaller chunks are done\n\n130\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.520\nin particular time units that are set,\nright?\n\n131\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.680\nSo normally one to four weeks,\ndepending on how large the project is.\n\n132\n00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.380\nBy default, I wanna say de facto instead,\nnot by default.\n\n133\n00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.259\nDe facto, most software development teams\nthat tend to work in this manner of agile,\n\n134\n00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:47.833\nat least from what I\ncould actually find out,\n\n135\n00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:51.526\nit's about a two-week split is\nwhat they end up working out as.\n\n136\n00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:56.676\nSo what can we accomplish in ten days of\nworkable time that will give us at the end\n\n137\n00:07:56.676 --> 00:08:01.687\nresult here, we take a look at my screen\nagain That unit that we really want.\n\n138\n00:08:01.687 --> 00:08:05.510\nWe want some type of deliverable\nat the end of each one of these.\n\n139\n00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.236\nNow, the thing that makes this different,\nbecause we don't plan for the entirety\n\n140\n00:08:10.236 --> 00:08:14.304\nof the whole project, is at the end\nof this we might find out something.\n\n141\n00:08:14.304 --> 00:08:17.544\nWe now go back and\nafter testing we might find out,\n\n142\n00:08:17.544 --> 00:08:21.340\nRonnie you got software that's a dud,\nit doesn't work.\n\n143\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.214\nWell, it didn't mean that I\nworked the whole time, and\n\n144\n00:08:24.214 --> 00:08:25.689\nnow I have to start all over.\n\n145\n00:08:25.689 --> 00:08:28.438\nIt means on that particular\nunit I worked and\n\n146\n00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:32.688\nnow I might need to actually go back\nin and start all over if I need to.\n\n147\n00:08:32.688 --> 00:08:35.619\nOr I might find out through testing that\nI've got a portion of code that's bad.\n\n148\n00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:38.419\nWell then I just jump\nback in the coding and\n\n149\n00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.670\nI re-run that process in that\nloop again until we get it right.\n\n150\n00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:47.380\nNow, once it's actually done,\nwe can then move on to that second unit.\n\n151\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.767\nAnd it's there that you start\nthe same process again.\n\n152\n00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:51.945\nAnd this is why it's\nactually called agile,\n\n153\n00:08:51.945 --> 00:08:53.900\nbecause it willingly accepts changes.\n\n154\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.783\nSomebody adds something in during\nthe design stage, during the coding stage.\n\n155\n00:08:57.783 --> 00:09:02.030\nWell, you just simply start that process\nover again, and then you still end up with\n\n156\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.106\nthat smaller unit that you're really\nheading a goal towards, to help you out.\n\n157\n00:09:06.106 --> 00:09:08.307\nAnd so each process is really that loop,\n\n158\n00:09:08.307 --> 00:09:12.581\nor it actually leads onto the second stage\nwhich gives us a smaller unit again,\n\n159\n00:09:12.581 --> 00:09:16.030\nthird, fourth, fifth,\nhowever many that there are.\n\n160\n00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.207\nAnd at the end, the result of all\nthose small projects is what gives us\n\n161\n00:09:20.207 --> 00:09:23.533\nthe overall project itself and\nis what we really want.\n\n162\n00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:28.730\nSo, the nature of agile is what is\nconsidered the iterative approach.\n\n163\n00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.940\nNow, Cherokee, have you heard of this\nidea of an iterative approach before?\n\n164\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.188\n&gt;&gt; I have not.\n\n165\n00:09:33.188 --> 00:09:34.797\n&gt;&gt; You have not!\n\n166\n00:09:34.797 --> 00:09:37.857\nWell, this is what we mean here when\nwe talk about an iterative approach.\n\n167\n00:09:37.857 --> 00:09:41.899\nInstead of saying, the way that\nwe talk about a project, right?\n\n168\n00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:43.319\nWe had said that a project has what?\n\n169\n00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:46.349\nA definite beginning and\na definite end, but\n\n170\n00:09:46.349 --> 00:09:49.470\nit doesn't specify a duration in-between.\n\n171\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.464\nNow you may be wondering,\nwhy in the world is that important?\n\n172\n00:09:53.464 --> 00:09:58.313\nWell remember that in project management\nhere we have those three constraints,\n\n173\n00:09:58.313 --> 00:09:58.820\nright?\n\n174\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:05.822\nTime, scope, and cost, if you kind\nof remember that in your mind, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:10.392\nUsually there's one of those\nelements that is considered kind\n\n176\n00:10:10.392 --> 00:10:14.971\nof the absolute there,\nthe unchanging constant that we have.\n\n177\n00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:19.400\nAnd in a project management,\nthat's gonna be the idea of scope or\n\n178\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.580\nrequirements, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.987\nThe project sponsor really\nwants to see that product.\n\n180\n00:10:24.987 --> 00:10:28.776\nSo that means for you and\nI to affect the project any,\n\n181\n00:10:28.776 --> 00:10:33.515\nthe two variables that we really\nhave to keep in balance are time as\n\n182\n00:10:33.515 --> 00:10:37.590\nwell as the cost,\nis what we have to keep in mind, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.581\nNow, in in the way that\nAgile works instead,\n\n184\n00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:43.820\nit kind of inverts that idea instead.\n\n185\n00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.509\nIt says this, it says look, time and\n\n186\n00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:54.193\ncost are essentially the two that\nare really not movable, right?\n\n187\n00:10:54.193 --> 00:10:55.930\nThey are the constants.\n\n188\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.366\nAnd so, that's what allowed you\nto take that requirement, and\n\n189\n00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:02.368\nsay here's the overall thing\nthat Ronnie wants to see.\n\n190\n00:11:02.368 --> 00:11:06.134\nHow do I break that up into smaller units,\nor smaller projects,\n\n191\n00:11:06.134 --> 00:11:09.850\nthat will give Ronnie ultimately\nwhat he wants to see instead?\n\n192\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.555\nSo, it doesn't matter if Ronnie says,\nhere's what I wanna see at the end.\n\n193\n00:11:14.555 --> 00:11:18.161\nIt now matters what the team says,\nthis is what will give\n\n194\n00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:21.937\nRonnie what he wants to see at\nthe very end result instead.\n\n195\n00:11:21.937 --> 00:11:24.900\nSo now,\nthey can switch the requirements up and\n\n196\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.021\nthen they have the constant\nof what they realize.\n\n197\n00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:31.666\nThere's a particular time element\nthat they wanna do everything in and\n\n198\n00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:34.656\nit's gonna have a particular\ncost associated with that.\n\n199\n00:11:34.656 --> 00:11:38.848\nAnd so normally this, that iterative\napproach where we have between one\n\n200\n00:11:38.848 --> 00:11:42.418\nto four weeks, usually by the fact,\nor de facto, excuse me,\n\n201\n00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:46.699\nit's a two week what they call a sprint\nidea is what you tend to get, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:50.013\nSo that idea of a sprint is\nreally that iterative approach,\n\n203\n00:11:50.013 --> 00:11:53.524\nwhere they really work as hard as\nthey can for that span of time,\n\n204\n00:11:53.524 --> 00:11:57.403\nwhere they begin the analysis,\ndesigning, coding, and testing.\n\n205\n00:11:57.403 --> 00:12:01.737\nAnd at the end of that, that's what they\nwanna is some type of deliverable as well.\n\n206\n00:12:01.737 --> 00:12:06.878\nNow along with this type of approach\ncomes the idea of teams that\n\n207\n00:12:06.878 --> 00:12:11.930\nhave to be willing to work\ntogether very efficiently as well.\n\n208\n00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.771\nAnd the unusual thing about these teams\nin the iterative approach is that you as\n\n209\n00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:16.422\na project manager, you don't assign them.\n\n210\n00:12:16.422 --> 00:12:20.513\nYou as a project manager\nessentially just says,\n\n211\n00:12:20.513 --> 00:12:24.901\nhere is what Ronnie wants to see,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n212\n00:12:24.901 --> 00:12:29.312\nbreak this down in our analysis\nto see what we can do.\n\n213\n00:12:29.312 --> 00:12:32.730\nThen it's the team that's\nactually going to work on this.\n\n214\n00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.720\nThat's going to organize themselves,\nright?\n\n215\n00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.295\nSo we're talking about the idea of\nwhat we call self-organized and\n\n216\n00:12:40.295 --> 00:12:45.109\nself-directed types of teams that\nwill actually kind of do the work and\n\n217\n00:12:45.109 --> 00:12:48.817\ndecide how those requirements\nwill break down for us.\n\n218\n00:12:48.817 --> 00:12:52.778\nSo it's very important that we have this,\nbecause it's not me as the project manager\n\n219\n00:12:52.778 --> 00:12:56.150\nthat knows all of the details and\ntechnical details that need to be done.\n\n220\n00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:02.102\nIt's the team that does, and they know how\nto actually work best effectively as well.\n\n221\n00:13:02.102 --> 00:13:07.027\nSo, when we start to take a look at them\nthat means that these teams are not people\n\n222\n00:13:07.027 --> 00:13:11.732\nthat we just go, it's okay we'll just\ngrab Cherokee, we'll grab Peter,\n\n223\n00:13:11.732 --> 00:13:13.660\nwe'll grab Megan out of this.\n\n224\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it seems like these members have\nto be really coherent and responsible.\n\n225\n00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:21.331\nSo what are some characteristics\nthat you might look for Ronnie?\n\n226\n00:13:21.331 --> 00:13:25.163\nBecause like you're saying, you can't\njust pick some random individuals?\n\n227\n00:13:25.163 --> 00:13:27.219\n&gt;&gt; Well you could if you\nwere just doing stuff.\n\n228\n00:13:27.219 --> 00:13:30.997\nIf you just said you wanted to play say\na pick up game of basketball, definitely,\n\n229\n00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:32.620\nyou could do something like that.\n\n230\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.258\nBut because we have where we\nhave two of our requirements and\n\n231\n00:13:36.258 --> 00:13:39.024\nprojects that are constrained\nat all times,\n\n232\n00:13:39.024 --> 00:13:42.540\nthey are constantly constrained,\ncost as well as time.\n\n233\n00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.384\nIt means that for you to get those\nrequirements done, the other variables\n\n234\n00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:50.352\nthat you have to be able to change are\nthen going to be things like resources,\n\n235\n00:13:50.352 --> 00:13:54.640\nand that means that your team has to have\ncertain characteristics or properties.\n\n236\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.367\nOne of those of course is just plain\ncompetency in what you're doing.\n\n237\n00:13:58.367 --> 00:14:01.726\nThat means they have the actual\nskills that they need for\n\n238\n00:14:01.726 --> 00:14:04.230\nthe job that they're about to see ahead.\n\n239\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.974\nSo competency makes a big difference here,\n\n240\n00:14:06.974 --> 00:14:11.941\nyou can not take the time during these\nsprints to say, Ronnie you don't know how\n\n241\n00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:15.670\nto do this let me train you as we\ncontinue to go on and do this.\n\n242\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.931\nAt this point,\nif they're in part of a sprint,\n\n243\n00:14:17.931 --> 00:14:21.160\nthey're expected already to\nbe competent in the skills.\n\n244\n00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.343\nNow you might go, well,\nthat's kind of harsh and unfair.\n\n245\n00:14:23.343 --> 00:14:25.383\nBut remember that we're\nconstrained by what?\n\n246\n00:14:25.383 --> 00:14:27.242\nTime and money.\n\n247\n00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.246\nIt's different if we're not\nconstrained by those two.\n\n248\n00:14:29.246 --> 00:14:33.030\nThat those two are gonna be fairly\nvariable here, but they're not.\n\n249\n00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.372\nSo that's why we have to expect and\n\n250\n00:14:34.372 --> 00:14:36.280\nwe have to make sure that\nwe have competency too.\n\n251\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.575\nThe other thing of course is\ngood collaboration between those\n\n252\n00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:42.710\nself-organizing teams.\n\n253\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.135\nThe great thing is you\ndon't have to assign them.\n\n254\n00:14:44.135 --> 00:14:47.335\nThose teams, if they were together for\na while and so one of the other\n\n255\n00:14:47.335 --> 00:14:50.874\ncharacteristics that you tend to see\nis that these people have actually had\n\n256\n00:14:50.874 --> 00:14:54.950\ncontinuity, they've worked together for\na bit of time to really help it out.\n\n257\n00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.900\nBut they also have collaboration,\nin other words,\n\n258\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.331\nthey encourage the idea of teamwork.\n\n259\n00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:03.772\nIt's not about Cherokee making sure\nthat Cherokee gets top billing.\n\n260\n00:15:03.772 --> 00:15:06.821\n&gt;&gt; Right, if I'm able to go ahead and\nidentify some strengths and\n\n261\n00:15:06.821 --> 00:15:08.664\nweaknesses of certain individuals,\n\n262\n00:15:08.664 --> 00:15:12.534\nI'm gonna put people where I can get the\nbest out of every potential role there.\n\n263\n00:15:12.534 --> 00:15:14.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really gonna be\na key element in helping out.\n\n264\n00:15:14.904 --> 00:15:17.119\nSo collaboration, the idea of competency,\n\n265\n00:15:17.119 --> 00:15:20.340\nthe idea of some continuity because\nthese people work together.\n\n266\n00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.622\nIt really does help out,\nas well as, motivation.\n\n267\n00:15:24.622 --> 00:15:29.215\nAnd so these sprints are actually designed\nto be motivating to people that work\n\n268\n00:15:29.215 --> 00:15:32.566\ntogether that,\nyes we can accomplish this in 10 days.\n\n269\n00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:35.254\nYes, it can be done, and\nthose teams have to do it.\n\n270\n00:15:35.254 --> 00:15:36.502\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n\n271\n00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:37.702\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it really is.\n\n272\n00:15:37.702 --> 00:15:39.971\nIt's kind of strange, but\nthat's what you want.\n\n273\n00:15:39.971 --> 00:15:43.109\nYou want the idea of the team\nto really be in it for\n\n274\n00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:47.821\nthat team effort to the point where\nthey are actually both interested in\n\n275\n00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:52.478\nwhat they really need to do, as well\nas focused on what they need to do.\n\n276\n00:15:52.478 --> 00:15:57.502\nAnd this is not just a, I'll work on\nit when I get the chance idea, right?\n\n277\n00:15:57.502 --> 00:16:00.211\nSo during these sprints\neverybody has to be focused\n\n278\n00:16:00.211 --> 00:16:03.570\nas well as interested in\nwhat they're doing, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.040\nAnd of course, trust and\n\n280\n00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.320\nrespect is also a key in this type\nof self directed team as well, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.100\nThey all understand that they go in for\nthe team win as well.\n\n282\n00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.657\nSo usually, I don't wanna say the motto,\nbut the unspoken idea-\n\n283\n00:16:19.657 --> 00:16:20.866\n&gt;&gt; The comradery.\n\n284\n00:16:20.866 --> 00:16:23.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the comradery is fairly simple.\n\n285\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.108\nThey win as a team or\nthey lose as a team, okay.\n\n286\n00:16:26.108 --> 00:16:30.603\nIt is not the idea that one individual\nsucceeds and everybody else fails, and\n\n287\n00:16:30.603 --> 00:16:35.260\nthat that individual gets to go,\nraw see I did my part I'm great at this.\n\n288\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.800\nYou guys, you're terrible at this,\nis not that idea.\n\n289\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.010\nThere is that idea of team spirit\nthat we really do focus in on, and\n\n290\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:47.270\nthey have the trust and respect that this\nis what's going to happen as well, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.820\nSo now,\n\n292\n00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.370\nwhen you have all those elements that are\ninvolved in that particular type of team.\n\n293\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.293\nThe result then is that you have people\nthat are now really focused in making sure\n\n294\n00:16:58.293 --> 00:17:02.570\nthat there is some deliverable at\nthe end of every iteration, okay.\n\n295\n00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.519\nAt the end of every two week sprint,\nat the end of that time period,\n\n296\n00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:08.140\nthat you have something\nthat you can show for that.\n\n297\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.040\nBecause you do, you have a very\nself directed team that said, yes,\n\n298\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.050\nwe can do it.\n\n299\n00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:17.827\nYou have competent people that\nknow that you can do it as well.\n\n300\n00:17:17.827 --> 00:17:22.089\nAnd now they want to make sure\nthey accomplish those goals too.\n\n301\n00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.193\nNow during these entire time, okay,\n\n302\n00:17:24.193 --> 00:17:28.093\nbecause they're not planning\nthe entirety of the whole project out.\n\n303\n00:17:28.093 --> 00:17:31.221\nThey're only worried about those\ntwo weeks sprints at a time.\n\n304\n00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:36.942\nIt makes it very easy for\nthem to continuously reevaluate, okay?\n\n305\n00:17:36.942 --> 00:17:40.665\nTake a look at the requirements that\nthey're actually having and see,\n\n306\n00:17:40.665 --> 00:17:43.779\nif there are anymore requirements\nthat need to be added in.\n\n307\n00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:46.999\nSo the Agile method is very good and\nactually saying all right,\n\n308\n00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.078\nanother requirement comes in, great.\n\n309\n00:17:49.078 --> 00:17:51.881\nThe good thing is we are only\npart with through this process.\n\n310\n00:17:51.881 --> 00:17:53.778\nAnd if that is the requirement for\n\n311\n00:17:53.778 --> 00:17:57.642\nthis iteration will definitely be\nable to incorporate it right in,\n\n312\n00:17:57.642 --> 00:18:01.596\nwithout there really being any type\nof major change that has to go on.\n\n313\n00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:04.689\nAnd that's because they are not\nfocused on the whole project,\n\n314\n00:18:04.689 --> 00:18:08.790\nthe real thing we're saying on this part\nthat change that you requested, Ronnie?\n\n315\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.259\nWe can incorporate it, but\nwe're really not even there yet.\n\n316\n00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:15.727\nOr yes, we can incorporate that right in\nbecause we're only working on this part\n\n317\n00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:16.840\nright now.\n\n318\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.844\nSo we don't have to worry about\nthe entirety of the whole thing,\n\n319\n00:18:19.844 --> 00:18:23.813\nbecause once we get that part in that now,\nRonnie is adding an extra requirement in.\n\n320\n00:18:23.813 --> 00:18:27.646\nWe know that for the next iteration,\nwe now have a new requirement.\n\n321\n00:18:27.646 --> 00:18:32.488\nAnd then that means that the next sprint,\nhas incorporated that in already.\n\n322\n00:18:32.488 --> 00:18:35.812\nAnd now you're actually adding that\nthroughout the entire project, and\n\n323\n00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:37.130\nyou're getting that.\n\n324\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.720\nSo it's kind of a very neat\nmethodology that allows for\n\n325\n00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.149\nprojects to be done fairly quickly.\n\n326\n00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:46.126\nAnd be able to change when they need to,\n\n327\n00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:51.003\nwithout having to kinda slow down and\nfigure out what effect does\n\n328\n00:18:51.003 --> 00:18:55.088\nthat gonna have on the project\nlater on down the line.\n\n329\n00:18:55.088 --> 00:18:59.634\nSo there's a lot of information here\nthat we do have to make sure that we\n\n330\n00:18:59.634 --> 00:19:01.111\ngather up and do this.\n\n331\n00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:02.695\nYou might wonder why?\n\n332\n00:19:02.695 --> 00:19:06.504\nWell, you're gonna remember that users\nwill constantly change their mind.\n\n333\n00:19:06.504 --> 00:19:10.022\nAt the very end they see a good product\nthat you're beginning to work on and\n\n334\n00:19:10.022 --> 00:19:12.029\nthen they go, you wanna know something?\n\n335\n00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:14.630\nI bet you they could add this in there,\nreally quickly.\n\n336\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.969\nIn Agile teams,\nthey don't mind that so much.\n\n337\n00:19:16.969 --> 00:19:18.448\nDon't get me wrong,\nit could be a headache.\n\n338\n00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:19.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n339\n00:19:19.383 --> 00:19:22.890\nat the same time because of the way\nthat the Agile methodology works.\n\n340\n00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.610\nThey tend to be able to incorporate it\nfairly quickly, without there being a lot\n\n341\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.231\nof massive changes that have\nto go on in the background.\n\n342\n00:19:29.231 --> 00:19:32.149\nBecause they're really working\non those incremental units for\n\n343\n00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:34.049\nthat deliverable that they have, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:37.044\n&gt;&gt; Definitely a lot more manageable\nthere than having to go back and\n\n345\n00:19:37.044 --> 00:19:40.381\nrework from the beginning if we're\njust focusing on those strengths.\n\n346\n00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:43.061\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhat do we really need to do then,\n\n347\n00:19:43.061 --> 00:19:47.488\nonce we start talking about this idea of\nusing some type of agile methodology?\n\n348\n00:19:47.488 --> 00:19:49.270\nThe very basics here, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.840\nWell, let's take a look at my screen and\nI've listed out some to try and\n\n350\n00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.230\nhelp us out, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.518\nFirst and foremost,\n\n352\n00:19:55.518 --> 00:20:00.178\nthe way that we get started here is we\nestablish what we call a backlog, okay?\n\n353\n00:20:00.178 --> 00:20:04.418\nNow notice this, it says make a list of\nfeatures that will become the work for\n\n354\n00:20:04.418 --> 00:20:05.620\nthe project, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.550\nThe work to do for the project.\n\n356\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.266\nNow, even though this is\na to do list of sorts.\n\n357\n00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:13.153\nIt is not only that, okay?\n\n358\n00:20:13.153 --> 00:20:16.050\nThe idea of what we're creating here,\nright?\n\n359\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.262\nIs the very beginning that\nwe actually do have a list\n\n360\n00:20:19.262 --> 00:20:24.200\nof the items that we really need to\ngo ahead and be able to accomplish.\n\n361\n00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.720\nBut the way the Agile worked with this is\nthat they call it building the backstory,\n\n362\n00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.285\nright?\n\n363\n00:20:30.285 --> 00:20:32.663\nThe user's stories is what they call it.\n\n364\n00:20:32.663 --> 00:20:34.930\nSo every single task that we have,\n\n365\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.298\nthere normally is associated\na story behind that.\n\n366\n00:20:38.298 --> 00:20:42.611\nNow it doesn't mean that it has to be\na long elaborate story, but it might be.\n\n367\n00:20:42.611 --> 00:20:47.770\nThis is the way that Cherokee\nwould interface with my software.\n\n368\n00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.911\nSo Cherokee is on an iPhone.\n\n369\n00:20:49.911 --> 00:20:51.970\nSo what do I need to do\nto get that accomplished?\n\n370\n00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.662\nOr Cherokee is on an android.\n\n371\n00:20:54.662 --> 00:20:57.965\nIt's the idea of actually\nsaying here it is, here it's\n\n372\n00:20:57.965 --> 00:21:02.839\nbroken down into that workable unit, but\nthat there's a story behind it as well.\n\n373\n00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:08.025\nBut this backlog is also considered\na prioritized list as well.\n\n374\n00:21:08.025 --> 00:21:13.509\nAnd then the work that we tend to\ndo inside of each of the sprints.\n\n375\n00:21:13.509 --> 00:21:18.157\nIs that once we've actually accomplished\none of those items that's done, okay?\n\n376\n00:21:18.157 --> 00:21:21.353\nIn this backlog and\nthere's more that needs to be done or\n\n377\n00:21:21.353 --> 00:21:24.490\nwe've finished with the entire program.\n\n378\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.177\nWhat we now need to do is go ahead and\n\n379\n00:21:27.177 --> 00:21:31.548\npull more from this idea of\nwhat they call that backlog.\n\n380\n00:21:31.548 --> 00:21:35.152\nNow if you're like me, you kind of\ncame to this and go what the heck,\n\n381\n00:21:35.152 --> 00:21:38.090\nbacklog, that's usually a bad thing,\nright?\n\n382\n00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:40.306\nNormally, when I think about a backlog,\n\n383\n00:21:40.306 --> 00:21:43.800\nit's like things that should have\nbeen done that weren't done.\n\n384\n00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.526\nBut in the world of Agile and\nScrum methodologies here, or Scrum method.\n\n385\n00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:53.936\nThey really love this idea of a backlog as\nmeaning that very highly prioritized list\n\n386\n00:21:53.936 --> 00:21:55.575\nof things that need to be done.\n\n387\n00:21:55.575 --> 00:21:57.397\n&gt;&gt; So what's so\nspecial about this backlog?\n\n388\n00:21:57.397 --> 00:22:00.938\nYou say that they love it, but\ncould you explain that a little bit more?\n\n389\n00:22:00.938 --> 00:22:04.747\n&gt;&gt; It's because it really is something\nthat they don't have to guess what needs\n\n390\n00:22:04.747 --> 00:22:05.578\nto be done next.\n\n391\n00:22:05.578 --> 00:22:09.449\nIf you now have the entirety of everything\nthat really needs to be done for\n\n392\n00:22:09.449 --> 00:22:11.865\nthat particular sprint, all listed there.\n\n393\n00:22:11.865 --> 00:22:15.949\nWhat it means is your particular\nteam then, when they start working,\n\n394\n00:22:15.949 --> 00:22:17.827\nyou don't have to assign them.\n\n395\n00:22:17.827 --> 00:22:20.355\nYou better work on this task,\nyou better work on this task,\n\n396\n00:22:20.355 --> 00:22:21.628\nyou better work on this task.\n\n397\n00:22:21.628 --> 00:22:24.459\nThey can look at it at the list and go,\nhere is what I'm gonna start working on.\n\n398\n00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:27.270\nHere is what I'm gonna start working on,\nhere is what I'm gonna start working on.\n\n399\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.570\nCherokee gets finished\nbefore I do on mine.\n\n400\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.324\nShe didn't have to sit around and\nwait for the project manager,\n\n401\n00:22:33.324 --> 00:22:34.650\ntell her what to do next, why?\n\n402\n00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.078\nBecause we have a backlog.\n\n403\n00:22:36.078 --> 00:22:40.305\nSo Cherokee simply goes into the backlog\nand checks off the elements and goes,\n\n404\n00:22:40.305 --> 00:22:44.989\nokay, Ronny's working here, Megan's\nworking here, Peter's working here.\n\n405\n00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:49.124\nHere's three items left in this particular\nsprint that needs to be worked on.\n\n406\n00:22:49.124 --> 00:22:52.602\nCherokee can pick from those items and\nsay, here it is.\n\n407\n00:22:52.602 --> 00:22:56.269\nI've done mine, I'm gonna go ahead and\nstart working on this.\n\n408\n00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:59.704\nSo they love it because it does give\nthem that ability to work through that,\n\n409\n00:22:59.704 --> 00:23:00.589\nif they choose to.\n\n410\n00:23:00.589 --> 00:23:03.815\nNow don't get me wrong,\nyou might find out that your Scrum master,\n\n411\n00:23:03.815 --> 00:23:06.597\nwhoever's actually doing this says,\nno Cherokee.\n\n412\n00:23:06.597 --> 00:23:08.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I need you to work on this now.\n\n413\n00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.933\nBut at times if it really\nis a self directed team.\n\n414\n00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:14.639\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is really where\nthat motivation comes into play.\n\n415\n00:23:14.639 --> 00:23:18.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it's like what we've talked\nabout this before too that if we really\n\n416\n00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.393\nenjoy the topics that we're teaching it's\nlike we have a little bit more in there.\n\n417\n00:23:23.393 --> 00:23:24.043\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n418\n00:23:24.043 --> 00:23:26.891\n&gt;&gt; And it's not that we're just competent,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n419\n00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:30.547\nwe like everything that we teach, but\nthere are areas that we're really good at.\n\n420\n00:23:30.547 --> 00:23:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Or passionate about, yeah.\n\n421\n00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.801\n&gt;&gt; Or passionate about.\n\n422\n00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:36.527\nSo that's the idea here,\nis that if we have projects like that,\n\n423\n00:23:36.527 --> 00:23:40.184\nit really does motivate us to be\nable to work on things that might\n\n424\n00:23:40.184 --> 00:23:43.579\nactually be incredibly productive\nin that sense as well.\n\n425\n00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:46.254\nSo when you start seeing\nthis type of backlog,\n\n426\n00:23:46.254 --> 00:23:50.384\nthere's usually two basic methodologies\nhere on the backlog, okay?\n\n427\n00:23:50.384 --> 00:23:53.695\nOne is that work is pulled from\nwhat we call iteratively and\n\n428\n00:23:53.695 --> 00:23:56.815\nthat is the idea of what we\ncall the Scrum methodology.\n\n429\n00:23:56.815 --> 00:23:58.664\nOkay, so\nthat's where Scrum really does come in.\n\n430\n00:23:58.664 --> 00:23:59.887\nIt says, all right, here it is.\n\n431\n00:23:59.887 --> 00:24:01.160\nYou only pull from this section here.\n\n432\n00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.178\nBut there's also other methodologies\nthat also come into play.\n\n433\n00:24:05.178 --> 00:24:08.369\nYou might hear about Kanban,\nwhich is essentially saying, all right,\n\n434\n00:24:08.369 --> 00:24:10.210\nwe'll just continue to add to this list.\n\n435\n00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.390\nAnd you pull from it as things\nactually develop along the way, too.\n\n436\n00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.891\nYou name it, it's always there to when\nyou start talking about this iterative\n\n437\n00:24:17.891 --> 00:24:18.750\napproach as well.\n\n438\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.870\nThe other thing about for\nus here in Agile and in terms of Scrum.\n\n439\n00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.120\nNow you might go,\nwhy did he start talking about Scrum?\n\n440\n00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:33.170\nWell, Agile really bases itself on this\nidea of this Scrum technique as well.\n\n441\n00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.540\nAnd what we call sprints, which is,\nagain, same ideas that come into play.\n\n442\n00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.710\nBut those are the terms\nthat you'll generally see,\n\n443\n00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.098\ntoo, is what we call continuous\nintegration or continuous feedback, okay.\n\n444\n00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.850\nBecause of the way that we\nare working through this and\n\n445\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:51.690\nthat iterative approach, right,\nwe have the ability to stop and\n\n446\n00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.560\nask, is everything going\nthe way that we want to, okay?\n\n447\n00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.280\nSo changes are integrated\nin fairly quickly and\n\n448\n00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.430\neasily because of those integrations.\n\n449\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.900\nAnd we can now go on, is this good?\n\n450\n00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.610\nAnd someone goes, no, that wasn't\nreally what I was thinking about.\n\n451\n00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.550\nIt's easier to make, what, small changes\nalong the way than to go at the very end,\n\n452\n00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.820\nand now you look at it and\ngo that's terrible.\n\n453\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.790\nI don't even wanna touch it.\n\n454\n00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.260\nThe whole thing that you have.\n\n455\n00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.050\nSo just kind of realize,\nthat is a part of it.\n\n456\n00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:22.250\nNow just because I said there isn't\nany long term planning to anything,\n\n457\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.450\ndoesn't mean that there\nisn't planning at all, okay.\n\n458\n00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.570\nSo there is actually some\nplanning that needs to go on.\n\n459\n00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.928\nBut a lot of times you actually do have\nto think about the idea of what we call\n\n460\n00:25:33.928 --> 00:25:38.120\nsprint planning, okay,\nis really what it's called.\n\n461\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.520\nBut in CompTIA land,\nthey also call it Scrum planning as well.\n\n462\n00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.510\nSo you may hear those two terms\nthat you will end up finding out.\n\n463\n00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.404\n&gt;&gt; Something that I have heard\nbefore also was the Kanban method,\n\n464\n00:25:49.404 --> 00:25:50.920\nis that similar there?\n\n465\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.720\nWith the manufacturing and\nkeeping all the products in their bins and\n\n466\n00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.450\nkeeping the stock highly available,\nthings like that.\n\n467\n00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the same idea,\n\n468\n00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:03.440\nis that somebody instead\nactually continues to realize.\n\n469\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.088\nThe example that Cherokee is giving\nus is to make sure that we have\n\n470\n00:26:07.088 --> 00:26:10.550\nall those products that\nare necessary to be updated.\n\n471\n00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.060\nSo that we don't run out of them\nduring our products and manufacturing.\n\n472\n00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.820\nSo it is very possible that we have\nthose things in place to go ahead and\n\n473\n00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.620\ngo realize that.\n\n474\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.880\nAnd we have an automatic backlog that\nactually helps us to fill up, and\n\n475\n00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.388\nto actually pull and do the things\nthat we need to as well, okay.\n\n476\n00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.210\nAll right, now when we start\ntalking about that sprint, right,\n\n477\n00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.420\nthe things that need to be in place here.\n\n478\n00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.790\nWe've gotta make sure that we actually\nunderstand what's actually gonna be\n\n479\n00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.130\nexpected for us, as well as the overall\ngoals that we have here, okay.\n\n480\n00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.720\nWhen you set up a sprint then,\nokay, now this is where we\n\n481\n00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.020\nhave to go back to my screen just\na little bit to help us out here.\n\n482\n00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.450\nEstimate how long it\nwill actually take for\n\n483\n00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.260\nus to actually work through each story,\nas well.\n\n484\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:53.848\nSo here it is.\n\n485\n00:26:53.848 --> 00:26:57.181\nThis is now where we're starting\nto schedule out things, okay.\n\n486\n00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:01.710\nWe now need estimates of how this\nis going to end up happening, okay.\n\n487\n00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.930\nWe then set priorities, and\nthen we start the work as well for\n\n488\n00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.010\nthe iterations that we\nactually have in place.\n\n489\n00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.610\nSo here for the planning,\nyou do need to understand the outputs\n\n490\n00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.970\nthat are actually gonna be\nexpected from your sprint.\n\n491\n00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.230\nSo normally we actually set up a sprint\ngoal at the very beginning here, okay.\n\n492\n00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.820\nWhat are we actually\nexpecting to be achieved\n\n493\n00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.740\nduring our particular two-week sprint?\n\n494\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:29.410\nNow when I say that, you might actually\nlist out like a paragraph of things.\n\n495\n00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.950\nBut what you want for your team is this.\n\n496\n00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:37.810\nYou wanna be able to have them say\na one to two sentence summary,\n\n497\n00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:43.680\nokay, of what your team goal\nis gonna be for that sprint.\n\n498\n00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.690\nSo that way when somebody asks, Cherokee,\nwhat are you working on right now?\n\n499\n00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.080\nShe doesn't have to go, well, let me tell\nyou the technical details behind it.\n\n500\n00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.840\nShe can give a one to two sentence summary\n\n501\n00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.667\nthat now sticks in her mind of here's\nwhat my goal is going to be, okay.\n\n502\n00:27:59.008 --> 00:28:02.640\nWe also wanna make sure that the backlog\nthat we had is normally designed for\n\n503\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.950\nour particular sprint as well, okay.\n\n504\n00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.880\nAnd so usually along with the idea of\nthe sprint and the prioritization,\n\n505\n00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.490\nthere is normally an estimate of how\nlong that task is going to take.\n\n506\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.150\nAnd then, of course, the idea that of what\ndeliverable we're trying to accomplish,\n\n507\n00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.240\nthe user story that we're\ntrying to accomplish.\n\n508\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.058\nAnd then ultimately, right,\nthe overall goal is now,\n\n509\n00:28:23.058 --> 00:28:27.120\nthis is something that's\nactually kind of neat.\n\n510\n00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.610\nYou, as the project manager,\n\n511\n00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.450\nyou are not there just trying to\nsay here's what you better do.\n\n512\n00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.880\nBut because of the way that\neverything came together and\n\n513\n00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.240\nit's a self-organized type of team.\n\n514\n00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.530\nThe working team is the one that tells you\nhow much can be done in that time period.\n\n515\n00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.050\nYou don't get to tell them,\nI know this is kind of strange,\n\n516\n00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:49.200\nproject managers love to say, here's how\nmuch work has to be done in this time.\n\n517\n00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.470\nBut in the way that Scrum works is like\nhere's how much we can really, literally,\n\n518\n00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.310\nrealistically I should say not literally,\n\n519\n00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:00.410\nrealistically accomplish in\nthe time that we're actually given.\n\n520\n00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:04.080\nAnd so it's the team members\nthat actually decide that and\n\n521\n00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.160\nwhat they can do during sprint.\n\n522\n00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:11.000\nIt's not an arbitrary decision by somebody\nenforcing an arbitrary time limit for\n\n523\n00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.970\nwhat we actually have in place.\n\n524\n00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:15.810\nSo just kind of realize\nthat there are multiple\n\n525\n00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.606\nunits that we actually\ndo have to think about.\n\n526\n00:29:18.606 --> 00:29:21.710\nAnd realize when we start to take a look\n\n527\n00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.860\nat the idea of planning out sprint\nmeetings and everything else.\n\n528\n00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.880\nSo here it is, we're kind of\nat that particular point where\n\n529\n00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.930\nyou have at least the basics\nthat are in place here.\n\n530\n00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.580\nWell, we've talked about the differences,\nright?\n\n531\n00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:40.870\nYou understand the waterfall\nversus the agile method as well.\n\n532\n00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.850\nAnd then some of the elements\nthat we've talked about.\n\n533\n00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.690\nThese are actually key terms that you\nmight wanna make sure that you know for\n\n534\n00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:46.730\nthe exam, too.\n\n535\n00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.320\n&gt;&gt; I think that about wraps it up for\ntoday, Ronnie.\n\n536\n00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.840\nWe've been able to go ahead and\n\n537\n00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.990\nlook at our identifying or\nagile basic methodologies.\n\n538\n00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.080\nYou introduced us to the concept\nof our sprints, and how important\n\n539\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.460\nit is to choose a really qualified team to\ngo ahead and achieve those sprint goals.\n\n540\n00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.230\nYou were also able to go ahead and show us\n\n541\n00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:12.240\nhow a backlog is useful in this particular\nsituation in addition to sprint planning.\n\n542\n00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.180\nHow we're really just\nlooking at those smaller,\n\n543\n00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.590\nworkable, manageable units instead\nof planning the entire project.\n\n544\n00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.370\nMoving forward we're gonna be\nlooking at some more Scrum detail.\n\n545\n00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.880\nSo stay tuned,\nyou guys don't wanna miss that.\n\n546\n00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.442\nThank you for\njoining us today here at ITProTV.\n\n547\n00:30:26.442 --> 00:30:27.647\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n548\n00:30:27.647 --> 00:30:28.575\nAnd I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n549\n00:30:28.575 --> 00:30:30.389\n&gt;&gt; Signing off.\n\n550\n00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:36.920\n[MUSIC]\n\n551\n00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.033\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:10.890\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV\n\n4\n00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.960\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode\n\n5\n00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.590\nhere at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.260\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.640\nToday we're going to be\nlooking at our project.\n\n8\n00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.150\nPlus, we're going to be\nexploring the agile methodology.\n\n9\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.130\nIf you've been following along,\n\n10\n00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.570\nyou know that we've already\ntaken a look at the basics.\n\n11\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.240\nBut here we have Mr. Ronnie Long with\nus to go ahead and explain the details.\n\n12\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.870\nThank you for for\njoining us today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n14\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.800\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non taking a look at the agile methodology.\n\n15\n00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.070\nRemember that we are not really getting\ninto every aspect of how agile functions\n\n16\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.370\nand where there are complete week long\nworkshops that you can attend of course.\n\n17\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.430\nAnd there is even certifications for\nit that you can get to.\n\n18\n00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.650\nBut for our purposes we want at least to\nunderstand the methodology behind it.\n\n19\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.300\nNow, in previous episodes we've already\ncovered some of the very basics.\n\n20\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.570\nIncluding of course, sprint planning, and\n\n21\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.030\nthen the differences between the way\nwe traditionally do products.\n\n22\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.330\nSuch as using the waterfall method and\nof course the agile methodology as well.\n\n23\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.520\nSo there's plenty for us to go through,\nbut now we need to actually continue on\n\n24\n00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.740\nbecause there's other\nthings that need to happen.\n\n25\n00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.230\nWith the way the agile functions and,\nor with the way the agile team,\n\n26\n00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.000\nexcuse me, functions.\n\n27\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.980\nWe have to be very clear and understanding\nhow team members are actually gonna play\n\n28\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.700\na very active and important part of\neverything dealing with that project.\n\n29\n00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.970\nAnd what we cannot have happen, okay,\nduring an agile type of sprint Is that\n\n30\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.560\nsomebody withhold information that\nis gonna be crucial to the team.\n\n31\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.660\nSo the way that they break this down,\n\n32\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.990\nto make sure that good solid\ncommunication happens.\n\n33\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.090\nIs that at the beginning of everyday, they\ntend to have a status meeting as a sort.\n\n34\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.950\nAnd usually those status\nmeetings really are to.\n\n35\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.850\nHelp us do three different things here,\nokay?\n\n36\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.640\nOne, they help us to review\nwhat we have done in the past.\n\n37\n00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.250\nIn other words,\nwhat did I end up doing yesterday, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.670\nThen, what am I actually doing next.\n\n39\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.030\nAnd finally,\nany other issues that we are facing.\n\n40\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.250\nSo these stand up meetings\nare actually very important to\n\n41\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.220\nthe way that the scrome methodology works\nand the agile methodology works as well.\n\n42\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.050\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, every morning here at IT Pro TV\nwe have to go ahead and have a stand up\n\n43\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.720\nmeeting to cover any kind of obstacles we\nmay be facing with any current projects.\n\n44\n00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.210\nAnd our goals for that day.\n\n45\n00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.620\nIs that the same as the meeting\nthat you're talking about here?\n\n46\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.110\nWould it fall under that category?\n\n47\n00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.720\n&gt;&gt; It can.\n\n48\n00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.710\nOur meetings are typically that same\nidea where it's a status meeting\n\n49\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.670\nin which we should come to that meeting\nas people part of the IT Pro TV team.\n\n50\n00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.860\nSaying, hey, here's what we did yesterday\nand here's what we're about to do,\n\n51\n00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.780\nand here's some of the issues\nthat we're facing.\n\n52\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.080\nBut for us it really is just\nan update to allow everybody to\n\n53\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.670\njust know what is happening.\n\n54\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.730\nAnd, if they have any questions\nat that particular point in time\n\n55\n00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.480\nthat's when questions are asked.\n\n56\n00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.560\nUsually scrum meetings are designed to\nreally be informative in terms of status.\n\n57\n00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.140\nMore than anything else, they're not\nsupposed to last any longer than about 10,\n\n58\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.080\n15 minutes at the max.\n\n59\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.060\nAnd they are by nature stand up meetings.\n\n60\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.420\nSo you don't sit down and\nkind of get rested and comfortable.\n\n61\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.660\nThe goal is simple, right?\n\n62\n00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.350\nIt's to bring that energy\nto that meeting and say,\n\n63\n00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.310\nhere is everything we've\naccomplished yesterday.\n\n64\n00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.000\nHere's what I'm doing next, and I may\nneed help in getting this done today.\n\n65\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.700\nAnd somebody normally says,\nyeah just see me after the meeting and\n\n66\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.980\nwe'll get that straightened out.\n\n67\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.040\nWhatever it might be those are pretty\nmuch the key goals here, is that their\n\n68\n00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.480\nstand up because as soon as that meetings\nover we want work to really begin.\n\n69\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.580\nAnd the same thing even with\nour own stand up meetings.\n\n70\n00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.300\nThat's the goal and desire.\n\n71\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.550\nSo we borrowed from the scrum idea and\nthe agile method to try and make sure\n\n72\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.180\nthat we start off every day right and that\neverybody understands what's going on.\n\n73\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.350\nBut now that our company has grown.\n\n74\n00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.320\nIt becomes larger than kind of a small\nteam in which everything can get done\n\n75\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.500\nthat way, where everybody can say all\nthese things in 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n76\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.960\nAnd sometimes these particular\ntopics that we have to cover,\n\n77\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.410\nthey may be very diverse and they at least\nhelp us to understand what's going on.\n\n78\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.600\nBut in normal Scrum meetings, right?\n\n79\n00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.960\nWe wanna make sure that those three\nevents are always happening as well.\n\n80\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.100\nNow along with this, of course,\nis who tends to attend Scrum meetings?\n\n81\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.930\nWell first and foremost,\nevery team member.\n\n82\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.060\nWhy?\nBecause they are the ones that are doing\n\n83\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.400\nthe work, itself.\n\n84\n00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.630\nSo it's very important that\nthey have this opportunity\n\n85\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.450\nto allow everybody to know what the\nprogress is on work that they're doing.\n\n86\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.255\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\n&gt;&gt; For them.\n\n87\n00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:40.805\n&gt;&gt; One thing you mentioned\nearlier was collaboration.\n\n88\n00:04:40.805 --> 00:04:43.525\nLet's say,\nthere's an obstacle that I am facing and\n\n89\n00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:48.085\nmaybe someone on my team has experience\nwith overcoming that obstacle in the past.\n\n90\n00:04:48.085 --> 00:04:49.505\nThis seems like a good opportunity for\n\n91\n00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:51.835\nthem to kind of chime in and\nhelp out their teammates.\n\n92\n00:04:51.835 --> 00:04:53.015\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it really is.\n\n93\n00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:57.495\nAnd the key here again in this type of\nmeeting is not that all of the sudden this\n\n94\n00:04:57.495 --> 00:05:01.290\nis what Cherokee does As well Ronnie, let\nme explain to you exactly how to do that.\n\n95\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.040\nThat's not what that means for, it's to\nhelp identify that Ronnie needs help.\n\n96\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.120\nAnd that way Cherokee can\nafterwards go to Ronnie and say-\n\n97\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.350\n&gt;&gt; Have a breakaway meeting.\n\n98\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.710\n&gt;&gt; Have a breakaway meeting unto\nyourselves as far as that goes and\n\n99\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.590\nthen help out at that point.\n\n100\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.710\nBut it really is, it's about status,\nit's about the idea that I may need help.\n\n101\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.680\nAnd then getting the help that they\nneed immediately after that meeting.\n\n102\n00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.940\nIf you stop and do this for\n\n103\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.580\neverybody where everybody gets to offer\ntheir explanation on what's going on.\n\n104\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.380\nIt turns in to a whole another\ntype of meeting at that point.\n\n105\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.705\n&gt;&gt; Like a brainstorming or something.\n\n106\n00:05:36.705 --> 00:05:39.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then now the ideas is\nstarting in 15 minutes after you\n\n107\n00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.250\nstarted the meeting.\n\n108\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.110\nIt's just about impossible.\n\n109\n00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.550\nSo it's really key that we\nare able to get through that.\n\n110\n00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.210\nSo every team member\ngenerally has to participate.\n\n111\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.760\nBut the way that we keep this going,\nright,\n\n112\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.050\ninstead of it turning into something\nlike what Cherokee is talking about,\n\n113\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.140\nthis brainstorming meeting,\nwhich, have you tried this?\n\n114\n00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.388\nNo I didn't try that.\n\n115\n00:05:57.388 --> 00:05:59.690\nAnd then Cherokee brings up another one,\nand all the sudden it's like,\n\n116\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.010\nthe next person is like,\nI'd really like to tell what I want to do.\n\n117\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.050\nYou have a leader of this meeting.\n\n118\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.420\nAnd typically that is\nknown as a scrum master.\n\n119\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.480\nDoes that sound like a title\nyou'd like to have, Cherokee?\n\n120\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.565\nA scrum master.\n\n121\n00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:15.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sounds like a little dingy or\ngrungy.\n\n122\n00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you know what?\n\n123\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.380\nIf you need someone to keep\neveryone else on track and\n\n124\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.290\nkeep the conversation moving\nthen that's what it takes.\n\n125\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so, this particular idea,\n\n126\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.910\nthe scrum master is gonna be the one\nthat facilitates this meeting.\n\n127\n00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.450\nAnd kinda reminds\neverybody at the beginning.\n\n128\n00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.690\nThis is what we need to focus in on.\n\n129\n00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.990\nAnd if you do need help make sure\nit's actually after the meeting,\n\n130\n00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.730\nit doesn't have to happen\nduring the meeting as well.\n\n131\n00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.450\nAlso, you may end up\nwith the product owner.\n\n132\n00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.130\nNow, not always.\n\n133\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.080\nIf the product owner is\ninvited to the scrum meeting.\n\n134\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.480\nThen, yes.\n\n135\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.910\nThe reason why is that you may\nhave questions where you want or\n\n136\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.410\nyou want that particular\nowner to be there.\n\n137\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.820\nAnd you may wanna express\nthe concerns that you have.\n\n138\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.610\nAnd then afterwards, they're there to\nbe able to answer those questions.\n\n139\n00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.750\nAnd now instead of them having to sit down\nwith Cherokee and then Ronnie and then.\n\n140\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.140\nDavid, whoever might be,\nto answer every individual question.\n\n141\n00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.490\nAt this point with the product\nowner being in that scrub meeting,\n\n142\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.990\nthe hear the questions.\n\n143\n00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.310\nThey understand what\nquestion they may have.\n\n144\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.620\nAnd now when it comes down\nto that product owner.\n\n145\n00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.740\nThey may say well,\nI'm here to answer those questions and\n\n146\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.330\nwill do that immediately\nafter the meeting if we can.\n\n147\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.960\nIn that way, you have all the information\nthat you need and you are ready to go.\n\n148\n00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.010\nSo, those are really important\nmeetings because they happen daily and\n\n149\n00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.170\nit ensures that everybody is able\nto start on the right track.\n\n150\n00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:43.210\nSo that they either are getting set to\nstart the task that's ahead of them.\n\n151\n00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.650\nOr they get the help that they need to\novercome whatever obstacle they're facing.\n\n152\n00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.570\nSo that's why these meetings\nare very important.\n\n153\n00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.815\nIf we just wait and go, we'll handle\nthat at Monday's weekly status meeting,\n\n154\n00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:56.712\nwell Monday may be too late.\n\n155\n00:07:56.712 --> 00:07:59.454\nSo daily meetings are very\nmuch a part of it, and\n\n156\n00:07:59.454 --> 00:08:02.275\nwe try to keep them short\nbecause usually for us.\n\n157\n00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:05.296\nIf you don't, meetings tend to\ndegrade into just, you know,\n\n158\n00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:08.090\nwell here's what I did this weekend,\nhere's what I did.\n\n159\n00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.310\nAnd so, instead,\n\n160\n00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.660\nit's all about the focus, making\nsure everybody has that same energy.\n\n161\n00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.680\nAnd you tend to treat it like a very good,\nvery mini pep rally where you go,\n\n162\n00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.930\nall right, everybody let's\nget to work at the very end.\n\n163\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.730\nAnd continue to go on your way.\n\n164\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.970\nSo in that sense they are really\ngood if everybody can manage it.\n\n165\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.106\nSo part of that basic methodology is also\ndoing these types of meetings as well,\n\n166\n00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:29.683\nOkay?\n\n167\n00:08:29.683 --> 00:08:30.689\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n168\n00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:34.490\nAlright, now, there's one other thing\nthat we also have to talk about.\n\n169\n00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.420\nThat's part of our objectives\nthat we need to cover,\n\n170\n00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.420\nbut there's probably something\na little more unusual.\n\n171\n00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.420\nWhich is what we call a burn down chart,\nokay.\n\n172\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.960\nNow you might be wondering what\nthe heck is a burn down chart about.\n\n173\n00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.220\nWell if you remember when we talked about\nthe idea of sprints and the backlog.\n\n174\n00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:55.110\nWell it's not enough that we just know\nwhat is actually needing to be done.\n\n175\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.890\nWe need to be able to put those\nnot only into a timeline but\n\n176\n00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.190\nto prioritize them as well.\n\n177\n00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.100\nAnd to able to assign weight and\nvalue to them so\n\n178\n00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.920\nthat we can measure our\nperformance against them.\n\n179\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.390\nAnd the way that Scrum does it and\n\n180\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.410\nthe way that Agile does it is in\ncreating what we call a burn down chart.\n\n181\n00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.920\nLet me show you an example what\nI'm talking about here, okay.\n\n182\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.940\nSo here on my machine I\nhave a very basic chart.\n\n183\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.450\nI tried not to go insanely too complex for\nmy sake more than anything else.\n\n184\n00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.380\nBut let's say that over here on\nthe left-hand side, here is my\n\n185\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.990\nbacklog of activities that I have for\nthe project that I am about to begin.\n\n186\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.840\nSo we're going to create objectives list\nin what we're calling markdown here.\n\n187\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.710\nOkay?\nWe're going to break the objectives down\n\n188\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.510\ninto shownotes.\n\n189\n00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.380\nLet's just take for\nan example it's a show here on IT ProTV.\n\n190\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.050\nWe prepare whatever written\nnotes that we have.\n\n191\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.670\nWe research any additional\nmaterials that we may need to and\n\n192\n00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.250\nthen we prepare a diagrams or\nadditional displays that we need.\n\n193\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.840\nOkay, now when we start to talk about\nsomething like that, all right.\n\n194\n00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.000\nNotice that what we have to do, is we have\nto understand how much effort it takes,\n\n195\n00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.560\nto actually be able to do\neach one of those tasks.\n\n196\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.560\nAnd then, the sprints that allow us to\ndo this to prepare for the show as well.\n\n197\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.590\nAnd remember that sprints typically\nare the idea of defacto two weeks long.\n\n198\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.670\nDoesn't mean it has to be that.\n\n199\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.950\nIt could be two hours long if you want it\nto, but overall though you have to be able\n\n200\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.460\nto understand that each one of these\nrepresents each one of those activities.\n\n201\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.190\nAnd I've labelled them 1 through 5 just\nlike I have right here, as well, okay.\n\n202\n00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.050\nSo then, from that point what you do is\nyou assign an arbitrary value to them.\n\n203\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.300\nNow, I use very small numbers here,\nso notice I have two points here.\n\n204\n00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.910\nAnd then I said breakdown\nthe objectives into show segments and\n\n205\n00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.140\nI actually have ten points here.\n\n206\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.770\nAnd so I have a range,\nlet's say, of one to ten points.\n\n207\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.560\nAnd these are arbitrary, however\nyou choose to actually assign them.\n\n208\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.470\nTen, for me, being a fairly difficult task\nif not the hardest task and then of course\n\n209\n00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.270\none, two, three probably being easy\ntasks and the ones in the middle.\n\n210\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you're weighting those based\non difficulty and not numerical value.\n\n211\n00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.300\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nbased on what we call effort, right.\n\n212\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:08.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So for\n\n213\n00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.430\nme creating the objectives list and\nmark down as simple as copy and\n\n214\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.830\npaste from the official\nobjectives that I have.\n\n215\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.980\nAnd I can create those in\nmark down fairly easily.\n\n216\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.570\nSo if I now how to get to them and\nI know how to copy and\n\n217\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.150\npaste, I've got the mark down, I've got\nthat objective list created in mark down.\n\n218\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.450\nSo for me that's a fairly easy task.\n\n219\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.590\nBut then breaking those objectives\ndown into show segments for\n\n220\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.950\nwhat we have here is actually\na little bit harder.\n\n221\n00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.540\nAnd, Cherokee knows because\neven though I take a look and\n\n222\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.070\ngo I think this is 30 minutes.\n\n223\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.840\nCherokee's done a four part show with\nme where I thought it was gonna be\n\n224\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.980\na 30 minute show.\n\n225\n00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.690\nSo she kind of understands now that may be\na little bit harder than I think it is.\n\n226\n00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.770\nAt least, I see that Ronnie's having\na hard time doing it if nothing else.\n\n227\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.140\nSo for me,\nthat's a little bit harder to actually do.\n\n228\n00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.320\nSo, I gave it 10 points and\nthen preparing the actual\n\n229\n00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.710\nnotes which required of course typing\nthem out or writing them out here.\n\n230\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.050\nResearching, if there's any topic,\nthat I go.\n\n231\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.460\nI know kind of the basics of it,\nbut I need to know more about it.\n\n232\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.390\nI actually research that, and\nthen any other additional diagram,\n\n233\n00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.050\nsuch as the one that you're seeing.\n\n234\n00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.760\nI may also give it those points as well.\n\n235\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.510\nNow, you're probably wondering like,\nwell that was fairly easy.\n\n236\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.650\nYou gave everything ten points except for\nthe first one.\n\n237\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.110\nWell, that's so that I could keep\nthe math straight for what we'd have.\n\n238\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.570\nBut once you do this,\nyou can create a chart.\n\n239\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.560\nNow you don't have to do it like I did.\n\n240\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.830\nYou can do this inside of Excel and\ncreate a table and do this.\n\n241\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.430\nBut essentially,\nby assigning something like this here and\n\n242\n00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:37.380\nI've already gotten this pre-made\ntotal effort based on points.\n\n243\n00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.110\nNow, when I start to work through\nthis I might find out that\n\n244\n00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:46.800\nI can actually go ahead and\nassign some, well, points as well.\n\n245\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:55.293\nNow, let me do, this is 2, And then.\n\n246\n00:12:55.293 --> 00:12:58.429\nI'm just gonna copy this over,\nand let's say that at this point,\n\n247\n00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:01.890\nwhere I started breaking the show lists,\nthat I realized something.\n\n248\n00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.520\nOkay?\nEven though I thought it was going to\n\n249\n00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.800\njust take, it's gonna be difficult.\n\n250\n00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.560\nI found out something\nthat I got delayed or\n\n251\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.230\nwhatever it might be so\nI give it ten points at the beginning.\n\n252\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.590\nSo there's another ten.\n\n253\n00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.670\nAnd then at some point in time,\nsomething else ends up happening.\n\n254\n00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.520\nSo let's just go ahead.\n\n255\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.120\nI'm just gonna fill this out and\nshow you what else can happen.\n\n256\n00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.790\nCuz I'm not, and\nI'll continue to explain something that's\n\n257\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.990\nnot gonna be necessary for\nyou to think about right now, okay.\n\n258\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.000\nSo now notice, that means here's my\n42 points of effort which I have,\n\n259\n00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.250\nas far as total effort goes.\n\n260\n00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.980\nBut things can change.\n\n261\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.630\nWhat if right here in the middle of\npreparing the written show notes,\n\n262\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.620\nokay, I realized something.\n\n263\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.440\nI have to actually do more than that,\nokay?\n\n264\n00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.430\nThere's an additional\nrequirement added in.\n\n265\n00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:52.890\nSo if I take, let's say now,\nsome more information,\n\n266\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.590\nthen I have to add that into,\nwell, my segment here.\n\n267\n00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.210\nWell now, all of a sudden,\nlet's say that this now becomes 15 points.\n\n268\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.870\nAnd then let's say that this one,\nagain, because of delays or\n\n269\n00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.730\nwhatever else it might be where I had\nto add in a little bit more effort.\n\n270\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.160\nThis becomes 12,\n\n271\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.620\nlet me do 15 again because if not I'm\ngonna start losing my count here.\n\n272\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.380\nOkay?\nNow, you might be saying\n\n273\n00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.960\nwhy does this matter?\n\n274\n00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.660\nWell, the burn down chart\nis supposed to show how\n\n275\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.610\nfast we're essentially going through\neverything in our backlog, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.340\nIn other words,\nwe're going through the user stories here.\n\n277\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.820\nSo if I know each of these sprints,\nlet's say, is about two weeks long.\n\n278\n00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.940\nAnd at the end here.\n\n279\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.720\nThat's supposed to be ten weeks in time,\nas I go through these sprints.\n\n280\n00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.460\nAnd I should only expend\nabout 42 points in effort.\n\n281\n00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.190\nWhile I start to realize something\nat this particular point in time.\n\n282\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.620\nIf I add all this up, and here it is,\nI am only on week number eight.\n\n283\n00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:56.170\nI'm doing something, now that's\na little bit insane here but on week\n\n284\n00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.810\nnumber eight of doing all of this to get\nit ready for the shows that are coming up.\n\n285\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.520\nI've already spent 42 points.\n\n286\n00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.390\nWell, I start to realize\nsomething at this point here.\n\n287\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.140\nI'm not done with the project and\n\n288\n00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.090\nthat means I have at least\na lot more work effort to go.\n\n289\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:17.830\nSo, I am either going to burn through\nthe stories a lot slower than I need to,\n\n290\n00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.350\nwhich means it's gonna put\nme behind schedule, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.360\nOr I might find out\n\n292\n00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.030\nthat I burn through it a lot faster where\nall of a sudden I actually start to do it.\n\n293\n00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.300\nAnd now, I actually go ahead and\n\n294\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.160\neverything is done in a span\nof time very quickly instead.\n\n295\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.180\nAnd let's say that what ended\nup happening here is that\n\n296\n00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.410\nthese things really kind of just\ngot squished together instead.\n\n297\n00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.680\nSo now, here it is,\nwe're on week seven of ten.\n\n298\n00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.540\nAnd I went through all 42 points and\nI still have two weeks left.\n\n299\n00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.257\nWell, I kinda realize something here\nthat it did take me 42 weeks but\n\n300\n00:15:56.257 --> 00:15:57.896\nnow I'm ahead of time as well.\n\n301\n00:15:57.896 --> 00:16:01.678\nSo it gives us that ability then,\nwhen we start to take a look at the idea,\n\n302\n00:16:01.678 --> 00:16:05.770\nthe burn down A chart to see how quickly\nwe're actually going through all those\n\n303\n00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.560\nrequirements or we're doing it too slowly.\n\n304\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.670\nAnd then we bring that up inside\nour daily meetings to say,\n\n305\n00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.550\nall right well why are we behind on this?\n\n306\n00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.870\nWhy aren't we actually\ndoing what we need to?\n\n307\n00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.540\nAnd then you can actually\ndo it the other way too.\n\n308\n00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.600\nSo, sometimes you end up finding out that\nsomething didn't take you as long but\n\n309\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.470\nthat yet, you're still not burning\nthrough the way that you need to.\n\n310\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.740\nLet's say that this is five points and\n\n311\n00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.640\nthen this actually ended\nup being five points here.\n\n312\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.550\nAnd now you go, wait a minute.\n\n313\n00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.590\nThere's supposed to be\n42 points of effort.\n\n314\n00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.760\nEither I'm not putting as much\ntime into what I need to and\n\n315\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.670\nI'm burning through all\nthe stories again but\n\n316\n00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.450\nI'm still not actually getting\nthe amount of work I need.\n\n317\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.630\nSo, it's a quick graphical way for\nyou to be able to tell that, or for\n\n318\n00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.220\nthe scrum master to be able to tell that,\nand be able to help to kind of redirect\n\n319\n00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.680\nthat energy and\nthat focus to where it needs to be.\n\n320\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.780\n&gt;&gt; I like this concept-\n&gt;&gt; So these are very important.\n\n321\n00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.340\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't look too unfamiliar to us,\nbecause you showed us a method in which\n\n322\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.840\nwe could go ahead and plan out our\nbudget in a very similar way, so.\n\n323\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n324\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:08.080\nIt kind of all falls in the same way\nbecause there we actually talked about\n\n325\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.530\nthe idea of burn rate instead where we've\ntalked about how much money is spent,\n\n326\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.840\nand if we take that ratio right of actual\nmoney spent versus the earned value,\n\n327\n00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.690\nand the ratio is greater than one,\n\n328\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:22.640\nwell then we know we've actually\nspent too much money too quickly.\n\n329\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.770\nIf there's less,\n\n330\n00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.600\nthat means we didn't spent enough\nin the time that we needed to.\n\n331\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.330\nThe goal there is actually have a ratio\nof one to one where earned value and,\n\n332\n00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.470\nof course, actual cost are the same.\n\n333\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.748\nSo this does work along that same formula\nand if I remember right, in that show I\n\n334\n00:17:35.748 --> 00:17:38.976\nsaid you got to be careful here because\nlater on we're going to talk about burn\n\n335\n00:17:38.976 --> 00:17:42.329\ndown charts which we think is gonna be\nthe same, but it's not exactly the same.\n\n336\n00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:46.636\n&gt;&gt; So don't get those two terms confused,\nbut they have a very similar,\n\n337\n00:17:46.636 --> 00:17:49.849\nthey help you identify any\nkind of time management or\n\n338\n00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:53.734\nif you're over budget under\nbudget with either money or time.\n\n339\n00:17:53.734 --> 00:17:58.378\n&gt;&gt; Yup and that brings us to our last\nof our basics that we need to talk\n\n340\n00:17:58.378 --> 00:18:03.367\nabout as well which is what is called\nthe scrum retrospective I can't\n\n341\n00:18:03.367 --> 00:18:05.880\nactually say the word correctly.\n\n342\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.910\nLet me make sure I'm saying that,\nyeah scrum retrospective.\n\n343\n00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.610\nNow when I say scrum retrospective\nyou may go I've never heard of that.\n\n344\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.250\nAnd the reason why is that most\nproject management books and\n\n345\n00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.040\nyou know software designer books\nthat go through this type of method\n\n346\n00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.940\nthey call them Sprint retrospectives.\n\n347\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.700\nThis is a fairly important part\n\n348\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.360\nof dealing in the method of\nusing Agile methodology here.\n\n349\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.883\nThis is the time where you can actually\nstart to implement changes in the overall\n\n350\n00:18:36.883 --> 00:18:42.700\nteam behavior itself, and the the team\nculture itself it needs to be.\n\n351\n00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.390\nNow what do I mean by that?\n\n352\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.570\nWell, the story then in\nthe retrospectives are not so\n\n353\n00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:53.310\nmuch about what needs to be done\nin terms of the backlog okay?\n\n354\n00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:58.970\nIn this type of retrospective the focus\nis on how the team is working together.\n\n355\n00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:07.010\nAnd the focus is on how the team members\nactually individually work themselves.\n\n356\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.310\nNow, why is that important?\n\n357\n00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.250\nWell in that two week sprint right,\n\n358\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:15.800\neverything has to gel together to\nmake that deliverable possible.\n\n359\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.570\nSo, what you may do is that there may\nbe a point in time in which you go,\n\n360\n00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.800\nyou know,\nI just noticed something about Ronnie.\n\n361\n00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.150\nEvery 15 minutes he does\nthis weird thing and\n\n362\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:31.480\nit's causing him to delay and\nI need to help him out by saying,\n\n363\n00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.080\nthis is actually an extra step that you're\nadding in that we really don't need.\n\n364\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.500\nSo in that particular time, during\nthe retrospective meeting, remember,\n\n365\n00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.080\nwe're not talking about\nthe tasks that need to be done.\n\n366\n00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.410\nWe all know what the tasks\nthat need to be done, but\n\n367\n00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.560\nnow we're really trying to do what?\n\n368\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.270\nWe're trying to help each other,\nokay, by saying,\n\n369\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.960\nhere's what needs to be done\na bit more efficiently, okay?\n\n370\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.490\nHere's how we are working together,\nor how we aren't working together.\n\n371\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.110\nIf one reason or another,\nRonnie is just being a primadonna.\n\n372\n00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.890\nHopefully that doesn't happen, ever.\n\n373\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.390\nBut Ronnie is just being\na primadonna.about this, it is that time\n\n374\n00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:09.335\nduring that meting where the scrum master\ncan say we need to deal with this now and\n\n375\n00:20:09.335 --> 00:20:10.965\nlet's make sure we get this on hand.\n\n376\n00:20:10.965 --> 00:20:14.165\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, would I go ahead and\nwait until after that two-week duration,\n\n377\n00:20:14.165 --> 00:20:15.765\nthat sprint has been completed?\n\n378\n00:20:15.765 --> 00:20:18.935\nOr if I saw a problem that was\nhappening and I wanted to address\n\n379\n00:20:18.935 --> 00:20:22.575\nit immediately could I just go ahead and\ncall for one of these meetings?\n\n380\n00:20:22.575 --> 00:20:25.835\n&gt;&gt; And once again,\nyou wouldn't call for it yourself.\n\n381\n00:20:25.835 --> 00:20:27.250\nIt's not like a time out.\n\n382\n00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You tend to go to your scrum master and\n\n383\n00:20:29.415 --> 00:20:33.970\nsay we need to change this and then that's\nwhen you do call for or he calls for\n\n384\n00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.230\na meeting and it could be during the\nmiddle of that project where you call for\n\n385\n00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.660\nthis retrospective.\n\n386\n00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.520\nAnd you say here's what I'm\nnoticing is that Ronnie keeps\n\n387\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.320\nrepeating this process over and\nit's delaying us in getting things done\n\n388\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.882\nbecause he keeps doing it like four times\ninstead of the you know, once or twice or\n\n389\n00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:54.440\nRonnie keeps holding everything so\nthat we actually have to wait on him.\n\n390\n00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.540\nWhatever it might be,\nit's something that has to be addressed.\n\n391\n00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.950\nAnd so,\nthe big difference between that, and\n\n392\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.440\nwhat we're talking about\nin a daily meeting.\n\n393\n00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.580\nDaily meetings are about\nwhat has to be done, right?\n\n394\n00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.230\nThis meeting is really\nabout how is it done?\n\n395\n00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.210\nHow is it that Ronnie's working on this,\nand then how is he gelling in with\n\n396\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.100\nthe actual team members, And\nis it working or is it not?\n\n397\n00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.210\nIf it is working, then fine.\n\n398\n00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:21.330\nIf some tweaks need to be done, this is\nthe time for you to think about that and\n\n399\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:26.170\nmake sure that we go ahead and we adjust\nthem before we continue on with the work.\n\n400\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.330\nAnd now Cherokee is pulling her hair out,\n\n401\n00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:33.390\nbecause Ronnie is still doing the same\nold pattern and he is not changing, and\n\n402\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.535\nit's now not only driving Cherokee nuts,\nbut everybody else on the team.\n\n403\n00:21:36.535 --> 00:21:38.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's driving them nuts.\n\n404\n00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.020\nAnd they just,\nthey won't say anything, okay?\n\n405\n00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.680\nAnd they won't say anything about it.\n\n406\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.770\nBut the idea of what Agile says is,\n\n407\n00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.190\nif we need to we'll have\na meeting on it very quickly, why?\n\n408\n00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.830\nBecause Agile is designed for us to be\nable to change if we need to very quickly.\n\n409\n00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.590\nAnd we offer as much help\nas we need to quickly.\n\n410\n00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:00.160\nWe don't tell to get rid of people just\nbecause they, you know, they're different.\n\n411\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.060\nWe tend to try and go all right, remember\nwhat we're focused in on and here's some\n\n412\n00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.970\nof the changes that really need to be done\nso that we can be a bit more efficient or\n\n413\n00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.230\nto help Ronnie out because he's really\nfalling behind on these tasks and\n\n414\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.010\nthat's really what the idea\nof the retrospective's about.\n\n415\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:18.540\nSo just kind of realize that Agile\nis a very good possibility for us.\n\n416\n00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.250\nAs far as considering another methodology,\nbesides the waterfall methodology.\n\n417\n00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:28.440\nIt's just one of many, but it is the one\nthat the CompTIA Project+ does call out.\n\n418\n00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.900\nSo make sure you take a look at the basics\nthat we've just been talking about.\n\n419\n00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes thank you so much Ronnie.\n\n420\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.410\nWe've been able to go ahead and\nlook at those scrum meetings,\n\n421\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.670\nthose daily stand ups.\n\n422\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:40.810\nWe also took a look at how they differ\nfrom our actual scrum retrospective\n\n423\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:46.150\nmeetings and we also saw your burn down\nmethodology where we had our effort points\n\n424\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:50.120\nand how they were important in helping\nmanage the effort that's put forth for\n\n425\n00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.890\nthese individual sprints.\n\n426\n00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.440\nSo, stay tuned guys, we have a lot\nmore Project+ coming your way.\n\n427\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.600\nThank you for tuning in,\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n428\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.700\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n429\n00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.854\n&gt;&gt; Signing off.\n\n430\n00:23:00.854 --> 00:23:06.530\n[MUSIC]\n\n431\n00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:10.215\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:10.782\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:16.860\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another CompTIA Project Plus\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.684\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:24.780\nIn this episode, we're gonna be looking at\nexplaining our project management roles.\n\n7\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.790\nAnd here to help us with that, we have Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.040\nRonnie Wong, thank you for\nbeing here today Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.160\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back on\nthis show as we continue on to take a look\n\n10\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.550\nat more of the CompTIA Project Plus.\n\n11\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.780\nEspecially in the area of\nresource management roles.\n\n12\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.350\nNow, we have to actually be very careful\nhere, as we now have everything ready for\n\n13\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.530\nthe planning stages, we've gotta remember\nthat, the schedule is not enough for\n\n14\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.410\nus to keep everything on track.\n\n15\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.440\nWe also need to have an understanding of\nthe way that resources are actually used,\n\n16\n00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.560\nand how we can actually assign them and\nmanage them a bit better.\n\n17\n00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.366\nSo that's\n&gt;&gt; What type of resources might we\n\n18\n00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.136\nencounter?\n\n19\n00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:05.435\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question here so\nas we start to take a look right,\n\n20\n00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:09.346\nthat we have multiple resources you've\ngot to remember that every resource\n\n21\n00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:11.180\nis not gonna to be the same.\n\n22\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.170\nSo, what we'd like to thank in project\nmanifestation while we're new at it,\n\n23\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.750\nis that a project that we're assigned\nto write has a fresh can of resources.\n\n24\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.760\nIt's like we open the door and\n\n25\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.790\nthen everything is actually a fresh and\nreal and I have everything that I need.\n\n26\n00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.230\nWhat you're gonna end up finding out\nin reality, the majority of the time,\n\n27\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.800\nnot gonna say every time.\n\n28\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.080\nIs that you rarely have everything that\nyou need during the planning stage, and\n\n29\n00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.550\nthat means there's a lot of things\nthat have to get coordinated and\n\n30\n00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.690\ngathered together.\n\n31\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.110\nAnd the types of resources that we tend\nto have to deal with are things like,\n\n32\n00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.430\nwhat we call, material resources.\n\n33\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.460\nIt's equipment as well as human resources,\ntoo.\n\n34\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.520\nAnd then we have sub-varieties of each one\nof those that we have to realize, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.253\nBut let's make sure we go over an\nexplanation of what each one of those are.\n\n36\n00:01:56.253 --> 00:01:59.490\nThey're fairly self-explanatory, but\nlet's make sure we understand why they're\n\n37\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.130\nactually that important\nthat we keep track of them.\n\n38\n00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.590\nFirst, when we talk about\nthe idea of equipment,\n\n39\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.940\nthat's kind of the easiest one, okay.\n\n40\n00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.870\nEquipment is something that\nwe tend dash to use, and\n\n41\n00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.440\nwe're able to reuse again in our project,\nokay.\n\n42\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.770\nSo that's actually very good, that's\nsomething that we like to have on hand.\n\n43\n00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.780\nBecause having the right\nequipment at the right time\n\n44\n00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.650\nallows us to go to accomplish our project\ntask, well, in a very timely manner and\n\n45\n00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.710\nusually in a fairly cost\nefficient manner as well.\n\n46\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.270\nThere is also, of course,\nmaterial resources.\n\n47\n00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.830\nNow, when you compare equipment\nresources versus material resources\n\n48\n00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.630\nin this sense well, the difference\nhere is that material resources tend\n\n49\n00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.060\nto be consumed during your project.\n\n50\n00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.590\nSo you may find out, let's say for\n\n51\n00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.320\nexample, if you're in the construction\nrealm of managing a project.\n\n52\n00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.382\nWhat you may have to actually do\nis you may have to buy lumber.\n\n53\n00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:59.570\nI was trying to think of the right word,\nI couldn't remember what it was, right.\n\n54\n00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.200\nSo you may actually have to buy\nlumber to build, the actual\n\n55\n00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.860\nproject of a home that your construction,\nor whatever it might be, okay.\n\n56\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.880\nWhat that resource is gonna\nbe used up in the building.\n\n57\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.970\nSo that resource is not gonna\nbe available next week,\n\n58\n00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.230\nyou might have to buy more resources,\nto actually compensate for that.\n\n59\n00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.270\nIf you're pouring a foundation,\nit's the idea of something like concrete.\n\n60\n00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.090\nIt's gonna be used as a consumable.\n\n61\n00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.830\nAs you start to do this,\nother things are also conceivable.\n\n62\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.910\nUsually, we don't track it down to this\nlevel, but if you want to you can.\n\n63\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.890\nThings like nails that somebody might\nactually be using inside of that.\n\n64\n00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.236\nOf caulk for\ninstalling other things here, right.\n\n65\n00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:39.400\nA wallpaper, glue, and\nall these are consumables and\n\n66\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.290\nthings that we don't tend to think about.\n\n67\n00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.260\nBut they are actually gonna be used up.\n\n68\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.230\nAnd then of course there is finally\nthe realm of human resources.\n\n69\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.830\nWhich is normally where we tend to spend\n\n70\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.570\nthe majority of our time when we\nstart talking about resources.\n\n71\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.870\nCuz that is by far the most complex\none that we have to deal with.\n\n72\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.700\nBecause those things, those particular\ntypes of resources, human resources.\n\n73\n00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.130\nAlways variable in many factors,\n\n74\n00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.740\nthose factors include of\ncourse skill level, okay.\n\n75\n00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.590\nInclude their availability at that\nparticular time, also include the amount\n\n76\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.990\nof work effort that they can produce,\nversus the ones that really can't produce.\n\n77\n00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.630\nSo there's a lot of\nvariables when you do that.\n\n78\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.960\nSo when you start taking a look at some\nof the different types of resources.\n\n79\n00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.736\nThose are, by far, the most generic\ntypes of resources we can deal with.\n\n80\n00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:25.539\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ronnie,\n\n81\n00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.251\ndo we have any total effort points\nthat can be assigned to individuals?\n\n82\n00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:31.405\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes and no,\nif you choose to, right?\n\n83\n00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:34.690\n[LAUGH] So in that sense, yeah.\n\n84\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.640\nIf you are one of those very detailed\noriented project management people.\n\n85\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.770\nYou might actually take every resource, or\nevery resource team that you know about.\n\n86\n00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.820\nAnd do what we've been talking out in\nterms of like the burned memory and\n\n87\n00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.260\nactually assign them effort points\nthroughout the entire schedule\n\n88\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.730\nthat you're actually saying I\nknow that I can count on him for\n\n89\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.160\nten points here and five points here.\n\n90\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.610\nYou can do something like that but\nwe don't generally intend to do that\n\n91\n00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.740\ntoo often cuz as the bigger the project\ngoes, it actually becomes a challenge\n\n92\n00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.450\nto actually try and maintain that is sort\nof like fantasy football at that point\n\n93\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.540\nin trying to keep track,\nit really is, it's more like that.\n\n94\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.070\nCan it be done?\n\n95\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.750\nYeah.\nBecause people play fantasy football and\n\n96\n00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.760\nknow exactly how to do\nthis in their heads.\n\n97\n00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.885\nI couldn't do this if you\nactually gave me a calculator and\n\n98\n00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:20.250\na program to do it but other people can.\n\n99\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.550\nSo, you can keep track of it that way,\nokay, if you chose to.\n\n100\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.550\nBut the breakdown that we also\nhave with those resources,\n\n101\n00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.390\nright, is not just the very\nfact that they exist and\n\n102\n00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.580\nwhat I've talked about as far as their\nindividualities and their characteristics.\n\n103\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.710\nBut it's also the very fact that\nresources, as far as a project goes,\n\n104\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.060\ntend to break down into two\ngeneral types of resources.\n\n105\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.360\nAnd they're actually considered\neither dedicated resources or\n\n106\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.340\nshared resources at this point.\n\n107\n00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.940\nSo you do need to pay attention when\nyou start thinking about this idea.\n\n108\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.220\nSo Cherokee, just for a moment here.\n\n109\n00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.150\nWhat do you think that the difference\nis when we talk about dedicated\n\n110\n00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.010\nresources versus shared resources?\n\n111\n00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.320\nI hope the name gives it away.\n\n112\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n113\n00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.390\nI think so.\n\n114\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.380\nIf I were a dedicated resource,\n\n115\n00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.880\nthen I would just have one particular\nfunction and one particular project, and\n\n116\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.070\nI wouldn't have to worry about splitting\nup my time amongst different projects.\n\n117\n00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.930\n&gt;&gt; That sounds exactly right, so\nright there is fairly easy so,\n\n118\n00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.160\nthis is one of those things that,\nit is as logical and makes sense.\n\n119\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.780\nWhen something like this happens\nthat as we start to break it down,\n\n120\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.080\nlet's talk about why these\nconsiderations are important,\n\n121\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.560\nespecially with shared resources\nversus dedicated resources.\n\n122\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.390\nDedicated is the easy one, and\n\n123\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.180\nthis is what Cherokee was pointing at,\nit was dedicated that means\n\n124\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.180\nthat this particular resource is\navailable to you on your project.\n\n125\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.030\nAnd really only to you, it's like\nexclusive to you to be available for\n\n126\n00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.740\nyour project.\n\n127\n00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.940\nAnd this includes things\nlike human resources.\n\n128\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.660\nIf somebody is assigned to your project\nteam and they are a dedicated resource,\n\n129\n00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.450\nthat means you can rely on them for\none hundred percent of their effort.\n\n130\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.600\nSo if you assign them to an eight-hour\nwork day, you can actually assign them to\n\n131\n00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.200\neight hours of total work on that\nparticular work day if you choose to.\n\n132\n00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.050\n&gt;&gt; I can imagine some of this exclusivity\ncould come at a price, especially maybe\n\n133\n00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.900\nnot individual resources like humans, but\nmaybe equipment, possibly humans as well.\n\n134\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt really can because there's a lot of\n\n135\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.490\nthings that don't come into to\n\n136\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.780\nplay when we start assigning things like\na full eight-hour day on a resource here.\n\n137\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.100\nDedicated resources we have to\nactually think about other things too.\n\n138\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.680\nSo equipment is a great example\nthat you mentioned here.\n\n139\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.990\nSo let's take, for an example,\na generator, okay.\n\n140\n00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.710\nCuz that's one of the things I\"ve\nworked with quite often here.\n\n141\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.520\nSo if you've ever owned a home generator,\nyou kind of realize something.\n\n142\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.700\nYou can run them for a good, long while.\n\n143\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.420\nBut there also needs to be\ndowntime in-between for\n\n144\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.000\nmaintenance and for other things.\n\n145\n00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.310\nBut if anything else, right, for\n\n146\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.720\nthat engine to actually have\ntimes of rest periods as well.\n\n147\n00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.076\nWe talk about that because\nit's actually very important.\n\n148\n00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:56.131\nIf not, you will wear out the equipment\nfaster than it needs to be and\n\n149\n00:07:56.131 --> 00:07:59.508\nthat piece of equipment will end up\nbecoming a burden around you rather than\n\n150\n00:07:59.508 --> 00:08:00.922\nsomething that helps you out.\n\n151\n00:08:00.922 --> 00:08:03.809\nSo, when you start talking\nabout here is what I need,\n\n152\n00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:08.880\nI need this particular piece of equipment\nto be up 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n153\n00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.169\nWell, it can happen, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:14.155\nBut for you to do that,\nyou really need two pieces of equipment.\n\n155\n00:08:14.155 --> 00:08:15.015\nSay, why?\n\n156\n00:08:15.015 --> 00:08:17.460\nWhy would I need two pieces of equipment?\n\n157\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.890\nBecause when,\nespecially in example like the generator,\n\n158\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.820\nall right, If your generator is not\ndesigned to run like that, okay,\n\n159\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.000\nthat means you have to bring it down for\ndown time and for maintenance.\n\n160\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.540\nSo, when you do that, and\nyou need it still up 24/7,\n\n161\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.200\nyou have to have a second one there and\nready and available to go.\n\n162\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah ,and the same goes, rings true for\nany kind of, if you think about a website.\n\n163\n00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.954\nOkay, a web server, and\nif you have an additional web server for\n\n164\n00:08:42.954 --> 00:08:45.519\nthe high availability,\nsame concept applies there.\n\n165\n00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:49.970\nYeah, no doubt that in the IT world,\nit really does apply just as well.\n\n166\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.044\nSee, this is where we come\nfrom different backgrounds.\n\n167\n00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:53.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's always focused on IT,\n\n168\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.860\nwhich is great,\ncuz that's where I love too.\n\n169\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.570\nBut I came from the diesel mechanicing\nbackground, and from service truck and\n\n170\n00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.940\ndisaster recovery work, in which you did,\nwhen you have something like that.\n\n171\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.920\nSo, when we were doing Hurricane Katrina\ntypes of recovery work out there, well, we\n\n172\n00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.680\nhad a diesel generator that we would run,\nand we could run it for ten hours a day.\n\n173\n00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.350\nBut we couldn't run it for 24 hours a day.\n\n174\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.370\nAnd the only way we could\nis if we had two of them.\n\n175\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.320\nAnd that's because we realized something.\n\n176\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.660\nWith that little cheap\nengine that was on them,\n\n177\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.550\nthat we would replace the engine\noil every 10 to 20 hours.\n\n178\n00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.100\nSo, you didn't just go ahead and do that.\n\n179\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.260\nIf you need to bring it down,\nyou had to bring it down for about an hour\n\n180\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.380\nto replace all the oil and to make\nsure everything was still functioning.\n\n181\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.862\nAnd then, you would oil it back up,\nturn it back on, you'd be ready to go.\n\n182\n00:09:36.862 --> 00:09:38.810\n&gt;&gt; All about that continuity.\n\n183\n00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.070\n&gt;&gt; It is about continuity,\n\n184\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.630\nit is about making sure that happens\nif you need some resource like that.\n\n185\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.460\nSo, dedicated resources, as much as\nit seems like, yes I can do that,\n\n186\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.330\nyou really can't to a point.\n\n187\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.270\nSame thing with human resources.\n\n188\n00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.340\nSo, in a typical work week with human\nresources as a dedicated resource\n\n189\n00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.670\nyou might think, eight hours a day,\nfive days a week,\n\n190\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.970\non a traditional standard type of project,\n40 hours of work, right?\n\n191\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.380\nif you assign them to that\nin your project plan for\n\n192\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.630\n40 hours of work you're not gonna\nget 40 hours of work out it.\n\n193\n00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.750\nYou might wonder, why not?\n\n194\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.680\nYou said that the 100% Of their and\ntheir effort can go towards a project.\n\n195\n00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.530\nBut there's other things\nthat also go on in\n\n196\n00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.460\nthe life of that individual\nthat they have to take care of.\n\n197\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.670\nSo let's take for an example instead\nthat as they come in during the week,\n\n198\n00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.213\nyou realize that they spend the first 30\nminutes, maybe, to an hour answering what?\n\n199\n00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:35.070\nInter-project related communications,okay?\n\n200\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.560\nUpdating the project plan, or\nupdating their particular portion\n\n201\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560\n&gt;&gt; Checking their emails\n\n202\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.380\n&gt;&gt; Checking emails\n\n203\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Going through that morning meeting\n\n204\n00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all that kind of stuff, right?\n\n205\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.570\nAnd that adds up over that week and\nnow you said you're suppose to put in 40\n\n206\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.620\nhours, but Ronnie when your turned in\nyour actual work for the project time,\n\n207\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.470\nyou only turned in about 33 hours\nWell that's not bad, because what we\n\n208\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:02.200\nnormally do is we say, look we really\nneed to kind of make allowances for that.\n\n209\n00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.690\nAnd you do,\nyou need to make allowances for\n\n210\n00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.960\nthe fact that other things in life\nhave to go on that may revolve\n\n211\n00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.530\naround your project but may not\nactually do with your project work.\n\n212\n00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:15.650\nSo dedicated resources are great\nbecause they are 100% yours to use.\n\n213\n00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.100\nBut you can't use them 100% of the time,\nwhich is weird, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.460\nThen of course there are what\nwe call shared resources.\n\n215\n00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.630\nJust like what Cherokee was saying,\n\n216\n00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.890\nthat means they may actually be\nsplit between, well, two projects.\n\n217\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.000\nOr maybe even three projects.\n\n218\n00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.070\nAnd this is now what we\nactually have to deal with now.\n\n219\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.320\nWhen you start thinking about this and\nwhat the ramifications are, then.\n\n220\n00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:43.060\nFor a shared resource in the sense, think\nabout the idea of a human resource, right?\n\n221\n00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:49.610\nIf this is a shared type of human resource\nthe time is no longer just yours.\n\n222\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.570\nSo now, if Cherky and\nI are both project managers.\n\n223\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.070\nAnd we need somebody whoever it is and\n\n224\n00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.250\nwe actually have a project team member\nthat's working on both of our projects.\n\n225\n00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.085\nThis is where Cherokee and\nI have to negotiate\n\n226\n00:12:04.085 --> 00:12:04.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] the time.\n\n227\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.260\nOkay?\n\n228\n00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.980\nCuz no matter what we say,\n\n229\n00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.340\neven though Doc Brown is not here He\ncan't bring us back from the future,\n\n230\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:15.430\nhe definitely can't split two people\nto be in two places at one time.\n\n231\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.039\n&gt;&gt; I could imagine that\nour intra-project or\n\n232\n00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:24.070\nintra-company scheduling is gonna\nbe really key here, Ronnie.\n\n233\n00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.040\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that this is\nactually a key idea, if we can.\n\n234\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040\nBut, if not.\n\n235\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.550\nSo let's say that somebody messes this up.\n\n236\n00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.480\nThat's why the negotiation's\nactually very important.\n\n237\n00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.370\nThe problem is, if we try to negotiate and\nwe both say, \"I have to have them on\n\n238\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.860\nthat same time.\" Well, then it comes down\nto an arm wrestling match, or something.\n\n239\n00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.170\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; You know?\n\n240\n00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.140\n[LAUGH] Thanks.\n\n241\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.050\nSo, you're saying you can beat me.\n\n242\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:50.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n243\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.850\nDon't worry about that.\n\n244\n00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.440\nBut, overall, though,\n\n245\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.960\nthat's what we're also thinking about,\n\n246\n00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.620\nas well.\nOkay?\n\n247\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.580\nNow even though we're just\ntalking about human resources,\n\n248\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.690\nthe same thing has to be with equipment.\n\n249\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.910\nSo, let's say it's the same thing here.\n\n250\n00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.600\nNow here it is.\n\n251\n00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.070\nThere is a piece of equipment\nthat we both need to use.\n\n252\n00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.970\nWell, this too has to be negotiated and\n\n253\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.730\nthen also the same thing with\nmaterial resources as well.\n\n254\n00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.970\nAnd the material resources are the worst.\n\n255\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.711\nThe reason why is I'm gonna\nmake Cherokee the bad guy here.\n\n256\n00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:19.380\nCherokee goes, I know something.\n\n257\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.730\nRonnie is gonna need this many\nof this thing right now, but\n\n258\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.440\nI don't know how many I need.\n\n259\n00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.280\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n260\n00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.260\nI'm gonna use as many as I want to, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.580\nEven though we're supposed to\nshare this resource, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.460\nSo if she does that, if Cherokee\ndoes that whatever it is, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.100\nLet's say it's I don't know why but\nthat's a good one.\n\n264\n00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.470\nBut if she says this how many,\nI'm just gonna use as many as I need And\n\n265\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.910\nnow I only have 30% of what I need.\n\n266\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.500\nWell now, I can't go back to Cherokee and\n\n267\n00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.780\nsay Cherokee, you need to take those\noff your project and bring them to me.\n\n268\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.140\nCherokee's gonna go not only\nare they actually in my project,\n\n269\n00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.430\nI already used them up.\n\n270\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.120\nIt's done.\n\n271\n00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.570\nYou don't even have\naccess to them anymore.\n\n272\n00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.460\nSo, that's why material resources\nare the hardest to manage when they\n\n273\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.700\nhave to be shared, or\nnegotiated in this point.\n\n274\n00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.010\nOnce you have shared resources,\n\n275\n00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:08.260\nthere is no assumption you can make as a\nproject manager as to their availability.\n\n276\n00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.580\nSo it's very key, then, that we actually\nunderstand that there's a lot more at play\n\n277\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.690\nthan just saying here's a resource\nI need for my project, okay?\n\n278\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.630\nI'm gonna assign them to this amount\ntime without considerations depending on\n\n279\n00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.490\nhow big your organization is And\nwhat type of resource you have.\n\n280\n00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.590\n&gt;&gt; And usually in those larger\norganizations you would have someone\n\n281\n00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.630\ndedicated, too, like a stock room clerk,\nor something to help\n\n282\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.230\nkeep a good track on it all, like a tally,\na running tally of all these items.\n\n283\n00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.370\n&gt;&gt; This is where your project management\noffice should come into play and\n\n284\n00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.580\nshould help you out.\n\n285\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.690\nBut it doesn't mean that this\nalways happens, because remember,\n\n286\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.340\nnot every organization has\na project management office.\n\n287\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.220\nThe larger the organization\nthe more likely it is but\n\n288\n00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.670\nat the time same time a resources\navailability among shared resources\n\n289\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.080\nis very difficult to negotiate at times.\n\n290\n00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.760\nDon't get me wrong,\npeople can be very nice.\n\n291\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.560\nIf they have wiggle room\nin their project schedule.\n\n292\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.190\nIf there is no wiggle room\nin their project schedule\n\n293\n00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.420\nPeople are cut throat [LAUGH]\nis what it comes down to be.\n\n294\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.280\n&gt;&gt; Ultimately,\nthey're the ones held responsible.\n\n295\n00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.150\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n296\n00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.290\nso I'm not going to say it doesn't happen,\nbut\n\n297\n00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.030\nyou just have to negotiate\nthose things out.\n\n298\n00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.260\nSo that's where it may\nbe where you go okay,\n\n299\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.100\nI can push my project schedule\nback a day or two days here.\n\n300\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.180\nBut then you have actually go,\nalright, Cherokee,\n\n301\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.970\ncan you move your schedule\nup Two days here so\n\n302\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.190\nthat it can accommodate and\nthat we can both get our projects done.\n\n303\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.050\nNow Cherokee says, absolutely,\nthen you may have negotiated this deal.\n\n304\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.595\nCherokee says no,\nyou'll get them when I'm done, that's it.\n\n305\n00:15:32.595 --> 00:15:33.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well now,\n\n306\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.420\nagain like I said,\nit comes down to that arm wrestling match\n\n307\n00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.895\nin which I'm gonna say that Cherokee will\nnot win that one with me, but she might.\n\n308\n00:15:39.895 --> 00:15:40.414\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n309\n00:15:40.414 --> 00:15:44.593\nthat's one of those things where you're\njust negotiating something like that\n\n310\n00:15:44.593 --> 00:15:45.163\nout here.\n\n311\n00:15:45.163 --> 00:15:49.793\nSo from that point, that means we\nhave to actually enter in kinda\n\n312\n00:15:49.793 --> 00:15:54.168\na weirder realm of things that\nwe call resource allocation,\n\n313\n00:15:54.168 --> 00:15:59.256\nis where we actually have to tend\nahead into that element then, okay?\n\n314\n00:15:59.256 --> 00:16:03.020\nSo knowing about those fundamental.\n\n315\n00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.392\nIdeas that we have, what,\nshared equipment, sorry, material,\n\n316\n00:16:07.392 --> 00:16:09.710\nand human resources, okay?\n\n317\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:15.806\nAnd that all of those can either be\nshared or they can actually be dedicated.\n\n318\n00:16:15.806 --> 00:16:18.580\nThat helps out, but there's a lot\nmore that needs to be done, and\n\n319\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.058\nthat's where we're actually heading next,\nall right?\n\n320\n00:16:21.058 --> 00:16:25.080\nSo, in the realm of\nresource management then.\n\n321\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.970\nLet me get my computer back up,\nI've talked so\n\n322\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.620\nlong that my computer logged out and\nI can't remember my password.\n\n323\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.544\nWho would figure-\n&gt;&gt; That happens.\n\n324\n00:16:31.544 --> 00:16:32.306\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does.\n\n325\n00:16:32.306 --> 00:16:33.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Especially when you\n\n326\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.420\ncan't remember anything.\n\n327\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.330\n&gt;&gt; We only have 5,000 to remember.\n\n328\n00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.710\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah, tell me about it.\n\n329\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.120\nSo, resource allocation then, okay?\n\n330\n00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.280\nWhen we start talking\nabout resource allocation,\n\n331\n00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.800\nhere's where it gets tricky Cherokee.\n\n332\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.574\nIs that not only do we need\nsomebody on our project schedule,\n\n333\n00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:53.091\nwe might actually find out that we\nneed more than one of somebody, okay?\n\n334\n00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:56.769\nNot only will we find that out, we might\nactually find out that we need them on\n\n335\n00:16:56.769 --> 00:16:58.616\nthis day, but not on this one, okay?\n\n336\n00:16:58.616 --> 00:17:03.612\n[LAUGH] We might, then, also find out\nthat we need them to actually be working\n\n337\n00:17:03.612 --> 00:17:08.090\nthis particular many hours, and\nthey can only do this many, okay?\n\n338\n00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.990\nSo, this is where that idea of\nresource allocation comes in\n\n339\n00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.430\nthat we have to actually\nbe very careful of.\n\n340\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:18.520\nIf not, we will end up over-allocating\nthe resource and assigning and\n\n341\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.860\nscheduling a resource due\nto their availability.\n\n342\n00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.870\nCan end up kind of being more a nightmare.\n\n343\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:27.700\n&gt;&gt; You mean you scheduled me to work\non the project during my vacation?\n\n344\n00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.804\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:17:28.804 --> 00:17:31.200\n&gt;&gt; That can happen very easily.\n\n346\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.700\nAnd the reason why is that even\nyou though you swear that you keep\n\n347\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.820\ntrack of the vacations,\nyou might find yourself in that pinch.\n\n348\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.190\nNow, when that happens, that is something\nthat we do call over-allocation.\n\n349\n00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.150\nAnd it doesn't tend to show up that way,\nbut in most project management information\n\n350\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.396\nsystems, it shows up\nas an over-allocation.\n\n351\n00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:50.894\nAnd they're just scheduled to work when\nthey're not supposed to be working,\n\n352\n00:17:50.894 --> 00:17:54.470\nduring their particular time off\nis what ends up happening there.\n\n353\n00:17:54.470 --> 00:18:00.195\nSo, we need to be able to figure out,\nfirst, how many resources that we need,\n\n354\n00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:05.130\nokay, for a particular a task\nthat we have for our project.\n\n355\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.750\nAnd we also need to figure out\n\n356\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:12.540\nwhat roles are we going to play\non those particular task as well.\n\n357\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.445\nAnd at the project management level, we'll\ntalk about something else a little bit\n\n358\n00:18:16.445 --> 00:18:20.770\nmore when we talk about the idea of\nquality types of resource assignments too.\n\n359\n00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.870\nso let me show you an example of\nwhat we might have to be able to do.\n\n360\n00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.790\nAnd it's something that we call\nthe responsibility assignment matrix,\n\n361\n00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.410\nis what we actually need\nto take a look at here.\n\n362\n00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.730\nNow you don't have to do this for\n\n363\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.800\nevery single thing on your project\nunless you really don't know.\n\n364\n00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.250\nBut at this point during my planning,\n\n365\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.580\nas I'm still trying to figure\nout How many things I need.\n\n366\n00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.610\nI need to be able to have my work\nbreakdown structure and I need to\n\n367\n00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.980\nknow what resources I might need to work\non my work breakdown structure here.\n\n368\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.710\nSo here, in this example, let's say\nit's a website development project.\n\n369\n00:18:54.710 --> 00:19:00.440\nI have somebody in marketing, designing,\na test server that i need, a programmer.\n\n370\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.930\nA user experience tester as\nwell as a copy writer, too.\n\n371\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:09.660\nSo, if I'm the project manager, let's say\nI have no skills in the background of\n\n372\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.940\nweb development,\nweb development role for a website.\n\n373\n00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.540\nOkay.\n\n374\n00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:19.070\nWell, whatever 8.1.1 is,\nthis is where I might go to my\n\n375\n00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:23.400\nProject team leader, and that particular\none for 8-1-1, I call it point 1 here.\n\n376\n00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.220\nAnd you might say all right,\n\n377\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.460\nhow many marketing people do you need for\nyour particular task.\n\n378\n00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.080\nYou know what I tell me?\n\n379\n00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.430\nI don't need any, great.\n\n380\n00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.700\nWhat about designers?\n\n381\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:41.160\nWell I need At least one designer, two\nwould be better so let's just go ahead and\n\n382\n00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.570\nsay two.\n\n383\n00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.060\nDo I need a test server,\nI might find out I need a test server.\n\n384\n00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.800\nAnd then maybe I don't need actually\ntwo designers I need one designer, but\n\n385\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.670\nI need two programmers to\nhelp me work that out.\n\n386\n00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.630\nAnd then the user experience tester.\n\n387\n00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.810\nIt would be ideal to have\nits own dedicated resource.\n\n388\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.350\nBut if not, I may just reuse\none of the programmers here.\n\n389\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.050\nBut let me just go ahead and\nsay, ideally, it would be one.\n\n390\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.860\nAnd then a copy writer.\n\n391\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.220\nLet's say that here,\nthat the front end designer and\n\n392\n00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.330\nthe copy writer can be the same.\n\n393\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.330\nLet's say, here, okay?\n\n394\n00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.220\nSo now, you go back through, and\nthis is what you start to do,\n\n395\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.500\nas you start to realize how many of these\nresources you need for a particular task.\n\n396\n00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.290\nAnd you can go in then to the second one,\nand to the same thing here.\n\n397\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.740\nWhere you might realize you're\nnot dealing with marketing yet.\n\n398\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.380\nAnd at the designer level,\nhe's still working,\n\n399\n00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.210\ntests are where you definitely continue\nto need And then you have this one and\n\n400\n00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.460\nthen this one and\nthen this one still, okay.\n\n401\n00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.310\nAfter awhile what should happen is\nas a project continues to progress,\n\n402\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.030\nyou might find out that marketing\nbecomes more important,\n\n403\n00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.620\nthe design work is done,\nthe test server is still\n\n404\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.590\nworking because we need them Programmers\nstill working cuz we need them.\n\n405\n00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.970\nBut now let's say that\nthe user experienced of tester\n\n406\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.480\ndon't really need it anymore.\n\n407\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.110\nCopywriter let's say that we do\nreally don't need him anymore.\n\n408\n00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.240\nAnd now you can start adding this up and\n\n409\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.130\nfigure out how many resource do you\nneed to have available to your project.\n\n410\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:16.920\nSo this at least give you an over all\nround of numbers That you can say and\n\n411\n00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.550\nthen say, all right,\nI need at least one marketer.\n\n412\n00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.500\nI need a designer.\n\n413\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.310\nI need one test server, a programmer,\nhow many that you need.\n\n414\n00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:28.640\nAnd you can go to your project management\noffice and see if they can help you to get\n\n415\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.530\nthose resources available to you or\nyou can go and try them on your own.\n\n416\n00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:40.240\nBut now you have a general concept of how\nmany that you at least need for every work\n\n417\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.530\nbreak down package that you have, okay,\nthe workable unit that you have available.\n\n418\n00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.800\nAnd then you can start assigning\nresources from that point.\n\n419\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.050\nNow, just because I have\nthe available numbers, okay,\n\n420\n00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.820\nnow in my head as far as planning\ngoes What role do they really play,\n\n421\n00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.970\nbesides the one that we've given them?\n\n422\n00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.900\nWell, it comes down to a couple of\nother things that you might also\n\n423\n00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.540\nhave to be able to do.\n\n424\n00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.200\nWhich is what you also know as what's\ncalled the RASI chart, or RASI.\n\n425\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.120\nHowever you want to pronounce it.\n\n426\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.410\nAnd this of course, is an acronym for\nresponsible, accountable, conform.\n\n427\n00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:16.370\nOr consult, excuse me.\n\n428\n00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.090\nAnd inform.\n\n429\n00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.450\nI was trying to make them wrong.\n\n430\n00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.000\nI don't know why, but I was.\n\n431\n00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.160\nSo Consult and Inform.\n\n432\n00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.670\nSo now, here it is.\n\n433\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.570\nHere are the different roles that I\nactually had from the other chart over\n\n434\n00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:33.030\nhere on the left hand side, and now I'm\nactually assigned the resource to them.\n\n435\n00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.680\nAnd these are people that work with us,\nso there we go, okay.\n\n436\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.140\nSo at this point here-\n&gt;&gt; I know those people.\n\n437\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou do know those people don't you?\n\n438\n00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:40.680\nOkay.\n\n439\n00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.510\nSo now what can you do?\n\n440\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.780\nYou wanna make sure that\neverybody understands it okay.\n\n441\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.170\nSo the marketing person\n\n442\n00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.600\nwhat role do they have in conjunction\nwith let's say error okay.\n\n443\n00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.610\nWell in this particular row\nin marketing maybe that she\n\n444\n00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:03.870\nis actually the one that Is\naccountable for that, okay?\n\n445\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:09.930\nRob is actually going to be the consultant\nhere and let's say that, let's\n\n446\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:17.070\nsay responsible, so they're actually going\nto do the work on that marketing here.\n\n447\n00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.720\nAnd then let's say Dustin here,\nand he's actually going to be,\n\n448\n00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:24.850\nlet's say accountable cause we're\nconsulting Here, Thomas is accountable,\n\n449\n00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.090\nand then Angie is in the inform role,\nokay?\n\n450\n00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.760\nSo and it comes down to\n\n451\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.298\nErin's particular role here as\nthe Marketing and Web Design here.\n\n452\n00:23:35.298 --> 00:23:38.000\nErin knows that she's responsible for\ntaking care of that.\n\n453\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.340\nBut if she needs help,\nshe knows who to consult, okay.\n\n454\n00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.920\nAnd then Who is she answering to?\n\n455\n00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.200\nLet's say it's Thomas because I didn't\nknow who else to put here at this point.\n\n456\n00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.480\nSo you might actually\nfind out it is Thomas and\n\n457\n00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.230\nthen who's supposed to be consulting and\nthat.\n\n458\n00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.612\nSo let's go ahead and do this.\n\n459\n00:23:52.612 --> 00:23:57.145\nLet's change it backward because Angie is\nnormally who we go to to actually do any\n\n460\n00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:59.287\nof that stuff so we'll do it this way.\n\n461\n00:23:59.287 --> 00:24:00.134\nOkay?\n\n462\n00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:03.566\nThen you'd go down and\nyou'd actually fill that out for\n\n463\n00:24:03.566 --> 00:24:07.155\nall your resources This way,\nwhen somebody asks, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:10.720\nWell, who is actually responsible for\nsetting up the server?\n\n465\n00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.654\nAnd here it is, you've got,\nlet's say 40 different WBS structures for\n\n466\n00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:17.392\nyour work packages here.\n\n467\n00:24:17.392 --> 00:24:19.424\nWell, can you remember that?\n\n468\n00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:22.747\nI wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to\nremember exactly who was responsible for\n\n469\n00:24:22.747 --> 00:24:23.522\nsetting this up.\n\n470\n00:24:23.522 --> 00:24:27.492\nBut being able to have something like\nthis where I have quickly done this and\n\n471\n00:24:27.492 --> 00:24:30.906\nwalk through, I can simply come here and\nlook for that letter R.\n\n472\n00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:32.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou don't even have to contact anyone.\n\n473\n00:24:32.485 --> 00:24:34.001\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; By removing that question,\n\n474\n00:24:34.001 --> 00:24:35.909\nyou just go ahead and\npull this up and there you go.\n\n475\n00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:40.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so, that's kinda the great\nthing about using some of these tools\n\n476\n00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:42.504\nthat are really setup for us.\n\n477\n00:24:42.504 --> 00:24:46.844\nTo be able to understand the way\nthat resources also need to\n\n478\n00:24:46.844 --> 00:24:50.929\nbe allocated to help us out\nto ensure what we need to do.\n\n479\n00:24:50.929 --> 00:24:57.454\nSo, you do have quite a bit of information\nhere that you can take a look at.\n\n480\n00:24:57.454 --> 00:25:02.431\nWhen you start out at least use something\nlike that, responsibility, assignment,\n\n481\n00:25:02.431 --> 00:25:05.124\nmatrix to give you\nthe numbers that you need and\n\n482\n00:25:05.124 --> 00:25:08.372\nthen of course every single design role,\nor person, or\n\n483\n00:25:08.372 --> 00:25:12.238\nresource that you need as far\nthe role goes, you can actually say,\n\n484\n00:25:12.238 --> 00:25:16.981\nhere's exactly how they're gonna end up\nworking on the project and working it.\n\n485\n00:25:16.981 --> 00:25:20.033\nYou may find out that there may\nbe some of these other ones,\n\n486\n00:25:20.033 --> 00:25:23.599\nlike the set up the server,\nthere may actually be only this, okay?\n\n487\n00:25:23.599 --> 00:25:27.906\nSo ideally, it would actually\nbe multiple people here, okay?\n\n488\n00:25:27.906 --> 00:25:30.560\nSo it might be where you\nmight have consulting and\n\n489\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.679\nthen informing that it's done,\nmight be Thomas again.\n\n490\n00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:36.941\nHe might be the one coordinating on\nthe other side of getting everything done.\n\n491\n00:25:36.941 --> 00:25:38.821\nYou may not have multiple,\n\n492\n00:25:38.821 --> 00:25:43.083\nwhere everybody's actually\nfilling in on that task as well.\n\n493\n00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:47.720\nSo, there's a lot of this that you can\nactually end up doing where it can\n\n494\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.050\nactually work and this way it's\na very quick and easy reference for\n\n495\n00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:55.086\nallocation of resources\nthat are available.\n\n496\n00:25:55.086 --> 00:25:56.687\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n497\n00:25:56.687 --> 00:25:59.607\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhat does that lead us to then?\n\n498\n00:25:59.607 --> 00:26:06.051\nWell, as much we love to say,\nthat every resource whether shared or\n\n499\n00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:11.378\ndedicate is going to be\navailable 100% of the time.\n\n500\n00:26:11.378 --> 00:26:15.962\nThe other thing that we also have to deal\nwith in terms of resources is the idea of\n\n501\n00:26:15.962 --> 00:26:18.333\nwhat we call resource shortage, okay?\n\n502\n00:26:18.333 --> 00:26:22.232\nWhen it comes down to the realm\nof resource shortages,\n\n503\n00:26:22.232 --> 00:26:26.317\nit happens more often, by far,\nwith shared resources.\n\n504\n00:26:26.317 --> 00:26:30.151\nAnd that's because, well, if they're only\nworking on one other project they're\n\n505\n00:26:30.151 --> 00:26:32.747\nprobably actually busy with\nthat other project, okay?\n\n506\n00:26:32.747 --> 00:26:37.346\nWorking on more than one project, they're\nprobably divided in their focus anyways so\n\n507\n00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:39.181\nyou actually do have less of that.\n\n508\n00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:44.430\nIt does happen very rarely though when\nthere are item types of resources and\n\n509\n00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:48.347\nyou might be wondering why\nare item types of resources or\n\n510\n00:26:48.347 --> 00:26:52.785\nmaterial types of resources,\nagain, a little bit more rare.\n\n511\n00:26:52.785 --> 00:26:57.497\nThat's because you don't tend to have\na shortage of them because you either\n\n512\n00:26:57.497 --> 00:26:59.495\nhave them or you don't, okay?\n\n513\n00:26:59.495 --> 00:27:03.071\nAnd so, usually they're consumed up and\nthat's why you also have that.\n\n514\n00:27:03.071 --> 00:27:07.754\nAlso, you tend to have resource\nshortages when resources are in\n\n515\n00:27:07.754 --> 00:27:09.667\nhigh demand everywhere.\n\n516\n00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:12.274\nSo when you start go,\nI know exactly what I need and\n\n517\n00:27:12.274 --> 00:27:15.789\nthen you realize it's the most\npopular thing on the market right now.\n\n518\n00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:17.379\n&gt;&gt; I want that same individual.\n\n519\n00:27:17.379 --> 00:27:21.818\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you want that same individual or\nyou want that same particular item that\n\n520\n00:27:21.818 --> 00:27:24.496\neverybody is looking,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n521\n00:27:24.496 --> 00:27:25.889\n&gt;&gt; So,\nwhat would happen in that situation?\n\n522\n00:27:25.889 --> 00:27:29.476\nHow would someone go ahead, and\nI guess would you triage almost?\n\n523\n00:27:29.476 --> 00:27:32.048\n&gt;&gt; You would have to, or\nyou would have to bribe somebody,\n\n524\n00:27:32.048 --> 00:27:33.379\nis what you would have to do.\n\n525\n00:27:33.379 --> 00:27:34.574\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n526\n00:27:34.574 --> 00:27:37.349\nyou think I'm joking,\nno I am joking, I'm joking here.\n\n527\n00:27:37.349 --> 00:27:39.432\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But overall though,\n\n528\n00:27:39.432 --> 00:27:42.987\nyou'd have to negotiate some way\nif there's a particular shortage,\n\n529\n00:27:42.987 --> 00:27:47.156\nespecially with an individual, where you\nmight have to work out something else.\n\n530\n00:27:47.156 --> 00:27:50.390\nAnd it's one of those unusual\nthings where resource shortages,\n\n531\n00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:51.874\nyou just have to deal with it.\n\n532\n00:27:51.874 --> 00:27:55.964\nAnd most of us, the way we deal\nwith it and we tend to go ahead and\n\n533\n00:27:55.964 --> 00:28:00.297\nwe make accommodations for\nresources in short demand right now so\n\n534\n00:28:00.297 --> 00:28:03.079\nthat we can get them\na little bit later on.\n\n535\n00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:06.620\nBut then you do, you have to ask your\nplan out and your schedule that way.\n\n536\n00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.852\nYou might find out you don't have anything\nto do except for accept what's actually\n\n537\n00:28:10.852 --> 00:28:15.039\nhappening there too and also, when you try\nto get the resource at the last minute.\n\n538\n00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:19.319\nNever a good thing on a project when you\ngo, it's okay, Cherokee will be available,\n\n539\n00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:21.529\nI know, she's not available, crud.\n\n540\n00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:25.650\n[LAUGH] So when you wait until that\nlast minute, it's also something.\n\n541\n00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.347\nSo, what does it come down to?\n\n542\n00:28:28.347 --> 00:28:30.286\nWell, shortages, right?\n\n543\n00:28:30.286 --> 00:28:33.107\nWe can cause them by waiting\nuntil the last minute.\n\n544\n00:28:33.107 --> 00:28:36.565\nWe can cause them again by\nnot actually being out and\n\n545\n00:28:36.565 --> 00:28:40.749\nnegotiate out what we really need to,\nso that can happen, but\n\n546\n00:28:40.749 --> 00:28:45.014\nmarket place forces do, tend to,\nhave a play in there as well,\n\n547\n00:28:45.014 --> 00:28:49.279\nwhen they're shared and\nthey can have their time negotiated or\n\n548\n00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:54.831\nwhatever actually is negotiated, you might\nfind out a competitor of yours goes so\n\n549\n00:28:54.831 --> 00:29:00.318\nRonnie can't finish his project, I'm\ngonna buy up all the green paint as well.\n\n550\n00:29:00.318 --> 00:29:04.268\nI should say sticky foam paint is what\nI should say cuz I know Peter one\n\n551\n00:29:04.268 --> 00:29:09.118\nof our guides here, he bought every single\nbottle of spray adhesive I think in two or\n\n552\n00:29:09.118 --> 00:29:11.496\nthree counties is what I remember here.\n\n553\n00:29:11.496 --> 00:29:12.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n554\n00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.527\nnobody else who was doing any arts and\ncrafts that week.\n\n555\n00:29:14.527 --> 00:29:18.219\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, even with this last\nhurricane you saw that with gasoline,\n\n556\n00:29:18.219 --> 00:29:19.484\nyou saw that with water.\n\n557\n00:29:19.484 --> 00:29:23.562\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so the same thing then with\nprojects as they happen that this can be\n\n558\n00:29:23.562 --> 00:29:27.655\nfairly one of those unusual occurrences\nwhere you have to just deal with it.\n\n559\n00:29:27.655 --> 00:29:32.199\nAnd this is where you end up delaying\nyour project four at a time until that\n\n560\n00:29:32.199 --> 00:29:33.996\nresource may be available.\n\n561\n00:29:33.996 --> 00:29:36.898\nIf not, you may have to\nfind a replacement instead.\n\n562\n00:29:36.898 --> 00:29:37.653\n&gt;&gt; An alternative.\n\n563\n00:29:37.653 --> 00:29:40.301\n&gt;&gt; An alternative to help you out here.\n\n564\n00:29:40.301 --> 00:29:44.305\nAll right,\nnow one last thing we wanna talk about.\n\n565\n00:29:44.305 --> 00:29:48.193\nWe're gonna end up breaking this,\nI think, into kind of a part two here,\n\n566\n00:29:48.193 --> 00:29:49.530\nas I start to take a look.\n\n567\n00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:54.024\nIs just the basic idea of when we\ntalked about resource allocation.\n\n568\n00:29:54.024 --> 00:29:58.446\nWe already mentioned it but\nlets kind of mention it again briefly.\n\n569\n00:29:58.446 --> 00:30:03.999\nWhenever a resource is assigned to a time\nthat they are not supposed to be working,\n\n570\n00:30:03.999 --> 00:30:06.666\nthey are considered over allocation.\n\n571\n00:30:06.666 --> 00:30:11.883\nNow, over allocation can happen as far\nas schedule goes on a daily basis or\n\n572\n00:30:11.883 --> 00:30:14.166\nit can happen on a weekly basis.\n\n573\n00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:17.452\nYou can have those they actually\nover allocated on hourly basis.\n\n574\n00:30:17.452 --> 00:30:20.173\nBut normally most projects\non tender works that way,\n\n575\n00:30:20.173 --> 00:30:22.537\nI'm not saying that none of them do or\ncan't.\n\n576\n00:30:22.537 --> 00:30:25.886\nBut all of them can but\nusually we tend to actually try and\n\n577\n00:30:25.886 --> 00:30:29.317\nsee it on weekly basis If not\non a daily basis here, okay?\n\n578\n00:30:29.317 --> 00:30:34.587\nIf you generally have just a standard\nproject and you consider a single human\n\n579\n00:30:34.587 --> 00:30:39.708\nresource working on your project as\nbeing a standard eight hour workday.\n\n580\n00:30:39.708 --> 00:30:44.295\nIf you assign them to ten\nhours of work that day, okay?\n\n581\n00:30:44.295 --> 00:30:46.213\nThen what is gonna happen is,\n\n582\n00:30:46.213 --> 00:30:50.065\nthat resource is going to be\nconsidered over-allocated.\n\n583\n00:30:50.065 --> 00:30:56.078\nIf you have a 40 hour work week and\nyou assign them to 41 hours of work.\n\n584\n00:30:56.078 --> 00:30:58.459\nThat resource is\nconsidered over-allocated.\n\n585\n00:30:58.459 --> 00:31:00.607\nYou might be wondering,\nwhy is this important?\n\n586\n00:31:00.607 --> 00:31:04.299\nIt's important in terms of the cost\nof what your project ends up running.\n\n587\n00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:05.042\n&gt;&gt; Overtime.\n\n588\n00:31:05.042 --> 00:31:05.878\n&gt;&gt; Overtime, yeah.\n\n589\n00:31:05.878 --> 00:31:06.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n590\n00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.014\nthat's why we actually do\nhave to pay attention here.\n\n591\n00:31:08.014 --> 00:31:13.379\nAs overtime is actually a big one,\nwhen you don't pay attention.\n\n592\n00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:17.763\nAssigning resources on an overtime\nbasis is actually allowed,\n\n593\n00:31:17.763 --> 00:31:21.995\nthe reason why is that you may\nactually be under a time crunch.\n\n594\n00:31:21.995 --> 00:31:25.672\nIn which you go to that resource and say,\nI do really need you to work overtime\n\n595\n00:31:25.672 --> 00:31:29.654\non this and you're authorized to have all\nthe overtime you need to complete this.\n\n596\n00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:32.561\nAnd so if they're willing to do that,\nand you're willing to do it,\n\n597\n00:31:32.561 --> 00:31:35.576\nyou're willing to pay for it,\nthen it's actually up and available.\n\n598\n00:31:35.576 --> 00:31:39.620\nIt's not always bad, but it's bad if\neverybody is actually over allocated.\n\n599\n00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you see this a lot in the energy\nindustry especially if they have\n\n600\n00:31:43.045 --> 00:31:44.728\nparticular units that are down and\n\n601\n00:31:44.728 --> 00:31:47.884\nthey're not able to go ahead\nan produce the company's energy.\n\n602\n00:31:47.884 --> 00:31:50.160\nThey're like, look we need to\nget this unit back up, online.\n\n603\n00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.159\nLet's go ahead and put forth all of\nthe resources we have available just so\n\n604\n00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:56.299\nthat we can continue to be productive.\n\n605\n00:31:56.299 --> 00:31:57.589\n&gt;&gt; And all right, so let's go ahead and\n\n606\n00:31:57.589 --> 00:31:59.977\njust take a look at a couple of\nother things since we're still here.\n\n607\n00:31:59.977 --> 00:32:01.447\nAnd I think we're just gonna go,\n\n608\n00:32:01.447 --> 00:32:05.176\neven though I said we'll probably break\nthis up then then part two, We're probably\n\n609\n00:32:05.176 --> 00:32:08.559\njust gonna take a look at the last few\nitems and try and just put it all in here.\n\n610\n00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:11.737\nBecause if not,\nit's gonna be a really short [CROSSTALK]\n\n611\n00:32:11.737 --> 00:32:13.063\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, you're the boss.\n\n612\n00:32:13.063 --> 00:32:14.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's take a look.\n\n613\n00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:19.050\nThe other thing that we also need to\nconsider in terms of resource assignment\n\n614\n00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.520\nis not only, of course,\n\n615\n00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:25.700\nwho's actually going to be responsible to\nwhom and how many resources do I need.\n\n616\n00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:30.760\nBut also in the resource assignment\nitself there has to be priorities and\n\n617\n00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.430\nof course an understanding of what\nwe call resource qualities, okay.\n\n618\n00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:38.250\nSo every organization that runs\nmultiple projects tends to have\n\n619\n00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:42.810\na matrix like this that they call\na resource assignment matrix.\n\n620\n00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.880\nNow, normally this is done at the\nmanagerial level more than anything else.\n\n621\n00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.860\nAnd not really done at\nthe individual resource level.\n\n622\n00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.600\nBut so here's how it works out.\n\n623\n00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.420\nNow, not everybody does it this way,\nhere's how I kinda envisioned it.\n\n624\n00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.880\nSo we have, of course,\nthe idea here of priorities.\n\n625\n00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.200\nWether it's considered a high priority for\nmy company, you know,\n\n626\n00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.490\ndown to a low priority, okay?\n\n627\n00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.820\nSo I just did high, medium, and low.\n\n628\n00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.340\nAnd the same thing with what we\ncall resource quality, here.\n\n629\n00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.340\nNow, before you kind of\njump down my throat about,\n\n630\n00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:16.310\nwell, what's considered qualified or\na quality resource or not?\n\n631\n00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.643\nUsually what we're talking about\nhere is dedicated versus shared.\n\n632\n00:33:20.643 --> 00:33:23.580\nFull-time versus part-time.\n\n633\n00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.420\nSo that's what we mean by the idea\nof quality resource here.\n\n634\n00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.380\nIt's not that, you know,\nThis person is so much better than Ronny.\n\n635\n00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.770\nThat's not what we're talking about.\n\n636\n00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.860\n&gt;&gt; Maybe like full time\nemployee versus a contractor?\n\n637\n00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be even something like\nthat if you choose to distinguish it that\n\n638\n00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.150\nway, okay.\n\n639\n00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.610\nSo if your company does\nwork on multiple projects\n\n640\n00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.290\nthere has to be an assignment of both,\nokay.\n\n641\n00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.050\nWhat is the quality of resource that\nyou need working on that project.\n\n642\n00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:54.030\nAnd what is its priority as well?\n\n643\n00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:59.200\nOkay, well those are considered projects\nthat we need to protect because they can\n\n644\n00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:05.650\ninfluence the collateral\ngood will of your company.\n\n645\n00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.350\nSo in that sense here you tend to assign\n\n646\n00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:13.580\nwho is willing to protect\nyour company image.\n\n647\n00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.980\nAnd who is willing to protect your\ncompanies assets to that resource.\n\n648\n00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.610\nAnd so, that's when you actually have a\nhigh high here when you actually go high.\n\n649\n00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.680\nWho is actually gonna\nbe protective of that.\n\n650\n00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.630\nAnd that's normally gonna be a full\ntime dedicated project manager,\n\n651\n00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.090\nfull time dedicated functional\nmanager of my company.\n\n652\n00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:33.380\nIf I have that.\n\n653\n00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.690\nSame thing here when it's high and medium.\n\n654\n00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.780\nYou also assigned the same type here.\n\n655\n00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.910\nAnd when you have a medium\nfirst priorities go.\n\n656\n00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:45.540\nThese are the ones that really go towards\nadvancing the image of your company.\n\n657\n00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.190\nOkay.\nThat's what it happens.\n\n658\n00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:53.220\nNow, noticed that over here\nthough if my priority is high but\n\n659\n00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:57.090\nI really do not have any\nresources that are really left.\n\n660\n00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:01.160\nI can actually go ahead and do this or\nassign a full time project manager and\n\n661\n00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.010\na functional manager to help me out here.\n\n662\n00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.210\nOkay, but\n\n663\n00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:11.550\nit may not be that they are actually going\nto be just dedicated to that one project.\n\n664\n00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.000\nNow, full time here means full time but\n\n665\n00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.870\nthey can actually be managing\nmultiple projects at the same time.\n\n666\n00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:19.760\nBut they're considered\nfull-time resources, okay?\n\n667\n00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.660\nSame thing here on medium and\nlow, it's gonna be part-time.\n\n668\n00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.400\nLow and low, of course, part-time.\n\n669\n00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.230\nAnd then you start seeing this-\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n670\n00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.470\nwould that go to our over allocation for\nthose two full-times?\n\n671\n00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would.\n\n672\n00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.540\nIt would actually end up doing\nsomething like that as we choose to.\n\n673\n00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.500\nNow only the medium and\n\n674\n00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.290\nmedium This is the one where you\nare on that gray area, right?\n\n675\n00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Is this important,\n\n676\n00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.508\nis it not,\nthis is when you actually choose and pick.\n\n677\n00:35:40.508 --> 00:35:44.370\nYou are a very selective about who\nyou choose, task you able to do this,\n\n678\n00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.638\nbut this is something else you\ndo want to pay attention to.\n\n679\n00:35:46.638 --> 00:35:51.200\nWhen you start taking look at the idea\nof assigning the quality of resources.\n\n680\n00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.350\nHow do you know actually\nwho should be full time?\n\n681\n00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:54.410\nWho should be a contractor?\n\n682\n00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:55.630\nWho should be what?\n\n683\n00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:57.710\nThis is the way that you tend to do that.\n\n684\n00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.170\nAnd as resource becomes more trusted\n\n685\n00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.900\nthen they actually tend to move up\nto these projects over here and\n\n686\n00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.860\nthe rest of these are actually\nleft kind of at the side as well.\n\n687\n00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:10.100\nOkay, so those are some of the things that\nwe also have to deal with in terms of\n\n688\n00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.940\nresource assignments too.\n\n689\n00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.750\nAlso, every company that works with\nlet's say contracted resources\n\n690\n00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:19.210\nalso have access to what we call\nbenched resources, as well.\n\n691\n00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.530\nThese are normally resources that\nare available to the project, but\n\n692\n00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.890\nnot really assigned to your project, yet.\n\n693\n00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.390\nBut they can be if we actually need too.\n\n694\n00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.050\nThey're not normally\npart of a project plan.\n\n695\n00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.270\nBenched resources are not\nsomething we should count on,\n\n696\n00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.020\nin other words they shouldn't\nbe included in our project plan.\n\n697\n00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.450\nThey should be when we need them to be,\nbut\n\n698\n00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.840\nthey're not actually\ngoing to be a part out.\n\n699\n00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.510\nSo if we need somebody else to come in and\n\n700\n00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.760\nhelp, then we actually can rely on what\nwe call benched resources to help us out.\n\n701\n00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.680\nAnd usually that is from a company\nthat's contracting to us as well.\n\n702\n00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.550\nAnd then we also have to\nremember that in allocations.\n\n703\n00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.990\nWe have to figure out this idea of what\nwe call inter-project dependencies, okay?\n\n704\n00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.200\nSo let me kind of give you\na very wonderful example\n\n705\n00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.220\nof this idea of inter-project\ndependencies, okay?\n\n706\n00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.510\nWhen one project ends up\nbuilding upon another project,\n\n707\n00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:12.080\nbuilding upon another project, to deliver\nour over-all project and product.\n\n708\n00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.650\nThis building is a great example.\n\n709\n00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.200\nThe studios that we have\nhere is a great example.\n\n710\n00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.850\nEvery single thing that you're\nactually seeing right here is actually\n\n711\n00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:20.750\na result of multiple projects.\n\n712\n00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.400\nOur backdrop that you see right here.\n\n713\n00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.640\nThe camera-work that\nyou're actually seeing.\n\n714\n00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.960\nThe actual overall nature of the way\nthat we're presenting the information.\n\n715\n00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.900\nThe lighting.\n\n716\n00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.370\nThat's actually in our room.\n\n717\n00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.270\nAll these are actually multiple projects\nthat have come together for one element.\n\n718\n00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:36.640\nAnd they are dependent on each one.\n\n719\n00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.180\nBecause without all those projects\nreally working together, and\n\n720\n00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.790\nin the end result here, dealing with\nthe integrator s that we had and\n\n721\n00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.920\nall of the contractors that we had here.\n\n722\n00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.940\nIt wouldn't have actually come through.\n\n723\n00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.110\nSo it actually does require-\n&gt;&gt; You look great but\n\n724\n00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.673\nI can't hear anything you're saying.\n\n725\n00:37:51.673 --> 00:37:53.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know yeah that would be terrible.\n\n726\n00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.540\nYeah, so when you start to see this here,\n\n727\n00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:59.780\nthe very fact is it does require\nintegration to make it all work.\n\n728\n00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.365\nAnd that's where we do have to\nkind of make sure that everything\n\n729\n00:38:02.365 --> 00:38:03.640\nmatches together.\n\n730\n00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.460\nSo thinking about all of that is\nreally kind of some of the roles\n\n731\n00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.880\nthat you as a project\nmanager must consider.\n\n732\n00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.980\nWhen you start taking a look\nat resource management\n\n733\n00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.080\ntypes of things that have to go\non through your project as well.\n\n734\n00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.490\n&gt;&gt; That really has been\na plethora of information, Ronny.\n\n735\n00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:22.760\nYou are able to go ahead and help\ndefine all of our different resources.\n\n736\n00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.010\nWe were able able to\nlook at human resources.\n\n737\n00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.340\nWe're able to look at our equipment and\nmaterial resources.\n\n738\n00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:33.610\nAs well as actually differentiate between\nshared resources and dedicated resources.\n\n739\n00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.910\nYou also showed us some\nreally great tools.\n\n740\n00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.810\nTo help us prevent any kind\nof resource allocations.\n\n741\n00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:42.890\nWe could ahead and\nallocate those resources efficiently,\n\n742\n00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:46.360\nwe don't have to worry about any kind of\nresource shortage and then you know what?\n\n743\n00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.890\nIf we do have resource\nshortage we also have those\n\n744\n00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.710\nBenched resources that we can go ahead and\nrely on if we need to.\n\n745\n00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.300\nSo that was a lot.\n\n746\n00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.380\nThank you guys for tuning in today.\n\n747\n00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.280\nHopefully I'll see you in\nthe next episode here.\n\n748\n00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.630\nWe have more Project+ coming your way.\n\n749\n00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.570\nSo thank you, Ronnie,\nfor everything today.\n\n750\n00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:04.520\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n751\n00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm

Francisco [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:08.346\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:12.187\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:15.112\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:17.198\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:20.537\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ncontinuing on a part two for\n\n8\n00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:22.830\nexplaining resource management.\n\n9\n00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.750\nWe're gonna be looking at forming,\nstorming, norming, performing, adjourning.\n\n10\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.313\nAnd no, we're not rapping, we're actually\ndiving deeper into that resource\n\n11\n00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:34.307\nmanagement and we're gonna be\nlooking at personnel management.\n\n12\n00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:37.390\nAnd who better to help us with\nthat than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.180\nThank you for\nbeing with us here today, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n15\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.880\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non with our project plus show here.\n\n16\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.080\nWe're now taking a look into that\nexciting realm of personnel management.\n\n17\n00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.000\nThat's right.\n\n18\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.746\nWe've already talked in that episode one,\nright,\n\n19\n00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:55.650\nthat part one of resource management,\nwhere we've talked about equipment, and\n\n20\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.180\nmaterial, and even a little bit of\nhuman resource types of management.\n\n21\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.944\nBut when it comes down to it,\n\n22\n00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:06.282\nwhat's gonna also end up happening\nis as you bring people together for\n\n23\n00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:11.156\nyour project that you have in hand,\nyou're gonna have to realize something.\n\n24\n00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:14.550\nThat not everybody's worked on a project\nbefore, and it could be that way.\n\n25\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.410\nNot everybody's actually ready to\ndo everything that they need to.\n\n26\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.876\nSo you're gonna have to actually deal\nwith more than just the idea of resource\n\n27\n00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:24.640\navailability and\nallocation very many times.\n\n28\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.040\nAnd now what you're talking about is\nmultiple people coming together and\n\n29\n00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.380\nwe have to be able to get all\nthose different personalities,\n\n30\n00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.790\nall the other things that they're used\nto doing to work together as a team.\n\n31\n00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.570\nAnd that is what we're\nreally talking about.\n\n32\n00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.965\nAnd so there's some challenges there,\nthat we really need to get through.\n\n33\n00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:44.480\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, what are those big challenges\nthat you're talking about there?\n\n34\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.826\nWith the team building, it seem there\ncould be potentially room for quite a few.\n\n35\n00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:50.910\nThere's a lot of different challenges,\nand not all of them are,\n\n36\n00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.828\nof course, just personality-based.\n\n37\n00:01:52.828 --> 00:01:54.845\nBut especially [LAUGH] if\nyou're working with me,\n\n38\n00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:57.040\nthey're probably going\nto be personality-based.\n\n39\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.200\nBut overall, though, what you tend to see\nis there's actually location challenges.\n\n40\n00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.690\nIf your project is large and you now\nactually have to manage multiple location\n\n41\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.130\nsites because of how big your project is,\nremember that means coordination efforts\n\n42\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.760\nbetween those projects to actually carry\non in what you also have to be able to do.\n\n43\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.490\nAlso realizing the resource allocation\nwhen you're working with full and\n\n44\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.220\npart time resource as well,\n\n45\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.685\nmay also have to be considered\nwhen you realize that there it is.\n\n46\n00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:27.310\nYou're on the weekend and what you don't\nhave access to is full time resources.\n\n47\n00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.860\nYou have access to only part-time\n\n48\n00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.890\nresources that are actually\nwilling to work.\n\n49\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.460\nAnd then you might even have\nthe difference between technical people\n\n50\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.262\nthat are really very good\nat what they're doing, and\n\n51\n00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:41.190\nthen non-technical people that are more\nadministrative support as well.\n\n52\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.350\nAnd realizing you're not gonna be\n\n53\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.628\nable to assign some of those to technical\nchallenges that you have on hand.\n\n54\n00:02:45.628 --> 00:02:50.460\nTemporary, you know ideas that you have\ninstead of someone that's actually\n\n55\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.810\ngonna come in and do a lot.\n\n56\n00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.360\nThey may come in just for a specific part,\nand you name it, there's all of that.\n\n57\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.780\nSo what we have to be able to do is\nunderstand that there's the challenge of\n\n58\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.480\njust those things.\n\n59\n00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.260\nBut the key for us, especially if we're\ngoing to be doing project management,\n\n60\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.170\nis to form and\nto develop a great project team.\n\n61\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.975\nAnd that entire list of what Cherokee\nmade out as being rapping words for\n\n62\n00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:17.460\nus is actually gonna be some of\nthe key ideas to helping us to develop\n\n63\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.366\nthe team and to understand team\ndevelopment is what we really need to do.\n\n64\n00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:24.040\nAnd so that's what we're gonna go through.\n\n65\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.710\nWe're gonna talk about each one of\nthose different aspects of team\n\n66\n00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.070\ndevelopmental phases to help us to\nunderstand how a team gets formed and\n\n67\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.730\nwhy we need to understand something\nlike this in project management.\n\n68\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.740\nIt's because we tend to pull from\na lot of technical backgrounds.\n\n69\n00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.660\nWe tend to pull from a lot of\ndifferent groups of people and\n\n70\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.880\nindividuals which might be used to\nactually being like the top dog and\n\n71\n00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.510\nhere they might not be the top dog.\n\n72\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.920\nAnd now they have to\nwork with someone else.\n\n73\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.989\nSo that's where we're going.\n\n74\n00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.129\nAnd so we're gonna have to take\na look at all of those different,\n\n75\n00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.110\nmake sure I've counted right,\nfive phases that we actually have to do.\n\n76\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.870\nSo let's start off with the one\nthat Cherokee started off with.\n\n77\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.820\nCherokee, do you remember the very\nfirst one that you mentioned?\n\n78\n00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.930\n&gt;&gt; Of course I do, that was forming\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n79\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.810\nlet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n80\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.970\nThis way this helps us out.\n\n81\n00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.190\nSo we take a look at my computer.\n\n82\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.365\nI kind of just did a summary of\nsome of the things that we really\n\n83\n00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:18.240\nwanna make sure that we understand\nwhen we start to take a look here.\n\n84\n00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.300\nThe idea of forming at this\nparticular point in time,\n\n85\n00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.340\nokay, is that really\nit comes down to this.\n\n86\n00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.920\nWhen you bring a bunch of\ndifferent people together\n\n87\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.200\nthat have not worked together before,\nthey really have to understand\n\n88\n00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.140\nthe very beginning of why in the world\nthey're working together for this project.\n\n89\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.280\nSo they're not really a team yet\nat this particular point, but what they're\n\n90\n00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.080\nactually here to do is to understand,\nhey, this is why we're gathered together.\n\n91\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.320\nAnd here you get this kind of unusual\npsychological sense of the group,\n\n92\n00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.490\nwhere not everybody feels comfortable,\nokay.\n\n93\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.050\nAnd a lot of times the very beginning,\nand the very first few meetings,\n\n94\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.810\npeople are more formal and\nthey're more reserved and\n\n95\n00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.180\nusually very businesslike,\nbecause they're not sure what to expect.\n\n96\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.590\nThey're not sure if this is something\nthat's gonna be relaxing, or\n\n97\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.140\nif it's something that's\ngonna be very formal.\n\n98\n00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.919\nNobody wants to actually get themselves\nportrayed as someone that can't\n\n99\n00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:17.533\ndo the job.\n\n100\n00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:18.386\n&gt;&gt; Slacker.\n\n101\n00:05:18.386 --> 00:05:22.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they don't wanna be\nportrayed as the slacker as well.\n\n102\n00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.552\nAnd so when you have stuff like this,\n\n103\n00:05:24.552 --> 00:05:28.130\nyou've gotta realize that these are the\nattitudes that's gonna come together\n\n104\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.440\nin the idea of building the team, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.070\nIt's that they're going to\njust kind of look around and\n\n106\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.970\nsee who do you think is ready for this,\nwho they don't think is ready for it.\n\n107\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.460\nAnd you hate to say it, there does become\njust in that natural group together,\n\n108\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.810\na pecking order that\nwill end up happening.\n\n109\n00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.830\n&gt;&gt; It's just kind of a human nature,\nit's not something that we, I mean people,\n\n110\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.510\nit's very hard to not form any kind\nof judgments but it happens, right?\n\n111\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.790\n&gt;&gt; It really does happen and there is\nissues that you have to deal with.\n\n112\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.660\nBut you do have to let it happen\nnaturally, and allow them to actually see\n\n113\n00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.770\nbecause that's where you really\nwant your leadership to come from.\n\n114\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.970\nIt's not so much you just pointing out\nsomeone and go, you're going to lead this.\n\n115\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.180\nAnd everybody around the room goes,\n\n116\n00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.530\nthere's no way that guy is\ngonna be able to do that.\n\n117\n00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.870\nNow don't get me wrong, people have\nalways been able to overcome and\n\n118\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.120\nactually do the things that\nthey've been called on to do.\n\n119\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.638\nBut if you allow them that possibility to\nstep up and to shine on their own rather\n\n120\n00:06:23.638 --> 00:06:28.103\nthan you appointing them, they become\na natural type of leader in the group.\n\n121\n00:06:28.103 --> 00:06:32.635\nNow in that sense, when I talk about that\nidea of natural leader in the group,\n\n122\n00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:36.820\nthat is what starts to happen when you\nleave them together long enough so\n\n123\n00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.650\nthat they realize they're\ngonna be working together.\n\n124\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.150\nAnd the phase that we end up taking a look\nat at that particular point in time\n\n125\n00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.660\nis one that we call storming,\nis what we call it at this point.\n\n126\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.280\nNow in the idea of storming here,\n\n127\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.500\nthis is where somebody really is, we call\nit the idea here of alpha positioning.\n\n128\n00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.300\nThey want to find out who in this\ngroup is gonna be the top guy, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.770\nNow I'm gonna press Cherokee's\nmovie knowledge here,\n\n130\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.668\nhave you ever seen the movie Top Gun?\n\n131\n00:07:12.668 --> 00:07:13.783\n&gt;&gt; That was ages ago.\n\n132\n00:07:13.783 --> 00:07:15.425\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you were probably very young.\n\n133\n00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:19.110\nI'm gonna assume you were very,\nvery young when you saw the movie Top Gun.\n\n134\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.220\nAnd so if you actually saw it at all,\nyou may not have even seen it at all,\n\n135\n00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.170\nfor all I know.\n\n136\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.650\nBut in the movie Top Gun, right,\n\n137\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.290\nthese are supposed to be the best of\nthe best, according to the movie.\n\n138\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.000\nAnd so everybody as they're\nactually gathered there,\n\n139\n00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.330\nthey're all looking around.\n\n140\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.665\nAnd Tom Cruise's character, of course,\nis just looking around and says, or\n\n141\n00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:38.847\none of the guys says,\n\n142\n00:07:38.847 --> 00:07:42.737\nI'm just trying to figure out who's\nthe best of the best in this room.\n\n143\n00:07:42.737 --> 00:07:47.280\nAnd, of course, they all answer it's me,\nit's me, it's me.\n\n144\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.360\nWell, even though all of them may\nbelieve that, you'll actually\n\n145\n00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.670\nend up seeing somebody jockeying for\nthat position is what you'll see.\n\n146\n00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.435\nSo they call it alpha positioning here.\n\n147\n00:07:56.435 --> 00:07:57.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Where they really are,\n\n148\n00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.260\nthey're standing up and saying yes\n&gt;&gt; A storms a brewing,\n\n149\n00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.233\nwe've got that terminology we can relate\nit to some kind of associations there.\n\n150\n00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.769\n&gt;&gt; Well, and this is where they\ncan become confrontational.\n\n151\n00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:09.589\nIf you go no, I'm actually going to\nbe the leader and And that guy goes,\n\n152\n00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.060\nI'm gonna be the leader.\n\n153\n00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.957\nWell, that's when they\nwill challenge that.\n\n154\n00:08:12.957 --> 00:08:16.842\nSo it's the same in the animal world where\nyou have something like this going on.\n\n155\n00:08:16.842 --> 00:08:20.520\nBut storming is a very natural\npart of when groups come together.\n\n156\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.530\n&gt;&gt; And then they've gotta hash\nit all out together, right?\n\n157\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.640\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and that's the idea of\njockeying for control, all right?\n\n158\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.460\nSo it's not enough just so\nyou're the alpha,\n\n159\n00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.320\nyou really do have to be able to have\nalso the same time, charisma, or\n\n160\n00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.470\nenough personality and enough influence\nin that group that has just formed,\n\n161\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.290\nthat you actually can\nnow control that group.\n\n162\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:45.120\nAnd I don't mean by control\nby twisting them, but\n\n163\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.460\nto have enough influence in that group to\nnow begin to try and line everybody up.\n\n164\n00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.470\nWithout the idea of forming going on,\n\n165\n00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.040\nwhere they get used to each\nother's presence first, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.050\nAnd then feeling comfortable enough to\nthen establish whatever is going to\n\n167\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.210\nhappen here, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.820\nAnd who's actually going to end up being\nkind of the natural leader in the group,\n\n169\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:11.560\nyou're gonna find your team always\nrelying on you as the project manager\n\n170\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.980\nto step in to actually challenge\nwhatever somebody says.\n\n171\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.260\nAnd this is not what you want\nto happen when you form a team.\n\n172\n00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.340\nYou as a project manager,\nyou should say you're a team, you do this.\n\n173\n00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.070\nYou figure this out.\n\n174\n00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.440\nYou all set this up.\n\n175\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.430\nBecause you as a project manager,\nyou're not only managing that team, right?\n\n176\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.110\nYou're having to actually\noversee multiple teams.\n\n177\n00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.870\nWell, if you're actually the one\nthat says all right, here it is,\n\n178\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.220\nCherokee, you're going to do this, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.170\nAnd then somebody in the group goes, well,\n\n180\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.810\nI don't know why I wasn't considered,\nokay?\n\n181\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.610\nWhy wasn't I considered for that?\n\n182\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.234\nAnd then every decision that Cherokee\nmakes that he disagrees with,\n\n183\n00:09:47.234 --> 00:09:50.660\nhe doesn't go to Cherokee,\neven though that's who he should go to,\n\n184\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.650\nhe just simply oversteps Cherokee and\nsays, here's what I think should happen.\n\n185\n00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.900\nCherokee said this is the way it's\ngonna be, and I can always say,\n\n186\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.200\nwhat Cherokee says is good,\nand that's the way it goes.\n\n187\n00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.870\nWell, then that person goes back and\ndoes what starts to kind of grumble and\n\n188\n00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.240\nstarts to complain a bit more.\n\n189\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.390\nAnd then even though Cherokee is the\nleader in terms of title that I presented,\n\n190\n00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.570\nevery decision that she makes that's\nbeing disagreed with, gets challenged.\n\n191\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.230\nAnd then I had to come back in or\nsomebody has to come back in and\n\n192\n00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.790\ngo, all right here it is, here's the way\nit's gonna be, you all better follow this.\n\n193\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.070\nNext decision comes along,\nthey'll do the same thing.\n\n194\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.740\n&gt;&gt; But ultimately it does come\ndown to that project manager's\n\n195\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.760\nresponsibility, right?\n\n196\n00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.440\nSo they have to go ahead and take control.\n\n197\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.200\nIf they see a leader that's maybe not\ngetting the respect that they need,\n\n198\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.160\nthen they're gonna have to\nmake that judgement call.\n\n199\n00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.650\n&gt;&gt; That is definitely true.\n\n200\n00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.010\nThe very fact is, it is a responsibility.\n\n201\n00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.980\nBut imagine having to do that for\nsix teams, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.340\nThat every time that the decision is made.\n\n203\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.970\nSo even though they may actually\nkind of bow out in one or\n\n204\n00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.880\ntwo decisions, after a while,\nnow you're dealing with six\n\n205\n00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.110\ndifferent teams that are constantly coming\nto you like, well, you need to make\n\n206\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.190\na decision on this cuz I believe\nCherokee is making the wrong decision.\n\n207\n00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.300\nAnd in that, Cherokee is like, well,\nyou've gotta support me behind this.\n\n208\n00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.680\nAnd then, I have to evaluate that and\ngo, either I agree with them or not.\n\n209\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.770\nBut in this sense if we allow for\nthe storming, and for\n\n210\n00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.400\nthat forming to go on naturally, right?\n\n211\n00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Less micromanagement.\n\n212\n00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.380\n&gt;&gt; Less micromanagement has to take place.\n\n213\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.680\nAnd so as much as it pains you\nto see people jockeying for\n\n214\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.290\nthose positions and you wanna step in,\n\n215\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.690\nyou really want to try and allow for\nsomething like this to happen.\n\n216\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.510\nSo understanding the natural\nway that this is gonna happen\n\n217\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:39.180\nis really a key aspect of doing something\nlike the idea of developing a team.\n\n218\n00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.990\nIt doesn't always have to happen that way.\n\n219\n00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.430\nIf you want to actually run it,\n\n220\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.300\nlike essentially the way that\nthe army does it, right?\n\n221\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.500\nThey say,\nhere's who you're gonna listen to.\n\n222\n00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.500\nGreat, as long as everybody\nthat you hire [LAUGH],\n\n223\n00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:56.080\nokay, doesn't have previous experience of\nbeing the top dog or understanding that.\n\n224\n00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.200\nBut in this sense,\n\n225\n00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.890\nwhen you do have experts in your field,\nand so here's where you get storming\n\n226\n00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.450\nhappening right away instead of\nthe forming that goes on, right?\n\n227\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:10.930\nWhere you go, I've called together the top\nten people that can help me do this, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.670\nAnd then every one of them have\nbeen a project lead in some big,\n\n229\n00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.400\ngigantic project together.\n\n230\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.066\nAnd now you're saying,\nI'm now gonna make you equals.\n\n231\n00:12:19.066 --> 00:12:19.670\nGood luck.\n\n232\n00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n233\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:26.920\n&gt;&gt; And naturally allowing those guys\nto say, I'm not equal to Ronnie, I am\n\n234\n00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.360\nsuperior, I have the better experience,\nI have the better knowledge behind this.\n\n235\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.680\nSo I should naturally be this, okay?\n\n236\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.060\nAnd so in that sense, yeah,\nyou really don't need that happening.\n\n237\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.870\nSo a lot of times in your team forming,\nyou do have to allow for\n\n238\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.910\nthat awkwardness to happen, and\nallow them to learn each other.\n\n239\n00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.190\nAnd then they also have to see as a group,\n\n240\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.080\nwho is really going to really help\nthem to succeed in the project.\n\n241\n00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.450\nAnd that they can actually\nfind the respect, and\n\n242\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.080\nthey can find the influence to do so.\n\n243\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.190\nThey will become kind of the natural\nleader, and people will listen to them\n\n244\n00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.840\nbecause they trust them and\nthey actually respect that person.\n\n245\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.140\nInstead of them going, well,\nthat's the way that Ronnie said it is.\n\n246\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.780\n&gt;&gt; That's the pecking order.\n\n247\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the pecking order.\n\n248\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.490\nAnd in that sense,\nthat's not very satisfying.\n\n249\n00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.140\nAnd you can now figure out why\npeople then just kinda go,\n\n250\n00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.170\nI don't wanna work on that project,\nlet's just get out of here and do that.\n\n251\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.860\nAnd now you're left with a hole,\nand a gap.\n\n252\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.162\nSo being able to figure out how\nteams really do naturally develop\n\n253\n00:13:24.162 --> 00:13:26.791\nin those phases is really important for\n\n254\n00:13:26.791 --> 00:13:30.870\nus when we start to see just\nthe very beginning there, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.123\n&gt;&gt; Norming,\nthis is such a weird word, norming.\n\n256\n00:13:33.123 --> 00:13:36.981\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the next phase that we take\na look at, it is kind of unusual but\n\n257\n00:13:36.981 --> 00:13:39.030\nnorming is exactly like it sounds.\n\n258\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.360\nEverybody now starts to\nkind of feel comfort or\n\n259\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.390\nnaturally reached if you allow for\nit happen.\n\n260\n00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:52.260\nSo they actually understand what\nin that group dynamic, okay?\n\n261\n00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.860\nWhat their positions are and\ntheir particular places are going to be.\n\n262\n00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.640\nWhether it's a hierarchical type of group\nor whether you kind of settle out and\n\n263\n00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.430\neverybody kind of collaborates together,\nyou actually figure that out as well.\n\n264\n00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.940\nAnd then when you have\nnorming that goes on,\n\n265\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.950\neverybody starts to kind of drop away\nfrom the idea of interpersonal problems.\n\n266\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.360\nInstead of focusing in on,\nduring that storming stage and\n\n267\n00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.010\nthat forming stage,\ninterpersonal problems can happen.\n\n268\n00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.830\nI'm not going to say they're going\nto be the biggest explosions ever.\n\n269\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.600\nBut they happen here at\nthis particular point.\n\n270\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.570\nThey just chalk it up to me.\n\n271\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.160\n&gt;&gt; They've accepted it, they've kind of\nsettled into their own little positions,\n\n272\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.700\nand they're ready to get working.\n\n273\n00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.663\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's when they just say,\nthat's just Ronnie being Ronnie.\n\n274\n00:14:36.663 --> 00:14:41.340\nAnd what happens then is that they just\nrealize something that even though Ronnie\n\n275\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.668\ndoesn't work well in a group, he tends\nto contribute, he tends to still do\n\n276\n00:14:45.668 --> 00:14:50.740\nwhat he needs to do and then he's actually\nable to kind of work his way through.\n\n277\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.970\nAlso, people tend to respect each other,\n\n278\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.270\nto be able to allow for\ndecisions to be made jointly.\n\n279\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.483\nOne person doesn't always make\nthe decision because you naturally kind of\n\n280\n00:14:59.483 --> 00:15:01.770\ncome to that agreement and\nfigure that out.\n\n281\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.550\nMutual responsibility.\n\n282\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.680\nAnd even a bit of familiarity.\n\n283\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.000\nIn other words, even saying good morning\nto the entire team, in the morning.\n\n284\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.790\nI know that sounds weird.\n\n285\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:16.680\nOr saying good night to the entire team\nwhen you actually leave from that day.\n\n286\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.590\nSo when you don't have\nthe norming that goes on,\n\n287\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:25.000\nyou have a little bit of productivity, and\na lot of mountain that you have to climb.\n\n288\n00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.460\nWhen norming settles in,\nthe majority of your work\n\n289\n00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.360\nas the team actually begins to work\nvery well, and then you have to\n\n290\n00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.540\ndeal with some of the minor things such\nas personality disruptions that happen.\n\n291\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.540\nSomebody just gets fed up\njust too many times and\n\n292\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.340\nit explodes every once in a while.\n\n293\n00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.490\nBut here the idea's simple.\n\n294\n00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.180\nThey feel comfortable with each other.\n\n295\n00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:52.690\nThey are now ready to begin,\nto actually operate efficiently as a team.\n\n296\n00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:56.670\nAnd that is when it moves into that\nrealm of what we call performing at that\n\n297\n00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.860\npoint, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.260\nNotice the way that I have this summarized\nhere, team becomes effective and\n\n299\n00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.470\nproductive, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.449\nMakes sense, right?\n\n301\n00:16:03.449 --> 00:16:05.942\nBecause now you understand\nwhere everything is,\n\n302\n00:16:05.942 --> 00:16:08.120\neverybody feels comfortable.\n\n303\n00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.065\nYou now just go ahead and\nyou start doing you job, okay.\n\n304\n00:16:11.065 --> 00:16:14.935\nTeam members start to trust each other,\nand as you begin to trust each other,\n\n305\n00:16:14.935 --> 00:16:17.750\nwork really does get\naccomplished from this.\n\n306\n00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.590\nIf you are not seeing team\nperformance happening,\n\n307\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.480\nokay, there is probably some stage\nthat you've missed at the beginning.\n\n308\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.010\nWhether it was the Norming or\n\n309\n00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.150\nStorming stage you never\nreally got to that particular\n\n310\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.550\npoint where performance would come in to\nactually hit what you actually needed to.\n\n311\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.920\nAnd so we tend to see a lot of this,\n\n312\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.020\nespecially on very high\nperformance types of teams where\n\n313\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.920\nthey just know that if it's done, it's\ndone and it's good and it's over with.\n\n314\n00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.750\nBut when you don't have that sense\nof trust there you actually end up\n\n315\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.120\nseeing that that team will work\ntogether to a point and then they won't\n\n316\n00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.310\ntrust on certain levels and then they'll\ntry and do everything on their own.\n\n317\n00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.440\nAnd you see this a lot in sports teams\nas well where everything's working great\n\n318\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.360\nthrough the game and\nthen they just fall apart at the end.\n\n319\n00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.590\nWhen they feel like everything is falling\napart they revert back to old bad habits.\n\n320\n00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:09.380\nAnd that's what can also happen due\nwhen performing starts to happen.\n\n321\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.070\nAnd then ultimately one of\nthe harder things to do,\n\n322\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.030\nin terms of team development,\nis that adjourning.\n\n323\n00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.630\nThe finishing up of everything\nafter the project is over and\n\n324\n00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.060\nthat it's actually complete here.\n\n325\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.190\nThe breaking up of the team.\n\n326\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.470\nRealizing that these people, as much\nas they might have enjoyed the project,\n\n327\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.590\nhopefully that's what happened, and\nnot actually trudge through the project,\n\n328\n00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.070\nthat now they're actually breaking up\nthis very neat unit that they've been\n\n329\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.550\nworking very well with and they desire\nto work with those people again.\n\n330\n00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.250\nSo that's where a team really does\nhave it's natural development\n\n331\n00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.200\nphases that we tend to see.\n\n332\n00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.760\nwhen you start taking a look at\nthe idea of team development here.\n\n333\n00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.170\nIt really does end up happening for\nus if that team is together for\n\n334\n00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.480\na good long time,\n\n335\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.320\nyou actually end up seeing that all this\ncan actually happen very, very quickly.\n\n336\n00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.750\nOr it can happen over time.\n\n337\n00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.840\nYou might find out that you\nmight get a team together and\n\n338\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.960\nit might be weeks before anything like\nthis actually comes to the norming stage\n\n339\n00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.920\nbut then there's sometimes where\nthe people would just kind of gel.\n\n340\n00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.180\nNorming happens very easily, and\n\n341\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.080\nthen performance happens just\nabout immediately as well.\n\n342\n00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.020\n&gt;&gt; So what if you have this cohesive team,\nall right?\n\n343\n00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.400\nEveryone's already met each other, we've\ngone through these developmental phases,\n\n344\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.250\nbut what if we integrate someone new,\n\n345\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.100\nmaybe a new hire,\nduring one of those latter phases?\n\n346\n00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.180\nThat kind of throws a wrench\nin your plan there.\n\n347\n00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.340\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely will throw\na wrench in the plan.\n\n348\n00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.120\nAnd the weird thing about the way\nthat teams really do develop\n\n349\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.500\nis not just as simple as folding\nsomebody in, it's not like adding\n\n350\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.570\nin a little bit of water into the cake\nmix and go, I need to change that.\n\n351\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.610\nWhat ends up happening is\nthat you end up seeing that\n\n352\n00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.790\nthe same thing starts\nto happen over again.\n\n353\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.110\nSo in other words you might see where\nyour entire team really does go back\n\n354\n00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.720\nto the idea of forming again.\n\n355\n00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.270\nOkay?\n\n356\n00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then you might see where now\n\n357\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.610\nsomebody goes now this person agrees with\nme and they start storming through again\n\n358\n00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.910\nand then they feel natural and\nget to that performance stage.\n\n359\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.820\nBut there's times though where you\nmight find out the person just\n\n360\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.220\nreally does fit into the group but\neven so,\n\n361\n00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.740\nright, everybody still has to go\nthrough that because they realize\n\n362\n00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.210\nthat the team dynamic has changed\nby the addition of person in there.\n\n363\n00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.760\nAnd so we now to include them in or\n\n364\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.812\nyou might find that the group\nexcludes them completely.\n\n365\n00:19:21.812 --> 00:19:24.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda bad, they get ostracized.\n\n366\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.550\nIt's like me when I was in grade school.\n\n367\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.190\nNo, I'm joking.\n\n368\n00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.500\nDon't worry about me.\n\n369\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.370\nI've gotten over that by now.\n\n370\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.200\nBut overall though you\nkinda get this idea, right?\n\n371\n00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.030\nThat everytime you introduce\nnew team members in,\n\n372\n00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.390\nyou'll see this naturally happen.\n\n373\n00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.320\nHopefully, as a project manager,\nyou wanna have to lead them through it.\n\n374\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.550\nBut you've got to realize the steps\nthat really does take to form that team.\n\n375\n00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:50.520\nBecause if not, you're gonna find yourself\nin that position between norming and\n\n376\n00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.700\nrow true performance that happens\nthat is just not going to be there.\n\n377\n00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.170\nYou're gonna wonder why everybody feels\ncomfortable and laughing around but\n\n378\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:59.318\nthey can't get anything done.\n\n379\n00:19:59.318 --> 00:20:00.548\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:20:00.548 --> 00:20:01.320\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n381\n00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.820\nthat might be okay but usually it's not.\n\n382\n00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.170\nEspecially if it's a project, you just\ndon't have enough time to do that.\n\n383\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.860\nYou really do need to see where\npeople are in their stage,\n\n384\n00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.240\nespecially on project management and\npersonnel management.\n\n385\n00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.550\nAs you start working through\nthe project there too.\n\n386\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.910\nOkay now how can we\nactually make this happen?\n\n387\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.760\nI don't want to say naturally anymore.\n\n388\n00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.760\nBut how can we kind of nudge it.\n\n389\n00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.570\nI could say force it, how do we force\nthis down somebody's throat here.\n\n390\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:31.885\n&gt;&gt; Like a catalyst.\n\n391\n00:20:31.885 --> 00:20:34.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah what can\nyou do to actually do that.\n\n392\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.060\nWell, there's a couple of\nways that we can do this.\n\n393\n00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.066\nAnd when it comes down to it,\nand you've probably heard this,\n\n394\n00:20:41.066 --> 00:20:44.167\nin any kind of team performance,\nimprovement,\n\n395\n00:20:44.167 --> 00:20:48.800\nself-improvement program,\nmentoring, should talk about.\n\n396\n00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.370\nThere's a couple of things\nthat they end up doing.\n\n397\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.940\nSo let's take a look at a couple of these,\nokay?\n\n398\n00:20:54.980 --> 00:21:00.770\nTo me I like the idea of the second one,\nwhich we call informal activities, okay?\n\n399\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.880\nNow informal activities are good once\nyou get people past that forming and\n\n400\n00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.450\nstorming stage.\n\n401\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:14.170\nInformal activity is not so good during\nthe forming and storming stages as well.\n\n402\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.830\nNow when I say that,\n\n403\n00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:22.250\nthe reason why is that they might not feel\nsuper comfortable with each other yet.\n\n404\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.830\nOkay?\n\n405\n00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.330\nSo the idea of you going, hey, let's go\nand grab a couple of beers after work.\n\n406\n00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.620\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was thinking.\n\n407\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.677\nI see it up there and\n\n408\n00:21:28.677 --> 00:21:33.057\nI don't know how well that would mesh\ntogether with the alpha personalities.\n\n409\n00:21:33.057 --> 00:21:34.778\nI'm trying to figure that out.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, with everybody trying to do that.\n\n410\n00:21:34.778 --> 00:21:36.140\nYeah, it's very difficult, okay?\n\n411\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.070\nBut once they get past that informal\nactivities are good because it helps\n\n412\n00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.910\nto build the continuity in the team.\n\n413\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.740\nThey understand that they can grab\na couple of beers, or you can actually do\n\n414\n00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:49.720\na team lunch that allows them to feel good\nand stay away from the focus of work.\n\n415\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.340\nSo team building in this sense,\non your team doing this on a periodic\n\n416\n00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.190\nbasis is really good during a project\nwhen there's high pressure,\n\n417\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.860\nwhen high performance is\nalways demanded of your team.\n\n418\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.850\nAnd formal activities are key, right.\n\n419\n00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.780\nEven if it's just bringing in\ndonuts every once in a while,\n\n420\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.480\nnow I shouldn't use donuts,\ncuz apparently,\n\n421\n00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.810\neverybody around here doesn't like\ndonuts except for me, I love them.\n\n422\n00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.930\nAnd so when they're,\nwhen somebody brings donuts in,\n\n423\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.420\nI'm usually the one that eats all of them.\n\n424\n00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.470\nAnd that's the problem, right?\n\n425\n00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.130\nAnd so, yeah Peter kind of\nbrings in like three dozen.\n\n426\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.470\nI think I eat two and a half of them.\n\n427\n00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.420\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; It's just that they're so\n\n428\n00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.680\ngood that we'll probably eat all\nof them unless we try to refrain.\n\n429\n00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so and I don't have that problem.\n\n430\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.400\nCuz I have no inhibitions\nabout eating multiple donuts,\n\n431\n00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.960\nwhere everybody else does.\n\n432\n00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.740\nSo for me it's probably not a great idea\nbecause it probably affects my heart,\n\n433\n00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.570\nbut overall though, you start to see this.\n\n434\n00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.960\nSo informal activities are really good.\n\n435\n00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.010\n&gt;&gt; But those formal ones, those are kind\nof the awkward moments, aren't they?\n\n436\n00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.090\n&gt;&gt; They really are.\n\n437\n00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.840\nOkay, now, when you start,\n\n438\n00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.840\nit always reminds me of movies that\nyou see on these things, right.\n\n439\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.240\nThere's always that trust fall.\n\n440\n00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.660\n&gt;&gt; It always makes me think of those\nstickers, the hello, my name is stickers.\n\n441\n00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's one of those unusual\nformal activities that you have.\n\n442\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.970\nAnd we traditionally, you start off with\nwhat everybody starts off with, right?\n\n443\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.570\nAn icebreaker, a game, right?\n\n444\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just to kind of get you to do\n\n445\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.930\nsomething silly to break\nthe tension that's in the air.\n\n446\n00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.660\nBut they are very effective during\nthis forming and storming stages.\n\n447\n00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.500\nAnd the reason why is that it shows that\nsomebody has something together and they\n\n448\n00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.590\nreally want the meshing to actually occur\nfaster than the natural development might.\n\n449\n00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.730\nOkay, now when you start doing this,\nright,\n\n450\n00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.900\nwhen you start realizing\nthis has to be done quickly.\n\n451\n00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.630\nYou tend to actually kind of\npull out all the stops in this\n\n452\n00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.740\nformal activity there, okay.\n\n453\n00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.660\nNow this can actually range from anything,\nright.\n\n454\n00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.900\nSo for me, because I'm cheap, it would be\nall right, here's what we're gonna do, and\n\n455\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.890\nyou better trust each other doing this,\nokay, in doing that.\n\n456\n00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.210\nBut you do have companies that say\nall right here's what we're gonna do.\n\n457\n00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:56.744\nWe're gonna have this weekend retreat\ndoing paintball or whatever it is.\n\n458\n00:23:56.744 --> 00:24:01.444\nGoing to one of these camps that\nactually build these trust relationships\n\n459\n00:24:01.444 --> 00:24:06.090\nwhere you're standing on top of a six\nfoot table and just fall backward.\n\n460\n00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.788\nJust go ahead and fall backward.\nThe team will catch you.\n\n461\n00:24:07.788 --> 00:24:10.688\nIn doing that type of thing and\nthat's a little bit unnerving,\n\n462\n00:24:10.688 --> 00:24:12.769\nespecially with people you don't know, but\n\n463\n00:24:12.769 --> 00:24:16.470\nit kinda lets you know that\nthey're really trying to do that.\n\n464\n00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.652\nSo a project manager that says, this\nis the best effort that we can have and\n\n465\n00:24:20.652 --> 00:24:25.037\nthey need to have it done real quickly,\nyou tend to go for those, I dont want to\n\n466\n00:24:25.037 --> 00:24:28.760\ncall them the extreme Olympics of\n[LAUGH] team formal activities.\n\n467\n00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.935\n&gt;&gt; I've actually done that before, yeah.\n\n468\n00:24:30.935 --> 00:24:32.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And what was your overall impression?\n\n469\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.880\n&gt;&gt; I really thought it was very\neffective to be honest with you, yeah.\n\n470\n00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.066\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, did you feel more\ncomfortable with your team after,\n\n471\n00:24:39.066 --> 00:24:43.740\ndid you feel bonds being made,\nthat you've moved into the norming stage?\n\n472\n00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.452\n&gt;&gt; I definitely do.\n\n473\n00:24:44.452 --> 00:24:45.320\n&gt;&gt; See.\n&gt;&gt; I even still\n\n474\n00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.990\nfeel like those people\nare really close to me.\n\n475\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.760\n&gt;&gt; See.\nAnd that's what it does,\n\n476\n00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.800\nis that you end up getting that.\n\n477\n00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.052\nAnd did you feel that way, let's say,\nright after the form [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n478\n00:24:53.052 --> 00:24:56.770\nAll right, these are cool people,\nI can work with these guys?\n\n479\n00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.841\n&gt;&gt; I kinda knew they\nwere cool ahead of time.\n\n480\n00:24:58.841 --> 00:24:59.341\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\n\n481\n00:24:59.341 --> 00:25:00.520\n&gt;&gt; If you already knew they were\n\n482\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.350\ncool ahead of time,\nthat's a little bit more.\n\n483\n00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.960\nBut if you were to do an activity\nwith me and you didn't know me,\n\n484\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.390\nyou might go, not really.\n\n485\n00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:07.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [CROSSTALK] I probably\nwouldn't know ahead of time.\n\n486\n00:25:07.338 --> 00:25:08.185\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you probably wouldn't done that.\n\n487\n00:25:08.185 --> 00:25:09.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So overall though,\n\n488\n00:25:09.499 --> 00:25:13.165\nthat's one of those things, especially\nif I were the one falling backwards.\n\n489\n00:25:13.165 --> 00:25:14.433\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you had to catch,\n\n490\n00:25:14.433 --> 00:25:16.840\nthat would probably be\nawkward [LAUGH] overall.\n\n491\n00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.210\nBut you can see where this\nactually does allow everybody to\n\n492\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.147\nget to know each other, okay.\n\n493\n00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:28.331\nBut, it really does require them at that\npoint for the project manager excuse me,\n\n494\n00:25:28.331 --> 00:25:31.848\nto be seen as leading this\ntype of team activity, okay.\n\n495\n00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.807\nSo he becomes the actual,\nreal leader at this point of forming and\n\n496\n00:25:36.807 --> 00:25:39.604\nthen the storming and\nas I'm going through this and\n\n497\n00:25:39.604 --> 00:25:42.726\nthat way they know,\nwho they are supposed to approach and\n\n498\n00:25:42.726 --> 00:25:46.880\nthat's what you wanna do,\nif you have that opportunity, right.\n\n499\n00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.355\nThe natural way is by follow the best but\nin a project management,\n\n500\n00:25:50.355 --> 00:25:54.460\nwhere you are pulling in multiple\nresources from very diverse backgrounds,\n\n501\n00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.400\nyou might find out you're the one that\nreally does need to make those decisions.\n\n502\n00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.260\nSo you need to be the one\nleading these activities, so\n\n503\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.380\nthat they know afterwards,\nthey go to you, okay.\n\n504\n00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.310\nThat you're the one who that\nthey're really going to pull on and\n\n505\n00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.330\nask questions of and you'll actually\nprovide the answers that they need.\n\n506\n00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:16.689\nSo it's real important that you understand\nthat particular role of actually doing\n\n507\n00:26:16.689 --> 00:26:20.440\nthese types of formal and informal\ntypes of activities as well, okay.\n\n508\n00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:26.627\nNow when we start to take a look\nat some of the other things then,\n\n509\n00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:30.148\nwe actually have to talk just\nbriefly a little here on,\n\n510\n00:26:30.148 --> 00:26:35.110\nlet me make sure that I'm covering it,\non team selection as well.\n\n511\n00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.042\nSo let's talk about that briefly for\na moment,\n\n512\n00:26:38.042 --> 00:26:41.280\nCherokee is the idea of what\nwe call team selection.\n\n513\n00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.410\n&gt;&gt; Can we look at some guidelines,\n\n514\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.540\nmaybe just some tips for\nteam member selection, Ronnie?\n\n515\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.931\n&gt;&gt; Well, we can talk about some\nguidelines, I don't really have anything\n\n516\n00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:52.480\non my screen to show some of\nthese different guidelines here.\n\n517\n00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.050\nBut overall though, when we talks\nabout the idea about guidelines for\n\n518\n00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.210\nteam selection, when you're\nstarting to build a project, okay.\n\n519\n00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.610\nFirst and foremost,\nwe wanna actually make sure that everybody\n\n520\n00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.960\nknows at the very beginning\nwhen you select the team, okay.\n\n521\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.040\nWhat has to be accomplished?\n\n522\n00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.918\nOkay, from that point, you can actually\nthen select team members based on the need\n\n523\n00:27:12.918 --> 00:27:17.028\nthat you have or you can actually go\nahead and go all right, Cherokee,\n\n524\n00:27:17.028 --> 00:27:19.270\nyou're already good at this, okay.\n\n525\n00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.140\nWhat we need to do is, we need to show\nyou how you actually now perform for\n\n526\n00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.695\nour team and our project here, okay.\n\n527\n00:27:26.695 --> 00:27:31.750\nSo actually, this is a great example of\nwhat we're talking about right here and\n\n528\n00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.610\nI'm using Cherokee as a real example.\n\n529\n00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:37.350\nIn this sense, Cherokee has\nalready been teaching CompTIA and\n\n530\n00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.700\nMicrosoft Server and other things\nthat I've never even heard of.\n\n531\n00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.444\nSo she knows how to present this stuff in\nthat formal classroom way of training but\n\n532\n00:27:45.444 --> 00:27:49.020\nthe way that we're doing it\nhere is a little bit more-\n\n533\n00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.062\n&gt;&gt; Informal.\n\n534\n00:27:50.062 --> 00:27:50.562\n&gt;&gt; Informal.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n535\n00:27:50.562 --> 00:27:51.684\n&gt;&gt; A little bit more kinda,\n\n536\n00:27:51.684 --> 00:27:53.720\nthrowing it back and\nforth so that we have it.\n\n537\n00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.510\nSo in that sense,\n\n538\n00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.253\nwe don't really have to teach\nher much on the knowledge side,\n\n539\n00:27:57.253 --> 00:27:59.730\nshe probably knows more\nthan I do about this stuff.\n\n540\n00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.730\n&gt;&gt; But I'm definitely awkward.\n\n541\n00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.300\n&gt;&gt; A Little bit awkward there,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n542\n00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.703\n&gt;&gt; You should let other people tell you\n\n543\n00:28:04.703 --> 00:28:05.512\nthat instead.\n\n544\n00:28:05.512 --> 00:28:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right [LAUGH].\n\n545\n00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But instead, this is what we do right,\n\n546\n00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.330\nwe say, we wanted her on our team because\nwe realized something that we could\n\n547\n00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.280\nactually go ahead and do what is called\ntraining for performance at this point.\n\n548\n00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.680\nIn other words,\nwe're just taking her knowledge and\n\n549\n00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.735\nher skills and showing her how to\nactually perform at ITProTV, okay.\n\n550\n00:28:24.735 --> 00:28:29.810\nSo in that sense, it really can, so\nwhen you actually do have team selection,\n\n551\n00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:34.100\nyou really have those two possibilities in\ngeneral, don't get me wrong there's many,\n\n552\n00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.610\nbut in general, you either go ahead and\nyou hire for the need that you have.\n\n553\n00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:41.390\nThis is exactly who I need or\nyou sit there and go all right,\n\n554\n00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.950\nI'm not really concerned so much about the\nknowledge base that they have, but who do\n\n555\n00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:50.175\nwe want that we can get and we train them\nhow to perform the way that we want to.\n\n556\n00:28:50.175 --> 00:28:53.190\n&gt;&gt; You'll see that there's a lot of\ncharacteristics, they're not really things\n\n557\n00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:59.280\nthat can be trained upon,\nthings integrity and\n\n558\n00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.760\na lot of those interpersonal skills\nthat you'd spoke about earlier.\n\n559\n00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are a lot of these things\nwhere we just have to feel it out and\n\n560\n00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:09.920\nunderstand what happens here but\n\n561\n00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.790\nin a project setting, again those\nare usually the two big things here, okay.\n\n562\n00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.060\nIf you have a lot more time, where it's\navailable and the project isn't starting\n\n563\n00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:22.010\nfor another six months, you may actually\nhire a group of people that you\n\n564\n00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:27.050\ndevelop into your team okay, to get\nready for this project that's going on.\n\n565\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.000\nBut there's a lot of times where instead,\nyou actually do have to hire for\n\n566\n00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.580\nthe need that you have and\nthen you actually work with them instead.\n\n567\n00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.990\nSo there's a lot more for us to actually\ngo and take a look at but Cherokee,\n\n568\n00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.750\nI think I've talked way too much\nin this segment and so far.\n\n569\n00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:44.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm gonna have to cut you off\nRonnie, that's it for this episode guys.\n\n570\n00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.530\nWe've looked at quite a bit so far, for\n\n571\n00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.060\nour personnel management and\nhave a look at those resources.\n\n572\n00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.510\nThank you guys, for tuning in but\n\n573\n00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:56.160\nstay tuned because we have another episode\ncoming your way, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n574\n00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n575\n00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.493\n&gt;&gt; Signing off, have a great day.\n\n576\n00:29:58.493 -->

Welcome to another awesome\nCompTIA Project+ episode here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.362\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:23.280\nWe're gonna be diving a little bit\nfurther into our resource management.\n\n10\n00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.410\nIn the last episode,\nif you guys were following along,\n\n11\n00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.360\nwe looked at personnel management.\n\n12\n00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.670\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and continue with\nsome additional personnel management.\n\n13\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.670\nAnd then we'll even look at\nsome conflict resolutions.\n\n14\n00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.790\nAnd we have Mr. Ronnie here to\ngo ahead and help us with that.\n\n15\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.440\nSo thank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue to take a look at\n\n17\n00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.250\nthe idea of personnel management.\n\n18\n00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.950\nNow, we've got a few more topics\nto actually cover because,\n\n19\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.180\nwell, I talk a lot.\n\n20\n00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.534\nAnd that means we didn't cover everything\nwe needed to in our other episode, so\n\n21\n00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:53.696\nnow we're continuing on.\n\n22\n00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:59.940\nAnd we need to talk about the idea here\nof working in fairly complex projects.\n\n23\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.730\nThere's a lot of times where people\nwill end up coming to your project\n\n24\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.610\nhaving worked on many diverse projects but\n\n25\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.230\nthey may not have everything that\nthey need for, well, your project.\n\n26\n00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.290\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you said earlier that you\nreally don't wanna be training people\n\n27\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.000\nwhen you're onboarding them.\n\n28\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.480\nBut when you're dealing with\na complex project like that,\n\n29\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.330\nare there any extra steps that we\nneed to go ahead and partake in?\n\n30\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.210\n&gt;&gt; You better believe it,\n\n31\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.110\nthe very fact is you will, you will\nprobably have to provide training.\n\n32\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.270\nNow when you start doing this, remember\nthat this is something that you'll\n\n33\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.190\nend up having to account for\nalso in cost and time for your project.\n\n34\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.041\nSo there's a lot of times when very\ncomplex projects happen where instead,\n\n35\n00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:42.785\nyou may go, all right, we're gonna\nsend these three people to go ahead.\n\n36\n00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:46.850\nAnd make sure that they know how one\nof these processes end up working.\n\n37\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.870\nAnd so you may send them off for\ntraining for a week, maybe even two weeks.\n\n38\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.480\nAnd then they come back, and they're ready\nto now be kind of the subject matter\n\n39\n00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.010\nexpert in that particular task that you\nactually have them assigned to as well.\n\n40\n00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.341\nSo it actually requires you first and\nforemost to understand at least\n\n41\n00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:06.337\nthe members skill set\nthat they have right now.\n\n42\n00:02:06.337 --> 00:02:09.735\nAnd then of course to actually\nunderstand what skills are needed for\n\n43\n00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:11.829\nthat very complex project that you have.\n\n44\n00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:18.140\nAnd see whether or not, you can actually\nask them if they can be trained this.\n\n45\n00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.030\nYou will have two types of\nteam members here, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.560\nAnd I don't mean, I shouldn't say\nthat as being concrete, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.040\nYou'll have at least two types of team\nmembers here is what I should say.\n\n48\n00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.644\nBut usually the extremes are this,\nokay, one, absolutely,\n\n49\n00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:33.828\nsend me the anything that you want to.\n\n50\n00:02:33.828 --> 00:02:35.569\nI will get trained for it-\n&gt;&gt; Sign me up, woo.\n\n51\n00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.509\n&gt;&gt; That's right, sign me up.\n\n52\n00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:40.561\nAnd I will do it, and those\nare the ones that you really do love.\n\n53\n00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:43.685\nYou have the other guy who says,\nI don't think so.\n\n54\n00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:45.284\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n55\n00:02:45.284 --> 00:02:47.510\nwhat kind of a team member are you?\n\n56\n00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.080\n&gt;&gt; I really do like\nthe idea of training but I-\n\n57\n00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.900\n&gt;&gt; I know what kind of team\n\n58\n00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.490\nmember you are.\n\n59\n00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.130\nI think we're very similar in that way.\n\n60\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.228\nActually, Ronnie and I both we signed up\nfor what, a Cisco Learning Experience.\n\n61\n00:02:57.228 --> 00:02:57.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right.\n\n62\n00:02:57.948 --> 00:02:59.649\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he tries to make it look so\n\n63\n00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:01.663\neasy in that other episode-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n64\n00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:02.730\n&gt;&gt; Where they're preparing for the shows.\n\n65\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n66\n00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:07.467\n&gt;&gt; And whatever we have to go through\nwhen you were applying those points,\n\n67\n00:03:07.467 --> 00:03:09.000\nthe effort points.\n\n68\n00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.479\nBut really, for\nthe one training, it was what,\n\n69\n00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.681\n250 hours-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n70\n00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:13.563\n&gt;&gt; Training involved?\n\n71\n00:03:13.563 --> 00:03:15.282\nSo it's not so easy Ronnie,\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n72\n00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:16.024\n&gt;&gt; Give yourself more credit.\n\n73\n00:03:16.024 --> 00:03:18.488\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's not a lot of easy things for that.\n\n74\n00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:22.780\nBut that's gonna help us out later on in\nshows as we start to do other things.\n\n75\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.330\n&gt;&gt; And help you guys out.\n\n76\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.830\n&gt;&gt; So yeah and\n\n77\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.060\nhelp everybody else out in our audience\nhere as we start to do things.\n\n78\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.090\nSo, you may actually have to provide that.\n\n79\n00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.570\nNow, sometimes though you may end up also\nseeing that there's things that we don't\n\n80\n00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.900\nknow about especially,\non a brand new project.\n\n81\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.571\nAnd even though, you might have\nthe general skill set to go right,\n\n82\n00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:40.193\nI think that we could use that skill set,\n\n83\n00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:42.309\nyou might found out something\nelse on your project.\n\n84\n00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:47.051\nIs that, it may actually follow underneath\nsome regulatory compliance issues.\n\n85\n00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:51.992\nAnd I know of all the things that I\nreally do not like to try on even though,\n\n86\n00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:57.030\nI know that we need to at times is\nthat idea of regulatory compliance.\n\n87\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.324\nThe idea of actually having to go and\nlearn what the laws are, and\n\n88\n00:03:59.324 --> 00:04:01.807\nwhat you have to do, and what you can do,\nand what you shouldn't do.\n\n89\n00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:02.504\n&gt;&gt; I plead the fifth.\n\n90\n00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:04.218\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you plead the fifth and\n\n91\n00:04:04.218 --> 00:04:05.604\neverything is good and you're fine.\n\n92\n00:04:05.604 --> 00:04:08.912\nBut you may find out that it is\nabout that idea where you have that,\n\n93\n00:04:08.912 --> 00:04:11.805\nyou just get everybody\ntrained on compliance.\n\n94\n00:04:11.805 --> 00:04:14.555\nSometimes the training is actually for\nsafety matter as well, so\n\n95\n00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:17.305\nthings like CPR might actually be good.\n\n96\n00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:21.125\nSo, if they're saying, we need to\ntrain you on CPR for this project,\n\n97\n00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.295\nyou may start go,\nwhoa what are we doing on this project?\n\n98\n00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:25.169\n&gt;&gt; What are we getting into?\n\n99\n00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.636\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What are we getting into?\n\n100\n00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:30.980\nIf they send you to HazMat training, again\nwhat are we getting into at this point?\n\n101\n00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.716\nSo some of these things can\nbe just issues like that.\n\n102\n00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:37.708\nBut it may be something highly technical\nwhere they actually go we're gonna get you\n\n103\n00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:38.563\ntrained in this so\n\n104\n00:04:38.563 --> 00:04:42.710\nthat you can be kinda the point person for\nthis particular task in our project.\n\n105\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.750\nWell, that's actually good.\n\n106\n00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.030\nSo you may find out that that may also\nbe it, to add additional skills so\n\n107\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.500\nthat the project can be accomplished.\n\n108\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.070\nThe great thing for you though,\nas a project member is,\n\n109\n00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.520\nyou'll get additional training that\nyou can then carry on to other places.\n\n110\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.790\nBut just kind of never overlook\nthe fact that you may have to do that.\n\n111\n00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.810\nNot everything comes together\nwhere you have everybody ready for\n\n112\n00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.240\nevery single project.\n\n113\n00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.680\nSo if you don't, and you still need to\naccomplish that project, training and\n\n114\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.730\nactually making sure that you\nhave the proper skill set\n\n115\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.790\nmay actually have to be done.\n\n116\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.916\nAnd hopefully,\nif your project is far enough out,\n\n117\n00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:17.543\nyou can set everybody to training\nbefore it actually happens.\n\n118\n00:05:17.543 --> 00:05:20.797\nBut you might find out where you're\nsending them during that project\n\n119\n00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:23.557\ntime as well so you do have to account for\nthose losses too.\n\n120\n00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:27.517\n&gt;&gt; And I'm sure lot of you are looking to\ngo ahead and obtain a certification here.\n\n121\n00:05:27.517 --> 00:05:30.442\nAnd what I had told the students\nbefore in the past is,\n\n122\n00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:34.538\nyou do have to bring something to the\ntable whenever a lot of people wanna get\n\n123\n00:05:34.538 --> 00:05:37.940\nhired after they get there certifications,\nright.\n\n124\n00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.730\nBut, something you might wanna address\nduring that courting process, during\n\n125\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.060\nthe interview, just ask them what their\ncompany stance is on continued education.\n\n126\n00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.620\nBecause even in the IT department and\na lot of other fields as well,\n\n127\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.150\ncontinued education is just so important.\n\n128\n00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.390\n&gt;&gt; And it really is and it should be,\nreally it should be a part of that process\n\n129\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.290\nespecially if they want people\nto remain with that company.\n\n130\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.555\nAnd to have longevity or continuity so\nthat they know that they can actually have\n\n131\n00:06:02.555 --> 00:06:04.467\nproject managers for\nthe next several years.\n\n132\n00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:06.488\n&gt;&gt; Well the company should\nbe evolving as well so.\n\n133\n00:06:06.488 --> 00:06:07.347\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n134\n00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:09.676\nSo that should be a part of the process,\nbut\n\n135\n00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:13.240\nyou might find yourself as that\nproject manager which realizes,\n\n136\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.874\nwe're not finding any bite right now, but\nnow as they take a look at our background.\n\n137\n00:06:17.874 --> 00:06:20.706\nAnd they ask about our technical\nunderstanding of things,\n\n138\n00:06:20.706 --> 00:06:24.048\nyou may be the perfect candidate for\nthat additional set of skill set,\n\n139\n00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:26.500\nthe type of training too, okay.\n\n140\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.401\nNow, the other thing we also have\nto worry about of course in terms\n\n141\n00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:33.372\nof team building, okay.\n\n142\n00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:34.754\nI'll trying to make sure I remember.\n\n143\n00:06:34.754 --> 00:06:39.649\nPersonnel management and resources here,\nof course, is gonna be the idea of\n\n144\n00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:44.642\nwhether we're dealing with remote types\nof personnel, in house personnel.\n\n145\n00:06:44.642 --> 00:06:49.688\nOr even other types of things that\ncan come online, such as temporary\n\n146\n00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:54.734\npersonnel that come in from a contract or\nsomething, that all of them\n\n147\n00:06:54.734 --> 00:07:00.280\nactually have some different\ncommunication issues a lot to deal with.\n\n148\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.210\nSo we do need to take a look at that too.\n\n149\n00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.884\n&gt;&gt; Well, lot of these complex situations\nor scenarios that you are explaining,\n\n150\n00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:06.560\ncould arise.\n\n151\n00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.940\nBut what if we even have\nsome kind of cross cultural\n\n152\n00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.620\ncommunications that we need to traverse?\n\n153\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.729\n&gt;&gt; You have to say this, right.\n\n154\n00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.180\nThe very fact is the world is becoming a\nsmaller place, not physically smaller but\n\n155\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.838\nbecause of the communications that we have\ntoday, due to the growth of the Internet.\n\n156\n00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:25.870\nAnd so many different communication\ntechnologies that we can use over that\n\n157\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.150\ntime period.\n\n158\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.590\nIt is incumbent upon you, to use those\nresources that are available to you,\n\n159\n00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.010\nto help to manage your time\na bit more effectively, but\n\n160\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.780\nto also understand some of\nthe time differences too.\n\n161\n00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.330\nSo, let just take for\n\n162\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.910\nan example as a barrier that we might have\nto overcome in terms of communication.\n\n163\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.022\nIn house, you normally don't have to\novercome things like time zones, okay.\n\n164\n00:07:45.022 --> 00:07:49.418\nBut if your company and you actually\nhave the project that actually spans,\n\n165\n00:07:49.418 --> 00:07:52.520\nlets say even just part\nway across the country.\n\n166\n00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.052\nSo here in the United States we have what,\nthree or four time zones.\n\n167\n00:07:55.052 --> 00:07:58.901\nI always forget mountain time is what\nI forget so, here if you're actually\n\n168\n00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:02.933\nwatching from outside the United States,\nwe have eastern, we have central,\n\n169\n00:08:02.933 --> 00:08:06.064\nwe have mountain And then,\nwe have Pacific time zone [LAUGH].\n\n170\n00:08:06.064 --> 00:08:07.466\nI think is what they call it.\n\n171\n00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:11.250\nSo, there's four different time zones and\nso if I say,\n\n172\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.551\nokay here on the east coast\nwhere I am in Florida,\n\n173\n00:08:14.551 --> 00:08:19.900\nhey we're gonna have a meeting\nat nine o' clock in the morning.\n\n174\n00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.850\nWell, I think that's perfectly natural and\nfine.\n\n175\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.413\nBut if Cherokee's team\nis over in California.\n\n176\n00:08:26.413 --> 00:08:27.381\nWest Coast, yeah.\n\n177\n00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.162\nYeah, on the West Coast,\nCherokee that means.\n\n178\n00:08:29.162 --> 00:08:30.072\nThey're still sleeping.\n\n179\n00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:31.490\nAbout what time, yeah?\n\n180\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.546\nAbout six o'clock in the morning and\n\n181\n00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:36.800\nI'm pretty sure Cherokee\nmight be awake at that point.\n\n182\n00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.800\n&gt;&gt; This is when those Skype meetings\nhave no video, just the audio.\n\n183\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.150\n&gt;&gt; Just the audio and\nnot only that, you're hoping that\n\n184\n00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.795\nwhat you're not hearing over the audio is\nsnoring, if they're actually still asleep.\n\n185\n00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:48.560\nRight.\n\n186\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.160\nSo, you do have to kind of plan for\n\n187\n00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.540\nsome of these things to be out or\neven in the other direction, right?\n\n188\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:59.480\nThe very fact, nine o'clock here,\nif we go over to the GMT over in London,\n\n189\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.480\nthe Greenwich, I always can't mean time.\n\n190\n00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.380\nRight there when you start doing that,\nthat's five hours ahead of where we\n\n191\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.240\nare too, and even though I said 9 AM,\nwell if they get up at 9 AM,\n\n192\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.980\nthat means that I have to actually\nthink about, that's 4 AM for me.\n\n193\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.990\nSo, those are some of the things\nyou have to be aware of.\n\n194\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.870\nJust even the time zone challenge is\nactually something else that we have to\n\n195\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.120\nworry about,\nespecially when scheduling meetings.\n\n196\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.800\nSo, communications we have to actually\ntake that into consideration when we\n\n197\n00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.910\nare working with diverse teams and\n\n198\n00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.530\nwhen you start actually seeing\nsome other things, too.\n\n199\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.460\nNow, of course there's actually\nthe idea of communication preferences,\n\n200\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.310\nas well, okay.\n\n201\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.460\nThere has to be decided during\nproject planning phase what\n\n202\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.630\nwe call a communication plan and\nthat's for\n\n203\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:48.300\nthe official communications\nabout the project itself.\n\n204\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.335\nIs this gonna be via email.\n\n205\n00:09:50.335 --> 00:09:52.680\nRight.\nOr is it gonna be a telephone, or\n\n206\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.810\nis it gonna be a registered letter?\n\n207\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.760\nWhatever it might be,\n\n208\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.410\nI know that sounds a little bit strange\nin todays, like registered letter?\n\n209\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.310\n&gt;&gt; Snail mail?\n\n210\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.000\n&gt;&gt; Registered letter, are you sure?\n\n211\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.850\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Faxing.\n\n212\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, faxing.\n\n213\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.685\nAnd faxing is still kind of good but.\n\n214\n00:10:04.685 --> 00:10:05.792\nYeah.\nAt the same time and\n\n215\n00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:07.170\nit is something else, right.\n\n216\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.570\nYou need to make sure that\neverybody understands\n\n217\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.260\nthat is what has to be accounted for.\n\n218\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.280\nBut sometimes you might find a mix of\nthose are actually very good depending on\n\n219\n00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.550\nwho you're having to deal with, where it's\nactually fairly easy to do something like\n\n220\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:25.360\nSkype calls today, where you have video\nconferencing that you actually can do\n\n221\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.410\nfairly easily that might be the way to go.\n\n222\n00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.022\nBut you might find out that on some teams,\nreaching them, using something like that,\n\n223\n00:10:32.022 --> 00:10:36.160\nif especially they're in a remote location\nwhere the idea of a video conference call\n\n224\n00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.910\nis not the greatest, because the internet\nconnection is not the greatest wherever\n\n225\n00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.050\nthey are, you might find email maybe\nthe most effective, or a telephone call.\n\n226\n00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.220\nSo, just kind of realize that\nyou have to deal with that, too.\n\n227\n00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.130\nAnd then, ultimately at least for\nthis guy, right here.\n\n228\n00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.875\nThe idea of also having to\ndeal with language barriers.\n\n229\n00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:55.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n230\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.610\nthere's no doubt that might particular\naccent probably drives some\n\n231\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.230\npeople a little bit more strangely nuts\nthan a lot of people, but I will though.\n\n232\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.740\n&gt;&gt; What accent?\n\n233\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.273\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what accent?\n\n234\n00:11:05.273 --> 00:11:10.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then the thing is,\nguys the tone or the voice level really\n\n235\n00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:16.210\ndoesn't help with communication,\ndoesn't change anything, just FYI.\n\n236\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't matter that you do\nthat, but you got to realize something\n\n237\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.880\nelse too, which is kinda strange\nespecially in terms of language barriers.\n\n238\n00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.600\nOkay, that even though you might know\nhow to say like the greetings right?\n\n239\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.990\nSo, the limitations of\nmy knowledge in Spanish,\n\n240\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.840\npretty much are how to say hello and\ngoodbye.\n\n241\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.250\nSame thing in French, the limitations\nare how to say hello and goodbye but\n\n242\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.850\non projects though, you might say that\nonce during the entire conversation.\n\n243\n00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.450\nThe rest of the time this is usually\nhighly technical information and\n\n244\n00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.020\nall of a sudden when you\nstart asking me about that,\n\n245\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.800\nnow I'm like I don't even\nknow those words, okay?\n\n246\n00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.550\nAnd that's not trying to make light of\nit in the sense of it's not important,\n\n247\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.500\ncuz it's really not, but just trying to\nlet you know that sometimes you do have to\n\n248\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.240\naccount for this,\nthis may require a translator though.\n\n249\n00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.582\n&gt;&gt; No, I really respect.\n\n250\n00:12:06.582 --> 00:12:07.538\nTo be able to do that.\n\n251\n00:12:07.538 --> 00:12:11.230\nI watch a lot of training videos online\nand you see people, especially from\n\n252\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.520\nMicrosoft and all these different vendors\nand all these international speakers and\n\n253\n00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.940\nthey're speaking in English and\njust it's pretty impressive.\n\n254\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.590\n&gt;&gt; It really is when at the same time,\nit's different for a native speaker and\n\n255\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.340\nsomebody that actually speaks\nthe language as a second language, right?\n\n256\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.410\nThat even there, there's some\nkind of unusual differences, or\n\n257\n00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.340\njust some different pronunciations that\ngo on that we're really not sure of.\n\n258\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.228\nSometimes to so you do have to account for\neven language barriers as well.\n\n259\n00:12:39.228 --> 00:12:41.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Especially IT acronyms.\n\n260\n00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, IT acronyms are, because everyone\npronounce acronyms so differently and\n\n261\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.630\nthey do, so\nyou do have to worry about that.\n\n262\n00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.810\nOther types of barriers of\ncourse are functional and\n\n263\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.660\nhierarchical types of\nbarriers out there and\n\n264\n00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.930\nthis can actually come in wreak havoc and\nplay when you start talking\n\n265\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.140\nabout the politics that are actually\ninvolved in certain places versus others.\n\n266\n00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.930\nWhen one particular\nportion of your company\n\n267\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.440\nreally has a political struggle with\nother ones and this is internal power.\n\n268\n00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.490\nWho's the best in this company?\n\n269\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.585\nWho produces more than\nanybody else in this company?\n\n270\n00:13:16.585 --> 00:13:20.110\nIt's very easy for\na companies to get into that type of stuff\n\n271\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.830\nwhere you really have to get pass\nthose types of barriers from within.\n\n272\n00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.900\nTechnological barriers, in terms of\ninfrastructure, training, you name it,\n\n273\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.660\nthere's a ton of those that we\nhave to think about as well.\n\n274\n00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.310\nAnd ultimately, what Cherokee was\nmentioning cross-cultural differences\n\n275\n00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.050\nthat we may not consider and\n\n276\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.660\neven though we might not consider as\nvery important in those cultures.\n\n277\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.630\nSo, there was one that I really\nkinda respected where I saw this on\n\n278\n00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.350\na show on TV called Engineering Marvels or\nsomething like that,\n\n279\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.360\nit's a great show that was on Discovery.\n\n280\n00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.610\nWhere they were building,\nI think it's in Hong Kong,\n\n281\n00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.880\nthey were building a bridge that\nconnected Hong Kong to mainland China and\n\n282\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.830\nwhen they were building this,\nthe team that the company that built it is\n\n283\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:11.480\nan international organization but really\nEnglish speaking and pretty much for\n\n284\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.840\nus, so such either they 're out of\nLondon or they're out of America here.\n\n285\n00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.383\nOkay, but there was a point where\nthey had to stop in was for\n\n286\n00:14:19.383 --> 00:14:22.250\nChinese New Year,\nwhere they just settle up for\n\n287\n00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.400\nceasing all activities for this and\nthey went ahead and did that and\n\n288\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.200\nthat's because everybody that they\nwork with actually did celebrate that.\n\n289\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.610\nSo, instead of the entire\nday being working,\n\n290\n00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.940\nwhat they did is that\nthey had a nice ceremony.\n\n291\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.810\nThe company went ahead and\nmade a nice little ceremony there for\n\n292\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.910\nthe day is celebrating the idea of Chinese\nNew Year and actually helping everybody\n\n293\n00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.710\nfeel comfortable in doing that and you do,\nyou have to respect those types of\n\n294\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.430\ncultural boundaries, especially if you're\nworking in that cross-cultural situation.\n\n295\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.020\nSo, whether it's formal or informal,\n\n296\n00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.370\ndirect, whatever it is,\nit means that you as a project manager,\n\n297\n00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.930\nif you realize that your team's gonna be\ninvolved in that, you do need to respect\n\n298\n00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.610\nthose traditions and those customs\nof the areas that you're going into.\n\n299\n00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.390\nSo, if you don't,\n\n300\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.190\nyou'll find yourself offending [LAUGH]\nmore than you realize like maybe even\n\n301\n00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.980\nan entire culture where now your project's\nnot appreciated any longer and definitely\n\n302\n00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.770\nnot gonna be something that they are going\nto cherish and want you to work with.\n\n303\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.900\nSo, Ronnie with as much cultural\ndiversity as we may have,\n\n304\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.420\nare we going to come across\nany kind of conflicts that may\n\n305\n00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.700\ninteract with those differents\noutlooks and takes on life?\n\n306\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.690\n&gt;&gt; You definitely will,\nespecially when you don't respect them and\n\n307\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.180\nwhen you don't take\nthe time to learn them.\n\n308\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.760\nBut overall though, you're gonna have\nconflicts anyways as you develop a team.\n\n309\n00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.270\nThere's no way that you could have a team\nof people that would come together with\n\n310\n00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:46.820\nall different personalities and background\nin which conflicts are not going to arise.\n\n311\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.545\nSo, the first and foremost then for you as\na project manager you need to have a few\n\n312\n00:15:50.545 --> 00:15:53.157\nskills that will help you to\ndeal with these conflicts,\n\n313\n00:15:53.157 --> 00:15:55.606\nwhether we talk about\ncross-cultural conflicts or\n\n314\n00:15:55.606 --> 00:15:58.973\nwhether we talk about customs and\nwhether we talk about anything else.\n\n315\n00:15:58.973 --> 00:16:02.003\nThat should help you out when this\nactually becomes an issue for\n\n316\n00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.540\nyour team and performance begins to drop.\n\n317\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.550\nSo let's take a look at what\nwe need to do when we start to\n\n318\n00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.580\ntake a look at the idea of conflicts here.\n\n319\n00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.100\nSo I'm gonna move everything over\nto the side so we can take a look.\n\n320\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.790\nFirst and foremost is simple.\n\n321\n00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.800\nYou, as a project manager,\n\n322\n00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.370\nyou need to be able to identify what\nin the world the team conflict is.\n\n323\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.510\nSo what is it that's happening that's\ncausing this particular conflict?\n\n324\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.630\nAnd this can actually be\nmany different things.\n\n325\n00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:32.750\nSo a lot of times when you start to take a\nlook, it could be the very fact that, hey,\n\n326\n00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.620\nthere's a lot of things\nthat end up happening.\n\n327\n00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.640\nFunctional resources become part-time,\nthis can happen where somebody now,\n\n328\n00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.190\neven though they were working full-time,\nthey now go, I've just gotta take a break,\n\n329\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.010\nI'm burnt out.\n\n330\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.070\nI just don't feel like I can do any more.\n\n331\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.548\nWell, now all of a sudden they become\na part-time resource for you instead.\n\n332\n00:16:49.548 --> 00:16:52.963\nAnd even though they still\nactually now work part-time,\n\n333\n00:16:52.963 --> 00:16:55.910\nthey still have their entire job as well.\n\n334\n00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.700\nAnd everything still has actually be done,\neven though they've actually done that.\n\n335\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.800\nSo you might find out, it is something\nlike a competing resource demand.\n\n336\n00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.360\nThe very fact that they just\ndon't wanna do that anymore.\n\n337\n00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.080\nAnd you're just having to talk,\n\n338\n00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.235\ncuz like, we're at the last\nthree weeks of our project.\n\n339\n00:17:09.235 --> 00:17:10.261\n&gt;&gt; You can do it!\n&gt;&gt; You can't quit now.\n\n340\n00:17:10.261 --> 00:17:12.090\nYou can still do it.\n\n341\n00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:15.230\nAnd they're like, I don't really feel\nlike, and what are you willing to do?\n\n342\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.910\nSometimes, you're just\nwilling to negotiate and\n\n343\n00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.570\ngo, please do at least part-time.\n\n344\n00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:23.720\nWell, remember this full time job still\nhas to be done but it's part-time,\n\n345\n00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.380\nso it could be something just\nabout competing resources.\n\n346\n00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.457\nThe other thing of course,\ndiffering expert opinions.\n\n347\n00:17:31.457 --> 00:17:32.580\nWho would think-\n&gt;&gt; There's no way.\n\n348\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no way.\n\n349\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.240\nYeah, it's that feeling of,\nI am not wrong on this.\n\n350\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.000\nWell, now you have both people on\nboth sides saying, I'm not wrong!\n\n351\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.593\n&gt;&gt; It's really great to have\npassionate individuals on a team but,\n\n352\n00:17:44.593 --> 00:17:49.446\nwhen people are so passionate, about their\nideas or beliefs, this is going to happen.\n\n353\n00:17:49.446 --> 00:17:53.619\n&gt;&gt; It really will and so, at this\nbigger point here, that's where you,\n\n354\n00:17:53.619 --> 00:17:57.867\nas the project manager, you've got\nto actually identify whether that\n\n355\n00:17:57.867 --> 00:18:02.735\nexpert judgement is actually about\nthe actual expert judgement itself.\n\n356\n00:18:02.735 --> 00:18:05.950\nWhereas, this guy just doesn't\nlike the answer of the other guy.\n\n357\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.120\nIs he just trying to present\na counteracting argument,\n\n358\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.360\njust to present a counteracting argument?\n\n359\n00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.570\nSo try and figure out is it\nreally about extra judgement.\n\n360\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.480\nIf it is, then you deal with it and\nget which side are you gonna do.\n\n361\n00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.110\nAnd then, finally, one of the things we\ndon't think that it will annoy us but\n\n362\n00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.031\nit can which is the idea\nof varying work styles and\n\n363\n00:18:25.031 --> 00:18:29.830\nI like to break this down to in the 70s\nthere was a TV show called The Odd Couple.\n\n364\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:34.759\nAnd the Odd Couple was really\ntwo guys that lived together\n\n365\n00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:39.173\nin an apartment,\none was the OCD neatness guy, and\n\n366\n00:18:39.173 --> 00:18:45.390\nthat was Felix if I remember right,\nand then the other guy was Oscar.\n\n367\n00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.990\nAnd he was like the guy that\neverything was everywhere.\n\n368\n00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.710\nSo they both ended up living in the same\napartment together where one guy would\n\n369\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.760\ncompletely trash it and\nthe other guy would, of course, clean up.\n\n370\n00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.020\nIt sounds like a perfect mix actually,\nthat's just what you have there right\n\n371\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.480\nthe ability for one guy to be a complete\nmess, the other guy to clean it up.\n\n372\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.500\nThey both get satisfaction\nout of doing that.\n\n373\n00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.590\nBut in working together not so much so.\n\n374\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.900\nSo in this sense you may have\nthat where it really does bug\n\n375\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.160\npeople to that nth degree\nthat it is this way.\n\n376\n00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.600\nAnd now you're talking about\npersonality conflicts.\n\n377\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.280\nIt does sound like a superficial\ntype of thing, but it is reality.\n\n378\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:29.490\nAnd for people it might be the other one,\nthe second example that I have there.\n\n379\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:33.282\nThe early bird versus the one that\nalways late, it doesn't matter.\n\n380\n00:19:33.282 --> 00:19:39.542\nSo I just saw Cherokee's lip curl on\nthat one a little bit there, so [SOUND].\n\n381\n00:19:39.542 --> 00:19:40.812\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ronnie,\n\n382\n00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:43.421\nI didn't know you were gonna\nbe talking about me here.\n\n383\n00:19:43.421 --> 00:19:45.653\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So in that sense,\n\n384\n00:19:45.653 --> 00:19:50.424\nwhen you start seeing some of that,\neven though you might not care, like so\n\n385\n00:19:50.424 --> 00:19:52.870\nthey come in a little bit late.\n\n386\n00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:57.430\nBut for Cherokee, if that's her\nconstant thing that she sees,\n\n387\n00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.890\nit's gonna drive her nuts and\nthat can lead to team conflicts as well.\n\n388\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.770\nSo identifying that is really\ngonna be important in trying to\n\n389\n00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.916\ncurve those specially if she's\nworking on a key component as a point.\n\n390\n00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.340\nAnd that guys is-\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have to think.\n\n391\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.670\nYou might be working long hours,\nyou're seeing these people all the time.\n\n392\n00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.840\nSometimes even more than\nyour actual family members.\n\n393\n00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.190\nSo these little annoyances may actually\nadd up if you don't address them.\n\n394\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.560\n&gt;&gt; Add up is not the word.\n\n395\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They end up growing.\n\n396\n00:20:23.075 --> 00:20:27.250\n[LAUGH] This is not just\nmoving a pebble over.\n\n397\n00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.418\nIt's like moving a pebble over with sand,\nand dirt, and\n\n398\n00:20:29.418 --> 00:20:30.245\nthen it growing-\n&gt;&gt; A bulldozer.\n\n399\n00:20:30.245 --> 00:20:33.920\n&gt;&gt; A whole new,\nit really grows, incredibly.\n\n400\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.320\nSo what are some of\nthe things that we can do?\n\n401\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.550\nWell, we actually have to learn some\nconflict resolution techniques.\n\n402\n00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:45.160\nNow, I am by no means a conflict\nresolution expert to the nth degree.\n\n403\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.095\n&gt;&gt; Nor am I.\n\n404\n00:20:46.095 --> 00:20:48.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there are some tools and\n\n405\n00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.250\ntechniques that everybody,\nas a project manager that we can try and\n\n406\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.960\nat least hang on to.\n\n407\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.060\nAs we're experiencing these conflicts.\n\n408\n00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.600\nFirst and foremost,\nremember it's not about you.\n\n409\n00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.520\nI know that it sounds weird, but\njust don't take it personally.\n\n410\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.160\nIt's not about you.\n\n411\n00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.500\nSo one of the things we can\ntry is the idea of smoothing.\n\n412\n00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.950\nEmphasize areas of agreement,\nminimize focus on disagreements.\n\n413\n00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.130\nSo even though we can actually do this,\n\n414\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.440\nthe problem that you have is you actually\ntried to minimize a real problem.\n\n415\n00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.300\nSo if this is a real conflict\nthat's not superficial,\n\n416\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.740\nand it's a real problem,\nthen you've just minimized it.\n\n417\n00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.050\nAnd in the eyes of the person that\nhas a conflict with that, guess what?\n\n418\n00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.750\nYou've minimized them.\n\n419\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.260\nYou have now disrespected them, and\n\n420\n00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.930\nyou've gotta actually kind of think\nabout what ends up happening.\n\n421\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.200\nSo when that happens,\n\n422\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.160\nthere's only one particular technique\nthat we call in conflict resolution here.\n\n423\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.680\nWhat ends up happening is a situation and\nresult that we call lose-lose.\n\n424\n00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Both sides losing.\n\n425\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.880\nSo in that sense, you end up maybe where\nCherokee says, I'm not taking anymore,\n\n426\n00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.530\nshe loses.\n\n427\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.305\nShe's gone,\nyou now have a missing teammate.\n\n428\n00:21:54.305 --> 00:21:56.350\n[LAUGH] And you have to fill that gap.\n\n429\n00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.770\nAnd you lose too.\n\n430\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.430\nSo smoothing even though it's possible\n\n431\n00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.630\nprobably not the best\neffort that we can put in.\n\n432\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.384\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ronnie, so what you're saying is\nthat we really shouldn't trivialize any\n\n433\n00:22:06.384 --> 00:22:08.218\nconcerns that are brought to the table.\n\n434\n00:22:08.218 --> 00:22:08.889\nLegitimate concerns.\n\n435\n00:22:08.889 --> 00:22:09.721\n&gt;&gt; Legitimate concerns.\n\n436\n00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:12.807\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I know this sounds weird but,\n\n437\n00:22:12.807 --> 00:22:19.305\nI hate to say it, I think you need to\ntrivialize very superficial concerns,\n\n438\n00:22:19.305 --> 00:22:25.926\nlike I can't believe he parked on this\nside, he parked too close to the line.\n\n439\n00:22:25.926 --> 00:22:30.607\nNow, if you have a brand new car,\nI understand, but if he parks too\n\n440\n00:22:30.607 --> 00:22:34.470\nclose to the line, it really is-\n&gt;&gt; You have the right to park elsewhere.\n\n441\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.940\n&gt;&gt; You have the right\nto park elsewhere and\n\n442\n00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.780\nhe's in his boundary,\nthat's what I would say.\n\n443\n00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.410\nHe still is in his boundary here, but\n\n444\n00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:47.070\noverall though the problem is what is that\nwe do end up minimalizing a real problem.\n\n445\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:51.360\nSo smoothing,\nit solves an immediate field problem.\n\n446\n00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.720\nBut it can cause another problem\nwhich is that lose lose.\n\n447\n00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.480\nNobody ever really wins once you actually\nstart the idea here of smoothing\n\n448\n00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.480\nas being your way of\ndealing with conflict.\n\n449\n00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.400\nSo handle real problems,\nbut yeah, if you can,\n\n450\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.500\nespecially something\nsuperficial it'd work.\n\n451\n00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.330\nIf it's something real,\nsmoothing just is not the way to go.\n\n452\n00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n453\n00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Now, the other one that we have,\nof course, is the idea of forcing.\n\n454\n00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.580\nThis is what I call the dad\nresolution more than any place else.\n\n455\n00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.940\nSo when we start to take\na look at this idea,\n\n456\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.240\nit's not necessarily the best\ndecision that ends up happening.\n\n457\n00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.170\nBecause I know as a Dad according to my\nwife and daughter, I never make the best\n\n458\n00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:34.390\ndecision on this things, but\nit is a decision that has to be made.\n\n459\n00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.008\nSo what I do is I simply say,\nhere's the way it's gonna be.\n\n460\n00:23:37.008 --> 00:23:39.335\nAnd that's what ends up happening, and\n\n461\n00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:42.620\nI can say that I don't care\nif you agree with it or not.\n\n462\n00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.480\nDoes it sound like Dad?\n\n463\n00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.710\nIs that me or what?\n\n464\n00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.830\nSo my daughter will go, yeah, that's Dad.\n\n465\n00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:54.488\nBut sometimes when you do this,\nyou end up in a win-lose result instead.\n\n466\n00:23:54.488 --> 00:23:58.724\nNow, a win-lose sounds good, because\nusually in conflict you want a winner.\n\n467\n00:23:58.724 --> 00:24:02.100\nAnd you don't normally want a loser.\n\n468\n00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:08.720\nBut overall though the real result, at\nleast to the people that are involved Is\n\n469\n00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:14.580\nnot that they really won on the merits of\nanything, is that you picked the winner.\n\n470\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.360\nSo in other words,\nyou didn't really listen to anybody.\n\n471\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.700\nYou just kind of arbitrarily\ndecided who's gonna win this.\n\n472\n00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.000\nAnd nobody likes that feeling.\n\n473\n00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.008\nIf you don't believe me, watch any of the\ncontests that are actually on TV, well,\n\n474\n00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:30.695\nthey're just like Dancing with the Stars-\n&gt;&gt; Good Times.\n\n475\n00:24:30.695 --> 00:24:33.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the American Idol-\n&gt;&gt; Cooking competition.\n\n476\n00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.290\n&gt;&gt; Cooking competitions, boxing matches,\n\n477\n00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:41.020\neverybody feels cheated when somebody else\npicks the winner instead of you going man,\n\n478\n00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.270\nthis is what they really did,\nthey deserve this a little bit more.\n\n479\n00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.080\nSo yes,\n\n480\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.280\nusually in this type of situation it does\nresolve with one person feeling great.\n\n481\n00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.690\nThe other person feeling cheated.\n\n482\n00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.087\nAnd when is that ever a good feeling,\nCherokee?\n\n483\n00:24:54.087 --> 00:24:55.000\nNever, right?\n\n484\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.500\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n485\n00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.760\n&gt;&gt; So in this sense you do\nsee where you can do that.\n\n486\n00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.041\nSo with smoothing and\n\n487\n00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:05.033\nforcing these are at least two of\nthe actual methods that we can do.\n\n488\n00:25:05.033 --> 00:25:07.595\nBut not necessarily\nthe best method as well.\n\n489\n00:25:07.595 --> 00:25:11.152\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that just about does it\nfor this episode but you guys can put your\n\n490\n00:25:11.152 --> 00:25:14.850\nboxing gloves away because we have more\nconflict resolution heading your way.\n\n491\n00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.640\nSo stay tuned for that,\nthank you for being here today and\n\n492\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.650\nthank you, Ronnie, for joining us.\n\n493\n00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:21.523\nI'm Cherokee Boost\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.214\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:12.023\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.023 --> 00:00:15.126\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:19.073\nIn this episode, we're going to be looking\nat Project Plus, CompTIA's Project Plus,\n\n7\n00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:22.690\nwe're going to be looking at\nexplaining resource management.\n\n8\n00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.700\nIn the last couple of episodes, we've been\nlooking at this topic, but last episode,\n\n9\n00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.590\nwe looked at personnel management and\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n10\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.800\ncontinue with some of those concepts,\nbut really specifically,\n\n11\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.470\nlooking at conflict management.\n\n12\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.920\nSo with us, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.300\nThank you Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.370\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue on with\n\n15\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.770\ntaking a look at conflict resolution tools\nthat we can use as project managers.\n\n16\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.680\nNow remember that this doesn't mean\nthat you're gonna be an expert\n\n17\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.300\nat conflict resolution simply by\nwatching the previous show and\n\n18\n00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.980\nthis show, but at least as a project\nmanager, hopefully, these will give you\n\n19\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.080\nsome of the ways that you actually\nunderstand how conflict happens and\n\n20\n00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.104\nhow you can deal with them as\na project manager as well.\n\n21\n00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:08.920\nSo they're eventually tools that we\ncan use as we start to see this.\n\n22\n00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.600\nSo previously, let's go and\ntake a look at my screen here and\n\n23\n00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.360\nthat will help us out in\nterms of reviewing as well.\n\n24\n00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.380\nSo when we start taking a look\nat some of the techniques,\n\n25\n00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.930\nwe've talked about the idea of smoothing.\n\n26\n00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.970\n&gt;&gt; And forcing.\n\n27\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.230\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and forcing.\n\n28\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.290\nSo when we start taking a look at those\ntwo, remember that those end up giving us\n\n29\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.150\na potential type of resolution,\nwhere in smoothing it's a lose-lose.\n\n30\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.040\nNobody really feels like anything was\nreally accomplished at that particular\n\n31\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.280\npoint, and we end up minimizing\nwhat a real problem we have.\n\n32\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.220\nAnd then forcing,\nwe essentially pick the winner.\n\n33\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.710\nAnd so there's a winner, and\nthat means that by the very other fact,\n\n34\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.820\nis that somebody ends up also\npicking the loser, which is you,\n\n35\n00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.780\nyou're also gonna pick the loser as well.\n\n36\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.020\nSo we need to move on and we need to\ntalk about the idea that's probably most\n\n37\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.700\nappealing to the majority of us,\nwhich is the idea of compromise, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.620\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of compromise here,\n\n39\n00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.380\none of the key aspects\nof compromise is simple.\n\n40\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.170\nBoth sides essentially let go of\nsomething that they're hanging on to.\n\n41\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nif you're in a relationship, or married,\n\n42\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.585\nthen you know exactly what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n43\n00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:18.685\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's cherokee@itpro.tv.\n\n44\n00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:22.960\n[LAUGH] No, no the very fact is,\nyes, there's no doubt about that.\n\n45\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.630\nHere parties are involved to\n\n46\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.105\ngive up something to reach\na resolution of some sort.\n\n47\n00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:31.164\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, Cherokee went that way.\n\n48\n00:02:31.164 --> 00:02:32.917\nYes, that actually did happen here.\n\n49\n00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:36.150\nBut overall though, yes-\n&gt;&gt; You know that they're thinking it.\n\n50\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.140\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that there\nis compromise in marriage and\n\n51\n00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.500\nsome of these things, but\nhopefully, not in everything.\n\n52\n00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.032\nBut here we do, both sides of whatever\nthey are on, on the conflict,\n\n53\n00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:50.656\nright, they give up something for\nthe sake of reaching a resolution.\n\n54\n00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:52.695\nNow when you start to see this though,\n\n55\n00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:57.156\nyou also have to then ensure if they're\nwilling to give that up, that they're also\n\n56\n00:02:57.156 --> 00:03:01.590\nsaying that they are committed to\nwhatever resolution it's going to be.\n\n57\n00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.670\nAnd that's where it becomes a little bit\nharder, because, as much as both sides say\n\n58\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.530\nthat they're willing to give up something\nto come to a resolution, it usually is\n\n59\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.240\na very negotiated type of piece that\nyou have, or a resolution that's there.\n\n60\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.580\nAnd if anybody happens to violate\nthat compromise at any point,\n\n61\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.952\neven in the smallest iota,\nand the very smallest bit of\n\n62\n00:03:25.952 --> 00:03:30.540\nthat compromise,\nsomebody is now calling for blog.\n\n63\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.820\nNow I know that in that sense\nI'm over dramatizing it a bit,\n\n64\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.830\nbut somebody is normally calling for\nsomething else to happen to step in and\n\n65\n00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.330\neverything else has to\nbe the way that it is.\n\n66\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.088\nSo in that sense, they have to\nbe committed to the resolution.\n\n67\n00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:51.115\nCompromise takes a long time because\nnobody's willing first of all,\n\n68\n00:03:51.115 --> 00:03:52.354\nto give up anything.\n\n69\n00:03:52.354 --> 00:03:56.489\nAnd then once you convince them that they\nhave to give that up for this to actually\n\n70\n00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.435\nhappen, well, that means that they\nare willing to agree to it, even if they\n\n71\n00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:05.130\ndon't like it, which is when you really\nend up with something that you don't want.\n\n72\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.490\nThat nobody feels like that\nthey've won anything, but\n\n73\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.055\nnobody really fells that they've lost\nanything super important because normally,\n\n74\n00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:17.070\nthey only are willing to sacrifice\nthe smallest bit that they can.\n\n75\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.230\nAnd so, you also end up with the very\nfact that there's not gonna be a buy\n\n76\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.320\nin to the resolution, which means it is\na negotiated type of peace that you have.\n\n77\n00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.150\nAnd because of that, it's exactly\nlike I said here, the potential for\n\n78\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.970\nconflicts to happen over and over again\nabout the same issue is going to happen.\n\n79\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.250\nAnd that is because all it takes is\none side to tip the balance there,\n\n80\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.460\nto not meet the idea of compromise and\nthe other person say,\n\n81\n00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.910\nyou know, we agreed on this compromise,\nbut you're still doing the same things.\n\n82\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.580\nAnd the other person just has to say\nno I'm not, they could say yes you are,\n\n83\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.440\nand there it is, you have to renegotiate\nthe idea of that type of resolution.\n\n84\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.840\nSo in that sense, compromise, even though\nit might sound like a great idea, okay,\n\n85\n00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.532\neven though you actually do work through\nsituations where you might find yourself,\n\n86\n00:05:09.532 --> 00:05:13.010\neven though that is the best\npeace that you can have,\n\n87\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.480\nyou also have to be ready\nthen as a project manager,\n\n88\n00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.152\nexcuse me, to deal with it over and\nover again, if it does arise, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:21.152 --> 00:05:24.790\nAll right, now there are of course, some\n\n90\n00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.680\nother ones that we can also take a look\nat, too and so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n91\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.160\nNow, I'm really confronting here for,\njust for the last because that's probably\n\n92\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.030\nthe best one that we have, I know it\nsounds strange, but it really isn't.\n\n93\n00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.480\nSo I'm going to leave that one for\nthe best.\n\n94\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.970\nLet's talk about the other two here too,\nokay?\n\n95\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.970\nSo let's talk about the idea of avoiding,\nokay?\n\n96\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.880\nNow avoidance is never actually\na conflict resolution at all.\n\n97\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.650\nIt is simply for us here,\nno resolution is ever going to be reached.\n\n98\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.850\nOne side essentially stops negotiating,\nstops discussing the conflict at all, and\n\n99\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.420\nwhen that happens, it means you're not\ngonna come to any type of agreement,\n\n100\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.890\nthat a resolution can even occur.\n\n101\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.090\nSo in this, nobody's actually\ndealing with the issue, okay?\n\n102\n00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.790\n&gt;&gt; Let's just act like an ostrich,\nstick our head in the sand, and\n\n103\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.300\npretend there's not even a problem.\n\n104\n00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and look, I don't think they\npretend like there's not a problem,\n\n105\n00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.150\nthey just refuse to say that there's\na problem, even though there is, okay?\n\n106\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.690\nSo it doesn't seem like they\nkinda just go on with life.\n\n107\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.080\nWhat they do is simply say,\nI don't want to talked about it, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.760\nSo at that point you know what, you know\nthat they really do want to talk about it,\n\n109\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.970\nbut it's just not with you nor\nwith anybody that ask them.\n\n110\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.470\nThey really want to talk\nabout it with somebody that\n\n111\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.640\nis going to essentially\ntake their side and\n\n112\n00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.800\nthat's pretty much it when you talk\nabout the ideas of avoidance here.\n\n113\n00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.270\nNow, can this actually work?\n\n114\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.900\nBelieve it or not, it actually can work.\n\n115\n00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.900\nIf your project is close to the end,\nI'm not saying that this is what you\n\n116\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.230\nshould do, if your project is close to\nthe end of the time that you know your\n\n117\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.010\nproject is starting to wrap up,\nthen avoidance can work in a very\n\n118\n00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.840\nuneasy type of peace that you have,\nbut it doesn't really help, okay.\n\n119\n00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.860\nYou end up getting people that\nare now dissatisfied with the work\n\n120\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.260\nthat you're doing as well as whoever\nthey're having that conflict with as well.\n\n121\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.300\nSo it's always better to\ndo something else, okay,\n\n122\n00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.130\nanything else is always better.\n\n123\n00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.280\nThen we also have of course,\nnegotiation, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.420\nNow whenever we start to\ntalk about negotiating,\n\n125\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.220\nthis is where it becomes a little\nbit more arbitrary, and the very\n\n126\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.480\nfact that they now actually involved\na third party to help everybody come in to\n\n127\n00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.980\nagreement and in this sense, this is\nwhere collective bargaining comes in.\n\n128\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.275\nNow the problem that we have\nwith negotiations is simple.\n\n129\n00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:49.837\nUnlike the idea of compromise where you\ngive up both sides, usually what ends up\n\n130\n00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:53.720\nhappening in an arbitration type\nof setting with negotiating using\n\n131\n00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.090\na third party, they actually are kind\nof King Solomon at this point.\n\n132\n00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.825\nThey willingly split the baby To see and\nsay this should make both sides happy.\n\n133\n00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:05.515\nYou're not winning anything\nover the other side, so\n\n134\n00:08:05.515 --> 00:08:07.510\nI'm giving you all both something.\n\n135\n00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.050\nYou should be satisfied with what you get.\n\n136\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.280\nSo in this sense, you're not gonna\nactually gain the upper hand, but\n\n137\n00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.410\nyou're not gonna be satisfied with\nwhatever answer you get, as well.\n\n138\n00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:21.030\nNow, in negotiation in terms of conflict,\nokay, negotiation in terms of getting\n\n139\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.180\nthe best deal that you possibly can,\nthat's always something you should do.\n\n140\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.350\nYou should never just settle for\n\n141\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.550\nthe very fact that they say\nhere's what it's going to be.\n\n142\n00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.600\nAnd then you find out that this\nis what everybody would tell you.\n\n143\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.704\nBut overall, though, in a conflict,\nthough, negotiation,\n\n144\n00:08:33.704 --> 00:08:37.310\neven though it sounds like,\nyes, that's what we should do.\n\n145\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.630\nNegotiations, again,\ndo ride like compromises.\n\n146\n00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.640\nNobody really wins because\nall you get is a piece\n\n147\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.630\nof what you thought you were going to get.\n\n148\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.840\nAnd then you are not happy\nwith that resolution, as well.\n\n149\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.768\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I don't know what\nthe phrase about the baby,\n\n150\n00:08:50.768 --> 00:08:53.517\nI don't know what you're\ndoing to the baby there.\n\n151\n00:08:53.517 --> 00:08:57.245\nBut would that be similar [LAUGH] to\na mediation from a legal standpoint?\n\n152\n00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.089\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what it would be.\n\n153\n00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:01.685\nYeah, so the story of King Solomon.\n\n154\n00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:06.730\nA baby ends up, two people claim the baby.\n\n155\n00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.750\nAnd King Solomon doesn't how to decide,\nso he says, here's what I'll do,\n\n156\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.832\nI'll split the baby in half.\n\n157\n00:09:10.832 --> 00:09:13.630\nAnd when one of the mothers says,\ngo ahead,\n\n158\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.860\ndo it, that's perfectly fine with me.\n\n159\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.560\nAnd the other one says, no,\ngive it to the other one.\n\n160\n00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.170\n&gt;&gt; I do remember that, yeah.\n\n161\n00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of a neat story, right.\n\n162\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.450\nSo when you start seeing that,\nright, and so\n\n163\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.830\nthat solution in that sense wasn't\nreally about trying to negotiate,\n\n164\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.675\nit was trying to see who really was-\n&gt;&gt; Who the real mother really was, yes.\n\n165\n00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:32.690\n&gt;&gt; But, at the same time,\nthough, in real negotiations and\n\n166\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.930\nmediations, mediations is\nabout splitting the baby.\n\n167\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.800\nIt really is, it's about just saying\nhere is the best solution we are gonna\n\n168\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800\ncome up with,\n\n169\n00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.175\nwhich is something better than what you're\never going to be willing to admit to.\n\n170\n00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:47.740\nBut since you're actually here and\nwe're binding this, you're going\n\n171\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.110\nto have to go ahead and deal with it,\nthe very fact of whatever I choose.\n\n172\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.800\nAnd so\nthat normally doesn't make anybody happy.\n\n173\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.482\nSo whether we're talking, what were\nwe talking about here, compromise,\n\n174\n00:09:59.482 --> 00:10:05.720\navoiding and negotiating, usually we\nhave an easy resolution at the end.\n\n175\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.230\nThe resolution is either temporary,\nokay, or the resolution is\n\n176\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.440\nnot really a resolution, you're just kinda\nsettling for whatever your getting, okay.\n\n177\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.490\nOr you're not really resolving anything.\n\n178\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:22.740\nSo there has to be one resolution\ntechnique that all of us really hate,\n\n179\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.270\nokay, all of us really don't want to do,\nokay.\n\n180\n00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:31.180\nSome of us are insanely good at it and\nsome of us are insanely bad at it.\n\n181\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.280\nBut it is the most effective\none that we can do, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.008\nAnd this one is the only one that's left,\nand that is confrontation.\n\n183\n00:10:38.008 --> 00:10:40.969\nSo, Cherokee, confrontation.\n\n184\n00:10:40.969 --> 00:10:41.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n185\n00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:43.560\n&gt;&gt; Are you good at confronting people?\n\n186\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.440\nI am not.\n\n187\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.659\n&gt;&gt; I guess it depends on who you ask.\n\n188\n00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:47.423\n&gt;&gt; There, yeah.\n\n189\n00:10:47.423 --> 00:10:48.377\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n190\n00:10:48.377 --> 00:10:50.338\nlet's not say me at this\nparticular point here.\n\n191\n00:10:50.338 --> 00:10:54.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and say something else.\n\n192\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.500\nBut confrontation is addressing the issue,\nokay?\n\n193\n00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.520\nIt is actually saying that\nproblem solving is the key, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.824\nSo it's not saying that, hey,\nwe need to push this aside.\n\n195\n00:11:06.824 --> 00:11:12.079\nIs not saying we've got to figure\nout how just to get along and live.\n\n196\n00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:13.344\nWe're saying it's what?\n\n197\n00:11:13.344 --> 00:11:18.330\nLet's find what the issue is and\nresolve it, okay.\n\n198\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.780\nThe point on confrontation, though, okay,\nespecially if you're the one having to\n\n199\n00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:28.080\nbring this up, is that you now have\nto go on a fact-finding mission and\n\n200\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.540\nfigure out what is underlying\nthe conflict, itself.\n\n201\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.840\nAnd that's why this is so effective.\n\n202\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.950\nNow, the idea of confrontation for\n\n203\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.610\nthe sake of being confrontational\nis never good, okay.\n\n204\n00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:40.770\nAnd I mean it.\n\n205\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.510\nThere are some people whose personalities\nthey go, no, I love confrontation,\n\n206\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.290\nI'll do it any time I have a chance.\n\n207\n00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.489\nThat's not what we're talking about,\nright.\n\n208\n00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:51.247\nWe're talking about the idea of\nactually confronting the actual problem\n\n209\n00:11:51.247 --> 00:11:52.490\nthat we have.\n\n210\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.940\nAnd then we take a look at all the facts,\nand we try and find what those facts are,\n\n211\n00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.990\nand then we present those facts to both\nsides, okay, that are actually involved.\n\n212\n00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.758\nAnd we also make sure that the decisions\nthat we make from that fact-finding\n\n213\n00:12:06.758 --> 00:12:10.564\nmission are clear and\nunderstandable to both sides, okay.\n\n214\n00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:17.032\nAt that point, we all win because they see\nexactly what the conflict actually is.\n\n215\n00:12:17.032 --> 00:12:18.569\nAnd then when they do so,\n\n216\n00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:22.467\nthey know why the decisions were\nmade in the way that they were.\n\n217\n00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:25.230\nThey might not like your decision, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.823\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n219\n00:12:25.823 --> 00:12:27.820\n&gt;&gt; But they understand it, okay?\n\n220\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.460\nThey might agree 100% with your decision,\nokay.\n\n221\n00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.300\nAnd they might go ahead and say, yeah,\nthat's the best decision that was made.\n\n222\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.550\nBut you didn't win it\nbased on your personality.\n\n223\n00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.680\nYou didn't win it based on you whining or\ncomplaining about it.\n\n224\n00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.340\nBut it was because it was the right\ndecision to be made, okay.\n\n225\n00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.860\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like sometimes you\nhave to agree to disagree, right?\n\n226\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.130\nYou see two different perspectives,\nyou acknowledge them,\n\n227\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.060\nyou respect them and you move on.\n\n228\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and when you start seeing this,\nright, so in this sense,\n\n229\n00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.450\nthen, if you are a project manager and\nyou find yourself and\n\n230\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.250\nsay, I'm not really good at confrontation.\n\n231\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.112\nI'm not saying go and get in somebody's\nface right now and yell at them, okay.\n\n232\n00:13:06.112 --> 00:13:07.005\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I'm saying.\n\n233\n00:13:07.005 --> 00:13:07.725\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n234\n00:13:07.725 --> 00:13:12.059\n&gt;&gt; But what I am saying, though,\nis take a look and maybe go and\n\n235\n00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:17.089\npick up some different books on\nthe idea of resolving conflicts, and\n\n236\n00:13:17.089 --> 00:13:22.834\nusually the idea of how to confront or\naddress problem issues that come about.\n\n237\n00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:27.360\nAnd they will help you out at least\nin getting your mindset ready for it.\n\n238\n00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.200\nMost of us don't like confrontation.\n\n239\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.976\nAnd a lot of us don't like it because,\nit really does, it sounds like that we\n\n240\n00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:36.868\nare berating somebody, when really the\nidea of confrontation is not to do that.\n\n241\n00:13:36.868 --> 00:13:41.140\nIt's to actually find what the problem is,\nand address the issue, and\n\n242\n00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.760\nmake sure that everybody understands\nwhat the issues actually are and\n\n243\n00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.120\nwhy the division has been\nmade the way it has been.\n\n244\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.030\nHey, if not, you essentially end\nup with misunderstanding, and\n\n245\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.117\nthe confrontation now becomes more about\npersonality than it does about the issues.\n\n246\n00:13:56.117 --> 00:14:01.310\nSo there is a right way\nto do confrontation, and\n\n247\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.770\nthat means there's also\na wrong way to do it.\n\n248\n00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.170\nAnd your goal as a project manager,\nespecially as projects move on,\n\n249\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.610\nis to make sure that you are good\nat doing it the right way.\n\n250\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.500\nSo do try and pick up some\nadditional help in that sense of it.\n\n251\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.590\nAnd there's probably complete courses that\nyou can take that really will help you.\n\n252\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.550\nSome of us, in our own personalities,\nwere a little bit more demure than others.\n\n253\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.380\nSome of us are very much vocal and\nconfrontational.\n\n254\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.557\nAnd, again, it's not that you\ncan't use that to your advantage,\n\n255\n00:14:28.557 --> 00:14:30.697\nbut just realize that\nthat's not your goal.\n\n256\n00:14:30.697 --> 00:14:33.721\nIt is to ensure that everybody\nknows where your position is.\n\n257\n00:14:33.721 --> 00:14:35.819\nBut that's not the key\nbehind confrontation,\n\n258\n00:14:35.819 --> 00:14:39.040\nthe key behind confrontation,\nagain, is solving the issue.\n\n259\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.050\nAnd this is why it is the best\npossible resolution technique.\n\n260\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.240\nThe other one's we learn naturally.\n\n261\n00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.210\nI hate to say it, but\nwe avoid naturally, okay.\n\n262\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.430\n&gt;&gt; That's easy.\n&gt;&gt; We tend to try and\n\n263\n00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.260\ncompromise naturally and\nnegotiate naturally.\n\n264\n00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.550\nKids learn how to negotiate by themselves,\nso they own that.\n\n265\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.850\nAnd it is easier overall.\n\n266\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.930\nConfrontation takes real\nstrong will to say,\n\n267\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.480\nI'm gonna figure out what's wrong with\nthis, and then let's go ahead and\n\n268\n00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.580\naddress it together and\nfigure out what it is.\n\n269\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.840\nBoth sides end up winning.\n\n270\n00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.700\nSo if you wanna talk about the win-win\ntype of resolution technique,\n\n271\n00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.830\nconfrontation is the only\none that is a win-win.\n\n272\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.180\nWhereas, all of the other ones,\nit's either kind of a lose-lose,\n\n273\n00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:22.580\na win-lose situation, or nobody's happy\ntype of situation that you end up with.\n\n274\n00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.410\nBut in terms of conflict resolution,\nthese are kind of the basic\n\n275\n00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.110\nways that you'll have to deal with\nthem as they do arise in your project.\n\n276\n00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:40.230\nOkay, all right, so that actually\nbrings us then to our last particular\n\n277\n00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:45.632\npoint here that we need to talk about,\njust briefly, which is when nothing works.\n\n278\n00:15:45.632 --> 00:15:46.145\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n279\n00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:47.005\n&gt;&gt; I hate to say it,\n\n280\n00:15:47.005 --> 00:15:49.962\nbut that's our last point here.\nWhat do we do at that point, Ronnie?\n\n281\n00:15:49.962 --> 00:15:50.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n282\n00:15:50.475 --> 00:15:53.893\nwhen nothing works in\nterms of team disputes and\n\n283\n00:15:53.893 --> 00:15:59.363\neverything else that happens, okay,\nthat is when you do have to go above and\n\n284\n00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:04.234\nbeyond and talk about The idea of\npersonnel types of replacements or\n\n285\n00:16:04.234 --> 00:16:08.170\nremovals.\nNow, that's exactly like it sounds like.\n\n286\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.910\nYou're fired,\nthat's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n287\n00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.680\nOr you definitely are not\nworking well with our team,\n\n288\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.230\nwe need to do something else with you.\n\n289\n00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:21.160\nIn that sense,\nwhat is it that you actually have to do?\n\n290\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.900\nThere's going to be team members that end\nup having, hopefully not on every single\n\n291\n00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.890\nproject, but there will be times where you\nhave to actually address that team member.\n\n292\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.150\nThat no matter what you have tried to do,\n\n293\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.540\nwhether you've tried to\nconfront the problem,\n\n294\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.900\nwhether you tried to negotiate the peace,\nwhatever it is, it doesn't work.\n\n295\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.650\nThis is when you have to go ahead and\ntake a look at it a little bit harder and\n\n296\n00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.510\ntalk about the fact of whether or\n\n297\n00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.390\nnot this particular individual needs\nto be removed or and or to be replaced.\n\n298\n00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.340\nThat is what we need to do.\n\n299\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.840\nIn that sense, when you end up\ndealing with several things here.\n\n300\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.080\nLet's go ahead and talk about this,\n\n301\n00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.890\nwhen you actually have to consider\nthe ideas of replacement of some sort.\n\n302\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.960\nOn my screen, I went ahead and\nmade a small list here to help us out.\n\n303\n00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:11.020\nSo if you're just dealing with team\nmember disputes, that's perfectly fine.\n\n304\n00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.050\nRemember that in terms of conflict,\nfact determination and\n\n305\n00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:19.135\nmeetings, usually you involve\neverybody as much as possible and\n\n306\n00:17:19.135 --> 00:17:24.340\nsay here it is, this is just a team member\ndispute, you should be able to solve this.\n\n307\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:31.140\nNow if it doesn't work, then at that\npoint, notice that the situation\n\n308\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.520\ncan end up devolving and what we\nmean by that is it can disintegrate.\n\n309\n00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.120\nIt can really quickly\nbecome disastrous for\n\n310\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.980\nyour entire team if you are not careful.\n\n311\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.840\nIf it then ends up to the point where\nnow it's actually personal issues that\n\n312\n00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.930\nare related, here, the very fact that it\nsays, hey, this is now getting personal,\n\n313\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.410\nwhere we're calling each other names.\n\n314\n00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:53.640\nWhere we're angry.\n\n315\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, you don't want that negative\nenergy to infect your entire team.\n\n316\n00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you really can't\nafford to have that happen.\n\n317\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.920\nThen at that point, you have to involve HR\nas well and so you may have to do that.\n\n318\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.470\nAnd then you have to be willing to stand\nby the policy and not deviate from it once\n\n319\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.980\nit happens because if not, you might\nfind yourself in a legal quandary.\n\n320\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.690\nNow the best situation and\n\n321\n00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:21.050\nthe best example of this that I can tell\nyou which is something that's very neat.\n\n322\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.120\nI had a friend of mine that actually\nworked on an oil rig in the Gulf,\n\n323\n00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.180\nway back in the 80s here.\n\n324\n00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.260\nHe worked on an oil rig and one of the\nthings he told which was amazing to me,\n\n325\n00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.450\nI never knew this, he said, it's fine\nwhen people are working together and\n\n326\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.430\neven if they break out in fights,\nit's perfectly fine.\n\n327\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.130\nBut if there comes a point when two\npeople really don't like each other and\n\n328\n00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.370\nthey can't stand each other-\n&gt;&gt; There's no where to go.\n\n329\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.915\n&gt;&gt; There's no where to go.\n\n330\n00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:47.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the problem is this,\n\n331\n00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.572\nis that on that particular thing,\non that idea of working on an oil rig,\n\n332\n00:18:51.572 --> 00:18:55.790\nno where to go, it essentially ends\nup infecting the rest of the crew.\n\n333\n00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:56.650\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n334\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.410\n&gt;&gt; They end up getting so\nbent out of shape.\n\n335\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.140\nOne of the policies in\nhis company was simple.\n\n336\n00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.030\nTwo people get into that type of a fight\nwhere they know it's not gonna be\n\n337\n00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.900\nresolved, they immediately separate\nthem into two different rooms and\n\n338\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:16.440\nthey do not allow them to essentially\ntalk to anybody, nor see anybody.\n\n339\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.650\nSecond step is that whoever\nthe foreman is calls the company, and\n\n340\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:26.220\nthey immediately send out a helicopter for\nthose two people.\n\n341\n00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.950\nThey're going to get them off\nof the rig as soon as possible.\n\n342\n00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.430\nThey do not want the attitude\ninfecting the rest of the team.\n\n343\n00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.910\nIt doesn't matter if it's in\nthe middle of the night or\n\n344\n00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.030\nif it's during the middle of the work day.\n\n345\n00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.970\nif they have something like that break\nout, they immediately separate them and\n\n346\n00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.650\nthey immediately get them off that rig so\nthat work can continue on.\n\n347\n00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.190\nAnd that that particular conflict\nthen is handled somewhere else,\n\n348\n00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:56.190\ninstead of right there on-board because\nthey just can't have the time to stop and\n\n349\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.480\ndo all that while the rest\nof the team needs to work.\n\n350\n00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.630\nYou might even have a situation like\nthat and that is just HR policy for\n\n351\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.580\nthat particular company back in the 80s.\n\n352\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.210\n&gt;&gt; We even have one here at IT PRO TV.\n\n353\n00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We have a no-drama policy, I love it.\n\n354\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.579\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n355\n00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.120\nHopefully, what we have here with that\nno-drama policy, and that is if we do\n\n356\n00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.220\ncreate that, if we do have a time-out type\nof situation that we have to worry about.\n\n357\n00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.940\n&gt;&gt; I don't think we get helicopter rides,\nthough, do we?\n\n358\n00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.610\n&gt;&gt; Not easily.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n359\n00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, not easily.\n\n360\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.640\nBut overall, though,\nthat's what may have to happen.\n\n361\n00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.570\nWhat are some of the results then,\nif you do have to do this?\n\n362\n00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.370\nWell, it could be that the person\ndoesn't get outright terminated,\n\n363\n00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.270\nit may be where they\nhave to go to training.\n\n364\n00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.840\nMaybe anger management,\nit may be something else, it's possible.\n\n365\n00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.082\nThey may face some other\ntype of disciplinary action.\n\n366\n00:20:45.082 --> 00:20:48.740\n&gt;&gt; Unpaid leave.\n\n367\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.640\n&gt;&gt; Unpaid leave is usually the one big one\nbecause that's normally where people start\n\n368\n00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.780\nhurting is when you tell them yep\nyou actually have unpaid leave or\n\n369\n00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.370\nyou're not gonna be assigned anything for\nthe next couple of weeks here.\n\n370\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.010\nThere is possible mediation.\n\n371\n00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.630\nRemember that is never a good thing\nbecause it means they're gonna split\n\n372\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.440\nthe baby between the two and\nnobody's gonna be happy about that.\n\n373\n00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.340\nBut what you might find out is\nboth of them end up on some\n\n374\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.170\noil rig in the Alaskan Gulf or\n\n375\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.960\nthe Alaskan Bering Sea up there and\nthe other one ends up in Saudi Arabia.\n\n376\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.780\nYou never know, but\nthat's what you might also have.\n\n377\n00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.800\nAnd then ultimately at the very end,\nit could be that you do relieve them\n\n378\n00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.480\nof their job duties when you\ndo have something like that.\n\n379\n00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.960\n&gt;&gt; When you say you,\nyou don't mean the project manager?\n\n380\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.250\nYou would normally offset that to\nthe human resource department?\n\n381\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nIf you're following the policy,\n\n382\n00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.660\nthat's probably what's\ngonna end up happening.\n\n383\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.810\nBut you as the actual project manager,\nthey're gonna come to you and\n\n384\n00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.240\nsay how do you want us to try and\nresolve this first?\n\n385\n00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.920\nBecause you're actually the lead here.\n\n386\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.280\nIf you need to keep them, you're gonna\nask them can they actually try and\n\n387\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.810\nmediate this somehow, or try and actually\ndo some disciplinary action instead of\n\n388\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.770\nactually just relieving\nthem of their duty.\n\n389\n00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.660\nBut overall though, you might find\nout that they may have to do that.\n\n390\n00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.160\nAlso, the other thing that you have to be\nwilling to deal with here are, of course,\n\n391\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.530\nare disgruntled team members and\nyou've got to be careful here too.\n\n392\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:13.920\nMake sure that as you listen to them,\nmake sure you try and\n\n393\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.560\nfigure out what the cause\nof the dissatisfaction is.\n\n394\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.240\nI think I misspelled dissatisfaction.\n\n395\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.817\nIf that happens, dissatisfaction,\n\n396\n00:22:22.817 --> 00:22:28.890\nmake sure you stick to the facts and\nthat's actually key here.\n\n397\n00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.310\nDon't embellish, don't take it away,\ndon't minimize it.\n\n398\n00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.360\nMake sure you stick to the facts.\n\n399\n00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.692\nAsk for concrete situations in\nwhich they really are upset.\n\n400\n00:22:38.692 --> 00:22:41.800\nDon't say, this is how it seems to be.\n\n401\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.410\nSeems to be is not enough,\n\n402\n00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.780\ngive me an example of what's\nactually happened as well.\n\n403\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:51.530\nIf it can't work out, try and replace\nthat person and get it done quickly, and\n\n404\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.260\nthen clarify and restate what the\nresolution is, because there may not be\n\n405\n00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.900\na resolution with that person and you\njust don't have the time to deal with it.\n\n406\n00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.210\nThere are many ways that we can\nhandle the idea of replacement or\n\n407\n00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.740\nthe idea here of relieving\nsomebody of their job duty\n\n408\n00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.780\nas far as personnel removal and\nreplacement goes.\n\n409\n00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:13.240\nBut it's actually very clear that it has\nto be done sometimes and it may fall on\n\n410\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.620\nyou as the project manager to actually\nindicate that it has to be done as well.\n\n411\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:23.060\nThere are a lot of things that we really\ndo have to make sure we take into account.\n\n412\n00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.180\nPersonnel management, the great thing\nis if you have a good HR department,\n\n413\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.240\nyou tend to just follow whatever the\npolicy is and you tell everybody onboard-\n\n414\n00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.420\n&gt;&gt; Leave the guess work out of it.\n\n415\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.880\n&gt;&gt; Yup, we're following it and not trying\nto make up our own policies instead and\n\n416\n00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.360\nthat was actually what will\nhelp you out the most.\n\n417\n00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.370\nSo make sure you do take a look at\nthis idea of conflict resolution.\n\n418\n00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.270\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, thank you so much for\nshowing us some alternatives we\n\n419\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.800\nhave before we actually do have to go\nahead and terminate that employee.\n\n420\n00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.580\nThank you guys so much for staying tuned.\n\n421\n00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.546\nWe have some more\nProject+ coming your way.\n\n422\n00:23:50.546 --> 00:23:52.174\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n423\n00:23:52.174 --> 00:23:53.420\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n424\n00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.496\n&gt;&gt; Signing off, have a great one.\n\n425\n00:23:55.496 --> 00:24:01.618\n[MUSIC]\n\n426\n00:24:01.618 --> 00:24:06.370\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.606\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:17.170\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another CompTIA Project+\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.180\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.010\nIn this episode,\nwe are gonna be honing in in our psychic\n\n7\n00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.180\nability to be able to predict the\nconstraints and influences on projects.\n\n8\n00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.530\nWait, no we're not.\n\n9\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.900\nJust kidding guys, we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong with us.\n\n10\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.520\nHe's gonna give us some great tips on\nactually how to go ahead and do that.\n\n11\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.780\nThank you for being here, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n13\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.480\nThis is not that kinda\npredictive ability but\n\n14\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.710\nit should actually help us to understand\nthat there are a few things that\n\n15\n00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.050\ndo happen on projects and we actually\njust need to be able to identify them.\n\n16\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.430\nAnd we need to understand\nwhere they do fit in.\n\n17\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.084\nSo that we can already go ahead and\n\n18\n00:00:53.084 --> 00:00:55.575\nstart planning what we\nare going to do about them.\n\n19\n00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.520\nIn other words,\nwe wanna actually know, hey,\n\n20\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.860\nwhat are these things\nreally going to happen?\n\n21\n00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.030\nAnd the official objective we call on\nthe ability to predict the way these\n\n22\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.700\ninfluences and of course constraints\nare going to impact our project.\n\n23\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.515\nAnd so, that is what we're gonna\ntake a look at today as we begin.\n\n24\n00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:13.995\nSo when we start to take a look,\n\n25\n00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:15.927\nwe're gonna deal in those\ntwo areas specifically.\n\n26\n00:01:15.927 --> 00:01:18.185\nWe wanna understand what\nthe influences are and\n\n27\n00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:20.835\nalso what our constraints are as well.\n\n28\n00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:23.675\nThe great thing is, since we've already\nbeen talking about constraints throughout\n\n29\n00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:26.325\nthe entire show,\nwe're gonna deal with that second but\n\n30\n00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:29.720\nwe wanna begin with the idea of\ninfluences and where we wanna start.\n\n31\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at influence at the project.\n\n32\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.350\nAnd then, we'll also look at how we can\ngo ahead and schedule, any kind of delays\n\n33\n00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.390\nin the schedules or any kind of resource\nallocation issues that may arise.\n\n34\n00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, so when you start taking\na look at the idea here of influences\n\n35\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.370\nwe're not really just talking about\nthings that happen along the way\n\n36\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.430\nthat prevent us from getting\nthings done in our project.\n\n37\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.030\nSo delays and of course allocations,\nresource allocations.\n\n38\n00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.620\nBut what we're really\ntalking about are overall\n\n39\n00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.715\nthings that can influence\nthe entirety of the project, and\n\n40\n00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:05.595\nwe wanna make sure that we\nunderstand how they impact us.\n\n41\n00:02:05.595 --> 00:02:09.715\nSo one of those ideas then that we\nneed to talk about here of course,\n\n42\n00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:15.125\nis the idea of some type of change\nrequest that goes on during our project.\n\n43\n00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:19.980\nIt is not uncommon that as a project\ndevelops and its people start seeing\n\n44\n00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.910\nthe little deliverables that we're\nactually producing the way or\n\n45\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.620\nthey're starting to see the path that\nit looks like the projects going,\n\n46\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.390\nthat somebody then says,\nI have a great idea this right now.\n\n47\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.790\nAnd then, what they want to do is that\nthey want to actually make a request\n\n48\n00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.690\nchange, that we actually include\ninto the project at this point.\n\n49\n00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.520\nNow, Cherokee, both of us have dealt with\nthe idea of project management before.\n\n50\n00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.450\nWe understand something that change\nrequest, a fly like that getting into\n\n51\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.769\nthe ointment, is that actually\na good thing or a bad thing?\n\n52\n00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.940\n&gt;&gt; It could be both.\n\n53\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.812\nIf it's a change that has a positive\noutcome, Ronnie, then I would say,\n\n54\n00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:00.090\ndefinitely go for it.\n\n55\n00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.620\nBut you might have to go through\nthe project management office, or\n\n56\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.650\nthe change advisory board, so\nit might kinda delay things a bit.\n\n57\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.330\nBut it could overall\nhave a positive impact.\n\n58\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can have a positive impact but\nthe impact whether it's positive or\n\n59\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.490\nnegative though the problem\nthat we have with the idea of\n\n60\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.510\njust a change request coming along and\nit's impact is the idea that\n\n61\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.710\nit can actually not just slow down the\nwork but it can change the entire work.\n\n62\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.850\nSo it might be where\na minor request change, and\n\n63\n00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.250\nsomebody says, this is just minor.\n\n64\n00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.700\nYou don't have to worry about this.\n\n65\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.960\nMight actually turn out\nto be something major,\n\n66\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.698\nto the point where you have to go back to.\n\n67\n00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:39.550\nLet's say, the design of whatever\nyou're actually working on and\n\n68\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.020\nredesign the entire piece of\nwhatever it is that they wanted.\n\n69\n00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.900\nSo you could see where that\ncould be a major impact.\n\n70\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.350\nThe idea of just something fairly simple,\n\n71\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.330\ndepending on what we're talking about\nat this point, could also change.\n\n72\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.420\nLet's say that somebody says,\nhere's the color that we want on this.\n\n73\n00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.710\nAnd we might think, that's easy enough,\nwe'll just change the color.\n\n74\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.820\nWell, what if that's a specially blended\ncolor that you've now ordered and\n\n75\n00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.100\nyou've ordered a lot of it?\n\n76\n00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.791\nAnd now you're just saying,\nyou wanna change this to really?\n\n77\n00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:10.180\nThat's another $10,000, is that okay?\n\n78\n00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.838\nWell, it might be but\nit might not be as well.\n\n79\n00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:17.280\nSo just kinda realize that change request\nthemselves can actually have minor impacts\n\n80\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.110\nand of course can be major ones.\n\n81\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.540\nAnd the same one can actually\nbe both if we take a look, so\n\n82\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.500\na single change for\nus could actually indicate\n\n83\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.930\nboth of them when something like\na change request happens as well.\n\n84\n00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.370\nSo take for an example that what\nyou actually do and say, or\n\n85\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.860\nlet's just say a contractor comes in for\nyou and says, look, I know that I'm\n\n86\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.750\nactually scheduled to be here on this\nweek, on the first week of November.\n\n87\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.690\nI know that that's the week\nI'm scheduled to be with you.\n\n88\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.370\nBut I need to push that back a week,\nis that okay?\n\n89\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.860\nWell, that might sound like,\nwhat's the big deal?\n\n90\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.230\nIt's only a week.\n\n91\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.860\nWell, it depends on what's\nactually lining up after that.\n\n92\n00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.250\nWhat if on that second week though you\nhad things that were supposed to start\n\n93\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.340\nthat were dependent upon\nthat contractor coming in?\n\n94\n00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.930\nAnd now you delayed them a week and then\nwhatever they were actually doing is also\n\n95\n00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.830\nthen a predecessor to something else\na little bit farther down the line.\n\n96\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.580\nWell, then, that delay of an entire week\nat that point could be a major impact.\n\n97\n00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.270\nNow, for that particular contractor\nit's a minor impact for him.\n\n98\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.140\nHe's saying, I just can't make it.\n\n99\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.290\nAnd I can make it, I can do the work,\n\n100\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.260\nI can do everything that you're asking me\nto do, I just can't do it on those days.\n\n101\n00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.910\nSo for him, fairly minor.\n\n102\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.660\nBut for us,\n\n103\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.000\nit could be a major type of impact change\nthat we really don't think about here.\n\n104\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.890\nThe other things that could also impact\nus in a major way and in a minor way at\n\n105\n00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.860\nthe same time, is the idea of what\nwe call an unauthorized change.\n\n106\n00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.710\nThis is what Cherokee was talking about.\n\n107\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.110\nYou need to submit it to some\ntype of change review board or\n\n108\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.270\nsomething else that we\nhave to deal with here.\n\n109\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.090\nThe very fact is that\nan unauthorized change\n\n110\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.020\ncan cause those same type of impacts.\n\n111\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.640\nThe rippling effect like\nwe have inside a pond,\n\n112\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.520\nwhich causes more things to\nhappen than what we realize.\n\n113\n00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.399\nSo it could be that Cherokee comes along,\nand she sees something, and\n\n114\n00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:11.230\nshe goes, I'm just gonna tweak\nthat setting just a little bit.\n\n115\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.168\nAnd all of a sudden now you had a run\nof whatever you were trying to do as\n\n116\n00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:16.290\nfar as the.\n\n117\n00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.575\nThe prototype, and now all of the sudden\nall of the other numbers are now off.\n\n118\n00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:23.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie,\nI've actually seen people do this before.\n\n119\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.250\nWhat may seem like a great idea to\nthat individual, you know it probably,\n\n120\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.880\nit might really impact a lot more than,\n\n121\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.350\nthen what they think because there might\nhave been some kind of analysis or\n\n122\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.560\nsome kind of measurement in place\nlike a check sum to prevent and\n\n123\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.870\nerror from occurring that they're not\neven aware of from like another system.\n\n124\n00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.750\nAnd they're like, I'll just\nstreamline this process get it done.\n\n125\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.483\nFaster, easier, or whatever their purpose.\n\n126\n00:06:45.483 --> 00:06:48.252\nAnd it could really cause\nproblems later on down the line.\n\n127\n00:06:48.252 --> 00:06:52.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is where it actually\nrequires somebody that has specialty in\n\n128\n00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:56.510\nintegration knowledge of these types\nof systems to really help us out.\n\n129\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.950\nBut at the same time you don't expect\nsomebody to just come along and\n\n130\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.240\ngo you wanna know something I don't\ncare what the project plan says,\n\n131\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.860\nI'm just gonna make do\nit this way instead.\n\n132\n00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.810\nBut before you do that, you do wanna\nmake sure you submit that change and\n\n133\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.310\nthe somebody reviews that so\nthat they can actually tell you, whoa,\n\n134\n00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.760\nwhoa, if you make that change, remember\nwhat else that changes down the line.\n\n135\n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.257\nAnd all the sudden then they'll be like,\nyeah, I better not make that change.\n\n136\n00:07:19.257 --> 00:07:22.863\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz they might just be\nfocused on one little section and\n\n137\n00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:26.700\ngetting the broad picture by\nwhomever is running that project.\n\n138\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it really does help\nwhen you have something like that.\n\n139\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.250\nBut that's why unauthorized\nchanges are really bad.\n\n140\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.030\nAnd so, even though we talked\nabout a change request,\n\n141\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.230\nan unauthorized change\nis just as bad here too.\n\n142\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.208\nNow, the worst ones though,\non the idea of a change request is simple.\n\n143\n00:07:41.208 --> 00:07:44.750\nSomebody, let's just say, I'm gonna use\nCherokee and pick on her for a minute.\n\n144\n00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.949\nLet's say that Cherokee says-\n&gt;&gt; That's new.\n\n145\n00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:48.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nwhat's new in this show at all?\n\n146\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.970\nIt actually does work fairly well.\n\n147\n00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.678\nBut let's go ahead and say this.\n\n148\n00:07:51.678 --> 00:07:56.083\nCherokee says, I know I need to go ahead\nand submit this change request because I\n\n149\n00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:59.329\nbelieve it's gonna be for\nthe betterment of the project.\n\n150\n00:07:59.329 --> 00:08:02.588\nSo she submits the change\nin the proper manner.\n\n151\n00:08:02.588 --> 00:08:06.779\nIt gets approved and now that change\nis now gonna be implemented in our\n\n152\n00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:11.210\nproject at whatever point that\nCherokee wanted it implemented at.\n\n153\n00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.000\nThat's great for Cherokee, okay.\n\n154\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.110\nThat works exactly the way that we want\nto, but now all of a sudden we start to\n\n155\n00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:22.350\ntry and do the process in the change that\nwas implemented and we find out something.\n\n156\n00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.440\nCherokee request even though it was\nactually in good intention, when we\n\n157\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.810\ntried to actually implement it inside of\nthe project, we may find out something.\n\n158\n00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.660\nThat was actually a bad\nchange that we had.\n\n159\n00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.500\nYou might be wondering okay, so\nit's a bad change, just flip it back.\n\n160\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.030\nWell, you can't.\n\n161\n00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.910\nNow, because it's officially\na part of project plan, Cherokee,\n\n162\n00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.920\nwhat do we have to do again?\n\n163\n00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.390\nWe have to actually do it, take-\n&gt;&gt; Go and\n\n164\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.340\nresubmit that change\nto the advisory board.\n\n165\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd then once you do that, right,\n\n166\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.450\nthey're gonna say, okay so what happened\nto that change that was supposed to be for\n\n167\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.170\nthe better move and\nCherokee now has to kind of explain that,\n\n168\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.530\nit really didn't work out\nthe way that I saw it.\n\n169\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What happened was.\n\n170\n00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\nYeah.\n\n171\n00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.645\nHere's how it's supposed to happen.\n\n172\n00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:06.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But here's what really happened here.\n\n173\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n174\n00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.990\n&gt;&gt; And as much as that sounds like it's\ngood, because Cherokee caught it and\n\n175\n00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.740\nshe submits it again.\n\n176\n00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.150\nBut now remember, delays that start to\nhappen because of that now, if any special\n\n177\n00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.220\ntool was made, when on because that\nchange Cherokee that requested.\n\n178\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.073\nBut now that particular cause is\nswallowed up by the project again and\n\n179\n00:09:25.073 --> 00:09:26.960\nnow we have to start over.\n\n180\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.100\nWe might actually made so\n\n181\n00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.070\nmany modifications at this\npoint because of that change.\n\n182\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.180\nThat is not enough to\nactually to go back and\n\n183\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.680\nadd in something and just go that effects.\n\n184\n00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.640\nAnd I've seen this recently Cherokee,\n\n185\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.010\njust a configuration and change on\na natural router that I was working on.\n\n186\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.000\nSo we have a forum, take in on a forum.\n\n187\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.930\nForum questions that we have on our site,\n\n188\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:56.010\nhere at ITProTV and usually when I\ntake a look at it and somebody says,\n\n189\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.900\nI'm having issues setting this up\non the Cisco router for my lab.\n\n190\n00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.021\nSo I normally try and do what,\nI trying just go on and this complex.\n\n191\n00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:04.634\n&gt;&gt; Replicate the problem.\n\n192\n00:10:04.634 --> 00:10:05.247\n&gt;&gt; Replicate the problem.\n\n193\n00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:08.200\nSo, yesterday I couldn't\nreplicate the problem at all.\n\n194\n00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.610\nI was trying like crazy to replicate\nthe same issue that they were having.\n\n195\n00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:17.390\nAnd so, it was funny that I was actually\nfinally able to replicate the problem.\n\n196\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.570\nBut, it was just one of those unusual\nthings, where now that I'd actually tried\n\n197\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.325\neverything else, I didn't know exactly\nhow I replicated the problem, so now.\n\n198\n00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:26.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're like,\n\n199\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.260\nwell how do you fix it then?\n\n200\n00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.860\nIf I don't know what\nactually caused the problem,\n\n201\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.010\nhow do I know what it is that I take out,\nwell that's the same thing.\n\n202\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:38.720\nSo, how did I actually begin when I kind\nof told him, here's what I would do.\n\n203\n00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.560\nAnd then this morning,\nthey kind of wrote back in and said, yeah,\n\n204\n00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.080\nthat didn't work by the way.\n\n205\n00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.860\nAnd I said, let me do this,\n\n206\n00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.015\nthe only that I can do is start\nfrom a clean fresh router, okay.\n\n207\n00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:53.400\nAnd there's no configs on it,\njust like it came from the factory and\n\n208\n00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.330\nI'll start my configuration from there.\n\n209\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.250\nAnd guess what,\nthen I was able to solve the problem\n\n210\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.880\nexactly the way I was supposed to and\nit worked.\n\n211\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.670\nSo it could have been, that when I set\nup that configuration earlier to try and\n\n212\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.380\nreplicate that, that I hadn't\ncleaned up anything at that point.\n\n213\n00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.040\nI had just built on top of one another and\nthat was just bad, because there were\n\n214\n00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.620\nother configs that could have\nbeen on that router I was using.\n\n215\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.310\nSo it was just a bad\nmess that I ended up in.\n\n216\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.620\nAnd those types of unauthorized changes or\nchanges that are made for\n\n217\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.690\nthe idea of being good\ncould end up being bad.\n\n218\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.740\nAnd now we have to change them back.\n\n219\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.484\nAnd that's just a long process and\na [CROSSTALK]\n\n220\n00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:26.155\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n221\n00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:29.810\nThe good news is you were able to\nsolve the problem, the issue, okay.\n\n222\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.270\nThrough the process of elimination.\n\n223\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.140\nHowever, you did have to\nabsorb the delay there so.\n\n224\n00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThe delay is kind of the big thing, right.\n\n225\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.940\nBecause remember of all those constraints\nthat we talked about time, resources and\n\n226\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.550\nof course,\nthe idea of the requirement here.\n\n227\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.520\nWell, if you're actually doing so\nmany things at the same time and\n\n228\n00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.000\nyou go,\nI should have kept a better track of that.\n\n229\n00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.690\nWell now, you have to go back and\nremember what actually was changed.\n\n230\n00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:01.353\nAnd then somebody looks on and goes look,\nit's better if we just kind of start all\n\n231\n00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:06.270\nover on this particular, we can't fix it,\nso we better just start all over.\n\n232\n00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.900\nThat might be a prototype that now\nstarts from what the scratch again and\n\n233\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:10.600\nthat takes time.\n\n234\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.510\n&gt;&gt; I can definitely relate to that,\nthat's what I had to do this morning with\n\n235\n00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.820\na virtual machine [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n236\n00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.602\nAnd so the great thing is, it was virtual\nand it wasn't actually in production that\n\n237\n00:12:17.602 --> 00:12:19.206\nas you're starting to do it\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n238\n00:12:19.206 --> 00:12:22.729\n&gt;&gt; But once we get into shows and\nCherokee's starting to do more of these,\n\n239\n00:12:22.729 --> 00:12:26.839\nit's gonna be important that she's able\nto keep track of that, so that she knows,\n\n240\n00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:30.653\nI do need to revert that or I don't know\neverything was fine when I started from\n\n241\n00:12:30.653 --> 00:12:33.250\nscratch, but\nit's not fine as I try to fix it.\n\n242\n00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.398\nThat's because you might have done,\nthe general rule of thumb right,\n\n243\n00:12:36.398 --> 00:12:40.710\nis make a change, it doesn't work, undo\nthat change before you make a new change.\n\n244\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.430\nAll of us just tend to go, that didn't\nwork let me go ahead and do this and\n\n245\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.795\ndo that and do this again.\n\n246\n00:12:45.795 --> 00:12:50.340\nAnd one of those changes may have worked,\nbut we don't know which one at this point.\n\n247\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.350\nSo you do have to worry\nabout something like this.\n\n248\n00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:57.270\nSo, changes can be major\ninfluences on our project is\n\n249\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.450\nwhat we're really dealing with, okay.\n\n250\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.410\nNow, the other thing that we\nhave to deal with, Cherokee,\n\n251\n00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.040\nhave you ever heard of the idea,\nscope creep?\n\n252\n00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.290\n&gt;&gt; Scope creep.\n\n253\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.795\nI'm not too sure, but I have a feeling\nyou're going to tell me Ronnie.\n\n254\n00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:08.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n255\n00:13:08.682 --> 00:13:11.549\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when we take a look at the idea of\n\n256\n00:13:11.549 --> 00:13:15.100\nscope creep, what normally happens right,\nwhen we create our\n\n257\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:20.090\nproject plan after the initiation, we have\nwhat we call the scope of the project.\n\n258\n00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:25.260\nAnd that normally tells us what the actual\nproject sponsor desires to see at the end\n\n259\n00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.910\nand that is our limitations for what\nwe're going to be doing in that project.\n\n260\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.860\nNow in scope creep what\ntends to happen is that,\n\n261\n00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.570\nlittle by little,\nthe scope actually increases in size.\n\n262\n00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.510\nI had mentioned this early\non in another episode.\n\n263\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.210\nProjects tend to be like weddings, okay.\n\n264\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.910\nA wedding can start off very small,\nvery, very small.\n\n265\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.080\nBut it doesn't take long before\nthat same wedding becomes-\n\n266\n00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.240\n&gt;&gt; The distant relatives come out of\n\n267\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:52.750\nthe woodwork?\n\n268\n00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:53.536\n&gt;&gt; A very big, yes.\n\n269\n00:13:53.536 --> 00:13:55.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A very big affair and\n\n270\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:01.010\nit's not because your wedding has actually\nchanged as far as what the intent was,\n\n271\n00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.940\nbut now more and more people get involved-\n&gt;&gt; Everyone found out you were\n\n272\n00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.600\nhaving an open bar?\n\n273\n00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.380\nThat's what happened.\n\n274\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.415\n&gt;&gt; And everyone found out that\nyou're having an open bar, wow.\n\n275\n00:14:06.415 --> 00:14:07.804\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That did actually\n\n276\n00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:09.015\nincrease really quickly.\n\n277\n00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:09.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once\n\n278\n00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.060\nyou have something like that right,\nthat's the same idea scope creep.\n\n279\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.400\nNobody actually says, it's actually\ngotten any bigger, but it literally has.\n\n280\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.910\nIt's actually gotten larger and\nlarger due to time and of course,\n\n281\n00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:27.280\nthe more people that\nrequest changes that go on,\n\n282\n00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.670\nthe more you realize you're actually\nfarther away from the original idea.\n\n283\n00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.770\nNow, normally when you have something like\nthis, it really does impact the entire\n\n284\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:41.950\nproject majorly and actually all\nacross the entire project as well.\n\n285\n00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:48.600\nNow here, I have kind of an unusually\nsad and funny story at the same time.\n\n286\n00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.180\nAnd the reason why is that we're\nusing the government now, to try and\n\n287\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.330\nindicate the idea of scope creep.\n\n288\n00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.130\nNow I'm not going to say every government\naround the planet is like this, but\n\n289\n00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.100\nI know at least for us,\nin the states, right.\n\n290\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:07.670\nThe very fact is scope happens by\nmagnitudes is what tends to happen.\n\n291\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.557\nSo a good of example of that is that,\nthere was an original project by\n\n292\n00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:16.620\na guy named I'll make sure I tell you\nright, Colonel Robert Smith, okay.\n\n293\n00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.680\nNow Cherokee, have you ever\nheard of Colonel Robert Smith?\n\n294\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.300\n&gt;&gt; I haven't.\n\n295\n00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.027\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is great.\n\n296\n00:15:21.027 --> 00:15:22.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is great point\n\n297\n00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.370\nhere to-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n298\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:28.450\nJust don't get me involved in anything too\nhairy here with the government [LAUGH].\n\n299\n00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.161\n&gt;&gt; No, no, nothing too hairy here.\n\n300\n00:15:30.161 --> 00:15:33.530\nSo Colonel Robert Smith,\nright he was actually had this idea.\n\n301\n00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.410\nHe wanted to make a troop carrier\nthat would allow troops to\n\n302\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.410\nget to the front line much quicker and\nalso be protected.\n\n303\n00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.560\nSo he developed an armored vehicle,\n\n304\n00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.810\nthat had a little 20 millimeter\nmachine gun on top but\n\n305\n00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.700\ncould carry let's say, eight to ten maybe\n12 people, but get there quickly, okay.\n\n306\n00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.476\nEssentially a truck, that had four\narmored walls on it and a gun turret,\n\n307\n00:15:54.476 --> 00:15:56.682\ncenter right there at the front.\n\n308\n00:15:56.682 --> 00:16:02.383\nSo they could actually deliver that many\ntroops very quickly to the front line.\n\n309\n00:16:02.383 --> 00:16:04.132\nSo he came up with a project to do so.\n\n310\n00:16:04.132 --> 00:16:08.790\nPresented it of course to the Pentagon and\nthe Pentagon said, great idea.\n\n311\n00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:14.640\nAnd they called it the Bradley\nFighting Troop Carrier Vehicle.\n\n312\n00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.670\n&gt;&gt; So did he get hired at DARPA?\n\n313\n00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.650\n&gt;&gt; He didn't get hired at DARPA.\n\n314\n00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:23.420\nHe ended up becoming a brigadier\ngeneral if I remember correctly.\n\n315\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.820\nBut his particular project though and\n\n316\n00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.230\nwhat ended up happening here is that\nhe told them here's what it takes.\n\n317\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.810\nSo as he created this project and\n\n318\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.260\nhe presented it, everybody loved\nit they thought it was great.\n\n319\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.810\nAnd they said okay, so\nhow much money do you need.\n\n320\n00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.240\nAnd so he said for\nus to develop the prototype and\n\n321\n00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.330\nthe model it's gonna be one and\na half million dollars.\n\n322\n00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.600\nOne and half million dollars.\n\n323\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.140\n&gt;&gt; Not bad.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n324\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.350\nthat's pretty decent at\nthe government level.\n\n325\n00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.731\nAnd he, of course, got approved for that.\n\n326\n00:16:49.731 --> 00:16:53.677\nBut before that approval it was like, hey,\nwe need to put a bigger gun on this thing,\n\n327\n00:16:53.677 --> 00:16:55.688\ncause that's not gonna protect anybody.\n\n328\n00:16:55.688 --> 00:16:58.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, of course, a million went, okay,\n\n329\n00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.336\na bigger gun can happen.\n\n330\n00:16:59.336 --> 00:17:00.042\n&gt;&gt; Bigger bullets?\n\n331\n00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:01.710\n&gt;&gt; And it didn't take long, yeah,\n\n332\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.330\nbefore what started to happen\nto that particular idea, right?\n\n333\n00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.530\nIs that now that was accepted.\n\n334\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.950\nProject changes started happening to and\nscope creep went nuts, okay.\n\n335\n00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.690\nAnd when I say it went nuts\nlet me kind of give you\n\n336\n00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.070\nthe number of what were talking\nabout this far scope creep for this.\n\n337\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.860\nThey thought it would be very up and\nfast and running you know because\n\n338\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.750\nit really was a truck to had four\narmor walls and a gun turret.\n\n339\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.650\nNot seats because they wanted\nthe people to be ready to jump out when\n\n340\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:31.860\nthey needed to.\n\n341\n00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.280\nSo this particular project that\nstarted off with a million and\n\n342\n00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.840\na half dollars now actually\nended up being 17 years long and\n\n343\n00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.280\ncosting 14 billion dollars, okay.\n\n344\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.980\nSo if you want to talk\nabout major scope creep,\n\n345\n00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.220\nthat's an example of very\ngigantic scope creep.\n\n346\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.060\nI have something that was very fast and\n\n347\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.060\nnimble at the beginning, now essentially\nbecame a tank, is what it actually became.\n\n348\n00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.250\nSo you've just got to take\na look at how that happens.\n\n349\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.760\nAnd there's actually an entire\nmovie that's based off of\n\n350\n00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.960\nthis premise that actually\nsurrounded that project scope there.\n\n351\n00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.710\nThat originally happened.\n\n352\n00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.560\nNow it's called the pentagon wars.\n\n353\n00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.730\nNow, not everything in the pentagon\nwars is 100% accurate fact, but\n\n354\n00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.120\nthe beginning project,\nthough, it really is.\n\n355\n00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.170\nAnd, so,\nif you want to take a look at that.\n\n356\n00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.390\nIt's kind of neat because it shows\nyou how quickly scope creep can\n\n357\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.840\nhappen to a project.\n\n358\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.320\nAnd how it does happen even over time.\n\n359\n00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.960\nAnd this is how a project goes from\na million five to to 17 million dollars.\n\n360\n00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.634\nExcuse me, $14 billion.\n\n361\n00:18:35.634 --> 00:18:41.030\nNot million, billion dollars, and\nit takes 20 years essentially to complete.\n\n362\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:45.610\nSo when you have something like that,\nthat's why it's very important that\n\n363\n00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:50.310\nnormally project managers are very much\nprotective of the scope of their project.\n\n364\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.250\nBecause I need to know the limitations,\n\n365\n00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:56.380\nwhere it doesn't happen that way,\nwhere it gets out of hand very quickly.\n\n366\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.250\nSo that's why that is actually one of\nthe influences that we really want\n\n367\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.860\nto try to minimize is that somebody keeps\nslipping in stuff here and there and\n\n368\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.680\nall of sudden here it is.\n\n369\n00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.920\nIt's actually not even\nanything that looks close.\n\n370\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.869\nImagine a truck that has four high,\nyou know let's say,\n\n371\n00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:17.067\nsix feet armored walls here, and\nnow it looks like a tank 20 years later.\n\n372\n00:19:17.067 --> 00:19:17.886\n&gt;&gt; What was his name?\n\n373\n00:19:17.886 --> 00:19:21.490\n&gt;&gt; The guys name was\nactually Robert Smith.\n\n374\n00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.290\nColonel Robert Smith when he first start,\nI think he did become a general.\n\n375\n00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.780\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhat Colonel Robert Smith maybe wanted to,\n\n376\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.620\nmaybe what he could do was in his\nproject charter to just go ahead and\n\n377\n00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.900\nwhen he was defining that were told\nto go ahead and define the scope.\n\n378\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.920\nAnd then also clearly define what we\nare not going to be doing as well, right?\n\n379\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.230\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like an awesome idea.\n\n380\n00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.860\nAnd yes,\nif you were in regular project management,\n\n381\n00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.840\nthat would probably be\napproved right away.\n\n382\n00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.630\nIn fact though, he works for\nthe government-\n\n383\n00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.632\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n384\n00:19:51.632 --> 00:19:54.968\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which, and his particular presentation\n\n385\n00:19:54.968 --> 00:19:59.290\nwas not to, people that could\njust say we don't like that idea.\n\n386\n00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.340\nThey were the people that could\nessentially kinda go not only do we not\n\n387\n00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.780\nlike that idea, but\nyou're getting transferred to Alaska.\n\n388\n00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.170\nSo you do have to kinda make\nsome concession that time.\n\n389\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.890\nBut what you wanna do of course is\nunderstand that scope creep is a possible\n\n390\n00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.480\ninfluence there as well as\nthe idea of change requests too.\n\n391\n00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.610\nSo those are very big possibilities\nthat you do have to face and\n\n392\n00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:24.110\nthink about when you start talking\nabout influences to your project, okay?\n\n393\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.480\nNow the other one of course then is we\nhave to actually remember the idea of\n\n394\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.920\nthose project constraints\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n395\n00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.890\nAnd understand the nature of\nthe prioritization of them.\n\n396\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.210\nSo let me go ahead and review that.\n\n397\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:42.100\nLet's take a look at my computer screen\nfor a moment and that will help us out.\n\n398\n00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.000\nSo originally when we take a look at\nproject here, usually this is what we end\n\n399\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.660\nup seeing is the constraint triangle,\nthe iron triangle.\n\n400\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.910\nWhatever you wanna call it\nis perfectly fine here.\n\n401\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.160\nAnd so, remember that normally\nit's a balance between those.\n\n402\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.480\nNow, you can only balance so much of them.\n\n403\n00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:02.000\nNormally what happens is that\nyou prioritize what you can't.\n\n404\n00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.280\nSo in a traditional type\nof project management,\n\n405\n00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.030\nreally if there is an immovable,\nin other words,\n\n406\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:13.230\na constant in terms of what the project\nis gonna be as far as the constraints go.\n\n407\n00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.970\nIt's gonna be the scope, okay?\n\n408\n00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.360\nUsually that's what we stick\nwith as being the scope.\n\n409\n00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.210\nSo that means if there's any variable\ninside our project that's gonna deal with\n\n410\n00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:25.980\nbudget, how much money that\nwe can spend or time, okay.\n\n411\n00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.580\nSo those are usually the two that we\nmight actually kind of influence.\n\n412\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.960\nNow the problem is fairly simple right?\n\n413\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.400\nNormally the way that we say it in\nterms of what everybody understands\n\n414\n00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.670\nis that idea of good, fast, and cheap.\n\n415\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.010\n&gt;&gt; Or something is going to suffer?\n\n416\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.190\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\nOr something is going to suffer here.\n\n417\n00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:49.610\nAs you've focus in on one,\nthe other two really do end up suffering.\n\n418\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.810\nNow even though in regular project\nmanagement it's not that we focus only on\n\n419\n00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:54.473\nthe scope.\n\n420\n00:21:54.473 --> 00:21:57.782\nBut we try and keep them in balance\nalong with the other two, but\n\n421\n00:21:57.782 --> 00:22:00.230\nwe don't normally end up seeing that,\nokay.\n\n422\n00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.690\nNow, when we start to do that,\n\n423\n00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.000\nright, we have to actually work within\nthose particular constraints here.\n\n424\n00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.330\nAffecting one does affect the other two,\nso we have to understand that influence.\n\n425\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.585\nIf we don't understand it, that's when\nwe're gonna get caught off guard.\n\n426\n00:22:11.585 --> 00:22:15.040\nCause were gonna say, I'm just trying to\nmake it every requirement possible and\n\n427\n00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.520\neverything that somebody wants\nto think of under the sun.\n\n428\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.910\nBut I know I'm over budget,\nby a million dollars.\n\n429\n00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.820\nNot everybody is going to be happy with\nthat in the project when it ends here.\n\n430\n00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.670\nI just want to make it so much better.\n\n431\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.040\nBut I know it's a year behind schedule.\n\n432\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.060\nAgain, not good because think about\nthis in the competitive marketplace.\n\n433\n00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.920\nIf you're a year behind schedule the other\nguys already got the product and\n\n434\n00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.670\nlet me kind of-\n&gt;&gt; You might be irrelevant or\n\n435\n00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.140\nyour product irrelevant at that point.\n\n436\n00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.350\n&gt;&gt; A great example of that is the iPhone,\nit really is that.\n\n437\n00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You think about it,\n\n438\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.690\nthe very fact is nobody else was saying,\n\n439\n00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.650\nyou know we think the iPhone\nis going to stick around.\n\n440\n00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.650\nPeople were making fun of that thing.\n\n441\n00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.070\nAnd they got onto the market.\n\n442\n00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.600\nAnd then all the sudden\neverybody else was like,\n\n443\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.850\nwe didn't didn't think it would take off.\n\n444\n00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.330\nNo other other smartphone that they\nhad ever had before has taken off like\n\n445\n00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.840\nthe way that the iPhone did.\n\n446\n00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.600\nAnd there they were and\neverybody was caught off guard.\n\n447\n00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.880\nAnd now they're already ahead.\n\n448\n00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.870\nSo, now imagine them trying to start\noff the year after the iPhone.\n\n449\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.620\nWell, now it doesn't matter.\n\n450\n00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.880\nThere's just no way that\nyou caught up with that,\n\n451\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.820\nit was just impossible at that point.\n\n452\n00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.840\nBut you can kinda see why understanding\nthe way that these constraints work, and\n\n453\n00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.560\nhow are they really\ninterdependent on that way.\n\n454\n00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.350\nWhere you have to really try and\nkeep them in balance within another.\n\n455\n00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.410\n&gt;&gt; Within balance yep.\n\n456\n00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.280\n&gt;&gt; Yep or you're gonna end up seeing\nthat their influence is gonna be so\n\n457\n00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.650\nmajor you're not gonna be\nable to control any of them.\n\n458\n00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.490\nAnd that's a problem that you\ndo end up seeing as well, okay.\n\n459\n00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:46.080\nThe other thing of course then is what if\nyou actually want to move beyond this and\n\n460\n00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.290\nyou say hey, I want to actually go\nbeyond standard project management for\n\n461\n00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:51.300\na moment here.\n\n462\n00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.775\nAnd I wanna move to the Agile\nmethod instead, okay?\n\n463\n00:23:54.775 --> 00:23:57.692\nAnd well, now all of a sudden,\nthe Agile method's a little bit different.\n\n464\n00:23:57.692 --> 00:23:59.723\nAnd let me show you how that changes here.\n\n465\n00:23:59.723 --> 00:24:04.337\nAnd what you have to do is you have to\nre-prioritize the constraints in this\n\n466\n00:24:04.337 --> 00:24:05.530\nway, okay?\n\n467\n00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.590\nSo if we take a look over\nhere on the left hand side,\n\n468\n00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:13.490\nremember that this is how we normally\nsee regular project management going\n\n469\n00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.810\nwhere this requirement here is absolutely\nthe one that's normally fixed.\n\n470\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.850\nIt's not something that\nwe generally change.\n\n471\n00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.040\nCost and budget is normally what we tend\nto kind of have to switch off between,\n\n472\n00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.360\nto try and keep it in balance for\nthe scope.\n\n473\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.930\nBut over in Agile, if we take\na look at the right-hand side here,\n\n474\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.090\nnotice that they've pretty much\ninverted the iron triangle in this way,\n\n475\n00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:39.530\nwhere time and cost are actually\nthe ones that are usually fixed and\n\n476\n00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.860\nthat means that it's the scope\nthat can be variable.\n\n477\n00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:46.080\nNow, not the entire project scope itself,\nthey know what they have to deliver.\n\n478\n00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.620\nBut now that they're managing in\nwhat we call iterations right,\n\n479\n00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.486\nthe little chunks and\nunits of what we're talking about,\n\n480\n00:24:52.486 --> 00:24:57.125\nthey can actually decide on each\ndeliverable, how much they can actually\n\n481\n00:24:57.125 --> 00:25:02.115\nreally do in that particular amount of\ntime and for the cost that they have.\n\n482\n00:25:02.115 --> 00:25:05.220\nSo that's why it is very important for\nus to understand what\n\n483\n00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.150\nwe call the idea of constraint\nre-prioritization because it does depend\n\n484\n00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:14.140\non the methodology that you use and you do\nneed to understand that if you're going to\n\n485\n00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:19.090\nchoose that as being a method to getting\nyour project done as well, okay?\n\n486\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:23.710\nSo there's a lot to actually think about\nwhen we start taking a look at the idea of\n\n487\n00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.240\ninfluences as well.\n\n488\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.425\nNow there's a couple more influences\nI just wanna briefly mention before\n\n489\n00:25:29.425 --> 00:25:30.185\nwe run out of time.\n\n490\n00:25:30.185 --> 00:25:32.765\nCherokee's really looking at me like we\nare really running out of time, but let me\n\n491\n00:25:32.765 --> 00:25:36.105\nmention these last two here cuz it's not\ngonna take very long for us to do this.\n\n492\n00:25:36.105 --> 00:25:40.135\nNow the other one of course are actually\nunderstanding the role of the stakeholder,\n\n493\n00:25:40.135 --> 00:25:42.615\nsponsors, and management as well, and\n\n494\n00:25:42.615 --> 00:25:46.115\nremember that those voices are very\npowerful voices in your project.\n\n495\n00:25:46.115 --> 00:25:49.415\nAnd they can actually influence\nproject team members,\n\n496\n00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:51.620\nthey can influence project team leads,\n\n497\n00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.740\nthey can influence contractors that come\nin and the problem is fairly simple.\n\n498\n00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.130\nEverybody can get a different voice\nfrom a different sponsor, a different\n\n499\n00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:05.040\nstakeholder, a different type of\nmanagement that's actually right there and\n\n500\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.150\nthere can be so\nmany voices now influencing the project,\n\n501\n00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.830\nit's very difficult to understand\nwhich one is the right voice.\n\n502\n00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.730\nSo the way that we limit that influence or\n\n503\n00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:19.660\nwe control that amount of influence is\nthat what the project manager says is,\n\n504\n00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.760\nif you have any changes that you want to\nrequest, you have anything that you wanna\n\n505\n00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.020\ndo, it filters through me,\nas the project manager okay.\n\n506\n00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.510\nAnd then what they're doing is they're\ncommunicating through the project manager,\n\n507\n00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.710\nwhat needs to be done and not just to him.\n\n508\n00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.900\nThey're not telling him orders, but\n\n509\n00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.270\nthey're actually communicating\nthrough him as well.\n\n510\n00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.680\nSo just kind of be aware that that's\nwhat we actually have to have,\n\n511\n00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.440\nthat they are funneled through him.\n\n512\n00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:47.870\nNow we actually have this for\nITProTV in the way that we do development\n\n513\n00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:53.110\nof our website and of all the products\nthat we have in terms of the applications,\n\n514\n00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.060\nis that we have multiple\ndevelopers on staff right now.\n\n515\n00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.130\nBut it's easy for\nany one of our team members just to go,\n\n516\n00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.560\nI'm having a problem with this,\ncan you help me look at this right now.\n\n517\n00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.910\nHere's somebody, one of our members\nhas actually said that they need this.\n\n518\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.220\nAnd so it's very easy to go directly\nto one of those developers and do that.\n\n519\n00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.253\nWell, they're already working on\nprojects to help make everything better,\n\n520\n00:27:14.253 --> 00:27:16.817\nso instead what we did is\nthat we put in place here,\n\n521\n00:27:16.817 --> 00:27:19.860\nwe actually have them all\nfunnel through one person.\n\n522\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:20.980\nAnd if you need changes or\n\n523\n00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.010\nyou need to actually relate\nsomething to the development team,\n\n524\n00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.250\nyou actually go to that one person.\n\n525\n00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.590\nAnd that one person is who actually\ncommunicates, so they know\n\n526\n00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:34.520\nwho they're really answering to is one\nperson and not multiple people as well.\n\n527\n00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.580\nAnd then of course, if you have multiple\nshared resources that you have to\n\n528\n00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.040\ndepend on, you've gotta realize then\nthat that means that your resources also\n\n529\n00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.680\nare gonna be influenced by other projects\nbecause of the shared resources and\n\n530\n00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.400\nthe shared availability.\n\n531\n00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.790\nIt means your negotiation\nskills have to be up to par,\n\n532\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.220\nif you're gonna actually try to control\nthe amount of influence from any one of\n\n533\n00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:01.630\nthese things that we've mentioned as far\nas the past, in past several minutes here.\n\n534\n00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.560\nSo be aware of these as being kind of\nmajor influences that we still have to\n\n535\n00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.510\nactually learn how to control or limit and\ndeal with as we start moving through our\n\n536\n00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:15.140\nproject management planning and then\neven into the execution phase as well.\n\n537\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.660\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Ronnie for showing us these\nmethods and looking at the different types\n\n538\n00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.530\nof constraints and influences\nthat we may come across because I\n\n539\n00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.200\ndon't think we can really rely on my\nnonexistent psychic abilities here.\n\n540\n00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.380\nBy actually putting a little bit\nof knowledge and planning and\n\n541\n00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.940\nthought into this, then I think we're\ngonna get a lot further than that.\n\n542\n00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.060\nSo, thank you.\n\n543\n00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.120\nAnd thank you guys for joining us today,\nI appreciate you being here.\n\n544\n00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.860\nWe have more Project+ to come,\nso stay tuned.\n\n545\n00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.750\nI'm Cherokee

00:00:08.944\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.944 --> 00:00:11.856\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:15.222\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:17.122\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:21.892\nIn this episode we're gonna go ahead and\ncontinue looking at predicting our\n\n8\n00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:26.151\nconstraints and influences,\nstudying for project plus.\n\n9\n00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.569\nWith us today we have, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:30.120\nThank you for being with us today Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.250\nWell, thank you for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.870\nAs we continue on taking a look at more\ninformation about the ID of the influences\n\n13\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.150\nand dealing with constraints in\nterms of project management.\n\n14\n00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.920\nNow, we spend on a whole episode\ncentury talking at some other\n\n15\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.068\ninfluences that we have to learn how\nto deal with as a project manager.\n\n16\n00:00:46.068 --> 00:00:48.840\nAnd now we're focusing\nin on the constraints\n\n17\n00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.490\nI am talking about them\na little bit more in details.\n\n18\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.080\nNow when we start taking look\nat the rome of constraints\n\n19\n00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.065\nwe really wanna make\nsure that we understand.\n\n20\n00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:58.550\nAt least examples of what we mean,\n\n21\n00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.680\nwhen we talk about those iron\ntriangle of constraints, right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.540\nThe idea of scope being a constraint and\n\n23\n00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.900\nthe idea of course of time,\nour schedule and budget as well.\n\n24\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.080\nSo these are actually\nthe kind of overall view and\n\n25\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.080\noverall constraints that we have,\nbut it doesn't really help us\n\n26\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.870\nif we don't understand some\nof the details behind this.\n\n27\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.810\nSo that's what we're gonna just briefly\ntake a look at and to see that we have to\n\n28\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.970\noperate within these constraints and\nmake our project successful as well.\n\n29\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.910\nSo we're gonna be hitting each one of\nthese as we start to take a look here,\n\n30\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.470\nis what we want to do.\n\n31\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.210\nSo when we start to actually\ntalk about this idea,\n\n32\n00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.950\nwe wanna actually understand what\nhappens with the idea of cost.\n\n33\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.590\nAnd of course,\nof each one of these when they change.\n\n34\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.270\nAnd what essentially ends up\nhappening with the other ones\n\n35\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.760\nthat end up working against us and\nwe have poor project management with them.\n\n36\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.035\nSo let's go ahead and take for\nexample the idea of cost,\n\n37\n00:01:58.035 --> 00:02:02.610\ncuz that's kinda the one that\nmost people tend to deal with.\n\n38\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.120\nTime, we normally allow\nthat to kind of have\n\n39\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.920\na little bit of leeway between here and\nthere.\n\n40\n00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.400\nEven requirements, we might say 90%\nis good enough a lot of times but\n\n41\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.600\nwhen it comes down to being exact\nin the way that we want to.\n\n42\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.920\nUsually it comes down to that bottom\nline of the all mighty cost itself\n\n43\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.530\nin terms of overall value.\n\n44\n00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.840\nSo one of the key things that I\nwant to make sure that we emphasize\n\n45\n00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.230\nas we talk about the constraints\nof cost especially here.\n\n46\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.790\nYou also hear this idea that\nyou've got to understand.\n\n47\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.870\nIt's not about always\nfinishing below cost.\n\n48\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.210\nI know that it sounds strange.\n\n49\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.230\nIt's not always about finishing over cost,\nas well.\n\n50\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.460\nWhat we want to do with the idea\nof working within the constraint,\n\n51\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.700\nis the way that we have it\nplanned out in our budget,\n\n52\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.620\nwith minor exceptions\ndue to cost fluctuation.\n\n53\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.490\nNow a little bit of variables in there.\n\n54\n00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.400\nBut not a lot that we want\nour project to really finish\n\n55\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.510\nas if we said we planned\nit out to the dollar and\n\n56\n00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.210\nwe wanna make sure that we spend\nthat particular amount of money.\n\n57\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.190\nNow, Cherokee, when it comes down to\njust personal things, usually for me,\n\n58\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.090\nas always trying to say let's\nsave some money, right?\n\n59\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.680\nAnd always finish below budget,\nhow about with you Cherokee?\n\n60\n00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nRonnie I was just thinking about that,\n\n61\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.070\nit doesn't always go according to plan.\n\n62\n00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.980\nI mean it's a great idea,\nhey I wanna go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.110\nsave some money, maybe I'm saving up for\na particular item or whatever, but\n\n64\n00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.680\nwhat happens if you have\na poorly managed project and\n\n65\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.270\nwith your costs how do you\nkinda keep that tied in and?\n\n66\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have to actually be\nvery careful here because with\n\n67\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.110\npoorly managed cost, the weird thing\nis how it's actually displayed and\n\n68\n00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.550\nhow a project manager takes\nadvantages to get us back on track.\n\n69\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.640\nIn the way that we need\nwith cost as a constraint.\n\n70\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.180\nSo do I mean with a poorly managed\nproject here in terms of cost?\n\n71\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.340\nWell it's just like I was describing.\n\n72\n00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.070\nA project can be poorly managed if,\n\n73\n00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.300\nevery single task that you\nhave is constantly over cost.\n\n74\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.430\nAnd that makes us the most of us, right?\n\n75\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.596\nIf I tell you, you are only supposed\nto spend a $100 on this Cherokee.\n\n76\n00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:20.080\nAnd then everytime you turn in, something\nfor the end of that, you're spending $150.\n\n77\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.910\nAfter a while, I'm gonna have to\nsay what are you spending money on?\n\n78\n00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.075\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n79\n00:04:25.075 --> 00:04:26.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It happens.\n\n80\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but why does it happen?\n\n81\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.780\nSee, that's the key.\n\n82\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.290\nIt's great if you know why it happens.\n\n83\n00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.490\nAnd then you let me know why it happens.\n\n84\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.440\nBut if that's the answer that I get,\n\n85\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.975\nright, the only answer that I get is,\nRonnie it happens.\n\n86\n00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:42.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now I have to wonder like, what didn't\n\n87\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.110\nI make clear when I told Cherokee that\nwe're only spending $100 on this.\n\n88\n00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.050\nAnd so, now Cherokee has to think about\nthat idea and somewhere along the line,\n\n89\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.340\nthat means I didn't communicate enough,\nis what it normally ends up being,\n\n90\n00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.630\nis that somehow I didn't do that.\n\n91\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.800\nNow, what is the result of\nsomething like that and\n\n92\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.950\nthat's what we need to ask Cherokee\nis what the overall result is.\n\n93\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.920\nNow at the beginning of\nsomething like this,\n\n94\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.390\nif Cherokee started, hopefully not by 50%\non every task that I assign Cherokee.\n\n95\n00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.710\nBut I know she's laughing at me but I'm\nsaying that if we start doing this, right?\n\n96\n00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.610\nAt the beginning,\nit doesn't really seem to matter.\n\n97\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.890\nSo let's take for an example that\nwe have a month long project.\n\n98\n00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.030\nSo Cherokee, if it's a month long project,\nlet's say we take ten tasks a week.\n\n99\n00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.251\nOkay, at $100,\nthat should be $1000, right?\n\n100\n00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:40.810\nSo at the end of the first week, you turn\nin all those expenses for those ten tasks.\n\n101\n00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.280\nAnd you now spent $1500.\n\n102\n00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.645\nWell then at first we go, okay.\n\n103\n00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:49.210\nCherokee goes, it happens, that's fine.\n\n104\n00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.500\nSecond week, we do the same thing,\nwell now all of a sudden,\n\n105\n00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.510\nshe's turned in another $1500.\n\n106\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.250\nAnd I now start to go, okay so\nsecond week, she told me it happens again.\n\n107\n00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.080\nOkay I have to accept it at this point.\n\n108\n00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.900\nNow, what if though?\n\n109\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.270\nOkay let's take it this way.\n\n110\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.850\nWhat if the original budget that I\nhad planned for this month's task.\n\n111\n00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.190\nSo let's say about 400 of these smaller,\n40 of these.\n\n112\n00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.925\nI'm trying to make sure\nI'm adding them up right.\n\n113\n00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:21.925\n40 of these particular tasks and\nit was $1,000 for each week.\n\n114\n00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:24.470\n$4,000.\n\n115\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.995\nWell now at this point in time,\ntwo weeks into the project,\n\n116\n00:06:27.995 --> 00:06:32.230\nCherokee how much have you\nspent according to my scenario?\n\n117\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I behaved I have spent $8,000.\n\n118\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.620\n&gt;&gt; No, right now.\n\n119\n00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.550\nYeah, if you behaved, if it's actually\nthe idea of $4,000 for that whole month.\n\n120\n00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.520\n&gt;&gt; You're only supposed to\nspend a thousand each week and\n\n121\n00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.420\nyou spent 1,500 each week.\n\n122\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.888\nYou're already up at $3,000.\n\n123\n00:06:48.888 --> 00:06:49.490\n&gt;&gt; 3,000.\n\n124\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.160\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n\n125\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.900\n&gt;&gt; So now Cherokee's up at $3,000 for\n\n126\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.150\ntwo weeks and I only had $4,000 for\nthe whole month.\n\n127\n00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.860\nSo now Cherokee comes to\nme in that third week and\n\n128\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.930\nshe turns another $1,500 expense.\n\n129\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.840\nWell the problem is I had $4,000.\n\n130\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.195\nCherokee, you are now up to $4,500.\n\n131\n00:07:13.195 --> 00:07:17.340\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n132\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.810\nIt means one I'm over budget,\n\n133\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.390\nin other words I don't have the money\nto say, Cherokee that's fine.\n\n134\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.170\nWe're still okay here.\n\n135\n00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.720\nI'm now drawn in to February's contract or\nwhatever it is.\n\n136\n00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.220\nTo pull money to pay for\nwhat Cherokee spent so far.\n\n137\n00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.710\nNow this is where I have project\nmanagement too late in terms of cost.\n\n138\n00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.610\nSo now what do I do, Cherokee,\nif I go Cherokee, hear this.\n\n139\n00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.540\nLet me lay down the facts\nin this meeting right now.\n\n140\n00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.069\nI had $4,000 for this month,\nyou spent 4,500.\n\n141\n00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:56.948\nSo this last week, what do you think I\nmight actually have to ask you to do for\n\n142\n00:07:56.948 --> 00:07:58.114\nthat final week?\n\n143\n00:07:58.114 --> 00:08:01.027\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably provide the receipt so\n\n144\n00:08:01.027 --> 00:08:04.683\nyou can go ahead and perform an audit to\nsee if there's any kind of unforeseen\n\n145\n00:08:04.683 --> 00:08:07.710\nexpenses that should have been\naccounted for originally.\n\n146\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, that's a great idea, okay.\n\n147\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.670\nSo something like that actually does work.\n\n148\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.480\nBut now as a project manager though,\nright, I'm suppose to keep on schedule.\n\n149\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.810\nAnd it's not like I'd go,\nokay Cherokee, yeah,\n\n150\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.960\nyou can't spend anymore, we're just\ngonna stop the project at 75%, right?\n\n151\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.418\nBut, what I start to tell Cherokee is,\nCherokee,\n\n152\n00:08:28.418 --> 00:08:33.395\nyou need to find ways that we can cut,\n[LAUGH] we can cut that\n\n153\n00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:38.805\nfinal week's budget, so\nthat it at least looks okay, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:38.805 --> 00:08:40.060\nSo, what does that mean?\n\n155\n00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.931\nThat means now Cherokee has\nto go back to her team and\n\n156\n00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:48.714\nsay, what can we afford to cut corners on,\nthat reduces that?\n\n157\n00:08:48.714 --> 00:08:52.460\nShe can actually start looking out,\nand saying, okay,\n\n158\n00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.360\nwhat does Ronnie mean by this\nrequirement needs to be?\n\n159\n00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.370\nCan I trim that a little bit\non this particular task?\n\n160\n00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.870\nDo I really need to make sure\nthat everything is finished up or\n\n161\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.720\ncan I just show that it is\nfinished at this point?\n\n162\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.680\nI know Cherokee wouldn't do anything like\nthat, but let's say that that's what I\n\n163\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.020\nreally intimate for her to do,\nis that she needs to do that.\n\n164\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:20.200\nWell, what does that mean overall for the\nentirety of the project constrain itself?\n\n165\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.170\nIt means that constraint has now\nforced me to cut deliverables, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.480\nThe cost itself because I\ndon't have any money to spend,\n\n167\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.870\nnow makes me try to tell Cherokee,\nthat's it.\n\n168\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.825\nWe don't have anymore money,\nyou already spent $500 to $1000 more and\n\n169\n00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:38.910\nI took it out of next month's budget\nwhich means, they're gonna be behind.\n\n170\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.738\nSo Cherokee, right now, the final week.\n\n171\n00:09:41.738 --> 00:09:44.650\nYou know, you've got to make\nit on the paper thin budget\n\n172\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.730\nthat we possibly can, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.260\nAt this point or\nthere is not going to be any money.\n\n174\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.780\nImagine that that\ncontinues to happen though.\n\n175\n00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.125\nLets say that the project was year long.\n\n176\n00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:54.790\nCherokee turned in that for\nthe first three months.\n\n177\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.470\nAnd now we are actually so\nfar behind on just money being spent\n\n178\n00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.190\nthat after six months I have to say,\nguys we don't have any money.\n\n179\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.280\nWe're done.\n\n180\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.408\nSo this is why it's very important\nthat as far as overspending goes,\n\n181\n00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:10.838\nthat we try and go what?\n\n182\n00:10:10.838 --> 00:10:11.840\nWe don't overspend.\n\n183\n00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.930\nThat makes the most logical\nsense in the world.\n\n184\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.390\nOkay, but let's go the other way.\n\n185\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:20.330\nOkay, let's also say,\nwhat if now Cherokee does better.\n\n186\n00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.834\nEvery week instead of $1,000,\nshe turns in $800.\n\n187\n00:10:23.834 --> 00:10:29.030\nWell I'm probably happy as a clam, because\nI'm just, yes, I've got more money to go.\n\n188\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.540\nBut where I need to actually ask better\nquestions, is I need to go to Cherokee\n\n189\n00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.150\neach week and go, Cherokee, I'm not\nsaying that you had to spend a thousand,\n\n190\n00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.630\nbecause I really don't want you to.\n\n191\n00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.535\nBut why didn't you spend that thousand?\n\n192\n00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:44.210\nRonnie, as project\nmanager might just be so\n\n193\n00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.900\nhappy like Cherokee didn't spend all\nthe money for the project, okay.\n\n194\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.710\nAnd if she didn't spend all the money for\na project, that means I can actually take\n\n195\n00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.580\nthat and apply it to something\na little bit later on.\n\n196\n00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.300\nMight be possible but if she didn't,\n\n197\n00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.340\nnow I have to actually start asking\nthe very fact of, why didn't she?\n\n198\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.730\nWhat is going on here?\n\n199\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.910\nWhat didn't she get fulfilled?\n\n200\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.760\n&gt;&gt; Did we buy a generic item that\nmight not have that higher quality?\n\n201\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.910\nOr did I not pay some employees\novertime to go ahead and\n\n202\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.920\ntest an application before I roll it out?\n\n203\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.080\nSo those are all good\nquestions you might have.\n\n204\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.980\n&gt;&gt; And, you should, okay so\nthis is one that's very important\n\n205\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.470\nwhen we set this idea of budget that\nwe come in close or around that.\n\n206\n00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.750\nNow that doesn't mean that I should\nsit and go Cherokee just go ahead and\n\n207\n00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.760\nspend the other 200 on something, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.440\n&gt;&gt; Shopping.\n\n209\n00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's not the goal.\n\n210\n00:11:31.835 --> 00:11:33.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting that\n\n211\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.320\nthat's the first place that Cherokee\nwent is the idea of shopping.\n\n212\n00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.120\nBut overall though,\nit means we need to take a closer look so\n\n213\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.890\nthat's why it's very important\nthat we keep an eye and\n\n214\n00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.530\nwe actually understand the influence\nthat the constraint has on us.\n\n215\n00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:52.200\nIt's not always just about the idea of\nmaking sure we don't go over budget.\n\n216\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.930\nIt's about making sure that we\nactually have scheduled it out and\n\n217\n00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.330\nthat we're paying for\nwhat we said we're paying for.\n\n218\n00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.200\nWhether it's Cherokee's example of\nthe right quality stuff, Cherokee goes,\n\n219\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.670\nwell I thought we'd save a little\nbit of money by going to this.\n\n220\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.560\nAnd I go, I should say,\ndid that meet the quality standards for\n\n221\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.310\nwhat we needed it to meet, cuz this is\ngoing to be under stress, under load here.\n\n222\n00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.375\nAnd all of a sudden\nCherokee goes I don't know.\n\n223\n00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:19.740\nWell, that's when I go-\n&gt;&gt; But if I've saved $500 on my insurance.\n\n224\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.704\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you saved $500,\n\n225\n00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:21.830\nyeah ,that's right\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.997\n&gt;&gt; So, so when you have\n\n227\n00:12:22.997 --> 00:12:26.226\nsomething like that it does\nsound like it's logical but\n\n228\n00:12:26.226 --> 00:12:29.191\nin project management it\nis about understanding.\n\n229\n00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:32.330\nLike where did the spending go or\nwhy didn't it get spend as well okay.\n\n230\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.350\nSo very important concept which we start\ndealing with constraints we realizing\n\n231\n00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.390\nit's about being on a budget, period.\n\n232\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.636\nWhen you start taking a look at that,\nokay.\n\n233\n00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.830\nSo along with that then of course,\ncomes the other two constraints, so\n\n234\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.695\nwe also need to talk about as well.\n\n235\n00:12:46.695 --> 00:12:49.330\nOkay, so\nwhen we start to take a look then,\n\n236\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.200\nwe need to move on to the issue of scope,\nis what we need to do, okay.?\n\n237\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie you gave us an example\npreviously about that military vehicle.\n\n238\n00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.310\nAnd you mentioned scope creep and\nhow it can slowly but\n\n239\n00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.998\nsurely grow to an enormous size.\n\n240\n00:13:03.998 --> 00:13:06.730\nSo I could only imagine that that would\nhave to be something we have to look at\n\n241\n00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.670\nhere as well.\n\n242\n00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.580\n&gt;&gt; It really is,\n\n243\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:14.140\nbecause the very fact is we don't notice\nincremental growth in that way, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.906\nProbably nobody in the example that\nI mentioned in another episode about\n\n245\n00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:23.905\nthe Bradley Fighting Vehicle,\nwhere it actually went from about a $1.5\n\n246\n00:13:23.905 --> 00:13:27.987\nmillion project to a $14\nbillion project over 17 years.\n\n247\n00:13:27.987 --> 00:13:33.930\nNobody realized it would end up expanding\nlike that at any particular point in time.\n\n248\n00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:38.811\nAnd you might be wondering how could\nthey not have noticed $1.5 million\n\n249\n00:13:38.811 --> 00:13:42.200\nversus $14 million dollar expansion.\n\n250\n00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.698\nAnd that is because of something that\nwe call the idea of incremental scope\n\n251\n00:13:45.698 --> 00:13:46.477\ncreep, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:46.477 --> 00:13:50.940\nIt's not like somebody just\nsaid yesterday, that here\n\n253\n00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.140\nis the original scope of the project and\nthis is what we're gonna turn it into.\n\n254\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:54.700\n&gt;&gt; Shell shock.\n\n255\n00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it wasn't a transformer,\n\n256\n00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.670\nthey weren't looking to\nmake a transformer, okay?\n\n257\n00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.300\nBut what happen is like what you do\nsee in the movie, Pentagon Wars,\n\n258\n00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.873\nwhich is the most,\nit's funny, it's ironic, but\n\n259\n00:14:06.873 --> 00:14:11.771\nit's sad at the same time where it\nwas presented and accepted as it was.\n\n260\n00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:14.190\nAnd then at the very end\nthe general just says,\n\n261\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.230\nwe gotta actually put\na bigger gun on that.\n\n262\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.530\nNobody's gonna care about that little 20,\nit's not gonna do anything by\n\n263\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.140\nhaving that little 20-millimeter\ngun the front of that vehicle.\n\n264\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.110\nSo it was just what, it was just,\nby the way let's do this, right?\n\n265\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.930\nAnd those are little, tiny things\nthat now all of a sudden add up.\n\n266\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:37.620\nSo it's the same as you hear the idea of\nthe straw that broke the camel's back.\n\n267\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.780\nAnd this is why the idea of understanding\nthe scope or the quality requirements is\n\n268\n00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.860\nvery much something we normally need\nto keep constrained very much so.\n\n269\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.880\nSo usually the project manager is working,\ntrying to make sure that he keeps a very\n\n270\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:58.510\nfine line of what this project is\nreally about and what to exclude.\n\n271\n00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.720\nIf you don't know that,\n\n272\n00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.410\nif you don't know what to exclude,\nvery difficult to keep it out.\n\n273\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.900\nBecause there's always justification\non why you should add it in.\n\n274\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.980\nI guarantee you there's enough\nvoices to haunt you, and\n\n275\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.649\nto constantly cry at you that you\nshould add this into your project.\n\n276\n00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.690\nVery rarely do you have somebody coming\nalong who has a vested interest in\n\n277\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:23.570\nthe project that says, no way you should\njust eliminate that right now, especially\n\n278\n00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.340\nif it's their area of where they\nreally want the vested interest to be.\n\n279\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.690\nSo we want to make sure that we\nunderstand that idea as well.\n\n280\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.960\nSo let's take a look at\nmy screen here just for\n\n281\n00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.570\na moment and we'll full screen this\njust briefly here to help us out.\n\n282\n00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.880\nSo remember that in\ntraditional project management,\n\n283\n00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.490\nthe one over here on the left\nwith the white triangle, okay?\n\n284\n00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.571\nSo usually, when we talked about\nthis idea of keeping them balanced,\n\n285\n00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.043\nthat's what we really wanna do.\n\n286\n00:15:49.043 --> 00:15:52.837\nBut normally the requirement\nthat is fixed for us, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:54.681\nThe one that really\ndoesn't move very often.\n\n288\n00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:58.796\nIs that idea of\nthe requirements themselves.\n\n289\n00:15:58.796 --> 00:16:03.053\nNow, if you tend to move towards the agile\ntype of methodology in management.\n\n290\n00:16:03.053 --> 00:16:07.719\nWell now schedule and time become the\nconstraints that really are set in stone\n\n291\n00:16:07.719 --> 00:16:12.530\nfor us to meet the incremental types\nof requirements that we need to.\n\n292\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.538\nSo you've got understand which one of\nthese that you're really gonna have to\n\n293\n00:16:16.538 --> 00:16:20.069\ndeal with, but requirement normally\nis the one that wins out here.\n\n294\n00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:23.530\nAnd making sure that it doesn't grow,\nmaking sure it doesn't shrink,\n\n295\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.380\nunless it really has to,\nis pretty much the key.\n\n296\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.390\nCuz any move in that ends up\ncosting us more usually, and\n\n297\n00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.920\nends up delaying the project,\nwhich of course is gonna be time itself.\n\n298\n00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.244\nAnd that's why we want to make sure that\nwe understand that by not understanding\n\n299\n00:16:39.244 --> 00:16:45.051\nthe influence behind these, it's really\ngonna affect your project overall, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:48.788\nRight, so\nthere is that idea of both cost and then-\n\n301\n00:16:48.788 --> 00:16:52.102\n&gt;&gt; Resources deliverables.\n\n302\n00:16:52.102 --> 00:16:55.828\n&gt;&gt; Resources, yeah, and\ndeliverables and requirements as stuff.\n\n303\n00:16:55.828 --> 00:16:59.480\nBut that also leaves us with\nthe issues of, what time as well.\n\n304\n00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.228\nAnd we also need to take a look at\nthat for a moment as well, okay?\n\n305\n00:17:02.228 --> 00:17:04.468\nSo when it comes down to,\n\n306\n00:17:04.468 --> 00:17:10.670\nwhat is it that time does when we\ncant manage it very well, okay?\n\n307\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.936\nIs that time management is so important\nin terms of a project because of what?\n\n308\n00:17:14.936 --> 00:17:16.991\nThere has to be a definite beginning and\n\n309\n00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:19.366\nthere has to be a definite\nend to the project.\n\n310\n00:17:19.366 --> 00:17:23.462\nWhat happens when we don't manage it is\nusually what we call overruns at this\n\n311\n00:17:23.462 --> 00:17:24.740\npoint, okay?\n\n312\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.860\nThe idea of overruns tends to happen\nin many ways, but it actually again,\n\n313\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.480\ninfluences the other ones in\ntremendous ways too, right?\n\n314\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.520\nSo if you actually on a time over run,\nremember that means overtime sometimes.\n\n315\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.642\nSo that you can trying finish\nexactly on time, if you need to.\n\n316\n00:17:41.642 --> 00:17:45.041\nBut it can also mean that the project\nthat should goes overtime is so\n\n317\n00:17:45.041 --> 00:17:46.748\ntaking you to finish something.\n\n318\n00:17:46.748 --> 00:17:48.860\nYou take two years to finish something and\n\n319\n00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.280\nthat means the project made\nthat she doubled in it's cost.\n\n320\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.310\nYou wanna take a look at an example of\nanother particular project that should\n\n321\n00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:01.640\nhave been a very well run,\nfairly efficient project management.\n\n322\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.010\nBut a large project management site is to\n\n323\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:10.470\ngo onto a project management website and\ntake a look at what they call the big dig.\n\n324\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:14.980\nIt's a tunnel in Massachusetts in\nwhich they haven't finished it.\n\n325\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.628\nEven now and I started,\nI dont know when, okay?\n\n326\n00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:22.189\nSo at this point that particular project\nitself has grown way beyond what they have\n\n327\n00:18:22.189 --> 00:18:23.718\nhad in terms of time.\n\n328\n00:18:23.718 --> 00:18:30.350\nBut they can't even project what the final\ncost of that project is gonna be,\n\n329\n00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.830\nbecause they have no clue when\nit's suppose to end, okay.\n\n330\n00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.790\nSo time and project management,\nyou have to realize that if you don't\n\n331\n00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.060\nmanage this well, you're gonna in\nno runs period no matter what.\n\n332\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.753\nWhether you're talking about time, or\nwhether you're talking about cost,\n\n333\n00:18:43.753 --> 00:18:45.362\nit's just gonna end up happening too,\nokay?\n\n334\n00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:51.802\nAll right, so that leads us to our\nlast little bit of information here.\n\n335\n00:18:51.802 --> 00:18:54.909\nWhich is the idea of\nthe environmental factors,\n\n336\n00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:58.940\nof all the things in which we\ncan be constrained about, right?\n\n337\n00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.950\nThe most generic ones,\nwhat we've mentioned so far, right?\n\n338\n00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:07.714\nThe idea of cost, scope and time,\nall those seem pretty much kind of key.\n\n339\n00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:11.192\nBut another one that we have to worry\nabout is the context of environment.\n\n340\n00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:14.170\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nwhat kind of environmental factors must-\n\n341\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.854\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:17.734\n&gt;&gt; We consider as constraints,\n\n343\n00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:19.018\nwork constraints?\n\n344\n00:19:19.018 --> 00:19:21.518\n&gt;&gt; Well if we want to talk\nabout environmental factors,\n\n345\n00:19:21.518 --> 00:19:23.414\nwe can take it in multiple ways, right?\n\n346\n00:19:23.414 --> 00:19:28.758\nThe idea of just the weather\nitself can be a constraint.\n\n347\n00:19:28.758 --> 00:19:34.248\nTo kind of give you an example\nof that you deal with.\n\n348\n00:19:34.248 --> 00:19:38.760\nSo here it is, we are here in Florida,\nright here in the United States.\n\n349\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.573\nNow, most of you that are living\nsomewhere else on the planet,\n\n350\n00:19:41.573 --> 00:19:42.912\nyou may not understand this.\n\n351\n00:19:42.912 --> 00:19:47.775\nBut in Florida, we generally have great\nweather just about all year round, but\n\n352\n00:19:47.775 --> 00:19:51.126\nwe do have to deal with what\nwe call hurricanes, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:51.126 --> 00:19:53.553\nAnd so even if you have a project,\n\n354\n00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:58.075\nlet's say you're working on\na housing development, okay?\n\n355\n00:19:58.075 --> 00:20:00.933\nAnd hurricanes come through, you might go,\n\n356\n00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:05.820\nthe hurricane's going north of us,\nit's not even gonna hit us, okay?\n\n357\n00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.500\nSo why is that going to be\nan influence on my project?\n\n358\n00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.920\nWell, remember because of where\nwe are in the United States,\n\n359\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.784\na lot of the materials that we would use-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Supplies, exactly.\n\n360\n00:20:14.784 --> 00:20:19.320\n&gt;&gt; In terms of construction is supplies,\nand they have to be trucked in.\n\n361\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.900\nAnd we're at the southeast\nend of the United States, and\n\n362\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.260\nif it were trucked in from the northeast,\nfrom the west, from the northwest.\n\n363\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.030\nThat means they all have to actually\nbe funneled down through into Florida.\n\n364\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:34.742\nAnd that means, if there's inclement\nweather, blizzard, hurricane,\n\n365\n00:20:34.742 --> 00:20:38.654\nearthquakes, stuff like that,\nwhich affect the roadways.\n\n366\n00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:41.562\nWell we actually have to worry\nabout dealing with that for\n\n367\n00:20:41.562 --> 00:20:43.750\nthe rest of our project as well.\n\n368\n00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.394\nSo we can take a look at\nweather in that sense, and\n\n369\n00:20:46.394 --> 00:20:50.974\nrealize that's a constraint that we've got\nto learn how to adjust and deal with it,\n\n370\n00:20:50.974 --> 00:20:53.385\nand may the lay out projects incredibly.\n\n371\n00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:57.346\nSeveral years ago here in Florida,\nfour hurricanes moved through\n\n372\n00:20:57.346 --> 00:21:01.270\nthe state in a matter of very two or\nthree months, right?\n\n373\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.561\nAnd you might think big deal after these\ntwo to three months everybody can get\n\n374\n00:21:04.561 --> 00:21:05.243\nback on track.\n\n375\n00:21:05.243 --> 00:21:08.366\nExcept that if you live south of here,\nthere were\n\n376\n00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:13.330\ncomplete construction projects that\nwere now covered over by a silt, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.960\nIn other words, just dirt.\n\n378\n00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.610\nNow you might be wondering why is that\nimportant in terms of delivery of trucks\n\n379\n00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.760\nand logistics.\n\n380\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:25.030\nThe reason why it's very important here is\nbecause of what actually happened, right?\n\n381\n00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.832\nSo as truck drivers came down to deliver\ntheir loads after not being able to get in\n\n382\n00:21:28.832 --> 00:21:32.378\nthose areas, they realized something,\nthe roadways were gone, okay?\n\n383\n00:21:32.378 --> 00:21:37.238\nIn another words they couldn't even tell\nwhere roads were versus where was grass.\n\n384\n00:21:37.238 --> 00:21:39.354\nI mean it was just completely gone.\n\n385\n00:21:39.354 --> 00:21:42.323\n&gt;&gt; And if you think about it even down\nin the Keys, I live down in the south,\n\n386\n00:21:42.323 --> 00:21:43.818\nthere's one way in and one way out.\n\n387\n00:21:43.818 --> 00:21:47.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so when those things get\nblocked up, I mean so weather itself is\n\n388\n00:21:47.885 --> 00:21:52.610\na very much a constraint that you've\ngotta deal with on projects like that.\n\n389\n00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.500\nThe other one of course,\nmay be social responsibility as well.\n\n390\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.473\nYou might find out something on, I can't\neven think about a project right now.\n\n391\n00:21:59.473 --> 00:22:04.478\nBut you might find out that the actual\nsocial climate of things that might have\n\n392\n00:22:04.478 --> 00:22:09.181\nbeen acceptable a year ago,or two\nyears ago, may no longer be that way.\n\n393\n00:22:09.181 --> 00:22:13.980\nSo I don't know why it just slipped\n\n394\n00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.958\nright through my head here.\n\n395\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:21.828\nBut let's think about the idea\nof someone coming in and\n\n396\n00:22:21.828 --> 00:22:24.531\nsetting up an amusement park, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:24.531 --> 00:22:25.457\n&gt;&gt; Yehey.\n\n398\n00:22:25.457 --> 00:22:26.786\n&gt;&gt; Michael, yeah!\n\n399\n00:22:26.786 --> 00:22:29.634\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's wonderful, that's beautiful, but\n\n400\n00:22:29.634 --> 00:22:32.490\nthen everyone of your neighbours go,\nthere's no way-\n\n401\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.338\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:22:33.338 --> 00:22:34.508\n&gt;&gt; We don't want that noise.\n\n403\n00:22:34.508 --> 00:22:35.614\n&gt;&gt; And traffic.\n\n404\n00:22:35.614 --> 00:22:37.357\n&gt;&gt; Traffic, and all that other stuff,\n\n405\n00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:38.490\nwe don't want that to-\n\n406\n00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.407\n&gt;&gt; Hoodlums-\n&gt;&gt; Actually be constant.\n\n407\n00:22:39.407 --> 00:22:40.392\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:41.572\n&gt;&gt; Hoodlums coming in,\n\n409\n00:22:41.572 --> 00:22:46.156\nhaving a good time, and so you might find\nout something you don't have that ability\n\n410\n00:22:46.156 --> 00:22:50.810\nto push that through anymore, and\nyou've gotta realize it as well, okay?\n\n411\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.851\nIf you work for a larger enough company,\nyou might find out something as well.\n\n412\n00:22:53.851 --> 00:22:57.420\nThey don't like your project,\nand what do you have to do?\n\n413\n00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.630\nThis is still the ideal environment,\nright?\n\n414\n00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.765\nYou still have to work\nwith this people and\n\n415\n00:23:01.765 --> 00:23:04.449\nwhat you might find out that\nit's more difficult for\n\n416\n00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:08.306\nyou to get access to resources that\nyou might have find readily available.\n\n417\n00:23:08.306 --> 00:23:13.179\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the county that I'm from,\nthey kind of have this concept to\n\n418\n00:23:13.179 --> 00:23:17.226\nkeep the old Florida culture,\nwhich I understand that.\n\n419\n00:23:17.226 --> 00:23:21.582\nBut it is for development,\nnew businesses, new construction.\n\n420\n00:23:21.582 --> 00:23:25.786\nThere are a lot of additional fees,and a\nlot of extra hoops that you have to go to\n\n421\n00:23:25.786 --> 00:23:28.520\njust to kind of keep that social concept.\n\n422\n00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.019\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so any of these things,\n\n423\n00:23:30.019 --> 00:23:33.077\nwhether you're talking about\nsocial concept, internal politics,\n\n424\n00:23:33.077 --> 00:23:36.146\nthese are all kind of bellweather\nthings that you have to worry about.\n\n425\n00:23:36.146 --> 00:23:39.676\nBecause you might find yourself ready to\nstart, and then your company says, yeah,\n\n426\n00:23:39.676 --> 00:23:41.176\nwe're not gonna do that right now.\n\n427\n00:23:41.176 --> 00:23:44.285\nBecause we're dealing with so\nmany other things, so\n\n428\n00:23:44.285 --> 00:23:49.360\nyou do have to worry about all of these,\nand they all do end up costing you.\n\n429\n00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.736\nWhether it's your entire project,\nthey cost you time, they cost you money,\n\n430\n00:23:53.736 --> 00:23:55.208\ndon't have to deal with.\n\n431\n00:23:55.208 --> 00:23:59.498\nAnd in the end, you might find out your\ncompany just does a budget analysis and\n\n432\n00:23:59.498 --> 00:24:02.078\ngoes, look,\nwe can push this thing through.\n\n433\n00:24:02.078 --> 00:24:05.599\nBut with the additional fees like\nwhat Cherokee's talking about,\n\n434\n00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:07.832\nwe really can't we just can't afford to.\n\n435\n00:24:07.832 --> 00:24:10.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all that bureaucratic tape\ncan really shy people away from\n\n436\n00:24:10.913 --> 00:24:13.722\neven going to go ahead and\nstart their project in your area.\n\n437\n00:24:13.722 --> 00:24:18.133\n&gt;&gt; So you imagine then that every single\nproject may have some one of these,\n\n438\n00:24:18.133 --> 00:24:22.835\nif not all of these different types of\nconstraints depending on the size, and\n\n439\n00:24:22.835 --> 00:24:25.870\nof course, the nature of that project.\n\n440\n00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.830\nSo learning how to deal with constraints\nis in the realm of project managers and\n\n441\n00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.992\nwe should take a look at those influences.\n\n442\n00:24:31.992 --> 00:24:37.347\nAnd those constraints to really help us to\ndeal with the fact that, hey, all this is\n\n443\n00:24:37.347 --> 00:24:42.710\ngonna be under our particular direction,\nand under our navigation as well.\n\n444\n00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.000\nAnd so that's why you actually need\nto understand them a bit more.\n\n445\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.370\nSo that is pretty much all the constraints\nthat I have to deal with for right now.\n\n446\n00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.490\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell I think that sounds good, Ronnie.\n\n447\n00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:58.660\nThank you for taking the time to go ahead\nand show us the ways we can go ahead and\n\n448\n00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.520\npredict any kind of constraints and\ninfluences for our projects.\n\n449\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.112\nAnd thank you guys for tuning in today.\n\n450\n00:25:05.112 --> 00:25:06.868\nWe have some more project\nplus coming your way.\n\n451\n00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:09.115\nSo stay tuned for that,\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n452\n00:25:09.115 --> 00:25:10.131\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n453\n00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:11.067\n&gt;&gt; Have a great one, bye.\n\n454\n00:25:11.067 --> 00:25:19.384\n[MUSIC]\n\n455\n00:25:19.384 -->

00:00:12.346\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:15.144\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:17.270\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.460\nIn this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at CompTIA's Project+.\n\n7\n00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.090\nSpecifically, we'll be explaining\nrisk strategies and activities.\n\n8\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.370\nSo here with us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.930\nThank you for being here today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.190\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.330\nAs we take a look at this idea of risk\nmanagement we wanna make sure that\n\n12\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.769\nwe understand the importance of\nbeing able to manage a risk well.\n\n13\n00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.840\nAnd in that way we are gonna talk\nabout some of the strategies\n\n14\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.430\ndealing with the idea of risks and of\ncourse some of the activities we can do to\n\n15\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.230\nhelp us to identify risks a bit quicker.\n\n16\n00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.660\nAnd to be able to understand\nwhat impact that they have\n\n17\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.660\nas well as what we're gonna end up seeing,\nhow we as project managers are going to be\n\n18\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.580\nable to make decisions based on\nthe activities that we do as well.\n\n19\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.930\nSo that is what we're planning on for\nthis particular episode.\n\n20\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.800\nSo stay tuned as we continue on\nto take a look at the ideas.\n\n21\n00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.860\nNow if you've already been through any\ntype of project management training\n\n22\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.190\nyou've had kind of the fundamentals\nthat we're going through today.\n\n23\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.200\nBut we, of course, want you to\nbe ready for the exam as well so\n\n24\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.030\nwe're gonna take you through that too.\n\n25\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.450\nSo let's make sure that we understand.\n\n26\n00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.280\nRemember that a lot of times,\nespecially on this exam,\n\n27\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.840\nthe terminology's gonna be important so\nmake sure you also pay attention to\n\n28\n00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.920\nterminologies if the actual contents\nsound incredibly familiar to you.\n\n29\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.710\nSo that's where we're gonna begin and\ntake a look.\n\n30\n00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.368\nAnd then we will talk about some other\nthings we need to know as well, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:43.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie, I was going to go ahead\nand ask you, in other types of training or\n\n32\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.100\ncertification that you may have\nstudied we might have looked at some\n\n33\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.330\nrisk mitigation and so forth.\n\n34\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.884\nSo are there any kinds of specific\nrisks that are associated with project\n\n35\n00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:55.140\nmanagement that we should be aware of?\n\n36\n00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.020\nWell, when it comes down to\nproject management it's kind of\n\n37\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.770\na little bit unusual because of\nthe way that we tend to define risk\n\n38\n00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.210\nin security types of environments, right.\n\n39\n00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.425\nWhen you move into the realm of IT\nsecurity, when you hear the term risk,\n\n40\n00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:12.420\nokay, it's never really\nmentioned in a positive light.\n\n41\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.550\nBut in project management though,\n\n42\n00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.440\nrisk actually does have the tone of there\nbeing something in which is normally bad,\n\n43\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.580\nbut there can also be where you can\ninfer something good from it as well.\n\n44\n00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.010\nSo a lot of times what we have to be\nable to do as project managers then\n\n45\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.130\nis to make sure that we can identify\nthe differences in terms of risk,\n\n46\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.961\nwhether they're considered\nsomething positive or\n\n47\n00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:37.700\nwhether they're negative as well and we're\ngonna associate some words with those.\n\n48\n00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.260\nSo let's take a look at my screen as\nwe talk up some of these concepts.\n\n49\n00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.810\nSo the first thing that we want to\nunderstand is that in project management\n\n50\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.910\nthere are what we call risk threats.\n\n51\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.280\nAnd normally that brings on\na negative connotation, okay, for\n\n52\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.092\nwhat we actually are talking about.\n\n53\n00:02:53.092 --> 00:02:56.420\nAnd so when we start thinking\nabout the idea of a risk threat,\n\n54\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.995\nwe are normally thinking about\nthings like vulnerabilities,\n\n55\n00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:01.110\nokay, that we actually\nhave to worry about.\n\n56\n00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.615\nSo a vulnerability, for example, that's\na risk is that we rely on a contractor,\n\n57\n00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:11.190\nright, but the contractor that we've\nbeen dealing with, let's just say for\n\n58\n00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.720\nexample, has just retired and\nthey've now sold it out to a new company.\n\n59\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.550\nThe contract, they say,\nis still good and it still exists.\n\n60\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.300\nWell, that could actually\nbe a risky thing to say,\n\n61\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.530\nI've never dealt with this\nparticular contractor, even though\n\n62\n00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.670\nthat person has now bought this firm out\nand we're willing to deal with them.\n\n63\n00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.080\nSo you might actually\ntake a look at that and\n\n64\n00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.020\nthat might actually become a threat to\nyour project if you don't know that person\n\n65\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.050\nthat's actually there, you don't\ntrust fully yet what they can do.\n\n66\n00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.350\nI'm not saying it can't turn out to be\nan opportunity at the same time, but\n\n67\n00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.740\nthat's normally what we also have\nto understand as well, okay.\n\n68\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.960\nAlong with that, of course then, when we\nstart talking about risk management and\n\n69\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.940\nsome of the other things\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n70\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.760\nRisk management not only has do\nwhat identifying those things\n\n71\n00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.600\nas the threats and opportunities but\nalso analyzing their potential.\n\n72\n00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.850\nAnd we're gonna get into\nthe realm of quantitative and\n\n73\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.230\nqualitative risk analysis.\n\n74\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.790\nNow if those terms sounds\nlike kind of we're talking\n\n75\n00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.410\nin terms we don't normally speak in,\nyou're probably right but\n\n76\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.890\nwe'll break it down for\nyou and we'll talk about that.\n\n77\n00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.160\nAnd we're not gonna get into the most\ntechnical understanding of everything, but\n\n78\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.400\nwe'll at least show you\nexamples of them as well.\n\n79\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.460\n&gt;&gt; And for the remainder of the terms that\nyou do have on your display there, Ronnie,\n\n80\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.640\na lot of those, if you guys are studying\nfor other certifications like Security+,\n\n81\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.730\nthey probably look eerily similar,\nhint, hint.\n\n82\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n83\n00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.040\nthere's no doubt that\nyou'll see these terms.\n\n84\n00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.000\nAnd the reason why is that risk itself,\nokay, when we deal with them, okay,\n\n85\n00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.980\nthe key here is not to deal with\nthem any way that we feel, okay.\n\n86\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.290\nThey key word here believe it or not is\nactually this particular adjective right\n\n87\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.280\nhere, okay, or adverb I should say,\nappropriately responding, okay.\n\n88\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.560\nWe can all deal with risk, okay,\nin any fashion that we want to, okay.\n\n89\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.694\nThe problem is that a lot of those\nfashions, the way that we deal with risk,\n\n90\n00:05:02.694 --> 00:05:05.620\nthey're in appropriate ways\nthat we deal with risk, okay.\n\n91\n00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.050\nWe can run and throw a tantrum, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.920\nWe can run off and\nslug somebody right in the jaw.\n\n93\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.260\nThat doesn't necessary mitigate\nanything of risk that you have.\n\n94\n00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.330\nBut what we're talking about here,\nof course, is the appropriate manner\n\n95\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.340\nin responding to the risk that\nend up happening to your project.\n\n96\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.250\nSo the key, first of all then,\nis to identify\n\n97\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.205\nwhether we're talking about a risk, or a\nthreat or an opportunity in terms of risk,\n\n98\n00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:34.020\nokay, and then from that point here's\nusually how it breaks down, okay.\n\n99\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.620\nIn terms of opportunities,\nwe may transfer that risk, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.910\nWe may say, all right, I don't have\nthe time to deal with it right now, but\n\n101\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.150\nI see this as a potential opportunity and\nI want to ensure that for my future.\n\n102\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.790\nSo maybe where you invest in\nsomething a little bit later on and\n\n103\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.290\nwhat are you doing?\n\n104\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.880\nYou're putting essentially\na down payment towards that\n\n105\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.570\nif you want to do something, okay.\n\n106\n00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.970\nThe other ones are what we\ncall exploit and enhance.\n\n107\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.170\nAnd even though I've got them separated\nout as two different lines here,\n\n108\n00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.410\nthey're kind of very similar, okay.\n\n109\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.449\nThe idea of taking advantage of whatever\nopportunity it is that's presented.\n\n110\n00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.020\nNow at the same time, even though we might\nsee them as being an opportunity for\n\n111\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.680\nour future, other people may see\nthem as being a threat as well.\n\n112\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.720\nSo you might take advantage\nof an opportunity, for\n\n113\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.190\nsomebody that is called risk adverse,\nsays no way, I would never touch that.\n\n114\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.440\nIf you're risk neutral or you're actually\none of those people that enjoys being risk\n\n115\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.220\nactive, or what do they call it,\nI can't remember the actual proper term,\n\n116\n00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.530\nthat loves risk,\nembraces the idea of risk.\n\n117\n00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.650\n&gt;&gt; Fortune favors the bold.\n\n118\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, fortune favors the bold here.\n\n119\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.324\nYeah, that type of thing, you may\nchoose to go ahead and exploit that,\n\n120\n00:06:43.324 --> 00:06:47.173\nin other take advantage of it now and\nactually even do everything you can to\n\n121\n00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:50.060\nenhance the fact that\nthat risk may happen.\n\n122\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.020\nMost of us though take a look\nat risk as being negative.\n\n123\n00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.630\nSo usually for us in terms of the way that\nwe appropriately respond to them, we may\n\n124\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.720\ntalk about the idea of avoidance, in\nother words, just stay out of it as well.\n\n125\n00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.400\nWe have to accept it because there's\nreally nothing else we can do.\n\n126\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.200\nAnd then we can even mention\nthe idea of mitigation,\n\n127\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.480\nto minimize as much as we can when\ndealing with these different activities.\n\n128\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.610\nSo a lot of times you may want to\nactually take a look at this, okay.\n\n129\n00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.122\nSo the idea of avoidance here,\nokay, you may actually just say,\n\n130\n00:07:20.122 --> 00:07:24.080\nall right, in terms of just avoiding,\nyou don't deal with the risk.\n\n131\n00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.530\nSo if you think about something like that,\nokay, you have to kind of go, okay,\n\n132\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.610\nI didn't deal with it but\nwe'll accept it as it comes along.\n\n133\n00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.630\nSo let's give a very realistic\nexample of something that may happen\n\n134\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.500\non a project site, okay.\n\n135\n00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.460\nYou go, look, we've tried within a 100\nmile radius to rent every single\n\n136\n00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.470\ngenerator that will give me 50,000 volt or\n\n137\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.610\nwatts or above, okay, and\nthere's none available.\n\n138\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.250\nThey can't be here in time for\nwhat we need it, okay, to actually be.\n\n139\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.970\nSo instead what do you do?\n\n140\n00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.550\nDo you just kind of go,\nokay if power goes out, it goes out.\n\n141\n00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.460\nOkay, and that's what you have.\n\n142\n00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.624\n&gt;&gt; Get two smaller generators.\n\n143\n00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:02.584\n&gt;&gt; Yeah hopefully you can get two smaller\ngenerators, but what if you can't?\n\n144\n00:08:02.584 --> 00:08:05.061\nIn other words what if\nthose are actually gone?\n\n145\n00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:08.398\nSo at this point you just\nkind of accept the risk.\n\n146\n00:08:08.398 --> 00:08:11.810\nNow I even have a smaller\nexample which is fairly easy.\n\n147\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.810\nThat's a little bit more personal that it\nhelps us to understand the idea of just\n\n148\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.050\naccepting risk.\n\n149\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.130\nAnd that's why you go,\nlook I know a hurricane is coming through,\n\n150\n00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.050\nbut I'm just gonna stay put, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.730\nYou're actively saying that I don't\ncare what the hurricane brings\n\n152\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.070\nI'm just gonna stay put.\n\n153\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.070\nAnd, at that particular point in time,\nif you talk about the idea of power,\n\n154\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.560\nyou're staying put until the power\nactually comes back on for\n\n155\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.440\nyou to do something, so that could be it.\n\n156\n00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.670\nWhen you talk about the idea of\nmitigation, that's when you go to, well,\n\n157\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.450\ngenerators as well.\n\n158\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.290\nWhere you go, I know what I'm gonna do,\nnext time a power outage happens,\n\n159\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.540\nI'm gonna buy a generator and that way\npower goes out I have a generator on hand,\n\n160\n00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.040\nthat's the idea of mitigation as well.\n\n161\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.290\nSo there are different examples that you\ncan take a look at when you start dealing\n\n162\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.690\nwith this idea of taking a look\nat the idea of responding and\n\n163\n00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.930\nwhat we end up doing with this.\n\n164\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:07.730\nNow as easy as that sounds, those are all\ngood things that we can understand and\n\n165\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.570\nwe've got to keep these things in our\nmind as we start to deal with them.\n\n166\n00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.740\nBut sometimes, though,\nit's not as easy to identify, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:21.720\nIt's not very quick and scenarios\ndon't come to your mind as quickly.\n\n168\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.630\nSometimes they're actually technically\nchallenging to be able to understand\n\n169\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.310\nwhether it's something that I\nneed to deal with immediately or\n\n170\n00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.060\nwhether it's something I can put off.\n\n171\n00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.111\nWhether I can go ahead and\n\n172\n00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.200\nget insurance now or\ndo I need to do it a little bit later on.\n\n173\n00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.460\nSo what can you do at\nthat particular point\n\n174\n00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.080\nwhen you start to take a look here, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.910\nWell, this is when you get into\nthe realm of analysis a little bit more.\n\n176\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.160\nAnd the idea of analysis is simple,\n\n177\n00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.790\nbreaking it down into the smallest\ncomponents that gives us a measurable and\n\n178\n00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.650\nan understandable idea of what\nwe're dealing with, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:56.030\nAnd in that sense, in terms of risk,\nwe tend to always break it down into what\n\n180\n00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.060\nwe call a quantitative analysis or\na qualitative analysis.\n\n181\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.160\nAnd I've broken it down into four\nareas when you want to compare them\n\n182\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.930\nversus one another when we start talking\nabout in terms of project management.\n\n183\n00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:13.030\nSo here at the very beginning\nwhen we start to break this down,\n\n184\n00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.557\nQuantitative analysis versus Qualitative,\n\n185\n00:10:15.557 --> 00:10:21.100\nits overall scope is pretty much\nthe key aspect of this as well, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.474\nWhen you're dealing with Per Risk,\n\n187\n00:10:23.474 --> 00:10:29.050\nyou're taking a look at it essentially\nscenario by scenario, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.130\nEvery risk you are trying\nto determine that, and\n\n189\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.040\nthat is what we call a qualitative\ntype of analysis that we'll do.\n\n190\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.160\nBut if you're trying to determine the risk\nand what this does to your entire\n\n191\n00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.170\nproject here, you're probably gonna go for\nmore quantitative analysis, and\n\n192\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.970\nwe'll talk about what that\nreally means at the end here.\n\n193\n00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.713\nThe basis of qualitative analysis\nis essentially subjective,\n\n194\n00:10:50.713 --> 00:10:54.853\nwhereas quantitative it's data driven or\ndata based.\n\n195\n00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:57.627\nAnd that means they take\na bunch of numbers and\n\n196\n00:10:57.627 --> 00:11:02.591\nwe crunch those numbers together and the\nnumerical product that we get from those\n\n197\n00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:07.620\nnumbers give us the ability to then\ncreate what we call a risk rating, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:13.350\nA lot of times then we can take that and\ncompare it to other types of risk and\n\n199\n00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.430\nwe can now actually have them on\ncomparison chart as well, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.030\nThe other thing, of course, is the effort\nthat it takes for you to do this, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.370\nWhen you're only dong it\nscenario by scenario,\n\n202\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.370\nthe effort of this is actually\nrelatively easy and fast.\n\n203\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.830\nI take a look and go,\nall right, here it is Cherokee,\n\n204\n00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.980\nwe're in the last month\nof hurricane season.\n\n205\n00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:39.120\nWe watched national weather service, three\nhurricanes are projected to come through.\n\n206\n00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.320\nWell then Cherokee can start coming\nup with scenarios on her task and\n\n207\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.460\nsaying what is it that I need to\nunderstand here as far as a risk goes and\n\n208\n00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.420\nhow do we actually deal\nwith it at that point?\n\n209\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.780\n&gt;&gt; Incorporating past experiences,\nany kind of knowledge about the situation?\n\n210\n00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and dealing with everything\nthat you tend to deal with, but\n\n211\n00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.910\non a smaller scale here.\n\n212\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.300\nQualitative analysis works just as well,\nand\n\n213\n00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.530\nit doesn't take the time that\nquantitative analysis does.\n\n214\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.540\nBecause with numbers you have to\nfactor in a lot of different variables\n\n215\n00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.420\nbefore the numbers mean anything.\n\n216\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.790\nIt's the same thing with\nthings like polling data.\n\n217\n00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.960\nIf you have a small sample in poll,\n\n218\n00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.160\ndon't get me wrong you can work with some\nthings, but the larger the sampling is,\n\n219\n00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.290\nthe more reliable that particular\nnumber is going to be.\n\n220\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.470\nAnd the same thing here,\nif you want to talk about influences,\n\n221\n00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:34.019\nremember a single number can make\na change in whatever you're doing.\n\n222\n00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:37.070\nAnd that's why quantitative\nanalysis is time consuming.\n\n223\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.710\nIt takes a lot of time gathering the data.\n\n224\n00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.170\nIt takes a lot of time,\n\n225\n00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.640\nat least for me, cuz I'm no math whiz,\nto crunch through those numbers.\n\n226\n00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.820\nRegardless of the tools I have on hand,\neven data entry is a little bit hard for\n\n227\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.020\nme and you'll see as we go through some\nexamples of these in just a moment, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.960\nIn terms of tools it requires really\nyou to work through scenarios, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.770\nAnd you to talk this out and\nmaybe write down a few figures and\n\n230\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.280\nyour pro and con list of the things.\n\n231\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.190\nBut on this one it may ask you\nrequire a special type of tool.\n\n232\n00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:13.100\nIn other words, there are actually risk\ngenerators out there that really do\n\n233\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.700\ncrunch the numbers and take into effect\nthe variables, even location, time\n\n234\n00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.900\nof the year, the climate and the condition\ndepending on what you're working in.\n\n235\n00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.419\nIf you need something like that, you may\nactually have to take advantage of that,\n\n236\n00:13:26.419 --> 00:13:30.546\nwhich requires you to either rent that\nparticular type of software, or for\n\n237\n00:13:30.546 --> 00:13:34.460\nyou to actually buy some type\nof software like that as well.\n\n238\n00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.480\nSo in all of that you actually do need\nto understand, as a project manager,\n\n239\n00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.400\nat least the basis of how these\nnumbers are determined, and\n\n240\n00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.320\nthe way that they're determined.\n\n241\n00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.320\nIf you are making a full judgement for\n\n242\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.480\nthe entire project,\ntrust a quantitative analysis okay?\n\n243\n00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.086\nIf you're coming up on a situation in\nwhich you go, I really can't determine\n\n244\n00:13:57.086 --> 00:14:02.876\nthe risk very easily because there's not\nenough data available for me to do so.\n\n245\n00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:05.667\nThen qualitative analysis is\nprobably going to be the way to go,\n\n246\n00:14:05.667 --> 00:14:07.683\nbecause that's going to\nget you the numbers or\n\n247\n00:14:07.683 --> 00:14:11.180\ngoing to get you at least to that point\nwhere you can make a decision quicker.\n\n248\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.430\n&gt;&gt; Or if you're a green horn, and you\njust don't have that extra experience and\n\n249\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.620\nyou're not really sure,\n\n250\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.210\nyou can fall back on that factual\ncomponent there with the quantitative\n\n251\n00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.780\ninformation to help you make the decision\nuntil you do gain that experience as well.\n\n252\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.489\n&gt;&gt; True, okay, so\nlet's take a look at both here.\n\n253\n00:14:27.489 --> 00:14:31.482\nSo let's talk about this idea of\nqualitative analysis briefly and\n\n254\n00:14:31.482 --> 00:14:34.560\nlet me show you this idea\nof qualitative analysis.\n\n255\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.310\nSo let's take a look at my screen\nagain as we move through, okay.\n\n256\n00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:43.000\nIn qualitative analysis when we talk about\nrisk we're really trying to determine two\n\n257\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.140\nthings that really hit\nus in terms of risk.\n\n258\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.030\nOne is the idea of probability, okay?\n\n259\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.270\nSo for us we can talk about the rate\nof occurrence if we want to,\n\n260\n00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.170\nto actually take a look at that okay.\n\n261\n00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:00.790\nSo that one is not judged on a scale yet,\nexcept for high to low.\n\n262\n00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.317\nSo you might have people\nthat rate it as high,\n\n263\n00:15:03.317 --> 00:15:06.042\nand then medium, then low,\nlow medium high, or\n\n264\n00:15:06.042 --> 00:15:10.523\nyou might even have people that a little\nbit more structure it and break it down.\n\n265\n00:15:10.523 --> 00:15:16.310\nMedium high, low to medium,\nand then medium.\n\n266\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.130\nI mean, don't get me wrong you can\nbreak this down as much as you want to.\n\n267\n00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.910\nMe, I'm fairly simple.\n\n268\n00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.494\nYou see where I just put low and\nhigh, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:23.494 --> 00:15:25.700\nAnd the same thing with impact,\n\n270\n00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.800\nvery difficult to understand\nthis idea of impact overall.\n\n271\n00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.360\nBut somebody that is qualitatively driven\nright now for whatever scenario that\n\n272\n00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:41.290\nwe actually have, we may choose then to\nactually make a fairly simple type of\n\n273\n00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.960\nwhat we call risk matrix that helps\nus to identify this idea of risk.\n\n274\n00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.770\nSo let's say that we have four different\nscenarios here, Cherokee, and so\n\n275\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.430\nthe way that we do this is\nsomething like this, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.178\nNotice I didn't try to divide\nit up into 19 squares and\n\n277\n00:15:58.178 --> 00:16:00.187\na bunch of different things.\n\n278\n00:16:00.187 --> 00:16:02.181\nI just simply went ahead and\njust made a square out of this.\n\n279\n00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:04.759\n&gt;&gt; You saw my earlier chart,\nso that's not fair [LAUGH].\n\n280\n00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:11.853\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, but\nthis is just a brief example here.\n\n281\n00:16:11.853 --> 00:16:16.576\nOf course, when you start to take a look\nat this, what you do is you go ahead and\n\n282\n00:16:16.576 --> 00:16:18.640\nyou divide it up like this.\n\n283\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.990\nIn this quadrant over here on\nthe left-hand side, low probability,\n\n284\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.640\nlow impact.\n\n285\n00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:30.340\nWell, that to me means low risk, is what\nI would actually tend to think about.\n\n286\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.780\nBut notice as we move up here on\nthe left hand side, low impact and\n\n287\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.100\nhigh probability.\n\n288\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:42.390\nNotice we're still in the low side of the\nimpact and now high probability over here.\n\n289\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.640\n&gt;&gt; Older equipment but\nit's okay because you have a backup.\n\n290\n00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that, sure.\n\n291\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.950\nWe can do something like that.\n\n292\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.700\nAnd then of course,\nover here on the righthand side,\n\n293\n00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.160\nlow probability, high impact is\nsomething else that we can add.\n\n294\n00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.120\nAnd then of course,\nhigh probability, high impact.\n\n295\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.620\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be your line\nof business type applications.\n\n296\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.340\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, very good, Cherokee.\n\n297\n00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.795\nSteal all my thunder, why don't you?\n\n298\n00:17:05.795 --> 00:17:07.116\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, that's fine.\n\n299\n00:17:07.116 --> 00:17:08.890\nThat will actually work out for us.\n\n300\n00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.060\nBut it kinda lets you know\nat least at the most basic.\n\n301\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.770\nDon't get me wrong,\nyou can get a PhD in risk management.\n\n302\n00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.360\nThis is not the PhD,\n\n303\n00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.460\nthis is kinda the highschool-\n&gt;&gt; Introduction.\n\n304\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, highschool intro to\nthe idea of risk management.\n\n305\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.700\nBut think about doing\nsomething like this here.\n\n306\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.708\nSo let me see if I can actually get it to\ndo what I want to do, I love this tool,\n\n307\n00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:36.150\na little bit hard to work with, but I\nreally do love it, cuz this is so graphic.\n\n308\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:41.130\nSo, in this sense,\nlet me give Cherokee an example here.\n\n309\n00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.300\nAnd so what I want to take out\nis probability and impact.\n\n310\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:50.260\nSo, let's use the example of a comet,\nhitting the ITProTV studios.\n\n311\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.379\nIf you were to talk about\nthat in terms of probability.\n\n312\n00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:54.743\n&gt;&gt; Bottom right quadrant.\n\n313\n00:17:54.743 --> 00:18:00.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now how did you arrive\nat that bottom right quadrant?\n\n314\n00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.980\nWhat did you say in terms of probability?\n\n315\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.253\n&gt;&gt; I've never heard of a giant\nmeteor hitting ITProTV before, so\n\n316\n00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.035\nI'm gonna go by that.\n\n317\n00:18:09.035 --> 00:18:10.795\n&gt;&gt; So in other words,\nlow probability is what we're thinking.\n\n318\n00:18:10.795 --> 00:18:12.255\n&gt;&gt; Low probability, exactly.\n\n319\n00:18:12.255 --> 00:18:15.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because as many things\nthat hit the Earth's atmosphere,\n\n320\n00:18:15.745 --> 00:18:21.155\na lot of it burns up, but\nlet's say a giant meteor, that's the risk.\n\n321\n00:18:21.155 --> 00:18:23.630\nWell let's say low probability, but\n\n322\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:30.380\na meteor hitting ITProTV studio,\nthe impact is pretty high.\n\n323\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.690\nSo let's say,\nwe'll actually just put a mark out here.\n\n324\n00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.950\nMake sense?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n325\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.440\n&gt;&gt; So now let's go ahead and\ntake a look at something else happening.\n\n326\n00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:47.010\nI have a ten year old generator that has\nworked very well, but it is ten years old\n\n327\n00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:52.760\nand there's, let's say, 3,000 hours\non this particular generator and\n\n328\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:59.440\nits mean time between\nfailure is at 9,500 hours.\n\n329\n00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.290\nBut I have a backup generator.\n\n330\n00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.300\nWhat do you think as far as a risk goes?\n\n331\n00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.640\n&gt;&gt; Top left quadrant.\n\n332\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.430\n&gt;&gt; Top left quadrant?\n\n333\n00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.236\n&gt;&gt; For 200, please [LAUGH].\n\n334\n00:19:07.236 --> 00:19:08.280\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n335\n00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.900\nSo let's just go ahead and\nput that up here.\n\n336\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.900\nSo that's something like that\ncan actually happen as well.\n\n337\n00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.050\nNow, let's do something\na little bit stranger.\n\n338\n00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.300\nLet's just talk about the idea of weather.\n\n339\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.910\nSo if I sit there and go,\ntoday is a beautiful day.\n\n340\n00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:29.180\nI don't think it's going to rain, so\nI should be able to pour my concrete.\n\n341\n00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.180\nWhat do you think?\n\n342\n00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.039\nWell, unless you're in Kansas or\nsomewhere really unpredictable-\n\n343\n00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.396\n&gt;&gt; We're in Florida.\n\n344\n00:19:36.396 --> 00:19:38.060\n&gt;&gt; Bottom left quadrant.\n\n345\n00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:38.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.\n\n346\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.650\nI'm trying to make this relatively easy,\nso we'll do that.\n\n347\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:42.580\n&gt;&gt; No curve balls.\n\n348\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.790\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully no curve balls.\n\n349\n00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.120\nThe chances now of Ronnie actually\nsaying a sentence without stuttering.\n\n350\n00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.590\nNot high, let's just put that up here.\n\n351\n00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.483\nSo we'll do that.\n\n352\n00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:54.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm with you, I feel you.\n\n353\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but what you start doing is what?\n\n354\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.240\nYou take all the risks that are in\nthat immediate time period, or\n\n355\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:19:59.890\nwhatever scenario.\n\n356\n00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.870\nAnd all of a sudden you start to do what?\n\n357\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:06.079\nYou just start to mark them,\nhowever you want to.\n\n358\n00:20:08.896 --> 00:20:10.656\nAnd then you start to find out,\n\n359\n00:20:10.656 --> 00:20:13.570\nthat there's a number of\nrisks in certain areas and\n\n360\n00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:18.312\nall the sudden this actually tells you, if\nyou actually wanna put a rating on this,\n\n361\n00:20:18.312 --> 00:20:22.750\nlike here are the ones I know I definitely\nhave to have some plan of action for.\n\n362\n00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:29.620\nHere's the ones I really don't have a plan\nof action for because the probability\n\n363\n00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:34.070\nis low of it happening,\neven though it's impact is insanely high.\n\n364\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.110\n&gt;&gt; We might need to just\naddress that at some point.\n\n365\n00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we may just need to say all\nright, we'll address that at some point.\n\n366\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.200\nLow probability, low impact,\nI may not do anything at all.\n\n367\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.640\nThen that helps me out, and then of\ncourse, high up, you kind of get the idea.\n\n368\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.890\nYou may, after a time, move things around.\n\n369\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.576\nOops, I tried to, oops [LAUGH].\n\n370\n00:20:53.576 --> 00:20:54.732\n&gt;&gt; Big problem.\n\n371\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you may actually after a while,\n\n372\n00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.120\nfind out that a lot of the stuff\nreally actually ended up over here.\n\n373\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.150\nSo this gives you that\nqualitative type of analysis.\n\n374\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.890\nNotice we didn't make any figures or\nanything dealing with that\n\n375\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.200\nidea to try and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, fairly easy, fast.\n\n376\n00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah fairly easy, fairly fast,\nallowing us to do what we need to.\n\n377\n00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.810\nSo you can see something like this\nwhere it really does help out.\n\n378\n00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:23.260\nNow the other thing though, so just doing\nsomething like that is fairly easy and\n\n379\n00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.300\nthat's why we talk about\nqualitative analysis as being easy.\n\n380\n00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.130\nNow the other thing that we also need\nto take a look at then, of course,\n\n381\n00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:35.280\nis what we call a quantitative\nanalysis type of example.\n\n382\n00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.200\nNow, in this I've actually\ngo two different ones here.\n\n383\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.900\nI've got an opportunity and I've got risk.\n\n384\n00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.980\nSo here,\nwhat I've done is I've assigned a value.\n\n385\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.540\nNow, where the heck did\nthis value come from?\n\n386\n00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.780\nIt depends on whatever\nscale that you're using.\n\n387\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.330\nSo I've just used from a zero to one,\nis what I did.\n\n388\n00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:59.560\nNow once I did that, there's probably some\nformulas you can come up with to help you\n\n389\n00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.970\nout, but\nthis is how I actually assigned them.\n\n390\n00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.880\nRisk A, probability of happening,\nlet's say, it was 50% chance.\n\n391\n00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.490\nImpact, about 30%, and\nthat gives me a risk score.\n\n392\n00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.220\nMake sense?\n\n393\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.270\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Same thing with all the rest of these.\n\n394\n00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.080\nSo I actually went ahead and\nadded these up.\n\n395\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.341\nCuz I didn't want you to see me trying\nto actually figure out the math here.\n\n396\n00:22:17.341 --> 00:22:19.896\n&gt;&gt; When you squint to look at the screen.\n\n397\n00:22:19.896 --> 00:22:22.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, to do that.\n\n398\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.880\nSame thing with the idea of probability.\n\n399\n00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.580\nSo having all that stuff on\nhand really does help us out.\n\n400\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.900\nAnd you might be wondering, well what\nare we going to do with this data.\n\n401\n00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:40.410\nSo now, same thing that we did before\nin terms of the risk matrix here.\n\n402\n00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.680\nWhat I can actually do now,\nhopefully I can do this.\n\n403\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.370\n&gt;&gt; Triage.\n\n404\n00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can triage it.\n\n405\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.600\nBut this is the way that you also do this,\nbut\n\n406\n00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.540\na little bit more quantitatively instead.\n\n407\n00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.770\nNotice we're still dealing with\nthe ideas of probability and impact?\n\n408\n00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm still trying to let\nmy eyes adjust to that.\n\n409\n00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little bright then.\n\n410\n00:22:58.415 --> 00:23:00.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Stop picking on me.\n\n411\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.660\nSo there we go.\nSo\n\n412\n00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:06.920\nI have on one side the idea of threats and\non the other side opportunities here.\n\n413\n00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.240\nThis gives you that same ability,\nso instead I wrote this down so\n\n414\n00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.840\nthat we could see it here.\n\n415\n00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.248\nSo for risk A the risk score was 0.15.\n\n416\n00:23:16.248 --> 00:23:20.560\nSo that's gonna be a threat, cuz I called\nit a risk instead of an opportunity.\n\n417\n00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.990\nAnd I'll have to change this to\nsomething we can see on this board here.\n\n418\n00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.030\nSo we'll do that and we'll do that.\n\n419\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.850\nHopefully this will make sense.\n\n420\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.502\nSo 0.15, now let's say it's down here.\n\n421\n00:23:31.502 --> 00:23:32.840\n&gt;&gt; Plot it out.\n\n422\n00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.788\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you plot it out.\n\n423\n00:23:33.788 --> 00:23:39.690\nFor B, 0.16, I don't know if that's\nactually true but we'll do that.\n\n424\n00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:43.750\nAnd then for C here it was a 1.\n\n425\n00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.618\nSo a 1 and a 1.\n\n426\n00:23:45.618 --> 00:23:50.180\nThere we go.\n\n427\n00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.242\nSo we we're able to do that, there it is.\n\n428\n00:23:52.242 --> 00:23:56.323\nI've got 3 and then D was 0.375.\n\n429\n00:23:56.323 --> 00:24:01.356\nSo 0.375, let's say somewhere around here.\n\n430\n00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:05.560\nNow I could have actually done a little\nbit differently where what I have was\n\n431\n00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.962\nprobably 0.75 And\nthen you go up to .5 here, instead,\n\n432\n00:24:08.962 --> 00:24:12.470\nwhich is probably what\nshould have done with these.\n\n433\n00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.830\nSo, I'm trying to do that.\n\n434\n00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:18.783\nSo, let's say 0.5 is here,\nand then this one was 0.75.\n\n435\n00:24:18.783 --> 00:24:21.130\nAnd that's what that, oops,\nlet's see if I can do that.\n\n436\n00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:22.980\nSo, I needed that number.\n\n437\n00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.500\nAnd then the second one,\nI did the wrong one again.\n\n438\n00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:32.310\nSo, this was actually where the impact\nwas actually very high, like that.\n\n439\n00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:35.030\nAt least, that's what I'm hoping, okay?\n\n440\n00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.150\nSo, now you can take a look and\nrealize what do you do?\n\n441\n00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.820\nSo, you do the same thing\nwith the opportunities,\n\n442\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.100\nwe're not gonna worry about that one so\nmuch though.\n\n443\n00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.330\nBut realize that you do what?\n\n444\n00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.210\nYou actually have something that you\ndefinitely need to address in the red\n\n445\n00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:53.105\narea, something right here in terms of\nprobability in this kind of mustard area.\n\n446\n00:24:53.105 --> 00:24:54.211\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That visual.\n\n447\n00:24:54.211 --> 00:24:55.710\nNow the colors, they all, it makes sense.\n\n448\n00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.090\nIt's all coming together.\n\n449\n00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, isn't that weird?\n\n450\n00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.320\nYeah, I mean, it's like I actually\ndid something that I knew about.\n\n451\n00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:01.960\n&gt;&gt; You thought about it, yeah.\n\n452\n00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.210\n&gt;&gt; I mean, something like that, yeah.\n\n453\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.320\nSo, the same thing then.\n\n454\n00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.490\nSo, if you do have something\nwhere you start generating this,\n\n455\n00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.470\nso, let's just do one or\ntwo of them over here on the other side.\n\n456\n00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:15.916\nAnd we'll change this color\nto make it black, I guess.\n\n457\n00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:18.110\nThat's kind of weird, but why not?\n\n458\n00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:24.150\nOkay, I'm trying to pick a color I\ndidn't actually have in my matrix here.\n\n459\n00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.990\nSo, A is actually 0.18.\n\n460\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.995\nAnd the way that I have that is\nthat the probability is about 0.6,\n\n461\n00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:32.520\nbut the impact is about 0.3.\n\n462\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.160\nOops, so there it is.\n\n463\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.488\nLet me get the right thing.\n\n464\n00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.650\nSo, that would be here.\n\n465\n00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.220\nAnd then the same thing with B,\nwhich is the whatever I had.\n\n466\n00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.597\nProbability was 0.11, which is very low,\nactually, we have 1:1.\n\n467\n00:25:49.597 --> 00:25:52.930\nBut then,\nthe actual impact of it was very high.\n\n468\n00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.850\nSo that way, you can actually compare and\ncontrast your treats and\n\n469\n00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.590\nyour opportunities, and you might find\nout that if you have something like\n\n470\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:05.620\nthis where it's actually right up here in\nthis red, you go, that's an opportunity I\n\n471\n00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.780\ndefinitely need to take advantage\nof at that particular point.\n\n472\n00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.660\nAnd that's when you decide whether\nyou're gonna exploit it, enhance it, or\n\n473\n00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.210\neven transfer the risk\nover to what you need to.\n\n474\n00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.290\nSo, those are kind of the basic examples-\n&gt;&gt; Good tools.\n\n475\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:22.740\n&gt;&gt; When we start to take a look at\nthe idea here of trying to get that\n\n476\n00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:28.390\nunderstanding of what you do in terms\nof risk analysis at a very basic level,\n\n477\n00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.740\nthere are many more tools that\nare actually available for us.\n\n478\n00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:37.230\nBut that's where it actually begins, and\nwhen you start to see that as well, okay?\n\n479\n00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.870\nNow, along with this, what are some of\nthe other tools that we definitely need to\n\n480\n00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.110\nmake sure that we're also taking\nto look at as well, okay?\n\n481\n00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.290\nWell, in project management,\n\n482\n00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.940\nyou deal in the realm of what we\ncall of course risk planning, okay?\n\n483\n00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.170\nNow, when you start talking about\nrisk planning, you're looking for\n\n484\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.390\nwhat we call risk triggers and\nmonitoring for them.\n\n485\n00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.920\nAnd this is the idea of setting\nup some type of early warning.\n\n486\n00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.850\nAnd this really happens with\nbasic communication, but\n\n487\n00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.780\nalso with different events, right?\n\n488\n00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.650\nAs people start turning in information,\nso, we've done shows on\n\n489\n00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:14.270\nthe using project constraints,\nI couldn't remember what show we just did.\n\n490\n00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.030\nWe've talked about the idea\nof using project constraints.\n\n491\n00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.760\nSometimes, what a particular trigger\nmight be, believe it or not,\n\n492\n00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:26.760\nis something just as simple as\na consistent under spending of the budget.\n\n493\n00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.730\nNow, even though majority of us would go,\n\n494\n00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:33.320\nI would thankfully have everybody\nunderspending the budget all the time.\n\n495\n00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.010\nBut remember, this could\nactually be a risk to the overall\n\n496\n00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:40.970\nquality of your project if people\nare cutting corners to underspent, okay?\n\n497\n00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:45.710\nSo, in the sense here, you might\nactually find that to be a trigger or\n\n498\n00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:46.690\nyou constantly seeing that.\n\n499\n00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.390\nOf course,\nthat means the other side of it as well.\n\n500\n00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.970\nYou find people constantly\noverspending on the budget.\n\n501\n00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:57.670\nThat's also an indicator or a trigger that\nsomething else may be gone wrong too.\n\n502\n00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:01.850\nSo, being able to have something like\nthat and plan that out where you have it,\n\n503\n00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.580\nwhere it's essentially going to tell\nyou in your plan, at some point,\n\n504\n00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.530\nhere's some triggers that\nyou need to look for.\n\n505\n00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:11.410\nAnd then you might find out that you do\nhave to actually use either quantitative\n\n506\n00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:15.590\nor qualitative analysis\nto help you out as well.\n\n507\n00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:20.429\nThe other thing, of course, is examining\nthe results of risk afterwards, okay?\n\n508\n00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:25.284\nSo, when you start to take a look at\nthe idea of examining, what you might find\n\n509\n00:28:25.284 --> 00:28:30.280\nout is that whatever assumption you\nhad about a particular risk is wrong.\n\n510\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.820\nAnd then that way, you update your\nparticular project to help you out and\n\n511\n00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.610\nto try and find that.\n\n512\n00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.580\nNow, when you start to review that,\n\n513\n00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.350\nyou'll also end up updating\nthe actual risk register.\n\n514\n00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:45.250\nNow, I have an example of a very basic\nrisk register I want to show you.\n\n515\n00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.660\nSo, just as we've taken\na look at earlier here, so,\n\n516\n00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.580\nthis is normally what a basic risk\nregister also looks like as well.\n\n517\n00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.520\nYou not only have the risk score,\nbut you also have the plan, and\n\n518\n00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:03.730\nwho's actually going to own that\nparticular risk to help us out.\n\n519\n00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:08.390\nSo, you might find out that you\nalready have some risk plans for\n\n520\n00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:09.300\nthose that you have to do.\n\n521\n00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.160\nYou simply enter that in\nas far as the name here.\n\n522\n00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.912\nAnd so, you might say,\n\n523\n00:29:15.912 --> 00:29:21.110\nrisk response, plan one.\n\n524\n00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.020\nOops, if I can spell it.\n\n525\n00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.705\nPlan one.\n\n526\n00:29:27.523 --> 00:29:29.090\nSo, you might have something like that.\n\n527\n00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.751\nAnd then yes,\nyou assign who the owner is gonna be.\n\n528\n00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:34.490\nThere you go, okay?\n\n529\n00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:39.380\nAnd then this way,\nwhen it comes down to whatever Risk C is,\n\n530\n00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.890\nif it does happen,\nbecause we're actually saying look.\n\n531\n00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.250\nThis is a high probability, high impact.\n\n532\n00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.110\nWe now have what a plan of action,\nthat we go to that risk register, and\n\n533\n00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.190\nwe find that out.\n\n534\n00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:51.550\nWe know exactly what plan,\nand who owns it.\n\n535\n00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.510\nCherokee is supposed to be following what,\nplan what?\n\n536\n00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:54.050\n&gt;&gt; Plan 1.\n\n537\n00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.100\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and whatever that is, okay?\n\n538\n00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.065\nThat's what's supposed to be done there.\n\n539\n00:29:58.065 --> 00:29:59.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Got it.\n&gt;&gt; And the reason why that's\n\n540\n00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.840\nimportant is because that actually\nprovides accountability as well.\n\n541\n00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.100\nAnd so, when we start doing that,\nPlan 1 includes, of course, the ideas here\n\n542\n00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.410\nof policies and procedures that are in\nplace in terms of the response itself.\n\n543\n00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:15.470\nThat ensures that we have the\ncontingencies in place that we need to.\n\n544\n00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:18.410\nAfter the risk is over, we might find\nout we don't have to deal with that risk\n\n545\n00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:23.710\nanymore, so we update the plan as well,\nas well as this risk, our matrix here.\n\n546\n00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.970\nWell, we might even mark out all of\nRisk C, because it's now done and over.\n\n547\n00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:31.530\nBut if you do have a risk, that's gonna\nbe constantly repeating, you might not.\n\n548\n00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:36.290\nBut you might see that the problem and\nthe impact is gonna change over time, too.\n\n549\n00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:40.570\nSo, there is a lot available to\nus when we start to take a look\n\n550\n00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:45.070\nat the idea of having to manage\nrisk effectively too, okay?\n\n551\n00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.870\nOnce you have everything in place, you\nmight find out that reprioritization and\n\n552\n00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:51.670\nprioritization, okay, is going to depend\n\n553\n00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:56.710\non the idea of what happens with the risk\nand the resource availability, okay?\n\n554\n00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:02.887\nSo, you might find out that you're ready\nfor something like an emergency management\n\n555\n00:31:02.887 --> 00:31:08.572\ndrill in terms of relocating people\nfrom one particular location to another.\n\n556\n00:31:08.572 --> 00:31:11.597\nBut you might find out that you\nare poorly staffed for something,\n\n557\n00:31:11.597 --> 00:31:14.897\nlike a fire happening, and\nnot being ready, and not being drilled on,\n\n558\n00:31:14.897 --> 00:31:18.650\npeople putting on their mask and\ngetting people out of the building.\n\n559\n00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.770\nSo that's when, yes,\nyou have to reprioritize things based\n\n560\n00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:27.170\non some experience that you've had with\nit, and based on some other information.\n\n561\n00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:32.210\nAnd lastly, of course, there has to be a\ngreat communication plan already in place\n\n562\n00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:34.720\nwith handling the idea of risk.\n\n563\n00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.025\nIf you don't have\ncommunications about risk,\n\n564\n00:31:37.025 --> 00:31:39.164\npeople will generally not tell you, okay?\n\n565\n00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:43.722\nAnd you wont tell them, and that means\neverybody will treat the risk differently\n\n566\n00:31:43.722 --> 00:31:46.600\nin the way that they feel like's best.\n\n567\n00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.440\nAnd now you'll have three or four\ndifferent plans of actions in place, and\n\n568\n00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.940\nthey may end up contradicting one another.\n\n569\n00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:57.710\nSo, always make sure you provide and\ncommunicate to the stakeholders, along\n\n570\n00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:01.640\nwith the proper communication channels,\nwhat the risk is, what has happened, or\n\n571\n00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.740\nwhat is about to happen, and\nwhy it has to be dealt with as well.\n\n572\n00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.220\nSo overall, risk management,\nit takes a bit of time.\n\n573\n00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.710\nIt's a lot more to it than what we've just\nwent over at this particular point, but\n\n574\n00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:17.030\nit is something that you definitely\nneed to keep a track of.\n\n575\n00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.820\nCuz once you stop doing it, and you go,\nI don't have to worry about this anymore,\n\n576\n00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.960\nthat's the time you should be worried\nthat risk is going to happen,\n\n577\n00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.760\nbecause nobody's tracking it.\n\n578\n00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.410\nSo, make sure you go over these concepts\nvery well, because this is kinda\n\n579\n00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:34.070\nthe big part of project management, and\nwhere project management can go wrong if\n\n580\n00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:38.290\nyou're not actually taking a look at\nthe idea of managing risks effectively.\n\n581\n00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.030\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I think you did a really\ngreat job of showing us where to start,\n\n582\n00:32:41.030 -->

another great\nepisode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.530\nI'm you host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.100\nIn this episode, we're gonna be continuing\nour Project Plus from CompTIA's.\n\n9\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.270\nSpecifically, we'll be\nlooking at how to select and\n\n10\n00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.520\nuse appropriate communication methods.\n\n11\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.470\nWith us today, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.920\nThank you for being here today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me in the show.\n\n14\n00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.330\nAs we continue on with our\nCompTIA Project Plus, and\n\n15\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.890\ntake a look at those different\ncommunication methods.\n\n16\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.910\nAnd there's a lot of different aspects of\ncommunication we definitely need to cover.\n\n17\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.170\nSo, we'd better get started, Cherokee.\n\n18\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.530\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, how did we make it our\nentire lives without someone teaching us\n\n19\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.160\nhow to go ahead and communicate?\n\n20\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's actually a great question.\n\n21\n00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.555\nWhen you start to actually think\nabout something like that, you do.\n\n22\n00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:58.112\nYou tend to naturally communicate,\nand what you would believe, right?\n\n23\n00:00:58.112 --> 00:01:02.281\nIs that we don't need any additional\nhelp in terms of communication,\n\n24\n00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:06.380\nbecause all of us have naturally\ncommunicated our entire lives, and\n\n25\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.885\nwe should be good at it already.\n\n26\n00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:12.490\nBut the very fact is we may\nbe good at some of it, but\n\n27\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.030\nwe may not be good at everything\nthat we actually need to understand,\n\n28\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.570\nespecially in terms of project\nmanagement and the communication there.\n\n29\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.100\nSo, that's why I want to take a look\nat some of these different methods and\n\n30\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.440\ntalk about when they're really\nappropriate for us to actually use.\n\n31\n00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.150\n&gt;&gt; And not to mention, that these\nare specifically called out by CompTIA on\n\n32\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.620\nthe objectives list, and that's what were\nhere for, is to go over the objectives, so\n\n33\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.950\nthat's what we're gonna go ahead and do.\n\n34\n00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.810\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt.\n\n35\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.000\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.190\njust begin with foundational\ncommunications at the beginning.\n\n37\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.060\nAnd then we'll take a look at\nwhy we need these methods, and\n\n38\n00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.270\nwhen we're actually going\nto use them as well.\n\n39\n00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.300\nSo, we take a look at my\ncomputer screen here, this\n\n40\n00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.260\nis not a formal communications class in\nterms of what everything breaks down into.\n\n41\n00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.310\nThis is Ronnie Wong's version of it.\n\n42\n00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.780\nSo, normally when you talk about\nthe idea of communications,\n\n43\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780\nwe're working from left\nto right as you see them.\n\n44\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.340\nSo, normally what happens, of course,\nis an individual starts off, and\n\n45\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.660\nthey have an idea,\nan idea that they need to communicate.\n\n46\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.250\nAnd when that formulates in their mind is\nsomething that we would call a message,\n\n47\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.060\nis what would end up happening.\n\n48\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.100\nNow, that formulation,\n\n49\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.500\nonce we get it to that point where it's a\nmessage within our minds, then we have to\n\n50\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.610\nbe able to communicate that particular\nmessage to whomever we want to, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.850\nNow, once we have that originator of that\nmessage that needs to get across somebody,\n\n52\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.920\nwe expect that whoever we tell that to or\nwrite it to, or\n\n53\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.740\nsend some type of message to, whether it's\nlight signals in terms of Morse code or\n\n54\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.150\nanything, we hope that they actually\nunderstand the true intent.\n\n55\n00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.220\nThe way that we thought about it in our\nminds, okay, at the very beginning.\n\n56\n00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.870\nSo, at that particular point then,\nwe might actually just gel it out, right?\n\n57\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.850\nSo, we might use something like this,\na little horn, not exactly that, but\n\n58\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.530\nyou kind of get the idea.\n\n59\n00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.310\nYou might use a voice message, you might\nuse any of these other methods that we\n\n60\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.240\nactually have right here that have listed,\ntalk about social media,\n\n61\n00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.474\nfax, email, you name it.\n\n62\n00:03:06.474 --> 00:03:10.010\nRegular snail mail, telephone call,\nchat, instant messaging,\n\n63\n00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.840\nwhatever you want to do,\nyou might have all of those\n\n64\n00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.580\ndifferent types of communication methods\nthat are actually available to you.\n\n65\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.480\nBut the key here is choosing which\none's actually appropriate, and\n\n66\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.770\nthe problem that you have then Is not\nthat the message can't be communicated in\n\n67\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.940\na literal fashion, not that the message\nyou can't actually yell out, but\n\n68\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.000\nthe problem is the understanding.\n\n69\n00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.986\nSo normally, we have a sender,\nwe have a particular communication that\n\n70\n00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:41.600\nwe end up using, and\nthen we have receivers on the other end.\n\n71\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.520\nNow, in that particular idea of different\nreceivers, it can be an individual,\n\n72\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.070\nit can be a group of people.\n\n73\n00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.043\nWhatever it might be, the problem that you\nmight see is that some of these people\n\n74\n00:03:51.043 --> 00:03:54.120\nmight get the message exactly the same,\nokay?\n\n75\n00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.450\nOthers, they hear the message, but\nit's not exactly the same, and\n\n76\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.670\nothers may even hear a different message\nthan with what you chose to communicate.\n\n77\n00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.970\nYou might wanna why in the world is\nthat true, why does that happen?\n\n78\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.050\nWhen there are many barriers, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.440\nWhich is what the particular pink or\n\n80\n00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.666\npurple line,\ndepends on how you look at this.\n\n81\n00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:16.990\nAnd this particular line\nrepresents is that there are many\n\n82\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.400\nbarriers that can happen,\nregardless of which method that you choose\n\n83\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.000\nthat may end up emphasizing\nthe wrong part of the message, or\n\n84\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.570\nmay not emphasize enough of the message,\nor may completely change the message.\n\n85\n00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.370\nAnd that's why we need to take a look\nat those different possibilities\n\n86\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.890\nin terms of methods that we have to use,\n\n87\n00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.110\nto ensure that whatever we\ncommunicate can get through, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.490\nSo, when it comes down to it,\nlet's just take, for an example, some of\n\n89\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.000\nthe different things that we normally have\nto do in terms of project management.\n\n90\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.650\nThe big one, essentially,\nare meetings, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.170\nNow, Cherokee,\n\n92\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.160\nI've already expressed to you during our\nshow at some point in Project Plus here,\n\n93\n00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.380\nthat, as far as meetings go,\nI really don't like having meetings.\n\n94\n00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.680\nIf I do not have to be\na part of a meeting,\n\n95\n00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.290\nI really do not want to be in the meeting.\n\n96\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.390\nBut in project management, we have\nthings like kick off meetings, right?\n\n97\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.282\nThat really kind of get the show\nrolling the way they want to.\n\n98\n00:05:07.282 --> 00:05:13.293\n&gt;&gt; We also end up having in person\nmeetings maybe with project sponsors and\n\n99\n00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:16.812\nother stakeholders that we have to have.\n\n100\n00:05:16.812 --> 00:05:20.101\nAnd those particular types of in\nperson meetings may be virtual, or\n\n101\n00:05:20.101 --> 00:05:23.620\nthey may actually be meetings that we\nset up so that we come together, and\n\n102\n00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.870\nwe talk about all those\ndifferent things as well.\n\n103\n00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.476\nThere's also, of course, times where\nthose meetings are not actually scheduled\n\n104\n00:05:31.476 --> 00:05:34.789\nout as far as meetings go,\nbut they're fairly impromptu.\n\n105\n00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.958\nIt might be as you're actually on your\nway out to go and attend another meeting,\n\n106\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.227\nI know that it's kind of\nstrange that you'd do this, but\n\n107\n00:05:40.227 --> 00:05:41.532\nsomebody stops you in the hall.\n\n108\n00:05:41.532 --> 00:05:44.590\nAnd Cherokee goes can I just bug you for\na moment here?\n\n109\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.550\nAnd let's talk about something.\n\n110\n00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.300\nAnd all of a sudden, you actually started\ntalking about what had to happen there,\n\n111\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.190\nand that was kind of an impromptu\nmeeting that you actually see.\n\n112\n00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.175\nAnd you even have closure meetings,\nand you have so\n\n113\n00:05:54.175 --> 00:05:55.479\nmany meetings that are going on.\n\n114\n00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.066\nAnd the hardest part about those meetings\nis to ensure that whatever message that\n\n115\n00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:03.236\nneeds to communicate gets\nthrough to the receiver, and\n\n116\n00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:05.268\nit's the same as much as possible.\n\n117\n00:06:05.268 --> 00:06:10.014\nBut in the 21st century today, we have so\nmany different methodologies out there-\n\n118\n00:06:10.014 --> 00:06:11.877\n&gt;&gt; I know, we've really evolved.\n\n119\n00:06:11.877 --> 00:06:15.665\n&gt;&gt; Evolved is not the,\nwe've jumped insanely here,\n\n120\n00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:19.910\nto the point where we really\nhave this unusual gap.\n\n121\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.550\nYou have people in project management\nthat learned it in the 20th century, and\n\n122\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.640\nthey still follow the old tried and\n\n123\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.660\ntrue method of their communication\nstyle that they learned.\n\n124\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.980\nThey don't like this\nidea of actually saying,\n\n125\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.750\nwhat do you mean I should use this,\ninstead of the way that I learned it?\n\n126\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.600\nSo, you have people that are,\n\n127\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.360\nessentially, going to be stuck to\ntheir way of actually communicating.\n\n128\n00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.177\nAnd even though you don't tend to deal\nwith it in that way, you've got to\n\n129\n00:06:44.177 --> 00:06:47.933\nrealized that that communication\nmethod has to either get updated, or\n\n130\n00:06:47.933 --> 00:06:51.704\nyou have to actually find the method\nthat's gonna work for you as well.\n\n131\n00:06:51.704 --> 00:06:56.225\nSo, we wanna make sure that we actually\naddressed when it's actually appropriate\n\n132\n00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:59.841\nto use some of these different ones\nthat we actually solve kind of in\n\n133\n00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:01.731\nsymbolic form on my diagram here.\n\n134\n00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.415\nAll right, so Cherokee,\n\n135\n00:07:03.415 --> 00:07:08.388\nlet's just talk about probably the most\ncommon one right at the beginning for\n\n136\n00:07:08.388 --> 00:07:13.135\nmost organizations, which is\nthe lifeblood of every communication that\n\n137\n00:07:13.135 --> 00:07:17.291\ngoes on within organizations here,\nwhich is the idea of email.\n\n138\n00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:21.285\nAnd by far, that is probably still\nthe most common version of some type of\n\n139\n00:07:21.285 --> 00:07:23.150\ncommunication method.\n\n140\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.730\nI've learned one thing in the IT industry\nover the years here, if nothing else.\n\n141\n00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.100\nAs long as you have printers working, and\nas long as people can get their email,\n\n142\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.260\neverything else can pretty\nmuch fall apart, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.940\nAnd that pretty much is the truth.\n\n144\n00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.930\nBut you allow for five minutes where\nthey're expecting an email, and\n\n145\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.910\nthey don't get it, you're in trouble.\n\n146\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.610\nYou're gonna hear about it.\n\n147\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.520\nYou allow for the fact that they can't\nprint, you're gonna hear about it.\n\n148\n00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.713\nBut overall though, email is by far kind\nof the lifeblood of most companies in\n\n149\n00:07:50.713 --> 00:07:52.403\nterms of communication here.\n\n150\n00:07:52.403 --> 00:07:56.278\nSo, when you start to talk about\nthis idea of using email, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:56.278 --> 00:08:00.729\nWell, you gotta think about what it is\nthat you need to relay in an email.\n\n152\n00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:02.273\nOkay, so in that sense,\n\n153\n00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:06.848\nit's not the same as some of the other\nthings that you have to be able to do.\n\n154\n00:08:06.848 --> 00:08:11.610\nSo an email message is good when you\nhave to relay some details, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.250\nBut it was primarily really designed so\nthat you can communicate things\n\n156\n00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.380\nfairly quickly, okay,\nwith some documentation details.\n\n157\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.700\nNow it doesn't mean that you\nactually document fully everything.\n\n158\n00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.250\nOkay, but\nif that's your only method you do, but\n\n159\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.240\na lot of times its usually about that.\n\n160\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.460\nSo much so that a lot of times people\nreally, they shouldn't actually\n\n161\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.780\nneed to explain everything,\nthey should just give highlights in those\n\n162\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.030\nbecause email is meant to be some type of\nquick messaging service as well, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.872\nNow the problem with the idea of\nwith working with email, though,\n\n164\n00:08:42.872 --> 00:08:45.810\nthat it's what we call\nasynchronous communication.\n\n165\n00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.880\nSo Cherokee, I send you an email, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.450\nAnd I'm saying,\nI need a response to this quickly.\n\n167\n00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.080\nCherokee, what do you think I\nmean by quickly when I say that?\n\n168\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.311\n&gt;&gt; For the type of life that most of\nus live in this day and age, immediate.\n\n169\n00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:04.589\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Cherokee would think\nimmediate, or she may actually think like\n\n170\n00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:07.981\nsome people I know,\nthat goes it means when I can get to it.\n\n171\n00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:10.664\nOkay, so that means when I have the time,\n\n172\n00:09:10.664 --> 00:09:15.580\nI may actually address Ronnie's\nquestion at this particular point.\n\n173\n00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.930\nBut it will be quicker than what,\n\n174\n00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.650\nthan if Ronnie were to write to\nme in a letter and address it.\n\n175\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.570\nBut at this particular point,\nif it's something that's super elaborate.\n\n176\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.920\nAnd this is what happens to me on\nemails a lot of times as well,\n\n177\n00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.880\nis that when I get a question on email,\n\n178\n00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.630\nif I can answer it in an email back in\na relatively short amount of time, I will.\n\n179\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.132\nBut if I can't, then I'll probably just\nlet it sit in my inbox until I go,\n\n180\n00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:43.290\nall right, I can now sit down and\nactually answer this email.\n\n181\n00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.950\nAnd all of a sudden I do\nwrite out quite a long email.\n\n182\n00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.210\nBut the problem is it\nactually does take more time.\n\n183\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.909\nAnd so if it takes more time,\nand I'm now awaiting an answer,\n\n184\n00:09:51.909 --> 00:09:55.340\nit may not be the best possible\nmethod of communication.\n\n185\n00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.720\nSo we need to understand our purpose\nin using the email as well, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.620\nNow sometimes it really does work well in\nterms of at least distributing information\n\n187\n00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.389\nto a large group of people very quickly,\nokay?\n\n188\n00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:08.103\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n189\n00:10:08.103 --> 00:10:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, changes that might happen,\nlike I scheduled this on the wrong day.\n\n190\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.840\nLet me make sure everybody knows about it.\n\n191\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.950\nWell, I would either have to\nget on the phone, okay, and\n\n192\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.100\ncall everybody that\nneeded to be addressed.\n\n193\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.860\nOr I might have actually created\na distribution group at some point, so\n\n194\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.640\nthat I can say, all right,\n\n195\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.616\nhere's an email that needs to go\nout to everybody at this point.\n\n196\n00:10:27.616 --> 00:10:29.170\nSo here ITProTV studios,\n\n197\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:34.700\nas the studios were getting built, when we\nactually needed access into the building,\n\n198\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.630\nthe great thing is whoever the project\nmanager was on site at that point.\n\n199\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.370\nHe's a great guy.\n\n200\n00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.770\nIf there were any changes that were going\non that we needed to be aware of as we\n\n201\n00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.580\nwere working in the building,\nhe just sent out an email saying, hey,\n\n202\n00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.690\nhere's where the doors are gonna be open.\n\n203\n00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.090\nHere's who's coming in today and\n\n204\n00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.260\nit actually allowed us to understand\nwe need to make room for that.\n\n205\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.110\nAnd he'd send that out to essentially all\nthe contractors, which is kinda neat.\n\n206\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.342\nSo you do have those things\nwhich are really good that\n\n207\n00:11:02.342 --> 00:11:06.600\nprovide a basic amount of information.\n\n208\n00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.765\nBut remember, just because we use it\nthat way it doesn't mean that you\n\n209\n00:11:09.765 --> 00:11:13.790\ncan't use it for much more detailed and\neven much more formal communication.\n\n210\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.600\nBut at the same time, it's something\nthat in terms of project management,\n\n211\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.800\nif time is your key, email is probably\nnot gonna be your best bet because not\n\n212\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.250\neverybody treats email the same way.\n\n213\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.860\nWhen I think it's instantaneous,\nthat can mean exactly like I told you,\n\n214\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.770\nis that Cherokee may mean\nwhen I can get to it, okay.\n\n215\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.450\nAnd Cherokee may have 1,000\nemails in her box for all I know.\n\n216\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.430\nAnd there it is.\n\n217\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.847\nAnd she's like,\nI'm answering Ronnie's at number 979.\n\n218\n00:11:38.847 --> 00:11:41.480\nAnd she answers it from\nthe top to the bottom.\n\n219\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.590\nShe doesn't care that I actually put\nthe word urgent in the subject line.\n\n220\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.050\nShe's just going through, one by one.\n\n221\n00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie,\nI don't want to jump the gun here but\n\n222\n00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.300\nI think if you really want to get a hold\nof me and it's really that urgent,\n\n223\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.958\nemail probably wouldn't be the best.\n\n224\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.309\nHere at ITPro we use Office 365, and\n\n225\n00:11:56.309 --> 00:11:59.381\ninstant messaging would\nprobably be the way to go.\n\n226\n00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:01.220\nIt kind of just jumps to\nthe head of the line there.\n\n227\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now you've actually\nbrought up an interesting idea\n\n228\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.960\nhere in terms of instant messaging.\n\n229\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.525\nInstant messaging is a great way to go,\nbut\n\n230\n00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:11.315\nthere's limitations to that as well, okay.\n\n231\n00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:14.920\nWhen you start talking about something\nlike that, email is fairly universal.\n\n232\n00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.720\nIn other words, just about everybody,\nand I'm not going to say everybody.\n\n233\n00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.210\nPlease don't,\nthey'll say I don't use email, yeah,\n\n234\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.420\nplease don't write in\na letter to ITProTV and say,\n\n235\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.060\nRonnie said everybody has email,\nI'm still using pen and paper.\n\n236\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:32.440\nFine, that's great, but overall,\nthough, it's fairly universal.\n\n237\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.140\nNow what I mean by that is\nusually everybody has one,\n\n238\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.490\nit's like a phone number, everybody\njust about has a phone number but\n\n239\n00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.250\nat the same time it doesn't require\nyou and I to be on the same system.\n\n240\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee,\n\n241\n00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.880\nif you have for one reason or another, I\ndon't know why you would still have this,\n\n242\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.220\nif you have an aol.com email address and\n\n243\n00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.490\nI have a Gmail address or something even\nsillier, if I have something like that.\n\n244\n00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.880\nIt doesn't matter that our\nsystems are disparate, okay?\n\n245\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.760\nIt really doesn't matter at all,\nbecause an email is fairly generic.\n\n246\n00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.620\nSo I can send it to you, and\nevery company that we end up working with,\n\n247\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.780\nthey may actually have\ntheir own email server,\n\n248\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.370\nthey may use something generic like Gmail,\nor Yahoo, or whatever it might be.\n\n249\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.347\nAnd emails can be\nexchanged fairly quickly.\n\n250\n00:13:13.347 --> 00:13:17.230\nBut since Cherokee mentioned the idea\nof instant messaging though,\n\n251\n00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.970\nokay, now in this particular sense, for\n\n252\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.620\na project management company, what more\nthan likely is like what Cherokee said.\n\n253\n00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.370\nHere at ITProTV studios,\n\n254\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:31.790\nwe use Office365 which means we\nhave access to Skype for Business.\n\n255\n00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.480\nAnd so that's great, as long as you have\naccess to Skype for Business as well.\n\n256\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.740\nBut Cherokee, what about my vendors\nthat I have working on my project?\n\n257\n00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.970\nAnd I go,\nI'm gonna instant message you, and\n\n258\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.600\nyou're gonna say, okay that's fine,\nand then I'll go all right.\n\n259\n00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.650\nSo you have Skype for Business?\n\n260\n00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:54.130\nOoh, no, I work with Google Hangouts,\nokay, and now you're like.\n\n261\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.810\nYeah, that's not great.\n\n262\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:04.630\nSo instant messaging gives you that idea\nof almost near synchronous communication,\n\n263\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.490\nwhich is awesome, but now you're actually\nrequiring a system to be put in place.\n\n264\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.860\nSo as long as everybody has\nthe same system, you're okay, and\n\n265\n00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.650\nthat's a great thing to have.\n\n266\n00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.230\nBut now if you actually\nhave different systems,\n\n267\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.260\nthough, well a little bit harder\nto actually get adjusted and\n\n268\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.728\nto figure out, and to realize that that's\nwhat also, you have to deal with, okay.\n\n269\n00:14:24.728 --> 00:14:27.060\nSo you may have some companies that go,\nno way, I'd never get Office 365,\n\n270\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:32.430\nand you have companies that may say,\nI'm not gonna get Google Hangouts either.\n\n271\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.505\nSo in that sense,\nmaybe the instant messaging,\n\n272\n00:14:35.505 --> 00:14:40.155\nas quick as it gives you the information,\nthe problem is you may find out,\n\n273\n00:14:40.155 --> 00:14:42.558\nthey're not all compatible, okay.\n\n274\n00:14:42.558 --> 00:14:46.338\nAll right, so there's some other things\nthat we also need to talk about as well\n\n275\n00:14:46.338 --> 00:14:48.210\nwhich is the idea of fax.\n\n276\n00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.870\nOkay, fax is another type of\nmethodology that we can use.\n\n277\n00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:57.080\nOkay, so in this one, normally for\nus, the big idea here,\n\n278\n00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.168\nand the big reason why today in the 21st\ncentury, we'd probably end up using\n\n279\n00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:06.070\na fax is, if there's a legal document that\nneeds to be signed at some point, okay.\n\n280\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.220\nSo that gives authority to somebody else,\n\n281\n00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.300\nfax I believe still holds\nsome type of legal.\n\n282\n00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.390\n&gt;&gt; For sure, you would think it would be\nan antiquated system, but there are so\n\n283\n00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.720\nmany companies that they really\nrely on fax transmissions today.\n\n284\n00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n285\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.494\nAnd a lot of times the only limitation\nthat you have here, usually,\n\n286\n00:15:22.494 --> 00:15:26.458\nand the reason why people give you their\nfax numbers is that either they prefer it,\n\n287\n00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:28.024\nstill, to me, kinda strange.\n\n288\n00:15:28.024 --> 00:15:28.685\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n289\n00:15:28.685 --> 00:15:30.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it does happen.\n\n290\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.770\n&gt;&gt; It's out there, yeah.\n\n291\n00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.050\n&gt;&gt; But it could be that they don't\nactually have Internet access.\n\n292\n00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.850\nAnd for most of us here at\nITProTV studios, yeah, we'd\n\n293\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:43.410\nprobably faint underneath that thought\nof not having access to the Internet.\n\n294\n00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:48.030\nSo it could be, though, you are working\nwith a company that really doesn't depend\n\n295\n00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.408\non the Internet for their communication.\n\n296\n00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.221\nAnd so they may go, no,\nwe just never found a need for it.\n\n297\n00:15:53.221 --> 00:15:56.499\nEverything that we need we can\nwork out over faxes, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:56.499 --> 00:16:01.487\nWell, if that's true, well, then you might\nstill have to actually use a fax to help\n\n299\n00:16:01.487 --> 00:16:03.328\nyou To do something like this.\n\n300\n00:16:03.328 --> 00:16:06.098\nGreat thing is that work\nover your telephone line\n\n301\n00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:09.600\nis a fairly universal process for\nus to be able to do.\n\n302\n00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.660\nBut normally for\nus as long as there's pride today\n\n303\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.400\nif there's no other communication left\navailable we might end up using a fax.\n\n304\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.320\nBut most of us though are probably\nnot gonna consider this probably\n\n305\n00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.780\nthe best aspect of getting anything done,\nokay.\n\n306\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.970\nNow, that also means of course then,\neverybody is trying to get\n\n307\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.620\nto this point as well,\nwhere it seems a bit impersonal, right.\n\n308\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.294\nEverything that we've talked about,\nwhether if it is an email, or a fax, or\n\n309\n00:16:37.294 --> 00:16:40.595\neven instant messaging is\na little bit impersonal\n\n310\n00:16:40.595 --> 00:16:44.530\nbecause the problem with those\nare fairly simple, okay.\n\n311\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.904\nYou don't understand tone, you can't see\nan inflection or you can't hear, excuse\n\n312\n00:16:48.904 --> 00:16:53.231\nme, an inflection in the voice, you can't\nsee that frown that Cherokee just made.\n\n313\n00:16:53.231 --> 00:16:54.008\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] you lose a lot,\nyeah, without that.\n\n314\n00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:57.507\n&gt;&gt; When you say something silly,\nyou lose a lot of that process and\n\n315\n00:16:57.507 --> 00:17:00.570\nso that the message doesn't come through.\n\n316\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.750\nWell now that means of course you might\nthinking about in person or actually,\n\n317\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.830\nsome type of virtual type of conferencing,\nlike video conferencing or\n\n318\n00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.478\neven voice conferencing as well.\n\n319\n00:17:10.478 --> 00:17:11.200\n&gt;&gt; My favorite.\n\n320\n00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:11.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n321\n00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.320\nSo those things are great, okay?\n\n322\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.810\nThey actually do kind of give you\nthat reality that you can have\n\n323\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:21.100\non a face-to-face meeting that allows you\nto do everything that's actually there.\n\n324\n00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.840\nAnd it also helps when you have team\nmembers that are actually incredibly\n\n325\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.640\nremote at different locations instead of\nbeing right there in the room with you.\n\n326\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.080\nSo everybody can be involved,\nthey can do that.\n\n327\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.150\nBut the limitation still is the same\nthing that we talked about with\n\n328\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.450\ninstant messaging.\n\n329\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.313\nAs long as you're on the same system,\nit works great.\n\n330\n00:17:38.313 --> 00:17:42.320\nIf you're on different systems,\nit doesn't work as well.\n\n331\n00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.310\nAnd that doesn't mean you can't get\neverybody to be on the same system.\n\n332\n00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.900\nBut sometimes-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are a lot of free services\n\n333\n00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.260\nand now you don't even have\nto install the clients.\n\n334\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.170\nThe software we use,\nlightweight protocols.\n\n335\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.340\nA lot of times you can just connect\nright there through their browser.\n\n336\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.730\nSo, that's pretty awesome.\n\n337\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.908\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is because\nit does allow you to do that and\n\n338\n00:17:59.908 --> 00:18:02.770\nthe nice thing is,\nit's fairly scalable, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.260\nI was trying to make\nsure I remember the word.\n\n340\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.000\nI was thinking scopable and\nI was like, that's not the right word.\n\n341\n00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.670\nIt's scalable.\n\n342\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.370\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n343\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.310\nThat means If my project continues\nto grow beyond just remote sites\n\n344\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:16.960\nright here in Gainesville, and\nthen we get another project site in Miami,\n\n345\n00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.720\nwe get one in New York,\nwe get one in Los Angeles.\n\n346\n00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.850\nThose virtual conference meetings, as\nthey happen, we can continue to grow that\n\n347\n00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:28.960\nwithout really needing to build up\na ton of infrastructure to do so.\n\n348\n00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.160\nSo you do have scalability\nalong with this type of\n\n349\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.780\nsystem that's actually in place\nwhen you start doing that, okay?\n\n350\n00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.080\nAnd again, voice conferencing\nwould be the same thing.\n\n351\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.720\nAs long as system is in place,\nwe are ready to go, okay?\n\n352\n00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.730\nNow there are some times though, that\nthe only method that we should ever use,\n\n353\n00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:50.770\nokay, is gonna be a face-to-face\ntype of in person meeting, okay?\n\n354\n00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:56.420\nNow Cherokee, I know of at least\none instance that I would say,\n\n355\n00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.010\nthis should be done face-to-face.\n\n356\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.015\nDo you have an idea of\nwhat I'm thinking about?\n\n357\n00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:02.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wanna be professional here,\nbut\n\n358\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.500\ndue to some of our conversations I have\na feeling that is probably a break-up?\n\n359\n00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat would probably be a good one.\n\n360\n00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.530\n&gt;&gt; Or\nam I just totally in left field here?\n\n361\n00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.384\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no you're fine, yeah, yeah.\n\n362\n00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:15.851\nIf you actually receive an email or\nan instant message, like okay, I'm done,\n\n363\n00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:17.780\nthat's probably a little bit harsh.\n\n364\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.022\nBut in a professional sense,\nI was thinking of you're fired, okay?\n\n365\n00:19:21.022 --> 00:19:23.325\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that works too,\nthere's kind of a break-up there.\n\n366\n00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:27.223\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't get me wrong,\nI guess you could get that over an email,\n\n367\n00:19:27.223 --> 00:19:31.110\nI know people have in the past, but\nwhen it comes down to it, right?\n\n368\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:36.760\nThere's sometimes in which the impersonal\nnature of something like that\n\n369\n00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.620\nshould never be the reason\nwhy people get upset.\n\n370\n00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.350\nThey're probably upset about losing\ntheir job, but they should know,\n\n371\n00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.290\nand it should come from somebody directly.\n\n372\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.730\nSo when you need to make\nthe actual impact so\n\n373\n00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.730\nthat somebody understands it,\nthere's no appeal of this.\n\n374\n00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.500\nThere's nothing else going on here.\n\n375\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.340\nThis is just the way it is.\n\n376\n00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.280\nYou wanna make sure that you go ahead and\nthat you do that.\n\n377\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.044\nNow, the limitations here\nis fairly simple, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:00.044 --> 00:20:03.800\nThat means you have to actually\nbe willing to be there.\n\n379\n00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.700\nSo, if you're gonna do this type of thing,\nit means you have to be willing to fly out\n\n380\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.930\nto wherever or\nyou have to bring them to where you are.\n\n381\n00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.320\nSo you might find out it's not really\ngoing to be that way all the time.\n\n382\n00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.160\nBut just realize that there\nare a lot of things that happen.\n\n383\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.755\nWhenever you have some type of major\ndisruption to your project, if you can,\n\n384\n00:20:21.755 --> 00:20:24.960\nface-to-face is probably gonna\nbe better than the idea of them\n\n385\n00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.840\njust receiving an email.\n\n386\n00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.450\nLike, by the way, your particular task\non the project has been cancelled, love,\n\n387\n00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.392\nRonnie, that's kinda\nharsh at the same time.\n\n388\n00:20:33.392 --> 00:20:36.500\nSo face-to-face meetings do\nhave their place, and they\n\n389\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.720\nshouldn't be replaced just because\nthere's conveniences that are out there.\n\n390\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.265\nWhen it's actually very important,\n\n391\n00:20:44.265 --> 00:20:47.490\nface-to-face meetings are pretty\nmuch the big one, okay?\n\n392\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.030\n&gt;&gt; Maybe even for some kind of really\nsecure information transmission as well.\n\n393\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.680\nUnless you were dealing\nwith quantum encryption,\n\n394\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.550\nthat's probably a pretty safe method,\nface-to-face.\n\n395\n00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.110\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even think about that.\n\n396\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.230\nThat particular aspect of security,\nbut yes,\n\n397\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:05.680\nit could be where the message need to be,\nfor your eyes only.\n\n398\n00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.370\nAnd that could be it, so\n\n399\n00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.910\nhopefully we're not communicating\nanything like that on my project.\n\n400\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.414\nBecause then I'd be part of some spy ring\nand get arrested by another country.\n\n401\n00:21:14.414 --> 00:21:15.164\n&gt;&gt; Michael Weston.\n\n402\n00:21:15.164 --> 00:21:18.246\n&gt;&gt; There you go, Michael Weston,\nyeah, Burn Notice guy.\n\n403\n00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:22.628\nAll right, of course, text messaging,\nyeah, you say something.\n\n404\n00:21:22.628 --> 00:21:27.724\nToday, it's kind of a de facto\nway of us communicating, so.\n\n405\n00:21:27.724 --> 00:21:28.560\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n406\n00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.728\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just about,\n\n407\n00:21:29.728 --> 00:21:34.320\nit’s a fairly de facto way that we\ntend to communicate within companies.\n\n408\n00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.850\nWe can relay information fairly quickly,\nit's fairly informal and\n\n409\n00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.660\nmost of the time the people that you\ntend to text are not strangers, I hope.\n\n410\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.601\nCherokee's looking at me like, I don't.\n\n411\n00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:49.244\nYeah, most of the time they're people\nthat you know so you feel confident.\n\n412\n00:21:49.244 --> 00:21:52.710\n&gt;&gt; I have a handful of people that I\ntext and I keep it pretty limited, yeah.\n\n413\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:57.810\n&gt;&gt; But that's the idea, right, text\nmessaging, you don't tend to, I say this,\n\n414\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:02.535\nokay, you don't tend to go out and\ngo, there's somebody across this,\n\n415\n00:22:02.535 --> 00:22:05.770\nlet's say a grand opening,\nthat you want to meet.\n\n416\n00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:06.863\nYou don't go, let me see if I\ncan text them, and get together.\n\n417\n00:22:06.863 --> 00:22:12.251\n&gt;&gt; Right, but then there are other people,\nexperts like Ms. Erin here at ITPro TV.\n\n418\n00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:16.083\nThe other day she sent someone\na text message, and I blinked, and\n\n419\n00:22:16.083 --> 00:22:17.560\nshe had already sent it.\n\n420\n00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.782\nI was just floored, I say,\nwow, that's so fast.\n\n421\n00:22:19.782 --> 00:22:21.287\nShe's like, yeah,\nI have a lot of practice.\n\n422\n00:22:21.287 --> 00:22:25.493\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, when you're text messaging,\nyou're assuming, yeah,\n\n423\n00:22:25.493 --> 00:22:28.132\nyou can make this type of assumption.\n\n424\n00:22:28.132 --> 00:22:31.240\nNormally the people that you text\nmessage they already know how you speak.\n\n425\n00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.340\nThey kinda get the inflection that\nyou would say things with, but\n\n426\n00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.320\nstrangers don't.\n\n427\n00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.994\nSo even though, Cherokee,\nwe can use emojis.\n\n428\n00:22:38.994 --> 00:22:40.214\n&gt;&gt; Thank goodness.\n&gt;&gt; Which I know is one of your\n\n429\n00:22:40.214 --> 00:22:40.950\nfavorites here.\n\n430\n00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We can use emojis to communicate.\n\n431\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.564\nBut when you start doing stuff like that\nduring stuff like that during the formal\n\n432\n00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:47.876\nproject management meeting [LAUGH]\nit's probably not gonna actually-\n\n433\n00:22:47.876 --> 00:22:49.149\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, right.\n\n434\n00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:51.500\n&gt;&gt; Carry over the-\n&gt;&gt; Let's keep the emoji's at home.\n\n435\n00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah keep the emoji's\non the personal level.\n\n436\n00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.410\nBut you kinda get the idea\nthat as well as it does work,\n\n437\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:02.710\nas long as people understand\nthe background of it, it's perfectly fine.\n\n438\n00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:07.570\nBut most of the time in a formal meeting,\nespecially with people\n\n439\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:11.530\nthat you don't know, you lose so much in\nthe communication that's not gonna work.\n\n440\n00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.360\nIf you know the people it's\nprobably gonna work better, okay?\n\n441\n00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.430\nNow there also of course comes the idea\nof just written reports, okay?\n\n442\n00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.740\nNow this is the one that most of us\nprobably groan at like a report,\n\n443\n00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.675\nare you joking me.\n\n444\n00:23:22.675 --> 00:23:26.211\nThey hand you a stack of papers like I\nhanded Cherokee this morning for our show.\n\n445\n00:23:26.211 --> 00:23:27.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And she's like, no,\n\n446\n00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:31.230\nRonnie's gonna be talking a lot,\nis what she said.\n\n447\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.570\nSo, there you go, okay?\n\n448\n00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.340\nBut written reports,\nthey are still valid, okay?\n\n449\n00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.520\nNow, with this one, this is not even\nasynchronous communication here, Cherokee,\n\n450\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.156\nthis is just a broadcast, okay?\n\n451\n00:23:41.156 --> 00:23:41.730\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n452\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.290\n&gt;&gt; If I give you a report, I'm not\nexpecting you to come back to me and\n\n453\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.650\ngo, hey I have a question\nabout this report.\n\n454\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.640\nI'm just saying, I don't care,\nyou're getting the report.\n\n455\n00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.240\nYou can read all about it on your own,\n\n456\n00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.570\nif you have a question later,\nmake sure you get ahold of me.\n\n457\n00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.946\nBut I'm essentially just going to do that.\n\n458\n00:23:57.946 --> 00:24:02.532\nSo you kind of are able to distribute\na mass amount of information very\n\n459\n00:24:02.532 --> 00:24:03.727\nquickly, okay?\n\n460\n00:24:03.727 --> 00:24:07.867\nAnd the great thing is in reports you\ncan be as detailed as you choose to be\n\n461\n00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:09.010\nas well.\n\n462\n00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.890\nBut you normally don't\nneed any collaboration\n\n463\n00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.900\nto ensure that the message gets through.\n\n464\n00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.730\nYou know exactly what you\nwant to communicate and\n\n465\n00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:17.290\nyou communicate that through.\n\n466\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.400\nSo we tend to see this when we have\nthe project manager giving status reports.\n\n467\n00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.390\nWe tend to see this when we actually see\nthings like our annual report that we may\n\n468\n00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.640\ngive or weekly report here that\nshows the progress is also going on.\n\n469\n00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:35.660\nNow that the last one that we need\nto talk about here just briefly,\n\n470\n00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.329\nis the use of social media, okay.\n\n471\n00:24:39.329 --> 00:24:40.930\n&gt;&gt; Brother.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; In project management, and\n\n472\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.100\nI know it's kind of strange,\nbut in the 21st century,\n\n473\n00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.510\n&gt;&gt; I look at James, in the chat,\n\n474\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.070\neven says people have\ngotten fired over Twitter.\n\n475\n00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.890\nIt's so crazy to think that it's such an\nintegral part of our lifestyles now, but\n\n476\n00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:55.480\nit is, it actually just kind of carries\nright on over into our professional lives.\n\n477\n00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.620\n&gt;&gt; It really does, right?\n\n478\n00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.520\nThe very fact that people have actually\nread your own Facebook post or\n\n479\n00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.670\nTwitter message and said, yeah, we don't\nthink you're a part of our company,\n\n480\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:10.210\ngoes to show you that the sensitivity\nof the communication that you use and\n\n481\n00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.680\nmaybe that expression itself.\n\n482\n00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.240\nAnd that's why we're talking about\nusing the appropriate method.\n\n483\n00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe,\n\n484\n00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.190\nactually, before you say\nsomething that you want to say,\n\n485\n00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:23.370\nreally, maybe you go, maybe me posting\nsome type of grudge that I'm having\n\n486\n00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:27.850\nwith my boss on Twitter is\nnot the way to do that.\n\n487\n00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:31.920\nOkay, but maybe me actually going\nto my boss who I have a grudge with\n\n488\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.585\nmaybe that's actually\nthe better idea to do that and\n\n489\n00:25:34.585 --> 00:25:35.400\nface-to-face-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n490\n00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.075\nin case you guys missed it we did have\nan episode on conflict resolution.\n\n491\n00:25:39.075 --> 00:25:40.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n492\n00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.370\nYes we did.\n\n493\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.870\nSo make sure you check that one out too.\n\n494\n00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:47.470\nBut you gotta kind of understand that,\nespecially in today's world, that for\n\n495\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:52.570\nus, the idea of social media tends to\ncarry through to every part of our lives,\n\n496\n00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.300\nand even in project management.\n\n497\n00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.910\nThis is a bit of more enhanced\ntype of communication, okay,\n\n498\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.270\nthat's gonna be used on what channels\nthat are establish for us already?\n\n499\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:09.820\nSo, things like Facebook and LinkedIn and\nTwitter and stuff like that.\n\n500\n00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.550\nAll these rushy vary variable\ntools to the business world, okay.\n\n501\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.430\nAdvertisement, they do a ton of it but\n\n502\n00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.830\nremember that these gives you that\nmass media type of communication.\n\n503\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.630\nReduces your effort of needing to\ncoordinate when everybody just tends to be\n\n504\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.420\non Facebook anyways.\n\n505\n00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.880\nAnd then you can actually\nput your message out there.\n\n506\n00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.280\nAlso, the other notion of\nusing something like this\n\n507\n00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.870\nhelps out in project management a lot.\n\n508\n00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.160\nOn LinkedIn there are plenty of project\nmanagement groups out there where you\n\n509\n00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.120\nmight actually encounter something that\nyou're saying I'm dealing with this, and\n\n510\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.770\nyou'll probably find professionals willing\nto help, so it becomes a resource for\n\n511\n00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.080\nyou as well.\n\n512\n00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.010\nFairly cost efficient cuz like on Facebook\nI don't think it costs you very much\n\n513\n00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.340\nto get on Facebook as far as I know.\n\n514\n00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.260\n&gt;&gt; It costs you privacy.\n\n515\n00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:55.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, privacy, but in terms of actual\nmonetary cost, not really that way.\n\n516\n00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, again, and I hate to be a Debbie\nDowner, but from a security standpoint,\n\n517\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.990\nyou need to keep that\nconsideration as well.\n\n518\n00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.560\nYou're not in charge of the types of\nencryptions that are being utilized.\n\n519\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.630\nSo you definitely don't wanna use these\nchannels for sensitive information.\n\n520\n00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:12.240\n&gt;&gt; And lastly, the idea here is\nalso a little bit more unusual.\n\n521\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.290\nDon't get me wrong, there's people out\nthere that are on Facebook probably 23 and\n\n522\n00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.890\na half hours a day.\n\n523\n00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.500\nI am not [LAUGH].\n\n524\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.940\nSo this is kind of an a asynchronous\ntype of communication fairly passive.\n\n525\n00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.750\nMost of the time where you go post\non something that's funny and\n\n526\n00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.260\nnobody likes your post and\nyou feel kinda bad about it,\n\n527\n00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.240\nI know, cuz I do that everyday and\nnobody really even likes so\n\n528\n00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.080\nwhen you do stuff like like that\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n529\n00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm there, yeah yeah.\n\n530\n00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.220\n&gt;&gt; So.\n[LAUGH] Working on it.\n\n531\n00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.100\n&gt;&gt; So you gotta realize this is passive,\n\n532\n00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.440\nit's not going to be what you\nthink it's gonna be sometimes.\n\n533\n00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.130\nSo just realize that this is now a very\nheavily used communication method.\n\n534\n00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:54.310\nAnd we tend to do this for\nannouncements more than anything else,\n\n535\n00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:56.690\nnot trying to relay detailed information.\n\n536\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.960\nOne of the funniest things I saw\nrecently is somebody said hey,\n\n537\n00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.250\nI need so-and-so to call me.\n\n538\n00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:05.300\nAnd as she posted their phone number on,\nthey're like great idea.\n\n539\n00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right there on Facebook.\n\n540\n00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.450\n&gt;&gt; I don't think they\nwould be too pleased.\n\n541\n00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:11.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, they have what\nthey call trolls today, right?\n\n542\n00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.290\nWhich you would simply troll everybody\nfor, or that particular person,\n\n543\n00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.510\nby a million people doing things.\n\n544\n00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.405\nSo, just kind of realize that\nthere's a lot out there.\n\n545\n00:28:19.405 --> 00:28:20.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is a lot out there.\n\n546\n00:28:20.335 --> 00:28:21.575\nThere's really so much.\n\n547\n00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:24.965\nAnd actually James just put in\nthe chat here again, Hootsuite.\n\n548\n00:28:24.965 --> 00:28:26.995\nThere's so much, I get confused sometimes.\n\n549\n00:28:26.995 --> 00:28:29.995\nYou gotta go to this website, login,\nwhat's your password for this website.\n\n550\n00:28:29.995 --> 00:28:32.195\nWe've got Instagram, we've got Facebook.\n\n551\n00:28:32.195 --> 00:28:33.930\nBut whenever you can use\na product like that,\n\n552\n00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.090\nthat just kind of bundles\neverything together.\n\n553\n00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.820\nI don't even know, Ronnie,\ndo we have a Yammer here at ITProTV?\n\n554\n00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.170\n&gt;&gt; We do not have Yammer, so\nthat's like an internal Facebook type of-\n\n555\n00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.530\n&gt;&gt; Good, I have too many.\n\n556\n00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.210\n&gt;&gt; Of system that you have access and\navailable to.\n\n557\n00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.780\nSo there's a lot of different things here,\nokay.\n\n558\n00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.390\nNow the key though is,\nyou as a project manager, okay.\n\n559\n00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.560\nWhen it comes down to your\ncommunication plan, you do\n\n560\n00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.100\nneed to make sure that you understand\nthe methods that are out there and\n\n561\n00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.600\nthat are available to you but\nyou can't just rely on one method.\n\n562\n00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.910\nThe problem is barriers\nthat we've talked about,\n\n563\n00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.130\nlet's go back to my diagram here for\na second before we close up here k?\n\n564\n00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:14.739\nRemember that even though some people may\nhave access to the systems that you want\n\n565\n00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.510\nsome of them may and that's a barrier.\n\n566\n00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.070\nThe very fact that they\naren't going to do that means\n\n567\n00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.510\nthey're might not even get the message\nthat you are actually trying to do.\n\n568\n00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.600\nBut there are some people\nthat actually reads something\n\n569\n00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.380\nwithout understanding your tone and\nyour inflection and\n\n570\n00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.590\nkind of think that they take it personally\nbecause they believe that they know you.\n\n571\n00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:38.390\nAnd, so, that is a limitation behind\nsome of these methods as well.\n\n572\n00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:39.450\nThe other one, of course,\n\n573\n00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.990\nis when you start taking a look\nat the technology side of things.\n\n574\n00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.480\nDoes it actually require a system\nto be in place or doesn't it?\n\n575\n00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.010\nThese are all different things that\nwe have to actually think about.\n\n576\n00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.950\nAs we establish a communication\nplan with our team so\n\n577\n00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:58.090\nthat they understand what it is\nthat we're trying to communicate.\n\n578\n00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.240\nSo normally once you actually do that,\n\n579\n00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.660\nthat's when you start choosing your\nformal methods of communication.\n\n580\n00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.010\nOf saying, you know,\nyou'll receive a written report\n\n581\n00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:11.970\nyou know at this particular date or\nduring this point in our project here.\n\n582\n00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:16.700\nOkay, or regular status updates\nwill come through email messages\n\n583\n00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.760\nthat will happen on a daily basis or\non a weekly basis, okay?\n\n584\n00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.890\nGeneral announcements that have to with,\nlet's say, scheduling, not scheduling,\n\n585\n00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:30.530\nbut time off, might come through our\nFacebook post on our project, okay, so\n\n586\n00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.720\ncheck there to find out stuff.\n\n587\n00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.810\nAnd I mean schools have actually done\nvery good at something like this.\n\n588\n00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:40.366\nWhere, inclement weather delays or where\nbecause of some type of inclement weather-\n\n589\n00:30:40.366 --> 00:30:41.324\n&gt;&gt; Doctors' offices-\n\n590\n00:30:41.324 --> 00:30:42.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, doctors' offices\n\n591\n00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.010\nand stuff like that.\n\n592\n00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:44.950\n&gt;&gt; Getting text messages and\nphone calls, yep.\n\n593\n00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.990\n&gt;&gt; Yup, where they're actually able to use\nthat system because it's already there,\n\n594\n00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.630\nwhy not take advantage of it?\n\n595\n00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.990\nWell, companies are starting\nto do that as well.\n\n596\n00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.370\nSo there always has to be\nan understanding that you\n\n597\n00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.520\nreally need to understand how\nyou're gonna communicate and\n\n598\n00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.710\nwhat you're gonna communicate over\nthese particular methods here.\n\n599\n00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.020\nAnd choose the right one is gonna be key.\n\n600\n00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.070\nAnd so if you keep in mind that\ncommunication factor and understand who\n\n601\n00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.730\nyou're also trying to communicate with,\nhopefully it'll be easier for you to\n\n602\n00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:17.349\ndecide which of these methods you're gonna\nend up using for your project management.\n\n603\n00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.757\nAll right, I think that about wraps it up,\nbut I do have one other question.\n\n604\n00:31:20.757 --> 00:31:22.498\nRonnie, do you have a Twitter account?\n\n605\n00:31:22.498 --> 00:31:23.694\nWhat is your Twitter handle?\n\n606\n00:31:23.694 --> 00:31:28.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mine is @Ronnie_ITProTV.\n\n607\n00:31:28.865 --> 00:31:31.270\n&gt;&gt; Mine is Cherokee_@ITProTV.\n\n608\n00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:31.810\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n609\n00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.380\n&gt;&gt; So guys, follow us on Twitter\nif you wanna stay up to date.\n\n610\n00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.900\nI think, Ronnie you did\na really great job explaining\n\n611\n00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.710\nall the different communication methods,\nnow I know where to use them.\n\n612\n00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.700\nSo stay tuned guys, we're gonna have\nmore Project Plus coming your way.\n\n613\n00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.910\nThank you for joining us,\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n614\n00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n615\n00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.702\n&gt;&gt; Signing off, have a good one.\n\n616\n00:31:48.702 --> 00:31:54.739\n[MUSIC]\n\n617\n00:31:54.739 --> 00:31:57.300\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.861\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:10.861\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.020\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.720\nToday we're going to be looking\nat comp TIA's Project +,\n\n8\n00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.420\nspecifically we're gonna be looking at\nhow to analyze communication factors.\n\n9\n00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.050\nIf you've been following along,\n\n10\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.010\nyou already know that we've looked\nat some communication methods.\n\n11\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.250\nAnd Mr. Ronnie Wong is here today to\ngo ahead and help us with this topic.\n\n12\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.250\nThank you for being here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue on with Project +.\n\n14\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.710\nAnd specifically looking\nat some of the different\n\n15\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.410\ntypes of communication factors and\ninfluences that we have to deal with.\n\n16\n00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.980\nSo let's go ahead and get started here so\nthat we understand the basic process of\n\n17\n00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.630\ncommunication and then show you\nwhat we'll be focusing in on.\n\n18\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.030\nSo here on my computer screen I went ahead\nand mapped out something that I've used in\n\n19\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.260\na previous episode here,\nwhich is the communication process.\n\n20\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.920\nMost basic way that I tend to\nsee communication happening.\n\n21\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.620\nSo moving from left to right,\nusually a person begins with an idea.\n\n22\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.690\nAnd that's what the lightbulb represents.\n\n23\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.140\nAnd that idea is something\nthat needs to be communicated.\n\n24\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.120\nIf it doesn't need to communicated,\nyou don't need a message for that.\n\n25\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.870\nSo in their head,\nthey form some type of message.\n\n26\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.140\nNow, once the message is formed,\nthey understand exactly what they mean.\n\n27\n00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.190\nThey know what they really\nwant to communicate, and\n\n28\n00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.050\ntheir particular meaning\nis actually very important.\n\n29\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.360\nSo then, that is when that\nindividual becomes a sender.\n\n30\n00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.670\nAnd that idea of sending that message\nnow means communicating it to\n\n31\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340\nwhoever that they need to.\n\n32\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.330\nSo they become the sender and\nthen, over on the other side,\n\n33\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.180\nthat means there's a receiver.\n\n34\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.320\nThose receivers are supposed to be able\nto take whatever they actually hear,\n\n35\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.730\nread, get from instant messaging.\n\n36\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.460\nWhatever it might be, and\n\n37\n00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.810\nbe able to understand that they\nget the exact same message.\n\n38\n00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.540\nSo when they have that,\nthat's the hope that you get.\n\n39\n00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.290\nAnd some people will get exactly that.\n\n40\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.650\nOther people though,\n\n41\n00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.190\nwill end up getting part of the message\nwhich may not actually be all there.\n\n42\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.530\nBut they'll actually get a bit of it,\nand they'll actually miss some of it.\n\n43\n00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.830\nAnd then some people will outright\nchange whatever message that\n\n44\n00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.590\nyou thought you communicated,\nto whatever they wanted to hear.\n\n45\n00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.580\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I know those people.\n\n46\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so it does happen\nwhere you tend to see that process.\n\n47\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.680\nAnd all these may have play the game,\n\n48\n00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.424\nI can't everybody call\nthis something different.\n\n49\n00:02:26.424 --> 00:02:29.545\nBut it set the game where use to start\noff by whispering in somebody's ear-.\n\n50\n00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:30.440\n&gt;&gt; Telephone.\n&gt;&gt; Telephone yeah,\n\n51\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.110\nwe are playing at the end,\nyou know, you might say,\n\n52\n00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.535\nRonnie has very long hair and at the end,\nRonnie's monkey here, what is that about?\n\n53\n00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:39.955\nWhatever it might be right?\n\n54\n00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:41.095\nSo the message might change.\n\n55\n00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:44.115\n&gt;&gt; Do kids still play games these days,\nlike real games?\n\n56\n00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:45.370\n&gt;&gt; Probably online.\n\n57\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It'd be hard to\n\n58\n00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:50.105\nplay the telephone game online.\n\n59\n00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:53.065\nBut overall, though,\nyou might still see that.\n\n60\n00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:55.785\nBut in real life,\nit still happens that way, right?\n\n61\n00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:59.210\nWhen you say, hey,\ntell somebody to come here.\n\n62\n00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.610\n&gt;&gt; So, it's weird, what that message\nactually conveys to someone,\n\n63\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.890\ndepending on what\nsituation that they're in.\n\n64\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.830\nSo, when you tell somebody that, they\nmay actually have that sense of dread,\n\n65\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.720\nlike, what am I about to be pulled into?\n\n66\n00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.620\nOr, why is he calling me there?\n\n67\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.050\nOr, I just need to get some information.\n\n68\n00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.920\nOr, they're gonna ask me something.\n\n69\n00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.300\n&gt;&gt; Getting called into\nthe principal's office.\n\n70\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.270\n&gt;&gt; Yep, getting called into\nthe principal's office.\n\n71\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.760\nYou never know exactly what that's about.\n\n72\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.000\nSo you hear these same things go on.\n\n73\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.050\nSo here's the basic idea.\n\n74\n00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.520\nNow you may be wondering\nlike I am at times like\n\n75\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.230\nwhy in the world did they not\nunderstand what it is that I said?\n\n76\n00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.490\nAnd it could be that I absolutely\nmessed up my communication part.\n\n77\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.830\nEven though it's right in my head the\ncommunication part didn't turn out well.\n\n78\n00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.520\nSo I might not have actually\ninflected my voice correctly,\n\n79\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.500\nI may have put the wrong emphasis on\ncertain things that I didn't want to.\n\n80\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.470\nAnd I emphasized other things.\n\n81\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.530\nWhatever it might be what we're\ntalking about essentially is this\n\n82\n00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.430\npink line right here.\n\n83\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.650\nAnd those are the different types of\nfactors that we have to account for\n\n84\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.100\nif we're gonna try and\ncommunicate clearly.\n\n85\n00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.020\nAnd they essentially are what\nwe call communication barriers.\n\n86\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.010\nSo when it comes down to\nit graphically Cherokee,\n\n87\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.840\nthis whole show is really\nabout that pink line.\n\n88\n00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.470\nIt's kind of weird, but it is, it's about\nthose barriers that we need to understand.\n\n89\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.080\nSo that we can possibly attempt to\novercome them when we start that process\n\n90\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.170\nof communication and choose whatever\nmethodology that we need to.\n\n91\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.570\nSo that we can communicate\nmost effectively,\n\n92\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.380\nis what we actually want to do.\n\n93\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.750\nSo that is really what we're going to\ntake a look at at the beginning here.\n\n94\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.640\nIs to take a look at\nthose different barriers.\n\n95\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.454\nSo the first one is actually probably one\nthat we don't think about very often until\n\n96\n00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:42.120\nit happens to you directly.\n\n97\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.858\nNow I'm gonna assume that\nnobody's actually done this but\n\n98\n00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:47.332\nit still happens to me every\nonce in a while Cherokee.\n\n99\n00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:51.247\nWhile even though they,\nI get introduced to somebody,\n\n100\n00:04:51.247 --> 00:04:56.600\nthey still talk to me the first time\nlike they have to speak incredibly loud.\n\n101\n00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.970\nAnd I don't know why,\nthey have to over enunciate things.\n\n102\n00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.320\nLike I may not understand\nwhat's actually going on.\n\n103\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.120\nSo, I normally when I'm actually part of,\nI mean what,\n\n104\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.720\nI don't say a word because I don't wanna\nsee what the reaction this gonna be.\n\n105\n00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.712\nSo something like that is what they could\nwhat I would consider a language barrier.\n\n106\n00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:17.926\nCherokee, has that ever happened to you?\n\n107\n00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes it has.\n\n108\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n109\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.350\n&gt;&gt; I lived in south Florida and\npulling up to drive-throughs.\n\n110\n00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.930\nThe teller didn't speak English, so\n\n111\n00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.150\nthat was a little bit of\na culture shock for me.\n\n112\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.620\nAlso when my kid's pediatrician\ncalled me on the phone,\n\n113\n00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.670\nshe just automatically started\nspeaking to me in Spanish also.\n\n114\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.738\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so when you have stuff like\nthat you've gotta imagine, then,\n\n115\n00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:41.964\nthat communication becomes a little\nbit more difficult in terms of what we\n\n116\n00:05:41.964 --> 00:05:43.122\ncall a language barrier.\n\n117\n00:05:43.122 --> 00:05:46.143\nWhether we're talking about meetings\nin which you do have something like\n\n118\n00:05:46.143 --> 00:05:47.467\nwhat Cherokee was describing.\n\n119\n00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:52.527\nOr where I'm just standing there and\npeople just assume they have to explain\n\n120\n00:05:52.527 --> 00:05:57.980\neverything to me in a very loud and very\nover pronounce the types of a voice there.\n\n121\n00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.850\nIt happens and\n\n122\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.130\nit can also of course happen when\nthe written word is also the same thing.\n\n123\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.020\nSo, for example if English is\nyour first language you tend to\n\n124\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.400\nunderstand the following and the grammar.\n\n125\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.173\nAnd you kind of understand\nthe sentence structure but\n\n126\n00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:15.690\nsometimes if English is the second\nlanguage and they translate it.\n\n127\n00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.260\nIt doesn't sound the way that\nyou would expect it to sound.\n\n128\n00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.120\nYeah, sounds like Google Translator\nbecause that's probably what it is.\n\n129\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.850\nAnd then you have to try and figure\nout what that message is going to be.\n\n130\n00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.710\nSo, when we start getting\ninformation like that and\n\n131\n00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.030\nwe want to overcome\nthe barrier of language itself.\n\n132\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.480\nYou've got really a couple\nof different things.\n\n133\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.430\nOne, you could learn the language and\n\n134\n00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.880\nbe conversational to\nthe fact that you master it.\n\n135\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.240\nYou could do that.\n\n136\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.960\nIn project management,\nthat's where a problem comes in.\n\n137\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.660\nIf you're not already naturally able\nto communicate in that language\n\n138\n00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.460\nyou getting things done on a timely basis\nis probably not going to work very well.\n\n139\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.460\nSo what do you tend to do?\n\n140\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.130\nWell at that point you need a translator.\n\n141\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.100\nAnd even though Google Voice may help\nyou out in translating some things.\n\n142\n00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.570\nIt may not help you in translating\nhighly technical things and\n\n143\n00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.360\nthat is where you have to\nactually think as well.\n\n144\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.200\nNormally this is where you might consider\nthe idea of getting a translator.\n\n145\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.860\nNow just when I say that, translators,\n\n146\n00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.620\nyou need to be fairly specific about\nwhat you want them to translate.\n\n147\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.750\nAnd that means that you have to say I\nwant to know word for word what they say.\n\n148\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.340\nSome translators will be able\nto do the majority of that.\n\n149\n00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.650\nSome translators may not\nbe able to do all of that.\n\n150\n00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.600\nSo it really depends on\nwhat you need them for.\n\n151\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.819\nBut a translator, essentially, is one of\nthe methods that we can use to be able\n\n152\n00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:49.739\nto overcome that idea of something\nlike a basic language barrier as well.\n\n153\n00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:53.694\nOkay, now the other barriers that can\ninfluence our project management and\n\n154\n00:07:53.694 --> 00:07:55.435\nour communication, of course.\n\n155\n00:07:55.435 --> 00:08:00.264\nIs the idea of different time zones and\ngeographical factors as well.\n\n156\n00:08:00.264 --> 00:08:04.680\nWhen you start having meetings, whether\nthey're scheduled in person or whether\n\n157\n00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.978\nthey're scheduled virtually such as\nvideo conferencing of some sort as well.\n\n158\n00:08:08.978 --> 00:08:12.967\nYou've got to make sure that everybody is\nscheduled to meet at the time that they're\n\n159\n00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:14.380\nscheduled for.\n\n160\n00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.710\nSimply us putting in a meeting\ntime of 9 AM may not mean\n\n161\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.053\nanything to anyone except for\ntheir local time zone.\n\n162\n00:08:23.053 --> 00:08:27.641\nAnd for us here at ITProTV, this has\nbeen one of the challenges that we've\n\n163\n00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:30.231\nlearned just over time just a little bit.\n\n164\n00:08:30.231 --> 00:08:37.620\nAs we started out a fairly small company,\nwe started streaming live and it was fine.\n\n165\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.810\nBut we'll start streaming\nabout 9:30 in the morning.\n\n166\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.580\nWell the problem is we had people that\nwere viewing this from Europe, so\n\n167\n00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.520\nabout 26% of our entire membership\nis actually from overseas somewhere.\n\n168\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.603\nSo we started having people view from\nEurope, we had one from Australia that\n\n169\n00:08:54.603 --> 00:08:56.913\nwould get up in the middle of\nthe night just about 11 PM,\n\n170\n00:08:56.913 --> 00:08:58.090\nthey would get up and watch.\n\n171\n00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.391\nAnd some would say 9 AM, they're like\nokay, but 9 AM is your time about 11,\n\n172\n00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:06.244\nwhatever it might be and so all of\na sudden we started realizing we need to\n\n173\n00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:09.100\nmake sure that we're very\nclear about what we mean.\n\n174\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.500\nSo you need to make sure that,\nthat communication process goes on and\n\n175\n00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.330\nthat the scheduling that is done is\nsomething that needs to be accounted for.\n\n176\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.210\nMost of the time for us is simple,\nwe just tell them it's gonna be\n\n177\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.370\nEastern Standard or Eastern Daylight Time,\nand just about everybody understands that.\n\n178\n00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.483\nBut overall though, you need to\nmake sure in project management.\n\n179\n00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.762\nIf you're expecting the meeting at 9 AM,\nEastern, well,\n\n180\n00:09:29.762 --> 00:09:33.621\ngotta realize that over in California,\nthat's gonna be about 6 AM and\n\n181\n00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:37.780\nsomebody may not even be awake yet\nto be able to handle that meeting.\n\n182\n00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.970\nSometimes they'll get up for it, but\n\n183\n00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.210\nit doesn't mean that they\nwill always get up for it.\n\n184\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.948\nSo just remember that even time zones\nthemselves can actually be a barrier when\n\n185\n00:09:45.948 --> 00:09:48.261\nyou're trying to get access to that.\n\n186\n00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:53.101\nI know it happens to me quite often when I\nsign up for webinars, and I say, 9 AM, and\n\n187\n00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:57.403\nthen finally when I go to that date,\nit says 9 AM, Mountain Standard Time,\n\n188\n00:09:57.403 --> 00:10:02.582\nI'm like that means 11 for me, but I don't\nthink about that because I just think,\n\n189\n00:10:02.582 --> 00:10:05.540\n9 o'clock in the morning, no big deal.\n\n190\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.418\nSo even that can actually just\nbe a matter of miscommunication\n\n191\n00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:13.903\nthat could prevent good communication\nfrom happening as well, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:13.903 --> 00:10:17.589\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of cool features, even like\nyou guys were talking about earlier,\n\n193\n00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:19.435\nyour smart phones, right?\n\n194\n00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:22.915\nSo a lot of those phones, and you can\nget widgets on your desktops to help you\n\n195\n00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:25.082\nremember all those\ndifferent time zones too.\n\n196\n00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:26.101\nIt can help you there, Ronnie.\n\n197\n00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:28.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know, yeah.\n\n198\n00:10:28.465 --> 00:10:32.375\nIn other words, it's not a matter of\nare there tools available, right?\n\n199\n00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:34.715\nIt's a matter of getting\nto use those tools, and\n\n200\n00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:38.020\ngetting into the practice and\nhabit of understanding that.\n\n201\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.020\nWhen you are working with a project in\nwhich is gonna span multiple time zones,\n\n202\n00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.580\nis that not everything is centric to\nyou even though you think it should be.\n\n203\n00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.145\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:48.910\n&gt;&gt; The world doesn't revolve around me?\n\n205\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.379\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Galileo said that a while ago,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n206\n00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:54.199\nthat yes it doesn't really.\n\n207\n00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:58.260\nIt's time to revolve around us\nas much as we think that we do.\n\n208\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.310\nBut because all of us do think locally,\nokay?\n\n209\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.120\nThat's what normally needs to happen.\n\n210\n00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.550\nBut if you do need that and\nyou do need the information,\n\n211\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.580\nyou do need to make sure that\nwhatever is communicated,\n\n212\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.870\nis communicated clearly to those\nteams across different time zones.\n\n213\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.970\nMake sure you'll take that into account.\n\n214\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.340\nAnd schedule it at some point in which\nis good for everybody if you can.\n\n215\n00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.730\nYou're always scheduling it\njust because it's good for\n\n216\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.720\nyou, well, people will put up with it,\nbut they probably don't like it.\n\n217\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.580\nAnd I know that you might go, well,\n\n218\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.590\nwhat difference does that\nmake if they don't like it.\n\n219\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.918\nWell, remember that if you already\nhaving a barrier like that and\n\n220\n00:11:33.918 --> 00:11:37.914\nthe time is actually it, those barriers\ntend to set up other types of emotional\n\n221\n00:11:37.914 --> 00:11:41.244\nbarriers where they're like,\nI'm listening to part of it, but\n\n222\n00:11:41.244 --> 00:11:44.660\nI really would rather be eating\na jelly donut and coffee right now.\n\n223\n00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.682\n&gt;&gt; Sleeping, yeah.\n\n224\n00:11:45.682 --> 00:11:46.614\n&gt;&gt; Sleeping.\n[LAUGH]\n\n225\n00:11:46.614 --> 00:11:47.114\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:48.784\n&gt;&gt; Than actually listening here.\n\n227\n00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:50.345\nAnd what they're hoping for\n\n228\n00:11:50.345 --> 00:11:53.920\nis that they catch enough of it that\nthey can just go back to sleep or\n\n229\n00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.260\nwalk away from it and\nnot have to worry about it again.\n\n230\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.146\nOr they're hoping like I did in college,\n\n231\n00:12:00.146 --> 00:12:02.560\nright?\nI fell asleep during class,\n\n232\n00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.080\nI hope I can go and get these notes\nfrom so and so, and copy those notes.\n\n233\n00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.010\nSo later on,\n\n234\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.960\nyou might see something like that too,\nokay?\n\n235\n00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.844\nTechnological factors are also\na key part of this as well.\n\n236\n00:12:13.844 --> 00:12:14.900\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't happen.\n\n237\n00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.897\n&gt;&gt; No, technological factors,\nwell yeah, it-\n\n238\n00:12:17.897 --> 00:12:18.690\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n239\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it never happens\nuntil the day of the meeting.\n\n240\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n241\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:27.232\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah just when you think that\nmajor companies and big companies,\n\n242\n00:12:27.232 --> 00:12:32.472\nthat everything should be kind of\nscheduled and neat the way that they want.\n\n243\n00:12:32.472 --> 00:12:35.840\nWell, even they can have some\nmiscommunications that go on.\n\n244\n00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.810\nSo, sometimes you might go like\nI have in the past here, when\n\n245\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:44.460\nI was caught into a meeting with somebody\nat Microsoft, right, we had this meeting.\n\n246\n00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.700\nWell, it was fine until you found out\nthat they didn't use the same technology\n\n247\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.720\nyou did ten minutes before the meeting,\nand now you're okay,\n\n248\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.460\nlet's scramble and\nlet's get this set up and going.\n\n249\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.870\nBut you're able to do that.\n\n250\n00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.790\nBut at that point, you realize that hey,\n\n251\n00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:02.140\nthis may not have actually been the best\nmeeting that it could have been.\n\n252\n00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.790\nCuz we didn't really understand\nhow the technology worked and\n\n253\n00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.890\ngiving us everything that we need to.\n\n254\n00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.190\nSo making sure that somebody understands\nhow to use the technology is just\n\n255\n00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.320\nas important.\n\n256\n00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.950\nI've been a trainer for a while, and\nsometimes I had to go off-site and\n\n257\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.630\nuse their technology.\n\n258\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.420\nAnd one of the things that they didn't\neven tell me about too, about halfway\n\n259\n00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:27.410\nthrough whatever I was teaching that day,\nwas, by the way, you're on WebEX, okay?\n\n260\n00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.645\nAnd I didn't even know there\nwas somebody remote, and so\n\n261\n00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:35.980\nI've been ignoring essentially part\nof the entire class the whole day,\n\n262\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.740\nwithout any knowledge\nat all about doing this\n\n263\n00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.840\nwhen you gotta realize that even that\ncan be kind of a barrier as well, okay?\n\n264\n00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.840\nThere are different types of cultural\n\n265\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.150\nawareness that we also\nhave to understand too.\n\n266\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.850\nSometimes it can be ethnic\nbarriers that happen,\n\n267\n00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.640\nsometimes it's just work culture related\nthings that also happen as well.\n\n268\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.210\n&gt;&gt; This is a big point for me, I always\nfeel like people really should understand\n\n269\n00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.250\nthat not everyone was brought\nup the same way that they were,\n\n270\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.885\nhas the same background, and\nwe need to remember that.\n\n271\n00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:08.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially if your project is\ncentered in that particular culture\n\n272\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.680\nsomewhere else.\n\n273\n00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.390\nFor us here in the United States,\nfairly all of us, we really do,\n\n274\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.900\nwe kind of think everything revolves\naround us, just like wherever you are,\n\n275\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.050\nyou probably think everything\nrevolves around you.\n\n276\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.629\nAnd we don't think about a project\nthat we might have overseas as\n\n277\n00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:25.220\nbeing something different\nthan what we would do here.\n\n278\n00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.090\nBut you might find out that there are\ncultural things that have to actually be\n\n279\n00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.810\nkind of tailored around certain events,\nand\n\n280\n00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.130\nthat way you schedule them correctly\nthe way that you want to as well.\n\n281\n00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.320\nAnd then, like I said, on the work type of\nculture, there is what we call, of course,\n\n282\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.500\nthe idea of inter-organizational\ndifferences.\n\n283\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.230\nSo let's say that we're\ncontracting with the team but\n\n284\n00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.600\nthey're actually oversee somewhere and\nin that sense\n\n285\n00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.910\nthat their particular corporate\nculture is different from ours, okay?\n\n286\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:57.890\nThere's also intra-corporate or\nintra-organizational differences as well.\n\n287\n00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:03.340\nAnd that is actually even within the\nculture that we have within the company.\n\n288\n00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.650\nSo a single company,\nit might have multiple locations.\n\n289\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:11.850\nOne location may take things just\na little bit less formal than another\n\n290\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:16.240\nparticular site somewhere across\nthe country may take them.\n\n291\n00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.560\nAnd when those two teams meet,\n\n292\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.060\neven over a virtual meeting, you can\nalmost sense the difference between\n\n293\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.350\nhow those teams would normally\ncommunicate with each other as well.\n\n294\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.345\nAnd so you do have to take\nthat consideration here.\n\n295\n00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:34.380\nCuz I like the idea of informality and\njoking,\n\n296\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.150\nand being able to do stuff like that.\n\n297\n00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.968\nI found out that in one particular\nmeeting, I wasn't appreciated at all and\n\n298\n00:15:41.968 --> 00:15:44.308\nthey just thought I was\njust unprofessional.\n\n299\n00:15:44.308 --> 00:15:45.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n300\n00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:46.845\nprobably they're right\nwhen it comes down to-\n\n301\n00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:48.037\n&gt;&gt; I think I told you earlier today,\n\n302\n00:15:48.037 --> 00:15:50.733\nRonnie, that I've never gotten in\ntrouble in a work environment before.\n\n303\n00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:54.273\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I might have to say even early on,\n\n304\n00:15:54.273 --> 00:15:58.315\neven in middle school, I ended up,\none of the few times I\n\n305\n00:15:58.315 --> 00:16:02.787\ndid get in trouble though was\nbecause I had spoke to a teacher,\n\n306\n00:16:02.787 --> 00:16:07.093\na superior, in kind of just a lax,\ninformal way like that.\n\n307\n00:16:07.093 --> 00:16:09.632\nAnd so, you gotta be careful with that.\n\n308\n00:16:09.632 --> 00:16:13.490\n[LAUGH] It leaves an impression,\nI still remember that.\n\n309\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and imagine that for\nyour entire project.\n\n310\n00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.430\nIf you are trying to move things along.\n\n311\n00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:23.070\nAnd now, you have just, for one reason or\nanother, scheduled something through\n\n312\n00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:27.600\na national holiday, or scheduled\nsomething through an ethnic holiday for\n\n313\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.480\nsomebody, for what the majority of your\ncompany actually recognizes and does.\n\n314\n00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.920\nWell, that can be very\ndamaging to the morale.\n\n315\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.185\nIt could be very damaging to your company,\nactually, moving forward.\n\n316\n00:16:39.185 --> 00:16:42.856\n&gt;&gt; And like you mentioned before,\neven if you're working with vendors, and\n\n317\n00:16:42.856 --> 00:16:45.140\nsay they're observing\nthe Chinese New Year.\n\n318\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.690\nAnd that's, how long is that, Ronnie.\n\n319\n00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.370\nIt's-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not very long, but\n\n320\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.450\nit does take time out of that schedule.\n\n321\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.660\n&gt;&gt; And if you have an order, then maybe\nyou just need to be aware of that so\n\n322\n00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.500\nyou're not expecting that item to\narrive within that time frame.\n\n323\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or to at least sit there for\na while until everybody gets to it.\n\n324\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.510\nSo sometimes you can work around it.\n\n325\n00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.650\nYou can work agreements between them, but\n\n326\n00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.974\nyou will see that you do\nneed to account for it.\n\n327\n00:17:08.974 --> 00:17:10.583\nAnd the great thing is, today,\n\n328\n00:17:10.583 --> 00:17:13.634\nthere's a lot of project\nmanagement information systems.\n\n329\n00:17:13.634 --> 00:17:16.105\nIn other words the software that\nhelps you with project management.\n\n330\n00:17:16.105 --> 00:17:19.149\nThat if you actually select\nthe proper calendar,\n\n331\n00:17:19.149 --> 00:17:23.930\nyou can actually get one that actually\nshows you the holidays that are actually\n\n332\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.622\nin effect for\nthat part of the world as well.\n\n333\n00:17:26.622 --> 00:17:30.145\nAnd that way you're not actually just\nscheduling off a standard type of\n\n334\n00:17:30.145 --> 00:17:31.720\nGregorian calendar.\n\n335\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.710\nSo they do show you even\ninformation like that, so\n\n336\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:39.880\nthat that way you don't actually overrun\nsomebody's particular cultural influence\n\n337\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.750\nby just going, well,\nI don't care if it's their holiday or not.\n\n338\n00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.600\nWe're still gonna work on through it.\n\n339\n00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.560\nYou may have to do that,\nbut overall, though,\n\n340\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.860\nyou may find out that they're going\nwe're not working on that day.\n\n341\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.160\nSo it doesn't matter if you\nsay you have to do it or not.\n\n342\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.886\nYou might find out that you can\nfire all of them and nobody says,\n\n343\n00:17:54.886 --> 00:17:56.592\nof course we're not working that day.\n\n344\n00:17:56.592 --> 00:18:00.727\nSo you do have to take in to account\nthat that could be a barrier for\n\n345\n00:18:00.727 --> 00:18:02.040\nwhat you need to do.\n\n346\n00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.100\n&gt;&gt; On strike.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah,\n\n347\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.160\nyou could be on strike that day too.\n\n348\n00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.470\nOf course,\nthe other one is personal preference.\n\n349\n00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.490\nAnd this is a hard one for\nus to understand the barriers to this.\n\n350\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.245\nHopefully, Cherokee,\nyou don't know anybody like this.\n\n351\n00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:16.600\nYeah, I get emails all the time.\n\n352\n00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.790\nBut I only read them once a month,\nI don't like emails.\n\n353\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.880\nWell, if it's the lifeblood and\nthe culture of your company, that\n\n354\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.090\nemails are the way that you do things, it\ndoesn't matter whether you like it or not.\n\n355\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.369\nBut the very fact is sometimes you\ndo have to think about this idea\n\n356\n00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:33.916\nthat-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you're selling something then\n\n357\n00:18:33.916 --> 00:18:37.652\nyour customers are gonna see that\ndelay and then go to your competitor.\n\n358\n00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:42.580\nOr maybe your supervisor sees\nthe delay and terminates you.\n\n359\n00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.910\nSo there are some severe consequences for\nthat delay.\n\n360\n00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's not only about the delay is right,\n\n361\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:54.160\nit's about the person being unwilling to\nsay, look, here's what our company uses,\n\n362\n00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.630\nand they just go, I don't care what you\nuse, this is what I'm going to use, and\n\n363\n00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.790\nthat means everybody better\nget on board with me.\n\n364\n00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:04.660\nWell, you might be able to do that as\na project manager, don't get me wrong.\n\n365\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.660\nYou might have the authority to do that.\n\n366\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.620\nBut it doesn't mean that other people will\nuse that system the way that you intend\n\n367\n00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.200\nfor them to use it.\n\n368\n00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.320\nSo they may use it begrudgingly,\nthey may use it to a point.\n\n369\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.780\nBut it's not going to be something\nthat they're gonna readily adopt and\n\n370\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.460\nactually use it naturally.\n\n371\n00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.950\nSo even personal preferences in\nthe way that you choose to communicate\n\n372\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.510\nmay not be seen as a great preference for\neverybody.\n\n373\n00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.870\nAnd so you need to take that into account.\n\n374\n00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:33.610\nOr be ready to expect for\npeople to take everything that you do\n\n375\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.500\nmaybe out of context in the way that\nyou don't think it can be done.\n\n376\n00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.160\nSo it's one of those unusual things.\n\n377\n00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.569\nBut that's when you do have to\ndo that as a project manager,\n\n378\n00:19:43.569 --> 00:19:48.479\nis realize that personal preference is not\nalways the thing that needs to be handled,\n\n379\n00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:50.405\nas far as the way you like to do it.\n\n380\n00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:54.553\nIt might be what's best for the project\nat that particular point and moment, and\n\n381\n00:19:54.553 --> 00:19:56.688\nit might be what's best for the company.\n\n382\n00:19:56.688 --> 00:19:58.579\nIf they already have a system there,\n\n383\n00:19:58.579 --> 00:20:01.402\nnot about what you would rather\nhave a lot of times too.\n\n384\n00:20:01.402 --> 00:20:03.610\nAll right, so\n\n385\n00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:09.220\nhow do we get by when we have all of\nthese barriers that are in place.\n\n386\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.940\nAnd that we need to overcome them in terms\nof being able to communicate better, okay,\n\n387\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.230\nand when we have all these influences and\nthese factors that we have to overcome.\n\n388\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.110\nWell, the way that we do that, first and\nforemost, is make sure that we start to do\n\n389\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:29.250\nsome type of rapport building or\nrelationship building that we need to do.\n\n390\n00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.060\nFirst and foremost,\nyou need to overcome the awkwardness that\n\n391\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.930\nmay actually be a part of\nyour project by doing so.\n\n392\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.850\nSo at the beginning here,\nyou go ahead and you tell them,\n\n393\n00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.850\nin a meeting of a sort, here is what\nwe believe is gonna be the best.\n\n394\n00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.010\nAnd that way, everybody understands what\nit is you're trying to communicate and\n\n395\n00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.290\nwhy you chose the methods that you did.\n\n396\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:54.130\nSo there's not a lot of times where you'll\nget that opportunity two or three times.\n\n397\n00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.680\nUsually it's kind of one of those things\nwhere if you knock it out of the park,\n\n398\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.580\neverybody's accepting of it and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n399\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.380\nBut the key is to establish that\nrapport as quickly as you can and\n\n400\n00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.480\nget people on your side where they'll\nactually buy in to what you need to do so\n\n401\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.710\nthat barriers can be\novercome a lot quicker.\n\n402\n00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:15.320\nIf not, they'll let you find the barriers\non your own, as you stumble through it,\n\n403\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.530\nthen they'll kind of point\nyou on the right path, but\n\n404\n00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.350\nthen they'll let you stumble again.\n\n405\n00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:23.110\nMost of the time if you established\na correct rapport at the very beginning,\n\n406\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.322\nthey will help you through the process and\novercome those barriers a lot quicker.\n\n407\n00:21:27.322 --> 00:21:30.750\nAnd so\nit is something that you do have to learn.\n\n408\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.061\nIt's something else that you have\nto make sure you understand, too.\n\n409\n00:21:33.061 --> 00:21:36.813\nAlso, you've gotta realize\nthat your message,\n\n410\n00:21:36.813 --> 00:21:41.860\nit may actually apply to not\neverything that they need to hear.\n\n411\n00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.210\nSo, in other words, you might find out\nthat your message is overwhelming.\n\n412\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.620\nThat you're trying to give\nthem too much information.\n\n413\n00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.530\nWell, this is your point here when you\ncommunicate, especially in details here.\n\n414\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.120\nMake sure you only share with them\nwhat they really need to hear.\n\n415\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.530\nNow, that doesn't mean you go,\nyou don't need to know that.\n\n416\n00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.670\nI don't think you should ever say that.\n\n417\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.340\nI think you can tell them, though, that,\n\n418\n00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:08.360\nlook, this is what affects your particular\nportion of getting our project done.\n\n419\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.670\nThis is what you need to understand.\n\n420\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:10.490\n&gt;&gt; What you focus on.\n\n421\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.032\n&gt;&gt; You should focus on that.\n\n422\n00:22:12.032 --> 00:22:13.549\nSomebody might go,\nI have a question on that.\n\n423\n00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:15.800\nSay, we can answer those questions.\n\n424\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.350\nBut let's make sure you understand\nwhat it is you're focused on first.\n\n425\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.100\nAnd then we can answer other questions.\n\n426\n00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.260\nNow if they ask for\ninformation they're not supposed to have,\n\n427\n00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.710\nsay look I can't tell\nyou that information.\n\n428\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.040\nYou don't ever tell them like,\nthat's not relevant to you.\n\n429\n00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.150\nEven though it might not be.\n\n430\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.740\nBut, you go,\n&gt;&gt; Come across rude.\n\n431\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it comes across rude.\n\n432\n00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.080\nAnd that's what you don't want to do.\n\n433\n00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.530\nSo tailoring your particular message\nto whoever you're talking to,\n\n434\n00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.690\nmaking sure that they understand\nwhat you want them to focus on\n\n435\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.250\nis gonna be more key than overwhelming\nthem with too much information.\n\n436\n00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.700\nSo another barrier is that idea where\nyou flood them with so much information\n\n437\n00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.130\ntheir minds literally don't know what\nto hold onto and what to get rid of.\n\n438\n00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.000\nSo instead,\n\n439\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.440\nmake your points clear, tailor it to\nactually what needs to happen as well.\n\n440\n00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.720\nAnd that will always get you a better\n\n441\n00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.050\nbuy in from whoever you're working with,\nrather than not.\n\n442\n00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.760\n&gt;&gt; A lot of that will come from\nexperience also, because there are so\n\n443\n00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.380\nmany different personality types,\n\n444\n00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.530\nand trying to conform to a style that\nworks best with that individual.\n\n445\n00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:22.440\nSo you might just need to kind of\nunderstand your communication style before\n\n446\n00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.340\nyou really go ahead and look at that,\nhow your delivering it.\n\n447\n00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.540\nYour delivery method.\n\n448\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe combination of both is the key.\n\n449\n00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.240\nThat's what we call it\nthe idea of criticality here.\n\n450\n00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.420\nWhat you may end up finding out is\nthat something of a critical nature.\n\n451\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.650\nYou go that probably\nshouldn't be on Facebook.\n\n452\n00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:44.468\nAnd so you actually tailor what you want\nto say and you actually choose the right\n\n453\n00:23:44.468 --> 00:23:49.002\nmethod to make sure that you make\nthe impact that you need on that message.\n\n454\n00:23:49.002 --> 00:23:54.515\nSo in that sense I mentioned in\nthe previous show on methodologies here.\n\n455\n00:23:54.515 --> 00:23:55.215\nFor example,\n\n456\n00:23:55.215 --> 00:23:58.785\nan in person type of meeting you might\nthink of someone firing somebody.\n\n457\n00:23:58.785 --> 00:24:02.119\nWell that's something you\ndefinitely want to do in person.\n\n458\n00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:04.708\nIt's not something you\nwanna do over an email or\n\n459\n00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:07.757\nover Twitter like somebody\nmentioned in our chat room.\n\n460\n00:24:07.757 --> 00:24:11.590\nThat's not a great way to\nhave any type of rapport.\n\n461\n00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.460\nThe critical nature of what you\ndo should help you to choose\n\n462\n00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:20.250\nthe proper methodology that overcomes\nany barriers that you might have.\n\n463\n00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.990\nWhen you can't see that, when you can't\nsee the critical nature of your message,\n\n464\n00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.420\nwell you're not gonna be able to\npick the right methodology anyways.\n\n465\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.500\nSo it's always important okay that when\nyou do make some type of decision as\n\n466\n00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.440\ncritical to the progress\nof your project here.\n\n467\n00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:43.830\nYou wanna make sure that it's in person,\nokay.\n\n468\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.190\nAnd a lot of times if you can to\nmake sure everybody understands\n\n469\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.880\nwhy the decision is being made.\n\n470\n00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.470\nSo even a public announcement is\nsomething that's actually a good thing.\n\n471\n00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.250\nNow if you're trying to\nclose a project quietly,\n\n472\n00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:59.340\nokay, well that's a different story\ninstead but that's the idea here, okay?\n\n473\n00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.820\nSo you don't want to terminate somebody in\npublic Is a good example of this, okay.\n\n474\n00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.340\nBut you do want to make it in person,\nokay?\n\n475\n00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.110\nSo make sure that you understand that,\nyeah,\n\n476\n00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:14.640\nit really depends on the critical\nnature of your particular message\n\n477\n00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.585\nthat needs to be conveyed to everyone\nthat's part of your project team as well.\n\n478\n00:25:19.585 --> 00:25:20.385\nOkay.\n\n479\n00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:26.305\nNow that actually does bring us to a final\npoint that we need to understand here.\n\n480\n00:25:26.305 --> 00:25:29.775\nWhich is that there's gonna be\nsome particular requirements\n\n481\n00:25:29.775 --> 00:25:31.395\nthat you gonna have to meet.\n\n482\n00:25:31.395 --> 00:25:34.565\nAnd that's why it is very important that\nyou're gonna be able to do this quickly\n\n483\n00:25:34.565 --> 00:25:37.670\nand on a fly because you actually\nare on a time constraint, right?\n\n484\n00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.240\nYou might find out something that\nthe frequency that you communicate\n\n485\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.340\noverall status messages to your team is\nsomething you have to do periodically.\n\n486\n00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.870\nIf you're gonna tell them that\nit's gonna be once a week,\n\n487\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.380\nmake sure you do it once a week.\n\n488\n00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.680\n&gt;&gt; And\nif you have a project charter set forth,\n\n489\n00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.140\nthen that should be noted ahead of time.\n\n490\n00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.770\nSo it just kinda keeps you on track,\nright, Ronnie?\n\n491\n00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.110\n&gt;&gt; It should be, yeah.\n\n492\n00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.340\nOverall these are things which should\nalready be established in terms of\n\n493\n00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.210\nthe actual project plan itself.\n\n494\n00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.750\nWhen they happen but the key is\nmaking sure that they happen okay.\n\n495\n00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.420\nNobody wants to hear and\n\n496\n00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:11.360\nI mean this, you say I'm gonna\ngive a progress report every week.\n\n497\n00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.990\nAnd first one you given on the week and\n\n498\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:17.270\nthe second one it's a month later, third\none is a month and a half way later, and\n\n499\n00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.080\nthen the fourth one is It was a week\nlater but you really didn't do anything.\n\n500\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.110\nNobody wants that.\n\n501\n00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.460\nIt's sporadic, it doesn't tend to happen.\n\n502\n00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.670\nMake sure you understand the frequency and\n\n503\n00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:30.390\nsometimes the frequency is depending\nupon that particular time period.\n\n504\n00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.110\nYou might find out as you're moving\nthrough a more critical stage in your\n\n505\n00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.810\nproject, you might give\nupdates a lot quicker and\n\n506\n00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.800\na lot more up to date information.\n\n507\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.030\nBecause you're actually saying yes,\n\n508\n00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.020\nwe're still progressing or\nthis is a make or break.\n\n509\n00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.800\nWe've got to make sure we get through this\nweek, so I'm going to be reporting every\n\n510\n00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.490\nsingle day, what's going on here,\nthat you know we're making progress.\n\n511\n00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.370\nAt any point if we stumble along it\nI'm gonna let you know immediately so\n\n512\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.610\nwe can do other things that we need to,\nto account for that as well.\n\n513\n00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.570\nUnderstand the level of detail\nthat you're gonna be giving\n\n514\n00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.090\ndepending on who you're talking to, right?\n\n515\n00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:07.390\nTo the project sponsor, you may give\nevery single detail that they need.\n\n516\n00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.590\nTo the project champion,\n\n517\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.840\nyou may give them details along with\ntechnical information that you may need.\n\n518\n00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.030\nBut just realize that you do need\nto make sure that you tailor that\n\n519\n00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.020\nto what we're talking about as well.\n\n520\n00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.490\nMake sure you of course have\nthe established plan of communication\n\n521\n00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.950\nin the official channel in\nthe way that it needs to and\n\n522\n00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:29.330\nthat you don't violate any type\nof confidentiality as well okay.\n\n523\n00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:34.590\nAll those are actually key factors for\nus when we talk about the idea of\n\n524\n00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.000\nstakeholder types of\ncommunication requirements okay.\n\n525\n00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.110\nWithout those you're gonna communicate\nsomething you don't mean to communicate\n\n526\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.990\nYou're gonna communicate it and\nthey're gonna come back and\n\n527\n00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:45.460\nfind from another stakeholder.\n\n528\n00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.140\nAnd that's not exactly\nwhat he should have said.\n\n529\n00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.170\nYou name it.\nAll of these are really big possibilities.\n\n530\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:54.390\nSo not only is the method important but\n\n531\n00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.990\nunderstanding the barriers to\nwhatever method that you gonna choose\n\n532\n00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.620\nis also important so that you understand\nwhat you need to overcome them.\n\n533\n00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.710\nAnd we've just taken a look at a whole lot\nof them, hopefully you'll be able to pull\n\n534\n00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.220\nsome information from what\nwe've just said here,\n\n535\n00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.520\nto help your communication in your project\nmanagement to be much more effective.\n\n536\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie, I think you've done\na great job showing us how to go ahead and\n\n537\n00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.690\nlook at those communication factors.\n\n538\n00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.480\nI appreciate that and I appreciate\nall of you for tuning in with us.\n\n539\n00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.580\nBut stay tuned we have\nmore coming your way.\n\n540\n00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.410\nWe have some more project plus.\n\n541\n00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:26.400\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n542\n00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.670\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n543\n00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.181\n&gt;&gt; Signing off have a great day.\n\n544\n00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:36.357\n[MUSIC]\n\n545\n00:28:36.357 --> 00:28:39.304\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.400\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.514\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:15.950\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.030\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.469\nIn this episode we're going to be\nlooking at CompTIA's Project+ and\n\n8\n00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:24.281\nwe're going to be explaining\ncommunication triggers.\n\n9\n00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:26.260\nWith us today, we have Sir Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.730\nThank you for coming today Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back here\nas we take a look at CompTIA Project+.\n\n12\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.820\nAnd we are continuing on taking with\nsome of the communication factors.\n\n13\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.350\nAnd, we are actually on that\nparticular point in our shows,\n\n14\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.690\nwhere we are also talking\nabout communication triggers.\n\n15\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.445\nNow, you might hear that word.\n\n16\n00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:50.210\nyWou might hear that term but you are not\nexactly sure what we mean by that.\n\n17\n00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.110\nSo we actually normally deal\nwith it two particular context\n\n18\n00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.980\nin project management...\n\n19\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.340\nWe start talking about triggers.\n\n20\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.190\nThe first contact that you\ndeal in terms of triggers\n\n21\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.990\nis the idea of risk manage, okay.\n\n22\n00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.080\nAnd what we want to actually have,\n\n23\n00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.530\nwhen we deal with the realm of\nrisk management is the very fact.\n\n24\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.140\nThat we want to have some type of\noral warning that a risk is about to\n\n25\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.240\ntake place.\n\n26\n00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.130\nOr is actually happening as it goes on.\n\n27\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.410\nSo we talk about this idea of being what\nwe call a risk trigger as well, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.630\nThe other places that we also need to\naddress this is in terms of communication\n\n29\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.350\nplans and patterns as well.\n\n30\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.030\nAnd that's what we also want to indicate,\ntoo.\n\n31\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.380\nThat what we should have is this ability\nto have certain things inside of our\n\n32\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.900\nproject itself.\n\n33\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.450\nThat really that trigger us to\nactually have more communications.\n\n34\n00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.550\nOr to actually have proper\ncommunications that are in place.\n\n35\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.750\nTo make sure that the information that we\nneed is related to the right people at\n\n36\n00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.470\nthe right time and for the right reason.\n\n37\n00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.130\nSo normally when we talk\nabout communication triggers,\n\n38\n00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.560\nwe normally need to identify who's\ngonna be the actual audience, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.860\nAnd also,\n\n40\n00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.930\nhow often are we actually talking about\nsomething like this happening as well.\n\n41\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.910\nAnd then lastly, we want to make sure\nthat we understand the rationale.\n\n42\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.540\nOr the reason behind this being a trigger\nand what it really needs to help us to do.\n\n43\n00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.095\nNow you may be wondering,\nwhy do we need that?\n\n44\n00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:18.538\nBecause we don't want it to be\nsomething which catches us off guard.\n\n45\n00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:22.350\nWe want to make sure that we understand\nthat if this events that we're about\n\n46\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.740\nto talk about end up happening.\n\n47\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.590\nThat there should be some type\nof communication that goes on.\n\n48\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.940\nSo that everybody is on the same page or\n\n49\n00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.050\nunderstands that something\nis supposed to occur next.\n\n50\n00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.789\nSo normally when we have that,\nthat's what we want to happen.\n\n51\n00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.900\nSo that's what we're going to take a look\nat when we start talking about the idea\n\n52\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.580\nof triggers.\n\n53\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.390\nThe entire goal of setting up a trigger\nis the same way that we set one up for\n\n54\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.530\nthe idea of managing risk, right.\n\n55\n00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.260\nIt's to help us to anticipate\nwhat is about to happen.\n\n56\n00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.790\nNow in communication triggers,\n\n57\n00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.530\neven though we can talk about\nthem in terms of risk management.\n\n58\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.370\nA lot of times it's to really indicate\nthat we're moving on from whatever has\n\n59\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.360\njust happened.\n\n60\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.230\nAnd that we're supposed to be proceeding.\n\n61\n00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.910\nWe're not supposed to be going back and\nrehashing it again and\n\n62\n00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.070\nrethinking it in project management.\n\n63\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.630\nBecause time has to be\nmanaged as a resource.\n\n64\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.000\nYou also have to think about that,\nthat still progress has to continue on,\n\n65\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.396\nand that we need this.\n\n66\n00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:25.220\nSo we want to make sure that we can\nidentify what those triggers are.\n\n67\n00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.470\nand then of course, talk about what\ncontrols actually need to go on.\n\n68\n00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.010\nOr what has to happen when we\nfind this things triggering\n\n69\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.036\nthe actions that they need to.\n\n70\n00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:37.860\nSo, we want to start taking a look and\n\n71\n00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.735\nwe've got quite a few of them\nthat we need to go through.\n\n72\n00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:43.160\nAbout 10 or\n11 Ddfferent types of triggers here/.\n\n73\n00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.060\nBut let's make sure we do cover\nall of them to ensure that\n\n74\n00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.770\nwe understand what's happening, okay?\n\n75\n00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.950\n&gt;&gt; Sure, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the first one we have here.\n\n76\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.080\nIt looks like audits.\n\n77\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so when we start talking\nabout the idea of auditing.\n\n78\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.920\nAny time that you have\nan audit that goes on,\n\n79\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.080\nyou got to understand\nthe purpose of the audit itself.\n\n80\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.720\nAnd normally who audits are actually\ngoing to be, you know, given for as well.\n\n81\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.360\nSo sometimes audits are demanded, right.\n\n82\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.540\nWhen something goes wrong with\ninside of our project and\n\n83\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.840\nwe're not sure what has happened here.\n\n84\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.290\nWe may call for an audit and\nthat way they can actually discover\n\n85\n00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.160\nwhat should have happened\nversus what did happen.\n\n86\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.580\nSo, it might be where it is\nactually an on call thing.\n\n87\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.980\nBut the other thing that we can do is\njust have a regularly scheduled audit.\n\n88\n00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.090\nIn terms of something\nthat's very periodic.\n\n89\n00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.530\nThat happens on a regular basis\n\n90\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.240\nto ensure that we're still attracting\nthe right way as well, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.150\nAnd the reason why we need an audit\nsystem of some sort, right?\n\n92\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.090\nIs because without this, we might not\nknow what we're way out of bounds,\n\n93\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.510\nlet's say on cost\nmanagement at some point.\n\n94\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.710\nBut we might find out that hey\nthe audit's going okay, but\n\n95\n00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.690\nwe still need more details on this, so\nthat we get a better and fuller picture.\n\n96\n00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.850\nAnd so, even though audits are something\nthat we don't like to hear about.\n\n97\n00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.550\nBecause it makes us having to go back and\n\n98\n00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.310\naddress things like\ncompliance issues sometimes.\n\n99\n00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.540\nSpending issues that we have to have or\nrecord keeping issues.\n\n100\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.250\nIt is something good for us,\nbecause it actually keeps us on track.\n\n101\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.450\nSo, when we start thinking about that who\nis normally the audit when is called for.\n\n102\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.910\nWell normally, it's going to be\nthe project manager himself, okay.\n\n103\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.870\nThe PM is normally who is going\nto actually be given the audit.\n\n104\n00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.010\nAs far as a report goes and\neven the project sponsor and\n\n105\n00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.640\nsometimes the stakeholders.\n\n106\n00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.590\nDepending on where they\nare in the project or\n\n107\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.180\nwhere in the project they are as\nfar as the progress goes.\n\n108\n00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.140\nAnd the whole goal behind most\nof the general regular periodic\n\n109\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.670\ntypes of audits is to track the spending.\n\n110\n00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.300\nIt's to track whether requirements\nare actually getting done.\n\n111\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.240\nIt's to track whether or\n\n112\n00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.780\nnot we're actually still on time to be\nable to do everything that we need to.\n\n113\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.290\nSo in that sense, right.\n\n114\n00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.570\nWhat is an audit doing in\nterms of triggering, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.125\nWell, it could actually trigger where\nwe're suppose to have action, okay.\n\n116\n00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:08.700\naAd normally, most auditors\nreports end up telling us that,\n\n117\n00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.290\nokay is that here's a audit we find\neverything actually in good standing.\n\n118\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.300\nBut you may see where they also have\nwhat they call recommendations that need\n\n119\n00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.300\nto be made.\n\n120\n00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.700\nAnd so normally, the idea behind that is,\n\n121\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.040\nyou actually implement those\nrecommendations in a timely fashion.\n\n122\n00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.180\nOr in a regular fashion, so\nthat next time an audit occurs,\n\n123\n00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.410\nthose things are actually taken care of.\n\n124\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.620\nSo usually, that's what we see in terms\nof a communication Type of trigger.\n\n125\n00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.940\nSo this is where the project\nmanager gets that report and\n\n126\n00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.740\nhe actually has that communication.\n\n127\n00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.870\nAnd then the project manager says,\nhere's what our budget\n\n128\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.620\nauditor said or\nhere's what our time auditor said.\n\n129\n00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.280\nHere is where we are in our scope and\n\n130\n00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.730\nhere is what we need to\ndo to get back on track.\n\n131\n00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:57.690\nThat triggers them, the project manager\n\n132\n00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.490\nto either request more resources or\nto get back to managing his project teams.\n\n133\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.800\nAnd saying,\nhey here's what needs to be done.\n\n134\n00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.610\nAuditing itself and doing audits\n\n135\n00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.130\nis a type of trigger that should lead\nto some type of response like that.\n\n136\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.580\nWe start taking a look.\n\n137\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.600\n&gt;&gt; Great, so that's auditing.\n\n138\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.550\nNext up is project planning.\n\n139\n00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthe project planning is of course by far,\n\n140\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.930\nthe largest part of everything.\n\n141\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.470\nThat we've talked about in the CompTIA\nProject+ show that we're doing here and\n\n142\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.490\nthe reason why is It really is.\n\n143\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.330\nThe project plan itself is the guide book.\n\n144\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.960\nthe overall standard that we\nmust follow in compliance.\n\n145\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.550\nthat we must follow to ensure\nthat everything happens.\n\n146\n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.520\nSo normally,\nonce we get the charter on hand.\n\n147\n00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.984\nThis is when we begin to work on Every\naspect to planning out the management of\n\n148\n00:07:50.984 --> 00:07:52.255\nour project, okay.\n\n149\n00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:54.239\nNow, the neat thing about this is,\n\n150\n00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:57.424\nthat it actually does happen\nbased off a trigger as well.\n\n151\n00:07:57.424 --> 00:08:01.948\nSo, project planning itself Its trigger\nis once we actually get the project\n\n152\n00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.810\ncharter signed,\nthat's when the planning part begins.\n\n153\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.830\nWe don't begin the planning and\nthen get the project charter.\n\n154\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.760\nWe normally get the charter first and\nthen the planning of\n\n155\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.360\nthe project management begins\nat that particular point.\n\n156\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.030\nNow once we have that\nproject plan in hand and\n\n157\n00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.071\nit's actually been now reviewed\nusually by the project manager,\n\n158\n00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:26.635\nas well as maybe subject matter experts\nwho contribute some information.\n\n159\n00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:30.923\nAnd even the project champion giving\nus some technical guidance on what also\n\n160\n00:08:30.923 --> 00:08:34.920\nneeds to occur to make sure that\nentire project scope is met.\n\n161\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.960\nWe also end up seeing then that\nthe project plan itself becomes a trigger,\n\n162\n00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.930\nthat once it's now signed off on, and\n\n163\n00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.690\neverybody agrees, that is when\nthe execution phase itself and\n\n164\n00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.940\nthe monitoring and\ncontrolling can also begin too.\n\n165\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.559\nSo inside of that project planning,\nwhat we hope to happen as well,\n\n166\n00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:58.938\nis that maybe we've addressed some of the\nrisk issues that may have happened, but\n\n167\n00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:00.912\noverall though we have a plan for it.\n\n168\n00:09:00.912 --> 00:09:03.192\nAnd that's what we also want to see.\n\n169\n00:09:03.192 --> 00:09:07.562\nSo project planning is something else that\ncan lead to a trigger, and usually for\n\n170\n00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:09.103\nus that trigger is, again,\n\n171\n00:09:09.103 --> 00:09:13.030\nbeginning the project itself in\nterms of execution and controlling.\n\n172\n00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, what about whenever there's\nany kind of change to the project?\n\n173\n00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.860\nHow would that go ahead and\naffect the overall communication?\n\n174\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.659\n&gt;&gt; Well, in this sense, a project change,\n\n175\n00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:26.480\nit should lead to probably\nthe most detailed level of\n\n176\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.120\ncommunication that we are going to have\nabout something that is about to happen.\n\n177\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.470\nAnd the reason why is once\nwe have a plan on hand,\n\n178\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.130\nand everybody's been reviewing the plan,\neverybody's been talking about it.\n\n179\n00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.270\nThey have an idea of what\nthey want to see at the end.\n\n180\n00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.970\nNow, if somebody says,\nI need to submit a change ticket, well,\n\n181\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:47.290\nat that particular point, it doesn't mean\nthat everybody understands how that change\n\n182\n00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:52.250\nis going to occur, how it's gonna happen,\nor even why it's going to happen.\n\n183\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.520\nSo whenever we have a project change,\n\n184\n00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.920\nit may change the entire\nscope of the project itself.\n\n185\n00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.260\nAnd when you have something like that,\nokay?\n\n186\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.500\nIt happens during the time when\nwe're normally executing and\n\n187\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.550\ncontrolling the project, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.250\nSo that means what?\n\n189\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.860\nWork has already been done\nup into that point and\n\n190\n00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.440\nnow somebody goes, wait a minute.\n\n191\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.670\nBefore we move on I've got to actually\ninitiate some type of change.\n\n192\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.954\nIf we don't have good\ncommunication about it,\n\n193\n00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:26.467\nthat means a change that ends up happening\nfor us may continue to actually go on.\n\n194\n00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:31.054\nAnd all of a sudden now a little\nrequirement that we thought no one would\n\n195\n00:10:31.054 --> 00:10:35.520\nnotice if I made a small tweak by\nmyself and no one else mentioned it.\n\n196\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.730\nNow it actually affects\nthe rest of the project too.\n\n197\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.480\nSo instead what we want to make sure that\nwe understand is that any type of project\n\n198\n00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:49.470\nchange should trigger a communication\nto whoever is actually responsible for\n\n199\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.340\nthe succeeding task,\n\n200\n00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.090\nI can't say it, succeeding task of\nwherever that change is going to be.\n\n201\n00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.506\nAnd also,\nwho's gonna implement that change?\n\n202\n00:10:59.506 --> 00:11:02.646\nAnd also the idea what we\ncall regression plan as well,\n\n203\n00:11:02.646 --> 00:11:05.510\nin which it gives us\nsteps to back out of it.\n\n204\n00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.780\nIf the change that we choose implement\nisn't actually working the way that\n\n205\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.690\nwe think it should.\n\n206\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.130\nSo project changes and\n\n207\n00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.990\nnormally aren't going to be targeted for\njust about every stakeholder.\n\n208\n00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.900\nUsually the project sponsor\nmay also be a part of it if it\n\n209\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.050\nactually affects the entire project scope.\n\n210\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.820\nThe project manager needs to\nunderstand what's gonna happen so\n\n211\n00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.880\nthat he realizes he needs to adjust for\ntiming, scheduling, and\n\n212\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.810\nof course resources to be available for\nthe change too.\n\n213\n00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.410\nSo there's a lot that goes on here but\n\n214\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.250\nthis type of thing of course is what\nleads us once we actually get that\n\n215\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.850\nproject change approved leads us\nto changing the project itself.\n\n216\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.980\nSo that is another type of trigger.\n\n217\n00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.701\nIn other words, we shouldn't just\nget a change ticket and go okay,\n\n218\n00:11:45.701 --> 00:11:46.812\nchange ticket, big deal.\n\n219\n00:11:46.812 --> 00:11:50.833\nJust toss it onto a stack of papers and\na change doesn't happen, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:54.088\nSo it should lead us to actually\nimplementing some sort of change, and\n\n221\n00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:57.420\nmaking sure that we are communicating\nthat this is happening.\n\n222\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.490\nSo everybody is on the same page in\nterms of where the project is heading.\n\n223\n00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:06.440\n&gt;&gt; Now how do risk register updates\nfall into this situation as triggers?\n\n224\n00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is actually very important\nespecially when we start dealing with\n\n225\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:15.440\nthe idea of risk because naturally that\nis where we tend to also have triggers.\n\n226\n00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.450\nWe want to make sure that we have\nthe idea of what we can anticipate\n\n227\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.980\nin the future as a risk.\n\n228\n00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.560\nWell, we might have\nencountered one risk then,\n\n229\n00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.530\nthat has now demonstrated to us, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:34.290\nThat what we have to actually have on hand\nis something else that's about to happen.\n\n231\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.820\nSo the risk register essentially\ngives us that idea, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.280\nAnd then we come up with a risk\nscore in which we can now write.\n\n233\n00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.990\nAnd then we start taking that score,\ntaking a look at our schedule and\n\n234\n00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:52.020\nthen we can anticipate when we\nexpect to see that risk occur.\n\n235\n00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.650\nNow the problem is this, right.\n\n236\n00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.860\nBecause we're now already\nimplementing execution and\n\n237\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.150\ncontrolling during this particular point,\nupdating it means that\n\n238\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.610\nyou've got to realize that change is\ngoing to happen during the project.\n\n239\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.530\nAnd that the more risks that happen,\nthe more changes are going to go on there.\n\n240\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.850\nSo what we want to do is make sure\nthat we have an appropriate plan, and\n\n241\n00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.140\nthat what ends up happening is that\nwe do have a risk management plan\n\n242\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.510\nthat's going to help us as\nwe anticipate these changes.\n\n243\n00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.210\nSo it should not be where\nwe just make an ad hoc or\n\n244\n00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:29.990\nan on the fly type of\nresponse to the risk.\n\n245\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.880\nBut it's something in which we should have\nalready addressed on how we want that\n\n246\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.379\nchange to be managed, I mean that risk\nto be manage a little bit better.\n\n247\n00:13:37.379 --> 00:13:41.381\nAnd that is also going to help\nus out in this instance and\n\n248\n00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:45.620\nmaking sure everybody\nunderstands that here it is.\n\n249\n00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.440\nThe risk register such\nit is a trigger one and\n\n250\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.030\nwe update it cuz it means\neverybody needs to understand\n\n251\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.160\nwhat has changed as far as the risk\ngoes as the project develops.\n\n252\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.140\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n253\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.000\nNext up we have, milestones.\n\n254\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now a project milestone\nessentially is an event that happens for\n\n255\n00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.990\nour project that really\nhas no duration at all.\n\n256\n00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:12.780\nSo it doesn't cost us any real time\nresources or monetary resources.\n\n257\n00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.890\nIt's actually set there inside our\nproject plan, and to indicate,\n\n258\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.460\nit is a good time to review,\nokay, usually for a reason.\n\n259\n00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.750\nNow, the reason is whether or\nnot we want to continue forward, or\n\n260\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.070\nwhether we want to stop\nthe project as well.\n\n261\n00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.923\nLet's start talking about what we\ncall project, no, gate reviews or\n\n262\n00:14:31.923 --> 00:14:33.763\nsomething a little bit later on.\n\n263\n00:14:33.763 --> 00:14:35.338\nNow, normally-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say,\n\n264\n00:14:35.338 --> 00:14:37.057\nthis term sounds pretty familiar,\nlike a toll gate or-\n\n265\n00:14:37.057 --> 00:14:37.806\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n266\n00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:38.505\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n267\n00:14:38.505 --> 00:14:42.212\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's actually the same when\nyou start talking about milestones,\n\n268\n00:14:42.212 --> 00:14:44.030\ntoll gates, go/no go decisions.\n\n269\n00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.710\n&gt;&gt; Just depending on what\nvendor you're talking with.\n\n270\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:51.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, what particular project\nmanagement style that you learned.\n\n271\n00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.420\nBut here, when we start talking\nabout the idea of a milestone,\n\n272\n00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.970\nwe normally,\nthese are arbitrarily set a lot of times.\n\n273\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.840\nSo it's not because you've actually\nfinish selling is because you\n\n274\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.040\nmight have a day that you wanna see where\nis the progress and you know to be.\n\n275\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.370\nIf you're supposed to be 25% done\nwith the project at this point\n\n276\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.440\nthat could be considered a milestone and\n\n277\n00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.220\nthen you base it of to that your\nproject completion is at 18%.\n\n278\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.580\nYou're supposed to be at 25, well how\nfar behind does that actually take you?\n\n279\n00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.425\nAnd then that may lead to a decision\non whether or not you believe, and\n\n280\n00:15:22.425 --> 00:15:25.555\nyour team believes here whoever\nis actually part of it.\n\n281\n00:15:25.555 --> 00:15:28.894\nNormally the audience is the project\nmanager, sponsors, stakeholders,\n\n282\n00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:31.357\nscheduler, okay, and\neven the project coordinator.\n\n283\n00:15:31.357 --> 00:15:35.608\nIf all those people agree that yes,\nwe can make this up between now and\n\n284\n00:15:35.608 --> 00:15:38.687\nthe next milestone,\nyou may go ahead and say hey,\n\n285\n00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:43.262\nthis actually triggers us instead to say,\nlet's go ahead and continue.\n\n286\n00:15:43.262 --> 00:15:46.219\nOr if nobody agrees that this can be done,\n\n287\n00:15:46.219 --> 00:15:51.540\nthen it may issue another type of decision\nwhich says we might wanna stop and\n\n288\n00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:56.290\nreview this before we continue\nforward with our progress as well.\n\n289\n00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.143\nSo all of them are pretty much about the\nsame when you start hearing those terms,\n\n290\n00:16:00.143 --> 00:16:01.710\nlike what Cherokee mentioned.\n\n291\n00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.030\nI think I actually have it here.\n\n292\n00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.680\nWhat did I call it?\n\n293\n00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.290\nGate reviews.\n\n294\n00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.860\nI was trying to make sure\nthat I said that right.\n\n295\n00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.699\nBut milestones, gate reviews,\ngo-no-go decisions, whatever you want to\n\n296\n00:16:11.699 --> 00:16:15.725\ncall it they're pretty much kinda the same\naspect and idea of what you tend to see.\n\n297\n00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:16.640\nOkay?\n\n298\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.860\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nnext up we have schedule change, so\n\n299\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.930\nRonnie how does this differ between\nproject change versus schedule change?\n\n300\n00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.470\nThose terms seem pretty similar.\n\n301\n00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.680\n&gt;&gt; They really are.\n\n302\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.280\nWhen it comes down to the idea of a\nproject change,right, normally what we're\n\n303\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.412\ndoing there is we are changing the scope\nor the requirement of the project.\n\n304\n00:16:33.412 --> 00:16:34.100\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n\n305\n00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.720\n&gt;&gt; In schedule change though, we're\nactually changing the idea of the timing\n\n306\n00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.620\nof when events or\nwhen tasks happen instead.\n\n307\n00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.300\nNow that's always an important factor when\nwe start talking about a schedule change.\n\n308\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:51.002\nIt can involve, again, vendors, in terms\nof contractors that you may hire, team\n\n309\n00:16:51.002 --> 00:16:56.125\nmembers, stakeholders, the project manager\nitself, maybe even the project sponsor.\n\n310\n00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:58.452\nIf you actually do have-\n&gt;&gt; Any kind of dependent tasks.\n\n311\n00:16:58.452 --> 00:17:02.920\n&gt;&gt; Yep, any kind of dependent tasks\nthat you have available to you.\n\n312\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.670\nAnd now you actually have\nto be able to realize\n\n313\n00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:11.129\nthat this can affect the entirety of the\nthe schedule of the project itself,okay?\n\n314\n00:17:11.129 --> 00:17:14.740\nSo we actually have to understand\nthat changes in the schedule\n\n315\n00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.980\ncan really impact everything else\nbecause that's the idea working within\n\n316\n00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.770\nthe project constrains themselves.\n\n317\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.240\nBut we actually have to know when,\nwhere, and how much the project\n\n318\n00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.210\nschedule overall is gonna be affected by\nany type of schedule change that we make\n\n319\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.060\nbecause this now actually means I might\nhave to get the project coordinator\n\n320\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.610\nto coordinate somebody else if it's\na resource that needs to be replaced.\n\n321\n00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:42.330\nI may have to actually reschedule\nthe job if nobody's available for\n\n322\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.910\nthose dates that I\noriginally had it planned.\n\n323\n00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.200\nThe project manager may have to\nactually go to the very point\n\n324\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.840\nof saying that this\nparticular schedule here\n\n325\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.240\nindicates that we're not gonna\nget the project done on time.\n\n326\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.290\nAnd then he has to let the project sponsor\nknow, who now makes a decision of whether\n\n327\n00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:03.150\nor not that's acceptable or not acceptable\nand what we have to do to get past it.\n\n328\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.895\nSo there's a lot of things in which a\nsingle little change here can cause a very\n\n329\n00:18:07.895 --> 00:18:10.420\nincredible rippling effect.\n\n330\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.790\nSo let's say for example,\nespecially in something like this,\n\n331\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.190\non a schedule change, sounds easy enough,\nyou delay it one week, no big deal.\n\n332\n00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.100\nBut now all of a sudden you find out\nthat you can't get anybody to come in on\n\n333\n00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.195\nthe week that you've delayed it.\n\n334\n00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:25.100\nWell, now you have to go to somebody\nelse and then by the time you do get\n\n335\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.970\nit scheduled you may find out\nyou don't have any money left.\n\n336\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.580\nSo you have to go all the way up to\nthe project sponsor to see if they can\n\n337\n00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.900\nactually get more money to be added\ninto the budget at a particular point or\n\n338\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.810\nif you have discretionary spending\nthat you can use for this as well.\n\n339\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.070\nYou don't want to pad your budget,\nbut at the same time,\n\n340\n00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:45.050\nyou don't want to use up all your\ndiscretionary spending unless you have to.\n\n341\n00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.390\nAnd only if you have to do that,\nremember that means it's gone for\n\n342\n00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.920\nlater on, as well.\n\n343\n00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.500\nSo there's a lot of changes\nthat end up happening.\n\n344\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.990\nSo realize that this is an indicator\nof some type of communication\n\n345\n00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.250\nthat also would need to go\non if we have these things.\n\n346\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.880\nAnd they'll happened,\nI'm not gonna say on the daily basis,\n\n347\n00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.990\nbut probably close in terms of\nscheduling changes cuz everybody\n\n348\n00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.450\nhas different schedules, you never\nknow when a child going to be sick and\n\n349\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.760\nwhen you're going to be ill and\nyou can't make it in.\n\n350\n00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.840\nYou never know when something actually\nends up happening were your delayed for\n\n351\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.960\nmore than you thought.\n\n352\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.820\nLet's just say for an example you have,\nthere's a car accident\n\n353\n00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.640\nbefore you get to work and\nit delays you for three hours one day.\n\n354\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.178\nSo I know I've actually been in one of\nthose where it literally did delay me for\n\n355\n00:19:27.178 --> 00:19:29.355\nthree hours before I was\nable to get in to work and\n\n356\n00:19:29.355 --> 00:19:31.520\nnot able to start when I needed to.\n\n357\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.980\nSo just kind of realize that there are\nthese types of things that should again\n\n358\n00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:42.010\nhelp us and say communication needs to\ntake place as we continue to carry on.\n\n359\n00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nnext up we have task initiation or\n\n360\n00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.410\ncompletion however you\nwanna word it there.\n\n361\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthis is the same thing that goes on within\n\n362\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.650\nany particular project\nduring the execution and\n\n363\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:59.360\ncontrolling phase in which you will have\ntasks that will begin as soon as one ends.\n\n364\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.800\nAnd we've talked about this in terms\nof task dependencies and, of course,\n\n365\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.870\nin terms of task predecessors as well,\nokay?\n\n366\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.670\nSo when you have something like this,\nessentially,\n\n367\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.660\nsomebody needs to know to track and\n\n368\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.670\nverify that this is actually done the way\nthat it's supposed to be done here, okay?\n\n369\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:20.420\nSo it helps us by assisting us in terms\nof scheduling so that we know that if\n\n370\n00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:25.490\na task ends early, that another task\ncan begin, if it's possible, okay?\n\n371\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:31.050\nAnd maybe even start earlier and\nthen possibly end earlier, as well,okay?\n\n372\n00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.300\nYou may find something like that out.\n\n373\n00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.330\nBut, you may actually find out that\neven if you are able to end, let's say,\n\n374\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.110\na day or two earlier, that the other\nteam that's supposed to pick up on\n\n375\n00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:44.650\nthe succeeding task says I know\nthat you're finished early, but\n\n376\n00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:48.880\nI really don't have anybody available to\nstart my end of the project until the day\n\n377\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.160\nI had scheduled, because I had\neverybody's scheduled up into that point.\n\n378\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.320\nThat's fine, as long as everybody\nunderstands that, okay?\n\n379\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:01.080\nIf your project team members and\nleaders are actually so\n\n380\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.090\nexcited about getting stuff done early\nthey may find themselves in what we call\n\n381\n00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:09.990\na constraint here in which they\nreally can't do anything but\n\n382\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.150\nwait on that particular person or\n\n383\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.000\nvendor contractor to finish\nwhat they actually have.\n\n384\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.630\nSo here you do have to take\na look at when stuff begins, and\n\n385\n00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.580\nwhen it ends, and\nthen keep track of that and\n\n386\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.730\nmake sure that everybody understands, even\nthough everything's finished early and\n\n387\n00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.340\nyou might be wondering,\nwhy are we sitting around here?\n\n388\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.060\nThere's good reason for it, and\ncommunicating that is going to be key, so\n\n389\n00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.410\nthat everybody understands\nwhat's happening.\n\n390\n00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:42.255\n&gt;&gt; Great Ronnie, it looks like we\nhave stakeholder changes up next.\n\n391\n00:21:42.255 --> 00:21:45.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNow this shouldn't happen very often,\n\n392\n00:21:45.585 --> 00:21:49.740\nokay, but it can, when you have\npeople that are switching out.\n\n393\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.230\nSo let's take for an example,\nI think I used this in a previous episode\n\n394\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.910\nthat there's a vendor that,\nyou go I wanna work with guy, okay?\n\n395\n00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.350\nAnd, they go, look it's fine, but\nI'm retiring from the business and\n\n396\n00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.990\nI've essentially sold this\nout to this guy, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.590\nWell, remember that when a change like\nthat happens, whoever you had confidence\n\n398\n00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:15.480\nin doing that job before, you may not\nhave confidence in now doing it now.\n\n399\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.310\n&gt;&gt; True story.\n\n400\n00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:20.615\nI had a midwife retire on me and when I\nwent into labor the greenhorn was on duty.\n\n401\n00:22:20.615 --> 00:22:22.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yeah.\n\n402\n00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.270\nAnd so, in that sense a very\nreal project sense there.\n\n403\n00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.970\n&gt;&gt; Is it bad that I think\nof labor as a project?\n\n404\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.589\n&gt;&gt; Well, it really is when it comes down\nthrough everything that we're talking\n\n405\n00:22:33.589 --> 00:22:34.590\nabout here.\n\n406\n00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:40.320\nBut, yes, this needs to be communicated,\nokay, because people don't understand\n\n407\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.480\nif your team is used to working with that\nteam specifically, and now they bring on\n\n408\n00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.060\nnew people, that would be a little\nbit harder for them to integrate in.\n\n409\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.930\nMost of the time everything's fine but\nin a stakeholder changes, okay,\n\n410\n00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:57.000\nsuch as something like that everybody\nneeds to have that understanding\n\n411\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.450\nthat is change and they'll be able\nto fulfill whatever they need to.\n\n412\n00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.810\nBut let's say, it's actually and it should\nnever happen with the project sponsor, but\n\n413\n00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.930\nlet's say at this point though, it's one\nof our stakeholders that's not really\n\n414\n00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.150\nintegrated into the project itself but\n\n415\n00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.904\nlet's say that they're a big financial\ncontributor toward the project.\n\n416\n00:23:13.904 --> 00:23:18.180\nWhen that changes, yes, everybody needs to\nknow because you might find out something\n\n417\n00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.730\nthat we can't even go on with the project.\n\n418\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.910\nYou might show up in the morning and\n\n419\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.800\nrealize something, yeah,\nthey've canceled that project.\n\n420\n00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.733\nSo make sure everybody understands that\nstakeholder changes are essential here\n\n421\n00:23:30.733 --> 00:23:34.779\nbecause they'll be directly affecting the\nteams that are actually in place as they\n\n422\n00:23:34.779 --> 00:23:36.300\ncontinue to do their project.\n\n423\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.650\n&gt;&gt; And here we see that term gate reviews.\n\n424\n00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that same thing that\nwe've talked about before, right?\n\n425\n00:23:41.452 --> 00:23:44.339\nWe wanna mention it for\nthe sake of completing this here, but\n\n426\n00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:47.352\nit's the same as when we've\ntalked about in milestones here.\n\n427\n00:23:47.352 --> 00:23:49.995\nGate reviews are on purpose reviews, okay,\n\n428\n00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:53.207\nthat say whether we are going\nto proceed with it or not.\n\n429\n00:23:53.207 --> 00:23:57.007\nMilestones that can be go and\nno go decision times, okay?\n\n430\n00:23:57.007 --> 00:24:00.655\nBut a lot of times, those are really\nmarking progress of where you should be,\n\n431\n00:24:00.655 --> 00:24:03.680\nand you may actually have\nthat same decision there.\n\n432\n00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.710\nBut sometimes though, you need to\nactually have, like understand,\n\n433\n00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.210\nwhat is the point of no return, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.540\nSo at some particular point, you might\ngo look, we're so close to the end.\n\n435\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.732\nWe need to finish this.\n\n436\n00:24:14.732 --> 00:24:18.310\nOr we're so close to the end, but\nwe're not accomplishing anything.\n\n437\n00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.690\nYou make a decision based on\nthings like that as well.\n\n438\n00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.740\nSo even if you actually spend\na lot of the income, or\n\n439\n00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:29.260\na lot of the money, for\nthat project you might find that you still\n\n440\n00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.290\nhave these different gate\nreviews that tell us up, okay.\n\n441\n00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:36.370\nSo in this one the audience is\ngonna be the project manager,\n\n442\n00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.530\nusually the stakeholders and\neven the project sponsor here.\n\n443\n00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.930\nThey are gonna be a part\nof making that decision and\n\n444\n00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:47.820\nhelping us at specific points in which\nthey've already said that needs to happen.\n\n445\n00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.790\nSo that they can review that.\n\n446\n00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.320\nSo usually you might find\nthem on a quarterly basis.\n\n447\n00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.780\nYou might find them based\narbitrarily along the way.\n\n448\n00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.540\nOr based on what happens after the first\nten tasks, we're gonna review and\n\n449\n00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.650\nsee whether or not we wanna continue on.\n\n450\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.180\nWe can even do stuff like that.\n\n451\n00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.770\nBut overall though,\nvery essential that everybody understands\n\n452\n00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.552\nthat at any time that the project\ncould be again stopped, okay?\n\n453\n00:25:09.552 --> 00:25:14.190\n[LAUGH] If necessary based\non what this review happens.\n\n454\n00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.828\nSo it actually does help people out\nwhen you start doing this, okay.\n\n455\n00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.670\n&gt;&gt; Great, the next step on our list\nhere is business continuity response.\n\n456\n00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nnow in terms of business continuity,\n\n457\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:28.160\nthis is a little bit stranger\nin what we have in place.\n\n458\n00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.116\nNow, in this sense, it is possible, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:32.116 --> 00:25:36.200\nThat [LAUGH] and I hope it doesn't ever\nhappen to you, but it is possible,\n\n460\n00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.370\nthat the project management\ncompany itself, it says look,\n\n461\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:45.348\nwe're no longer in that business,\nwe've sold out of what we have.\n\n462\n00:25:45.348 --> 00:25:48.460\nOr there has to be some type of\nbusiness continuity, in other words.\n\n463\n00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.680\nThe projects that they were\nmanaging still has to be completed.\n\n464\n00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.100\nWell, that's what also needs\nto be recognized, too.\n\n465\n00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.700\nSo when you have a business continuity\ntype of response that happens, right, what\n\n466\n00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.710\nyou're really saying at this point here is\nthat several things might have happened.\n\n467\n00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.970\nThe project sponsor may not be available\nanymore for one reason or another,okay.\n\n468\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.740\nSo God forbid, but let's say that\nthe project manager dies, okay?\n\n469\n00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.060\nYou get a new project manager on hand,\n\n470\n00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.785\nthere has to be some type\nof continuity to that.\n\n471\n00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:22.800\nAnd so everybody needs to understand\nwho the authority runs through and\n\n472\n00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.970\nwho they're gonna rely on to help\nget them through this as well, okay?\n\n473\n00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:30.250\nSo there's a lot of this that\nhelps to demonstrate, at least for\n\n474\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.760\nthe entire project team itself, right.\n\n475\n00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.330\nThat leadership is still\nleading even in absence of\n\n476\n00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.020\nthe direct leader that you mind\nof then as a project manager.\n\n477\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.930\nOr whoever it was,\nI shouldn't put it on you.\n\n478\n00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.280\nAnd that's a bad example.\n\n479\n00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.760\nBut you can kind of get the idea here,\nokay.\n\n480\n00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.430\nIs that business continuity again\nit should trigger something\n\n481\n00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.646\nthat says let's let the entire team know.\n\n482\n00:26:52.646 --> 00:26:55.710\nHere is Cherokee is gonna be\nheading up this new project and\n\n483\n00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.420\nwe need make sure that we give\nthe support that we need to.\n\n484\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.970\nAnd you know that's what we also what\nwe wanna make sure as well,okay?\n\n485\n00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.680\n&gt;&gt; And another type of incident that\nwe really don't want to happen but\n\n486\n00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.100\nit may would be any kind of.\n\n487\n00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.480\nWe need to address trigger that\nare associating with incidence responses.\n\n488\n00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n489\n00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.480\nThere is no doubt that what in the world\nare we talking about in terms of\n\n490\n00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.020\ninstances?\n\n491\n00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.940\nWell a lot of times it's\nan accident that may happen.\n\n492\n00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.730\nIt could be some type of emergency event.\n\n493\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.980\nBut usually a lot of times it\nis when our project itself\n\n494\n00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:30.330\ndoes not meet compliance\nstandards that are out there.\n\n495\n00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:34.270\nAnd now what we want to do, is we want\nto be able to communicate that and\n\n496\n00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.050\nget us back on track.\n\n497\n00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:40.990\nSo instead of us trying to decide whether\nor not it's something we need to address,\n\n498\n00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:44.530\nwhat we do in terms of an instant\ntype of response is this.\n\n499\n00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.940\nIs that once this is actually\nraised to the level of an incident,\n\n500\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.840\nwe automatically communicate.\n\n501\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.380\nHere is the plan that we\nare going to respond with and\n\n502\n00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.270\nhere's what need s to happen at this\nparticular point in our project.\n\n503\n00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:02.390\nThis should be one of those automatic\nhabitual types of communication,\n\n504\n00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:06.680\nnot the idea of guessing whether or\nnot it actually is something, okay.\n\n505\n00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.140\nSo, what we're suppose to do?\n\n506\n00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.500\nSo at this point that's why it\nis also considered a trigger.\n\n507\n00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.580\nAnd incident response needs\nto actually trigger for us,\n\n508\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.990\nat least, the idea that we are going to\nrespond appropriately and we're gonna sure\n\n509\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:25.230\nrespond according to a plan, and\nthat's what makes this happen too.\n\n510\n00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.880\nSo normally when we have this, remember,\nagain it's still project manager,\n\n511\n00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.070\nproject sponsor who's gonna be\nthe audience the majority of the time.\n\n512\n00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:35.960\nAnd then at that point\nalso people that will be\n\n513\n00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.620\nimplementing on the technical side.\n\n514\n00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.820\nIf it's a compliance type of\nimplementation, managerial implementation\n\n515\n00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.210\nwe have to make sure that all\nthose are actually in place and\n\n516\n00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.740\nthe response is appropriate, okay?\n\n517\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, we've almost\nmade it through the list here.\n\n518\n00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.540\nLast up, we have resource changes.\n\n519\n00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just like we've talked about\nin terms of business continuity\n\n520\n00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.850\na little bit, right?\n\n521\n00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:59.860\nWhen a resource change happens,\n\n522\n00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:05.340\nthis can be something that's devastating,\ndepending on the resource itself, okay?\n\n523\n00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.980\nIf now all of a sudden you can't get\neverything that you needed to, okay,\n\n524\n00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.800\nfrom this one vendor even though\nthey swore they could do it.\n\n525\n00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.420\nWell now, you have to rely on another one.\n\n526\n00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.060\nHave you tested the quality?\n\n527\n00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.210\nYou may not have tested\nthe quality at all.\n\n528\n00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:20.790\nYou may just say it looks the same,\nlet's just go ahead and run with it.\n\n529\n00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.560\nOkay, well that can trigger\nsomething that may not be good for\n\n530\n00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.340\nyour particular project here.\n\n531\n00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:31.315\nSo all the time, or anytime, not all\nthe time, anytime when there is a resource\n\n532\n00:29:31.315 --> 00:29:34.860\nchange throughout the entire\nproject itself, okay.\n\n533\n00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.440\nWe must make sure that everybody\nthat's involved in part of that\n\n534\n00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.820\nusing that resource is gonna\nunderstand what has happened and\n\n535\n00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.560\nwhy you chose to go through this, okay.\n\n536\n00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:52.750\nNow, if you don't, okay, and somebody now\nimplements whatever this piece of cloth or\n\n537\n00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.280\nwhatever it is that you implement in and\nnow it's start tearing that machinery.\n\n538\n00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.790\nWell, now you have a bigger\nexplanation to make.\n\n539\n00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:03.180\nThey are usually what you want to do, of\ncourse, is that when you have some type of\n\n540\n00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.840\nresource change, you wanna make sure\nthat it runs through some testing\n\n541\n00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.430\nbefore you actually really do\nto implement it out there.\n\n542\n00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.770\nTo have it do that.\n\n543\n00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.660\nSo, a resource change normally triggers\nfor us some type of testing or\n\n544\n00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.790\nsome type of quality assurance\nthat we have to go through,\n\n545\n00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:22.790\nto make sure that everything's gonna\nbe up to par in everything that we do.\n\n546\n00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:27.360\nSo all of these are that type of,\nwhen we start talking about events and\n\n547\n00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.170\ndifferent issues here, all these\ntriggers really should lead to some\n\n548\n00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:36.205\ntype of process in terms of communication\nletting everybody know whats going on.\n\n549\n00:30:36.205 --> 00:30:37.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie,\n\n550\n00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.765\nit looks like we made it through a dozen\ndifferent types of communication triggers.\n\n551\n00:30:41.765 --> 00:30:44.655\nSo guys, when you are studying\nout there just make sure that you\n\n552\n00:30:44.655 --> 00:30:48.475\nare able to recognize them and\nidentify them for the exam.\n\n553\n00:30:48.475 --> 00:30:50.415\nI think that's about it for this episode.\n\n554\n00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:53.705\nStay tuned we have more\nProject Plus coming your way.\n\n555\n00:30:53.705 --> 00:30:54.615\nI'm

TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.123 --> 00:00:16.943\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another CompTIA Project+\nepisode here at ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.943 --> 00:00:18.970\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.580\nToday, we're gonna be looking\nat controlled process,\n\n7\n00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.180\nchange control processes.\n\n8\n00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.000\nWith us, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.410\nThank you for being with us, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.160\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.290\nhaving me here as we continue on and\ntake a look at CompTIA Project+.\n\n12\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.600\nSpecifically talking about the idea of\nchange process and change control here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.573\nNow you might be wondering why what's\nthe big deal when we start mentioning\n\n14\n00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.630\nthis idea?\n\n15\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.330\nBut in projects remember that because\nwe work in a constraint triangle,\n\n16\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.308\nmaking sure that we actually understand\nthat we have to control our time,\n\n17\n00:00:49.308 --> 00:00:52.590\nour costs,\nas well as the overall project scope.\n\n18\n00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.468\nThat changes can normally\nany one of those three and\n\n19\n00:00:56.468 --> 00:00:58.580\nit's something that we have to deal with.\n\n20\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.810\nAnd the better that we deal with it, the\nbetter that we can manage those changes,\n\n21\n00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.700\nthe better off it's going to be for\n\n22\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.700\nus as we start managing our projects,\nas we continue to manage our projects.\n\n23\n00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.890\nBecause there is a constant that goes on.\n\n24\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.860\nAnd everybody's heard this old quote\nhere that change is constant, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.160\nSo we need to at least understand that for\nus, this is the idea,\n\n26\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.065\nis that we have to actually manage\nthose changes better, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:28.350\n&gt;&gt; All right, and so I can only imagine\nthat there are a slew of different type of\n\n28\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.370\nchanges that we may encounter\nduring the duration of the project.\n\n29\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.540\nSo, Ronnie, what would be some of\nthose common changes that we may see?\n\n30\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Well, a lot of the common changes\nthat you normally end up seeing\n\n31\n00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.290\nhappen all throughout the entirety\nof the project itself.\n\n32\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.620\nAnd the key here is to understand that\nbecause changes happen at any particular\n\n33\n00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.260\ntime, it's not that you're gonna see\nthat change is something unusual.\n\n34\n00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.750\nBut you're gonna see that it's\nactually something we just have to be\n\n35\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.790\nable to control.\n\n36\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.553\nSo normally when we start talking of some\nof the common changes, let's just take for\n\n37\n00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:00.180\nan example here a timeline change.\n\n38\n00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.740\nThis can happen for many various reasons.\n\n39\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.400\nLet's take for an example that you do have\na particular portion of your project.\n\n40\n00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.330\nAnd again,\nthis is never a great situation.\n\n41\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.130\nBut someone's on that project team,\nmaybe the project lead, or\n\n42\n00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.730\nmaybe someone on the team has\nhad a workplace accident.\n\n43\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.120\nAnd now the team is not functioning\nas well as they need to be, and\n\n44\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.340\nthere needs to be a little\nbit of time adjustment.\n\n45\n00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.740\nWell, you've gotta remember that that\ncan throw off the actual project entire\n\n46\n00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.170\ntimeline itself.\n\n47\n00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.613\nSo when something like that happens,\nit's not that you can't account for it.\n\n48\n00:02:33.613 --> 00:02:35.880\nIt's not that you don't know it exists.\n\n49\n00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.340\nThe key here is how do you manage that\nbetter, and what resources are available,\n\n50\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.080\nand what can you do about it?\n\n51\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.230\nSo we have to deal with things like time,\nas well.\n\n52\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.200\nThe other thing that can also happen\nis funding changes that can go on.\n\n53\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.800\nIt's strange, normally once you\nhave a project budget in place,\n\n54\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.650\nyou normally do not have to\nworry about a lot of situations.\n\n55\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.130\nI know you'll find this strange but\n\n56\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.190\nnot every single project starts off\nwith a pot of gold somewhere hidden.\n\n57\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.053\nBut they start off with a certain\namount of money and what do they do?\n\n58\n00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:10.300\nThey go to different places to\nfinance the rest of that project.\n\n59\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.060\nAnd you might find out something\nafter a while here that what you\n\n60\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.660\nthought was gonna be the finance of that\nproject doesn't actually end up happening.\n\n61\n00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.320\nAnd now you have to go and look for\nthe financial means somewhere else\n\n62\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.141\nin terms of either going to another\nlending institution or investors.\n\n63\n00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:27.721\n&gt;&gt; Investors.\n&gt;&gt; Borrowing something, investors, and\n\n64\n00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:29.570\nthat can also change as well.\n\n65\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.320\nAnd that can even change the way that\nyour project actually ends up developing.\n\n66\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.290\nSo you might even have things like that,\nokay.\n\n67\n00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.830\nOther changes here, of course,\ncould involve things like risk, okay.\n\n68\n00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.350\nSo as risk events happen,\n\n69\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.320\nwhat we call incidents, that end\nup going on Inside of our project.\n\n70\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.190\nWell, that can also cause a major\nchange in our project, too.\n\n71\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.600\nAnd usually, on this one.\n\n72\n00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.130\nThis is by far the one that's probably\nthe most visceral type of change\n\n73\n00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.190\nthat we feel as human beings.\n\n74\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.770\nAnd that's because risks normally\nbring up into our lives, right,\n\n75\n00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.500\nthe idea of just some type of\nreaction that we're supposed to have.\n\n76\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.710\nSo normally, when we hear that\nthe idea that this is risky and\n\n77\n00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.350\nwe actually start finding\nout why it's risky.\n\n78\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.600\nWe don't normally act with, hm, this is\nwhat I should have done about that risk\n\n79\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.480\nas it came on but we normally just react.\n\n80\n00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.930\nAnd usually those reactions may not\nactually be appropriate types of\n\n81\n00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.880\nreactions.\n\n82\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.630\nBut sometimes you do have to\nactually worry about those things.\n\n83\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.410\nSo, we need to understand that\nthey're gonna happen even when risk\n\n84\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.560\nhappen as well.\n\n85\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.870\nRequirement changes, remember\nproject sponsors and stakeholders.\n\n86\n00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.790\nThey again can request changes.\n\n87\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.100\nAnd it's not that it's bad,\nthey may actually be for\n\n88\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.660\nthe betterment of the project.\n\n89\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.820\nBut at the same time,\nwe need to understand when and\n\n90\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.570\nwhere they're gonna happen too.\n\n91\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.260\nQuality changes can also happen where\nwe actually do end up requiring\n\n92\n00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.140\na different quality.\n\n93\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.270\nOr we might find out whatever we\nimplemented in the process here,\n\n94\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.110\nit wasn't as good as we\nthought it was gonna be.\n\n95\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.867\nAnd we need to actually improve the\nquality of something in our project here.\n\n96\n00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:03.114\nAnd I always like using movies as\na reference because they really do help me\n\n97\n00:05:03.114 --> 00:05:05.060\nout when I think about this.\n\n98\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.960\nBut I've seen this idea in,\n\n99\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.840\nit was a movie from the 80s I think,\nI don't even remember when it was from.\n\n100\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.660\nBut it was where they were manufacturing\nhard drives, I believe is what it was.\n\n101\n00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.238\nAnd they found out that the air quality\nin that manufacturing plant was way lower\n\n102\n00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.091\nthan what it was supposed to be.\n\n103\n00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:27.790\nAnd the springs that they were\nputting in was of a cheaper quality.\n\n104\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.900\nAnd that when somebody finally questioned\nthem about it it was like, all right, so\n\n105\n00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.120\nwhat is it gonna take for\nus to get back on production?\n\n106\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.380\nAnd the guy said, you gotta actually\nstart from the beginning again cuz\n\n107\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.710\nevery single hard drive we've produced\nhas these lower quality springs.\n\n108\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.860\nThe air quality's bad.\n\n109\n00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.310\nWe have to start all over.\n\n110\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.230\nAnd somebody was about to just\ncry when they heard that.\n\n111\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.910\nSo yeah,\n\n112\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.560\nsometimes you actually do have where that\nquality change ends up happening as well.\n\n113\n00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.340\n&gt;&gt; And you know what's pretty cool,\nRonnie, is they have,\n\n114\n00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.427\nwhere was I watching off of Netflix,\na show about 3D printers.\n\n115\n00:05:56.427 --> 00:06:01.960\nAnd with these like kickstarter, these\nwebsites where they have public funding.\n\n116\n00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.760\nSo you have these individuals,\nthese engineers or these designers or\n\n117\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.880\nmaybe they just can't afford to\ngo ahead and fund their projects.\n\n118\n00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.403\nAnd they have an idea, they go ahead and\ndevelop it but maybe its not quite 100%.\n\n119\n00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:18.134\nAnd then when they go to trade shows like\nCES to go ahead and show their product\n\n120\n00:06:18.134 --> 00:06:22.650\noff, all these people who've contributed\nto that project, they're asking questions.\n\n121\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.420\nHow are you doing?\n\n122\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.760\nAnd when you have these little\nhiccups along the way or\n\n123\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.100\npieces that you need to refine,\n\n124\n00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.950\nit's kind of interesting when we see it in\nthat really open public forum like that.\n\n125\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.940\n&gt;&gt; And believe it or not, for somebody's\nstarting off doing a project like that,\n\n126\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.800\nthat's the best type of\nreview that they can get.\n\n127\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.660\nIs to actually say look,\nhere is what I really want to do.\n\n128\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.380\nYou bring it to a public\nforum in something like that.\n\n129\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.580\nAnd then you find out, here's the changes\nthat would really help your product.\n\n130\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.570\nAnd you might go, I really don't\nwant to do that but it's for\n\n131\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.610\nthe benefit of your project.\n\n132\n00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.790\nBut even if it is right, it's not-\n&gt;&gt; Might delay it and\n\n133\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.050\nyou've all ready heard all these\ncomplaints but still it is for\n\n134\n00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.100\nthe overall betterment of that project.\n\n135\n00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and even if you hear it, the\nproblem is this, is how do you implement?\n\n136\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.580\nHow do you actually know what's\nactually good and what's bad?\n\n137\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.560\nAnd this is where that change\nmanagement process comes in\n\n138\n00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.680\nto actually be able to go, that was\na good change that Cherokee recommended.\n\n139\n00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.180\nSo let's make sure we review it and\nwe understand it.\n\n140\n00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.770\nSo we might actually ask Cherokee\nto bring us a review of that and\n\n141\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.510\nto say why it would be better.\n\n142\n00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.880\nAnd justify and talk about the impact\nof what this change would be.\n\n143\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.030\nAlong with this of course\nare requirements, types of changes and\n\n144\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.920\nscope management, all these things, right?\n\n145\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.480\nThat's why that particular quote is\nactually so apt, that change is constant.\n\n146\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.455\nAnd even in project management,\nIt doesn't go away.\n\n147\n00:07:45.455 --> 00:07:48.763\nWe like to think that we can\nset everything in stone and\n\n148\n00:07:48.763 --> 00:07:50.611\nwork with our plan 100%.\n\n149\n00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:52.692\nAnd that there's no changes to our plan.\n\n150\n00:07:52.692 --> 00:07:57.511\nBut the very fact that time moves on,\ndeterioration happens over time.\n\n151\n00:07:57.511 --> 00:08:02.032\nThe fact that, one vendor that was there\nvery strong at the very beginning of your\n\n152\n00:08:02.032 --> 00:08:04.870\nproject is no longer\nin the market anymore.\n\n153\n00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.263\nSomeone ends up retiring from\nyour particular project and\n\n154\n00:08:08.263 --> 00:08:11.109\nnow you have to get somebody\nto fill their shoes.\n\n155\n00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:13.635\nIt could be now that\nthe project sponsor is saying,\n\n156\n00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:17.335\nI don't really see a value in this, and\nyou have to continue to motivate and\n\n157\n00:08:17.335 --> 00:08:20.009\ndo whatever it might be here\nto get them back on board.\n\n158\n00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:24.364\nBut whatever it is right, we have to\nunderstand that changes are gonna happen\n\n159\n00:08:24.364 --> 00:08:28.656\nthroughout our project and what we want\nto do as project managers is simple.\n\n160\n00:08:28.656 --> 00:08:32.959\nThat's not to say no, that's a change and\nwe don't want to deal with that right now,\n\n161\n00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:35.069\nand that may actually be a valid decision.\n\n162\n00:08:35.069 --> 00:08:39.170\nBut we want to evaluate those changes and\nverify that if we do implement\n\n163\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.492\nthem that we have a process and a manner\nto go through it that makes it easy.\n\n164\n00:08:43.492 --> 00:08:45.030\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you bring up a good point.\n\n165\n00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.110\nA lot of people do I think it's just\nkind of human nature sometimes to\n\n166\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.680\nmeet change with resistance.\n\n167\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.347\nAnd I've actually had the opportunity\nto experience it from\n\n168\n00:08:54.347 --> 00:08:56.550\nboth ends of that spectrum.\n\n169\n00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.701\nA poorly managed change process and\nyou come into work and\n\n170\n00:09:00.701 --> 00:09:03.652\nit's just like surprise, we did this.\n\n171\n00:09:03.652 --> 00:09:05.870\nAnd no one has a clue what's going on.\n\n172\n00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.269\nAnd then I've also been in situations with\ncompanies where they've done a really\n\n173\n00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:14.220\ngreat job at providing even required or\nsuggested reading ahead of time,\n\n174\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.640\nlike I can think of a couple of different\nfolks, one of them, Who Moved My Cheese?\n\n175\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.660\nI don't know if you've ever had of that,\nbut yeah so\n\n176\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.620\nit's just kind of prepping and then\nthere are certain steps that we need to\n\n177\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.890\ngo through to formally\nrequest that change.\n\n178\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.402\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you really do because\nimplementing changes and\n\n179\n00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:31.250\nI've mentioned this\nthroughout our series so far.\n\n180\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.480\nThat implementing changes ad\nhoc are never a good idea\n\n181\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.840\nbecause you don't know what\nit affects down the line.\n\n182\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.700\nYou may see it as being a valid change for\nthe better but you don't know if\n\n183\n00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.485\na tolerance was now changed,\nif it's something that in super precision\n\n184\n00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:50.515\ntypes of engineering that you're doing,\neven for that product model at that point.\n\n185\n00:09:50.515 --> 00:09:54.161\n&gt;&gt; And even from a logistical, not just\na logistical standpoint, but the morale.\n\n186\n00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:55.748\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; People get aggravated when they have\n\n187\n00:09:55.748 --> 00:09:57.475\nno clue what's going on,\nlike we mentioned before.\n\n188\n00:09:57.475 --> 00:10:00.465\nAnd they're like you don't respect\nme enough to tell me about these\n\n189\n00:10:00.465 --> 00:10:01.465\ntypes of changes.\n\n190\n00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:04.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and with a large project and\nas you think about it,\n\n191\n00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:07.948\nit may not even be that they didn't\nrespect you enough, they forgot.\n\n192\n00:10:07.948 --> 00:10:11.890\nThey made that change and they just\nforgot about it, and now, here it is,\n\n193\n00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.980\neverybody else down the line is like,\nwhy is this?\n\n194\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.090\nEverything was working well now,\n\n195\n00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.390\nnothing actually is able to be\nconfigured the way that it needs to, and\n\n196\n00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:25.640\nnow all of a sudden, it's like, yeah,\nI made that change, about six weeks ago.\n\n197\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.270\nI should've remembered and so\nyou have all these differences here, okay.\n\n198\n00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.570\nWhen it comes down to a project in\nwhich you have to manage everything in\n\n199\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.980\nthat time constraint, and then the cost\nconstraint, and the scope restraint here.\n\n200\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.910\nYou always have to consider that\nany change in your project,\n\n201\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.760\nokay, at some point needs\nto actually be controlled.\n\n202\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.526\nBecause without the control, right,\nwe don't know the overall impact or\n\n203\n00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:52.794\neffect of what that change may be and\n\n204\n00:10:52.794 --> 00:10:56.895\nthat's why we don't implement\nanything like that right away.\n\n205\n00:10:56.895 --> 00:11:01.270\nNow if you're wondering when in the world\nhas something like that happened?\n\n206\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.480\nLet me kind of give you a real world\nscenario that's happened to me.\n\n207\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.530\nI've set up multiple email servers\nbefore but there was this one\n\n208\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.180\ntime where I came in as kind of contracted\nin this way where somebody said,\n\n209\n00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.455\nI don't know what's happening our\nemail server after about four or\n\n210\n00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:22.330\nfive hours, or maybe even two or three\ndays it always locks up no matter what,\n\n211\n00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.881\nand I said well what are you using it for?\n\n212\n00:11:24.881 --> 00:11:29.326\nAnd they go, just regular emails, and they\nweren't sending a ton of emails it's not\n\n213\n00:11:29.326 --> 00:11:33.789\nlike they were generating 1,000 emails\na day or 10,000 emails a day, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:33.789 --> 00:11:36.610\nThey were just using it for regular email.\n\n215\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.060\nWell, when you're actually doing that\nyou're like we'll, what could go on and\n\n216\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.614\nwhat can end up happening.\n\n217\n00:11:41.614 --> 00:11:45.200\nWell, once we found out what was\nhappening was all the transaction logs\n\n218\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.165\nwere being filled up and there was no more\nspace on the hard drive to store them.\n\n219\n00:11:49.165 --> 00:11:52.610\nWe had to get rid of those transactions\nlogs and the way that you do it is simple.\n\n220\n00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.679\nYou do a regular daily back up and\n\n221\n00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:58.823\nit then actually automatically erases the-\n&gt;&gt; Export those to some sort of\n\n222\n00:11:58.823 --> 00:11:59.680\nremovable media?\n\n223\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.018\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but once you actually do that\nbackup those transaction logs disappear so\n\n224\n00:12:04.018 --> 00:12:07.570\nthat's the great thing is\nthat's all we had to set up.\n\n225\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.420\nWell it was a recommendation and\n\n226\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.856\nit was once you found out it's\nthis is what you need to do.\n\n227\n00:12:12.856 --> 00:12:15.060\nJust need to make sure\nyou're backing it up.\n\n228\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.160\nYou can do it probably once a week because\nof the mountain of email that you're doing\n\n229\n00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.790\non this server.\n\n230\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.900\nAnd say, that's a great idea, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.890\nGreat idea, I left, I didn't realize it,\nand then probably about three or\n\n232\n00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.360\nfour days later I got a call\nsaying it's happening again.\n\n233\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.020\nAnd then I was like well, okay,\n\n234\n00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.350\nso is everything running the way\nthat we set it up to run?\n\n235\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.493\nAnd they were like yeah,\neverything's set up that way and\n\n236\n00:12:36.493 --> 00:12:37.551\nI said is the backup running?\n\n237\n00:12:37.551 --> 00:12:38.854\nThey're like, what backup?\n\n238\n00:12:38.854 --> 00:12:41.176\nI was like,\nthe backup that I recommended running.\n\n239\n00:12:41.176 --> 00:12:44.578\nThey're like, no, we didn't do that.\n\n240\n00:12:44.578 --> 00:12:46.633\nWell, then you know that\nthat's what happened.\n\n241\n00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:48.983\nSo even though you might make\nthe recommendation, right?\n\n242\n00:12:48.983 --> 00:12:51.092\n&gt;&gt; Something was lost.\n&gt;&gt; Without your formal change here,\n\n243\n00:12:51.092 --> 00:12:52.890\nthat's what ended up happening.\n\n244\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.850\nSo you do have to make sure that\nyou understand what's going on\n\n245\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:57.980\nwhen this stuff happens.\n\n246\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.730\nSo that's really what we\nwant to talk about, as well.\n\n247\n00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.220\nSo when we start off\nwith this idea of change\n\n248\n00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.380\nwe really want to actually work through\nwhat Cherokee has mentioned here.\n\n249\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:14.730\nA process of managing the change, okay is\nwhat we want to actually be able to do.\n\n250\n00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.758\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at the\nsteps that we're normally going to cover.\n\n251\n00:13:18.758 --> 00:13:21.185\nNow, if you've been in project\nmanagement for a while,\n\n252\n00:13:21.185 --> 00:13:23.000\nyou have your own steps, okay?\n\n253\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.230\nAnd every organization you go to, they're\ngonna have their steps of doing it.\n\n254\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.540\nWe're covering the CompTIA methodology and\ntheir steps instead and\n\n255\n00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.010\nyou might wonder why are you doing\nthat when I know a different way?\n\n256\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.314\nWell, it's because that's what you're\ngonna find as you're preparing\n\n257\n00:13:36.314 --> 00:13:36.949\nfor the exam.\n\n258\n00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.720\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So let's make sure that we learn\n\n259\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.868\nthose steps is what we\nwant to be able to do.\n\n260\n00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:43.110\n&gt;&gt; We wanna be successful in that booth.\n\n261\n00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what is it that\nwe have to do first and foremost?\n\n262\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.519\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n263\n00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:50.235\nI've kind of summarized them,\n\n264\n00:13:50.235 --> 00:13:53.670\ntried not to put too many words\ndown as I start to look here.\n\n265\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.720\nBut the first thing is fairly simple,\nright?\n\n266\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.157\nWe wanna make sure we identify the change,\nitself, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.900\nSo once you start doing that,\n\n268\n00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.880\nthere's a couple of other\nactions that you can do, okay?\n\n269\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.407\nNow, that identifying the change\nthat needs to be made,\n\n270\n00:14:08.407 --> 00:14:12.228\nis something that really has to\nbe done but then documented and\n\n271\n00:14:12.228 --> 00:14:17.389\nthat's what we talk here about the change\nrequest documents and logs here, okay?\n\n272\n00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:21.170\nIt's not enough just for me to say\nCherokee we need to make this change okay?\n\n273\n00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.141\nIt really isn't as much as I might\nsay that, I'm not actually saying\n\n274\n00:14:25.141 --> 00:14:29.463\nthat anybody else is gonna know this but\nCherokee and myself at this point.\n\n275\n00:14:29.463 --> 00:14:32.975\nBut we need to have some type\nof way to identify that we're\n\n276\n00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:38.100\nsaying that there's an issue that exist\nand that a change needs to happen.\n\n277\n00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.750\nAnd so\nthis way I'm not depending on my memory,\n\n278\n00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.620\nI'm not depending on Cherokee's memory.\n\n279\n00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.020\nWe need to make sure\nthat we identify that.\n\n280\n00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:49.400\nWhen you start to look in the process\nof a project itself, right.\n\n281\n00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.590\nAs a project is on going, okay.\n\n282\n00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.751\nYou might find out that you have one\nof these scenarios like that where\n\n283\n00:14:55.751 --> 00:14:58.546\nit could be something that is failing and\nI go,\n\n284\n00:14:58.546 --> 00:15:02.777\nCherokee remind me next week that we\nneed to replace the bearing in that\n\n285\n00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:06.679\nparticular generator or\nthat that motor whatever it is, okay.\n\n286\n00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:08.286\nAnd Cherokee goes, got it!\n\n287\n00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:11.368\nAnd here it is next week comes by and\nCherokee's busy with her end of\n\n288\n00:15:11.368 --> 00:15:14.396\nthe project and two weeks later we\nstart hearing the squealing and\n\n289\n00:15:14.396 --> 00:15:18.109\nthen three days later after that it's\nnot squealing, it's just not working.\n\n290\n00:15:18.109 --> 00:15:19.047\n&gt;&gt; Parts start flying off.\n\n291\n00:15:19.047 --> 00:15:21.774\n&gt;&gt; Yeah parts start flying off and\nthen I remember saying,\n\n292\n00:15:21.774 --> 00:15:25.357\nCherokee you were suppose to\nremind me to change that bearing.\n\n293\n00:15:25.357 --> 00:15:27.946\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so, now I blame Cherokee and\n\n294\n00:15:27.946 --> 00:15:32.600\nCherokee goes, well why didn't you\nwrite it down so we could remember it?\n\n295\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.290\nShe's got a good point there.\n\n296\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.953\nSo, this idea of identification is not\njust about knowing that the problems\n\n297\n00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:39.049\nactually exist here.\n\n298\n00:15:39.049 --> 00:15:43.477\nIt's about understanding what happens and\nwhy we need to document.\n\n299\n00:15:43.477 --> 00:15:47.939\nSo, here I talked about the idea\nof what we call a change\n\n300\n00:15:47.939 --> 00:15:51.917\nrequest document and\neven a change request log.\n\n301\n00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:55.409\nThat you may actually have\nto fill out as well, okay?\n\n302\n00:15:55.409 --> 00:15:58.500\nSo, I've got an example\nof both these here.\n\n303\n00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.510\nSo, here's one that I have,\n\n304\n00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.680\nit's just a simple form that we've created\nat some point in the past here, for\n\n305\n00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.560\nactually project management\nof just about everywhere,\n\n306\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.016\nyou can actually find some of these forms,\nwhich you may go ahead and got.\n\n307\n00:16:11.016 --> 00:16:12.630\nI know that this is going to happen, and\n\n308\n00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.220\nI know that I need to make\nsure that this happens.\n\n309\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.230\nYou normally see, of course,\nthe project title,\n\n310\n00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.440\ndate prepared, requesting the change,\nand even if they assign you a number.\n\n311\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.840\nNow, this change number you might go,\nI don't know what change number it is.\n\n312\n00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.050\nWell, in large enough organization,\nyou may also be told by project management\n\n313\n00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.380\noffice, or they may even write this in,\nwhat that change number is going to be for\n\n314\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.425\nyou, so that it actually gets\nassigned to your project and\n\n315\n00:16:35.425 --> 00:16:37.860\ngets assigned the number that it is.\n\n316\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.065\nAnd then you might have to go ahead and\nmark it out.\n\n317\n00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:43.880\nIs this a change with a scope or\nquality or whatever it might be?\n\n318\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.960\nYou fill that out.\n\n319\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.950\nYou give a detailed description\nof what change you propose, and\n\n320\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.350\nwhy that change needs to be done.\n\n321\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.540\nOkay, now notice that,\nalong with this, right?\n\n322\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.990\nYou also wanna make sure that you add in,\nwell,\n\n323\n00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:02.270\na couple of different things of how\nthis changes the entire project.\n\n324\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.030\nIs this going to, actually,\nincrease the scope?\n\n325\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.480\nIn other words, make it larger,\nis it going to reduce the scope, or\n\n326\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.870\nis it just gonna change one of\nthe elements in the scope here?\n\n327\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.810\nYou'd go ahead, and you can also give it\nthe idea here of a grade if you want to,\n\n328\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:21.470\nin other words, is this really something\nthat we need to do right away,\n\n329\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.170\nsomething not so much so,\nso you can add that in.\n\n330\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.300\nOr is it just something\nthat has to change?\n\n331\n00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.049\nDoes it change the requirement, cost,\nschedule, you kind of get the idea,\n\n332\n00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.280\nI'm not gonna stick toward on it.\n\n333\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.670\nAnd then, of course, stakeholder impact,\nwho's gonna be affected by it?\n\n334\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.210\nAnd then, notice here, I have something\nthat talks about a regression plan.\n\n335\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.460\nNow, we're gonna talk about\na regression plan in a little bit, but\n\n336\n00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.570\nwe're not gonna get to that right now.\n\n337\n00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.550\nSo, at this point, you normally\nadd in additional details as well,\n\n338\n00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.620\nto ensure that you understand\na couple of things, okay?\n\n339\n00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.170\nSo, with this change request form,\n\n340\n00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.770\nit means that you have already done\nthe majority of the work, okay?\n\n341\n00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.120\nYou normally need to know, and you need\nto know already what you actually have to\n\n342\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:07.970\nreplace, how long it's gonna take,\nwhat your procedure is, everything.\n\n343\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.190\nWhen should it be done?\n\n344\n00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.520\nWhen should it not be done?\n\n345\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.370\nYou name it.\n\n346\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.874\nYou're gonna have all that stuff when you\nstart writing down the actual details here\n\n347\n00:18:15.874 --> 00:18:19.056\nof the description of everything\nelse that goes on, okay?\n\n348\n00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:22.634\nNow, at that point,\nyou can submit it, okay?\n\n349\n00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:25.890\nIf you go, all right,\nI've got all those details in mind,\n\n350\n00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.148\nI've got that in hand, and\nI might even have this idea, and\n\n351\n00:18:29.148 --> 00:18:32.862\nas I scroll through here,\nokay, that, change regression.\n\n352\n00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.530\nOkay, the regression plan, and\n\n353\n00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.430\nthat's how you back out a change if\nthe change that you make doesn't work.\n\n354\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.470\nThey want to know details about that,\nand we'll talk about that later on.\n\n355\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.180\nAnd then of course, justification.\n\n356\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.980\nWhy does this change need to happen?\n\n357\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.855\nNow, a lot of times, you might go well,\nwhat is this, do I mark this out?\n\n358\n00:18:48.855 --> 00:18:53.060\nNope, normally what ends up happening here\nis at the end, when everybody on what we\n\n359\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.840\ncall our change control board takes\na look at the documentation, and\n\n360\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.900\ntakes a look at everything else,\nthey take the second page here, and\n\n361\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.560\nthey dispose of it, however they choose.\n\n362\n00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.120\nThey approve it, they reject it outright,\nand they may defer, okay?\n\n363\n00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.203\nAs well, and they you why it's\nactually been done, okay?\n\n364\n00:19:11.203 --> 00:19:14.838\nThe way that they chose to, and they sign\nit and date it and what their role is\n\n365\n00:19:14.838 --> 00:19:18.589\na lot of times, verifying that everything\nwas submitted in a proper way, and\n\n366\n00:19:18.589 --> 00:19:22.456\nyou either accept it, or you've actually\nrejected it at that point as well, or\n\n367\n00:19:22.456 --> 00:19:25.295\nyou're actually kind\nof pushing it off too.\n\n368\n00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:29.945\nSo, understanding that this has to\nbe done is a big process here, okay?\n\n369\n00:19:29.945 --> 00:19:33.455\nOnce you're done with that,\nand you submit it, okay?\n\n370\n00:19:33.455 --> 00:19:36.760\nNormally, also, what would happen\nis that somewhere along the line,\n\n371\n00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:42.390\nthe project manager will also mark down\nin their change request log, okay?\n\n372\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.610\nThe change that has been submitted here,\nthey\n\n373\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:50.410\nend a particular description of what had\nto go on, and then everything else too.\n\n374\n00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.580\nSo, if it's been approved or\nit's not, there will be a mark down,\n\n375\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.280\nand then when they review it,\nthey'll actually mark the disposition for\n\n376\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.830\nwhat needs to happen, and\nthen when it was actually closed out.\n\n377\n00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.270\nSo, now we have complete documentation\nthat a formal change, and\n\n378\n00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:09.920\nthis part of the process that we\nhave to do, has now been evaluated,\n\n379\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.540\neither carried forward, or been rejected,\nso that they don't have to as well.\n\n380\n00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.331\nBut normally,\nwhen we do something like this, right?\n\n381\n00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:20.660\nIt's now inside of the system, and\nthere's now a paper trail for that change,\n\n382\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.450\nthat really helps us out in\nwhat we need to do, okay?\n\n383\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:28.880\nAnd that is a very important part\nof the beginning process here,\n\n384\n00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.890\nof identifying that change.\n\n385\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.630\nIdentifying is not just knowing about it,\nbut it's about\n\n386\n00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.940\ngetting it into the official system for\ntracking and control at this point.\n\n387\n00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:43.700\nAnd that is a very important part of what\nwe do before we implement any changes.\n\n388\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.490\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, this looks like,\nin a perfect world, we would be able to\n\n389\n00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.970\ngo ahead and fill out these forms,\nand get everything submitted properly.\n\n390\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.810\nWould there be any circumstances where\nmaybe a stakeholder approached me and\n\n391\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.000\nhad a change on the fly,\nmaybe they wanted to go ahead, and\n\n392\n00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.690\nit was my 101 iteration of a particular\nprototype, or something like that?\n\n393\n00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.340\nIs there ever an instance where\nI would just resubmit to that?\n\n394\n00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:09.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, if it's enough of a change\nwhere hopefully what we've done\n\n395\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.850\nhere in terms of project management,\nis that we're not micro-managing, right?\n\n396\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.030\nSo, that's not what we want to do.\n\n397\n00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:19.380\nWhat we actually want to do is to be\nable to give you some leeway to say yes,\n\n398\n00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.920\nthis change can occur without there\nactually being any real effects.\n\n399\n00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.130\nNow, when you do something\nlike that though, notice,\n\n400\n00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.930\nlet's go back to my screen here just for\na moment, move these things up here.\n\n401\n00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:35.360\nSo, before those changes are made, whether\nyou're actually doing this on your own\n\n402\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.520\nCherokee, or whether we're\nactually doing it as a board,\n\n403\n00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.060\na lot of times here, you also want to make\nsure that you've already performed what\n\n404\n00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.920\nyou call an impact analysis here, okay?\n\n405\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.256\nWhat will this change cost?\n\n406\n00:21:45.256 --> 00:21:49.820\nSo, even if stakeholder goes, ooh,\nwe'd better change that again.\n\n407\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.637\nWell, that's fine, okay?\n\n408\n00:21:51.637 --> 00:21:54.910\nAs long as you understand what\nthe impact is of that change.\n\n409\n00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:59.860\nIf you go, I can change it, but\nI don't know what that's going to do,\n\n410\n00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.960\nthen no, you don't change it, okay?\n\n411\n00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.080\n&gt;&gt; It's okay to go ahead and\ngive them that answer then.\n\n412\n00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say at this point\nit's okay, but if you go look,\n\n413\n00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.160\nI know what that change is going to do,\nand it's nothing that you want to see.\n\n414\n00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.620\nAnd they still insist on it, I would\nsay then go look, before we do this,\n\n415\n00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.490\nlet's make sure that everybody\nknows what's going on and\n\n416\n00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.360\nif they insist on it,\nyou can kind of go okay,\n\n417\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.690\nwe're not gonna do that and\njust let them do it if they need to, okay?\n\n418\n00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.220\nAll right, so,\nthe impact analysis, of course,\n\n419\n00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.770\nthen requires you to make sure that you\nalready have made additional types of\n\n420\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:38.130\ninquiries here, to ensure that everybody\nhas an informed decision, okay?\n\n421\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.650\nDon't ever tell somebody I just need\nthe change done's, can you sign off on it?\n\n422\n00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.660\nThat's not enough, okay?\n\n423\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.790\nYou need to make sure that they\nhave enough information, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.950\nSo that they can make an informed decision\nabout whether to accept the change, or\n\n425\n00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:55.410\nwhether to reject the change,\nor defer it at times.\n\n426\n00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.762\nAlso, remember, that means you're gonna\ngo on a fact finding mission, okay?\n\n427\n00:22:58.762 --> 00:23:02.670\nIs this change going to actually really\nbe effective in what we actually have?\n\n428\n00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.880\nIs it gonna increase our risk?\n\n429\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.160\nWe need to know all of that information,\nand not every time do you have somebody\n\n430\n00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.370\nactually realizing that that's\nwhat's gonna end up happening here.\n\n431\n00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:18.060\nSo, the impact, and what ends up happening\ncan make the change review board or\n\n432\n00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.410\nwhoever it is, committee, members,\nthey're gonna actually go, all right,\n\n433\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.660\nmaybe we shouldn't do that right now.\n\n434\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.578\nYou might end up finding out that you\ncan have changes that are not done right\n\n435\n00:23:28.578 --> 00:23:33.265\naway on what you're doing, because\nthere was a already a change ticket\n\n436\n00:23:33.265 --> 00:23:36.960\nsubmitted to make another\nchange on that very same day.\n\n437\n00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.196\nAnything else that requires very complex\nsystem interacting with each other,\n\n438\n00:23:41.196 --> 00:23:44.985\nyou might find out that instead\nthe entire change control boards says,\n\n439\n00:23:44.985 --> 00:23:47.827\nit's better if we only deal\nwith one change at a time,\n\n440\n00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:51.705\nand not try to make sure we integrate\nevery single change on that one day.\n\n441\n00:23:51.705 --> 00:23:54.187\nAnd then when something breaks,\nyou can try and figure out what it is.\n\n442\n00:23:54.187 --> 00:23:58.890\nSo yeah, it might just be rejected\njust because of a particular date.\n\n443\n00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.100\nAnd they might just tell you,\nyou need to resubmit this change,\n\n444\n00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.500\nbut give us a different date\nthat we can do this on.\n\n445\n00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.635\nAnd then at that point you can say well,\n\n446\n00:24:06.635 --> 00:24:09.109\nwhat is that change\nthat's going on before?\n\n447\n00:24:09.109 --> 00:24:13.118\nAnd you might find out something,\nthat the change that they're making right\n\n448\n00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:16.325\nbefore you want to make the change\nthat you're gonna submit,\n\n449\n00:24:16.325 --> 00:24:19.360\nokay, might actually impact\nwhat you wanted to change.\n\n450\n00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.050\nAnd you might find out you don't even\nneed to make that change anymore.\n\n451\n00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.980\nSo you have to actually\nhave a very careful process\n\n452\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.580\nwhen you're thinking out\nthese types of changes.\n\n453\n00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.820\nAnd that's why these things are so\nwell documented,\n\n454\n00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.567\nbecause they don't want anybody\njust making those changes.\n\n455\n00:24:34.567 --> 00:24:37.340\nAnd they deal with the results\nas they come along.\n\n456\n00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.010\nIt really is gonna have to actually make\nsure that you understand that nature\n\n457\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.770\nof the impact that you're\nactually having here.\n\n458\n00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.870\nSo when you start to take a look at just\nthose particular issues that you tend to\n\n459\n00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:53.330\nsee there, okay, in terms of actually\nmaking that happen, understanding that\n\n460\n00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:57.430\nthe identification is really that\nformal beginning of that process.\n\n461\n00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.570\nMaking sure it's logged,\n\n462\n00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.580\nunderstanding that you have to have\neverything else that comes in.\n\n463\n00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.470\nCuz it could be as you submit that change\nyou're also there to answer questions.\n\n464\n00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.420\nAnd that way they understand\nwhat the impact is going to be.\n\n465\n00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.280\nSo you have to be able to provide\nadditional information as it comes through\n\n466\n00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.330\nto what you also have ahead of you, okay.\n\n467\n00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:21.400\nNow the other things, of course,\nthat you have to be able to do,\n\n468\n00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:27.570\nis to evaluate not only the impact but\nthe justification of that change.\n\n469\n00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.590\nSo remember that the whole goal and\n\n470\n00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:34.540\nidea here, okay, is does this change\nreally need to be made, okay?\n\n471\n00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:39.500\nSo normally when a change happens at any\nparticular point here, there is usually\n\n472\n00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:45.200\nabout four different reasons normally\nthat people submit change requests, okay?\n\n473\n00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.710\nAnd so what you do, of course, then is you\ncoordinate with everybody else who's on\n\n474\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.830\nthe team and the stakeholders, and say all\nright, why does this change need to made?\n\n475\n00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.566\nLet me just justify this, okay?\n\n476\n00:25:54.566 --> 00:25:56.210\nSo what has happened?\n\n477\n00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.320\nSometimes things are going 100% wrong,\nokay?\n\n478\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.530\nSo you need to take a correction and\nan action to correct this, okay.\n\n479\n00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:08.360\nSo this is actually fairly\neasy in anything that you do\n\n480\n00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.410\nas far as lining things up.\n\n481\n00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:15.252\nLet's just take for an example lining\nsomething up on a wall, right, pictures.\n\n482\n00:26:15.252 --> 00:26:15.792\n&gt;&gt; Hanging pictures.\n\n483\n00:26:15.792 --> 00:26:16.407\nThat's exactly what I was thinking, yeah.\n\n484\n00:26:16.407 --> 00:26:17.230\n&gt;&gt; Hanging pictures, yeah, yeah.\n\n485\n00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.320\nThink about something like that, right?\n\n486\n00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.850\nSo as long as you get a level and\nyou're fine that's perfectly great.\n\n487\n00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:28.140\nBut if you're depending on me without a\nlevel to make sure everything's straight,\n\n488\n00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.000\nI might think it looks\nstraight as everything else.\n\n489\n00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.255\nBut then you get Cherokee and\nCherokee's described herself as being OCD.\n\n490\n00:26:34.255 --> 00:26:34.758\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n491\n00:26:34.758 --> 00:26:35.579\n&gt;&gt; She might come in and go.\n\n492\n00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:36.509\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's exactly\nwhat I was thinking.\n\n493\n00:26:36.509 --> 00:26:37.433\n&gt;&gt; Are you joking?\n\n494\n00:26:37.433 --> 00:26:39.130\nAre you really joking?\n\n495\n00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.430\nAnd at some point, right?\n\n496\n00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:45.130\nWhat should happen is whoa, let's go\nahead and put a level on that, right?\n\n497\n00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.760\nThat's exactly what we need to do.\n\n498\n00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.550\nNow normally we don't need\na change request to do that.\n\n499\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:54.090\nBut what we're saying is, if there is\nsomething wrong, we need to correct it.\n\n500\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.460\nAnd that is a great change to make.\n\n501\n00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.220\nThat's the type of change that a change\nreview board says, absolutely, okay?\n\n502\n00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.870\nThis is something we definitely know.\n\n503\n00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.650\nIt's gone south.\n\n504\n00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:05.910\nWe need to correct it.\n\n505\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.760\nSo that's a great justification.\n\n506\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.663\nWe are correcting an issue and\na problem, okay.\n\n507\n00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.638\nThey love to hear that stuff.\n\n508\n00:27:13.638 --> 00:27:18.290\n&gt;&gt; And just a side note,\nwhen you said the whole OCD thing,\n\n509\n00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.156\nsomething that someone had\nmentioned to me before,\n\n510\n00:27:20.156 --> 00:27:23.480\nand I think's a great idea that\nyou keep in the back of your mind.\n\n511\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.800\nAnd when you're talking about your\ntools like any kind of tool to help you\n\n512\n00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.200\nto install these photos or whatever.\n\n513\n00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.631\nAlways calibrate your devices and\nmeasure your measuring device.,\n\n514\n00:27:34.631 --> 00:27:38.846\nThere's a story where she had\npurchased a painting at an art fair.\n\n515\n00:27:38.846 --> 00:27:43.023\nAnd they had just grabbed a quick little\nmeasuring tape from the dollar store.\n\n516\n00:27:43.023 --> 00:27:46.637\nBut the actual dollar store\nmeasuring tape was off.\n\n517\n00:27:46.637 --> 00:27:48.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when they got home,\n\n518\n00:27:48.185 --> 00:27:50.663\nthe painting didn't fit on the wall\nthat they had planned it for.\n\n519\n00:27:50.663 --> 00:27:52.628\nSo measure your measuring tools.\n\n520\n00:27:52.628 --> 00:27:56.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that is going to\nthe OCD part, there's no doubt.\n\n521\n00:27:56.714 --> 00:27:58.860\n&gt;&gt; A little just over the edge there but,\nyeah.\n\n522\n00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's even worse on a painting\nlike what you're talking about,\n\n523\n00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.385\nwhat if the canvas wasn't actually\nexactly straight when they put the frame\n\n524\n00:28:05.385 --> 00:28:05.922\naround it.\n\n525\n00:28:05.922 --> 00:28:07.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That would probably drive you\n\n526\n00:28:07.765 --> 00:28:10.284\na little bit more nuts if you\nhung it exactly level and\n\n527\n00:28:10.284 --> 00:28:13.332\nthe picture inside of the frame\nwould still be a little bit off.\n\n528\n00:28:13.332 --> 00:28:14.512\n&gt;&gt; That's why I have canvas.\n\n529\n00:28:14.512 --> 00:28:16.549\nI have a canvas set that\nneeds to be framed.\n\n530\n00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:18.320\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; And it's just sitting in my closet.\n\n531\n00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.440\nI'm so afraid of that.\n\n532\n00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so the other one,\nthe other type of action,\n\n533\n00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.125\nthe other type of justification,\nis it's preventative, right?\n\n534\n00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:31.550\nSo when we start talking about the idea\nof preventive here, we see a problem\n\n535\n00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:36.070\nthat's going to go down the line at some\npoint if we don't make that correction or\n\n536\n00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.050\nthat change right now, so\nlet's go ahead and do what?\n\n537\n00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.210\nSo that we're not slowing down later on,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n538\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.330\nimplement the change now.\n\n539\n00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.857\nNow you might actually be reviewing as\nthe project manager where you're reviewing\n\n540\n00:28:46.857 --> 00:28:48.881\nthe next actions that\nare coming down the line.\n\n541\n00:28:48.881 --> 00:28:52.230\nAnd you go ooh, I do see that happening.\n\n542\n00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.250\nSo yes, right now let me go ahead and\nsubmit a change at this point,\n\n543\n00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.080\nto say in the future that this\nis going to end up happening.\n\n544\n00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.580\nThat's why we're submitting it now.\n\n545\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.350\n&gt;&gt; That's why you get paid the big bucks,\nRonnie.\n\n546\n00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:04.149\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully that's why you\ndo get paid the big bucks.\n\n547\n00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n548\n00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the other one, of course,\nis more general at times here,\n\n549\n00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:13.257\nthe reparative type of option that we have\nthe justification is always something\n\n550\n00:29:13.257 --> 00:29:17.160\nthat will, I'm going to say this,\nalways something that will be approved.\n\n551\n00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:17.730\nNow, why?\n\n552\n00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.052\nBecause if it's not repaired,\nit's broke and\n\n553\n00:29:20.052 --> 00:29:22.610\nwhy do you need that on your project,\nokay?\n\n554\n00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:23.860\nNow don't get me wrong.\n\n555\n00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.900\nYou of course have many levels of repair.\n\n556\n00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.295\nThere's probably the Cherokee Boose\nlevel which, you know,\n\n557\n00:29:29.295 --> 00:29:30.750\nrepairs everything around it.\n\n558\n00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.276\nThen there's Ronnie Wong with\nthe electrical tape and the bailing wire.\n\n559\n00:29:34.276 --> 00:29:35.190\n&gt;&gt; At least it's not duct tape.\n\n560\n00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.928\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and actually, duct tape.\n\n561\n00:29:36.928 --> 00:29:38.859\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That will work as well, but\n\n562\n00:29:38.859 --> 00:29:42.876\nnormally the idea, right, is that\nsomething is breaking or about to break\n\n563\n00:29:42.876 --> 00:29:47.460\nand you want to repair it so you have the\nlong life and use of it on the project.\n\n564\n00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.970\nSo you normally have a great\njustification in terms of repair.\n\n565\n00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.920\nThe preventative, you might see people go,\nwe're not even close to\n\n566\n00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.110\ndealing with that Ronnie, let's just\ndefer that until we come closer to time.\n\n567\n00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.353\nAnd you just have to\naccept that sometimes, but\n\n568\n00:30:00.353 --> 00:30:03.676\nyou wanna make sure that it stays\nin the forefront of people's minds.\n\n569\n00:30:03.676 --> 00:30:06.840\nThe other one is the one that you\nreally don't ever want to encounter.\n\n570\n00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.630\n&gt;&gt; Try to avoid this one.\n\n571\n00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.190\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n572\n00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:12.160\nThe idea of an emergent condition,\nokay, is really bad.\n\n573\n00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.100\nThat means it's an emergency but\nsometimes you do have those and\n\n574\n00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.280\nnormally these things do go through.\n\n575\n00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.175\nThey normally don't say,\nthis is an emergency.\n\n576\n00:30:22.175 --> 00:30:23.335\nLet's not worry about it.\n\n577\n00:30:23.335 --> 00:30:25.975\n&gt;&gt; And they usually have a pretty\nhigh impact on the overall project\n\n578\n00:30:25.975 --> 00:30:30.455\nbecause of all the exorbitant fees and\nadditional salaries\n\n579\n00:30:30.455 --> 00:30:34.021\nthat you may be paying someone to come\nin on overtime, maybe in a holiday.\n\n580\n00:30:34.021 --> 00:30:36.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nonce you actually have that emergency,\n\n581\n00:30:36.525 --> 00:30:39.955\nit's kinda like everybody\nturn every valve on full.\n\n582\n00:30:39.955 --> 00:30:44.225\nWe're about to head into the overload\nside of everything that we have\n\n583\n00:30:44.225 --> 00:30:45.780\navailable to us.\n\n584\n00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.150\nSo these are also those types\nof justifications, okay.\n\n585\n00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:55.370\nNow what you have to do, right, if you're\nlooking at this for your first time, okay.\n\n586\n00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.880\nMake sure you always understand\nthat within projects\n\n587\n00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.740\nyou're gonna see things like this\nalways have to take place, okay.\n\n588\n00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:06.590\nThere is no such thing as a perfect\n100% perfect project plan, okay.\n\n589\n00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.782\nEven on the smallest\nprojects where you finally.\n\n590\n00:31:08.782 --> 00:31:09.897\n&gt;&gt; Then we'd be unemployed.\n\n591\n00:31:09.897 --> 00:31:11.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then you would be unemployed,\n\n592\n00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.710\nthere's no doubt.\n\n593\n00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.333\nOnce you actually have\neven the smallest project,\n\n594\n00:31:15.333 --> 00:31:18.866\nyou start seeing things like I\nshould have done it this way.\n\n595\n00:31:18.866 --> 00:31:20.490\nYeah, I didn't think.\n\n596\n00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.050\nI needed to fit this so\nlet me retool to do that.\n\n597\n00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.760\nAnd with the project being fairly small,\n\n598\n00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.570\nthese changes don't normally\nhave to go to a review board.\n\n599\n00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.810\nBut if you're actually doing something\nlike this for, let's say Shark Tank,\n\n600\n00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:36.510\nlike something that you're talking about,\nor whatever the review thing is, okay.\n\n601\n00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:41.330\nYou wanna make sure that these changes\nare documented along the way, so\n\n602\n00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:45.905\nthat you kind of understand what\nprocess led you to that end result.\n\n603\n00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:49.888\nAnd all the actual failures that you've\nhad along the way or changes that you've\n\n604\n00:31:49.888 --> 00:31:53.850\nhad along the way to fix things,\nokay, because it really does give you\n\n605\n00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:58.878\na good grand scope of understanding that\nhere's why you implement the change.\n\n606\n00:31:58.878 --> 00:32:03.010\nIt's weird cuz I know that I've had\nthis happen before and I've seen it\n\n607\n00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:07.690\nIn configurations on Cisco routers and,\nheck, even with pfSense firewall.\n\n608\n00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.740\nI made a change to something and\nI'm like, I know I changed it.\n\n609\n00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.790\nI don't know why I changed it, okay?\n\n610\n00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.370\nAnd at some point I should've had, what?\n\n611\n00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.720\nSomething I wrote down,\nlike I changed this for this reason, okay?\n\n612\n00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.260\nThat would actually help,\nbecause now I look and I'm like,\n\n613\n00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.720\nwhy did I make that change?\n\n614\n00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.742\nAnd it's easy enough, I put it back to\nwhat I think it is, and things break.\n\n615\n00:32:25.742 --> 00:32:27.886\nThen I'm like, now I remember!\n\n616\n00:32:27.886 --> 00:32:29.612\nThat's not a situation-\n&gt;&gt; And even your co-workers.\n\n617\n00:32:29.612 --> 00:32:31.932\nThey could have like a ticketing\nsystem that would be perfect,\n\n618\n00:32:31.932 --> 00:32:34.180\nbecause they wouldn't even have\nto ask you if you were busy.\n\n619\n00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.762\nI could just look in that documentation.\n\n620\n00:32:35.762 --> 00:32:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's definitely not\nsomething you ever want a surprise\n\n621\n00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.560\nanybody and yourself with it as well.\n\n622\n00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.330\nCuz I have seen exactly that with\nmy own work, where I've said,\n\n623\n00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:45.710\nI didn't need to make that change.\n\n624\n00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.860\nI changed it and everything failed, okay?\n\n625\n00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.710\nSo much that everybody complains,\nthat's how I know that it fails.\n\n626\n00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:54.550\nSo you change it back and you go,\nokay, that's why we changed it.\n\n627\n00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.652\nAnd now we actually do make\ndocumentation like that to make sure,\n\n628\n00:32:57.652 --> 00:33:00.360\nor you at least let somebody else know.\n\n629\n00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.478\nOur particular documentation system at\nITProTV, cuz it's relatively small and\n\n630\n00:33:04.478 --> 00:33:06.230\nsimple, emails, okay.\n\n631\n00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.620\nAnd go, all right, here it is.\n\n632\n00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.864\nI normally email Nate and\nI normally email Donna.\n\n633\n00:33:09.864 --> 00:33:13.920\nAnd go, here's a firewall change\nthat I made due to this process.\n\n634\n00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.820\nAnd so that way, those of us\nthat are actually right there on\n\n635\n00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.120\nthat network infrastructure team trying\nto get everything up and running.\n\n636\n00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.270\nWe all have a sense of what\nchanges have been made,\n\n637\n00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.273\nwhether it's to our wireless network,\nwhether it's to anything out there.\n\n638\n00:33:26.273 --> 00:33:29.930\nBut essentially it was Nate and I that\nreally did help set up the base here, so\n\n639\n00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.910\nwe keep each other kind of up to date on\nthings that we do against the network.\n\n640\n00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.765\nAnd that's our documentation for\nthose things, too, okay.\n\n641\n00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:39.000\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I think that about\nwraps it up for this episode.\n\n642\n00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.040\nWe do have some more change request\nprocesses coming your way, so\n\n643\n00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.600\nstay tuned for that.\n\n644\n00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.280\nThank you for tuning in today,\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n645\n00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n646\n00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:48.910\n&gt;&gt; Signing off.\n\n647\n00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.646\nHave a great one.\n\n648\n00:33:50.646 --> 00:33:57.036\n[MUSIC]\n\n649\n00:33:57.036 --> 00:33:59.987\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.610\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.610\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.360\nThis episode is a continuation\nof our changed process.\n\n6\n00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.010\nSo we're really gonna be looking\nin this episode specifically,\n\n7\n00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.590\nat our regression planning.\n\n8\n00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.590\nWith us today, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.990\nThank you for coming in today.\n\n10\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.900\n&gt;&gt; I want to thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.220\nhaving me here as we continue on\nwith some CompTia Project Plus.\n\n12\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.214\nTaking a look at the idea of the change\nprocess itself and some of the tools that\n\n13\n00:00:38.214 --> 00:00:41.418\nwe need to understand as we start\nworking through our change.\n\n14\n00:00:41.418 --> 00:00:43.257\nSo remember that in our previous episode,\n\n15\n00:00:43.257 --> 00:00:46.799\nif you haven't actually watched that make\nsure you go back and take a look at that.\n\n16\n00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.403\nThe whole idea is not just to\nunderstand that change happens and\n\n17\n00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:52.514\nwe know what change needs to be done.\n\n18\n00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:56.372\nBut for a project is to ensure that\nwe can control that change, and\n\n19\n00:00:56.372 --> 00:01:00.540\nnormally that means we submit\nthe change to some type of review.\n\n20\n00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.850\nAnd the way that we do\nthat is by using form, and\n\n21\n00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.720\nthere's officially what we call\na change control board that we have.\n\n22\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.310\nNow I didn't spend a lot of time talking\nabout the other parts of the process.\n\n23\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.340\nSo let's kind of mention a few more terms,\nand\n\n24\n00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.560\nthen we'll get into that regression plan.\n\n25\n00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.020\nCuz that was actually on me,\nI shouldn't have actually done that, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.954\nSo let's make sure we understand\nthe elements in terms of that change\n\n27\n00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.050\nreview, right.\n\n28\n00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.415\nSo there's you who actually knows\nthe change needs to be done,\n\n29\n00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:27.971\nyou need to be able to submit that\nchange to some type of review board\n\n30\n00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:32.520\nthat will actually decide for us whether\nor not that change will be accepted.\n\n31\n00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.690\nWhether it's going to be rejected,\n\n32\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.790\nwhether it's going to be differed\nin some particular point in time.\n\n33\n00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.225\nAnd that review board is normally\nmade of people that have that\n\n34\n00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:44.308\nvested interest into our project itself.\n\n35\n00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:48.596\nNow when we say that right usually what\nends up happening is that its probably\n\n36\n00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:52.690\nthe project coordinator or scheduler or\nsome sort of technical expert.\n\n37\n00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.664\nThat's on there and\n\n38\n00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:58.080\neven the project manager it depends on\nwhat the actual change is going to be.\n\n39\n00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.000\nSo what you might have in\na regular business is simple.\n\n40\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.230\nYou might have all the department heads,\n\n41\n00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.480\nactually be part of that\nchange review board instead.\n\n42\n00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.350\nThat way when they see the change,\nthey can know whether or\n\n43\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.390\nnot it affects them or not.\n\n44\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.410\nAnd then they can make a recommendation if\nthat's something that they need to take\n\n45\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.500\na look at.\n\n46\n00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.010\nSo here inside of the project,\nyou might actually have sorts of the same\n\n47\n00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.520\nidea where Sashi whose going to\nbe a successor on that team.\n\n48\n00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.320\nNow on the succeeding task,\n\n49\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.870\nhow is going to affect the actual\nproject that scope itself.\n\n50\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.790\nIt might have all of these different\npeople here is trying to figure\n\n51\n00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.820\nout what's going on.\n\n52\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.280\nAnd then make decision on\nwhether to accept it or not.\n\n53\n00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.830\nOnce all that is done and now you've got\nthe approval that the change can go on\n\n54\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.130\nthat's when we move onto the idea of\ntalking about the regression plan.\n\n55\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.530\nNow I mentioned it briefly by showing\nyou a form that we can submit for\n\n56\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.310\nthe change request itself.\n\n57\n00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.820\nAnd so, that means you have two options\n\n58\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.380\nthat can happen in\nthe change review here okay.\n\n59\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.805\nSo you could have it where it's\nexactly like it says in the form.\n\n60\n00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:09.408\nThat you're supposed to have not only what\nthe change is and the details of that\n\n61\n00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:14.236\nchange, but that if you already have a\ncopy of the regression plan itself, okay.\n\n62\n00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:16.646\nThen you can go ahead and\nattach that as well, so\n\n63\n00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:20.410\nthat they have those steps there ready and\navailable to go.\n\n64\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.410\nSometimes, you might find out a special\nsituation in which we took a look at\n\n65\n00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.850\nas far the reason why we change\nthe justification to it.\n\n66\n00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.460\nWhether is a collective plan or\npreventive, but\n\n67\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.430\nusually when is the idea of\nthe a major type of the situation and\n\n68\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.840\njustification, we don't have\nthe actual regression plan in.\n\n69\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.030\nWe just know something needs to be done,\nso we go ahead and we accept that fact.\n\n70\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.350\nAnd then when that is submitted to\nthe change review board very quickly,\n\n71\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.900\nthen they say, that's great.\n\n72\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.640\nWe're ready to go, but now you need to\nmake sure that you have what we call,\n\n73\n00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.490\nthat regression plan in place, okay.\n\n74\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.520\nSo remember that, there's two options,\neither it's already done and\n\n75\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.780\nyou submit it, and everybody reviews that.\n\n76\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.070\nAnd the reason why they need to have\nthat is because something can happen in\n\n77\n00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.830\nmany different ways.\n\n78\n00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.514\nSo, let's kind of give you an example\nof what can happen here, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:17.786\nSo let's take for an example that you're\npart of a disaster recovery team, and\n\n80\n00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:20.617\nyou're practicing for\nthe eventual reality that.\n\n81\n00:04:20.617 --> 00:04:23.478\nThat this is what's going to happen,\nthat some type of disaster for\n\n82\n00:04:23.478 --> 00:04:24.870\nyour building, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.009\nSo in that sense, when you have everything\nset up the way that you need to and\n\n84\n00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.834\nnow all of the sudden you\nrealized something here,\n\n85\n00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:36.191\nthat something is not completely right,\nand it actually needs to be changed.\n\n86\n00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:40.569\nWell, you can go ahead in an emergency\nsituation, submit that change and\n\n87\n00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.413\nthen they can say, all right.\n\n88\n00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:46.500\nNow when you implement this\nwhat is your back up plan?\n\n89\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.340\nIn other words, and it doesn't work,\n\n90\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.500\nit doesn't stem that the tied of\nthe wall leaking or whatever it is.\n\n91\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.590\nWhat is your plan to back out of that and\nthen apply another fix or\n\n92\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.210\nwhat do you have in mind?\n\n93\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.970\nWell that regression\nplan is all about that.\n\n94\n00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.994\nWhat are your steps to make sure\nthat if your change doesn't work,\n\n95\n00:05:03.994 --> 00:05:06.424\nthat you can actually put it\nback to same situation and\n\n96\n00:05:06.424 --> 00:05:09.786\nthen another change can be [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie you probably also want to go\n\n97\n00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:13.534\nahead and give yourself enough time to go\nahead and implement that regression plan,\n\n98\n00:05:13.534 --> 00:05:15.040\nso maybe with like IT.\n\n99\n00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.310\nI normally would want to go ahead and\n\n100\n00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.580\nimplement a huge change during off hours,\nI have that time to roll back.\n\n101\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you definitely want to make\nsure that the timing is scheduled and\n\n102\n00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.200\neverything else, but overall though\nthat you have that plan in place.\n\n103\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.050\nAnd even though you're the one that\nsubmits the entire regression plan for\n\n104\n00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.080\nthe back out.\n\n105\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.040\nWell, let's say something else happens\nhere that you realize that here it is.\n\n106\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.220\nI've implemented a change, and Cherokee,\nnow I'm ready to go on my vacation.\n\n107\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.050\nAnd I take off on my vacation, let's\nsay it's actually a flight to Hawaii,\n\n108\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.380\nwhich would be lovely, but\nI don't think I'll ever go that way.\n\n109\n00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.280\nBut let's say that I am now on a flight\nto Hawaii from Florida to Hawaii,\n\n110\n00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.242\nit's a pretty good amount of time.\n\n111\n00:05:53.242 --> 00:05:57.844\nAnd now, the changes that I've\nmade have cause some kind of,\n\n112\n00:05:57.844 --> 00:06:00.065\na cascading effects, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:00.065 --> 00:06:02.885\nAnd now they came to Cherokee and\ngo what change did Ronnie make, and\n\n114\n00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:06.322\nCherokee might be able to say, here's\nthe changes that he made, all right.\n\n115\n00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:09.539\nThey are not working,\nhow do you back out of them and now,\n\n116\n00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.440\nif I did not leave a regression plan,\nanother is the ability to back that out.\n\n117\n00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.600\nCherokee, essentially, now has to figure\nout what I did, and maybe even, is there\n\n118\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.380\na particular order in the way that I did\nthings that caused something to go wrong?\n\n119\n00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.470\nOr, is here something else\nthat's happening, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.636\nSo, in other words, she now has to,\nessentially, innovate on her own, and\n\n121\n00:06:32.636 --> 00:06:37.978\ncome up, extemporaneously, with that idea\nof what to do next to back that out.\n\n122\n00:06:37.978 --> 00:06:38.819\n&gt;&gt; Da da da da.\n\n123\n00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:39.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n124\n00:06:39.785 --> 00:06:42.078\n&gt;&gt; And hopefully everything works great,\n\n125\n00:06:42.078 --> 00:06:46.462\nbut if it doesn't, now Cherokee might\nbe instead of backing out of a change,\n\n126\n00:06:46.462 --> 00:06:49.890\nCherokee's just implementing more changes,\nokay?\n\n127\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.880\nAnd then she's like, that didn't work,\nso she goes, let me try this.\n\n128\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.116\nAnd now she starts implementing more\nchanges, and now all the sudden he tries.\n\n129\n00:06:58.116 --> 00:07:01.059\n&gt;&gt; It's so many variables that you\ncan't even pin point what's going on.\n\n130\n00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:05.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that is a realistic problem,\nit snow balls in the effect.\n\n131\n00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.923\nSo having a regression plan in place,\n\n132\n00:07:07.923 --> 00:07:12.390\ngives us that ability instead\nthen to change review board.\n\n133\n00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.966\nNow it goes back and goes,\nthat change seems to work temporarily but\n\n134\n00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:18.240\nit's not a long term solution.\n\n135\n00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.900\nCherokee here is the regression plan,\nimplement it and\n\n136\n00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.820\nusually it's a step by step\nprocess on what I did.\n\n137\n00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:31.320\nAnd what I would do to reverse the changes\nthat need done if anything happens.\n\n138\n00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.600\nSo it doesn't depend on me\nnecessarily needing to come back in,\n\n139\n00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.745\ncuz I guarantee you once\nI'm on the beach on Hawaii.\n\n140\n00:07:37.745 --> 00:07:39.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good luck on getting me to come\n\n141\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.690\nback for some type of change,\n\n142\n00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.480\nI'm not even gonna come connect-\n&gt;&gt; No service.\n\n143\n00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.575\n&gt;&gt; No service, that's right.\n\n144\n00:07:44.575 --> 00:07:45.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Ronnie Wong,\n\n145\n00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.860\nout of service, no doubt.\n\n146\n00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.350\nSo that's why these regression\nplans are very important and\n\n147\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.630\nvery detailed in what they do, okay.\n\n148\n00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.030\nSo usually when you have\nsomething like this.\n\n149\n00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.010\nEven in an emergency situation immediately\n\n150\n00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.130\nafter whatever band-aid you can\nput on a situation a lot of times.\n\n151\n00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.060\nYou do also wanna make sure that you\nhave a regression plan on hand and\n\n152\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.440\nthat that's being worked on right away.\n\n153\n00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.750\nJust in case you realize it is a band-aid,\nit's not a complete cure for\n\n154\n00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.630\nwhatever the ailment is that you\nhave on your project as well.\n\n155\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.120\nIs a very kind of an easy analogy for\n\n156\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.490\nus to make but it takes time till\nshe come up with those plans.\n\n157\n00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.255\nBecause it means that you are gonna\nremember, especially in an emergent\n\n158\n00:08:29.255 --> 00:08:32.789\nsituation, everything that you did and\nthen you try to fix things.\n\n159\n00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:37.760\nAnd then you're also gonna try and say\nif somebody needs to back out of this as\n\n160\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.520\nI am gone or whatever might be\nhere's the steps that they need.\n\n161\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.470\nAnd that's why these reviews\nrushly going to, to help you out.\n\n162\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:51.000\nYou might even find out for a change\nreview board to accept everything when I\n\n163\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.060\nmight look at our thing though you don't\nhave a regression plan and they might say.\n\n164\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.870\nWe're deferring this possible\nchange until Ronnie does what?\n\n165\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.270\nComes up with a regression plan and\nsubmits it for that.\n\n166\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.350\nAnd then Washi could put it on\nthe schedule for review again.\n\n167\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.570\nBut if we choose not to, well there's\nnothing that we can do except for wait.\n\n168\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.850\nAnd normally in an emergency\nsituation we can't wait and\n\n169\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.980\nthat's only when we don't have\nthat regression plan in order.\n\n170\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.249\nBut if it is something that is prescribed\nin terms of a corrective action, or\n\n171\n00:09:21.249 --> 00:09:22.784\na preventative action, or\n\n172\n00:09:22.784 --> 00:09:25.937\neven a reparative action that\nwe normally need to take.\n\n173\n00:09:25.937 --> 00:09:31.185\nThen we should have it on hand before,\nbut not normally, it's not something\n\n174\n00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:35.804\nwe normally like to turn in after or\nduring an emergency situation.\n\n175\n00:09:35.804 --> 00:09:38.850\nCuz you're probably not even\nthinking about the process here.\n\n176\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.399\nBut it is something you have to\nthink about after you implement\n\n177\n00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:46.576\nwhatever your initial plan is to get\nyou out of that emergent situation.\n\n178\n00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:51.481\nSo regression plans very important\npart of the change management\n\n179\n00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:53.362\nprocess itself, okay.\n\n180\n00:09:53.362 --> 00:09:58.342\nNow, once you have everything in place,\nthis is when it becomes a little bit more\n\n181\n00:09:58.342 --> 00:10:01.797\ndifficult in the management\nof this situation, okay.\n\n182\n00:10:01.797 --> 00:10:03.801\nWhen you implement those changes,\n\n183\n00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:08.150\nyou do want to treat it almost like\na check list, if you possibly can.\n\n184\n00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.360\nThis is not something you want to treat\nlike I think I'll do this part of it,\n\n185\n00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.260\nI think I won't do this part of it.\n\n186\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.970\nMake sure you implement everything that\nyou say that you are going to implement.\n\n187\n00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.450\nBecause remember,\nif you've turned in a regression plan and\n\n188\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.910\nyou haven't done that, Cherokee comes out\nat that point and says it's unchecked and\n\n189\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.520\nhe said he checked this check box, okay.\n\n190\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.470\nSo should I, Should I check it or\nshould I not check it,\n\n191\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.980\nI'm I just a, I'm not even gonna\nworry about that during that change.\n\n192\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.270\nCherokee what would you think, do you\nthink I check it or didn't check it.\n\n193\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie you're pretty efficient, so\nI might put some trust in you, but I,\n\n194\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.700\nthen again if that falls under\nmy shoulders, I don't know.\n\n195\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.660\nIt's a tough decision.\n\n196\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the problem, right.\n\n197\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.900\nThat's why this idea of\nimplementing a change.\n\n198\n00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.350\nIf you submit it as that change,\n\n199\n00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.070\nyou should go every single\nstep by that change.\n\n200\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.690\nEven if you go,\nI shouldn't of submitted that part, okay.\n\n201\n00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.020\nWell, what do you do.\n\n202\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.950\nYou sit there and you back out of all\nthose other changes that you made and\n\n203\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.710\nthen you submit that change review again.\n\n204\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.300\nOkay, now that sounds a little bit\nlegalistic, sounds very formalistic.\n\n205\n00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.011\nBut remember that now, if you don't and\n\n206\n00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:21.333\nyou just make that ad hoc change and\nlater on it effects someone.\n\n207\n00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:24.433\nOr like this situation that I mentioned,\nyou make that ad hoc change but\n\n208\n00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.302\nyou don't have it in the regression plan.\n\n209\n00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:30.217\nAnd it has to be regressed by somebody\nelse besides you to back out of it\n\n210\n00:11:30.217 --> 00:11:33.742\nCherokee doesn't have a clue whether or\nnot you did it or not.\n\n211\n00:11:33.742 --> 00:11:37.174\nJust because I chose not to do it or\nI did choose to do it or\n\n212\n00:11:37.174 --> 00:11:41.010\nI said I'll add in this extra\nlittle thing over here.\n\n213\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.540\nNow Cherokee's like was that in\nthere already when Ronnie made\n\n214\n00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.120\nthe change or not.\n\n215\n00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.040\n&gt;&gt; Bottom line get it in black and white,\nso it removes all of the confusion.\n\n216\n00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.320\n&gt;&gt; That is absolutely the key here\nis making sure that every part of it\n\n217\n00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.600\nis going to be filled in, and\nyou have to carry that out that way.\n\n218\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.750\nIt is not your time to now freestyle\nafter you got the okay to change\n\n219\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.860\nas much as you think it\nactually means that, okay.\n\n220\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:11.740\nSo, in this particular part of projects,\nespecially, okay, you're gonna\n\n221\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:17.930\nsee that this effects not only a single\ntask that is ahead of you a lot of times.\n\n222\n00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.579\nBut you may see, and this is what's\nhappened in the industry over the last 20\n\n223\n00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:26.962\nyears, is that change management has\nbecome a field unto itself, okay.\n\n224\n00:12:26.962 --> 00:12:31.376\nSo much so, that people\nare actually taking the entirety of\n\n225\n00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.947\na change management as a process.\n\n226\n00:12:33.947 --> 00:12:38.349\nAnd actually applying them to entire\norganizational types of changes and\n\n227\n00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:42.254\nmanaging the entire organization\nthrough this type of review and\n\n228\n00:12:42.254 --> 00:12:44.330\nthrough this type of aboard.\n\n229\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.760\nAnd we actually have an episode where\nwe'll talk about the idea of managing\n\n230\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.720\norganizational change\njust briefly as well.\n\n231\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.398\nBut for this point here, remember,\nchange process is always a process,\n\n232\n00:12:55.398 --> 00:12:58.500\nis not about just going\nI'm gonna implement it.\n\n233\n00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.345\nAnd then all the tools that we looked at,\n\n234\n00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:02.580\nmake sure you actually\ntake account of that too.\n\n235\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.860\nAnd then understanding how important\na regression plan is a part of that too.\n\n236\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.560\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Ronnie I think that\nabout covers it for our change processes.\n\n237\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.880\nStay tuned we have more great project\nplus coming your way I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n238\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.170\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n239\n00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.616\n&gt;&gt; Signing off.\nHave a great one.\n\n240\n00:13:18.616 --> 00:13:24.744\n[MUSIC]\n\n241\n00:13:24.744 --> 00:13:29.004\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:12.127\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:14.762\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:17.810\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.410\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at CompTIA's Project+.\n\n7\n00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.170\nSpecifically, we'll identify different\ntypes of organizational changes.\n\n8\n00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.730\nWith us today we have Mr. Ronnie Wong,\nthank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.210\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me here as we\ncontinue on taking a look at the realm of\n\n10\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.230\norganizational changes for the idea of\nproject managers and project management.\n\n11\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.290\nNow, we're not going to get of course into\n\n12\n00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.260\nvery detailed aspects of organizational\nchange, but we do need to understand where\n\n13\n00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.230\nthe project manager has a role\nin organizational changes too.\n\n14\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.180\nAnd to also describe the different\ntypes of changes you're more than\n\n15\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.780\nlikely to encounter and see more often\nin the business place, especially in\n\n16\n00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.040\na corporate world, you're gonna see\nthese things happening more and more so.\n\n17\n00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.009\nSo much so that today, instead of\nactually just saying it will happen\n\n18\n00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.080\nas it has happens, it actually has moved\ninto the realm of project management for\n\n19\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.770\neven changes to take place.\n\n20\n00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.170\nAnd that way they manage the entire\nprocess of changing an organization\n\n21\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.530\nas a project instead.\n\n22\n00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.440\nSo, there's a lot of information there.\n\n23\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.474\nA lot of it also, of course, then means\nthat you need to understand more and\n\n24\n00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:29.667\nmore about project change management.\n\n25\n00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.103\nAnd that's what you're seeing,\n\n26\n00:01:31.103 --> 00:01:33.681\nas that there's whole field\nthat's actually developing and\n\n27\n00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.820\nyou need to at least know a part of\nit as what we want to take a look at.\n\n28\n00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.860\nSo we're gonna talk about\nsome of the different types\n\n29\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.590\nof organizational change that\nyou're likely to encounter.\n\n30\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.620\nAnd that way you'll be a little\nbit more familiar with it.\n\n31\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.980\nA lot of the terms that\nwe'll take a look at,\n\n32\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.140\nyou're probably going, I understand that.\n\n33\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.490\nBut maybe not from the idea of\nmanaging project management.\n\n34\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.440\nSo that's what we wanna\ntake a look at first.\n\n35\n00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.780\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, it looks like the first\non our list here is acquisitions.\n\n36\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.170\nAnd so I see you have a business merger or\nacquisition but\n\n37\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.600\nalso some of these terms would also\nbe part of a divestiture as well.\n\n38\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.520\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n39\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're actually gonna\nsee that this idea here, okay.\n\n40\n00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.070\nSo whenever we start talking about\nchange as an organization wide change,\n\n41\n00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.910\nusually they happen in very\nspecific types of categories here.\n\n42\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.240\nFor example, you might hear an\norganization mention a strategic change.\n\n43\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.300\nSo you might hear that term.\n\n44\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.847\nYou might also hear about he idea\nof a personnel type of change.\n\n45\n00:02:31.847 --> 00:02:34.083\nOr a transformational type of change, and\n\n46\n00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:38.258\nevery organization seems to actually\ntalk about them little bit differently.\n\n47\n00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:42.060\nSo let's review just some basic\nconcept right away, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.240\nA strategic type of change,\nmeans that we are really trying\n\n49\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.744\nto prepare our company for\nwhat is coming ahead of the company.\n\n50\n00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:56.677\nSo you may find out that whatever\ncompany you've been working for,\n\n51\n00:02:56.677 --> 00:03:00.128\nthey actually have been fairly\nsuccessful in the past, and\n\n52\n00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:04.890\nwhat they're now starting to find out is\nthat that particular model that they've\n\n53\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.857\ndone in the past,\neven though it is still working,\n\n54\n00:03:07.857 --> 00:03:12.520\nis not working effectively to help bring\nmore business into the organization.\n\n55\n00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.420\nAnd so what they're saying is that they\nneed a strategic approach, which means\n\n56\n00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.610\nthat they need to make decisions right\nnow that's going to position them\n\n57\n00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.770\nthe way that they want to be in whatever\nmarket that they are in, in the future.\n\n58\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.210\n&gt;&gt; We see that a lot with those\ngazelles that are starting out.\n\n59\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.060\nAnd these companies are just growing so\nrapidly and they really don't have\n\n60\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.130\neither the know how, or\nthe manpower to keep that momentum going.\n\n61\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.880\nSometimes you'll see\nan acquisition transpire that way.\n\n62\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.930\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that this is one of\nthe most effective types of strategic\n\n63\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.440\nchanges that we can make.\n\n64\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.810\nIs in terms of what we call a business\nmerger, or a business acquisition.\n\n65\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.940\nNow everybody, of course,\n\n66\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.090\nalways likes to look at it\na little bit differently, right?\n\n67\n00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.390\nA big company ends up\nbuying a smaller company.\n\n68\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.010\nYou might hear that term\nas being an acquisition.\n\n69\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.680\nThis company ends up buying small one.\n\n70\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.199\nBut today of course,\nnobody likes the idea that companies-\n\n71\n00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.076\n&gt;&gt; Have been acquired.\n\n72\n00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:06.193\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, have been acquired.\n\n73\n00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:10.192\nSo usually that the better term or\nthe more politically correct term is\n\n74\n00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:14.550\nbusiness merger, even if the two\ncompanies are really disparate insides.\n\n75\n00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.708\nIn other words-\n&gt;&gt; They're not.\n\n76\n00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:16.798\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] To pay, yeah.\n\n77\n00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.503\nThey're not really equal, but\nwe to like to treat them as being equal.\n\n78\n00:04:19.503 --> 00:04:23.347\nTo say of course they're equals,\nwe're gonna be working with them,\n\n79\n00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:24.919\nwe're not buying them out.\n\n80\n00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.820\nBut it usually you really are, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.070\nSo when you start taking a look at that at\nfrom the project management stand point,\n\n82\n00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.870\nokay, well at this point we've really\ntalked about the idea of planning,\n\n83\n00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.460\nwe've talked about the idea of.\n\n84\n00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.310\nSo if you take the idea of project\nmanagement, right, that entire process,\n\n85\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.160\nright, initiation, planning,\nexecution, and controlling, and\n\n86\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.770\nthen of course closing and\neven testing in the CompTIA realm.\n\n87\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.680\nWhen you take all that in place,\nright, those concepts can\n\n88\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.930\nreally be brought into this idea of\nthe business type of merger, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.300\nNow the problem that you have is simple,\nis that once you have people established\n\n90\n00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.970\nin what they're really good at doing,\ngetting them\n\n91\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.550\nto actually be able to have what we call a\nbuy-in into the change is very difficult.\n\n92\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.060\nAnd it doesn't always happen from\nthis point here at the top down.\n\n93\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.110\nSo a lot of time what you end\nup finding out in a merger\n\n94\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.580\nis that one of the most important\nelements is not just getting started.\n\n95\n00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.660\nIt's actually making sure that you manage\nthe idea of the cultural integration and\n\n96\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.330\nalso whatever the changes\nthat need to be done,\n\n97\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.660\nthat they're related in terms of the way\nthat the people will work in the future.\n\n98\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.060\nAnd because most people don't\nlike to know that if they merge,\n\n99\n00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.740\nthat now they're actually in another\nposition than what they were doing before,\n\n100\n00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.570\nwhich they felt very happy about.\n\n101\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.520\nAnd now you've essentially\nswitched their direction, and\n\n102\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.630\nthey're like,\nI don't know why I got moved over here.\n\n103\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.036\n&gt;&gt; And you bring up a good\npoint there from the top down.\n\n104\n00:05:51.036 --> 00:05:54.046\nBecause during that negotiation process,\nmaybe it's addressed then.\n\n105\n00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:58.288\nSay look, we're gonna go ahead and keep\ncertain personnel in these departments and\n\n106\n00:05:58.288 --> 00:06:00.870\nnot, or whatever they agree upon, right?\n\n107\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.110\nBut, if they didn't already have a good\nhandle and a good idea of what was\n\n108\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.760\ngoing on throughout the tiers of their\norganization, it's really gonna be hard\n\n109\n00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.650\nto go ahead and force that if they didn't\nhave a good idea in the first place.\n\n110\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's very important then\nin the project management side, right,\n\n111\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.462\nthat you do a lot of assessment of\nthe strengths and weaknesses of\n\n112\n00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:21.319\nthe companies that you're merging,\nthat you're actually gonna be merging.\n\n113\n00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.837\nNow it also brings another issue\nthat tends to happen, is mergers,\n\n114\n00:06:25.837 --> 00:06:31.070\nas far as a successful merger goes,\nyou can hire project management experts,\n\n115\n00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.070\nchange management experts,\nto help you to do this.\n\n116\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.650\nBut they found out that those bigger\nchanges, where they're actually\n\n117\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.210\nimplemented from the outside,\ndo not always end successfully.\n\n118\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.320\nAnd that's because when you go,\n\n119\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.740\nlook, you're not even trusting\nyourselves to bring this merger about,\n\n120\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.170\nwhat you're telling me is that you need\na third party to manage the entire merger.\n\n121\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.106\nMost the time you can't even get your\nemployees to really buy into that\n\n122\n00:06:55.106 --> 00:06:55.847\nsituation.\n\n123\n00:06:55.847 --> 00:06:58.590\nSo that's why you have to be very\ncareful about the idea of the merger.\n\n124\n00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.087\nIf you are a project manager that's hired\nto come in, you have to actually go ahead\n\n125\n00:07:03.087 --> 00:07:07.455\nand start from the standpoint of, who's\nactually affected in this company and\n\n126\n00:07:07.455 --> 00:07:11.500\nwhere are their particular strengths and\nweakness going to be?\n\n127\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.980\nSo that you can work to get them to\nbuy in as much as possible, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.963\nYou also need to be able to identify\nthe areas of conflict that you're probably\n\n129\n00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:24.211\ngonna see happening between\nthose two companies,\n\n130\n00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:28.742\nand work on the ability to communicate\nhow you're gonna deal with these\n\n131\n00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:31.860\nparticular types of\nconflicts that we have too.\n\n132\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.862\nSo it really does actually require\nyou then to listen, very much so, and\n\n133\n00:07:36.862 --> 00:07:43.010\nto understand what's going on when these\ntwo companies end up merging together.\n\n134\n00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.924\nEverybody like the business world loved,\nat least in the 90s,\n\n135\n00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:50.000\nI was trying to remember\nthe decade I was talking about.\n\n136\n00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.660\nIn the 90s,\nthat the key term here was synergy, right?\n\n137\n00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.271\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n138\n00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:55.443\nwell everybody loves the term synergy.\n\n139\n00:07:55.443 --> 00:07:59.309\nThat we bring in so much synergy in!\n\n140\n00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:04.410\nYou kind of get the idea that's supposed\nto be some type of compound word that\n\n141\n00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.700\nmeans something, and yet, nobody can\ndescribe what that term really means.\n\n142\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.376\nSo, when you talk about mergers, and\nyou use the term synergy, you're probably\n\n143\n00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:17.071\ngonna get a lot of blank stares, because\none, it's from the 90s first, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:20.181\nAnd two, you really haven't\ndefined what it actually means.\n\n145\n00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:24.083\nSo, you wanna make sure that\nyou articulate very well,\n\n146\n00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:26.180\nreally a key concept.\n\n147\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.630\nWhat is in this merger for me, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:34.170\nAnd everybody in that company that's\ngoing to be affected by whatever business\n\n149\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:39.330\ndecision that was made for the merger,\nthat is what they're essentially asking,\n\n150\n00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:44.440\nhow does this particular merger\nreally bring something into,\n\n151\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.720\nwell, what I am doing\nthat's gonna benefit me?\n\n152\n00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.040\nIf you can start articulating that, what\nstarts to happen within the company itself\n\n153\n00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.790\nas far as personnel goes,\nyou end up reducing, a lot of times, and\n\n154\n00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.695\nthe business disruption\nthat's gonna happen, why?\n\n155\n00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:03.960\nIt's because you've communicated\neffectively how it really does actually\n\n156\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.630\nbenefit the merger,\nthe merger or the company\n\n157\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.860\nbenefits that particular individual,\nor group of individuals do, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.710\nThe other thing it does is it actually\nbegins before the merger happens, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.550\nYou are really trying to make sure that\neverybody understands the idea here, and\n\n160\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:25.970\nso, what ends up happening after a while\nas you continue to articulate these ideas,\n\n161\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.440\nand what needs to happen,\nand what's in it for me?\n\n162\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.550\nIs that the organizational readiness for\nthe change actually will happen better.\n\n163\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.620\nNow, once I say that, right?\n\n164\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.860\nIf you've ever been a part of the merger,\nokay?\n\n165\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.200\nI found out something at some point.\n\n166\n00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:44.764\nOne, if nobody in the company is ready for\nthe idea and\n\n167\n00:09:44.764 --> 00:09:49.415\nthe announcement of the merger,\nyou're not gonna get the response-\n\n168\n00:09:49.415 --> 00:09:50.327\n&gt;&gt; Well, reception-\n\n169\n00:09:50.327 --> 00:09:50.833\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n170\n00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:53.620\nyou're not gonna get the response\nyou think you're gonna get, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.670\nI don't care how beneficial it sounds\nin your mind as a leader, you go,\n\n172\n00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.310\neverybody's gonna love this, because\nhere's all the things we're gonna do.\n\n173\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.700\nOnce you announce that things\nare changing, and that you're\n\n174\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.640\ngonna merge with another company,\nmost people don't even, they don't\n\n175\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.040\neven hear about the idea of the benefits\nanymore, because what are they thinking?\n\n176\n00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.349\nThings are going to change.\n\n177\n00:10:14.349 --> 00:10:16.740\n&gt;&gt; And they're worried about it.\n&gt;&gt; And everything's been fine, yeah.\n\n178\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.940\nSo, you really do have to\nget that unusual idea of\n\n179\n00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.990\npersonal buy-in from the people\nif you're going to do that.\n\n180\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.960\nAnd as a project manager,\nIt's strange, but\n\n181\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.200\nyou don't really have to work out all\nthe technical details by yourself.\n\n182\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.140\nYou will have a team that helps you out,\nbut\n\n183\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.760\nyour responsibility is\nreally at this point, right?\n\n184\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.820\nMaking sure that people understand\nwhy that merger is important.\n\n185\n00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.985\n&gt;&gt; So that, the morale is\ndefinitely a factor there, but\n\n186\n00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:42.655\nyou know what I've seen, Ronnie?\n\n187\n00:10:42.655 --> 00:10:48.115\nAlso, looking at it from\na organizational standpoint,\n\n188\n00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:52.115\nthat organizational readiness\nif you really don't define\n\n189\n00:10:53.275 --> 00:10:56.695\nthe negotiation process and\nrelay that to your employees,\n\n190\n00:10:56.695 --> 00:10:59.095\nthey're gonna be a little\nconfused with corporate policies.\n\n191\n00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:04.430\nIf you have conflicting policies, maybe\nthey're not sure which one to follow,\n\n192\n00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.900\nand something might fall\nthrough the cracks.\n\n193\n00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.510\nSo, from a security standpoint,\n\n194\n00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.790\nthat's extremely important, because\nthey don't know which policy to follow.\n\n195\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's key in what you're saying\nthere, that the merger brings about\n\n196\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.780\na new type of governance that ends\nup happening within the company,\n\n197\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.360\nor new type of leadership,\nwhich needs to be clearly established.\n\n198\n00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.980\nDuring the transition,\nthis is what's gonna happen, and\n\n199\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.910\neven after the transition.\n\n200\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.520\nAnd you wanna make sure\nthat that's very clear,\n\n201\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.590\nthat it's not the same way it was before,\n\n202\n00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:37.800\nin terms of the idea of merging something\ntogether to help you out in doing that.\n\n203\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.128\nBecause if you don't, you will end up\nwith a merger that ends up happening, but\n\n204\n00:11:42.128 --> 00:11:46.521\nyou might find out that you'll have more\nof the resources in which your company is\n\n205\n00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:51.042\ncounting on to stay there and to make sure\nthat everything works smoothly, they may\n\n206\n00:11:51.042 --> 00:11:55.409\nchoose to, again, find what they feel\nlike is a more comfortable fit for them.\n\n207\n00:11:55.409 --> 00:11:58.273\nAnd if it's something that's\nbeen managed fairly well, and\n\n208\n00:11:58.273 --> 00:12:00.487\nthat you've really\nactually initiated that.\n\n209\n00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:05.073\nAnd so, that's why it's actually very\nimportant that we understand this\n\n210\n00:12:05.073 --> 00:12:09.820\nparticular type of change, this is the one\nthat really does bug people a lot.\n\n211\n00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.050\nYou have to be fairly sensitive to\nwhat you will end up seeing there.\n\n212\n00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.580\nMake sure you at least understand that\naspect, and you, as a project manager,\n\n213\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.230\ngetting abroad in that.\n\n214\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.843\nThose are kinda the key areas that we\nneed to understand in terms to types\n\n215\n00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:23.637\ntable, okay?\n\n216\n00:12:23.637 --> 00:12:25.857\nNow, the good thing is Cherokee\nalso mentioned the idea,\n\n217\n00:12:25.857 --> 00:12:27.858\nwhat was that word that you used,\nCherokee?\n\n218\n00:12:27.858 --> 00:12:28.810\n&gt;&gt; The $5 word?\n\n219\n00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.219\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the $5 word.\n\n220\n00:12:30.219 --> 00:12:33.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll let you say it Ronnie, and\n\n221\n00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.330\nyou can spell it for us also.\n\n222\n00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.780\n&gt;&gt; I can't even spell it,\nbarely remember what it was.\n\n223\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.630\nIt was the vestiture, right?\n\n224\n00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:44.980\nSo, in that sense, we can talk about the\nidea of a company splitting as well, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.280\nOr the idea of a demerger or\na divestiture.\n\n226\n00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.240\nNow, sometimes this happens for,\nwell, many reasons, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.170\nHopefully, the goal here on\nthe divestiture is that it happens for\n\n228\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.160\na strategic reason, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.567\nAre there other reason that\na divestiture will happen?\n\n230\n00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:04.210\nSure, your company is\nfinancially strapped, and\n\n231\n00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.800\nyou just gotta off load something,\nbecause you need actual cash flow hand.\n\n232\n00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.280\nAnd that is a possibility,\n\n233\n00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.081\nbut normally, that's not a strategic\nmove as much as just to move to survive.\n\n234\n00:13:15.081 --> 00:13:15.950\n&gt;&gt; An emergent.\n\n235\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.772\n&gt;&gt; An emergent to type of move, very good.\n\n236\n00:13:17.772 --> 00:13:20.579\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Another $5 dollar word that Cherokee's\n\n237\n00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:22.880\nactually throwing at us today, too.\n\n238\n00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.730\nSo, when we start taking a look at\nan idea of a demerger, or a split, or\n\n239\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.220\na divestiture at this point,\nideally, it is a strategic change.\n\n240\n00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.810\nIn other words, we realize something that\nwe're not gonna be able to continue to\n\n241\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.318\ndo business in the way that we've\ntraditionally done business, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:41.318 --> 00:13:44.570\nAnd there's something\na little bit harsh for\n\n243\n00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.680\npeople to swallow,\nespecially if they've been following for\n\n244\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.340\nthis a long, a long-\n&gt;&gt; You may have to turn in the company\n\n245\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.160\ncredit card?\n\n246\n00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.410\n&gt;&gt; You may have to turn in the company\ncredit card, and even the company car,\n\n247\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.230\nif you actually have one of those.\n\n248\n00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.268\nAnd I had a friend that actually\nwent through that in working for\n\n249\n00:14:00.268 --> 00:14:02.840\nthe small company that\nhe was working with.\n\n250\n00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.240\nWhatever business that they were in,\nright?\n\n251\n00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.500\nThrough the 90s, they made tremendous\namount of monies, but then, really,\n\n252\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.770\nbeginning with like 2008,\n\n253\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:16.250\n2010 somewhere along the line,\nthey just started losing money.\n\n254\n00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:21.180\nAnd after awhile, it was like, we need\nto start kind of divesting ourselves\n\n255\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.500\nof a lot of these assets that\nwere really good perks, and man,\n\n256\n00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.040\ndid people in that company get upset.\n\n257\n00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.190\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever seen the movie Dick and\nJane with Jim Carrey?\n\n258\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.310\n&gt;&gt; I don't, it sounds familiar,\nwhat, yeah is that one of them?\n\n259\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n260\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.470\n&gt;&gt; Same concept there.\n\n261\n00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, I mean,\nif you can imagine that idea, right?\n\n262\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.391\nWhere now people are saying,\nwhat do you mean I don't have it?\n\n263\n00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:44.392\n&gt;&gt; They're having to pay the maid with\nelectronic devices throughout their home\n\n264\n00:14:44.392 --> 00:14:46.540\nbecause they don't have money\nto pay the maid anymore.\n\n265\n00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.850\n&gt;&gt; And that would be funny if it didn't\nhappen for real a lot of times here.\n\n266\n00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:56.539\nBut the key here, of course, is making\nsure that we review the situation and\n\n267\n00:14:56.539 --> 00:14:58.606\nunderstand the process, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:01.483\nMost people don't understand why\nyou're getting rid of stuff,\n\n269\n00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:04.776\nexcept that, though, even the idea\nof you're financially strapped, or\n\n270\n00:15:04.776 --> 00:15:08.370\nyour company is financially strapped,\nthey don't understand it.\n\n271\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:13.930\nAnd that is because, one, you're wondering\nwhy that decision was made when there's so\n\n272\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:18.010\nmany other things that could go,\nthat's what you also have to do.\n\n273\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.330\nYou also need to be very careful about\nthe divestiture that you're doing, or\n\n274\n00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.610\nthe idea of the reason why your\ncompany is splitting up too.\n\n275\n00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.063\nSo, you have to asses both the idea\nof cost that's it's going to cost you\n\n276\n00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:33.618\nin this idea, but at the same time,\nwhat is the risk?\n\n277\n00:15:33.618 --> 00:15:37.460\nIf you choose to go this particular\nmethod, and you're going,\n\n278\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.790\nhere's how we are going to either survive,\nor how we're going to do this.\n\n279\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.667\nRemember that as soon as you say\nthat we're splitting up the company,\n\n280\n00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:47.932\nnow you have somebody hoping that they are\ngoing to be one side of that split, and\n\n281\n00:15:47.932 --> 00:15:50.753\nsomebody hoping they are going to\nbe on the other side of that split.\n\n282\n00:15:50.753 --> 00:15:54.562\nAnd those people are going to work\ntogether, at least at the very beginning,\n\n283\n00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:56.391\nuntil everything starts to happen.\n\n284\n00:15:56.391 --> 00:16:00.341\nAnd it's at that point you really\nhave to Think about a lot of\n\n285\n00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:02.951\nother additional things here, okay.\n\n286\n00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:07.470\nSo you do have to actually take\na look at the idea of what did\n\n287\n00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.192\nyou forget in this idea of\nsplitting up the company, okay.\n\n288\n00:16:12.192 --> 00:16:15.707\nSo most people recommend\nsome type of simulation,\n\n289\n00:16:15.707 --> 00:16:20.282\nsome type of modeling, or scenario,\nso you can actually come with\n\n290\n00:16:20.282 --> 00:16:24.880\naspects of what maybe a particular\ndepartment might end up doing.\n\n291\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:31.090\nIf that particular department\ngets folded up because\n\n292\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.480\nthe idea of losing them is really\nsomething that you have to do.\n\n293\n00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.510\nAnd so when you tell them that, yes,\n\n294\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.300\nthis company is gonna split right here and\nthat what you're working on right now,\n\n295\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.690\nof course, is that somebody else buys\nthat particular part of the company.\n\n296\n00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.940\nWell, they don't know what\nthat means in the future.\n\n297\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.740\nSo you have to be very careful about\nhow you word this stuff as well.\n\n298\n00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.250\nAnd so once you actually do that,\nthen as you model everything out,\n\n299\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.850\nat that point if everything looks good,\n\n300\n00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.260\nthen start implementing that particular\nmodel that you have in place.\n\n301\n00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.950\nAnd once you have that, you hopefully\nhave now at least a starting point for\n\n302\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:13.930\na successful divestiture, or a successful\nsplit to happen for your company.\n\n303\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.650\nIt's never easy to let go of people.\n\n304\n00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.337\nBut what they're looking for at that\npoint is what does the future hold for\n\n305\n00:17:20.337 --> 00:17:21.590\nthem as well.\n\n306\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:25.690\nSo when you do this idea, are they\nstaying right here with your company, or\n\n307\n00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.330\nare they actually going to another\ncompany, because remember along with\n\n308\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.520\ngoing to another company you might find\nout that the other company says, yeah,\n\n309\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.050\nwe have jobs for everybody,\nin New Mexico where David Beem is.\n\n310\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.990\nSo you might have something like\nthat instead, and that means what?\n\n311\n00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.330\nSomebody has to make a decision\nabout what is to happen\n\n312\n00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.360\nfrom this particular point on.\n\n313\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.560\nSo you do have to be very careful in the\nway that this is gonna be professionally\n\n314\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.565\nmanaged, either by you or at least\nunderstood on how the idea is actually\n\n315\n00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:58.700\ngonna happen when you talk about\na merger or a split in this sense.\n\n316\n00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.768\n&gt;&gt; So Rodney,\nwe got a good question in the chat, and\n\n317\n00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:05.715\nit was basically summing up and\nasking when the divestitures and\n\n318\n00:18:05.715 --> 00:18:10.318\nthe acquisitions mergers and we see\nthis synergy, how did they go ahead and\n\n319\n00:18:10.318 --> 00:18:14.630\ndecide who brings what to the table,\nwho makes those decisions.\n\n320\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah at this point that's\nwhen it would be better right.\n\n321\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.850\nIs if you could figure out exactly\nhow to make that happen and\n\n322\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.510\nthe problem is you don't know during that\n\n323\n00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.290\npoint right when you're actually doing\na split who's gonna make those decisions.\n\n324\n00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.110\nSo you as a Project Manager,\n\n325\n00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.850\nyou may not have that power to say\nhow that's split's going to happen.\n\n326\n00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.110\nBut what you can do is that you can\nnow actually talk to the people that\n\n327\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.420\nare deciding that and\n\n328\n00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:44.110\nsaying, here is what on the minds\nof what is going to happen, okay?\n\n329\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.540\nWho is actually gonna get what and\n\n330\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.040\nhow this is gonna go on, and even\nthe idea of somebody leaving the company.\n\n331\n00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.800\nWhat are we gonna do if they say before\nthis split happens I want to leave,\n\n332\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.100\nI want to take my retirement?\n\n333\n00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.750\nYou gotta actually make sure that\nall of that is taken care of.\n\n334\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.710\nSo the human resource department\nwill handle a lot of that\n\n335\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.920\nparticular aspect of it, but in terms\nof whether they have profit loss or\n\n336\n00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.830\nprofit gain and\nhow they actually split all that up.\n\n337\n00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.730\nYeah that will actually be\ndecided at the board meetings and\n\n338\n00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.800\nto talk about that instead so\n\n339\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.700\nthat may be outside of your particular\nmanagement area in terms of the change.\n\n340\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.030\nNow can that be negotiated?\n\n341\n00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.170\nProbably.\n\n342\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Also remember money talks.\n\n343\n00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah money always does talk and\na lot of people take that idea,\n\n344\n00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.760\nespecially when a split comes out,\nthe idea of early retirement instead.\n\n345\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.890\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's an option.\n\n346\n00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it always is.\n\n347\n00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.450\nIt's always an option that you can\nconsider but it may not be an option\n\n348\n00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.700\nyou're willing to consider when you go,\nthis is what I'm getting?\n\n349\n00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know, for\n\n350\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.120\nmy early retirement.\n\n351\n00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.260\nBut that's one of those two options.\n\n352\n00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.790\nBut remember that the other options,\nyou have to consider them carefully.\n\n353\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.420\nIf that other company says, yeah,\nwe're splitting by the way,\n\n354\n00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.700\nthis particular department's gonna end up\nwith so and so, and everybody ready for\n\n355\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.730\nyour move to El Paso, Texas.\n\n356\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:59.900\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n357\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.800\nthat may sound great to a lot of people,\nbut it probably doesn't sound so\n\n358\n00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.970\ngreat if you said,\nwell I just bought a home last year.\n\n359\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.140\nIt probably all of a sudden now sounds\nlike, maybe, maybe not so much so.\n\n360\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.806\nBut you do give people plenty\nof time to kind of take this in.\n\n361\n00:20:14.806 --> 00:20:18.850\nSo I wish I could be more direct about the\nidea of understanding how those particular\n\n362\n00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.295\nacquisitions or that split,\n\n363\n00:20:20.295 --> 00:20:23.206\nand how the money is gonna\ndivide out I don't exactly know.\n\n364\n00:20:23.206 --> 00:20:25.716\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it will be different for\neach situation as well so yeah.\n\n365\n00:20:25.716 --> 00:20:27.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n366\n00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.940\nAll right, so the other things\nthat we also have to make sure of\n\n367\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.130\nregardless of what thick or\ntype of organization will change\n\n368\n00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:39.500\nis that you follow a management plan,\na change management plan here, okay.\n\n369\n00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.400\nThis should not be something\nthat should be where you go,\n\n370\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.810\nyeah, we're gonna work\nthis out in the future.\n\n371\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.950\nYou should follow a plan and,\nbelieve it or not, as much as you can,\n\n372\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.610\nyou don't have to actually let\neverybody know every single detail, but\n\n373\n00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:59.220\nthe big steps along that plan\nshould be publicly made for\n\n374\n00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.440\nyour company so they understand what is\ngonna happen at what particular point.\n\n375\n00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.393\nAnd you as probably the project manager\nhelping to lead this is gonna also\n\n376\n00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:13.507\nneed to again articulate that this is\nwhere the change plan is coming from so\n\n377\n00:21:13.507 --> 00:21:16.284\nthat nobody is surprised along the way.\n\n378\n00:21:16.284 --> 00:21:19.884\nWhat they don't like is the surprises\nalong the way where it's like, yeah,\n\n379\n00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:22.906\nby the way, we split off and\nwe thought that this was gonna happen.\n\n380\n00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:24.784\n&gt;&gt; About that 401K.\n\n381\n00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, about that 401K.\n\n382\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.055\nGood luck in finding it now.\n\n383\n00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:29.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, but\n\n384\n00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.460\nthings like this happen, right?\n\n385\n00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.790\nLet's say that your company says look,\nhere's what's gonna happen.\n\n386\n00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:38.490\nWe're essentially gonna split off and\nhere's what we've all ready,\n\n387\n00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:43.940\nwe've been in contract or\nwe've been talking with xyz company.\n\n388\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.210\nXYZ Company says, all right,\neverything's going through.\n\n389\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.730\nA month happens and\nyou don't hear anything about it.\n\n390\n00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:56.250\nAnd then two months later,\nmerger business starts moving again.\n\n391\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.910\nAnd now it's like, yeah, by the way,\nCompany ABC is really excited about this.\n\n392\n00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.600\nAnd you go, wait, wait, wait, whoa,\nwhoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.\n\n393\n00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.490\nTwo months ago,\nyou were talking about XYZ Company.\n\n394\n00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:10.320\nAnd now you're talking about\nABC Company here, what is going on?\n\n395\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.160\nSee, you leave that bit\nof uncertainty in there,\n\n396\n00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.900\nthat's where the plan kind of falls apart.\n\n397\n00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.810\nSo you need to make sure that you\nestablish a good type of process change\n\n398\n00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.110\nthat's really going to\nhelp people out as well.\n\n399\n00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.170\nSo regardless of whether we're\ntalking about a merger or\n\n400\n00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.200\na split, they also need to know about\ntheir particular job, whether or\n\n401\n00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.490\nnot there's actually gonna be some more\nprocessing of information that goes on.\n\n402\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:39.390\nIs there any particular developments in\nthe future that could change things for\n\n403\n00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:40.430\nwhat we have?\n\n404\n00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:45.340\nAny type of automated process, any type of\ninformation processing that's gonna give\n\n405\n00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.330\na different view or an outlook on what\nmay happen to the company in the future.\n\n406\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.570\nEverybody wants more details,\nis what they really want.\n\n407\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.220\nAnd even though you can't\nprovide every single detail,\n\n408\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.560\nyou should be as transparent as you can\nabout the change if at all possible.\n\n409\n00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.040\nAnd maybe you as a project manager,\nyou're just told look,\n\n410\n00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.670\nI just need you to get through this,\nI'm not gonna tell you anything,\n\n411\n00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.800\nwell hopefully you wont actually work for\nsomeone like that.\n\n412\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.340\n&gt;&gt; That's where you're\ngonna meet the resistance.\n\n413\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.900\n&gt;&gt; That's where you're gonna\nmeet a ton of resistance.\n\n414\n00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.500\nSo just make sure you understand\nthat it does actually involve more\n\n415\n00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.500\nthan this idea of just we'll just\nhandle it as it comes along.\n\n416\n00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.370\nCan that be a process unto itself?\n\n417\n00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.260\nYes.\n\n418\n00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.607\nYou can kind of go, all right we'll\ndeal with it when it comes along, but\n\n419\n00:23:27.607 --> 00:23:31.173\nthat is not anything that's\never settling for a particular\n\n420\n00:23:31.173 --> 00:23:36.135\norganization when you discuss, and\nit happens, we'll deal with it.\n\n421\n00:23:36.135 --> 00:23:38.850\nIt never brings anybody\nany type of certainty, or\n\n422\n00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:43.377\nany type of relaxation whenever you start\ntalking about this, especially in terms\n\n423\n00:23:43.377 --> 00:23:47.664\nof those big things such as the merger or\nthe actual splits that happened here.\n\n424\n00:23:47.664 --> 00:23:53.275\nSo always make sure you follow the idea of\nthe process change that is going to occur,\n\n425\n00:23:53.275 --> 00:23:57.544\nand that you do let people know\nwhen things start rolling here.\n\n426\n00:23:57.544 --> 00:23:59.854\nHere is what is gonna\nhappen to your department.\n\n427\n00:23:59.854 --> 00:24:03.750\nHere is the roles that\nare gonna change here.\n\n428\n00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:08.850\nAnd you give them enough information,\nthey process that a lot easier,\n\n429\n00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.770\nregardless of whether it's actually\nthe split or the merger itself.\n\n430\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.020\n&gt;&gt; Well not to mention it's\njust the proper thing to do.\n\n431\n00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.210\nIf someone has any kind of\nmedically needy family and\n\n432\n00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:21.150\ntheir dependence on the insurance and\ngetting all that situated,\n\n433\n00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.800\nI'm sure you guys have\ndealt with that before.\n\n434\n00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.920\nIt can be kind of cumbersome at times.\n\n435\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is no doubt that this\nis what can happen very easily.\n\n436\n00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.170\nNow, the changes that we've talked about,\nright.\n\n437\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:35.390\nThey are gigantic changes,\nwhenever an organization says merger or\n\n438\n00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.040\nsplit, you don't really know what\ndirection that a company is going.\n\n439\n00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.625\nYou're hoping that those\nmoves are strategic enough to\n\n440\n00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:46.828\nwhere it's actually beneficial\nboth of those merge companies.\n\n441\n00:24:46.828 --> 00:24:51.142\nOr when you split off it's at least\na benefit to you, and you believe that\n\n442\n00:24:51.142 --> 00:24:56.000\nwhoever's going to essentially get\nthe divestiture part of what you have.\n\n443\n00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.310\nIt's gonna be beneficial to those\nemployees that go along there, too, okay.\n\n444\n00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.556\nSo that's the goal is a win,\nwin in every situation, okay.\n\n445\n00:25:05.556 --> 00:25:09.678\nBut there's sometimes where the change\nis not as monumental as what\n\n446\n00:25:09.678 --> 00:25:12.569\nwe're talking about,\nand when that happens,\n\n447\n00:25:12.569 --> 00:25:17.160\nwe are now talking about the dreaded\nterm of reorganization, okay.\n\n448\n00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.809\nInternal reorganization.\n\n449\n00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:24.502\nNow this too,\nshould be a strategic change, but\n\n450\n00:25:24.502 --> 00:25:30.981\nwhat I see more often than not in\nterms of internal reorganization.\n\n451\n00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Restructuring sometimes people call it.\n\n452\n00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, restructuring, yeah, yeah.\n\n453\n00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.940\nWhen you start actually hearing that\nis I see people changing just for\n\n454\n00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.450\nthe sake of change, okay.\n\n455\n00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.100\nThey just feel like it\nwould work better this way.\n\n456\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.331\nThey feel like that they're\nnot close enough to this or\n\n457\n00:25:45.331 --> 00:25:48.550\nthey're not actually doing this or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n458\n00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:53.720\nAnd that's kinda the worst type of\nreorganization when it's just unplanned,\n\n459\n00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.510\nbut you feel like there is a need for\na change.\n\n460\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.270\nAnd a lot of times the reason\nthy that's actually there, and\n\n461\n00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.980\nwhy you see the change for\nit, for the sake of change.\n\n462\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.830\nIt normally revolves around personalities\nmore than anything else within\n\n463\n00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.330\nan organization.\n\n464\n00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.877\nThis is why in-\n&gt;&gt; Internal bureacracy.\n\n465\n00:26:11.877 --> 00:26:16.521\n&gt;&gt; Internal bureaucracy, internal\nstruggles, internal power struggles here.\n\n466\n00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:20.545\nPeople not liking each other like Cherokee\nand I don't like, no, I'm joking.\n\n467\n00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:21.430\n&gt;&gt; Wah.\n\n468\n00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.205\n&gt;&gt; But here you have those situations.\n\n469\n00:26:24.205 --> 00:26:29.012\nAnd whenever an organization itself,\nokay, has to change just\n\n470\n00:26:29.012 --> 00:26:33.382\nbecause of personalities\nsomething else is wrong there.\n\n471\n00:26:33.382 --> 00:26:38.762\nOkay, it should never just be done based\non the idea of personality overall.\n\n472\n00:26:38.762 --> 00:26:43.915\nOkay, so at this particular point,\nwhen you start seeing this type of change.\n\n473\n00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:46.865\nOkay, if it's based around\na personality it doesn't matter.\n\n474\n00:26:46.865 --> 00:26:48.770\nOkay, it really doesn't matter.\n\n475\n00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:52.380\nThey'll change and in five or six months\nguess what, they'll wanna do it again.\n\n476\n00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.290\nThey'll wanna change it again, okay.\n\n477\n00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:58.101\nAnd so you'll have people constantly\nmoving around offices every five or\n\n478\n00:26:58.101 --> 00:26:58.782\nsix months.\n\n479\n00:26:58.782 --> 00:27:02.261\nAnd you might be wondering, wow does\nthat sound familiar every year or so\n\n480\n00:27:02.261 --> 00:27:04.500\npeople are moving around the office?\n\n481\n00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.519\nYou better believe it happens all\nthe time in these organizations.\n\n482\n00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:11.656\nWhere you've got people that settled into\none office, and then you go and see them\n\n483\n00:27:11.656 --> 00:27:14.810\nagain, and they're actually in a totally\ndifferent part of the building again-\n\n484\n00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.350\n&gt;&gt; It could be hard to keep up sometimes.\n\n485\n00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.570\n&gt;&gt; It really is, it's insanely difficult.\n\n486\n00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.760\nAnd you might be wondering, Ronnie,\nhow do you know that this happens?\n\n487\n00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.240\nIt's because, not because I've been a part\nof that particular organization, but\n\n488\n00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.650\nsomebody in my family.\n\n489\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:30.986\nEvery time I went to see them when I lived\nin a different state, and I'd come and\n\n490\n00:27:30.986 --> 00:27:34.290\nvisit to them it's like,\nyeah, let's meet for lunch.\n\n491\n00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.920\nAnd I go, and they're like, yeah,\nthey're down this hallway now.\n\n492\n00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.580\nAnd then six months later,\nor a year later, no,\n\n493\n00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.510\nthey're over here in\nthe back of the building.\n\n494\n00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.210\nI'm like, are you joking?\n\n495\n00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:46.280\nEvery single time it would\nactually be a different location.\n\n496\n00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.370\nAnd they're like, yeah they just keep\ndeciding that they're gonna move people\n\n497\n00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:54.550\naround and get better control over here,\nand to do this, and whatever it might be.\n\n498\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.880\nBut that's when you start finding out that\nthey are literally moving people around\n\n499\n00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.000\njust to move people around, okay.\n\n500\n00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.370\nSo it's not ever good.\n\n501\n00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:06.710\nIf it's a personality problem, you gotta\nthink what needs to be restructured,\n\n502\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:11.310\nand what needs to change is not\nthe organization itself but what?\n\n503\n00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:16.060\nThe person's attitude, it needs to\nbe restructured and changed as well.\n\n504\n00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.000\nSo this is where you do have\nto kind of understand that.\n\n505\n00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.390\nBut will people do it?\n\n506\n00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.920\nYes.\n\n507\n00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.550\nShould it be done just\nbased on personality?\n\n508\n00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.240\nNever.\n\n509\n00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.740\nThe idea of reorganization in terms of\nstrategy should always be done, right.\n\n510\n00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.621\nTo help us to increase maybe\nthe benefits to the organization, and\n\n511\n00:28:32.621 --> 00:28:36.168\nto help us to minimize any\nunintended consequences, okay.\n\n512\n00:28:36.168 --> 00:28:38.760\nSo that's actually one of the ideas-\n&gt;&gt; A positive.\n\n513\n00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.114\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To strategic change.\n\n514\n00:28:40.114 --> 00:28:43.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if it's not, okay,\nyou gotta ask yourselves why, okay.\n\n515\n00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.064\nIf there's no real strategic\nbenefit to it, okay.\n\n516\n00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:51.752\nIf there is no reason to actually do it\nbesides someone's personality, then yeah,\n\n517\n00:28:51.752 --> 00:28:56.350\nit's not gonna really help if you just\nmove the pieces around the board.\n\n518\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:01.000\nIt's just strange, so you don't want\nanything like that to happen, okay.\n\n519\n00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.020\nIf there is a move, what you want to\ndo is, of course, increase the idea\n\n520\n00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:09.187\nof productivity, in terms of\nan organizational restructuring, okay.\n\n521\n00:29:09.187 --> 00:29:12.919\nThat productivity doesn't always have to\nbe like a workflow, even though that's\n\n522\n00:29:12.919 --> 00:29:17.320\nusually traditional, because it actually\ndoes make for a more efficient workflow.\n\n523\n00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.930\nBut it should be something based\nalong those guidelines here, okay.\n\n524\n00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.020\nThat the organization\nis needing to change up\n\n525\n00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.750\nwhere the internal restructuring is going.\n\n526\n00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.770\nSo you might find out that you have\ntoo many people on one team, okay.\n\n527\n00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:32.260\nAnd there's another department that's\nactually in your building that needs what?\n\n528\n00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.640\nThey need members,\nbecause nobody they can get.\n\n529\n00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.640\nThey can't get anybody to work with them.\n\n530\n00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.530\nWhat's even worse, right,\n\n531\n00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:42.320\nis that it becomes territory\ntype of struggle as well, okay.\n\n532\n00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.930\nOne particular group that's shrinking,\n\n533\n00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.810\nthey continue to have the largest\noffice in the building, okay.\n\n534\n00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.870\nThe other group that needs more seats, but\n\n535\n00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:52.160\nthey're all crammed on top of each other,\nthey don't.\n\n536\n00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.880\nAnd then you come in and say,\nguess what we're gonna do.\n\n537\n00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.640\nWe're gonna actually switch your places\nhere, cuz your particular department\n\n538\n00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.220\ndoesn't need that many desks and\nthis department needs more.\n\n539\n00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.240\nWell, now you can imagine that,\nthat is gonna cause some rumblings and\n\n540\n00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.370\ngrumblings as well, okay.\n\n541\n00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.060\nSo there is a lot of different\nthings that you have to\n\n542\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.600\nactually think about\nwhenever you're doing that.\n\n543\n00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.090\nSo hopefully it's gonna\nhelp you to accomplish more\n\n544\n00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.770\nof whatever purpose that organization\nis set up for as well, okay.\n\n545\n00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.010\n&gt;&gt; I think Ronnie can go ahead and\nspeak upon this next topic.\n\n546\n00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.600\nI feel like we're pretty\nfamiliarized with that relocation.\n\n547\n00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so when we start talking about\nthis idea of relocation here, right.\n\n548\n00:30:32.895 --> 00:30:37.830\nYou're moving, okay, usually of course\nactually from one area to another.\n\n549\n00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.150\nMaybe from one you know\nplace to another one.\n\n550\n00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.390\nJust like us here at IT Pro TV.\n\n551\n00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:48.809\nOur particular relocation of our\nstudios is really right down the road.\n\n552\n00:30:48.809 --> 00:30:51.207\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwell, if it's so close,\n\n553\n00:30:51.207 --> 00:30:54.052\nwhy did you choose to move at all\nif you're brand new to ITProTV.\n\n554\n00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:58.249\nWell it's because we really\ndid run out of space, okay.\n\n555\n00:30:58.249 --> 00:31:02.993\nWe were essentially in the back half of a\nwarehouse that was converted to a studio,\n\n556\n00:31:02.993 --> 00:31:05.904\nand there were like seven\nof us sitting in an area-\n\n557\n00:31:05.904 --> 00:31:07.615\n&gt;&gt; You guys were cramped, very cramped.\n\n558\n00:31:07.615 --> 00:31:11.772\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was almost like we were\nsitting on top of each other's desk.\n\n559\n00:31:11.772 --> 00:31:14.910\nThat if we actually had two levels on top\nof each other that's probably what we\n\n560\n00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.580\nwould have had.\n\n561\n00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.693\n&gt;&gt; Definitely a good problem though.\n\n562\n00:31:16.693 --> 00:31:21.324\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was a good problem, but at\nthe same time it definitely showed that we\n\n563\n00:31:21.324 --> 00:31:26.145\nneeded to relocate somewhere, okay,\nto a business size where we were.\n\n564\n00:31:26.145 --> 00:31:29.590\nSo the key is, right,\nis that we don't relocate just,\n\n565\n00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.160\nbecause you know what I feel\nlike we're gonna move today.\n\n566\n00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.280\n&gt;&gt; They have a better view.\n\n567\n00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.361\n&gt;&gt; Yeah better view, and you can, okay.\n\n568\n00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:38.000\nDon't get me wrong all that's possible.\n\n569\n00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.180\nBut the very fact is it actually\nneeds to be objective oriented, and\n\n570\n00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.090\nthat's what we did right\nhere in the studios.\n\n571\n00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:46.770\nWe moved from really about one to one and\na half to two studios.\n\n572\n00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.984\nYou might be wondering,\nhow do you do one and a half studios.\n\n573\n00:31:48.984 --> 00:31:51.961\nWell it wasn't functioning\nfull time every day, right.\n\n574\n00:31:51.961 --> 00:31:55.760\nSo we might have some shows in there some\ndays, but we normally at least had one\n\n575\n00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.518\nstudio that was working pretty much\nmorning and afternoon which was great.\n\n576\n00:31:59.518 --> 00:32:04.876\nTo hopefully in the near future here,\nfive studios operating all day long, okay?\n\n577\n00:32:04.876 --> 00:32:05.596\n&gt;&gt; Mind blowing.\n\n578\n00:32:05.596 --> 00:32:07.020\n&gt;&gt; Mind blowing and a lot.\n\n579\n00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.940\n&gt;&gt; I'm so excited, yes.\n\n580\n00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.380\n&gt;&gt; But that's why we actually moved right.\n\n581\n00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.830\nThere's an objective behind it.\n\n582\n00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:15.275\nThe key here, though, is that you do\nneed to have this when you relocate for\n\n583\n00:32:15.275 --> 00:32:16.653\nthe purpose of the building.\n\n584\n00:32:16.653 --> 00:32:19.714\nGood, solid, two-way communication, okay?\n\n585\n00:32:19.714 --> 00:32:23.016\nMake sure you understand this\nidea of active listening, and\n\n586\n00:32:23.016 --> 00:32:26.320\ndo not discount ideas regardless\nof where they come from.\n\n587\n00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.445\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what you're saying is\nI should understand active listening?\n\n588\n00:32:29.445 --> 00:32:31.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You should understand the idea of\n\n589\n00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:32.810\nactive listening.\n\n590\n00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.820\nMake sure you hear the words\ncoming out of my mouth right now.\n\n591\n00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.789\nYes, that's exactly what\nI'm saying here okay.\n\n592\n00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:40.685\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; So it is very possible that we do that.\n\n593\n00:32:40.685 --> 00:32:44.490\nYou also need to make sure that people do\nhave a buy in or that you have someone\n\n594\n00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:48.610\nthat's so excited about the project\nthat they become contagious.\n\n595\n00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:49.483\nThey really do okay.\n\n596\n00:32:49.483 --> 00:32:50.060\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n597\n00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:50.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really helps.\n\n598\n00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:51.818\n&gt;&gt; And it goes both ways also.\n\n599\n00:32:51.818 --> 00:32:53.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Negativity is contagious and\n\n600\n00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.270\npositivity is contagious.\n\n601\n00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThere's no doubt\n\n602\n00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.790\nwhen you start doing that.\n\n603\n00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.650\nAlso with a relocation\nyou find out something.\n\n604\n00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:04.330\nEven though the ultimate goal is\nto get everybody over there, and\n\n605\n00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.990\ndoing what they need to do,\n\n606\n00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.680\nyou also end up finding out something\nthat small victories along the way.\n\n607\n00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.140\nIn other words, letting people\nknow what's happening inside of\n\n608\n00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.980\nwhatever your moving to that\nthey're preparing a place for you.\n\n609\n00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:21.040\nIt really does bring that idea of\nexcitement, like when we were doing it,\n\n610\n00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.870\nthat's probably when this\nwas a shell of a building.\n\n611\n00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.410\nIt was nice for Tim and Don to come in and\n\n612\n00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.810\ngo, here's the studio\nyou're gonna be in Ronnie.\n\n613\n00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.720\nHere's where you're gonna be working,\n\n614\n00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.610\nit was kind of neat to be able to realize\nthat this is where it would happen.\n\n615\n00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:40.120\nSo that's why it's actually very\nimportant because it allows that buy-in\n\n616\n00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.350\nto happen as well, and\nthe small victory along the way, right,\n\n617\n00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:48.840\nto know that, this is where I'm eventually\ngoing to end up being is right here.\n\n618\n00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.690\nAnd then of course,\n\n619\n00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.780\nduring this entire change you've got to\nmake sure that everything that's in place\n\n620\n00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:57.940\nhere, that you make sure that the location\nhappens with the right group of people.\n\n621\n00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.010\nAnd that means project management again,\nokay?\n\n622\n00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.130\nBecause if you get the wrong group of\npeople and they drag their feet on\n\n623\n00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.740\nthat project of the relocation, people\nthat go I can't believe we need to move.\n\n624\n00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.240\n&gt;&gt; Maybe end up paying\nrent in both locations for\n\n625\n00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.380\nawhile when you only budgeted for\none location.\n\n626\n00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be, and\nthat normally does end up\n\n627\n00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:21.520\nhappening because not everything works on\nyour timeline as much as you'd like it to.\n\n628\n00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.010\nBut overall though, you gotta realize\nthat this is a possibility here.\n\n629\n00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:30.110\nSo relocation is a big part of it too.\n\n630\n00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:34.630\nNow, our last little topic then is\ngoing to be in the area of what we call\n\n631\n00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.730\noutsourcing.\n\n632\n00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.203\n&gt;&gt; It's when we start\ntaking a look at this.\n\n633\n00:34:38.203 --> 00:34:40.560\nNow Cherokee, outsourcing.\n\n634\n00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.820\nWhat do you think we're talking about now?\n\n635\n00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.520\nThis is a little bit more unusual for\ncompanies.\n\n636\n00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.590\nMaybe.\n\n637\n00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.095\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I tend to disagree.\n\n638\n00:34:49.095 --> 00:34:51.855\nI think it's becoming\nincreasingly more popular.\n\n639\n00:34:53.015 --> 00:34:56.365\nWe see outsourcing, and this is\njust my personal opinion on it, but\n\n640\n00:34:56.365 --> 00:35:00.955\nI think that companies are gonna\ngo ahead and opt for contractors,\n\n641\n00:35:00.955 --> 00:35:05.870\nbecause they have Less of an internal\nliability, insurance reasons.\n\n642\n00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:12.120\nAlso, they don't have to pay out any of\nthose retirements and things like that so\n\n643\n00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:17.280\nfrom a cost cutting perspective I think\na lot of companies see that as a benefit.\n\n644\n00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.920\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly what\nthe companies will see is a benefit in\n\n645\n00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.850\nterms of the way of cost.\n\n646\n00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.670\nBut remember,\nthat even with something like that\n\n647\n00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:26.850\nthat's the only thing that\nyour employees may see.\n\n648\n00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.070\nIs that you know who's benefiting?\n\n649\n00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.970\nYou are Ronnie,\ncuz you're the one that made the decision.\n\n650\n00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.620\nIt's not benefiting me.\n\n651\n00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.140\nSo this is where it's very\nimportant as a project manager\n\n652\n00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.180\nif this is what's going to happen.\n\n653\n00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:44.203\nThat we really do have to get them to buy\nin to the idea that this is a good idea.\n\n654\n00:35:44.203 --> 00:35:49.010\nGood luck with that notion,\nthat this is a great idea.\n\n655\n00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:53.900\n&gt;&gt; I think if you put a spin on\nit maybe like a technical aspect.\n\n656\n00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.630\nIf it's above my skill or knowledge level\nthen I'm going to go ahead ans say,\n\n657\n00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.640\nlook it's either you learning how to\ndo this or we are going to go ahead and\n\n658\n00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.200\nbring someone in for that task.\n\n659\n00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.430\n&gt;&gt; Yes and all of a sudden Cherokee\njust gave us a good point here.\n\n660\n00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.666\nOnce you give them an ultimatum,\nthey'll agree.\n\n661\n00:36:07.666 --> 00:36:09.182\n[LAUGH] I'm joking.\n\n662\n00:36:09.182 --> 00:36:11.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, but the idea is simple, right?\n\n663\n00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.610\nYes, somebody does need to buy into this.\n\n664\n00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.230\nAnd so, it should never be\ndelivered in terms of an ultimatum.\n\n665\n00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.475\nI was just picking on Cherokee, there.\n\n666\n00:36:18.475 --> 00:36:20.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that was a good one, though!\n\n667\n00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.115\nCherokee is like, yeah, once you let them\nknow that this is what's going to happen.\n\n668\n00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:28.265\n[LAUGH] You step up to the game or\nwe're going to lop you off.\n\n669\n00:36:28.265 --> 00:36:30.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that they buy in to\n\n670\n00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.515\nyour particular idea of thinking chair.\n\n671\n00:36:32.515 --> 00:36:33.651\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A good one.\n\n672\n00:36:33.651 --> 00:36:38.020\n[LAUGH] But no,\nthe idea is still that same aspect, right?\n\n673\n00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.290\nOutsourcing is never an easy\ntopic to broach, right?\n\n674\n00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:44.270\nCuz people wonder why in the world\ncan we get this done away?\n\n675\n00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.570\nAnd that's always a good question.\n\n676\n00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:50.230\nBut it is usually issues like what\nCherokee has mentioned is that\n\n677\n00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:54.410\nwe're not really equipped to handle\nwhat this company is already able to do.\n\n678\n00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:59.470\nSo you do have to get them to make sure\nthat the buy in is actually clear, and\n\n679\n00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:03.260\nalso, they need to understand that\nyou're gonna provide training for\n\n680\n00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:08.660\nthem to show how that's gonna integrate\nin with the company that you have, okay?\n\n681\n00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.790\nSo there's a lot of different features for\nus to actually think about this idea when\n\n682\n00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.470\nwe start taking a look here that\nwe have to remember as well.\n\n683\n00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did have one extra question,\n\n684\n00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:22.190\nand Chad, I know we're right there on\nthe time, but the question was, so\n\n685\n00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:26.380\nin a nutshell is relocation a result\nof careless business planning?\n\n686\n00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:31.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it is a result of careless\nbusiness planning at times\n\n687\n00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:35.430\nwhen you go look,\nwe're just gonna relocate because\n\n688\n00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:39.710\neverybody has bad feelings about\nthis particular location, okay?\n\n689\n00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.500\nNobody wants to come to work here.\n\n690\n00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.030\nOkay, now that could be a driving force,\nbut remember that the goal and\n\n691\n00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:49.140\nidea behind relocation should\nalways be about strategy, okay?\n\n692\n00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.580\nWhat is that relocation going\nto help you to do better?\n\n693\n00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:57.000\nNow, if you do, if you go, look,\nI have the extra million-and-a-half.\n\n694\n00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.940\nWe're just gonna relocate over\nhere to the east side of town.\n\n695\n00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.630\nI'm making a Jefferson's reference for\nthose of you that don't know.\n\n696\n00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.020\nWell that's the whole idea okay.\n\n697\n00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.570\nWell then yes it is a careless\nbusiness types of planning and\n\n698\n00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.260\nchange here that you have to happen.\n\n699\n00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.450\nSo that money could actually be used for\nbetter and\n\n700\n00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:20.290\nthat's why I talked about the idea as\nsomebody mentioned it as careless.\n\n701\n00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:23.890\nIf you know that there's a better\nway that that money can be spent\n\n702\n00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.790\nas far as the company goes,\nyou may not have that decision making,\n\n703\n00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.350\nbut whoever does, and they go,\nI have this decision.\n\n704\n00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.350\nI can either improve, you know,\n\n705\n00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:34.390\nour current office space by adding this,\nthis, and this.\n\n706\n00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:35.240\nRemodeling and\n\n707\n00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.790\nmake it better, make it nice or\nwe can just move to another location.\n\n708\n00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.700\nWhat is the advantage of moving a little?\n\n709\n00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.890\nNothing, it's just a new location.\n\n710\n00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:48.520\nWell, again that is more\ncareless than anything else.\n\n711\n00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.460\nBut if you actually are moving in because\nyou realize that brings you closer\n\n712\n00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.820\nto the interstate where you\nwanna see more you know.\n\n713\n00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.670\n&gt;&gt; Increase traffic.\n\n714\n00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Increase traffic or you actually need\n\n715\n00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:00.610\nto relocate like what we did because\nwe just didn't just enough space.\n\n716\n00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.640\nSo that really wasn't due\nto careless planning,\n\n717\n00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.390\nthat's just outgrowing your building.\n\n718\n00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd\n\n719\n00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.180\nthat's the strategy is that in\nthis particular building is that\n\n720\n00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.580\nwe believe that this is sufficient\nspace for us that we're going to have.\n\n721\n00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.930\nAnd that the great thing is,\nat this point it is,\n\n722\n00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:18.210\nbut maybe in the near future we might\nactually find ourselves maybe needing to\n\n723\n00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.480\nrelocate again if we continue to\ngrow in the fashion that we have.\n\n724\n00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.670\n&gt;&gt; That would be awesome.\n\n725\n00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:22.500\nOkay.\n\n726\n00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.980\n&gt;&gt; I think that about wraps it up for\norganizational changes in this episode.\n\n727\n00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.430\nSo thank you guys so much for tuning in,\nand thank you Ronnie for tuning in, for\n\n728\n00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.890\nbeing here with us today, not tuning in.\n\n729\n00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:33.410\nBut that's about about it.\n\n730\n00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.718\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n731\n00:39:34.718 --> 00:39:36.405\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n732\n00:39:36.405 --> 00:39:37.765\n&gt;&gt; Signing off, have a great day.\n\n733\n00:39:37.765 --> 00:39:43.818\n[MUSIC]\n\n734\n00:39:43.818 --> 00:39:48.430\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

00:00:07.352\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n4\n00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:08.482\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:10.483\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.483 --> 00:00:15.570\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nCompTIA Project+ episode.\n\n7\n00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.630\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.310\nIn this episode we're gonna\nbe looking at the many\n\n9\n00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.200\ndifferent management tools that\nwe have available to us, so\n\n10\n00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.540\nget comfortable,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get started.\n\n11\n00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.520\nHere we have Mr. Ronnie Wong with us,\nto help us with that today.\n\n12\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.500\nThank you Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.190\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n14\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.930\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\nas we continue with our CompTIA Project+.\n\n15\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.990\nWe are going to be taking it some of\nthe different tools that you as a project\n\n16\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.600\nmanager are going to encounter and\nthey are tools that will really help\n\n17\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.310\nyou to grasp and understand the situations\nthat you may find yourselves in,\n\n18\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.160\nin the middle of actually\nmanaging a project.\n\n19\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.460\nSo, when we start to take a look\nwe're gonna take a look at some of\n\n20\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.310\nthe different software.\n\n21\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.060\nWe're gonna talk about some\nresources that you can recommend for\n\n22\n00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.640\nyour team as well as take a look at\nsome of the other things that we have\n\n23\n00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.560\navailable, which leads into the area,\nof course, of performance indexing\n\n24\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.440\nas well as performance indicators,\nwhich means formulas.\n\n25\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.120\nYes, we've got a whole slew of them.\n\n26\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.950\n&gt;&gt; Yay, math.\n\n27\n00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.680\n&gt;&gt; Great,\ngood thing that Cherokee loves math,\n\n28\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.470\ncuz that's one of the challenges that\nwe're gonna end up seeing here as well.\n\n29\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.260\nBut the great thing is, we do need\nto take a look at these tools so\n\n30\n00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.395\nthat you'll at least be familiar\nwith them as we get started.\n\n31\n00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:28.235\nSo one of the first things that we want,\nI shouldn't say we,\n\n32\n00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:33.865\nI should say I want you to understand,\nis that you can do project management\n\n33\n00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:39.095\nthe old fashioned way without any\nsoftware that's available to you.\n\n34\n00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:41.940\nYou absolutely can if you choose to.\n\n35\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.870\nBut if you choose to do so.\n\n36\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.510\nThat's way old school, okay.\n\n37\n00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.860\nSo if you choose to do\nsomething like that,\n\n38\n00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.470\nthat means you are going to keep\nessentially track of everything manually.\n\n39\n00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.340\nSo in major scheduling you're gonna\nhave one of those big calendars.\n\n40\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.500\nYou know that you have as far as different\nappointments go that you need to keep.\n\n41\n00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.540\nYou know for people.\n\n42\n00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.430\nYou also of course need a contact or\nthe older term for it is a Rolodex.\n\n43\n00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.720\nCherokee, Rolodex,\nhave you ever heard of Rolodex there?\n\n44\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.140\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, maybe.\n\n45\n00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.650\n&gt;&gt; A Rolodex right, where you have to spin\nit around and get the actual information\n\n46\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.510\nfor the people, and know exactly who you\nneed to contact when things go wrong.\n\n47\n00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.650\nSo you'll have to keep a Rolodex\non hand as well, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.170\nThe other thing, of course, is that you're\nvery familiar with the United States\n\n49\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.590\npostal system, and you're willing\nto work with their timeliness and\n\n50\n00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.450\nthe way that they deliver things as you\nneed them to actually have as well.\n\n51\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.650\nAnd of course very comfortable with\nbeing on the phone about 23 and\n\n52\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.100\na half hours a day to get everything\nlined up the way that you need to.\n\n53\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.450\nSo at a minimum you need what?\n\n54\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.880\nYou need contacts, you need to have\nsome type of calendaring system.\n\n55\n00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.420\nYou need to have the ability to schedule\npeople in that calendaring system.\n\n56\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.860\nYou have to have tracking abilities to\nensure that people are reporting task back\n\n57\n00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.590\nto you, that are getting completed, or how\nfar along that they're being completed.\n\n58\n00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.310\nSo you have to have that ability,\nso you need to have two or\n\n59\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.430\nthree different assistants that are\nconstantly monitoring your entire project,\n\n60\n00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.010\nand eventing is actually\ngoing along that way.\n\n61\n00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.400\nCherokee, sound like a lot of fun?\n\n62\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.450\n&gt;&gt; It sounds absolutely miserable, but\nit does sound a little independent in case\n\n63\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.970\nany kind of systems were to fail,\nbut I don't know.\n\n64\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.800\nIt's painful.\n\n65\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does sound a little bit\nmore taxing if you're doing it that way.\n\n66\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.940\nBut people successfully have done project\nmanagement for thousands of years\n\n67\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.760\nwithout actually using a single computer\nsystem ever to do something like this.\n\n68\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.100\nBut today with the advent,\nof course, of what we call TMIS's.\n\n69\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.970\nI know that sounds strange,\nit's a weird acronym, right?\n\n70\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.060\nProject Management Information System\nis some type of software\n\n71\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.550\nthat really combines all those\ndifferent elements together to help\n\n72\n00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.700\nensure we can keep track of things\nas a project manager a lot easier.\n\n73\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.550\nAnd there are many different\nsystems that are out there.\n\n74\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.620\nAnd depending on the size and\n\n75\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.640\nof course on the industry that you're\nworking in you'll probably see of course\n\n76\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.950\neverybody recommends something\na little bit different okay.\n\n77\n00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.220\nSo there's a lot of different\ntypes that are out there.\n\n78\n00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.150\nAnd you'll actually even see some\nfree versions that are out there\n\n79\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.800\nthat'll help you actually display things\na little bit graphically that'll help\n\n80\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.250\nchange things as well.\n\n81\n00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.460\nSo we're gonna see at\nleast one example of that.\n\n82\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.630\nAnd I'm gonna use the one\nthat I'm more familiar with,\n\n83\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.120\nwhich is gonna be Microsoft Project, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.120\nNow this particular tool\nis a very good tool.\n\n85\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.330\nIt is, to me at least, fairly fancy and\n\n86\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.190\nall of the features that has available and\nyou might find yourself and\n\n87\n00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.200\nsay in that situation which come,\nman, that's an expensive tool.\n\n88\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.330\nIt really is as pretty expensive.\n\n89\n00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.380\nFor you to be able to have this, and\nthat's the very fact is it's not\n\n90\n00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.600\ndesign to be like on every single\ncomputer out there in the world.\n\n91\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.590\nIt's really designed for\nthat kind of small market right\n\n92\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.620\nof projet managers that\nreally need a tool like this.\n\n93\n00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.190\nSo let's go and I'll show you some of the\nbasic features of something like using.\n\n94\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.340\nMicrosoft Project to help you to\nmanage your projects overall, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.000\nSo on my screen I wanna had and\n\n96\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.130\nbrought up my particular\naddition of Microsoft Project.\n\n97\n00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.460\nThis is Microsoft Project 2013.\n\n98\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.540\nI keep saying 2012 and\nthat's not the true.\n\n99\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.280\n2013 and\nI've got a sample template project, so\n\n100\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.400\nthat we can take a look at\nwhat we have available, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.010\nYou'll notice that over here on\nthe left-hand side is really\n\n102\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.090\nsomething more like a spreadsheet, right?\n\n103\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.680\nA spreadsheet that gives us the ability\nto track the particular task and\n\n104\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.750\neven the duration of that task.\n\n105\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.280\nAnd that's normally the only information\nthat we're going to have to really change\n\n106\n00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.350\nand enter here, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.630\nAs you begin to track information and\nalso for start dates and\n\n108\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.090\nfinish dates, you really do not have\nto add in anything else in here, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.200\nSo notice that I've got all these dates\nfilled in right here in the center.\n\n110\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.990\nSo all of that looks good,\nokay, for right now.\n\n111\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.920\nAnd you might be wondering,\n\n112\n00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.760\nwow did you have to type in\nall of those different dates?\n\n113\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.600\nNow once I get everything set up and\nget used to being able to work with\n\n114\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.240\nMicrosoft Project, the only date that I\nneed to be concerned about right here\n\n115\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.750\nat the very beginning is the idea\nof what we call a start date.\n\n116\n00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.930\nNow you might be wondering why in\nthe world do I need a start date.\n\n117\n00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.160\nWell, because once I have the start date,\neverything else fills in.\n\n118\n00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.570\nSo normally what happens on a project\nis I really just enter in a start date,\n\n119\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.890\nand then I start actually creating these\ntasks which I would normally do in\n\n120\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.350\nan excel spreadsheet, and\nI simply start adding in durations, and\n\n121\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.600\nit starts working it out for me,\nokay, is what ends up happening here.\n\n122\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.930\nSo let me show you what\ncan happen in this sense.\n\n123\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.450\nSo right now I've got this particular\nproject starting Thursday the third\n\n124\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.490\non 2016 which is actually the recording\ndate that you are seeing right here.\n\n125\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.800\nNow, what if you go Ronnie, that's silly,\nwhy in the world would you start a project\n\n126\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.940\nwhen you really only have today and\ntomorrow really to have a good full week?\n\n127\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.900\nWhy don't you start it\nin the following week?\n\n128\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.400\nI finally go, hey Cherokee that\nis a great idea you're right!\n\n129\n00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.270\nWe shouldn't start it\nat the end of the week.\n\n130\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.060\nWe should've started at\nthe beginning of the week.\n\n131\n00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.310\nBut I've got, let's say,\nsix task or no, yeah.\n\n132\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.450\nTask six,\nI was trying to make sure I counted right.\n\n133\n00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.050\nSix tasks that already look like\nthat they've been what started?\n\n134\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.940\nAnd what does they are actually\nscheduled to finish.\n\n135\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.650\nSo if I were doing this manually,\nI mean I would have to go back and\n\n136\n00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.630\ndo what at this point which is to actually\nmanually change every single date.\n\n137\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.160\nBut with something like Microsoft Project\n\n138\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.350\nwhat I can do is I can click\nover here on information.\n\n139\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.990\nAnd then I can change the start date,\nlet's say to the 7th.\n\n140\n00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.819\nWhich is Monday,\n\n141\n00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:49.262\nthe following Monday after the recording\ndate that you're seeing here.\n\n142\n00:07:49.262 --> 00:07:53.402\nAnd then I can click OK, and\nnow you start to see what\n\n143\n00:07:53.402 --> 00:07:58.023\nhappened now is that it changed\nthe actual date here, but\n\n144\n00:07:58.023 --> 00:08:02.665\nnotice And also changed all\nof these other dates as well.\n\n145\n00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:05.930\nAnd it tells me at this particular point,\nfrom what I've done,\n\n146\n00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.720\nI haven't actually attached this\nparticular task down here yet.\n\n147\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.550\nThese are actually older dates here.\n\n148\n00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.610\nBut you can see now where this project\nnow, at least through task number five,\n\n149\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.130\nis scheduled to end on\nthe 24th of November, okay.\n\n150\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.980\nSo I didn't have to change anything and\n\n151\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.910\nthat's why these project management\nsystems are actually great.\n\n152\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.490\nBecause it's tracking every\nminute change that I make and\n\n153\n00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.310\nit's actually affecting the entire\nproject calendar for me.\n\n154\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.680\nNow along with this when I\nschedule my predecessors and\n\n155\n00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.130\nI have all the information here,\nit actually allows me to go ahead and\n\n156\n00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.080\nlink them together in the way that\nyou see the information here.\n\n157\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.570\nAnd that's how they know,\nwhat date to actually do this on\n\n158\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.580\nbased on whether it's a finish to start or\nstart to start type of relationship.\n\n159\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.330\n&gt;&gt; Pretty efficient.\n\n160\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.530\n&gt;&gt; It is very efficient.\n\n161\n00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.370\nNow, once we have that you might be going,\nwell what about resources?\n\n162\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.380\nWho is going to be\nworking on this project?\n\n163\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.800\nWhy I can click on the Resource tab and\nthen at this particular point here,\n\n164\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.780\nI can go to, let me sure I am showing\nyou right here, Assign Resources.\n\n165\n00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.790\nNow if I had I need to go in to my\nresources pool is what I need to do is\n\n166\n00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.660\ngo ahead be able to create one of this.\n\n167\n00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.590\nLet me see if I can actually do that.\n\n168\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.380\nHere, so I go to View, and\nthen select Resource Sheet.\n\n169\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.310\nAnd let's say right here,\n\n170\n00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.410\nI'm gonna add in Cherokee since was\npicking on me a little bit earlier.\n\n171\n00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.125\nI'm gonna add in Cherokee.\n\n172\n00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:30.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As a resource here and\n\n173\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.830\nfor her, there's a difference.\n\n174\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.870\nAnd you can see, that even does\nthis particular detail here.\n\n175\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.150\nWhether it's a Work resource, or\nMaterial resource, or a Cost resource.\n\n176\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.950\nThe work resource, is something that you\ngenerally pay on an hourly basis in other\n\n177\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.150\nwords, it's gonna be\na recurring cost here.\n\n178\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.862\nA material resource,\nis something that is consumable,\n\n179\n00:09:49.862 --> 00:09:53.714\nyou tend to buy a certain amount and it's\nused up throughout the project itself.\n\n180\n00:09:53.714 --> 00:09:57.606\nAnd of course cost resources, essentially\nwhat you paid for something and\n\n181\n00:09:57.606 --> 00:10:02.008\nyou don't actually do anything else but\nthis is actually a one time payment, okay.\n\n182\n00:10:02.008 --> 00:10:05.691\nThen once you actually choose that\nat this particular point here,\n\n183\n00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:10.294\nyou can go ahead and actually assign, how\nmuch that particular resource cost you to\n\n184\n00:10:10.294 --> 00:10:13.974\nuse on that project and\nthen you can even say, how it's pro rated,\n\n185\n00:10:13.974 --> 00:10:17.096\nwhether it's cost per use or\nwhatever it might be here.\n\n186\n00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:23.943\nSo if I add that in and\nthen let's say, I go ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:23.943 --> 00:10:30.793\nwe add in Mike Rodrick one\nof our other hosts here and\n\n188\n00:10:30.793 --> 00:10:36.549\nDaniel Lowrie and Wes Bryan and Don Pezet.\n\n189\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.460\nAnd I'm just leaving them\nat their default okay, so\n\n190\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.360\nI can add all of those in as my resources.\n\n191\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.650\nNow, I can go back to\n\n192\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.360\nthe original view here if I can,\nagain chart view and\n\n193\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.710\nthen I can actually assign resources to\neach one of these tasks easily, okay.\n\n194\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.450\nSo notice at this point,I\ncan simply assign them okay.\n\n195\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.160\nAnd so I can actually check off whose\nactually gonna be working on that\n\n196\n00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.020\nparticular task.\n\n197\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.240\nAnd as long as I don't\nover allocate them for\n\n198\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.790\nthat week,\nwe can actually start doing that.\n\n199\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.100\nAnd so, now I have one particular\nlocation where I'm keeping track\n\n200\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.100\nof not only my resources but\nthe time involved.\n\n201\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.890\nAnd if I also filled out that other\ninformation where it talked about\n\n202\n00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.180\nthe cost, usage, the hourly pay rate or\n\n203\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.780\nwhatever it might be,\nit keeps track of the cost for me.\n\n204\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.290\nAnd also one of the greatest\nthings about Microsoft Project\n\n205\n00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.990\nis the detailed reports that we\ncan get from project itself.\n\n206\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.540\nSo, it is an advantage for\nyou to be able to take advantage and for\n\n207\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.340\nyou to use something like a project\nmanagement information tool.\n\n208\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.950\nAnd I wouldn't overlook it, even though\nit takes a little bit of time for\n\n209\n00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.540\nyou to kind of get used to\nusing software like this,\n\n210\n00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.710\nit is worth the time and\nthe effort for you to do so.\n\n211\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.370\nAnd if you do have the time and\neffort and you go, hey I want to do that.\n\n212\n00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:05.300\nRemember, we actually do have in our\ncourse library and actual course on or\n\n213\n00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.150\nan actual show, on Microsoft Project\nthat can help you get started.\n\n214\n00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.890\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n215\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.990\n&gt;&gt; So it's something that we\nreally can help you be able to do.\n\n216\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.360\nBut it's something you shouldn't\noverlook just because you go, man,\n\n217\n00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.180\nthat's a lot of detail.\n\n218\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.330\n&gt;&gt; I've never used it before.\n\n219\n00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n220\n00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.580\nIt takes a bit of time for\nyou to get used to it, but overall though,\n\n221\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.620\nonce you actually get used to it,\nit's a great product.\n\n222\n00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.300\nIt can really help you attract so\n\n223\n00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.220\nmuch stuff, especially when\nyou're working on a project.\n\n224\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.550\nAnd once you have the foundation here,\n\n225\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:36.140\nit's easier then if you move on to\na gigantic product like Primavera or\n\n226\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.440\nTimberlawn and\nthere's some other ones out there.\n\n227\n00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.560\nAnd, it's not going to\nbe exactly a match for\n\n228\n00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.290\nmatch but\nyou'll kind of learn the concepts here and\n\n229\n00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.470\nit'll actually be great,\nas you move through different industries,\n\n230\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.570\ninto different project management\ntools that are available to them.\n\n231\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.180\nSo always take advantage of the tools that\nyou have available, you may have to have\n\n232\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.980\ntraining on it and that's where it may\nbe a little bit of a disadvantage for\n\n233\n00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.920\nyou at the very beginning,\ncuz you're kind of behind the curve.\n\n234\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.730\nIf somebody says, all right Cherokee,\nyou're the project man,\n\n235\n00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.330\nyou go, I've never done that before.\n\n236\n00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.390\nThat's simple, just pull up\nthe project in Microsoft Project.\n\n237\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.890\nOkay, what does that do?\n\n238\n00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.980\nExactly, there's a lot behind it.\n\n239\n00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.960\nBut it is worth the time and\neffort for you to get to learn, so\n\n240\n00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.190\nI would choose something like this and\nactually play around with it and\n\n241\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.224\nunderstand all of the powerful features\nbehind it, really a great idea, okay.\n\n242\n00:13:23.224 --> 00:13:24.441\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n243\n00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:25.683\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n244\n00:13:25.683 --> 00:13:29.100\nSo, taking that in account and\nsome of the other things here, but\n\n245\n00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.790\nlet's go ahead and take a look at\nthe idea of what else that we need, okay.\n\n246\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.880\nNormally, inside of a project,\n\n247\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.000\nyou also of course have what we call\ncharts that we have to deal with, okay.\n\n248\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.420\nSo over here on the right hand side\nof what we're taking a look at here,\n\n249\n00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:48.060\nI'm kind of trying to get all of these\nthings kind of lined up for us, so\n\n250\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.330\nthat we can see them a little bit better,\nexcept for this.\n\n251\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.620\nI've got to kind of put this,\nget rid of this.\n\n252\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.050\nHere, see if that actually lets me do it,\nof course it doesn't.\n\n253\n00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:04.080\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, with Microsoft products and\nthe integration with the different types\n\n254\n00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.180\nof products that they have,\nif you did make a change or notification.\n\n255\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.550\nIs this piece of software\nintuitive enough to go ahead and\n\n256\n00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.500\nsend out those automated emails\nto let alert individuals,\n\n257\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.690\nif you have Office 365 or\nsomething like that set up?\n\n258\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes and no, okay.\n\n259\n00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.320\nSo, in terms of Microsoft Project\nthere is something that's\n\n260\n00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.080\ncalled a Microsoft Project server that\nallows for things like that to happen but\n\n261\n00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.940\nnow you're talking about a different\nlevel of connecting project together.\n\n262\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.790\nWorking as a stand alone\napplication not by itself but\n\n263\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.360\nworking in conjunction, they do call\nit the Microsoft Project Server.\n\n264\n00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.370\nIt absolutely can give you that ability\nthat you're looking to take a look\n\n265\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.630\nat there.\n\n266\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.760\nI'm trying to make sure that we can\nactually see the Gantt chart here for\n\n267\n00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.960\njust a moment of course,\n\n268\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.610\nthis completely slid off my screen now,\nhave to view and find it.\n\n269\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.640\nThere it goes, so\n\n270\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.000\nthis is not the most exciting\nparticular Gantt chart that we'll see.\n\n271\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.480\nI was hoping to zoom in just a little bit,\nbut every time,\n\n272\n00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.770\nthere we go, that'll make it work.\n\n273\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.270\nAll right, so that's it, okay.\n\n274\n00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:09.160\nSo as we take a look at this, here's one\nof the charts that gives us a graphical\n\n275\n00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:14.230\ndisplay, okay of some of the information\nthat we're normally looking for,\n\n276\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.700\nin terms of the way that we can manage\nprojects and their particular track and\n\n277\n00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.030\ntask of doing things, okay.\n\n278\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.590\nThis is what is called a Gantt chart,\nnamed after a guy named Henry Gantt.\n\n279\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.380\nAnd he is pretty much,\n\n280\n00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.740\none of the guys that's revered in terms\nof the way that things are actually done.\n\n281\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.070\nSo it was named in honor of him.\n\n282\n00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.850\nAnd the way that he actually shows us,\nright, is their dependencies as well as\n\n283\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:43.320\nthe overall duration of the task itself in\nrelationship to all the other ones, okay.\n\n284\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.204\nSo this way you can work out,\njust a graphical timeline and\n\n285\n00:15:47.204 --> 00:15:51.733\nnotice that this is actually\ndisplayed on a time scale here, okay.\n\n286\n00:15:51.733 --> 00:15:56.248\nRight at the top there's a calendar across\nthe top here that gives you that five day\n\n287\n00:15:56.248 --> 00:15:59.141\nwork week and\nhere this first task if I hover over it.\n\n288\n00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:02.650\nIt shows me that this is a task\nthat lasts two days in duration.\n\n289\n00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.750\nIt tells me the start date and\nthe finish date.\n\n290\n00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.520\nAnd remember that if you're not used\nto looking at the way that project\n\n291\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.070\nmanagement looks at.\n\n292\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.460\nCherokee, the task starts on Monday.\n\n293\n00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.740\nOkay?\nBut finishes on Tuesday And\n\n294\n00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.380\nall of us are thinking,\nthat's just one day.\n\n295\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.070\nOkay.\n\n296\n00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.750\nBut if you remember,\nwe've did go through another episode,\n\n297\n00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.070\ncalling the critical path.\n\n298\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:24.580\n&gt;&gt; Powers.\n\n299\n00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so, yeah,\neach one is what we consider a work day.\n\n300\n00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.960\nSo, Monday, as she worked the full day,\nand Tuesday you worked the full day.\n\n301\n00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.920\nAnd that's why this is\nconsidered a two day task,\n\n302\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.760\ngiven though the majority were not\nin the project management world.\n\n303\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.630\nWe're like no, that's one day, Ronnie.\n\n304\n00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.380\nMonday to Tuesday is one day, but\n\n305\n00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.560\noverall though in project\nmanagement it is not that way.\n\n306\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.690\nSo it gives you a nice\nlittle graphical display and\n\n307\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.360\nthen you see this arrow\nthat you see right here.\n\n308\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.560\nHopefully you can see that right there.\n\n309\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.970\nSo once you actually see\nthat particular arrow\n\n310\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:03.140\nIt actually lets you know that this\none is a finish-to-start relationship.\n\n311\n00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.450\nAnd that is because the arrow actually\nhappens on the finish side of that\n\n312\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:11.560\nblue bar which is the task and then it\nactually goes into what, the start side.\n\n313\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.570\nSo that's how you know that this is\na finish-to-start relationship and\n\n314\n00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.310\nthe same thing continues\nto go through here too.\n\n315\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.810\nNow the other things that we've also\nmentioned along our particular journey\n\n316\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:27.560\ntogether in terms of Project Plus,\nis we talked about a milestone, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.640\nNow this right here is actually what\nwe consider a milestone as well, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.590\nA milestone is a black diamond\nin terms of the Gantt chart on\n\n319\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.881\nthe way that Microsoft Project\nsignals it and\n\n320\n00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:40.950\nyou actually notice something\nstrange about this.\n\n321\n00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:45.160\nNotice it does have a task finish date but\nnothing starting there.\n\n322\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.830\nThat lets you know that this particular\ntask has no duration in mind,\n\n323\n00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:56.750\nit is just a marker along the pathway that\nthis what day, that those two tasks were,\n\n324\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.510\nor at least task number one was\nsuppose to finish on, okay.\n\n325\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.670\nSo if this particular task may have\nactually been late because of something,\n\n326\n00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.490\nwe could have actually had a decision for\n\n327\n00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.160\na no go if we actually\nwanted to at this point.\n\n328\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.520\nSo it was something I was\njust inserted in here and\n\n329\n00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.900\nit generally does not effect\nthe overall project nature.\n\n330\n00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.270\nIn other words, it's not gonna effect\nthe project schedule at all, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.880\nSo, again,\n\n332\n00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.320\nchart is one of those charts that we do\nhave available to us to help us out, and\n\n333\n00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.300\nthe more that you see these things, the\nmore detailed that they get, the more in\n\n334\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.990\ndepth that they also go as well,\nas you have your project filling out.\n\n335\n00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:39.000\nAnd that's what you're hoping to see Is\nthat any place a long line this is gonna\n\n336\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.910\ngive you the graphic that\nyou need to build and\n\n337\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.720\nsee the project from\nthe beginning to the end.\n\n338\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.630\nAnd what you're looking for\nand there are course\n\n339\n00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.380\nour places that you can change to help\nmake your project a bit more efficient or\n\n340\n00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.770\nactually make it do what you\nwant to do as well okay.\n\n341\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.790\nSo here's one of the charts that you\nmight see that's available, okay.\n\n342\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.180\nNow the other ones that you\nmight also end up seeing\n\n343\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.870\nis something like what we call\na Pareto chart as well, okay.\n\n344\n00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:11.570\nNow Pareto charts, instead of looking\nat the overall duration of our project,\n\n345\n00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.640\nwhich a Gantt chart helps us to do.\n\n346\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.110\nAnd helps us to see a lot\nmore information that.\n\n347\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:21.320\nPareto analysis and Pareto charts\nreally help us to essentially find\n\n348\n00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.010\nout the idea of where errors or\n\n349\n00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.520\nsome type of defects in the pathening\nespecially in manufacturing, okay.\n\n350\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.890\nSo let me show you what did\nthe end result is, okay.\n\n351\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.230\nSo this is what is\nconsidered a Pareto diagram.\n\n352\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.780\nLet me zoom in just a little bit.\n\n353\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.910\nSo, let me go back here,\nI'm not going back so much.\n\n354\n00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.820\n&gt;&gt; What are we looking at here,\nI don't have glasses on, Ronnie.\n\n355\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what we're actually\nlooking at here is actually a bunch of\n\n356\n00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.440\ndifferent things that can cause\nour problems that we're having.\n\n357\n00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.430\nErrors in nature in terms of our website,\nwhat we're taking a look at here.\n\n358\n00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.701\nYeah, website errors is what I have, okay?\n\n359\n00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:57.784\nSo each one of these bars here\nrepresents a potential error,\n\n360\n00:19:57.784 --> 00:20:00.755\neach one of these bars here\nrepresents a potential error.\n\n361\n00:20:00.755 --> 00:20:05.378\nAnd what we're taking looking at\nhere broken lines, spelling errors,\n\n362\n00:20:05.378 --> 00:20:10.160\nmissing title tags you name it\nthere's a ton of them that goes on.\n\n363\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.410\nSo once you count up every single\nerror that you have available,\n\n364\n00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.170\nyou also want to divide it up\ninto a particular category.\n\n365\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.940\nAnd count them all up, and\nverify that they do reach 100%.\n\n366\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.650\nIn other words, do a counter for\nevery single error.\n\n367\n00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.680\nSo here,\n\n368\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.010\nnotice that we've had this particular\nbar over here on the left hand side.\n\n369\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:37.900\nWe've had about 349 of those errors,\nof those links that we have.\n\n370\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:44.520\nNot 349, excuse me, we actually had,\nhold on, about, no,\n\n371\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.330\nthat is 349,\nactually not all the way up there, yeah.\n\n372\n00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.100\nSo it's actually not that many.\n\n373\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.680\nThis is actually about\na little bit less than that.\n\n374\n00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.200\nBecause it's actually\na cumulative count and\n\n375\n00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.680\nI was trying to make sure\nI showed you this, okay.\n\n376\n00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:04.310\nSo actually it is 349, I'm counting\nbackward is what I'm doing so 349.\n\n377\n00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:08.340\nAnd so at this particular point when you\nstart adding up all the errors that we had\n\n378\n00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.124\nwhich is about 799.\n\n379\n00:21:11.124 --> 00:21:17.840\nAbout 43.7% of the errors on our websites\nwere pretty much broken links, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So you can actually divide that up and\n\n381\n00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:24.970\nthat way you know exactly what needs to\nbe priorities as you need to go back and\n\n382\n00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.430\nprovide some corrective error.\n\n383\n00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.250\nYou might actually end up seeing that.\n\n384\n00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.080\nThat at that point was what you had there.\n\n385\n00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.560\nThen as you continue to go on spelling,\nif you actually add in broken links and\n\n386\n00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.040\nspelling that actually accounts for 64.8%.\n\n387\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.890\nAs you add in missing title and\ntag, It tells you,\n\n388\n00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.260\nhere it is, here again it's a cumulative.\n\n389\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.410\nNow I didn't break it down into\nevery single, I could have said,\n\n390\n00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.530\npercentage of the whole, but remember\nI have the cumulative percentage here,\n\n391\n00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.280\nwhich means every time you go down,\nyou actually add that up and\n\n392\n00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.560\nthat shows you how much it actually gets-\n&gt;&gt; Your running total.\n\n393\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.070\n&gt;&gt; Yep, to the time when you can\nactually see all those errors.\n\n394\n00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:06.480\nOkay, so that is one possibility\nthat actually helps you out\n\n395\n00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.100\nbecause you don't know if\nyou're actually accounting for\n\n396\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.350\nevery error until you\nactually add them all up.\n\n397\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:14.600\nThe other one here is normally\nin a manufacturing process so\n\n398\n00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.720\nthat you can spot trends\nin errors once again.\n\n399\n00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.700\nSame thing so\nhere I have wrong tint on the actual blue\n\n400\n00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.380\njeans in terms of manufacturing,\ncrooked back pockets.\n\n401\n00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:25.898\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:22:25.898 --> 00:22:29.090\n&gt;&gt; Stitching defects, defective zippers,\n\n403\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.395\nmissing the brand tag itself,\n\n404\n00:22:31.395 --> 00:22:36.690\nfront pocket liner unfinished,\nbelt loops too close together.\n\n405\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:42.340\nMissing back belt loops,\nmissing size tags, whatever it might be\n\n406\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:47.260\nthis is where you again can chart all\nof that information and then verify it.\n\n407\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.330\nThis line actually verifies that.\n\n408\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.850\nAs you start to take a look at some point\nit hits that critical mass that you know\n\n409\n00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.900\nI need to do something.\n\n410\n00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.000\nSo where do you spend most of\nyour time in fixing things.\n\n411\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.360\nAs you start to see the line here,\nyou might choose like 50% of my errors.\n\n412\n00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:09.368\nSo here on the right side, let me see if\nI can show you this on the right side.\n\n413\n00:23:09.368 --> 00:23:14.040\nSo at 50% of my errors, what I can do is\ncome over here and say, all right, so\n\n414\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.290\nright here.\n\n415\n00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.080\nI would start at defective zippers.\n\n416\n00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.430\nNow you might be wondering what's the idea\nbehind the term Pareto though, okay.\n\n417\n00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.630\nThere is something called\nthe Pareto principle.\n\n418\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.095\nNow, Cherokee,\nhave you heard of the Pareto principle?\n\n419\n00:23:27.095 --> 00:23:29.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sure I have,\nI just can't recall at this time.\n\n420\n00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.350\n&gt;&gt; No, that's fine\n&gt;&gt; I actually was hoping to stump you.\n\n421\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n422\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:34.922\nthe Pareto-\n&gt;&gt; Success.\n\n423\n00:23:34.922 --> 00:23:36.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n424\n00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.580\nthe Pareto principle simply says\nthis in a couple of different ways.\n\n425\n00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.060\nThe way I learned it is about work,\nin a workplace.\n\n426\n00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:47.440\nThe Pareto principle says 80% of the work\nis normally done by 20% of the people.\n\n427\n00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.150\n&gt;&gt; I do remember.\n\n428\n00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.479\nHis name is.\n\n429\n00:23:49.479 --> 00:23:50.010\n&gt;&gt; Pareto?\n\n430\n00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:51.419\n&gt;&gt; Wilfredo Pareto.\n\n431\n00:23:51.419 --> 00:23:52.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay and\n\n432\n00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.360\nhe is from a very small Italian village.\n\n433\n00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.650\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And he was able to recognize that 80%\n\n434\n00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.050\nof that land was owned by 20% of the,\nI do remember.\n\n435\n00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see.\n&gt;&gt; And that rule still applies in so\n\n436\n00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:04.905\nmany aspects of our life today.\n\n437\n00:24:04.905 --> 00:24:06.329\nI don't know why didn't\nthink of that at the time.\n\n438\n00:24:06.329 --> 00:24:07.145\nBut yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n439\n00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:09.712\nIt's probably cuz I didn't use the word.\n\n440\n00:24:09.712 --> 00:24:12.960\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say that's his name,\nyeah, I wanna make sure but.\n\n441\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That just sounds good to me,\nbut you might be wondering why, so\n\n442\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.740\nwhy is this important?\n\n443\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.680\nWell if we instead take that\nidea of those percentages.\n\n444\n00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.228\nThat 80, 20 percentage,\nwhat they're saying is that,\n\n445\n00:24:24.228 --> 00:24:29.920\nthat normally 80% of our errors,\nare really caused by 20% of our tasks.\n\n446\n00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.350\nSo, at this point then,\nwhen you take 80% of the errors, so\n\n447\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.340\nright here is my 80% mark.\n\n448\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.170\nAt least, I think it is.\n\n449\n00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.060\nI can't do it when I'm zoomed out.\n\n450\n00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.520\nLet me see if I can try this again.\n\n451\n00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.330\nOkay, so right here is my 80% mark.\n\n452\n00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:50.750\nAnd then if I go all the way over to\nright about 80%, which is right here.\n\n453\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.670\nNotice that out of the tasks\nthat I have available to me that\n\n454\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.410\nreally means that I need to spend\nthe majority of my time doing what?\n\n455\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:02.970\nFixing wrong indigo tint,\ncrooked back pockets, stitching defects.\n\n456\n00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.920\nNow, what about all the other ones?\n\n457\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.790\nWell, don't get me wrong.\n\n458\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.450\nThose need to be fixed too.\n\n459\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.350\nBut in terms of the majority of\nwhat I need to spend time in.\n\n460\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.490\nIt's going to be really about 20%.\n\n461\n00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Focus your efforts\non those larger errors.\n\n462\n00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.410\n&gt;&gt; So that's where the Pareto Analysis or\n\n463\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.900\nPereto Charts really help us out\nin trying to figure this out.\n\n464\n00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.810\nPareto, Parato.\n\n465\n00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nPareto, Parato, you know.\n\n466\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.323\nLet's call the whole thing off.\n\n467\n00:25:26.681 --> 00:25:30.060\nOkay.\nNow I do have, I thought I did.\n\n468\n00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:34.650\nI'm probably gonna give somebody\nsea sickness here in a moment.\n\n469\n00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.470\nNow, I went ahead, I was trying\nto show this a little bit easier,\n\n470\n00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.180\nbut my chart was not as accurate as-\n&gt;&gt; I like all your colors, Ronnie.\n\n471\n00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you, you.\n\n472\n00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.228\n&gt;&gt; Another great thing about these graphs\nis you're not just looking at all that\n\n473\n00:25:47.228 --> 00:25:47.764\nraw data.\n\n474\n00:25:47.764 --> 00:25:51.482\nYou can take these graphs to your, that's\nwhy we have so many available to us.\n\n475\n00:25:51.482 --> 00:25:55.818\nIt's so easy to take them to your\nmeetings, your presentations and\n\n476\n00:25:55.818 --> 00:25:59.280\nput that information to\nconvey your ideas or easily.\n\n477\n00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.726\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so using this thing, right, so\nit's the same one as same information.\n\n478\n00:26:03.726 --> 00:26:04.518\n&gt;&gt; Same information.\n\n479\n00:26:04.518 --> 00:26:07.320\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; I just tried to make it happen a little\n\n480\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.450\nbit more graphically with more colors and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n481\n00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Than what the Excel spreadsheet.\n\n482\n00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.760\nThe Excel spreadsheet don't get me wrong.\n\n483\n00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.160\nThe nice thing about it is I\njust had to enter in numbers and\n\n484\n00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.650\nit gave me the chart\nthe way that I wanted to.\n\n485\n00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:21.155\nHere I summarized it a little bit more and\njust changed the numbers up.\n\n486\n00:26:21.155 --> 00:26:25.248\nSo once again it's at 80% and that 20% and\nyou'll notice something here.\n\n487\n00:26:25.248 --> 00:26:29.951\nRight at 80% again if I go across you'll\nsee it actually does split like the back\n\n488\n00:26:29.951 --> 00:26:30.810\npocket here.\n\n489\n00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:34.090\nIt actually is saying that if we were to\n\n490\n00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:38.730\nwork on our defects here,\nthis is pretty much it.\n\n491\n00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.950\nThese 20% would be the ones to have\neven though there is actually more and\n\n492\n00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.070\nI also did the same thing here.\n\n493\n00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.880\nThis one was based on product\ndeliver failures instead.\n\n494\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.115\nWhy are they actually failing?\n\n495\n00:26:49.115 --> 00:26:50.930\nThere it is [INAUDIBLE] failures.\n\n496\n00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:55.050\nI go to the 80% mark once I\nactually have that curve drawn up.\n\n497\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.444\nAnd we need that cumulative number so\nthat we can get that 100%.\n\n498\n00:26:58.444 --> 00:27:01.868\nOnce I draw that on\neach one of these here.\n\n499\n00:27:01.868 --> 00:27:04.960\nAnd it is actually\na cumulative add up here.\n\n500\n00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.140\nI go all the way over here and I start\nrealizing, well wrong address missing and\n\n501\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:09.885\nno signature.\n\n502\n00:27:09.885 --> 00:27:14.060\nThat's pretty much about it or if I was\nto really probably do this correctly\n\n503\n00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.450\nit's probably only these two over here\nthat I really have to spend time and\n\n504\n00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.340\nactual work on very hard.\n\n505\n00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.490\nUsing something like the Pareto Analysis\nreally does help you to know where\n\n506\n00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.910\nto focus the information.\n\n507\n00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:29.310\nUsing a gantt chart again helps you to\nunderstand at least the very basics,\n\n508\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.990\nof understanding the time aspect\nof it in a very graphical nature.\n\n509\n00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.690\nNow, we got a couple more of these I\nwant us to also take a look at it,\n\n510\n00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.340\nwhich is the idea of what we\ncall an Ishikawa diagram.\n\n511\n00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.130\nAll right Cherokee.\n\n512\n00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.430\nLet me see if I've\nstumped you on this one.\n\n513\n00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:47.175\n&gt;&gt; You have.\n\n514\n00:27:47.175 --> 00:27:50.864\n[CROSSTALK] I might have heard it before\nbecause I have gone through this training,\n\n515\n00:27:50.864 --> 00:27:53.228\nbut there's only so\nmuch room in the brain at times.\n\n516\n00:27:53.228 --> 00:27:53.863\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n517\n00:27:53.863 --> 00:27:57.217\nYeah.\nYou might have heard of it's actual alias\n\n518\n00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:58.600\nas said fishbone.\n\n519\n00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n520\n00:27:59.140 --> 00:27:59.760\nI do remember.\n\n521\n00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.056\nI know fishbone.\n\n522\n00:28:01.056 --> 00:28:01.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n523\n00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.959\n&gt;&gt; So fishbone diagrams and diagrams,\n\n524\n00:28:04.959 --> 00:28:07.880\nthis is actually a little bit different.\n\n525\n00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.690\nThis type of diagram normally can help you\ndetermine what we call a cause and effect.\n\n526\n00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.490\nHey, look at that, cause and\neffect is what we have.\n\n527\n00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:20.690\nNow you might be wondering like,\nokay why is that considered a fishbone?\n\n528\n00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.680\nWell normally you have of course,\nwhat the problem is.\n\n529\n00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.990\nAnd what are you trying to do?\n\n530\n00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.310\nYou're trying to determine the cause.\n\n531\n00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.860\nSo noticed you have two columns\nas what we really have here.\n\n532\n00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.660\nWell in theory though the way\nthat they did this and\n\n533\n00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:39.090\nI don't know who came up with this idea\nbut it really kinda happens like this.\n\n534\n00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.790\nSo I'm trying to draw another line here.\n\n535\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.360\nGreat thing is this tool help\nme to appoint that's not a line.\n\n536\n00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.150\nThat's kind of almost a line.\n\n537\n00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:46.812\n&gt;&gt; Zigzag.\n\n538\n00:28:46.812 --> 00:28:48.361\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a little bit\nmore zigzag-y than I wanted it.\n\n539\n00:28:48.361 --> 00:28:50.430\nLet me do that again.\n\n540\n00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.220\nThat's terrible Ronnie.\n\n541\n00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.480\nSo let me try and\ndo this one more time here.\n\n542\n00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.090\nA little bit more.\n\n543\n00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.120\nLet's do that.\n\n544\n00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.820\nThere we go, and that's actually easier.\n\n545\n00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:08.668\nLet me duplicate that line, and I will\nshow you why this actually works here.\n\n546\n00:29:08.668 --> 00:29:11.150\nAll right, so, normally for\n\n547\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:16.020\nus when we start to work with things what\nyou're gonna end up finding out though.\n\n548\n00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.970\nIs that you're gonna find out\nthat there is really one cause\n\n549\n00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.970\nto all the problem that you have.\n\n550\n00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:24.190\nAnd what we wanna do is we wanna\nfill in this side with causes but\n\n551\n00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:27.330\nin a kind of very mapped out way.\n\n552\n00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.770\nIt's not an outline type of idea, but\n\n553\n00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.950\nwhat we're gonna see is\nsomething a little bit unusual.\n\n554\n00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:37.400\nAs we start filling things out if I\ncan actually do this correctly here.\n\n555\n00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we might even be using this\nin a meeting if we were trying to\n\n556\n00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.320\nfind the root cause of a problem or\nhelp just troubleshoot things.\n\n557\n00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.400\nWe might ask in our team members and\nstart having them brainstorm and\n\n558\n00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.630\ngive out potential causes.\n\n559\n00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.160\nRight Ronnie?\n\n560\n00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's exactly it.\n\n561\n00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:56.230\nWhat normally ends up happening is\nthat you end up seeing something like\n\n562\n00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:00.580\nthis in terms of the way that\nthe diagram ends up developing.\n\n563\n00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.060\nSo hopefully you can see my fish.\n\n564\n00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.760\nCan you see my fish there?\n\n565\n00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.390\n&gt;&gt; I can.\n\n566\n00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you start seeing,\nwait, hold on.\n\n567\n00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:07.630\n&gt;&gt; It's in black though, okay.\n\n568\n00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.310\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't help, does it?\n\n569\n00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.560\nYeah, that's me.\n\n570\n00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.910\nSorry for those that are watching us.\n\n571\n00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.770\nRight here live, but here it is.\n\n572\n00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:14.270\nOkay, so-.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n573\n00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:14.809\n&gt;&gt; So hopefully\n\n574\n00:30:14.809 --> 00:30:16.915\nthat makes a little bit more sense.\n&gt;&gt; It's Nemo.\n\n575\n00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:18.445\n&gt;&gt; Now that doesn't look like-.\n\n576\n00:30:18.445 --> 00:30:19.165\n&gt;&gt; Dori.\n\n577\n00:30:19.165 --> 00:30:21.810\n&gt;&gt; What I think here but let me show you.\n\n578\n00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.100\nSo here's how it normally breaks down.\n\n579\n00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.860\nIs that what you start to do\nis you start breaking down\n\n580\n00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.940\nthe idea of what causes these\nproblems in the major groupings.\n\n581\n00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:31.480\nSo here it is.\n\n582\n00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.000\nCould it be a material resource,\na process?\n\n583\n00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.825\nIs it actually my workers or\nmy team members, or is it the hardware?\n\n584\n00:30:39.825 --> 00:30:40.326\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n585\n00:30:40.326 --> 00:30:41.078\nyou've got to branch off from there.\n\n586\n00:30:41.078 --> 00:30:41.591\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n587\n00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:43.444\nAnd then so each one of these,\n\n588\n00:30:43.444 --> 00:30:47.430\nthen has a connect into giving\nus that overall problem.\n\n589\n00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.400\nIt's at that point you might start adding\nin what the little tiny fishbones.\n\n590\n00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.250\nSo here we actually have the large bone,\nthe kind of dorsal bones here.\n\n591\n00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:00.140\nAnd then you now have the missed steps\nthat might have happened in the process.\n\n592\n00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.810\nThe wrong order, in other words,\nthe sequence of things.\n\n593\n00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.700\nMaterials they may have actually been\nsub standard that we've added in.\n\n594\n00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.870\nWorkers may not have been properly\ntrained or they weren't available.\n\n595\n00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.140\nIn terms of the hardware,\nwe ordered the wrong buttons.\n\n596\n00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.210\nOr some of them were actually damaged.\n\n597\n00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:20.490\nSo at this point when you take a look,\nit starts to look like a fishbone, right?\n\n598\n00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.730\nIf you've ever eaten fish and\n\n599\n00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.260\nyou left the bone there, that's the idea\nbehind using something like this.\n\n600\n00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.370\nTo help determine the cause and effect.\n\n601\n00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.740\nSo when you add just those three\ncharts in cuz we're running low on\n\n602\n00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.210\ntime at this point.\n\n603\n00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.420\nWe need to take a look at one more and\nthen we'll kind of end this and show you.\n\n604\n00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.090\nBut when you start seeing those right you\nnow have something for cause and effect.\n\n605\n00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.940\nYou can now figure out like how\nmuch resource to I spend on\n\n606\n00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.190\nthe number of tasks that I\nreally need to accomplish.\n\n607\n00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.760\nAnd then also with the gantt chart you\nstart seeing where it really helps you\n\n608\n00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:59.360\ndetermine the duration of your\nproject with a very graphical way too.\n\n609\n00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:04.000\nNow the last one we're going to look at\nvery briefly here is what's called a run\n\n610\n00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.505\nchart.\n\n611\n00:32:04.505 --> 00:32:07.472\nNow a run chart,\nlet me see if I can scroll that up so\n\n612\n00:32:07.472 --> 00:32:11.150\nwe can see the whole thing just\nabout here So we've got time and\n\n613\n00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:16.520\nover on the left hand side let's say that\nwe have a temperature scale as well okay.\n\n614\n00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.290\nSo as you are doing something\nto test something out here okay,\n\n615\n00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.460\na run chart lets you know at five\nminutes where the temperature might have\n\n616\n00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.870\nactually gone up to.\n\n617\n00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.429\nTen minutes here during the warm up.\n\n618\n00:32:26.429 --> 00:32:29.110\nYou might have actually seen\nthat it started rising.\n\n619\n00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.980\nEight minutes or so but at ten minutes\nit actually went all the way up here.\n\n620\n00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.960\nAnd then it stayed here for the next 5\nminutes, and then at 20 minutes it kind of\n\n621\n00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.910\ndropped, rose a little bit, and\nkind of stabilized throughout here.\n\n622\n00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.390\n&gt;&gt; So it looks like by taking these\nsamples, would you use a 5 minute interval\n\n623\n00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:49.200\nhere, sample, and by plotting it out you\ncould also see any kind of outliers.\n\n624\n00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.078\nWe could go ahead and set thresholds.\n\n625\n00:32:51.078 --> 00:32:53.160\nSo that you could be used for\nthis one chart.\n\n626\n00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.970\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what they're used for\n\n627\n00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.870\nto help us determine\nthose thresholds as well.\n\n628\n00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.179\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now when you start actually doing this\n\n629\n00:32:59.179 --> 00:33:04.474\nover multiple different things that you're\ntesting, or different areas you're going\n\n630\n00:33:04.474 --> 00:33:09.560\nto, that kinda of really helps you also\nin the idea as a scatter as well, okay.\n\n631\n00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.180\nYou might find that every time\nwhatever the end result is,\n\n632\n00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.040\nlet's say at 30 minutes, you measure like\nfive different devices, and they're all\n\n633\n00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.470\nkinda hovering here around 128 Fahrenheit,\nokay, and that's your kinda mid point.\n\n634\n00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.060\nWell, then you actually start\nseeing the outliers too, though.\n\n635\n00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.263\nIf all of the sudden out of those five\nyou've got one that is always at the end\n\n636\n00:33:28.263 --> 00:33:32.602\nof that 5 minute run appear at a 192,\nbut everybody else is hovering right\n\n637\n00:33:32.602 --> 00:33:35.604\nhere at about 128, 130-\n&gt;&gt; But it will help you investigate-\n\n638\n00:33:35.604 --> 00:33:36.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n\n639\n00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:37.672\n&gt;&gt; That particular time frame.\n\n640\n00:33:37.672 --> 00:33:40.623\n&gt;&gt; It lets you know that at that\nparticular time frame that everything\n\n641\n00:33:40.623 --> 00:33:42.940\nlooks good except for one and\nis that one an outlier or\n\n642\n00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.800\nis it actually something that is gonna\nbe a problem in our product line okay.\n\n643\n00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.820\nSo you can even see things like that, so\nusing a run chart, using a scatter chart\n\n644\n00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.800\nit really does help you to also\nsee things like that as well and\n\n645\n00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.350\nto help you to determine\nthe processes too.\n\n646\n00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.580\nNow, if you think that that's all\nthere is to charts, there's not.\n\n647\n00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.177\nThere's also histograms,\n\n648\n00:34:02.177 --> 00:34:06.298\nthat can also show you that the same\nthing over time like the Pareto does and\n\n649\n00:34:06.298 --> 00:34:09.930\nit shows you where those issues\nare coming from as well.\n\n650\n00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:14.620\nProcess diagrams, if you really need to\ndo flow charts, those are also good for\n\n651\n00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.490\nyou as well.\n\n652\n00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:18.310\nSo just kinda realize that there's\na ton of different charts rhat can you\n\n653\n00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.800\nhelp graphically be able\nto see the information.\n\n654\n00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.244\nYou may wonder, why do I need\nto see all of that information?\n\n655\n00:34:23.244 --> 00:34:26.610\nWell, because you need to make\ndecisions and so do other people.\n\n656\n00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:30.540\nMost of the time just showing them a bunch\nof numbers on an Excel spreadsheet,\n\n657\n00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.950\nI'm not saying that it's not impressive.\n\n658\n00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:35.430\nIt is impressive when you start taking\nin how much data you are tracking but\n\n659\n00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:37.450\nit's a little bit difficult to interpret.\n\n660\n00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.550\nUsing charts and\n\n661\n00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:43.790\nlike what we've shown you here can help\nmake your point much more effectively.\n\n662\n00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.440\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie, it looks like we're\nabout at a ton for this episode.\n\n663\n00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.600\nThank you for taking the time to show us\nthe different types of charts that we\n\n664\n00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.100\nhave available to us and\n\n665\n00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:55.970\nI know you said you could do this\nmanually, those old-school methods.\n\n666\n00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:59.516\nBut with the available technology that\nwe have today we can go ahead and\n\n667\n00:34:59.516 --> 00:35:02.940\nuse pieces of software to help us\nwith our charts to remove any kind of\n\n668\n00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.245\nerrors that we might go ahead and\nintroduce.\n\n669\n00:35:05.245 --> 00:35:08.590\nSo, we're just a the tip\nof the iceberg here.\n\n670\n00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.413\nWe have a lot more tools coming your way.\n\n671\n00:35:10.413 --> 00:35:11.290\nSo stay tuned.\n\n672\n00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.738\nThank you guys for being with us today.\n\n673\n00:35:12.738 --> 00:35:13.854\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n674\n00:35:13.854 --> 00:35:15.310\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n675\n00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.179\n&gt;&gt; Signing off.\n\n676\n00:35:16.179 --> 00:35:17.250\nHave a great one.\n\n677\n00:35:18.954 --> 00:35:24.530\n[MUSIC]\n\n678\n00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.328\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

[SOUND] Welcome and thank you for\njoining this CompTIA Project+ episode.\n\n5\n00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:18.021\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:21.941\nIf you've been following along, you'll\nnotice that this is a continuation of our\n\n7\n00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:25.749\nprevious episode where we were looking at\nour different types of tools that we had\n\n8\n00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.120\navailable to us,\nour project management tools.\n\n9\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.286\nWe only got to take a look at some graphs,\nso we're gonna go ahead and pick up here.\n\n10\n00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:34.090\nAnd with us today we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.550\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.130\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n13\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.140\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non taking a look at some of the different\n\n14\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.440\ntools that we're gonna see that's gonna\nreally help us in project management.\n\n15\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.370\nBecause a lot of times the idea here of\nmaking decisions is not something you\n\n16\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.180\nshould ever take lightly of\ncourse in project management.\n\n17\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.940\nBut you need to make an informed decision,\nwhich requires you to be able\n\n18\n00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.380\nto gather a lot of data,\nbe able to analyze a lot of data.\n\n19\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.520\nSo that way you know exactly\nwhere to spend your money,\n\n20\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.650\nwhere to actually put your resources.\n\n21\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.230\nSo that you can actually\ncontrol the actual cost and\n\n22\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.720\ntime, as well as the scope\nof the project too.\n\n23\n00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.730\nSo previously we had taken a look at\nsome charts and even some of the or\n\n24\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.080\nat least one which is the one\nthat I'm more familiar.\n\n25\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.000\nMicrosoft Project as a part of tech,\nsome of the software and\n\n26\n00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.230\ntools that are available.\n\n27\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.050\nAnd talk about when and\n\n28\n00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.400\nwhy you would actually use some\nof those different charts.\n\n29\n00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.820\nToday, we're continuing on to take a look\nat what we call the idea here of some\n\n30\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.910\ntype of project.\n\n31\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.930\nManagement dashboard or\n\n32\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.400\na status type of report that we\nwant take a look at as well.\n\n33\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.600\nSo let me show you an example\nof one of these so\n\n34\n00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.010\nthat we can talk about\nthem a little bit more.\n\n35\n00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.350\nNow this is one I simply downloaded\noff the internet here as a generic\n\n36\n00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.550\ncopy of one.\n\n37\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.070\nAnd so, when you start taking a look at\nthe information that we see right here.\n\n38\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.540\nI'm trying to pull it out so that we\ncan see it just a little bit better.\n\n39\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.620\nSo what is the idea of the dashboard?\n\n40\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.800\nThe dashboard essentially shows us what\nmetrics, or the idea of performance\n\n41\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.990\nthings that we can actually take a look\nat over our entire project team.\n\n42\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.653\nSo, over here on the left hand side we\ndo have something like what we'd call\n\n43\n00:02:10.653 --> 00:02:11.700\nan entry table.\n\n44\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.256\nWhere we can see the individual task and\nwho's actually assigned to that task.\n\n45\n00:02:16.256 --> 00:02:18.154\nAnd even the status over here-.\n\n46\n00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:18.710\n&gt;&gt; I have work?\n\n47\n00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.468\n&gt;&gt; Where it's actually marked as complete.\n\n48\n00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:21.179\nYou actually have completed your work.\n\n49\n00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:22.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:22.103 --> 00:02:23.961\n&gt;&gt; So you're actually good at this one.\n\n51\n00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:27.769\nBut notice I can also see down here\nwhere there's actually work but\n\n52\n00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.110\nit hasn't actually started yet.\n\n53\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.780\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n54\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.530\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe can actually keep a track of just that\n\n55\n00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.980\nas a basic beginning of things\nas we start to see that.\n\n56\n00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.790\nNow along with that we also talk\nabout the use of a Gantt chart.\n\n57\n00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.290\nSo you might also use this.\n\n58\n00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.250\nNow this one is not as detailed and\nfull of the information\n\n59\n00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.780\nas what we normally see in\nsomething like Microsoft Project.\n\n60\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.450\nBut at least let's you know like\nwhere everything actually starts and\n\n61\n00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.240\nends in comparison to the actual\ntimeline that's given here.\n\n62\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.950\nNow, behind all this, you might be saying,\n\n63\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.350\nwell where the heck is all\nthe data going or coming from?\n\n64\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.060\nWell, if you're the project manager\nyou might also be keeping this type of\n\n65\n00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.043\ninformation data inside of an Excel\nworkbook and that's what this is.\n\n66\n00:03:16.043 --> 00:03:19.900\nIs it's just a simple Excel workbook and\ninstead everything that is actually\n\n67\n00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.210\nhappening here on this end\nof it which is another tab.\n\n68\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.250\nAnd this is where all the data is\nentered in tabular form at some place.\n\n69\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.060\nAnd then it even has some percentage\ncomplete, some pending items,\n\n70\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.130\nsome other information\nthat we see right here.\n\n71\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.280\nBut we take that and\n\n72\n00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.650\nwe create charts inside of Excel to help\nus to manage that a little bit better.\n\n73\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.820\nI can even see the budget comparisons.\n\n74\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.100\nThen we'll be talking about\nsome of this information.\n\n75\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.600\nThe planned budget versus what\nwe've actually spent so far.\n\n76\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.840\nAlso we can look at the over all\ntask data in a very graphical form.\n\n77\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.138\nAnd I've separated out this piece to show\nthe percentage of completion versus those\n\n78\n00:03:57.138 --> 00:03:59.220\nthat have yet to start.\n\n79\n00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.580\nAnd right now even other pending\ndecisions that need to be made\n\n80\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.750\nin that way you know at a quick\nglance how your projects doing.\n\n81\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.650\nNow these bigger types of dashboards\ncan get a little bit out of hand.\n\n82\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.771\nAnd by that what I mean is you can put so\n\n83\n00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:16.858\nmuch data on there that it\ncan get a little bit clunky.\n\n84\n00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:22.146\nWhat you wanna do is pick kind of maybe\nyour top ten or top five, charts or\n\n85\n00:04:22.146 --> 00:04:26.747\ndifferent pieces of information\nthat you really want to see.\n\n86\n00:04:26.747 --> 00:04:30.750\nLet's say at the beginning of the day and\nthat you need a track throughout the day.\n\n87\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.400\nSo a lot of times your software may allow\nyou to create a dashboard exactly like\n\n88\n00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.385\nthis inside the software itself\nby creating different reports and\n\n89\n00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:41.270\nlayouts in the way that they want.\n\n90\n00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.480\nOr you can do it manually like\nthe way that I have shown here\n\n91\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.740\nwhich you just keep\nseparate individual tabs.\n\n92\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.420\nWhere you put the data on and\ntell that you want it to display the chart\n\n93\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.670\nform of the information right\nhere on that first page.\n\n94\n00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.600\n&gt;&gt; Or like here at ITProTV we have\nthose pillars with the actual flat\n\n95\n00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.180\nscreens mounted on the columns there.\n\n96\n00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.330\nAnd we just have intermittent\nthe screen changes for\n\n97\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.910\nthe different metrics that are shown.\n\n98\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, the idea here of course\nis keep metrics right there available for\n\n99\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.650\nyou and what you need to do.\n\n100\n00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.570\nFor project managers, they need to\nbe on top of the data at all points.\n\n101\n00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.030\nIt helps also for your project team to\nactually understand where they are as\n\n102\n00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.290\nwell, if you can actually keep this\ninformation in front of them too.\n\n103\n00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.810\nSo, it's a quick way to glance and\n\n104\n00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.110\nhopefully be able to take a look from\nthe information that you're given here.\n\n105\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.897\nDecisions that need to be made,\nand make them actually informed,\n\n106\n00:05:32.897 --> 00:05:34.507\nbased on the data that you're given.\n\n107\n00:05:34.507 --> 00:05:38.903\nBut that of course requires you be a great\nproject manager in terms of communication.\n\n108\n00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:42.549\nGetting the data back in so\nthat you can then fill it in and\n\n109\n00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:47.090\nthen see the analysis of it in terms\nof charts and know what to do next.\n\n110\n00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.300\nSo it's a great tool, something that we\nshould not overlook just because we think\n\n111\n00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.240\nwhat's the big deal with fancy charts.\n\n112\n00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.110\nBut they can really help you out\nwhen you really need to take a look\n\n113\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.310\nat a tremendous amount of\ndata in a single dashboard.\n\n114\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.860\nInstead of having to flip through\npage after page after page, or\n\n115\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.890\neven tab after tab.\n\n116\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.485\nIt gives you a nice comparison right here\nand a nice sampling of all your data.\n\n117\n00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:08.125\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n118\n00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:13.035\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that moves us in to\nanother area then when we start to\n\n119\n00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:15.325\ntake a look at other\ntools that are available.\n\n120\n00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:18.715\nNow, this area we're not really\ngonna actually show anything.\n\n121\n00:06:18.715 --> 00:06:24.095\nWe do need to talk about what we call,\nof course, knowledge management tools.\n\n122\n00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:27.710\nNow, this is where it becomes\na little bit more of the etherial and\n\n123\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.150\nthe artistic side of project management.\n\n124\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.010\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of project management and\n\n125\n00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.740\nknowledge management tools.\n\n126\n00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.700\nWhat we're actually saying is that we\nas project managers need to be able to\n\n127\n00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:48.570\nhave at our benefit or our resource\nthe correct tools that are available.\n\n128\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.780\nTo make sure that we're getting the right\ninformation directly to the right people\n\n129\n00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.340\ninside of our projects.\n\n130\n00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.520\nAnd if you're and old school type of\nproject manager, the way that you simply\n\n131\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.370\ndid this is that you communicated through\nthe higher hierarchy of the organization.\n\n132\n00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.660\nSo you as a project manager,\nyou may have a daily status meeting\n\n133\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.960\nwith your team project leaders and\nthe coordinator the schedule, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.820\nThat's how it may begin at\nthe beginning of the day.\n\n135\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.900\nAnd that way, you know that if\nyou need to push, you push.\n\n136\n00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.230\nYou know if you need information, so\nthat you can make another decision,\n\n137\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.140\nyou make that information.\n\n138\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.370\nAnd then that is then distributed\nthrough those team leaders as well.\n\n139\n00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.280\nAnd those team leaders then of course\ngather their teams together and\n\n140\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.070\nthen they start distributing\nthe information.\n\n141\n00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.840\nIt is a very effective\ntrickle down effect.\n\n142\n00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.660\nBut at times though,\nthat effect can take a long time before\n\n143\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.690\nanything really gets rolling and\nin action.\n\n144\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.200\nThe great thing is,\nyou are now actually in what?\n\n145\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.855\nThe second decade of the 21st century.\n\n146\n00:07:49.855 --> 00:07:50.501\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n147\n00:07:50.501 --> 00:07:51.883\nAnd that more than likely means that,\n\n148\n00:07:51.883 --> 00:07:54.524\nyou have been affected by the internet\nat some particular point in time.\n\n149\n00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:58.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in this day and\nage everyone wants everything now, and\n\n150\n00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.793\nwe have that accessibility due\nto social media and technology.\n\n151\n00:08:02.793 --> 00:08:07.008\nAll right, so more than likely what you'll\nend up seeing especially in today’s world\n\n152\n00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:10.410\nis that your company may have,\nwhat we call, an intranet.\n\n153\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.260\nSo that’s differing from the internet\nwhich we are going to discuss in just\n\n154\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:14.846\na moment here.\n\n155\n00:08:14.846 --> 00:08:19.220\nBut an intranet,\nessentially is an internal network site\n\n156\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.080\nthat you can allow your employees or\nyour team members to, at the beginning of\n\n157\n00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.580\nthe day simply login to it and\nget the relevant information for\n\n158\n00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.050\ntheir particular team on whether\nthey might be assigned that day.\n\n159\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.800\nOr information on the materials that\nare actually here and available for\n\n160\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.350\nwhatever task is actually on hand.\n\n161\n00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.815\nDate information, you might even\nsee weather related information.\n\n162\n00:08:42.815 --> 00:08:44.916\nIt really turns out to be a-\n&gt;&gt; Human resource portal.\n\n163\n00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:49.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it turns out to be maybe\neven a human resource portal as well.\n\n164\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.180\nThere's a lot of information there, even\nto the point where instead of somebody\n\n165\n00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.210\nhaving to come to the project scheduler,\nand say hey I need some time off\n\n166\n00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.380\nbecause I really have this injury,\nI've gotta go and see the doctor.\n\n167\n00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.540\nThey can instead go to that portal and\n\n168\n00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.310\nmaybe click on the link that says,\nschedule the time off for\n\n169\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.240\nyour PTO here, to make sure that that\ngets directly to who it needs to.\n\n170\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.520\nInstead of trying to go, who is\nthe actual scheduler on this project,\n\n171\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.290\nthey know exactly how to get there.\n\n172\n00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.770\nRegulatory information or even standards\nas your project has to follow,\n\n173\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.150\nall that can be built into electronic\nhandbooks that then they can actually pull\n\n174\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:30.080\nup at any time that they need to and\nget access in, and be able to see that.\n\n175\n00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.610\nSo you don't have to actually make sure\nthat you told everybody correctly,\n\n176\n00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.850\nyou just give them what\naccess to the intranet.\n\n177\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.605\nAnd from there they know that\nthey are supposed to check daily,\n\n178\n00:09:40.605 --> 00:09:43.510\nthat the information that's there.\n\n179\n00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.310\nYou might even be able to\nleave them emails or messages\n\n180\n00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.630\nthat they're supposed to check through and\nverify that everything's coming.\n\n181\n00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:55.330\nSo you do have that ability to be\nable to track even daily assignments.\n\n182\n00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.880\nSo that intranet site is something that\nreally helps to distribute information\n\n183\n00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.300\nmuch quicker.\n\n184\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.420\nAnd if it's tied in to your system\nin terms of your project management\n\n185\n00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.298\ninformation system,\n\n186\n00:10:04.298 --> 00:10:09.240\nyou might find out that as you update your\nmanagement system, it starts updating that\n\n187\n00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.060\nintranet where they can actually see\nwhat progress is going on as well.\n\n188\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.640\nPretty nice, it's like a one stop shop.\n\n189\n00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.630\nYou can go there to get all your important\ninformation, you probably could even post\n\n190\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.680\nsome materials safety data sheet there for\nwhatever project your working at.\n\n191\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.170\nAny changes, updates, I like it.\n\n192\n00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n193\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.700\nIt's a tool that really does\nbring you into the 21st century.\n\n194\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.870\nMost of us go really?\n\n195\n00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.870\nYes, it really is, it's a great tool.\n\n196\n00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.680\nNow the other side that,\nlike we said is the internet itself.\n\n197\n00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.560\nNow, normally if your company\nhas an internet website,\n\n198\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.980\nthat's great because it does give\nout publicly available information,\n\n199\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.630\nthat everybody else might need\nespecially about the project itself.\n\n200\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.485\nIf people have concerns about the project,\nyou can go ahead and\n\n201\n00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:53.280\nessentially mount your own PR right there\nand say, here's what we're doing to\n\n202\n00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.820\nensure that our project is not going to\naffect x, y, z, whatever it might be.\n\n203\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.550\nHere's what we're doing to ensure that\nour project is staying within the EPA\n\n204\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.140\nguidelines here in the United States,\nfor Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n205\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.085\nThat way they can have that and then you\ncan also have contact information and even\n\n206\n00:11:12.085 --> 00:11:17.290\njust other information that the public\nmight normally find relevant as well.\n\n207\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.720\nA lot of times, even the vendors might\nneed some additional information,\n\n208\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.120\nthey're brand new.\n\n209\n00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.346\nYou might even have just the information\nthat it has a little link that says for\n\n210\n00:11:26.346 --> 00:11:29.793\nvendors only, or\nvendor information where they submit like,\n\n211\n00:11:29.793 --> 00:11:33.307\nhere's what they're gonna be\ndelivering information on, and\n\n212\n00:11:33.307 --> 00:11:35.804\nhere is the other things\nthat you might have.\n\n213\n00:11:35.804 --> 00:11:38.470\nAnd that way they can submit\nthat into the portal and\n\n214\n00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.950\nthen everybody gets the information.\n\n215\n00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.980\nYou name it, an internet site is actually\nfairly decent if you need that for\n\n216\n00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.275\nyour project, and\nusually larger projects too.\n\n217\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.425\nNow, you may have also heard about Wiki's.\n\n218\n00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:56.030\nCherokee, do you create Wiki's?\n\n219\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.590\n&gt;&gt; I don't.\n\n220\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.250\n&gt;&gt; You don't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n221\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.380\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever read a Wiki?\n\n222\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.320\n&gt;&gt; I have.\n\n223\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what did you read a Wiki for?\n\n224\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.510\nThat's the key.\n\n225\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.133\n&gt;&gt; Honestly,\nI couldn't even tell you Ronnie, but\n\n226\n00:12:06.133 --> 00:12:10.000\ndefinitely it's probably\nsome kind of technology.\n\n227\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.940\nAnd I don't know if you're gonna\nask me how I feel about that.\n\n228\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.590\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n229\n00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:15.090\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n230\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.050\nSure, let's ask you.\n\n231\n00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.220\nHow do you feel about that?\n\n232\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.620\n&gt;&gt; I kind of have my own opinion about\n\n233\n00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.573\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, share.\n\n234\n00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.972\n&gt;&gt; So, I think they're great if you\n\n235\n00:12:21.972 --> 00:12:27.202\nare already familiar with the technology\nor some kind of information and\n\n236\n00:12:27.202 --> 00:12:31.782\nyou're just kind of refreshing.\nBecause if you see information that's\n\n237\n00:12:31.782 --> 00:12:36.444\ndisplayed on that page that's incorrect,\nyou'll normally be able to remember that,\n\n238\n00:12:36.444 --> 00:12:38.530\nat least that's what I think about it.\n\n239\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.880\nBut if you're trying to learn\nsomething that's brand new to you and\n\n240\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.378\nyou go to the Wiki pages,\nyou can't trust that information.\n\n241\n00:12:46.378 --> 00:12:50.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's sometimes where that\nends up happening and that's really bad.\n\n242\n00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.892\nI think you're right though,\nWiki pages are really design for\n\n243\n00:12:53.892 --> 00:12:57.791\nsomebody that's got a technical interest\nin whatever product that they are using.\n\n244\n00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:02.325\nAnd you can imagine for\nsomething like this for your project team.\n\n245\n00:13:02.325 --> 00:13:05.610\nLet's say that they are to integrate\nsomething into the project and\n\n246\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.620\nthe way that they do that is by\nbuying these specialised components.\n\n247\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.690\nAnd all over sudden they realize\nas they're hooking something up,\n\n248\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.700\nthat it doesn't really seem to work\nthe way that they thought it would work.\n\n249\n00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.283\nWell, going to those Wiki pages may give\nyou the technical specifications and\n\n250\n00:13:21.283 --> 00:13:25.185\ninformation you need to ensure\nthat those system are compatible.\n\n251\n00:13:25.185 --> 00:13:28.509\nSometimes you find out that even\nafter purchasing everything, it's\n\n252\n00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:32.222\nnot as great as you thought it was and\nit didn't work the way that you wanted to,\n\n253\n00:13:32.222 --> 00:13:35.620\nbut you check out the Wiki pages you\nmight find the idea here of updates.\n\n254\n00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.719\nSo when Cherokee mentioned the notion\nof finding out when something's wrong,\n\n255\n00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:42.599\nand they still post it-\n&gt;&gt; But Ronnie it's on the Internet,\n\n256\n00:13:42.599 --> 00:13:43.297\nit must be true.\n\n257\n00:13:43.297 --> 00:13:45.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you may find\n[CROSSTALK] that's the key here.\n\n258\n00:13:45.015 --> 00:13:47.051\nYou may find errors, and\nthey may post it and\n\n259\n00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:50.027\nsay, here's something that\neverybody's tried out, and\n\n260\n00:13:50.027 --> 00:13:53.710\nthey went back, and now they're\ngetting people reporting the errors.\n\n261\n00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.606\nWell they may actually report, we've found\nthat it's actually a glitch and a bug and\n\n262\n00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:01.700\nthat they are working on\nsomething to help fix that.\n\n263\n00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.870\nSo, being able to have access to these\ntypes of Wiki's which can be, again,\n\n264\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:10.700\neither internal Wiki's as well, or\neven external Wiki's which you can create.\n\n265\n00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.755\nSo if ever you've ever used SharePoint\nyou've probably seen that idea of creating\n\n266\n00:14:13.755 --> 00:14:18.710\nWiki's for internal information as well,\nthat will help you out too.\n\n267\n00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:23.360\nSo make sure you take advantage\nof those instances if you can.\n\n268\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.982\nNow, just when you go,\nall right that's plenty but\n\n269\n00:14:25.982 --> 00:14:30.040\nthere's also the idea of the vendor\n\n270\n00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.610\nown type of knowledge bases that they\nmay also put up their own on the net.\n\n271\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.550\n&gt;&gt; This is where I\nnormally point people to.\n\n272\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.120\nI mean, especially if your studying for\n\n273\n00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.360\nMicrosoft exam what better way to get the\ndirect information than Microsoft TechNet.\n\n274\n00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.650\nGet it straight from the horses mouth,\nthat's how I feel.\n\n275\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.480\n&gt;&gt; No, that's exactly right.\n\n276\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.670\nDon't get me wrong, there's a lot\nof people out there that go no,\n\n277\n00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.540\ndon't ever go to the official site\nbecause they'll tell you one thing and\n\n278\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.420\nthen you'll figure out it works\ndifferently, that can happen.\n\n279\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.970\nBut these are then people that\nnormally have designed it and\n\n280\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.120\nthen they put a knowledge base out on it.\n\n281\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.476\nThey probably try to test out what they've\nactually done and they run through and\n\n282\n00:15:04.476 --> 00:15:09.025\ntry and get you an answer that's directly\nfrom the people, that really did write and\n\n283\n00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:10.838\ndesign the information itself.\n\n284\n00:15:10.838 --> 00:15:13.260\nSo, when you have a system like that,\nyou are,\n\n285\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.079\nyou're getting exactly what Cherokee said,\nfrom the people who made it,\n\n286\n00:15:17.079 --> 00:15:20.740\nand they should be the authority on\nwhat you are actually seeing there.\n\n287\n00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.720\nSo, it's a really good way for\n\n288\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.590\nyou to at least get some knowledge on\nwhatever that piece of equipment is.\n\n289\n00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.640\nOr a process that you're following\nto help you to get through this.\n\n290\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and also if there's any kind of\nindustry standards like NIST or IEEE,\n\n291\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.770\nyou definitely wanna check\nout those types of things,\n\n292\n00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.270\nlike your RFCs, your Request For Comments.\n\n293\n00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.088\nBecause it might be a little dry,\na little technical, but\n\n294\n00:15:43.088 --> 00:15:46.420\nyou're gonna get all the information and\nthe accurate information.\n\n295\n00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.960\nWell, hopefully [LAUGH].\n\n296\n00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.660\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah.\n\n297\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:54.626\nUsually you will, but it doesn't mean that\nyou can't stump even the vendors at times.\n\n298\n00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:58.244\nI haven't had this with Microsoft yet but\nI know there's probably some products\n\n299\n00:15:58.244 --> 00:16:01.059\nwhere I've used them in the past and\nwas like, you go and try and\n\n300\n00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:05.111\nfind the vendor knowledge base and They\ndon't exist yet, they're that brand new.\n\n301\n00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:07.589\n&gt;&gt; For sure, you can encounter\nyour own specific problems.\n\n302\n00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:10.300\nThat happened to us before\nwith that mail server [LAUGH].\n\n303\n00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.069\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely with mail servers.\n\n304\n00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:15.174\nThat’s always a possibility,\nespecially with those things.\n\n305\n00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:18.028\nNow the last one that we want to\ntalk about as far as a tool for\n\n306\n00:16:18.028 --> 00:16:19.263\nthe modern age, right.\n\n307\n00:16:19.263 --> 00:16:21.855\nI am not saying you have\nto adopt all these.\n\n308\n00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:23.940\nI'm not even saying you\nhave to adopt one of them.\n\n309\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.935\nBut using these probably is gonna help\nyou to be a bit more efficient, right.\n\n310\n00:16:27.935 --> 00:16:32.380\nThe last one I want to talk about is kind\nof the ideal electronic collaboration.\n\n311\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:39.550\nIf you heard people raving about the idea\nof Skype for Business or SharePoint,\n\n312\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:44.655\nanything like that, Office 365\nCollaboration is now Skype for Business.\n\n313\n00:16:44.655 --> 00:16:49.260\nIf you heard anything like that,\nthese are tools that really do give you\n\n314\n00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.990\nthat ability to have the true\ncollaborative nature that you want to.\n\n315\n00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.620\nSo for example, let's say you're working\n\n316\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.730\non a document that's gonna be released to\nthe public on your project right away.\n\n317\n00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.360\nBut it's between three or\nfour different sites.\n\n318\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.260\nAnd what you want to do is you want to\nmake sure that everybody has their opinion\n\n319\n00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.170\non how this document reads, and whether or\nnot they want to make changes on it.\n\n320\n00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.850\nWell, the old fashioned way that\nyou would normally have to do this,\n\n321\n00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.180\nis that you've got one of two ideas here.\n\n322\n00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.500\nI could just make four different copies\nof that if I had four different sites.\n\n323\n00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.870\nAnd just send a copy to each one and\n\n324\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.510\ntell them, ASAP, read,\nsend in corrections here.\n\n325\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.396\nAnd then wait for draft number two, and\nyou continue to go back and forth on it.\n\n326\n00:17:31.396 --> 00:17:33.971\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you take\nthose revision numbers.\n\n327\n00:17:33.971 --> 00:17:37.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, make sure you actually find\nout what needs to be done, okay.\n\n328\n00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.050\nIt's a bit of long process.\n\n329\n00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.990\nThe other one is more expensive,\ninstead of doing it that way.\n\n330\n00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:46.415\nWhat we do, Cherokee, is all right,\nwe need to get everybody that's gonna be\n\n331\n00:17:46.415 --> 00:17:49.515\ninvolved in the PRs on each\nof these sites to come here.\n\n332\n00:17:49.515 --> 00:17:53.210\nSo you fly them all in for\nthe week or for the weekend.\n\n333\n00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.553\nAnd there it is, now you're\nworking on one document together.\n\n334\n00:17:55.553 --> 00:17:59.050\nBut that's insanely\nexpensive at the same time.\n\n335\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.480\nI'm not saying that you can't\nhave a good time doing it.\n\n336\n00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.483\nBut at the same time, you might\nfind out it may blow your budget.\n\n337\n00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:05.238\n&gt;&gt; There are better ways to\nspend your money, exactly.\n\n338\n00:18:05.238 --> 00:18:07.091\n&gt;&gt; Maybe much better\nways to spend your money.\n\n339\n00:18:07.091 --> 00:18:07.959\n&gt;&gt; Time also, yeah.\n\n340\n00:18:07.959 --> 00:18:09.670\n&gt;&gt; Time, yeah.\n\n341\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.670\n&gt;&gt; Reducing your footprint,\nthat's what it's all about, Ronnie.\n\n342\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\nYeah, yeah.\n\n343\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.070\nFor me, I wouldn't mind actually\nhaving a bunch of people over and\n\n344\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.630\njust that for weekend.\n\n345\n00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.860\nAnd then billing the company for\nit, that would be kinda neat.\n\n346\n00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.830\nNo, not really, don't do that.\n\n347\n00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.885\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell Tim, yeah.\n\n348\n00:18:22.885 --> 00:18:25.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you kind of get the idea here,\n\n349\n00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.338\nthat this is one of those things\nwhich collaboration takes money,\n\n350\n00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:30.720\nit takes time a lot of times.\n\n351\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.920\nBut by using a system like\nthis that we've talked about,\n\n352\n00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.710\nit makes the collaboration\njust about as live as you get.\n\n353\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.340\nAnd nobody has to leave their office.\n\n354\n00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have that initial-\n&gt;&gt; Cost.\n\n355\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.475\n&gt;&gt; Expense and time, but\nthen after that you really are saving.\n\n356\n00:18:46.475 --> 00:18:50.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so for example, we're using\nthe example that I just mentioned here.\n\n357\n00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.030\nLet's say it is a statement\nthat needs to be released.\n\n358\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:57.240\nWell, what I can do is actually put it,\nfor instance, we have Office 365.\n\n359\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.870\nWell, I can actually open that\nup with Office 365 Online,\n\n360\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.280\nwith Word Online on my computer.\n\n361\n00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:08.030\nAnd then, I can share that document\nout between me and the other sites.\n\n362\n00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:12.280\nAnd they can pull it up, and immediately\nthey can start editing that document.\n\n363\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.825\nAnd I can watch as it happens, as I give\nthem permissions to edit the document.\n\n364\n00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:21.070\nAnd that way at the end,\nI can then say all right, using Skype for\n\n365\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.336\nBusiness as far as our chat goes,\nif we want to.\n\n366\n00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:25.640\nOr maybe even video conferencing,\nsaying hey,\n\n367\n00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.380\ndoes everybody agree with the changes?\n\n368\n00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.730\nAnd if they do, it's done and we're\nactually right there and ready to go.\n\n369\n00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.480\nThe same thing when you do\nhave off-site people, or\n\n370\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.290\nyou have people that\nare really in that position in\n\n371\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.760\nwhich they cannot make that particular\nmeeting that you want to call.\n\n372\n00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.084\nAnd you still need to be able\nto have some of their input, but\n\n373\n00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:44.875\nit's because they're\ninvolved somewhere else.\n\n374\n00:19:44.875 --> 00:19:47.940\nBut they can at least listen in and\nmaybe provide some input.\n\n375\n00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.570\nAnd it really is worth it\nin terms of collaboration,\n\n376\n00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.830\nespecially because you\nare in the 21st century.\n\n377\n00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.480\nSo not in 20th century,\nI'm a 20th century guy myself.\n\n378\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do have a lot of\nthis fancy technological tools.\n\n379\n00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.610\nBut Ronnie, what about some old school\ntools that we can go ahead and implement?\n\n380\n00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:08.652\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're not-\n&gt;&gt; Arithmetic [LAUGH].\n\n381\n00:20:08.652 --> 00:20:14.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the most basic types of\ntools that we also want to head into.\n\n382\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.030\nSo we've talked about several, right.\n\n383\n00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.630\nSo when it begins, okay,\nhow do you manage the whole thing?\n\n384\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.610\nWe might use software, right,\nto be able to see everything.\n\n385\n00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:27.260\nThen we talked about charts that\nreally help us to be able to spot\n\n386\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.840\ncertain elements I want to,\nsuch as cause and effect.\n\n387\n00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.030\nAnd even be able to talk about where\ndo we spend the majority of our money,\n\n388\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.607\nbeing able also to track usage,\nyou name it.\n\n389\n00:20:36.607 --> 00:20:39.680\nThere's plenty of charts\nto help us to do that.\n\n390\n00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.080\nNow we even looked at the idea of\nusing what, 21st century versions\n\n391\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.860\nof what we've talked about as well, and to\nmake things a little bit more efficient.\n\n392\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.848\nBut sometimes you just have to do things\nkind of the old fashion way, okay.\n\n393\n00:20:50.848 --> 00:20:54.200\nWhich means, well,\nyou have to actually use math.\n\n394\n00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.653\nAnd the great thing is this, okay.\n\n395\n00:20:55.653 --> 00:20:58.500\nEven though we're gonna\ntake them manually,\n\n396\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.520\nyou do not have to\nalways do this manually.\n\n397\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.870\nThe very fact is these tools that\nwe've mentioned, a lot of times,\n\n398\n00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.840\nespecially like the project\nmanagement information systems like\n\n399\n00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.360\nMicrosoft Project,\nthey do it in the background for you,\n\n400\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.210\nthat you don't even have to worry about\nwhat the actual calculations are.\n\n401\n00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.253\nBut guess what?\n\n402\n00:21:18.253 --> 00:21:25.000\nOn the CompTIA Project+ though, you do\nneed to at least know these formulas.\n\n403\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.250\nAnd you do need to at least have a basic\nunderstanding of some of the terminology\n\n404\n00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.450\nthat we're going to use.\n\n405\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.410\nAnd now what we're specifically\nlooking at here are what we call,\n\n406\n00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:39.750\ndifferent ways to measure performance,\nis what we're normally talking about.\n\n407\n00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.043\nSo we normally measure in terms of our\nproject perfomance based on cost, based on\n\n408\n00:21:44.043 --> 00:21:47.850\nthe adherence of time, whether we're\nahead of schedule or behind schedule,\n\n409\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:53.170\nwhether we are ahead of or above budget,\nunder budget or over budget.\n\n410\n00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.735\nAnd then, of course, even the requirement,\nare we out of our scope?\n\n411\n00:21:55.735 --> 00:21:58.780\nOr are we actually within\nour scope as well?\n\n412\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.240\nSo we are always looking for\nany type of indicator\n\n413\n00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.250\nthat shows where we're throwing\noff one of those constraints.\n\n414\n00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:10.110\nSo that we can round everything backed\nup and do what we need to, okay?\n\n415\n00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.567\nAnd that at least involves us having at\nleast the most fundamental skills and\n\n416\n00:22:13.567 --> 00:22:16.821\nunderstanding of some of the terms\nthat we're gonna be talking about.\n\n417\n00:22:16.821 --> 00:22:20.930\nAs well as some of those term, the-\n&gt;&gt; Equations.\n\n418\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.535\n&gt;&gt; Equations,\nI couldn't remember what they were called.\n\n419\n00:22:22.535 --> 00:22:23.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say formulas.\n\n420\n00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.130\n&gt;&gt; I've been looking forward\nto them all day [LAUGH].\n\n421\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so, we'll at least get\nstarted with the terminology, right?\n\n422\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, I'll take that.\n\n423\n00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.900\n&gt;&gt; And then, we'll take a look\nat where that takes us, okay?\n\n424\n00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.980\nSo let's go ahead and talk about some\nof the different terminologies that you\n\n425\n00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.330\nare gonna absolutely, 100%, need to know.\n\n426\n00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.430\nI don't know how else to describe it,\nokay?\n\n427\n00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.238\nNow, these particular\n[LAUGH] definitions here,\n\n428\n00:22:44.238 --> 00:22:48.416\nthey are not official\nproject managers definitions.\n\n429\n00:22:48.416 --> 00:22:49.306\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie Wong definitions?\n\n430\n00:22:49.306 --> 00:22:53.780\n&gt;&gt; These are the basic Ronnie Wong kind of\ndefinitions, boiled down to the essence\n\n431\n00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.830\nas much as you can, of the simplified\nway that Ronnie's mind works.\n\n432\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.500\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n433\n00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.710\nSo when you hear the term planned value,\nyou're more than likely to see PV, okay?\n\n434\n00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.226\nSo the letter P as you have for Peter, and\n\n435\n00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:07.690\nthen V as in Victor\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n436\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.380\n&gt;&gt; So you're more than likely to see that,\nthat stands for planned value.\n\n437\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.680\nThat's exactly what we mean here, as this\nis how much I plan to spend on this.\n\n438\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:23.696\nSo if I say that here it is for\nmy work breakdown structure\n\n439\n00:23:23.696 --> 00:23:28.569\n8.1.1, that I have a PV of $1500.\n\n440\n00:23:28.569 --> 00:23:30.051\nWell, what am I saying?\n\n441\n00:23:30.051 --> 00:23:32.899\nI didn't spend it yet, but what,\n\n442\n00:23:32.899 --> 00:23:38.840\nI'm planning to spend $1500\non that particular task.\n\n443\n00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.690\nEverybody at this point is still with me.\n\n444\n00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.649\nSo I didn't actually throw\nany curveball at you.\n\n445\n00:23:43.649 --> 00:23:46.660\nSo let's go into the opposite end of this,\nright.\n\n446\n00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.910\nThere's also AC, right.\n\n447\n00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:52.410\nAC for us is Alpha, and then C is Charlie.\n\n448\n00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.980\nI think that's-\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n449\n00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Alpha, Charlie, okay.\n\n450\n00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.720\nAnd so this actually stands for\nActual Cost.\n\n451\n00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.330\nWell, what the heck does that mean?\n\n452\n00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.467\nIt means, how much did you actually spend?\n\n453\n00:24:01.467 --> 00:24:05.436\nSo see, Ronnie's mind doesn't try to get\ninto a very technical sense of this.\n\n454\n00:24:05.436 --> 00:24:08.593\nHe tries to make sure that at least\nI understand what it means, okay?\n\n455\n00:24:08.593 --> 00:24:10.875\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure plenty of people out\nthere can appreciate that also.\n\n456\n00:24:10.875 --> 00:24:13.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthe other term that you'll likely see,\n\n457\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.660\nolder terms that you'll find in\nprevious editions of the PEMBOK,\n\n458\n00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:22.510\nway early, probably version three and\nmaybe version two of the PEMBOK here,\n\n459\n00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.300\nis ACWP, actual cost of work performed.\n\n460\n00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.623\nThat's actually meaning,\nhow much work was done and\n\n461\n00:24:29.623 --> 00:24:31.646\nhow much did you spend doing that work,\nokay?\n\n462\n00:24:31.646 --> 00:24:34.760\nBut the same thing here,\nhow much did you actually spend?\n\n463\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.090\nSo, if I know that I have\na Planned Value of $1,500, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:44.250\nAnd at this particular point though,\nI realized that, hey, what I've done is,\n\n465\n00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:49.197\nI've spent $500 of that, my actual\ncost at this point in the project is,\n\n466\n00:24:49.197 --> 00:24:51.629\nwell, $500, okay.\n\n467\n00:24:51.629 --> 00:24:58.072\nSo, not exactly [LAUGH] the idea here\nof anything that's overwhelming.\n\n468\n00:24:58.072 --> 00:24:59.940\n&gt;&gt; Trying to trick you or trick you up.\n\n469\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.317\n&gt;&gt; So Planned Value, what I think\nI'm gonna end up spending on this,\n\n470\n00:25:04.317 --> 00:25:07.610\nActual Cost here is what\nI actually expect so far.\n\n471\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.790\nNow, we get a little bit trickier here,\nokay.\n\n472\n00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.440\nThere's also BAC, right?\n\n473\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:21.830\nBAC, bravo, alpha, charlie, okay, so\nBAC here is Budget at Completion,\n\n474\n00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:27.075\nwhat I expected to spend when everything\nwas over, okay, so complete total amount.\n\n475\n00:25:27.075 --> 00:25:30.134\nSo, if I have my entire project, and\n\n476\n00:25:30.134 --> 00:25:34.977\nthat's scheduled to\nactually end with $75,000,\n\n477\n00:25:34.977 --> 00:25:40.190\nokay, is what I expect to\nspend overall period, okay.\n\n478\n00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.930\nWell, that's what I'm going to budget for\nthat.\n\n479\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:47.314\nDoesn't mean that I've spent it yet, okay,\nbut that's what I'm expecting to spend for\n\n480\n00:25:47.314 --> 00:25:49.440\nthe entire project itself.\n\n481\n00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.980\n&gt;&gt; So would you use PV to go ahead and\ndefine smaller components of that project?\n\n482\n00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can.\n\n483\n00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.490\nYou can actually say, this is how\nmuch we plan to spend at each stage.\n\n484\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:25:59.990\nAnd that way,\n\n485\n00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:05.830\nyou know about how much you can budget at\neach stage to help you out as well, okay.\n\n486\n00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.760\nSo it really does help\nwith these components,\n\n487\n00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.620\nbut I know it's kinda weird but\nyou need those three elements, okay?\n\n488\n00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.230\nYou absolutely need those three elements.\n\n489\n00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.280\nAnd the reason why you need those\nthree elements is because normally,\n\n490\n00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.800\nyou're trying to calculate\nwhat we call this, EV, okay?\n\n491\n00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.134\nSo that's echo victor, is that right?\n\n492\n00:26:22.134 --> 00:26:24.229\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; I think so, I don't need to know, yeah,\n\n493\n00:26:24.229 --> 00:26:26.281\nso somebody's gonna correct\nme on that one, okay.\n\n494\n00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:31.490\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I don't think those were right,\n\n495\n00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.438\nbut I can't remember.\n\n496\n00:26:32.438 --> 00:26:35.200\n&gt;&gt; No, Lauren, I'm really bad at that too.\n\n497\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.608\nSo Earned Value is what you're looking at,\nokay.\n\n498\n00:26:38.608 --> 00:26:43.530\nThe value of work completed, okay,\nso how much did you actually work,\n\n499\n00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:49.290\ncompared to, well, what did you\nactually expect to spend for that work?\n\n500\n00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.714\nSo you might find out something that\nyou actually did spend a lot more for\n\n501\n00:26:52.714 --> 00:26:57.250\nthat same amount of work to be done than\nwhat you had planned to spend, right?\n\n502\n00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.320\nSo I said I was only gonna spend what,\nI'll use Cherokee's here.\n\n503\n00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.537\nCherokee, we were talking about those\nhigh heels with the red bottoms on them.\n\n504\n00:27:05.537 --> 00:27:06.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know what they meant, but\n\n505\n00:27:06.796 --> 00:27:08.450\nCherokee said they mean\nthousands of dollars, okay.\n\n506\n00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:13.650\nSo let's say that Cherokee says,\nI expected to spend $2,000.\n\n507\n00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:14.960\nThat, to me, I would cry.\n\n508\n00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.290\nBut let's say that she says $2,000, okay?\n\n509\n00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:22.200\nBut she would compare that to\nwhat she actually spent, and\n\n510\n00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.810\nthen she would tell me\nthat she saved money.\n\n511\n00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.110\nI know it's weird, but that's [LAUGH]\nprobably what she would tell me,\n\n512\n00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.550\nis that she actually saved money.\n\n513\n00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.824\nYou wouldn't do that to me.\n&gt;&gt; They were a really good deal.\n\n514\n00:27:28.824 --> 00:27:31.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they were a really good deal,\nyeah, something like that.\n\n515\n00:27:31.147 --> 00:27:34.571\nBut that's the same thing\nthat happens here, right,\n\n516\n00:27:34.571 --> 00:27:38.082\nis that we need to actually\nbe able to evaluate, right?\n\n517\n00:27:38.082 --> 00:27:40.834\nWhat we've actually\ncompleted at this point and\n\n518\n00:27:40.834 --> 00:27:44.456\nwhat the value of that is at that\npoint in completion, okay, and\n\n519\n00:27:44.456 --> 00:27:47.765\nthat's what we call the idea\nof earned value here, okay?\n\n520\n00:27:47.765 --> 00:27:52.185\nAnd the only way you can do that is if\nyou know exactly what you had planned to\n\n521\n00:27:52.185 --> 00:27:55.911\nspend, okay, versus,\nwhat you actually did spend, okay.\n\n522\n00:27:55.911 --> 00:28:00.454\nSo that way, at that point in your\nproject, you know how much value you\n\n523\n00:28:00.454 --> 00:28:04.920\nactually have into the project at\nthat point in time versus how much it\n\n524\n00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.130\nactually should be at that point in\ntime according to your budget, okay?\n\n525\n00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:15.104\nSo there's a lot of information here and\nit's kind of strange, and this is what's\n\n526\n00:28:15.104 --> 00:28:19.650\ngonna kinda bug us is, if project\nmanagers, if this is your first one here,\n\n527\n00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.734\nis that this actually opens up into-\n&gt;&gt; Our equation is\n\n528\n00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:23.326\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Four or\n\n529\n00:28:23.326 --> 00:28:27.171\nfive different equations [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; We're setting you guys up for\n\n530\n00:28:27.171 --> 00:28:28.298\nsuccess right here.\n\n531\n00:28:28.298 --> 00:28:30.148\nThat's what's happening right now.\n\n532\n00:28:30.148 --> 00:28:31.800\nSo be familiar with these terms.\n\n533\n00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.912\n&gt;&gt; Be familiar with these\nterms as we head into that.\n\n534\n00:28:34.912 --> 00:28:37.678\nBut Cherokee, I think that at\nthis particular point in time,\n\n535\n00:28:37.678 --> 00:28:39.540\nI've actually run out of time again.\n\n536\n00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.420\n&gt;&gt; It's all right, Ronnie.\n\n537\n00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.990\nIt happens to the best of us.\n\n538\n00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:46.261\nIn this episode, we were able to take\na look at different types of technological\n\n539\n00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:49.641\nplatforms that we can go ahead and\nintegrate into our project so\n\n540\n00:28:49.641 --> 00:28:52.661\nthat we can have a more\nstreamlined efficient process.\n\n541\n00:28:52.661 --> 00:28:56.557\nAnd you also introduced to us to the terms\nthat we need to know before we continue\n\n542\n00:28:56.557 --> 00:28:57.890\nwith our equations.\n\n543\n00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.810\nSo thank you guys at home for\ntuning in with us today.\n\n544\n00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.570\nWe have a lot more\nProject+ coming your way.\n\n545\n00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.500\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n546\n00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.500\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n547\n00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.765\n&gt;&gt; Signing off.\n\n548\n00:29:05.765 --> 00:29:12.748\n[MUSIC]\n\n549\n00:29:12.748 --> 00:29:16.265\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.979\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:16.747\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.747 --> 00:00:18.554\nIf you've been following along,\n\n6\n00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:22.429\nyou've noticed that we are talking\nabout our project management tools.\n\n7\n00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.762\nIf you haven't been following along,\nI definitely suggest so because we explain\n\n8\n00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:31.300\nthe definitions for some equations that\nwe're gonna dive into during this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.447\nSo we're gonna go ahead and get started.\n\n10\n00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:34.941\nWith us today we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:36.600\nThank you for being with us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.288\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\non the show as we continue on with our\n\n13\n00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:42.640\nProject+, and taking a look at\nsome of these different tools\n\n14\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.875\nthat we can really use to help\nus to manage our projects.\n\n15\n00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:49.570\nAnd in previous episodes, we've talked\nabout some of those tools that really do\n\n16\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.520\nhelp you to kind of bring project\nmanagement into the 21st century as well.\n\n17\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.720\nAnd then we also talked about the very\nfact that we have to at least know some\n\n18\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.050\nbasic math and\n\n19\n00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.566\nsome of the different terminology that\nyou'll encounter in project management.\n\n20\n00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.560\nSo let's go ahead and review that\nterminology and then we'll get started in\n\n21\n00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.180\ntaking on some of the different types\nof little equations or formulas that\n\n22\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.130\nyou are going to have to actually know for\nthe project plus the exam as well.\n\n23\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.500\nNow the great thing about this,\nwhich is gonna be great for\n\n24\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.620\nyou, is that on the newest set of\nobjectives for the CompTIA Project+\n\n25\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.510\nis they've gotten rid of\nthe most complex formulas.\n\n26\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.356\nIn other words,\n\n27\n00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:33.539\nthe super in-depth formulas that really\nkind of make it mind numbingly complex.\n\n28\n00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.489\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that is because they've changed\n\n29\n00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:40.231\nthe direction of the scope of the way\nthat the CompTIA Project+ exam,\n\n30\n00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:42.540\nwho it's actually targeted to.\n\n31\n00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.300\nSo it doesn't mean that you don't\nhave to learn them in the future but\n\n32\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.960\nwhat it means, at least right now,\nis that you have to have at least a basic\n\n33\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.010\nunderstanding of the things that\nwe're gonna show you instead.\n\n34\n00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.680\nSo that's what we're gonna focus in on\nare those different smaller equations\n\n35\n00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.870\nthat all of us can really do in log times.\n\n36\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.910\nWe can even do it in our heads, or\nif you have a small calculator,\n\n37\n00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.970\nyou're ready to go, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.840\nSo let's take a look at terminologies\nthat we've seen at the end\n\n39\n00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.860\nof really a previous episode here.\n\n40\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.590\nWe talked about the idea of planned value,\nactual cost itself, and\n\n41\n00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.870\nthen the budget at completion, too.\n\n42\n00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.500\nSo we talked that the idea of planned\nvalue as being how much we had originally\n\n43\n00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.710\nplanned to spend for\nwhatever we were doing.\n\n44\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.420\nActual cost means how much\ndid you actually spend?\n\n45\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.920\nAnd then, of course, budget at completion,\n\n46\n00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.060\nwhat were you expecting to spend\nat the end of the project as well?\n\n47\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.900\nSo all those are fairly simple terms.\n\n48\n00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.270\nRemember that they are not\nthe official project management terms.\n\n49\n00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.460\nThey are kind of coming out directly\nright here, this particular brain itself.\n\n50\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.785\nAnd so that means I hope\nyou at least understand and\n\n51\n00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:46.840\ngrasp the concepts of what these terms\nare really trying to tell you, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.870\nNow the other thing that we also need\nto determine the majority of the time\n\n53\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.700\nis what we called earned value, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.575\nSo this is when we take the actual value\nof what we've actually completed and\n\n55\n00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:00.600\ncompare it to what we\nhad planned to spend.\n\n56\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.930\nAnd that will show you\nhow much value something\n\n57\n00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.897\nreally is at that point in\ntime in your project, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:06.897 --> 00:03:11.090\nSo whenever you see something like this,\n\n59\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.474\nit's never just straight-out an equation\nthat you're gonna end up seeing.\n\n60\n00:03:14.474 --> 00:03:18.670\nIt's always that you're going to be asked\nabout this either through your project\n\n61\n00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.370\nsponsor or somebody in your project\nwhere they are in terms of spending.\n\n62\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.750\nThat's probably the easiest\nexample that we'll use.\n\n63\n00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.900\nSo let's take a look at a couple of\nexamples of trying to determine earned\n\n64\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.050\nvalue, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.090\nSo go ahead and take a look at my computer\nscreen, and this will help us out.\n\n66\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.220\nAnd I kinda try to list it step by step so\n\n67\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.020\nthat we can understand\nwhat's happened,okay.\n\n68\n00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.065\nSo usually you'll see a scenario\nsomething fairly similar to this, okay.\n\n69\n00:03:44.065 --> 00:03:48.005\nIt's now at the end of the first week of\nwhatever work packages we're working on.\n\n70\n00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:54.080\nSo you can call it WBS 7.3.2 if you want,\nwhatever it might be, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.140\nAnd at this point you want to determine\nthe earned value of the work package so\n\n72\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.700\nfar, okay.\n\n73\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.220\nYou're also about a third of\nthe way through the work package.\n\n74\n00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.460\nYou know that you were\nbudgeted to only spend for\n\n75\n00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.341\nthe entire work package about $1,500.\n\n76\n00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:13.860\nWhat is your earned value?\n\n77\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.460\nOkay, so in other words, at that point,\n\n78\n00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.340\nwhat is the value of that entire work\npackage that you've got going on there?\n\n79\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.710\nSo the way that you do it is,\n\n80\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.550\nif you remember the overall definition\nhere, okay, of earned value,\n\n81\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.910\nis to be able to compare the value\nof work completed to that date\n\n82\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.220\ncompared to what you had budgeted for,\nwell, really that work package.\n\n83\n00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.870\nAnd what you need to do is, you need to\nunderstand there's two components involved\n\n84\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.530\nin the work package, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.150\nThe first of those two components\nof course, is the planned value.\n\n86\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.620\nWell, I can take a look in my particular\nquestion here, now this is where you do\n\n87\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.800\nhave to write down some numbers if\nyou're having a conversation, right.\n\n88\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.570\nWhere you take a look at\nthe planned value, and for us\n\n89\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.610\nyou know what you budgeted and\nonly spent, which is $1,500 for this.\n\n90\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.687\nAnd you also know you're about a third\nof the way through the work package.\n\n91\n00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:11.177\nSo I could round this up to,\nlet's say 33.333333%.\n\n92\n00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:15.620\nIf you're really trying to get technical,\nyou know it goes on forever, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.530\nBut for me,\nI'm just gonna round it down to 30% here,\n\n94\n00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.560\njust to make our math\na little bit simpler, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.150\nThe formula is sampled in,\nwhen you talk about earned value,\n\n96\n00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.250\nyou multiply the actual planned value\ntimes the percent of the work completed.\n\n97\n00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.828\nAnd for our sakes here that\nbreaks down to about $1,500 and\n\n98\n00:05:35.828 --> 00:05:38.135\nwe multiply that times 30%.\n\n99\n00:05:38.135 --> 00:05:41.474\nSo at the end of that first\nweek right now, okay,\n\n100\n00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:46.940\nmy work package is about a third of\nthe way through the entire work package.\n\n101\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.210\nSo for week number one,\nthis particular point in time,\n\n102\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.200\nmy earned value for\nthat work package is about $500, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.030\nSo fairly easy breakdown when you\ntake a look at earned value here.\n\n104\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.310\nDon't get me wrong, the percentage of\ncourse can change at any particular point.\n\n105\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.960\nIt could be 25%, it could be 17%,\n\n106\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.020\nif you want to, it's just you haven't\nactually multiplied those out.\n\n107\n00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.130\nSo having a calculator handy is\nreally going to help you to do this\n\n108\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.260\nif you need to.\n\n109\n00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.730\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, on some of the other\nCompTIA exams, I know you're not\n\n110\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.410\nallowed to use a calculator,\nwill that be the same for this exam also?\n\n111\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's very possible\n&gt;&gt; So if you are actually taking the exam\n\n112\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.270\nand you might actually notice on\nyour screen whether you might be\n\n113\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.920\ngiven a calculator button, well,\ntake a look at the calculator.\n\n114\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.805\nIf they believe that\nyou need a calculator,\n\n115\n00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:38.100\nthey're probably gonna\ngive you access to one.\n\n116\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.888\nBut if they sit there and say, look,\nthis is the stuff you should know,\n\n117\n00:06:40.888 --> 00:06:43.020\nit's probably not gonna count that way.\n\n118\n00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.402\nAnd because of that, the limitation\nthat you have on the exam, this time,\n\n119\n00:06:46.402 --> 00:06:49.418\nthe majority of the time it's\nprobably not gonna be like numbers.\n\n120\n00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:51.090\nI say it's not, okay.\n\n121\n00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.800\nThey could say, you spent $1,536.72, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.980\nYou are 27% into the project here.\n\n123\n00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.660\nWhat's my earned value?\n\n124\n00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.300\n&gt;&gt; You can do that on paper.\n\n125\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.010\nI am not kidding you.\n\n126\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.020\nYou can actually multiply that\nout on paper if you choose to.\n\n127\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.320\nBut usually a lot of times,\nbecause you're timed on it, right?\n\n128\n00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.570\nAnd they don't count on anybody's math\nskills being incredibly gigantic,\n\n129\n00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.740\nthey do usually give you enough time to do\nthat question and finish the entire exam.\n\n130\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.500\nSo I'm gonna say that you're probably\ngonna see more rounded numbers,\n\n131\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.010\nthan you're gonna see\nanything super technical.\n\n132\n00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.190\nI can't guarantee that,\n\n133\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.770\nbut I will tell you that usually that's\nbeen the case as far as I can remember.\n\n134\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.\n\n135\n00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.330\nAll right, so let's take a look at one\nmore example here, because even though\n\n136\n00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.930\nI showed you once, it doesn't mean that\nit will always sticks after one time.\n\n137\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.820\nSo let's take a look at earned\nvalue again with just a little\n\n138\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.350\nbit of a different scenario here, okay.\n\n139\n00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.681\nSo you're now near\nthe end of your project,\n\n140\n00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:52.038\nyour progress indicates\nthat you're about 93.5.\n\n141\n00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:56.916\nLook, it kind of added in that\n0.5 there to throw us off,\n\n142\n00:07:56.916 --> 00:08:00.248\nokay, 93.5% of the project here.\n\n143\n00:08:00.248 --> 00:08:04.176\nYou budgeted $75,000 for\nthe entire project.\n\n144\n00:08:04.176 --> 00:08:09.341\nYou want to determine the earned value,\nat 93.5%.\n\n145\n00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:10.101\nWell remember,\n\n146\n00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:14.260\nthe definition doesn't change even if\nthe number sizes has increased, okay.\n\n147\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.309\nWe still are working with the very\nsame components here, now though,\n\n148\n00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:24.027\nthe planned value so\nfar is the entire budget of $75,000.\n\n149\n00:08:24.027 --> 00:08:30.028\nAnd then, we actually have 93.5%,\nso our formula remains the same.\n\n150\n00:08:30.028 --> 00:08:36.301\nAnd now when you break that down to 75,000\nx 93.3% and actually works out to be\n\n151\n00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:41.417\nabout $70,000 at the project at\nthis particular point in time.\n\n152\n00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:43.344\nAnd you might wanna, wow,\nthat was kinda neat,\n\n153\n00:08:43.344 --> 00:08:45.820\nI have to work on the percentages\nto get that right.\n\n154\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.870\nBut I've tried to do it to\nmake sure that jumps in.\n\n155\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.890\nIt doesn't matter what the numbers\nare as long as you remember the formula,\n\n156\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.900\nplan value times the percentage complete.\n\n157\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this isn't like meant so.\n\n158\n00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.135\nWe're not trying to just\nhave these random scenarios.\n\n159\n00:08:59.135 --> 00:09:02.250\nCompTIA does provide the equations and\nRonnie is showing them to you so\n\n160\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.910\ndefinitely take heed of the notice here.\n\n161\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.269\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is one of the basic\nformulas in project manager.\n\n162\n00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:11.130\nYou just got to know these,\n\n163\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:16.400\nat least this one is the mini, I hate\nto say that, the bare minimum, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.840\nYou don't know anything else.\n\n165\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.470\nYou've gotta know what\nearned value actually means.\n\n166\n00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.950\nIf you don't, this is one of the project\nmanagement kids kind of snicker at you,\n\n167\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.815\nand point you out, and then separate\nyou from the rest of the group.\n\n168\n00:09:26.815 --> 00:09:30.170\nThat's pretty much it,\nif you don't know what earned value means.\n\n169\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.420\nYou might go, no that's me.\n\n170\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.299\nWell, learn.\n\n171\n00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:37.183\nLearn then they won't ostracize you off to\nthe project management with bad kids over\n\n172\n00:09:37.183 --> 00:09:38.639\nthere to do that, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:42.849\nAll right, now along with something like\nthis where we can find know what the value\n\n174\n00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:46.060\nof our project is at that\nparticular point in time.\n\n175\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.790\nWe also need formulas or again equations\nif you want to, I was calling formulas\n\n176\n00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:56.410\nhere, that help us to understand what we\ncall efficiency of our projects, okay.\n\n177\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.580\nBecause of the constraints,\n\n178\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.180\nthe triple constraints that\nwe normally talk at, right.\n\n179\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.340\nRequirements, okay or scope, okay,\ncost, right, or budget is also here.\n\n180\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.330\nAnd of course then the idea of time or\nschedule.\n\n181\n00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.030\nThose are our project constraints.\n\n182\n00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.160\nAnd so whenever you're talking about this,\nespecially we're gonna use\n\n183\n00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.250\nmoney again as our example, cuz that's\nthe easiest one for us to deal with here,\n\n184\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.230\nyou were always concerned about\nreally one thing, are we over budget?\n\n185\n00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.450\nAre we under budget?\n\n186\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:30.340\nOr are we actually doing our budget\nexactly as what we've tried to say\n\n187\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.030\nthat we are going to use?\n\n188\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.813\nSo you never know because sometimes along\nthe actual entire project itself, right?\n\n189\n00:10:36.813 --> 00:10:40.546\nYou might find yourself under budget for\nthe majority of your project.\n\n190\n00:10:40.546 --> 00:10:44.508\nYou're like, man we're gonna\nsave this much money and then,\n\n191\n00:10:44.508 --> 00:10:49.006\nat the last 7% of your project,\nokay, you might find out something.\n\n192\n00:10:49.006 --> 00:10:50.978\nYou blow the budget out of the water and\n\n193\n00:10:50.978 --> 00:10:54.150\nthen you are like why did\nthat end up happening, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.590\nWhat is it that we're doing here?\n\n195\n00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.850\nWhat ended up going on at\nthat trigger point in time?\n\n196\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.579\nAnd so it's weird cuz you\nmight trend yourself and\n\n197\n00:11:00.579 --> 00:11:04.990\ngo,okay, we're gonna finished this budget\nbelow cost and you tell them about that.\n\n198\n00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.520\nYeah we're great.\n\n199\n00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.400\nSo what we're gonna take a look at\nof course then are what it call\n\n200\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.570\nthe idea here of efficiency types\nof indicator to help us out and\n\n201\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.550\nthe way that we do this\nis in terms of variance.\n\n202\n00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.740\nWe're gonna look at cost variance and\nwe're gonna also take a look at schedule\n\n203\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.720\nvariance in a very simple example\nof what we're going to do, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.060\nCost variance is exactly\nlike it sounds here.\n\n205\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.540\nRemember that we actually have a budget.\n\n206\n00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.170\nWe actually do have what we plan to spend\nand then what you actually spent okay,\n\n207\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.700\nis what you have to kind of deal with.\n\n208\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.570\nSo in this one,\nlet's take a lot our scenario here, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.010\nYou're at the end of your project.\n\n210\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.490\nAt this point,\nyou're not completely finished, but\n\n211\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.450\nyou're pretty much at the end of it.\n\n212\n00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.270\nYou want to determine if your project is\nahead of schedule, or behind schedule,\n\n213\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.366\nor for us here, on cost, above or\nbeyond the budget, what?\n\n214\n00:11:53.366 --> 00:11:55.805\nOver budget,\nsee I can remember the word, okay?\n\n215\n00:11:55.805 --> 00:11:57.960\n&gt;&gt; It's all right.\n&gt;&gt; Over budget or below budget okay so\n\n216\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.400\nthat's what I get for\nnot editing completely here, okay.\n\n217\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.008\nOver budget or below budget okay.\n\n218\n00:12:03.008 --> 00:12:08.022\nYour earned value, now they give you\nearned value here and here it is.\n\n219\n00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:15.980\nIt's $70,000 and so far you've actually\nspent $71,000 for the whole budget.\n\n220\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.550\nCan you determine if the budget of the\nproject cost is higher than you expected\n\n221\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.300\nor lower than you expected here, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.490\nSo this is where we actually\nget our cost variance, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:27.800\nWhen we take a look at that and\n\n224\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:33.410\nmeasure the actual performance that we've\nhad to this date against the actual cost.\n\n225\n00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:38.388\nSo the great thing is, because we've\nalready been given what were actually\n\n226\n00:12:38.388 --> 00:12:42.430\nthe value of our budget or\nthe value our projects, excuse me,\n\n227\n00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.380\nat this particular point\nin time which is $70,000.\n\n228\n00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.530\nBut I've actually spent $71,000.\n\n229\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.190\nWell this is kind of the easiest\nformula in the world, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:59.601\nAll I need to do is I take my earned value\nand I subtract that what I actually spent.\n\n231\n00:12:59.601 --> 00:13:04.793\nAnd that gives me a cost variance\nof a negative $1,000, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:04.793 --> 00:13:08.340\nSo if I have something like,\nthat it's fairly simple, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.270\nIf the number is still in the positive,\n\n234\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:15.760\nit means that the cost right now\nis lower than I expected it to be.\n\n235\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.440\nBut if this number is negative right here,\nokay?\n\n236\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.710\nHopefully everybody can see that.\n\n237\n00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.000\nIf it's negative,\n\n238\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.800\nwell then this number right here is\nactually higher than I expect it to be.\n\n239\n00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.490\nSo this actually means that\nI'm gonna be over budget.\n\n240\n00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.400\nAgain, I kept the numbers simple by saying\n70,000, you've already spent 71,000 all\n\n241\n00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.140\nof us can pretty much do the basic math\non this one to help you out, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.050\nSo very important that we can determined\nthat even at the end of our project\n\n243\n00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.915\nto go okay, why did this happen?\n\n244\n00:13:44.915 --> 00:13:48.270\nWell then you go back and you take\na look at what you spend money on.\n\n245\n00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.178\nAnd at that point well since\nyou've already spent it,\n\n246\n00:13:50.178 --> 00:13:52.149\nit's not like you can go back and\nget operated anymore.\n\n247\n00:13:52.149 --> 00:13:53.590\n&gt;&gt; I wish that's how it worked.\n\n248\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.720\n&gt;&gt; But at least you can now tell\npeople that you ask we're going to be\n\n249\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.450\nover our cost and that way it can be\naccounted for it some point in time.\n\n250\n00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:06.390\nYou never want to have that answer like I\ncan't account for where that $1,000 went.\n\n251\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.080\nThat's when people start\nasking questions and\n\n252\n00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.857\nif you took a vacation during the project\nand forgot to put it back [LAUGH], yep.\n\n253\n00:14:13.857 --> 00:14:15.719\nSo there's an example of that.\n\n254\n00:14:15.719 --> 00:14:22.120\nSo do take a look at this idea and make\nsure you understand that concept again.\n\n255\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.190\nGreat thing is, all over the internet\nyou can actually use your favorite\n\n256\n00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.990\nsearch engine and\nthere is plenty of different examples for\n\n257\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.850\nyou to walk through and and to go through\nand be able to help you out, okay.\n\n258\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.930\nNow, because the form is fairly the same,\n\n259\n00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.130\nlet's take a look at the idea of\na scheduled variance here, okay.\n\n260\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.880\nSo notice that this one is kind\nof fairly the same here and\n\n261\n00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.990\nthe wording doesn't look a lot different.\n\n262\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.960\nNow, there's a reason why I\nshould chose something like this\n\n263\n00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.700\nbecause I know at least\nin my past experience,\n\n264\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.960\nI'm taking any type of\nprofessional certification exams.\n\n265\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.160\nThe questions never really\nseem to be that different,\n\n266\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.490\neven though they are asking you for\na different answer.\n\n267\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.875\nSo I wanted to show you something\nfairly realistic here when\n\n268\n00:15:01.875 --> 00:15:04.470\nyou're trying to prepare for\nthis day, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.970\nSo here it is.\n\n270\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.020\nYou're near the end of the project.\n\n271\n00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.670\nHey, that sounds familiar, okay.\n\n272\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.290\nYou want to determine if your\nproject is ahead of schedule or\n\n273\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.070\nbehind schedule, okay.\n\n274\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.640\nSo in the first one, mine should have\nactually said over budget or under budget.\n\n275\n00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.502\nAnd that was my fault there, okay.\n\n276\n00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:20.880\nBut this one is the right one, okay.\n\n277\n00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.558\nAhead of the schedule or\nbehind the schedule.\n\n278\n00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:25.500\nYour earned value is $70,000.\n\n279\n00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.310\nYour budget $75,000 for the whole project.\n\n280\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.314\nCan you determine if you're ahead or\n\n281\n00:15:30.314 --> 00:15:34.072\nif you are actually behind with\nthe information that you're given?\n\n282\n00:15:34.072 --> 00:15:37.993\nOkay, so at this particular\npoint when you do this right,\n\n283\n00:15:37.993 --> 00:15:41.288\nnow with the idea of a schedule variance,\nokay?\n\n284\n00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:44.597\nWe're still doing the same thing\nwe're given the earned value,\n\n285\n00:15:44.597 --> 00:15:47.907\nwe're given the planned value and\nit's still the subtraction,\n\n286\n00:15:47.907 --> 00:15:52.140\nthe earned values subtracted from planned\nvalue at this particular point in time.\n\n287\n00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:57.109\nAnd here is our variance right here\nwhich is the negative $5000, okay?\n\n288\n00:15:57.109 --> 00:16:01.469\nNow this also gives us that idea\nof the indicator here, okay.\n\n289\n00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:06.102\nWhether we're actually ahead of schedule\nor behind schedule You have the number as\n\n290\n00:16:06.102 --> 00:16:09.279\na positive number,\nthen you're ahead of schedule, and\n\n291\n00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:13.711\nthe idea is a negative number, then at\nthis point you are behind the schedule and\n\n292\n00:16:13.711 --> 00:16:17.021\nnormally if you're actually\nnear the end of your project,\n\n293\n00:16:17.021 --> 00:16:21.290\nyou are now screaming at people saying\nwhy are we actually behind schedule?\n\n294\n00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:25.060\nWe should never come to this point, so\neven though I say we're behind schedule,\n\n295\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:30.120\nyou should be taking this at least\nperiodically and not on a daily basis.\n\n296\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:36.370\nAt times when the time element is so\ncritical for you to be exactly on time and\n\n297\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:40.220\nthat way you know and you will,\nhow you determine the time base on money?\n\n298\n00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.280\nWell, it's not just based on money.\n\n299\n00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.290\nIs based on what?\n\n300\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.090\nThe earned value which really does tell us\n\n301\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:51.260\nhow much have we spent at this particular\npoint in time, or how much the project's\n\n302\n00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.680\nearned at this particular point\nin time in terms of the value?\n\n303\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.990\nWell that also includes how much time\nwe put in and the actual cost itself.\n\n304\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.970\nSo you can use that as\na measurement to even determine\n\n305\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.840\nschedule as well as cost, okay.\n\n306\n00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n307\n00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:11.190\n&gt;&gt; So those two are really what we call\nefficiency type of indicators okay.\n\n308\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.790\nNow when you start to do that, that's when\nyou start really managing your project\n\n309\n00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.060\nin terms of trying to get\neverybody on board here.\n\n310\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.730\nWe're over budget or\nwe are under budget or\n\n311\n00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.140\nwe're ahead of schedule or\nwe're behind schedule.\n\n312\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.180\nIt allows you to have a little bit lean\nway if you can start doing this and\n\n313\n00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.050\nthen you can determine based\non fairly small set of figures\n\n314\n00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.820\nwhether you need to push people\nhardly to get things done or\n\n315\n00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.130\nwhether you can kind of let it relax and\na little bit more, hey.\n\n316\n00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.860\nSo, those are actually\nsome of the key ones\n\n317\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.020\nthat you do have to pay attention to,\nokay?\n\n318\n00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't need all the extra\nstress if it's not necessary, right?\n\n319\n00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is true.\n\n320\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:53.120\nSo it actually does, it's what pushes\nyou to understand the idea of,\n\n321\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.760\nwhat would I call it?\n\n322\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.678\nEfficiency, I couldn't remember\nwhat I'm saying, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:04.020\nNow, last few formulas that we're gonna\ntake a look at are all about performance.\n\n324\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.750\nMore than anything else, okay.\n\n325\n00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:09.070\nNow performance had to deal with\na lot more than just the idea\n\n326\n00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.920\nof efficiency, okay.\n\n327\n00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.300\nIt had to deal with how true you are to\nthe plan and there are some different ones\n\n328\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.530\nthat we can take a look at, one minute,\ntalk about three basically.\n\n329\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.250\nWe're not gonna stress\nthese incredibly but\n\n330\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.720\nyou did need at least know\nthese all rough, okay.\n\n331\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.030\nThere's cost performance, there's\nscheduled performance, and then of course\n\n332\n00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:33.530\nthe two completion performance that we\nhave to actually think about here, okay.\n\n333\n00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.740\nSo here on the cost\nperformance is an index.\n\n334\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.420\nIn other words, it's always a ratio.\n\n335\n00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.810\nIt's what we're actually seeing here,\nokay?\n\n336\n00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.200\nSo you're near to the end of your project.\n\n337\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.530\nHey look, that sounds familiar, okay.\n\n338\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:49.130\nYou want to determine if your project cost\nare better than expected or not, okay.\n\n339\n00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.984\nYour earn value is $70,000,\nyou spent $71,000.\n\n340\n00:18:51.984 --> 00:18:57.150\nYou need to determine your\ncost performance index, okay.\n\n341\n00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.640\nIf it's actually better or worse than you\nexpected, so at this particular point\n\n342\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.100\nsince you know that an index means\nit's going to be a ratio of things,\n\n343\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.940\nthat means you're going to\nbe doing some division.\n\n344\n00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.500\nSo here it is we still have our earned\nvalue, we have our actual cost.\n\n345\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.480\n&gt;&gt; We take what we've learned,\nwe apply it there.\n\n346\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.290\n&gt;&gt; Yep and then you apply it.\n\n347\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.710\nInstead of actually subtracting\nwhich is what we did before\n\n348\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.280\nwe actually just use division.\n\n349\n00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.550\nSo in terms of ratio,\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n350\n00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.330\nIn the actual efficiencies,\nwe're just comparing what?\n\n351\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.020\nHere's what we actually did\nversus what we planned,\n\n352\n00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.100\nokay by just subtracting amount and\ngoing, hey here's the number.\n\n353\n00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.537\nBut now we're actually\ntrying to compare these.\n\n354\n00:19:33.537 --> 00:19:38.240\nSo 70,000 and you divide by 71,000.\n\n355\n00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.520\nAnd if the number that you\nget is greater than 1,\n\n356\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.810\nthen that means your cost at this point\nis better than you expected to be, okay.\n\n357\n00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.610\nSo if that ends up happening, in other\nwords that means the actual cost you spent\n\n358\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.260\nis lower than what you plan,\nthen absolutely.\n\n359\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:59.160\nYou are now saying, hey I am very much\nahead in terms of performance here or\n\n360\n00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.950\nworse than you expected, which means hey,\nthat I might actually over spend\n\n361\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:07.260\nway too much as well, so\nthat's what we are looking for as well.\n\n362\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:15.020\nAnd so, this one is absolutely gonna be\nless than one, 70,000 divided by 71,000.\n\n363\n00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.550\nSame thing on the schedule here okay, so\n\n364\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:23.660\nif you take a look at this one right now,\nI left this one of the answer as being\n\n365\n00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.970\nblank okay, because I want to\nmake sure that we understand.\n\n366\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:32.130\nIt's still the same process right,\nnotice again the very similar nature okay,\n\n367\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.850\nyou want to determine it's better or\n\n368\n00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.120\nworse 70,000 is your one\nvalue 75,000 is budgeted.\n\n369\n00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.990\nYou have to determine your\nschedule performance index.\n\n370\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.980\nAre you ahead or behind schedule, okay.\n\n371\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.330\nSo when you take a look at this it breaks\ndown to the same thing and all I'm really\n\n372\n00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:53.480\ntrying to determine is this number gonna\nbe greater than one or less than one.\n\n373\n00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.930\nYou don't have to actually\ndo the real math.\n\n374\n00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.600\nThat's why I'm actually trying to get you\nthrough this even on the exam, right?\n\n375\n00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.149\nAnd they are saying, the schedule\nperformance index doesn't indicate\n\n376\n00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:04.752\nthat you are ahead of schedule, or\nif you are behind, they are looking for\n\n377\n00:21:04.752 --> 00:21:08.030\neither if you are greater than one\njust take the number that you do.\n\n378\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:12.685\nSo you may not do 70,000 just do 70\ndivided by 71, if that number gives you\n\n379\n00:21:12.685 --> 00:21:17.100\ngreater than one, that means you\nare gonna be ahead of schedule.\n\n380\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.440\nIf it's less than one, then you know\nyou're behind, fairly easy, okay.\n\n381\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.240\nSo those are the very simple\nways that you can kind of,\n\n382\n00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.620\nif the numbers are scaring you in\nterms of the size of other numbers,\n\n383\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.700\nreduce some now specially there's\na bunch of zeros like these are, okay.\n\n384\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.950\nSo both class performance index and\nscheduled performance index.\n\n385\n00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.670\nAnd then-\n&gt;&gt; To completion performance index.\n\n386\n00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthen the completion performance, right?\n\n387\n00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.060\nYou want to determine if\nyou have to work harder or\n\n388\n00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.560\nnot try to meet your budget\nact completion, okay.\n\n389\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.690\nSo this is really one of those\nthings were you're saying,\n\n390\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.920\nlook I have this much\nleft to do on my project.\n\n391\n00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.070\nDo I need to try harder to meet my budget?\n\n392\n00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.470\nDo I not need to try\nharder to meet my budget?\n\n393\n00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.520\nAt this point here you\ncan actually do this.\n\n394\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.440\nNow this one requires a little bit more,\nokay?\n\n395\n00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.500\nBecause it requires you to\nsubtract a lot of different things\n\n396\n00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.500\nwith the earned value, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.550\nSo notice that the beginning here, it's\nstill a division but what you're doing is\n\n398\n00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:20.310\nyou're taking your budget at completion\nYou're subtracting your earned value.\n\n399\n00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.550\nSame thing then you're dividing\nthat by the budget at completion.\n\n400\n00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.200\nAnd you're subtracting\nyour actual cost as well.\n\n401\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.690\nThat gives you these numbers here.\n\n402\n00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.496\nYou got about $5,000 on this side.\n\n403\n00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:34.820\n$4,000 on this side.\n\n404\n00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.740\nAnd when you take a look at that\nparticular ratio when you do the division\n\n405\n00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.030\nhere 5 divided by 4, okay?\n\n406\n00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.550\nHopefully this is right,\nI don't know if that's right or not, but\n\n407\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.380\nthat's at least what I came up with here.\n\n408\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.570\nWhen you take a look at that\nparticular instance here,\n\n409\n00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:50.470\nthen you know it's all right.\n\n410\n00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.700\nIf this is 1, you're right on track.\n\n411\n00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.410\nSo it was 5,000 divided by 5,000,\n\n412\n00:22:55.410 --> 00:23:01.110\nyou came up with a 2 completion index is\n1, keep it the way you are going, okay?\n\n413\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:05.400\nIf it's greater than one you need\nto try harder in other words\n\n414\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.400\nyour kind of falling a bit\nbehind in terms of budget.\n\n415\n00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.840\nIf it's less than one,\nshouldn't say you should try easier, but\n\n416\n00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.440\nin other words it's saying that,\nyou are not doing anything wrong, but\n\n417\n00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.180\nyou kind of realize you can just\nrelax a little bit if you need to.\n\n418\n00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.260\nSo there's really a ton of\ndifferent aspects of this\n\n419\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.650\nthat you can take a look at and see.\n\n420\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.565\nNow, there are a lot more, okay.\n\n421\n00:23:29.565 --> 00:23:32.990\nJust when you go,\nRonnie you showed us five or six of them,\n\n422\n00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:37.560\nthere's probably 15 more we can go\nwhether we wanted to or not, okay?\n\n423\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.280\nAnd those actually again\na little bit more of\n\n424\n00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.730\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for that!\n\n425\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.854\n&gt;&gt; Estimate a completion to completion\nperformance index, you name it,\n\n426\n00:23:44.854 --> 00:23:45.900\nthere's a ton of them.\n\n427\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.480\nThere's just different ones that\nare actually available out there,\n\n428\n00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.520\ndepending on what you need to exactly see.\n\n429\n00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.660\nThese are kind of the basics, right?\n\n430\n00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.690\nSo remember the idea of efficiency.\n\n431\n00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.248\nRemember the, what was I saying?\n\n432\n00:23:57.248 --> 00:23:58.557\nEfficiency indicators, and\n\n433\n00:23:58.557 --> 00:24:01.498\nof course, performance indices\nhere that we've taken a look at.\n\n434\n00:24:01.498 --> 00:24:02.681\nThose are kind of the big ones.\n\n435\n00:24:02.681 --> 00:24:05.470\nAnd then how do you\ndetermine earned value?\n\n436\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:09.062\nWhy, every foreigner that we actually\nbased, everything that we've done off of,\n\n437\n00:24:09.062 --> 00:24:10.700\nyou have to determine earned value.\n\n438\n00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.823\nIf you don't know how to\ndetermine earned value,\n\n439\n00:24:12.823 --> 00:24:17.010\nyou may not be able to do any of\nthis on the exam as well, okay?\n\n440\n00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.178\nSo make sure you understand that.\n\n441\n00:24:18.178 --> 00:24:19.346\n&gt;&gt; Practice, practice.\n\n442\n00:24:19.346 --> 00:24:21.600\n&gt;&gt; Practice is pretty much the key here.\n\n443\n00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.639\nAll right, now, we do need to take a look\nat just a couple of other concepts that\n\n444\n00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:29.090\nare outside of us, we're just\ngonna talk about them right now.\n\n445\n00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.903\nSo instead of actually\nhaving to do the math,\n\n446\n00:24:31.903 --> 00:24:35.900\nthere are visual ways that you can\njust actually deal with the way\n\n447\n00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.877\nthat your project is also gonna be managed\na bit more efficiently if you want to.\n\n448\n00:24:40.877 --> 00:24:43.333\nAnd there is something that\nwe call a balanced scorecard,\n\n449\n00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:45.700\nCherokee have you heard of\nbalanced scorecard before?\n\n450\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.850\n&gt;&gt; I have, I had to actually create one.\n\n451\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:48.420\n&gt;&gt; Did you?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n452\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.483\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so on the balanced scorecard,\n\n453\n00:24:50.483 --> 00:24:54.092\nthis is kind of strange if you're\nnot in a role of project manager or\n\n454\n00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:57.647\nbusiness manager, change manager\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n455\n00:24:57.647 --> 00:25:00.775\nIf you're not in the realm\nof doing this type of stuff,\n\n456\n00:25:00.775 --> 00:25:05.535\nwhat you don't realize is that more than\n50% of gigantic companies essentially\n\n457\n00:25:05.535 --> 00:25:08.990\nadopt what were calling\nbalanced score card okay.\n\n458\n00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.825\nAnd this idea simply says,\nlook most companies before 1950,\n\n459\n00:25:12.825 --> 00:25:16.247\nthe only performance index\nthat they had was essentially,\n\n460\n00:25:16.247 --> 00:25:19.884\nat the other year did we make money,\ndid we not make money okay.\n\n461\n00:25:19.884 --> 00:25:23.850\nAnd then it was always well how we\ndo we improve on making more money.\n\n462\n00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.420\nBased only solely off of what,\nhow much did we do this year,\n\n463\n00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.590\nhow much do we want to increase next year,\nthat was it.\n\n464\n00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.040\nBut that's kind of as much as you can do\nthat right, you’re essentially trying to\n\n465\n00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.260\nbase your future off of what\nyou performed in the past.\n\n466\n00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.850\nAnd that can lead you to a point but\n\n467\n00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.100\nit can't lead you to actually\nconsider other things.\n\n468\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.044\nThe balanced score card\nessentially tells us, okay,\n\n469\n00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:50.149\nthat hey there are other factors that\nare actually included in this, okay.\n\n470\n00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:53.565\nSo a smart guy whose name was Dr.\nRobert Kaplan and Dr.\n\n471\n00:25:53.565 --> 00:25:57.723\nDavid Norton, make sure I actually\ntell you the right names here or\n\n472\n00:25:57.723 --> 00:26:00.570\npeople will go you don't\nknow who they are.\n\n473\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.122\nThese are the guys that essentially\ncame up with this idea,\n\n474\n00:26:03.122 --> 00:26:06.662\nsaying companies need to actually take\nmore into account than past performance.\n\n475\n00:26:06.662 --> 00:26:10.803\nWhich is all financial indicators can\nreally give you is how well you preformed\n\n476\n00:26:10.803 --> 00:26:12.410\nin the past, okay?\n\n477\n00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:17.710\nSo they developed in terms of a balanced\nscore card a measurement tool, okay.\n\n478\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:22.590\nThat allows you to add in\nnon-financial types of metrics okay,\n\n479\n00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.850\nto give you a more balanced view that\njust the financial metrics here.\n\n480\n00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.250\nSo normally when you have something like\nthis it allows you to take a look at\n\n481\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.930\nthe way that you gather metrics together,\nand who you gather metrics from and\n\n482\n00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.550\nhow you actually view them.\n\n483\n00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.000\nSo in an organization you're always\nsupposed to look, take a look at for\n\n484\n00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.710\nthe performance of the organization\nin four different views, okay.\n\n485\n00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.150\nFirst of course is\nthe perspective is learning and\n\n486\n00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.620\ngrowing within your organization, okay.\n\n487\n00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:55.590\nSo on this one, they take into the account\nhow are your employees training and\n\n488\n00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.700\nlearning when you start\nto take a look at this.\n\n489\n00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.870\nAnd what they're saying is that if your\nemployees are not training and learning,\n\n490\n00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.010\nwhat makes you expect that you're gonna\nhave a better performance next year,\n\n491\n00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:07.640\nyou're probably not.\n\n492\n00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.350\nThe other perspective is\na business process perspective\n\n493\n00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.150\nthat essentially tells the managers,\n\n494\n00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:18.740\nhow well is the business being run\nat this particular point in time.\n\n495\n00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.055\nSo you can actually take a lot\nof different metrics and\n\n496\n00:27:21.055 --> 00:27:23.020\na lot of different data points here.\n\n497\n00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.630\nAnd you can do surveys,\n\n498\n00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.555\nyou can do a lot of different things\nto kind of help you out here as well.\n\n499\n00:27:28.555 --> 00:27:30.997\nAnd that way you can actually verify and\n\n500\n00:27:30.997 --> 00:27:34.551\ntell from those metrics if\nthe business process itself.\n\n501\n00:27:34.551 --> 00:27:38.375\nSo we're not talking about how much many\nyou made but the business process itself.\n\n502\n00:27:38.375 --> 00:27:40.163\nCan it be run better, usually,\n\n503\n00:27:40.163 --> 00:27:44.515\nbut you're actually also giving yourself\nmetrics to help you to prove that.\n\n504\n00:27:44.515 --> 00:27:48.040\nCustomer's perspective as well, in other\nwords always look at performance from\n\n505\n00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.940\nyour customer's perspective, which is\ndeveloped around customer satisfaction.\n\n506\n00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.580\nAnd then financial perspective,\n\n507\n00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.290\nof course we never want to\ntake that out of the picture.\n\n508\n00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.630\n&gt;&gt; And for that customer service, we could\nalso use surveys for that to go ahead and\n\n509\n00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.610\ngather those metrics, right?\n\n510\n00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nsurveys is usually how we tend to do that.\n\n511\n00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:08.190\nOf course, you can say satisfaction and\nnormally that's what we do today, right.\n\n512\n00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.770\nIf you've ever rated anything on\n\n513\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.440\nbuying Amazon-\n&gt;&gt; Everywhere,\n\n514\n00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.071\nOutback to the car dealership.\n\n515\n00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:14.653\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n516\n00:28:14.653 --> 00:28:17.385\nit's amazing how much the people\ntake that into consideration and\n\n517\n00:28:17.385 --> 00:28:20.520\nthe strange thing is you might think\nlike when does this really get started?\n\n518\n00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.596\nIt really got started about 1950 but\nit really didn't hit big until these guys\n\n519\n00:28:24.596 --> 00:28:27.650\nkind formalized it into\nthat balanced score card.\n\n520\n00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.860\nSo organizations, essentially what they\ndo is they break up a sheet of paper and\n\n521\n00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.320\ndo four different categories here.\n\n522\n00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.442\nAnd they write certain\nquestions about them, and\n\n523\n00:28:35.442 --> 00:28:37.016\nsay hey how does this flow together?\n\n524\n00:28:37.016 --> 00:28:41.240\nSo they can get a better balanced view\nof how to make things perform better.\n\n525\n00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.450\nAnd you can do the same thing\nwith your project as well as you\n\n526\n00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.050\nactually start managing them too.\n\n527\n00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.470\nSo, you wanna take a look at that and\n\n528\n00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:51.690\nmake sure you kind of do a little\nbit more research on that.\n\n529\n00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:55.096\nThe last tool, actually the last\ntwo tools we're gonna talk about.\n\n530\n00:28:55.096 --> 00:28:57.928\nWe've already talked about one\nthat we called the RACI or\n\n531\n00:28:57.928 --> 00:29:02.030\nR-A-C-I but let's talk about another\none that we call SWOT analysis.\n\n532\n00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.530\nLet's take a look at my screen here and\n\n533\n00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.050\nwe'll talk about this one just briefly,\ntoo.\n\n534\n00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:11.770\nSWOT analysis essentially allows you and\nyour team to come together and then look\n\n535\n00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.470\nat your company or your particular project\nor your team, whatever you want to do.\n\n536\n00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.810\nAnd assess it, okay,\nbased on strengths, weaknesses,\n\n537\n00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.290\nopportunities and threats, okay?\n\n538\n00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.630\nEven though it's a two-by-two metric,\nyou'll see on the left hand side\n\n539\n00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:29.970\nthere's strengths and opportunities, right\nhand side weaknesses and threats, okay.\n\n540\n00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:36.150\nNow, I also put inside of parenthesis\nhere some verbs, okay, that\n\n541\n00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:40.540\nhelp you to understand what it is you're\nsupposed to do with these things, okay.\n\n542\n00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.600\nSo it's simple,\n\n543\n00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.600\nwhat we can do here is we actually\ntake a look at ourselves as a team.\n\n544\n00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.467\nAnd we do a SWOT analysis here, we should,\nall of us, be able to list strength,\n\n545\n00:29:50.467 --> 00:29:52.371\ntake a look at a weakness here.\n\n546\n00:29:52.371 --> 00:29:56.719\nAnd you don't actually want, you can,\nyou don't wanna list somebody's name, but,\n\n547\n00:29:56.719 --> 00:30:00.030\nI guess, you could if you wanted to,\nan opportunity and a threat.\n\n548\n00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:01.250\nDon't list somebody's name again,\n\n549\n00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.820\nthey get a little bit paranoid if you\nlist them as a weakness and a threat.\n\n550\n00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:09.060\n&gt;&gt; And we can see from just looking at\nthis diagram that it's pretty useful in\n\n551\n00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:14.540\nthe sense that you're forced to go ahead\nand identify those threats and weaknesses.\n\n552\n00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.520\nAnd what's kind of cool, Ronnie,\nis you can also use these tools to apply\n\n553\n00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.769\nthem to your personal life too-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes you can-\n\n554\n00:30:20.769 --> 00:30:21.850\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's true.\n\n555\n00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.300\nEven like the Pareto chart that\nyou showed us in episode one,\n\n556\n00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.380\nyou can even look at your expenses, and\nplot them out to see where the majority.\n\n557\n00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.815\nWe look at that 80-20 rule and\n\n558\n00:30:29.815 --> 00:30:32.830\nsee that the majority of your money\nis actually going to budgeting.\n\n559\n00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.860\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt that a lot of\nthese principles that we learn about in\n\n560\n00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.750\nterms of managing for\norganizations and projects.\n\n561\n00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:43.370\nThey can be applied personally, and\nyou do tend to see that it goes both ways.\n\n562\n00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.240\nYou might find something very interesting\nin the way that you do efficiency, and\n\n563\n00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.560\nthe way that you measure it,\n\n564\n00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.590\nmight actually also apply to\nthe entire project as well.\n\n565\n00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.260\nSo these types of analysis and\nthese types of tools are very helpful,\n\n566\n00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:59.120\nbecause they really do fill in the gap\nto just about everything else that we\n\n567\n00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.118\ndo here that really gives\nus the data that we need.\n\n568\n00:31:02.118 --> 00:31:04.730\nAnd now once you have all that\nstuff together you collate it and\n\n569\n00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.980\nyou put it together.\n\n570\n00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.712\nAnd then that's when you actually use\nthose verbs on whether you're gonna\n\n571\n00:31:08.712 --> 00:31:11.153\nmaintain something,\nwhether you're going to abandon or fix it.\n\n572\n00:31:11.153 --> 00:31:15.230\nWhether you're going to prioritize or\nwhether you're gonna counter it somehow.\n\n573\n00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.010\nSo remember that it's not just\nthe idea of listing them there so\n\n574\n00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.360\nthat we can see them.\n\n575\n00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.130\nIt's the idea of listing in there so\n\n576\n00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:25.260\nthat we can do something about it to\nhelp us to actually be better, okay.\n\n577\n00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.996\nNow the last one we've already gone\nthrough what we call a RACI chart and\n\n578\n00:31:28.996 --> 00:31:31.730\nthat's usually how I pronounce it, right.\n\n579\n00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.832\nResponsibility, accountability,\nconsulting and informing.\n\n580\n00:31:35.832 --> 00:31:39.197\nAnd it's is simple chart that actually\nsays that for any work package that\n\n581\n00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:43.051\nwe go through, we'll make sure that we\nunderstand who's actually responsible for\n\n582\n00:31:43.051 --> 00:31:44.590\nit, who's accountable for it.\n\n583\n00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.062\nWho are we actually informing about it and\n\n584\n00:31:47.062 --> 00:31:50.320\nof course who are we actually\ngoing to consult as well.\n\n585\n00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.210\nI kinda did it out of order there,\n\n586\n00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.760\nbut we've already taken a look\nat that in an earlier episode.\n\n587\n00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.593\nRemember that each one of those\nare actually very important for\n\n588\n00:31:58.593 --> 00:31:59.505\na project manager.\n\n589\n00:31:59.505 --> 00:32:04.578\nSo that when somebody says,\nhey we need to something about this, we\n\n590\n00:32:04.578 --> 00:32:10.547\nsimply go to our particular project plan,\nand we pull out our RACI matrix here.\n\n591\n00:32:10.547 --> 00:32:14.221\nAnd that way we can look exactly\nat the work package breakdown,\n\n592\n00:32:14.221 --> 00:32:16.103\nthe work breakdown structure.\n\n593\n00:32:16.103 --> 00:32:19.843\nFigure out what that number is and\nactually see, all right, who's responsible\n\n594\n00:32:19.843 --> 00:32:23.980\nfor this and then go and make the decision\nor inform whoever needs to be informed.\n\n595\n00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.570\nThat's something that's happening with\nthat particular work package as well.\n\n596\n00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.590\nSo you do have so\nmany tools at your advantage.\n\n597\n00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:35.620\nThe problem is it can be overwhelming\nbecause this particular area of\n\n598\n00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.230\nin terms of project management,\nit's constantly changing.\n\n599\n00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.270\nThe tools are constantly being updated.\n\n600\n00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:44.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, in real life land,\nwe have the interweb, but\n\n601\n00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:48.225\non the exam unfortunately we\nneed to know the specific tools.\n\n602\n00:32:48.225 --> 00:32:50.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so those are very important.\n\n603\n00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.960\nSo everything that we've gone\nover in these episodes here\n\n604\n00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.200\non just comparing the tools,\nit really is helpful.\n\n605\n00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.790\nIt's a lot of times where you can see\nwhere this is good testable material.\n\n606\n00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.885\nJust to see if you know which of these\ntools you need to use at a particular\n\n607\n00:33:02.885 --> 00:33:04.670\npoint in time in your project.\n\n608\n00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.050\nIt's gonna help you out as well.\n\n609\n00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.890\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie, I think you've given\nus a really great place to start.\n\n610\n00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.400\nWe have more than enough tools that we can\napply and we need to know for the exam.\n\n611\n00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.665\nBut we can also perhaps use\nthem in that real life land.\n\n612\n00:33:15.665 --> 00:33:17.048\nSo thank you guys for tuning in.\n\n613\n00:33:17.048 --> 00:33:19.154\nWe have more Project+ coming your way.\n\n614\n00:33:19.154 --> 00:33:21.382\nI'm Cherokee Boose\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n615\n00:33:21.382 --> 00:33:23.112\n&gt;&gt; Signing off have a great one.\n\n616\n00:33:23.112 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:16.674\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n4\n00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:20.251\nIn this episode we'll be\nanalyzing some project documents.\n\n5\n00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:24.060\nThere a lot of documents to shift\nthrough out the duration of you project.\n\n6\n00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.700\nSo to help us with that we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.380\nThank you for being with us today Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.930\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.800\nhaving me back in the show as we continue\non more complicate project plus.\n\n10\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.770\n&gt;&gt; We talk about the idea of analyzing\nour project documentation but\n\n11\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.550\nwe wanna make sure that we understand as\nwhat are the necessarily elements that\n\n12\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.315\nnormally you find inside of that project\ndocumentation and what is our take away.\n\n13\n00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:48.415\n&gt;&gt; We're really just getting started,\nwhat do we need to understand and\n\n14\n00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.845\nwhy is this particular document\ngonna be very important for\n\n15\n00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:53.815\nus as we start to manage projects.\n\n16\n00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:55.495\nSo we're gonna take a look at, well a lot.\n\n17\n00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:57.111\nI think Cherokee counted, was it 11 or 12?\n\n18\n00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:57.850\n&gt;&gt; 11, yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.685\n&gt;&gt; 11, so we're gonna talk\nabout 11 of them very briefly.\n\n20\n00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:04.595\nWe're gonna show some of them, we're not\ngonna show all of them because sometimes\n\n21\n00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:07.690\njust showing all of them,\nthey just look like forms after a while.\n\n22\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.360\nSo we're just gonna show a few of them so\nthat we understand what we have.\n\n23\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.700\nSo when a project begins overall,\n\n24\n00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.950\nthe clear understanding is\nfrom the initiation phase.\n\n25\n00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.195\nThe only way we get started\ninto the project itself,\n\n26\n00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:26.180\nessentially is good for\nus to have a project charter, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.990\nNow normally we start\ntaking project charter\n\n28\n00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.880\nthere is a lot of information\nwe can include in there.\n\n29\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.780\nHere is an example of what we\ncreated a while ago here at ITProTV.\n\n30\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.480\nWhere you tend to have\nthe title of sponsor name and\n\n31\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.920\nthe project manager,\nas well as when this was prepared.\n\n32\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.570\nYou might see all this\ninformation as well.\n\n33\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.610\nThe purpose or justification why in\nthe world is this project needed.\n\n34\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.700\n&gt;&gt; So this part needs to\nbe pretty specific, right?\n\n35\n00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.190\nWe should include things\nlike our projected ROI,\n\n36\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.330\nwhat exactly we're doing here.\n\n37\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.410\nThe definition.\n\n38\n00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're actually trying to make\nsure that everybody understands that and\n\n39\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.500\nso even though we actually put\na small box in here, this could take\n\n40\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.210\npages if you wanted them to fill\nout every single little detail, and\n\n41\n00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.770\ndepending on your need you may actually\nchoose to have something like that.\n\n42\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.470\nIf your project is fairly simple,\n\n43\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.370\nit might actually be able to be put\ninto these little boxes as well.\n\n44\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.640\nYou need to have an understanding of\ncourse, of the High-Level Risks and\n\n45\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.210\nof the overall objectives that you\nhave to be able to understand as well.\n\n46\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.510\nYou might even have milestone.\n\n47\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.970\nNow not everything here is actually going\n\n48\n00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.810\nto necessarily be an every\nsingle project chartered.\n\n49\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.860\nBut when it comes down to it,\n\n50\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.630\nwhen you start seeing all these different\ncategories, manager level authority.\n\n51\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.900\nThis depends on if your\norganization has balanced matrix or\n\n52\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.210\nis it projectized or\nis this a functional type of organization.\n\n53\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.210\nStaffing decisions,\nwho's actually gonna be making those?\n\n54\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.930\nBut really when it comes down to it,\n\n55\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.370\nthe most important element is\nright here at the end, okay.\n\n56\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.710\nGetting the whole thing started and\nunderstand why this particular\n\n57\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.270\nproject exists, and\nunderstanding what all the risks are.\n\n58\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.170\nAll the stuff we that we solved\ndon’t get me wrong is important but\n\n59\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.440\nthe most important element\nis right here okay.\n\n60\n00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.290\nIf you do not get a signature despite all\nof your work in the initiation phase of\n\n61\n00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.700\ngenerating everything else this\ndoes not count as a project charter\n\n62\n00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.050\nthat's the scariest thing in the world.\n\n63\n00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.070\nIs that at the very end of all of\nyour hard work during that time.\n\n64\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.550\nWhen nothing else is going on, and you've\nplanned out at least and take a look on\n\n65\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.079\neverything in your project, without this\n&gt;&gt; You must get that approval.\n\n66\n00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.305\n&gt;&gt; You must have the approval or\nit's not a project.\n\n67\n00:03:35.305 --> 00:03:39.330\nSo, very strange to actually\nhave to do as much work\n\n68\n00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.502\nto get to getting a project done.\n\n69\n00:03:41.502 --> 00:03:47.030\nThen to actually have a project done\nsometimes but it can, it can actually stop\n\n70\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.550\nright here, where you failed to actually\nget up ending the sponsor who actually has\n\n71\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.490\nthat authority and that approval,\nthat then begins the process at that\n\n72\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.940\npoint then you can start to now move\nin to claiming the project itself.\n\n73\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.300\nSo that is by far the key\n\n74\n00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.880\nelement that we also want to make\nsure that we understand here, okay.\n\n75\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.010\nNow, when we have this, okay,\n\n76\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.950\nthat means we can assume move our project\nplan at that particular point and\n\n77\n00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.640\neven though in our original charter,\nlet me see if she have it in here, yeah.\n\n78\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.080\nWe have that purpose and that\njustification but the strange thing is, as\n\n79\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.510\nmuch as this is a high level overview of\nwhat the project is and who's responsible\n\n80\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.640\nfor it okay, notice that it really\ndoesn't tell us what the project does.\n\n81\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.260\nIt justifies the project existing, it\njustifies the very fact that we need it,\n\n82\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.110\nit tells us what the risks are.\n\n83\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.210\nBut the very fact is, it really\ndoesn't tell us what is this project\n\n84\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.160\nactually meant to do and\nwhat is it not designed to do in itself.\n\n85\n00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.770\nAnd so that is when we actually have to\nmove on to another part that begins in\n\n86\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.460\nplanning stage, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.840\nNow, I don't have an example\nof an entire project plan,\n\n88\n00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.070\nbecause that can actually take hundreds\nof pages, maybe even thousands of pages.\n\n89\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.820\nDepending on the way that everything is\nset up, but a lot of times she comes into\n\n90\n00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.140\na bound book, you know, a full year\nproject or a three ring binder or\n\n91\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.840\nwhatever it might be or the entire\nproject plan will rest within that\n\n92\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.960\ncontainer or codex that you end up having.\n\n93\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.430\nBut in that sence that's pretty good but\none of the first elements that you also\n\n94\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.770\nend up making that low is what we call\na project scope statement, all right.\n\n95\n00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.550\nSo in a project scope statement,\n\n96\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.140\nthis where you start describing what\nthe project is going to deliver.\n\n97\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.330\nAnd the work that's required to\ncreate those deliverables, okay.\n\n98\n00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.040\nSo that is really kind of the key\nwhen you start to do this.\n\n99\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.470\nAnd you might be wondering where\nthe heck do this forms come from,\n\n100\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.000\nif you're doing this right?\n\n101\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.830\nSo as a project manager a lot\nof times when you start off\n\n102\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.420\nespecially in large office as\na project management office,\n\n103\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.990\nyou might find out they already\nhave templates for you to fill in.\n\n104\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.740\nThis is an example of a template.\n\n105\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.770\nIf you're not exactly sure\nwhat needs to go in here?\n\n106\n00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.050\nIt only gives you the purpose beyond this,\n\n107\n00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.750\nallows you to be able to do\neverything else here too.\n\n108\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.780\nSo notice that it actually\nenables the project team,\n\n109\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.100\nlet me see if I can zoom in here, okay.\n\n110\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.310\nIt enables the project team to\nperform a more detailed planning,\n\n111\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.500\nguides the project teams\nwork varying the execution.\n\n112\n00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.380\nProvides a baseline for\nevaluating whether request or changes or\n\n113\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:40.430\nany additional work contained within or\noutside of the projects boundaries okay.\n\n114\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.450\nSo it really does provide all of that for\nus and so when we start,\n\n115\n00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.740\nwe want to make sure this is one of\nthe very first things that we work on.\n\n116\n00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.810\nIs to identify the scope,\nthe limitation of our project.\n\n117\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.080\nIf not this is when the project does\nessentially become like wedding.\n\n118\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.670\nStarts off very small in mind but\nit continues to grow and grow and grow,\n\n119\n00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.470\nthe project scope is the single\ndocument that actually says,\n\n120\n00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.200\nhere's the limitations of this project.\n\n121\n00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.630\nIt's not designed to do everything.\n\n122\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.290\nIt essentially says,\n\n123\n00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.120\nhere's areas we're not gonna do, here's\nwhat we're actually focused in on doing,\n\n124\n00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.650\nand so, that's what you'll actually\nalso end up seeing here too.\n\n125\n00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.650\nSo, notice they describe,\nin terms of requirements, boundaries,\n\n126\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.860\nthe deliverables, is there\nan acceptance criteria, milestones, and\n\n127\n00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.360\nso, even though these are, kinda,\nfill in on a single page, right.\n\n128\n00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.860\nThis can of course take pages and\npages and pages too.\n\n129\n00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.670\nBut when it comes down to it, the whole\ngoal is to understand what is really\n\n130\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.388\ngonna be about the project boundaries and\n\n131\n00:07:45.388 --> 00:07:50.609\nthe requirements that we need to have\nthose are kinda most important elements.\n\n132\n00:07:50.609 --> 00:07:53.920\nThe other one's really do help you and\nplanning out the rest,\n\n133\n00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.122\nso you might go ahead and let's say you\ndefine the actual Project Requirements\n\n134\n00:07:58.122 --> 00:08:02.454\nhere with the definition understanding And\nthen, you define the boundaries and\n\n135\n00:08:02.454 --> 00:08:05.000\nthen at that point,\nyou have to go through, and\n\n136\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.640\nnow this is where they\ntalk about the basic plan.\n\n137\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.860\nWell, what's next?\n\n138\n00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.790\nYou define the project boundary.\n\n139\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.780\nYou also take a look at what\nare the acceptance criterias and\n\n140\n00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.080\nyou start planning those things out.\n\n141\n00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.330\nWithout the scope statement,\n\n142\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.430\nvery difficult to plan out a project\nif you don't know what it's actual\n\n143\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.940\nrequirements are, if you don't\nknow what the implementations are.\n\n144\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.430\nSo this is kind of the first element in\nthe entire project plan that can now spend\n\n145\n00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.340\nlike a hundreds and not even a thousand of\npages depending on how big the project.\n\n146\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.080\nIt could just be 50 pages,\nit could be 10 pages.\n\n147\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.080\nI got a small project, it will just be\na page like this if you choose to, but\n\n148\n00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.830\ndocumentation is important,\nespecially in a larger organization.\n\n149\n00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.810\nOnce you have these things and\n\n150\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.620\nyou continue on, you'll start\nseeing that all the other smaller\n\n151\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.850\nplans you have inside of your project\nplan, they'll need to be approved.\n\n152\n00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:55.500\nAnd then, finally,\n\n153\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.730\nthe overall project plan itself\nwill need to be approved as well.\n\n154\n00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.992\nAnd that's when you get ready for\nthe execution phase of your project.\n\n155\n00:09:03.992 --> 00:09:06.344\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nyou mentioned that you could go ahead and\n\n156\n00:09:06.344 --> 00:09:08.310\nif your organization already have some.\n\n157\n00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.840\nYou might be able to use a previous\none as an example a template, but\n\n158\n00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.020\nif your company doesn't then\nyou can always hop online.\n\n159\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.660\nIn the US, even I6 Sigma has a ton\nof different templates online.\n\n160\n00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.590\nIn the UK, there's a PRINCE2,\njust look at the online resources,\n\n161\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.060\nthen that's what the Internet is for.\n\n162\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.482\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of them that you can\nactually to help you to find that, but\n\n163\n00:09:31.482 --> 00:09:34.051\nwhatever company you end up working for,\nyou apply,\n\n164\n00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:37.046\nalso have to follow what they\nchoose to follow and [INAUDIBLE].\n\n165\n00:09:37.046 --> 00:09:38.094\n&gt;&gt; Right, trumps the, yeah.\n\n166\n00:09:38.094 --> 00:09:40.120\n&gt;&gt; It trumps all the other organization.\n\n167\n00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.616\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All these other ones are really-\n\n168\n00:09:41.616 --> 00:09:43.540\n&gt;&gt; They can give you a good idea.\n\n169\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.232\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a standard.\n\n170\n00:09:44.232 --> 00:09:48.720\nIt's an industry type of standard that\nwe really do need to think about.\n\n171\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.840\nBut when it comes down to\nwhat your organization wants,\n\n172\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.540\nit does tend to trump the standard\nidea of that's the bare minimum,\n\n173\n00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.970\nthat's the way that a lot of organizations\nwere set, here's what we have to meet.\n\n174\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.060\nBut then they may actually require more.\n\n175\n00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.432\nSo along with that in the project lined\nup, that big, gigantic notebook of things,\n\n176\n00:10:08.432 --> 00:10:10.290\nthat was the word I was looking for.\n\n177\n00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.037\nI kept calling the codex.\n\n178\n00:10:11.037 --> 00:10:15.258\nNotebook that you are looking for,\nyou might also of course have\n\n179\n00:10:15.258 --> 00:10:19.795\nan organization chat to show that\nyou have a graphic understanding,\n\n180\n00:10:19.795 --> 00:10:24.325\nare the actual hierarchy in terms\nof authorities and your project.\n\n181\n00:10:24.325 --> 00:10:27.320\nSo in this sense when you\nstart to take a look at that,\n\n182\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.850\norganizational charts can be included.\n\n183\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.610\nUsually it is a great idea to have one\nespecially if you have a lot of people\n\n184\n00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.646\nthat don't know exactly what\nthe lines of authority are.\n\n185\n00:10:36.646 --> 00:10:40.575\nUsually this really does help\nthe inside of the project plan, so\n\n186\n00:10:40.575 --> 00:10:42.550\neverybody has a page to flip to.\n\n187\n00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.690\n&gt;&gt; And even at minimum, on your project\ncharter, at least the ones that I've done,\n\n188\n00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:51.110\nyou at least wanna put the higher ups on\nthere, like your sponsors, your champions,\n\n189\n00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.810\nproject manager on\nthe project charter itself.\n\n190\n00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.780\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nit's really important because it does.\n\n191\n00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.550\nAnybody that gets a copy of that project\nplan, whether they're unsure of the nature\n\n192\n00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:06.790\nor you know the lines of authority,\nthis will help them to get that straight.\n\n193\n00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.940\nSo the neat thing is most of the time\nyou don't have to worry about\n\n194\n00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.660\na lot of these are much the only one\ngenerating all the documentation.\n\n195\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.160\nIf I find out that your project\nmanagement office would\n\n196\n00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.520\nyou get everything approve and started.\n\n197\n00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.261\nThey'll go ahead and print out\nessentially your project plan and\n\n198\n00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:27.614\nthe organizational chart where your\nname actually does list itself as being\n\n199\n00:11:27.614 --> 00:11:29.858\nthe project manager on some project and\n\n200\n00:11:29.858 --> 00:11:33.891\nthat way you actually know exactly\nwhat's going on for you there too.\n\n201\n00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:37.613\n&gt;&gt; And John in the chat mentioned socks,\nbut that's a good thing to remember as\n\n202\n00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:41.522\nwell if you have any kinda regulatory\ncompliancies like the Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\n203\n00:11:41.522 --> 00:11:45.180\nSo you just have to check with them,\nsee what information should be included.\n\n204\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.711\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n205\n00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:46.801\nRemember, of course,\n\n206\n00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:50.018\nany type of regulatory compliance\nissues that you have to go through.\n\n207\n00:11:50.018 --> 00:11:51.552\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be trumping as well.\n\n208\n00:11:51.552 --> 00:11:53.358\n&gt;&gt; It is gonna trump no matter what.\n\n209\n00:11:53.358 --> 00:11:57.925\nAnd normally you tend to deal\nwith that more in the realm\n\n210\n00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:01.720\nof when you have publicly\ntraded companies.\n\n211\n00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.843\nEspecially in the Sarbanes-Oxley thing.\n\n212\n00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:08.727\nIf you're dealing with the health care,\nof course, then you'll be talking about\n\n213\n00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:10.440\nthe idea of the-\n&gt;&gt; HIPAA.\n\n214\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.330\n&gt;&gt; HIPAA compliance stuff.\n\n215\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.048\nBut all the time,\nanytime there's compliance issues,\n\n216\n00:12:16.048 --> 00:12:18.681\nall that may actually have to go ahead and\n\n217\n00:12:18.681 --> 00:12:23.510\nbe worked in to think about that\nidea as well inside of the plan.\n\n218\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.560\nRemember that we've also taken a look\nat communications plans as well.\n\n219\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.910\nNow, this is where it gets\na little bit unusual.\n\n220\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.630\nWhere people that have not been\nproject managers in the past,\n\n221\n00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.280\nwhere they do get confused about things\nlike, everybody knows how to communicate,\n\n222\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.660\nthat's not what we're talking about.\n\n223\n00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.300\nWe're talking about managing the formal\ncommunications within the project.\n\n224\n00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.470\nRemember that there has to be some\ntype of methodology in which we say,\n\n225\n00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.150\nhere is the formal way in which\nthe work that needs to be accomplished\n\n226\n00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.840\nwhere we're gonna use\nthat particular system?\n\n227\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.970\nWhere we're gonna actually\nhave that in place?\n\n228\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.800\nSo that we know exactly\nwhat's going on and\n\n229\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.200\nwe can control the information,\nas what you have.\n\n230\n00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.390\nSo you also have a communications\nplan also in there.\n\n231\n00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.620\nAnd that usually is gonna involve\nagainst so many different technologies.\n\n232\n00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.530\nMy recommendation is go back and\ntake a look at where Cherokee and\n\n233\n00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.705\nI did talk about-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you showed us that earlier.\n\n234\n00:13:15.705 --> 00:13:18.586\n&gt;&gt; Different methods,\nof the communications and\n\n235\n00:13:18.586 --> 00:13:20.660\nyour organizations again.\n\n236\n00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.770\nTrying to pick what\nparticular methodology and\n\n237\n00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.380\nthen why they have actually\nmight choose to use one.\n\n238\n00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.910\nOr another is also going\nto help us out too.\n\n239\n00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:35.560\nNow, once you get kind of the basics of\nthe leg we are done in terms of compliance\n\n240\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:42.140\nissues, scope management, communications\nplan, so a lot of it is paperwork.\n\n241\n00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.690\nDon't get me wrong,\na ton of it is paperwork.\n\n242\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.850\nThis is where you are gonna work more\nclosely with you're projects scheduler and\n\n243\n00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.120\nyour project coordinator.\n\n244\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.190\nAnd also as a project manager to get thing\nlike you're work break-down structure in\n\n245\n00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.710\nplace, to ensure that you\nhave a available resources.\n\n246\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:05.090\nAnd to ensure that you can schedule out\nthe actual project in the time that's\n\n247\n00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:10.050\nrequired for you to take a look at it and\nto be able to manage the whole thing.\n\n248\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.160\nSo when you start talking about\nthree people are trying to do this,\n\n249\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.140\nat least three and\nnot entire departments trying do this,\n\n250\n00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.400\nyou might find yourself actually\nscheduling and you might find\n\n251\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.180\nan incredible schedule going on to now\nwhere it's almost impossible to track.\n\n252\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.350\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n253\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:31.870\nSo here it is, I have a management\nplan here and this one is just for\n\n254\n00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:36.290\nsome type of commercial construction\nas what this one is actually for.\n\n255\n00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.800\nAnd you can see that this particular\noverall plan here, let me zoom out for\n\n256\n00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.370\na moment, my mouse got stuck here.\n\n257\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.682\nThis particular commercial construction\nplant is overall duration for\n\n258\n00:14:48.682 --> 00:14:53.122\nthe project that's really\nabout 334 days scheduled to go\n\n259\n00:14:53.122 --> 00:14:56.256\ninto the last day of February in 2018 so\n\n260\n00:14:56.256 --> 00:15:01.583\nyou can imagine that this pretty hefty\nhere, as far the size of project.\n\n261\n00:15:01.583 --> 00:15:08.066\nNow, I've never been on a project\nthat lasted 344 days in duration.\n\n262\n00:15:08.066 --> 00:15:13.040\nBut essentially going from the end of\n2016 all the way through the first part\n\n263\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.010\nof 2018, that's a year and\nwhat, for, 5 months?\n\n264\n00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:17.840\nYeah, somewhere like that.\n\n265\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.683\nI don't know, I can't count.\n\n266\n00:15:18.683 --> 00:15:23.390\nBut that's a long time that should\nbe working on a single project.\n\n267\n00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.280\nAll of mine have pretty much\nbeen within two months or\n\n268\n00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.786\nless a lot of times in\ngetting the stuff done.\n\n269\n00:15:28.786 --> 00:15:34.360\nNow, you might go, so\nwhy is this actually so impressive?\n\n270\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.060\nThis particular view, if you start looking\nat this element up here that they call\n\n271\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:45.240\na timeline, this actually does start\nto work out the entire timeline for us.\n\n272\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.228\nAnd you can see that where they are or\n\n273\n00:15:47.228 --> 00:15:50.219\nwhere we're supposed to be\non the 10th right here.\n\n274\n00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:53.135\nSo here it is,\nthis is our data right here,\n\n275\n00:15:53.135 --> 00:15:56.132\nthis Friday right here\nis where we're at and\n\n276\n00:15:56.132 --> 00:16:01.566\nit's just gonna continue to go on and\non and on actually 2017 I'm lying to.\n\n277\n00:16:01.566 --> 00:16:04.907\nSo this is actually about a year from now,\nI guess.\n\n278\n00:16:04.907 --> 00:16:06.379\nIs what it's saying.\n\n279\n00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:10.070\nSo you can see just a basic view.\n\n280\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.624\nBut remember all of that is actually\nbehind scheduling of dates, resources, and\n\n281\n00:16:14.624 --> 00:16:16.850\navailability of everything.\n\n282\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.620\nNow if I change our view\nthough to the calendar\n\n283\n00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.220\nview-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n284\n00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.070\nI like how you're able to go ahead and\n\n285\n00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.580\nswitch the interface that\neasily here with Project.\n\n286\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.920\nAnd like Ronnie had mention before,\nwe do have those training videos for\n\n287\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.000\nthis application in our course library,\nso check that out also.\n\n288\n00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you want to make sure that you\ndo have at least an understanding here of\n\n289\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.860\nwhat's going on those things.\n\n290\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.950\nAnd so again,\ndo check out the Project show too.\n\n291\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.000\nNow you'll notice that this one, right,\n\n292\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.240\nyou can see with these blue bars\nwhere essentially the project starts.\n\n293\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.140\nAnd it doesn't end as we continue\nto go through the months, and\n\n294\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:55.170\nmonths, and months, well,\nfor a year and longer.\n\n295\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.730\nSo, you do have where the entire project,\nwhere you can take a look at a month by\n\n296\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:05.040\nmonth basis, and\nwhat particular tasks are being done,\n\n297\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.220\nor the work breakdown structure that is\nbeing done, and how long they're supposed\n\n298\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.130\nto last, and everything else that\nyou actually end up seeing here.\n\n299\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.880\nSo just zooming in on one of this weeks,\nright,\n\n300\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.500\nlet me see if I can scroll\nthis down a little bit.\n\n301\n00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.470\nYou can see now where all of this,\n\n302\n00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.750\nall of this supposed to be\nhappening simultaneously.\n\n303\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:29.640\nSo having some type of way to schedule\nthis is gonna be very important.\n\n304\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.090\nAt that is where your commercial\nproject information management systems\n\n305\n00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.280\nare really going to be very helpful for\nyou.\n\n306\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.350\nYour project management information\nsystems, see, I even said that backwards.\n\n307\n00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.130\nSo make sure you take advantage of\nthe tools that are actually available for\n\n308\n00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:48.470\nyou, so that you can even see the schedule\nthat's going on there too, okay.\n\n309\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.280\nSo that way you have that ability,\nof course,\n\n310\n00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.610\nto start managing your project as far\nas the time and the resources go.\n\n311\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.006\nNow as your project moves on\nfrom having that project plan,\n\n312\n00:18:00.006 --> 00:18:06.380\nyou're now going to start the work, right,\nthe execution phase of your project.\n\n313\n00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.970\nAnd that's when we start taking\nother documentation that's\n\n314\n00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.310\ngonna need to pop up and\ngoing to be addressed.\n\n315\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.560\nWe've also talked about change management,\nwhich is gonna be very hefty for us.\n\n316\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:21.250\nRemember the idea there that you actually\nformally submit changes, and as well as\n\n317\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:27.900\nissues logs that tend to go along with\nthe idea of the formal change management.\n\n318\n00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.640\nWhenever there's some type of issue and it\nrequires a change, you need to make sure\n\n319\n00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.340\nyou log those issues as well to\nensure that everybody understands,\n\n320\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.550\nhere is the ones that have actually\nbeen addressed at some point in time.\n\n321\n00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.227\nAnd so, you will end up seeing that too.\n\n322\n00:18:41.227 --> 00:18:45.847\nOnce the work starts on your project and\nyou're into that execution phase and\n\n323\n00:18:45.847 --> 00:18:49.759\nthat monitoring phase,\nthis is where you're gonna need regular\n\n324\n00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:52.743\nreports to come in, so\nthat you can do analysis and\n\n325\n00:18:52.743 --> 00:18:57.120\nmake decisions on whether or\nnot you need to increase resources.\n\n326\n00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.002\nDo you need to decrease\nresources from one,\n\n327\n00:18:59.002 --> 00:19:01.050\nto actually increase resources to another?\n\n328\n00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.680\nYou need to actually add more money here,\nand\n\n329\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.520\ntake away money from here if you need to.\n\n330\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.570\nThat's when all this comes together.\n\n331\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:13.110\nSo having a great type of ability to have\nreports come in through your communication\n\n332\n00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.277\nplan so that you can update your actual\nproject plan inside of something\n\n333\n00:19:17.277 --> 00:19:22.770\nlike Microsoft Project, and the schedule\nitself, is going to be very helpful.\n\n334\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:23.830\nCan you do it all on paper?\n\n335\n00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.390\nYes, we've mentioned that before.\n\n336\n00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.250\nYou absolutely can.\n\n337\n00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.978\nBut the hard part about doing it all on\npaper is that you don't see where one\n\n338\n00:19:30.978 --> 00:19:33.880\nchange affects the entirety\nof the schedule.\n\n339\n00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.360\nWhereas with something like what we're\nseeing right here on Microsoft Project,\n\n340\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.000\none change that can affect\nthe entire schedule,\n\n341\n00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.460\nit literally can adjust everything for you\nso that you know exactly what's going on.\n\n342\n00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.780\nSo always take a look at that idea\n\n343\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.880\nof using a tool that can help you to\nmanage this a little bit better, okay.\n\n344\n00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.370\nThe other thing that we've also taken a\nlook at before is just a quick summary of\n\n345\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.000\na ton of information,\n\n346\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.370\nwhich is the use of a project type\nof dashboard information too.\n\n347\n00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.560\nSo let's take a look at one\nagain right here, okay.\n\n348\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.164\nSo we've used this in a previous episode.\n\n349\n00:20:08.164 --> 00:20:09.710\nSo if you're going hey,\nthat looks familiar,\n\n350\n00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.918\nit's because of it's the same one.\n\n351\n00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:11.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we saw it.\n\n352\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've seen it before.\n\n353\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.140\nBut remember what this does, right.\n\n354\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:20.570\nIt gives you a lot of summary information\nin a graphical view, very quickly.\n\n355\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.530\nThe way that this one works is\nbased off an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n356\n00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.420\nWhich means as long as I update the data,\n\n357\n00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.430\nthese charts will also be\nupdated at the same time.\n\n358\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.060\nI don't have to go in and update the data,\nand then update the chart.\n\n359\n00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.916\nSo here though,\nit actually does it directly in this way.\n\n360\n00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:39.679\nThe great thing is if you use most\nproject management information systems,\n\n361\n00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:42.650\nthey have the ability to\ndo things that are similar.\n\n362\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.427\nI'm not gonna tell you all of them\ncan do it in this particular detail,\n\n363\n00:20:46.427 --> 00:20:47.650\ncuz not everyone can.\n\n364\n00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.265\nBut Project actually has a way that\nthey can at least give you the basic\n\n365\n00:20:51.265 --> 00:20:54.210\ninformation and\nmaybe even create a dashboard for you.\n\n366\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.100\nBut normally when you do that inside\na project, you're also requiring a project\n\n367\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.280\nserver, so that you can actually\ndisplay the information.\n\n368\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.382\n&gt;&gt; It's nice when it is set up like that.\n\n369\n00:21:01.382 --> 00:21:05.198\nBecause you have that real-time\ninformation that anyone can access in\n\n370\n00:21:05.198 --> 00:21:10.330\nthose tickers and measuring your different\nperformance metrics in real time there.\n\n371\n00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.170\n&gt;&gt; It's something in which\nyou have to be on top of.\n\n372\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.900\nAs a project manager, remember that\nyour time is no longer yours, right.\n\n373\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:23.749\nEvery day that you wake up, it's not\nlike you're actually ever off the clock.\n\n374\n00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:27.452\nAnd that's why project managers\nreally do make kind of the big bucks,\n\n375\n00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:29.670\nis because they're always on the clock.\n\n376\n00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.030\nBecause they're always managing\nthe project at some point.\n\n377\n00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.910\nAnd even though you can turn\nover some issues of it,\n\n378\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.940\nthe end responsibility becomes yours,\nright?\n\n379\n00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.400\nSo, you have to get as much\ninformation as possible,\n\n380\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.065\nbe able to analyze\nthe information very quickly.\n\n381\n00:21:42.065 --> 00:21:46.300\nThis dashboard here helps us to do that,\nokay.\n\n382\n00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.760\nNow along with this,\nthe stuff that I really don't like, and\n\n383\n00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.110\nI hate to say this but it's true.\n\n384\n00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.273\nI do not like meetings, okay.\n\n385\n00:21:54.273 --> 00:21:59.010\nAny time you call a meeting to me is, it's\nnot that they're not helpful at times.\n\n386\n00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:03.430\nThey should absolutely clarify\nwhat needs to be done, and\n\n387\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.570\nthen you walk away from there and\nthere's an action to be done with it.\n\n388\n00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.200\nThat's hopefully the goal.\n\n389\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm okay with them as\nlong as they remain productive.\n\n390\n00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.105\nIf it's just rambling and wasting time,\nthen yeah, I start to get anxious.\n\n391\n00:22:15.105 --> 00:22:15.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n392\n00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.760\nlet's talk about a couple of things here\nwhen we call meetings, and especially for\n\n393\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.010\nproject management.\n\n394\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:25.300\n&gt;&gt; One, it should never actually be call a\nmeeting if you don't have an agenda, okay.\n\n395\n00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.240\nSo you wanna make sure you establish\nan agenda and a time period for\n\n396\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.520\nthat meeting instead.\n\n397\n00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.430\nThat way everybody knows what you're\nactually talking about before\n\n398\n00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:35.190\nthey get there.\n\n399\n00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.990\nThey have a chance to do that.\n\n400\n00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.130\nAnd they also have a chance maybe to\nsubmit items that need to be talked\n\n401\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.290\nabout before.\n\n402\n00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.600\nDo not pass out an agenda the very\nfirst day anybody gets to see it,\n\n403\n00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.480\nthe day of the meeting as\nthey walk through the door.\n\n404\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.210\nThat doesn't give anybody any\nhope that the meeting's gonna end\n\n405\n00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:51.740\nanytime soon, okay.\n\n406\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.260\nIt's just not going to.\n\n407\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.320\nSo always walk in with an agenda in place,\nokay.\n\n408\n00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.480\nSecondly, make sure minutes\nare taken in the meeting.\n\n409\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.150\nNow talk about minutes,\n\n410\n00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:06.310\nit doesn't have to be a transcription\nof the entire meeting, okay.\n\n411\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:11.696\nYou need to understand that the idea of\nactually having minutes is if a decision\n\n412\n00:23:11.696 --> 00:23:16.999\nis made, okay, that particular decision\nneeds to actually have it worded so\n\n413\n00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:20.202\nthat it can be written down and\naccounted for.\n\n414\n00:23:20.202 --> 00:23:24.106\nSo that everybody that was actually in\nattendance, that should also be in there,\n\n415\n00:23:24.106 --> 00:23:26.380\nbut everybody that was\nin attendance heard it.\n\n416\n00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.663\nAnd they all agreed with it,\nor they disagreed with it,\n\n417\n00:23:28.663 --> 00:23:31.288\nif you're actually having one\nof those meetings which actually\n\n418\n00:23:31.288 --> 00:23:32.950\nrequires a committee decision, okay.\n\n419\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and I actually sat on one of those\ncommittees before as a secretary, and\n\n420\n00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.840\nthat was my job.\n\n421\n00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.080\nSo you need to have it kind of\nplanned out, who is responsible for\n\n422\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.330\nkeeping those minutes and\nsubmitting them in a timely manner.\n\n423\n00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really important.\n\n424\n00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.430\nBecause it's always easy to say, I know\nthat decision was made, and somebody says,\n\n425\n00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.060\nI don't think it was made.\n\n426\n00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.930\nYes, you can go back and\nyou can track it even down to the person.\n\n427\n00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.850\nIf it's a big committee,\nwho actually made the motion, and\n\n428\n00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:02.920\nwho actually seconded it as well, and\nwhat was the actual motion that carried.\n\n429\n00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.770\nSo there's a lot of times\nin which this is great.\n\n430\n00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:10.070\nIt's great as long as there's\nalso attached to the idea of\n\n431\n00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.246\nthe agenda-ed meeting, an action plan.\n\n432\n00:24:13.246 --> 00:24:16.442\n[LAUGH] It's never great when\nthere's no action plan- [CROSSTALK]\n\n433\n00:24:16.442 --> 00:24:17.205\n&gt;&gt; TOA.\n\n434\n00:24:17.205 --> 00:24:18.689\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n435\n00:24:18.689 --> 00:24:21.292\nYeah, at this particular point,\nthere always needs it.\n\n436\n00:24:21.292 --> 00:24:25.312\nWhen you walk away,\nsomebody needs to be responsible for\n\n437\n00:24:25.312 --> 00:24:29.310\nwhatever the action is,\nthe implementation of it.\n\n438\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:33.200\nAnd they also need to have a deadline for\nthat action as well.\n\n439\n00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.940\nWhen are you reporting back to me\nthat this is going to be done?\n\n440\n00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.950\nOr, when are you reporting back to\nthe group that this is gonna be done?\n\n441\n00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.200\nMake sure that happens.\n\n442\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.300\nIf your meetings are short,\nokay, no big deal.\n\n443\n00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.910\nBut they should still have\nan agenda behind them.\n\n444\n00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.940\nYou should actually have somebody,\nif it's something important,\n\n445\n00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.970\nmake sure it's actually written down,\nclarified, whatever it might be, so\n\n446\n00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.375\nthat you know that you had the meeting.\n\n447\n00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:56.560\nNow if you're relying on your memory,\n\n448\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.490\nthat's great if you have\na photographic memory.\n\n449\n00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.630\nBut if you're like me and you have 10 or\n15 meetings a day sometimes-\n\n450\n00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:01.532\n&gt;&gt; Good luck.\n\n451\n00:25:01.532 --> 00:25:05.822\n&gt;&gt; Good luck at remembering what actually\nwas said at what particular meeting, and\n\n452\n00:25:05.822 --> 00:25:08.739\nwho was actually there and,\nwhy did we say it that way?\n\n453\n00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:09.462\nIt's amazing.\n\n454\n00:25:09.462 --> 00:25:10.623\nSo even on this show,\n\n455\n00:25:10.623 --> 00:25:15.360\nI may not actually remember what I said\nthree minutes ago right now, Cherokee.\n\n456\n00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.760\nSo I'm glad you're here because\nyou can keep me straight and go,\n\n457\n00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.560\nyes you did say that, no you didn't.\n\n458\n00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.280\n&gt;&gt; The pressure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n459\n00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.980\nthat's a lot of pressure cuz\nI do tend to talk a lot.\n\n460\n00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.750\nBut overall though, you can see where\nthese documents are actually very\n\n461\n00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.910\nimportant for\njust about everything that we do, okay.\n\n462\n00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.290\nNow, the goal here was not\nto be super exhaustive.\n\n463\n00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:37.160\nBecause we've really taken\na ton of episodes to cover\n\n464\n00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.230\nwhat actually happens in those phases,\nright.\n\n465\n00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.400\nSo don't worry about it too much.\n\n466\n00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.740\nBut here, we're just kind of making sure\nthat we did a review of the documentation\n\n467\n00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.540\nthat you will tend to work\nwith in each stage, and\n\n468\n00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.630\nwhat are some of the more\nimportant elements in those too.\n\n469\n00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.640\nSo make sure you review\nthose because you're gonna\n\n470\n00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.670\ncome across them again\nas a project manager.\n\n471\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.130\n&gt;&gt; So I think that about wraps it up for\nthis episode.\n\n472\n00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.220\nWe've taken a look at nearly a dozen\ndifferent types of documents.\n\n473\n00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.370\nI hope you're all familiar with\nthose by now, at this point.\n\n474\n00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.210\nSo thank you, Ronnie, for\nbeing here with us today.\n\n475\n00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.070\nAnd thank you, guys, for tuning in.\n\n476\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.110\nStay tuned,\nwe have more Project+ headed your

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:08.250\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC].\n\n5\n00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.345\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.144\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:17.338\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:20.102\nIn this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at third party documents.\n\n9\n00:00:20.102 --> 00:00:21.974\nWe've already covered\nsome internal documents,\n\n10\n00:00:21.974 --> 00:00:24.026\nyou might wanna check that\nout in the previous episode.\n\n11\n00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:29.010\nBut with us today we have Mr. Ronnie Wong,\nthank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.211\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me today on\nthe show as we continue on to take a look\n\n13\n00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:34.984\nat more CompTIA Project+, and\n\n14\n00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:39.465\nspecifically talking about the idea of\nidentifying the third party documents.\n\n15\n00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:41.091\nNow, just like Cherokee said,\n\n16\n00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:45.720\nin a previous episode usually we take a\nlook at those dockets much more in depth.\n\n17\n00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.790\nIn this one we just need to make sure that\nwe understand that when we're dealing with\n\n18\n00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.000\nthird parties, that not everything always\nfollows underneath our control of things.\n\n19\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.710\nAnd so you have to actually have\na lot more official documentation\n\n20\n00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.702\non hand when you deal with vendors.\n\n21\n00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:05.242\nAnd it's not because they're shifty,\nI don't wanna say that, but\n\n22\n00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:08.306\nit's because they do tend to work for\na different company.\n\n23\n00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:12.349\nAnd that means that they're probably not\nunder your administrative control and\n\n24\n00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:14.560\ntheir time management's a bit different.\n\n25\n00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.608\nAnd so you tend to actually begin and to\ntake a look at what you can do if you need\n\n26\n00:01:18.608 --> 00:01:21.140\nto establish a relationship with them.\n\n27\n00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.470\nHow do you make that binding so\n\n28\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.970\nthat they can work within your project\nthe way that you want them to work.\n\n29\n00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.490\n&gt;&gt; Well sure,\nI mean you have to think about it.\n\n30\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.465\nYou have the control over who you\nhire within your organization.\n\n31\n00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:35.586\nBut you have to trust the practices that\nthe other, the third parties, corporate\n\n32\n00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:40.150\npolicies, things like that, that you do\nhave to relinquish some of that control.\n\n33\n00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.720\n&gt;&gt; You really have to, because of that\nvery fact that what you have of course now\n\n34\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.710\nis essentially two companies are deciding\nthat they are going to work together.\n\n35\n00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.830\nSo, in project management that really\ncomes in, well two stages, right.\n\n36\n00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.600\nThe first stage especially when\nyou're working with a vendor or\n\n37\n00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.090\na third party supplier of some sort.\n\n38\n00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.460\nWhether they're gonna be working on\nyour project in terms of services or\n\n39\n00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.040\noffering products that\nyou're gonna end up using.\n\n40\n00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.030\nIs that you need that now begin to\nsubmit and to actually advertise what\n\n41\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.890\nwe call different types of requests for\nour project.\n\n42\n00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.910\nSo normally when we begin\nwith this particular idea,\n\n43\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.460\nlet's say that what we have\nhere in terms of scenario\n\n44\n00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.480\nis that we are ready to now\nstart planning our project out.\n\n45\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.820\nAnd we realize that we need to be\nable to get some vendor information,\n\n46\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.510\nbecause there's a product\nthat we really need.\n\n47\n00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.691\nBut because we're underneath the\nconstraint of our cost for our budget, and\n\n48\n00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:41.565\nthe time, and the requirements.\n\n49\n00:02:41.565 --> 00:02:46.556\nWe also need to make sure that whoever\nwe deal with has the ability to supply\n\n50\n00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:50.380\nwhat we need in terms of the order and\nthe amount, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.560\nHas the ability to deliver it in the way,\nthat we actually need it and\n\n52\n00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.290\nwhen we need it, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.430\nAnd is willing to work with us as well for\nwhatever we agree to pay them.\n\n54\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.200\nSo normally where this begins is what\nis called a request for information.\n\n55\n00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.000\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of a request for information.\n\n56\n00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.020\nIt doesn't normally start off with let's\nsay Cherokee's our project manager,\n\n57\n00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.390\nwhere what Cherokee says all right,\nis we need a bunch of information, okay.\n\n58\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.300\nNow you do but what actually normally\nhappens is that you figure out,\n\n59\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.730\nokay, that you're gonna need to work\nwith so many different suppliers.\n\n60\n00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.790\nAnd you know that there is\nmaybe a glut of those people\n\n61\n00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.260\nthat can give you whatever pieces or\nproducts that you're looking for.\n\n62\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.000\nAnd now what you're really looking for\nagain is the best bang for\n\n63\n00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.120\nthe buck, right.\n\n64\n00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.600\nI'm not saying the cheapest but\n\n65\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.810\nI'm saying what gives you the most\nthat you that you can actually have.\n\n66\n00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.350\nAnd in the best quality the best\nquantity whatever it is for\n\n67\n00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.060\nthe amount of money that you're\nwilling to put out there.\n\n68\n00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.313\nAnd that idea of the request for\ninformation gives every potential\n\n69\n00:03:54.313 --> 00:04:00.550\nsupplier the ability to now register and\nsay that they are expressing an interest.\n\n70\n00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.840\nTo become what we call the preferred\nsupplier for our project at this point.\n\n71\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.333\nSo you might go ahead then and\nactually advertise that,\n\n72\n00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:14.233\nis that you go you put it in trade papers,\nyou put it in where people tend to go and\n\n73\n00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:16.114\nlook for these types of jobs.\n\n74\n00:04:16.114 --> 00:04:19.691\nAnd you say, hey, open for bidding but\nbefore you can do that, right,\n\n75\n00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:23.104\nwe need to make sure that you\nactually can meet those requirements.\n\n76\n00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:26.209\nAnd if you're interested in working\nwith us, let's go ahead and\n\n77\n00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:28.250\ntell you what just you\nhave to be able to do.\n\n78\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.520\nSo at this particular point,\nwhen you do this request for\n\n79\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.020\ninformation that you need to\nmake sure that you actually\n\n80\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.690\nget all the information you\nneed from the supplier itself.\n\n81\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.350\nTo determine one, whether or not they're\nactually eligible to become your supplier.\n\n82\n00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.440\nSo this is where it comes\na little bit tricky, right?\n\n83\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.190\nBecause let's say and I'm gonna put\nCherokee in my scenario here and\n\n84\n00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.550\npick on her a bit here.\n\n85\n00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.250\nLet's say that Cherokee goes,\nI know the perfect supplier for\n\n86\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.130\nthis, it's my cousin over here and\n\n87\n00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.970\nnow all of a sudden it's a little bit\nnepotistic is what we have, right?\n\n88\n00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.900\nMy cousin of course can supply this\ninformation, that's fine, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.931\nBut we might find out something that at\nthis point even though her cousin might be\n\n90\n00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:15.231\nable to supply it,\nwhat if he really can't.\n\n91\n00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:19.597\nWhat if he really cannot actually\nafford to essentially bank all of his\n\n92\n00:05:19.597 --> 00:05:23.170\nparticular supply on this on one customer,\nokay.\n\n93\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.875\nWhat if we don't need that particular\nsupply until about four months later, he\n\n94\n00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:30.700\nsays no, what I really need is something\nthat can take this off my hands right now.\n\n95\n00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.480\nWell that's why we actually do\nthe request for information.\n\n96\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.790\nWe put in the time\nrequirement we're looking at,\n\n97\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.330\nwe're putting in the amount of.\n\n98\n00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.216\nIf you're actually interested in doing\nthis you're trying to get and trying to\n\n99\n00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:45.210\nmake sure that they can meet the demand\nthat you have on your project, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.220\nSo, there's a lot of information\nhere when you start to do this.\n\n101\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.987\nThe other part of this request, of course,\nis really where we start seeing the idea\n\n102\n00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:57.679\nhere of describing the process\nin which somebody goes through.\n\n103\n00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:01.302\nIs your company willing to jump\nthrough the hoop that I set up,\n\n104\n00:06:01.302 --> 00:06:04.589\nto be able to say,\nyou're qualified to do this as well.\n\n105\n00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.045\n&gt;&gt; And something that's\nkind of interesting Ronnie,\n\n106\n00:06:07.045 --> 00:06:10.725\nlike Don mentioned today, I don't know\nif you guys know that currently Wes and\n\n107\n00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:12.040\nDon are out in Australia.\n\n108\n00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.150\nThey've been out and\nabout in New Zealand But they had to\n\n109\n00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.820\nactually get a special permission in order\nto solicit or contact particular vendors.\n\n110\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.210\nSo you might want to be cognizant\nof different regulations abroad.\n\n111\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Something to think about.\n\n112\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, abroad or\neven in your particular county too.\n\n113\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.080\nSo you gotta realize that there may be\nother things that are in play here.\n\n114\n00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.890\nBut overall out though,\nyou actually do advertise that out there.\n\n115\n00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.970\nHere are the basic requirements and\nif you meet these particular requirements\n\n116\n00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.071\nhere and you're interested give us\nthe information that we're looking for.\n\n117\n00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:50.282\nAnd that will put you onto a list\nin which will give us the ability\n\n118\n00:06:50.282 --> 00:06:54.985\nto know whether or not we should even\ncontact you for what is to happen.\n\n119\n00:06:54.985 --> 00:06:59.525\nSo normally in this point that's really\npart of that entire process of getting at\n\n120\n00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:01.750\nleast the basic information.\n\n121\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.600\nShowing that you know what\nthe time frame is and\n\n122\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.130\nyou're actually allowing them to\ndo that for the actual selection.\n\n123\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.310\nIn other words you're not holding\nthem at bay until forever,\n\n124\n00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.990\nyou're telling them that a selection\nwill be made by this particular date.\n\n125\n00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.430\nSo, making sure that's good, and\n\n126\n00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.360\nalso making sure that they understand\nwhat it is that they're signing up for\n\n127\n00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.920\nwhen they do it, in terms of\nthe delivery of that product too.\n\n128\n00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.374\nSo, it might be something that\nhas to be custom made, and\n\n129\n00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:25.385\nyou might find a shop\nthat's willing to do it.\n\n130\n00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:30.372\nBut when you say, can you give me\n10,000 of these in four weeks, okay,\n\n131\n00:07:30.372 --> 00:07:34.084\nfrom the time I actually get\nyou the actual information.\n\n132\n00:07:34.084 --> 00:07:37.784\nAnd then I might go [SOUND] maybe\nbe able to do half of that.\n\n133\n00:07:37.784 --> 00:07:40.832\nAnd that might not be sufficient enough so\nhopefully that means they won't turn in\n\n134\n00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:43.670\nthe bid for-\n&gt;&gt; And I like how you're attached the time\n\n135\n00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.569\nto that particular request, that proposal\nbecause if you leave it open ended like\n\n136\n00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:52.050\nthat, that just kind of really,\nit leaves it open ended.\n\n137\n00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.617\nAnd you could come to some sort of\nconflict if the customer at towards\n\n138\n00:07:55.617 --> 00:07:58.318\nthe end of that project\nif they're not satisfied.\n\n139\n00:07:58.318 --> 00:08:03.460\nYou have no kind of way saying look this\nis when we're supposed to be completed,\n\n140\n00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:09.480\nthis is What should be the satisfactory\nrequirements for that particular project.\n\n141\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n142\n00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.120\nThere is no doubt that you have to have\nall of those things in consideration\n\n143\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.640\nin the request for information.\n\n144\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.340\nNow once you go through the request for\ninformation, you find out that you have\n\n145\n00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:25.170\nfour or five possible vendors that are now\nready to possibly become on that list of\n\n146\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:30.970\npreferred vendors, you may end up now\nrequesting what we call a proposal.\n\n147\n00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:31.540\nIn other words,\n\n148\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.340\nyou start spelling out a little bit about\nthe details of your project at this point.\n\n149\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.860\nAnd once you do that,\n\n150\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.070\nyou actually tell them that this is\nwhat you want to hear from them.\n\n151\n00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.450\nCan you do it?\n\n152\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.470\nHow are you going to do it and\nwhat is your proposal?\n\n153\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.020\nIn other words,\nwhat would you need to accomplish this?\n\n154\n00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.400\nYou may not let out your details about\nwhat you're willing to spend right now,\n\n155\n00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.870\nyou can and\nthat could be part of the process already,\n\n156\n00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.090\nbut allow them to actually propose to you.\n\n157\n00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.840\nWhat timeline, all the information that\nthey need to make sure that they know\n\n158\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.390\nexactly what needs to be done.\n\n159\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.120\nThis way the provider\nitself can say to you,\n\n160\n00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.360\nyes I am interested, here is what\nI can do in the next 30 days, or\n\n161\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.480\nhere's what I can do and that way\nweeding it out to possibly isolating.\n\n162\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.990\nEven though I'm four or five and everybody\nthinks, I can generally do it, but\n\n163\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.710\nwhen you ask them for a proposal, like,\n\n164\n00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.325\nhow are you going to do this,\nand why should we pick you.\n\n165\n00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:31.700\nWell, that's the idea of the proposal, to\nlet them know what your capabilities are,\n\n166\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.000\nand that's what you're asking them is,\nwhat are their particular capabilities.\n\n167\n00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.470\nOkay, and that way you can compare those\nthat are willing to submit their proposal.\n\n168\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.000\nA lot of times you'll also end up find out\neven among four or five providers, once\n\n169\n00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.260\nthey start giving information like this,\nsome of them are absolutely willing to sit\n\n170\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.311\ndown as you fill up the paper work, and\ntry and show you what they can really do.\n\n171\n00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:56.230\nYou might find out those\na couple of companies.\n\n172\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.580\nI don't think I could do that.\n\n173\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.530\nOr you might find out that they're\njust not willing to do the paperwork\n\n174\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.560\nto submit to that process.\n\n175\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.130\n&gt;&gt; And my thing is if you don't even\nhave an implied interest and fill out\n\n176\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.960\nthe paperwork, then you're probably not\ngonna be a good candidate for my project.\n\n177\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.870\n&gt;&gt; And that's fair.\n\n178\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.260\nAnd it really is because you're not\nreally promising them anything at\n\n179\n00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.360\nthis point, right?\n\n180\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.950\nThe only thing you're doing is you're\nrequesting what in the information\n\n181\n00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.660\nare you interested in doing this, and\n\n182\n00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.030\ndo you meet the eligibility requirements\nthat I'm gonna require just for\n\n183\n00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.170\nyou to show an interest that I\nmight choose to work with you.\n\n184\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.400\nThen secondly, you're really handing\nthe ball over to their court,\n\n185\n00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.910\nand saying here's what I need.\n\n186\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.590\nTell me how you can actually do this,\nand whether or\n\n187\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.180\nnot you can really fulfill this\nparticular request that we're doing.\n\n188\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.050\nSo give me this proposal that\nthis can actually happen.\n\n189\n00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.060\nNow once you actually have those proposals\nin hand, you might choose either two or\n\n190\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.610\nyou might choose one.\n\n191\n00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.950\nAt that point you can now request\nan actual final quote from them, and\n\n192\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.900\neverything is pretty much negotiable.\n\n193\n00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.070\nYou can say in your mind during\nthe planning process that\n\n194\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.200\nhey we're not going to spend\nany more than $10,000 on this.\n\n195\n00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.830\nBut it might be where at the end\nof everything right you have\n\n196\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.770\nyour two proposals and all of a sudden you\nrealize something one submitted 15,000.\n\n197\n00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.566\nOnce submitted,\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n198\n00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:13.025\nthis is where the bidding wars start.\n\n199\n00:11:13.025 --> 00:11:13.573\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and\n\n200\n00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:18.130\nso that's why you actually want the idea\nof quotes here, when they do this.\n\n201\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:18.730\nOkay?\n\n202\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.280\nAnd the idea of just bidding\nis not enough, right?\n\n203\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.490\nI'm saying that they come in for\nthe lowest bidder.\n\n204\n00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.230\nIt's always funny, and you always\nhear the jokes about this on movies,\n\n205\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.080\nwhere they talk about, imagine this,\n\n206\n00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.410\nit's $17 billion to put a man on\nthe moon I don't know how much it would\n\n207\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.240\nactually cost and it was all going to the\nlowest bidder, is what it came down to.\n\n208\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.590\nSomebody actually build the actual\nproject that came down to that idea\n\n209\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.060\nof the lowest bidder.\n\n210\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.880\nSo in this idea of the request of quote\n\n211\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.480\nyou're actually going to supply them\nwith a template to say hey here is\n\n212\n00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.850\nwhat we are actually willing to\ngo up to in this point here.\n\n213\n00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:57.650\nBut you might find out something in\nyour particular way that you limit and\n\n214\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.200\nsay $10,000 that everybody in you know at\nleast from your preffered list at this\n\n215\n00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.980\npoint that can't even\ncome close to doing it.\n\n216\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.700\nSo then at that point you may actually\nhave to negotiate the difference or\n\n217\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.930\nyou may actually have to kind of go\nback to your project sponsor and\n\n218\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.230\ngo, here's what we found out, apparently\nwe were a little bit low balling\n\n219\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.430\nthe idea of what we actually needed here.\n\n220\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:25.790\nEverybody's turning in at least $4,000\nabove what we expected to have to pay.\n\n221\n00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:31.260\nAnd the great thing is in today's\ninformation age, you have a lot\n\n222\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:37.000\nof resources right now, just on you doing,\nlike, Internet searches,\n\n223\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.530\non you being able to actually get more\ninformation from different places.\n\n224\n00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.980\nAnd even from far away,\nthat might show you whether, or\n\n225\n00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.340\nnot, everybody's, I should say,\nnot being truthful.\n\n226\n00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.480\nBut whether or\nnot they're actually being comparable,\n\n227\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.590\nor are they just kind of saying I'm gonna\npad my figure at this point, you've\n\n228\n00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:59.110\ngotta expect a little bit of that, but\noverall that's what you're actually doing.\n\n229\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.260\nNow, the other part of this request for\na quote now,\n\n230\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.220\nwe already talked about information,\nrequest for information.\n\n231\n00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.720\nRequest for proposal,\nand request for quote.\n\n232\n00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.790\nIs normally before they get to this quote\nstage is proceeded by what we call NDA\n\n233\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.230\na non disclosure agreement.\n\n234\n00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.630\n&gt;&gt; And yes, and\ndon't be offended if a company ask, so\n\n235\n00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.180\nyou just sign that's very\ncommon suggest beware of that.\n\n236\n00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.091\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nOkay so Cherokee,\n\n237\n00:13:23.091 --> 00:13:26.330\nsince you said about that, let's talk\nabout it, it sound common enough.\n\n238\n00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.270\nBut what are we really looking at when\nwe talk about non-disclosure agreement,\n\n239\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.970\nif this was something like this?\n\n240\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.210\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie,\nlet's just say I had a fabulous idea.\n\n241\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.460\nAnd this idea, I didn't want it to leak or\nbe shared out.\n\n242\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.510\nOr maybe I'm dealing with\nsensitive customer information\n\n243\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.690\nthat had a certain level of privacy\nthat I needed to adhere to.\n\n244\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.560\nSo I would just make sure that any kind of\ncontractors or people that I were going\n\n245\n00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:54.050\ninto business with would respect that\nprivacy that is implied to my customers or\n\n246\n00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.800\nmy employees or whomever I'm trying\nto protect in that situation.\n\n247\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.250\n&gt;&gt; And the other part of this, and that's\ngreat because that's exactly what we're\n\n248\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.830\nreally looking for when it comes down to\ninformation we really don't want to get\n\n249\n00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.730\nout there, but so that we can actually\nget honest bidding that goes on\n\n250\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.660\nfrom what people really feel like can\nafford to do and what they can't.\n\n251\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.550\nWe don't want somebody coming in and\n\n252\n00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:20.630\nsaying here's how much I actually\nsubmitted for this bid in here.\n\n253\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.250\nAnd now it gets around conversation,\nright.\n\n254\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:31.652\nNow here it is, Cherokee submitted $14,000\nbid and now it's ended on Mike's desk.\n\n255\n00:14:31.652 --> 00:14:35.560\nMike realizes Cherokee's done that, and\nMike goes, I know what I'm gonna do here.\n\n256\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.530\nI'm gonna submit 1, 4, 10,000 or $11,000.\n\n257\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:44.630\nAnd when you start doing that,\nit now actually becomes not,\n\n258\n00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.570\nthe idea here of submitting a honest\nbid for a honest day's work, right?\n\n259\n00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:54.520\nAnd that becomes, I got the inside\nknowledge here that I know I can\n\n260\n00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.490\nat least undercut Cherokee and\nthat pushes her out of the process here.\n\n261\n00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.270\nAnd so signing a nondisclosure\nmeans when I submit my bid,\n\n262\n00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.950\nI don't tell anybody else about it, I just\ntell them, yeah we submitted our bid.\n\n263\n00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.980\nAnd you might have a side deal with\nsomebody hopefully you don't have that.\n\n264\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.980\nBut at this point the company is saying we\n\n265\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.440\ndon't want you to discuss your bid\nwith any other possible competitor.\n\n266\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.270\nWe want to get all those bids first.\n\n267\n00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.180\nAnd then we'll choose from among them.\n\n268\n00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.960\nAnd when the bidding's actually done,\nyou either know that you submitted\n\n269\n00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.710\nthe lowest big which might be the only\ncriteria or your bid was low enough,\n\n270\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.100\nbut you might find out later is just that\nwhen you actually had your proposal,\n\n271\n00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.280\nthat proposal didn't go far enough that\nyou actually thought it was gonna do.\n\n272\n00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.970\nAnd somebody went ahead and\nwhen they looked at the actual proposal,\n\n273\n00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:46.930\nthey're like, man,\n\n274\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.300\nthis is a better proposal than this one\neven though this one is actually cheaper.\n\n275\n00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.559\nSo it gives you that ability to have that\nhonest quote and that's what you need.\n\n276\n00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:59.854\nAnd that's really the kind of first step\nwhen you start working with third party\n\n277\n00:15:59.854 --> 00:16:04.469\nvendors is you get enough information that\nyou need You're really putting the ball in\n\n278\n00:16:04.469 --> 00:16:07.379\ntheir court when you're\nrequesting that proposal.\n\n279\n00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:10.230\nAnd then you're asking them to come\nback to you with an honest bid for\n\n280\n00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:11.710\nwhat you need.\n\n281\n00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.690\nNow, along with this quote,\n\n282\n00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.590\nyou wanna make sure that they\nunderstand what they're quoting on.\n\n283\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:22.260\nAnd this is where people get upset\nthe most and vendors get upset the most.\n\n284\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.680\nIs that they don't understand\nwhen you come back and\n\n285\n00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.680\nyour competitor's jumping up and\ndown because they won the bid.\n\n286\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.650\nAnd you're like, well,\nwhy didn't mine get selected?\n\n287\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.700\nWhat is it that I missed here?\n\n288\n00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.110\nAnd what is it that that\nguy had that I didn't have?\n\n289\n00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:38.760\nWell, that means that they believe what?\n\n290\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.930\nThat somehow, Cherokee, if you're the one\nthat's actually delivering the news.\n\n291\n00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.888\nThat's somehow you and\nyour team decided that, hey,\n\n292\n00:16:45.888 --> 00:16:50.330\nwe gave Ronnie enough information but\nyou didn't give me\n\n293\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:55.490\nall the information to decide on how\nmuch I really needed to bid on this.\n\n294\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.780\nSo you need to make sure that all\nthe selection criteria for the quote\n\n295\n00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.920\nincludes things like functionality of\nthe project or the range of services.\n\n296\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.590\nYou wanna make sure you know what the\ninitial price of the offered product or\n\n297\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.380\nservice is going to be.\n\n298\n00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.068\nSo there's a whole list of total cost\nof ownership during the lifetime\n\n299\n00:17:12.068 --> 00:17:16.319\nof the actual product itself, cost\ndrivers of what you're actually offering,\n\n300\n00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.819\nservices you know you name it,\ndelivery cost, risk associated,\n\n301\n00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:24.032\nability to meet the stated requirements,\nall of these are actually possible.\n\n302\n00:17:24.032 --> 00:17:26.509\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they might not have the proper\nlicensing for that particular project.\n\n303\n00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:28.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nthat's what it might come down to.\n\n304\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.410\nAnd that's great that\nyou mention that because\n\n305\n00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.960\nremember what Cherokee said a little\nbit earlier is that sometimes, we are,\n\n306\n00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.280\nwe're kinda locked in by the regulation.\n\n307\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.140\nAnd they might have had the lowest bid,\nthey might have actually said we can do\n\n308\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:45.040\nall of this here, and\nthen when you said, well, all right.\n\n309\n00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.170\nYou're listing that you are able to verify\n\n310\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.480\nthat you've got all these\nregulatory compliance issues done.\n\n311\n00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.960\nAnd all of a sudden you realize,\nthey didn't list anything.\n\n312\n00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.580\nAnd then you're kind of going,\nwell, what do we need to do?\n\n313\n00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.230\nWell, you do your own investigation,\nright?\n\n314\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.190\nYou go and\nyou find out about that company,\n\n315\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.350\nthat they meet all of the eligibility\nrequirements for that.\n\n316\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.560\nAnd if they did, it's fine.\n\n317\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.430\nBut now you find out what?\n\n318\n00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.490\nThey didn't.\n\n319\n00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.590\nAnd that might actually eliminate\nthem from that process as well\n\n320\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.450\neven though they had the lowest bid.\n\n321\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.830\nBut you do have to state that stuff so\nthat everybody understands it's fair and\n\n322\n00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.120\nit's based off of that.\n\n323\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.190\nVery important part of the process,\nor people always feel cheated.\n\n324\n00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.239\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then, so\nmoving forward, what do we do next?\n\n325\n00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:26.451\nOnce we go ahead and,\nlet's say we were selected.\n\n326\n00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:30.792\nOkay, we met the requirement,\nwe are the best prowess and\n\n327\n00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:33.110\neverything looks hunky dory.\n\n328\n00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.662\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, let's go and take a look\nat my screen then here for a moment.\n\n329\n00:18:36.662 --> 00:18:38.860\nLet me make sure I pull up some stuff.\n\n330\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.700\nSo, here is this idea that request for\nproposal and\n\n331\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.970\nthis can come in many different forms.\n\n332\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.560\nAnd so a lot of times.\n\n333\n00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.510\nI'm just gonna show you table of contents,\nso you can that this particular form is\n\n334\n00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.830\nfairly long and if you are not, if you are\ngoing like do I have to make this all out?\n\n335\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:53.810\nNo you don't.\n\n336\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:58.070\nThe great thing is on the Internet there's\nplenty of places willing to provide you\n\n337\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.610\nespecially in project management with\nfree templates that will help you out.\n\n338\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.210\nSo normally there's all of this,\nwhen you actually ask them for a proposal.\n\n339\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.842\nYou can actually say, you need to submit\nthe proposal using this template.\n\n340\n00:19:09.842 --> 00:19:14.752\nAnd that way, nobody judges it based on\nthe very fact that Cherokee Turner's in\n\n341\n00:19:14.752 --> 00:19:18.067\na non very fancy high-quality\nbonded cotton paper.\n\n342\n00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:20.663\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I probably would too, yeah.\n\n343\n00:19:20.663 --> 00:19:24.942\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie turned it on and it looks\nlike the back of a Waffle House napkin.\n\n344\n00:19:24.942 --> 00:19:29.251\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I wouldn't do that,\nbut you kind of get the idea.\n\n345\n00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:32.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Did you see Breaking Bad where\nthe attorney was in the bathroom and\n\n346\n00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:35.576\nhe wrote a contract on a toilet paper,\nand turned it in?\n\n347\n00:19:35.576 --> 00:19:36.403\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go, yeah.\n\n348\n00:19:36.403 --> 00:19:38.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no I did not see that one.\n\n349\n00:19:38.891 --> 00:19:41.342\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe it was the spinoff episode.\n\n350\n00:19:41.342 --> 00:19:42.220\n&gt;&gt; Could be, yeah.\n\n351\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:42.998\n&gt;&gt; Better call Saul.\n\n352\n00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:46.072\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so but you guys should\nhave all this information, right?\n\n353\n00:19:46.072 --> 00:19:49.143\nSo once all of this is done,\nyou get that request per quotes.\n\n354\n00:19:49.143 --> 00:19:53.383\nThat means the second part of actually\nall the requests that come in, and\n\n355\n00:19:53.383 --> 00:19:57.831\nyou're now ready to pull the trigger of\ncourse, is that we now need to go into\n\n356\n00:19:57.831 --> 00:20:01.749\nwhere we start actually exchanging\nmutually binding documents.\n\n357\n00:20:01.749 --> 00:20:03.057\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's what I was looking for.\n\n358\n00:20:03.057 --> 00:20:04.244\n&gt;&gt; That's what you are looking for?\n\n359\n00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:05.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n360\n00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.600\nSo, the idea mutually binding documents,\n\n361\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.900\nare things exactly like\nyou find out about right.\n\n362\n00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.900\nThis is where you are going to the legal\ndocuments in place to ensure that now\n\n363\n00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:22.940\nyou are actually going to negotiate work\nto be done, for the price to be done.\n\n364\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.720\nAnd others are exchanged of goods and\nservices.\n\n365\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:30.190\nAnd it has to again be mutually\nbinding and legally binding\n\n366\n00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.740\na lot of times in this particular\npoint when you start to do this.\n\n367\n00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.198\nNow, a lot of times when you do this,\ncontracts never are like never like,\n\n368\n00:20:38.198 --> 00:20:40.450\nall right here is the contract,\njust sign it.\n\n369\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.070\nLove for it to be that way.\n\n370\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:46.240\nThere's usually negotiations and like,\nall right, so here's what we're gonna do.\n\n371\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.760\nHere's everything that's\ngonna end up happening here.\n\n372\n00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.110\nSo, normally what happens\nfirst of all is one of these.\n\n373\n00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:56.690\nSo, if we take a look at my screen here\nis what we call a statement of work.\n\n374\n00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.640\nThe idea of a statement of work.\n\n375\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:05.200\nNow, when you start taking a look here\nthis is pretty much the first step\n\n376\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.530\nwhen everything is done.\n\n377\n00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.760\nYou're actually willing now to\ndescribe what the process is and\n\n378\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.120\nhow you're gonna actually\nprocure things that you need to.\n\n379\n00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.652\nYou need to make sure that\nyou have all the goods and\n\n380\n00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:19.502\nservices that you need from\nthat particular supplier.\n\n381\n00:21:19.502 --> 00:21:23.251\nAnd even at this point you may go\nahead and be able to say, hey,\n\n382\n00:21:23.251 --> 00:21:29.020\nlet's make sure that you understand\nwhat's out there and what's available.\n\n383\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.270\nNow when tha happens,\nyou may actually at that point go,\n\n384\n00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:38.770\nall right, now that we're at this\nprocess where we're talking very well.\n\n385\n00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.510\nI'm understanding what you want here,\nthen there's two things.\n\n386\n00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:48.110\nYou can immediately go to a contract,\nwhich if everything is good,\n\n387\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.440\nyou sign it and\nyou're off and ready to go.\n\n388\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.250\nBut if you're not sure because the legal\nlanguage is confusing you, my best advice\n\n389\n00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.580\nis do not sign a contract if any of\nthe language is confusing to you or\n\n390\n00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.050\nyour lawyers.\n\n391\n00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.990\nSo make sure you actually do have\nlegal teams on hand to do this if it's\n\n392\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.330\nsomething like that.\n\n393\n00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:10.790\nBut what you can do is submit what\nyou call a letter of intent instead.\n\n394\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:15.770\nA letter of intent is essentially\na temporary measure until those\n\n395\n00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:21.440\nparticular details on the contract\nare actually put into place.\n\n396\n00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.480\nBut should never be considered\na substitute for a contract itself.\n\n397\n00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.208\nSo, have you ever dealt with\na letter of intent, Cherokee?\n\n398\n00:22:30.208 --> 00:22:35.426\n&gt;&gt; Personally, yes, whenever just applying\nfor jobs, but that's the extent there.\n\n399\n00:22:35.426 --> 00:22:36.435\n&gt;&gt; No, that works.\n\n400\n00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:38.997\nOkay, that's actually a great\nexample of what we're talking about.\n\n401\n00:22:38.997 --> 00:22:40.457\nLetter of intent is that you said what?\n\n402\n00:22:40.457 --> 00:22:42.695\nI'm intending to come and work for you.\n\n403\n00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:43.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, but\n\n404\n00:22:43.842 --> 00:22:48.689\neven at that point, it doesn't mean\nthat Cherokee can't say, you know what?\n\n405\n00:22:48.689 --> 00:22:52.991\nAfter a few days, even though I signed\nthat letter of intent that I was going\n\n406\n00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:56.971\nto do so, and my true intention is\nto do so, might get a better offer.\n\n407\n00:22:56.971 --> 00:22:57.829\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n408\n00:22:57.829 --> 00:22:59.933\n&gt;&gt; And it does happen,\nit's never happened to me.\n\n409\n00:22:59.933 --> 00:23:02.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, so Cherokee is like yeah,\n\n410\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:03.987\nit happens all the time.\n\n411\n00:23:03.987 --> 00:23:08.911\n&gt;&gt; I see online on social media recruiters\nare always complaining about how\n\n412\n00:23:08.911 --> 00:23:11.666\nthey put all this effort on to a new hire.\n\n413\n00:23:11.666 --> 00:23:14.717\nBut then the travel arrangements and\nfor the interview process and\n\n414\n00:23:14.717 --> 00:23:17.180\nthen at the last minute they\njust go ahead and cancel.\n\n415\n00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.472\nSo I know it happens.\n\n416\n00:23:18.472 --> 00:23:20.512\nI've seen people complaining\nabout it all the time.\n\n417\n00:23:20.512 --> 00:23:24.456\n&gt;&gt; And hopefully the letter of intent\nreally does stops someone from doing that\n\n418\n00:23:24.456 --> 00:23:25.690\nbut it doesn't.\n\n419\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:30.930\nEven though a letter of intent absolutely\nsay that this is your best and\n\n420\n00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.180\nmost goodwill that you\nare intending to do.\n\n421\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.470\nWhat you're going to end\nup anyways in the contract.\n\n422\n00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.690\nYou can't substitute it for a contract.\n\n423\n00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:43.310\nSo one of the most famous cases in\nterms of the project management is\n\n424\n00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.880\nan incredibly long name.\n\n425\n00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.038\nThe Trustees of Ampleforth Abbey Trust\nversus Turner and\n\n426\n00:23:48.038 --> 00:23:49.822\nTownsend Project Management.\n\n427\n00:23:49.822 --> 00:23:50.583\nAnd if you go.\n\n428\n00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:51.808\n&gt;&gt; What was that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n429\n00:23:51.808 --> 00:23:53.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I understand okay,\n\n430\n00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.310\nnow you're probably like saying why\nwas that important at this point?\n\n431\n00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.027\nThis actually is a case where all of\na sudden this was a building project that\n\n432\n00:24:01.027 --> 00:24:02.099\nended up happening.\n\n433\n00:24:02.099 --> 00:24:06.962\nThe project manager said of course,\nI will go ahead and manage the actual\n\n434\n00:24:06.962 --> 00:24:12.780\nproject the way that's suppose to be\nmanaged according to the letter intent.\n\n435\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.100\nBut they didn't go forward in\nterms of getting the contract.\n\n436\n00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.750\nOkay.\n\n437\n00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:22.060\nSo then when the people that owned\nthe building, okay, or the [INAUDIBLE]\n\n438\n00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:28.250\ndeveloped their property And said, yeah,\nwe're not gonna pay you for something.\n\n439\n00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.310\nWell, they went for us and\n\n440\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.530\nlook, we've done some of the work,\nwe've already done that.\n\n441\n00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.740\nAnd a judge essentially said look-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n442\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.220\n&gt;&gt; Part of your-\n&gt;&gt; If you've ever seen Judge Judy.\n\n443\n00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If you don't have it in black and\n\n444\n00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.730\nwhite, it didn't happen or\nit doesn't matter.\n\n445\n00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; She's pretty strict about that.\n\n446\n00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and this one is just strange.\n\n447\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.570\nYou did all the work, you were essentially\nsaying that this became your contract.\n\n448\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.200\nAnd so, even though it was just\na letter of intent, right.\n\n449\n00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.330\n&gt;&gt; You wanna look out for yourself.\n\n450\n00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna look out for yourself,\nand so that's why you never treat it.\n\n451\n00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:58.880\nSo even though they were the ones that\nwere wronged, the judge came back and\n\n452\n00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.290\nsaid you were wrong for\nnot getting the contract.\n\n453\n00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So you start to fulfill out\n\n454\n00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.000\nthat contract, regardless of whether they\npaid you the way you wanted to or not.\n\n455\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.070\nYou said you're going to do it.\n\n456\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.390\nAnd they essentially said, you created an\nad hoc contract and that's what happened.\n\n457\n00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.690\nAnd so you go to project management and\nyou start typing a letter of intent.\n\n458\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.470\nYou normally see that case\nthat I have talked about.\n\n459\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.360\n&gt;&gt; So, that's why you need something\nthat's legally binding like that\n\n460\n00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.166\nstatement of work.\n\n461\n00:25:21.166 --> 00:25:23.585\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So also Ronnie, I had a question for\n\n462\n00:25:23.585 --> 00:25:26.406\nyou, let's say we agreed\non x amount of jobs.\n\n463\n00:25:26.406 --> 00:25:27.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n464\n00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.950\n&gt;&gt; With that statement of work,\nI have seen before were statement of work,\n\n465\n00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.800\nshould really be specific\nto individual projects.\n\n466\n00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.930\nAnd then if I had accumulative, I would\ngo ahead and have additional documents,\n\n467\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.780\nsuch as a master service agreement or\nsomething like that.\n\n468\n00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is correct, excellent!\n\n469\n00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.310\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n470\n00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:47.460\n&gt;&gt; There we go, so yeah,\nthe statement work should be detailed,\n\n471\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.730\nspecific to what we actually want it\nto be, and then we start working and\n\n472\n00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.500\nhopefully everything ends up being\nwhat we call a contract at some point.\n\n473\n00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.120\nNow let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n474\n00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.030\nI'm not, we're not gonna fill\nout a contract, I guarantee you.\n\n475\n00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:03.310\nBut normally, that's what you have\nat the top here says contract, and\n\n476\n00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.580\nthis is one I pulled up just\nfrom an Internet search.\n\n477\n00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.580\nSo you can try find the same one if\nyou choose to, but it normally is\n\n478\n00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.710\nall legal in language, and that's\nwhy we are not going into it, right.\n\n479\n00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.805\nBut there's the key part,\nright there, okay?\n\n480\n00:26:15.805 --> 00:26:17.890\n[LAUGH] Signing.\n\n481\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.470\nSo, here it is, when you actually\nhave something like this,\n\n482\n00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.940\nyou wanna make sure that you understand\nwhat's actually being signed, and\n\n483\n00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.440\nthat everything is actually going to be\nlegal, and then all of the details are,\n\n484\n00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.770\nessentially, spelled\nout from that point on.\n\n485\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.780\nAnd you better believe it should\nbe spelled out to the letter\n\n486\n00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.750\nhere in terms of the contract itself.\n\n487\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.890\nSo this is the legally binding part.\n\n488\n00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.620\nSo even though a lot of times,\nyour letter of intent doesn't signal\n\n489\n00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.360\nthe idea that they're selling legally\nbinding, it does signal your intent\n\n490\n00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.080\nthat you believe that this\nrelationship is gonna work out.\n\n491\n00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.120\nIt's gonna do that, but at the same time,\nyou need to protect yourself\n\n492\n00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.630\nby insisting or by making sure that\nthe contract is moving forward.\n\n493\n00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:02.540\nBecause if you start work while you\nhave the letter of intent, well remember\n\n494\n00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.630\nthat somebody, if you're actually going\nto go before a judge and doing this.\n\n495\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:10.110\nThey may decide you treated the letter\nof intent as a legal contract, so\n\n496\n00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:14.315\nshame on you for not Not actually getting\nthe contract, and you'll see that,\n\n497\n00:27:14.315 --> 00:27:18.715\nmake sure you push forward here and\nget that idea of the contract.\n\n498\n00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:23.365\nNow, the other thing you can do instead\nbefore every contract is signed,\n\n499\n00:27:23.365 --> 00:27:27.215\nis along with a letter of intent is that\nyou can work with what they call MOU or\n\n500\n00:27:27.215 --> 00:27:28.945\na MOO, I always call it a MOO.\n\n501\n00:27:28.945 --> 00:27:31.570\nA memorandum of understanding.\n\n502\n00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.170\nOkay, this particular type of document\n\n503\n00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:39.000\neven though in CompTIA they call\na mutually binding document.\n\n504\n00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.310\nIt is an agreement between two parties but\nit's not actually legally binding, okay.\n\n505\n00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.180\nSo this-\n&gt;&gt; A little more than a handshake, but\n\n506\n00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.780\nnot something you can go and\ntake to court.\n\n507\n00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.190\nThat's what a I always was-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n508\n00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.450\nThat's actually a very good\ndescription there, yeah.\n\n509\n00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:55.490\nIt's a mutually benefit,\nbeneficial agreement between two partners.\n\n510\n00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.395\nSaying hey, I'm willing to work together\nand see how this actually works out, so\n\n511\n00:27:59.395 --> 00:28:01.273\nhere's what we're gonna negotiate.\n\n512\n00:28:01.273 --> 00:28:05.365\nEven a little bit of payment might be\ndone, and then you go, if this works out,\n\n513\n00:28:05.365 --> 00:28:09.091\nyeah let's move on to actually sealing\nit with a contract of some sort.\n\n514\n00:28:09.091 --> 00:28:12.035\nSo you may see that as well, okay?\n\n515\n00:28:12.035 --> 00:28:14.455\nNow, there is also of course,\nin this day and age,\n\n516\n00:28:14.455 --> 00:28:17.955\nthe idea of service level agreements.\n\n517\n00:28:17.955 --> 00:28:22.595\nService level agreements are, hopefully\ndesigned to help you to spell out\n\n518\n00:28:22.595 --> 00:28:27.440\nthe rights and obligations that\nhappen inside of that contract, okay?\n\n519\n00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:33.190\nWhat is the expected service level that\nyou are actually both agreeing to do.\n\n520\n00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:37.000\nSo if you buy something such as a service\ncontract, which you're hoping for\n\n521\n00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.830\nis that they do carry out everything that\nthey say they're going to carry out,\n\n522\n00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.560\nespecially when you have issues.\n\n523\n00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.280\nMost of us tend to not think about it if\nwere not really using the product overall.\n\n524\n00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.380\nBut if you are, you want to make sure that\nyou have that service level agreement here\n\n525\n00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.190\nThat says and spell it out.\n\n526\n00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.980\nThis is what was promised,\nmake sure it's actually handled.\n\n527\n00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know why I always think\nof SLAs as kind of like a teeter totter of\n\n528\n00:29:00.545 --> 00:29:01.680\nlegal documents.\n\n529\n00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.270\nBecause it defines both\nins of the spectrum there.\n\n530\n00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.410\nIt says, hey look,\nthis is what I expected of you, and\n\n531\n00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.220\nthis is what I expect from you.\n\n532\n00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.580\nAnd if you don't do that then\nthis is the consequence.\n\n533\n00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.790\nAnd you really have to take a look at\nthose if you are concerned, because for\n\n534\n00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.690\ninstance, I just looked at one.\n\n535\n00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.840\nThe other day, online for\nmy Internet service provider.\n\n536\n00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:28.395\nAnd it clearly states in their SLA,\nlook, you are not allow to sue us, okay.\n\n537\n00:29:28.395 --> 00:29:29.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n538\n00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.980\n&gt;&gt; You have to go through arbitration\nif you have any kind of dispute.\n\n539\n00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.610\nIt has to be handled in that manner first.\n\n540\n00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.350\nSo, I mean that's just one of the clauses.\n\n541\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.050\nAnd they could put anything\nthat they want in there.\n\n542\n00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.750\nSo that's why it's important to\nreally check those out before you\n\n543\n00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.840\nenter that agreement.\n\n544\n00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt.\n\n545\n00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:45.650\nAnd this is probably one of\nthe things which really can get,\n\n546\n00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.980\nespecially in the middle of a contact,\nright?\n\n547\n00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.373\nWhere what you're expecting to be done,\nand what actually is done,\n\n548\n00:29:51.373 --> 00:29:54.366\nis gonna be based off of\nthe service level agreement, okay.\n\n549\n00:29:54.366 --> 00:29:57.749\nSo if you don't take a quick peek at\nit at least, if you don't actually take\n\n550\n00:29:57.749 --> 00:30:00.910\na detailed look at it,\ndon't be surprised if it's not done.\n\n551\n00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.310\nSo this is where it becomes binding.\n\n552\n00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:07.320\nService level agreements are pretty much\na key that lets you know that everything\n\n553\n00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.620\nthat was promised should\nactually be delivered on as well.\n\n554\n00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.830\nLast I wanna talk about purchase\norders just briefly, okay.\n\n555\n00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.430\nThe ideal that she's using a purchase\norder essentially describes the terms\n\n556\n00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.640\nin which we're actually now willing now to\nrelease the amount of money that's been\n\n557\n00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.900\nagreed upon for whatever service or\nproduct that we've actually gotten.\n\n558\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.610\nSo it's like signing a check, but\na purchase order is actually saying, yes,\n\n559\n00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.730\nlets go ahead and release that money.\n\n560\n00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.642\n&gt;&gt; It's the paperwork that\nhelps keep accounting and\n\n561\n00:30:33.642 --> 00:30:36.189\neveryone on the same page and\nall that money accounted for, right?\n\n562\n00:30:36.189 --> 00:30:38.048\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does help.\n\n563\n00:30:38.048 --> 00:30:41.187\nThe one time which paperwork\nreally is essential,\n\n564\n00:30:41.187 --> 00:30:45.208\nis going to be right here when\nsomebody says, I didn't get paid.\n\n565\n00:30:45.208 --> 00:30:49.119\nAnd somebody in the projects,\nnow mad enough sends a, well let's find,\n\n566\n00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:51.420\nshow me a copy of the purchase order.\n\n567\n00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.820\nAnd not only, was I supposed to do that?\n\n568\n00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.020\nYes, okay.\n\n569\n00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.090\nSo the reason why you're a vendor and\n\n570\n00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.250\ndidn't get paid,\nyou didn't submit a purchase order, okay.\n\n571\n00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.730\nVery easy,\nthose steps are actually there for\n\n572\n00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.940\naccountability more than anything else.\n\n573\n00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.312\n&gt;&gt; So remember this could\nactually be where you say hey,\n\n574\n00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:09.100\nI'm willing to pay $1,000 for\n500 of these.\n\n575\n00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:09.830\nWhatever it might be.\n\n576\n00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.210\nOr you might say something like\nthis in terms of purchase order.\n\n577\n00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:18.770\nWe're willing to pay $50 now for the first\n100 hours of work you provide for us.\n\n578\n00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:22.450\n&gt;&gt; But after that it actually has to\nbe renegotiated, or it goes up, or\n\n579\n00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.500\nit goes down,\ndepending on what you need here.\n\n580\n00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.120\nBut all that has to again\nbe accounted for, and\n\n581\n00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.470\nthat's where our purchase\norder also steps in to, okay?\n\n582\n00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.000\nLastly, we also need to talk\nabout the idea of warranties.\n\n583\n00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.115\nNow Cherokee, do you know\nthe difference between a warranty and\n\n584\n00:31:38.115 --> 00:31:39.695\na guarantee, by chance?\n\n585\n00:31:39.695 --> 00:31:41.436\nIt's kind of weird, it's a weird term.\n\n586\n00:31:41.436 --> 00:31:46.245\n&gt;&gt; I would say that a warranty is going\nto be limited by some time frame.\n\n587\n00:31:46.245 --> 00:31:52.670\nAnd a guarantee would be if you were\nsatisfied with the end result or not.\n\n588\n00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:56.714\nI think that's a very good idea of\nthe definition of what we're talking about\n\n589\n00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:57.468\nhere, yeah.\n\n590\n00:31:57.468 --> 00:31:59.256\nThe idea of satisfaction, and\n\n591\n00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:02.571\nwhat your product is actually\ngoing to say that it can do.\n\n592\n00:32:02.571 --> 00:32:05.500\nAnd on the easy idea of a guarantee.\n\n593\n00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:10.460\nI promise you, or I guarantee you\nthat it'll work the first time,\n\n594\n00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.500\nyou actually turn it on.\n\n595\n00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.277\nSo let's say the idea of old lawnmowers,\nright?\n\n596\n00:32:15.277 --> 00:32:17.346\nSomebody always says something like this,\nright?\n\n597\n00:32:17.346 --> 00:32:22.312\nThe first time every time, great when you\npull on the rip-cord for the lawnmower.\n\n598\n00:32:22.312 --> 00:32:24.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so you're going, come on,\n\n599\n00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.195\nI've owned lawnmowers before.\n\n600\n00:32:26.195 --> 00:32:29.488\nAnd then the first time you're like,\nwell that works, that's great.\n\n601\n00:32:29.488 --> 00:32:32.443\n&gt;&gt; I've never had it\nwork on the first pull.\n\n602\n00:32:32.443 --> 00:32:34.320\n&gt;&gt; See,\nthat would be an incredible guarantee.\n\n603\n00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.109\nWouldn't you think that would\nbe an incredible guarantee?\n\n604\n00:32:36.109 --> 00:32:38.250\n&gt;&gt; I'd buy it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you'd buy it.\n\n605\n00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.340\nThat is a guarantee, right.\n\n606\n00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:43.061\nIt's a promise that it's gonna work for\nthe first time every time, okay?\n\n607\n00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:46.261\nNow, a warranty though,\nnormally does state that, hey,\n\n608\n00:32:46.261 --> 00:32:49.269\nnot that it's gonna work\nthe first time every time, but\n\n609\n00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:53.641\nreally is kind of the opposite in terms\nof mechanical details in this way, okay?\n\n610\n00:32:53.641 --> 00:32:57.871\nIf it doesn't actually work\nthe first time every time,\n\n611\n00:32:57.871 --> 00:33:01.291\nthen the company says\nwhat it will do to what?\n\n612\n00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:05.410\nTo essentially try to compensate for\nthat, okay?\n\n613\n00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.913\nEither bring you a new lawnmower,\nor repair that particular part or\n\n614\n00:33:08.913 --> 00:33:09.965\nwhatever might be.\n\n615\n00:33:09.965 --> 00:33:12.550\nA lot of time it has to do with\nthese things like small motors but\n\n616\n00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:16.470\nthey're normally guaranteed for the time\nperiod like Cherokee was saying it okay.\n\n617\n00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:20.147\nSo like for the first three years,\nit should operate first time every time.\n\n618\n00:33:21.512 --> 00:33:23.070\nEvery time you pull it,\nthat's what it should do.\n\n619\n00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.080\nAnd then of course, they'll list out like,\n\n620\n00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.310\nas long as you're not doing it while\nsubmerge under water you know.\n\n621\n00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:33.054\nAs long as you're not doing this when\nyou're trying to tow this behind your\n\n622\n00:33:33.054 --> 00:33:33.590\ntruck.\n\n623\n00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:38.517\n&gt;&gt; Especially for like electronics,\nwith the no water residue or, yeah.\n\n624\n00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:40.196\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd you start seeing that, too.\n\n625\n00:33:40.196 --> 00:33:42.407\nYou know,\nwell this thing is under warranty.\n\n626\n00:33:42.407 --> 00:33:46.028\nAnd then you read on the warranty,\nis like, unless there's moisture damage or\n\n627\n00:33:46.028 --> 00:33:46.739\nwater damage.\n\n628\n00:33:46.739 --> 00:33:47.261\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n629\n00:33:47.261 --> 00:33:50.170\n&gt;&gt; And so, that's when you start\nseeing the limitations there.\n\n630\n00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:56.020\nBut all these are again, set in place\nto really provide for your project,\n\n631\n00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:00.750\nthe legally binding information a lot of\ntimes, if not mutually binding information\n\n632\n00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:06.140\nthat you can count on when working\nwith a company that, you know,\n\n633\n00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.940\nthat one, you're not administratively\nresponsible for, legally responsible for.\n\n634\n00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.537\nBut now, you actually have, you know\nyou work into an agreement with it so\n\n635\n00:34:14.537 --> 00:34:18.108\nthat your company and\ntheir company mutually benefits.\n\n636\n00:34:18.108 --> 00:34:21.502\nSo do take a look at these documents and\nmake sure you actually have\n\n637\n00:34:21.502 --> 00:34:25.037\nan understanding of them,\nespecially before you go onto the exam.\n\n638\n00:34:25.037 --> 00:34:28.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for showing us\nthose tools and documents Ronnie.\n\n639\n00:34:28.027 --> 00:34:30.522\nI think you guys at home\nshould be pretty familiar,\n\n640\n00:34:30.522 --> 00:34:33.028\nwe looked at some of the most basic,\ncommon forms.\n\n641\n00:34:33.028 --> 00:34:36.141\nSo if not go back and\nre-watch the episode.\n\n642\n00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:40.085\nBut I think that's gonna wrap it up for\nthis particular episode.\n\n643\n00:34:40.085 --> 00:34:42.357\nThank you so guys so much for\ntuning in, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n644\n00:34:42.357 --> 00:34:43.291\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n645\n00:34:43.291 --> 00:34:46.449\n&gt;&gt; Signing out for ITPRO.TV.\n\n646\n00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:52.276\n[MUSIC]\n\n647\n00:34:52.276 --> 00:34:54.610\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",
