certification\n\n3\n00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:15,220\nfrom the Project Management Institute,\nor PMI.\n\n4\n00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,270\nWe get [LAUGH] a little [LAUGH]\nAcronym soup on this one.\n\n5\n00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,192\nThe The PMI's PMP certification.\n\n6\n00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:24,430\n[LAUGH] It's a bit of a mouthful.\n\n7\n00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,710\nIt is a industry recognized project\nmanagement certification, and if you're\n\n8\n00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,430\nnot familiar with project management\nin general, well, let me tell you.\n\n9\n00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,480\nIt's a hot button issue with\na lot of organizations.\n\n10\n00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,380\nWe're starting to see more and more\ncompanies move towards formalized project\n\n11\n00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,520\nmanagement frameworks, and there's\na number of frameworks that are out there,\n\n12\n00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,790\ncompanies that are free to pick and\n\n13\n00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,880\nchoose whatever they want, but PMI,\nthe Project Management Institute,\n\n14\n00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,330\nthey are a non-profit organization\nthat was formed over 20 years ago.\n\n15\n00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,730\nThey've been around a while.\n\n16\n00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,510\nAnd they're idea was hey, if you learn\nhow to manage a project for one company,\n\n17\n00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,160\nand then you go to a second company you\nhaven't to start over from scratch.\n\n18\n00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,110\nThere's a lot of stuff that's\ndone that's the same, and so\n\n19\n00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,300\nthey set out to create a framework.\n\n20\n00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,980\nA collection of processes that you\ncan use, to help manage projects.\n\n21\n00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,210\nThe idea being that whether you're\nin construction, or medical,\n\n22\n00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,630\nor IT, or whatever,\nthat a project is a project.\n\n23\n00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,690\nThey all have the same fundamental\nmethods for managing them.\n\n24\n00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,270\nAnd ensuring success.\n\n25\n00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,980\nSo they put all that\ntogether into one big giant\n\n26\n00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,590\nbook called the Project Management Body\nof Knowledge.\n\n27\n00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,458\nAnd it is a big book,\nwhat is it now, Ronnie?\n\n28\n00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,110\nIt's like.\nOver 600, 700 pages.\n\n29\n00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,170\nYeah, it's massive.\n\n30\n00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,790\nYeah.\nAnd what they did is, they just took ways\n\n31\n00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,840\nthat people were managing projects,\nthey made them a little more generic so\n\n32\n00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,930\nthey applied to any industry and\nput them together in this big book.\n\n33\n00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,700\nAnd the idea is that if companies want\nto implement formal project management,\n\n34\n00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,680\ninstead of starting from scratch,\nthey can just grab the PMI's model,\n\n35\n00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680\ntheir framework.\n\n36\n00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,110\nAnd you don't have to do the whole thing;\nit's often times overkill for small and\n\n37\n00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,260\nmedium businesses.\n\n38\n00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,530\nYou can pick and choice the components\nthat you want that are appropriate for\n\n39\n00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,840\nyour organization that help\nyou manage and, ultimately,\n\n40\n00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,650\nbe successful in the project.\n\n41\n00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,450\nIt's really cool.\n\n42\n00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,350\nIt's really flexible.\n\n43\n00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,470\nThat's kind of a nice thing to have\navailable and that's made it really\n\n44\n00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,520\nattractive to a lot of companies,\nin the United States the PMP or\n\n45\n00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,330\nthe PMI framework is the most common\nstandardized form of project management.\n\n46\n00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,030\nThere's other ones out there.\n\n47\n00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,450\nThe whole ISO 9000 series or\n20,000 series.\n\n48\n00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,142\nYou got the prints two.\n\n49\n00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:40,380\nThere's other methods of project\nmanagement that are out there.\n\n50\n00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,480\nBut in the United States,\nthe PMI method is the most common.\n\n51\n00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,040\nThe other ones aren't bad.\n\n52\n00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,660\nIn fact, often times they're very similar.\n\n53\n00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,240\nThey kind of work together, they may\njust use different terminology and\n\n54\n00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,990\nthings like that.\n\n55\n00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,070\nSo be aware of that.\n\n56\n00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,960\nBut here in the US,\n\n57\n00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,180\nPMI's, their's is really kind of\nthe one that's the go-to guy, right?\n\n58\n00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,790\nThat's where the PMP comes in.\n\n59\n00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,060\nPMP or Project Management Professional, is\na certification that designates that you\n\n60\n00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,610\nhave the skills and knowledge, to manage\na project using all of the tools and\n\n61\n00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,080\nprocesses and\nall the stuff that PMI gives us.\n\n62\n00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,360\nThat framework.\n\n63\n00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,931\nAnd if you are a PMP certified project\nmanager, when you go to a company and\n\n64\n00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:27,280\nyou give them your resume they can\nlook at and they can say, all right,\n\n65\n00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,147\nthis guy already knows how to manage a\nproject the certain way, how they can get\n\n66\n00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:36,563\nin there and do this and it would be\na standard method so that if we have.\n\n67\n00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:39,810\nOther project managers come in they will\nbe able to understand what's going on.\n\n68\n00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,400\nI know that's a problem that\nI've bumped in too before.\n\n69\n00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400\nWhere you go to work somewhere and\n\n70\n00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,290\nthey have 12 different project managers,\nif they're all managing projects different\n\n71\n00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,660\nways it becomes really difficult to\nmonitor and exchange information.\n\n72\n00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:53,930\nAll right,\n\n73\n00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,790\nwith the PMI if we want to become a PMP,\na Project Managing Professional.\n\n74\n00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,330\nStep one on our journey, really needs\nto be going to the project management\n\n75\n00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,500\nprofessional, or to the PMI website,\nand downloading the PMP handbook.\n\n76\n00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,570\nThe PMP handbook really summarizes\neverything that we need to know about\n\n77\n00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,120\nthe certification, and\nwe'll go over it briefly in this video.\n\n78\n00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,660\nBut I encourage you guys\nto read it thoroughly,\n\n79\n00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,700\nespecially if you're going\nto pursue the certification.\n\n80\n00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,070\nIf you go to PMI.org that's the website,\nPMI.org.\n\n81\n00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,590\nYou'll see on that site,\nthere's a link for certification.\n\n82\n00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,120\nAnd if we go into that certification link,\nit'll take you in here where you can\n\n83\n00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,760\nstart to see information about the PMP and\nother certifications.\n\n84\n00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,200\nThere's a bunch of them over here.\n\n85\n00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,940\nCAPM, PMP, PGMP and so on.\n\n86\n00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,180\nThe industry leader,\nthe one everybody knows is the PMP.\n\n87\n00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,420\nAnd CAPM,\nlet's talk about that just a little bit.\n\n88\n00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,520\nThat's the Certified Associate\nin Project Management\n\n89\n00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,110\nvs Project Management Professional.\n\n90\n00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,160\nPMP is designed for project managers,\npeople who managing projects as their job.\n\n91\n00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,080\nThey need to be experts in every\naspect of project management.\n\n92\n00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,590\nCAPM, that is somebody who's\nnot project manager, but\n\n93\n00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,660\nworks in a project environment.\n\n94\n00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,690\nThey're a project team member or\nmaybe they're an accountant or\n\n95\n00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,360\nscheduling assistant or somebody like\nthat, who is not the project manager, but\n\n96\n00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,910\nit's operating in that world\non a constant basis, so\n\n97\n00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,210\nthey need to be familiar with\nthe various tools and techniques and\n\n98\n00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,260\nall of the other different things that\nare involved inside of managing a project.\n\n99\n00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,630\nNow, if you're on the fence between\nthe two, let me tell you this,\n\n100\n00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,510\nthey both have test questions that\npull from the same exact information.\n\n101\n00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,930\nThe way you study for CAPM,\nis the same way that you study for PMP.\n\n102\n00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840\nAs long as you meet the qualifications,\n\n103\n00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,190\nalmost everyone should go for the PMP, but\nnot everyone meets those qualifications.\n\n104\n00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,500\nNow, what are those qualifications?\n\n105\n00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,910\nThat's what we can find in the handbook.\n\n106\n00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,690\nI'm gonna browse to the PMP page here and,\nyou'll see on the PMP page,\n\n107\n00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,510\nright up at the top right here,\nwe've got the PMP handbook.\n\n108\n00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,550\nAnd I can just click on that,\nto get into the handbook.\n\n109\n00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,340\nIt's a PDF.\n\n110\n00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,640\nSo you can download it and save it.\n\n111\n00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,030\nAnd I know in the address bar\nup here it shows an ashx or\n\n112\n00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,810\nwhatever extension, but it is a PDF file.\n\n113\n00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,200\nAnd it lays out all the information\nyou need about the certification.\n\n114\n00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,040\nWhat it is, who really qualifies for\nit, how you can sign up for\n\n115\n00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,000\nit, where you can take it,\nall of that information is here.\n\n116\n00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,710\nThis is something that\nis really important,\n\n117\n00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,180\nevery single page has\nimportant data in it.\n\n118\n00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,690\nAll right, now I don't want to\nfocus on the whole thing though,\n\n119\n00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,040\nwe'd be here all day.\n\n120\n00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,400\nBut let's get to our requirements,\nhere we go.\n\n121\n00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,860\nThis is kind of laying out\nthe process we need to follow\n\n122\n00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,140\nif we want to become certified.\n\n123\n00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,280\nAnd basically,\nit goes through a few things.\n\n124\n00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,290\nYou send in an application,\nyou have to apply to take the exam,\n\n125\n00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,140\nyou can't just go and take the exam.\n\n126\n00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,230\nAnd in that application,\nyou have to designate you're experience.\n\n127\n00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,720\nThe information that you have gained over\nthe years as far as where you worked,\n\n128\n00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,240\nwhat you've done.\n\n129\n00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,080\nYou have to meet certain\nexperience levels.\n\n130\n00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,100\nAnd once you meet that,\nyou can then take the exam.\n\n131\n00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,220\nAnd so that's kind of what\nthey're highlighting here.\n\n132\n00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,580\nBut they actually don't break\ndown the true requirements there.\n\n133\n00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,390\nLet's find it, here, all right,\n\n134\n00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,360\nif you want to get your PMP,\nyou have to meet certain requirements,\n\n135\n00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,070\nwhich is what they're listing\nright here on this screen.\n\n136\n00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,600\nAnd, where's my little zoom in icon?\n\n137\n00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,850\nApparently I don't get that.\n\n138\n00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,130\nThere we go, so\nwhat you'll see is it is different\n\n139\n00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,760\nif you have a bachelor's degree or\nif you don't.\n\n140\n00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,860\nIf you have a college diploma, or the\nequivalent in your country, if you have\n\n141\n00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,260\na bachelor's degree, then what you\nneed is three years or 36 months.\n\n142\n00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,654\nOf unique none overlapping\nexperience in project management.\n\n143\n00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:00,860\nThat means, if you are managing\nthree projects at the same time,\n\n144\n00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,029\nyou only get credit for\none of them, right?\n\n145\n00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:10,634\nSo you've got to show that you've acquired\n4,500 hours as a project manager.\n\n146\n00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:14,415\nAnd they actually qualify it a little\nmore there, spent leading and\n\n147\n00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:16,090\ndirecting the project.\n\n148\n00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,580\nNot necessarily being the project manager,\n\n149\n00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,010\nyou might have been a team\nlead inside of the project.\n\n150\n00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,440\nThat's like a sub project manager.\n\n151\n00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,130\nSo that counts, too.\n\n152\n00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,040\nBut you'll see 4,500 hours there.\n\n153\n00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,710\nIf you don't have a degree,\nit's 7,500 hours.\n\n154\n00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,000\n7,500 hours over 5 years, non-overlapping.\n\n155\n00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,370\nSo in order to get the PMP,\n\n156\n00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,300\nyou really need to be a project\nmanager already, right?\n\n157\n00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,420\nWhat if you're not?\n\n158\n00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,920\nWell that's what the CAPM is for.\n\n159\n00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,100\nThe CAPM, the Certified Associate\nin Project Management,\n\n160\n00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,490\nit covers the same material,\nyou study the same way for it, but\n\n161\n00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,610\nit doesn't have\nthe requirement of experience.\n\n162\n00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,202\nYou don't have to show that\nyou have 4,000 or 7,000, or\n\n163\n00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:01,675\nwhatever hours of experience\nwhen you do the CAPM, all right.\n\n164\n00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:09,465\nAnd then, after that, both of them\nrequire 35 hours of education.\n\n165\n00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:14,402\nYou have to have attended 35 hours\nof training in project management.\n\n166\n00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:16,312\nNow, not necessarily PMP classes.\n\n167\n00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:19,682\nMaybe you've done Microsoft project or\n\n168\n00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:25,670\nTimberline training, or something like\nthat that pertain to your industry.\n\n169\n00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,110\nWell, that counts too, right?\n\n170\n00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,460\nSo you just have to submit that you\nattended those hours and those count.\n\n171\n00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,230\nSo you need 35 contact\nhours of formal education.\n\n172\n00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,610\nAll right, so\nthose are the main requirements.\n\n173\n00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,030\nIf you meet those requirements,\n\n174\n00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,910\nthen you can take pass and\nbecome certified with the PMP.\n\n175\n00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,550\nIf you don't meet these,\nyour application will be declined,\n\n176\n00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,350\nyou won't be allowed to take the exam.\n\n177\n00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,830\nSo that's the first thing\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n178\n00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,440\nNext, well then we're ready to certify,\nright?\n\n179\n00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,620\nAnd that's what this chart\nback here was showing,\n\n180\n00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,210\nis you submit your application that shows\nthat you met those requirements, right?\n\n181\n00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,090\nSo you basically\n\n182\n00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,890\nlet them know that you meet all\nthe requirements that were listed.\n\n183\n00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,780\nThen after that they review\nyour application, and\n\n184\n00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,660\nit says five days for the review,\nit's usually much, much shorter, right?\n\n185\n00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,190\nIt's been a long time since I did mine.\n\n186\n00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,640\nMine I think took maybe two days.\n\n187\n00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,710\nThen you have to pay.\n\n188\n00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,700\nYou do have to pay for the exam.\n\n189\n00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,588\nThey gotta get paid.\n\n190\n00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:28,730\n[LAUGH] So, you have to pay for the exam\nand then you go ahead and take it,\n\n191\n00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,850\nand hopefully pass.\n\n192\n00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,740\nNow once you pass the exam and\nnotice here from payment to test,\n\n193\n00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,870\nyou have to take the test within\none year of when you paid.\n\n194\n00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,850\nSo that's pretty important.\n\n195\n00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,250\nIf you don't, then you lose the money,\nand you gotta pay again,\n\n196\n00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,170\nthey don't do a refund on that.\n\n197\n00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,730\nOnce you become certified,\n\n198\n00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,420\nyou're then in the certification cycle,\nyou have to renew every three years.\n\n199\n00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,790\nAnd you can renew one\nof two different ways.\n\n200\n00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,110\nMethod one is to retake the exam, right?\n\n201\n00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,130\nBut if you're like me, once you take\nit you don't wanna take it again.\n\n202\n00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,680\nIt's a long exam.\n\n203\n00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,560\nSo method two is to do\ncontinuing education.\n\n204\n00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,130\nYou continue to learn,\nyou attend webinars, you attend classes,\n\n205\n00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,910\nyou get what are called professional\ndevelopment units, or PDUs, and\n\n206\n00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,370\nyou have to acquire 60 PDUs or\nbasically 60 hours every three years.\n\n207\n00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,450\nNow, I'll talk about something in a minute\nwhich is an easy way to get PDUs.\n\n208\n00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,940\nSo they're not hard to get, and\nthey can actually be done very,\n\n209\n00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,940\nvery inexpensively, but\nthey do need to be done.\n\n210\n00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,630\nSo, for example, I'm on my second\nrenewal cycle with PMI and so\n\n211\n00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,341\nfor me, I am continually doing activities\nto get more PDUs, it's important.\n\n212\n00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,450\nAright, so as long as that's done,\nyou stay certified and\n\n213\n00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,050\nyou can be certified for life,\nas long as you continue to do your PDUs.\n\n214\n00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,550\nIf you ever don't if you just stop,\nyou go on a one year suspension, so\n\n215\n00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,280\nyou have a chance to become current,\nbut if you don't do it then,\n\n216\n00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,560\nthen you've got to go and\npass the exam again.\n\n217\n00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,040\nSo that's kind of the process\nthat they follow.\n\n218\n00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,940\nSo the exam itself is administered through\nSylvan Centers in the United States and\n\n219\n00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,160\nother countries, because it's\nadministered in different places.\n\n220\n00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,779\nSo, definitely read through the handbook\nto find out where it's offered for\n\n221\n00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,460\nyour country.\n\n222\n00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,290\nThen, the exam itself,\nlet me just find the price here.\n\n223\n00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,750\nHere we go.\n\n224\n00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,930\nFor the exam,\nif you are doing the computer based\n\n225\n00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,980\ntesting, which is the standard method,\nyou'll see the exam is $405 for\n\n226\n00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,600\nPMI members, and it's $555 for\nnon PMI members.\n\n227\n00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,775\nWhat's this membership stuff?\n\n228\n00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:48,770\nPMI.org is a nonprofit organization,\n\n229\n00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,200\nand anyone, without limits,\ncan join the PMI.\n\n230\n00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,570\nSo you can become a member of the Project\nManagement Institute today, right now.\n\n231\n00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,100\nYou can go to their website,\nsign up and join the PMI.\n\n232\n00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,400\nIt's a great service.\n\n233\n00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,070\nI've been a PMI member for six years now,\nfive years, something like that,\n\n234\n00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,700\nand you get access to free webinars,\nwhich count for PDUs.\n\n235\n00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,200\nRight.\n\n236\n00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,600\nI get a good three PDUs a month\njust as part of my PMI membership.\n\n237\n00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,790\nYou get access to articles online.\n\n238\n00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,120\nYou get access to communities where you\ncan talk to other people that are in\n\n239\n00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,180\nyour industry.\n\n240\n00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,076\nYou also get a free copy of the PMBOK,\nthe Project Management Body of Knowledge,\n\n241\n00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,021\nthat big book.\n\n242\n00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:32,850\nRight.\nThat 700 page book you get a free copy.\n\n243\n00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,490\nIt's a PDF.\n\n244\n00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,320\nIt's a digital copy.\n\n245\n00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,855\nBut, believe me,\nyou wouldn't want the paper one.\n\n246\n00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:39,100\n[LAUGH] So,\nyou get that as part of your membership.\n\n247\n00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,900\nSo a lot of good value there.\n\n248\n00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,750\nBut another value is\nthe discount on the exam.\n\n249\n00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,170\nThat's $150 off the exam.\n\n250\n00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,150\nWell, it costs $129 per year\nto be a member of the PMI.\n\n251\n00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:58,710\nSo you pay $129 to save $150,\nit pays for itself.\n\n252\n00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,100\nAnd you get a year membership out of it.\n\n253\n00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,290\nNow, PMI does that on purpose because\nthey want you to stay a member.\n\n254\n00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,190\nPeople like me continue to stay\na member because I get value out of it.\n\n255\n00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,860\nBut here getting ready for\nthe exam you get two big things.\n\n256\n00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,830\nOne, you get the discount so\nit pays for itself.\n\n257\n00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,900\nWhy not do it?\n\n258\n00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,140\nAnd two, you get a copy of the PMBOK,\nwhich is what the test is based on.\n\n259\n00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,750\nThe PMP exam is full of questions\n\n260\n00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,300\npulled straight from\nthe Project Manager Body of Knowledge.\n\n261\n00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,420\nSo it's almost like having the answer key.\n\n262\n00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,780\nNow granted, it's a 700 page answer\nkey that you can't take with you.\n\n263\n00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,390\nBut [LAUGH] the information is there.\n\n264\n00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,590\nIt's worth it,\nyou do want to become a member.\n\n265\n00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,930\nYou'll see right there that cost, the $400\nand $555, depending on which way you go,\n\n266\n00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,940\nthat's how your price\nis gonna be determined.\n\n267\n00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,020\nNow if you do not pass the first time,\nyou can repeat the exam.\n\n268\n00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,880\nAnd when you repeat,\nthey do give you a discount.\n\n269\n00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,313\nSo you'll see members are $275,\n\n270\n00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:05,795\nnon-members are $375, so\na bit of a difference there.\n\n271\n00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:08,555\nSo that's kind of the exam cost.\n\n272\n00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:12,475\nWe sign up for the exam and\nwe go and take it,\n\n273\n00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:18,065\nat whatever testing provider is\navailable in the region that we're in.\n\n274\n00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:21,115\nFrom there, you're ready to take the exam.\n\n275\n00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:28,460\nThe PMP exam itself, it's 175 questions,\nI'm sorry, it's kind of confusing.\n\n276\n00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,480\nIt's 200 questions.\n\n277\n00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,580\nOnly 175 actually count\ntowards your score.\n\n278\n00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:38,603\nThe other 25,\nthey're kind of like beta questions.\n\n279\n00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:39,705\nThey're trying you out.\n\n280\n00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,180\nThey call them pre-test.\n\n281\n00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,970\nTo see if they work, if the questions are\ngood if people are getting them right at\n\n282\n00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,500\nthe average amount that they look for,\nthen those will become real questions for\n\n283\n00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,590\nother people.\n\n284\n00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,350\nIf they don't work,\n\n285\n00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,000\nif a lot of people are getting them wrong,\nthen PMI will remove them.\n\n286\n00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,460\nThe thing is, they don't tell you\nwhich questions are pretest and\n\n287\n00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,224\nwhich ones aren't.\n\n288\n00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:03,710\nSo when you take the exam\nyou get 200 questions.\n\n289\n00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,009\nYou have to treat them\nall as if they were real.\n\n290\n00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:06,948\nYou don't know which 25 don't count.\n\n291\n00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:14,444\nSo, while it's a 200 question exam,\nonly 175 actually count to your score.\n\n292\n00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:16,841\nAll right?\nIt is a four hour exam, and\n\n293\n00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:21,898\nif you're like me,\nI went to three hours and 59 minutes.\n\n294\n00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,970\nI mean,\nI went right to the end of that exam.\n\n295\n00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,660\nIt just depends on the person, though.\n\n296\n00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,212\nI've heard of people getting in and\nout of there, in like two hours,\n\n297\n00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:29,960\nwhich blew my mind.\n\n298\n00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,990\nBut, if you are a focused and\nreally detail oriented\n\n299\n00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,320\ntester like I am,\nyou'll take up that whole time.\n\n300\n00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,988\nIt's a long one.\n\n301\n00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:46,620\nOne point, I do wanna make is,\nyou can take breaks during the exam.\n\n302\n00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,445\nMm-hm.\n\n303\n00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:49,095\nIt says no scheduled breaks [SOUND].\n\n304\n00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:52,512\nBut, you can take your own breaks if you\nwant, if you need to go to the restroom or\n\n305\n00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,405\nwhatever.\n\n306\n00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:55,215\nBut the timer doesn't stop.\n\n307\n00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,055\nWhen that 4 hour timer starts, it's going.\n\n308\n00:16:58,055 --> 00:17:00,825\nSo, if you take a 15 minute\nbreak to use the restroom,\n\n309\n00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:02,465\nyou just lost 15 minutes on the exam.\n\n310\n00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:06,745\nSo be aware of that, you want to stay\nfocused and get through the exam.\n\n311\n00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,900\nAll right, the exam itself is\npulled right from the PMBOK.\n\n312\n00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,860\nAnd in the real show,\n\n313\n00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,300\nwe're gonna talk about the different\nproject phases that are out there.\n\n314\n00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,250\nPMI breaks a project into five phases,\n\n315\n00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,520\nand they're just showing here the way that\nquestions break down percentage wise.\n\n316\n00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,740\nSo initiation is 13% of the exam,\nand then so on, as it breaks down.\n\n317\n00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,220\nYou'll see that executing is probably\nthe largest portion of the exam, but\n\n318\n00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,030\nplanning and monitoring, and\ncontrolling are another big portion.\n\n319\n00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,250\nEverything else is kind\nof spread out from there.\n\n320\n00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:44,530\nAll right, and I think that's really\nabout it that we need from here.\n\n321\n00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,910\nSeems like there was one other thing.\n\n322\n00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,890\nLet me just skim through here real\nquick to see if I can spot it.\n\n323\n00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,840\nI mean there's a ton of information.\n\n324\n00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,720\nOne of my favorite things about the PMI,\n\n325\n00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,900\nis they post all of their phone\nnumbers right here in the handbook.\n\n326\n00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,050\nAnd I've called probably three\ntimes over the years, and\n\n327\n00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,760\nevery time,\nI got a human being answering the phone.\n\n328\n00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,150\nIt's just unheard of,\nno computer menu or anything.\n\n329\n00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,220\nI actually got a person.\n\n330\n00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,170\nSo, if you ever have\na question on this stuff,\n\n331\n00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,420\nif you're not sure where to sign up or\nwhatever, just give them a phone call.\n\n332\n00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,730\nAll the phone numbers are right there,\nin the handbook.\n\n333\n00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,420\nIt's a valuable thing to have.\n\n334\n00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:20,930\nLet's see.\n\n335\n00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,320\nThat is for the other stuff.\n\n336\n00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,590\nYeah, that's the main stuff from here.\n\n337\n00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,140\nLike I said, there is a lot of good\nstuff in this handbook though.\n\n338\n00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,320\nSo, go and download it.\n\n339\n00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,560\nIt is good information for you.\n\n340\n00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,382\nAll right, once you become a PMP.\n\n341\n00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:38,204\nOnce you're certified, you've shown\nthat you have an understanding of,\n\n342\n00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:42,120\nhow the project management\ninstitute's framework functions.\n\n343\n00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,820\nNow, you turn around and\nyou apply it at your organization.\n\n344\n00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,070\nThere's many organizations that require\ntheir project managers to be a PMP\n\n345\n00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,300\ncertified PM, and\nthat's a good thing, in my opinion.\n\n346\n00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,910\nIt is really handy.\n\n347\n00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,102\nIf you step into a project mid-stream,\n\n348\n00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:59,310\nlike mid-project, if they've been\nfollowing the PMI framework, it's\n\n349\n00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,380\nsuper easy to get jump started, get in\nthere, and start working in the project.\n\n350\n00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,260\nIf they've just done fly by, the seat of\ntheir pants, make up their own stuff,\n\n351\n00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,940\nit's really difficult to get up to speed,\nand make sure everything's in place.\n\n352\n00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,475\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat the PMI framework does.\n\n353\n00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:14,420\nMm-hm.\n\n354\n00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,790\nSo.\n\n355\n00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,360\nAll right.\nRonnie,\n\n356\n00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,610\nI think that's a pretty good summary\nof the PMP, and kinda what's involved.\n\n357\n00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,890\nYou think anything I left out?\n\n358\n00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,590\nNope.\nJust remember as much as you can.\n\n359\n00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,530\nYou can actually go and register, just for\na free account right now at the PMI, and\n\n360\n00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,490\nthat way you can get access at\nleast to some of those articles.\n\n361\n00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,780\nThey're not gonna give\nyou access to everything,\n\n362\n00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,950\nbut it's a great resource for\nyou to actually begin in.\n\n363\n00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,810\nAnd so once it asks you to do that, that\nwill again get you familiar with a lot of\n\n364\n00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,710\nthe terms and concepts to begin there,\nand look forward to again.\n\n365\n00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,960\nSeeing what else you actually have\navailable to you and the way that it\n\n366\n00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,860\nactually opens doors in the future for\nyou as well, once you're PMP certified.\n\n367\n00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,390\nAnd I do wanna throw out one more thing,\n\n368\n00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,850\nit was the thing I was\nthinking of a moment ago.\n\n369\n00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,020\nIn a lot of our shows, we go really\nin depth into our content, and\n\n370\n00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,520\nwe talk about everything\nthat's gonna be on the exam.\n\n371\n00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,970\nAnd what we try to do, is we try to make\nit where our show contains everything you\n\n372\n00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,760\nneed to know for the exam.\n\n373\n00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,340\nWell, with the PMP we'll do the same, so\n\n374\n00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,580\nno different from any other show,\nbut it is so much information.\n\n375\n00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,800\nThere is so much, and a lot of it is kind\nof open to interpretation in some cases.\n\n376\n00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,310\nBut this is one of the few cases,\n\n377\n00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,820\nwhere I really do recommend\nthat you purchase a textbook.\n\n378\n00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,280\nA book to use kind of in conjunction\nwith our videos is really handy,\n\n379\n00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,250\nreally helps to make sure that you've\ngot a good understanding of the content.\n\n380\n00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,685\nAnd there's one book in\nparticular that I recommend, and\n\n381\n00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:41,290\nI don't make any money on this or\nanything.\n\n382\n00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,356\nSo, I'm just going straight to Amazon.\n\n383\n00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:47,872\nAnd on amazon.com they\nhave this book here.\n\n384\n00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,974\nIt's written by Joseph Phillips.\n\n385\n00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,067\nThe author.\nIt's the CAPM,\n\n386\n00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,220\nPMP all-in-one certification guide.\n\n387\n00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,050\nRemember what I said at the beginning\nof this little special is,\n\n388\n00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,280\nyou study the same way for both\ncertifications, so it's just one book.\n\n389\n00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,660\nAnd it's a really good book.\n\n390\n00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,906\nIt's big, but he takes all the data and\nhe puts it into a logical order,\n\n391\n00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:11,080\nit's very well written,\nvery easy to understand.\n\n392\n00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,300\nIt has a CD in the back,\n\n393\n00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,250\nit has some practice questions\nas well as a PDF of the book.\n\n394\n00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,650\nSo, it's just an all\naround good book to use.\n\n395\n00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,100\nSo, if you're gonna buy just\none book I recommend this one.\n\n396\n00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,960\nIt's only $30 and hardcover.\n\n397\n00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,700\nI bought the Kindle edition a while back,\nand that's under $30 also.\n\n398\n00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,970\nSo, it's definitely something\nthat you can make use of.\n\n399\n00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,430\nAnd it's a really good one, especially for\ntaking notes and kinda following along,\n\n400\n00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,050\nit's pretty handy.\n\n401\n00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,620\nSo, that's about all I've got for the PMP.\n\n402\n00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,230\nSo, if you have any questions,\njust feel free to reach out to us.\n\n403\n00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,965\nWe've got the Q&A section on the website,\nor\n\n404\n00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:48,663\nyou can always shoot us an email or\nwhatever?\n\n405\n00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:51,297\nBut, hopefully that kind of answers\nany questions you had about\n\n406\n00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:52,482\nthe certification itself.\n\n407\n00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,166\nNow we're ready for the show.\n\n408\n00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,047\n[SOUND]\n\n",
