certification\n\n3\n00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:15,220\nfrom the Project Management Institute,\nor PMI.\n\n4\n00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,270\nWe get [LAUGH] a little [LAUGH]\nAcronym soup on this one.\n\n5\n00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,192\nThe The PMI's PMP certification.\n\n6\n00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:24,430\n[LAUGH] It's a bit of a mouthful.\n\n7\n00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,710\nIt is a industry recognized project\nmanagement certification, and if you're\n\n8\n00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,430\nnot familiar with project management\nin general, well, let me tell you.\n\n9\n00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,480\nIt's a hot button issue with\na lot of organizations.\n\n10\n00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,380\nWe're starting to see more and more\ncompanies move towards formalized project\n\n11\n00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,520\nmanagement frameworks, and there's\na number of frameworks that are out there,\n\n12\n00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,790\ncompanies that are free to pick and\n\n13\n00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,880\nchoose whatever they want, but PMI,\nthe Project Management Institute,\n\n14\n00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,330\nthey are a non-profit organization\nthat was formed over 20 years ago.\n\n15\n00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,730\nThey've been around a while.\n\n16\n00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,510\nAnd they're idea was hey, if you learn\nhow to manage a project for one company,\n\n17\n00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,160\nand then you go to a second company you\nhaven't to start over from scratch.\n\n18\n00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,110\nThere's a lot of stuff that's\ndone that's the same, and so\n\n19\n00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,300\nthey set out to create a framework.\n\n20\n00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,980\nA collection of processes that you\ncan use, to help manage projects.\n\n21\n00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,210\nThe idea being that whether you're\nin construction, or medical,\n\n22\n00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,630\nor IT, or whatever,\nthat a project is a project.\n\n23\n00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,690\nThey all have the same fundamental\nmethods for managing them.\n\n24\n00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,270\nAnd ensuring success.\n\n25\n00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,980\nSo they put all that\ntogether into one big giant\n\n26\n00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,590\nbook called the Project Management Body\nof Knowledge.\n\n27\n00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,458\nAnd it is a big book,\nwhat is it now, Ronnie?\n\n28\n00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,110\nIt's like.\nOver 600, 700 pages.\n\n29\n00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,170\nYeah, it's massive.\n\n30\n00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,790\nYeah.\nAnd what they did is, they just took ways\n\n31\n00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,840\nthat people were managing projects,\nthey made them a little more generic so\n\n32\n00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,930\nthey applied to any industry and\nput them together in this big book.\n\n33\n00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,700\nAnd the idea is that if companies want\nto implement formal project management,\n\n34\n00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,680\ninstead of starting from scratch,\nthey can just grab the PMI's model,\n\n35\n00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680\ntheir framework.\n\n36\n00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,110\nAnd you don't have to do the whole thing;\nit's often times overkill for small and\n\n37\n00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,260\nmedium businesses.\n\n38\n00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,530\nYou can pick and choice the components\nthat you want that are appropriate for\n\n39\n00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,840\nyour organization that help\nyou manage and, ultimately,\n\n40\n00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,650\nbe successful in the project.\n\n41\n00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,450\nIt's really cool.\n\n42\n00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,350\nIt's really flexible.\n\n43\n00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,470\nThat's kind of a nice thing to have\navailable and that's made it really\n\n44\n00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,520\nattractive to a lot of companies,\nin the United States the PMP or\n\n45\n00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,330\nthe PMI framework is the most common\nstandardized form of project management.\n\n46\n00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,030\nThere's other ones out there.\n\n47\n00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,450\nThe whole ISO 9000 series or\n20,000 series.\n\n48\n00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,142\nYou got the prints two.\n\n49\n00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:40,380\nThere's other methods of project\nmanagement that are out there.\n\n50\n00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,480\nBut in the United States,\nthe PMI method is the most common.\n\n51\n00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,040\nThe other ones aren't bad.\n\n52\n00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,660\nIn fact, often times they're very similar.\n\n53\n00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,240\nThey kind of work together, they may\njust use different terminology and\n\n54\n00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,990\nthings like that.\n\n55\n00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,070\nSo be aware of that.\n\n56\n00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,960\nBut here in the US,\n\n57\n00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,180\nPMI's, their's is really kind of\nthe one that's the go-to guy, right?\n\n58\n00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,790\nThat's where the PMP comes in.\n\n59\n00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,060\nPMP or Project Management Professional, is\na certification that designates that you\n\n60\n00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,610\nhave the skills and knowledge, to manage\na project using all of the tools and\n\n61\n00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,080\nprocesses and\nall the stuff that PMI gives us.\n\n62\n00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,360\nThat framework.\n\n63\n00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,931\nAnd if you are a PMP certified project\nmanager, when you go to a company and\n\n64\n00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:27,280\nyou give them your resume they can\nlook at and they can say, all right,\n\n65\n00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,147\nthis guy already knows how to manage a\nproject the certain way, how they can get\n\n66\n00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:36,563\nin there and do this and it would be\na standard method so that if we have.\n\n67\n00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:39,810\nOther project managers come in they will\nbe able to understand what's going on.\n\n68\n00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,400\nI know that's a problem that\nI've bumped in too before.\n\n69\n00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400\nWhere you go to work somewhere and\n\n70\n00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,290\nthey have 12 different project managers,\nif they're all managing projects different\n\n71\n00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,660\nways it becomes really difficult to\nmonitor and exchange information.\n\n72\n00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:53,930\nAll right,\n\n73\n00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,790\nwith the PMI if we want to become a PMP,\na Project Managing Professional.\n\n74\n00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,330\nStep one on our journey, really needs\nto be going to the project management\n\n75\n00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,500\nprofessional, or to the PMI website,\nand downloading the PMP handbook.\n\n76\n00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,570\nThe PMP handbook really summarizes\neverything that we need to know about\n\n77\n00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,120\nthe certification, and\nwe'll go over it briefly in this video.\n\n78\n00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,660\nBut I encourage you guys\nto read it thoroughly,\n\n79\n00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,700\nespecially if you're going\nto pursue the certification.\n\n80\n00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,070\nIf you go to PMI.org that's the website,\nPMI.org.\n\n81\n00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,590\nYou'll see on that site,\nthere's a link for certification.\n\n82\n00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,120\nAnd if we go into that certification link,\nit'll take you in here where you can\n\n83\n00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,760\nstart to see information about the PMP and\nother certifications.\n\n84\n00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,200\nThere's a bunch of them over here.\n\n85\n00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,940\nCAPM, PMP, PGMP and so on.\n\n86\n00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,180\nThe industry leader,\nthe one everybody knows is the PMP.\n\n87\n00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,420\nAnd CAPM,\nlet's talk about that just a little bit.\n\n88\n00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,520\nThat's the Certified Associate\nin Project Management\n\n89\n00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,110\nvs Project Management Professional.\n\n90\n00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,160\nPMP is designed for project managers,\npeople who managing projects as their job.\n\n91\n00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,080\nThey need to be experts in every\naspect of project management.\n\n92\n00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,590\nCAPM, that is somebody who's\nnot project manager, but\n\n93\n00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,660\nworks in a project environment.\n\n94\n00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,690\nThey're a project team member or\nmaybe they're an accountant or\n\n95\n00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,360\nscheduling assistant or somebody like\nthat, who is not the project manager, but\n\n96\n00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,910\nit's operating in that world\non a constant basis, so\n\n97\n00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,210\nthey need to be familiar with\nthe various tools and techniques and\n\n98\n00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,260\nall of the other different things that\nare involved inside of managing a project.\n\n99\n00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,630\nNow, if you're on the fence between\nthe two, let me tell you this,\n\n100\n00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,510\nthey both have test questions that\npull from the same exact information.\n\n101\n00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,930\nThe way you study for CAPM,\nis the same way that you study for PMP.\n\n102\n00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840\nAs long as you meet the qualifications,\n\n103\n00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,190\nalmost everyone should go for the PMP, but\nnot everyone meets those qualifications.\n\n104\n00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,500\nNow, what are those qualifications?\n\n105\n00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,910\nThat's what we can find in the handbook.\n\n106\n00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,690\nI'm gonna browse to the PMP page here and,\nyou'll see on the PMP page,\n\n107\n00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,510\nright up at the top right here,\nwe've got the PMP handbook.\n\n108\n00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,550\nAnd I can just click on that,\nto get into the handbook.\n\n109\n00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,340\nIt's a PDF.\n\n110\n00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,640\nSo you can download it and save it.\n\n111\n00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,030\nAnd I know in the address bar\nup here it shows an ashx or\n\n112\n00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,810\nwhatever extension, but it is a PDF file.\n\n113\n00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,200\nAnd it lays out all the information\nyou need about the certification.\n\n114\n00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,040\nWhat it is, who really qualifies for\nit, how you can sign up for\n\n115\n00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,000\nit, where you can take it,\nall of that information is here.\n\n116\n00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,710\nThis is something that\nis really important,\n\n117\n00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,180\nevery single page has\nimportant data in it.\n\n118\n00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,690\nAll right, now I don't want to\nfocus on the whole thing though,\n\n119\n00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,040\nwe'd be here all day.\n\n120\n00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,400\nBut let's get to our requirements,\nhere we go.\n\n121\n00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,860\nThis is kind of laying out\nthe process we need to follow\n\n122\n00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,140\nif we want to become certified.\n\n123\n00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,280\nAnd basically,\nit goes through a few things.\n\n124\n00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,290\nYou send in an application,\nyou have to apply to take the exam,\n\n125\n00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,140\nyou can't just go and take the exam.\n\n126\n00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,230\nAnd in that application,\nyou have to designate you're experience.\n\n127\n00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,720\nThe information that you have gained over\nthe years as far as where you worked,\n\n128\n00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,240\nwhat you've done.\n\n129\n00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,080\nYou have to meet certain\nexperience levels.\n\n130\n00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,100\nAnd once you meet that,\nyou can then take the exam.\n\n131\n00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,220\nAnd so that's kind of what\nthey're highlighting here.\n\n132\n00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,580\nBut they actually don't break\ndown the true requirements there.\n\n133\n00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,390\nLet's find it, here, all right,\n\n134\n00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,360\nif you want to get your PMP,\nyou have to meet certain requirements,\n\n135\n00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,070\nwhich is what they're listing\nright here on this screen.\n\n136\n00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,600\nAnd, where's my little zoom in icon?\n\n137\n00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,850\nApparently I don't get that.\n\n138\n00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,130\nThere we go, so\nwhat you'll see is it is different\n\n139\n00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,760\nif you have a bachelor's degree or\nif you don't.\n\n140\n00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,860\nIf you have a college diploma, or the\nequivalent in your country, if you have\n\n141\n00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,260\na bachelor's degree, then what you\nneed is three years or 36 months.\n\n142\n00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,654\nOf unique none overlapping\nexperience in project management.\n\n143\n00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:00,860\nThat means, if you are managing\nthree projects at the same time,\n\n144\n00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,029\nyou only get credit for\none of them, right?\n\n145\n00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:10,634\nSo you've got to show that you've acquired\n4,500 hours as a project manager.\n\n146\n00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:14,415\nAnd they actually qualify it a little\nmore there, spent leading and\n\n147\n00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:16,090\ndirecting the project.\n\n148\n00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,580\nNot necessarily being the project manager,\n\n149\n00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,010\nyou might have been a team\nlead inside of the project.\n\n150\n00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,440\nThat's like a sub project manager.\n\n151\n00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,130\nSo that counts, too.\n\n152\n00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,040\nBut you'll see 4,500 hours there.\n\n153\n00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,710\nIf you don't have a degree,\nit's 7,500 hours.\n\n154\n00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,000\n7,500 hours over 5 years, non-overlapping.\n\n155\n00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,370\nSo in order to get the PMP,\n\n156\n00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,300\nyou really need to be a project\nmanager already, right?\n\n157\n00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,420\nWhat if you're not?\n\n158\n00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,920\nWell that's what the CAPM is for.\n\n159\n00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,100\nThe CAPM, the Certified Associate\nin Project Management,\n\n160\n00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,490\nit covers the same material,\nyou study the same way for it, but\n\n161\n00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,610\nit doesn't have\nthe requirement of experience.\n\n162\n00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,202\nYou don't have to show that\nyou have 4,000 or 7,000, or\n\n163\n00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:01,675\nwhatever hours of experience\nwhen you do the CAPM, all right.\n\n164\n00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:09,465\nAnd then, after that, both of them\nrequire 35 hours of education.\n\n165\n00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:14,402\nYou have to have attended 35 hours\nof training in project management.\n\n166\n00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:16,312\nNow, not necessarily PMP classes.\n\n167\n00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:19,682\nMaybe you've done Microsoft project or\n\n168\n00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:25,670\nTimberline training, or something like\nthat that pertain to your industry.\n\n169\n00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,110\nWell, that counts too, right?\n\n170\n00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,460\nSo you just have to submit that you\nattended those hours and those count.\n\n171\n00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,230\nSo you need 35 contact\nhours of formal education.\n\n172\n00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,610\nAll right, so\nthose are the main requirements.\n\n173\n00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,030\nIf you meet those requirements,\n\n174\n00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,910\nthen you can take pass and\nbecome certified with the PMP.\n\n175\n00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,550\nIf you don't meet these,\nyour application will be declined,\n\n176\n00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,350\nyou won't be allowed to take the exam.\n\n177\n00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,830\nSo that's the first thing\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n178\n00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,440\nNext, well then we're ready to certify,\nright?\n\n179\n00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,620\nAnd that's what this chart\nback here was showing,\n\n180\n00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,210\nis you submit your application that shows\nthat you met those requirements, right?\n\n181\n00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,090\nSo you basically\n\n182\n00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,890\nlet them know that you meet all\nthe requirements that were listed.\n\n183\n00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,780\nThen after that they review\nyour application, and\n\n184\n00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,660\nit says five days for the review,\nit's usually much, much shorter, right?\n\n185\n00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,190\nIt's been a long time since I did mine.\n\n186\n00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,640\nMine I think took maybe two days.\n\n187\n00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,710\nThen you have to pay.\n\n188\n00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,700\nYou do have to pay for the exam.\n\n189\n00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,588\nThey gotta get paid.\n\n190\n00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:28,730\n[LAUGH] So, you have to pay for the exam\nand then you go ahead and take it,\n\n191\n00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,850\nand hopefully pass.\n\n192\n00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,740\nNow once you pass the exam and\nnotice here from payment to test,\n\n193\n00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,870\nyou have to take the test within\none year of when you paid.\n\n194\n00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,850\nSo that's pretty important.\n\n195\n00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,250\nIf you don't, then you lose the money,\nand you gotta pay again,\n\n196\n00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,170\nthey don't do a refund on that.\n\n197\n00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,730\nOnce you become certified,\n\n198\n00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,420\nyou're then in the certification cycle,\nyou have to renew every three years.\n\n199\n00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,790\nAnd you can renew one\nof two different ways.\n\n200\n00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,110\nMethod one is to retake the exam, right?\n\n201\n00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,130\nBut if you're like me, once you take\nit you don't wanna take it again.\n\n202\n00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,680\nIt's a long exam.\n\n203\n00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,560\nSo method two is to do\ncontinuing education.\n\n204\n00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,130\nYou continue to learn,\nyou attend webinars, you attend classes,\n\n205\n00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,910\nyou get what are called professional\ndevelopment units, or PDUs, and\n\n206\n00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,370\nyou have to acquire 60 PDUs or\nbasically 60 hours every three years.\n\n207\n00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,450\nNow, I'll talk about something in a minute\nwhich is an easy way to get PDUs.\n\n208\n00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,940\nSo they're not hard to get, and\nthey can actually be done very,\n\n209\n00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,940\nvery inexpensively, but\nthey do need to be done.\n\n210\n00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,630\nSo, for example, I'm on my second\nrenewal cycle with PMI and so\n\n211\n00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,341\nfor me, I am continually doing activities\nto get more PDUs, it's important.\n\n212\n00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,450\nAright, so as long as that's done,\nyou stay certified and\n\n213\n00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,050\nyou can be certified for life,\nas long as you continue to do your PDUs.\n\n214\n00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,550\nIf you ever don't if you just stop,\nyou go on a one year suspension, so\n\n215\n00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,280\nyou have a chance to become current,\nbut if you don't do it then,\n\n216\n00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,560\nthen you've got to go and\npass the exam again.\n\n217\n00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,040\nSo that's kind of the process\nthat they follow.\n\n218\n00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,940\nSo the exam itself is administered through\nSylvan Centers in the United States and\n\n219\n00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,160\nother countries, because it's\nadministered in different places.\n\n220\n00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,779\nSo, definitely read through the handbook\nto find out where it's offered for\n\n221\n00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,460\nyour country.\n\n222\n00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,290\nThen, the exam itself,\nlet me just find the price here.\n\n223\n00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,750\nHere we go.\n\n224\n00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,930\nFor the exam,\nif you are doing the computer based\n\n225\n00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,980\ntesting, which is the standard method,\nyou'll see the exam is $405 for\n\n226\n00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,600\nPMI members, and it's $555 for\nnon PMI members.\n\n227\n00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,775\nWhat's this membership stuff?\n\n228\n00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:48,770\nPMI.org is a nonprofit organization,\n\n229\n00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,200\nand anyone, without limits,\ncan join the PMI.\n\n230\n00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,570\nSo you can become a member of the Project\nManagement Institute today, right now.\n\n231\n00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,100\nYou can go to their website,\nsign up and join the PMI.\n\n232\n00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,400\nIt's a great service.\n\n233\n00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,070\nI've been a PMI member for six years now,\nfive years, something like that,\n\n234\n00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,700\nand you get access to free webinars,\nwhich count for PDUs.\n\n235\n00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,200\nRight.\n\n236\n00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,600\nI get a good three PDUs a month\njust as part of my PMI membership.\n\n237\n00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,790\nYou get access to articles online.\n\n238\n00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,120\nYou get access to communities where you\ncan talk to other people that are in\n\n239\n00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,180\nyour industry.\n\n240\n00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,076\nYou also get a free copy of the PMBOK,\nthe Project Management Body of Knowledge,\n\n241\n00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,021\nthat big book.\n\n242\n00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:32,850\nRight.\nThat 700 page book you get a free copy.\n\n243\n00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,490\nIt's a PDF.\n\n244\n00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,320\nIt's a digital copy.\n\n245\n00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,855\nBut, believe me,\nyou wouldn't want the paper one.\n\n246\n00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:39,100\n[LAUGH] So,\nyou get that as part of your membership.\n\n247\n00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,900\nSo a lot of good value there.\n\n248\n00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,750\nBut another value is\nthe discount on the exam.\n\n249\n00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,170\nThat's $150 off the exam.\n\n250\n00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,150\nWell, it costs $129 per year\nto be a member of the PMI.\n\n251\n00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:58,710\nSo you pay $129 to save $150,\nit pays for itself.\n\n252\n00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,100\nAnd you get a year membership out of it.\n\n253\n00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,290\nNow, PMI does that on purpose because\nthey want you to stay a member.\n\n254\n00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,190\nPeople like me continue to stay\na member because I get value out of it.\n\n255\n00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,860\nBut here getting ready for\nthe exam you get two big things.\n\n256\n00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,830\nOne, you get the discount so\nit pays for itself.\n\n257\n00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,900\nWhy not do it?\n\n258\n00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,140\nAnd two, you get a copy of the PMBOK,\nwhich is what the test is based on.\n\n259\n00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,750\nThe PMP exam is full of questions\n\n260\n00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,300\npulled straight from\nthe Project Manager Body of Knowledge.\n\n261\n00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,420\nSo it's almost like having the answer key.\n\n262\n00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,780\nNow granted, it's a 700 page answer\nkey that you can't take with you.\n\n263\n00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,390\nBut [LAUGH] the information is there.\n\n264\n00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,590\nIt's worth it,\nyou do want to become a member.\n\n265\n00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,930\nYou'll see right there that cost, the $400\nand $555, depending on which way you go,\n\n266\n00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,940\nthat's how your price\nis gonna be determined.\n\n267\n00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,020\nNow if you do not pass the first time,\nyou can repeat the exam.\n\n268\n00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,880\nAnd when you repeat,\nthey do give you a discount.\n\n269\n00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,313\nSo you'll see members are $275,\n\n270\n00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:05,795\nnon-members are $375, so\na bit of a difference there.\n\n271\n00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:08,555\nSo that's kind of the exam cost.\n\n272\n00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:12,475\nWe sign up for the exam and\nwe go and take it,\n\n273\n00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:18,065\nat whatever testing provider is\navailable in the region that we're in.\n\n274\n00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:21,115\nFrom there, you're ready to take the exam.\n\n275\n00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:28,460\nThe PMP exam itself, it's 175 questions,\nI'm sorry, it's kind of confusing.\n\n276\n00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,480\nIt's 200 questions.\n\n277\n00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,580\nOnly 175 actually count\ntowards your score.\n\n278\n00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:38,603\nThe other 25,\nthey're kind of like beta questions.\n\n279\n00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:39,705\nThey're trying you out.\n\n280\n00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,180\nThey call them pre-test.\n\n281\n00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,970\nTo see if they work, if the questions are\ngood if people are getting them right at\n\n282\n00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,500\nthe average amount that they look for,\nthen those will become real questions for\n\n283\n00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,590\nother people.\n\n284\n00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,350\nIf they don't work,\n\n285\n00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,000\nif a lot of people are getting them wrong,\nthen PMI will remove them.\n\n286\n00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,460\nThe thing is, they don't tell you\nwhich questions are pretest and\n\n287\n00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,224\nwhich ones aren't.\n\n288\n00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:03,710\nSo when you take the exam\nyou get 200 questions.\n\n289\n00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,009\nYou have to treat them\nall as if they were real.\n\n290\n00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:06,948\nYou don't know which 25 don't count.\n\n291\n00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:14,444\nSo, while it's a 200 question exam,\nonly 175 actually count to your score.\n\n292\n00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:16,841\nAll right?\nIt is a four hour exam, and\n\n293\n00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:21,898\nif you're like me,\nI went to three hours and 59 minutes.\n\n294\n00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,970\nI mean,\nI went right to the end of that exam.\n\n295\n00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,660\nIt just depends on the person, though.\n\n296\n00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,212\nI've heard of people getting in and\nout of there, in like two hours,\n\n297\n00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:29,960\nwhich blew my mind.\n\n298\n00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,990\nBut, if you are a focused and\nreally detail oriented\n\n299\n00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,320\ntester like I am,\nyou'll take up that whole time.\n\n300\n00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,988\nIt's a long one.\n\n301\n00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:46,620\nOne point, I do wanna make is,\nyou can take breaks during the exam.\n\n302\n00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,445\nMm-hm.\n\n303\n00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:49,095\nIt says no scheduled breaks [SOUND].\n\n304\n00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:52,512\nBut, you can take your own breaks if you\nwant, if you need to go to the restroom or\n\n305\n00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,405\nwhatever.\n\n306\n00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:55,215\nBut the timer doesn't stop.\n\n307\n00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,055\nWhen that 4 hour timer starts, it's going.\n\n308\n00:16:58,055 --> 00:17:00,825\nSo, if you take a 15 minute\nbreak to use the restroom,\n\n309\n00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:02,465\nyou just lost 15 minutes on the exam.\n\n310\n00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:06,745\nSo be aware of that, you want to stay\nfocused and get through the exam.\n\n311\n00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,900\nAll right, the exam itself is\npulled right from the PMBOK.\n\n312\n00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,860\nAnd in the real show,\n\n313\n00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,300\nwe're gonna talk about the different\nproject phases that are out there.\n\n314\n00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,250\nPMI breaks a project into five phases,\n\n315\n00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,520\nand they're just showing here the way that\nquestions break down percentage wise.\n\n316\n00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,740\nSo initiation is 13% of the exam,\nand then so on, as it breaks down.\n\n317\n00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,220\nYou'll see that executing is probably\nthe largest portion of the exam, but\n\n318\n00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,030\nplanning and monitoring, and\ncontrolling are another big portion.\n\n319\n00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,250\nEverything else is kind\nof spread out from there.\n\n320\n00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:44,530\nAll right, and I think that's really\nabout it that we need from here.\n\n321\n00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,910\nSeems like there was one other thing.\n\n322\n00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,890\nLet me just skim through here real\nquick to see if I can spot it.\n\n323\n00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,840\nI mean there's a ton of information.\n\n324\n00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,720\nOne of my favorite things about the PMI,\n\n325\n00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,900\nis they post all of their phone\nnumbers right here in the handbook.\n\n326\n00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,050\nAnd I've called probably three\ntimes over the years, and\n\n327\n00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,760\nevery time,\nI got a human being answering the phone.\n\n328\n00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,150\nIt's just unheard of,\nno computer menu or anything.\n\n329\n00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,220\nI actually got a person.\n\n330\n00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,170\nSo, if you ever have\na question on this stuff,\n\n331\n00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,420\nif you're not sure where to sign up or\nwhatever, just give them a phone call.\n\n332\n00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,730\nAll the phone numbers are right there,\nin the handbook.\n\n333\n00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,420\nIt's a valuable thing to have.\n\n334\n00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:20,930\nLet's see.\n\n335\n00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,320\nThat is for the other stuff.\n\n336\n00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,590\nYeah, that's the main stuff from here.\n\n337\n00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,140\nLike I said, there is a lot of good\nstuff in this handbook though.\n\n338\n00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,320\nSo, go and download it.\n\n339\n00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,560\nIt is good information for you.\n\n340\n00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,382\nAll right, once you become a PMP.\n\n341\n00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:38,204\nOnce you're certified, you've shown\nthat you have an understanding of,\n\n342\n00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:42,120\nhow the project management\ninstitute's framework functions.\n\n343\n00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,820\nNow, you turn around and\nyou apply it at your organization.\n\n344\n00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,070\nThere's many organizations that require\ntheir project managers to be a PMP\n\n345\n00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,300\ncertified PM, and\nthat's a good thing, in my opinion.\n\n346\n00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,910\nIt is really handy.\n\n347\n00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,102\nIf you step into a project mid-stream,\n\n348\n00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:59,310\nlike mid-project, if they've been\nfollowing the PMI framework, it's\n\n349\n00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,380\nsuper easy to get jump started, get in\nthere, and start working in the project.\n\n350\n00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,260\nIf they've just done fly by, the seat of\ntheir pants, make up their own stuff,\n\n351\n00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,940\nit's really difficult to get up to speed,\nand make sure everything's in place.\n\n352\n00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,475\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat the PMI framework does.\n\n353\n00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:14,420\nMm-hm.\n\n354\n00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,790\nSo.\n\n355\n00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,360\nAll right.\nRonnie,\n\n356\n00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,610\nI think that's a pretty good summary\nof the PMP, and kinda what's involved.\n\n357\n00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,890\nYou think anything I left out?\n\n358\n00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,590\nNope.\nJust remember as much as you can.\n\n359\n00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,530\nYou can actually go and register, just for\na free account right now at the PMI, and\n\n360\n00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,490\nthat way you can get access at\nleast to some of those articles.\n\n361\n00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,780\nThey're not gonna give\nyou access to everything,\n\n362\n00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,950\nbut it's a great resource for\nyou to actually begin in.\n\n363\n00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,810\nAnd so once it asks you to do that, that\nwill again get you familiar with a lot of\n\n364\n00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,710\nthe terms and concepts to begin there,\nand look forward to again.\n\n365\n00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,960\nSeeing what else you actually have\navailable to you and the way that it\n\n366\n00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,860\nactually opens doors in the future for\nyou as well, once you're PMP certified.\n\n367\n00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,390\nAnd I do wanna throw out one more thing,\n\n368\n00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,850\nit was the thing I was\nthinking of a moment ago.\n\n369\n00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,020\nIn a lot of our shows, we go really\nin depth into our content, and\n\n370\n00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,520\nwe talk about everything\nthat's gonna be on the exam.\n\n371\n00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,970\nAnd what we try to do, is we try to make\nit where our show contains everything you\n\n372\n00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,760\nneed to know for the exam.\n\n373\n00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,340\nWell, with the PMP we'll do the same, so\n\n374\n00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,580\nno different from any other show,\nbut it is so much information.\n\n375\n00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,800\nThere is so much, and a lot of it is kind\nof open to interpretation in some cases.\n\n376\n00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,310\nBut this is one of the few cases,\n\n377\n00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,820\nwhere I really do recommend\nthat you purchase a textbook.\n\n378\n00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,280\nA book to use kind of in conjunction\nwith our videos is really handy,\n\n379\n00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,250\nreally helps to make sure that you've\ngot a good understanding of the content.\n\n380\n00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,685\nAnd there's one book in\nparticular that I recommend, and\n\n381\n00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:41,290\nI don't make any money on this or\nanything.\n\n382\n00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,356\nSo, I'm just going straight to Amazon.\n\n383\n00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:47,872\nAnd on amazon.com they\nhave this book here.\n\n384\n00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,974\nIt's written by Joseph Phillips.\n\n385\n00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,067\nThe author.\nIt's the CAPM,\n\n386\n00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,220\nPMP all-in-one certification guide.\n\n387\n00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,050\nRemember what I said at the beginning\nof this little special is,\n\n388\n00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,280\nyou study the same way for both\ncertifications, so it's just one book.\n\n389\n00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,660\nAnd it's a really good book.\n\n390\n00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,906\nIt's big, but he takes all the data and\nhe puts it into a logical order,\n\n391\n00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:11,080\nit's very well written,\nvery easy to understand.\n\n392\n00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,300\nIt has a CD in the back,\n\n393\n00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,250\nit has some practice questions\nas well as a PDF of the book.\n\n394\n00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,650\nSo, it's just an all\naround good book to use.\n\n395\n00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,100\nSo, if you're gonna buy just\none book I recommend this one.\n\n396\n00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,960\nIt's only $30 and hardcover.\n\n397\n00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,700\nI bought the Kindle edition a while back,\nand that's under $30 also.\n\n398\n00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,970\nSo, it's definitely something\nthat you can make use of.\n\n399\n00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,430\nAnd it's a really good one, especially for\ntaking notes and kinda following along,\n\n400\n00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,050\nit's pretty handy.\n\n401\n00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,620\nSo, that's about all I've got for the PMP.\n\n402\n00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,230\nSo, if you have any questions,\njust feel free to reach out to us.\n\n403\n00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,965\nWe've got the Q&A section on the website,\nor\n\n404\n00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:48,663\nyou can always shoot us an email or\nwhatever?\n\n405\n00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:51,297\nBut, hopefully that kind of answers\nany questions you had about\n\n406\n00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:52,482\nthe certification itself.\n\n407\n00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,166\nNow we're ready for the show.\n\n408\n00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,047\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:18.080\nToday we're taking a look at\nthe new 2016 PMP exam update and\n\n4\n00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.610\nhere to help us out, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.430\nHow's it going Don?\n\n6\n00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.440\n>> It is going great, Ronnie.\n\n7\n00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.960\nThanks for having me on the show.\n\n8\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.800\nWe wanted to take some time, this is\nkind of off the beaten path, right?\n\n9\n00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.470\nNormally our episodes focus on the exam\nobjectives, and we wanna go through and\n\n10\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.150\nmake sure everybody understands those so\nyou can be prepared.\n\n11\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.260\nWell, in this one, we're actually gonna\nfocus on the objectives, themselves.\n\n12\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.759\nAs many of you guys have heard,\nthere's a new exam update rolling out from\n\n13\n00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:45.056\nthe PMI that takes effect,\nI think it's January 11th, 2016.\n\n14\n00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:46.844\nIt's definitely January of 2016.\n\n15\n00:00:46.844 --> 00:00:49.570\nAnd it's got a lot of people concerned,\nright?\n\n16\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.344\nAnd it's one of those things where\nif you've been studying, and\n\n17\n00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:53.705\ngetting ready for the exam, and\n\n18\n00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:57.102\nall of a sudden they announce a new change\nis coming down the road, what do we do?\n\n19\n00:00:57.102 --> 00:00:58.740\nHow does that affect us?\n\n20\n00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.750\nAnd for those of you who were watching\nthis episode before January 11th, 2016,\n\n21\n00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.100\nthen you know you've got\nthis impending deadline.\n\n22\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.900\nBut even for people who are watching\nthis after January 11th, 2016,\n\n23\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.250\nit's still important,\nand let me tell you why.\n\n24\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.910\nThe big challenge when\nan exam update happens\n\n25\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.680\nis that there are a lot of\nbooks that are out there.\n\n26\n00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.470\nThere's a lot of videos\nthat are out there.\n\n27\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.656\nThere's a lot of classroom training that's\nout there that's all based on the exam.\n\n28\n00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:29.416\nAnd when the exam changes, there's always\na good period of six months to even a year\n\n29\n00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:32.325\nin some cases,\nwhere you're just not certain.\n\n30\n00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:36.375\nIs the training content I'm getting\nupdated for the new exam, right?\n\n31\n00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:41.007\nWell, fortunately in this case, this type\nof exam update is a little different than\n\n32\n00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:42.519\nwhat most of us are used to.\n\n33\n00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.250\nAnd it means that the majority of\nthe training that you're already using\n\n34\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.462\nis gonna be just fine, all right?\n\n35\n00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:51.212\nAnd let me explain why that is.\n\n36\n00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:57.492\nWhen PMI, the Project Management\nInstitute, when they update their exam,\n\n37\n00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:00.780\nthere's two different times they\nupdate the exam, all right?\n\n38\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.710\nThe main one,\nthe one that we normally watch out for,\n\n39\n00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.700\nis when they update the PMBOK,\nthe Project Management Body of Knowledge.\n\n40\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.350\nThat's that big book that has\nall the various processes and\n\n41\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.490\nprocess groups that we can\nuse to manage a project.\n\n42\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.276\nAll of the tools and techniques and all\nthat good stuff bundled into one big book,\n\n43\n00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:20.870\nand it's what most of\nthe exam is based on.\n\n44\n00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.560\nSo obviously any time the PMBOK updates,\nwe need to go back and\n\n45\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.950\nupdate the exam, right?\n\n46\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.580\nAnd the exam changes to reflect\nwhat's new in the PMBOK.\n\n47\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.080\nNow fortunately,\nthe PMBOK only changes so much, right?\n\n48\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.607\nThey usually only change it\nabout every six years, right, so\n\n49\n00:02:35.607 --> 00:02:38.247\nevery five to six years is usually\nwhen you see an update on that.\n\n50\n00:02:38.247 --> 00:02:40.770\nIt can be as short as three years though.\n\n51\n00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.870\nThat has happened.\n\n52\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.520\nBut it's normally a little bit longer,\nnormally five to six years.\n\n53\n00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.970\nAnd when it does change, it's pretty\nrare that it's a drastic change.\n\n54\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.690\nIt does happen.\n\n55\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.120\nLike I remember when\nthird edition came out.\n\n56\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.630\nFifth edition is current right now,\njust in case you don't know.\n\n57\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.320\nYou probably should know.\n\n58\n00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.370\nBut when third edition came out,\nI remember how challenging it was\n\n59\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.670\nbecause all the earned value\nanalysis stuff, they changed.\n\n60\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.710\nCuz you used to have the BCWP and\n\n61\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.820\nall those other ones that were\nthe four-letter acronyms.\n\n62\n00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.459\nAnd they switched to all the two-letter\nand three-letter acronyms.\n\n63\n00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.520\nAnd so\nyou had to re-learn all these acronyms.\n\n64\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.727\nBut the formulas were the same.\n\n65\n00:03:16.727 --> 00:03:20.070\nThe data you were calculating was\nthe same, it was just different terms.\n\n66\n00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.970\nBut when the fourth edition came out and\nthe fifth edition came out,\n\n67\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.740\nthere were really just minor changes.\n\n68\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.386\nA few new processes came in,\na few old processes went out.\n\n69\n00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:30.760\nAnd that was it, it wasn't that drastic.\n\n70\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.550\nBut your study content had to be updated,\nall right?\n\n71\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.050\nSo that's one example of\nwhen the exam updates, and\n\n72\n00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.240\nthat's not what's happening this time,\nokay?\n\n73\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.100\nThis time, the PMBOK is staying the same.\n\n74\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.950\nPMBOK fifth edition is current.\n\n75\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.230\nThey're working on the sixth edition.\n\n76\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.980\nSixth edition is coming down the line, but\n\n77\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.806\nit'll probably be 2017 before we\nsee the sixth edition of the PMBOK.\n\n78\n00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:55.130\nBut right now we're on the fifth.\n\n79\n00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.200\nThe exam is going to update in January\n2016, and it's still based on the fifth.\n\n80\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.420\nSo, the PMBOK isn't changing.\n\n81\n00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.510\nAnd that means that if you have study\nmaterials like our show here on ITProTV,\n\n82\n00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.620\nwe based our show off of the PMBOK\n\n83\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.970\nnot off of the exam cuz you're\nnot allowed to do that.\n\n84\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.390\n[LAUGH] Cuz you're not allowed\nto share content from the exam.\n\n85\n00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.320\nSo that means that since the PMBOK doesn't\nchange, the content doesn't change, right?\n\n86\n00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.534\nSo, if the PMBOK didn't change,\nwhat did change?\n\n87\n00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:29.134\nWell, every three-to-five years, usually\nit's closer to three years than five\n\n88\n00:04:29.134 --> 00:04:34.040\nyears, but every three-to-five years\nthe PMI does what's called an RDS, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.320\nIt's a Role Delineation Survey.\n\n90\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.207\nIf you're a member of the PMI,\nmost of you are.\n\n91\n00:04:38.207 --> 00:04:42.095\nI know I encourage everybody to join the\nPMI, if for no other reason than the exam\n\n92\n00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:45.560\ndiscount you get,\nwhich effectively pays for the membership.\n\n93\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.523\nBut you get a free copy of the PMBOK.\n\n94\n00:04:47.523 --> 00:04:51.118\nYou get all sorts of great resources,\nso I encourage you to join the PMI.\n\n95\n00:04:51.118 --> 00:04:52.928\nIf you're a member though,\nthen you'll know,\n\n96\n00:04:52.928 --> 00:04:54.527\nevery three to five\nyears you get an email.\n\n97\n00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:56.851\nYou get invited to this survey, and\n\n98\n00:04:56.851 --> 00:05:01.650\nbasically you get to tell the PMI what\nreal life is like for you, right?\n\n99\n00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.310\nAs a project manager, and\nRonnie, you know this.\n\n100\n00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.620\nWe read one thing in the book, but\n\n101\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.450\nthen in real life things\nare a little different, right?\n\n102\n00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.400\nSo, the PMI is always trying\nto keep up to date on that.\n\n103\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.890\nAnd that's what they do with the RDSs,\nthe Role Delineation Survey.\n\n104\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.370\nThey reach out to project managers and\nthey say, what's your role in the company?\n\n105\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.395\nWhat is it that you find\nyourself doing day after day?\n\n106\n00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:26.862\nAnd they structure the exam to match what\nreal life project management professionals\n\n107\n00:05:26.862 --> 00:05:27.490\nare doing.\n\n108\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.440\nRemember, you've got to have five years of\nexperience being an actual project manager\n\n109\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.930\njust to take the exam.\n\n110\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.050\nSo they wanna make sure the exam\nis based on that experience.\n\n111\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.920\nAnd it changes, right?\n\n112\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.911\nThe role of project manager's been\naround for thousands of years, and\n\n113\n00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:43.784\nit's changed a lot in that time.\n\n114\n00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:47.860\nAnd so that's what PMI is doing is\nupdating the exam to reflect that role.\n\n115\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.490\nStill based on PMBOK version five, or\n\n116\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.859\nthe fifth edition of the PMBOK,\nbut our role is different.\n\n117\n00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:58.560\nAnd so what that means is they change\nwhere they put the weight of the exam,\n\n118\n00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.600\nall right?\n\n119\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.320\nNow, lemme show you what I mean on\nthat cuz it gets a little confusing.\n\n120\n00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.570\nSo, I've got pulled up the official\nexam content outline, right?\n\n121\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.025\nSo, this is from PMI, and\non the left I've got the old outline.\n\n122\n00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:12.555\nThis is the one that was posted in 2011,\n\n123\n00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:15.125\nand as of this taping,\nthis is what's current.\n\n124\n00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.055\nSo this is what you would see on\nthe exam if you took it today.\n\n125\n00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:20.685\nBut if you're watching this video\non January 11, 2016 or later, or\n\n126\n00:06:20.685 --> 00:06:25.855\nyou're just getting ready for it,\nthis is the new outline, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:29.364\nAnd notice how we still have the same\nfive processes or phases, right?\n\n128\n00:06:29.364 --> 00:06:33.284\nWe've got initiating, planning,\nexecuting, monitoring, controlling, and\n\n129\n00:06:33.284 --> 00:06:34.710\nclosing, right?\n\n130\n00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.080\nAnd if we look at the percentages,\nthey've changed a little.\n\n131\n00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.079\nSee how they took closing, and\nthey reduced it down to 7%?\n\n132\n00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:45.379\nAnd then they took our executing and\nbumped it up to 31%.\n\n133\n00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:47.026\nThey've changed the weights.\n\n134\n00:06:47.026 --> 00:06:51.197\nAnd the reason they did is they\nfound that as a project manager,\n\n135\n00:06:51.197 --> 00:06:56.530\nyou spend more of your time managing\nexecution than you do closing, right?\n\n136\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.910\nSo they've started to reduce\nthe importance of that.\n\n137\n00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.180\nAnd that's the real impact that we have.\n\n138\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.590\nThe content you study isn't different.\n\n139\n00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.690\nThe amount of questions that you\nget is going to be different.\n\n140\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.920\nWe're going to get more questions on\nexecuting and less questions on closing.\n\n141\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.200\nThat's the biggest difference.\n\n142\n00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.247\nNow there's a few other differences.\n\n143\n00:07:15.247 --> 00:07:19.433\nSo for example, they have actually added\nsome stuff to the exam objectives.\n\n144\n00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:21.780\nI'll show you guys that\nhere in just a moment.\n\n145\n00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.230\nThey've taken away some things\nfrom the exam objectives,\n\n146\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.170\nthings that people really weren't using.\n\n147\n00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.020\nThey were either redundant or\ninconsequential so they pulled them out.\n\n148\n00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.260\nThey put in new things that project\nmanagers were finding themselves doing,\n\n149\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.790\nand they added to it.\n\n150\n00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.850\nSo there's that, all right.\n\n151\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.280\nAnd they're also updating\nthe question pool.\n\n152\n00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.337\nNow when you take the PMP exam,\nyou get 200 questions.\n\n153\n00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:45.310\nYou get a lot of questions.\n\n154\n00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.030\nBut it's actually being drawn from\na pool of somewhere between 400 and\n\n155\n00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.700\n600 questions.\n\n156\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.374\nSo in theory, I can take the exam and\nRonnie can take the exam on the same day,\n\n157\n00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:59.558\nand we could have 200 completely\ndifferent questions, right?\n\n158\n00:07:59.558 --> 00:08:02.006\nBut statistically that's not likely.\n\n159\n00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:05.246\nThe odds are we're gonna have\nquite a few questions in common.\n\n160\n00:08:05.246 --> 00:08:08.504\nAnd if I don't pass the exam,\nI could always go and\n\n161\n00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:11.150\ntake it again a few days later.\n\n162\n00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.640\nAnd when I take it again, I'm gonna\nsee some of the same questions again.\n\n163\n00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.020\nStatistically, that's going to happen.\n\n164\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.980\nYou're going to see some of\nthe same questions again.\n\n165\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.000\nWell, when the January\n11 update rolls out,\n\n166\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.830\nabout 25% of the questions will be\nadjusted to reflect the new objectives.\n\n167\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.480\nAnother 25% of the questions will be all\nnew ones based on the existing objectives,\n\n168\n00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.650\nand then the remaining 50% will\nactually stay the same from before.\n\n169\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.240\nThat means 50% of the question\npool will be brand new.\n\n170\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.660\nSo, if you take the exam on January 10th,\n\n171\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.860\nand then take it again on January 17th,\nright?\n\n172\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.180\nThere's 50% of the questions\nthat are all new.\n\n173\n00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.480\nAnd so you're statistically far less\nlikely to see duplicate questions, right?\n\n174\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.630\nSo, it's a new question pool.\n\n175\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.000\nNow, how does that impact most of you?\n\n176\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.760\nIt doesn't.\n\n177\n00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.440\nAll right, who does it impact?\n\n178\n00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.380\nIt impacts cheaters.\n\n179\n00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.460\nThere are cheaters out there,\n\n180\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.090\nthere's people that find\nways to get exam questions.\n\n181\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.870\nWell, they're all new exam questions, or\n\n182\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.880\nat least half the pool is gonna be\ndifferent, starting January 11th.\n\n183\n00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.580\nAnd so it helps to kind of curb cheating\nas well as get the questions phrased\n\n184\n00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.660\nin a way that's a little more up to date.\n\n185\n00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.060\nYou guys know how it is, right?\n\n186\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.010\nChanging terminology, changing acronyms,\nthings start to get a little dated.\n\n187\n00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.500\nAnd when you've got exam questions\nthat are referencing MySpace [LAUGH],\n\n188\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.730\nthat might have made sense five\nyears ago but today people are like,\n\n189\n00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.140\nwell what is MySpace?\n\n190\n00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.190\nI think Justin Timberlake told\nme about that or something.\n\n191\n00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.250\nBut now you might want to change it to\nreference Facebook or something else,\n\n192\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.870\nso that's the kind of\nstuff that you'll see.\n\n193\n00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.700\nSo, that's the big deal there.\n\n194\n00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.150\nSo, if you've been studying and\npreparing, don't panic.\n\n195\n00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.070\nThe materials you're already using\nare more than likely just fine\n\n196\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.265\nassuming they were good materials\nin the first place, right?\n\n197\n00:09:48.265 --> 00:09:50.990\n[LAUGH] If they were bad materials before,\nthey'll be bad now too.\n\n198\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.990\nBut if they were good materials before,\nthey're still gonna be good.\n\n199\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.840\nThey're going to cover what you need.\n\n200\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.360\nUnless they were really strictly\nbased on the exam objectives.\n\n201\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.080\nNow, most people never actually look at\nthe true exam objectives, which is kind of\n\n202\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.280\nfunny, but let me show you what I mean\nwhen I say the actual exam objectives.\n\n203\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.920\nIf I take a look at the new outline here,\nright so\n\n204\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.280\nthis is the new outline and\nif you drill down into it,\n\n205\n00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.900\nbasically what they do is when they\npresent the exam objectives to you.\n\n206\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.720\nThey don't present it in\nterms of process groups,\n\n207\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.180\nthey don't present it in terms of here's\na particular process you need to know,\n\n208\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.100\nthey present it to you in terms of tasks.\n\n209\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.000\nThese are tasks that a normal\nproject manager is expected to do.\n\n210\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.650\nSo, as a project manager, when you're\nin the initiating phase, right,\n\n211\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.720\nwhere 13% of our questions come from,\nyou're expected To perform\n\n212\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.850\nproject assessment based on available\ninformation, lessons learned, and so on.\n\n213\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.500\nRight.\n\n214\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.660\nWe're expected to know how to manage\na project is effectively what this\n\n215\n00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.210\ntask is saying.\n\n216\n00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.320\nAll right.\n\n217\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.930\nAnd that hasn't changed, right.\n\n218\n00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.510\nThese are the new objectives.\n\n219\n00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.980\nOops, let me switch back\nover to the old objectives.\n\n220\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.540\nAnd if we look at the old objectives,\nyou'll actually see they've basically got\n\n221\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.170\nthat same statement,\nI believe it's word for word.\n\n222\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.940\nI don't think that one's changed at all.\n\n223\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.240\nActually, it looks like\nsome word is different.\n\n224\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.640\nThey subtly change little\nwords every now and then.\n\n225\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.420\nThat doesn't really matter, but\nperform project assessment,\n\n226\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.250\nthat's really not any different\nthan what we had before.\n\n227\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.700\nSo, what is different Well\nthey've added some new things and\n\n228\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.090\nhere on initiation they've\nactually added three new tasks.\n\n229\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.700\nOkay.\n\n230\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.770\nNow if I look at the old objectives I can\nsee they're were six tasks on initiation.\n\n231\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.840\nNow there's eight.\n\n232\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.200\nI said they added three.\n\n233\n00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.920\nWhat does that mean.\n\n234\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.150\nWell, PMI is being really good about\ntelling everybody what they added.\n\n235\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.730\nThey're not really telling\npeople what they took away.\n\n236\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.780\nSo, I want to make sure I show\nyou guys that so you're aware.\n\n237\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.380\nThey added Identifying key deliverables\nbased on business requirements.\n\n238\n00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.960\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwait a minute,\n\n239\n00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.910\nDon, we identified key\ndeliverables before.\n\n240\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.750\nWhy is this now a task right here?\n\n241\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:02.160\nOkay, well, What's going on is that PMI\nis recognizing a shift that's happening.\n\n242\n00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.320\nIn the past, project managers didn't\nreally get involved in initiating.\n\n243\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.440\nWhat would happen is a project would\ninitiation because some executive,\n\n244\n00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.690\nsome department head or\nvice president or CEO or\n\n245\n00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.500\nwhatever would decide that\na project was worth undertaking.\n\n246\n00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.180\nOr a PMO for that matter, would decide\nthat a project was worth undertaking.\n\n247\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.790\nAnd after they had the charter signed and\neverything was done, they'd move into\n\n248\n00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.350\nthe planning phase, and that's when\nthey'd attach a project manager.\n\n249\n00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.180\nSo, it was very possible as a PM that you\nweren't involved in initiating at all.\n\n250\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.850\nWell, after the RDS that was undertaken\nearlier this year, the PMI found that\n\n251\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.010\nproject managers are increasingly\ngetting involved in initiating.\n\n252\n00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.660\nSo, they needed to strengthen\nthat up a little more and\n\n253\n00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.190\nincrease the product\nmanager's influence there.\n\n254\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.280\nNow, the product manager does have some\nlimited influence, but one of the things\n\n255\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.940\nthat's really important is, we don't just\nneed to identify the key deliverables.\n\n256\n00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.930\nThat was something we were doing before,\nright?\n\n257\n00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.470\nAs we built out scope.\n\n258\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.750\nBut we need to do it based on\nthe business requirements, all right.\n\n259\n00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.650\nThat's the key phrase that\nwe need to remember there.\n\n260\n00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:11.100\nIs that when we undertake a project, as a\nproject manager it's our responsibility to\n\n261\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.560\nmake sure that this project is\nactually helping The company.\n\n262\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.100\nAnd so\nyou're gonna see an increased stress on\n\n263\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.130\na cost to benefit analysis, right?\n\n264\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.620\nAre we actually making the company\nbetter by undertaking this project, or\n\n265\n00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.750\nare we hurting the company?\n\n266\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.510\nAnd in the past,\nbecause initiating was already done,\n\n267\n00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.470\nand it was already handed off to us,\n\n268\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.674\nwe just got involved in the planning,\nthose decisions were already made.\n\n269\n00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:40.180\nBut I keep saying PMI found that\nthat's just not the case, right?\n\n270\n00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.730\nThat project managers do get involved in\nthat and so that's now part of the exam.\n\n271\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.690\nSo, that's what they're kind\nof stressing there, all right?\n\n272\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.460\nAfter that,\nwe see other things that we've been doing.\n\n273\n00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.590\nPerform stakeholder analysis, right?\n\n274\n00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.350\nWe've got a whole process for that.\n\n275\n00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.000\nIdentify high-level risks\n\n276\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.710\nNow it's not talking about\ndoing full risk analysis here.\n\n277\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.880\nIt's saying high level, right?\n\n278\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.160\nWhat is kind of the common sense?\n\n279\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.100\nWhat do we know is gonna\nbe a risk that's out there?\n\n280\n00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.940\nParticipate in the development\nof the project charter.\n\n281\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.970\nNow, that one was actually present\nin the old objectives too.\n\n282\n00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.190\nYou'll see it right here,\ndevelop the project charter.\n\n283\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.800\nAnd what PMI found was\nthat's not realistic,\n\n284\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.010\nthat very few project managers\nare actually drafting their own charter.\n\n285\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.100\nThat if you're being assign\nin the planning phase,\n\n286\n00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.790\nyou don't necessarily draft it but\nyou participate in the development of it.\n\n287\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.470\nThat whoever the sponsor is,\nthey're normally the ones who\n\n288\n00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:35.070\nare drafting that charter and we just\nassist with that if we're involve at all.\n\n289\n00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.390\nSo, they just changed the wording\na little bit there, all right.\n\n290\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.030\nObtain project charter approval,\nthat one's been there\n\n291\n00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.790\nalways cuz you've gotta have approval, you\ngotta get your authority from somewhere.\n\n292\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.400\nAnd then here's the two new ones.\n\n293\n00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.170\nConduct a benefit analysis with\nthe relevant stakeholders.\n\n294\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.050\nAgain, is this project going\nto benefit the company or\n\n295\n00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.350\nshould we kill it off right now and\nnot move forward?\n\n296\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.520\nWell, if you've already watched our shows,\n\n297\n00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.480\nyou know we covered that\nwhole benefit analysis.\n\n298\n00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.256\nWe're looking at that to\nsee if it's necessary.\n\n299\n00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:02.810\nIt's always been there.\n\n300\n00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.340\nIt's always been in the pin box.\n\n301\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.400\nBut it wasn't called out in\nthe exam objectives because it\n\n302\n00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.420\nwasn't stressed as something\na project manager needed to do.\n\n303\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.670\nIt's kind of like the whole accounting\nside, when you go into the budgeting of\n\n304\n00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.000\nthe PMBOK, it's all there,\nhow to manage a budget.\n\n305\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.460\nBut it's not stressed on the exam because\nproject managers don't normally do that.\n\n306\n00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.950\nYou normally have accountants\nthat do that for you.\n\n307\n00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.080\nWell, that's how this\nwas treated in the past.\n\n308\n00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.680\nNot anymore.\n\n309\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.060\nNow, it's actually being brought in,\nright?\n\n310\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.320\nAnd inform the stakeholder of\nthe approved project charter\n\n311\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.010\nOnce the charter is drafted, we need\nto make sure everybody understands it.\n\n312\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.480\nUnderstands what their key deliverables\nare, their milestones, and their roles and\n\n313\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.530\nresponsibilities.\n\n314\n00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.455\nGetting all of this understood before\nwe get underway with the project.\n\n315\n00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:52.298\nWe don't want to waste time with planning\nif we have a misunderstanding at the very\n\n316\n00:15:52.298 --> 00:15:53.075\nbeginning.\n\n317\n00:15:53.075 --> 00:15:57.323\nSo these three tasks, tasks two,\nseven, and eight, those are new.\n\n318\n00:15:57.323 --> 00:16:00.838\nNow seven and\neight are completely new, but\n\n319\n00:16:00.838 --> 00:16:05.880\ntask two It is kind of replacing\nwhat we had back here.\n\n320\n00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.580\nWhen we take a look at what we had,\nwe had tasks one through six and\n\n321\n00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:13.960\nyou'll see like define high level scope of\nthe project based on business compliance.\n\n322\n00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.590\nSo that high level scope and\nif we look here, that one's gone.\n\n323\n00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.460\nReplaced with identify key deliverables\nbased on blah, blah, blah.\n\n324\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.540\nWe're not building the scope anymore.\n\n325\n00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:31.030\nThat's kind of what the sponsor is doing\nwhen they create that project charter.\n\n326\n00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.980\nWe're influencing that.\n\n327\n00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.740\nSo this one has been replaced\n\n328\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.280\nby our new one where we participate\nin the development of the scope.\n\n329\n00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.050\nSo be aware of that, be aware of these\nsubtle changes that have happened.\n\n330\n00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.360\nIt's not a significant change.\n\n331\n00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.910\nIn most cases,\n\n332\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.110\nit's not even something we have to worry\nabout like I have this example here.\n\n333\n00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:53.250\nPerform key stake holder analysis\nusing various techniques.\n\n334\n00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.680\nWell now it reads,\nperform stake holder analysis.\n\n335\n00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.500\nPlease drop the word key.\n\n336\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.130\nSo instead of looking for\nyour key stake holders,\n\n337\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.900\nnow you're looking at\nall the stake holders.\n\n338\n00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.790\nIs that a big deal?\n\n339\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.930\nDo we need to study extra for that?\n\n340\n00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:05.964\nNo, not really.\n\n341\n00:17:05.964 --> 00:17:07.600\nAnd that's how most of these changes are.\n\n342\n00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.720\nThat's why we don't need to\npanic over the exam update.\n\n343\n00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.070\nIt is pretty straightforward.\n\n344\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.890\nNow initiation is one example where\nwe just added three new processes.\n\n345\n00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.080\nSome of the others are a little\nmore significant though.\n\n346\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.361\nIf we take a look at planning for example.\n\n347\n00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:26.094\nHere we've got a new task that's been\nbrought in which is develop a scope\n\n348\n00:17:26.094 --> 00:17:27.080\nmanagement plan.\n\n349\n00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.820\nNow, if you read the PMBOK,\nthere is a process for\n\n350\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.950\ncreating your scope management plan and\nyour whole project management plan too.\n\n351\n00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.240\nThat's not new.\nThat's been there a long time.\n\n352\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.620\nIt's just now being called\nout in the exam objectives.\n\n353\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.010\nYou need to be aware of that.\n\n354\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.513\nAnd if you've read most books that\nare based on the PMBOK fifth edition or\n\n355\n00:17:45.513 --> 00:17:49.074\nif you've watched our shows at ITProTV,\nwe've already covered that and\n\n356\n00:17:49.074 --> 00:17:51.906\nthat's why we don't need to\npanic about the exam change.\n\n357\n00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:54.400\nSome of the other things\nthat have changed.\n\n358\n00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.460\nYou'll see this guy, right here.\n\n359\n00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.000\nDevelop the stakeholder management\nplan by analyzing needs and so on.\n\n360\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.540\nSince we're not just focused on key\nstakeholders anymore, we need to be\n\n361\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.528\nfocused on all of the stakeholders and\nhow we communicate with them.\n\n362\n00:18:06.528 --> 00:18:11.070\nAnd that's something we talk about in\nour communications plan episode because\n\n363\n00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.890\nyou've gotta figure out how\nto talk to the stakeholders.\n\n364\n00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:14.750\nYour key stakeholders,\n\n365\n00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.630\nyou might have in person meetings\nwith every day or every week.\n\n366\n00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.592\nBut your secondary stakeholders\npeople who aren't key,\n\n367\n00:18:21.592 --> 00:18:23.474\nthem you might just send an email to.\n\n368\n00:18:23.474 --> 00:18:24.360\nEmail and ask them.\n\n369\n00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.920\nThese might be your customer base and\nmight be millions of people.\n\n370\n00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.140\nYou just send an email and\nask them or you post to a blog.\n\n371\n00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.540\nThat's how you communicate with them.\n\n372\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.430\nSo we've gotta make sure that\nwe've got management plan for\n\n373\n00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.950\nhow we make somebody key or move them out\nfrom being key, how we can communicate,\n\n374\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.080\nall of that gets tied into them?\n\n375\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.820\nYou'll also see they added a few\nthings that are knowledge and skills.\n\n376\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.770\nThey've added human resource planning,\nLean inefficiency principles,\n\n377\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.500\nregulatory and environmental impacts and\nassessment planning.\n\n378\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.610\nThese are a couple of extra topics\nthey've added and this is one of the few\n\n379\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.440\nthings that has kinda changed,\nbecause we have a human resource planning.\n\n380\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.533\nWe had that that's been in\nthe PMBOK that's not new.\n\n381\n00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:07.017\nSo we've had that inside of our\nplanning and our executing and\n\n382\n00:19:07.017 --> 00:19:09.670\na little bit in monitor controlling too.\n\n383\n00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.240\nBut that one's been around.\n\n384\n00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.740\nBut Lean and efficiency principles.\n\n385\n00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.440\nWe didn't really talk\nabout those in the past.\n\n386\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.960\nAnd if you break open the PMBOK and\nyou start reading through it,\n\n387\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.910\nthey don't really talk about it there,\neither.\n\n388\n00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.230\nSo they've actually added a knowledge and\nskill they expect you to have.\n\n389\n00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.164\nAnd this is where we've had to\ndo a little bit of an update.\n\n390\n00:19:27.164 --> 00:19:29.990\nAnd I know different vendors\nare handling it different ways.\n\n391\n00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.372\nSo if you're dealing with\na book that you're reading,\n\n392\n00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:34.449\nthey may be putting out\na new edition of the book or\n\n393\n00:19:34.449 --> 00:19:37.554\nthey may just do an errata on the website,\ncuz it is kind of a small thing.\n\n394\n00:19:37.554 --> 00:19:41.410\nFor us at ITProTV, we just recorded\nan extra episode to cover that.\n\n395\n00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.496\nSo we talked about process analysis and\nhow you can do Lean,\n\n396\n00:19:45.496 --> 00:19:47.223\nSix Sigma and what else?\n\n397\n00:19:47.223 --> 00:19:47.960\n>> Kanban.\n\n398\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.524\n>> Kanban.\n\n399\n00:19:48.524 --> 00:19:52.740\nSo you got a chance to see those and\njust kinda update your skills there.\n\n400\n00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.220\nThe odds are it would be a maximum\nof one question on the exam,\n\n401\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.100\nso it's not terribly significant.\n\n402\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.520\nBut you wanna make sure that\nyour prepared for that.\n\n403\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.600\nSo we have to kinda keep an eye out for\nthose little things.\n\n404\n00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.510\nAnd under regulatory environmental impacts\nwe're talking about things like standards\n\n405\n00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.700\nand guidelines that we have to follow as\nwell as government rules and regulations.\n\n406\n00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.731\nSo that's another one to be aware of.\n\n407\n00:20:13.731 --> 00:20:16.460\nOther things that have\nchanged under executing.\n\n408\n00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.690\nThey've added a few new tasks here.\n\n409\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.830\nManage the flow of information by\nusing your communications plan.\n\n410\n00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.320\nAgain, apart of the PMBOK already just\nbeing stressed here which means you're\n\n411\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.290\ngonna start having exam questions on it.\n\n412\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.381\nIn the past you wouldn't have a lot\nof exam questions over base time,\n\n413\n00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:32.193\nmaybe one or two.\n\n414\n00:20:32.193 --> 00:20:36.390\nNow, executing counts for 31% of the exam.\n\n415\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.574\nAnd this is one of what is it, 13?\n\n416\n00:20:38.574 --> 00:20:43.130\nI'm sorry, one of seven different tasks.\n\n417\n00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.176\nHow many questions is\nthat gonna equate to?\n\n418\n00:20:46.176 --> 00:20:50.910\n30% of a 200 question exam,\nyou're talking about 60 questions.\n\n419\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.790\nThat means if there's\nseven tasks you could\n\n420\n00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:58.240\nhave nine questions just based on\nmanaging the flow of information.\n\n421\n00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.220\nSo it's a stressed topic.\n\n422\n00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.630\nOne that you basically need to make sure\nthat you're aware of and that you know.\n\n423\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.310\nAnd maintaining your stakeholder\nrelationships by following that\n\n424\n00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.010\nstakeholder management plan.\n\n425\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.840\nAgain, we've already talked\nabout the processes.\n\n426\n00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.040\nYou guys are already familiar with the\nprocesses that are associated with that.\n\n427\n00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.400\nIt's just there's gonna\nbe more questions on it.\n\n428\n00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.490\nNow one that saw a good bit of\nchange is monitoring controlling.\n\n429\n00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.657\nSo monitoring controlling had\nsix tasks before, I believe.\n\n430\n00:21:24.657 --> 00:21:26.510\nLet's jump back to the old one here.\n\n431\n00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.787\nSo if I jump over to monitoring and\ncontrolling.\n\n432\n00:21:29.787 --> 00:21:31.240\nHere we go.\n\n433\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.670\nSo it had six before.\n\n434\n00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.380\nThey took the last one here,\n\n435\n00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.910\ncommunicate project status to the\nstakeholders and just dropped that one.\n\n436\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.060\nSo that one's gone, and it's been\nreplaced with capture, analyze and\n\n437\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.970\nmanage your lessons learned.\n\n438\n00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.631\nThis is something new that\nthe PMI is starting to stress.\n\n439\n00:21:48.631 --> 00:21:51.518\nWhat we used to do was in\nthe closing of each phase and\n\n440\n00:21:51.518 --> 00:21:56.330\nat the closing of the project as a whole\nwe'd gather our lessons learned.\n\n441\n00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.860\nAnd our lessons learned would then\nbenefit the next project that happened.\n\n442\n00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.485\nBut the lessons that we were learning\nright then weren't necessarily\n\n443\n00:22:05.485 --> 00:22:06.500\nbenefiting us.\n\n444\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.240\nAnd if there was a second project\nthat was going on at the same time,\n\n445\n00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.570\nthe lessons learned they\ngenerated weren't benefiting us.\n\n446\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.780\nNow what the PMI is stressing is\nyou should always be capturing and\n\n447\n00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.470\nmanaging your lessons learned.\n\n448\n00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.340\nAnd you should be sharing that\nwith other projects immediately.\n\n449\n00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.490\nDon't wait until your project is done\nto share it, share it immediately.\n\n450\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.390\nAnd so that's why they're saying capture,\n\n451\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.040\nyou should be gathering your\nown lessons learned as you go.\n\n452\n00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.840\nAnalyze, you should be breaking them down,\nbuilding reports,\n\n453\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.080\nfinding out why things happen\na certain way and then managing them.\n\n454\n00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.270\nSharing them with the other projects,\ngathering the lessons learned from them so\n\n455\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.720\nthat you can learn from\ntheir lessons faster.\n\n456\n00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.180\nAnd you don't potentially have two\nprojects making the same mistake at\n\n457\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.980\nthe same time, that they could've\nshared information and avoided that.\n\n458\n00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.360\nSo that's a new stress that\nthey're making here and\n\n459\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.210\nit's one that people are already\ndoing out there in the field.\n\n460\n00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:59.760\nPMI is just adjusting their topics\nto make sure that they reflect that.\n\n461\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.010\nMonitoring procurement activities and\nfollowing a procurement plan.\n\n462\n00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.720\nRemember procurements those\nare contracts that we enter into and\n\n463\n00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.190\npurchases that we make.\n\n464\n00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.530\nHow do we make sure that we're following\nthe guidelines of those contracts?\n\n465\n00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.100\nNow that was something new that was\nadded in the PMBOK fifth edition, so\n\n466\n00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.000\nas long as you're studying fifth\nedition materials, you're fine.\n\n467\n00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.860\nThat hasn't changed here.\n\n468\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.581\nSo they added it,\nthey just didn't stress it on the exam.\n\n469\n00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:27.829\nNow, they're stressing it on the exam,\nso we need to make sure we know that.\n\n470\n00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.850\nAnd here's where you start to\nsee where they added things.\n\n471\n00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:35.210\nThey're actually specifically calling\nout under knowledge and skills.\n\n472\n00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.280\nLEAN, Kanban, Six Sigma.\n\n473\n00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.720\nThey're calling out organizations\nlike the ISO, the BS, CMMI, IEEE.\n\n474\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.183\nThey're calling out these guys because\nthese are the ones that people are using\n\n475\n00:23:45.183 --> 00:23:45.880\nin real life.\n\n476\n00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.920\nYou need to be familiar with them.\n\n477\n00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.887\nAnd again,\nwe recorded the little extra content for\n\n478\n00:23:48.887 --> 00:23:50.237\nour show to make up the difference.\n\n479\n00:23:50.237 --> 00:23:53.569\nFor any of these that we didn't\nspecifically call it before, we now have.\n\n480\n00:23:53.569 --> 00:23:57.597\nSo that's wrapped up in our show.\n\n481\n00:23:57.597 --> 00:24:00.197\nAnd then after that closing,\nclosing didn't change.\n\n482\n00:24:00.197 --> 00:24:04.650\nRemember that closing date reduced\nit from 8% to 7% in the exam?\n\n483\n00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.170\nAnd it stayed the same, no changes there.\n\n484\n00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.630\nAll right, so as a whole,\n\n485\n00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.460\nthe changes that we're looking at\nare really not all that significant.\n\n486\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:18.280\nSo when this change rolls\nout January 11th, 2016,\n\n487\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.980\nfor most of us, if you're studying,\nif you're watching the shows,\n\n488\n00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.790\nif you're reading a book,\nyou really don't need to change anything.\n\n489\n00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.400\nIt's just the way the questions\nare weighted, the way the questions\n\n490\n00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.370\nare balanced on the exam may be a little\nbit different, and you're good to go.\n\n491\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.090\nIt's not one of those big\nones that you panic on.\n\n492\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.600\nNow, if Pinbox sixth edition was coming\nout, it'll be a different story, right?\n\n493\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.608\nNow, we might have all new processes,\nall new tools and techniques to learn.\n\n494\n00:24:38.608 --> 00:24:41.410\nThere might be other ones that have\ngone away, we don't need to worry about.\n\n495\n00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.460\nThere might be some new earned value\nformulas that we need to worry about.\n\n496\n00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.890\nBut that's not what's happening here,\nright.\n\n497\n00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:51.530\nSo when you have a RDS,\na Role Delineation Survey, it results\n\n498\n00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.520\nin minor tweaks to the exam, like this,\nthat are just not really a panic point.\n\n499\n00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.390\n>> So Don, if I'm in the middle\nof studying for this exam, and\n\n500\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.540\nit's right around the corner,\nthree or four months away.\n\n501\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.500\nI don't really have to worry about\nchanging anything in the path that\n\n502\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.040\nI'm studying.\n\n503\n00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.790\nI should be fine as we continue to go up.\n\n504\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.290\nIt doesn't look like it\nactually just changed,\n\n505\n00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.400\nbut two different percentages,\nI think would be fine, right?\n\n506\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.180\n>> Yeah, and it does come down\nto the materials you're using.\n\n507\n00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:19.190\nSo if you're using ITProTV's materials,\nwe based ours on the PIN-block itself,\n\n508\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.420\nand the PIN-block hasn't changed,\nso we covered all of it.\n\n509\n00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.430\nIt's fine.\n\n510\n00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.340\nWe did have to add one more show.\n\n511\n00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:31.040\nIf you're just catching up on this,\nlook for a show, it's part of the control.\n\n512\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.193\nNo, part of executing, right?\n\n513\n00:25:32.193 --> 00:25:34.792\nThe episode's called, Process Analysis.\n\n514\n00:25:34.792 --> 00:25:35.512\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n515\n00:25:35.512 --> 00:25:39.209\nif you go and look for the episode\ncalled Process Analysis, that's where we\n\n516\n00:25:39.209 --> 00:25:43.039\nadded a little bit on Six Sigma, a little\nbit on Lean, a little bit on Cam Band.\n\n517\n00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.594\nISO, I think it's a two parter, right?\n\n518\n00:25:44.594 --> 00:25:46.890\nSo ISO, CMMI, those guys.\n\n519\n00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.910\nIf you've never heard those acronyms,\nwe covered in that episode.\n\n520\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.440\nRight, or those two episodes.\n\n521\n00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.420\nBut all the rest of\nthe material is the same.\n\n522\n00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.650\nYou don't have to panic.\n\n523\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.760\nNow, if you're reading a book, and the\nbook is not based on the PIN-block, but\n\n524\n00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.850\nis instead based directly on the exam\nobjectives, those have changed.\n\n525\n00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.040\nAnd there might be gaps.\n\n526\n00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.650\nAny of those things that were highlighted\nin green when I was showing you the exam\n\n527\n00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.370\nobjectives, those are things\nthose books might be missing.\n\n528\n00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.940\nAnd so\nthat's where you have to worry about it.\n\n529\n00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.480\nSo, it really boils down to what\nyour information was based on.\n\n530\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.460\nAnd if it was based on the PIN-block,\ndon't panic.\n\n531\n00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.460\nKeep studying the way you're studying.\n\n532\n00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.045\nYou'll be fine.\nYou'll do great on the exam.\n\n533\n00:26:18.045 --> 00:26:23.340\n>> Another thing I think we can reassure\nour viewers of is that here at ITProTV,\n\n534\n00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.520\nif it does change significantly more,\nwe'll do what?\n\n535\n00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.040\nWe'll just record more episodes.\n\n536\n00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.064\n>> Yeah.\nAnd we've kind of been planning on that as\n\n537\n00:26:30.064 --> 00:26:33.425\nthe Pinbox sixth edition\nstarts to materialize.\n\n538\n00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:35.070\nPMI's really open about it.\n\n539\n00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.010\nAnd you can kind of keep up with\nthe changes they're recommending and all.\n\n540\n00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.130\nAnd we'll probably end up just re-shooting\nthe whole series though to update it\n\n541\n00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:41.870\nwhen that happens.\n\n542\n00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:47.090\nBut like I said, that'll probably be 2017,\nor at a minimum, the end of 2016.\n\n543\n00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:51.160\nSo it's still a little early for that to\nhappen, but we'll see it down the road.\n\n544\n00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.720\n>> All right, so that's a great place for\n\n545\n00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.940\nus to actually think about that,\nhey, if I'm ready for\n\n546\n00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:59.420\nthe current edition of it, that 2016\nobjective, I don't need to panic.\n\n547\n00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.730\nI just can continue on my path as long as\nI've got good study materials ahead of me,\n\n548\n00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.810\nI'm really set for\nwhat we have ahead of us as well.\n\n549\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.440\nSo, signing off for\nITProTV, I’m Ronnie Wong.\n\n550\n00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.048\n>> And I’m Don Pezet.\n\n551\n00:27:11.048 --> 00:27:12.059\n>> And we’ll see you next time.\n\n552\n00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:19.280\n[SOUND]\n\n",

right, good morning,\nafternoon, and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:39,610\nwelcome back to another episode of\nITPro TV and I'm your host Don Pizzette.\n\n6\n00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,650\nToday with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,640\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,040\n>> It is going well.\n\n9\n00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,940\nI do not have any\nreference to Eminem at all.\n\n10\n00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,210\n>> No?\n>> No, not a single one.\n\n11\n00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,210\n>> The candy or the rapper?\n\n12\n00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,440\n>> Both.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,490\nWell, let me start off by welcoming\n\n14\n00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,170\neverybody [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,427\nWe're gonna have Eminem rap-off later,\n\n16\n00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:03,170\n[LAUGH] see who can\ninsult each other more.\n\n17\n00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,810\nLet me welcome everybody to the first\n\n18\n00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,160\nepisode of the ITPro TV Project\nManagement Professional show,\n\n19\n00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,150\nthis is a kind of a new branch for us.\n\n20\n00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,330\nEvery show we've done up to this\npoint has been hardcore IT, right?\n\n21\n00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,860\nWe've been setting up servers, formatting\nwork stations, changing hardware,\n\n22\n00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,330\nall IT stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,970\nAnd today we do project management.\n\n24\n00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,200\nThis is the first of our it's kind of like\na soft skill I think is what they call it.\n\n25\n00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,120\nAnd you might ask yourself,\nwhy are we doing this?\n\n26\n00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,790\nWell in the IT world more so\n\n27\n00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,206\nthen in almost any other industry,\nconstruction may be better.\n\n28\n00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:43,100\nBut in the IT world there are many,\n\n29\n00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,200\nmany things that we undertake that fall\nunder this envelope of being a project.\n\n30\n00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,830\nAnd, if they are not properly structured\nand managed, they are destined for\n\n31\n00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:00,030\nfailure over budget, behind schedule,\njust terrible, terrible situations.\n\n32\n00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,710\nThat's one of the things that\nhappens when a project goes stray.\n\n33\n00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,750\nAnd so project management has become\na hot button issue in the IT world over\n\n34\n00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,330\nthe last few years.\n\n35\n00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,800\nAnd you really see it, around here you and\nI both as instructors over the years have\n\n36\n00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,560\nseen the request for\nMicrosoft project training and\n\n37\n00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,780\njust general project fundamental\nstuff like that really increasing.\n\n38\n00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,930\nPeople want to know how to properly handle\ntheir projects to ensure the highest\n\n39\n00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,360\ndegree of success.\n\n40\n00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,200\n>> And more and more we're starting\nto see this in the field of security.\n\n41\n00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,140\nWhere security is no longer\nabout just setting up stuff, but\n\n42\n00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,530\nreally properly maintaining and\nthen of course migrating\n\n43\n00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,250\nas the security field is changing,\nas we're getting more and more threats.\n\n44\n00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,330\nThe constant need to update and\nto keep things going and\n\n45\n00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,170\nkeep things safe, is part of more project\nmanagement than it is the idea of actually\n\n46\n00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,470\nhaving to worry about the individual\nproducts and security any more.\n\n47\n00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,750\nSo you're gonna see this more often in\neverything that you're doing in IT.\n\n48\n00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,520\nEspecially during\nmigrations a lot of times.\n\n49\n00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,590\n>> So if you find yourself in\na situation where you've got a project.\n\n50\n00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,310\nWe'll talk a little bit more here in\na minute about what exactly a project is.\n\n51\n00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,140\nBut if you find yourself in a situation\nwhere you need to manage a project,\n\n52\n00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,180\nif this is the very first time,\n\n53\n00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,400\nyou might be scratching your head saying,\nwell how do I go about that?\n\n54\n00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,310\nHow do I do this, how do I do that?\n\n55\n00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,110\nYou don't wanna start from scratch.\n\n56\n00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,500\nAnd so for those situations,\nwe have the PMI,\n\n57\n00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,760\nthe Project Management Institute,\nand they've created the PMP\n\n58\n00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,150\ncertification that's built around\ntheir model of managing projects.\n\n59\n00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,670\nAnd it creates a standardized\nframework that says\n\n60\n00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,570\nhere's how you perform XYZ activity as\nfar as managing the project is concerned.\n\n61\n00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,550\nAnd if you have five different\nproject managers that are all PMP's,\n\n62\n00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,510\nthen they're all going to be\nmanaging the projects the same way.\n\n63\n00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,390\nThat makes it easy to compare and\nmonitor projects,\n\n64\n00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,050\nmonitor performance and all that.\n\n65\n00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,740\nAnd it just makes things a heck of\na lot more stable and consistent.\n\n66\n00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,390\nSo that's the real value of\nsomething like the PMI's framework.\n\n67\n00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:06,320\nAnd the PMP certification is your way to\ndesignate that you know that information,\n\n68\n00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720\nyou know how to manage a project that way.\n\n69\n00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,620\nSo very, very valuable.\n\n70\n00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:14,340\nAll right now, if you haven't already,\nI really encourage you to go and watch,\n\n71\n00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,010\nwe did a little intro to PMP video.\n\n72\n00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,020\nJust a video that\nexplained what the PMP was,\n\n73\n00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,220\nhow to get certified,\nhow to take the exam, the requirements,\n\n74\n00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,550\nbecause not everybody meets\nthe requirements to take the PMP exam.\n\n75\n00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,160\nIf you don't meet the requirements,\n\n76\n00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,050\nthen there's not a heck of a lot of point\nin trying to pursue the certification.\n\n77\n00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,800\nBut the knowledge is still very valuable.\n\n78\n00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,720\nSo don't feel like you\ncan't watch the show,\n\n79\n00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,090\njust cuz you don't meet the requirements.\n\n80\n00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,480\nThere's a lot of value in knowing\nhow to properly manage a project and\n\n81\n00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,460\nyou can use that whether you're a PMP,\nwhether you're the project manager, or\n\n82\n00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,080\nwhether you're just a member\non that project team.\n\n83\n00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,500\nBecause if you understand how that project\nmanager is working, it makes it that much\n\n84\n00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,300\neasier to communicate with them and\nto get information out of them.\n\n85\n00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,500\nVersus if you have no clue what it\nis they are doing often times we\n\n86\n00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,290\nthink that they are stalling or\ncreating useless paperwork,\n\n87\n00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,080\nwhen there's actually a reason for\nwhat they're doing.\n\n88\n00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,034\nSo it's a very good\ninformation to have and\n\n89\n00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:14,759\ndefinitely a good thing to be aware of.\n\n90\n00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,220\nAll right now, the PMP itself\nis an interesting certification.\n\n91\n00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,310\nA lot of vendors that are out there,\nlike Microsoft and Cisco and so\n\n92\n00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,550\non, they had these exams and\n\n93\n00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,180\nthere's no book or whatever that\nsays what's gonna be on the exam.\n\n94\n00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,950\nThey give you an outline,\n\n95\n00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,200\nand they say here's an outline of the\npossible topics that could be on the exam.\n\n96\n00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,580\nAnd you should know these, right?\n\n97\n00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,220\nAnd then it's up to you to go out and\n\n98\n00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,590\nlearn everything you can\nabout each of those topics.\n\n99\n00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,780\nWell, with the PMI, the exam is\nentirely based off of one book.\n\n100\n00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,210\nAnd that book is\nthe Project Management Body of Knowledge,\n\n101\n00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,665\nor the PMBOK is what\na lot of people call it.\n\n102\n00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:58,390\nP-M-B-O-K, the project management body\nof knowledge, which is a collection of\n\n103\n00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,258\nall the different information they\nhave on how to manage a project.\n\n104\n00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:03,118\nIt's about 600?\n\n105\n00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:03,737\n>> Yeah.\n\n106\n00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,950\n>> It's huge, it's a big book.\n\n107\n00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,420\nAnd so it's a lot of information to handle\nand that's where our show comes in,\n\n108\n00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,040\nis that we're gonna go through and\nkind of put it into a way that\n\n109\n00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,192\nis a little more logical makes\na little bit more sense.\n\n110\n00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:21,365\nIn today's episode we're actually\ngonna go through part of the PMBOK.\n\n111\n00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:22,775\nIn all the other episodes,\n\n112\n00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:26,385\nwe won't do that, cuz the PMBOK,\nit doesn't read like a book.\n\n113\n00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,675\nYou're not suppose to read\nit from cover to cover,\n\n114\n00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:32,945\nit doesn't make sense to read it in the\norder that the information is in there.\n\n115\n00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:34,915\nIt's designed as a reference book,\nmore like an encyclopedia.\n\n116\n00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:38,475\nYou'd never read an encyclopedia\nfrom cover to cover,\n\n117\n00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:41,190\nit's too many disjointed\nideas slapped together.\n\n118\n00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,000\nBut if you wanna learn about\nthe Queen of England and\n\n119\n00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,085\nyou go and you crack open the E\nvolume in the encyclopedia and\n\n120\n00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:51,250\nyou go to England or U or\nwhatever it would be under.\n\n121\n00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,490\nThen you could go in there and find it and\nthere's the information you need.\n\n122\n00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,405\nThat's what the PMBOK\nis designed to be like.\n\n123\n00:06:58,405 --> 00:06:59,590\nAll right.\n\n124\n00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,410\nSo, before we dive too much\ninto crazy specifics or\n\n125\n00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,950\nwhatever, let's start off\nwith some general concepts.\n\n126\n00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,480\n>> Right.\n\n127\n00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,740\n>> Ideas, theories, words, definitions\nthat we need to be aware of for the exam.\n\n128\n00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,400\nPart of the exam is not\njust knowing an idea, but\n\n129\n00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,350\nknowing the PMIs terminology for it.\n\n130\n00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,660\nThey have special words that they use\nwhen they refer to certain things,\n\n131\n00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,100\nand you might use completely different\nwords out in your day to day operations.\n\n132\n00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,920\nBut on the exam you're gonna get\nit one way and that's the PMI way.\n\n133\n00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,350\nSo let's start off with\nprobably the most important\n\n134\n00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,010\nthing that we're gonna learn in\nprobably the entire series of shows.\n\n135\n00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,950\nWhat is a project?\n\n136\n00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,460\nRight, cuz not everything is.\n\n137\n00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,990\nLet me see, actually I guess it'd probably\nbe worth while to show the PMBOK.\n\n138\n00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,637\nIf you join the project\nmanagement institute you\n\n139\n00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:57,363\nget a free copy of the PMBOK.\n\n140\n00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:59,197\nA digital copy and\nthat's what I've got pulled up here.\n\n141\n00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:01,682\nIf you aren't a member\nyou can go ahead and\n\n142\n00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:06,246\nbuy them they're not incredibly\nexpensive I think they're I don't know.\n\n143\n00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:07,290\n>> $67 I think.\n\n144\n00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:07,870\n>> Are they really?\n>> Yeah.\n\n145\n00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,400\n>> That seems a little high doesn't it?\n\n146\n00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,670\nLet's see if we can find\nit on old Amazon here.\n\n147\n00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,110\nA Guide to the Project Management Body\nof Knowledge.\n\n148\n00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,170\n>> Which edition?\n\n149\n00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,880\nOh that says-\n>> January 1, 2013, that's probably,\n\n150\n00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,050\noh it is 5th edition, all right.\n\n151\n00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,430\n>> 20 bucks.\n>> Wait a minute, $21 to rent?\n\n152\n00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,210\nWhat is that, you can rent things now?\n\n153\n00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,935\n>> I guess.\n\n154\n00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,830\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well.\n\n155\n00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,450\nHere we go.\n>> There it is.\n\n156\n00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,460\nYeah.\nFifty bucks.\n\n157\n00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,290\n>> So to get a paper copy is 50 bucks.\n\n158\n00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,100\nTo get the Kindle edition is 20 bucks.\n\n159\n00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's the way to go right there.\n\n160\n00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,500\nYou can go out and buy a copy, or if you\njoin the PMI, you get a copy for free.\n\n161\n00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,700\nYou can get one, one way or another.\n\n162\n00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,710\nThe pinbok, the project management body\nof knowledge, is the PMI framework.\n\n163\n00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,310\nThis is what the exam is based on.\n\n164\n00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,570\nThis one book.\n\n165\n00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,590\nEvery answer to the exam is in this\nbook somewhere you just have to know it.\n\n166\n00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,782\nBut it's a big book.\n\n167\n00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:01,670\nAll right.\nSo like I've said I've got my\n\n168\n00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,740\nPDF right here.\n\n169\n00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:10,000\nAnd you'll see that it is a pretty\nbig document, 615 pages, the PDF.\n\n170\n00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,280\nAnd as you go through\nit breaks things down.\n\n171\n00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,750\nAnd we're going to start off right\nhere with just,what is a project,\n\n172\n00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,890\nwhat is project management.\n\n173\n00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,880\nThese general concepts and we're going\nto stay true to this all the way through\n\n174\n00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,410\nto about here,\nat the end of project phases.\n\n175\n00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,810\nBecause then it starts to go into\nproject management processes here and\n\n176\n00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,140\nthat's where things start\nto go kind of crazy.\n\n177\n00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,640\nRight?\n\n178\n00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,150\nThey follow a very regimented\nmodel of providing that data.\n\n179\n00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,395\nIt's not necessarily in an order\nthat makes sense to us normally.\n\n180\n00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:46,360\nRight.\nIt's a barrier to learning.\n\n181\n00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,140\nSo we're going to rearrange everything\nafter that point in the book.\n\n182\n00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,270\nTo follow the chronological\norder of managing a project.\n\n183\n00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,360\nPut it in context, and say,\n\"I'm a project manager.\n\n184\n00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,720\nHow do I work with all this\nstuff down here?\" Well,\n\n185\n00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,710\nwe'll put it in order from when\nyou get started and so on.\n\n186\n00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:08,660\nFor example, you look here in the book and\nyou'll see stuff listed towards the end\n\n187\n00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,095\nof the book that is stuff you\nwould do early on in the project.\n\n188\n00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:14,678\nSo as I move later on,\nI'll show you an example.\n\n189\n00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:16,510\n>> Look at 13.1.\n\n190\n00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,720\n>> Well, yeah, here,\nPlan Stakeholder Management.\n\n191\n00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,180\nYou do that very early on in the project,\nit's darn near the end of the book.\n\n192\n00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,360\nSo it's put an order here\nbased on your job role,\n\n193\n00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,400\nwhat it is that your\njob responsibility is.\n\n194\n00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,090\nBut we'll take it and\nmake it chronological.\n\n195\n00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,580\nIt makes a little more sense there.\n\n196\n00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,580\nBut definitely good information in here\nyou want to have a copy of the PIMBAC\n\n197\n00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,630\nhandy just as a reference\nto see the official way.\n\n198\n00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,920\nAnd, they got some nice diagrams.\n\n199\n00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,240\nYou can always count on\nthe PMI to have good diagrams.\n\n200\n00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,950\nSo definitely worth looking at there.\n\n201\n00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,130\nAll right.\nSo I want to start off with that basic\n\n202\n00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,670\nidea of what is a project, and\nPMI has a very very specific\n\n203\n00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,670\ndefinition of what that project is, and\nit's this first sentence right here.\n\n204\n00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,770\nA project is a temporary endeavor\nundertaken to create a unique product,\n\n205\n00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,345\nservice, or result.\n\n206\n00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:08,930\nOkay?\n\n207\n00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:14,370\nThat one sentence,\nit sounds really simple,\n\n208\n00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,140\nbut it's communicating something very,\nvery important.\n\n209\n00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,315\nThat keyword being temporary.\n\n210\n00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:20,410\nRight?\n\n211\n00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,320\nYou never have open ended projects.\n\n212\n00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,270\nSomethings is either a project or\nit's not.\n\n213\n00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,970\nProjects have to have\na defined finish point.\n\n214\n00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,982\nA way to know that they are complete.\n\n215\n00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:34,170\nAll right?\n\n216\n00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,650\nIn a company you have two\ndifferent types of activities.\n\n217\n00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,384\nYou have projects, like these, and you\nhave what are called on-going operations.\n\n218\n00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:43,124\nAll right?\n\n219\n00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:46,820\nOn-going operations don't have\nan end date, they're not temporary.\n\n220\n00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,330\nTheir long running projects are temporary.\n\n221\n00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:50,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n222\n00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,430\n>> So for example,\nlet's say that you work for\n\n223\n00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,900\nFord Motor Company, so a car manufacturer.\n\n224\n00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,160\nAnd you as a company decide that\nit's time to create a new car.\n\n225\n00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,180\nSo what's a Ford?\n\n226\n00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,365\n>> Let's do a Ford Focus.\n\n227\n00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:06,410\n[LAUGH]\n>> A Ford Focus.\n\n228\n00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,510\nAll right,\nwe're picking the luxury vehicle.\n\n229\n00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,280\nAlright so the Ford Focus.\n\n230\n00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,238\nSo we decided hey, it's 2014 right now.\n\n231\n00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:15,090\n>> Right.\n\n232\n00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:20,580\n>> 2015's around the corner, so\nwe need to design our new Ford Focus.\n\n233\n00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,210\nSo we create a project.\n\n234\n00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,800\nCreating that Ford Focus,\ncreating the new model for 2015.\n\n235\n00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,070\nThat is a temporary endeavor.\n\n236\n00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,680\nYou're not gonna be constantly creating\na new model for 2015 in 2016 or 2017.\n\n237\n00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,090\nSo you've got a deadline too.\n\n238\n00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,970\nWe need to finish that design\nby a particular time so\n\n239\n00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,950\nthat we have time to manufacture\nthe car so it's ready.\n\n240\n00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:47,590\nAnd we're in May, of 2014, so\n2015s are probably already out.\n\n241\n00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,350\n>> Yeah.\n\n242\n00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,530\n>> So lets say it's the 2016 Ford Focus.\n\n243\n00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,820\nWell, we probably need to have that\ndone by December of this year.\n\n244\n00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,150\nSo that it can manufacture it and\nget it on sale by summer of 2015,\n\n245\n00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,650\nsince that's what they seem\nto do with the models.\n\n246\n00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,140\nSo, we got a deadline.\n\n247\n00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,510\nWe need a new design for this vehicle and\n\n248\n00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,260\nmanufacturing process in place\nby December of this year.\n\n249\n00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,420\nAll right?\n\n250\n00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,300\nNow, we start to create\nthe project around that.\n\n251\n00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,020\nWe assemble our team members, we come\nup with our work breakdown structure.\n\n252\n00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,680\nAll the various things that we need\nto do to manage the project, and\n\n253\n00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,050\nwe work towards that deadline.\n\n254\n00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,550\nAnd when we hit that deadline,\nhow do we know if we're successful?\n\n255\n00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,390\nDid we finish what we set out to do?\n\n256\n00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,610\nDid we come up with a design for\nthe new 2016 Ford Focus?\n\n257\n00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,540\nAnd is it ready for manufacturing.\n\n258\n00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,440\nAll right?\n\n259\n00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,510\nThat's a project.\n\n260\n00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,990\nNow when that project's done,\nwe create a design.\n\n261\n00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,670\nRight?\n\n262\n00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,380\nSo now the company starts\nmanufacturing that car, and\n\n263\n00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,240\nthey're gonna manufacture\nnot one 2016 Ford Focus.\n\n264\n00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,460\nThey're gonna manufacture\ntens of thousands, hundreds,\n\n265\n00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,290\nI have no idea how many\nof those cars they sell.\n\n266\n00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,710\nProbably hundreds of thousands,\nI'd imagine.\n\n267\n00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,610\nYou see them all over the road.\n\n268\n00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,360\nSo they're gonna manufacture tons of them.\n\n269\n00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,610\nWell, those aren't projects.\n\n270\n00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,495\nThat's an ongoing operation.\n\n271\n00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,400\nRight?\nThey're manufacturing cars\n\n272\n00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,770\nevery single day.\n\n273\n00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,560\nMight be different cars, but\nthey are manufacturing cars every day, so\n\n274\n00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,250\nthat's an ongoing\noperation of the company.\n\n275\n00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,330\nOngoing operations are normally\nhow your company makes money.\n\n276\n00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,880\nYour company doesn't normally\nmake money from projects,\n\n277\n00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,248\nthey normally make it\nfrom ongoing operations.\n\n278\n00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:24,141\nRight?\n\n279\n00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:29,120\nAn exception would be in IT.\n\n280\n00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,270\nIf you're a contractor and\nsomebody hires you to perform a project\n\n281\n00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,370\nwell you're making money\nby doing that project.\n\n282\n00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,780\nBut the company that is\nsponsoring this project.\n\n283\n00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,090\nThey're not only making money from that,\n\n284\n00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,820\nthey're making money from\nthe ongoing operation of it.\n\n285\n00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,770\nAlright?\n\n286\n00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,010\nSo, for example, I might create a project\nhere for our studio, and say, boy,\n\n287\n00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,130\nthis light over here\njust seems too bright.\n\n288\n00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,060\nSo I'm gonna create a project that is to\n\n289\n00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,500\nredesign our lighting solution here for\nthe studio.\n\n290\n00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,720\nSo I go out and I find a contractor\ndo the whole process and\n\n291\n00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,035\nget them to come in and do this.\n\n292\n00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:02,560\nRight?\n\n293\n00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,150\nSo now I've got a project.\n\n294\n00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,220\nI'm not adjusting lights every day.\n\n295\n00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,090\nI'm just having them come in and\ndo it this one time, get things set right.\n\n296\n00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,720\nAll right?\nAnd then we stop.\n\n297\n00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,820\nNow, we don't make money because\nour lighting is right, or\n\n298\n00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,140\nbecause of that project, but once the\nlighting is right, our videos look better,\n\n299\n00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,640\npeople want to watch them more,\nand that's how we make money.\n\n300\n00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,480\nSo that's an ongoing thing.\n\n301\n00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,129\nWhen we film an episode,\nthat's an ongoing operation for us.\n\n302\n00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,278\nGetting us to show up.\n\n303\n00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:29,642\n>> [LAUGH] l\n>> That's the project around here.\n\n304\n00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:31,239\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n305\n00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:34,060\n>> All right.\nSo keep that in mind on the exam.\n\n306\n00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,500\nThe keyword here, temporary.\n\n307\n00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,760\nRight?\nTemporary, and\n\n308\n00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,440\nit has to have a well defined finish.\n\n309\n00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,872\nSome way that we know we're done.\n\n310\n00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:43,070\nAll right?\n\n311\n00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,200\nIf you have a project that doesn't have a\nwell defined way of establishing that it's\n\n312\n00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,036\ndone you are doomed to failure.\n\n313\n00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:50,542\nAll right?\n\n314\n00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:54,003\nWhen I was a kid,\nMom would give me a chore.\n\n315\n00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:55,490\nShe would say clean the house.\n\n316\n00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,742\nWell how do you know when you are done?\n\n317\n00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:00,599\nHow do you know when the house is clean?\n\n318\n00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,561\nWell I'll tell you as a kid it isn't,\nright?\n\n319\n00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,581\nSo there is no finished, right?\n\n320\n00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:08,180\nSo no matter how much or\nhow little you do it's not done.\n\n321\n00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,110\nSo we need to have something\nthat's well defined, and\n\n322\n00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,880\nwe say all right if I clean the house\nI mean you need to vacuum the floor,\n\n323\n00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,460\nall the dishes need to be washed and\nthe garbage needs to be taken out, right?\n\n324\n00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,520\nThat's something I can measure against,\nare those three things done?\n\n325\n00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,670\nYes, the house is cleaned.\n\n326\n00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,970\nAre those three things not done?\n\n327\n00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,270\nNo, it's not clean, right?\n\n328\n00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,440\nSo, that's another part of a project.\n\n329\n00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,100\nIt's got to be well-defined.\n\n330\n00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,722\nAll right, and we're going to see\nthat as we go through the show.\n\n331\n00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:38,615\nHaving things well-defined is really the\nkey to success because, otherwise you can\n\n332\n00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:42,179\nend up with, we'll talk about this later\nalso, which is called scope creep,\n\n333\n00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:45,854\nwhere if you don't define your project\nwith rigid boundaries, your project has\n\n334\n00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:49,475\na tendency to grow and get bigger and\nbigger and messier and messier, and before\n\n335\n00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,297\nyou know it you're way over budget, way\nbehind schedule, and doomed to failure.\n\n336\n00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:55,330\nAlright.\n\n337\n00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,080\nSo keep that in mind as we go forth.\n\n338\n00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,410\nAlright now the result of a project,\n\n339\n00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,300\nwhen a project is done a lot of us think\nof it as creating something tangible,\n\n340\n00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,185\nsomething you can hold but, I'll tell you,\nin IT, that's not always the case.\n\n341\n00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:15,175\nThe result of the project might\nbe to create a web server or\n\n342\n00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:17,985\na website or something like that and\nthen you do have something tangible.\n\n343\n00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:20,645\nYou can see this new website but,\n\n344\n00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:25,175\nmany times the project might be\nsimply to create a process, right.\n\n345\n00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:27,430\nUsing the forward example again.\n\n346\n00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,460\nIf we created the design there, right.\n\n347\n00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,880\nThe design for the 2016 Ford Focus.\n\n348\n00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,308\nWe didn't actually make the car.\n\n349\n00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:35,630\nWe might have done some prototypes,\nas part of the project but\n\n350\n00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,570\nwe didn't actually create the car.\n\n351\n00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,430\nWe created an idea, a service, a process.\n\n352\n00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,080\nRight?\n\n353\n00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,308\nAnd then that process gets used to\ncreate the actual tangible item.\n\n354\n00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:48,116\nAll right.\n\n355\n00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:52,347\nSo, there are a few other terms we\nneed to be aware of that can be kind\n\n356\n00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:54,850\nof confused in the world of projects.\n\n357\n00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,500\nRight?\n\n358\n00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,570\nSo, we have projects,\nportfolios and programs.\n\n359\n00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,380\nAll right?\n\n360\n00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,680\nWhat the heck are these?\n\n361\n00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:10,840\nWell any given company might have one\nproject going on at once, they might have\n\n362\n00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,910\nten projects going on, they might have\nfifty projects going on at once, right?\n\n363\n00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,460\nSo you might have many many projects\ngoing on at any given time.\n\n364\n00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,700\nIf you take all of those projects and\n\n365\n00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,030\ngroup them together that is\nwhat's called your program.\n\n366\n00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:30,240\nOkay, a program is a collection\nof projects that have similar or\n\n367\n00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,340\nrelated goals.\n\n368\n00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,080\nIn fact, I think they say that in here\nsomewhere, but, you know, similar or\n\n369\n00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,990\nrelated goals.\n\n370\n00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,380\nOne of the best examples that I can\nthink of, you know, we're in the U.S.\n\n371\n00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,760\nSo I always think of U.S. based examples.\n\n372\n00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,280\nThe United States government has\nthe United States space program, right?\n\n373\n00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,430\nOur space program is headed up by NASA,\n\n374\n00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,187\nthe National Aeronautics and\nSpace something.\n\n375\n00:18:56,187 --> 00:19:00,100\n[LAUGH] So we have NASA that\nheads up our space program.\n\n376\n00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,370\nAnd they have a number of projects,\nevery spaceship launch,\n\n377\n00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,850\nevery time they launch a rocket,\nevery time they launch a shuttle,\n\n378\n00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,630\nwhich I guess they don't do anymore.\n\n379\n00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,210\nAny time they do those things, each one is\na project, but all of them are working to\n\n380\n00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,410\na similar goal, to do research and\nexploration in outer space.\n\n381\n00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,510\nAnd so a similar goal, different unique\nprojects all grouped together into one\n\n382\n00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:28,740\nprogram, then, the United States\ngovernment has more than one program.\n\n383\n00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,420\nSo we get the space program but\nwe also have the education program, and\n\n384\n00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,240\nother things, like welfare program,\neach of these different social services.\n\n385\n00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,010\nEach of those are programs.\n\n386\n00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,230\nIf we gather all those programs together,\n\n387\n00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,890\nthat's our portfolio and I mean,\nyou got to be big to have a portfolio.\n\n388\n00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,650\nYeah.\nI use the United States Government,\n\n389\n00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,930\nhow much bigger of a company\ncan we think of, you know,\n\n390\n00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,710\nin the private sector it's not often\nthat you see programs like this.\n\n391\n00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,660\n>> Yeah.\n\n392\n00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:05,770\n>> Microsoft, Oracle, HP, huge companies\nlike that they may well have a portfolio.\n\n393\n00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,473\nWe'll use HP, right.\n\n394\n00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,760\nSo HP they have various divisions inside\nof their company, they have service\n\n395\n00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,750\ndivisions, server divisions, desktop and\nlaptop, consumer and business.\n\n396\n00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,330\nSo each of those might be\npart of their programs.\n\n397\n00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,340\nAnd then each program then has\nindividual projects inside of it, so\n\n398\n00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,330\nit just depends on the size\nof your organization.\n\n399\n00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,730\nYou may or may not have these three\nelements, but just be aware that\n\n400\n00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,660\nportfolio, program, project,\nthree distinctly different things.\n\n401\n00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,642\n>> Yeah I know the example you were using\nabout Ford Motor Company itself, right?\n\n402\n00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:38,841\nYou actually can have different divisions,\nlike their car division and\n\n403\n00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:42,050\ntheir truck division again,\neach of those may be programs within that.\n\n404\n00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,308\nEach particular design match should\nbe a project unto itself and\n\n405\n00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:48,400\nthen year by year there may be\nsub projects underneath that.\n\n406\n00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,930\nSo again, a lot of times, when you\ntake a look here, you'll see that.\n\n407\n00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,440\nJust about any company can actually\nhave a number of different\n\n408\n00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,260\nprojects that are going on within,\n\n409\n00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,300\nthat may be controlled by different\nprograms that are actually under them.\n\n410\n00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,120\nSo just realize that everybody actually\nis going to fall in there somewhere\n\n411\n00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,300\nin the midst of project management.\n\n412\n00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,370\nYou're going to actually see that\nit's going to really again determine\n\n413\n00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,870\nsome of the ways that our project develops\n\n414\n00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,050\ndepending on where we are actually in\nthat particular portfolio and program.\n\n415\n00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,190\n>> You know, you mentioned sub-projects,\nwhich a completely forgot about, and\n\n416\n00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,870\nit jogged my memory about\na diagram that's in the pinbot.\n\n417\n00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,800\nLet me pull this up here real quick.\n\n418\n00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,157\nIt looks like some kind of crazy octopus.\n\n419\n00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:26,050\n>> [LAUGH] That is crazy.\n\n420\n00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,874\n>> But they're just kind of showing\nall the different breakdowns that you\n\n421\n00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:29,780\nmight have.\n\n422\n00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,110\nSee here how they've got\na portfolio up at the top,\n\n423\n00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,070\nand then from there it divides down.\n\n424\n00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,310\nAnd normally under the portfolio\nyou'll have programs,\n\n425\n00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,420\nbut you don't necessarily have to.\n\n426\n00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,570\nIt's up to your company to create\nthe infrastructure that you want.\n\n427\n00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,510\nSo they show here under\nthe portfolio you might have\n\n428\n00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,810\nsub portfolios if they're huge and\nunder that you may have programs or\n\n429\n00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,530\nyou might have projects\nright under the portfolio.\n\n430\n00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,050\nAnd then under the program that's\nwhere you may have projects or\n\n431\n00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,210\nsub programs and\nthen under there more projects.\n\n432\n00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:02,550\nSo projects are that bottom Line entry,\nright, and when we're doing\n\n433\n00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,280\nthe PMP certification, it's projects that\nwe're learning about but you'll see that\n\n434\n00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,580\nthere's the PGMP, right, which is\nthe Program Management Professional, so\n\n435\n00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,740\nthey've got certifications for people that\nare operating at these higher levels and\n\n436\n00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:23,550\nthose are out there, but this example\nreally just focused on Projects.\n\n437\n00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,210\nSo those are some of the different\nterms we need to be aware of.\n\n438\n00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:32,020\nAfter that we need to talk a little\nbit about what a project is made up of\n\n439\n00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,625\nbecause a project can be a very,\nvery big thing.\n\n440\n00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,275\nIt can contain all sorts\nof different elements and\n\n441\n00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:41,855\ncomponents, and it's difficult to\nkind of envision the whole picture.\n\n442\n00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:46,765\nSo I did a drawing which I've got\naround here somewhere, here we go.\n\n443\n00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,810\nAnd this is basically what a project is.\n\n444\n00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,190\nA project is broken up into five phases.\n\n445\n00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,540\nNow this is a PMI thing.\n\n446\n00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,600\nPMI has five phases.\n\n447\n00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,180\nYou'll see other people like ITIL.\n\n448\n00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,780\nIf you start digging through ITIL and\n\n449\n00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,410\nfinding their project management\nstuff they have six phases.\n\n450\n00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:13,250\nSo different vendors, different frameworks\nbut with PMI you have five phases.\n\n451\n00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,080\nYou have initiation,\nwhich is just the project getting started.\n\n452\n00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,120\nHow do we know to start a project and\nget it up and going?\n\n453\n00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,570\nAfter that we have planning,\nthe planning phase is, okay,\n\n454\n00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,350\nwe've decided to do this project,\nwhat do we need to do, right?\n\n455\n00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,150\nAnd if you're a good project manager\n\n456\n00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,425\nthis is probably where you'll spend\nthe bulk of your time, right.\n\n457\n00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:40,280\nYou got to figure out how many people do\nyou need, how much money do you need, how\n\n458\n00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,480\nmuch time do you need or if you've been\nassigned time and money how do you get\n\n459\n00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,940\neverything done with the amount of time or\nwith the amount of money that you have?\n\n460\n00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,146\nYou really have to look at all the stuff\nthat gets done in the project and\n\n461\n00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:54,440\nwhat makes up those aspects, right?\n\n462\n00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,712\nSo, arranging to get everything, setting\nout that plan, that schedule, that budget.\n\n463\n00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:02,173\nAll the things that you're\ngoing to live and die by.\n\n464\n00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:04,020\nAs this project goes on.\n\n465\n00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,197\nOnce all of your planning is done,\nthen you have execution.\n\n466\n00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:14,250\nExecution is where you\nactually do the work.\n\n467\n00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,040\nAs a project manager, you're probably\nnot the person doing the work.\n\n468\n00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,680\nYou're overseeing,\nmaking sure that it's getting done.\n\n469\n00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,730\nSo maybe you've got a construction\nproject, and so you're building a house.\n\n470\n00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,870\nAnd so in the planning phase, you come up\nwith all the different elements necessary\n\n471\n00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,810\nfor what it takes to build a house.\n\n472\n00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,680\nBut when it gets to execution, you've got\ncontractors, you've got carpenters and\n\n473\n00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,440\nmaster builders, and\n\n474\n00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,220\nall those people who are actually in\nthere doing the work to build that house.\n\n475\n00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,040\nWhile they are building the house,\nyou are monitoring and controlling.\n\n476\n00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,320\nThat's our fourth phase,\nmonitoring and controlling.\n\n477\n00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,450\nThe monitoring piece is\npretty self explanatory.\n\n478\n00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,280\nWe watch.\n\n479\n00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,010\nRight?\n\n480\n00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,780\nIs work getting done on schedule,\non budget, meeting requirements, right?\n\n481\n00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,130\nThree things that we constantly watch for.\n\n482\n00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,120\nIf yes, great, we do nothing, right?\n\n483\n00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,919\nWell, paperwork.\n\n484\n00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,010\nIf no, we control, right?\n\n485\n00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,820\nWe step in, and we correct the issue.\n\n486\n00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,900\nWhy are we over budget?\n\n487\n00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,220\nWhat can we do to fix it?\n\n488\n00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,480\nWhy are we behind schedule?\n\n489\n00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,090\nWhat can we use to get back?\n\n490\n00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,680\nWhy am I, not meeting this requirement?\n\n491\n00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,500\nWhat can we do to finish it?\n\n492\n00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,970\nAnd there's actually two\nsides to this whole thing.\n\n493\n00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,070\nSo, why am I over budget\nis easy to think of, but\n\n494\n00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,095\nyou might also have why am I under budget?\n\n495\n00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:33,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Why am I not spending as much money as\n\n496\n00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,440\nI thought I was going to?\n\n497\n00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,260\n>> Yeah.\n>> What's wrong, what's missing?\n\n498\n00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,210\nWhy am I not meeting that requirement,\nbecause often times the,\n\n499\n00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,370\nthis is a quote from Dude?\n\n500\n00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,838\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The Dune books,\n\n501\n00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:48,132\nI quote those entirely too much but,\n\n502\n00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:52,578\nsometimes the absence of a thing is\nas deadly as the presence of a thing.\n\n503\n00:25:52,578 --> 00:25:55,170\nSo the absence of spending money, why not?\n\n504\n00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,810\nMaybe that indicates that I let\nsomething fall through the cracks.\n\n505\n00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,840\nI was supposed to order something and\ndidn't.\n\n506\n00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,790\nOr contractors were supposed to do\nsome work, but they didn't do it and\n\n507\n00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,090\nthey didn't bill me, and\nthat's why I haven't spent that money.\n\n508\n00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,370\nSo definitely pay attention to that.\n\n509\n00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,950\nAnd then lastly,\nwhen all the requirements have been met,\n\n510\n00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,780\nwhen everybody's signed off on everything,\nwe have closing.\n\n511\n00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,410\nWe shut the project down,\nand we determine whether or\n\n512\n00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,220\nnot it was successful or a failure?\n\n513\n00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,980\nAnd boy,\nthat's a phase that a lot of people skip,\n\n514\n00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,080\nthey just let the project peter out.\n\n515\n00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,350\nBut, it is important to\ndo a proper closing and\n\n516\n00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,120\nwe'll talk about that in a later episode.\n\n517\n00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,790\nBut basically, this is what's going\nto define that whole project.\n\n518\n00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,470\nThese five phases, right here.\n\n519\n00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,970\nYou wanna memorize these for the exam.\n\n520\n00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,700\n>> Now remember, since this particular\ncertification is about project\n\n521\n00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,910\nmanagement, right?\n\n522\n00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,340\nIt gives us the ability,\nregardless of the size of the project,\n\n523\n00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,730\nto essentially be able to kind of chop\nthem down into manageable chunks,\n\n524\n00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,845\nwhich is the whole idea behind\nthe project management.\n\n525\n00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Instead of just going here's things\n\n526\n00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,680\nthat I have to accomplish right, we can\nbe begin with the idea of initiation, and\n\n527\n00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,930\njust making sure it\ngets started correctly.\n\n528\n00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,150\nAnd then go from that point here,\nwithout going,\n\n529\n00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,050\nI wonder if the invest is gonna be okay,\nwe go ahead and begin the process and\n\n530\n00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,650\nwe follow these particular steps through.\n\n531\n00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,890\nAnd once we do so, we'll actually\nsee that if everybody else is doing,\n\n532\n00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,240\nit makes it very easy like\nwe said at the beginning.\n\n533\n00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,270\nThat if we have to step in in the middle\nof a project, we know where the project\n\n534\n00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,330\nis and that we might be able\nactually take over when we need to.\n\n535\n00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,120\nOr again, if we actually have to help out\nwe know exactly where we are as well.\n\n536\n00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,130\nSo, knowing these five steps and\nthese processes,\n\n537\n00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,319\nare really the key to understanding\nthe whole of project management.\n\n538\n00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,530\nAnd now, also keep in mind\nthat what you're seeing here,\n\n539\n00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,640\nthis is the text book definition\nof how the five phases work, but\n\n540\n00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,200\nin real life things\nare a little bit different.\n\n541\n00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600\nSo, understand that there\nis some deviation for\n\n542\n00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,220\nthis, and\nyou'll even see that on the exam.\n\n543\n00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,010\nSo I created two diagrams, I created\nthis one, project phases logical.\n\n544\n00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,435\nBut, I also created\nproject phases reality.\n\n545\n00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:58,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In reality,\n\n546\n00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,240\nit's a little bit different\nthan what we just saw.\n\n547\n00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,440\nSo, for example, we start out with\ninitiation, just like I threw in earlier.\n\n548\n00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,660\nAnd that transitions us into planning,\nokay?\n\n549\n00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,250\nBut from planning, execution and\n\n550\n00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,840\nmonitoring and controlling\nreally happen at the same time.\n\n551\n00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,610\nSome people are executing\nthe project work,\n\n552\n00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,140\nthey're getting it done, and\nother people are watching that work.\n\n553\n00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,330\nTo ensure that it is getting done,\nthat it's on schedule, on budget,\n\n554\n00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:34,120\nmeeting requirements,\nverifying all that is happening.\n\n555\n00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,480\nThose two happen at the same\ntime at least, normally they do.\n\n556\n00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,630\nThere are some projects where somebody\nexecutes, then somebody monitors, so it's.\n\n557\n00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,170\nOne after the other, but typically\nthey're done at the same time, and\n\n558\n00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:51,274\nwhen we talk about controlling that\nmeans hey something is not right.\n\n559\n00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:51,806\nHow do we fix it?\n\n560\n00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:56,530\nWell, how do we fix it requires us to go\n\n561\n00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,830\nback to planning, and\nwe plan for our correction.\n\n562\n00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,100\nThese are generally represented as what\nare called change management tickets.\n\n563\n00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,790\nWe'll go well into depth later on.\n\n564\n00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,300\nBut you're changing the project.\n\n565\n00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,870\nSomething didn't go as planned.\n\n566\n00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,750\nNow, you've got to update the plan.\n\n567\n00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,090\nSo we have to go back to the planning\nphase, make adjustments, and\n\n568\n00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,760\nthen go back to executing and\nmonitoring again.\n\n569\n00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,380\nRight?\n\n570\n00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,910\nAnd if everything goes great, wonderful.\n\n571\n00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,750\nBut if our changes don't work, if we're\nstill behind schedule or over budget or\n\n572\n00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,430\nwhatever, we go back to planning again.\n\n573\n00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,650\nWe might cycle through\nthese three phases ten, 20,\n\n574\n00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,370\n100, 1,000 times as the project goes on.\n\n575\n00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,110\nLeaving from execution and\nmonitoring, back to planning, and\n\n576\n00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,790\nback to executing again just as we go.\n\n577\n00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,650\nEvery change ticket that\nwe process is really\n\n578\n00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,000\nreturning to the planning phase,\nall right?\n\n579\n00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,730\nSo, I kind of drew some\narrows to send us back.\n\n580\n00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,620\nAnd then, when the work is done,\n\n581\n00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,520\nexecution doesn't really lead to closing,\nso I did a little dash line.\n\n582\n00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,920\nBasically, people execute.\n\n583\n00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,190\nThey do the work, and then they stop.\n\n584\n00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,620\nAnd when the monitoring phase,\nwhen these people who are monitoring\n\n585\n00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,140\nthe system look at it and say,\nyes now you meet the requirements.\n\n586\n00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,560\nIt's the monitoring phase that\nactually moves us into closing, but\n\n587\n00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,210\nyou can't do that until execution is done.\n\n588\n00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,950\nSo, really they both point to closing,\nbut it's truly the monitoring and\n\n589\n00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,840\ncontrolling side that sends us there.\n\n590\n00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,240\nSo this diagram,\nthis is just one that I did,\n\n591\n00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,020\nit's not in the pinblock, but\nit kind of shows how things really go.\n\n592\n00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n593\n00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,020\n>> So keep that in mind, as we move\nthrough each of the different phases.\n\n594\n00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,900\nAll right, well Ronnie looking at the time\nthis is a pretty good spot to stop\n\n595\n00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,440\nand take a break.\n\n596\n00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,030\n>> Sounds good.\n\n597\n00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,060\n>> When we get back, we got some\nmore fundamental topics to cover,\n\n598\n00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,820\na few different things\nwe need to jump into.\n\n599\n00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,870\nSo definitely stay tuned and, yeah.\n\n600\n00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,520\nHow is this,\nsometimes I feel I'm forgetting something?\n\n601\n00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,884\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know I've got some things,\n\n602\n00:31:02,884 --> 00:31:07,266\nI wanna talk about after the break though,\nso\n\n603\n00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:11,198\nstay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n604\n00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:12,555\n[MUSIC]\n\n605\n00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:13,430\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n606\n00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,920\nSo, before the break we were talking\nabout some of the general concepts,\n\n607\n00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,260\nwhat is a project, what is project\nmanagement, that kind of thing?\n\n608\n00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,430\nAnd just kind of focused,\n\n609\n00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,280\non the early parts of the project\nmanagement body of knowledge.\n\n610\n00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,410\nWhat we're gonna do now, is we're\ngonna move through I dont know the.\n\n611\n00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,390\n>> Different terminology.\n\n612\n00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,660\n>> The project manager dictionary.\n\n613\n00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,210\n>> Yeah dictionary.\n\n614\n00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,350\n[LAUGH]\n>> We got a couple of terms and words.\n\n615\n00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,440\nI mentioned at the beginning of this show,\n\n616\n00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,660\nPMI is really particular\nabout the words that you use.\n\n617\n00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,740\nThe specific terms they have defined for\ncertain meanings.\n\n618\n00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,258\nSo, on the exam, you're gonna see things\npresented one way and one way only.\n\n619\n00:31:47,258 --> 00:31:49,460\nSo, I wanna make sure everybody's\ncomfortable with that, and so\n\n620\n00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,910\nwe're gonna cruise though and\nkind of take a look at a few of these.\n\n621\n00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,417\nAll right, let's start with project team.\n\n622\n00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:59,530\nWhen we have a project, the project,\nthat's that overall goal,\n\n623\n00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,185\nthat thing that we're trying to achieve.\n\n624\n00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:06,023\nThe project team, are the people who\nare working to achieve that goal.\n\n625\n00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:06,743\nNow.\n\n626\n00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:09,948\nDon't confuse that with the people\nthat are actually doing the work.\n\n627\n00:32:09,948 --> 00:32:15,319\nIn a small company, like us ITProTV,\nwe're a small company, if there's\n\n628\n00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:21,120\na project the odds are every single\none of us is involved in that project.\n\n629\n00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,910\nSo we might be the ones managing project\nand the ones executing, we might be doing\n\n630\n00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,790\nthe actual work but in larger projects,\nthat's not the case, very rarely the case.\n\n631\n00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,420\nSo for example,\nthe largest project that I worked on,\n\n632\n00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,920\nI dealt with a couple that were in\nthe 2 plus million dollar range and\n\n633\n00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,360\na large project like that rarely is the\nproject manager the person who's actually\n\n634\n00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,140\ndoing the work, that's not your expertise,\nthat's not what you're getting paid for.\n\n635\n00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,660\nYou are making sure\nthe project is successful.\n\n636\n00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:54,530\nSo on those projects,\nyou have a project team that consists at\n\n637\n00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:58,380\na minimum a project manager, right and\nin a small business, maybe that's it.\n\n638\n00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,790\nThat is the whole project team,\nbut in a large business,\n\n639\n00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,990\nyou'll typically have an accountant,\nmaybe one or more lawyers,\n\n640\n00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:09,555\nyou may have scheduling assistants,\nyou may have clerks, you may have\n\n641\n00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:14,150\nsub-project managers, you might have\nvarious people that are involved,\n\n642\n00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:19,880\nnot in actually pulling off the project,\nas far as the manual labor, but\n\n643\n00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,690\nmanaging, if I can say it, the bureaucracy\nof doing project management.\n\n644\n00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,170\nThe bigger a project is the more\npaperwork and bureaucracy you have, and\n\n645\n00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,840\nyou're going to need\npeople to help with that.\n\n646\n00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,910\nMany, many organizations out there\nhave scheduling coordinators,\n\n647\n00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,910\npeople who are scheduling who\ncan do what work what day.\n\n648\n00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,645\nThe project manager's making\nsure the work gets done but\n\n649\n00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:40,935\nthey're not actually doing the work.\n\n650\n00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,215\nSo somebody else is coordinating getting\nthat in place, getting those people to\n\n651\n00:33:44,215 --> 00:33:46,835\nwhere they're supposed to be on time so\nthat the work can happen.\n\n652\n00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:47,495\nAll right?\n\n653\n00:33:47,495 --> 00:33:51,405\nSo your project team can be made up of\na number of different types of people,\n\n654\n00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:54,880\ndepending on your organization and\nthe size of the project.\n\n655\n00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,470\nIf you're running a NASA level project,\nyour project,\n\n656\n00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,940\nyour project team,\nmight be hundreds of people or\n\n657\n00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,190\nyour project team might be five people,\njust the people running the project.\n\n658\n00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,820\nFor example, you'll have the PM,\nthe project manager,\n\n659\n00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,270\nyou probably have an architect, you have\nthe financial consultants or whatever, so\n\n660\n00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,260\nthose are people that will\nbe on the project team but\n\n661\n00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,250\nthen you have the guys who pour cement for\nthe foundation, the plumbers,\n\n662\n00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,560\nthe electricians, the drywall installers.\n\n663\n00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,840\nAll of those people,\nthey're not on the project team,\n\n664\n00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,650\nthey're not submitting change tickets,\nthey're not managing budget.\n\n665\n00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,150\nThey're just doing the work.\n\n666\n00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:30,680\nAll right.\n\n667\n00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,400\nSo they influence just\nthe work that's assigned to\n\n668\n00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400\nthem not the project as a whole.\n\n669\n00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,730\nVersus project team members that\nwill typically influence the project\n\n670\n00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,660\nas a whole, right.\n\n671\n00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,050\nSo it's important that we have\nthat separation in our mind and\n\n672\n00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,680\nwe understand not every single\nperson makes up the project team.\n\n673\n00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,230\nThese are just the people who\nare assigned to the project itself.\n\n674\n00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,870\nAnd the reason I highlight that is when we\nstart a project we're going to go through\n\n675\n00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,090\na planning phase, and\nthat planning phase is where we're\n\n676\n00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,040\nthinking of what needs to get\ndone as part of that project.\n\n677\n00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,910\nWe're not actually doing it yet.\n\n678\n00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,760\nSo if I'm building a house and\nthat's my project and I'm planning, right.\n\n679\n00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,010\nI don't need my drywall installers today.\n\n680\n00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,980\nThe house doesn't even have you know\nstruts yet, the foundations not poured.\n\n681\n00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,480\nWe're not going to put up drywall.\n\n682\n00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,210\nI don't need the drywall\ninstallers until I'm ready for\n\n683\n00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,100\nthem, when I'm in the execution phase.\n\n684\n00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,590\nThe foundations done, the walls are up,\nnow I need the drywall installers.\n\n685\n00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:27,410\nSo the project team will be assigned\nvery early in the life of the project,\n\n686\n00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,170\nbecause they're part of the that\nplanning process, right?\n\n687\n00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,620\nAnd then when we get into execution,\nour project team grows if necessary.\n\n688\n00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,850\nAt least our worker base\ngrow to get that work done,\n\n689\n00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,340\nto get that project moved to completion.\n\n690\n00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,740\nSo that's our project team.\n\n691\n00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:51,444\nNow where do our project\nteam members come from?\n\n692\n00:35:51,444 --> 00:35:54,215\nThey come from all sorts of races and\nbackgrounds and cultural diversity and\n\n693\n00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:56,911\nall that but what I mean is if I need\nan accountant where do I get them right.\n\n694\n00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:58,641\nWell that really does\ndepend on your company.\n\n695\n00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:01,531\nMaybe you already have staff that's in\nplace in your company that you're able\n\n696\n00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,980\nto use and allocate to borrow to use for\nyour project team right, or\n\n697\n00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,803\nmaybe you don't and\nyou have to hire them right?\n\n698\n00:36:05,803 --> 00:36:11,333\nIf I'm kicking off a project and I don't\nhave the resources I need to go out and\n\n699\n00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:16,440\nhire the resources I need to hire\nsubproject managers or accountants,\n\n700\n00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,227\nscheduling coordinators, people like that\nto be able to support that project or\n\n701\n00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:26,994\nin a lot of larger organizations,\nwe have something called a PMO,\n\n702\n00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:30,950\nand a PMO is a Project Management Office.\n\n703\n00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,408\nAnd this is something that a small\ncompany's not going to have.\n\n704\n00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,880\nEven a mid-size company's\nprobably not going to have it but\n\n705\n00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,340\nif you're a large organization,\na PMO's job,\n\n706\n00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,080\nthe project management office's job,\nis to provide resources to project teams.\n\n707\n00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,750\nSo, when we think of a project right,\nRonnie,\n\n708\n00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,270\nlet's think of a project for ITProTV.\n\n709\n00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,430\n>> Well\n>> Put you on the spot here.\n\n710\n00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,100\n>> Yeah, can't come up with one\nright now off the top of my head.\n\n711\n00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,010\n>> Let's say that our project is to\nget rid of all the Macs on the set and\n\n712\n00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,940\nreplace them with PCs.\n\n713\n00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,560\n>> All right.\n\n714\n00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,810\nSounds good.\n\n715\n00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,700\n>> All right.\n[LAUGH] It's a joke backstage for\n\n716\n00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,485\nus that our set is slowly\nbeing eaten up by Apple.\n\n717\n00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:11,640\n[LAUGH] We have more and\nmore Apple equipment these days.\n\n718\n00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,380\nBut, so we decided that we were going\nto get rid of all that and go to PCs.\n\n719\n00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,130\nOkay?\n\n720\n00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,910\nWell, somebody has to come\nup with that idea and\n\n721\n00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,395\nthat somebody has to be somebody,\nI want to say, somebody with power!\n\n722\n00:37:23,395 --> 00:37:24,400\n[LAUGH] But it's not so\n\n723\n00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,510\nmuch power as it is, somebody with\nthe authority to make the change, right?\n\n724\n00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,488\n>> Right.\n>> So if we have a mail room clerk,\n\n725\n00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:34,010\nwhich we don't, we're not that big,\nbut if you have a mail room clerk,\n\n726\n00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:38,402\nthey can't say we're going to cut\nexpenditures by 30% this year.\n\n727\n00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:39,360\n>> Right.\n\n728\n00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,174\n>> Well\n>> You're a mail room clerk,\n\n729\n00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,080\nyou're not going to do anything.\n\n730\n00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,470\nYou're going to put letters in mailboxes.\n\n731\n00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:48,180\nSo but if the CEO comes down, or the\nVice President of Finance comes down or\n\n732\n00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,660\nwhatever and says hey,\nwe're going to cut expenditures,\n\n733\n00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,740\nwe need to do a project to find out here\nwe're going to pull this off, right?\n\n734\n00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,610\nThey have the authority to do it.\n\n735\n00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,900\nThey become what's called\nthe primary stakeholder.\n\n736\n00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,870\nA project has stakeholders, I think I am\njumping a little bit ahead of our list,\n\n737\n00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:10,070\nbut they're the person who has\na vested interest in that project and\n\n738\n00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:14,680\nsince it's their idea,\nthey're what's called the sponsor.\n\n739\n00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,290\nSo the sponsor is the person who\nlends their authority to the project.\n\n740\n00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,870\nThe project can't get done without\nauthority to do it, and so\n\n741\n00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,140\nyou need a sponsor.\n\n742\n00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,930\nNow in an organization with a PMO,\nsee as I tie it back in.\n\n743\n00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,300\nThe sponsor goes to the PMO and\n\n744\n00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,540\nsays, I've got this idea,\nI want to replace the Macs with PC's or\n\n745\n00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,790\nthe other way around I want to replace\nthe PC's with Mac's, whatever it is right.\n\n746\n00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,470\nI want to throw them all away and\nswitch to Linux.\n\n747\n00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,150\nRight.\n\n748\n00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,650\nSo we'll do that project.\n\n749\n00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,760\nWe're going to ditch everything and\njust to go to Linux.\n\n750\n00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,120\nSo the sponsor goes to the PMO and\nsays here's my project.\n\n751\n00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,220\nI want to replace all of these PCs and\nall the Macs with Linux.\n\n752\n00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,310\nAll right?\n\n753\n00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,560\nI need some resources and\nthe PMO will say you know what,\n\n754\n00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,980\nwe've got just the project manager for\nyou.\n\n755\n00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,370\nLet's assign this project manager to it.\n\n756\n00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,700\nThe sponsor then gives authority\nto the project manager.\n\n757\n00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,397\nAnd we are going to talk about that more\nin the initiation and planning phases\n\n758\n00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:12,152\nlater on but they give that authority\nto the project manager, and the project\n\n759\n00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:16,380\nmanager can look at what the sponsor\nwants and start to formulate their needs.\n\n760\n00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,680\nAnd the project manager can\nturn around to the PMO and\n\n761\n00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,500\nsay, okay, I'm going to need\none scheduling coordinator,\n\n762\n00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,549\nI'm going to need two sub project\nmanagers, I'm going to need an accountant.\n\n763\n00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,670\nAnd I don't need full time attorneys,\nbut I may need an attorney on\n\n764\n00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,780\nretainer just for consultant throughout\nthe project and the PMO will say, \"Oh.\n\n765\n00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,310\nOkay.\n\n766\n00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,440\nHere's what you need.\n\n767\n00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,150\nHere, you can give it to you.\n\n768\n00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,120\nYou need a web developer?\n\n769\n00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,380\nAlright, you can have this\nweb developer these days.\n\n770\n00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,100\nAnd they start to assign\nthe resources to the project.\n\n771\n00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,740\nThat's the primary goal for a PMO,\nis management of resources.\n\n772\n00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,420\nAnd by resources I mean not just human\nresources, but also material resources.\n\n773\n00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,790\nSo the PMO is kind of that gateway.\n\n774\n00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,725\nIn fully projectized environments,\nthe PMO may also be the ones that\n\n775\n00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:05,764\nmake the decision as to which projects\nto do, and which ones not to do.\n\n776\n00:40:05,764 --> 00:40:06,845\n>> Yeah.\n>> Ronnie,\n\n777\n00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:11,580\nI'm having a hard time remembering\nthe name for the, PMI doesn't hit on it.\n\n778\n00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:17,080\nBut there's this name for\nwhen a PMO in a fully projectized\n\n779\n00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,560\nenvironment where the PMO is running\nthe show, people submit project ideas.\n\n780\n00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,300\nAnd the PMO will quantify\nthose projects and\n\n781\n00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,520\nrank them based on risk versus reward,\ncost and benefit analysis, they'll do\n\n782\n00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,080\nall that stuff to determine which projects\nare the most beneficial to the company and\n\n783\n00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,680\nwhich ones aren't, and then just the ones\nthat are most beneficial get approved.\n\n784\n00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,210\nSo the PMO may actually be picking\nwhich projects your company takes.\n\n785\n00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,960\nI've never worked in an environment\nthat had a PMO with that much authority.\n\n786\n00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,780\nMost of the places where I've\nworked that have had PMOs\n\n787\n00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,600\nhave really just been resource management.\n\n788\n00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,450\nSo there's different levels\nof project management office,\n\n789\n00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,430\ndepending on how projectized\nyour company is.\n\n790\n00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,650\n>> Now sometimes you actually hear\nthere's three different terms with them.\n\n791\n00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,810\nOne is just the idea of being supportive,\nright?\n\n792\n00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,420\nWhere they do actually just\nmanage their resources.\n\n793\n00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,695\nOther ones are as directive,\nas what Don just described.\n\n794\n00:41:09,695 --> 00:41:11,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then there's that mix and\n\n795\n00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,910\nbalance of them.\n\n796\n00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,750\nWhere again, they're working\nwith a project manager, and\n\n797\n00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,940\nthey're really just again coordinating\nwith the project manager themselves.\n\n798\n00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,880\nSo when you see these types of PMOs,\nthey could actually just be as simple as,\n\n799\n00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,130\nall right, we're taking over\na project here and here's the stuff\n\n800\n00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,850\nhelp me project management office,\nto figure out what I really need to do.\n\n801\n00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,030\nAnd some of them do provide\nthe idea of guidance.\n\n802\n00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,180\nIt may be a project manager doesn't\nknow exactly what to do, but\n\n803\n00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,050\nyet they have that project\nmanagement office that can help them\n\n804\n00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,420\nto be able to flesh things out\na little bit better, yeah.\n\n805\n00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,450\n>> Yeah, so that is a growing concept.\n\n806\n00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,550\nA lot companies are starting\nto adopt this concept of PMO.\n\n807\n00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:52,320\nThere's still plenty of organizations\nout there that don't have a PMO at all.\n\n808\n00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,360\nIf you don't have a PMO,\nthat project sponsor,\n\n809\n00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,510\nwhen they give authority to the project\nmanager, they're also giving them\n\n810\n00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,050\nauthority to reach out and\ngrab the other resources they may need.\n\n811\n00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:07,140\nAnd they'll have to coordinate that\nwith the various departments and so on.\n\n812\n00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,470\nNow, I mentioned departments.\n\n813\n00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,410\nInside of a company,\nmost companies are not projectized.\n\n814\n00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,250\nNow I used that term earlier and\nI didn't qualify it.\n\n815\n00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:21,780\nThe term projectized means that in\na company, I almost want to jump ahead and\n\n816\n00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,025\ntalk about organizational structure,\nlet me see in my notes.\n\n817\n00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:26,960\nIt's way down there, isn't it?\n\n818\n00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,520\nWell, let me just try and\nuse non committal terms.\n\n819\n00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,220\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n820\n00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,530\n>> So, in your company,\n\n821\n00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:37,070\nif your company's primary\nfocus is performing projects,\n\n822\n00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,640\nthen your project managers are going\nto have a lot of authority.\n\n823\n00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,520\nRight?\nThey're going to be\n\n824\n00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,620\npeople in charge of other people.\n\n825\n00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,490\nBut most companies aren't setup that way.\n\n826\n00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,220\nMost companies are not project driven.\n\n827\n00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,680\nThey're product driven.\n\n828\n00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,750\nThey sell some kind of a product and\nthat's what makes the company money.\n\n829\n00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,300\nAnd that's where they\nreally put their focus.\n\n830\n00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,050\nWell, remember I said earlier in the show\nthat what makes your company money\n\n831\n00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,450\nis normally the ongoing activities, right?\n\n832\n00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,510\nInside of a company like that you\nmay have project managers, but\n\n833\n00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:08,740\nyou'll typically have\nfunctional managers also.\n\n834\n00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,120\nAnd a functional manager,\n\n835\n00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,750\nthat's a person who's in charge of\nsome of those ongoing activities.\n\n836\n00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,910\nAnd in most companies,\n\n837\n00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,660\nalmost every company I've worked for, the\nfunctional managers have more authority.\n\n838\n00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,250\nSo let's put this in IT terms.\n\n839\n00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,190\nIn the IT world,\nyou might have a network manager,\n\n840\n00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,380\nsystem administrator, manager,\nthe system management team.\n\n841\n00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:37,280\nYou might have a chief information\nofficer, and IT manager, or IS manager.\n\n842\n00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,900\nThese are managerial positions that\ngovern the ongoing operations of IT.\n\n843\n00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,700\nAnd that manager title that they\nget lends them authority over\n\n844\n00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,780\nall of the employees that\nare a part of that department.\n\n845\n00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,560\nBut then you have a project manager, and\n\n846\n00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,680\nthe project manager doesn't\nhave any employees.\n\n847\n00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,640\nNobody answers to the project manager.\n\n848\n00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,720\nThe project manager is assigned projects,\nand\n\n849\n00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,970\nthen they borrow employees from\nthese functional managers.\n\n850\n00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:06,530\nAnd so project managers have to work very\nclosely with functional managers to get\n\n851\n00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,580\nthings done.\n\n852\n00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,280\nBecause if a project manager gets mad\nat an employee they can't fire them.\n\n853\n00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,520\nIt's not their employee.\n\n854\n00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,670\nThey have to go and\ntalk to the functional manager, and say\n\n855\n00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,720\nthis employee is not living up to their\nresponsibility inside of the project.\n\n856\n00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,650\nAnd it's the functional manager\nthat actually has authority.\n\n857\n00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,350\nThat's one of the biggest challenges\nwith being a project manager,\n\n858\n00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:30,010\nis that while you have manager in your\nname, you're managing the project not\n\n859\n00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:35,870\nnecessarily the direct report or\nwhatever for any of the employees.\n\n860\n00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,292\nSo you don't necessarily have hire and\nfire responsibilities which is-\n\n861\n00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:41,380\n>> Challenging.\n\n862\n00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:45,160\n>> And in employee views that\nusually would mean authority.\n\n863\n00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,320\nSo that's a big deal.\n\n864\n00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,270\nIf you have a PMO,\nif you are fully projectized,\n\n865\n00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,090\nyour project managers\nhave a lot of authority.\n\n866\n00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,670\nIf you're not projectized,\nif it's a functional organization,\n\n867\n00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,230\nbusinesses have a lot\nof ongoing activities.\n\n868\n00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,390\nThen you have the same\nauthority as your sponsor.\n\n869\n00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:05,663\nThe higher up in the tree your sponsor is,\nthe more authority you have.\n\n870\n00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,260\nSo when it comes to these projects,\n\n871\n00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,660\nI mentioned how a PMO is going\nto evaluate the projects and\n\n872\n00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,440\npick which ones are the most beneficial,\nright?\n\n873\n00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,610\nPMI refers to this as business value.\n\n874\n00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,400\nEvery project has to have some\nkind of a business value.\n\n875\n00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,850\nIn IT, we have a unique perspective in\nIT because in other industries, like in\n\n876\n00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,550\nconstruction, if you have a project to\nbuild a house, you're gonna build this\n\n877\n00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:38,240\nhouse and then you're gonna sell it for\nmore money than the house costs.\n\n878\n00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,450\nSo your project actually makes money and\nthat's how most projects are.\n\n879\n00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,982\nIn IT, that's almost never the case,\nright?\n\n880\n00:45:45,982 --> 00:45:46,690\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n881\n00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,520\n>> Most of our projects in IT\n\n882\n00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,190\ncost money without generating it.\n\n883\n00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:56,370\nSo a great example would be,\none of the bigger projects I worked on,\n\n884\n00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:01,060\nI worked for a bank and\nwe had 90 branches across four states.\n\n885\n00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:06,220\nAnd the project was a complete\nnetwork infrastructure redesign.\n\n886\n00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,760\nWe replaced every router,\nevery switch, every firewall, and\n\n887\n00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,460\nevery communication line.\n\n888\n00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,890\nEvery data line that was run to newer\nupdated hardware and faster lines.\n\n889\n00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,310\nCompletely redesigned the network,\nit was a multi-million dollar project.\n\n890\n00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,720\nAnd during the life of that project,\nwe spent some money.\n\n891\n00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,860\nWe spent several million dollars.\n\n892\n00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,070\nNew equipment, new lines, and all that.\n\n893\n00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:33,310\nDid our bank sell more mortgages\nbecause we had better firewalls?\n\n894\n00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,220\nNo.\n\n895\n00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,090\nDid our bank get more\ncertified deposits because\n\n896\n00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,800\nour switches were layer three\ninstead of just layer two?\n\n897\n00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,130\nNo.\n\n898\n00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:48,040\nSo, where we saw earnings,\nwe didn't, right.\n\n899\n00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,110\nBut, we did save money.\n\n900\n00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,920\nOur data lines became less expensive, so\n\n901\n00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,870\nwe started getting returns every\nmonth as far as our Telco bills, and\n\n902\n00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:59,600\nthen the stability of the network\nallowed employees to get more work done.\n\n903\n00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,940\nThey didn't have outages\nlike they used to and so\n\n904\n00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,020\nthat stability led to\nperformance improvements.\n\n905\n00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,620\nNot necessarily monetary improvements,\nand may take a while,\n\n906\n00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,640\nmay take five years, seven years, for\nthat investment to pay itself off.\n\n907\n00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,120\nBut it was the right thing to do to have\nthe right infrastructure available to\n\n908\n00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,980\nperform that service.\n\n909\n00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,800\nIn IT, our projects are typically viewed\nas what are what are called cost centers.\n\n910\n00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,750\nAnd that means they don't generate\nrevenue, they cost money.\n\n911\n00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,830\nAnd then it's other things\nthat offset that cost so,\n\n912\n00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,820\ncan we sell more mortgages as\na result of having new firewall?\n\n913\n00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,632\nYes.\nDid the new firewalls make us money?\n\n914\n00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:37,010\nNot necessarily.\n\n915\n00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:40,300\nSo that's something we\nhave to keep in mind.\n\n916\n00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,870\nSo, for a PMO,\nthey've gotta look at your project and\n\n917\n00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,850\nthey've gotta figure out,\ndoes it have a business value?\n\n918\n00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:49,200\nDoes it add something to our organization?\n\n919\n00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,100\nDoes it improve our ability to make money?\n\n920\n00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,445\nOr does it help to make us more stable,\nright?\n\n921\n00:47:54,445 --> 00:47:55,966\nA great example of that,\ndisaster recovery.\n\n922\n00:47:55,966 --> 00:47:59,866\nYou might have a project to create\na redundant data center for\n\n923\n00:47:59,866 --> 00:48:01,251\nyour organization.\n\n924\n00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:05,428\nIf your main data center fails,\nearthquake, hurricane, power outage,\n\n925\n00:48:05,428 --> 00:48:06,104\nwhatever.\n\n926\n00:48:06,104 --> 00:48:09,715\nHaving another data center that can kick\nin and take over, avoids that down time.\n\n927\n00:48:09,715 --> 00:48:12,631\nThat data center is gonna\ncost you a lot of money, and\n\n928\n00:48:12,631 --> 00:48:16,030\nif you never have a disaster,\nyou never recoup that money.\n\n929\n00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:16,800\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n930\n00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:23,060\nIf I have a $5 million disaster recovery\nfacility, and I never have a disaster.\n\n931\n00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,140\nIt's 5 million that I wasted.\n\n932\n00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,060\n>> Right.\n\n933\n00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,950\nBut the instant I have an earthquake and\n\n934\n00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:32,870\nthe main data center goes offline that\n$5 million data center kicks in, and\n\n935\n00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:37,370\nfor every minute that it's in business\nit's paying itself off, right.\n\n936\n00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,950\nBut does that mean that\nwe shouldn't do that?\n\n937\n00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,610\nNo, how much money would we lose by\nhaving that data center offline?\n\n938\n00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:48,827\nI read this article about how Amazon,\nif Amazon were to you know Amazon dot com\n\n939\n00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:54,124\nonline shopping company retail whatever\nif their website went down they would\n\n940\n00:48:54,124 --> 00:48:59,259\nlose over a million dollars per hour if\ntheir website went down so does it make\n\n941\n00:48:59,259 --> 00:49:04,746\nsense for them to have a redundant data\ncenter if it costs them a million dollars.\n\n942\n00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:08,670\nAbsolutely cuz for every hour they're down\nit's costing them that much It makes sense\n\n943\n00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:11,810\nto spend that kind of money to\ncreate that infrastructure.\n\n944\n00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,630\nDefinitely something that needs to\nbe evaluated for every project.\n\n945\n00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:18,110\n>> Yeah, it's hard to see the actual\nvalue of it in terms of business.\n\n946\n00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,030\nUntil you realize the efficiency\nthat some of the things generate.\n\n947\n00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,020\nLike for example,\nour business at one point.\n\n948\n00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,370\nWe were just using regular\nTelephone lines, but\n\n949\n00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,210\nthen we switched to a VoIP system.\n\n950\n00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,570\nAnd by doing that, even though they\nactually had some up front costs,\n\n951\n00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:35,670\nit really did end up making it better\nproduction, we got a lot more features for\n\n952\n00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:36,380\nwhat we actually had,\n\n953\n00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,810\nand we were able to actually control\nour phone system a lot better.\n\n954\n00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,060\nI did offer some business value\nthat we thought was worth it.\n\n955\n00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:47,570\n>> Later on, we're gonna talk about cost\nbenefit analysis and feasibility analysis\n\n956\n00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:52,240\nor analyses, however you want to say\nit where you make that judgement.\n\n957\n00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:52,840\nIs it worth it?\n\n958\n00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,770\nHow long will it take to pay if off?\n\n959\n00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,320\nIs it something that makes sense?\n\n960\n00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,600\n>> Right.\n>> And so we'll get a chance to see\n\n961\n00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,450\nthat later on.\n\n962\n00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,690\nAll right,\nnow I mentioned stakeholders earlier.\n\n963\n00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:06,800\nA stakeholder, is anybody with\na vested interest in the project,\n\n964\n00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,330\nright anybody that the project influences.\n\n965\n00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,430\nA stakeholder doesn't necessarily\ninfluence the project.\n\n966\n00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:15,680\nBut the project definitely\ninfluences the stakeholder.\n\n967\n00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,400\nI've mentioned two important\nstakeholders already.\n\n968\n00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,180\nThe project sponsor, the person who\ncame up with the idea for the project,\n\n969\n00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,640\nthe person who's authority is\nallowing that project to be.\n\n970\n00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,500\nThat's the sponsor, and\nthey're the primary stakeholder.\n\n971\n00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,250\nAll right?\n\n972\n00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:32,570\nThe project manager is also a stakeholder.\n\n973\n00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,590\nThey have a vested interest\nin the project succeeding,\n\n974\n00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:37,690\ncuz if it fails, they probably get fired.\n\n975\n00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:38,870\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is true.\n\n976\n00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,560\n>> Nobody likes the project manager\nwhen the project goes over budget.\n\n977\n00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,300\nThose are two stakeholders, two people who\nhave a vested interest in the project.\n\n978\n00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:53,070\nBut there are tons of other\npeople who are stakeholders.\n\n979\n00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:56,230\nThe PMI specifically calls\nout functional stakeholders,\n\n980\n00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:59,100\norganizational stakeholders,\noperational stakeholders.\n\n981\n00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,280\nThese are really all names for\nthe same thing.\n\n982\n00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,340\nIf I have a project, let me use\nthe insurance company as an example.\n\n983\n00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,410\nWe had this project to roll out new\nclaims processing software, all right.\n\n984\n00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,600\nIt was an IT department project.\n\n985\n00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,910\nThe IT department had to set up\nthe servers, had to install the software,\n\n986\n00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:20,170\nhad to configure the databases,\nhad to set up backups and restore plans.\n\n987\n00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:20,920\nThat was the project.\n\n988\n00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,540\nIt was an IT department project.\n\n989\n00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,110\nBut the software, was for\nclaims processing, and so\n\n990\n00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:30,860\nthe entire claims department was\ngonna have to use this software.\n\n991\n00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,030\nThey had to learn how to use the software.\n\n992\n00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,570\nThey had to understand how it operated.\n\n993\n00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:37,840\nThey had to come up with work flows for\nhow a claim would be processed.\n\n994\n00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,470\nThat was stuff that the IT\ndepartment didn't know.\n\n995\n00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:43,240\nWhile the IT department\nwas doing all the work,\n\n996\n00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,490\nthe claims department was directly\ninfluenced by that project.\n\n997\n00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,320\nThis is new software that\nthey were gonna have to use.\n\n998\n00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,890\nThe entire claims department becomes\na stakeholder in the project.\n\n999\n00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,940\nNow, you don't want every claims agent\nto be a part of your project, so\n\n1000\n00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:03,320\nusually it's the head of that department\nor if they have some mid level managers or\n\n1001\n00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,030\nwhatever they become\na part of the project.\n\n1002\n00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:09,070\nSo that they can provide feedback and\ninfluence as the project progresses.\n\n1003\n00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:13,050\nYou want to get that, you want that\nfeedback, cuz what you don't want\n\n1004\n00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,370\nis to roll out this software and\nthen the claims department hates it,\n\n1005\n00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:20,930\nwon't use it, and then you've got to roll\nback the project, it was waste of time.\n\n1006\n00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:25,940\nYou want to get their feedback and input\nand the earlier you get it, the better.\n\n1007\n00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,300\nYou'll find it, as time goes on,\n\n1008\n00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,890\nthat the earlier a change occurs in\na project, the less expensive it is.\n\n1009\n00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:36,540\nBut the further down the road you are,\nchange becomes really expensive.\n\n1010\n00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,170\nAnd we'll see an example\nof that a little bit later.\n\n1011\n00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:42,540\nAll right, so\nstakeholders are pretty important,\n\n1012\n00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:46,850\njust remember that the entire\nproject team, they're stakeholders.\n\n1013\n00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,880\nBut then there's other people who\naren't on the project team who are also\n\n1014\n00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,380\nstakeholders like the sponsor.\n\n1015\n00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,290\nAnd just like any other employee\nthat might be affected by\n\n1016\n00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:59,130\nwhat that project is producing.\n\n1017\n00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,160\nWell Ronnie we need to talk a little\nbit more about terminology as far as\n\n1018\n00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,640\nthe project manager themselves, but\n\n1019\n00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,354\nlooking at the clock it's a pretty good\n>> Oh yup\n\n1020\n00:53:06,354 --> 00:53:07,213\n>> Spot to stop for a break\n\n1021\n00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:08,050\n>> Sure enough\n\n1022\n00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:08,830\n>> Why don't we stop here and\n\n1023\n00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,650\ntake a break when we get back\nwe got a little more terminology\n\n1024\n00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,513\nbefore we move into something\na little more interesting.\n\n1025\n00:53:14,513 --> 00:53:17,445\n>> Yup\n>> All right stay tuned we'll be back in\n\n1026\n00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:17,970\na few.\n\n1027\n00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:24,877\n[MUSIC]\n\n1028\n00:53:24,877 --> 00:53:26,350\nWelcome back.\n\n1029\n00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:31,040\nWe talked about some of the different\nconcepts as far as like project team and\n\n1030\n00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,880\nthe project team members and staff.\n\n1031\n00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,140\nLet's talk a little bit about\nthe project manager themselves.\n\n1032\n00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,350\nAs the project manager\nobviously your primary goal,\n\n1033\n00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,000\nis making sure that any\nproject that you manage.\n\n1034\n00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,260\nCompletes successfully.\n\n1035\n00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,190\nAnd by successfully I mean that\nit meets three requirements.\n\n1036\n00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,690\nEvery project has three constraints or\n\n1037\n00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:55,480\nboundaries, you have cost,\nwhich is your budget.\n\n1038\n00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,290\nHow much money you can spend.\n\n1039\n00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:01,660\nYou have time, which is your\nschedule when you need to finish by.\n\n1040\n00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:06,030\nAnd then you have your quality,\nwhich is really your requirements list.\n\n1041\n00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,170\nDid you meet all of\nthe requirements of the project?\n\n1042\n00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:12,080\nIf you met all three of those,\nthen your project is a success.\n\n1043\n00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,860\nBut if you failed any one of those,\nthen your project is a failure.\n\n1044\n00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,680\nIt's just very black and white, cut and\n\n1045\n00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,370\ndry whether your project is successful or\na failure.\n\n1046\n00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:26,930\nWe're gonna talk about those three things\nrepeatedly throughout the show, but.\n\n1047\n00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:33,860\nFocusing just on project success\nis not the way to success.\n\n1048\n00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:40,920\nA project manager can drive a project team\ntoo hard trying to succeed on a project\n\n1049\n00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,672\nand push people beyond their limits,\nthus leading to project failure also.\n\n1050\n00:54:44,672 --> 00:54:49,330\nSo calls out three specific\ncharacteristics we need to be aware of\n\n1051\n00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,110\nas a project manager.\n\n1052\n00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:55,660\nAnd they are knowledge,\nperformance and personal skills.\n\n1053\n00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,660\nAll right?\n\n1054\n00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,280\nKnowledge is the first one.\n\n1055\n00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:03,370\nif you say you're a project manager,\nyou need to know how to manage projects.\n\n1056\n00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:07,000\nYou need to have that knowledge to\nunderstand, how to recognize when\n\n1057\n00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,150\na project is slipping, how to correct\nto get the project back on track,\n\n1058\n00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:14,240\nhow to properly plan,\nhow to evaluate risk,\n\n1059\n00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,630\nhow to do all the various activities\na project manager needs to.\n\n1060\n00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:19,660\nAnd if you don't know\nhow to do any of those,\n\n1061\n00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,840\nyou need to be committed to learning them,\nright?\n\n1062\n00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,050\nYou should constantly be\nimproving you skill set,\n\n1063\n00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:26,970\nthat's why the PMP has a continuing\neducation requirement.\n\n1064\n00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,520\nKnowledge is a big deal.\n\n1065\n00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,060\nThe second one is performance.\n\n1066\n00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,460\nYou need to perform at\nthe highest levels possible.\n\n1067\n00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,990\nYou need to be doing all that you\ncan to help a project succeed.\n\n1068\n00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:44,160\nI used to work with a project\nmanager years ago, and there was\n\n1069\n00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,300\nthis one project in particular, and\nRonnie you might actually remember this.\n\n1070\n00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,356\nYou were there.\nWhere things were going wrong,\n\n1071\n00:55:49,356 --> 00:55:54,314\nthere was a very goo possibility for the\nproject to fail and the project manager\n\n1072\n00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:59,049\nat the time said you know what, I told\nthem this would happen and I knew it was\n\n1073\n00:55:59,049 --> 00:56:04,085\ngonna happen and you know what I'm just\ngonna let it happen I'm just gonna let it\n\n1074\n00:56:04,085 --> 00:56:09,149\nfail you know I told them so Well,\nyou know what, you're the project manager.\n\n1075\n00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:09,845\nMake it happen.\n\n1076\n00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:11,990\nFix it, get it back online.\n\n1077\n00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:16,160\nMake sure people are aware, if you take\nthat attitude of, it's not my fault!\n\n1078\n00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,410\nWell, you're the project manager,\neverything is your fault.\n\n1079\n00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,430\nIt stinks, but that's how it is.\n\n1080\n00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:23,850\nIf the project fails, it is your fault.\n\n1081\n00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:27,590\nYou're a project manager, you've got\nto find a way to bring things in line.\n\n1082\n00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:32,650\nIf you plan properly from the beginning,\nthen it's very difficult for\n\n1083\n00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,580\nthe project to fail.\n\n1084\n00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:38,474\nUsually project failure stems from poor\nplanning, or bad personal judgment.\n\n1085\n00:56:38,474 --> 00:56:40,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's a few things there.\n\n1086\n00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,290\nAnd then the last thing\nis personal skills.\n\n1087\n00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:48,790\nA project manager may or may not\nactually have authority over employees.\n\n1088\n00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,940\nYou may not have hire\nfire responsibilities,\n\n1089\n00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,660\nyou might not even have\nwrite up responsibilities.\n\n1090\n00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,185\nYou might simply be in charge\nof the project itself and\n\n1091\n00:56:56,185 --> 00:56:57,595\nnot necessarily the people.\n\n1092\n00:56:57,595 --> 00:57:02,067\nThat means that you're going to be reliant\non your personal skills to be able to\n\n1093\n00:57:02,067 --> 00:57:04,248\nnegotiate getting activities done.\n\n1094\n00:57:04,248 --> 00:57:05,537\nThis is the hardest part for IT guys,\n\n1095\n00:57:05,537 --> 00:57:07,337\nright, because personal\nis the last thing we are.\n\n1096\n00:57:07,337 --> 00:57:14,277\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1097\n00:57:14,277 --> 00:57:19,027\nFor us, it requires us then to be actually\npeople that are interpersonal as well.\n\n1098\n00:57:19,027 --> 00:57:22,577\nAnd that actually requires us to have\na lot of good skills to make sure that we\n\n1099\n00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:24,637\ncan accomplish what we need to.\n\n1100\n00:57:24,637 --> 00:57:29,257\nBecause we may lack the actual authority\nto do what we need, they do rely on you as\n\n1101\n00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:33,820\na project manager to move things forward,\nand that means that you\n\n1102\n00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,760\nare actually not only the idea that the\nperson that has the knowledge to do it,\n\n1103\n00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,970\nnot only are they able to perform, but\nyou have to be the one that motivates.\n\n1104\n00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:45,070\nYou have to be the one that can\nactually carry them, to tell them,\n\n1105\n00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,670\nespecially when there's\na long project ahead of them.\n\n1106\n00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,680\nAnd there are many ups and downs.\n\n1107\n00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,570\nAs a project manager,\n\n1108\n00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,637\nit's incumbant upon us to actually develop\nsome of these interpersonal skills.\n\n1109\n00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,367\n>> All right,.\n>> Yes.\n\n1110\n00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:56,170\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've got the official PMI list.\n\n1111\n00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,390\nI made some notes during the break.\n\n1112\n00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:59,510\nLet's take a look at these.\n\n1113\n00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,690\nThese are all very important.\n\n1114\n00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,310\nyou'll see.\n\n1115\n00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,640\nRonnie, you mentioned leadership, right?\n\n1116\n00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,480\n>> Right.\n\n1117\n00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,070\n>> Lead by example.\n\n1118\n00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:08,420\nIf you're doing a poor job.\n\n1119\n00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,500\nIf you're not committed,\nyou don't care, neither is your team.\n\n1120\n00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,740\nThey're not gonna care either.\n\n1121\n00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:18,340\nYou've got to make sure that you\nare always exercising good leadership.\n\n1122\n00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:22,470\nTeam building, when you start a project,\nyou're getting people from all over\n\n1123\n00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:26,030\nthe company, in many cases,\npeople who have never even met before.\n\n1124\n00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:30,988\nTo get them working the best,\nyou need to have a good team mentality.\n\n1125\n00:58:30,988 --> 00:58:34,550\nAnd we're gonna talk about some of\nthe team building processes later on,\n\n1126\n00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,100\nthe whole storming, norming,\nperforming, and all that good stuff.\n\n1127\n00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,510\nWe'll get a chance to see those.\n\n1128\n00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:44,000\nBut this is another key aspect and\nreally one of the more important ones for\n\n1129\n00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,360\na project manager.\n\n1130\n00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,550\n>> Same thing goes true with\nthe idea of motivation.\n\n1131\n00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:48,220\nAll right?\n\n1132\n00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:52,350\nThere's a lot of times where\nyou're presented with the idea and\n\n1133\n00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:56,860\nyou think, it's not gonna be so great,\nbut it does take someone to come in and\n\n1134\n00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:01,330\nshow you, not only the value but\nthe idea of getting behind it and\n\n1135\n00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,290\nwhy you wanna do this and\nwhat ends up happening here.\n\n1136\n00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:09,280\nThe great thing is we actually work with\nsomebody that's really motivational,\n\n1137\n00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,490\nhe says do it or your fired.\n\n1138\n00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,160\nBut very positive and\nalways brings in different books and\n\n1139\n00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,180\ndifferent aspects of you better watch\nthis, cuz it's really gonna motivate you.\n\n1140\n00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,430\nAnd again, that gets you on-board and\nthat's what you want.\n\n1141\n00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,590\nYou want everybody to be on-board,\nto understand why this needs to be done.\n\n1142\n00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,910\nMotivation's an important factor for us.\n\n1143\n00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:30,900\n>> Communication is another\none that's a big deal,\n\n1144\n00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,380\nwhat you'll find, especially here\nwith the PMP, we're gonna show you\n\n1145\n00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,160\nhow the official ways of collecting\ndata and representing that data.\n\n1146\n00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,530\n>> Yeah.\nWe are gonna to see things like Pareto\n\n1147\n00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:45,940\ncharts and stuff like that, that as\na project manager, we're used to it.\n\n1148\n00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:50,157\nWe see that stuff,\nwe work with it, find gun charts.\n\n1149\n00:59:50,157 --> 00:59:52,100\nWe live and die off of gun charts.\n\n1150\n00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:56,660\nBut outside of the project management\nworld, people don't use gun charts.\n\n1151\n00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,440\nPeople don't use diagrams.\n\n1152\n00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,650\nThey just don't see it,\n\n1153\n00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:03,120\nfishbone diagram, those are ones you just\ndon't see outside of project management.\n\n1154\n01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,980\nWe need a way to take our project\nmanagement status and update information\n\n1155\n01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,180\nand properly communicate that to\npeople in a way that they understand.\n\n1156\n01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,530\nAnd when we're receiving information from\npeople, we need to be able to communicate\n\n1157\n01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,950\nto ask the right questions to\nget the information we need.\n\n1158\n01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:24,420\nThe more information we have,\nthe better our odds of success.\n\n1159\n01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,470\n>> And this communication skill\ngoes beyond the idea of just\n\n1160\n01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:30,570\norally communicating as well as\nto good written communications.\n\n1161\n01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,700\n>> And interpretive dance?\n\n1162\n01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,105\n>> And interpretive dance, of course.\n\n1163\n01:00:33,105 --> 01:00:34,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is an important,\n\n1164\n01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:37,330\nI think with fans I\nthink is what's needed.\n\n1165\n01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:41,050\n>> When you said it goes beyond oral\ncommunication immediately my mind went to.\n\n1166\n01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:45,230\nTo that movie Blades of Glory where\nthey're doing the ice skating and\n\n1167\n01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:46,295\nthe bird costume.\n\n1168\n01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:49,909\n[LAUGH] Oh, all right, so\nmaybe not interpretive dance.\n\n1169\n01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:51,959\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n1170\n01:00:51,959 --> 01:00:54,000\nwe also got influencing.\n\n1171\n01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n1172\n01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:59,220\n>> If you do not have direct authority,\nif you do not have hire and\n\n1173\n01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,780\nfire responsibilities,\nif your project sponsor is the CEO,\n\n1174\n01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:06,230\nyou're not gonna have\nauthority over these people.\n\n1175\n01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,115\nYou cannot tell them.\n\n1176\n01:01:07,115 --> 01:01:08,445\nThem what to do.\n\n1177\n01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:10,065\nBut you can influence them.\n\n1178\n01:01:10,065 --> 01:01:11,305\nAnd that's one of the things.\n\n1179\n01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:16,405\nIf we can sit down with somebody,\nexplain our side, get them to understand,\n\n1180\n01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:20,285\nwe can influence them to make the\ndecisions that we recognize as necessary.\n\n1181\n01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:25,990\nInfluencing is a key aspect of any\nkind of project management role.\n\n1182\n01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,090\n>> The idea of decision making here,\n\n1183\n01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:32,360\nI'll tell you how good of\na decision maker I am.\n\n1184\n01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,660\nEvery day if Nate comes in to ask\nif I've brought lunch or not and\n\n1185\n01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,255\nI say no I wanna go somewhere.\n\n1186\n01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:39,080\nBoth of us just say where do you wanna go.\n\n1187\n01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,910\nWe don't have a clue, on what decision\nwe want to make at that point.\n\n1188\n01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:44,460\nBut know as a project manager,\n\n1189\n01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,890\nthe decision that you make\nis dependent upon you.\n\n1190\n01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:50,164\nMaking a good decision,\n\n1191\n01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:53,630\nan informed decision is something\nthat you have to be willing to do.\n\n1192\n01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,319\nOkay not being willing to take the risk,\nis not something that a project manager\n\n1193\n01:01:57,319 --> 01:02:00,293\nshould not be willing to do they\nagain should again go through and\n\n1194\n01:02:00,293 --> 01:02:02,604\nmake sure that they take\na look at everything, and\n\n1195\n01:02:02,604 --> 01:02:05,772\nthen make a decision that needs to\nbe made and be able to live with it.\n\n1196\n01:02:05,772 --> 01:02:09,431\n>> One my early mentors\na gentleman that I worked for for\n\n1197\n01:02:09,431 --> 01:02:12,020\nseveral years he taught me a lesson.\n\n1198\n01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,425\nHe said,\ndecision making is all about timing.\n\n1199\n01:02:16,425 --> 01:02:19,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That if you wanna have\n\n1200\n01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:23,850\nall of the information necessary to make a\ndecision, you'll wait forever to make it.\n\n1201\n01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:26,310\nThe decision.\nYou'll stall and stall and stall.\n\n1202\n01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,830\nAnd stalling, in a way,\nis its own decision.\n\n1203\n01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,820\nYou've decided to do nothing.\n\n1204\n01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,960\nWhat he always said was the art\nto decision-making is recognizing\n\n1205\n01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,540\nwhen you've got enough\ninformation to make a decision.\n\n1206\n01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:42,730\nAnd he said there comes a point,\nwhere you need to make a decision and\n\n1207\n01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,920\nmove on, right?\n\n1208\n01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,620\nRight or wrong, just make a decision.\n\n1209\n01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,260\nIf it's the right, great.\n\n1210\n01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,770\nYou acted you move forward.\n\n1211\n01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:53,150\nIf it's the wrong decision,\nby making it early,\n\n1212\n01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,440\nyou'll likely have time to correct for it.\n\n1213\n01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,870\nVersus if you had waited, and waited, and\nwaited and then made the wrong decision.\n\n1214\n01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,840\nYou might not be able to correct for it.\n\n1215\n01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:06,700\nMake a decision, any gray areas going into\na project are room for failure, right?\n\n1216\n01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,830\nYou wanna have well defined boundaries and\nthat really does require decision making.\n\n1217\n01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,060\nYou also have to have ownership\nof that decision, right?\n\n1218\n01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,710\n>> Right.\n>> Take responsibility.\n\n1219\n01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:17,860\nIf a decision turns out bad,\nyou need to show, and\n\n1220\n01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,000\nwe'll talk about this in some of the very\nlast episodes when we do closing.\n\n1221\n01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,180\nYou need to show why\nyou made that decision.\n\n1222\n01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,360\nWhat was the information you had,\nwhat was the information you didn't have.\n\n1223\n01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:33,280\nAnd often times the information you\ndidn't have just wasn't available, and so\n\n1224\n01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,270\nit's not that you, bad decision, you made\nthe best decision with the information\n\n1225\n01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:41,270\nthat was available at the time, so\nunderstanding that, taking ownership,\n\n1226\n01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,690\ntaking responsibility\nof that is important.\n\n1227\n01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:46,994\nAll right.\nAlso, political and cultural awareness.\n\n1228\n01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:51,853\nNow, this is not a specific\nrequirement of project management, but\n\n1229\n01:03:51,853 --> 01:03:56,796\nPMI is very proactive and progressive,\nabout ensuring that all of our\n\n1230\n01:03:56,796 --> 01:04:02,160\nprojects are multi-cultural, that we\nare aware of the various influences\n\n1231\n01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,894\nthat people have inside of the project,\nas well as being diverse.\n\n1232\n01:04:06,894 --> 01:04:09,546\nWe need to understand\nthat in today's world,\n\n1233\n01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:13,151\nproject teams May not all be in\none building working together.\n\n1234\n01:04:13,151 --> 01:04:17,639\nThey might be spread all across the earth\nand you'll have different religions,\n\n1235\n01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:21,580\ndifferent cultures, different holidays,\ndifferent calendars.\n\n1236\n01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:24,290\nAll sorts of different things like\nthat that we need to coordinate.\n\n1237\n01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:26,130\nWe need to understand the political and\n\n1238\n01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:31,100\ncultural environment that surrounds our\nproject and act appropriately within it.\n\n1239\n01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,010\nAnd that's a very important thing not\njust for project manager but really for\n\n1240\n01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,154\nanybody these days.\n\n1241\n01:04:35,154 --> 01:04:36,900\n>> Yeah.\nA lot of this you might go\n\n1242\n01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,210\nwhy does it really influence us?\n\n1243\n01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:41,330\nWell when it comes down to planning\nespecially on those religious or\n\n1244\n01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,050\ncultural holiday.\n\n1245\n01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:45,150\nYou've got to actually remember some\nof this stuff as your project begins to\n\n1246\n01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,000\nmove forward.\n\n1247\n01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,540\nAnd again sensitivity to that is\npretty much a key for us as well.\n\n1248\n01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,340\n>> Next on our list is negotiation.\n\n1249\n01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,910\nIn small and medium companies\nit is not uncommon at all for\n\n1250\n01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:59,920\na project manager to be\nthe one negotiating contracts.\n\n1251\n01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,200\nSo when you're establishing\nvendors to perform work or\n\n1252\n01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,280\nsetting up long term agreements or\nwhatever.\n\n1253\n01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,150\nAs a project manager you\nmight need to negotiate.\n\n1254\n01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:10,240\nYou're negotiating a price for a service.\n\n1255\n01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,250\nRight?\nSo a price for getting something done.\n\n1256\n01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,490\nOr maybe materials,\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n1257\n01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:19,330\nIn large organizations, they will\ntypically have professional negotiators.\n\n1258\n01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,800\n>> Right.\n>> Now, I don't mean the cool SWAT\n\n1259\n01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,352\nteam negotiator.\n\n1260\n01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:24,082\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's talking the guy\n\n1261\n01:05:24,082 --> 01:05:25,640\ndown from the building.\n\n1262\n01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,430\nAt the bank we had a negotiator,\nshe was awesome.\n\n1263\n01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:32,190\nShe was this little soft\nspoken Asian women, she was so\n\n1264\n01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:34,390\nnice when you would talk\nto her in the hallway.\n\n1265\n01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:37,170\nBut if you heard her on\nthe phone with somebody, boy,\n\n1266\n01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:39,760\nI mean I would not want to be\non the other end of that call.\n\n1267\n01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,875\nShe could negotiate and just get\nthe price down on Downy or anything.\n\n1268\n01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:46,960\n>> Yeah.\n>> And she does a great job\n\n1269\n01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,670\nof making sure that our company\ndidn't spend too much for\n\n1270\n01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:54,110\nwhat we were getting done and then we were\nalways getting the best price possible.\n\n1271\n01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,720\nThat was her job,\nshe was really good at it,\n\n1272\n01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,230\nshe was way better than I would ever\nbe and so it was nice to have her.\n\n1273\n01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:02,580\nIf I ever needed something like that,\nI sent it on over to her.\n\n1274\n01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:06,550\nBut in small and medium organizations\nyou're not likely to have a staff\n\n1275\n01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,470\nnegotiator or a contract specialist\nof whatever you want to call them.\n\n1276\n01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,400\nSo in that case it's you, and\n\n1277\n01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,340\nyou need to make sure that you\nhave good negotiation skills.\n\n1278\n01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,370\nYou need to understand,\nwe'll talk again more on this later.\n\n1279\n01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:22,820\nBut you need to understand that when\nyou beat somebody down on price,\n\n1280\n01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,120\nif you make it so\nit's no longer profitable for\n\n1281\n01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,450\nthem, they're not gonna\ngive you their best effort.\n\n1282\n01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,640\nSo, one of the skills of being\na negotiator is making sure you\n\n1283\n01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,330\nestablish a nice middle ground.\n\n1284\n01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:32,970\nRight?\n\n1285\n01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:37,500\nIf your project sponsor has a list of\nrequirements that are unrealistic,\n\n1286\n01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,560\nyou need to negotiate to get those\nrequirements down to something\n\n1287\n01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,110\nthat is realistic and achievable.\n\n1288\n01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:42,660\nRight?\n\n1289\n01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,560\nSo that's part of negotiations,\nanytime you interact.\n\n1290\n01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:50,080\nBut we also use that with conflict\nmanagement, which is down two more.\n\n1291\n01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,920\nWhen you have multiple parties that are\npart of project and they are in conflict,\n\n1292\n01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,050\nnegotiation is one of the methods for\nresolving that conflict.\n\n1293\n01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,300\nThere is actually a total of\nfive methods on the exam.\n\n1294\n01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,240\nBut negotiation is one of them.\n\n1295\n01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,420\nYeah.\n\n1296\n01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,440\n>> So\nthe last two really go together as well,\n\n1297\n01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,480\nthe idea of coaching as well\nas trust building here,\n\n1298\n01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,420\nis again bringing everything together\nin the way that it needs to be.\n\n1299\n01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:16,220\nA lot of times with the coaching of\ncourse, if your team members do not have\n\n1300\n01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,210\nthe actual clear path to get through,\nyou as a coach,\n\n1301\n01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:22,550\nthat is your role at that particular point\nin helping them to be able to do that.\n\n1302\n01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:26,450\nBuilding trust actually inspires the rest\nof the team of course, To know that hey,\n\n1303\n01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:29,670\nthe rest of the team has taken care\nof you, you're taking care of them.\n\n1304\n01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,910\nSo everything is actually good and\n\n1305\n01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:33,130\nthat we're going to accomplish\nthis project together.\n\n1306\n01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:39,100\nSo having all these skills combined\nis the main focus of what you\n\n1307\n01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,650\nneed interpersonally, because if you think\nabout your project management skills.\n\n1308\n01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:46,010\nEven though as good as you are on paper,\n\n1309\n01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:48,410\nwhere it really shines is when\nyou've worked with people.\n\n1310\n01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:49,720\nThat's what we actually have to remember,\n\n1311\n01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,310\nis that we're really\ndealing with people here.\n\n1312\n01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:55,570\nAnd that means it actually is incumbent\nupon you as a project manager\n\n1313\n01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,640\nto have these skills in hand.\n\n1314\n01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,490\n>> And let's say I'm working a project and\nRonnie's been assigned to it and\n\n1315\n01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:04,200\nhe's just not cutting the mustard.\n\n1316\n01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,420\nHe's slouching on the job,\nnot getting a lot of work done.\n\n1317\n01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,920\nAs a project manager,\nI've got two choices.\n\n1318\n01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,640\nChoice number one,\nI can just cut Ronnie from the project.\n\n1319\n01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,760\nRight?\nTurn him back into the PMO.\n\n1320\n01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,540\nAnd what are they gonna do?\n\n1321\n01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,350\nThey're gonna assign him to some other\nproject where he'll probably do the same.\n\n1322\n01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,485\nRight?\nRonnie is a big slacker.\n\n1323\n01:08:19,485 --> 01:08:20,758\n>> Thats fine.\n\n1324\n01:08:20,758 --> 01:08:23,880\n>> So, [LAUGH] or, I could coach Ronnie.\n\n1325\n01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:28,280\nI could coach him to make sure he\nunderstands what his responsibilities are,\n\n1326\n01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,310\nwhat's expected of him.\n\n1327\n01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,275\nSome people just don't know\nwhat's expected of them.\n\n1328\n01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:31,930\n>> Right.\n>> And so,\n\n1329\n01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:34,350\nI can coach him to make\nhim a better employee.\n\n1330\n01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:36,270\nIf I just cut him from my project,\n\n1331\n01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:39,530\nall I'm doing is pawning him off on\nthe next project manager, and so,\n\n1332\n01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:42,790\nit's going to be this constant\nburden on project after project.\n\n1333\n01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:44,580\nVersus if you can coach somebody.\n\n1334\n01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,930\nMake them a better employee,\nmake them a better team member.\n\n1335\n01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:51,760\nNot only do you benefit, but the next\nproject manager and the one beyond.\n\n1336\n01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,500\nAnd if you build a rapport\nwith that person,\n\n1337\n01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,305\nmaybe you continue to have them\nas part of your project team.\n\n1338\n01:08:56,305 --> 01:08:58,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n1339\n01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:01,260\n>> Now the last thing I want to\ncall out here is not a soft skill.\n\n1340\n01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:05,130\nBut something that's very important,\nwhich is the code of ethics.\n\n1341\n01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:09,580\nThe project management institute\nhas a published code of ethics that\n\n1342\n01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:14,710\none if you're a PMI certified individual,\nif you have your PMP or CAPM or\n\n1343\n01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:19,110\nwhatever, you are required to\nfollow the PMI code of ethics.\n\n1344\n01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,346\nAll right?\nFailure to do so\n\n1345\n01:09:20,346 --> 01:09:23,444\nwill result in your work\ncertification being revoked.\n\n1346\n01:09:23,444 --> 01:09:24,008\nAll right?\n\n1347\n01:09:24,008 --> 01:09:28,473\nIf you are not a PMI certified person,\nthen you don't have to follow the code of\n\n1348\n01:09:28,473 --> 01:09:32,440\nethics, but it's on the exams, so\nyou're going to want to know it.\n\n1349\n01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,140\nBut it's also just a good idea in general.\n\n1350\n01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,260\nThe code of ethics is on their website.\n\n1351\n01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,500\nYou can download it.\n\n1352\n01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,840\nIf you go to PMI's website,\nhere I am on www.pmi.org.\n\n1353\n01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,600\nYou can go to About.\n\n1354\n01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:50,190\nAnd on the About screen,\nyou will see Read the PMI Code of Ethics.\n\n1355\n01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,950\nAnd, when we go into the code of ethics,\non the right side,\n\n1356\n01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:56,720\nyou'll see where you can download\nthe code of ethics in multiple languages.\n\n1357\n01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:57,745\nI'll do English.\n\n1358\n01:09:57,745 --> 01:10:01,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I could go crazy.\n\n1359\n01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,570\nI'll do Chinese today.\n\n1360\n01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,390\nLet's have some fun.\n\n1361\n01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,520\nSo here we go.\n\n1362\n01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:10,770\nAnd basically what it does is\nit lays out the code of ethics.\n\n1363\n01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,950\nNow the reason I highlight this here,\n\n1364\n01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:17,700\na lot of people don't realize this but\nthe code of ethics is on the exam.\n\n1365\n01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,680\nThis is testable material.\n\n1366\n01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:24,200\nSo the exam comes from the PMBOK\nas well as the code of ethics.\n\n1367\n01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,630\nNow the code of ethics,\nif you buy the physical pinbock.\n\n1368\n01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,120\nCode of ethics is actually\nin the back of the pinbock.\n\n1369\n01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,850\nSo it's kind of all in one.\n\n1370\n01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,200\nBut if you get the digital version,\nlike I have.\n\n1371\n01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,050\nYou've gotta get the digital\nversion of the code of ethics.\n\n1372\n01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:36,770\nBut it is free.\n\n1373\n01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,390\nYou just go and download it.\n\n1374\n01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,610\nIt shows who it applies to and\n\n1375\n01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:43,820\nyou'll see all PMI members as well\nas those holding a certification.\n\n1376\n01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:47,910\nAnd then basically here it gets\ninto our responsibilities.\n\n1377\n01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:48,490\nRight?\n\n1378\n01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:51,230\nWe need to make sure that we\nfollow certain standards.\n\n1379\n01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:55,440\nWe only accept assignments that\nwe have the necessary experience,\n\n1380\n01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,840\nskills, and qualifications for.\n\n1381\n01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,280\nRight?\nI had talked about that earlier,\n\n1382\n01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,250\nyou have the knowledge to\nperform that activity.\n\n1383\n01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:05,190\nThat we take actions based on\nthe best interest of society,\n\n1384\n01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:07,530\npublic safety, and the environment.\n\n1385\n01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:10,640\nAnd it goes on to list continual,\nor continuing things.\n\n1386\n01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,980\nThese are all different aspects\nthat we need to follow.\n\n1387\n01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,220\nThat we need to basically\nmake sure that we're\n\n1388\n01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,140\nacting in the best interest of\nour customer or our company.\n\n1389\n01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:23,710\nThat we avoid the appearance\nof impropriety.\n\n1390\n01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:26,130\nRight?\nThat's in here somewhere,\n\n1391\n01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:30,392\nwhich is the fancy way of saying,\none, don't do bad things.\n\n1392\n01:11:30,392 --> 01:11:32,980\n>> Right [LAUGH].\n>> And two, even if you're not,\n\n1393\n01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,440\navoid the appearance that you\nmight be doing something bad.\n\n1394\n01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,220\nAll right?\n\n1395\n01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:39,575\nSo for example as a project manager you\nmight be in charge of a project budget.\n\n1396\n01:11:39,575 --> 01:11:40,430\nAll right?\n\n1397\n01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:43,320\nSo let's say you're working\na multi million dollar project and\n\n1398\n01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,090\nyou're responsible for that budget.\n\n1399\n01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:48,790\nCould you go to the bank and cut yourself\na check for $2 million and walk out?\n\n1400\n01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:50,655\nYes, you have that authority.\n\n1401\n01:11:50,655 --> 01:11:53,010\nRight?\nSo your books,\n\n1402\n01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:55,460\nyour accounting books,\nthey're going to be monitored.\n\n1403\n01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:55,960\nRight?\n\n1404\n01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,050\nAny expenditures, any money that comes out\nof the accounts, you need to record and\n\n1405\n01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,262\nshow how it was tied to the project.\n\n1406\n01:12:01,262 --> 01:12:02,975\nAll right?\nNow, if you're not embezzling,\n\n1407\n01:12:02,975 --> 01:12:06,096\nthat's what they call it when you\nare stealing money from your company.\n\n1408\n01:12:06,096 --> 01:12:08,889\nIf you're not embezzling and\nyou've got your books,\n\n1409\n01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:10,962\nyou're keeping everything up to date.\n\n1410\n01:12:10,962 --> 01:12:14,210\nAnd an auditor comes and\nsays, let me see your books.\n\n1411\n01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:16,880\nAnd you say no,\nI don't wanna show them to you.\n\n1412\n01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,460\nAnd you stall, and you push them away, and\nyou don't let them look at your books.\n\n1413\n01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,900\nWhat are they gonna think?\n\n1414\n01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,910\nThey're gonna think, here's somebody\nwho has something to hide, right?\n\n1415\n01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:25,960\nThey must be doing something wrong.\n\n1416\n01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,220\nThey don't want me to see the books.\n\n1417\n01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:29,740\nIn reality, maybe it just means\nyou didn't update the books.\n\n1418\n01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> Maybe you're behind or whatever.\n\n1419\n01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,590\nMaybe you're running a little over budget.\n\n1420\n01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,910\nYou don't want people to know,\ncuz you're gonna correct for it later.\n\n1421\n01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:38,930\nEither way, you've created\nthe appearance of impropriety, and\n\n1422\n01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:41,940\nthat's as bad as actually\ndoing the impropriety itself.\n\n1423\n01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:47,180\nSo, we need to make sure that we always\nact in a transparent manner, that\n\n1424\n01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:52,380\nwe let people know where we're at that we\ntruly report the progress of our project.\n\n1425\n01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:56,900\nIf we're behind schedule you tell people\nyou're behind schedule, you don't try and\n\n1426\n01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,200\nhide the fact and\n\n1427\n01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,540\nmask that, these are all things that\nare apart of the code of ethics.\n\n1428\n01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:08,970\nEverything here under mandatory standards,\nare things that you must do.\n\n1429\n01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:11,720\nIf you're caught not adhering\nto any one of these.\n\n1430\n01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,390\nYou will have your certification,\nand your membership revoked.\n\n1431\n01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:18,100\nAll right,\nthere are other standards in here though,\n\n1432\n01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:22,110\nthat are not requirements,\nthat are more like guidelines.\n\n1433\n01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:23,510\nThings that you should be doing, but\n\n1434\n01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,860\nespecially that section\nwhere it says requirements.\n\n1435\n01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,840\nYou need to adhere to those.\n\n1436\n01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,450\nBut you'll see other things here,\nnegotiating good faith.\n\n1437\n01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:35,140\nIn other words,\nif you're building a house and\n\n1438\n01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:39,810\nyou need drywall installers, and your\nbrother-in-law is a drywall installer,\n\n1439\n01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:42,510\nthat you don't just automatically\ngive the bid to them, right?\n\n1440\n01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:46,810\nThat you do a bid, you get\nresponses from various contractors,\n\n1441\n01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:50,240\nand if your brother-in-law has\nthe best bid, then you pick them.\n\n1442\n01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,950\nBut, if they don't have the best bid,\nyou pick the other person, right?\n\n1443\n01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:55,990\nYou make sure that you\nnegotiate in good faith.\n\n1444\n01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:59,190\nSo, these are things\nthat are pretty standard.\n\n1445\n01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:00,345\nMost of them are common sense.\n\n1446\n01:14:00,345 --> 01:14:01,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1447\n01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,800\n>> But, it is on the exam.\n\n1448\n01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,750\nWe're not aloud to talk about what\nquestions are on the exam, but\n\n1449\n01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:09,800\nI know that I had several code of\nethics questions that were on the exam.\n\n1450\n01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,680\nAnd so it's testable material.\n\n1451\n01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,400\nThe book itself is eight pages I think,\nyeah eight pages.\n\n1452\n01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,040\nSo, it only takes a minute to read,\nit's free.\n\n1453\n01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,680\nDefinitely get it.\n\n1454\n01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,670\nIf you become a PMI member,\nthey send this to you in paper, so\n\n1455\n01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,320\nyou actually have a hand\nhelp copy you can look at.\n\n1456\n01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,740\nBut, make sure you make it part of your\nstudy materials, you need to be aware\n\n1457\n01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:33,360\nof what's in here and like I said,\nmost of it is pretty straight forward.\n\n1458\n01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,030\nThis is just appendix stuff here at\nthe end so, it's really six pages.\n\n1459\n01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:39,990\nNo reason not to read that, and\nthey should be easy questions on the exam.\n\n1460\n01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:46,400\nAll right, so code of ethics\ndefinitely an important one.\n\n1461\n01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,100\nWell, we've covered a lot of material so\nfar.\n\n1462\n01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:51,820\nWe still got more to go just in\nour general project concepts.\n\n1463\n01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,440\nBut, this is a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap up the show.\n\n1464\n01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,780\nAnd what will do is a part two,\nre-jump into the remainder of this.\n\n1465\n01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:02,740\nLet me just remind everybody,\nif you have any questions on this,\n\n1466\n01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:06,420\nlive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live,\n\n1467\n01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,530\nand you'll see the chat box\nright beneath the

00:00:39,120\nI'm your host.\n\n8\n00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,080\nDon Pezet today with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,030\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,750\n>> It is going well, today.\n\n11\n00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,400\nI am again at a loss of a Ghostbusters\nquote to return back to you.\n\n12\n00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,070\n>> No?\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n13\n00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,850\n>> I wasn't sure where\nyou were going just yet.\n\n14\n00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,710\nI thought you were going to say you got\nin a fist fight with Jay

it.\n\n17\n00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,643\n>> Are you gag ordered?\n\n18\n00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:04,178\n>> Yes.\n>> Anyhow\n\n19\n00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:04,691\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,490\n>> So this is part two to our\n\n21\n00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,910\nintroductory, beginning,\nfundamentals or whatever for\n\n22\n00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,740\nproject management professionals.\n\n23\n00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,180\nAnd we left off in the last\nepisode having talked about\n\n24\n00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,560\nsome of the things that\nare expected of a project manager.\n\n25\n00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,570\nAnd some of the general terminology that's\nused to describe the project manager,\n\n26\n00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,160\nproject manager skills,\nas well as the project team, and\n\n27\n00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,940\nsome other associated things.\n\n28\n00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,255\nA lot of terminology.\n\n29\n00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:30,780\nRight?\n\n30\n00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,640\nReal important,\nbecause that's what we see on the exam.\n\n31\n00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,430\nNow, we're going to switch\ngears a little bit,\n\n32\n00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,860\nand talk a bit about how we\nactually manage the project.\n\n33\n00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,440\nRight?\nWe talked about people before,\n\n34\n00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,420\nnow let's talk about the project itself.\n\n35\n00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,730\nOne concept that really important to\nunderstand, when you go into a project.\n\n36\n00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,500\nYou've got to sponsor the person who\ncomes up with the idea for the project.\n\n37\n00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,490\nAnd you’ve got a project manager who’s\nresponsible for making it happen.\n\n38\n00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,676\nRight?\nSo, one person dreams up the idea,\n\n39\n00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:01,290\nthe other person has to make it happen.\n\n40\n00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,800\nBut, that’s not it.\n\n41\n00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,170\nIt doesn’t stop there.\n\n42\n00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,255\nThere are a lot of people and things that\n\n43\n00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:13,055\ninfluence how that project gets done or\neven if that project gets done.\n\n44\n00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:17,450\nAnd so PMI highlights that as some\nof the organizational influences.\n\n45\n00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,140\nSo what are some of the things\nthat influence a project and\n\n46\n00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,260\nkind of change how we manage it, right?\n\n47\n00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,410\nThe way I like to think of it is,\nwhat makes my company unique?\n\n48\n00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,680\nEvery company has something that makes\nit different than the other guys\n\n49\n00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,510\nthat are out there.\n\n50\n00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,150\nSo you'll find that no two companies\nmanage projects exactly the same.\n\n51\n00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,700\nWe might have the same framework.\n\n52\n00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,610\nWe might follow the same basic guidelines.\n\n53\n00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,150\nBut there's little things that\nchange based on our company, right?\n\n54\n00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,507\nThere's an energy company here in\ntown that, very, very successful.\n\n55\n00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:51,520\nMulti-million dollar\nbusiness,been around for a while.\n\n56\n00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,370\nAnd I think they're actually in\nthe hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n57\n00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,630\nThey're a very successful organization.\n\n58\n00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,090\nAnd they have a rule that says,\n\n59\n00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,320\nno policy in the company can be bigger\nthen what fits on a post-it note.\n\n60\n00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,160\nAnd so\nwhenever they write up a company policy,\n\n61\n00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,710\nit has to be able to\nfit on a post-it note.\n\n62\n00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,950\nIf it's got more terminology then that,\n\n63\n00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,760\nthey don't do it, and\nthey're a very successful company.\n\n64\n00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,020\nBut that changes the way\nthat they do business,\n\n65\n00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,550\nright, versus,\nlet's say the United States Government.\n\n66\n00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,750\nWhere any policy they write has to be\nbigger than the encyclopedia of Britannica\n\n67\n00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,150\notherwise they won't do it.\n\n68\n00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,010\nAnd so\nthese are the things that influence us.\n\n69\n00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,420\nSo let's take a look at a few of these.\n\n70\n00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,455\nThe first one that I've got is culture and\nstyles.\n\n71\n00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:34,290\nRight?\n\n72\n00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,430\nEvery organization has\na different type of culture.\n\n73\n00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,250\nThat energy company I was mentioning.\n\n74\n00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,170\nThey try and keep a very personable,\n\n75\n00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,500\na very simple communication model\nbetween all of their employees.\n\n76\n00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,440\nThey want to be treated\nlike a giant family.\n\n77\n00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,750\nA family that has thousands of members,\nbut basically a giant family.\n\n78\n00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,860\nThat kind of culture,\nmeans that a rigid, full on paperwork\n\n79\n00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,900\nstyle beuaracratic way of managing\nprojects, is not really suitable for them.\n\n80\n00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,670\nThey're a little more of a fly by the seat\nof their pants kind of organization.\n\n81\n00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,700\nYou'll see that.\n\n82\n00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,020\nThen there's other organizations\nlike governments and\n\n83\n00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,630\nmilitary where they're very very rigid.\n\n84\n00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,900\nRight?\nJust as a matter of fact when you're in\n\n85\n00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,640\nthe military, things that you do have life\nand death consequences in a lot of cases.\n\n86\n00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,390\nSo there is no just kind of\ndo just enough to get by.\n\n87\n00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,560\nYou want to make sure that it is\ngoing to withstand the test of time.\n\n88\n00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,900\nDifferent organizations have\ndifferent cultures and styles for\n\n89\n00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,750\nhow they do business.\n\n90\n00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,870\nAnd we're seeing that in\nSilicon Valley a lot right?\n\n91\n00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,920\nThat it used to be that if you wanted to\nbe a successful IT company, look at IBM,\n\n92\n00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,800\nit was a bunch of people in suits and\nties.\n\n93\n00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,510\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n94\n00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,398\nnow you've got a kid who's been sober for\n30 minutes-\n\n95\n00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:42,073\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:42,980\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n97\n00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,974\nhe bangs out a web application and\nsells it for $2 billion tomorrow.\n\n98\n00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:46,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n99\n00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,320\n>> So companies change the way\nthat we develop things change and\n\n100\n00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,405\nevery company is unique.\n\n101\n00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:55,060\n>> Yeah, with the project manager they\nhave to be able to understand this.\n\n102\n00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,360\nThat it's going to influence them so\n\n103\n00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,860\neven if they come in from the outside\nthey've got to deal with these factors\n\n104\n00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,980\nhear particular factors here culture is\nby far one of the biggest influences.\n\n105\n00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,240\nAnd of course you have to actually\nunderstand that culture as you\n\n106\n00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,260\nmove through.\n\n107\n00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,050\nIf not, that's going to influence\nyour particular project in a way\n\n108\n00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,200\nyou don't want it to.\n\n109\n00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,610\nSo make sure you pay attention here.\n\n110\n00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,380\n>> The next thing,\nwe've got our communications.\n\n111\n00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,345\nHow does your team talk?\n\n112\n00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:18,520\nRight?\nHere at IT Pro TV,\n\n113\n00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,860\nwe are a cubicle company.\n\n114\n00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,880\nSo we've got our studio and if any\nof you have ever come by the studio,\n\n115\n00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,890\nyou're welcome to come in and see it.\n\n116\n00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,230\nIt's not that exciting.\n\n117\n00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,470\nBut we've got our studio, which makes\nup a good portion of our building.\n\n118\n00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,340\nAnd then we've got a bunch of cubicles.\n\n119\n00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,260\nSo most of the employees can\nactually hear me talking right now.\n\n120\n00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,020\nSo when it comes to us communicating and\nsharing information, we just talk.\n\n121\n00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,840\nWe might have to shout over a cubicle\nwall or whatever, and actually one or\n\n122\n00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,830\ntwo people are outside of the main room.\n\n123\n00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,010\nYou might have to walk a couple feet,\nor pick up the phone.\n\n124\n00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,180\nBut everybody's right here.\n\n125\n00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,885\nI see every employee every single day.\n\n126\n00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:54,520\nRight?\n\n127\n00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,950\nThat makes communication really easy.\n\n128\n00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,540\nWhat if you are a multi-national company,\nif you have offices all over the world?\n\n129\n00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,880\nYou don't see every employee every day.\n\n130\n00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,140\nYou might not see every\nemployee every year.\n\n131\n00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,070\nSo how do you communicate?\n\n132\n00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,930\nBy phone?\n\n133\n00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,090\nBy video conference, right?\n\n134\n00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,470\nThose types of communication\nare less personal, and\n\n135\n00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,400\ncan breed uncertainty\nin a lot of situations.\n\n136\n00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,140\nSo the way we communicate\ninfluences our project.\n\n137\n00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,140\nIf I can physically see somebody working,\n\n138\n00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,940\nI might not need a status update\nfrom them every single day.\n\n139\n00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,490\nBut if they're across the world.\n\n140\n00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,910\nIf they're in China, I can't see them.\n\n141\n00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,840\nI don't necessarily know\nwhat they're doing,\n\n142\n00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,600\nthen maybe I do need\na status update every day.\n\n143\n00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,960\nSo I know what's going on,\nwhere they're progressing.\n\n144\n00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,040\nThat's an important thing.\n\n145\n00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,690\nSo we've gotta keep that in mind.\n\n146\n00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,840\nCommunications influence\nhow your project functions.\n\n147\n00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,380\n>> There's gonna be some\norganizations again,\n\n148\n00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,610\nwhere the communication\nis relatively informal.\n\n149\n00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,720\nAnd there's some organizations where\nthe communication has to, again,\n\n150\n00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120\nbe in a certain manner.\n\n151\n00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,120\nAgain, whether it's by email or\nwhether it's a telephone call every day.\n\n152\n00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800\nWhatever it is, the process may be more\nformalized in that particular method.\n\n153\n00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,470\nSo again,\nyou have to fit in that culture as well.\n\n154\n00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,640\n>> All right, and\n\n155\n00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,660\nthen the last thing that we need to\nhighlight is the organization structure.\n\n156\n00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,875\nNow organization structure,\nI'm gonna bring up the PMBOK on this one,\n\n157\n00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,110\nbecause they have some\nreally good stuff in here.\n\n158\n00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,420\nIf I can remember what page it's on.\n\n159\n00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,860\nZoom out of it here.\n\n160\n00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,800\nThere we go.\nAll right.\n\n161\n00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,630\nSo, in the project management\nbody of knowledge,\n\n162\n00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,242\nyou'll find a section in there where they\ntalk about organizational structure.\n\n163\n00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:33,550\nAll right?\n\n164\n00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,530\nCompanies can be structured\nin one of three forms,\n\n165\n00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,070\nI know it looks like there's more\nthere but there's really just three.\n\n166\n00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,305\nFunctional, matrix, and Projectized.\n\n167\n00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:45,005\nNow I used that word projectized\na few times in the last episode so\n\n168\n00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,765\nnow we are gonna really see what it means.\n\n169\n00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:51,545\nWell most companies today are what\nare called functional companies.\n\n170\n00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:55,472\nYou have departments,\nmaybe you have sale marketing, accounting.\n\n171\n00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:56,907\nEach department has a manager.\n\n172\n00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:57,483\nRight.\nAnd\n\n173\n00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:59,829\ndepartments are made up\nby what those people do.\n\n174\n00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,952\nIf I deal with the bookkeeping,\nI'm in the accounting department.\n\n175\n00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:05,832\nIf I am selling things,\nI'm in the sales department.\n\n176\n00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:08,969\nThe sales manager is responsible for\nall the sales, and\n\n177\n00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:11,130\nthat's where authority lays.\n\n178\n00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,840\nThose managers then answer to a higher up,\nthat's a very typical structure for\n\n179\n00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,990\nan organization today.\n\n180\n00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,920\nThat structure has been around for\nhundreds, thousands of years.\n\n181\n00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,860\nAnd it doesn't really allow for\nproject managers, so\n\n182\n00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,290\nproject managers don't really\nfit into this model very well.\n\n183\n00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,234\nAnd we'll see a diagram\nhere in just a moment.\n\n184\n00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:37,600\nProject on the other hand is where\nproject managers are the managers.\n\n185\n00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,490\nBut there are no functional managers.\n\n186\n00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,450\nThere might be a sales department,\nbut there is no sales manager.\n\n187\n00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,210\nInstead, each sales person is\nattached to a different project, and\n\n188\n00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,460\nso they answer to a project manager.\n\n189\n00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,040\nIn this environment the project\nmanagers have all of the authority.\n\n190\n00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,370\nAnd that's not very common.\n\n191\n00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,690\nYou see it at places like NASA\nwhere everything is a project.\n\n192\n00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,840\nBut you don't see it at your\nnormal average company.\n\n193\n00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,800\nA matrix is where we blend the two ideas.\n\n194\n00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,270\nWe blend functional and\nproject ties together so that we have\n\n195\n00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,470\nfunctional managers with authority and\nproject managers with authority.\n\n196\n00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,520\nAnd you get varying results out of this,\nbut\n\n197\n00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,870\nit tries to provide\nthe best of both worlds.\n\n198\n00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,320\nIt usually creates confusion.\n\n199\n00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,570\n>> Right.\n>> This is\n\n200\n00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,850\none thing that you'll hear people who've\nbeen in the military talk about it a lot.\n\n201\n00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,970\nIf you have more than one boss,\nwho do you listen to, right?\n\n202\n00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,550\nIt's very confusing for\nan employee to be in that environment but\n\n203\n00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,260\nthat hasn't stopped a lot\nof people from trying.\n\n204\n00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,990\nSo let's look at each of these and\nI'll just use the diagram\n\n205\n00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,790\nstraight from the PMBOK so\nthis is PMI's representation of it.\n\n206\n00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,880\nHere's a standard functional organization.\n\n207\n00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,550\nYour departments are divided\nup by their function.\n\n208\n00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,870\nEach one has a functional manager,\nand the functional manager\n\n209\n00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,210\nanswers to some kind of chief executive,\npresident, CEO, whatever their title is.\n\n210\n00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,280\nAnd if there's a project,\nthere's no project manager in here,\n\n211\n00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,640\nsee the project manager\nis not even on the chart.\n\n212\n00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,220\nAnd so in this scenario the project\nmanager is borrowing people.\n\n213\n00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,470\nBorrowing somebody from this department,\nborrowing somebody from this department,\n\n214\n00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,770\nand from this department, and\n\n215\n00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,650\nthen they have to coordinate with the\nfunctional managers to get those people.\n\n216\n00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,210\nHey, can I have them Tuesday afternoon?\n\n217\n00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,800\nCan I have them Monday morning?\n\n218\n00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,770\nAre they gonna be available?\n\n219\n00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,010\nThe project manager is really at\nthe whim of the functional managers to\n\n220\n00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,220\nget things done.\n\n221\n00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,650\nIt's not a very project\nsupportive environment, but\n\n222\n00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,280\nit is the most common environment.\n\n223\n00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,902\nSo this is where a lot of you guys\nare gonna end up in the workplace.\n\n224\n00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:36,790\nAll right.\n\n225\n00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,530\nIn a projectized environment.\n\n226\n00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,325\nThese are the matrix,\nlet me jump down to projectized.\n\n227\n00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:48,350\nProjectized is like the same thing except,\ninstead of having departments,\n\n228\n00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,770\nI have projects.\n\n229\n00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,550\nI might have like this staffer\nright here might be an accountant,\n\n230\n00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,540\nand this staffer might be an accountant,\nand this staffer might be an accountant.\n\n231\n00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,650\nSo each project has an accountant.\n\n232\n00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,680\nIt's like an accounting department, but\nthere's no real department in this model.\n\n233\n00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,330\nEach one is assigned\nto a separate project.\n\n234\n00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,690\nAnd same thing, we might have a lawyer\nhere, a lawyer here, a lawyer here.\n\n235\n00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,800\nI don't have a legal department,\n\n236\n00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,390\nI just happen to have a lawyer\nattached to each project.\n\n237\n00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,300\nMight even be the same lawyer attached\nto more than one project, but\n\n238\n00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,590\nthey work for a project manager, right?\n\n239\n00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,900\nThe positive here is your project\nmanagers have a lot of authority, right?\n\n240\n00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,340\nVery easy for them to manage resources.\n\n241\n00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,260\nBut, it doesn't really allow for\nongoing operations, right?\n\n242\n00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,940\nDay to day activities that\noccur outside of a project,\n\n243\n00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,430\nthis doesn't really allow for it.\n\n244\n00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,010\nWell, if you're somebody like NASA and\n\n245\n00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:42,790\nyou got a project that they're looking\nat the whole colony on Mars thing.\n\n246\n00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,350\nSo that's a project for them, and\nthey've got a project manager and\n\n247\n00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,220\nthey've got teams underneath it.\n\n248\n00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,400\nAnd those people work for that project.\n\n249\n00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,210\nThey don't work on any other projects,\nthey just work for that one.\n\n250\n00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,000\nOn a positive note,\neverybody knows who they answer to and\n\n251\n00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,950\neverybody's got one goal,\nthe project that they're on.\n\n252\n00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,010\nOn a negative note,\nwhat happens when that project is done?\n\n253\n00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,160\nThey all get fired.\n\n254\n00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,685\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n255\n00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:05,875\nIt sounds negative, but\n\n256\n00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,055\nthat is what happens, right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n257\n00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:08,275\n>> They're all under contract for\n\n258\n00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:08,975\nthat project and\n\n259\n00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:13,100\nwhen the project is done, literally their\ncontracts end, they're out of a job.\n\n260\n00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,221\nNow that doesn't mean that\nthey are truly fired,\n\n261\n00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,200\nthey usually just sign\nonto another project.\n\n262\n00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,970\nA new project starts or\nwhatever and they move onto that.\n\n263\n00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,540\nBut it does create a little\nbit of uncertainty for\n\n264\n00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,572\nthe employees that are working for this\nproject, and that is their entire job.\n\n265\n00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:29,320\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,180\nNow the hybrids, the matrices models,\n\n267\n00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,150\nthey're the ones that kind\nof blend the solution.\n\n268\n00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,730\nSo here they're showing a weak matrix.\n\n269\n00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,150\nMost companies that are just now\nimplementing project management,\n\n270\n00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,200\nare gonna fall in this weak matrix model.\n\n271\n00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,820\nWith the weak matrix, we still have a CEO,\nor a chief of some sort,\n\n272\n00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,040\nyou still have your functional managers,\nbut when someone's assigned to a project,\n\n273\n00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,720\nlike these three people here\nare assigned to a project,\n\n274\n00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,610\nthe project manager is assigned\nas their pseudo-manager, right?\n\n275\n00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,175\nSo now these employees have to\nreport to two different bosses.\n\n276\n00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:11,390\nThey have their functional manager\nthey work for most of the time, and\n\n277\n00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,400\nthey now have a project manager\nthey work for some of the time.\n\n278\n00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,300\nAnd when there's a conflict,\nthe functional manager wins.\n\n279\n00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,260\nAnd so PMI calls this a weak matrix\nbecause as a project manager you\n\n280\n00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,980\nget some authority but not nearly\nas much as a functional manager, so\n\n281\n00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,570\nyou have a weak level or weak matrix.\n\n282\n00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,790\nThe next one is a balance matrix and\n\n283\n00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,635\nwhile it looks good on paper it\nis one of the most nightmare-ish.\n\n284\n00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:43,780\n[LAUGH] In a balanced matrix, it's the\nsame model we just saw in a weak matrix.\n\n285\n00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,070\nThe difference here is the staff is\nactually assigned to the project manager.\n\n286\n00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,350\nSo notice I've got\nthe project manager here.\n\n287\n00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,870\nThe staff gets assigned to them and\nso the staff now has two bosses.\n\n288\n00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,726\nIf I'm this staffer right here I\nanswer to my functional manager and\n\n289\n00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,070\nto my project manager.\n\n290\n00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,340\nAnd not only that,\n\n291\n00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,200\nthe project manager is in a department\nwith their own functional manager.\n\n292\n00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,095\nSo now I've got multiple\ntiers of management.\n\n293\n00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:09,715\nThis becomes very challenging.\n\n294\n00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:13,375\nThe project manager gets more\nauthority than they had before, but\n\n295\n00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,825\nit's at the cost of\nconfusion of the staff.\n\n296\n00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:20,785\nThis is called a balance matrix cuz it's\ntrying to find a balance between project,\n\n297\n00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:21,469\nand functional management.\n\n298\n00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,340\nAnd then lastly we have a strong matrix.\n\n299\n00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,290\nAnd with a strong matrix, the functional\nmanager that the project managers work\n\n300\n00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,840\nfor, is actually a manager\nof project managers, right?\n\n301\n00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,310\nSo this might be the program manager,\nright?\n\n302\n00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,460\nRemember your program is made up of all\nthe individual projects that you have.\n\n303\n00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,250\nSo that person's in charge of them,\nand then staff is getting assigned.\n\n304\n00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,450\nNow Staff still has two bosses, but\nthe project managers are being backed up\n\n305\n00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,780\nby their manager, which generally\nwill have more authority than, for\n\n306\n00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,250\nexample, the functional managers.\n\n307\n00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,530\nSo definitely a interesting mix there.\n\n308\n00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,320\nBut if we go back to this chart here.\n\n309\n00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,420\nThey kind of break it down, where you'll\nsee in a projectized environment,\n\n310\n00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,480\nthe project manager has the highest\nauthority possible, beneath the CEO.\n\n311\n00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,790\nIn all of the other models you'll see,\nit gets to be less and less and\n\n312\n00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,130\nless until you have next\nto no authority whatsoever.\n\n313\n00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,770\nAnd remember, this is the model\nthat most of us are working in.\n\n314\n00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,760\nBut you'll notice some of the other\nbenefits that we get as far as resource\n\n315\n00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,020\navailability and things like that\nreally does become kind of handy.\n\n316\n00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,630\nSo be aware that the way\nyour company is structured,\n\n317\n00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,660\nis going to directly influence\nhow you can run your project.\n\n318\n00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,760\nSo that's a big deal.\n\n319\n00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,670\nThese are definitely something\nthat's gonna show up on the exam.\n\n320\n00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,286\nSo while you don't necessarily need to\nmemorize these charts specifically,\n\n321\n00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,830\nyou wanna memorize the concept.\n\n322\n00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,317\nUnderstand what each of the three matrix\ntype models are as well as the projectized\n\n323\n00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,692\nand functional models.\n\n324\n00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:06,278\nAnd so, really, this chart here is\nthe more beneficial one to remember.\n\n325\n00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,894\nAlright, some of the other things\n\n326\n00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:15,047\nthat influence our projects.\n\n327\n00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:20,780\nI'm trying to think of the best\norder to explain this.\n\n328\n00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,670\nWe'll just tackle these individually.\n\n329\n00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,270\nThere are two elements\nthat influence almost\n\n330\n00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,950\nevery single process\nthroughout our project.\n\n331\n00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,690\nAll right.\n\n332\n00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,060\nSo, they're pretty important.\n\n333\n00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,060\nThey're ones that we want to be familiar\nwith at least conceptually because they\n\n334\n00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,570\nare such a prevalent thing.\n\n335\n00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,842\nThe first one is called\nOrganizational Process Assets.\n\n336\n00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:42,500\nAll right.\n\n337\n00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,380\nIt's a big name, let me bring up my notes.\n\n338\n00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,930\nWhere are my notes?\n\n339\n00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,430\nThere.\n\n340\n00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,530\nSo I'm talking about\nthese guys right here.\n\n341\n00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,390\nOrganizational Process Assets.\n\n342\n00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,490\nAll right.\n\n343\n00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,240\nWhen you're managing a project,\n\n344\n00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,590\nit's extremely rare that you are starting\nout with absolutely nothing.\n\n345\n00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,330\nOkay.\n\n346\n00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,660\nIt's very rare for you to have a project\nthat is for you to start a company.\n\n347\n00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,850\nSo almost always,\nyour company's already in business and\n\n348\n00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,870\nyour project is adding\nsomething to that business.\n\n349\n00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,900\nIn that scenario, your company likely\nhas certain assets that you can use.\n\n350\n00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,100\nNow if it's a brand new company,\n\n351\n00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,465\nif your project is to start the company,\nthen you don't have any assets.\n\n352\n00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:24,350\nRight.\nYou can go out and get things, but\n\n353\n00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,720\nyou don't have assets themselves.\n\n354\n00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,840\nAnd by assets,\nI don't necessarily mean materials.\n\n355\n00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,020\nI don't mean like a company car or\nwhatever.\n\n356\n00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,670\nWhat I mean are processes and procedures.\n\n357\n00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:39,360\nYou might have rules,\nspecific ways of doing business defined,\n\n358\n00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,472\nthat are already in place when\nyou go to start your project.\n\n359\n00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:43,635\nAll right?\n\n360\n00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:45,515\nSo for\nexample I'm about to start a new project.\n\n361\n00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:47,985\nI just gotta assign the project\nmanagement position.\n\n362\n00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,665\nAnd I'm about to run it.\n\n363\n00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:52,655\nI might look and see what the other\nproject managers have done.\n\n364\n00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:58,140\nSo if they've already done projects I\ncan just mirror what they already did.\n\n365\n00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,210\nThey already have processes and\nprocedures in place for how to submit\n\n366\n00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:10,960\na status update, for how to payout of\nour budget, how to report on the budget.\n\n367\n00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,390\nAll that stuff may be already defined,\n\n368\n00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,750\nif we have a well defined\nproject management environment.\n\n369\n00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,410\nRight?\n\n370\n00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,730\nSo those assets are going to influence us.\n\n371\n00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,360\nI might have one particular chart that I\nmight like to use, but when I look and\n\n372\n00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,530\nI see the five last projects\nof a different type of chart,\n\n373\n00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,530\nI might choose to use that other chart.\n\n374\n00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,950\nJust because I know the employees\nare already used to it and\n\n375\n00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,650\nit's what they expect.\n\n376\n00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,050\nSo we always need to look\nat what we already have.\n\n377\n00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,520\nI always say, don't reinvent\nthe wheel if you don't have to.\n\n378\n00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,600\nIf somebody's already done the work,\nthen you shouldn't have to do it again.\n\n379\n00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,520\nUnless you can make it better,\nthat's process improvement.\n\n380\n00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,800\nYou start getting into six sigma there.\n\n381\n00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,780\nRight, continual process improvement.\n\n382\n00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,536\nSo [LAUGH] Well [INAUDIBLE]\ntry [INAUDIBLE].\n\n383\n00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:56,160\nSo anyway just keep that in mind.\n\n384\n00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480\nYou probably already have certain assets.\n\n385\n00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,100\nAnd processes and\nprocedures are very common.\n\n386\n00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,795\nLess common is a knowledge base.\n\n387\n00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:06,170\nRight?\nI love it when you find a company that has\n\n388\n00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:11,700\nthese, odds are, people have made\nmistakes in the past and the odds are.\n\n389\n00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,930\nIf you knew about those mistakes,\nyou could avoid them better yourself.\n\n390\n00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,510\nRight?\n\n391\n00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,570\nLearn from other people's mistakes and\nthat's what knowledge bases are all about.\n\n392\n00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,120\nAt the end of every project,\n\n393\n00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,316\nyou're supposed to create what's\na called a lessons learned.\n\n394\n00:19:24,316 --> 00:19:25,560\nRight?\nThe information that\n\n395\n00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,080\nyou learned is part of your\nproject if part of your project.\n\n396\n00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,990\nWhat went wrong,\nhow you fixed it and so on.\n\n397\n00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,420\nIf that becomes part a of\na company knowledge base,\n\n398\n00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,610\nyou can search across that, and\nyou can say, I need to hire.\n\n399\n00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,490\nMaybe my projects building a house, so\nI need to hire a dry wall installer.\n\n400\n00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,600\nLet me look at some of these other\nprojects and see what they used?\n\n401\n00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,820\nAnd I can use that to build my\nlist of possible candidates.\n\n402\n00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,430\nRight?\n\n403\n00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,910\nOr, hey, I'm about to order some servers\nfrom HP to put up some new servers.\n\n404\n00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,280\nWell, this other project\njust did the same thing.\n\n405\n00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,610\nLet me look at what price they got.\n\n406\n00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,880\nDid they already deal with a rep?\n\n407\n00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,910\nCan we get volume discounts, right?\n\n408\n00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,150\nSharing that information,\n\n409\n00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,840\nlooking at information that other projects\nreally can make a big difference.\n\n410\n00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n411\n00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,020\nIt also saves time, right?\n\n412\n00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,450\nOnce again, because we're not reinventing\nthe wheel here, we're instead,\n\n413\n00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,950\nactually taking a look at all\nthe possibilities here in terms of\n\n414\n00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,390\npossible failures or\nsetback other projects have had.\n\n415\n00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,950\nAnd if they do match in line\nwith what we want to do,\n\n416\n00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,350\nit may actually give us a head start and\nagain, a good functional start.\n\n417\n00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,492\nFor us to be able to do those things and\nnot have to worry about 'em.\n\n418\n00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,420\n>> All right, so\norganizational process assets,\n\n419\n00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,292\nthose are things that\nyour company may have.\n\n420\n00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,320\nAll right, you may have these,\nyou may not.\n\n421\n00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,580\nYou may not have any of this, and\nyou are starting from scratch.\n\n422\n00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,420\nAll right?\n\n423\n00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,672\nThe other thing is,\nenterprise environmental factors.\n\n424\n00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:43,490\nAll right?\n\n425\n00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,835\nEnterprise environmental factors\nare things that your company has to have.\n\n426\n00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:47,890\nAll right?\n\n427\n00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,515\nSo this isn't something\nyou have a choice on.\n\n428\n00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,405\nIf you are regulated by the US Government.\n\n429\n00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:55,815\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right, there might be certain rules and\n\n430\n00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:58,345\nstandards that you have to follow.\n\n431\n00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:02,950\nIf your company is voluntarily\nchosen to become ISO 9000 certified.\n\n432\n00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,510\nThere's rules you have to follow\nto maintain that standard.\n\n433\n00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,600\nRight?\n\n434\n00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,830\nYou might have certain governance\nrequirements, so for example,\n\n435\n00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,950\nhere in the state of Florida,\n\n436\n00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,040\nif you're a government organization,\nwe have the Sunshine Law.\n\n437\n00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,380\nSo all of your records need\nto be public information.\n\n438\n00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,070\nIf you do a bid process,\nall of that needs to be public.\n\n439\n00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,130\nYou might be private sector.\n\n440\n00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,630\nRight?\n\n441\n00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,130\nBut you might be\na publicly traded company.\n\n442\n00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,610\nIn which case, all the financial\ninformation about your project,\n\n443\n00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,910\nneeds to be shown to your investor,\nyour stockholders.\n\n444\n00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,650\nRight?\n\n445\n00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,690\nThose are things that are part of your\nenterprise environmental factors.\n\n446\n00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,430\nThese are requirements that are imposed\nupon you, and you don't have a choice.\n\n447\n00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:40,950\nRight?\n\n448\n00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,460\nSo you may know a better way to do things.\n\n449\n00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,436\nA different way to manage your project,\nbut tough luck.\n\n450\n00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:49,470\nYou're ISO 9000 certified.so you've\ngotta have this paperwork in\n\n451\n00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,480\nplace whether you like it or not.\n\n452\n00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,612\nOr you can lose your ISO 9000 designation.\n\n453\n00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:57,210\nSo that is an enterprise\nenvironmental factor.\n\n454\n00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,230\nI put governance standards.\n\n455\n00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,165\nThose are some pretty black and\nwhite ones.\n\n456\n00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:04,340\n>> Right.\n>> We do have some gray area things.\n\n457\n00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:04,970\nRight?\n\n458\n00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,780\nLike risk tolerance.\n\n459\n00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:12,740\nSo risk tolerance is your company may or\nmay not be big into taking risk.\n\n460\n00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,680\nRight?\n\n461\n00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,770\nWe're in IT, and so\nalmost IT company takes risks.\n\n462\n00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,340\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz God only knows what your computer's\n\n463\n00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,090\ngoing to do tomorrow.\n\n464\n00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:26,700\n[LAUGH] And so,\nyou'll have people that are risk seekers.\n\n465\n00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,560\nPeople who are looking to take risk\nbecause they know the bigger the risk\n\n466\n00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,440\nthe greater the reward,\nassuming it pans out.\n\n467\n00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,330\nYou also have people that are risk averse.\n\n468\n00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,450\nThese are people who would rather not\ntake a risk if they didn't have to.\n\n469\n00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,660\nWould maybe settle for lower profits or\n\n470\n00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,860\nslower project because\nthey weren't taking risk.\n\n471\n00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,220\nOr hopefully as a project manager\nwhat you are is called risk neutral.\n\n472\n00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,000\nA risk neutral person and\nlet me write all these here in the notes.\n\n473\n00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,700\nI'll post these with the episode.\n\n474\n00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,670\nBecause these are the official terms.\n\n475\n00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,630\nWe'll talk about them again later but.\n\n476\n00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,640\nSo you have risk seeker, risk neutral,\n\n477\n00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:08,140\nwhich I spelled wrong, and-\n>> No, I think you did it right.\n\n478\n00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,960\n>> Was I right?\n\n479\n00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,990\nSee my risky spelling.\n\n480\n00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,530\nAnd then you have risk averse.\n\n481\n00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,020\nRee osk a verse.\n\n482\n00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,230\nThere we go.\n\n483\n00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,886\nAll right.\n\n484\n00:23:16,886 --> 00:23:22,220\nSo those are kind of our three Little\nlevels of Risk Tolerance right there.\n\n485\n00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,260\nIf you're a Risk Seeker and\nsomebody comes to you and says hey,\n\n486\n00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,280\nI wanna do this project.\n\n487\n00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,000\nThere's a chance that it could\ndouble our sales by next year, and\n\n488\n00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,150\nit's a 10% chance [LAUGH] that\nit could double our sales.\n\n489\n00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,730\nWell you might look at that and say 10%\none out of ten chance let's do it, right?\n\n490\n00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,190\nOr you might be riskevers and say what are\nyou crazy 10% that means there's a nine\n\n491\n00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,690\nout of ten chance that this is going to\nfail forget you we're not going to do it.\n\n492\n00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,860\nRight?\n\n493\n00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,990\nOr you might be risk neutral and say well,\n\n494\n00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,320\none out of ten chance\nthat this might work.\n\n495\n00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,580\nWhat happens if it fails?\n\n496\n00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,720\nIs it gonna cost us money?\n\n497\n00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,564\nHow much money?\nYou start to qualify.\n\n498\n00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:04,407\nYou start to evaluate and look at\nthe numbers and you say all right well\n\n499\n00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:05,480\n>> It's pretty risky,\n\n500\n00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,471\nbut at the end of the day if it doesn't\nwork, it's only gonna cost us this much,\n\n501\n00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:11,240\nlet's go ahead and do it, right.\n\n502\n00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,280\nOr, no,\nthe odds are it's going to fail and\n\n503\n00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,190\nit's going to cost us too much,\nlet's not do it.\n\n504\n00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,100\nBeing risk neutral is\nkeeping your mind open.\n\n505\n00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,080\nProject managers should\nalways be risk neutral.\n\n506\n00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,220\nIf you're risk averse, you may be\npassing up opportunities that were.\n\n507\n00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,260\nPossibly beneficial for your company.\n\n508\n00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,440\nAnd if you are a risk seeker,\n\n509\n00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,280\nyou might be taking unnecessary risks\nthat jeopardize your organization.\n\n510\n00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,780\nSo being the neutral person, and\n\n511\n00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,470\nwe have that here, right,\nit's kind of one of our running things.\n\n512\n00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,010\nOne of the gentlemen at the company here,\nTim, he's a risk seeker.\n\n513\n00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,420\nHe has big vision ideas all\npacked full of risk and\n\n514\n00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,990\nI'm the risk neutral guy that\ntries to like back that down.\n\n515\n00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,750\nLet's start to kind of keep\nthat a little more contained.\n\n516\n00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,010\nBut at the end of the day,\nif you don't take risks,\n\n517\n00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,410\nyou're not gonna be successful.\n\n518\n00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,530\nSo you definitely wanna make\nsure you keep that in mind.\n\n519\n00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,170\nBut that risk tolerance, your company's\nrisk tolerance, your sponsor's risk\n\n520\n00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,780\ntolerance, the tolerance of your\nstakeholders, your shareholders, right,\n\n521\n00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,440\nthat's really going to impact how\nyour projects are run, all right..\n\n522\n00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,340\nIf your company is a risk seeker,\nyou might have very aggressive timelines,\n\n523\n00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,430\nvery aggressive budgets.\n\n524\n00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,430\nBut if you're risk averse, you might\nhave longer timelines that allow for\n\n525\n00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,610\nschedule slip.\n\n526\n00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,060\nOr you might have bigger\nbudgets that allow for\n\n527\n00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,820\noverrunning the budget a little bit.\n\n528\n00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,030\nSo you might have safety cushions to\nhelp ensure your project is successful.\n\n529\n00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,720\nSo it just depends on how\nyour company is built,\n\n530\n00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,720\nthe kind of people that are in it, which\none of those you're gonna fall under.\n\n531\n00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,120\nAnd then the last one I've got\nis marketplace conditions.\n\n532\n00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,610\nThis is one that wreaks havoc\non every project, right.\n\n533\n00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,900\nI can't tell you the amount of\ntimes that I started a project and\n\n534\n00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,410\ngot quotes on a lot of stuff,\nTelco systems, hardware, whatever.\n\n535\n00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,350\nAnd when when it came purchase time,\nthe prices were different, right.\n\n536\n00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,940\nMarketplace conditions are going to\nchange what we can and can't do.\n\n537\n00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,940\nIf you're a construction company and\nnormal you build 8,000 square foot houses\n\n538\n00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,450\nbut the housing market falls to\nwhere people can't afford that.\n\n539\n00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,890\nYou might start building 2000\nsquare foot houses, much smaller,\n\n540\n00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,330\nbecause they sell easier.\n\n541\n00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,050\nSo that's the kind of thing that starts to\ninfluence what projects get selected, but\n\n542\n00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,320\nas far as what project, or\n\n543\n00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,640\nhow projects are carried out, marketplace\nconditions can effect that too.\n\n544\n00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,430\nIf I set a budget and I said I'm\ngonna spend x amount on servers.\n\n545\n00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,040\nAnd all the sudden I find out there's\ngonna be a great big sale on servers.\n\n546\n00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,970\nI might not have intended on buying\nthose servers for another month, but\n\n547\n00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,140\nnow I know if I buy them right now,\nI can save 20%.\n\n548\n00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,420\nI might do that.\n\n549\n00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,990\nI might rearrange my project a bit to buy\nthose severs early cuz I know it's gonna\n\n550\n00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,880\nsave me money, and improve the chances of\nmy org, my project finishing under budget.\n\n551\n00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,320\nSo marketplace conditions can\ndirectly influence your project.\n\n552\n00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,560\nIt can even lead to it being cancelled.\n\n553\n00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,690\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right.\n\n554\n00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,390\nYou're seeing that with\nhe military right now.\n\n555\n00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,200\nThe US military, where they have that,\nwhat's it called?\n\n556\n00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,870\nThe Joint Strike Fighter, JSF?\n\n557\n00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,430\n>> Yeah.\n\n558\n00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,500\nWhere, I mean,\nthis is something ridiculous,\n\n559\n00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,970\nlike 32 billion per plane to create it.\n\n560\n00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,860\nAnd apparently they were cool with\nthat ten years ago when they started\n\n561\n00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,790\nthe program, but now, they're like,\nooh, that might be a little expensive.\n\n562\n00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,439\n>> Yeah.\n>> It takes ten years to figure that out.\n\n563\n00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:28,990\n[LAUGH] So now,\nthey're canceling the project.\n\n564\n00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,580\nThey're 10 years in,\nthey put ten years of work in there.\n\n565\n00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,610\nThe project wasn't failing,\nit was moving along as expected.\n\n566\n00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:40,600\nBut the marketplace has changed and now\npeople's perception of 30 some odd billion\n\n567\n00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,700\nper plane has been seen for\nwhat it is, which is ludicrous.\n\n568\n00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,005\nSo the project gets cancelled.\n\n569\n00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:47,470\n[LAUGH] That can happen,\n\n570\n00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,032\na project can be terminated\nbecause of marketplace conditions.\n\n571\n00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:50,532\nYeah.\n\n572\n00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:55,090\nAll right well, Ronnie, that's a pretty\ngood spot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n573\n00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:55,680\n>> All right, sounds great.\n\n574\n00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,670\n>> So, why don't we stop here?\n\n575\n00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,280\nWhen we get back, we've got some\nreal important stuff to talk about,\n\n576\n00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,290\nbecause we're gonna look at processes.\n\n577\n00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,440\nWe kind of talked a little bit about\nprocesses, so we've got some more of that,\n\n578\n00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,460\nand the project life cycle\nwe haven't touched on.\n\n579\n00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,320\nSo, good stuff coming up.\n\n580\n00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,187\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n581\n00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:19,780\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n582\n00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,740\nSo what I'd like to talk about now,\nis the project life cycle.\n\n583\n00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,575\nWhich is really just complex way of saying\nwhat happens while your project runs?\n\n584\n00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:31,070\n>> Right.\n>> Projects have a well-defined\n\n585\n00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,810\ntimeline which we mentioned earlier.\n\n586\n00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,310\nWell I guess in the last episode.\n\n587\n00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,420\nThat projects are a temporary endeavor.\n\n588\n00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,020\nSo they have a start and\na finish, if they don't,\n\n589\n00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,640\nif they don't have a well defined start\nand finish you're destined for failure.\n\n590\n00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,170\nVery difficult to be successful\nwith a project like that, so\n\n591\n00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,350\nPMI has what they call\nthe project life cycle and\n\n592\n00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,280\nit kind of shows what happens\nthrough out your project.\n\n593\n00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,260\nBasically you start your project,\n\n594\n00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,360\nthis is what we call initiation, it's just\nthe beginning, somebody thinks of an idea,\n\n595\n00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,790\nhey, i want something to happen,\nall right.\n\n596\n00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,390\nAnd then we start moving into\nthe actual activities of the project.\n\n597\n00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:08,670\nA project charter is written\nwhich kicks off the real project.\n\n598\n00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,620\nSo you'll see this dotted line,\nthis is how many\n\n599\n00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,960\nemployees you have dedicated to the\nproject and how much money you've spent.\n\n600\n00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,430\nIt's pretty low in these\nfirst two stages and\n\n601\n00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,870\nthe reason is you're not actually\ndoing the work yet, you're planning,\n\n602\n00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,660\nyou're thinking,\nyou're coming up with eventualities.\n\n603\n00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,340\nYou have your project team and that's\nabout it and your project team may even be\n\n604\n00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,190\nvery small at this stage, right,\nso this is all just getting ready.\n\n605\n00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,350\nAnd then once you're done planning,\nnow the real work happens, right.\n\n606\n00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,460\nCarrying out the work,\ngetting things done.\n\n607\n00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,790\nThis is where you spend your budget.\n\n608\n00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,510\nYou'll see you go up to your\nmaximum employee amount.\n\n609\n00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,420\nYou start expending, you buy materials,\nyou bring in contractors.\n\n610\n00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,450\nWork is getting done.\n\n611\n00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,060\nAnd when the work is done,\nthen we go into closing.\n\n612\n00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,700\nWe release the employees to work in\nother projects, we're done with them.\n\n613\n00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,750\nWe release our contractors who\nhave fulfilled their contract.\n\n614\n00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,430\nAnd we go right back down to just being\nthe project team and shutting down, right.\n\n615\n00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,550\nThe project is only over when\nthe last employee is released and\n\n616\n00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,240\nthe last employee is the project manager,\nright.\n\n617\n00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,800\nSo the captain goes down\nwith the ship [LAUGH] right.\n\n618\n00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,820\nSo this is basically what happens\nthroughout the life of a project.\n\n619\n00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,520\nThey call it the project life cycle,\nall right?\n\n620\n00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,810\nNow, it's pretty common sense.\n\n621\n00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,850\nWhy do we need to be aware of this?\n\n622\n00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,890\nThe main reason we need to know is\nhow change can affect our project.\n\n623\n00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,420\nI made a comment in the first segment,\n\n624\n00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,530\nI said how change can be very\nexpensive as time goes on.\n\n625\n00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,110\nWell it's not just change,\nit's really risk.\n\n626\n00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,250\nRisks, things that can go wrong in\nthe project, anything like that,\n\n627\n00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,820\nbecomes more expensive down the road.\n\n628\n00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,120\nThey actually have a chart for\nthat in here somewhere.\n\n629\n00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,040\nHere we go.\n\n630\n00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,680\nSo notice that,\nat the very beginning of our project,\n\n631\n00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,160\nwe might have a lot of risk and\na lot of uncertainty.\n\n632\n00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,280\nWe just don't know how things are gonna\ngo at the beginning of our project.\n\n633\n00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:10,240\nBut as we near the end of our project,\nour risk goes down and our uncertainty.\n\n634\n00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,710\nWe know a lot more.\n\n635\n00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,860\nWe know we're almost to the finish line.\n\n636\n00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,010\nSo it's a lot less risky and\na lot less uncertain.\n\n637\n00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:22,960\nBut if we want to change, notice this\ncost of change, it steadily increases.\n\n638\n00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,200\nSo making changes at the last minute\ncan be incredibly expensive, right.\n\n639\n00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,340\nI equate this like a college degree,\nright.\n\n640\n00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,660\n[LAUGH] So if you're pursuing a four-year\ndegree, and in your first year, right.\n\n641\n00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,990\nMaybe you're wanting to do.\n\n642\n00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,400\nWell you take me for an example.\n\n643\n00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,745\nI did political science.\n\n644\n00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:44,370\nAnd in my first year of college, if I had\ndecided hey, I don't wanna do political\n\n645\n00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,710\nscience I wanna switch to computer\nsciences, computer information sciences.\n\n646\n00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,160\nWell if I made that change my first\nyear it's not a big deal I only had\n\n647\n00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,930\none semester maybe two semesters under my\nbelt not a lot of classes most of those\n\n648\n00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:00,890\nwere general education stuff anyways so\nno big deal, change majors, great.\n\n649\n00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,445\nBut that's not what I did.\n\n650\n00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:02,291\n[LAUGH] I changed majors my fourth year.\n\n651\n00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:08,247\nI was basically done with my degree\nwhen I decided I wanted to switch.\n\n652\n00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:09,602\nWell that's a big deal,\n\n653\n00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:12,775\nI had a ton of credits that I'd\nalready done in one degree.\n\n654\n00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:15,668\nAnd now I switch, and\nended up just finished both,\n\n655\n00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:17,750\nbecause it kind of made sense.\n\n656\n00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,700\nBut, it was an expensive change,\nI had to take a lot more courses.\n\n657\n00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,190\nThat's how your project is.\n\n658\n00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,550\nIf you decide to change the time line.\n\n659\n00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,810\nIf you decide to change the budget,\nwhich is next to impossible.\n\n660\n00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,150\nIf you decide to change the requirements,\n\n661\n00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,420\nto add more requirements\nat the end of the project.\n\n662\n00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,690\nIn order to get those new\nrequirements done and\n\n663\n00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,550\nstill meet your time line,\nit's gonna cost money.\n\n664\n00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,560\nYou're gonna need to bring in more people.\n\n665\n00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,770\nIt's very dangerous to do that kind\nof change at the end of a project.\n\n666\n00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,600\nSo, we need to understand that\nbecause the cost of change increases,\n\n667\n00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,785\nthe likelihood of change decreases.\n\n668\n00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:53,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So normally as\n\n669\n00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,270\nyou reach the end of your project,\nyou're gonna see less changes happening.\n\n670\n00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,400\nYou might see a lot of change,\nright here while we're planning.\n\n671\n00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,290\nAs we learn more we recognize more.\n\n672\n00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:07,410\nWe modify and\nadapt to meet our requirements.\n\n673\n00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,660\nWe improvise, adapt, overcome, right?\n\n674\n00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,670\nThe Marine Corps motto.\n\n675\n00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,430\nOr unofficial one I guess.\n\n676\n00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:18,570\nAnd then when we actually go to carry out\nthe work, we've got people doing stuff.\n\n677\n00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,800\nIf we've already laid the foundation for\nthe house, and\n\n678\n00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,620\nthen the buyer comes and says that,\nI wanna add one more room.\n\n679\n00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:32,890\nWe've already poured the foundation,\nnow we have to extend the foundation out.\n\n680\n00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,800\nIt can be done, but there's already\nwalls here, we've got to take those out.\n\n681\n00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,220\nThe further along that\nhouse is in its build,\n\n682\n00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,240\nthe harder it becomes to add on to it.\n\n683\n00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,480\nBut if we think of it early on,\n\n684\n00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,280\nbefore the foundation's laid,\nit's a marginal thing to add, right?\n\n685\n00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,810\nThat's how change is with our project.\n\n686\n00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,440\nSo, we need to be aware of where\nwe're at in the life cycle.\n\n687\n00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,400\nHere in the planning phase,\nchange is okay, don't be resistant.\n\n688\n00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,830\nAllow change to occur,\n\n689\n00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,460\nmake sure that it still conforms to\nwhat you set out in the original.\n\n690\n00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,580\nWell, we'll talk about\nthe project charter later on.\n\n691\n00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,690\nBut it meets that kinda stuff, and\n\n692\n00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,320\nthat we don't deviate too\nfar from our original goals.\n\n693\n00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,730\nBut, it's okay to make change here.\n\n694\n00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,280\nIt's also okay to make minor change,\nwhen you're executing.\n\n695\n00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,770\nMajor change is possible too,\nit's not impossible.\n\n696\n00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,860\nWe just need to make sure we\nunderstand what it's gonna cost us.\n\n697\n00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,800\nAnd usually that cost is\nrepresented one of three ways.\n\n698\n00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:33,060\nAnd I don't really, let's see if I can\ndo my silly drawing here real quick.\n\n699\n00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,860\nProjects are made up of\na number of requirements.\n\n700\n00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,300\nAnd they really rotate\naround three concepts,\n\n701\n00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,140\nso let me show you what I mean.\n\n702\n00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,680\nLet me get a nice big triangle here.\n\n703\n00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,140\nAnd when we do project management, we're\nreally balancing three different ideas.\n\n704\n00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,560\nWe start off with, for example, Budget.\n\n705\n00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:09,660\nHere we go.\n\n706\n00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:15,381\nSo we've got Budget,\n\n707\n00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:18,694\nSchedule and\n\n708\n00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:23,813\n[LAUGH] there we go and\n\n709\n00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:28,038\nRequirements.\n\n710\n00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,870\nAll right, so\nat the beginning of a project.\n\n711\n00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,200\nSomebody comes up with these three things.\n\n712\n00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,600\nAnd that somebody is, who knows who?\n\n713\n00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,740\nIt could be the project sponsor,\nit could be the PMO.\n\n714\n00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,290\nIt's whoever it is that defines\nprojects for your organization, right?\n\n715\n00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,760\nAnd when we complete the project,\n\n716\n00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,030\nthese are the three things\nthat we're competing against.\n\n717\n00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,050\nWe need to meet a certain Schedule.\n\n718\n00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,930\nIf I need to be done by December 1st,\nall right?\n\n719\n00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,830\nEverything I do has to be\nbuilt around that date,\n\n720\n00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,640\nI've got to be done by December 1st.\n\n721\n00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,736\nIf my budget is $500,000,\n\n722\n00:36:07,736 --> 00:36:11,240\nI can't spend any more than $500,000,\nI need to figure that out.\n\n723\n00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,060\nAnd then Requirements,\nhere's what I need to achieve,\n\n724\n00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,790\nhere's the checklist of\nwhat I've got to do.\n\n725\n00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,670\nIf I don't do any of this stuff,\nmy project fails.\n\n726\n00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,530\nIf a change comes in, and\n\n727\n00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,180\nsomebody wants to add more requirements,\nwhat's that gonna do?\n\n728\n00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,190\nWell, it may take more time.\n\n729\n00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,100\nI need to add more to my schedule, right?\n\n730\n00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,440\nMore time.\n\n731\n00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,880\nOr, if I can't add more time,\nif December 1st is still my date, but\n\n732\n00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,940\nthey're adding more requirements,\nI may need to add more staff.\n\n733\n00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,480\n>> People.\n\n734\n00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,910\n>> Yeah,\nthat's gonna increase my budget, right?\n\n735\n00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,540\nI'm gonna need to spend more money,\nall right?\n\n736\n00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,850\nBut, if they add Requirements, but\ndon't add time to the Schedule and\n\n737\n00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,800\ndon't add Budget.\n\n738\n00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,730\nCan we do it?\n\n739\n00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,550\n>> No.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n740\n00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,220\n>> Maybe, but\n\n741\n00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,700\nthere is a lot of risk right there.\n\n742\n00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,860\nSo, this is the kind of change\nwe don't want to allow.\n\n743\n00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,520\nWe're constantly playing a balancing game,\nbetween these three things right here.\n\n744\n00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,740\nNow the terminology that I've used\nhere is our standard terminology.\n\n745\n00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,010\nBut, you'll here other terms\nthrown around for this.\n\n746\n00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,970\nInstead of schedule,\nyou may hear it referred to as time.\n\n747\n00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,870\nAnd Budget you might\nhear referred to as cost.\n\n748\n00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,460\nAnd Requirements you might\nhear referred to as scope.\n\n749\n00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,910\nWe haven't talked about scope yet.\n\n750\n00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,730\nSo, you may hear different terminology.\n\n751\n00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,520\nSo let me just update this\nto reflect both terms.\n\n752\n00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,019\nSo, this would be like Requirement/Scope,\n\n753\n00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:40,795\nand Schedule/Time, and\nBudget, I can type, please.\n\n754\n00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:47,336\nThere we go, Cost.\n\n755\n00:37:47,336 --> 00:37:53,780\nAnd, so these are the three things that\nwe're competing against with a project.\n\n756\n00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:00,430\nI used to use a car mechanic, that had\nthis sign above his little mechanics bay.\n\n757\n00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,330\nAnd the sign basically said,\n\n758\n00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,500\nsomething that really kinda\nties into this same idea.\n\n759\n00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,060\nLet me write it over here.\n\n760\n00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,566\nIt basically said,\nwe do three types of jobs here.\n\n761\n00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:17,850\nWe do Good, Fast, and Cheap.\n\n762\n00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,480\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n763\n00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,440\n>> It said we do three jobs.\n\n764\n00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,159\nYou can pick.\n\n765\n00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,970\nSo, if you want your car fixed, and\n\n766\n00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,890\nyou want it to be good and\nfast it's not gonna be cheap.\n\n767\n00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,030\nIf you want it to be fast and\ncheap, it's not gonna be good.\n\n768\n00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,950\nAnd if you want it to be good and\ncheap, it's not gonna be fast.\n\n769\n00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,120\nYou have to pick two of the three.\n\n770\n00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,810\nWell, that's how project management is,\nwhen you want your project done.\n\n771\n00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,740\nIf you want it to be done fast,\n\n772\n00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,690\non a low budget, then you're not gonna\nbe able to pick a lot of requirements.\n\n773\n00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,260\nIt's gonna be a simple project, but\nif you wanna complex project with a lot of\n\n774\n00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,040\nrequirements, and you wanna it done fast,\nyou're gonna need a big budget.\n\n775\n00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,020\nThis is what we're doing we're juggling,\nbetween these different elements in our\n\n776\n00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,210\nproject as we try and plan things\nwe try and get things in place.\n\n777\n00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:09,150\nSo this is a constant balancing game,\nand when you look at that project life\n\n778\n00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:14,570\ncycle back here change, way down here,\nadding new requirements to whatever,\n\n779\n00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,170\nthat's going to affect your schedule and\nbudget.\n\n780\n00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,528\nYou got to balance and plan around that.\n\n781\n00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,190\nAll right.\n\n782\n00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,960\nSo that's basically the project life\ncycle, and what we're involved in.\n\n783\n00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,660\nNow, notice how they've kind\nof broken parts of this down.\n\n784\n00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,510\nWe have the Project Charter, Project\nManagement Plan, Accepted Deliverables.\n\n785\n00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,070\nWhat is all that stuff?\n\n786\n00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:39,910\nWell, these are components or artifacts\nof the project, and that term artifact, I\n\n787\n00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,380\nimmediately think Indiana Jones, grabbing\na golden monkey head off of the altar.\n\n788\n00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,320\nThe artifacts that we're talking about\nthough, is really just paperwork.\n\n789\n00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,150\nSo, these are documents\nthat define our project, or\n\n790\n00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,950\nwell, except a deliverable set.\n\n791\n00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,238\nThat may be a document that you signed off\non, but there's the deliverable itself.\n\n792\n00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:56,444\nWhatever that is?\n\n793\n00:39:56,444 --> 00:40:01,389\nSo, these are all things that are being\ncreated as part of our project.\n\n794\n00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:02,981\nHow do we know to create those things?\n\n795\n00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:08,083\nWell, PMI, has a well defined set of\nphases that we follow as we move through\n\n796\n00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:12,930\na project and various activities\nthat we perform as a part of those.\n\n797\n00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,600\nAnd that is a part of our\nproject management life cycle.\n\n798\n00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,750\nThey don't really show all five phases\nhere, they show kinda four divisions\n\n799\n00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,100\nbecause they've combined\ntwo phases right here.\n\n800\n00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,670\nThen that goes back to something I\nmentioned in the last episode also,\n\n801\n00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,070\nwhich, where did I talk about that?\n\n802\n00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,300\nHere.\n\n803\n00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,670\nThese are the five phases that\nI talked about in part one.\n\n804\n00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,860\nInitiation.\n\n805\n00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,160\nWe come up with the idea of a project.\n\n806\n00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,080\nPlanning.\n\n807\n00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,390\nWe figure out how we're gonna do it.\n\n808\n00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,420\nExecution.\n\n809\n00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,730\nWe do it.\n\n810\n00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,200\nMonitoring and controlling.\n\n811\n00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,410\nWe watch how it's being done,\nwe make sure we stay on target,\n\n812\n00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,040\nif we aren't, we correct.\n\n813\n00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,330\nAnd then we close.\n\n814\n00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,540\nAnd I made the comment that execution and\n\n815\n00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,390\nmonitoring really happen at the same time,\nright.\n\n816\n00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,930\nAnd that's why when we look at the project\nlife cycle here they only show four.\n\n817\n00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,830\nAnd that's because here executing,\nmonitoring and\n\n818\n00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:12,580\ncontrolling are all happening\nduring carry out the work.\n\n819\n00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,890\nThis is actually showing all five of\nthose phases just more accurately.\n\n820\n00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:17,640\n>> Yeah.\n\n821\n00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,400\nA lot of times the terminology\nchanges well because when we\n\n822\n00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,500\nstart talking to people that are not\nin the project management field.\n\n823\n00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,900\nTo tell them that we're in\nthe process of executing or\n\n824\n00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,915\nmonitoring, and controlling,\n>> Yeah.\n\n825\n00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:31,615\n>> May not always actually have\na good understanding for them, or\n\n826\n00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:36,155\nthe idea of initiating, or\nthe idea of planning out.\n\n827\n00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:39,555\nWhat this gives us the ability to take\nall of those things that we've worked\n\n828\n00:41:39,555 --> 00:41:42,530\nvery hard in, and then when we\ndeliver it to our stakeholders,\n\n829\n00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:46,740\nwho may not be as familiar, we can\nwalk them through the life cycle, and\n\n830\n00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,470\nin that way they have\na better understanding of it.\n\n831\n00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,770\nStakeholders are actually better informed,\nand\n\n832\n00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,990\nthat makes them actually feel better\nabout what's actually coming up.\n\n833\n00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,760\n>> Yeah.\n>> And we want them to\n\n834\n00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,400\nfeel better, don't we?\n\n835\n00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,290\n>> We do, we want them to feel better.\n\n836\n00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,822\nCuz if not they could be,\nagain, not so good before this.\n\n837\n00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:05,720\n>> All right, in the project management\n\n838\n00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,130\ninstitutes framework, they divide up\neverything we need to do by these phases.\n\n839\n00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,710\nSo there's certain things we need\nto do in the initiation phase.\n\n840\n00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,080\nLet me go back to my diagram.\n\n841\n00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,330\nIn the initiation phase.\n\n842\n00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,370\nThere's certain things we need\nto do in the planning phase.\n\n843\n00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,570\nThen there's different things for\neach phase along the way, and\n\n844\n00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:27,560\nthere's a whole list of them,\njust a giant laundry list, right?\n\n845\n00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,330\nWhat they do is they divide the things we\nneed to do into what are called processes.\n\n846\n00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,920\nAnd there are a A ton of processes.\n\n847\n00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920\nThere's, I had to look at my cheat sheet.\n\n848\n00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,050\n>> 47.\n\n849\n00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:39,910\n>> There are 47 processes.\n\n850\n00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,790\nNow you might ask yourself,\nwait a minute Don, you're a PMP.\n\n851\n00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,120\nYou've been one for a long time.\n\n852\n00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,790\nWhy'd you have to look\nat your cheat sheet?\n\n853\n00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,320\nThe reason is, PMI,\n\n854\n00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,710\nthey update the project management\nbody of knowledge, the PMBOK.\n\n855\n00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:57,810\nWhen I originally got my PMP it was\nthe PIMBOT third addition all right they\n\n856\n00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:02,290\nhad just moved to the third addition when\nI got certified well since I've been with\n\n857\n00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:07,680\nthe PMI which that was six years\nago since then the PIMBOT fourth\n\n858\n00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,020\naddition came out and then the fifth\naddition came out and with each addition.\n\n859\n00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,820\nThey eliminate some processes that people\naren't using and they introduce new\n\n860\n00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,490\nprocesses that can be beneficial to people\nand sometimes they combine processes and\n\n861\n00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,160\nthey split processes\n>> Yeah\n\n862\n00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,789\n>> Apart so it changes right, so\n\n863\n00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:26,266\nwhen I first got certified\nthere were 42 and\n\n864\n00:43:26,266 --> 00:43:29,983\nthat's what I memorized 42 easy to\nremember the meaning of life in\n\n865\n00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:31,842\nthe Douglas Ham's books\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n866\n00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,603\n>> 42, but it's changed and so\n\n867\n00:43:33,603 --> 00:43:37,330\nnow there's 47 some have been added,\nsome have been removed,\n\n868\n00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,000\nsome have been merged,\nsome have been split.\n\n869\n00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,420\nSo, there's 47 of them.\n\n870\n00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,760\nDo I have them memorized.\n\n871\n00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,590\nAbsolutely not.\n\n872\n00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,150\nThere's a ton of them.\n\n873\n00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,170\nAs a project manager,\n\n874\n00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,780\nwe need to be familiar with all\nof them as far as what they do.\n\n875\n00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:54,580\nYou don't have to memorize every single\none of them, but there's 47 different\n\n876\n00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:59,260\nactivities that you may, or may not need\nto take, depending on your organization.\n\n877\n00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,800\nAs a product manager it's up\nto you to figure that out.\n\n878\n00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,340\nLook at all 47 of them and\nsay do I need this or not?\n\n879\n00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,390\nAll right?\n\n880\n00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,730\nFor example, accounting.\n\n881\n00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,600\nThere's like four different actually\nI think it was more than four.\n\n882\n00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,480\nI can tell you.\n\n883\n00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,210\nLet me give an actual number.\n\n884\n00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,010\nIf you're a money person there are.\n\n885\n00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,350\nOh, I was right there's four.\n\n886\n00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,720\nThere's four different accounting\nprocesses that you might fall under.\n\n887\n00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,560\nRight.\n\n888\n00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,120\nBut in your company,\nyour company might have a policy that says\n\n889\n00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,540\nproject managers are not\nallowed to do accounting.\n\n890\n00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,690\nThat their budget is managed\nby the accounting department.\n\n891\n00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,460\nAnd they can request funds,\n\n892\n00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,370\nrequest payouts, but the project\nmanagers aren't allowed to sign checks.\n\n893\n00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,970\nYou have to do it all through accounting.\n\n894\n00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:42,600\nWell in that case, you look at those four\nprocesses and you say, you know what?\n\n895\n00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,350\nI don't need those.\n\n896\n00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,430\n>> Yep.\n>> Because we don't do that,\n\n897\n00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,790\nwe let the accounting\ndepartment handle it.\n\n898\n00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,190\nYou had 47 processes,\nnow you just have 43.\n\n899\n00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,410\nRight?\n\n900\n00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,010\nAnd, you may find as you look\nover all the processes there\n\n901\n00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,080\nare many like that that your\ncompany just doesn't need.\n\n902\n00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,750\nAll right?\n\n903\n00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,140\nBut, there's some core ones.\n\n904\n00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,060\nThere's a good 25 or so\ncore ones that everybody needs.\n\n905\n00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,720\nThat's the glory of this being a framework\n\n906\n00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,790\nis that you customize\nit to meet your needs.\n\n907\n00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,990\nYou pick the parts that are good for\nyou, and\n\n908\n00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,080\nyou leave the parts that you don't\nneed for your organization, right.\n\n909\n00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,750\nDefinitely have that flexibility.\n\n910\n00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:20,798\nAll right, because their are so\nmany processes, what the PMI does,\n\n911\n00:45:20,798 --> 00:45:25,160\nis they divide it up into what\nare called knowledge areas.\n\n912\n00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:31,590\nI'll just pull it up in the PMBOK\nbecause it makes the most sense there.\n\n913\n00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,020\nThey have a cool chart on page 61.\n\n914\n00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,772\nThere it is.\n\n915\n00:45:35,772 --> 00:45:37,470\nThis chart right here.\n\n916\n00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:42,480\nWhere they lay out the phases,\nso I can see initiating,\n\n917\n00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,760\nplanning, executing, monitoring,\ncontrolling, and closing.\n\n918\n00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,420\nRight?\nThose are the five phases.\n\n919\n00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,490\nNow, here they're labeled\nas process groups,\n\n920\n00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,460\nbecause they're collecting\nthese processes together.\n\n921\n00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,720\nHere's all the initiating processes,\n\n922\n00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,450\nhere's all the planning processes,\nand so on.\n\n923\n00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,490\nThen they subdivide that,\ninto what are called knowledge areas and\n\n924\n00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,650\na knowledge area is really\nbased on who the employee is,\n\n925\n00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:12,510\nwhat their job function is and by\nemployee, I mean the project team member.\n\n926\n00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:18,820\nFor example, if you are the project\nmanager, you need to know all of these.\n\n927\n00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,290\nRight but if you're the accountant, then\n\n928\n00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,180\nyou come down here to find that knowledge\narea, right here project cost management.\n\n929\n00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,170\nAll right, the accountant\ndeals with project cost, and\n\n930\n00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:33,870\nso here's the processes that\napply to the accountants.\n\n931\n00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:39,440\nThey've got Plan Cost Management, Estimate\nCosts, Determine Budget, Control Costs.\n\n932\n00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,897\nThose are the four things that\nthe accountants are gonna work on.\n\n933\n00:46:41,897 --> 00:46:45,585\nAll right,\nif you are the scheduling coordinator,\n\n934\n00:46:45,585 --> 00:46:48,965\nthen you are concerned about\nproject time management.\n\n935\n00:46:48,965 --> 00:46:51,685\nAnd you'll see that you've got\na bunch of stuff right here,\n\n936\n00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:56,302\nplan schedule management, define activity,\nsequence activities, Estimate resources.\n\n937\n00:46:56,302 --> 00:46:59,712\nThese are things a scheduler will deal\nwith, and then control the schedule.\n\n938\n00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:04,682\nNotice how project time\nmanagement has absolutely nothing\n\n939\n00:47:04,682 --> 00:47:06,402\nin the initiating phase.\n\n940\n00:47:06,402 --> 00:47:09,152\nAnd they have nothing\nin the closing phase.\n\n941\n00:47:09,152 --> 00:47:11,392\nThat means that during those phases,\n\n942\n00:47:11,392 --> 00:47:15,910\nI don't necessarily need\nmy project scheduler.\n\n943\n00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:16,620\nAll right.\n\n944\n00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,620\nWhen we go back to that\nproject life cycle.\n\n945\n00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,900\nWhat page is that, 39?\n\n946\n00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,877\n>> Yes.\n>> Yeah.\n\n947\n00:47:21,877 --> 00:47:25,564\nWhen we go back here remember how\nit said cost staffing level and\n\n948\n00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:29,100\nsee how there's not a lot of\nstaff here at initiating.\n\n949\n00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,930\nThat's because somebody like a scheduler I\ndon't need them until I get to planning,\n\n950\n00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,630\nand then I don't need them when I'm\nclosing anymore cuz the project's over.\n\n951\n00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:39,710\nThese are employees that you add and\nremove Certain phases of the project.\n\n952\n00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:42,810\nUnderstanding where we need those people,\n\n953\n00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,480\nthat kind of comes down\nto this table right here.\n\n954\n00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,300\nThis is a very important table.\n\n955\n00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,595\nThis is like A guidebook to everything\nyou need to know for the exam.\n\n956\n00:47:53,595 --> 00:47:58,588\nThese processes are what makes up the PMI\nframework and it's what you're being\n\n957\n00:47:58,588 --> 00:48:02,778\ntested on is knowing how to use\neach of these different processes.\n\n958\n00:48:02,778 --> 00:48:05,799\nAll right\n>> So when we look down the knowledge\n\n959\n00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:09,630\narea list here we're seeing\nbasically job roles, right.\n\n960\n00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:15,740\nProject integration management that is the\nproject manager tying the project in with\n\n961\n00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,950\nthe company's goals and making the project\nwork the way that it's supposed to work.\n\n962\n00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:23,740\nSo developing a charter,\ndeveloping a plan, direct and\n\n963\n00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,040\nmanage the project work, this is\nstuff that the project manager does.\n\n964\n00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,420\nProject scope management, that's managing\nthe requirements of the project,\n\n965\n00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,620\nwhat we need to do to\nconsider this complete.\n\n966\n00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,470\nThe project manager does this\nalong with the sponsor, and\n\n967\n00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,830\nthe other stakeholders, right.\n\n968\n00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,960\nThe various people that I've\ninfluenced on this are going to be\n\n969\n00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,770\ndealing with the project scope.\n\n970\n00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:50,210\nAnd we're gonna do shows on each and\nevery one of these.\n\n971\n00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:53,939\nSo you'll see that we'll go a lot\nmore in-depth on these later.\n\n972\n00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,150\nProject time management.\n\n973\n00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,410\nThat's schedule, right.\n\n974\n00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,340\nSo who's managing that schedule?\n\n975\n00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,970\nYou might have a scheduling coordinator.\n\n976\n00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,920\nOr you might do it yourself\nas the project manager.\n\n977\n00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,150\nSame thing with cost management.\n\n978\n00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,530\nYou might have an accountant that's\ndoing the cost management or\n\n979\n00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,360\nyou might do it yourself.\n\n980\n00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,570\nProject quality management.\n\n981\n00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:15,240\nFor a lot of organizations it's\nthe project manager doing this,\n\n982\n00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,490\nquality just means am I\nmeeting my requirements?\n\n983\n00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,980\nI'm doing the work,\nis it meeting the requirements,\n\n984\n00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,100\nif it isn't I'm below quality\nI need to fix that, right.\n\n985\n00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,470\nIn a manufacturing environment, this\nmight be, if we're producing something,\n\n986\n00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,510\ndoes it meet the requirements or\ndoes it have flaws, right.\n\n987\n00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,211\nDo we need to reevaluate our processes?\n\n988\n00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:38,270\nProject human resource management.\n\n989\n00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:40,870\nThis is adding employees to the project,\n\n990\n00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,070\ntaking employees away when\nyou're done with them.\n\n991\n00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,910\nThis might be done by the PMO,\n\n992\n00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:48,990\nit might be done by you as the project\nmanager in a procjectized environment.\n\n993\n00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,202\nBut in a functional organization,\n\n994\n00:49:51,202 --> 00:49:54,380\nthis is gonna be the functional\nmanager that do it.\n\n995\n00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,390\nSo this may be a sign again to\nsomebody else that we planned\n\n996\n00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,980\nthat resource management when\nwe're gonna need those people.\n\n997\n00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,440\nAnd then acquire,\ndevelop and manage the team.\n\n998\n00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,490\nProject communications management, this is\nsteered by the project manager but might\n\n999\n00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:13,370\nbe carried out by marketing people if you\nhave them or communications personnel.\n\n1000\n00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:17,270\nThese are how we communicate information\nabout the project as it's ongoing.\n\n1001\n00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,765\nWe don't need that in initiating and\nclosing, but\n\n1002\n00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:22,502\nwe need it throughout the active\nphases of the project.\n\n1003\n00:50:24,696 --> 00:50:26,530\nProject risk management.\n\n1004\n00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:30,680\nIf you've ever worked for an insurance\ncompany, then you've dealt with risk.\n\n1005\n00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,800\nAt an insurance company, you can't throw\na pencil down a hall without hitting\n\n1006\n00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,380\nsomebody with a master's\ndegree in Risk Management.\n\n1007\n00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,120\nSo very common there.\n\n1008\n00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,380\nBut in any high-dollar project,\nyou're gonna have a risk manager.\n\n1009\n00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,050\nIn a low dollar project you\nmay be the risk manager.\n\n1010\n00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:49,200\nYou've gotta evaluate what risks\nyour project is exposed to and\n\n1011\n00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,150\nhow you handle them.\n\n1012\n00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,560\nSo that's what you see here.\n\n1013\n00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,780\nPlan for risk management.\n\n1014\n00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,080\nIdentify risks.\n\n1015\n00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,510\nDo the analysis.\n\n1016\n00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,800\nPlan risk responses.\n\n1017\n00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,399\nThese are all activities centered\naround that idea of managing risk.\n\n1018\n00:51:01,711 --> 00:51:02,820\nAll right.\n\n1019\n00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,360\nProject procurement management,\n\n1020\n00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,070\nthis is one that was added in the PIMBAC\n4th Edition, this used to not exist.\n\n1021\n00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,250\nThat this used to be grouped\nunder the costs, right.\n\n1022\n00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,270\nBy procurement, we mean getting things.\n\n1023\n00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,129\nGetting materials.\n\n1024\n00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:16,872\n>> Resources.\n\n1025\n00:51:16,872 --> 00:51:19,240\n>> Yeah and\nit centers around spending money.\n\n1026\n00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,610\nSo that used to fall under cost.\n\n1027\n00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:25,340\nThey split it out though, because now the\nprocurement management includes contracts.\n\n1028\n00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,550\nSo if you have negotiators or\n\n1029\n00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,680\ncontract managers, these\nare the people that are handling that.\n\n1030\n00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,210\nDrafting the contract, putting them\nout for bid, getting responses,\n\n1031\n00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,840\nsigning off on the contracts.\n\n1032\n00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,940\nSo if you have had previous\nexposure to the PIMBAC\n\n1033\n00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,070\nthen this might be a change\nthat you have to get used to.\n\n1034\n00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,860\nIf you're all new though, this is great.\n\n1035\n00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,600\nIt's its own little thing, and\nit kinda sets separate here.\n\n1036\n00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,000\nSame thing with stakeholder management.\n\n1037\n00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,910\nThat used to be the part\nof the communications,\n\n1038\n00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,320\nnow it's its own separate entity.\n\n1039\n00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,290\nSo, identifying stakeholders and so on.\n\n1040\n00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:59,690\nThis is something a project manager will\ntypically do, but you might have somebody\n\n1041\n00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,380\nseparate that does that,\nlike the PMO that might identify that.\n\n1042\n00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,630\nSo these are the knowledge areas and\n\n1043\n00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,860\nnotice how they're numbered,\nsee how it starts at four?\n\n1044\n00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,094\nYou might say, well,\nwhere's one, two, and three?\n\n1045\n00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:14,896\nWell, they're actually numbered based on\nthe section of the PIMBAC that covers\n\n1046\n00:52:14,896 --> 00:52:17,950\nthem, not so\nmuch just their entity itself.\n\n1047\n00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:22,937\nSo there's actually 10 of them and\neach one is just identifying a different\n\n1048\n00:52:22,937 --> 00:52:27,001\nknowledge are inside of our project and\nkind of what they do, so\n\n1049\n00:52:27,001 --> 00:52:30,913\nit's important and\nit helps us to kind of break things down,\n\n1050\n00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:35,235\nbecause otherwise,\nit's an overwhelming amount of processes.\n\n1051\n00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,072\n>> Yeah.\n\n1052\n00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:38,637\n>> And\nthese numbers that you see like 6.1,\n\n1053\n00:52:38,637 --> 00:52:41,741\n6.5\n>> If I wanna learn more about controlling\n\n1054\n00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:46,850\nthe schedule, I go in the PIMBAC to\n6.7 section six sub paragraph seven.\n\n1055\n00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:47,570\nWhatever it is.\n\n1056\n00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,540\nSection seven.\n\n1057\n00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,340\nAnd you'll find it and that's where it'll\nteach you how to control the schedule.\n\n1058\n00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,640\nSo use this as a guide.\n\n1059\n00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,420\nWe're gonna use it all\nthroughout the show.\n\n1060\n00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,630\nSo during the show when we start a new\nsection we'll bring this chart back up and\n\n1061\n00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,090\nsay all right, we're about to tackle 5.1.\n\n1062\n00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:06,510\nWe're in the planning phase,\nthis falls under scope management,\n\n1063\n00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:08,050\nas far as our knowledge area.\n\n1064\n00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,400\nSo you'll see a lot of that.\n\n1065\n00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,448\nBut just be aware there's a lot of them,\nright.\n\n1066\n00:53:12,448 --> 00:53:17,651\n47 processes all together,\nfive process groups\n\n1067\n00:53:17,651 --> 00:53:22,630\nwhich are our phases in the project,\nall right.\n\n1068\n00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:26,891\nAnd then, ten knowledge areas which\nare kind of like that job role.\n\n1069\n00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:27,588\n>> Job role.\n\n1070\n00:53:27,588 --> 00:53:28,420\n>> Yep.\n\n1071\n00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,850\nSo, very important stuff.\n\n1072\n00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:34,170\nSo, you'll see that when I study or\neven right here in the show,\n\n1073\n00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,933\nI always keep this handy.\n\n1074\n00:53:35,933 --> 00:53:37,690\nI've got a print out, right.\n\n1075\n00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,330\nThis kind of thing, go ahead and print\none out right now it's super handy for\n\n1076\n00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,880\nmeasuring your studies, seeing where you\nneed to focus on, keeping things straight.\n\n1077\n00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,432\nIt fits on a page,\nit's a little small but.\n\n1078\n00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:51,365\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As I get older it becomes harder to\n\n1079\n00:53:51,365 --> 00:53:54,880\nread but\ndefinitely something good to have.\n\n1080\n00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,690\nUseful thing to keep you straight, so.\n\n1081\n00:53:58,052 --> 00:54:01,130\nAll right so,\nreally when we start tackling the exam and\n\n1082\n00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,820\nhow we manage the project,\nit's these 47 processes.\n\n1083\n00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,250\nNow, throughout the show,\nwe're gonna show you how each and\n\n1084\n00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,010\nevery process works,\nhow you're supposed to use them.\n\n1085\n00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:13,860\nAnd then it's up to you to figure\nout which ones you need and\n\n1086\n00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,900\nwhich ones you don't, so.\n\n1087\n00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,732\nThis is a pretty good spot for\nus to stop and take a break and\n\n1088\n00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:21,389\nwhat I'd like to do is come back for\none more segment.\n\n1089\n00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:24,240\nAnd I want to show you guys\nan example of a process.\n\n1090\n00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,670\nWhat makes up a process,\nhow they work and then\n\n1091\n00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:31,175\nin our later shows will actually start to\ntackle the feature process, all right.\n\n1092\n00:54:31,175 --> 00:54:32,720\nRonnie anything else to\nadd before the break?\n\n1093\n00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,940\n>> No that's a lot of material.\n\n1094\n00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,500\n>> Yeah, it definitely adds up.\n\n1095\n00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,140\nAlright ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n1096\n00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,965\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n1097\n00:54:39,965 --> 00:54:43,481\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1098\n00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:48,642\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1099\n00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:53,514\nSo before the break we were talking\nabout the 47 different processors that\n\n1100\n00:54:53,514 --> 00:54:55,340\nmake up the PMI framework and\n\n1101\n00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:00,962\nI feel like it's Baskin Robbins right 47\ndifferent flavors of terrible yogurt.\n\n1102\n00:55:00,962 --> 00:55:06,450\nSo [LAUGH] anyhow, we have all these\nprocesses, and it can be a lot.\n\n1103\n00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,570\nIt can be overwhelming to look at it.\n\n1104\n00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:11,260\nBut at the end of the day it's\nreally not that bad because most of\n\n1105\n00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,640\nthe processes follow a very\nsimilar pattern, all right.\n\n1106\n00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,810\nPMI tries to make it as easy as possible.\n\n1107\n00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,400\nSo, let me show you an example.\n\n1108\n00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,230\nSo I've pulled up here develop\na project management plan.\n\n1109\n00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:23,690\nThis is one of the first\nprocesses that we run.\n\n1110\n00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,920\nAnd you'll see that it's\nmade up of three pieces.\n\n1111\n00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,300\nAn input, a set of tools and\ntechniques and an output.\n\n1112\n00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,470\nBasically we have certain data\nthat we feed into the process.\n\n1113\n00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,800\nSomething we should already have, right.\n\n1114\n00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,356\nAnd then we have tools and techniques that\nwe apply to that data that then creates\n\n1115\n00:55:41,356 --> 00:55:45,300\na certain output, and all 47\nprocesses follow that same model, so\n\n1116\n00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,770\nI just kind of made it a little\nbit more generic here, right?\n\n1117\n00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:54,166\nSo under inputs, you'll have a series\nof different inputs and they change,\n\n1118\n00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:59,645\ndepending on what The process is, if this\nis the very first process that we deal\n\n1119\n00:55:59,645 --> 00:56:05,310\nwith, develop a project charter, there's\nnot really much of an input to have.\n\n1120\n00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:10,220\nWe don't have a lot of documents, but some\nof the inputs aren't documents per se,\n\n1121\n00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,200\nbut are other elements.\n\n1122\n00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,620\nAnd so, remember how we talked about\norganizational process assets,\n\n1123\n00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,170\nand enterprise environmental factors,\nright?\n\n1124\n00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:23,229\nLet me go back to my notes, those\nwere two things that we talked about.\n\n1125\n00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:30,130\nAs things that could influence our\nproject, these guys right here.\n\n1126\n00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:35,790\nWell, those serve as inputs to almost\nevery single process, not every one.\n\n1127\n00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:37,020\nBut almost everyone.\n\n1128\n00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:42,580\nEvery process, needs to be put\nin the context of your company.\n\n1129\n00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,350\nThe organizational process assets,\nthat your company has,\n\n1130\n00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,890\nyour way of doing things.\n\n1131\n00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,110\nAnd then your enterprise\nenvironmental factors,\n\n1132\n00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,430\nthe requirements of your business.\n\n1133\n00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,550\nIf you're a medical organization\ndealing with medical records,\n\n1134\n00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:57,230\nyou have to follow HIPAA compliance or\nsomething like that.\n\n1135\n00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,625\nThose are gonna influence\nhow you handle that process.\n\n1136\n00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:06,080\nSo, you will see those two as inputs\nto almost every single process,\n\n1137\n00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,120\nyou'll see it very frequently, all right?\n\n1138\n00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,570\nSo there's usually only\na couple of unique inputs, and\n\n1139\n00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:15,800\nthen you'll have really unique tools and\ntechniques, right?\n\n1140\n00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,385\nDifferent tools and techniques, you use to\ncreate the output that you're looking for.\n\n1141\n00:57:19,385 --> 00:57:22,131\nSo if I have a process,\n\n1142\n00:57:22,131 --> 00:57:27,780\nlike Develop a Project Charter, right?\n\n1143\n00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:33,200\nMy inputs are going to be things that I\nneed, to build a Project Charter, right?\n\n1144\n00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,370\nDevelop a Project Charter Process,\nthat's to create a project charter.\n\n1145\n00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,950\nSo, what's my output gonna be?\n\n1146\n00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:40,060\nThe project charter.\n\n1147\n00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,420\nIt just makes sense, all right?\n\n1148\n00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,880\nI wanna create a project charter.\n\n1149\n00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,480\nNow, what is a project charter?\n\n1150\n00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,650\nWell, we're gonna talk about\nit in the next episode, but\n\n1151\n00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:52,430\njust to sum it up briefly, it is and what\ndefines the basic idea of your project.\n\n1152\n00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:53,610\nWhat you're gonna be doing?\n\n1153\n00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:57,750\nBut most importantly,\nit's where your sponsor signs off,\n\n1154\n00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,810\ngiving authority to the project manager.\n\n1155\n00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,820\nSo, this is where a project\nmanager gets their authority.\n\n1156\n00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,540\nThis is the single most important\ndocument in your entire document, right?\n\n1157\n00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,200\nSo, I wanna create that document.\n\n1158\n00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,350\nWell, if I wanna create the document,\nwhat do I need?\n\n1159\n00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:14,020\nI need a couple of things.\n\n1160\n00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,630\nI need a statement of work.\n\n1161\n00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:18,450\nI need a business case\njustifying the project.\n\n1162\n00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:22,340\nI need any agreements, that have been made\nbetween my company and other companies,\n\n1163\n00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,690\nas a part of this project.\n\n1164\n00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,850\nThose are things that I need.\n\n1165\n00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:29,390\nBecause they're gonna\nbecome part of the charter.\n\n1166\n00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:32,780\nAnd then I need my enterprise\nenvironmental factors,\n\n1167\n00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,930\nand organizational process assets.\n\n1168\n00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:37,310\nThese things that influence my project.\n\n1169\n00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,469\nI take all of that as information.\n\n1170\n00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,580\nAnd then, I apply two things.\n\n1171\n00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,110\nNumber 1, Expert Judgement.\n\n1172\n00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,350\nExpert Judgement is your brain.\n\n1173\n00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:53,220\nUse your brain, use your common sense,\nuse what you know as a project manager.\n\n1174\n00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,490\nI need to take all of these and\nwrite them up in a document.\n\n1175\n00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,310\nSo, I need to know grammar.\n\n1176\n00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,840\n[LAUGH] I need to know\nbasic writing skills.\n\n1177\n00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,340\nThose are things that fall\nunder Expert Judgement.\n\n1178\n00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:06,050\nI also need Facilitation Techniques.\n\n1179\n00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:10,220\nI need to facilitate the needs\nof all of these things.\n\n1180\n00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:15,750\nI need to combine them, in a way where\nall of my requirements are satisfied,\n\n1181\n00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:19,550\nwhere I meet my legal requirements,\nunder enterprise environmental factors.\n\n1182\n00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:23,930\nI used the tools provided by the company,\nunder organizational process assets.\n\n1183\n00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:28,270\nI incorporate a business case,\nthat shows this project is worthwhile.\n\n1184\n00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,180\nI put all that stuff together.\n\n1185\n00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,600\nAnd I might have to\nnegotiate a little bit, or\n\n1186\n00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,910\nwhatever to facilitate getting all\nof those working hand and hand.\n\n1187\n00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,510\nAnd when they're done.\n\n1188\n00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:41,650\nI create a document that's called\na Project Charter, that lists exactly\n\n1189\n00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:44,150\nwhat my project is going to be doing and\nat a high level at this stage.\n\n1190\n00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:48,480\nBecause, we haven't done planning yet, and\nI get my sponsor to sign off on it, right?\n\n1191\n00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:54,050\nSo, the process is really telling us,\nhow to create a Project Charter, right?\n\n1192\n00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,150\nI can't create a Project Charter\nwithout these things, and\n\n1193\n00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:00,200\nthen here's what I do to them\nto create that final charter.\n\n1194\n01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,701\nThis is how every process is mapped out.\n\n1195\n01:00:02,701 --> 01:00:06,830\nSo all 47 of them,\nhave a diagram just like this.\n\n1196\n01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:11,930\nAnd they're easy to spot in the pinbock,\nbecause this is what they look like.\n\n1197\n01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,240\nSo, you will always have a set of inputs.\n\n1198\n01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,180\nYou'll have a set of tools and techniques\nyou use, with the data from inputs, and\n\n1199\n01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,650\nthen your outputs.\n\n1200\n01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,840\nTypically you'll only have one output,\nsometimes you have more than one.\n\n1201\n01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,645\nIt just depends on which process it is.\n\n1202\n01:00:24,645 --> 01:00:28,800\nBut, the output that you get,\nlike this Project Management Plan,\n\n1203\n01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,170\nwill then serve as an input for\nother processes.\n\n1204\n01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,390\nSo, here in Project Management Plan,\nif I just skim ahead and try and\n\n1205\n01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:36,845\nfind the next one here.\n\n1206\n01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:41,890\nSee how Project Management Plan,\nis an input for\n\n1207\n01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:45,750\nthe direct and\nproject management work process.\n\n1208\n01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:49,310\nSo, you'll see that very commonly where\none output, becomes the input for\n\n1209\n01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:50,470\nanother process.\n\n1210\n01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:53,630\nAnd that means that you can't move\nforward, until you finish that seal,\n\n1211\n01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:55,770\nsome of them fall chronologically.\n\n1212\n01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:56,730\nI tried to map them out once.\n\n1213\n01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,682\nHave you ever tried this Ronnie?\n\n1214\n01:00:57,682 --> 01:00:58,420\n>> No [LAUGH].\n\n1215\n01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:03,180\n>> There's 47 of the things so if you try\nand map them out, it's a spaghetti mess,\n\n1216\n01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,980\nreally fast right cuz they're so\nintertwined.\n\n1217\n01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,650\nSo, we don't normally\nlook at them that way.\n\n1218\n01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:11,290\nMore commonly we look at\nthem in terms of that\n\n1219\n01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:15,700\nchart that I brought up earlier, here.\n\n1220\n01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:19,220\nWhere we say, I can't really validate and\n\n1221\n01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:23,290\ncontrol my scope,\nunless I have already created it, right?\n\n1222\n01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:26,650\nSo, these scope activities right here.\n\n1223\n01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:30,960\nThese processes, have to complete\nbefore these processes can kick off.\n\n1224\n01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:37,640\nIt makes sense, where they fall\nin the life cycle of the project.\n\n1225\n01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,670\nSo, just be aware while it does look a bit\noverwhelming with all of these different\n\n1226\n01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:44,400\nprocesses, and every one of them\nhaving a different requirement.\n\n1227\n01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,340\nThat at the end of the day, it really\ndoes break down to something simple.\n\n1228\n01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:52,820\nYou've got various inputs,\nwhich almost always include\n\n1229\n01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,620\norganizational process assets and\nenterprise environmental factors.\n\n1230\n01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,570\nYou'll see those over and over again.\n\n1231\n01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:01,840\nYou have tools and techniques, which\nalmost always includes expert judgment.\n\n1232\n01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,960\nUse your head, right?\n\n1233\n01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,550\nAs well as other elements that we'll see.\n\n1234\n01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:09,560\nAnd then the output, typically matches\nwhatever the name of the process is.\n\n1235\n01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,740\nSo, if the process is telling me\nto develop a stakeholder matrix,\n\n1236\n01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,540\nthen that's gonna be my output\nas a stakeholder matrix, and\n\n1237\n01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:21,660\nso that kind of makes things\na little bit easier to deal with.\n\n1238\n01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:26,120\nAll right, so that's kind of a preview for\nwhat the processes are.\n\n1239\n01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,490\nEvery show following this,\n\n1240\n01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:31,880\nall the other shows that we're gonna do\nare gonna center around these processes.\n\n1241\n01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,380\nSo we'll take a process, and we'll\ntalk about what all the inputs are, so\n\n1242\n01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,580\nwe have to understand those?\n\n1243\n01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,620\nAnd then the tools and\n\n1244\n01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:43,290\ntechniques we're gonna use,\nwith the data that we're inputting.\n\n1245\n01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:46,580\nAnd then,\nhow to create that final product, and\n\n1246\n01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:51,200\neach one kind of leading up to some way of\nmanaging and moving the project forward?\n\n1247\n01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,300\nThe only part that really deviates is when\nwe get into the execution, because there\n\n1248\n01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:59,500\nwe're doing a lot of monitoring, and so\nour inputs are gonna be status updates.\n\n1249\n01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,753\nAnd our outputs will oftentimes\nbe more status updates [LAUGH].\n\n1250\n01:03:02,753 --> 01:03:05,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> So there will be status updates with\n\n1251\n01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,910\nthe possibility of change tickets,\nif we've\n\n1252\n01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:11,780\ndeviated from where we're supposed to be,\nif we're behind schedule or whatever.\n\n1253\n01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:14,280\nWe'll have change tickets that\nare us trying to correct,\n\n1254\n01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,380\nto control the environment,\nput it back on schedule, all right?\n\n1255\n01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:20,270\nSo, we'll see all of that stuff as we\ngo through the later episodes, but\n\n1256\n01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:22,070\nat a simple level, this is it.\n\n1257\n01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,510\nIt's pretty cool,\nit really does work well.\n\n1258\n01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:30,000\nAll right, well, Ronnie,\nthat's probably it for this episode.\n\n1259\n01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,654\nWe just kind of wanted\nto cover the basics.\n\n1260\n01:03:31,654 --> 01:03:32,900\n>> Right.\n>> We're ready to move into\n\n1261\n01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,330\nthe specific stuff, but we don't\nhave much time left in this episode.\n\n1262\n01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:37,278\nSo, why don't we wrap it up here?\n\n1263\n01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:41,600\nI do wanna remind everybody,\nif you have any questions on this stuff,\n\n1264\n01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,800\nkeep in mind that live during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1265\n01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,840\nYou'll see our video screen, and\nthe chat

00:00:53,290\n>> I have.\n\n16\n00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,630\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,590\n>> That was the first band\n\n18\n00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,090\nI could think of.\n\n19\n00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,160\nThat was ridiculous.\n\n20\n00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,685\nCreed.\n>> Yeah.\n\n21\n00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:01,380\n[LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] Now that I have time\nto think about it I would have gone with\n\n22\n00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,970\nNickelback.\n\n23\n00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,090\nSo welcome back to another episode\nof Project Management Professional.\n\n24\n00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,280\nOur first two episodes that we filmed,\nthey were centered around just like\n\n25\n00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,030\ngeneral project management concepts and\nsome of the ideas of the PMI's\n\n26\n00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,880\nterminology definitions and\njust general things we needed to know.\n\n27\n00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,820\nToday, we're actually gonna start\nthe project management process, all right?\n\n28\n00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,680\nSo, as far as what\nyou're actually expected\n\n29\n00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,940\nto do out there in the real world,\ntoday is really gonna mark that.\n\n30\n00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,830\nAnd, the PMBOK,\nit is a wealth of information.\n\n31\n00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,010\nIt's packed full of all sorts of stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,472\nBut it's not organized chronologically.\n\n33\n00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:39,110\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n34\n00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,839\n>> And\nI think we showed that in an episode.\n\n35\n00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:44,120\nWhere there's things that happened at\nthe beginning of the project might be at\n\n36\n00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,380\nthe very end of the PMBOK,\nand so what we're gonna do\n\n37\n00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,760\nis we're gonna rearrange things\nto fit chronological order.\n\n38\n00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,430\nHow a project starts and how we go\nthrough things in a normal project.\n\n39\n00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,490\nNow every project's a little different,\nand so\n\n40\n00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,690\nin your environment you might\nneed to rearrange some of this.\n\n41\n00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,440\nBut I think for the most part we're\ngonna be able to go through this and\n\n42\n00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,520\nyou kind of cover the way that\na lot of typical projects run.\n\n43\n00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,900\n>> Yeah.\nWhen we start talking about this idea,\n\n44\n00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,590\nwe're actually beginning with those\nbigger phases in terms of projects here,\n\n45\n00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,950\nwith the idea of the initiation.\n\n46\n00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,410\nAnd then we go into the idea\nof the planning stage, and\n\n47\n00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,150\nthen the controlling and\nmonitoring, I missed one, didn't I?\n\n48\n00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,660\nPlanning, oh no.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n49\n00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,280\n>> Initiation, planning, controlling.\n\n50\n00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,200\n>> Executing.\n\n51\n00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,290\n>> Executing, controlling, and monitoring,\nand of course the idea of closing as well.\n\n52\n00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,120\nSo we're gonna spend this\nfirst particular series or\n\n53\n00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,935\nepisode here on the idea of initiation.\n\n54\n00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:37,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n55\n00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,570\nAll right, now.\nLet me go back to the chart that we\n\n56\n00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,830\nbrought up in a previous episode.\n\n57\n00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,710\nThis guy right here.\n\n58\n00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,080\nBasically the guide map to\nrunning a project, right?\n\n59\n00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,213\nWhile the PMBOK itself was not organized\nin chronological order, this is.\n\n60\n00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:51,762\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n61\n00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:55,065\n>> When a project runs we\nstart with initiating and\n\n62\n00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:59,905\nwe go from left to right all the way\nto closing, with the remembering that\n\n63\n00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:01,165\nexecuting and monitoring-\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:02,645\n>> Those basically occur at the same time.\n\n65\n00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:04,478\nSo, when a project is starting,\n\n66\n00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:07,497\nwe're staring here in\nthe initiating process group.\n\n67\n00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:11,262\nNow it happens to be one of\nthe smaller ones in closing, so\n\n68\n00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:13,810\nit's kind of easy one to grasp.\n\n69\n00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,570\nWe're gonna start we've got two processes,\nthere's develop a project charter and\n\n70\n00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,180\nthen way down here identify stakeholders.\n\n71\n00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,240\nWell, you can't identify stakeholders\nuntil you have a charter cuz\n\n72\n00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,740\nyou really can't do anything until\nyou have a charter in place.\n\n73\n00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,680\nSo, this is the actual first\nstep of a project right here,\n\n74\n00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,420\ndeveloping the project charter.\n\n75\n00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,390\nSo, every project starts with an idea.\n\n76\n00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:45,050\nIt's not a project yet, it's just an idea,\nand people have tons of ideas.\n\n77\n00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,760\nSome are good, most are bad, right?\n\n78\n00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,086\nAnd so, a lot of things never\nmake it out of the idea stage.\n\n79\n00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:54,950\nI was thinking of like Homer Simpson,\nwhere he has all these different ideas and\n\n80\n00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,180\nmost of them are not good.\n\n81\n00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,490\nSomebody has to be that gateway,\n\n82\n00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,160\nthat person who sits in between\nan idea becoming a reality, right?\n\n83\n00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,370\nAnd so, every project kind of\nstarts out that way, as an idea.\n\n84\n00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,050\nThink of something, and\n\n85\n00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,060\nthen, if it's got merit, we decide to\nmove forward with it as a project.\n\n86\n00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,880\nNow, how do we know if it's got merit?\n\n87\n00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,940\nWell, unfortunately we need to gather\nsome information together, and\n\n88\n00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,800\nby the time we're at that point we're\nreally already in project mode.\n\n89\n00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,570\nSo, someone has an idea,\nand they take that idea and\n\n90\n00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,490\nthey turn it into what's\ncalled a project charter.\n\n91\n00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,490\nAnd a project charter's just a document.\n\n92\n00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,263\nIt's a document that basically kicks\noff a project, it starts the project.\n\n93\n00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:41,139\nSo, you don't have a project until\nthe charter has been drafted and\n\n94\n00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,935\nthat's why it is this\nfirst step on the journey.\n\n95\n00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:47,116\n>> Yeah, this is where we start talking\nabout the idea of formalization, right?\n\n96\n00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:50,230\nThat we're really gonna put\nthings down on paper and\n\n97\n00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,332\nthat way we can refer to it as\nthe project begins to develop along, and\n\n98\n00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:59,460\nwe use that as really kind of the guide\nto help us to push everything along here.\n\n99\n00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,510\nSo in getting this first step done, it's\nby far one of the most important things\n\n100\n00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,250\nthat we wanna spend time and\ntake a look at, and\n\n101\n00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,330\nmake sure that we understand what\nthe purpose of this thing is and\n\n102\n00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,047\nhow it helps us throughout\nthe remainder of our project.\n\n103\n00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:17,520\n>> All right, so how does somebody\neven come up with the idea, right?\n\n104\n00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,950\nSo somebody, usually an executive in\nyour company is sitting around and\n\n105\n00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,800\nthey have an idea they say,\nour company would be better if XYZ.\n\n106\n00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,330\nIf we did this.\n\n107\n00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,660\nSo maybe your company\ndon't have a website.\n\n108\n00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,180\nSo an executive is sitting around saying,\n\n109\n00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,900\nI bet we're losing customers\nbecause we don't have a website.\n\n110\n00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,260\nPeople see we don't have that,\nand they think we're antiquated.\n\n111\n00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,210\nSo we want a company website.\n\n112\n00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,340\nSo they've got this idea, right.\n\n113\n00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,320\nIs it a good idea, is it a bad idea?\n\n114\n00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,500\nThat's not, no, a this point.\n\n115\n00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,030\nIt's just an idea.\n\n116\n00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,320\nAnd so if they're powerful enough in\nthe company, if they control resources,\n\n117\n00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,640\nif they can authorize work,\nthen they can kick off a project.\n\n118\n00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,660\nAnd they say all right I need\nto get this project started.\n\n119\n00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,750\nAnd if there's a PMO, a Project Management\nOrganization, they can go to the PMO, or\n\n120\n00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,210\nProject Management Office.\n\n121\n00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,190\nThey can go to the PMO, and\nthey can say, all right,\n\n122\n00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,440\nhere's this project I want done and\nI'm the Vice President of marketing so\n\n123\n00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,230\nI got the authority,\nlet's do this project.\n\n124\n00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,270\nThe PMO can then make that decision\nwhether or not the project can actually go\n\n125\n00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,690\nthrough, we can start to\nkick things off from there.\n\n126\n00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,540\nOr, maybe you don't have a formal\nenvironment like that, maybe it's a little\n\n127\n00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,830\nmore like here, at ITPro TV where\nwe have a fairly small office,\n\n128\n00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,815\nnot a ton of employees, and so if any\none of us has an idea we just say it.\n\n129\n00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:37,020\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hey Ronnie,\n\n130\n00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,225\nI think it'd be a really good idea if,\nwell, like our Roku channel, right?\n\n131\n00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:42,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> We'll use the Roku\n\n132\n00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,440\nchannel as an example.\n\n133\n00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,160\nWhen we first launched our company,\nwe didn't plan on doing a Roku channel.\n\n134\n00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,820\nOne of the other gentlemen here,\nTim, came to me and\n\n135\n00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,060\nsaid, I really think we\nshould have a Roku channel.\n\n136\n00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,880\nI think people would like to\nwatch these shows on their TV and\n\n137\n00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,630\nthey don't want to have to\ntether to a computer to do it.\n\n138\n00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,950\nRoku boxes are cheap, their inexpensive,\nlet's do that, let's get a Roku channel.\n\n139\n00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,210\nAnd I said, well,\nlet's get the company launched,\n\n140\n00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,040\nlet's do this stuff first and\nthen do a Roku channel.\n\n141\n00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,810\nBut at the end I said, well, if it's not\nthat big of a deal we can roll forward.\n\n142\n00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,880\nLet's find out more.\n\n143\n00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,680\nAll right?\n\n144\n00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,210\nThat right there,\nthat conversation between Tim and\n\n145\n00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,540\nI, that was what kicked off that project.\n\n146\n00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,670\nThat was what kind of started it.\n\n147\n00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,370\nThat's where the idea came from,\nthe idea came from Tim, and\n\n148\n00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,160\nthen we decided to formalize it.\n\n149\n00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,700\nNow you formalize it by creating\na charter, a document that says we\n\n150\n00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,740\nare going, at a minimum, to look at\nthe possibility of doing this and\n\n151\n00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,610\nhere's the authority\nthat we assigned to it.\n\n152\n00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,880\nSo the project charter can start from\na conversation at a water cooler,\n\n153\n00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,840\nit can start from being written on\na cocktail napkin at a restaurant.\n\n154\n00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,670\nBut, it's got to get\nformal credence somewhere.\n\n155\n00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,713\nAnd the project charter is what does it.\n\n156\n00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:57,721\nLet's take a look at the process itself,\nwhich I've got a drawing of here.\n\n157\n00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:03,000\nSo we have the develop\na project charter process.\n\n158\n00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,030\nAnd it's got a number of\ninputs that feed into it,\n\n159\n00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,150\nthat we then work with to finally create\nthis one document, the project charter and\n\n160\n00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,810\nwe'll take a look at that\ndocument here in a little bit.\n\n161\n00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,990\nYou can't create the document\nthough without certain information.\n\n162\n00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,500\n>> All right.\n\n163\n00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,480\n>> And if you just had a conversation\nat a water cooler you likely don't\n\n164\n00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,760\nhave all that information.\n\n165\n00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,332\nSo that's where we need to start\ngathering our data together to get ready.\n\n166\n00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:26,350\nAll right?\n\n167\n00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,050\nAnd so you'll see some of the different\nthings that we want to feed into it.\n\n168\n00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,070\nThe first is probably the most important.\n\n169\n00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,040\nIt's called the project statement of work,\nand\n\n170\n00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,030\nthis is the summary of what we want done.\n\n171\n00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,930\nSo in that conversation that Tim and\nI had,\n\n172\n00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,920\nit was Tim saying, I wanna have a Roku\nchannel with all of our episodes on it.\n\n173\n00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,080\nSo that people can watch it.\n\n174\n00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680\nSo that our customers can watch it.\n\n175\n00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,460\nAlright.\n\n176\n00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,740\nThat's our statement of work.\n\n177\n00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,110\nIt doesn't have to be complex.\n\n178\n00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,350\nWe don't know all the details yet.\n\n179\n00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,010\nWe don't know what all is involved.\n\n180\n00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,250\nSo we just say,\nhere's what we're looking to do.\n\n181\n00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,510\nThat's what a statement of work is.\n\n182\n00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,920\nIt's supposed to be a high-level judgement\nof whether the project is successful.\n\n183\n00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,310\nAt the end of this project,\n\n184\n00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,810\ndo I have a Roku channel where\nmy customers can watch the show?\n\n185\n00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,050\nGreat, we succeeded.\n\n186\n00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,200\nDo I no have that?\n\n187\n00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,360\nThen no, we failed.\n\n188\n00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,272\nIt's a very,\nvery high level at this point.\n\n189\n00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:15,400\nRight?\nNon-committal,\n\n190\n00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,420\nthis might change during planning.\n\n191\n00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,519\nSo this is just the kind of first stab\nat what needs to be done in the project.\n\n192\n00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,005\nNow you'll frequently see a statement\nof work abbreviated as S-O-W.\n\n193\n00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:30,010\nSo they are not talking about sow or\n\n194\n00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,470\na kick, they are talking\nabout a statement of work.\n\n195\n00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,780\nAnd so you'll see it written that way and\n\n196\n00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,860\nthe statement of work does it kind of gets\nmade up, it's what somebody wants done.\n\n197\n00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,420\nAfter that, well let me jump\nover to the official P-M-I site.\n\n198\n00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,290\nRight?\nSo\n\n199\n00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,930\nwith PI they identify some of the things\nthe statement of work should contain.\n\n200\n00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,430\nRight?\n\n201\n00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,170\nAnd they highlight three things\nspecifically, there's a business need.\n\n202\n00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,800\nSo why do we feel the need do\nto this in the first place?\n\n203\n00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,300\nCuz it shouldn't just be something done\non a whim, there should be a response.\n\n204\n00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,210\nSo, maybe the business seed is\nwe have customers asking us hey,\n\n205\n00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,820\ncan we watch your shows\non the Roku channel.\n\n206\n00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,780\nWe'd love that if we could do that.\n\n207\n00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,040\nThere's our business need.\n\n208\n00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,510\nOr if we're losing customers.\n\n209\n00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,100\nCustomers are saying I'd do\nit if you had a Roku channel,\n\n210\n00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,105\notherwise I just don't want to subscribe.\n\n211\n00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:17,630\nRight?\n\n212\n00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,430\nNow we have a business need for\ndoing the Roku channel.\n\n213\n00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,580\nIt could just be on a whim though.\n\n214\n00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,550\nIf somebody is powerful\nenough in the company.\n\n215\n00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,990\nIf it's the president who says I don't\ncare if the customers want it or not,\n\n216\n00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,730\nwe're gonna do a Roku channel.\n\n217\n00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,170\nThere's our business need,\nbecause he said so.\n\n218\n00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,120\nSo business need is one thing that we need\nto have in that project charter in that\n\n219\n00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,403\nstatement of work.\n\n220\n00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:43,644\nRight?\nAnother thing is a product scope\n\n221\n00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,190\ndescription.\n\n222\n00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,849\nPMIA sounds really formal right here,\nbut again it's high level and\n\n223\n00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,223\nsubject to change.\n\n224\n00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:55,555\nA scope we'll talk about later\nis where we define exactly what\n\n225\n00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:59,520\nit is that's required\nof us in this project.\n\n226\n00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,740\nBut we don't necessarily know\nexactly what's required of us yet.\n\n227\n00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,430\nSo again this is a high level statement\nof what our scope is gonna be.\n\n228\n00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,660\nOur scope is, I wanna have a Roku channel,\nand I want that channel to have\n\n229\n00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,460\nevery one of our episodes on it, and\nI want it to have the live stream on it.\n\n230\n00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,600\nSo people can watch live, and I want\nit to have some free content in there.\n\n231\n00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,570\nSo that people who aren't subscribers\ncan at least see the channel and\n\n232\n00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,720\nwatch a few episodes.\n\n233\n00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,290\nKind of get an idea of how it works,\na free sample.\n\n234\n00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,390\nSo there's my requirements.\n\n235\n00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,500\nHigh level.\n\n236\n00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,320\nThere might be other things that we\nneed to figure out later on, but\n\n237\n00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,632\nhigh level, here's what we need.\n\n238\n00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,020\nAll right.\n\n239\n00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,620\nAnd then the last thing\nis a strategic plan.\n\n240\n00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,290\nThe strategic plan is how this is gonna\nbe leveraged within your company.\n\n241\n00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,920\nWhat's your plan for achieving this?\n\n242\n00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,480\nAre you gonna bring in contractors to do\nit, are you gonna try to do it in house?\n\n243\n00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,720\nAgain, high level, subject to change.\n\n244\n00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,930\nThis is all optional.\n\n245\n00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,880\nIt can just be a matter of sentences.\n\n246\n00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,720\nIt doesn't need to be some giant,\nformal thing in your statement of work.\n\n247\n00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,080\nBut the more information you have,\nthe better of you'll be.\n\n248\n00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,180\nNow in the initiation phase, we expect\nto not have much information and in fact\n\n249\n00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,070\nmost of the planning phase is spent\ngetting the information we didn't have.\n\n250\n00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,710\nSo don't feel like you have to\ngo crazy on a project charter.\n\n251\n00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,160\nThe goal when I make a project charter,\n\n252\n00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,440\nI want the entire charter to fit\non one side of a piece of paper.\n\n253\n00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,900\nRight.\nSo that charter should fit right here, and\n\n254\n00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,990\nincluding a signature block on the bottom.\n\n255\n00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,330\nSo I'm not talking about\na ton of information here.\n\n256\n00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,440\nSo really high level.\n\n257\n00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,050\n>> The overall goal right now, right,\n\n258\n00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,330\nis for us to establish we have\na mission in front of us here.\n\n259\n00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,400\nAnd that we know what that mission\nactually includes for us here.\n\n260\n00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,890\nSo bringing all those things together.\n\n261\n00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,930\nWhy we need it, in terms our business\nneed, the idea of scope, essentially\n\n262\n00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,440\ngiving us limitations or saying, this is\nwhat we really want to accomplish, and\n\n263\n00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,050\nthen lastly, why does fit in to\nthe overall reason why we also exist.\n\n264\n00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,940\nIs part of the idea of actually\ngetting this thing started.\n\n265\n00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,310\nThe statement of work very important for\nus at the beginning, cause if not,\n\n266\n00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,770\nthat can actually end up being so\ndiverse and\n\n267\n00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,940\nso vague that we go okay we'll start\nit at some time, we may do it.\n\n268\n00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,700\nBut here it actually gives us again,\n\n269\n00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,790\nthings that we can\naccomplish when we need to.\n\n270\n00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,470\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n271\n00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,650\nAll right, so our charter so far is\ngoing to contain the statement of work,\n\n272\n00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,760\nthe statement of what it is we want done.\n\n273\n00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,430\nAs a part of that, you'll typically\nhave your business case in there.\n\n274\n00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,860\nAnd PMI breaks that business case down\ninto a number of different things that it\n\n275\n00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,040\nmight be, right?\n\n276\n00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,160\nSo, my business case might be\nbecause the boss told me, all right?\n\n277\n00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,720\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,060\n>> But what are some of the other ones,\n\n279\n00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,440\nand if you're jotting down notes\nfeverishly in the background.\n\n280\n00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,210\nI've actually already kind of jotted\ndown some of these notes down in\n\n281\n00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,520\na file that I'll post with\nthe episode on the website.\n\n282\n00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,050\nI say that I'll make Nate,\nour producer, post it with the episode.\n\n283\n00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,520\nSo, anyhow, so I do have this.\n\n284\n00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,420\nLet's pull up my notes for a second so\nyou guys can see, that business case,\n\n285\n00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,010\ncan actually be made up of\na number of different things,\n\n286\n00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,790\nor typically it's just one thing, right?\n\n287\n00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,155\nI mentioned, for example, we might have\ncustomers that are asking for something.\n\n288\n00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:01,750\nRight?\n\n289\n00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,040\nThat would be customer request,\n\n290\n00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,114\ncustomers are asking hey, you guys at\nIT Pro TV, could you guys do IT training?\n\n291\n00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,960\nWe'd really like to see ITEL.\n\n292\n00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,510\nAll right, we really hadn't planned on it,\nbut if we get enough requests we'll do it.\n\n293\n00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,204\nCustomer requests leads to that project.\n\n294\n00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,120\nRight?\n\n295\n00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,170\nIt might be market demand.\n\n296\n00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,900\nIt might be that your competitors\nare selling more than your company\n\n297\n00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,835\nbecause they offer\na service that you don't.\n\n298\n00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:29,900\nRight?\nYou see this all the time with banks.\n\n299\n00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,750\nBanks that have online banking have\nmore customers than banks that don't.\n\n300\n00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,830\nAnd that's because people want online\nbanking they'll actually switch\n\n301\n00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,510\nbanks to get it.\n\n302\n00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,030\nOrganizational need.\n\n303\n00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,910\nThe project might be\nthe result of something that\n\n304\n00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,735\nhappens inside of your company,\nnot necessarily revenue generating.\n\n305\n00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:50,560\nRight?\nMaybe your company had ten employees, and\n\n306\n00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,360\nnow it's got 10,000.\n\n307\n00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,581\nAnd you're finding that your business\nprocesses that are in place,\n\n308\n00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,390\nmore designed for scale.\n\n309\n00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,550\nCan't handle that many employees.\n\n310\n00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,980\nSo your company needs to redesign.\n\n311\n00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,580\nRight.\n\n312\n00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,090\nYou see this with school boards.\n\n313\n00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,330\nSchool boards do this a lot.\n\n314\n00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,770\nWhere as the amount of children in\ntheir area starts to grow, or as new\n\n315\n00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,280\nsubdivisions and developments are built,\nthey have to readjust their bus routes.\n\n316\n00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,840\nRight?\n\n317\n00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,720\nSo they kick off a project,\nto reevaluate the bus routes and\n\n318\n00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,040\ndesign a new bus route, and\nthey do this every couple of years.\n\n319\n00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,640\nSo it's almost like an ongoing activity,\nbut it is a project they do every\n\n320\n00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,470\nfew years, to evaluate their current\nbus system, redesign their maps.\n\n321\n00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,290\nThe routes that the busses take\nto get the optimum efficiency.\n\n322\n00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,310\nSo that's an organizational.\n\n323\n00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,920\nThey don't make more money.\n\n324\n00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,250\nThey might save some money if\nthey do better bus routes or\n\n325\n00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,310\na little more efficient.\n\n326\n00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,310\nBut it's done because they\nhad an internal need.\n\n327\n00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,060\nThere might be a technological advance.\n\n328\n00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,950\n>> Yeah.\n\n329\n00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,780\n>> We see this in IT all the time.\n\n330\n00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,277\nYou've got all of your servers\ndeployed with Windows Server 2008, and\n\n331\n00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:57,362\nthen Windows Server 2008 R2 comes out.\n\n332\n00:15:57,362 --> 00:16:00,201\nOr Windows Server 2012, or\nnow Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n333\n00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:02,151\nRight?\nSoftware keeps updating.\n\n334\n00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,427\nYou need to update to stay under support.\n\n335\n00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:07,248\nToday, you have a very timely one.\n\n336\n00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:10,970\nThere's many companies out there\nthat are still running Windows XP.\n\n337\n00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,360\nMicrosoft ended support for\nthat last month.\n\n338\n00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,370\nNow, you've got to upgrade.\n\n339\n00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,570\nSo, you kick off a project\nbecause of technological advance.\n\n340\n00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,610\nOr, maybe there's just some new technology\nthat can save your company a ton of money.\n\n341\n00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,620\nYour dentist's office.\n\n342\n00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,120\nDentists, they can make false teeth and\nin the past they were made by hand.\n\n343\n00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,300\nSo there were techs that would sit\nthere and actually make these teeth.\n\n344\n00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,890\nNow they can use 3D printing machines.\n\n345\n00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,643\nJust [SOUND] generate a tooth and\nit's done much faster and\n\n346\n00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:43,606\nto a higher tolerance level.\n\n347\n00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:46,550\nSo, maybe they decide hey\nwe wanna implement this.\n\n348\n00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,150\nWe wanna go to these automated 3D\nprinters or whatever to generate teeth.\n\n349\n00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,650\nWell, they kick off a project to do that.\n\n350\n00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,140\nThis is my favorite one.\n\n351\n00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,703\n>> Legal requirements.\n\n352\n00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:58,680\n[LAUGH]\n>> Legal requirements.\n\n353\n00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,365\nYou create a project cuz\nthe government told you you had to.\n\n354\n00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:02,719\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n355\n00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,650\nWe saw these really big,\nwhat ten years ago,\n\n356\n00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,670\nwhen HIPAA complaints in\nthe US became really big.\n\n357\n00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,760\nAll of the hospitals across the United\nStates had to kick off projects to\n\n358\n00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,380\nbecome HIPAA compliant, or\nSarbanes-Oxley, or whatever.\n\n359\n00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,163\nThese are US ones, cuz we're in the US,\nbut in other countries,\n\n360\n00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:23,880\nI'm sure you guys have the same\nbureaucracy that we do.\n\n361\n00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,560\nSo then you probably have a different\nrequirements that you have to adhere to.\n\n362\n00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,980\nI was working for a bank in Seattle when\nthe state of Washington passed a law\n\n363\n00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,860\nthat said online gambling was illegal,\nright?\n\n364\n00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,970\nWell, no big deal.\n\n365\n00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,590\nYou can argue that banks\nare gambling institutions,\n\n366\n00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,070\nbut you're not a formally\nrecognized gambling institution.\n\n367\n00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,100\nSo, it didn't affect us, right?\n\n368\n00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,900\nWell, there was a rider\non the law that said,\n\n369\n00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,020\nif you're caught online gambling,\nyou can be penalized.\n\n370\n00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,000\nIt was like a misdemeanor,\nfelony or something like that.\n\n371\n00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,800\nAnd then it went on to say, if you\nprovide a computer to someone else, and\n\n372\n00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,540\nthey use it for gambling, you're guilty as\nwell because you provided the computer.\n\n373\n00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,160\n>> Yeah.\n\n374\n00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,200\n>> That set off an alarm, right?\n\n375\n00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,790\nThat meant that if one of our employees\nused one of our computers to go to online\n\n376\n00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,060\ngambling sites, we could be held\nresponsible for that, the bank.\n\n377\n00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,090\nAnd so we had to kick off a project\nto put in a new web filter\n\n378\n00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,600\nthat could block access\nto online gambling sites.\n\n379\n00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,930\nWe had to do our due diligence.\n\n380\n00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,320\nSo we didn't want to do that.\n\n381\n00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,350\nWeb filters slow down access,\nthey're hard to maintain, so\n\n382\n00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,700\nwe didn't want to implement that.\n\n383\n00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,751\nBut we had to, because these laws,\nif we didn't do it we were at risk.\n\n384\n00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:40,816\nAll right.\n\n385\n00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:44,159\nEcological impacts, or ecological impacts,\nhowever you wanna say it.\n\n386\n00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,050\nWe may find that there's things that we do\nwithin our organization that carry a large\n\n387\n00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:56,330\ncarbon footprint, or\njust aren't environmentally sound.\n\n388\n00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,920\nMcDonald's in the 80s.\n\n389\n00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,910\nIf you bought a Big Mac in the 80s,\nit came in a styrofoam clam shell,\n\n390\n00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,560\nand it was awesome, right?\n\n391\n00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,090\nKept the burger nice and warm.\n\n392\n00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,810\nAnd they said well,\nstyrofoam doesn't biodegrade,\n\n393\n00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,270\npeople in general were really opposed to\nit, and so they said we've gotta move.\n\n394\n00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,830\nAnd we'll switch to just papers or\n\n395\n00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,080\nwax wrappers now which,\ndo those even biodegrade?\n\n396\n00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,090\n>> Who knows?\n\n397\n00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,780\n>> So\nthey switched not because they wanted to,\n\n398\n00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,510\nnot because it saved them money,\nI think it ended up costing more.\n\n399\n00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,840\nBut because of the environmental and\necological impact.\n\n400\n00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,510\nAnd then lastly, social need, right?\n\n401\n00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,170\nSocial need is you're\ndoing something because\n\n402\n00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,140\nthere's a societal-\n>> Want.\n\n403\n00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,410\n>> Yeah, that take ITPro TV.\n\n404\n00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,740\nOur company,\n\n405\n00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,680\nthe reason we founded this whole thing\nwas IT training is incredibly expensive.\n\n406\n00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,470\nAnd if you are already in\nIT it's not a big deal.\n\n407\n00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,080\nYou get your company to pay for it.\n\n408\n00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,670\nSo you can absorb that\nlarge training cost.\n\n409\n00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,230\nThat's why the cost is so high.\n\n410\n00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,860\nBut if you're just getting started in IT-\n>> Yeah.\n\n411\n00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,450\n>> You can't afford those classes,\nthey're too expensive.\n\n412\n00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,240\nSo we wanted to create something that was\nlower cost that could be affordable for\n\n413\n00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,020\npeople who are career\nchangers that kind of thing.\n\n414\n00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,610\nAnd so that was a social need.\n\n415\n00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,120\nPeople out there wanted this,\nthere wasn't somebody that provided it, so\n\n416\n00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,410\nwe stepped in to do it.\n\n417\n00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,750\nNow, it could be there's\nother social needs.\n\n418\n00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,110\nThere's a lot of organizations that\ndo charity outreach and stuff.\n\n419\n00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,990\nAnd those things are, again,\nthey're not doing it to make money,\n\n420\n00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,010\nthey're not doing it cuz\nit helps their business.\n\n421\n00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,060\nWell, I guess they get\na little PR out of it, right?\n\n422\n00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,140\nBut for the most part of the deal\nbecause they want to fill a social need.\n\n423\n00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,920\nAll right, so those are all possible\nreasons that we might kick off a project.\n\n424\n00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,170\nAnyone of those and\nthere's even more just aren't here, but\n\n425\n00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,960\nthese are the ones that PMI recognizes\nin the the PM box specifically.\n\n426\n00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,010\nSo any one of these can be\na reason to kick off a project.\n\n427\n00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,190\nThat's a business case and\nthat goes in to our project charter also.\n\n428\n00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,970\nThe other things that we have is inputs.\n\n429\n00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,210\nSo if I go back to my diagram here.\n\n430\n00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,466\nSo some of the other inputs we've got,\nagreements.\n\n431\n00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:04,715\nAll right.\n\n432\n00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:09,750\nAgreements are contracts or even verbal\ncommunications we might even have\n\n433\n00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,055\nwith other people about either performing\na project or just certain aspects of it.\n\n434\n00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:18,378\nSo, we see this really\nclearly with contracts.\n\n435\n00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:22,890\nIf you're gonna be moving\nfrom Windows XP to Windows 7,\n\n436\n00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:27,350\nand you have a volume license agreement\nwith Microsoft, well, that's a contract.\n\n437\n00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,420\nSo the way you handle that roll out,\nthe way you handle your procurement and\n\n438\n00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,340\nstuff is going to be\ngoverned by that contract.\n\n439\n00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,690\nSo we need to be upfront about that, and\n\n440\n00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,420\nmake sure it's mentioned in\nthe charter ahead of time.\n\n441\n00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,660\nSo we understand that that is there.\n\n442\n00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,040\nIt also might be that we're not\ndoing this project for ourselves.\n\n443\n00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,720\nIf we are a contractor.\n\n444\n00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,620\nIf somebody's contracting us to do some\nwork, and that's what's kicking off this\n\n445\n00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,370\nproject, that contract is going\nto become part of the charter.\n\n446\n00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,590\nIn fact, it will really have\nthe statement of work in it.\n\n447\n00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,020\nAny contract should.\n\n448\n00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,370\nYou might have memorandums\nof understanding,\n\n449\n00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,300\nwhich is just a fancy way of\nsaying I want to put this in\n\n450\n00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,760\nwriting to make sure we're\nboth clear on a topic, right?\n\n451\n00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,380\nService level agreements where\nyou're promising a certain\n\n452\n00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,000\namount of functionality, right?\n\n453\n00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,450\nWe see this with phone lines.\n\n454\n00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,230\nThey guarantee you'll have\nphone service 99% of the time.\n\n455\n00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,790\nAnd if there's a failure you get a credit\nto your account, that kind of thing.\n\n456\n00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,210\nThose need to be documented so\nwe understand them.\n\n457\n00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,990\nThe rest of these are all\nkind of the same thing.\n\n458\n00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,880\nLetter of agreement,\n\n459\n00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,570\nletter of intent, these are just\nputting it in writing, right?\n\n460\n00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,780\nPutting it in writing that you\nare going to do something, but\n\n461\n00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,770\nit doesn't have to be in writing.\n\n462\n00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,030\nIt could be a verbal agreement.\n\n463\n00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,260\nIt could be that conversation\nat the water cooler.\n\n464\n00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,140\nWe were talking about\na project this morning, and\n\n465\n00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,290\nI was like,\nI bet we could get Nate to do that.\n\n466\n00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,950\nAnd Nate was over there,\nhe said sure, I'll take care of that.\n\n467\n00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,900\nAnd so that verbal agreement that\nhe'll be working on the project,\n\n468\n00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,920\nthat kind of stuff falls in and\nbecomes part of our project.\n\n469\n00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,730\nEmail, written agreements, all of these\nare just different types of agreements.\n\n470\n00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,160\nYou may have none of these,\nyou may have one or all of these,\n\n471\n00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,550\nit just depends on your current situation.\n\n472\n00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:09,550\nAnd then the last two are inputs\nthat we almost always see,\n\n473\n00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,170\nenterprise environmental factors,\nand organizational process assets.\n\n474\n00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,660\nI talked about those yesterday.\n\n475\n00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,770\nRemember the enterprise\nenvironmental factors?\n\n476\n00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,950\nThat is things like laws\nthat govern your business,\n\n477\n00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,710\nregulations, standards that you follow,\n\n478\n00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,425\ncertifications that your company holds,\nthat dictate the way that you do business.\n\n479\n00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:31,095\nOrganizational process assets,\nthat's historical stuff.\n\n480\n00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:31,725\nDocuments and\n\n481\n00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:35,805\nprocesses that your company already has\nthat you can use as part of this project.\n\n482\n00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:39,890\nSo when you go to create this project\ncharter, you might have a template.\n\n483\n00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,880\nA template document.\n\n484\n00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,700\nA Word document that says here's\nhow we fill out our project chart.\n\n485\n00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,260\nAll right.\n\n486\n00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,880\nThat would be an organizational\nprocess asset.\n\n487\n00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,290\nYou have that template so\nthat all charters look the same.\n\n488\n00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,790\nAll right.\n\n489\n00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,390\nSo basically we gather all\nthat information together.\n\n490\n00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,071\nAll the stuff from these five inputs,\nwhich we may have only one of,\n\n491\n00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,087\nor we might have all of those things.\n\n492\n00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:02,473\nSo this could be a huge\namount of documentation, or\n\n493\n00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:05,977\nit might just be a conversation at\na water cooler, and that's it, right?\n\n494\n00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,061\nAnd that's the input we have.\n\n495\n00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:11,816\nWe then apply some tools and\ntechniques to it,\n\n496\n00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:15,390\nto then create the final chart, all right?\n\n497\n00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,260\nNow, at this stage in the game, there's\nnot really a whole lot of tools and\n\n498\n00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,140\ntechniques.\n\n499\n00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,760\nThe main one is gonna be expert judgement,\n\n500\n00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,220\nwhich I said in the last\nepisode is this right here.\n\n501\n00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,430\nIt's what's in your head?\n\n502\n00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,060\nWhat you know and understand,\nso that you can go in and\n\n503\n00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,210\nkind of figure out what\nneeds to go in there.\n\n504\n00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,600\nYou're just writing,\nit's your expert judgement.\n\n505\n00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,530\nBut what if a project is something you\nhave zero familiarity with, right?\n\n506\n00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,130\nWhat if I've never even heard of the Roku,\nand\n\n507\n00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,950\nI'm being asked to launch a project\nto create a Roku genome, right?\n\n508\n00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,020\nWell, I might need to get some help.\n\n509\n00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,300\nAnd so, when it comes to expert judgement.\n\n510\n00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:56,230\nIt may not be your expert judgement,\nit might be somebody else's okay?\n\n511\n00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,820\nSo let me bring up my notes here, so under\nexpert judgement it might be yours right?\n\n512\n00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:07,580\nBut, it could be consultants, or SMEs,\nyou'll hear this term used a lot.\n\n513\n00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,365\nYou'll see it throughout the pinball.\n\n514\n00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,560\nThis is one of those, I always say SME\nyou'll hear people on the internet and\n\n515\n00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,650\nsome say SMEs.\n\n516\n00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,220\n>> SMEs.\n\n517\n00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,240\n>> I just hate that, but subject matter\nexpert, this is somebody's who's an expert\n\n518\n00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,527\non that topic, maybe I've got somebody in\nmy company that develops Roku genomes.\n\n519\n00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:24,921\n>> Right.\n>> I need to talk to them,\n\n520\n00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:26,140\ncuz their the expert.\n\n521\n00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,690\nThey know, what's kind of in store for me?\n\n522\n00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,270\nAnd it's a great way to\nget that information.\n\n523\n00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,520\nYou may not have a subject\nmatter expert available though.\n\n524\n00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,040\nSo, you might have to go to other areas.\n\n525\n00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,810\nConsultants are one.\n\n526\n00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,830\nYou might be a member of a professional or\ntechnical association.\n\n527\n00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,010\nIn IT we have the AITP, right?\n\n528\n00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,520\nThe Association of IT Professionals.\n\n529\n00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,180\nThey're community groups spread\nall across the world really.\n\n530\n00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,908\nIf you're never heard of them,\nyou should look them up, AITP.org.\n\n531\n00:25:56,908 --> 00:26:00,410\nIf you're gonna be launching\na new web server, or\n\n532\n00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,010\nnew web service and\nyou don't really know where to start.\n\n533\n00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,710\nYou just go to your monthly chapter\nmeeting at AITP, and you network.\n\n534\n00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,800\nYou talk to the other people there and\nsay, hey,\n\n535\n00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,520\nwe're thinking about rolling\nout an Oracle database server.\n\n536\n00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,070\nAny of you guys ever work with Oracle?\n\n537\n00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,110\nWhere do I even get started?\n\n538\n00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,700\nDo you guys know any consultants?\n\n539\n00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,320\nDo you have any contacts?\n\n540\n00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,700\nAnd, you can benefit from the knowledge of\nthe other people in those associations.\n\n541\n00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,730\nIt's a really great opportunity and\nassociations like that are pretty\n\n542\n00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:32,480\ninexpensive so, I think AITP the dues are\n$100 a year or something, it's not a lot.\n\n543\n00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,490\nSo, you can join up with them, and\nnetwork with people in your local area.\n\n544\n00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,650\nBut, what if you live in a small city,\nlike we do?\n\n545\n00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,050\nHere in Gainesville.\n\n546\n00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,450\nSo I go to AITP meetings all the time.\n\n547\n00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,230\nAnd, when I go there might\nbe ten people there.\n\n548\n00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,140\nIt's not massive.\n\n549\n00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,630\nBut, if you go in Seattle\nthen the ITP meeting,\n\n550\n00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,200\nmight have a hundred people there.\n\n551\n00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,910\nSo, you get a lot more\nbenefit in the larger groups.\n\n552\n00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,510\nSo, instead, you might wanna rely on\nsomething else like an industry group.\n\n553\n00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,070\nIndustry groups, are ones that\nare not built around a region, but\n\n554\n00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,060\nbuilt around your business.\n\n555\n00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,810\nSo, if you work for a hospital or\na medical environment, then our medical\n\n556\n00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,015\nindustry groups, people that are working\nin the same field that you are.\n\n557\n00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:18,085\nAnd boy, let me tell you, the information\nyou get from these guys is invaluable,\n\n558\n00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:18,775\nit's amazing.\n\n559\n00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:26,665\nOne of the ones that I've used over the\nyears is shoot, I just had brain freeze.\n\n560\n00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:30,847\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was in my head just two seconds ago\n\n561\n00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:32,306\nand now I've completely\nforgotten the name.\n\n562\n00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:34,454\nAll right, I'll have to think of it.\n\n563\n00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:37,078\nThis is, well, that I subscribe to it,\nI pay the bill every month.\n\n564\n00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:39,152\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I, [LAUGH] I can't remember it.\n\n565\n00:27:39,152 --> 00:27:40,058\nGartner group, there we go.\n\n566\n00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,647\n[CROSSTALK] Gartner group,\nI knew it would come to me.\n\n567\n00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:42,205\nYeah.\n\n568\n00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:43,006\n>> Let me pull up their website.\n\n569\n00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:47,313\nSo the Gardner Group, which in IT.\n\n570\n00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:47,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n571\n00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,224\n>> Let me tell you these guys,\nthey do technology research and\n\n572\n00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:56,690\nwhat they do is they have members\nall around the world, okay?\n\n573\n00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:01,380\nAnd if you're going to deploy,\nlet's say a SAN, a storage area network.\n\n574\n00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,720\nI wanna deploy a SAN, but\nI don't know anything about it?\n\n575\n00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,600\nI can go to the Gartner Group,\nand when you sign up,\n\n576\n00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,460\nyou actually get a rep that you work with.\n\n577\n00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,200\nSo you can just call him on the phone and\nsay hey,\n\n578\n00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,420\nI'm thinking about deploying a SAN,\ncan you get me some information?\n\n579\n00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,650\nAnd they'll say sure.\n\n580\n00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:19,040\nAnd what they do is they have their own\nlight papers that are written on how to\n\n581\n00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,010\nresearch a sand, how to pick the right\none, what's involved with the deployment?\n\n582\n00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,920\nSometimes they even have here's\na template for the project.\n\n583\n00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,618\nAll the different stuff you need to go\nthrough, and what's the really valuable?\n\n584\n00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:33,580\nIs there are information from all of there\nother members that have already deployed\n\n585\n00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,160\na.\n\n586\n00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,260\nSo, your not just taking HPs word for\nit, that HP makes the best SAN.\n\n587\n00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,990\nYou're listening to the customers of and\nthere saying yeah,\n\n588\n00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,790\nwe deployed an HP SAN and\nit didn't go so smooth.\n\n589\n00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,190\nYeah, it was the greatest thing ever.\n\n590\n00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,490\nAll the hype is real.\n\n591\n00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,980\nThese SAN's are awesome.\n\n592\n00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:55,050\nSo, you can really learn from other people\ninstead of reinventing the wheel yourself.\n\n593\n00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,360\nNow, Gartner Group's a little more\nexpensive to join, but it's worth it.\n\n594\n00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,990\nAnd these guys, they're great for\nIT, and IT related projects.\n\n595\n00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,080\nBut if you're doing other things.\n\n596\n00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,720\nIf you're doing construction,\nor medical, or whatever.\n\n597\n00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,780\nThere's similar groups.\n\n598\n00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,510\nSo the Gartner Group that are out there,\nand\n\n599\n00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,140\nyou can work with them and\nreally it saves a ton of time,\n\n600\n00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,160\nand it saves you from making mistakes\nthat other companies have already made.\n\n601\n00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,080\nLearn from their mistakes.\n\n602\n00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,040\nSo yep,\ndefinitely something that is useful.\n\n603\n00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,130\nAnd then lastly, I've got like\nthe Project Management Office, the PMO.\n\n604\n00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,870\nWhen you're kicking off a project and\n\n605\n00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,500\nyou're trying to write that charter, if\nyou have a PMO, you need to talk to them.\n\n606\n00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,760\nBecause they probably have\na standard charter form for you,\n\n607\n00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,665\nand the required information and all of\nthat, you really need to work with them.\n\n608\n00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:44,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n609\n00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,700\n>> Now, the project charter may or\n\n610\n00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,570\nmay not be drafted by the project manager.\n\n611\n00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,530\nI you have a PMO, it's not uncommon for\n\n612\n00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,390\nyou not to have a project\nmanager in the initiating phase.\n\n613\n00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,280\nA project manager makes a project happen.\n\n614\n00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,290\nIf a project doesn't exist yet,\n\n615\n00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,700\nthe project manager doesn't\nhave anything to do.\n\n616\n00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,690\nSo, when we're talking about\nthe project charter, oftentimes,\n\n617\n00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,180\nthis is being drafted by the sponsor,\nthe project sponsor.\n\n618\n00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,900\nSo that might be the CEO or\nvice president,\n\n619\n00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,040\nsomebody like that,\nnot the project manager in the end.\n\n620\n00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,130\nIn a small company,\nit may very well be the project manager.\n\n621\n00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:25,180\nBut often times,\nit's being drafted by somebody outside.\n\n622\n00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,660\nAnd that's where the PMO comes in handy.\n\n623\n00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,400\nSo the vice president goes to the PMO and\nsays, we wanna deploy a SAN.\n\n624\n00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,860\nI'm authorizing it.\n\n625\n00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,650\nWhat do I need to fill out?\n\n626\n00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,150\nAnd they say, here, you need to\nfill out this charter statement.\n\n627\n00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,170\nAnd in the charter statement they put how\nthey what it done, when they want it done?\n\n628\n00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:44,640\nAnd then they sign off on it giving the\nauthority, for that project to kick off.\n\n629\n00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,890\nNo project manager involved.\n\n630\n00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,610\nThat's how it works in\nlarge organizations.\n\n631\n00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,390\nThink about the space program,\nthe United States Space Program.\n\n632\n00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,490\nNASA was already in existence,\nalready putting rockets in space.\n\n633\n00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,790\nIt was President John F Kennedy who said,\nwe're gonna put a man on the moon.\n\n634\n00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,130\nThis is what we want.\n\n635\n00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,320\nSo, John F Kennedy was\nthe project sponsor.\n\n636\n00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,540\nHe said,\nI wanna put a man on the moon, and\n\n637\n00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,920\nhe signed an executive order which\neffectively was a project charter.\n\n638\n00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,900\nAnd that created the funding, and\nthe focus, and the dedication for\n\n639\n00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,570\nNASA to then pursue that.\n\n640\n00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,270\nAnd then, either put a man on the moon, or\n\n641\n00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,990\nput a man on a very fancy\nHollywood set in Arizona.\n\n642\n00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,952\nSo one or [CROSSTALK] other.\n\n643\n00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're not sure.\n\n644\n00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,150\nSo, conspiracy theories are awesome.\n\n645\n00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,130\nSo, that's basically what happened and\n\n646\n00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,980\nyou'll see that very commonly\nin large organizations.\n\n647\n00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,590\nThat the project manager is not\nthe person coming up with the idea in\n\n648\n00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,620\nthe first place.\n\n649\n00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,190\nThey're the one who is\nmaking the idea happen.\n\n650\n00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:48,570\nAll right, we've got one more tool and\ntechnique of facilitation to talk about.\n\n651\n00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,680\nBut looking at the timer, it's a good\nspot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n652\n00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,520\nSo, Ron, do you have anything to\nthrow in before we take a break?\n\n653\n00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,299\n>> No, just try to remember here that what\nwe're doing is we're beginning the actual\n\n654\n00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:58,620\nprocess everything that we have here.\n\n655\n00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,536\nAnd we just wanna make sure that we get\nthese things down, so that as we begin\n\n656\n00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:06,526\nthe actual project that we're ready to\ngo when everything is ready to fire.\n\n657\n00:32:06,526 --> 00:32:09,033\n>> All right, ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n658\n00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,750\nWhen we get back, more project initiation.\n\n659\n00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:20,281\nAfter this.\n\n660\n00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:22,040\n[MUSIC]\nAll right welcome back.\n\n661\n00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,930\nBefore the break we were\ntalking about expert judgment,\n\n662\n00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:28,710\nand we actually had a funny\nconversation during the break cuz\n\n663\n00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,740\nI keep spelling judgment apparently the\nBritish way instead of the American way.\n\n664\n00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,330\nI've updated my documentation\nto reflect US spelling,\n\n665\n00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,090\nwhich now I'll get complaints\nabout European spelling.\n\n666\n00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,380\nBut anyhow, [LAUGH] so\nas we talk about expert judgment.\n\n667\n00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,130\nNow let's take a look at the second\ntool and technique we have,\n\n668\n00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:51,770\nwhich is facilitation techniques, now what\nis that, what are they talking about?\n\n669\n00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,290\n>> Facilitation technique for us is when\nwe actually say, hey, look, we've got to\n\n670\n00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:01,200\nactually now begin to put this down and we\nmay actually need to have more input in it\n\n671\n00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,290\nthan me just talking with another expert\nor me relying on my own judgment, so\n\n672\n00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,390\nyou may now actually begin to pool\npeople together into a meeting.\n\n673\n00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,800\nAnd they're are actually several\ndifferent techniques for us.\n\n674\n00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,690\nThe pen box specifically calls out things\nlike brain storming, conflict management,\n\n675\n00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,252\nmeetings and what\n>> Problem solving.\n\n676\n00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:19,597\n>> Problem solving.\n\n677\n00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,580\nYeah, as some of the different\ntechniques for us here.\n\n678\n00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,905\nNow we'll start gathering more people\ntogether, right, everybody is gonna have\n\n679\n00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:31,165\ntheir own opinion, but how do we now come\nto the idea that the keyword is consensus\n\n680\n00:33:31,165 --> 00:33:34,275\nof what is actually gonna be done\nhere is what we're talking about.\n\n681\n00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:37,308\n>> Yeah, you know, especially if you\nhave different people with different\n\n682\n00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:38,905\n>> Different needs different\n\n683\n00:33:38,905 --> 00:33:40,330\ndesires, right.\n\n684\n00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,970\nWe're actually going through\nthis right now with IT Pro TV,\n\n685\n00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:47,870\nwhere we do not have a dedicated\nmobile application yet.\n\n686\n00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,940\nNow by the time you watch this video,\nmaybe we will, I don't know, but\n\n687\n00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:57,040\nthe debate that's going around here is,\ndo we create a iPad app,\n\n688\n00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,740\nfor example, that lets you watch our\nvideos and our live stream and stuff just\n\n689\n00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,860\nlike our Roku channel, so just straight up\nit's an extension of your subscription.\n\n690\n00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,580\nOr do we create one that\ndoes in app purchases and\n\n691\n00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,529\nyou can buy individual\ncourses if you want?\n\n692\n00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,090\nThere is some of us that think\nwe should go in that way,\n\n693\n00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,700\nthere is others of us that absolutely\nhate that and so there is a little bit of\n\n694\n00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,690\nconflict over how we should move as far as\ncreating that application, what do we do?\n\n695\n00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,560\nDo we just throw the whole project away\nand say forget it, we're not gonna do it?\n\n696\n00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,530\nWell, you can, some people do that.\n\n697\n00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:37,230\nBut, instead, we're going to leverage\nthese four things, to try and\n\n698\n00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,150\nfind what's gonna create the best\nsolution as far as how we can create,\n\n699\n00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,800\nwhatever this project's set out to do.\n\n700\n00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,110\nBrainstorming is probably\nthe first thing that we do.\n\n701\n00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,740\nSomebody's got an idea, and\nideas can pretty nebulous sometimes.\n\n702\n00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,640\nThey can be all over the place and\nwhen you try and put it down on paper,\n\n703\n00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,850\nit could be just be super messy.\n\n704\n00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,570\nWe start by brainstorming and\njust putting our information together.\n\n705\n00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,870\nNow, there's several different\nways to go about it and\n\n706\n00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,350\njust got Kenneth in\nthe chat-room siding with me.\n\n707\n00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,020\nSide with team Don, that's the way to go.\n\n708\n00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,030\nAnd just an extension of the subscription,\nthat's the way to go.\n\n709\n00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,350\nYou start with brainstorming,\n\n710\n00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,850\nwhere you just get in a room with\nthe people who are involved at this point.\n\n711\n00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,590\nUnderstand it's not gonna be many people\nat this stage of the game it's probably\n\n712\n00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,020\nonly two, maybe three people.\n\n713\n00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,570\nAnd you just throw your ideas\nat the wall and see what sticks,\n\n714\n00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,980\nand see if you can't\ncome up with something.\n\n715\n00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,180\nKnowing that this is noncommittal,\nthe initiation phase,\n\n716\n00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,300\nyou can change everything, that you come\nup with in the initiation phase without\n\n717\n00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,700\nhurting the project much,\nbecause we're gonna turn right around and\n\n718\n00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,270\ngo into the planning phase where\nwe start to set things in stone.\n\n719\n00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,420\nRight now things are still\nfairly flexible.\n\n720\n00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,200\nWe just kind of figure out\nthe way that we want it to be.\n\n721\n00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,210\nWe start to brainstorm.\n\n722\n00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,612\nProbably the most common way to brainstorm\nis everybody gets in a room and\n\n723\n00:35:58,612 --> 00:36:02,159\nyou have a big Post-it board on the wall,\nor you have a chalkboard and\n\n724\n00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,260\nyou just start writing down your ideas.\n\n725\n00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,065\nWe're IT guys, so\nwe always go the IT route.\n\n726\n00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We actually use a product that we\n\n727\n00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:15,245\nbought, called Mindomo and I mention\na lot of products during the show.\n\n728\n00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:19,585\nWe don't get commissions on these or\nanything, so use whatever product you want\n\n729\n00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:21,675\nand just because we use it\ndoesn't mean it's the best.\n\n730\n00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:25,925\nIn some cases, we might've met these\nguys at a trade show or whatever so\n\n731\n00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:27,035\nwe like their software.\n\n732\n00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:29,610\nDefinitely evaluate\neverything that's out there.\n\n733\n00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,740\nBut, we use Mindomo which\nis mind mapping software.\n\n734\n00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,410\nAnd, you can throw down ideas and start\nto branch out and just kind of record it.\n\n735\n00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,700\nIt is, it's super quick.\n\n736\n00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:46,012\nI brought up a sample There we go,\n\n737\n00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:51,135\nI brought up a sample mind map here and\nbasically the way it works is you start\n\n738\n00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:56,360\noff with an idea, and in fact it's\nprobably just just create an all new one.\n\n739\n00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,120\nWell here, I'll just work off this one.\n\n740\n00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,300\nI can just move it aside or something.\n\n741\n00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,700\nWell, we'll work with it.\n\n742\n00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,910\nI come up with an idea, right?\n\n743\n00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:14,990\nI'm gonna say this is our\nSAN deployment project.\n\n744\n00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,010\nRight.\n\n745\n00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,970\nWe're gonna be deploying a SAN in\nour network and I need to think of\n\n746\n00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,280\nvarious stuff that is important\nas far as deploying a SAN, right.\n\n747\n00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,560\nAnd I might come through and\n\n748\n00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,455\nsay all right, well if I'm gonna in order\nto deploy a SAN, I need to think about,\n\n749\n00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:35,045\na couple of different things that we're\ngoing to deal with as we go through it.\n\n750\n00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:35,827\nRight?\n\n751\n00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:38,005\nI'm gonna need a business case, and\n\n752\n00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,605\nall the other stuff that kind\nof ends up in that charter.\n\n753\n00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,555\nI come in and I say.\n\n754\n00:37:42,555 --> 00:37:44,975\nAll right.\nI know I need a business case.\n\n755\n00:37:44,975 --> 00:37:46,935\nI wonder if I could have found\na smaller font than that.\n\n756\n00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,420\nWhy is that microscopic?\n\n757\n00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,460\nWhat did you do, Ronnie?\n\n758\n00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,035\n>> I don't know what\nI've done on this point.\n\n759\n00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:55,550\n[LAUGH]\n>> This is what I get for.\n\n760\n00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,140\n>> That's what you get for zooming out.\n\n761\n00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,997\n>> I know, let me,\nhere we'll just zoom in.\n\n762\n00:37:58,997 --> 00:37:59,659\n>> There we go.\n\n763\n00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:02,620\n[LAUGH]\n>> Problem solved.\n\n764\n00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,010\n[LAUGH] I have no idea why\nthat's gone microscopic on me.\n\n765\n00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,800\nBut, I know I need a business case,\nI know I need that.\n\n766\n00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,510\nI may also need to come\nup with stakeholder's,\n\n767\n00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,600\nwe'll talk about that a little bit later.\n\n768\n00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:21,010\nWe also need to think of,\nstuff like our budget.\n\n769\n00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,510\nKinda like how much we're looking\nto spend, our time frame,\n\n770\n00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,130\nas far as where we want to deploy it.\n\n771\n00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,945\nThen we start coming up\nwith ideas from there.\n\n772\n00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:33,090\nMy business case,\nI might have a specific need.\n\n773\n00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:38,849\nWe're running out of storage,\nBut we might also say,\n\n774\n00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:45,260\nwe need something scalable, and so on.\n\n775\n00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,520\nI just keep going and adding ideas, and\nyou can kind of branch down and whatever.\n\n776\n00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,140\nThe idea is you do this very quickly.\n\n777\n00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,445\nPeople come up with ideas,\nyou're just throwing it in here.\n\n778\n00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:57,380\nThis tools like these\nare designed to be rapid.\n\n779\n00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,460\nYou'll see like, I click on\nbusiness case and somebody says,\n\n780\n00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,800\nwell what if we want to do this because\nwe can reduce the environmental impact,\n\n781\n00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,260\nwe can save electricity and\nI say all right.\n\n782\n00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,780\nWell let me choose business case and\nI just hit tab and\n\n783\n00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,820\nI type in save electricity.\n\n784\n00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,690\nRight?\n\n785\n00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,420\nAnd just kind a go on real quick,\nbecause I know I can come back and\n\n786\n00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,830\nupdate this stuff later and\nwe just throw down every idea.\n\n787\n00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,780\nGood idea, bad idea, doesn't matter.\n\n788\n00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,550\nWe throw it all in here, and then we\ncan start to talk about these ideas and\n\n789\n00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,440\nwe can evaluate which ones are important,\nwhich ones are not important and\n\n790\n00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,400\nreally start to kind of break down\nwhat it is that we're working towards.\n\n791\n00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,540\nAnd what it is that\nwe're trying to achieve,\n\n792\n00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,450\nso you just kind of branch it out.\n\n793\n00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:40,360\nAnd once you get that people start to see\nthat some ideas are more important than\n\n794\n00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,780\nothers.\n\n795\n00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:50,100\nI always give the example, if you have ten\nCd's from ten different artists musicians.\n\n796\n00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,320\nAnd you have a favorite song and each one.\n\n797\n00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,860\nLike man,\nthat's my favorite song by Depeche Mode or\n\n798\n00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,578\nthat's my favorite song by the Cure or\nwhatever, right.\n\n799\n00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:58,550\nWell, so.\n[LAUGH] I know,\n\n800\n00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,040\nI'm getting frowny faces from the crowd.\n\n801\n00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,960\nYou have these favorite songs.\n\n802\n00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,930\nWell, that might be your\nfavorite song from Depeche Mode.\n\n803\n00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,265\nBut when you compare it, that song from\nthe Cure, you're like, wait a minute,\n\n804\n00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:11,411\nthe Cure is so much better.\n\n805\n00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,737\nMaybe nobody's ever had this\nconversation ever, it's just in my head.\n\n806\n00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:19,010\nYou start finding out the different\nideas Don't appear as great anymore\n\n807\n00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,723\nwhen they're compared with other ones,\nand mind mapping, or\n\n808\n00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:25,240\nbrainstorming let's us see that.\n\n809\n00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,610\nWe start to think of some of\nthe different aspects of that project,\n\n810\n00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,580\nwhat we might need to be aware of, right.\n\n811\n00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n812\n00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,735\nDon't forget that brainstorming of course,\neven though Don can do it with himself,\n\n813\n00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:36,970\n[LAUGH] he did it very effectively for\nus here.\n\n814\n00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,830\n[LAUGH] Sometimes you can actually have\nmore people, and again once you get\n\n815\n00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,750\nthose ideas out there, the nice thing\nabout using something like this or\n\n816\n00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,510\neven a chalkboard is that it visually\nputs it in front of everybody.\n\n817\n00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,490\nThat way they are not trying\nto remember everything,\n\n818\n00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,050\nand going man was that a good idea or\na bad idea when they first started.\n\n819\n00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,540\nThen they read it over and there it is.\n\n820\n00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,050\nIt actually is right in front of them.\n\n821\n00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,350\nAt that point,\nonce you start doing that, people,\n\n822\n00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,170\nyou can again use some of the different\nbrainstorming techniques,\n\n823\n00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,360\nwhether you vote on, whether or\nnot this is a good idea or what.\n\n824\n00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,340\nIt really can help you to narrow down some\nof the things that you actually need to,\n\n825\n00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,910\nto begin to focus in on what\nthe actual project charter\n\n826\n00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,310\nis gonna end up developing in to.\n\n827\n00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,400\n>> Yeah and that's where you start to\nkinda weigh the different values, you\n\n828\n00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,960\nstart to settle in on things, and that's\nactually what, where did my notes go?\n\n829\n00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,435\nThere we go.\nThat's what comptia, comptia,\n\n830\n00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:28,190\n[LAUGH] what the PMI is mentioning here.\n\n831\n00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,450\nBrainstorming, that's where we\nget those ideas together, and\n\n832\n00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,850\nthen we sift through them.\n\n833\n00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:37,480\nAnd we sift through them using conflict\nresolution and problem solving.\n\n834\n00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,750\nConflict resolution.\n\n835\n00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,130\nIf there's two completely different\nideas that are opposing each other,\n\n836\n00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,380\nyou are going to have to make a decision.\n\n837\n00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,560\nYou can't move forward on a project with\nconflict at the very beginning right?\n\n838\n00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,940\nYou got to make a judgement call.\n\n839\n00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,730\nAnd it may be that the decision is\nnot to make a decision right now.\n\n840\n00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:58,600\nBut that you identify certain information\nyou need, to make the decision.\n\n841\n00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,560\nYou say, you know what?\n\n842\n00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,040\nWe just can't pick, between this right\nnow without doing a customer survey.\n\n843\n00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,770\n>> Right.\n>> Or without doing something to find out\n\n844\n00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,150\nmore information about how\npeople want this stuff,.\n\n845\n00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:16,230\nMaybe we're gonna move forward with\nthis project doing an iPad app.\n\n846\n00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,740\nWe say well how many of our\nusers actually use an iPad.\n\n847\n00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,435\nI don't know, right, and\ndo they actually want this.\n\n848\n00:42:22,435 --> 00:42:24,960\nCuz they can actually log into\nthe website from there iPad.\n\n849\n00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,000\nDo we actually need an iPad app.\n\n850\n00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,320\nI don't know.\n\n851\n00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,720\nWe might not be able to make\nthat decision right now.\n\n852\n00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,250\nBut we put it in here and say, we need to\ndo a study, we need to do a feasibility\n\n853\n00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,130\nstudy, or whatever and find out whether or\nnot this is even worthwhile.\n\n854\n00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,220\nAnd we can do that in the planning phase,\nbut\n\n855\n00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,700\nhere in the initiation phase we're\njust getting it down on paper.\n\n856\n00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,690\nAll right, now conflict resolution, we're\ngonna talk more about conflict resolution\n\n857\n00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:51,180\nlater on because there's some\nspecific techniques, and\n\n858\n00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,160\nI guess we probably could\ntalk about them now.\n\n859\n00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,210\nWe talk about it a lot more\nin the planning phase.\n\n860\n00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,170\nAll right,\nwe'll tackle it in the planning phase.\n\n861\n00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,430\nBut are there some specific\ntechniques that we can use to try and\n\n862\n00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,350\nbe successful in resolving\nissues like this,\n\n863\n00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,660\nand there's a couple of techniques\nthat you shouldn't use.\n\n864\n00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,920\nWell, we'll see some of those and\nthey can turn up on the exam,\n\n865\n00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,120\nwe need to be aware of the ones\nthat are generally acceptable.\n\n866\n00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,345\nBut, yeah, we'll tackle those later.\n\n867\n00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,240\nProblem-solving, though.\n\n868\n00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,550\nThat's a little more straightforward.\n\n869\n00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:25,800\nThere's an issue, you need a solution,\nanything can be solved with information.\n\n870\n00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,860\nIf we just had all the information we\nneeded, we could make the right decision.\n\n871\n00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,770\nWe could solve that problem.\n\n872\n00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,550\nBut, often times, we have a problem\nbecause we don't know that information.\n\n873\n00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,980\nI don't know whether in app\npurchases are a good idea or not,\n\n874\n00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,630\nbecause I don't know how our\ncustomers will react to that.\n\n875\n00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,800\nBut, boy, we can just do a survey and\nfind out real quick.\n\n876\n00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,100\nYou know, get that information from\npeople and then we would know.\n\n877\n00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,400\nHey, this is what they would like.\n\n878\n00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,549\nGetting that information,\nwe identify the need for that information.\n\n879\n00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:58,200\nAnd this last one, in my opinion,\nis one of the most valuable skills\n\n880\n00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,230\na project manager can have,\nand that's meeting management.\n\n881\n00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,970\nI cannot tell you how many pointless\nmeetings I've been in in my entire life.\n\n882\n00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,170\nTons of them, tons of pointless\nmeetings where you're in a meeting for\n\n883\n00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,020\nan hour, you had no input or\n\n884\n00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,250\nfeedback in the meeting, and at the end\nof the meeting you had no action items.\n\n885\n00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,100\nThe meeting was pointless.\n\n886\n00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,000\nManaging a meeting, or\n\n887\n00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,950\njust meeting management,\nreally consists of several skills,.\n\n888\n00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,070\nThe first skill is very important,\n\n889\n00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:27,600\nwhich is picking the right\npeople to be in the meeting,.\n\n890\n00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,590\nThere's going to be people that should\nbe there and people that shouldn't.\n\n891\n00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,440\nAnd if you leave out people\nthat should have been there,\n\n892\n00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,720\nthen what you do in the meeting is not\ngoing to be as valuable as if you had all\n\n893\n00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,210\nof the right parties in place.\n\n894\n00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,090\nYou might make decisions\nthat are inaccurate\n\n895\n00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,470\nbecause you didn't have\nthe right people there.\n\n896\n00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:48,730\nWe start by inviting the right people,\npeople that we know will have input,\n\n897\n00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,750\npeople that we know have\nthe authority to make decisions,\n\n898\n00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,925\nyou don't want people that don't\nhave authority to make decisions,\n\n899\n00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:56,110\ncuz they can't give you\nany valuable feedback.\n\n900\n00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:56,810\nAll right.\n\n901\n00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:00,610\nAnd we make sure that we have our subject\nmatter experts, the people who know what's\n\n902\n00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,410\ngoing on who could help us, give us\nthe information we need to make decisions.\n\n903\n00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,740\nThen, once we get in the meeting,\n\n904\n00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:13,100\nwe need to have a list of things that\nwe want to achieve in that meeting.\n\n905\n00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,720\nAll right?\n\n906\n00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,570\nThese are.\n\n907\n00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,410\nAction items or.\n\n908\n00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,270\nBullet points.\n\n909\n00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,540\nThere's different terms for\nthem that are out there.\n\n910\n00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:23,800\nBut not necessarily like meeting minutes,\nthat is detailed stuff.\n\n911\n00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,760\nBut just high level, here's\nthe bullet points, here's my agenda,\n\n912\n00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,090\nhere's what I want to hit in that meeting,\nall right?\n\n913\n00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:34,240\nYou have the meeting,\nyou hit each of those topics, and\n\n914\n00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,520\nyou generate what are called action items.\n\n915\n00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,980\nAnd action items are the single reason for\nhaving a meeting,\n\n916\n00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,540\nyou have a meeting because there's\nsome action that you can't take and\n\n917\n00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,010\nyou need to get information\nto take that action.\n\n918\n00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,600\nThe end of the meeting you now should\nbe poised to take that action.\n\n919\n00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,030\nAction items should be assigned\nto people in the meeting.\n\n920\n00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,980\nI always say if we end a meeting and\n\n921\n00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,230\nthere's no action item,\nwe shouldn't have had the meeting.\n\n922\n00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,132\nThere's no point.\n\n923\n00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:04,240\nAll right, that's a real big deal\nthere everybody should either\n\n924\n00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,050\nhave input, have an action item, or both.\n\n925\n00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,140\nIf there was somebody at the meeting\nthat didn’t provide any input, and\n\n926\n00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,280\ndidn’t get an action item,\nthey shouldn’t have been there.\n\n927\n00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,470\nThey served no purpose,\nyou wasted their time.\n\n928\n00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,880\nManaging that meeting is important.\n\n929\n00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,860\nAnd when you’re doing brainstorming,\n\n930\n00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,040\nit's important to kind of set boundaries\nto that cuz people start to have ideas.\n\n931\n00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,530\nWe're planning an iPad app and\nsomebody says well, what about Android,\n\n932\n00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,800\nlet's do an Android app.\n\n933\n00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,145\nWell, that's great but, it's a separate\nplatform, it's a separate design,\n\n934\n00:46:33,145 --> 00:46:36,400\nlet's move that into a separate project,\nlet's not brainstorm that now.\n\n935\n00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:43,424\nLet's stay on target with what this\nparticular project is or Chrome-cast.\n\n936\n00:46:43,424 --> 00:46:44,250\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or whatever,\n\n937\n00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,710\nthere's all these different\nplatforms that out there.\n\n938\n00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,960\nYou have to stay on target.\n\n939\n00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,220\nAnd it's the person who's\nrunning the meeting, which\n\n940\n00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,610\nmaybe a project manager at this stage,\nbut often times it's still the sponsor.\n\n941\n00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> This person who's initiating.\n\n942\n00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,410\nWho's doing that.\n\n943\n00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,430\nHaving control of that meeting,\n\n944\n00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,980\nmaking sure you're actually\nmoving towards a goal.\n\n945\n00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,770\nThat's a skill.\n\n946\n00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,050\nThat's a talent that you learn.\n\n947\n00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:05,390\nYeah.\n\n948\n00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,490\nI hate meetings, and as a result,\nmy meetings are always brief.\n\n949\n00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,490\nAnd, hopefully, to the point.\n\n950\n00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:15,060\nYou have your points, you hit them, you\nassign your action items, and you're done.\n\n951\n00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,750\nAll right, when we use these tools,\n\n952\n00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:25,150\nwe then have gathered enough\ninformation to kick off the project.\n\n953\n00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,340\nAnd so the only thing left to\ndo is generate our output,\n\n954\n00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,300\nwhich is the project charter, all right?\n\n955\n00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,150\nThe project charter is a document.\n\n956\n00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,850\nAnd like I said,\nI try to keep it to one sheet of paper.\n\n957\n00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:42,070\nOne side, I don't even like to go two\nsided on it, if I can avoid it, that is\n\n958\n00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,780\nthe high level statement of what this\nproject is gonna be and has the sponsor's\n\n959\n00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,810\nsignature on the bottom giving authority\nfor that project to move forward.\n\n960\n00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,200\nNow the project charter is made\nup of a number of components and\n\n961\n00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,410\nit's up to you what goes in there.\n\n962\n00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,610\nRemember that PMI It's a framework.\n\n963\n00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,210\nIt's a recommendation.\n\n964\n00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,640\nHere's things that can go in your charter.\n\n965\n00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,050\nYou don't have to have it.\n\n966\n00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,985\nIn fact, the only thing you\nhave to have in the charter,\n\n967\n00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:10,304\nis a description of the project,\nand the sponsors signature.\n\n968\n00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,348\nThose two things,\n\n969\n00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:15,731\nthat's really all that's required of\na project charter to kick off a project.\n\n970\n00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:19,135\nIf you're missing either of those\n>> If you don't have a description of\n\n971\n00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:21,098\nthe product, you don't know what\nthe heck it is, or the project,\n\n972\n00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,100\nso there's no point in doing it.\n\n973\n00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,380\nAnd if you don't have\nthe sponsors signature,\n\n974\n00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,090\nyou don't have the authority to move\nforward, again, no point in doing it.\n\n975\n00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,360\nSo those are really the only two\nthings that are required, but\n\n976\n00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,040\nwhat are some of the other things we\ncan put in there to be thorough and\n\n977\n00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,220\nmake sure we have the right information.\n\n978\n00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,970\nWell, PMI gives us a list.\n\n979\n00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:39,080\nAnd so here's the list.\n\n980\n00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,550\nBasically the project purpose or\njustification, right.\n\n981\n00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,960\nSo what it is we're trying to achieve and\nwhy we're doing it.\n\n982\n00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,610\nWhy our company needs to move\nforward with this project.\n\n983\n00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:52,550\nThere should always be a justification.\n\n984\n00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,870\nAnd that's typically the business case,\nwhich,\n\n985\n00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:58,050\nwe saw back here as one of our inputs,\nright.\n\n986\n00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,140\nThe business case, so\nwe've probably already drafted it, and\n\n987\n00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,560\nwe do a little copy and paste action\nto throw that into our project charter.\n\n988\n00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,310\nReally, a lot of times, our outputs\nare just copy and paste actions.\n\n989\n00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,560\n>> The measurable project and\nobjective and related success criteria.\n\n990\n00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,450\nThis really does even go back to that\nidea of the statement of work, right.\n\n991\n00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,580\nMaybe a little bit more fleshed out for\nus, but it really is that.\n\n992\n00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,280\nIt's trying to say hey, we now know that\nwe're ready to proceed with this and\n\n993\n00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,940\nhere's the way that we can quickly and\n\n994\n00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,590\neasily measure that we're starting\nto accomplish this stuff as well.\n\n995\n00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,650\nSo, including it in the project charter,\nagain, gives us that, too.\n\n996\n00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,670\nAgain, another formalized stick.\n\n997\n00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:36,830\n>> High level requirements?\n\n998\n00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:41,020\nRequirements are project objectives and\nsuccess criteria.\n\n999\n00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,330\nYou have to meet these\nrequirements to be successful, so\n\n1000\n00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,660\nit's really just different terminology for\nthe same thing.\n\n1001\n00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,890\n>> But notice they say, high level.\n\n1002\n00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,900\nThat's straight out of the pin bock.\n\n1003\n00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,630\nDon't go in crazy detail right here.\n\n1004\n00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,520\nThe project charter is not the place for\ndetail.\n\n1005\n00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,780\nThe planning phase is.\n\n1006\n00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,930\nSo we'll see this again.\n\n1007\n00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:01,800\nWe'll revisit this and the project charter\nwe'll see is an input to a number of other\n\n1008\n00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,102\nprocesses where we get\nthat super crazy detail.\n\n1009\n00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:04,795\nYeah.\n\n1010\n00:50:04,795 --> 00:50:09,360\n>> Along with that that also goes back to\nthat idea of that project scope comes down\n\n1011\n00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,310\nto the idea of the assumptions and\nthe constraints as well\n\n1012\n00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,470\nthat tells us hey here's the limitation of\nwhat we're really thinking it's gonna be.\n\n1013\n00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:20,130\nAnd here's what we're assuming we can\naccomplish with what we have on hand as\n\n1014\n00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:24,390\nwell and so it really does help us to\nagain provide a little bit more definition\n\n1015\n00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:27,570\nto the overall work that\nwe're gonna accomplish.\n\n1016\n00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:31,290\n>> All right so,\nassumptions and constraints.\n\n1017\n00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,620\nRight?\n\n1018\n00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,270\nEvery project starts.\n\n1019\n00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,030\n>> Yeah.\n>> Without a full set of information.\n\n1020\n00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,540\n[LAUGH] So if there is anywhere\nthat we are lacking information,\n\n1021\n00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,280\nwe need to be able to\nrecognize that early on, okay.\n\n1022\n00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,630\nAnd the earlier we\nrecognize it the better.\n\n1023\n00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:47,320\nAnd so let's go with iPad app, right.\n\n1024\n00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,550\nSo, if we decide we want\nto create an iPad app,\n\n1025\n00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:55,390\nwe're making the assumption that\nour customers want that, right.\n\n1026\n00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:59,360\nNow I might actually have a survey result\nor whatever from our customers that\n\n1027\n00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,550\nsays they want it, right, but\nI don't, I don't have that.\n\n1028\n00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,440\nSo that's an assumption\ngoing into this product.\n\n1029\n00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,000\nI'm assuming that this is\nsomething that people want.\n\n1030\n00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,670\nSo, by putting here on paper,\nI know when I get to the planning phase,\n\n1031\n00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,475\nwe should probably find out if\nthat assumption is correct.\n\n1032\n00:51:12,475 --> 00:51:13,400\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Because if that\n\n1033\n00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,900\nassumption is not correct,\nmaybe we shouldn't move forward, right.\n\n1034\n00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,490\nBut if it is correct, then we're good.\n\n1035\n00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:22,400\nWe move on, but for right now, I'm just\nassuming that that's there, all right.\n\n1036\n00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,690\nAnd then, constraints.\n\n1037\n00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,670\nWhat are my limits?\n\n1038\n00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:31,130\nI know that if we create an iPad app,\n\n1039\n00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:35,360\nApple has some crazy rules about how\nthings work, I think you have to\n\n1040\n00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,960\npay 30% of all your sales have to go\ninto Apple, different things like that.\n\n1041\n00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,450\nSo those are some things that I have to be\naware of, that it's gonna hit our bottom\n\n1042\n00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:48,740\nline and there's certain limitations,\nthere's only so much we can discount\n\n1043\n00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:52,070\nour product before we start to lose\nmoney and so we can't do that.\n\n1044\n00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:52,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n1045\n00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,980\n>> So these are constraints\nthat will limit this project.\n\n1046\n00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,130\nThere's also other things like resources.\n\n1047\n00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,320\nI may not have a lot of resources,\na lot of people, and so\n\n1048\n00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,410\nI need to identify that here.\n\n1049\n00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,050\nIf I say I'm willing to dedicate\n\n1050\n00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,620\nour web developer a couple\nof hours every day, right.\n\n1051\n00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,330\nWell that's going to affect the timeline\nof this project versus whether I had web\n\n1052\n00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,640\ndeveloper full time.\n\n1053\n00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,590\nSo any constraint like that,\nany restriction,\n\n1054\n00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:21,400\nif we were a medical company we\nwould need a list that we have\n\n1055\n00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,060\na constraint that says anything that\nwe do has to be HIPPA compliant.\n\n1056\n00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,570\nHas to meet those limits, so\n\n1057\n00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:30,140\nthese are things that we need to set\nforth right off in the beginning.\n\n1058\n00:52:32,432 --> 00:52:35,770\nAll right, we've also got our high level\nproduct description and boundaries.\n\n1059\n00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,280\nVery similar to the one's above.\n\n1060\n00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,700\nA lot of these are different terms for\nthe same thing.\n\n1061\n00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:44,420\nSo, just an overall description of\nwhat our project is going to be, and\n\n1062\n00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,440\nthe boundaries of it.\n\n1063\n00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,330\nThe boundaries are saying what\nwe are going to accomplish.\n\n1064\n00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,840\nAnd what we're not going to accomplish so\n\n1065\n00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,670\nmaybe we say we're going\nto develop an iPad app.\n\n1066\n00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:59,940\nWe are not going to develop a web OSF at\nthis time or an Android app at this time.\n\n1067\n00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,480\nThat's another project,\nwe'll do that later, right.\n\n1068\n00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,550\nSo set the boundaries so\nyou don't get Scope creep.\n\n1069\n00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,737\nThey start bleeding and\nbringing in all sorts of extra work.\n\n1070\n00:53:09,744 --> 00:53:11,560\nHigh level risks.\n\n1071\n00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,070\nDo we know of any risks about\nthis project, from day one?\n\n1072\n00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:15,610\nRight.\nIs there\n\n1073\n00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,042\nsomething we know about right now?\n\n1074\n00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:21,270\nRisk is, is a whole huge section\nthat we'll talk about later on,\n\n1075\n00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,020\nthat we'll have to do\na very deep level analysis.\n\n1076\n00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,990\nBut at the high level, are there any risks\nthat we're aware of right now, all right?\n\n1077\n00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:33,430\nSo there's a risk that doing a mobile app\n\n1078\n00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:37,760\nmight create another pathway for\npiracy of our content, right.\n\n1079\n00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,700\nThat's a risk, and we just need to\nevaluate whether we accept that or\n\n1080\n00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,090\nif there's a way to minimize it or\nwhatever.\n\n1081\n00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:49,200\nThere's a risk that Apple's percentage\nof our profits might exceed our profit\n\n1082\n00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,640\nmargin and in that case, we might be\nlosing money, so we need to evaluate that.\n\n1083\n00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,690\nThese are things that we\nmight know ahead of time.\n\n1084\n00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,660\nThere's other risks\nthat we might not know,\n\n1085\n00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,310\nstuff that we just have no idea about.\n\n1086\n00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,730\nFor example,\n\n1087\n00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:04,670\nApple has certain rules as far as what\napplications they'll allow or won't.\n\n1088\n00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:08,310\nAnd so, maybe we spend all this\ntime developing an iPad app and\n\n1089\n00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,380\nthen Apple just rejects it because\nwe broke one of their rules, right.\n\n1090\n00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,510\nAnd they say, oh, you can't do that,\nand they reject it.\n\n1091\n00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:16,580\nWell, could we have identified\nthat ahead of time,\n\n1092\n00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,850\ncould we have taken\nthe means to prevent that.\n\n1093\n00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,790\nWe could have,\nwe just didn't know at this point, right.\n\n1094\n00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,251\nAnd again, in the initiation that's okay.\n\n1095\n00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:29,775\nSummary Milestone Schedule, any project\nhas a start and a finish, right, so\n\n1096\n00:54:29,775 --> 00:54:33,290\nwe know what we're trying\nproduce at the end.\n\n1097\n00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:35,590\nBut it's a good idea to set milestones.\n\n1098\n00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:36,570\nThroughout the project so\n\n1099\n00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:39,210\nthat you have things that you're working\ntowards constantly, things that you can\n\n1100\n00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,060\nuse to meter and measure your progress\nthroughout the project, all right.\n\n1101\n00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,110\nSo at a high level, can we think of\nsome of those milestones, right.\n\n1102\n00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:52,160\nSo, getting a iPad app running on\nour internal test environment and\n\n1103\n00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,680\nthen getting it submitted\nto the app store and\n\n1104\n00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,120\nthen actually getting it\npublished in the app store.\n\n1105\n00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,560\nEach of these might be milestones\nthat we monitor it against to see\n\n1106\n00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,840\nhow we're moving alone.\n\n1107\n00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,050\nJust real high level, summary milestones.\n\n1108\n00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,230\nAgain, we'll revisit this later.\n\n1109\n00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,490\nThis one is one of my favorites,\nright, okay.\n\n1110\n00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:10,100\nSummary budget.\n\n1111\n00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,340\nAt this stage of the game it is so\n\n1112\n00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,780\ndifficult to come up with a budget,\nall right.\n\n1113\n00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,160\nIf, money is no object you\nstill need to set a budget.\n\n1114\n00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,650\nYou still need to figure\nout what things cost.\n\n1115\n00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,270\nWe just don't know what it's going to be.\n\n1116\n00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,470\nSo, we may or\nmay not have this information.\n\n1117\n00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:27,140\nBut, you might say I wanna\ndevelop an iPad app and\n\n1118\n00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,320\nit's worth a certain\namount of money to us.\n\n1119\n00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,000\nIf our customers really want it,\nit's worth a certain amount to us.\n\n1120\n00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,230\nMaybe, let's say $25,000, right.\n\n1121\n00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:39,730\nSo, I would pay up to $25,000 to\nget an iPad app developed, right?\n\n1122\n00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,320\nBut, what if I find out that it\nactually would cost $40,000 well,\n\n1123\n00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,110\nthat's more than I wanted to spend.\n\n1124\n00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:51,250\nAnd that's an arbitrary number that I\npicked out of my head, so this number\n\n1125\n00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:56,580\nmight need to be revisited and looked at,\nit might be that it far less expensive.\n\n1126\n00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,648\nBut we just kind of come up with some kind\nof an idea knowing that we may have to\n\n1127\n00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:00,495\nrevisit that also.\n\n1128\n00:56:03,687 --> 00:56:04,816\nThe stakeholder list.\n\n1129\n00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:07,862\nNow the stakeholder list we\nhave a special process for\n\n1130\n00:56:07,862 --> 00:56:11,651\nthat we'll see here in a minute,\nbut the stakeholder list is a list\n\n1131\n00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:14,916\nof all the people with a vested\ninterest in this project.\n\n1132\n00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:19,451\nAnd so I don't wanna deep dive into that\none right now cuz we are gonna spend a lot\n\n1133\n00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:21,330\nof time on that after the break.\n\n1134\n00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:25,640\nWe've got project approval requirements.\n\n1135\n00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,970\nThis project might not be green-lit yet.\n\n1136\n00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:31,080\nIf I'm signing this charter,\nthat means I'm giving it my authority, but\n\n1137\n00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,460\nit might not be green-lit.\n\n1138\n00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,350\nSo, if there's requirements for\n\n1139\n00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,760\nthis project to be green-lit,\nI should list them right here.\n\n1140\n00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,030\nWhat does it take to make sure\nthis one Is going to run.\n\n1141\n00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,310\nWhat is my success criteria?\n\n1142\n00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,930\nWhat constitutes project success?\n\n1143\n00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:48,390\nWhat decides that project was successful,\nbasically the same thing.\n\n1144\n00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:52,040\nAnd who signs off on this, who is it that\nactually is lending their authority?\n\n1145\n00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:57,490\nWe have to figure that stuff out and\nthat becomes part of the charter too.\n\n1146\n00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:01,540\nAnd then lastly, we've got who's\ngonna be the project manager?\n\n1147\n00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,830\nWho's got responsibility?\n\n1148\n00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:05,520\nAnd who's got what authority level?\n\n1149\n00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,550\nAnd who's granting that authority level?\n\n1150\n00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,150\nSo we might not have\na project manager yet.\n\n1151\n00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,810\nSo in our project charter,\nwe're requesting one.\n\n1152\n00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:15,430\nWe're trying to get one and\nattach them to the project and\n\n1153\n00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:19,070\nthe sponsor is transferring\ntheir authority to that person.\n\n1154\n00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:21,820\nThis is done through a signature field.\n\n1155\n00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,010\nA signature block at the bottom\nof the thing saying, I,\n\n1156\n00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:30,790\nDon Pezet, host, vice president,\nCEO, whatever the heck I am,\n\n1157\n00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:35,280\ngive authority to Nate to be\nthe project manager for this project.\n\n1158\n00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,830\nAnd so now, when Nate acts on the project,\nhe's acting on my behalf.\n\n1159\n00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:44,540\nHe's acting with my authority,\nnormally he has next to no authority.\n\n1160\n00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,930\nAnd now he has my authority.\n\n1161\n00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,770\nSo that's basically what this does,\n\n1162\n00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,490\nit's the single most important\npart of this document.\n\n1163\n00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:53,521\nSo that's all stuff that\nwe'll find in the chart.\n\n1164\n00:57:53,521 --> 00:57:58,390\nAll right now talking about it is\none thing, seeing it is another.\n\n1165\n00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,370\nSo, we're kind of out of\ntime on this segment.\n\n1166\n00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:01,280\nSo let's do this.\n\n1167\n00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,890\nLet's stop and take a break.\n\n1168\n00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:06,090\nAnd when we get back I wanna show you\nwhat a project charter looks like and\n\n1169\n00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,660\nmaybe we'll draft one up.\n\n1170\n00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,750\nKind of get an idea of what\nit looks like and see.\n\n1171\n00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,460\nBut we've got some templates\nthat we'll take a look at and\n\n1172\n00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,330\nkind of mess around with that.\n\n1173\n00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:14,240\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1174\n00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,650\n>> All right, so ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n1175\n00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,710\nWhen we get back,\nwe're gonna drop the project charter.\n\n1176\n00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,080\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1177\n00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,730\nIt's gonna be off the chain.\n\n1178\n00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:28,608\n>> Yup.\n>> All right, we'll back after this.\n\n1179\n00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:30,455\n[MUSIC]\n[SOUND] All right, Welcome back everybody.\n\n1180\n00:58:30,455 --> 00:58:33,790\nSo in the last two segments we were\ntalking about the project charter and\n\n1181\n00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,127\nall the information we need to get and\nall the information to put into and\n\n1182\n00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:38,420\nthat's all fine and good.\n\n1183\n00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,970\n>> Right.\n\n1184\n00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,630\n>> But let's take a look at\nactually making a project or\n\n1185\n00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:42,910\nactually writing one out.\n\n1186\n00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,210\nNow if you're gonna write one out,\nthe first thing to think about is,\n\n1187\n00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,090\nwhat format it's going to be in.\n\n1188\n00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:51,810\nAnd remember that one of our inputs into\nthis process if we go back to our process\n\n1189\n00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,540\nchart, here on my laptop,\nlet's see, there we go.\n\n1190\n00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,600\nYou'll see one of our inputs was\nOrganizational Process Assets, and\n\n1191\n00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,270\nwhat that means is, you're company\nmight already have a template for\n\n1192\n00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,680\ndoing a Project Charter.\n\n1193\n00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,440\nSo instead of having a Create something\nfrom scratch, you go to your PMO or\n\n1194\n00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,820\nyou go to your knowledge base or\nwherever it is you have your old projects.\n\n1195\n00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,400\nYou pull a charter from an old project and\n\n1196\n00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,820\nyou use that to be the template for\nyour new one.\n\n1197\n00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,300\nThat ways it’s all consistent\nacross the different projects.\n\n1198\n00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,410\nThat’s a great way to go about it.\n\n1199\n00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:25,260\nWhat if you’re the first person to\ndeploy formal project management in your\n\n1200\n00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,200\nenvironment though.\n\n1201\n00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,840\nThen you’re not gonna have\nan organizational processes for that.\n\n1202\n00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,570\nSo it's going to be up to you.\n\n1203\n00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,320\nYou can create it from scratch, you know\nthe elements, we've talked about all\n\n1204\n00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,780\nthe different things that are going\nto go in the project charter.\n\n1205\n00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,260\nBut, you don't have to.\n\n1206\n00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:40,440\nYou can go out on the Internet, and\n\n1207\n00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,190\nthere's numerous places where you\ncan get templates for serving this.\n\n1208\n00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:48,700\nYou can go on Amazon.com and\nthere's several books that are out there,\n\n1209\n00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,240\nhere's one of the more popular ones,\na project manager's book of forms.\n\n1210\n00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,070\nA little pricey, it's 60 bucks I think,\nbut it's basically packed full with all of\n\n1211\n00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,310\nthe forms with the different\nphases of a project.\n\n1212\n00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,680\nStill a lot of good stuff in there.\n\n1213\n01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,570\nRight?\nIf you are a PMI member, so\n\n1214\n01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,182\nif you've actually joined\nthe Project Management Institute, the PMI.\n\n1215\n01:00:06,182 --> 01:00:10,490\nIt's $129 a year.\nWe talk about that in another episode.\n\n1216\n01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,460\nBut if you join,\nyou actually get access to these forms,\n\n1217\n01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,060\nthe ones from this book, for free.\n\n1218\n01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:16,940\nLet's see, do I have that?\n\n1219\n01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,670\nHere we go.\n\n1220\n01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,190\nSo I'm logged in with my PMI account, so\n\n1221\n01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:23,430\nyou can go into Knowledge Center,\nTools and Templates.\n\n1222\n01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:26,660\nAnd these are actually\nthe same forms from that book.\n\n1223\n01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,750\nSee, it's got the Project Manager Book\nof Forms, and there they all are.\n\n1224\n01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,790\nSo as a PMI member,\nyou have access to those for free.\n\n1225\n01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:36,980\nSo it's kind of a $60 value, and you'll\nsee right here is a project charter.\n\n1226\n01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,510\nStakeholder analysis,\nwhich we haven't talked about this yet.\n\n1227\n01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,320\nAll the planning forms,\nwhich there's a ton of.\n\n1228\n01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,140\nExecuting forms,\nmonitoring control, closing,\n\n1229\n01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,200\nall the different forms that we need, we\ndon't need to reinvent the wheel, alright.\n\n1230\n01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,210\nYou can also go to other resources.\n\n1231\n01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:56,170\nFor the longest time I used a website\ncalled Gant Head and they've renamed.\n\n1232\n01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:58,220\nIt's now ProjectManagement.com.\n\n1233\n01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,990\nAnd you can go to their website.\n\n1234\n01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,890\nIt's a subscription,\nit's I think $250 a year, and\n\n1235\n01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:07,030\nwhen you subscribe they have tons\nof really, really nice templates.\n\n1236\n01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,240\nOne of the criticisms of\nthe PMI templates, these guys,\n\n1237\n01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,810\nis they don't keep them up to date with\nthe latest versions of Microsoft Office.\n\n1238\n01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:17,500\nAnd so sometimes you get formatting\nissues and they can be hard to work with.\n\n1239\n01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,520\nWith these guys, they keep them\nup to date, but you pay for it.\n\n1240\n01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,870\nIt's kind of expensive, so\nif I go to projects, perform, initiating.\n\n1241\n01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:30,040\nSo here in the initiation phase,\nI'll see a sample, project charter,\n\n1242\n01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,710\nstandard business case, project concept, a\nlot of the different things that we talked\n\n1243\n01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:39,500\nabout, all right here and you'll see where\nthey're labelled as premium deliverables.\n\n1244\n01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,370\nSo that means you've got to be\na subscriber to get to them.\n\n1245\n01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,350\nSome of these are free like\nthe R-O-I calculator and stuff but\n\n1246\n01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,780\nthey've got a lot of good things in here,\nand\n\n1247\n01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,720\nyou'll see various ones,\nif you subscribe you can have them.\n\n1248\n01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,100\nThere's also free sites out there,\nlike projectmanagementdocs.com.\n\n1249\n01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,250\nThey are completely free.\n\n1250\n01:01:56,250 --> 01:02:00,580\nYou can go on here and say all right,\nI'm doing project initiation.\n\n1251\n01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:05,173\nAnd then under initiation we see Business\ncase feasibility study project charter\n\n1252\n01:02:05,173 --> 01:02:08,310\nsingle page and\nproject charter multi-page, right?\n\n1253\n01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:12,470\nI said I like to do the single page one\nbut they've got both of them so you can go\n\n1254\n01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:16,703\nand get these templates you know depending\non which one it is that you prefer.\n\n1255\n01:02:16,703 --> 01:02:19,725\nAnd I think they're just word documents,\naren't they?\n\n1256\n01:02:19,725 --> 01:02:21,260\n>> Yeah, they're all Word documents.\n\n1257\n01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,930\n>> So, and she'll stick a pen in\nyour eye if you're not careful.\n\n1258\n01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:24,630\n>> That's right.\n\n1259\n01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:25,710\n>> So.\n>> Yeah, there's an irony bond on that\n\n1260\n01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,350\nsingle page that you see right here.\n\n1261\n01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:29,160\nIt's actually multiple\npages when you download it.\n\n1262\n01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:29,682\n>> Is it really?\n\n1263\n01:02:29,682 --> 01:02:31,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well looking at it here,\n\n1264\n01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,410\nit does look like a single page.\n\n1265\n01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:33,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's showing us the template.\n\n1266\n01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:38,090\nIt's got a Paragraph one,\nformally authorize the project and so on.\n\n1267\n01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:42,080\nThis is a fairly plain template,\nI like mine a little more structured.\n\n1268\n01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,320\nBut for free the price is right.\n\n1269\n01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,577\nSo what I do is I use some slightly\nmodified templates where I basically take\n\n1270\n01:02:48,577 --> 01:02:52,720\nthe PMI ones and I just fix them to\nwork in the current versions of Office.\n\n1271\n01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,403\nRonnie and I were talking about this\nbefore the show, maybe I'll post some of\n\n1272\n01:02:56,403 --> 01:02:59,460\nthose with the episodes on the site so\nyou guys can use them.\n\n1273\n01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,540\nAgain, use whatever works best for you.\n\n1274\n01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,280\nYour company probably\nalready has some stuff.\n\n1275\n01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,170\nBut basically I've got my own,\nparked around here somewhere.\n\n1276\n01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:09,420\nHere we go.\n\n1277\n01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,380\nSo here's my Project Charter template.\n\n1278\n01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,010\nAll right.\n\n1279\n01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:14,290\nAnd what you'll see is it's\nfairly straight forward.\n\n1280\n01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,650\nIt's basically just got blanks for\nsome of the various information we want.\n\n1281\n01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:21,420\nAnd then it's up to you to pick whether or\nnot you really need this stuff.\n\n1282\n01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,460\nWhat do we really need\nin a project charter?\n\n1283\n01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,390\nWe really just need two things.\n\n1284\n01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,590\nOne is the project description.\n\n1285\n01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,910\nWhat is the project?\n\n1286\n01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:31,780\nAnd two, a signature field for\nthe sponsor.\n\n1287\n01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,710\nWe need the sponsor to sign off\nsaying they authorized the project.\n\n1288\n01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:35,860\nThat's really it.\n\n1289\n01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:39,620\nThat's the bare minimum, those two things,\nthat we need for a project charter.\n\n1290\n01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:41,700\nEverything else is icing on the cake.\n\n1291\n01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:45,230\nIf you've got a ton of information,\nyou can put it all here.\n\n1292\n01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:47,090\nThe more information you do,\nthe better, right?\n\n1293\n01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,110\n>> Right.\n\n1294\n01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:50,130\n>> If you don't have a lot\nof information though,\n\n1295\n01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:52,380\nthen most of these fields\nyou're not going to know.\n\n1296\n01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,690\nAnd I like to keep mine simple.\n\n1297\n01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:56,370\nI like to keep it to one page.\n\n1298\n01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,440\nBut in my template, if you look at it,\nI think I'm actually at two pages.\n\n1299\n01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,060\nWe'll see.\nYeah, I'm at two pages.\n\n1300\n01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:05,040\nSo I'm at two pages because I've\nput in blanks for everything.\n\n1301\n01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,730\nKnowing that I may or may not have them.\n\n1302\n01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:12,650\nAnd so as I work with this project, or\nwhatever, I'll remove various elements\n\n1303\n01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:17,160\nthat I just don't have data for or\nI don't necessarily need yet, okay.\n\n1304\n01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,752\nSo basically, we have this template,\nnow we just fill it out.\n\n1305\n01:04:21,752 --> 01:04:25,242\nBecause the project charter is\nsomewhat informal at this stage,\n\n1306\n01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:28,166\nwe're really just typing a lot\nof this out of our head.\n\n1307\n01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:30,854\nExpert judgment as we\nfill in the information.\n\n1308\n01:04:30,854 --> 01:04:37,110\nNow to keep this exciting,\nwe decided to think of a project.\n\n1309\n01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:40,930\nSome kind of project that we could carry\nthrough our entire shows to create a nice\n\n1310\n01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:44,020\noverarching story line.\n\n1311\n01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,580\nWe looked at our company and\n\n1312\n01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:49,160\nwe said all right, what projects do\nwe have that we can use on the air.\n\n1313\n01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:54,350\nAnd unfortunately a lot of our projects\nlike any kind of web design and\n\n1314\n01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:58,420\nstuff like that, it requires too\nmuch back-end information and\n\n1315\n01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:02,275\nwe can't show that on the air because\nit is it, could jeopardize the,\n\n1316\n01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:05,725\nnot national security but\nthe security of our website and stuff.\n\n1317\n01:05:05,725 --> 01:05:08,585\nWe decided to make up a completely\noff the wall project that\n\n1318\n01:05:08,585 --> 01:05:10,105\nwas just a fun thing to do.\n\n1319\n01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:10,645\n>> Yep.\n\n1320\n01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:13,165\n>> Our producer Nate, Nathan Copeland.\n\n1321\n01:05:13,165 --> 01:05:16,600\nNate is a he's had this idea for\nmonths and months and months.\n\n1322\n01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,250\nHe said, hey, if we're supposed\nto be an Internet start-up,\n\n1323\n01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,800\nedgy like in all the movies and\n\n1324\n01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,546\nstuff, we're supposed to have this\nparty atmosphere, which we sadly don't.\n\n1325\n01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:28,934\n[LAUGH] We're all middle-aged\nprofessionals here,\n\n1326\n01:05:28,934 --> 01:05:34,080\nwe don't really have that, but He said,\nwhat we need is an Arcade Cabinet.\n\n1327\n01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,250\nLike that would really\nfinish up this studio.\n\n1328\n01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,040\nWe need an Arcade Cabinet\nsomewhere around here.\n\n1329\n01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,430\nWell I said, forget it.\n\n1330\n01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,335\nWe're not gonna do that.\n\n1331\n01:05:41,335 --> 01:05:43,710\n[LAUGH] But you know what,\nNate's birthday is this week.\n\n1332\n01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so let's run with it.\n\n1333\n01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:49,100\n>> Let's do it.\n>> We are going to build an IT Pro TV\n\n1334\n01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,630\nvideo game Arcade Cabinet.\n\n1335\n01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,390\nThat's gonna be our project.\n\n1336\n01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:52,960\n>> Yeah.\n\n1337\n01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,410\n>> And one of the things that we start\nwith on a project is the product charter.\n\n1338\n01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,820\nWe need to kick this off, now I mentioned\nthat Nate has had this idea for months.\n\n1339\n01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:03,840\nWell Nate is our producer, and he's the\none that makes sure that the shows run on\n\n1340\n01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,870\ntime, he schedules the shows,\nhe schedules us, the hosts,.\n\n1341\n01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:10,410\nWhen I come in in the morning,\nmy core host is always picked by Nate.\n\n1342\n01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:11,790\nAnd so he runs that.\n\n1343\n01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:16,620\nHe has authority over our shows, but\nhe doesn't have budget authority.\n\n1344\n01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,240\nHe can't approve a financial expense,\nespecially for\n\n1345\n01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,520\nsomething pointless\nlike an Arcade Cabinet.\n\n1346\n01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:26,100\nBut there's other people in\nthe company who can, like myself.\n\n1347\n01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,110\nAnd if Nate wants this project to go,\nwell he can't push it himself.\n\n1348\n01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:33,580\nHe's Kind of like the sponsor, but\n\n1349\n01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,880\nhe doesn't have the authority\nto be the sponsor.\n\n1350\n01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,020\nIn that case, Nate is what is\ncalled the project originator.\n\n1351\n01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,630\nHe is the one that came\nup with the idea but\n\n1352\n01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,730\nhe doesn't have the authority\nto kick it off.\n\n1353\n01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:47,880\nNate has to team up with\nsomebody who can sponsor it.\n\n1354\n01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,030\nIn this case it's going to be me,\nI'm gonna sponsor this project.\n\n1355\n01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,770\nI'm gonna approve it as a budget item or\nwhatever, that's the role for me.\n\n1356\n01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:56,940\nThat doesn't necessarily mean I'm\ngoing to be the project manager.\n\n1357\n01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,920\nI could bring in another project manager.\n\n1358\n01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,330\nMy project team is starting to grow\nright here from the very beginning, and\n\n1359\n01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,980\nthis is stuff we need to know for\nour charter.\n\n1360\n01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,990\nlet's take a look at my charter template\nhere and we will start filling it out,.\n\n1361\n01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,520\nMy project title, this is where\nI'll start and this is going to be\n\n1362\n01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:22,840\nthe IP Pro TV Arcade Cabinet build out,\nor we'll just call it that,\n\n1363\n01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:28,790\nIT Pro TV Arcade Cabinet and apparently\nIP Pro TV is not in the dictionary?\n\n1364\n01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:29,470\nHow is that possible?\n\n1365\n01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:31,060\nThere we go, all right.\n\n1366\n01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,480\nThen the project sponsor.\n\n1367\n01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,220\nNow remember, the sponsor is the person\nwho has the authority in the company to\n\n1368\n01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,070\npick this project off.\n\n1369\n01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:40,420\nNate is the one who thought of it, but\n\n1370\n01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:43,320\nhe doesn't have the authority, I'm the one\nwho's going to have to initiate it.\n\n1371\n01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,240\nI'm gonna put in here,\nDon Pizzet, I'm the sponsor.\n\n1372\n01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:46,840\nAll right?\n\n1373\n01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,390\nAnd because we're doing the show,\n\n1374\n01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:51,770\nI'll go ahead and\nbe the project manager also, all right?\n\n1375\n01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:55,110\nNow project customer,\nI don't really have a customer.\n\n1376\n01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:59,280\nThis is really designed for if we\nare doing contract work for somebody else,\n\n1377\n01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,910\nlike a third party.\n\n1378\n01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,100\nIn this case the customers\nis really just us.\n\n1379\n01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:09,800\nBecause this whole point of the charter\nwe modified to our needs I will change it\n\n1380\n01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:15,582\nto instead of saying project customer I\nwill change it to project originated,\n\n1381\n01:08:15,582 --> 01:08:16,950\nall right.\n\n1382\n01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:20,930\nI want to keep a record in here so\nthat I can remember that.\n\n1383\n01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,720\nIs the one who came up with this idea,\nall right?\n\n1384\n01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,250\nAnd then Dave prepared that will be today\n\n1385\n01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:30,230\nwhich it is-\n>> The 20th of May.\n\n1386\n01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,330\n>> It's the 20th already?\n\n1387\n01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:32,180\n>> It is.\n\n1388\n01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:36,580\n>> Time flies when you're having fun,\nright, there we go 5/20/14.\n\n1389\n01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,610\nThen we start moving\nto our other elements.\n\n1390\n01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:40,870\nNow when you look at these\nsome of these will seem very,\n\n1391\n01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:45,750\nvery similar you may not need them all,\nyou can choose to delete ones out.\n\n1392\n01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,680\nRemember, it's not an official thing.\n\n1393\n01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,830\nOn the exam, be aware that you might\nsee all of these in the questions, so\n\n1394\n01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,540\nyou wanna be familiar with each field.\n\n1395\n01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,170\nBut in practice you're just\npicking the ones that you need.\n\n1396\n01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:03,000\nProject purpose, no, of that should be\nand, and justification, there we go.\n\n1397\n01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,730\nThis is kind of like our business case.\n\n1398\n01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:07,930\nWhy are we doing this project?\n\n1399\n01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:11,440\nWhat's the purpose of it,.\n\n1400\n01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:17,030\nMy purpose is, this is going\nto be a Demonstration project\n\n1401\n01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:25,770\nto help illustrate project management\nconcepts for the PMP show.\n\n1402\n01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:30,520\nWe want to show you guys how to manage\na project in the PMP shows, and\n\n1403\n01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,760\nwe need some kind of project,\nthat's our justification.\n\n1404\n01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,520\nDo we actually need an Arcade Cabinet?\n\n1405\n01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,660\nNo.\nIs that gonna help our business at all?\n\n1406\n01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,870\nNo.\nThere's not a whole heck of\n\n1407\n01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:38,546\na lot of point there.\n\n1408\n01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:44,590\nIt will improve morale.\n\n1409\n01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:47,470\nImprove employee morale.\n\n1410\n01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:51,480\nAt the same time decreasing productivity.\n\n1411\n01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,830\nMaybe we don't put that in there.\n\n1412\n01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:57,500\nBut we need to keep that\nkind of stuff in mind.\n\n1413\n01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,760\nThen, product description.\n\n1414\n01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,290\nWhat is this project going to be?\n\n1415\n01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:08,174\nAnd so we’ll put here,\nwe are going to design,\n\n1416\n01:10:08,174 --> 01:10:12,589\nand construct an arcade cabinet for\n\n1417\n01:10:12,589 --> 01:10:16,362\nemployee and visitor use.\n\n1418\n01:10:16,362 --> 01:10:18,080\nAll right, so\nanybody who comes by the theater or\n\n1419\n01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,410\nthe studio will be able to walk up to this\nthing and play a video game if they want.\n\n1420\n01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:25,680\nThey want to pass some time or whatever,\nit'll be there and they can use it.\n\n1421\n01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,700\nHigh level requirements,\nnow when you have requirements you can go\n\n1422\n01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,290\nextremely detailed to whatever, but\nwe're still in the initiation phace.\n\n1423\n01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:35,130\nWe really just talked\nabout it this morning,\n\n1424\n01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:39,080\nI don't know a whole heck of a lot\nabout our paid cabinets and so really,\n\n1425\n01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:44,550\nI'm gonna need to reach out to Nate and\nsay okay, Nate, this is your baby.\n\n1426\n01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:48,870\nIf we want to make you happy, what are\nsome of the things that we're gonna need?\n\n1427\n01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:52,200\nWhat is it going to need\nto be considered a success?\n\n1428\n01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,660\nAnd so we need to make some decisions like\n\n1429\n01:10:55,660 --> 01:11:00,620\nfirst off we need to\ndecide on a cabinet type.\n\n1430\n01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:07,473\nWe'll have a Custom built wooden Cabinet.\n\n1431\n01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,480\nWe'll need to figure out how many players,\nwe want to support.\n\n1432\n01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:15,070\nDo we want to support just single player,\nor to four player, or whatever.\n\n1433\n01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:19,050\nAnd in fact, Nate can you, are you near\nenough to the set, yeah there you are.\n\n1434\n01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:21,710\nWhat do you think,\nshould we do one to four players?\n\n1435\n01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:23,730\nFour.\nGotta go four.\n\n1436\n01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,860\nAll right, so.\n\n1437\n01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:29,856\nWe'll put in here that we are going to do,\nlet's see, must support up\n\n1438\n01:11:29,856 --> 01:11:35,690\nto four players,.\n\n1439\n01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:38,690\nAgain, kind of detailing this\ninformation and putting it in there.\n\n1440\n01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:44,370\nAnd Nate, is this going to be a standing\none or a sitting tabletop one?\n\n1441\n01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:44,870\n>> Upright.\n\n1442\n01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:46,690\n>> Upright, so upright.\n\n1443\n01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:48,170\nCabinet.\nProbably good have combined those\n\n1444\n01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,440\nfirst two, right?\n\n1445\n01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,760\nAgain, not going really specific.\n\n1446\n01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,380\nNot saying it needs to be this many inches\n>> Right.\n\n1447\n01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,440\n>> Tall, this many inches wide,\ncuz I don't know that stuff yet.\n\n1448\n01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,330\nI'm just coming up with\nsome high level stuff.\n\n1449\n01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:02,500\nIf we can create a Custom built wooden\nCabinet that supports up to four players,\n\n1450\n01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:06,840\nthat contains a PC to power the games.\n\n1451\n01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,540\nTo play the games.\n\n1452\n01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,476\nWhen this is all said and done,\n\n1453\n01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:14,657\nwe should have a successful game\nthat meets his desires and needs.\n\n1454\n01:12:14,657 --> 01:12:16,665\nAnd we can think of other things.\n\n1455\n01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:20,358\nDo you just want to have a joystick, or\ndo you want to have the trackball also?\n\n1456\n01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:21,588\nStuff like that.\n\n1457\n01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,005\nHe's nodding his head.\n\n1458\n01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:31,340\nSo, joystick and trackball support,\nthese are all things we've gotta think of.\n\n1459\n01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:34,050\nNow, because we're in\nthe initiation phase,\n\n1460\n01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:36,120\nsome of these might change in planning.\n\n1461\n01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,845\nWe might find out that that trackball\noption costs a ton of money, and so\n\n1462\n01:12:39,845 --> 01:12:40,490\nwe cut it out.\n\n1463\n01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,800\nWe'll see,\nwe'll get to that in the planning phase.\n\n1464\n01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,000\n>> Let's say that it also has to\nsupport like an arcade like feel,\n\n1465\n01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,690\nlike the artistic idea and again,\n\n1466\n01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:54,130\nanother aspect that we may see later on\nwhere unless Don or Nate can really draw,\n\n1467\n01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:57,190\nthey may actually be a requirement\nthat we kind of axe out as well.\n\n1468\n01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,790\nThe arcade like feel.\n\n1469\n01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,680\n>> So the artwork and\nall the stuff that's on the thing.\n\n1470\n01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,180\nYeah.\n>> Yeah, artwork.\n\n1471\n01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:04,480\nActually I haven't Pop quarters into it.\n\n1472\n01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:08,890\n>> This is the type of requirement\nthat I would just dread\n\n1473\n01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:12,490\nif this was in our final scope statement,\nbecause how do you measure that?\n\n1474\n01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:16,340\nYou can't measure that, and\nwhen we actually sit down and\n\n1475\n01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,810\nnail this down in stone,\nright now we're just kinda thinking, but\n\n1476\n01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,230\nwhen we nail it down in stone.\n\n1477\n01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:23,450\nYou can't have subjective terms like this.\n\n1478\n01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:24,610\nAn arcade feel.\n\n1479\n01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:25,490\nWell, what the heck is that?\n\n1480\n01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:27,570\nSo, you really do have to get specific.\n\n1481\n01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,430\nSo, we'll have to revisit this\nin planning but that's fine.\n\n1482\n01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:31,622\nThis is the way that projects start.\n\n1483\n01:13:31,622 --> 01:13:33,730\nAll right.\n\n1484\n01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,030\nSo, next we've got our high level risks.\n\n1485\n01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:37,965\nWhat are the risks that we have?\n\n1486\n01:13:37,965 --> 01:13:39,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n1487\n01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,110\nwell the number one risk\nthat I can think of,\n\n1488\n01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:46,242\nis that when you build an arcade\ncabinet you need video games.\n\n1489\n01:13:46,242 --> 01:13:48,390\nThis is not very useful\nwithout a video game, right?\n\n1490\n01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,240\nSo we need licensed video games.\n\n1491\n01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,070\nYou gotta be allowed to do it.\n\n1492\n01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:53,890\n>> That's right.\n>> There are tons of websites out there\n\n1493\n01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:55,940\nwith unlicensed games, and that's illegal.\n\n1494\n01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,150\nRight?\nSo we don't wanna do that,\n\n1495\n01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:58,400\nwe need to be on the up and up.\n\n1496\n01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:05,140\nSo we either need to get public domain\ngames, or ones that we hold a license for.\n\n1497\n01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,406\nSo, so one of the high level\nrisks that we have is,\n\n1498\n01:14:08,406 --> 01:14:14,890\nusing unlicensed intellectual property.\n\n1499\n01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,820\nAnd I'm gonna go real general like\nthat because it's not just the games.\n\n1500\n01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,835\nYou mentioned artwork Ronnie.\n\n1501\n01:14:18,835 --> 01:14:20,830\n>> Yep.\n>> If we used unlicensed artwork on this\n\n1502\n01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,800\nthing we could get in trouble.\n\n1503\n01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,751\nWe also have worker injury because\nsomebody is gonna have to make\n\n1504\n01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:29,590\nthis cabinet, right?\n\n1505\n01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,933\nAnd so they're gonna be using a band saw\nor deck saw or whatever somebody could cut\n\n1506\n01:14:32,933 --> 01:14:35,601\nthemselves, so we gotta make\nsure we deal with worker's comp.\n\n1507\n01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:36,935\n>> Carpal Tunnel.\n\n1508\n01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:38,454\n[LAUGH]\n>> After the project,\n\n1509\n01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:40,490\nI don't even know to spell that.\n\n1510\n01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:42,366\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome.\n\n1511\n01:14:42,366 --> 01:14:44,704\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that could happen,\n\n1512\n01:14:44,704 --> 01:14:48,366\nsomebody plays video games too much,\nright?\n\n1513\n01:14:48,366 --> 01:14:50,160\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1514\n01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,270\n>> Is that the same thing?\n\n1515\n01:14:52,308 --> 01:14:55,135\nAll right, [LAUGH] well we'll just leave\nit at that, we don't have to go too crazy.\n\n1516\n01:14:55,135 --> 01:14:55,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1517\n01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,220\na couple of high level risks\nthat we can think of right now.\n\n1518\n01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:02,109\nDon't go crazy, because we're gonna have\nan entire risk process a little bit later\n\n1519\n01:15:02,109 --> 01:15:05,390\nwhere we'll evaluate a lot more of this,\nall right.\n\n1520\n01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:06,880\nProject objectives.\n\n1521\n01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,610\nNow this is a tough one cuz\nyou might not have these yet.\n\n1522\n01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:13,310\n>> Yep.\n>> This is scope, time, cost, right.\n\n1523\n01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:16,060\nRemember, where's my drawing?\n\n1524\n01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,430\nThis guy right here.\n\n1525\n01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:22,290\nEvery project has three constraints,\nscope, which is your requirements list,\n\n1526\n01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:25,660\ntime, which is your schedule and\ncost, which is your budget, right?\n\n1527\n01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,870\nWe're always thinking\nabout these three things.\n\n1528\n01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:31,690\nIf I already know my budget,\nif I already know my schedule,\n\n1529\n01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:35,010\nif I already know my scope,\nI can put all that in the chart, right?\n\n1530\n01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,800\nBut most projects don't have that yet.\n\n1531\n01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,803\nThat comes about in the planning phase.\n\n1532\n01:15:38,803 --> 01:15:42,075\nSo, as we stare at it right now we can\nsort of ballpark some of this, but\n\n1533\n01:15:42,075 --> 01:15:45,956\nwe might wanna just delete this field out\naltogether and say I just don't know yet,\n\n1534\n01:15:45,956 --> 01:15:46,523\nall right?\n\n1535\n01:15:46,523 --> 01:15:50,006\nBut I kind of do have\nsome things that we know.\n\n1536\n01:15:50,006 --> 01:15:54,318\nSo for the scope,\nwe'll just say see above,\n\n1537\n01:15:54,318 --> 01:16:01,140\nbecause we already have some high\nlevel requirements up here, right.\n\n1538\n01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,300\nSo I'm just gonna reference that up above.\n\n1539\n01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,130\nNo point doubling our work.\n\n1540\n01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:10,280\nSo, see requirements above.\n\n1541\n01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:14,975\nAnd then for the time I'll put,\nwell, here's the deal.\n\n1542\n01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1543\n01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:19,293\n>> We don't necessarily need\nthe arcade cabinet ever, right?\n\n1544\n01:16:19,293 --> 01:16:21,841\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Better yet, tomorrow or next week, but\n\n1545\n01:16:21,841 --> 01:16:26,060\nyou never wanna get involved in a project\nthat doesn't have a time frame.\n\n1546\n01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,270\nAt a minimum you need a start date, right?\n\n1547\n01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:31,040\nAnd when you work with software\nlike Microsoft Project,\n\n1548\n01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,820\nor what's the one from\nComputer Associates?\n\n1549\n01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:39,040\nI think it's just called Project,\noh, Open Workbench.\n\n1550\n01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,370\nSo if you're using like Open Work Bench or\nwhatever, when you create that project,\n\n1551\n01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:46,260\nyou have to set either a start time or\na finish time.\n\n1552\n01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,120\nYou can't just set no date.\n\n1553\n01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,250\nSo your time might be as\nsimple as a start date.\n\n1554\n01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,860\nWhen do we wanna start work on this?\n\n1555\n01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:53,360\nTomorrow.\n\n1556\n01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,520\nAll right.\n\n1557\n01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,150\nOr next week or next month.\n\n1558\n01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,320\nOr we can say when do we need it by.\n\n1559\n01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,680\nWe need this by December first.\n\n1560\n01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,820\nI don't care when you start,\nwe just need it by December first.\n\n1561\n01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,600\nSo you plan around that, and\n\n1562\n01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,650\nwhen we get into our project\ninformation management, or PRM.\n\n1563\n01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:13,390\nWhen we get into any of\nthat kind of software,\n\n1564\n01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:16,410\nyou're working around these dates.\n\n1565\n01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:21,480\nSo let's say for\nexample that I want to start immediately.\n\n1566\n01:17:24,045 --> 01:17:30,420\nAnd I want to finish by,\nif it's May 20th let's just say June 31st.\n\n1567\n01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,090\nOkay?\n\n1568\n01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:35,190\nI want this thing up and going by the end\nof June, so we've got it for the summer.\n\n1569\n01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:39,230\nAnd then for the cost, well,\n\n1570\n01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:44,100\nI have zero idea of what one of\nthese arcade cabinets cost, and\n\n1571\n01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:48,630\nI'm the guy authorizing this project so\nI need to set some kind of expectation.\n\n1572\n01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,980\nSo I'm gonna pick an arbitrary\nnumber completely out of my hat.\n\n1573\n01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,160\nNow I've got next to no\ninformation to go on.\n\n1574\n01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:57,390\nBut again, in the initiation\nphase this is often the case.\n\n1575\n01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:59,970\nYou don't necessarily have all\nof the information you need.\n\n1576\n01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:08,854\nSo I'm gonna put in here\na maximum cost of $2,000.\n\n1577\n01:18:08,854 --> 01:18:13,293\nNow, I'm hoping it'll be less and\nin the planning phase we're gonna get some\n\n1578\n01:18:13,293 --> 01:18:17,122\nquotes, we're gonna find out\nwhat are the equipment we need.\n\n1579\n01:18:17,122 --> 01:18:18,850\nWe're gonna figure all that out and\n\n1580\n01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:21,220\nget an idea of what the actual\ncost is going to be.\n\n1581\n01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,590\nSo my budget at the end of\nthe day may be much lower,\n\n1582\n01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,770\nmight be $1,000 it might be $500.\n\n1583\n01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:28,050\nHopefully, [LAUGH] that would be nice.\n\n1584\n01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:30,340\nSo, we'll see how low we can get it.\n\n1585\n01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:34,900\nBut for right now, I'm just saying for\nme, if Nate came to me and\n\n1586\n01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,040\nsaid $2,000,\nI'd be a little hesitant to that.\n\n1587\n01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,550\nI'd be like, ooh, two grand,\nthat's kind of a lot of money.\n\n1588\n01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:41,976\nBut, if it was $2,500 I'd say no,\nthis project's over.\n\n1589\n01:18:41,976 --> 01:18:43,020\nRight?\n\n1590\n01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,670\nSo, I'm thinking of my\ntolerance as the sponsor.\n\n1591\n01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:48,910\nNow if I say, no, this is out.\n\n1592\n01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:50,630\nThere's other sponsors here, right.\n\n1593\n01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,500\nNate could go to one\nof the other sponsors.\n\n1594\n01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,770\nHey, Don wasn't comfortable with this.\n\n1595\n01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,940\nBut how about you?\n\n1596\n01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,110\nYou've got budget authority.\n\n1597\n01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:58,140\nAre you cool with $5,000?\n\n1598\n01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,510\nAnd maybe find that.\n\n1599\n01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:01,840\nAnd you'll see that\nwith project champions.\n\n1600\n01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,780\nEspecially in like government programs\nwhere you might get turned down by\n\n1601\n01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:09,020\none area, but you can pitch it to\nother areas until it makes it.\n\n1602\n01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,620\nEvery movie is like that.\n\n1603\n01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,330\nEvery Hollywood movie is a project, and\n\n1604\n01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:16,690\nthey start by trying to sell\nthat project to each studio.\n\n1605\n01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:19,860\nSo you might go to Miramax, or Universal,\n\n1606\n01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,400\nor whoever and\nyou might get turned down four times.\n\n1607\n01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,640\nBut then you finally find somebody\nwho is willing to say you know what?\n\n1608\n01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,700\nI think it's worth a 100 million\nto make Cat Woman part 2.\n\n1609\n01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:32,160\nAnd there's a studio out\nthere that will do it.\n\n1610\n01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:32,860\nYou just have to find them.\n\n1611\n01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:35,705\nSo I'm going to say this is the maximum.\n\n1612\n01:19:35,705 --> 01:19:39,105\nIf we find in planning that it's\nabove this, I'm not gonna do it.\n\n1613\n01:19:39,105 --> 01:19:40,515\nThis project's over.\n\n1614\n01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:42,195\nBut, I think we'll come well below that,\nwe'll see.\n\n1615\n01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:45,785\nAll right, next I've got my milestones.\n\n1616\n01:19:45,785 --> 01:19:49,210\nNow, I need to fix my formatting here.\n\n1617\n01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:50,980\nHow do you insert a page break?\n\n1618\n01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,930\nHere we go, let's do a page break, there.\n\n1619\n01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:56,710\nAnd you'll find that as you work\nwith these scope statements and\n\n1620\n01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:59,070\nstuff that your formatting\ncan get a little messed up so\n\n1621\n01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:03,060\nI just had to do a page\nbreak to move this down.\n\n1622\n01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:04,550\nSo we are there, all right.\n\n1623\n01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:07,370\nSo next, summary milestones, all right.\n\n1624\n01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,979\nAs we develop this arcade,\nthe arcade cabinet.\n\n1625\n01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:14,056\nWhat are our major milestones,\nwhat are we gonna hit?\n\n1626\n01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:16,239\nNow this is a hard one for\nme to fill out, because.\n\n1627\n01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:19,495\nI don't know how much time a lot\nof this stuff is gonna take.\n\n1628\n01:20:19,495 --> 01:20:23,833\nBut, here we are on May 20th,\nI've set this arbitrary date of June 31st,\n\n1629\n01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:25,830\nI'm kinda of okay if that slips.\n\n1630\n01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,680\nBut that's the date I've picked,\nso we've got about five weeks.\n\n1631\n01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,310\nAll right?\n\n1632\n01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:32,325\nSo, how much time is\nthis stuff going to take?\n\n1633\n01:20:32,325 --> 01:20:36,895\nWell, we need to start\nby selecting a plan.\n\n1634\n01:20:36,895 --> 01:20:37,585\nRight?\n\n1635\n01:20:37,585 --> 01:20:41,635\nWe've gotta come up with the design and\nthe equipment that we're going to use and\n\n1636\n01:20:41,635 --> 01:20:43,305\nthe quote.\n\n1637\n01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:50,953\nSo my major events are going\nto be select hardware/design.\n\n1638\n01:20:50,953 --> 01:20:52,196\nAll right?\n\n1639\n01:20:52,196 --> 01:20:57,410\nThen we're gonna have to get our quotes.\n\n1640\n01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:58,335\nSo get quotes.\n\n1641\n01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:02,620\nAnd procure equipment.\n\n1642\n01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:04,580\nRight?\n\n1643\n01:21:05,582 --> 01:21:08,910\nWell actually it would be not just be\ngetting the quotes, we would need to\n\n1644\n01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:15,820\nselect seller, which is an old term\nthat PMI doesn't use so much anymore.\n\n1645\n01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:18,840\nBut they used to have the select seller\nprocess where you would get quotes from\n\n1646\n01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,030\neverybody and you'd pick who would be the\nwinner, who you would choose to buy from.\n\n1647\n01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:23,930\nSo selecting the seller and\nprocuring the equipment.\n\n1648\n01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:25,870\nThat means we actually\nbuy all the materials.\n\n1649\n01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:26,580\nRight?\n\n1650\n01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,884\nAnd then we would have\nconstruction of the cabinet.\n\n1651\n01:21:32,737 --> 01:21:33,423\nRight?\n\n1652\n01:21:33,423 --> 01:21:36,790\nSo we actually build the cabinet, and\n\n1653\n01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:42,430\nthen installation of the components.\n\n1654\n01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:49,030\nSo the PC and the joysticks and\nall that stuff, and then Final testing.\n\n1655\n01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,320\nSo we've got to do testing\nof the software and\n\n1656\n01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,820\nmake sure this all works before\nwe say this thing is done.\n\n1657\n01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:54,430\nAlright.\n\n1658\n01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:55,970\nNow I've got due dates.\n\n1659\n01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,030\nI don't really know.\nI don't\n\n1660\n01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:00,730\nreally know how long it's going to take\nfor us to pick the hardware design.\n\n1661\n01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:03,165\nI know I've got five weeks so\nI don't want to take too long.\n\n1662\n01:22:03,165 --> 01:22:04,040\nRight?\nSo\n\n1663\n01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,410\nI might be able to pick\nan arbitrary date there.\n\n1664\n01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:08,110\nToday is May 20th.\n\n1665\n01:22:08,110 --> 01:22:11,230\nSo maybe I'll pick three days from now.\n\n1666\n01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:15,620\nIn the next three days we need to pick\nthat hardware so I'm going to say 5/23.\n\n1667\n01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:17,195\nThat's my due date on that one.\n\n1668\n01:22:17,195 --> 01:22:17,710\nRight?\n\n1669\n01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:20,920\nBut after that, selecting the seller and\nprocuring the equipment.\n\n1670\n01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,770\nIf I go to buy this equipment can\nI get it shipped in two days?\n\n1671\n01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,290\nCan I get it shipped in 10 days?\n\n1672\n01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,010\nI just don't know.\n\n1673\n01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:27,760\nI don't know how long\nthat is going to take.\n\n1674\n01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,540\nSo I'm gonna leave\nthe rest of these blank.\n\n1675\n01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:35,290\nIt's okay to leave things blank when\nyou're in the initiation phase.\n\n1676\n01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:39,440\nIn the planning phase it's not,\nyou're trying to find these values.\n\n1677\n01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,460\nSo I'm gonna leave those empty for\nright now.\n\n1678\n01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,980\nBut those are my major milestones.\n\n1679\n01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:44,370\nI might have more or less.\n\n1680\n01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:47,020\nSo I could add more to this table or\nremove some if we need.\n\n1681\n01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:49,300\nAll right, estimated budget.\n\n1682\n01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,375\nI don't know.\n\n1683\n01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:53,050\nOkay?\nI've already set my maximum limit\n\n1684\n01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:55,530\nup above, so\nthis is gonna be the first one that I do.\n\n1685\n01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:57,870\nI'm just gonna get rid of that section.\n\n1686\n01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:00,690\nI don't need it I don't have\nan estimated budget yet,\n\n1687\n01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:03,320\nI just have that one statement\nup above in my scope.\n\n1688\n01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:05,560\nAnd then stake holders.\n\n1689\n01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,460\nWho are the stake holders?\n\n1690\n01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:09,310\nWell, I know there's me, Don Passett, and\n\n1691\n01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:15,318\nI'm gonna be the sponsor/ project manager.\n\n1692\n01:23:15,318 --> 01:23:16,170\nAlright?\n\n1693\n01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:19,478\nWe've got Nathan Copeland.\n\n1694\n01:23:19,478 --> 01:23:21,462\nCopeland.\n\n1695\n01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:24,830\n[LAUGH]\nJeez.\n\n1696\n01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:29,980\nThere we go who is the originator and\n\n1697\n01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:37,310\nI'm going to just call him the key\nstake holder jolder it's Nordic.\n\n1698\n01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:43,492\nThere we go and who else we'll\ngo ahead and attach Ronnie Wong.\n\n1699\n01:23:43,492 --> 01:23:44,590\nRight?\n\n1700\n01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:47,850\n>> Yep.\n>> You are going to be the Assistant PM.\n\n1701\n01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:51,110\nThe assistant to the assistant.\n\n1702\n01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,820\nAnd who else do we want to attach?\n\n1703\n01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:53,670\nOh, Rob.\n\n1704\n01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:54,460\n>> Rob.\n\n1705\n01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:58,320\n>> Our web designer, Rob McGarry,\nmulti-talented individual.\n\n1706\n01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,160\nIn a past life, was a carpenter.\n\n1707\n01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,470\nAnd so, he is gonna be the perfect\nperson to make this cabinet.\n\n1708\n01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:05,230\nSo, I’m gonna add Rob here.\n\n1709\n01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:10,172\nRob is going to be our SME for\nthe cabinet.\n\n1710\n01:24:10,172 --> 01:24:11,120\nAll right?\n\n1711\n01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,410\nNow, he’s a Mac guy, so I don’t think\nhe’s gonna be able to help us so\n\n1712\n01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:15,209\nmuch-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1713\n01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:16,006\n>> on the video game side.\n\n1714\n01:24:16,006 --> 01:24:16,970\nWe’ll have to see.\n\n1715\n01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:19,750\nBut on the cabinet side,\nhe's our expert, so\n\n1716\n01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:23,140\nwe're going to add him\nin as a stakeholder.\n\n1717\n01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:23,880\nAll right.\n\n1718\n01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,490\nSo, here's some of my stakeholders.\n\n1719\n01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:27,190\nIf I know more put 'em in.\n\n1720\n01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:27,720\n>> Right.\n\n1721\n01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:31,070\n>> if you don't know 'em, at least put\nthe project manager or the sponsor and\n\n1722\n01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:34,870\nthat's it, but for right now these\nare the four I can think of.\n\n1723\n01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,470\nAll right.\n\n1724\n01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,380\nProject manager authority level.\n\n1725\n01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,099\nNow, this one's normally important,\nit's not so important on this one.\n\n1726\n01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:46,760\nIf the sponsor is giving authority to\nthe project manager to pull off a project,\n\n1727\n01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:51,340\nwell, that project manager is\nacting on behalf of the sponsor and\n\n1728\n01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:53,500\nso they have the same level of authority.\n\n1729\n01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,760\nWe don't always want that.\n\n1730\n01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:00,450\nWe may want to impose boundaries and\nsay within the scope of this project,\n\n1731\n01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:03,800\nyes they act with my authority,\nbut outside of that.\n\n1732\n01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,350\nLike, let's say I had hire and\nfire abilities and\n\n1733\n01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:11,010\nRonnie was the project manager, and\nI was sponsoring a project for him.\n\n1734\n01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:14,700\nWell, I don't want him to be\nable to hire and fire personnel.\n\n1735\n01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:18,880\nHe can kick people off his project, but I\ndon't want him to be able to fire people.\n\n1736\n01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,210\nSo I would put that\nlimitation right in here.\n\n1737\n01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:22,820\nProject manager authority level.\n\n1738\n01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:28,260\nI would say inside of the project,\nRonnie has my full authority.\n\n1739\n01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:31,540\nBut outside of the project,\nas far as personnel, payroll,\n\n1740\n01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,330\nright, I don't want him\ngiving people raises.\n\n1741\n01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,700\nI'd put that limit in there.\n\n1742\n01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,900\nRight?\nThat's what this block would be used for.\n\n1743\n01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,520\nNow in my case, I'm the sponsor and\nthe project manager.\n\n1744\n01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,740\nSo I'm going to have\nthe same level of authority.\n\n1745\n01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:45,640\nSo this field is not necessary,\nand so I'll get rid of it.\n\n1746\n01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,916\nAll right?\n\n1747\n01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:49,350\nStaffing decisions?\n\n1748\n01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:54,040\nI might know that I need a carpenter,\nbut not have one available, right?\n\n1749\n01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,430\nOr I might need a carpenter and\n\n1750\n01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,890\nknow that there's somebody on\nmy staff who would be perfect.\n\n1751\n01:25:57,890 --> 01:26:01,090\nMaybe if we're an IT company,\nmaybe we have 10 web designers.\n\n1752\n01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:04,220\nAnd I know there's one who's gonna\ndo a better job than anybody else.\n\n1753\n01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,220\nIn my staffing decision,\n\n1754\n01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:09,610\nI might put I prefer Bob because\nI've worked with him previously.\n\n1755\n01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:11,230\nI've got a good rapport or whatever.\n\n1756\n01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:13,830\nSo, those are the types of things\nwe have in staffing decisions.\n\n1757\n01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:15,310\nBut as it stands,\n\n1758\n01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:17,820\nI've kind of listed some of those I\ndon't really have anything to add there.\n\n1759\n01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,070\nSo I'll just remove that field.\n\n1760\n01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,140\nAll right?\n\n1761\n01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,030\nBudget management and variance.\n\n1762\n01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,960\nAll right?\nThis is\n\n1763\n01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,330\nwho's going to be in\ncontrol of the budget.\n\n1764\n01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:30,250\nIf the project manager does not\nhave financial authority, so,\n\n1765\n01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:34,450\nlike when I was a PM at a bank I\ndidn't have financial authority.\n\n1766\n01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:38,710\nSo, I ran the project,\nwe had a multi-million dollar budget, but\n\n1767\n01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:40,070\nI couldn't sign a check.\n\n1768\n01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:40,590\nRight?\n\n1769\n01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:44,360\nSo any time we had to cut a check to a\nvendor, I had to go to accounting and say,\n\n1770\n01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,470\nhey, I'm the PM for this project.\n\n1771\n01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:49,010\nHere's my project number,\nhere's my authority number.\n\n1772\n01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:50,510\nCan you cut a check to this vendor?\n\n1773\n01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:52,160\nHere's the contract information.\n\n1774\n01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,510\nAnd they would cut the check.\n\n1775\n01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:56,070\nAnd so we would put that in\nhere under budget management.\n\n1776\n01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:59,390\nWe would put what the project and\nauthority number was if we had them,\n\n1777\n01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:01,740\nour code of accounting if we had that.\n\n1778\n01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:05,360\nYou put that information in here as far\nas how the money is going to be handled.\n\n1779\n01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:05,950\nAll right?\n\n1780\n01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:08,330\nBut as it stands again for our project,\n\n1781\n01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:12,450\nsmaller company this will probably just\ngo on the old company card or something.\n\n1782\n01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:15,130\nSo I'm going to remove this one,\nI don't really have that.\n\n1783\n01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:18,770\nVariance, though, that's, how about, what\nhappens if we deviate from the budget?\n\n1784\n01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,440\nCan we deviate?\n\n1785\n01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,230\n>> Yeah.\n>> Can we even go over?\n\n1786\n01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,500\nWe could specify that.\n\n1787\n01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,040\nIn this case, I don't really have that,\nso I'll just remove that field.\n\n1788\n01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:29,630\nAlright, technical decisions, right?\n\n1789\n01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:32,320\nAgain, same thing, if you've got\na different person who's actually\n\n1790\n01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,000\nresponsible for the technical side.\n\n1791\n01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,310\nMaybe I work in a hospital, and I'm\nthe head doctor of the brain surgery unit.\n\n1792\n01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:44,470\nAnd I've decided that we're gonna bring\nin this new brain scanner, right?\n\n1793\n01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:45,700\nIt's state of the art.\n\n1794\n01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:49,180\nI just read about it in the American\nmedical journals last month and\n\n1795\n01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:49,760\nit's phenomenal.\n\n1796\n01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,280\nWe definitely have to get\nthis brain scanner, right?\n\n1797\n01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,770\nBut I need somebody to\nmake technical decisions.\n\n1798\n01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,331\nIf it turns out that brain\nscanner is running Windows 98.\n\n1799\n01:27:58,331 --> 01:27:59,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not secure,\n\n1800\n01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:01,510\nit might not be allowed on our network.\n\n1801\n01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,861\nIf it turns out that brain scanner\nrequires some sort of special power that\n\n1802\n01:28:04,861 --> 01:28:08,484\nwe can't have in the hospital, that\ndoesn't support our redundant backups,\n\n1803\n01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:10,391\nthen we're not going to be able to use it.\n\n1804\n01:28:10,391 --> 01:28:14,227\nSo I would put in your information about\nwho makes those technical decisions or\n\n1805\n01:28:14,227 --> 01:28:17,085\ndecisions that we've made already,\nif we've made any.\n\n1806\n01:28:17,085 --> 01:28:21,651\nSo I might put in here,\nthat it must use 110v power,\n\n1807\n01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:25,540\ncuz here in the US that's the common,\nright?\n\n1808\n01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:29,083\nI don't want anything,\nnot volts, it's watts, isn't it?\n\n1809\n01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:29,965\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n1810\n01:28:29,965 --> 01:28:31,394\n>> Oh, it is volts?\nAll right.\n\n1811\n01:28:31,394 --> 01:28:32,544\nSo, 110.\nCuz, I don't want 220.\n\n1812\n01:28:32,544 --> 01:28:35,144\nIn Europe, you get 220 all over the place,\nbut not in the US.\n\n1813\n01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:38,130\nSo most use 110 volt power and\n\n1814\n01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:42,880\nmust support sleep mode for\npower conservation.\n\n1815\n01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,240\nI don't want this thing eating up power\nall the time if nobody's using it.\n\n1816\n01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,518\nSo I wanna make sure that\nit actually gets handled.\n\n1817\n01:28:49,518 --> 01:28:50,690\nAll right.\n\n1818\n01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:53,700\nConflict resolution.\n\n1819\n01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:57,990\nIf a conflict should arise,\nif two people butt heads or whatever.\n\n1820\n01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,580\nIf Nate and\n\n1821\n01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:03,430\nI are butting heads over the design,\nhe's the originator, I'm the sponsor.\n\n1822\n01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:04,950\nI'm also the project manager.\n\n1823\n01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:07,020\nWe need to put the resolution.\n\n1824\n01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:10,412\nNormally, I just put a one\nsentence thing here.\n\n1825\n01:29:10,412 --> 01:29:12,368\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I put,\n\n1826\n01:29:12,368 --> 01:29:18,140\ndecisions will be made democratically.\n\n1827\n01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,560\nWhich means we'll take a vote.\n\n1828\n01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,790\nMajority wins.\n\n1829\n01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:22,290\nOkay.\n\n1830\n01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:31,770\nAnd then I put,\nties will be determined by the PM,\n\n1831\n01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:34,140\nthe Project Manager will\nmake that decision.\n\n1832\n01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:37,490\nNow your's might be different,\nyou might say the sponsor,\n\n1833\n01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:40,520\nthe person who's true authority\nmakes the decision, right?\n\n1834\n01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:44,610\nAnd I've had that, where I was the PM for\na project and there was a tie.\n\n1835\n01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:48,790\nAnd I was leading towards one side,\nbut our CIO, he was the sponsor.\n\n1836\n01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:50,340\nHe was leading towards the other side.\n\n1837\n01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:51,340\nThat's the way we went.\n\n1838\n01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:53,140\nHe had that authority.\n\n1839\n01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:55,370\nAs a PM we don't take this personally.\n\n1840\n01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:56,970\nIt's the decision of the company.\n\n1841\n01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:58,950\nSo you have to do what's right.\n\n1842\n01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:01,750\nI'm gonna put in here ties to\nbe determined by the PM, but\n\n1843\n01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:06,160\nagain determined entirely by your company,\nright.\n\n1844\n01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:09,580\nAnd then lastly, we've got\nthe project manager, which is me.\n\n1845\n01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:17,900\nAnd the sponsor or, there's typos\nin this thing, or originator,\n\n1846\n01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:23,710\nand so in this case the originator\nis going to be Nathan Copeland.\n\n1847\n01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:28,010\nAnd so now we've got it in\nhere where we can come in and\n\n1848\n01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:32,280\nwe can fill in our names,\ndates, and all that good stuff.\n\n1849\n01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,890\nGet this thing filled out.\n\n1850\n01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:38,510\nThis form is worthless in it's current\nform because it has no signatures, right?\n\n1851\n01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:42,970\nIt's the signatures that are really\ngonna give this thing power.\n\n1852\n01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:50,180\nSo we need to print this out, get it\nsigned and now we've got a full charter.\n\n1853\n01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:50,800\nAll right.\n\n1854\n01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,560\nNow that took a lot longer to\nfill out because I was talking\n\n1855\n01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:56,050\nabout every entry as we went, but\n\n1856\n01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,010\na project charter should really take\nyou about ten minutes to fill out.\n\n1857\n01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:01,670\nIt's not a big deal,\nit's just high level stuff.\n\n1858\n01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:05,600\nThe key thing is this block right\ndown here, because what it is,\n\n1859\n01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,080\nis the sponsor giving authority to\nthe project manager to get to work.\n\n1860\n01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,540\nAs a project manager,\nif you're a project manager right now\n\n1861\n01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:18,680\nyou should never start a project\nwithout a signed charter in hand.\n\n1862\n01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:21,810\nWithout that signed charter you don't\nhave permission to spend money.\n\n1863\n01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,500\nYou don't have permission\nto run that project.\n\n1864\n01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,010\nYou've got to get this done.\n\n1865\n01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:25,730\nIt's very, very important.\n\n1866\n01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:32,671\nAll right, so\nwhen we're all done we'll save that and\n\n1867\n01:31:32,671 --> 01:31:38,270\nlet me just do a Save As here and\nwe'll create a new folder here.\n\n1868\n01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:44,530\nThis is gonna be our arcade cabinet build,\nor maybe we'll just call it a project.\n\n1869\n01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:46,000\n>> Yeah.\n\n1870\n01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,220\n>> There we go.\n\n1871\n01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:51,260\nAnd I like to name my files with\nthe phase at the beginning.\n\n1872\n01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,825\nSo I'm gonna call this\ninitiation-project charter,\n\n1873\n01:31:53,825 --> 01:31:56,630\ncuz I might develop several\ndifferent documents.\n\n1874\n01:31:56,630 --> 01:31:59,590\nAnd another thing I like to do,\nyou can do this in the file name or\n\n1875\n01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,380\nyou can do it elsewhere.\n\n1876\n01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:03,550\nI like to do it in the file name and\njust put version 1.0.\n\n1877\n01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:05,970\nThis is version one of this document.\n\n1878\n01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:09,220\nI'll probably only have one version of\nthis document because we're allowed to\n\n1879\n01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:13,950\nchange, but when we get into the planning\nphase, we're gonna have multiple\n\n1880\n01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:17,242\nversions of documents as we\nrevise them and change them.\n\n1881\n01:32:17,242 --> 01:32:19,280\nStuff happens, things have to change and\n\n1882\n01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,670\nhaving a version number that\nyou track is important.\n\n1883\n01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:25,720\nA lot of software, even in Word,\nif I go to file and properties,\n\n1884\n01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:30,630\nI'll see where I got all these things that\nI can put inside of the document as far\n\n1885\n01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:35,610\nas doing tracking for,\nif there had been changes or whatever.\n\n1886\n01:32:35,610 --> 01:32:37,200\nSo it can track version numbers here.\n\n1887\n01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:41,160\nSo this is revision number two,\nright now I must have saved it before.\n\n1888\n01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,890\nSo it can track it here, but that's hard\nfor people to see, they don't know it.\n\n1889\n01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:47,540\nSo that's why I like to stick\nit right in the file name.\n\n1890\n01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:50,530\nSo somebody comes to me with a document\nversion 1.0 and I'm like man,\n\n1891\n01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:52,360\nwe're on version 2.5 by now.\n\n1892\n01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,390\nYou need the latest version.\n\n1893\n01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:58,160\nEasy to tell if people\nhave the right document.\n\n1894\n01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,480\nAll right, so that is the project charter.\n\n1895\n01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,590\nI need to print this out now, and I need\nto sign it, and Nate needs to sign it,\n\n1896\n01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:07,070\nand now we're ready to\nrock on this project.\n\n1897\n01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:11,510\nAll right, so\nthat's basically a project charter,\n\n1898\n01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:14,820\nnow our initiation phase isn't done,\nwe still have more to do.\n\n1899\n01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:18,090\nWe need to deal with our stakeholders,\nwhich we have a very small list here, so\n\n1900\n01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:19,910\nwhat we'll need to get\nsome more going in there.\n\n1901\n01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:22,460\nBut, for right now I think\nthat's a pretty good start.\n\n1902\n01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,960\nRonnie can you think of\nanything that we left out?\n\n1903\n01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:24,480\n>> I don't think so.\n\n1904\n01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,660\nI think the examples are good example for\nus.\n\n1905\n01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:29,170\nIt gives us the ability to\nactually start thinking that way.\n\n1906\n01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:32,880\nAnd so we're ready to actually\nidentify our stakeholders next once\n\n1907\n01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,080\nwe continue to move on.\n\n1908\n01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,840\n>> Sweet.\n\n1909\n01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,760\nWell, let's go ahead and\nwrap up here for this episode.\n\n1910\n01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,870\nAnd we'll do stakeholders\nin our next episode.\n\n1911\n01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:44,340\nSo let me just remind everybody if\nyou have questions on any of this,\n\n1912\n01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:48,530\nlive during this show you can go

and\n\n4\n00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:33,035\ngood evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:37,520\nwelcome back.\n\n6\n00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,970\nTo another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,160\nI'm your host Don Pizzett once again with\nMr. Ronnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,785\n>> It is going well and I am excited and\nready for my future in the Warp Tour.\n\n9\n00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:51,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> Ronnie is taking his daughter to\n\n10\n00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,975\nthe Warp Tour soon and we have made\nendless It's fun of them about this.\n\n11\n00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:59,350\n[LAUGH] Ronnie who is your favorite band?\n\n12\n00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,290\n>> It's whatever one that I\ncan get a t-shirt with and\n\n13\n00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,670\nso I don't know [LAUGH] we'll\ncall it Campbell soup cup.\n\n14\n00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,630\n>> You strike me as a Fallout boy person.\n\n15\n00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,970\n>> I think I may be fallout\nboy definitely that or\n\n16\n00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,650\nColdplay one of the two wonderful\n>> [LAUGH] I don't know which is worse.\n\n17\n00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,280\n>> Me neither.\n\n18\n00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,220\n>> All right well ladies and\n\n19\n00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,250\ngentlemen in the last episode we were\nworking through project initiation.\n\n20\n00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,710\nWe were taking about getting\na project started and\n\n21\n00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,390\nwe took a look at the project\ncharter process and\n\n22\n00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,380\nactually creating that project charter\nwhich is our kickoff document, all right?\n\n23\n00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,740\nWell, in normal project management form,\nI printed it out,\n\n24\n00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,210\nI took it over, I signed it as the PM.\n\n25\n00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,730\n>> Yup.\n\n26\n00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,540\n>> Nate signed it as the originator,\nso we've got a, wait, where is that?\n\n27\n00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,450\nHang on,\nI've got that sitting around somewhere.\n\n28\n00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,490\nLet me pull it up here.\n\n29\n00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,070\nWe're gonna go official here, so\nlet me see, where did I park that?\n\n30\n00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,390\nThat would be in our arcade cabinet\nproject that we started right, so So\n\n31\n00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,240\nhere's my PDF.\n\n32\n00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,840\nSo here's the project charter that\nwe drafted in the last episode.\n\n33\n00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,190\nWe fired it up, we got it set,\nand we've got it signed.\n\n34\n00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,170\nHere's something that I learned\nlong ago in a previous life,\n\n35\n00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,970\nI worked at a law office,\nyou always sign things in a blue pen, so\n\n36\n00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,940\nyou can tell if you've got the original or\nnot.\n\n37\n00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,850\nIf you have it black or\nwhite it might be a photo copy.\n\n38\n00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,830\nBut, we're signed,\nour project is kicked off.\n\n39\n00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,270\nWe're ready to rock.\n\n40\n00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,050\nAnd now we're ready to move to the next\npart of the initiating process.\n\n41\n00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,520\nSo develop a charter?\n\n42\n00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,750\nDone.\nWe are chartered.\n\n43\n00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,830\nWe are ready to rock.\n\n44\n00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,750\nAll right?\n\n45\n00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,490\nNow we're ready to step forward to\nthe only other process group we\n\n46\n00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,740\nhave in the initiation phase which\nis identify the stakeholders.\n\n47\n00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,400\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n48\n00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,600\nwhen we go to identify the stakeholders,\nwe're trying to come up with that list of\n\n49\n00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,470\nall the people, not necessarily\nthat are apart of the project, but\n\n50\n00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,690\nthat are effected by the project.\n\n51\n00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,840\nThe people we need to communicate with.\n\n52\n00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,510\n>> A lot of times times when we\nstart talking about the idea of\n\n53\n00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,840\nstakeholders, right.\n\n54\n00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,960\nWhen you take a look at it just from a\npeer paper point of you, you may actually\n\n55\n00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,060\nsay, hey, these are people that have some\nauthority or power in the actual project.\n\n56\n00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,210\nOr at least have some vested\ninterest in the project,\n\n57\n00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,630\nwhether it's gonna effect them directly or\nwhether or\n\n58\n00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,410\nnot they're gonna actually have to do\nsomething or perform something here.\n\n59\n00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,490\nSo a lot of times just by\nlooking at it in that way,\n\n60\n00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,540\nif you wonder who the stakeholders are\nthey're the ones that either are making\n\n61\n00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,720\ndecisions a lot of times or the decision's\ngonna directly affect them and\n\n62\n00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,520\nthat's why they're taking interest\nin our particular project.\n\n63\n00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,230\n>> Yup.\n\n64\n00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,070\nAll right, well let's take\na look at the process itself.\n\n65\n00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,515\nI've got it around here somewhere here.\n\n66\n00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:26,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Identify stakeholders, so\n\n67\n00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,800\nhere's the identify stakeholders process\nand it's a pretty straightforward one.\n\n68\n00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,800\nWe've got a bunch of inputs, all right,\nwhich we kind of expect at this point.\n\n69\n00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,630\nAnd we have just a handful of tools and\ntechniques.\n\n70\n00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,860\nBut the end result is that we're gonna\ncreate what's called a stakeholder\n\n71\n00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,880\nregister.\n\n72\n00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,460\nAnd the stakeholder\nregister is simply a list.\n\n73\n00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,180\nA list of our stakeholders and\n\n74\n00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,050\nsome basic information about them that\nwe need to be aware of, all right?\n\n75\n00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,660\nSo let's start with these inputs.\n\n76\n00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,220\nNotice the very first input is\nthe project charter, all right?\n\n77\n00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,070\nWe just created that, and\nin the project charter,\n\n78\n00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,960\nif you watch the last episode, we had\na field in there called stakeholders.\n\n79\n00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,410\nAnd what we did is we\ntook our first ballpark\n\n80\n00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,240\nDart in the dark type approach to figure\nout who we thought our stakeholders were.\n\n81\n00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,320\nSo, we've already got a couple of people\n\n82\n00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,380\nthat are ready to go into\nour stakeholder register,\n\n83\n00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,500\npeople that we just guessed during\nthe beginning of the phase, all right.\n\n84\n00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,770\nSo, that's gonna serve as an input,\n\n85\n00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,440\nthe project charter is\nan input into this process.\n\n86\n00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,720\nThen we've got procurement documents.\n\n87\n00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,770\nNow what are procurement documents?\n\n88\n00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,500\nIn your mind, with PMI language, right,\n\n89\n00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,690\nany time you see procurement you need to\nchange that in your head to contract.\n\n90\n00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,850\nThese are anybody that\nwe have a contract with.\n\n91\n00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,330\nIf we have a contract with a company for\ndoing some of the work or providing\n\n92\n00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,910\nthe services anyone listed on that\ncontract is a stakeholder in the project.\n\n93\n00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,590\nThey're either the purchaser, usually us\nand so we want the goods to be delivered.\n\n94\n00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,120\nOr they're the provider, they're\nthe ones that are providing the service.\n\n95\n00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,580\nSo they need to deliver so\nthey get paid, right.\n\n96\n00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,670\nSo anybody named in that contract\nis going to be a stakeholder.\n\n97\n00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,740\nSo, you may not have any contracts,\nbut if you do, page through them.\n\n98\n00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,440\nLook for anyone named in them.\n\n99\n00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,649\nAny, anyone who is, they're going\nto be stakeholders, all right.\n\n100\n00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,490\nAnd then we have our two,\nalmost given ones, right.\n\n101\n00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,570\nEnterprise environmental factors and\norganizational process assets.\n\n102\n00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,310\nIn your enterprise environmental factors,\nif you are,\n\n103\n00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,220\nlet's say you're a chemical plant and\nyou're regulated by the EPA, right.\n\n104\n00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,920\nSo in the United States we have the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency and so for\n\n105\n00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,750\nany project you undertake, the EPA,\nmight need to be a stake holder.\n\n106\n00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,410\nSomebody who's notified as\na part of your project.\n\n107\n00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,750\nAnd so you'll know that based on your\nenterprise environmental factors.\n\n108\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,862\nIf you're a publicly traded company,\nyour share holders might be stake holders.\n\n109\n00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:51,510\nThey wanna know how your spending the\nmoney that is supposed to be earning them\n\n110\n00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,130\nprofits, all right.\n\n111\n00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,420\nAnd then organization process assets,\nwhat we're really going for\n\n112\n00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,770\nthere is typically a template, right.\n\n113\n00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,680\nWe probably have a template for\n\n114\n00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,860\nthis Stakeholder Register that we can use\nto figure out how we wanna format this,\n\n115\n00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,071\nand how we wanna provide it inside\nof the document, all right.\n\n116\n00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,050\nSo these are the inputs that are gonna\nfeed in to this particular process.\n\n117\n00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,940\nAnd all we need to do now,\nis take all that information, and\n\n118\n00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,300\nscrape the names out of it, and\nput that into our stakeholder register.\n\n119\n00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,970\nWell, we've got a couple of tools\nthat help with that, and so\n\n120\n00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,100\nlet's take a look at each one of these,\nall right?\n\n121\n00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,940\nSo look at these we've\nalready talked about.\n\n122\n00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,650\nExpert judgment, All right.\n\n123\n00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,220\nYou may just know because you've\nbeen with the company a while.\n\n124\n00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,750\nYou've got it in your head and you say\nhey I know that x y z people are gonna\n\n125\n00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,310\nbe involved in this project so I should\njust add them to the list, all right.\n\n126\n00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,260\nOr, you might do meetings.\n\n127\n00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,180\nMeetings, you bring people together and\nyou say, all right,\n\n128\n00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,800\ncan you guys think of any stakeholders?\n\n129\n00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,400\nNow in a high-budget project,\nin a big money project,\n\n130\n00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,810\nit's real important you\nidentify all the stakeholders.\n\n131\n00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,870\nAnd so you may,\nthey have a series of meetings, right, and\n\n132\n00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,250\nthey call it branching out.\n\n133\n00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,240\nYou start with your core stakeholders,\nthe people you already identified.\n\n134\n00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,660\nYou bring them into a meeting,\nyou say, okay,\n\n135\n00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,620\ncan you guys think of anyone else who\nshould be a stakeholder, all right.\n\n136\n00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,690\nAnd then they either come up\nwith people right then or\n\n137\n00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,420\nthey say, let me reach out to some people.\n\n138\n00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,780\nSo, that's their action item, right.\n\n139\n00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,240\nMeetings should always\nend with action items.\n\n140\n00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,330\nThey have an action item to go out and\nidentify any other stakeholders.\n\n141\n00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,750\nSo they identify them and\n\n142\n00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,780\nthen you have another meeting\nwith all of those stakeholders.\n\n143\n00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,750\nYou say, okay, can you guys think of\nanybody else that needs to be notified?\n\n144\n00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,710\nAnd you continue to do this, branching out\nand out, as your stakeholder list grows.\n\n145\n00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,450\nUntil you get to a point where nobody\ncan think of any more Stakeholders,\n\n146\n00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,720\nnow you've got all the people\nthat are involved, all right.\n\n147\n00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,950\nSo meetings and expert judgement,\npretty important.\n\n148\n00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,780\n>> Yep.\n\n149\n00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,376\nNow the goal behind the idea of\ngetting all these stakeholders, right.\n\n150\n00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:51,980\nIs not just the idea of going,\nI know that Don's gonna be in the project,\n\n151\n00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,241\nI know that Nate's gonna be in\nthe project, but it is to again,\n\n152\n00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,016\nmake them essentially on your team,\nall right.\n\n153\n00:07:56,016 --> 00:08:00,276\nSo for us here, getting them together and\nlearning some information about them.\n\n154\n00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:04,080\nAnd trying to judge where they're gonna\nactually be of value to your particular\n\n155\n00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,030\nproject.\n\n156\n00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,355\nAnd then putting them in something that\nyou can actually use to identify that,\n\n157\n00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,155\nfairly easily, is what we're really\ntrying to do at this peak of point.\n\n158\n00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:16,645\nSo just remember that, it's not just about\ngetting them together, it's about again,\n\n159\n00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:20,465\nlearning about them so that they actually\nbecome part of just what you want and be,\n\n160\n00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:21,759\nwhich is a support of your project.\n\n161\n00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,080\n>> So once we've got these\npeople kind of listed,\n\n162\n00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,390\nwhat we're going to be doing is\ncreating a stakeholder register,\n\n163\n00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,230\nand the stakeholder register\nitself is really just a chart.\n\n164\n00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:37,060\nA chart that lists people and\nlists the information we have on them.\n\n165\n00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,140\nSo the PMI has a basic\nkind of recommendation for\n\n166\n00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,540\nthe elements that should be in\nthat stakeholder register, and\n\n167\n00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,840\nI've got a little template\nthat I normally use.\n\n168\n00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,762\nAnd so let me find my template,\nand here we go.\n\n169\n00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,290\nAll right, so this is a template\nof a stakeholder register, and\n\n170\n00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,810\nlet me just zoom in little bit.\n\n171\n00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,320\nLet's see.\n\n172\n00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,510\nThere we go.\n\n173\n00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,080\nAnd so like every project document I\nalways include a couple of elements on\n\n174\n00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,270\nevery project document that I work with.\n\n175\n00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,670\nThe project title and the project manager.\n\n176\n00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,280\nAnd that way if we lose this document,\nif we leave it laying around,\n\n177\n00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,100\npeople know what project it's tied to and\nwho it was that is responsible.\n\n178\n00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,590\nSo I'd fill that information in.\n\n179\n00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,480\nWho the project manager is and that title.\n\n180\n00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,050\nAll right then, this is just an example.\n\n181\n00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,420\nYou guys can creat whatever you want.\n\n182\n00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,640\nThis is a sample of what\na stakeholder register looks like.\n\n183\n00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,790\nIt's basically a list of names.\n\n184\n00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,130\nThese are all the people that\nmight be involved in your project.\n\n185\n00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,200\nAnd then additional\ninformation about them.\n\n186\n00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,390\nPosition, right?\n\n187\n00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,740\nWhat's their title in the company?\n\n188\n00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,070\nWhat job do they have?\n\n189\n00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,900\nWhat role do they have in the project?\n\n190\n00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,490\nOkay, that may be\ndifferent than their job.\n\n191\n00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,290\nThey've got their job within the company,\nthat's their functional job, and\n\n192\n00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,150\nthen they've got their project role.\n\n193\n00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,920\nSo inside the project they've got\ndifferent kinda roles they can fill.\n\n194\n00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,070\nThen our contact information.\n\n195\n00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,060\nHow do we get a hold of this person?\n\n196\n00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,070\nA cool part about this is that we can\nuse it to determine the means that we\n\n197\n00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,190\nwant to communicate.\n\n198\n00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,310\nWe might have our CIO, our chief\ninformation officer, and they want to\n\n199\n00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,320\nbe a part of this project, but they don't\nwant to be a part of the project, right?\n\n200\n00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,430\nThey don't want to go to the meetings and\nstuff like that,\n\n201\n00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,310\nso they just want us to\nemail them status updates.\n\n202\n00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,280\nWe don't actually want to to call\nthem on the phone bring them into\n\n203\n00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,880\nmeetings or whatever.\n\n204\n00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,090\nJust wanted to know a little bit.\n\n205\n00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,570\nSo we can start to put some\nof that information in here.\n\n206\n00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,950\nNow, we're gonna have a communications\nplan later that we'll see.\n\n207\n00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,990\nAnd that'll dial into\nthis even more in depth.\n\n208\n00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,290\nSo this is still just kind\nof our basic information.\n\n209\n00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,820\nAnd remember,\nwe're in the initiation phase.\n\n210\n00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,895\nSo, all of this can change\nif need be later on.\n\n211\n00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:41,520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n212\n00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,980\n>> All right, some of the other things.\n\n213\n00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,270\nRequirements.\n\n214\n00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,120\nAnd this isn't requirements for\nthe project necessarily.\n\n215\n00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,300\nIt could just be their\nrequirements of the project.\n\n216\n00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,980\nWhat do they need?\n\n217\n00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,300\nSo when we start to build a project\nwe have a requirements list, and\n\n218\n00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,040\nthere's different people that\nare setting those requirements.\n\n219\n00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,540\nAnd so we want to tie those, they call it,\nthere's another document we'll see later\n\n220\n00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,660\ncalled an Accountability Matrix, and\nthat saying when we have a requirement.\n\n221\n00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,390\nWho's fault is it?\n\n222\n00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,210\nWho is it that imposed\nthat requirement on us?\n\n223\n00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,520\nAnd if we ever have to do a change ticket,\nwe have to find out who's effected and\n\n224\n00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,110\ngo to them.\n\n225\n00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,180\nAnd so that's why it's important\nto keep track of that.\n\n226\n00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,340\nWhat's the expectations?\n\n227\n00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,180\nWhat do they expect of the project?\n\n228\n00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,620\nNow notice,\nthat sounds a lot like requirements.\n\n229\n00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,660\nRight?\nWhat do they require and\n\n230\n00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,610\nwhat do they expect?\n\n231\n00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,380\nWell the difference here is\na requirement we have to meet.\n\n232\n00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,010\nRight?\n\n233\n00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,330\nAnd expectation, we'd like to meet,\nbut we don't have to.\n\n234\n00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,730\nAnd it's possible that some of these\nexpectations could be out of line.\n\n235\n00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,330\nThat they're expecting something\nthat's unrealistic, and\n\n236\n00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,850\nthis is where we kind of\nstart to identify that.\n\n237\n00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,760\nAll right?\n\n238\n00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,660\nNext is their influence.\n\n239\n00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,890\nNow, this is a really weird one.\n\n240\n00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,590\nBecause this is how much\npower do they have.\n\n241\n00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,650\nIn other words, if something's going along\nin the project, can they step in and\n\n242\n00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,190\nchange things?\n\n243\n00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,890\nCan they force change if they want?\n\n244\n00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,220\nSo, you usually just do something\nsimple like high, medium, low.\n\n245\n00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,800\nBut you could even be very specific and\n\n246\n00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,340\nspecify exactly what\nthey have control over.\n\n247\n00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,990\nMaybe this person doesn't have\na control over our project but\n\n248\n00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,970\nit has control over human resources and\nthey can starve our project, right.\n\n249\n00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,170\nBy cutting away employees.\n\n250\n00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,060\nAnd then lastly classification.\n\n251\n00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,830\nIf we classify these people as key\nstakeholders, people that we need to\n\n252\n00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:25,050\nnotify for everything, or if they're just\nsecondary or tangential stakeholders,\n\n253\n00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,190\npeople that we just need to be aware\nof but not actually communicate with.\n\n254\n00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,920\nWe can rank those right there.\n\n255\n00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,520\nAnd it's up to you to create\na classification system that meets your\n\n256\n00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,050\ncompany's needs.\n\n257\n00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,680\nAll right?\n\n258\n00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,520\nSo, this is the document\nwe're trying to produce.\n\n259\n00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,380\nWhere do we get all of that information?\n\n260\n00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,750\nWell, if I go back to that process here,\nthat's where our tools and techniques.\n\n261\n00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,920\nWe use our expert judgment, and we use\nmeetings to gather this data together and\n\n262\n00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,660\ncreate that stakeholder registry.\n\n263\n00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,560\nAll right now, when we create\nthe stakeholder registry it is just that\n\n264\n00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,170\nmatter of finding out\nwho's gonna be involved.\n\n265\n00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,510\nSo, lets take our arcade cabinet project\nand go a little bit further with it.\n\n266\n00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,040\nSo, we'll start to draft our\nproject charter all right.\n\n267\n00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,840\nSo, im gonna start.\n\n268\n00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,030\nThis is my template.\n\n269\n00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,929\nSo, I'm gonna start by\nsaving it as something else.\n\n270\n00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,870\nAnd we'll get into our\narcade cabinet project.\n\n271\n00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,020\nAnd I'll call this the Stake Holder\nRegister, which actually I'll prefix that\n\n272\n00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,502\nwith Initiation Stake Holder\nRegister Version 1.0.\n\n273\n00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:31,220\nI'll probably never come back and\nrevise this one.\n\n274\n00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,570\nInitiation documents I\nrarely come back and revise.\n\n275\n00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,320\nPlanning ones we do,\n\n276\n00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,360\nbut I'll still stick a version number\non the end just so I've got it.\n\n277\n00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,090\nAll right, okay so\nProject Title this was the IT, whoops,\n\n278\n00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:51,090\nITProTV Arcade Cabinet project or build-\n>> What\n\n279\n00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,460\n>> Did we call it,\n\n280\n00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,490\nI think we called it Project 9.\n\n281\n00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,920\nAlright, there we go.\n\n282\n00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,720\nAnd then the project manager, that's me.\n\n283\n00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:05,714\nAnd the date this document was\nprepared is today, which is 5-20-2014.\n\n284\n00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:06,394\nAll right?\n\n285\n00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:08,810\nAnd then we start to\nlist our stakeholders.\n\n286\n00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,346\nNow I can go to our project charter, which\nI thought I had right here, but I don't.\n\n287\n00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:15,144\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me go back to that PDF.\n\n288\n00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:23,230\nAnd so we'll go back in here,\nand here's the project charter.\n\n289\n00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,680\nAnd remember I mentioned that a lot of\nstuff in the project charter, and in these\n\n290\n00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,060\ndocuments when we use them as inputs,\nthey're really just copy and paste jobs.\n\n291\n00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,610\nWell that's kind of what I'm doing here\nis I'm going through and I'm finding that\n\n292\n00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,520\nstakeholder list, and basically bringing\nthat over as a copy and paste, right?\n\n293\n00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,080\nThese are our stakeholders\nthat we already came up with.\n\n294\n00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,730\nSo I'm gonna take that and let me just\nget back over to my Word document and\n\n295\n00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,490\nwe'll go through and kind of list these.\n\n296\n00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,380\nSo I'm gonna say, Don,\nnice that it's in bold.\n\n297\n00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,160\nDon Pezet.\n\n298\n00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,250\nAnd we've got Nathan Copeland,\n\n299\n00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,095\nwe've got Ronnie Wong, Rob Magary.\n\n300\n00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:08,010\nAnd then as we start to\n\n301\n00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,260\nthink about some of the different\nother people that might fall in here.\n\n302\n00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,950\nWell, we need to run through\n\n303\n00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,690\nour list of contracts and\nthings like that that might be out there.\n\n304\n00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,350\nWhat it is that might pertain\nof this particular project.\n\n305\n00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,300\nRight?\nWho else might be a sponsor?\n\n306\n00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,550\nSo if I had shareholders well,\nwe're a private company so\n\n307\n00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,110\nwe don't have any shareholders.\n\n308\n00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,180\nIf there were other people in the company\nthat I needed to answer to right?\n\n309\n00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,900\nSo if I wanted to go to our president,\n\n310\n00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,812\nI probably don't want to let\nhim know what I'm going here.\n\n311\n00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:44,070\n[LAUGH] He'll go,\nyou're building an arcade cabinet?\n\n312\n00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,886\nI don't understand.\n\n313\n00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:48,080\nSo it's sometimes easier to ask\nforgiveness than permission.\n\n314\n00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,059\n[LAUGH] But [LAUGH]\n>> That's not in the PMI.\n\n315\n00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,180\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> We gonna avoid the appearance of\n\n316\n00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,972\nimpropriety.\n\n317\n00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:59,537\nI think I just appear to do that.\n\n318\n00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:00,360\nAnyhow.\n\n319\n00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,095\nBut, we started to think of other\npeople that might need to be

think he can\nhear me from way over there.\n\n339\n00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,230\nAll right, and the IT Pro Viewers\ntheir position is awesome.\n\n340\n00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,410\nAll right, so\nthat's [LAUGH] your main position.\n\n341\n00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,450\n>> That's right.\n\n342\n00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,650\n>> All right, so then what's\nour role in the project, right?\n\n343\n00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,710\nSo, my role is PM and Sponsor.\n\n344\n00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,170\nI've got two roles in this project,\nand that's not uncommon.\n\n345\n00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,790\nNathan, his role is originator.\n\n346\n00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,360\nHe's the originator,\nthe person who started this whole idea.\n\n347\n00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,260\nRonnie, you are the, what did we say?\n\n348\n00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,970\n>> The Assistant PM.\n\n349\n00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,970\n>> Assistant PM.\n\n350\n00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,100\nNow, Rob is a Web Designer.\n\n351\n00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,905\nHe's a very good Web Designer or\nat least he says so.\n\n352\n00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:44,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n353\n00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,850\nwe don't need him as a web\ndesigner on this project.\n\n354\n00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,500\nWhat we need it,\na long time ago Rob was a carpenter, and\n\n355\n00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,390\nwe need his wood building skills.\n\n356\n00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,130\nAnd so,\nI'm gonna put him in here as a carpenter.\n\n357\n00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,190\nAnd SME, subject matter expert.\n\n358\n00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,250\nHe's gonna be somebody that\nwe reach out to for help,\n\n359\n00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,390\nwith actual construction and build.\n\n360\n00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,810\nAnd then the ITProTV viewers, you guys,\n\n361\n00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,740\nwell your role is going to be\nproviding suggestions and input.\n\n362\n00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,240\nSo, I'll just put that in here.\n\n363\n00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,680\nSuggestions and input, that's what\nyou guys are gonna be giving us.\n\n364\n00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,070\nAll right?\n\n365\n00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,370\nThen our contact information,\nhow do we reach out to these people?\n\n366\n00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,425\nRight, this is where we could put phone\nnumbers, so we might put my email address.\n\n367\n00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:30,820\nDon@ITPro.TV or my desk phone.\n\n368\n00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,265\nSo, we'll put that in here if I can type.\n\n369\n00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:39,845\nThat column should be a little bit wider,\nshouldn't it?\n\n370\n00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:43,175\nSo, we can start to put this\ninformation in here, so\n\n371\n00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,735\nthat we know how we can\nreach out to these people.\n\n372\n00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:46,535\nSo, we can go down and\n\n373\n00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:50,825\nstart listing everybody's contact\ninformation, getting that all filled out.\n\n374\n00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,738\nAnd now we've got their data.\n\n375\n00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:56,300\nAll right, then what are the requirements?\n\n376\n00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,450\nAll right, what requirements\ndo they have of the project?\n\n377\n00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,400\nSome people aren't gonna\nhave requirements.\n\n378\n00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,120\nSo like the ITProTV viewers, you guys,\nit's not, you don't have a vested\n\n379\n00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,530\ninterest in this arcade cabinet,\nyou can't reach out and touch it.\n\n380\n00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,980\nSo, your requirement is that you\nlearn how to structure a project,\n\n381\n00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,790\nor how to manage a project, right?\n\n382\n00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,820\nSo, I'm gonna change that.\n\n383\n00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,370\nSo, all you're concerned about is,\nyou don't care that we built a cabinet.\n\n384\n00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,720\nWhat you care about is that we follow\nformal project management practices,\n\n385\n00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,210\nall the way through\nthe construction of this cabinet.\n\n386\n00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,410\nAll right?\nSo that's your requirement of what we do.\n\n387\n00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,610\nIf we look at my requirement, remember my\nonly requirement before because I don't\n\n388\n00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,710\nknow much about these things,\nwas keep the budget\n\n389\n00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,120\nunder $2,000.\n\n390\n00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,070\nI said that if we got over that,\nI can't deal with that, so\n\n391\n00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,400\nit's not gonna happen, all right?\n\n392\n00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,170\nAnd then we've got Nate, his requirements,\n\n393\n00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,290\nwell, Nate had several requirements,\nright?\n\n394\n00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,610\nHe wanted it to be four player,\n\n395\n00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,700\nhe wanted, all these different\nrequirements that he had.\n\n396\n00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,097\nSo for his requirements,\nI'm just gonna put design specifications.\n\n397\n00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:09,869\nHe's gonna be the one who basically comes\nup with the specifications that we're\n\n398\n00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:14,218\ngonna be following, and we'll need to\nnail those down to the letter, but\n\n399\n00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:17,191\nwe'll do that in the planning phase,\nall right?\n\n400\n00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:18,537\nThen we've got Ronnie?\n\n401\n00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:19,413\n>> Yeah.\n>> Ronnie what are you\n\n402\n00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:20,291\nrequirements of the project?\n\n403\n00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,393\n>> My requirements are simple,\nI answer to Don.\n\n404\n00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:23,600\n>> [LAUGH] So.\n\n405\n00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,050\n>> So do boy, change our role.\n\n406\n00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,717\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, Ronnie is a great example of\n\n407\n00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:33,945\nsomeone who might not have any\nrequirements, Ronnie doesn't have a vested\n\n408\n00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:39,600\ninterest in the project in terms of his\ncreating something he wants or needs.\n\n409\n00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,950\nHe has a vested interest in the project,\n\n410\n00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,940\nbecause we're paying him to\nbe a part of the project.\n\n411\n00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,480\n>> Right.\n\n412\n00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,251\n>> So, for his requirements, none, right?\n\n413\n00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:50,360\nAnd, same thing goes for Rob.\n\n414\n00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,340\nRob hasn't told us any particular\nthings that he would want out of this.\n\n415\n00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,760\nHe doesn't necessarily care,\nso we'll just put none.\n\n416\n00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,800\nNo requirements.\n\n417\n00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,890\nAll right, well for them under\nexpectation, it's kind of the same thing.\n\n418\n00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,010\nIf you have no requirements,\nyou can't really have any expectations.\n\n419\n00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,280\nSo, that's gonna be that, right?\n\n420\n00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,482\nMy expectation is,\nI wanna keep the budget under 2,000, but\n\n421\n00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:15,150\nmy expectation is that we'll\ncome in under 1,000 right?\n\n422\n00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:23,400\nSo- Budget falling under 1,000 right?\n\n423\n00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,210\nSo, I have my requirement, what I require.\n\n424\n00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,940\nBut then, my expectation is that we'd\nbe a little bit lower, all right?\n\n425\n00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,350\nNathan on the other hand.\n\n426\n00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,800\nRight?\nNate his requirements his expectation is,\n\n427\n00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,330\nyeah, I'm just gonna put awesome.\n\n428\n00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,245\nRight?\nSo, he wants this thing to be awesome\n\n429\n00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:42,945\nand phenomenal.\n\n430\n00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:46,275\nNow that is a totally subjective term.\n\n431\n00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,805\nHow am I supposed to act upon that?\n\n432\n00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:49,025\nI really can't.\n\n433\n00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:52,135\nSo, in the planning phase I need to say,\nall right?\n\n434\n00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:54,275\nWe're gonna have to nail\nthis down with Nate.\n\n435\n00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,930\nWe're gonna have to have some meetings.\n\n436\n00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,000\nRight?\nSo, we'll have to bring Nate on the show.\n\n437\n00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,630\nAnd so we'll hammer through and\n\n438\n00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,720\nkind of come up with our specifications,\nand figure out exactly what we want.\n\n439\n00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,380\nAll right?\n\n440\n00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,110\nAnd then lastly the ITProTV viewers,\nwhat your expectation is.\n\n441\n00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,980\nWell, they're pretty much\nthe same as the requirements.\n\n442\n00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,509\nSo, I'm not gonna list any\nspecial expectation then.\n\n443\n00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,950\nAll right, now influence,\nlet's hold off on influence here for\n\n444\n00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,390\na minute cuz that's kind of a special\none we're gonna talk about in a minute.\n\n445\n00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,180\nBut, it's really hard to just\ngage influence by itself,\n\n446\n00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,600\nwe'll see why after the break, but\nfor right now let's hold off on that.\n\n447\n00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,380\nThen the last one is just classification,\nall right?\n\n448\n00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,350\nYour organization may or\nmay not classify employees, all right?\n\n449\n00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,440\nIn a project, it's important that\nyou apply classification just so\n\n450\n00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,170\nyou can understand if somebody is a Key\nStay Colder, or if they're tangential,\n\n451\n00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,080\nsecondary, whatever?\n\n452\n00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,660\nSo what I like to do is specify primary or\nsecondary, but\n\n453\n00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,190\nthat terminology's completely up\nto you can pick whatever you want.\n\n454\n00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:01,670\nSo me, I'm gonna be a primary and\nso is Nathan, so is Ronnie right?\n\n455\n00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,040\nBecause, the three of us\nare part of the project team.\n\n456\n00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,220\nBut Rob's not actually gonna be active\nin the project management side.\n\n457\n00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,050\nHe's not gonna come up\nwith the requirements.\n\n458\n00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,050\nWe're gonna be telling him what we want,\nand\n\n459\n00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,620\nhe's gonna be the one actually doing work.\n\n460\n00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,020\nSo, he's a subject matter expert, and\n\n461\n00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:23,260\nhe will actually be a person performing\nsome of the work packages that we create.\n\n462\n00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,580\nSo for him,\nhe's really a secondary stakeholder.\n\n463\n00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,810\nAnd so I'll put that down\nin here kinda flag that, so\n\n464\n00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,800\nthat he's got the entry, all right?\n\n465\n00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,510\nAnd then the ITProTV viewers, same thing.\n\n466\n00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,180\nSecondary or you might even put silent.\n\n467\n00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,980\nThis might not be, we might not\nactually communicate with these people.\n\n468\n00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,730\nWe just need to think about them,\nand know that they're there, and\n\n469\n00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,400\nbe aware that other people are involved.\n\n470\n00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,710\nSo, I'm gonna put them as secondary, and\nwe may send communications, we may not.\n\n471\n00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,260\nWe'll communicate via the show,\nright, that's how we'll do it and\n\n472\n00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,282\nwe'll worry about that during\nthe communication plan stuff.\n\n473\n00:23:56,282 --> 00:23:57,305\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, so\n\n474\n00:23:57,305 --> 00:24:01,614\nright there we've got our\nstakeholder register almost done.\n\n475\n00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:03,473\nWe still have the influence, and\nthen I've gotta sit down and\n\n476\n00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:04,561\ntype in the contact information I.\n\n477\n00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:08,605\nI don't mind sharing mine with all\nthe viewers, I know some of the other guys\n\n478\n00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:12,000\ndon't or prefer not to so\nI'll leave it blank for right now.\n\n479\n00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,830\nBut basically you just pop your\ninformation in there, I might not know\n\n480\n00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,390\nall the information I might not know\nall the phone numbers and so on.\n\n481\n00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,800\nAnd so that's where I've gotta go and\nget those.\n\n482\n00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,810\nI got speed dial on my phone.\n\n483\n00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,430\nI don't have to remember a number.\n\n484\n00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,100\nI might have to get that information.\n\n485\n00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,950\nFill it in here.\n\n486\n00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,710\nAnd we start to build it out, now, your\nstakeholder register may change over time.\n\n487\n00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,500\nEspecially during the planning phase\nyou're gonna start identifying new\n\n488\n00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,180\nstakeholders and\nyou're gonna be adding stakeholders.\n\n489\n00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,450\nLike when we figure out who\nwe're gonna buy stuff from,\n\n490\n00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,660\nthose companies that we're buying from,\nthey become stakeholders.\n\n491\n00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,030\nNot that they care whether\nour project succeeds or not.\n\n492\n00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,470\nBut we need to communicate with them as\nfar as, the purchases, and all of that.\n\n493\n00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,550\nSo they get entries in here too.\n\n494\n00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,610\nThis is kind of a living document.\n\n495\n00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,800\nDon't be afraid to leave\nparts of it empty.\n\n496\n00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,380\nYou can flush it all out or\nflush it all out later and\n\n497\n00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,750\nget all that extra information in there.\n\n498\n00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,680\nAll right so\nthat pretty much knocks that one out.\n\n499\n00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,400\nI've got my stuff in there,\n\n500\n00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,820\nwe need to deal with this influence but\nthe influence column actually brings in\n\n501\n00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,250\nanother document that we didn't see\nthat's actually not in the process chart.\n\n502\n00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,990\nBut there's one other tool that's\navailable to us they don't list here.\n\n503\n00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,540\nIt actually falls under stake\nholder analysis, we need to\n\n504\n00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,710\nanalyze our stakeholders to figure\nout what their level of influence is.\n\n505\n00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,900\nWe'll show how that works\nhere in a few moments.\n\n506\n00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,560\nAll right?\n\n507\n00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,740\nBut honestly it's probably a pretty\ngood spot for us to stop and\n\n508\n00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,680\ntake a break, isn't it Ryan?\n\n509\n00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,490\n>> Sounds great.\n\n510\n00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,220\n>> All right.\n\n511\n00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,210\nLet's stop here and\ntake a break and when we get back,\n\n512\n00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,610\nwe're going to do stakeholder analysis.\n\n513\n00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,731\nWe're gonna figure out\nthat influence level.\n\n514\n00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:37,231\nAnd we're gonna finish our\nstakeholder register so\n\n515\n00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:40,714\nstay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n516\n00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:45,483\n[SOUND] All right, so in the last\nsegment we got our chance to see\n\n517\n00:25:45,483 --> 00:25:50,347\nthe stake holder register, and\nwhat makes up that register and\n\n518\n00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:53,670\nsome of the information that's in there.\n\n519\n00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,135\nAnd we still have a little bit more\nto do with our stakeholder analysis.\n\n520\n00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:59,985\nNow, I want to go back to my notes\ncuz I wrote down some things that\n\n521\n00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:03,865\nare from the PMBK from the actual\nproject management body of knowledge\n\n522\n00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:06,675\nin regards to stakeholder analysis, right.\n\n523\n00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:10,800\nCuz you can spend all day long evaluating\nstakeholder needs if you're not careful,\n\n524\n00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,090\nso we need to know exactly\nwhat we're looking for, and\n\n525\n00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:17,360\nbasically they identify four or\nfive things we really need to specify or\n\n526\n00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360\nthat we need to look into right.\n\n527\n00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,060\nFirst off Identify all\npotential project stakeholders.\n\n528\n00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,490\nNow that's kind of what we've done so\nfar, right?\n\n529\n00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,410\nWe think about it,\nwe come up with that list,\n\n530\n00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,120\nwho is gonna become\na stakeholder in our project.\n\n531\n00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,990\nThen we analyze the potential impact or\n\n532\n00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,330\nsupport each stakeholder could generate,\nright?\n\n533\n00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,240\nSometimes stakeholders have a vested\ninterest in your project and\n\n534\n00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,550\nthey want it to succeed.\n\n535\n00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,850\nSometimes, they don't.\n\n536\n00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,040\nSometimes they hate you project.\n\n537\n00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,110\nAnd they want it to fail.\n\n538\n00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,090\nAnd they don't want to help.\n\n539\n00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:53,400\nAnd they can actually be what's\ncalled a resistor or a detractor.\n\n540\n00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,660\nAnd it can cause problems on your project,\nright?\n\n541\n00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,700\nWe need to know that.\n\n542\n00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,440\nNot anything personal, just it's business.\n\n543\n00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,240\nWe need to know, who can help and\nwho can hurt our project, right,\n\n544\n00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,520\nthink about like any government project.\n\n545\n00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,560\nIn the United States we have two primary\ngovernment parties the Republicans and\n\n546\n00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,510\nthe Democrats.\n\n547\n00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,950\nAnd any project,\ninitiated by the Democrats\n\n548\n00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,960\ncan be subverted by the Republicans and\nvise versa, right?\n\n549\n00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,890\nThey need be aware of who they're,\ntheir main detractors are going to be.\n\n550\n00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,300\nThen next, assess how key\nstakeholders are likely to react or\n\n551\n00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,090\nrespond in various situations.\n\n552\n00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,210\nI think we mentioned a little bit\nyesterday in an episode about risk.\n\n553\n00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,990\nAnd how you have some people who are risk\nseekers, others who are risk averse, and\n\n554\n00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,330\nthose who are risk neutral,\nthat's really kind of a gauge of\n\n555\n00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,800\nhow they would react faced\nwith certain decisions, right?\n\n556\n00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,010\nThat some are more than happy to\ntake big risks, others aren't.\n\n557\n00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,490\nUnderstanding that about people will help\nyou understand how you need to address\n\n558\n00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,050\nand handle them.\n\n559\n00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,930\nAnd that's just with risk,\nhere they're talking about everything.\n\n560\n00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:04,410\nHow will they respond, if we start to go a\nlittle over budget are they gonna balk and\n\n561\n00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,110\nsay gosh that's it, we're gonna try and\nkill this thing off?\n\n562\n00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,360\nWell if so\nwe've really gotta stick to our budget.\n\n563\n00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,090\nBut if they're okay with\ngoing over budget if they say\n\n564\n00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,140\nwe can go a little bit higher or whatever.\n\n565\n00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,050\nThen we have little flexibility there.\n\n566\n00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,370\nWe need to understand this early on\ncuz it's gonna help us to gauge our\n\n567\n00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,190\nkind of flexibilities, and I know like\nwith our project when I said for me,\n\n568\n00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,020\nif this went over two grand,\nthat's just too much.\n\n569\n00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,240\nWe're not gonna do it, right?\n\n570\n00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,280\nI'm kind of set this limit.\n\n571\n00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,870\nBut the time.\n\n572\n00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,180\nWe picked June 31st as our\nfinish date but, I don't care.\n\n573\n00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,670\nIt could be July 31st for all I care.\n\n574\n00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,320\nIf it pushes back well that's okay.\n\n575\n00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,980\nRight?\n\n576\n00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,100\nWe can start to identify where\nthere's that flexibility,\n\n577\n00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,340\nwho has the flexibility and\nwhat we can take advantage of, all right.\n\n578\n00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:56,500\nAnd then lastly is this entry here,\npower/influence matrix, now the pm\n\n579\n00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:02,600\nactually identifies four different things\nthat we can monitor, not monitor but use\n\n580\n00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,000\nto analyse people with in fact let me see\nif I can find that in the PMBK real quick.\n\n581\n00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,330\nI think I've got that\nopened here somewhere.\n\n582\n00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,160\nThere.\n\n583\n00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,960\nGia, you have that opened,\nanywhere what page is that on.\n\n584\n00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,790\n>> It is on 397.\n\n585\n00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:21,340\n>> 397 yeah, great example of something\nthat is way in the back of the book even\n\n586\n00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,400\nthough it's something we deal\nwith here in the beginning.\n\n587\n00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,460\nAll right.\n\n588\n00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,580\nHere we go.\n\n589\n00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,100\nWhen we go to analyze our stakeholders,\nright here.\n\n590\n00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,680\nThey identify four\ndifferent types of grids or\n\n591\n00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,760\nmodels we can use to identify them.\n\n592\n00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,310\nOne of them is called\na power/interest grid.\n\n593\n00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,420\nAnd with this, we rank people based on\n\n594\n00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,160\nhow much power they have in the company,\ncan they derail your project?\n\n595\n00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:52,070\nCan they support it by adding more\nresources, more time, money, people?\n\n596\n00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,560\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n597\n00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,280\nHow can they help us or\nhow can they hurt us?\n\n598\n00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,100\nAnd then interest.\n\n599\n00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,350\nHow much interest do they\nreally have in the project?\n\n600\n00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,540\nIs it something that really\neffects them and they care about?\n\n601\n00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,300\nCuz you might have somebody who's high\npower, but doesn't care about your project\n\n602\n00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,730\nin the slightest, and so they're not gonna\nbe somebody that you can go to for help.\n\n603\n00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,820\nRight?\nIf you're falling behind schedule or\n\n604\n00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,360\nwhatever they're not gonna help you.\n\n605\n00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,630\nEven though they have that power,\ntry and identify people based on that.\n\n606\n00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,000\nMore commonly, though,\nwe see a power/influence grid.\n\n607\n00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,800\nThis is the most common one.\n\n608\n00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,000\nPower, how much can\nthey do in the company?\n\n609\n00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,190\nHow much actual control do\nthey have in the company?\n\n610\n00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,740\nAnd influence, how much can they influence\nthe project and it's related stakeholders,\n\n611\n00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,010\nbecause there might be some\nrequirement that Nate wants.\n\n612\n00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,590\nNate wants something special\non this arcade cabinet.\n\n613\n00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,890\nBut I say boy, let's not do that,\nNate there's some technical reason.\n\n614\n00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,390\nI could say that.\n\n615\n00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,470\nAnd Nate respects my technical opinion,\nand so\n\n616\n00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,210\nI might be able to change his opinion thus\ninfluencing the direction of the project.\n\n617\n00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,540\nEven if I might not have power over that\nperson, sometimes you can influence them,\n\n618\n00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,430\nso that's a definite\ngood thing to measure.\n\n619\n00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,590\nYou can also do influence and impact.\n\n620\n00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,310\nAll right, influence I already\ntalked about but impact,\n\n621\n00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:11,385\nthat means if they decide to enforce their\nwill, how big of an impact can they have?\n\n622\n00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:11,955\nRight?\n\n623\n00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,165\nIf it's a mail room clerk, they probably\ncan't do much damage to your project,\n\n624\n00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,455\nthey can slow down some packages.\n\n625\n00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:19,385\nRight?\n[LAUGH] But if it's the CEO,\n\n626\n00:31:19,385 --> 00:31:21,770\nthey can cut off funding for your project.\n\n627\n00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,230\nThey may not be involved in your project,\nbut they can kill it, right.\n\n628\n00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,240\nThat is a huge impact,\n\n629\n00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,760\nwe need to make sure that we\ngauge our stakeholders that way.\n\n630\n00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,160\nAnd then there's a salience model.\n\n631\n00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,470\nAnd with the salience model,\nwe're basically doing the same thing.\n\n632\n00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,520\nExcept with three values,\nall the other ones are just two values.\n\n633\n00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,590\nPower in interest power in influence\ninfluence and impact, with salience\n\n634\n00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:48,310\nyou're doing power urgency and\nlegitimacy right?\n\n635\n00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,070\nPower kind of talked about.\n\n636\n00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,290\nUrgency.\n\n637\n00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:51,990\nYou know?\n\n638\n00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,410\nDo I need to address\nthis person right away.\n\n639\n00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,711\nIs this somebody who needs\nrapid information and\n\n640\n00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:59,793\nneeds to be kept up to date, or\nis this somebody I can just let sit on\n\n641\n00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,791\nthe back-burner and\nfeed them information as time provides?\n\n642\n00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:03,372\nAll right.\n\n643\n00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:04,637\nAnd then legitimacy.\n\n644\n00:32:04,637 --> 00:32:07,238\nShould they actually be involved\nin this project, right?\n\n645\n00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:09,970\nAnd you see this with government a lot.\n\n646\n00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,570\nWe get the political parties involvement\nand really probably shouldn't even be.\n\n647\n00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,695\nThey might not be a legitimate\nparticipant in this one, but\n\n648\n00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:20,310\nthey've impose themselves on the project.\n\n649\n00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:25,100\nAnd if that's the case, then you may\nwell be able to ignore their feedback.\n\n650\n00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,750\nBut if they have influence over\nother people in the project,\n\n651\n00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,420\neven though they don't have\na legitimate presence in the project,\n\n652\n00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,150\nthey can alter it and that's where\nthings start to get dangerous.\n\n653\n00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:34,680\n>> Right.\n\n654\n00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,490\n>> All right, so\n\n655\n00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,170\nif we can identify this stuff ahead of\ntime we'll be better off, all right.\n\n656\n00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,100\nWell the most common one is\na Power Influence grid, and\n\n657\n00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,620\nthat's what I want to take a look at.\n\n658\n00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,540\nSo we've got a little template that\nRonnie prepared and this is not it.\n\n659\n00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,500\nWhere did I put it, there.\n\n660\n00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,610\nNice and small.\n\n661\n00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,408\nAll right, so\nhere is a Stakeholder Analysis Matrix.\n\n662\n00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:03,224\nAnd again following our kind of standard,\nI'm gonna go in here and\n\n663\n00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:06,150\ninsert some of my project information.\n\n664\n00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:12,323\nThis is\nthe ITProTV Arcade Cabinet Project, right?\n\n665\n00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:18,000\nProject Manager is still me, I haven't\ngotten fired yet, which can happen.\n\n666\n00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,990\nYou can change Project Managers midstream.\n\n667\n00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,074\nAnd today is still 5/20/2014.\n\n668\n00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:30,350\nAll right and then what I've got\nis basically a square, right?\n\n669\n00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,060\nAnd I guess,\nlet me zoom out just a little bit.\n\n670\n00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,450\nThere, I've got a square.\n\n671\n00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:44,570\nAnd in said square,\nI've got Power and Interest, right?\n\n672\n00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,560\nBut I said I wanna do Power and\nInfluence so\n\n673\n00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,250\nI'm just gonna take this bottom one here\nand change it to Influence, all right.\n\n674\n00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,120\nPower being their power\nwithin the company,\n\n675\n00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,050\nand then influence being their influence\nover others in my project, right?\n\n676\n00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,680\nSo they might be low power but\nhave high influence and so\n\n677\n00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,110\nI still need to worry about them.\n\n678\n00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,990\nAll right, so\n\n679\n00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:09,290\nI'm going to start engaging my contacts\nby where they fall in this area.\n\n680\n00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,740\nAnd you can do it a few different ways.\n\n681\n00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,790\nIn the PMBOK, where did that thing go?\n\n682\n00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,510\nHere, they show one, and\nthey're doing Power and Interest.\n\n683\n00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,370\nAnd see what they're doing, is they're\njust kind of throwing dots in for\n\n684\n00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,410\nthe different people.\n\n685\n00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,950\nNow notice how they're just letters,\nright.\n\n686\n00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,520\nIt's kind of difficult to throw full\nnames into a chart like this and so\n\n687\n00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,530\nthey're doing letters.\n\n688\n00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,930\nIn the stakeholder registry, you'll\nassign a code or a letter to each person.\n\n689\n00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,505\nYeah, we didn't do that did we.\n\n690\n00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:36,680\n>> No.\n\n691\n00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,810\n>> So if I got back here to our\nstakeholder register, I might choose to\n\n692\n00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:44,730\nadd in another column here, that's their\ncode, and so I can represent in that way.\n\n693\n00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,750\nUsually it's something like initials.\n\n694\n00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,560\nAnd so you can say D P N C whatever and\nidentify people.\n\n695\n00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,530\nYou can come up with\nwhatever code that you want.\n\n696\n00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:54,560\nAll right.\n\n697\n00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,830\nBut for us, you know,\nwe just had a handful of people so\n\n698\n00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,320\nI don't want to go too crazy with this.\n\n699\n00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,210\n>> But they're mapping it out to say,\nif somebody is low,\n\n700\n00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,080\nlow power, low interest right?\n\n701\n00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,430\nThey don't have a lot of\npower in the company and\n\n702\n00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,280\nthey don't care about our project anyway.\n\n703\n00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,030\nThese are people that we'll just monitor.\n\n704\n00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,940\nWe'll monitor any feedback that we\nget from them, but we're not gonna\n\n705\n00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,840\nactively seek it out because these\npeople aren't really involved.\n\n706\n00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,120\nNot a lot of sense worrying about that.\n\n707\n00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:27,090\nBut there might be people that have\na lot of power, but no interest, right?\n\n708\n00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,510\nWell they have a lot of power, so\nthey could actually derail our project.\n\n709\n00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,960\nOr they can help it, right?\n\n710\n00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,230\nSo we just need to keep them satisfied.\n\n711\n00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,710\nStay off their radar, right?\n\n712\n00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,960\nDon't step on their toes.\n\n713\n00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,380\nDon't go over budget,\nbleed into their funds or whatever.\n\n714\n00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,850\nDon't mess with them, they won't mess with\nyou that's kind of the standpoint there.\n\n715\n00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,430\nSo we just keep them satisfied, give them\na little status updates from time to time.\n\n716\n00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,570\nIf they request more information\nprovide them with whatever they want,\n\n717\n00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,092\nbut don't make then part of the regular\ncommunications cause they're not gonna\n\n718\n00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:54,580\nneed it.\n\n719\n00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:01,100\nSame thing kind of goes for people\nwho are low power but high interest.\n\n720\n00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,890\nWe might have somebody that doesn't\nhave a lot of power in the company, but\n\n721\n00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,620\nthis project is gonna change their job,\nchange the way that they do work.\n\n722\n00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,720\nSo they're gonna have high interest,\nthey really wanna know what's going on,\n\n723\n00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,820\nall right?\n\n724\n00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,870\nSo these people,\nwe need to keep them informed.\n\n725\n00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,470\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n726\n00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,710\nwe're gonna send them every\nnotification we can so\n\n727\n00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,130\nthat they have an idea of\nwhat's coming down the road.\n\n728\n00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,730\nAnd if they do have feedback\nthey can provide it, but\n\n729\n00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,700\nsince they're low power we're not\nnecessarily going to act upon that.\n\n730\n00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,840\nNow the danger zone, and\nyou really color this red up here.\n\n731\n00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,650\nThe danger zone is up\nhere in the top right.\n\n732\n00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,480\nIn this scenario you've got people\nwho are high power and high interest.\n\n733\n00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,800\nThey're really interested\nin the project and\n\n734\n00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,580\nthey've got the power to help or\nhurt the project.\n\n735\n00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,060\nSo these guys,\nwe need to manage them closely, right?\n\n736\n00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,110\nKeep your friends close.\n\n737\n00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,420\nKeep your enemies closer.\n\n738\n00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,360\nWe need to make sure we are giving\nthem all the information they request,\n\n739\n00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,290\nthat we're listening to their feedback.\n\n740\n00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,210\nThat we're managing every aspect\nof communication with them to\n\n741\n00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,480\nkeep everything on the up and\nup and moving the project along.\n\n742\n00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,840\nAll right, so that's Power in Interest.\n\n743\n00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,740\nFor our project, let's do Power and\nInfluence, okay?\n\n744\n00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,460\n>> Okay.\n\n745\n00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,300\n>> So Power,\nI am not going to do dots within a square,\n\n746\n00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,040\nbecause that doesn't really matter,\nyou know?\n\n747\n00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,720\n>> Yeah.\n>> What really matters is just that you\n\n748\n00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:24,019\n>> You have the people kind of categorize,\n\n749\n00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:29,491\nso we've got people like, well we can just\n\n750\n00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:35,130\ngo down our stakeholder register, right?\n\n751\n00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,400\nSo we'll start here with me.\n\n752\n00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,340\nSo, Don Pezet.\n\n753\n00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:43,282\nAs far as influence, I carry a little\nbit of influence here, right?\n\n754\n00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:44,845\nIf somebody has an opinion and\n\n755\n00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,875\nI have a differing opinion,\n>> Right.\n\n756\n00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,325\n>> I can convince people\nfrom time to time and\n\n757\n00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:52,215\nI have decent amount of power because\nI do have purchasing power here.\n\n758\n00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:56,455\nSo I'm a high kind of on both\nof these level charts here, so\n\n759\n00:37:56,455 --> 00:38:00,085\nI'm just gonna put,\nDon Pezet over here, all right.\n\n760\n00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:04,495\nAnd then we've got, I was gonna try and\nmove that out of the way.\n\n761\n00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:07,730\n[LAUGH]\n>> What?\n\n762\n00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,850\n>> It's a fighting game.\n\n763\n00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,111\n>> I know,\nit's probably going to stay there forever.\n\n764\n00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:11,853\nAll right, so, I'll leave it there.\n\n765\n00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:15,810\nSo, then I've got who else, I've got\n>> Nathan.\n\n766\n00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,940\n>> Nate.\nAll right, now Nate,\n\n767\n00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,300\nhe has power in the company.\n\n768\n00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,180\nHe's the producer,\nhe's putting the shows on but\n\n769\n00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:29,230\nremember this is in respect to the company\nas a whole, not necessarily this project.\n\n770\n00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,300\nNow he has a lot of influence over the\nproject cause he is the originator, and\n\n771\n00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,410\nI want to make him happy.\n\n772\n00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,660\nSo he is a high influence person,\n\n773\n00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,750\nbut he's not really a high power person,\nas far as this project is concerned.\n\n774\n00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,470\nHe can't approve more funding,\n\n775\n00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,310\nhe can't approve more personnel\non this side project.\n\n776\n00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,930\nIf this were a show it\nwould be a different story.\n\n777\n00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,450\n>> Right.\n\n778\n00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,060\n>> A show, he's got high power on the show\nso it'd be different, but for him,\n\n779\n00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,800\nI'm gonna put him over here under\nhigh influence, but low power.\n\n780\n00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,100\nSo, Nathan Copeland right here, all right.\n\n781\n00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,150\nThen who else do we have?\n\n782\n00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,780\nWe've got Ronnie?\n\n783\n00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,970\n>> Yep.\nNow Ronnie you\n\n784\n00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,820\nare the Assistant Project Manager.\n\n785\n00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,510\n>> I am.\n>> So you'll be making decisions on my\n\n786\n00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,270\nbehalf if I'm not here.\n\n787\n00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,780\nYou have that authority, right?\n\n788\n00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,720\nAnd you're a fairly influential person\ntoo so I'm gonna stick you up here.\n\n789\n00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,470\nRight along the name, okay?\n\n790\n00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,005\nAll right, and then Rob, now Rob.\n\n791\n00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:29,720\n[LAUGH] Rob doesn't have a lot of\npower over this project, right?\n\n792\n00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,130\n>> Right.\n>> We're bringing him in as a subject\n\n793\n00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,160\nmatter expert,\nhe's gonna be doing some of the work.\n\n794\n00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,080\nSo it doesn't have a lot of power.\n\n795\n00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,670\nHe's on the low side.\n\n796\n00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,550\nOn the influence side?\n\n797\n00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,360\n>> No.\n\n798\n00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,010\n>> He's a carpenter.\n\n799\n00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,030\nHe was a carpenter.\n\n800\n00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,290\nHe's got expertise that we don't.\n\n801\n00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,550\nHe's gonna be high influence.\n\n802\n00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,130\nI'm gonna say that if Rob tells me hey,\ndon't use that wood.\n\n803\n00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:47,800\nUse this other wood.\n\n804\n00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,375\nIt's better.\nI'm gonna trust his judgment\n\n805\n00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,440\ncause I don't know.\n\n806\n00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,920\nSo we'll pop him over here.\n\n807\n00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,740\nAll right.\n\n808\n00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,910\nThen we've got the ITProTV viewers.\n\n809\n00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,602\nNow the ITProTV viewers,\nyou guys are customers.\n\n810\n00:39:59,602 --> 00:40:01,529\nIt's kind of an interesting thing, right.\n\n811\n00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:04,511\nYou don't have power in\nthe company in terms of,\n\n812\n00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:09,820\nyou're not our employee you don't work for\nus, you don't have a title.\n\n813\n00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:15,780\nBut you're our customer, and if you\nguys give us feedback we act on that.\n\n814\n00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,390\nSo while you don't have power in\nthe company, you'd be low power,\n\n815\n00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,900\nyou're actually gonna be high influence.\n\n816\n00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,970\nIf you tell us to do something,\nwe're gonna listen in most cases.\n\n817\n00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,300\nSo I'll put the ITProTV viewers there.\n\n818\n00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,680\nNow obviously as my\nstakeholder list grows,\n\n819\n00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,830\nI'll have people kind of\nfall into different areas.\n\n820\n00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:37,660\nBut remember what they were\nsuggesting in the PMI manual there,\n\n821\n00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,770\nthat each of these quadrants kind of\ncorresponds to a different action.\n\n822\n00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,360\nHow do I handle these people?\n\n823\n00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,686\nAnd I don't have anybody\nin the just monitor area.\n\n824\n00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:49,778\nWe could put Jason, our director,\n\n825\n00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:54,030\nwho wouldn't have a lot of power as\nfar as this project is concerned, and\n\n826\n00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,028\nhe wouldn't have a lot of influence\nin it cuz we don't respect him.\n\n827\n00:40:58,028 --> 00:41:04,340\n[LAUGH] It's fun to make fun of people\nwhen they don't have a microphone.\n\n828\n00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,270\nSo we can throw him in there if we wanted,\nbut\n\n829\n00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,360\nwe don't really have anybody\nthat falls in that scope.\n\n830\n00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,220\nSo we've got Don and Ronnie.\n\n831\n00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,280\nWe need to be managed closely.\n\n832\n00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,840\nWell, we're the ones doing the managing,\n\n833\n00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,040\nso not really anything\nto worry about there.\n\n834\n00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,590\nAnd then these guys down here,\nwe need to communicate with them,\n\n835\n00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,370\nkeep open channels and\ntry and keep them happy.\n\n836\n00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,642\nThat's what the PMI is suggesting here.\n\n837\n00:41:25,642 --> 00:41:27,130\nKeep informed.\n\n838\n00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,480\nMake sure that we're doing what they need.\n\n839\n00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:36,390\nSo now when we start to go and\nlook at their influence,\n\n840\n00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:44,370\nhere's where we're gonna put\nthings like manage closely.\n\n841\n00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:47,240\nAnd Nathan was keep informed.\n\n842\n00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,540\nRonnie was manage closely.\n\n843\n00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,129\nRob was keep informed.\n\n844\n00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,470\nAnd ITProTV viewers, keep informed.\n\n845\n00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,470\nAnd we're gonna use this information\nlater in our communications plan, but for\n\n846\n00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,520\nright now this is the influence\nwe've assigned to them.\n\n847\n00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,400\nAnd these terms,\nyou can use whatever terms you want.\n\n848\n00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,380\nSo you might want to assign them colors.\n\n849\n00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,330\nI've seen red, yellow,\n\n850\n00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:13,490\ngreen like a stop sign, where you have\nhere's people that are in the green,\n\n851\n00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,850\nhere's people that are in the yellow and\nhere's people that are in the red.\n\n852\n00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,930\nAnd you set up your communications\npattern based on that.\n\n853\n00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:23,690\nThe people in the red, those are the ones\nthat you interact with regularly.\n\n854\n00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:28,785\nPeople in the green, they're low risk,\nyou kind of let them cruise.\n\n855\n00:42:28,785 --> 00:42:33,222\nAll right, so when we're done,\n\n856\n00:42:33,222 --> 00:42:40,240\nwhat we've got is\na stakeholder analysis matrix.\n\n857\n00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,500\nSo now we've got the matrix.\n\n858\n00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,610\nIt's filled out.\n\n859\n00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,420\nI do need to save this in my project.\n\n860\n00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,390\nSo I will save it, and pop that in here.\n\n861\n00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:54,445\nSo again, this is gonna go back to\nInitiation- Stakeholder Analysis Matrix\n\n862\n00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:56,460\nv1.0.\n\n863\n00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,570\n>> Yeah, now this matrix for\n\n864\n00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:03,580\nus is really important in terms of\nadding new stakeholders as well.\n\n865\n00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,650\nAs more stakeholders may come onto the\nproject, we need to be able to place them\n\n866\n00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,040\nwhere we need to and be able to know their\ninfluence and their power right away.\n\n867\n00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,160\nAnd so maybe we can't actually\nunderstand it right away.\n\n868\n00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,110\nBut maybe by bringing this matrix up,\n\n869\n00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,640\nit gives us that ability to kind of\nvisualize it and then go, I know exactly\n\n870\n00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,020\nwhere I need to actually keep them in line\nwith the communications process here.\n\n871\n00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,620\n>> All right, so we've got that done.\n\n872\n00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,140\nWe've got our stakeholder register\npretty much filled out now.\n\n873\n00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,610\nI might need to come back and\nupdate some of this later on.\n\n874\n00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,990\nBut for the most part we're there.\n\n875\n00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,670\nMost everything is done.\n\n876\n00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,770\nI did forget to talk about one thing.\n\n877\n00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:41,355\nI mentioned under classification how\nwe were doing primary and secondary.\n\n878\n00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:43,930\nI didn't mention any of the other\ntypes that were out there.\n\n879\n00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,776\nAnd PMI actually calls\nout a few in the PMBOK.\n\n880\n00:43:47,776 --> 00:43:48,276\nWhere's my notes?\n\n881\n00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,200\nSo if you go into the PMBOK,\nyou'll find a few other ones.\n\n882\n00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,550\nSome people choose to classify them based\non whether they're internal or external.\n\n883\n00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,285\nInternal meaning, are they your employees,\nor external, somebody outside.\n\n884\n00:44:00,285 --> 00:44:02,134\nYou know,\nif you're dealing with contractors and\n\n885\n00:44:02,134 --> 00:44:04,180\nthings you have internal and external.\n\n886\n00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,830\nYou might also choose to break it down\nby supporter, neutral, or resistor.\n\n887\n00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:13,900\nSupporter, somebody who wants to help\nyour project succeed and finish.\n\n888\n00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,590\nYou have resistors, people who\ndon't want your project to succeed.\n\n889\n00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,380\nAnd neutral people,\n\n890\n00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,390\npeople who don't care either way, they're\njust there to get the project going.\n\n891\n00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,550\nAnd classifying them that way,\n\n892\n00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,700\nagain, is just kind of that meter\nstick you can use to measure this.\n\n893\n00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:33,175\nNow keep in mind,\njust like with the project charter,\n\n894\n00:44:33,175 --> 00:44:35,635\nremember on the charter,\nhow I deleted several fields?\n\n895\n00:44:35,635 --> 00:44:37,105\nI said hey,\nthese don't really apply to us.\n\n896\n00:44:37,105 --> 00:44:38,075\nWe'll drop them out.\n\n897\n00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,445\nThat's how the stakeholder\nregister is too.\n\n898\n00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:44,065\nAt a minimum,\nyou don't need all of this information.\n\n899\n00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:48,550\nAt a minimum you need name and\nrole, right?\n\n900\n00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,500\nPreferably name, role and\ncontact information.\n\n901\n00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,590\nBut name and role is really all you need.\n\n902\n00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,410\nThe person and\nwhat their role is within the project so\n\n903\n00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,600\nyou can keep track of everybody\nwho's attached to that project.\n\n904\n00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,610\nIf you don't get the contact\ninformation that's gonna be difficult.\n\n905\n00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,460\nBut really that's the minimum you need.\n\n906\n00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,150\nSo let's say, for example, that you're\nin a politically sensitive environment.\n\n907\n00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,629\nYou don't want to put somebody on here and\nthrow their classification as resistor and\n\n908\n00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,059\nput manage closely and all of that stuff,\nbecause they're gonna read that document\n\n909\n00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:20,350\nand say, wait a minute,\nare you calling me a resistor?\n\n910\n00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,130\nWho do you think you are?\n\n911\n00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,400\nAnd you can really ruffle some feathers,\nright?\n\n912\n00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,050\nSo in that type of an environment\nyou might say, you know what?\n\n913\n00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,310\nIt's not worth even tracking that.\n\n914\n00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,480\nAnd so you might choose to ditch\nthat particular column and\n\n915\n00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,100\njust say I don't need that\nclassification or whatever.\n\n916\n00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,240\nSo you may choose to\nknock some of these out.\n\n917\n00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,350\nAs with all this stuff,\nit's designed to be modular.\n\n918\n00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,360\nYou pick and choose the pieces you want.\n\n919\n00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,075\nBut like I said,\nat a minimum you need their name and role.\n\n920\n00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:50,170\nAll right, so now that we've got that,\nwe've got our stakeholder register,\n\n921\n00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,570\nlet me just make sure I save that.\n\n922\n00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:56,805\nWe've got our stakeholder analysis matrix,\nand as we go through planning and\n\n923\n00:45:56,805 --> 00:45:59,675\nwe identify more people,\nwe may have to come back and edit this.\n\n924\n00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:02,205\nSo this is a bit of a living document.\n\n925\n00:46:02,205 --> 00:46:05,415\nIt doesn't have lasting effect\non our project as a whole, so\n\n926\n00:46:05,415 --> 00:46:06,665\nwe don't worry about that too much.\n\n927\n00:46:06,665 --> 00:46:08,782\nWe'll see other documents\nwhere that's not the case.\n\n928\n00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:10,622\nBut I think that pretty much knocks out.\n\n929\n00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:13,188\nAnything else?\n\n930\n00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:14,582\n>> That's just about everything.\n\n931\n00:46:14,582 --> 00:46:16,192\n>> No, that does seem to be it.\n\n932\n00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:18,662\nSo those are the things that\nwe need to keep in mind.\n\n933\n00:46:18,662 --> 00:46:21,570\nJust to kind of review a few things.\n\n934\n00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,400\nWhen we do the identification of people,\nwe identify what they are,\n\n935\n00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,520\nwhat their role is,\nwe also do our assessment.\n\n936\n00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,450\nAnd with the assessments I was saying\nwhether we need to manage them closely or\n\n937\n00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,320\njust monitor or whatever.\n\n938\n00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,370\nYou might also have other things like\n\n939\n00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:42,000\nkeeping track of what phase in the\nlifecycle they have the most interest in.\n\n940\n00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,960\nThey might not have interest\nin the whole project.\n\n941\n00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,270\nSo like, Rob, who's gonna be building\nthis cabinet for us, he might not care so\n\n942\n00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:52,950\nmuch about initiation and\nclosing and monitoring and analysis.\n\n943\n00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:57,810\nBut planning and execution, right,\nhe's gonna care about those.\n\n944\n00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,520\nSo I might wanna get even that\ndetailed and start to break that down.\n\n945\n00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,112\nThese are all different things that\nwe can choose to do if necessary.\n\n946\n00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:08,819\nAll right, but otherwise that wraps\nup the stakeholder analysis, and\n\n947\n00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,731\nreally this wraps up the initiation phase.\n\n948\n00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:15,540\nNow I want to talk about one last\nthing before we wrap up this show,\n\n949\n00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,480\nwhich is there is a phase called closing.\n\n950\n00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,180\nAnd the closing phase, a lot of us\nthink about it in terms of closing\n\n951\n00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,670\nthe end of the project, and\nthat's definitely true.\n\n952\n00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,540\nBut you can also use the closing phase\nat the end of every other phase.\n\n953\n00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,150\nSo we just closed,\nwe just finished initiation.\n\n954\n00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,500\nWe may choose to implement\nclosing right now.\n\n955\n00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:37,989\nAnd that doesn't mean\nshut the project down.\n\n956\n00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,975\nIt means by closing we go and\ndouble check.\n\n957\n00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:42,565\nDid all the work get done?\n\n958\n00:47:42,565 --> 00:47:45,885\nDid all the documents get generated\nthat should have been documented?\n\n959\n00:47:45,885 --> 00:47:49,785\nAnd then we gather the documents and\ndistribute them to the stakeholders and\n\n960\n00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:51,235\nsay, here's where we're at right now.\n\n961\n00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,305\nWe just finished initiation.\n\n962\n00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:58,757\nSo as a part of our project,\nas a part of our ITProTV cabinet project,\n\n963\n00:47:58,757 --> 00:48:03,363\nif I go in here and look,\nI have generated four documents,\n\n964\n00:48:03,363 --> 00:48:06,183\nI generated a project charter, and\n\n965\n00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:12,210\nI've got two copies because one is\nthe original and the other one is signed.\n\n966\n00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,560\nSo it's a PDF, the one that's signed.\n\n967\n00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,090\nI've got our stakeholder analysis that\nwe did and our stakeholder register.\n\n968\n00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:23,450\nHere is our project so\nfar, these four documents.\n\n969\n00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,450\nNow we're ready to move into planning.\n\n970\n00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,940\nSo when we get into that planning phase\nwe'll see that these service inputs,\n\n971\n00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,160\nwe can't get into planning\nwithout doing these first.\n\n972\n00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,950\nNow we're done, we're ready to move on.\n\n973\n00:48:35,072 --> 00:48:37,860\nAll right, well, this is a pretty\ngood spot for us to stop right here.\n\n974\n00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,881\nWe're going to wrap up this show a little\nbit early, cuz we're done with a phase and\n\n975\n00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:43,898\nwe're ready to move into the next phase.\n\n976\n00:48:43,898 --> 00:48:47,205\nLet me just remind everybody if you\nhave any questions on what we've done,\n\n977\n00:48:47,205 --> 00:48:50,890\nI know it's been pretty softball so\nfar, so nothing really challenging.\n\n978\n00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,420\nBut if you have any questions, live during\nthe show you can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n979\n00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,980\nyou'll see the chat box\nright beneath the video.\n\n980\n00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,060\nPost your questions there.\n\n981\n00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,070\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n982\n00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:04,360\nIf you have questions afterwards,\nmake use of the Q&A forums.\n\n983\n00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,370\nThey're there for you.\n\n984\n00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:08,680\nYou click on the Q&A link on\nthe top of every ITProTV page,\n\n985\n00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,880\nit'll take you into the forums so\nyou can post your questions.\n\n986\n00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,860\nWe monitor and answer.\n\n987\n00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,340\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed this show.\n\n988\n00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,630\nStay tuned because we're gonna be coming\nback with the planning phase next.\n\n989\n00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:21,640\nIf you're watching live,\nit'll probably actually be tomorrow.\n\n990\n00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,860\nSo we'll jump into that, start tackling\nsome of the cool things that are there.\n\n991\n00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,913\nAnd we'll have some fun with that.\n\n992\n00:49:25,913 --> 00:49:28,534\nSo excitement down the road.\n\n993\n00:49:28,534 --> 00:49:32,323\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n994\n00:49:32,323 --> 00:49:32,969\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n995\n00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,889\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n996\n00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:44,889\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

right, good morning.\n\n5\n00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,870\nGood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n6\n00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,180\nAnd welcome back.\n\n7\n00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,860\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,200\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,030\nHow it going, Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,570\n>> I am doing well this morning.\n\n11\n00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,250\nMy Carmen Electra tattoo\ncover up went very well.\n\n12\n00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:48,940\n>> Excellent.\n\n13\n00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,940\n>> So I'm doing very well.\n\n14\n00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,260\n>> What did you get, a pink unicorn?\n\n15\n00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,980\n>> Two.\n>> Two?\n\n16\n00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,100\n>> Two pink unicorns.\n\n17\n00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,050\n>> Pink unicorns butting heads, right,\n\n18\n00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,365\nbecause that's the manliest\ntattoo that we can arrange.\n\n19\n00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:02,710\n[LAUGH] All right well,\nspeaking of tattoo cover ups, right.\n\n20\n00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,160\nIf you're in that situation,\n\n21\n00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,725\nit's probably because in your life,\nyou made some bad decisions, right?\n\n22\n00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:10,480\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, that was a bad decision.\n\n23\n00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,150\n>> Good decisions don't\nlead to tattoo cover ups.\n\n24\n00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,700\n>> There you go.\n\n25\n00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,310\n>> And how could we've avoided that?\n\n26\n00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,172\nWIth good planning.\n\n27\n00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:15,700\n>> Planning.\n[LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,620\n>> See, this is an awesome segue.\n\n29\n00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,500\nAll right, so\nin project management we mentioned in\n\n30\n00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,670\na previous episode that there's\nfive phases we need to worry about.\n\n31\n00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,930\nActually, let me bring\nup our phases diagram,\n\n32\n00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,490\nI've got that thing sitting\naround here some where.\n\n33\n00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,270\nAnd there we go, our five phases,\nI've got the logical diagram here,\n\n34\n00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,820\nwhich I like a little better anyway.\n\n35\n00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,062\nBut Initiation is what we\ncovered in the last episode,\n\n36\n00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,340\njust kind of getting started.\n\n37\n00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:37,890\n>> Right.\n\n38\n00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,180\nAnd the next one is Planning.\n\n39\n00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,860\nThere is no substitute for good planning.\n\n40\n00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,240\nYou need to dedicate some time to this.\n\n41\n00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,000\nIn fact, in many projects,\nyou'll spend more time Planning,\n\n42\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,280\nthan you actually do in Execution,\nMonitoring, Controlling, and Closing.\n\n43\n00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,070\nThe bulk of your time is spent here and\nI know I've used NASA as an example a few\n\n44\n00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,150\ntimes, just because they're\nhigh visibility projects.\n\n45\n00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,610\nWhen they send a rocket into\nspace to deploy a satellite,\n\n46\n00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,320\nthat mission takes three, four days, but\n\n47\n00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,780\nit might have had years\n>> Years.\n\n48\n00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,460\n>> Of planning leading up to it\nbecause they wanna make sure they have\n\n49\n00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,750\nthe best information possible.\n\n50\n00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,170\nNow, in the private sector,\n\n51\n00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,830\nwe don't normally have years to\nmake something happen, right.\n\n52\n00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,650\nEspecially not in IT, time will pass us\nby, so we typically have to be faster.\n\n53\n00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,230\nBut you still wanna make sure\nyou perform adequate planning.\n\n54\n00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,200\nGood planning now can save you from\nthat tattoo cover up later on, right?\n\n55\n00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,730\n>> Yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,850\nMany project managers will\npretty much tell you that\n\n57\n00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,460\nprojects don't really fail at the end.\n\n58\n00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,260\nWhen you talk about the idea\nof project failure,\n\n59\n00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,540\nit normally happens at the beginning.\n\n60\n00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,630\nIn other words, during the planning stage.\n\n61\n00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,780\nThat we're not careful here, if we don't\ntry to get as much information as we can\n\n62\n00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,950\nhere, that's where the project\nreally begins to fail.\n\n63\n00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,590\nSo it is really actually for\nour sake right, important\n\n64\n00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,790\nthat we actually understand everything\nthat we can about the Planning stage.\n\n65\n00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,420\n>> Yep.\n\n66\n00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,565\n>> And\n>> And so the PMI recognizes this.\n\n67\n00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:03,295\n>> Yeah.\n>> And they address it with a process\n\n68\n00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,095\nall itself.\n\n69\n00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:05,935\nAnd this is a super important one.\n\n70\n00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,365\nLet me pull the PMBOK up here.\n\n71\n00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:09,205\nHere we go.\n\n72\n00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:10,565\nSo when we take a look at,\n\n73\n00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:15,930\nyou know yesterday or last episode,\nwe wrapped up initiating, so that's done.\n\n74\n00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,520\nNow we're moving into Planning.\n\n75\n00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,510\nThe very first process group that\nwe have here, or the first process,\n\n76\n00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,552\nis the develop Project Management Plan,\nall right?\n\n77\n00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:28,160\nThis is kind of a funny one and\n\n78\n00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,150\nyou're going to see this\nthroughout the processes.\n\n79\n00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,990\nAnytime you see that word, develop a plan.\n\n80\n00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,380\nThat doesn't mean we're actually\nplanning for our project.\n\n81\n00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,586\nWe're planning, [LAUGH] what have I done?\n\n82\n00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:41,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're planning for\n\n83\n00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,660\nprojects in general, right?\n\n84\n00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,630\nSo we're saying we need\nto come up with a plan of\n\n85\n00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,610\nhow we're going to manage our project.\n\n86\n00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,210\nRight?\nSo,\n\n87\n00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,660\nit doesn't matter what the project is,\nper se.\n\n88\n00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,010\nThere are little variations\nfrom project to project, but\n\n89\n00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,852\njust overall,\nhow are we going to manage this project?\n\n90\n00:03:58,852 --> 00:03:59,850\nAll right?\n\n91\n00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,290\nSo they call that developing\nthe Project Management Plan.\n\n92\n00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,270\nAnd what it is is\na collection of safeguards,\n\n93\n00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,660\nto make sure that we've taken a look at\nall the things that we need to look at.\n\n94\n00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,870\nThat we've done our due diligence.\n\n95\n00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,310\nThat we've gathered the information\nwe needed, before we make decisions.\n\n96\n00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,110\nSo we ensure that we're doing\nthe proper level of Planning.\n\n97\n00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,090\nYou don't have to do this process,\nyou can leave this off.\n\n98\n00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,520\nSay, screw it,\nI'm going to fly by the seat of my pants.\n\n99\n00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,720\nYou can do that.\n\n100\n00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,030\nBut then halfway through the project, when\nyou realize, I really should have sent out\n\n101\n00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,470\nsome quotes and bids, I should have had\na backup seller in case one fell through.\n\n102\n00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,810\nThen you'll say oh, I wish I would have\nthought about that back in Planning.\n\n103\n00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,260\nIf you've got a good\nProject Management Plan in place,\n\n104\n00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,950\nthen you'll know to do\nthat stuff early on.\n\n105\n00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,480\nYou'll know if your missing something,\n\n106\n00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,870\nand you can take care of that before\nit becomes an issue down the road.\n\n107\n00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,020\nReally important.\n\n108\n00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,820\n>> Yeah.\nTo tell you'll how important this is\n\n109\n00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,850\nto the idea of PMI, right.\n\n110\n00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,340\nOf those 47 actual actions that we can do,\nokay,\n\n111\n00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,185\n24 of them reside in this\nparticular group here.\n\n112\n00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:01,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I mean, you can't say that hey,\n\n113\n00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,570\nthey didn't emphasize this enough.\n\n114\n00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,310\nSo if 24 out of the 47\nactually reside here and\n\n115\n00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,350\nthe rest of them are actually divided\nover the other process groups,\n\n116\n00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,190\nyou gotta realize that this is by far\nthe most important thing we're gonna do.\n\n117\n00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,580\n>> Did you count those Ronnie or\ndid you read them?\n\n118\n00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,603\n>> I did.\n>> [LAUGH] You did?\n\n119\n00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:16,263\nThat's awesome.\n\n120\n00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:18,170\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nwhen I read it I was like, no,\n\n121\n00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,442\nthat's not true, oh, it is, it is true.\n\n122\n00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:21,720\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n123\n00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,060\nso obviously we gotta lot of\neffort here in Planning and\n\n124\n00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,645\nit all starts right here with coming up\nwith the plan for our planning, right?\n\n125\n00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:33,210\n[LAUGH] So it's develop\na Project Management Plan, and\n\n126\n00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,860\nit looks like a very\nsimple little process,\n\n127\n00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,040\nbut the challenge with this process\nis how many outputs it has.\n\n128\n00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,150\nLet me go back to my diagram, and\n\n129\n00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,800\nif we go into our Develop a Project\nManagement Plan, we've got our inputs that\n\n130\n00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,870\nfeed into it which is really all\nthe data we have at this point.\n\n131\n00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now if we just initiated,\n\n132\n00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,410\nwe probably don't have a lot of input.\n\n133\n00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,320\nWe have a project charter, right?\n\n134\n00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,340\nWe gotta have that to, don't go into\nPlanning without a Project Charter.\n\n135\n00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,790\nSo we should have that.\n\n136\n00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,740\nAnd Enterprise Environmental Factors,\nOrganizational Process Assets,\n\n137\n00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,250\nthose are ones we've already talked about.\n\n138\n00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,780\nBut then you see this,\noutput from other processes.\n\n139\n00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,770\nWell, we've only had two processes so\nfar and\n\n140\n00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,950\ntheir output was the Project Charter and\nit was basically what we created and\n\n141\n00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,040\na brief look at a,\nlike a requirements document,\n\n142\n00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,150\nnot anything heavy, and\nthat really ended up in the charter too.\n\n143\n00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,530\nSo what are they talking about there when\nthey say Output from Other Processes?\n\n144\n00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,560\nWell they're talking about Output\nfrom Other Planning Processes.\n\n145\n00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,530\nSo if we look down here develop\na Project Management Plan,\n\n146\n00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,010\nthat plan is made up of\nseveral other subplans.\n\n147\n00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,360\nAnd, Ronnie,\nyou listed them in the notes, didn't you?\n\n148\n00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n149\n00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,250\nHere.\n\n150\n00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,380\nSo the Project Management Plan is\nwhat we're going to be creating.\n\n151\n00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,830\nThat's our output and\nit looks really simple right here.\n\n152\n00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,030\nJust Project Management Plan,\neasy one output, that's it.\n\n153\n00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,660\nBut it's made up of subplans\nthat are all these things.\n\n154\n00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,260\nYour Scope Management Plan, your\nRequirements, Schedule, Cost, Quality.\n\n155\n00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,740\nAll these individual plans that\nsay how you're going to manage\n\n156\n00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,430\nthat particular aspect of your project,\nall right?\n\n157\n00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,490\nSo cost,\nhow am I going to going to manage that?\n\n158\n00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,940\nHow am I going to manage coming up with\nestimates for what things are going cost?\n\n159\n00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,434\nHow am I going to manage\nassigning budgets?\n\n160\n00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:19,360\nTracking it?\n\n161\n00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,820\nWho is going to be writing the checks?\n\n162\n00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,199\nHow do I handle all of that stuff?\n\n163\n00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,160\nWell your Cost Management Plan\nwill tell you exactly\n\n164\n00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,690\nhow you're supposed to manage the cost and\nhow you're supposed to handle that.\n\n165\n00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,080\nAnd so you would just take\nthat Cost Management Plan and\n\n166\n00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,720\ngo down and fill out the information\nas it pertains to your project.\n\n167\n00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,410\nAnd now you would know how that works.\n\n168\n00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,280\nAnd that would become a part of\nyour Project Management Plan,\n\n169\n00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,840\nso building this is a lot of work.\n\n170\n00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,680\nI might not be able to build that\nCost Management Plan right now.\n\n171\n00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,060\nI might need to go and\ntake a look at my costs.\n\n172\n00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,992\nI haven't even looked at them yet, right?\n\n173\n00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:55,880\nAnd if we go here,\nwe'll see down in cost, right?\n\n174\n00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,514\nProject Cost Management,\nyou'll see in here Plan cost management.\n\n175\n00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:04,714\nThat is coming up with that particular\npart, that cost management plan,\n\n176\n00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:08,660\nwhich will become a part of\nthe project management plan.\n\n177\n00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,360\nSo you don't just sit down and say,\n\n178\n00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,330\nI'm gonna whip out a project\nmanagement plan like this.\n\n179\n00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,060\nNo, you're gonna have to come\nback to this several times.\n\n180\n00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,446\nSo you might do a quick draft that's very,\nvery simple, maybe one page.\n\n181\n00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:23,726\nAnd then as you go through\nthese other processes,\n\n182\n00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:27,250\nyou come back to the management plan and\nyou add to it.\n\n183\n00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,700\nThat's what happens if we have absolutely\nnothing to go on in the first place,\n\n184\n00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,800\nif this is the first formal project\nmanagement activity that we've\n\n185\n00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,350\never performed.\n\n186\n00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,460\nBut for\nmost companies that's not the case.\n\n187\n00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,000\nMost companies already have formal\nproject management in place.\n\n188\n00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,410\nAnd so they already have\na project management plan and\n\n189\n00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,730\nall the subsidiary plans.\n\n190\n00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,350\nThey've already got these drawn up, and\n\n191\n00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,850\nall we have to do is to adjust\nthem to meet our needs.\n\n192\n00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,850\nSo when we look at this\nentry here in the PMBOK,\n\n193\n00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,410\nthis first entry here, this 4.2 develop\na project management plan, that's really\n\n194\n00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,500\nreferring to companies that already\nhave formal project management in place.\n\n195\n00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,630\nAll we do, and this would be\na organizational process asset, right,\n\n196\n00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,260\nour company already has it.\n\n197\n00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,385\nWe go to our PMO or\nour project management manager or\n\n198\n00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,700\n[LAUGH] whoever it is that's our boss,\nand we say hey,\n\n199\n00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,240\ncan I have a copy of our\nstandard project management plan?\n\n200\n00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,250\nThey'll give you what\nwill likely be a book.\n\n201\n00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,940\nIt will contain all of this stuff.\n\n202\n00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,840\nThe overall project management plan as\nwell as templates for scope management,\n\n203\n00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,260\nrequirements management, all of these\nother things, and maybe others.\n\n204\n00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,920\nWe've got that May Include Others.\n\n205\n00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,800\nSo they'll give you this booklet\nthat has all that data, and\n\n206\n00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,960\nyou then just have to go through and fill\nit out as it pertains to your project.\n\n207\n00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,470\nSo in that environment,\n\n208\n00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,480\nyou might be able to just get started\nright away right here doing this.\n\n209\n00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,660\nBut if this is the very first time,\nthe first formal project management,\n\n210\n00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,800\nnobody else in the company\nhas done it before,\n\n211\n00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,380\nthey're not going to have that plan, and\nso you might have to put this one on hold.\n\n212\n00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,480\nYou might have to say, you know what?\n\n213\n00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,080\nI am not going to start here with a\nmanagement plan, because I just don't have\n\n214\n00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,560\nenough information to know\nwhat's gonna go in there.\n\n215\n00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,010\nSo then you skip it and\nyou move to these other guys.\n\n216\n00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,020\nYou start working on them.\n\n217\n00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,460\nAnd as you work on them, each one, if you\nlook down the line here, see how each one,\n\n218\n00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,000\nplan scope management, plan schedule\nmanagement, plan cost management,\n\n219\n00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,860\nplan quality management,\nplan human resources management,\n\n220\n00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,370\neach one is generating\ntheir individual plan.\n\n221\n00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,170\nAnd so you may move through each knowledge\narea, over here on the left side,\n\n222\n00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,860\nthese are our knowledge areas.\n\n223\n00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,220\nYou might move through each knowledge\narea, and create a plan one by one.\n\n224\n00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,360\nAnd when you're done, you then combine all\nof those plans into one big super plan,\n\n225\n00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,070\nand that's what fulfills the needs\nof this first process group.\n\n226\n00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:08,230\nSo one of the things I wanna make\nsure I drive home with you guys,\n\n227\n00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,740\nthat everybody has\na good understanding of,\n\n228\n00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,410\nis while the project has a certain\nchronological order that it follows,\n\n229\n00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,440\ninitiate then plan then execute and\nmonitor at the same time then close.\n\n230\n00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,210\nBecause that's the kind of\nnormal processes we follow,\n\n231\n00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,540\nthat's fine up there at\nthe process groups, at the phases.\n\n232\n00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,940\nBut inside of a phase it's\nnot chronological anymore.\n\n233\n00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,080\nSo you might be jumping way\ndown here to cost management\n\n234\n00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,290\nbefore you've done scope management.\n\n235\n00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,080\nIt's not the greatest idea, but you can.\n\n236\n00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,860\nSo you might be moving things around, or\nthey might be happening at the same time,\n\n237\n00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,590\nyou have different teams planning.\n\n238\n00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,150\nThese are all things that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n239\n00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,330\nAll right, so let's pretend,\nRonnie, that we've got a project\n\n240\n00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:55,330\nto do and we've got no formal\nproject infrastructure in place.\n\n241\n00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,110\nIt hasn't been done before.\n\n242\n00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,600\nThe first thing that you're\ngonna need are templates, and\n\n243\n00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,850\nwe talked a little bit about templates.\n\n244\n00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:05,570\nYou know, [LAUGH] I think we edited\nit out, so you guys probably didn't\n\n245\n00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,298\nsee it in the show, but I refer to some\ntemplates that were on PMI's website.\n\n246\n00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:13,940\nAnd [LAUGH] they were made in an older\nversion of Microsoft Office, and\n\n247\n00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,980\nthey were just a nightmare.\n\n248\n00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,290\nWhen I loaded them up in\nthe newest version of Office I\n\n249\n00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,370\ncouldn't work with them.\n\n250\n00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,780\nSo I burned some midnight\noil last night and\n\n251\n00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,680\nI've actually rewritten the majority\nof those templates in the current\n\n252\n00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,650\nMicrosoft Word format, and\nI think I did one in Excel.\n\n253\n00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,750\nSo I'll post those.\n\n254\n00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,590\nWe'll put them on the website so\nyou guys can download them.\n\n255\n00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,371\nThe ones from PMI, they're just basically\nsupposed to serve as that first step and\n\n256\n00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:40,440\nthen you customize them as you need.\n\n257\n00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,550\nYou can use mine and\ncustomize them if you want.\n\n258\n00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,230\nBut that project management plan, the plan\nitself might actually be pretty simple,\n\n259\n00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,090\nbut all those subplans is where\nthe real data comes from.\n\n260\n00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,019\nSo I've been kind of\nchurning through those and\n\n261\n00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:58,980\nlet me figure out where I put those.\n\n262\n00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,084\nSo if we look here just kind of looking\nat my list of documents that I've made,\n\n263\n00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:07,460\nyou'll notice that I don't\nhave a single document\n\n264\n00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,229\nthat is called project management plan.\n\n265\n00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:12,060\nThat there's no one temple that\nthe project management plan.\n\n266\n00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,641\nIt is made of all the individual\ncomponents that fall inside of it.\n\n267\n00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:24,490\nSo if I look at some of these, the first\none is the scope management plan.\n\n268\n00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,860\nSo I want to have that\nscope management plan,\n\n269\n00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,920\nthat's a real important thing for me.\n\n270\n00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,340\nSo I'll go back to my templates here and\nI'll find my scope management plan.\n\n271\n00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,310\nAnd so here is an example\nof a scope management plan.\n\n272\n00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,280\nAnd it's really simple,\nit's all blank right now,\n\n273\n00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,230\nwe just need to fill it\nin with our information.\n\n274\n00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,400\nAnd we're gonna specify things like, well,\n\n275\n00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,370\nhow are we gonna develop\nour scope statement?\n\n276\n00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,020\nNow we haven't really\ntalked about scope yet, and\n\n277\n00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,135\nwe're gonna do that in a later episode.\n\n278\n00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:57,900\nBut the scope statement is\n\n279\n00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,440\nthe governing statement that defines\nwhat you're gonna do in your project.\n\n280\n00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,850\nSo it is the main judge of how you know\nwhen your project is done and successful.\n\n281\n00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,900\nSo how do we develop that scope statement?\n\n282\n00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,670\nHow do we come up with it?\n\n283\n00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,940\nWe need to have a methodology of\nhow we create that scope statement.\n\n284\n00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,590\nWhat steps can we take?\n\n285\n00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,266\nWell, we might just go and follow\nthe develop a scope statement process and\n\n286\n00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:24,660\nfollow its methods.\n\n287\n00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,170\nAnd so we would put that here and\n\n288\n00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,400\nsay, in order to create a scope statement\nyou need to use these tools and steps.\n\n289\n00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,445\nAnd do I have that?\n\n290\n00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:33,524\nLets see.\n\n291\n00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:36,740\nPlan scope management,\nhere, define a scope.\n\n292\n00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,540\nSo here's the define a scope process.\n\n293\n00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,950\nAnd you'll see in the tools and\ntechniques we've got expert judgment,\n\n294\n00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,690\nproduct analysis, alternatives generation,\nfacilitated workshops.\n\n295\n00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,460\nThese are all different\nthings we could use.\n\n296\n00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,490\nAnd so in that plan.\n\n297\n00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:58,930\nSo in that plan I would specify what tools\nwe would use as part of our company.\n\n298\n00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,370\nSo, facilitated workshops.\n\n299\n00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,190\nSo we put in here run\na facilitated workshop with\n\n300\n00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:11,020\nthe known stakeholders to come up with the\nrequirements and build a scope statement.\n\n301\n00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,270\nA very simple general thing just\nindicating what tools to use,\n\n302\n00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,930\nhow to go about it, and\nwho to get involved.\n\n303\n00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,660\nJust think like who, what, when,\nwhere, why, the big five questions.\n\n304\n00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,040\nExcept the when and where is gonna\nvary from project to project.\n\n305\n00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,276\nSo our general statements are gonna be\nmore of a who, what and why kind of thing.\n\n306\n00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:34,550\nAnd then it goes on with other\ndocuments that we're going to need.\n\n307\n00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,165\nHow do we create our\nwork breakdown structure?\n\n308\n00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:39,735\n[LAUGH] Our WBS structure,\nour work breakdown structure structure.\n\n309\n00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:42,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How do we create a work breakdown\n\n310\n00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,950\nstructure dictionary and\nwhat should be in it?\n\n311\n00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,010\nHow do we do scope baseline maintenance?\n\n312\n00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,700\nIn other words,\nhow do we handle changes to the scope?\n\n313\n00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,920\nWhat defines the methods that allow for\ndeliverable acceptance?\n\n314\n00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,810\nIf I say the project is done, I'm done!\n\n315\n00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,935\nThat means I've finished something.\n\n316\n00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:02,662\nI need to give it to the sponsor to say,\nhere's what you asked for.\n\n317\n00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,278\nIt's done.\n\n318\n00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,678\nWell, what are the criteria for\nthem to accept it?\n\n319\n00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:09,060\nCuz they might say, no, it's not done.\n\n320\n00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,740\nThat's now what I wanted.\n\n321\n00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,300\nAnd now you're left saying, well, I think\nwe're done, you don't think we're done.\n\n322\n00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,800\nWhat do we do?\n\n323\n00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,370\nNow we've got conflict, right?\n\n324\n00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,600\nSo we would need to define what it is\nthat means this project is actually done.\n\n325\n00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,680\nAnd then scope and\nrequirements integration.\n\n326\n00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,510\nScope and requirements, we'll see this in\na later episode, are very, very similar.\n\n327\n00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,860\nSo do we just merge them?\n\n328\n00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,110\nAnd have it where the scope\nis the set of requirements?\n\n329\n00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,480\nWell, that's not always possible.\n\n330\n00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,370\nEspecially in software development\nwhere we might have a ton of little\n\n331\n00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,450\ntiny very specific requirements.\n\n332\n00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,320\nSo we break them down into pieces and\nso now, how do we tie those together?\n\n333\n00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,720\nHow are they integrated when I measure\nacceptance, am I measuring it just to get\n\n334\n00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,640\ninto the scope, or the scope and the\nrequirements, or just the requirements?\n\n335\n00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,920\nWhat am I looking at?\n\n336\n00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,150\nWe define that here,\nsaying here's how we're gonna manage it.\n\n337\n00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,610\nHere's how we make that decision, right?\n\n338\n00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,890\nWe're not actually putting the scope\nin here, we're not actually putting\n\n339\n00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,820\nthe requirements in here, we're saying,\nhow do we manage the scope?\n\n340\n00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,110\nHow do we manage the requirements?\n\n341\n00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,540\nThat's what these plans are all about.\n\n342\n00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,958\nAnd the key thing to remember\nis to keep them generic.\n\n343\n00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:18,520\nBecause once you've develop them one time,\nyou can reuse them over and\n\n344\n00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,340\nover and\nover again in all of your other projects.\n\n345\n00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,840\nYou might have to make\nminor tweaks to deal\n\n346\n00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,710\nwith uniqueness on a particular project.\n\n347\n00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,030\nBut for the most part, you'll find where\nyou can reuse this stuff over and over.\n\n348\n00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,580\nAnd it's very, very handy.\n\n349\n00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,280\nAnd that's where these templates\nare kind of convenient.\n\n350\n00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,760\nThat's why I wanted to make\nsure that you guys have those.\n\n351\n00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,080\nThere's a ton of them.\n\n352\n00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,250\nRight?\nLet's get these.\n\n353\n00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,020\nSee if I can pull this up side by side.\n\n354\n00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,400\nSee if my navigation skills\nare up to snuff here.\n\n355\n00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,220\nSo we've got the scope management plan,\nrequirements management plan.\n\n356\n00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,800\nAnd so that's the next one here,\nrequirements management plan.\n\n357\n00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,120\nAnd we'll see the same thing.\n\n358\n00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,380\nHow do we collect the requirements?\n\n359\n00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,250\nDo we talk to the sponsor on the phone?\n\n360\n00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,640\nDo we bring in a subject matter expert for\na second opinion?\n\n361\n00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,400\nYou get that a lot, right?\n\n362\n00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,900\n>> Yeah.\n\n363\n00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:11,130\n>> We were using the arcade game,\narcade cabinet example last episode.\n\n364\n00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,700\nNate says, I want an arcade cabinet, but\n\n365\n00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,930\nhe's not an expert in\nmaking arcade cabinets.\n\n366\n00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,555\nSo his requirements maybe\nleaving some things out.\n\n367\n00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:22,155\nSome of them might be non realistic,\nI don't really know.\n\n368\n00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:23,945\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, in my collection,\n\n369\n00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:27,255\nI might have a statement that says,\nstep one,\n\n370\n00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:32,175\nget a list of what the customer wants,\nor what the originator sponsor was.\n\n371\n00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:35,765\nStep two,\nbounce that off of subject matter expert\n\n372\n00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:40,660\nto verify whether that's complete,\nor if we need more information.\n\n373\n00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,130\nAnd you see this in web\ndevelopment all the time.\n\n374\n00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,570\nSomebody says I want a website.\n\n375\n00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,910\nAnd then they want menus\nthat look nice and\n\n376\n00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,800\nthey want a form to be\nable to submit email.\n\n377\n00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,063\nAnd then that's their requirement, and\nthen you show it to the web developer and\n\n378\n00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:55,370\nthe web developer says, okay,\nwe can kick out an email.\n\n379\n00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,390\nDo you want the email to be plain text or\ndo you want it to be HTML?\n\n380\n00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,760\nDo you want the email to be formatted?\n\n381\n00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,010\nDo you want your logo in there,\ndoes it matter?\n\n382\n00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,940\nDoes the website need to be responsive\nto mobile device screen sizes or\n\n383\n00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,730\nshould it be fixed width?\n\n384\n00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,820\nAll these questions come up, right?\n\n385\n00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,620\nWell, we need those answers before\nwe sign off on this project and\n\n386\n00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,530\nstart moving forward with work.\n\n387\n00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,230\nSo, those are requirements that the\noriginator just didn't even know about.\n\n388\n00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,050\n>> Yeah.\n>> So,\n\n389\n00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,470\nwe now need to go back to\nthe originator and ask them and\n\n390\n00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,370\nthey start to give us more details.\n\n391\n00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,730\nSo we put that in our\ncollection plan here.\n\n392\n00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,430\nHow do we collect the resources?\n\n393\n00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,950\nDo we need to go through,\nI mean the requirements.\n\n394\n00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,180\nDo we need to go through it more than once\nto make sure that we actually get it all\n\n395\n00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,095\nright, and straightforward?\n\n396\n00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:43,835\nAll right, how we're gonna handle analysis\nand categorization of the requirements?\n\n397\n00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:48,035\nAnalysis is just looking at them to\ndetermine one whether we got the right\n\n398\n00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:51,229\nsteps in place to achieve them, and\ntwo whether we've achieved them.\n\n399\n00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:53,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> Categories.\n\n400\n00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,350\nYou'll have some requirements.\n\n401\n00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,480\nI think we were talking about it before\nthe show where I said a lot of times I'll\n\n402\n00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,370\nhave primary requirements, secondary\nrequirements and optional requirements.\n\n403\n00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,670\nPrimary, those are the ones\nthat we have to achieve.\n\n404\n00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,410\nWe've got to get these done.\n\n405\n00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,360\nSecondary ones are ones that we would like\nto achieve that can change if necessary.\n\n406\n00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,880\nIf things start running behind schedule\nwe might be able to eliminate them, but\n\n407\n00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,580\nthe things that we'd like to achieve.\n\n408\n00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,810\nAnd then optional requirements are if\nthings are running perfect let's try and\n\n409\n00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,040\nget these done too.\n\n410\n00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,280\nBut if we don't,\nthey're the first things to cut.\n\n411\n00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,790\nWe're not worried about it, we can always\ndo that in version 2.0 or whatever.\n\n412\n00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,020\nSo, how do we define those categories?\n\n413\n00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,360\nAnd who makes that decision?\n\n414\n00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,250\nWho makes the decision over what's\nprimary, secondary, and optional, right?\n\n415\n00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,590\nSo we define that structure here.\n\n416\n00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,860\nNot saying in our project,\nhere's the primary requirements.\n\n417\n00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,060\nThat's not for this document.\n\n418\n00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,980\nThis is the plan.\n\n419\n00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,320\nWhat documentation is required\nwhen we collect resources?\n\n420\n00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,020\nWhat do we need to get from people, right?\n\n421\n00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,270\nDo we need to get it in writing?\n\n422\n00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,225\nIs it just a phone call?\n\n423\n00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:59,270\nCuz a phone call, man, it's hard\nto get signatures on a phone call.\n\n424\n00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,440\n>> Right.\n>> So, what documentation is necessary to\n\n425\n00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,900\ncollect requirements and\nthen have them stored and accepted?\n\n426\n00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,230\nPrioritization.\n\n427\n00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,320\nIf you've got more than one set of,\nor more than one requirement,\n\n428\n00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,480\nwhich ones are the most important,\nwhich ones are the least.\n\n429\n00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,870\nThat way we can do our\nscheduling appropriately.\n\n430\n00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,050\nFor high priority requirements,\n\n431\n00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,440\nyou might assign some extra\nresources to guarantee success.\n\n432\n00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,240\nFor low priority requirements you\nmight assign the minimum resources\n\n433\n00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,480\nknowing that if they don't succeed\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n434\n00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,960\n>> Yeah.\n>> Metrics,\n\n435\n00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,990\nhow do we measure the requirements?\n\n436\n00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,770\nA lot of requirements are really easy.\n\n437\n00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,520\nHey, I want a form on my website and\nwhen somebody hits submit,\n\n438\n00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,530\nI want it to send me an email.\n\n439\n00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,470\nWell, if I hit submit,\ndid I get an email, yes or no?\n\n440\n00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,080\nYes, it worked.\n\n441\n00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,060\nNo, it didn't.\n\n442\n00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,630\nSo a lot of metrics\nare really easy to measure.\n\n443\n00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,450\nSome are harder though.\n\n444\n00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,515\nI want my website to look modern.\n\n445\n00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:52,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay,\n\n446\n00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,990\nwell who's the judge of what looks modern,\nright?\n\n447\n00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,670\nSo that's a subjective thing.\n\n448\n00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,930\nSo we have to put in here in our plan\nthat anything that's subjective,\n\n449\n00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,320\nwe need to come up with\na way to measure it.\n\n450\n00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,720\nSo everything's got to be measurable.\n\n451\n00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,530\nSo, we say all right, for any subjective\nthing we're gonna use focus groups.\n\n452\n00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:16,833\nAnd, with the focus groups,\nwe need an opinion rate of 75% or higher.\n\n453\n00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:21,630\nSo, 75% of the polled people in\nthe focus groups say, yeah, look modern.\n\n454\n00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,550\nThen that counts, right?\n\n455\n00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,108\nAnd so how do we measure that?\n\n456\n00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:28,500\nAnd we can take things that\nare subjective, and turn them into\n\n457\n00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,040\nquantifiable numerical values that we\ncan represent and use to gauge success.\n\n458\n00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,800\nReal important that you get buy in on this\nstuff from the sponsor, because again,\n\n459\n00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,980\nit's subjective.\n\n460\n00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,880\nYou could have a website that 100% of your\nfocus group attendees say looks modern.\n\n461\n00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,970\nBut if the sponsor looks at it and\nsays, that looks like 1997.\n\n462\n00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,690\nWell, you gonna argue with the sponsor?\n\n463\n00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,760\nBut if you have it in paper,\nhere's how we measure it,\n\n464\n00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,510\nthe focus groups agree, this is modern.\n\n465\n00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,550\nThat's the kind of thing that\nyou have to worry about.\n\n466\n00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,050\nTraceability structure.\n\n467\n00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,100\nWhen we have requirements,\nrequirements get tied to other things.\n\n468\n00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,210\nThey're tied to the people that originated\nthem, that's something we wanna know.\n\n469\n00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,250\nThey're tied to the testing that verifies\nwe' met them and one requirement might be\n\n470\n00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,485\ntied to another requirement, so we need\ntraceability to keep all of this intact.\n\n471\n00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:24,295\nYou also have like billing\nthat you need to track too,\n\n472\n00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:28,465\nlike you're having to pay different people\nto create these various requirements,\n\n473\n00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,735\nto create the deliverable\nfrom the requirement, and\n\n474\n00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:35,035\nso where is that getting billed, code of\naccounting and all of that good stuff.\n\n475\n00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:36,870\nWe need to keep track of that, so.\n\n476\n00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:42,300\nWe define right here again how we're\ngonna track that kind of stuff,\n\n477\n00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,570\nwhich ties into tracking,and reporting.\n\n478\n00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,920\nThose are all kinda tied\nright together right there.\n\n479\n00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,440\nTractability, tracking, and reporting.\n\n480\n00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,690\nTraceability and tracking, keeping\na record of how all this ties together.\n\n481\n00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,490\nAnd the reporting, how we're gonna\noutput information about it.\n\n482\n00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:02,156\nSo, when a requirement is met,\nwe know that because we've got our.\n\n483\n00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:03,875\nTracking and traceability.\n\n484\n00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,174\nAnd then how do we report on that, right?\n\n485\n00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:10,100\nAre we going to be sending emails,\nand so on.\n\n486\n00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,370\nWhat tools are available for\nus for reporting?\n\n487\n00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,280\nCuz, you'll find in high\nsecurity environments,\n\n488\n00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,400\nthere's some tools that\nare not available to you.\n\n489\n00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,693\nIf it's a medical project and you're\ntransmitting medical records, standard\n\n490\n00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:27,190\nemail is not a tool that's available, and\nso we would define that under reporting.\n\n491\n00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,820\nValidation, right?\n\n492\n00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,960\nWe say we've met the requirement,\nhow do we validate it?\n\n493\n00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,060\nSo, again, the tools and techniques and\nstuff that's available to us for\n\n494\n00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,280\nvalidating that.\n\n495\n00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> And lastly, configuration management.\n\n496\n00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> I love how they just stick this in here\n\n497\n00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,850\nas a single entry.\n\n498\n00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,120\nWe're gonna talk a lot more about that.\n\n499\n00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,090\nConfiguration and change management\nare two really important things.\n\n500\n00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,680\nIf they are not properly followed, they\ncan scuttle an entire project really easy.\n\n501\n00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,270\nSo you definitely want to make\nsure you implement those properly.\n\n502\n00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,318\nAnd so we'll spend some time on it later.\n\n503\n00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:01,450\nThey've just got a little blurb here, and\n\n504\n00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:06,190\nthat's because they are actually talking\nabout change of the requirements.\n\n505\n00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,260\nBut we're gonna take a look at change\nlater on, in terms of the entire project,\n\n506\n00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,960\nand how it is an extremely\nimportant thing.\n\n507\n00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,244\nHere is just a little blurb,\nbut we will have more.\n\n508\n00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:19,890\nAll right.\n\n509\n00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,600\nSome of the other plans, I don't wanna\nbore us to just go into each one of these,\n\n510\n00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,440\nespecially since we haven't done our\nhuman resources management episode yet\n\n511\n00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,030\nand stuff like that where we'll\nreally start to understand that plan.\n\n512\n00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,720\nBut just taking a look at another one,\nthis is a good one here.\n\n513\n00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,980\nYour risk management plan, right?\n\n514\n00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,660\nFor me, I am an IT guy, right?\n\n515\n00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,030\nI've managed IT projects, I understand\ntechnology, I understand people and\n\n516\n00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,770\nhow to get them to work.\n\n517\n00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:52,540\nI am not a risk manager, so when it comes\nto quantifying risk I can ballpark it.\n\n518\n00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,010\nI can come up with ideas of likelihood and\nstuff.\n\n519\n00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:00,540\nBut it's not founded on generally\naccepted principles, and stuff like that.\n\n520\n00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,840\nSo, a risk management plan is going to\ndefine exactly how we go about that.\n\n521\n00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,830\nSo, let me pull that one up.\n\n522\n00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,240\nHere we go.\n\n523\n00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,520\nSo, it starts off by\ndefining a methodology.\n\n524\n00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,220\nWhat is the accepted\nmethodology in your company for\n\n525\n00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,660\nidentifying the risk,\nquantifying them, and\n\n526\n00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,470\nthen setting up the necessary measures\nto insulate us from the risk, right?\n\n527\n00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,860\nSo this is what our company\ndoes in regards to risk.\n\n528\n00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,650\nAll right.\n\n529\n00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,205\nThen the roles in responsibility,\nwho is it that's gonna deal with this?\n\n530\n00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:30,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And for\n\n531\n00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,050\nme, I've usually had a risk manager,\neither on my staff or\n\n532\n00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,040\nsomebody that we contracted to come in.\n\n533\n00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,210\nYou can find people all over that have\na master's degree in risk management,\n\n534\n00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,880\nand they're really knowledgeable.\n\n535\n00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,600\nAnd they know stuff that\nwill blow your mind.\n\n536\n00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well, unless you're a risk manager, and\n\n537\n00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,490\nit won't blow your mind.\n\n538\n00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,508\nBut if you're like me, it's amazing,\nsome of the stuff the know and\n\n539\n00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,750\nhow they can assign numbers to things.\n\n540\n00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's impressive.\n\n541\n00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,675\n>> Define risk.\n\n542\n00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:55,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n543\n00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,640\nThen we'll say our risk categories.\n\n544\n00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,560\nWhen we start to rank our risks,\nthe terminology is up to us.\n\n545\n00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,690\nYou might have high risk,\nlow risk, medium risk, whatever.\n\n546\n00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,220\nWhat terminology do we use?\n\n547\n00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,820\nAnd based on that terminology, how do we\nattach certain risks to that terminology?\n\n548\n00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,790\nHow do we act upon that?\n\n549\n00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,420\nRisk management funding.\n\n550\n00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,850\nIf we have to bring in contractors,\nwho pays for that?\n\n551\n00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,060\nNow, when you talk about risk analysis,\nrisk is insulating our\n\n552\n00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,910\ncompany from the potential loss\nof a project failing or whatever.\n\n553\n00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,850\nWell is that part of the project budget or\nis it part of the company's budget?\n\n554\n00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,150\nA lot of companies have their own\nrisk management to make sure projects\n\n555\n00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,600\nare successful,\ndoesn't come out of the project budget.\n\n556\n00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,115\nSo that would be defined in here.\n\n557\n00:27:42,115 --> 00:27:44,258\nContingency protocols.\n\n558\n00:27:44,258 --> 00:27:47,470\nWhat are our standard\nmethods as a backup plan?\n\n559\n00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,010\nYou'll see this most commonly\nin terms of a reserve, right?\n\n560\n00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,110\nReserves in terms of cash, or\nreserves in terms of time.\n\n561\n00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,090\nAnd I almost always see it in cash.\n\n562\n00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,110\nSo you might say that as a general\nprinciple in our company,\n\n563\n00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:05,780\nwe reserve 10% of our budget for\ninsulating for risk contingencies.\n\n564\n00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,240\nAnd so that way if we start\nto fall behind schedule,\n\n565\n00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,880\nwe've got 10% of our budget sitting there.\n\n566\n00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,219\nWe can hire more people to come in and\ntry and get back on schedule or whatever.\n\n567\n00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:18,296\nBut that would be a general policy or\nprocedure that's set up for\n\n568\n00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,588\nour organization.\n\n569\n00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:21,193\nFrequency and timing.\n\n570\n00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:25,176\nIf we're monitoring for the risk, how\noften do we need to be monitoring for it?\n\n571\n00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:28,082\nDo we need to be watching out for\nthat risk everyday,\n\n572\n00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:31,129\nonce a month,\nis it based on the length of the project?\n\n573\n00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:33,749\nHow do we determine that frequency and\ntiming?\n\n574\n00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,660\nA lot of this other stuff\nis pretty common sense.\n\n575\n00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,002\nStakeholder risk tolerances.\n\n576\n00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:42,000\nWe're gonna talk about all this\nagain in the risk episode.\n\n577\n00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,850\nBut you'll see down here,\n\n578\n00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,160\nwhat I was talking about earlier,\ndefinitions of probability.\n\n579\n00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,820\nWhen I say something is a very high risk,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n580\n00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,890\nI don't know.\n\n581\n00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,570\nWell, it might mean that there's an 80%\nchance or higher that it's going to occur.\n\n582\n00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,690\nAll right?\nWell my company as a whole needs to define\n\n583\n00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,102\nthis word so that when I say something is\na very high risk, and when Ronnie says\n\n584\n00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:05,660\nsomething is a very high risk-\n>> We know what we're talking about.\n\n585\n00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,410\n>> Yeah, we mean the same thing.\n\n586\n00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,510\nWe need context.\n\n587\n00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,470\nCuz to me high risk,\nI might be a risk seeker.\n\n588\n00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,005\n>> Right.\n>> So high risk to me is like\n\n589\n00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:13,773\n90% or higher.\n\n590\n00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:15,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n591\n00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:20,330\nBut Ronnie might be risk averse, so 40% or\nhigher might be very high risk to him.\n\n592\n00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,190\nSo our company needs to define a standard,\nand\n\n593\n00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,680\nthat goes right here in\nour risk management plan.\n\n594\n00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,670\nVery high risk is 80% or\ngreater chance of occurence, and\n\n595\n00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,420\nyou go down the line\nassigning what that is.\n\n596\n00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,330\nVery low risk, 5% or lower, or\nwhatever we consider to be low.\n\n597\n00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,410\nWe define each one of those and\nwhat they mean.\n\n598\n00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,440\nSo that measure and then what they mean.\n\n599\n00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,910\nSo you specify that right in here.\n\n600\n00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,590\nIt's a definition.\n\n601\n00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,030\nAnd then the definition\nof impact by objective.\n\n602\n00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,810\nSo we're saying,\n\n603\n00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,370\nall right, if something is very high risk,\nhow do I define its impact?\n\n604\n00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,090\nHow much damage could\nit do to our project?\n\n605\n00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,860\nAnd how much damage could it do\nat each of these areas, right?\n\n606\n00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,240\nDamage to cost, damage to scope,\ndamage to quality or time.\n\n607\n00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,430\nWhen something is a very high risk,\n\n608\n00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,920\nsomething very high risk with the scope,\nthat could be a big deal.\n\n609\n00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,260\nVery hard to correct.\n\n610\n00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,180\nBut something very high risk with quality,\nthat can be overcome.\n\n611\n00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,250\nIf we are manufacturing something and\n\n612\n00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,650\nit's got a flaw in it,\nwe can correct the flaw and move on.\n\n613\n00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:30,080\nSo something is very high risk might\nnot have a giant impact on quality,\n\n614\n00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,620\nbut it might have a giant impact on scope,\nor time, or cost, right?\n\n615\n00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,130\nSome organizations don't\ndo these separate.\n\n616\n00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:42,100\nThey merge scope and quality together cuz\ntechnically your scope has requirements,\n\n617\n00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,750\nyour requirements determine your quality,\nso those kinda get tied together.\n\n618\n00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,770\nIt's up to your organization.\n\n619\n00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,450\nRemember, all of this is customizable.\n\n620\n00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,640\nAll right.\n\n621\n00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,250\nSo, we take all of these\ndifferent things and\n\n622\n00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,870\nwe're gonna put them together\ninto this overall project plan.\n\n623\n00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,390\nSo I want to talk more about that,\nbut we're right up on our break time.\n\n624\n00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,950\nSo why don't we do this, why don't we stop\nand take a break, and when we get back\n\n625\n00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,770\nwe're gonna talk a little bit more about\nthis overall project management plan.\n\n626\n00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,380\nAnd then this is gonna be a short episode\nso we'll probably wrap up after that.\n\n627\n00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,760\nSo stay tuned.\n\n628\n00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,492\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n629\n00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:16,499\n[MUSIC]\n\n630\n00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:23,770\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n631\n00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,660\nSo, before the break we were talking about\nthe project management plan in general.\n\n632\n00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,970\nWe kind of looked at some of\nthe different components in it.\n\n633\n00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,030\nLike I said, I've got templates for\nevery single one.\n\n634\n00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,820\nI just don't wanna dive too\ndeep into each of them, because\n\n635\n00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,980\nwe're gonna address each one individually\nas we get to the risk section or\n\n636\n00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,260\nthe cost section, the schedule, and so on.\n\n637\n00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,220\nSo we'll take a look at those\nplans as we move forward.\n\n638\n00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,520\nBut let's take a look at the develop\na project management plan\n\n639\n00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,110\nprocess as a whole here.\n\n640\n00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,140\nSo I've got one of my\nhandy-dandy drawings fired up.\n\n641\n00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,268\nThere we go.\nAnd I don't think I've mentioned it yet\n\n642\n00:31:57,268 --> 00:31:59,304\nbut I did these drawings just.\n\n643\n00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:00,801\nBecause I like them.\n\n644\n00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:04,913\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you find them\n\n645\n00:32:04,913 --> 00:32:10,340\nall through the PMBOK, except the way\nthey do them is a little more dry.\n\n646\n00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,660\nIf we just skim through and see.\n\n647\n00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,210\nYeah.\n\n648\n00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,550\nSo a little bit more dry.\n\n649\n00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,840\nBut basically,\n\n650\n00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,200\nit's just representing everything you need\nto know about that particular process.\n\n651\n00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,960\nSo, I love these diagrams.\n\n652\n00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,770\nBecause if you're studying,\n\n653\n00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,240\nthis really does point you in the right\ndirection to find out what you need.\n\n654\n00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,790\nIf you're comfortable with every\nsingle entry in these lists,\n\n655\n00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,120\nif you know all about the inputs,\ntools and techniques and\n\n656\n00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,640\nthe outputs, then you know everything\nyou need to know about that process.\n\n657\n00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,530\nThat's why I keep going back\nto these diagrams right here.\n\n658\n00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,010\nI just like them.\n\n659\n00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,298\nSo, on the input side,\nwe already talked about this a little bit,\n\n660\n00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:49,121\nthe Project Charter may well be the only\ndocument that we have in hand at this\n\n661\n00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:50,898\nstage in the game, right?\n\n662\n00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:54,704\nSo in the last episode we came\nup with a project charter for\n\n663\n00:32:54,704 --> 00:32:59,160\nour ITProTV arcade cabinet project and\nNate and I signed off on it.\n\n664\n00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,400\nSo we've got this signed Project Charter.\n\n665\n00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,790\nWe did do a couple other documents\nas a part of that, so we'll see,\n\n666\n00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:13,540\nwe did a stay colder analysis matrix and\nwe did a stay colder register.\n\n667\n00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,410\nNow those service inputs here too but\n\n668\n00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,639\nthey don't have a lot of value\nin terms of making a plan right?\n\n669\n00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,860\nMaybe a little bit, but not much.\n\n670\n00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,360\nSo not everything is a great input for\n\n671\n00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,290\nthis one even though it says\nOutput from Other Processes.\n\n672\n00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,990\nAnd they're really just referring to\nthe other planning processes that,\n\n673\n00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,910\nif I go back here,\nall these various planning processes have.\n\n674\n00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,170\nPlan Scope Management,\nPlan Schedule Management and so on.\n\n675\n00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:46,410\nNow there are 47 different processes\nspread across this chart and\n\n676\n00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:51,970\ngoing down this line of planning, every\nsingle one of them has a Plan Statement\n\n677\n00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:55,660\nin them, Plan Stakeholder Management,\nPlan Procurement Management and so on.\n\n678\n00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,930\nIf your company has a very well defined\nProject Management Plan already\n\n679\n00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,860\nin place then you pretty much get to\nskip all these ones that say plan.\n\n680\n00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,520\nPlan Schedule Management,\nPlan Cost Management.\n\n681\n00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,280\nYou still have to do all these other ones,\nright?\n\n682\n00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,080\nDefine activities and so on.\n\n683\n00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,570\nBut the ones that are talking\nabout Planning Management,\n\n684\n00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,170\nthose will already be done as a part\nof your Project Management Plan.\n\n685\n00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,580\nSo there's ten processes right there\nthat you don't have to worry about.\n\n686\n00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,780\nSo, you go from 47 down to 37.\n\n687\n00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,740\nSo this giant, complex model starts\ngetting smaller and smaller.\n\n688\n00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,870\nNot to mention that there's certain\naspects that might not apply to you.\n\n689\n00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,970\nSo, Cost Management, maybe that's handled\nentirely by your accounting department and\n\n690\n00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,150\nyou're not actually allowed to manage\nthat so then here's four more processes\n\n691\n00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,400\nblew out the door,\nI guess three if you don't count planning.\n\n692\n00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,377\nSo you start whittling this down to\na much more manageable number, all right?\n\n693\n00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:52,280\nBut going back to this, once we get\nour data together, we then apply\n\n694\n00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,390\nsome Tools and Techniques to it, Expert\nJudgment, what's in your brain, right?\n\n695\n00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:02,220\nWe look at the plan and we say does\nthe plan meet the needs of our project,\n\n696\n00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,260\nor does our project have\nsomething unique in it\n\n697\n00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,800\nthat this overall plan doesn't address,\nright?\n\n698\n00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,570\nFor example,\n\n699\n00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,860\nall the documents I showed you were from\nthe perspective of having one project.\n\n700\n00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,100\nWhat if your project has subprojects?\n\n701\n00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,720\nIf you've got subprojects,\nyou're gonna need\n\n702\n00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,080\nto add to this management plan about\nhow you manage those subprojects, and\n\n703\n00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,940\nthe subproject managers that\nare attached to them, and so on.\n\n704\n00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,910\nSo it adds a little more complexity.\n\n705\n00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,590\nYou might need to customize the management\nplan to get it the right way for\n\n706\n00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,440\nyour project, all right?\n\n707\n00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,700\nAnd then we've got\nFacilitation Techniques.\n\n708\n00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,720\nAnd we talked briefly about that in\nanother episode but to go a little\n\n709\n00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,070\nmore in depth on it, we'll go way in\ndepth on in the human resources section,\n\n710\n00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,320\nbut just to go a little more in depth,\nthis is made up of several things.\n\n711\n00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,350\nI think we've talked about brainstorming,\nright?\n\n712\n00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,610\nAnd mind mapping, how we can start\nto just gather data together.\n\n713\n00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,710\nWell, you might get the other project\nmanagers together or your project\n\n714\n00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,340\nmanagement team and say, okay,\nlet's all think of what we need to do or\n\n715\n00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,170\nwhat we need to address as far\nas our project management plan.\n\n716\n00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,330\nWe start to take all those templates\nthat I showed you and fill them out.\n\n717\n00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,220\nAnd so you might have different\npeople filling out different plans\n\n718\n00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,770\nbased on their job roles.\n\n719\n00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,920\nAnd so we're creating that plan,\n\n720\n00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,290\ngetting the right people\nworking on the right things.\n\n721\n00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,360\nOther things we have in there,\nconflict resolution.\n\n722\n00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,500\nWhen two people disagree,\nwe've got to find some resolution to that,\n\n723\n00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,030\nand a lot of it's common\nsense resolving a conflict.\n\n724\n00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,290\nBut we'll see in the human resources\nsection that there's actually\n\n725\n00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,560\nfive prescribed methods for resolving\na conflict that we need to know for\n\n726\n00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,630\nthe exam.\n\n727\n00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,140\nAnd so we'll take a look at those\nlater on, definitely be aware of that.\n\n728\n00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,330\nWe've got problem solving.\n\n729\n00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:43,440\nProblem solving is just\nkind of what's up here.\n\n730\n00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,820\nYou've got an issue, you need to first\noff recognize that you have the issue.\n\n731\n00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,700\n>> Right.\n>> It's,\n\n732\n00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,300\nwhat is it\n>> Step one to knowing you have a problem\n\n733\n00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,800\nis knowing you have the problem.\n\n734\n00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,240\nI think that's alcoholism.\n\n735\n00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,260\nBut anyhow, same thing, right?\n\n736\n00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,870\nSo, step one we identify it and\n\n737\n00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,530\nthen step two we figure out whether\nit's something that we can solve or not.\n\n738\n00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,950\nYou need to, this is Tim,\none of the gentlemen that we work with,\n\n739\n00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:08,950\nhe has a saying, which is,\nyou don't know what you don't know, right?\n\n740\n00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,770\nSo we need to recognize when we\njust don't know something and\n\n741\n00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,740\nwe need to bring somebody\ninto a system with it.\n\n742\n00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,980\nSo problem solving may\nnot be something we do.\n\n743\n00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,640\nWe might solve the problem by hiring\nsomebody else to solve the problem.\n\n744\n00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,980\n>> And last lastly your favorite,\nthe idea of the meeting.\n\n745\n00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,860\n>> Yep\n>> Meeting facilitation for\n\n746\n00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,400\nus is actually a very important part of it\n>> Once again,\n\n747\n00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,320\nmaking sure that the meeting moves,\nmaking sure that we actually do have\n\n748\n00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,960\naction items that are actually gonna\nbe accomplished at the end here.\n\n749\n00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,780\nThese are all goals that we\ncan actually set up here,\n\n750\n00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,990\nto help us to come up with that\noverall project plan for us as well.\n\n751\n00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,870\nAnd again,\n\n752\n00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,110\nwe may actually start assigning some of\nthe different ones to different people.\n\n753\n00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,630\n>> Yep.\n\n754\n00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n755\n00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,500\nSo that's all gonna happen there, and\n\n756\n00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,120\nthen basically we feed all\nthat information together.\n\n757\n00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,670\nWe may have to do several revisions,\n\n758\n00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,430\nthis is where the version numbers\nreally start to come in handy.\n\n759\n00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,210\nBecause I might have a cost\nmanagement plan version 1.0,\n\n760\n00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,672\nbut then we make some adjustments,\nnow it's version 1.1 and 1.2.\n\n761\n00:38:02,672 --> 00:38:05,260\nAnd when we have a meeting,\nwe need to announce that and say,\n\n762\n00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,817\nokay today we're going to be taking a look\nat cost management plan version 1.3.\n\n763\n00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:11,820\nDoes everybody have 1.3?\n\n764\n00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,590\nOh you still have 1.2,\nlet me give you the updated copy, right?\n\n765\n00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,020\nYou make sure that everybody's\nworking from the same data and\n\n766\n00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,310\nthat there all kind of in sync right,\nthat's the important part.\n\n767\n00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,080\nWhen it's all said and done.\n\n768\n00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,960\nThis is gonna get put in to your\noverall Project Management Plan.\n\n769\n00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,140\nAnd if you are a small company, your\nProject Management Plan may not exist,\n\n770\n00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,040\nyou might just be flying by the.\n\n771\n00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,760\nThey might be one page just\na high level overview.\n\n772\n00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,820\nBut if this is a high dollar project,\n\n773\n00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,030\nif this is something that's in\na very formalized environment.\n\n774\n00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,900\nYour Project Management Plan may be\ncalled a Project Management Book.\n\n775\n00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,600\nThere are companies that call it that.\n\n776\n00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,370\nAnd it may be a spiral bound book or\n\n777\n00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,690\nsomething like that that\nis 100 pages 200 pages.\n\n778\n00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:54,720\nBut it's basically saying here's how you\n\n779\n00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,400\nas a project manager need\nto act on this project.\n\n780\n00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,220\nSo they do that because if they\nhire new project managers,\n\n781\n00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,370\nhow does the new project manager\nknow how our company does business.\n\n782\n00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,800\nWell they have to learn it, and\n\n783\n00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,880\nif we want them to learn fast we've\nalready got a book that shows them.\n\n784\n00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,910\nYou give them our Project Management Plan.\n\n785\n00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,660\nWe say here is how we manage projects.\n\n786\n00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,650\nAnd in that book you have all of\nthese management plans that we're\n\n787\n00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,736\ntalking about cost,\nschedule, human resources.\n\n788\n00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:21,861\nAll that stuff to find in there.\n\n789\n00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,160\nHow we manage it.\n\n790\n00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,600\nAnd you put all your\ntemplates in that book.\n\n791\n00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,800\nHere's the templates for all the forms and\nthings that you might use.\n\n792\n00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,890\nHere's how we like to have them arranged,\nright?\n\n793\n00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,660\nAt your last company, you might have\nhad a template that you used for\n\n794\n00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,860\nscope statements, and\nit might have been great.\n\n795\n00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,850\nBut that's not the one we use.\n\n796\n00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,540\nWe use a consistent form here,\nhere's the form.\n\n797\n00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,350\nFIll it out,\nmake sure you follow our method, right?\n\n798\n00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:47,450\nConsistency across projects makes\nmonitoring and governance so\n\n799\n00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,300\nmuch easier, right?\n\n800\n00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,130\nSo much more possible, all right.\n\n801\n00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,684\nSo that's an important thing, this gets\nput together and you have the generic\n\n802\n00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:58,895\nplan that's a part of your company's\norganizational process assets.\n\n803\n00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:02,800\nBut you may also have to create\na custom one just for your project,\n\n804\n00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,650\nif it's different.\n\n805\n00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,480\nIf that's the case,\nthen you gotta do that.\n\n806\n00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,710\nYou gotta revise it.\n\n807\n00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,850\nMake sure it meets your needs.\n\n808\n00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:13,040\nIf it's some kind of improvement, maybe\nyou push that improvement to the general\n\n809\n00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,930\nplan that applies to your company but\nif its just for this\n\n810\n00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:20,080\nproject you modify there and it becomes\npart of your project modifications.\n\n811\n00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,930\nWhen you rap up this project,\nat the end when everything is done.\n\n812\n00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,380\nWe're gonna put together\nour project archive.\n\n813\n00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,570\nIt's a collection of all the data\nthat we generated during our project.\n\n814\n00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:35,960\nAnd this project management plan should\nbe one of the very first things in there.\n\n815\n00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,600\nIt's not going to be the first but,\nyou know charter's there.\n\n816\n00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,310\nBut it's going to be one of the first\nthings because we use that to gauge\n\n817\n00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,830\nwhether we followed the plan\nthroughout the project.\n\n818\n00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,430\nAnd when there's a failure.\n\n819\n00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:52,050\nA lot of times you can trace that\nfailure back to not following the plan.\n\n820\n00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,960\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know?\n\n821\n00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,030\nThe proper form wasn't submitted\nwith the proper information.\n\n822\n00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:01,140\nWell in the plan, it defined what form to\nuse and what information to put on there.\n\n823\n00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,170\nWe just didn't do it.\n\n824\n00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> So there's where our failure started.\n\n825\n00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,620\nSo definitely important stuff.\n\n826\n00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,590\nAll part of that project management plan.\n\n827\n00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:14,010\nAll right, well, once we've got that\nin place, or if we've already got it,\n\n828\n00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,700\nwe've been given it by our company.\n\n829\n00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,780\nNow we're ready to get to work.\n\n830\n00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,450\nNow, if you've already got it for your\ncompany, you're done, you're in business.\n\n831\n00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,720\nIf you have to create it yourself, you\nprobably haven't created it at this point.\n\n832\n00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,210\nRight?\nWe have an idea now.\n\n833\n00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,370\nWe have a collection of templates.\n\n834\n00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,300\nThat's great.\n\n835\n00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,030\nBut now we got a lot of work ahead of us.\n\n836\n00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:33,150\nSo what we're gonna do is in the upcoming\nepisodes we're gonna move through\n\n837\n00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,000\neach of our areas.\n\n838\n00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,510\nLike the next one that we're gonna\nhit is what is a scope management?\n\n839\n00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,170\n>> Scope Management\n>> So when we get in scope management\n\n840\n00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,920\nwe gonna talk about how we graph\nour scope what are we looking for,\n\n841\n00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,580\nwhat goes in there,\nhow we manage the scope and all that.\n\n842\n00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,700\nAnd we talk about that scope\nmanagement plan what goes in and\n\n843\n00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,970\nhow we manage the scope.\n\n844\n00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,480\nAnd so we'll kind of create\nthat as we go along the way.\n\n845\n00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,530\nAnd then that all gets gathered\ntogether in to this overall\n\n846\n00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,090\nproject management plan.\n\n847\n00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,620\nJust keep in mind,\nit doesn't have to be crazy complex.\n\n848\n00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,436\nDoesn't have to have\na million words in it.\n\n849\n00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,770\nThe more simple it.\n\n850\n00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:07,540\nThe easier it is to follow, the more words\nyou get in, it becomes really complex\n\n851\n00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,780\nlike, there' s a story I always heard\nwas the United States tax code.\n\n852\n00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,060\nDid you know that in the very first\ndraft of the United States tax code\n\n853\n00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,740\nit was seven pages long.\n\n854\n00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,740\nSeven pages.\n\n855\n00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,930\nSo any citizen could sit down and\n\n856\n00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:26,110\nread seven pages and understand how\ntaxes work and pay their taxes.\n\n857\n00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,820\nRight?\n\n858\n00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,090\nToday, they have what's\ncalled the IRS Tax Library.\n\n859\n00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,400\nIt's an actual library.\n\n860\n00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,980\nIt's got thousands of volumes\nof not just the tax law, but\n\n861\n00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,970\nthe case law,\nwhich is interpretations of the law.\n\n862\n00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:39,480\n>> Right.\n\n863\n00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,680\n>> And\nnobody understands how it works anymore.\n\n864\n00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,690\nAnd you have to hire an accountant\njust to file your taxes.\n\n865\n00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,170\nSo, it's kind of gotten out of hand.\n\n866\n00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,690\nWell, that's how your project\nmanagement plan can get also.\n\n867\n00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,040\nThe more simple it is, the easier it\nis for project managers to follow it.\n\n868\n00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,350\nThe more complex it becomes.\n\n869\n00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:58,000\nNow the project manager needs an assistant\nwho's spending their time just tracking\n\n870\n00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,590\nproject management plan and\nmaking sure it's being followed.\n\n871\n00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:04,210\nVersus what the project manager's doing\nwhich is hopefully managing the project.\n\n872\n00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,350\nManaging the people and\ngetting things moving.\n\n873\n00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,520\nSo, it becomes very,\n\n874\n00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,660\nvery challenging when you have a really\ncomplex project management plan.\n\n875\n00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,670\n>> Yeah, sometimes you actually\nhave to remember, right?\n\n876\n00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,280\nIf you're new to this,\nif you're going, hey,\n\n877\n00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,500\nI wanna take an interest in this, is\nremember that the plans that we're talking\n\n878\n00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,080\nabout are not actually talking\nabout the actions that we're doing.\n\n879\n00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,990\nThey're really talking about how\nwe're gonna manage those things that\n\n880\n00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,770\nare coming up.\n\n881\n00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:28,550\nSo keep that in mind as we start\nmoving through the next episodes here\n\n882\n00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,430\nin terms of what we're actually doing.\n\n883\n00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,160\nWe're actually talking\n\n884\n00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,360\nabout how we actually manage all\nthe stuff that needs to be done.\n\n885\n00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,290\n>> All right.\n\n886\n00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,850\nWell Rodney, why don't we wrap it up here.\n\n887\n00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,460\nIf we go any further we're gonna get\ninto stuff that's gonna be covered in\n\n888\n00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,050\nother episodes.\n\n889\n00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,510\nI don't want it to too much overlap.\n\n890\n00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:44,720\nSo I think that's a pretty\ngood coverage of it.\n\n891\n00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,610\nLet me remind you guys if you\nhave any questions on this stuff.\n\n892\n00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,210\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and post your\n\n893\n00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,890\nquestions right in the chatroom there and\nwe

--> 00:00:38,391\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:41,391\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:42,440\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,410\n>> I am not doing well.\n\n7\n00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,662\nMy American Idol pick did not make it.\n\n8\n00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:46,601\n>> No?\n\n9\n00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:47,217\n>> No.\n\n10\n00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:49,714\n>> I don't know which is more shocking,\nthe fact that they didn't make it or\n\n11\n00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:51,221\nthe fact that you had\nan American Idol pick.\n\n12\n00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,101\n>> I did in 1997.\n\n13\n00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:57,010\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, I don't think I can segue\n\n14\n00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,636\noff of that Ronnie,\nI think you've stumped me this time.\n\n15\n00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:05,493\n[LAUGH] Okay so in our last episode,\nwe started taking a look at project\n\n16\n00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:11,860\nmanagement planning, so setting up a plan\nfor our overall, how we run our project.\n\n17\n00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,470\nAnd one of the comments that\nwe made in the show was\n\n18\n00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,270\nyou might not be able to make\nthat plan right off the bat.\n\n19\n00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,490\nIf your company already has\nan established plan, you're good to go.\n\n20\n00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,195\nBut if not,\nyou gotta get a lot of information.\n\n21\n00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:23,306\nAnd so we may have to skip it and\n\n22\n00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:28,219\nmove on to some of our other knowledge\nareas and come back to it again.\n\n23\n00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:31,688\nAnd so that's exactly what we're\ndoing is we're moving on and\n\n24\n00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:34,500\nmoving into our project scope management.\n\n25\n00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,950\nAnd we're gonna focus right here,\njust straight up on scope 5.1 through 5.4.\n\n26\n00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,660\nAnd kinda drill into those.\n\n27\n00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:47,550\nAnd as a result one of the things that\nwe'll produce is a scope management plan.\n\n28\n00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,470\nWhich will feed right back into\nthat project management plan.\n\n29\n00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,440\nSo as we go, moving through each of\nthese areas, right, different episodes,\n\n30\n00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,600\nmoving through the areas we'll\ncreate that plan, all right?\n\n31\n00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,997\nSo right now, though, we are gonna dial\nin right here on scope management.\n\n32\n00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,922\nJust this guy, and some of\nthe different things that are there.\n\n33\n00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:07,640\nAnd now,\nthe way that it's written here is the way\n\n34\n00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,020\nthat the Project Management Institute\nkind of created these processes.\n\n35\n00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,780\nSo they're not necessarily\nin chronological order.\n\n36\n00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,270\nIf your company already has a way\nof managing the project, then sure,\n\n37\n00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,930\nthis will be first.\n\n38\n00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,070\nIt's already done.\n\n39\n00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,620\nBut if it's not, if you don't already have\nit, well, you need to skip past it and\n\n40\n00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,840\ncome back, all right?\n\n41\n00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,999\nSo, we're going to move to the logical\nfirst step, which is this guy right here,\n\n42\n00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,887\ncollect requirements, all right?\n\n43\n00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:36,574\nOne thing I mentioned,\nI think in the very first episode\n\n44\n00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:40,746\nwas that projects hinge upon success and\nfailure, all right?\n\n45\n00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:45,070\nThe success and failure really rests upon\nthe shoulders of the project manager.\n\n46\n00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,510\nIt's your job to make\nthat project a success.\n\n47\n00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,100\nAnd at the very early stages of the\nproject, you will set the gauge of that\n\n48\n00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,570\nsuccess, how you measure whether\nyour project was successful or not.\n\n49\n00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,810\nAnd at the time I think I drew\na triangle diagram, didn't I?\n\n50\n00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,640\nProject constraints.\n\n51\n00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,690\nThere we go.\n\n52\n00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,590\nAt the time I drew this diagram here.\n\n53\n00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,710\nWe can get rid of that.\n\n54\n00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,430\nAnd made the comment how we've really\ngot three things that we're balancing.\n\n55\n00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,790\nYou've got your schedule.\n\n56\n00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,530\nYou'll have some kind of deadline set\nthat says you need be done by this date.\n\n57\n00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,840\nYou gotta work against that date.\n\n58\n00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,372\nSo schedule or time.\n\n59\n00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,949\nYou'll also have budget or cost.\n\n60\n00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,696\nYou'll have a certain amount of\nmoney that you're allowed to spend,\n\n61\n00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:24,070\nthat you need to operate within.\n\n62\n00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,760\nSo, those are two of the big constraints\nthat we'll talk about in other episodes.\n\n63\n00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,874\nBut in this episode,\nwe're talking about this guy right here,\n\n64\n00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:34,248\nrequirements/scope, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:38,565\nNow, in your project, requirements and\nscope might be two separate things, or\n\n66\n00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:39,971\nthey might be one things.\n\n67\n00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,200\nWe'll talk about that in just a moment.\n\n68\n00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,620\nBut these guys right here, are really\ndefining the work you need to do.\n\n69\n00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,230\nNot how much time you have,\nnot how much money you spend, but\n\n70\n00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,800\njust what is the work you've got to do.\n\n71\n00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,450\nAnd then these other two\nserve as the boundaries for\n\n72\n00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,810\nwhat's gonna hold us\nback from achieving this.\n\n73\n00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,280\nBut having a solid understanding\nof what work you have to do,\n\n74\n00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,080\nfrom the very beginning will\nset you up for success.\n\n75\n00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,620\nToo many projects kick off\nwith a lot of gray areas,\n\n76\n00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,720\na lot of undefined information.\n\n77\n00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,590\nAnd then,\nwhen we think the project is over,\n\n78\n00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,970\nwe find out we haven't met the needs\nof the customer and there's conflict.\n\n79\n00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,660\nAnd, we think the project's done.\n\n80\n00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,100\nThey don't think it is.\n\n81\n00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,020\nNow the project continues on and\nimmediately goes over schedule,\n\n82\n00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,860\nover budget, and now you've\nreally got a problem, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,830\nSo, this is probably one of the more\nimportant things we do in planning\n\n84\n00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,090\nis just making sure that everyone's\non the same page, right?\n\n85\n00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,030\nNow, we do that with a project scope.\n\n86\n00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,300\nNow, if I take a look at here,\ncollect requirements process,\n\n87\n00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,110\nwe'll see that there's a whole bunch of\nstuff here, and it's really talking about\n\n88\n00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,340\njust requirements, so\nwhat is this scope that I'm talking about?\n\n89\n00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:03,440\nWell, this scope, it's defining in simple\nterms what our project needs to achieve.\n\n90\n00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,540\nBut our project may not be simple.\n\n91\n00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,760\nIt may be really complex.\n\n92\n00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,750\nThere may be tons of details\nthat we need to meet.\n\n93\n00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,535\nAnd so the requirements are that detailed\nbreakdown of what we need to achieve,\n\n94\n00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:16,280\nright?\n\n95\n00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,270\nYour scope may be general.\n\n96\n00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,370\nYour requirements may be very detailed.\n\n97\n00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,270\nAt the end of the project, you really\nneed to meet both of them because they\n\n98\n00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,970\ncontribute to each other and that's why I\ncombined them here, saying requirement and\n\n99\n00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,390\nscope really tie together, all right?\n\n100\n00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,470\nThink of it in terms of building a house.\n\n101\n00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,180\nI wanna buy a house and\nI want it to be four bedrooms,\n\n102\n00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,030\ntwo bath with the two car garage and\na white picket fence, right?\n\n103\n00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,240\nThose are some pretty\ngeneral terms right there.\n\n104\n00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,770\nAnd I can say I want it\ndone by December 31st and\n\n105\n00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,370\nI wanna spend less than $250,000, right?\n\n106\n00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,372\nSo there's my requirements.\n\n107\n00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:52,462\nWell, those are good.\n\n108\n00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:56,310\nThey're pretty general, but\nthere's some specific stuff too.\n\n109\n00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:56,982\nI said I wanted two bathrooms.\n\n110\n00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,573\nAre they full baths, right?\n\n111\n00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:01,850\nDo they have a bathtub and a toilet or\ndo they just have a shower?\n\n112\n00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,530\nDo they just have a toilet and that's it?\n\n113\n00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,110\nWe said four rooms,\nhow big should the rooms be?\n\n114\n00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,370\nIs there a master bedroom, guest bedrooms,\nis there an upstairs and a downstairs?\n\n115\n00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,230\nThere's a ton of other details\nwe need to know, all right?\n\n116\n00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,400\nAnd some of the details, the customer\ndoesn't specifically care about.\n\n117\n00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,450\nI don't care whether\nthe trusses are metal or wood.\n\n118\n00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,400\nThe builders can do\nwhatever they want there.\n\n119\n00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,280\nI don't see what's inside the walls,\nright?\n\n120\n00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840\nSo these types of things\nwe have to define.\n\n121\n00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,690\nThat scope statement may be too general\nto actually use as a litmus test.\n\n122\n00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,150\nTest to see whether you've succeeded.\n\n123\n00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,010\nSo you may have a very\ndetailed requirements list\n\n124\n00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,250\nthat does go into all of that, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,130\nSo often times what you'll\nsee is the scope statement\n\n126\n00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,410\nattached to the requirements list,\nthat they get combined and\n\n127\n00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,040\nwe just kinda work with them together,\nall right.\n\n128\n00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,780\nLet me show you guys a template\nthat I made for the oh,\n\n129\n00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,843\nI don't have my scope statement, shoot.\n\n130\n00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:06,045\nWell we'll talk about it later.\n\n131\n00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:09,527\nAll right, so the scope statement,\nit really is pretty simple.\n\n132\n00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:13,310\nThe scope statement document you really\njust specify in a paragraph just in\n\n133\n00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,923\na conversational way of writing what\nyour project is going to achieve.\n\n134\n00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:19,661\nAnd if you go back to\nyour project charter,\n\n135\n00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:24,685\nremember we drafted a project charter for\nour little arcade cabinet charter,\n\n136\n00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:27,591\nand in here I put high-level requirements.\n\n137\n00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:32,950\nThose high-level requirements kind\nof become this scope statement.\n\n138\n00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,800\nAnd if they'll fit right here\nin one little box like this,\n\n139\n00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,740\nif this is everything that I need\nI may just take my charter and\n\n140\n00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,170\nturn that into my scope statement and\nrun with it.\n\n141\n00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,490\nThe scope of the project is\nwhat work we're going to do.\n\n142\n00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,830\nBut I likely do need to get more detailed.\n\n143\n00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,160\nIn software development projects\nyou absolutely need to get very,\n\n144\n00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,200\nvery detailed on here.\n\n145\n00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,648\nSo that you have specific boundaries\nas to what you're going to achieve.\n\n146\n00:07:55,648 --> 00:08:01,333\nIf you don't, what happens is, it's\ninvariable, just as your project goes on,\n\n147\n00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:06,305\nthe sponsor will throw out suggestions,\nChanges, recommendations.\n\n148\n00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:09,302\nOh, I said this but\nwhat I really meant was,\n\n149\n00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:12,380\nI said that I wanted every\nroom to have a door.\n\n150\n00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,310\nBut what I really want is that\ndoor to have little windows in it.\n\n151\n00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,800\nAnd things like that.\n\n152\n00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,310\nI want the doors to open out not open in\nand you've already put the doors in place.\n\n153\n00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,210\nThat kinda stuff starts to happen.\n\n154\n00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,720\nAnd you end up with what's\ncalled scope creep.\n\n155\n00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,640\nScope creep, that's the official term.\n\n156\n00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,990\nYou'll see it on the exam.\n\n157\n00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,960\nScope creep is where we start\nadding things to the scope.\n\n158\n00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,750\nWe start changing and adding things.\n\n159\n00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,100\nAnd it gets bigger and bigger and\n\n160\n00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,390\nbigger until it becomes impossible\nto meet our budget and schedule.\n\n161\n00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,630\nIt's just not possible anymore and we've\nbasically set ourselves up for failure.\n\n162\n00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,450\n>> So a lot of times you might not\nonly see the idea of what is actually\n\n163\n00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,190\ngonna be required in there.\n\n164\n00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,130\nBut you might even see somebody say look,\nlet's make sure that some of\n\n165\n00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,750\nthis stuff doesn't happen, and even\ndefine what it won't actually accomplish.\n\n166\n00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,810\nAnd that way people don't try and\nbring a lot of scope creep into it that we\n\n167\n00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,310\ncan't easily say this is not\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n168\n00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,890\n>> So what you'll find is that when you\nget into collecting the requirements,\n\n169\n00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,010\nokay, this is something you're gonna need\nto go through more than once, all right?\n\n170\n00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,416\nBecause you're gonna talk to\nthe original project sponsor and\n\n171\n00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,570\nthey're gonna give you\na list of requirements.\n\n172\n00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,392\nAnd then you're gonna take\nthose requirements and\n\n173\n00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:25,178\nyou're gonna take them to\nsubject matter expert.\n\n174\n00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:28,440\nAnd they're gonna look at them\nat come up with more questions.\n\n175\n00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,060\nAnd you're gonna have to go back\nto the sponsor and say, okay,\n\n176\n00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,590\nwe need a little more information.\n\n177\n00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,560\nAnd you start getting more and\nit starts to grow and grow and grow.\n\n178\n00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,123\nAnd you do that over and over and\n\n179\n00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:41,107\nover again until the subject matter\nexpert doesn't have anymore questions.\n\n180\n00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:44,125\nUntil they say, all right, we've got all\nthe information we need to get started.\n\n181\n00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,797\nAll right, then we're ready to rock.\n\n182\n00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:50,332\nNow, there is a little extra kind\nof thing that gets thrown in as we\n\n183\n00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,650\nidentify stakeholders.\n\n184\n00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,460\nThe stakeholders might have requirements\nalso, and if they have requirements,\n\n185\n00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,860\nthey may need to get incorporated in.\n\n186\n00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,620\nNow, at the end of the day\nthe project is the sponsor's project.\n\n187\n00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,700\nWhoever it is that lent their authority\nto the project it's their project.\n\n188\n00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,290\nSo they can override anybody else's\nrequirements that they want,\n\n189\n00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,140\nit's their project, right?\n\n190\n00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,090\nBut a lot of times the stakeholders\nwill have very valid needs.\n\n191\n00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:22,310\nSo you might have, you're getting some\nnew insurance underwriting software.\n\n192\n00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,070\nThis project is to deploy\nthe insurance underwriting software.\n\n193\n00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,820\nAnd the vice president of underwriting\nis the one who's the sponsor for\n\n194\n00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,810\nthis project.\n\n195\n00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,460\nAnd so she comes down and\nsays I want this software.\n\n196\n00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,610\nI want it deployed.\n\n197\n00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,640\nThis is gonna make underwriting, for\nus, and all new great thing, right?\n\n198\n00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,440\nWell, she's the vice president.\n\n199\n00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,730\nShe runs that department.\n\n200\n00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,510\nThere's other people in that department,\nmid-level management and so on.\n\n201\n00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,010\nAnd one of the mid-level managers might\ncome to you and say, you know what,\n\n202\n00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,450\nI think this software's great.\n\n203\n00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,243\nI really like it.\n\n204\n00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:51,868\nThe plan is good.\n\n205\n00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:52,820\nWe're gonna roll it out.\n\n206\n00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,930\nIt's wonderful.\n\n207\n00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,720\nBut I'm worried about\nmy people having enough\n\n208\n00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,020\ntraining to be able to properly\nuse the software on day one.\n\n209\n00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,410\nSo I'd like to add a requirement to\nthe project that we put in training.\n\n210\n00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,420\nThat we train these employees\nprior to the roll out, all right?\n\n211\n00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,670\nWell that came from a mid-level manager.\n\n212\n00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,260\nIt didn't come from the sponsor.\n\n213\n00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,440\nBut the sponsor will look at that and\n\n214\n00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,690\nsay, that's a valid concern,\nlet's make that a new requirement, right?\n\n215\n00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,160\nSo a new requirement is, not only do we\nroll out the software on December 1st.\n\n216\n00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,676\nBut we start training on November 1st, and\n\n217\n00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:29,240\nwe get a good month of training in before\nthe new software rolls out, all right?\n\n218\n00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,752\nThe thing here is, when other\npeople start adding requirements,\n\n219\n00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:34,580\nthe sponsor needs to be involved.\n\n220\n00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,710\nThe project manager needs to be involved.\n\n221\n00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:42,560\nWe have to all be in agreement to add\nsomething in otherwise we get scope creep.\n\n222\n00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,130\nAnd we're gonna talk about change\nmanagement in another episode cuz it is\n\n223\n00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,280\nvery important.\n\n224\n00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,875\nChanges to the scope are the most\ndangerous because they're changing\n\n225\n00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,865\nthe success and\nfailure criteria of your project, right?\n\n226\n00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:55,495\nSo, we've gotta be really\ncareful with these.\n\n227\n00:11:56,745 --> 00:12:00,295\nAll right, so let's take a look at this\ncollect requirements process, all right?\n\n228\n00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:02,075\nIt starts out with a couple of inputs.\n\n229\n00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:04,680\nIf you have a scope\nmanagement plan already,\n\n230\n00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,520\nthat's an input cuz we\nneed to follow that plan.\n\n231\n00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,267\nWhatever that plan tells us to do,\nwe need to do it, all right?\n\n232\n00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,940\nAfter that, we probably already\nhave a list of requirements.\n\n233\n00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,060\nWell, I'm gonna change that.\n\n234\n00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,800\nWe definitely have a list of requirements.\n\n235\n00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320\nIt might not be a very good list.\n\n236\n00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,300\nIt's whatever was in our charter, right?\n\n237\n00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,050\nSo there's gonna be something in there.\n\n238\n00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,160\nIt may not be very well\nfleshed out though.\n\n239\n00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,980\nSo we will probably have to revisit this.\n\n240\n00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,570\nSo we'll at least have something\nbecause we did get started.\n\n241\n00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,400\nWe'll have a stakeholder management plan,\nwell maybe.\n\n242\n00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,750\nWe haven't drafted ours yet.\n\n243\n00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,850\nBut you might have a stakeholder\nmanagement plan in place already.\n\n244\n00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,748\nIf you do, this is gonna tell you how to\nreach out to people to find out about\n\n245\n00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:45,250\nmore requirements and\n\n246\n00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,853\nhow to reach agreements on adding\nnew things into the requirements.\n\n247\n00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,014\nYour project charter.\n\n248\n00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:53,742\nI mentioned that if you don't have\na well-defined list of requirements you at\n\n249\n00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:55,630\nleast have your project charter.\n\n250\n00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,620\nAnd then lastly,\nyour stakeholder register.\n\n251\n00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,040\nThese are the people that you need to talk\nto, to find out about new requirements,\n\n252\n00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,620\nnew things that we need to put in.\n\n253\n00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,140\nAnd we drafted the stakeholder\nregistry in an earlier episode.\n\n254\n00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,720\nSo that's all the information that\nwe may or may not have already.\n\n255\n00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,980\nWe feed that in to our tools and\ntechniques,\n\n256\n00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,010\nand this is probably one of\nthe largest ones in the entire PMBOK.\n\n257\n00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,000\nThere are a ton of techniques for\n\n258\n00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,843\ngathering information about\nour requirements, all right?\n\n259\n00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:28,437\nBut just in general for right now,\neach of these are a different way\n\n260\n00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:32,226\nof finding out what\nrequirements we've got, right?\n\n261\n00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:35,430\nOnce we've got it all hammered out,\nwe document them.\n\n262\n00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,170\nSo we have requirements documentation.\n\n263\n00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,490\nWe document each requirement and\nwhat they mean.\n\n264\n00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,100\nWe put them in no uncertain words, right,\n\n265\n00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,010\nyou do not want subjective things\nin your requirements list.\n\n266\n00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:50,100\nThese need to be measurable things that we\ncan tell if we've succeeded with or not.\n\n267\n00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,420\nAll right, and we also create\na requirements traceability matrix.\n\n268\n00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,510\nWho was it that introduced this\nrequirement, we need to know that, right?\n\n269\n00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,110\nWho is responsible for\nmeeting the requirement, and\n\n270\n00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,160\nthen is this requirement tied to somebody,\nto some other requirement, all right?\n\n271\n00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,870\nAnd I've got a requirements traceability\nmatrix template we'll look at a little\n\n272\n00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,690\nbit later.\n\n273\n00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,620\nBut this is the documentation that\nwe're trying to create, all right?\n\n274\n00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,950\nBut it might be that we create\na requirements document,\n\n275\n00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,780\nlist all the requirements and\nthen we just take it and\n\n276\n00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,760\nwe feed it right back in\nas an input again, right?\n\n277\n00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,400\nWe take it and we run it through\nall of these options again.\n\n278\n00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,240\nSo these tools and\n\n279\n00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,080\ntechniques are gonna get used multiple\ntimes as we refine our requirements list.\n\n280\n00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,370\nIf you're on a project, and\nyour requirements list is version 1.0, and\n\n281\n00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,030\nit's never been revised,\nit's like spotting a unicorn,\n\n282\n00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,340\nit's something that just doesn't happen.\n\n283\n00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,620\nSo you'll normally have a requirements\nlist that's been revised multiple times.\n\n284\n00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,810\nWell the cool thing is when\nyou're in planning, that's fine.\n\n285\n00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,440\nChanging requirements in\nplanning doesn't cost you money.\n\n286\n00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,380\nBut if you're in execution,\nif work is already being done and\n\n287\n00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,130\nyou start changing requirements,\n\n288\n00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,910\nyou might be invalidating work that was\nalready done, which is wasting money.\n\n289\n00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,680\nOr you might be adding to it\nwhich is gonna cost you money.\n\n290\n00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,510\nIt's going to affect your schedule and\nyour budget.\n\n291\n00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,220\nSo now's the time to make change.\n\n292\n00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,975\nSo be patient, run the requirements\nthrough the ringer several times,\n\n293\n00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:25,270\ncuz it's better to find out stuff\nnow than it is down the road.\n\n294\n00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n295\n00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,450\n>> All right, so let's talk about each\nof these tools and techniques, right?\n\n296\n00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,530\nFor me,\nevery project starts out the same way.\n\n297\n00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,890\nIt starts out with an interview.\n\n298\n00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,250\nWe talk to the sponsor, right?\n\n299\n00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,530\nOr if the sponsor is the originator,\nthat's who we start with.\n\n300\n00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,790\nBut if the originator is somebody else,\nthe sponsor's just giving authority, so\n\n301\n00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,790\nwe'll probably wanna go to the originator.\n\n302\n00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,410\nWe go to that person and\nwe find out what they want, right?\n\n303\n00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,954\nWe sort of already did this\nwhen we did the charter, right,\n\n304\n00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,240\ncuz they've already got a few\nrequirements that are in there.\n\n305\n00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,750\nBut now we go and we say, okay,\nin detail, be exhaustive.\n\n306\n00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,209\nGive me everything that you want,\nand be as specific as you can,\n\n307\n00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:08,620\nevery aspect of what you want As\na part of this project, right?\n\n308\n00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,558\nAnd you'll create a list and\nhopefully it's a big one.\n\n309\n00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:15,282\nThe bigger the list is,\nthe more accurate it is, right?\n\n310\n00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:17,240\nIf it's a really short list.\n\n311\n00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,602\nI wanna build a new car that\ngets 54 miles to the gallon,\n\n312\n00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:23,360\nall right, well that sounds good.\n\n313\n00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,110\nI wanna build a car that\ngets 54 miles to the gallon.\n\n314\n00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,880\nBut how many seats does it need to have?\n\n315\n00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,410\nHow many wheels, could it be a motorcycle?\n\n316\n00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,620\nThere's so much other variables and\n\n317\n00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,907\noptions in there that it's really\nchallenging to be successful with.\n\n318\n00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:41,191\nSo in an interview you need to just\nsit down and you talk to somebody.\n\n319\n00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:44,935\nMaybe via phone, Skype,\nvideo conference, whatever, but\n\n320\n00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:49,619\nyou just sit down and you talk to them and\nyou find out what it is that they want.\n\n321\n00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,490\n>> The second tool that we have here is\nallow the idea of focus groups, right?\n\n322\n00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,270\nNow, when we start talking\nabout the idea of focus groups,\n\n323\n00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,040\nwe're really doing a little bit of\ndemographics a lot of times, or\n\n324\n00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,510\nwe're trying to group together the people\nthat have a vested interest in this, or\n\n325\n00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,902\nwe're again targeting maybe\nan age group of some sort here.\n\n326\n00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,410\nThey wanna make sure that the product\nthat we actually have is gonna\n\n327\n00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,000\nbe suited for what they want.\n\n328\n00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,210\nAnd so\nyou may actually have something like that.\n\n329\n00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,220\nOr again if you're ready to talk in\nsubject matter experts you may go hey,\n\n330\n00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,090\nI wanna just make sure that if we\nwere to present this tool to you\n\n331\n00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,030\nwhat do you think would actually happen\nwith this feature or whatever it might be.\n\n332\n00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,960\nAnd that could really help you to zoom\nin on that particular requirement that\n\n333\n00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,160\nyou may wanna present.\n\n334\n00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,490\n>> Now you see focus groups\nmore in manufacturing, right?\n\n335\n00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,800\nSo if we're gonna be manufacturing,\nor if designing a new car,\n\n336\n00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,590\nwhat did I use in the earlier episodes?\n\n337\n00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,375\n>> Ford something.\n\n338\n00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,940\n>> Oh, the Ford Focus, right, so\nwe're designing the 2016 Ford Focus.\n\n339\n00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,050\nSo already our quality\nlevel is set nice and low,\n\n340\n00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,320\nso [LAUGH] when we design that\nwe know what our CEO wants.\n\n341\n00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,980\nWe know what our head engineer wants.\n\n342\n00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,710\nThey want a car that doesn't cost as\nmuch to make but that we can sell for\n\n343\n00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,400\na lot of money, right?\n\n344\n00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,610\nWe know what they want.\n\n345\n00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,890\nBut we need to know\nwhat the people want so\n\n346\n00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,670\nthis would be a product that we can sell.\n\n347\n00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,570\nSo we have a focus group.\n\n348\n00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,850\nAnd the focus group\ndoesn't contain the CEO.\n\n349\n00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,340\nIt doesn't contain the head engineer.\n\n350\n00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,346\nIt contains people on the streets.\n\n351\n00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:11,536\nNot necessarily people who\nlive on the streets, but\n\n352\n00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:13,594\nI just mean people that\nare out there in society.\n\n353\n00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,850\n[LAUGH] It's all homeless people.\n\n354\n00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,420\nSo we get people, and\njust your average Joe,\n\n355\n00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,780\nnice statistically diverse demographics,\nright?\n\n356\n00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,320\nYou want women, men,\nmultiple races, multiple heritage,\n\n357\n00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,360\nwhatever and you present your idea, your\nkind of requirements you've got right now.\n\n358\n00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,090\nYou say, all right,\nwe're looking to build this new car.\n\n359\n00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,280\nWe're hoping it'll get 54 miles to\nthe gallon and this and that and\n\n360\n00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,000\nthese are the colors we're thinking about.\n\n361\n00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,520\nAnd you get feedback from people.\n\n362\n00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,720\nAnd you may find that some of\nyour requirements are good, but\n\n363\n00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,810\npeople don't care about them.\n\n364\n00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,890\nAnd if they don't care about them you're\nintroducing an extra cost that there's no\n\n365\n00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,000\nreal purpose for.\n\n366\n00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,850\nWe deal with this at ITProTV.\n\n367\n00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,850\nWhen we pick a new\ncertification show to do,\n\n368\n00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,492\nthere have been times where we pick\na certification and nobody cared about.\n\n369\n00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:02,460\nThey're like,\nit's nice that you're doing that but\n\n370\n00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,455\nI don't wanna get that certification.\n\n371\n00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:09,010\nSo, you have to kind of pull the people,\nfind out what they want,\n\n372\n00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,140\nfind out what aspects of that project\nare what they're really looking for so\n\n373\n00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,460\nthat you tailor your needs to it.\n\n374\n00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,100\nSo focus groups are really useful for\nthat.\n\n375\n00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,200\nSimilar to focus groups\nare facilitated workshops.\n\n376\n00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,020\nFacilitated workshops, that's where\nyou have your own staff, your people,\n\n377\n00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,040\nthe engineer, the CEO, these people,\nand you get them together,\n\n378\n00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,760\nand you start working together.\n\n379\n00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,340\nThis is where we'll start seeing\nthings like brainstorming, and well,\n\n380\n00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,760\nsome of the other stuff I know we've\ntalked about in other episodes.\n\n381\n00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,200\nBut we start communicating with them and\nfinding out the information they've got.\n\n382\n00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,790\nWhat it is that they're looking for\nand when they're all in one room,\n\n383\n00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,260\none person throwing out a requirement\nmight trigger an idea in somebody else.\n\n384\n00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,330\nOh, you know what, actually if you do that\nwe also need to do this, this and this.\n\n385\n00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,650\nMaybe it's something they want,\nmaybe it's something you have to have.\n\n386\n00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,540\nLike oh, if you want 54 miles to a gallon\nwe can not do a standard fuel engine,\n\n387\n00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,480\nwe're gonna have to do\na hybrid fuel engine and\n\n388\n00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,450\nthat kinda stuff kinda comes out\nas a part of those meetings.\n\n389\n00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,470\nSo really, really handy there.\n\n390\n00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,220\n>> The next one that we have\nhere is idea of the group\n\n391\n00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,300\ncreativity techniques that we have.\n\n392\n00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,920\nNow again, a lot of this comes\nfrom also brainstorming, right,\n\n393\n00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,958\nif we're actually just trying\nto come up with ideas.\n\n394\n00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,382\nBut there are also ways\nthat we actually go, hey,\n\n395\n00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:25,039\nthere's four different things\nthat we want to do, but\n\n396\n00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,700\nwe really need to focus in on what it is\nthat we can accomplish at this point.\n\n397\n00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,404\nAnd so along with that,\nyou may have some different techniques.\n\n398\n00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:34,212\nAnd they go in PMBOK and actually\ninscribe some different ones there.\n\n399\n00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:34,861\n>> Yeah.\n\n400\n00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:37,332\nThey start with brainstorming,\nwhich I already mentioned, right?\n\n401\n00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:39,696\nBrainstorming, you just sit around,\nyou come up with ideas,\n\n402\n00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,695\nyou throw them on the wall and\nkinda see what sticks.\n\n403\n00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:44,960\nAnd it's just a great way of getting\neverything out in the open, so\n\n404\n00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,660\npeople can see it, and\nstart to make recommendations.\n\n405\n00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,276\nThe second one they talk about\nis nominal group technique.\n\n406\n00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:56,710\nAll right, nominal group technique\nis very similar to brainstorming,\n\n407\n00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,940\nyou get a group of people\nthey throw out ideas.\n\n408\n00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,150\nThe difference is when you do\nbrainstorming everybody's equal.\n\n409\n00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,110\nYou treat everybody the same,\nno idea's a bad idea.\n\n410\n00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,950\nLet's just get them up on the board.\n\n411\n00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,690\nWe'll figure it out and\nyou kinda sort through things later.\n\n412\n00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,364\nWith nominal group technique you're\nthrowing out ideas the same way.\n\n413\n00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:19,382\nBut if the CEO throws out an idea it\ngets a little more weight, right?\n\n414\n00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:23,109\nIf the head engineer throws out and idea\nit gets a little more weight than if just\n\n415\n00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:26,553\none of the salespeople throws out\nan idea that gets a little less weight,\n\n416\n00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:27,680\nless priority.\n\n417\n00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,370\nAnd so when it comes to\nthe end of this where we're\n\n418\n00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,210\npicking out which ones are our winners,\nsome are already biased, right?\n\n419\n00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,403\nSome are already predisposed\nto being selected.\n\n420\n00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:38,872\nAnd, while a lot of companies\nsay they don't do that,\n\n421\n00:21:38,872 --> 00:21:40,546\nalmost every company does, right?\n\n422\n00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:44,495\nYou almost always give\nprecedence to your executives.\n\n423\n00:21:44,495 --> 00:21:46,856\nThey're executives for\na reason, well hopefully.\n\n424\n00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:49,375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They have a better understanding\n\n425\n00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,275\nof the marketplace.\n\n426\n00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:55,615\nWe've got ideas/mind mapping.\n\n427\n00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:56,879\nVery similar to brainstorming.\n\n428\n00:21:56,879 --> 00:22:00,255\nWith brainstorming we're just building\nup ideas not necessarily linking them\n\n429\n00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:03,315\nwith idea and\nmind mapping we link them and\n\n430\n00:22:03,315 --> 00:22:07,160\nI showed an example of that software\nthat we use, let me bring that back up.\n\n431\n00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,410\nSo that was-\n>> Mindomo.\n\n432\n00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,980\n>> Yeah, Mindomo and\nthese guys make some mind mapping software\n\n433\n00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,880\nwhich you can use for brain storming\njust for throwing ideas up on the board.\n\n434\n00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,740\nBut you can also use it for\nidea and mind mapping.\n\n435\n00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,770\nYou link them together.\n\n436\n00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,230\nSo here they've got\nconflict management styles.\n\n437\n00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,720\nThey're trying to come up with some\ndifferent ways of resolving conflict.\n\n438\n00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,010\nSo they've got competing,\navoiding, accommodating, right?\n\n439\n00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,150\nSo these different ones.\n\n440\n00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,258\nWhy is my mouse doing that?\n\n441\n00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:36,327\nOh, whatever.\n\n442\n00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:39,990\nBut, so they've got these different\nones that they're doing here,\n\n443\n00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,080\nbased on what they come up with and\nthen they start branching those out.\n\n444\n00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,780\nAll right, well, if we deal with avoiding\nthen that breaks down into strengths and\n\n445\n00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,730\nweaknesses.\n\n446\n00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,417\nAnd they have the strengths of it and\nthe weaknesses listed,\n\n447\n00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,953\nkind of branching out from there.\n\n448\n00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,791\nSo idea and mind mapping,\nsame as brainstorming,\n\n449\n00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,623\nwe just connect it all together so\nwe have more of a diagram type view.\n\n450\n00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:00,492\n>> Yeah,\na lot of times with all the stuff and\n\n451\n00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:04,020\nall the different things that can come\nup during that brainstorming session,\n\n452\n00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,760\nyou may actually do something that\nwe call affinity grouping, as well.\n\n453\n00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,940\nOnce again, everything is just listed up,\nbut then you start circling things and\n\n454\n00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,030\ngoing, all right, so these ideas\nseem to really belong together and\n\n455\n00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,090\nyou group them together.\n\n456\n00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,100\nAnd you may again actually just\nfind out that there were four or\n\n457\n00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,730\nfive things that they actually would like\nrather than what you actually had in mind.\n\n458\n00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,110\n>> I like affinity grouping,\n\n459\n00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,490\nbecause when you do it,\nif you're looking at the project as whole,\n\n460\n00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,180\nyou're gonna need to bring in your subject\nmatter experts to kinda break things down.\n\n461\n00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,080\nWell, a subject matter expert,\nif we're designing a new car, right?\n\n462\n00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,070\nIf we're coming up with a new car design,\nyou might have somebody who knows\n\n463\n00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,888\neverything there is about\nfuel efficiency and engines.\n\n464\n00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,850\nRight, but they didn't know\nanything about aesthetics and\n\n465\n00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,810\noverall body design of a vehicle.\n\n466\n00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,370\nSo you might have an arts or\n\n467\n00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,160\ndesign team that does the aesthetics,\nthe exterior body.\n\n468\n00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,639\nMeanwhile you have an engineering\nteam that's doing the engine.\n\n469\n00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,897\nThey don't need to necessarily be\nbrainstorming with each other.\n\n470\n00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:58,881\nNow there is some overlap.\n\n471\n00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,933\nSo if I have a bigger engine,\nI'm gonna need a bigger hood.\n\n472\n00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:02,753\nAnd the design is gonna have\nto accommodate for that.\n\n473\n00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:04,040\nSo you do want them to communicate.\n\n474\n00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,560\nBut when you do affinity grouping,\nyou group these objects together.\n\n475\n00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,215\nAnd you say, all right, let's get the\nengineers focused in on this one group,\n\n476\n00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,550\ncuz that's where they're an expert.\n\n477\n00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,110\nBut then we'll maybe\nhave just their manager\n\n478\n00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,180\nin the overall meeting that\ncovers the whole project.\n\n479\n00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,700\nSo affinity grouping is\nreally good at that.\n\n480\n00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,320\nLet me see if I can find a picture,\n\n481\n00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,871\nlet me just do like a Google Image\nsearch here and see if somebody posts.\n\n482\n00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:31,730\nWell actually,\nthese are pretty good right here.\n\n483\n00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,360\nThere's a bunch of post-it notes.\n\n484\n00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,899\nBut what they're doing is they're\nthrowing ideas up on the board.\n\n485\n00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:40,918\nAnd you can't really read that at all.\n\n486\n00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:45,096\nI wonder if I can find\none that's semi-legible.\n\n487\n00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:46,590\nOh, yeah.\n\n488\n00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,100\nTo a point.\n\n489\n00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,950\n>> Well yeah, it's super pixelated but see\nhow they threw up ideas onto the board and\n\n490\n00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,910\nthen they circled them to say these are\nthe areas, like the people, the job roles,\n\n491\n00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,180\nor whatever that would apply to them.\n\n492\n00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,830\nI can't really read what those say.\n\n493\n00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,090\nBut by doing that, we can start to have\npeople focus in on the areas that they\n\n494\n00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,980\nreally know what they're doing.\n\n495\n00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,962\nI don't know what's going on there so\napparently they colored their fingers.\n\n496\n00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:13,560\nBut, yeah, so\nthat's the idea behind this kind of thing.\n\n497\n00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:19,420\nWhen you're looking at a wall\nwhere you've done mind mapping,\n\n498\n00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,160\nor just brainstorming,\npeople threw up a bunch of ideas.\n\n499\n00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,580\nYou can have a lot of ideas.\n\n500\n00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,800\nIt could be a super mess.\n\n501\n00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,930\nBut when you can group them together it\nbecomes a much more manageable thing.\n\n502\n00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,900\nAnd so that's what we're looking\nat with affinity diagrams.\n\n503\n00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,870\nAll right, I believe we've got one more?\n\n504\n00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,410\n>> Yeah.\n\n505\n00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,900\n>> Yeah, the last one we've\ngot is multi-criteria decision\n\n506\n00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,510\nanalysis, all right?\n\n507\n00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,750\nWe're gonna talk about\nthis one more a lot later,\n\n508\n00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,900\ncuz it's important in the bidding and\nspecifications stuff.\n\n509\n00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,390\nBut, with multi-criteria that's\nwhere we basically rank our ideas.\n\n510\n00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,600\nWe have to choose, we have to pick, right?\n\n511\n00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,760\nAnd so\nwhen you pick you have multiple criteria.\n\n512\n00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,750\nI hate to use the word in the definition,\nbut you have several different aspects\n\n513\n00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,140\nof that idea that you measure against\nto determine who's the winner.\n\n514\n00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,240\nSo for example, if I say,\nI know that I need\n\n515\n00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,910\na car that can get 54 miles to the gallon,\nand it can\n\n516\n00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:23,560\ndo zero to 60 in under five seconds, and\nI have these different criteria, right?\n\n517\n00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,666\nWell, when somebody comes up with\nan idea of how to achieve that,\n\n518\n00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:30,335\nwe could achieve that if we did this\nparticular engine and these tires, and so\n\n519\n00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:33,400\non, versus other solutions that\nmight provide the same thing.\n\n520\n00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,030\nSo, how do we pick between those?\n\n521\n00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,700\nWe have multiple criteria,\nwe look at it, we reach that decision.\n\n522\n00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,260\nAnd then the one that we finally\ndecided on, that's the new requirement.\n\n523\n00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,180\nWe require the use of this engine and\nthese tires.\n\n524\n00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,340\nBecause they allow us to\nachieve this other goal, right?\n\n525\n00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,420\nSo multiple criteria\nkind of feed into that.\n\n526\n00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,960\nWe'll see some more examples\nof that down the road.\n\n527\n00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,840\nEspecially when it comes to bids and\nrequests for quotes.\n\n528\n00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,890\nIf we get a bunch of bids back on\nsomething, how do you pick the winner, and\n\n529\n00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,520\nwe'll use multiple criteria for that.\n\n530\n00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,400\nSo definitely stuff that\nwe need to hit on there.\n\n531\n00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,410\nAll right, now we got a lot more inputs,\nbut Ronnie,\n\n532\n00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,010\nwe're starting to run\na little bit low on time.\n\n533\n00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,950\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n534\n00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:14,660\nWe just left off with our\ngroup creativity techniques.\n\n535\n00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,590\nI kinda led into group decision\nmaking techniques a little bit.\n\n536\n00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,027\nSo we still have that to talk about.\n\n537\n00:27:19,027 --> 00:27:22,139\nAnd I knew we've got like another\nsix objectives or tools and\n\n538\n00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:23,612\ntechniques to get through.\n\n539\n00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:24,400\n>> That's right.\n\n540\n00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,310\n>> So why don't we stop here.\n\n541\n00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,450\nWe'll go ahead and take a break.\n\n542\n00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,536\nAnd when we get back we'll continue\non with collecting our requirements.\n\n543\n00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:32,732\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n544\n00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:39,650\n[MUSIC]\n\n545\n00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,400\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n546\n00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,800\nSo, in the first segment, we took a look\nat the collect requirements process and\n\n547\n00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,720\nwe got almost halfway through\nthe tools and techniques.\n\n548\n00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,280\nWe have quite a few more to get through,\nthough.\n\n549\n00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,110\nSome of the different things we're gonna\nuse as we gather together our requirements\n\n550\n00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,320\nand get ready to build\nour scope statement.\n\n551\n00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:05,200\nSo, the one we left off on was number five\nwhich is group decision-making techniques.\n\n552\n00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,430\nWhen you have one person,\nit's really easy to make decisions.\n\n553\n00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,670\nBut when you have a group of people\nlike your project management team or\n\n554\n00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,050\nthe various stakeholders together,\nnow we need ways to make those decisions.\n\n555\n00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,510\nAnd PMI recognizes, was it four,\nfour different ways, something like that?\n\n556\n00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:27,769\nFour or five different ways that\nit's generally accepted to do this.\n\n557\n00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:28,390\n>> Yeah,\n\n558\n00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,260\nthe first way that we actually have\nlisted here is what we call unanimity.\n\n559\n00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,380\nNow that's a strange word to actually just\nsay here but this is fairly simple for\n\n560\n00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,702\nus in terms of unanimity, and\nthis is when we actually say look,\n\n561\n00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:41,122\nwhat we want is a unanimous decision,\nright?\n\n562\n00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:45,201\nEverybody ends up agreeing to what is\ngonna be done on this course here, and\n\n563\n00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:48,658\nyou just keep working it out\nuntil everybody actually agrees.\n\n564\n00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:53,610\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] unanimity, it's one of\nthose words that we wouldn't normally use.\n\n565\n00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,100\nIts root word is unanimous.\n\n566\n00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,420\nSo when you have unanimity,\n\n567\n00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,680\nthat means that everyone agrees on\nthe course of action without dissent.\n\n568\n00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,320\n>> That's right.\n\n569\n00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,760\n>> So if you have a group of people and\n\n570\n00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,330\nyou're using unanimity as you're deciding\nyour methodology, that means that\n\n571\n00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,895\neveryone has to be in agreement\nof the direction that you choose.\n\n572\n00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:19,410\nThat if even one person says no,\nthen you've not reached a decision,\n\n573\n00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,765\nand you need to continue doing\ndecision-making techniques and\n\n574\n00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:28,385\nnegotiation and stuff until you can\nfinally get 100% of the people on board.\n\n575\n00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:31,705\nIt's got to be a 100% unanimous decision.\n\n576\n00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:33,155\nNow I don't think I've ever used this,\n\n577\n00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:36,030\nbecause sometimes it's very\ndifficult to get people convinced.\n\n578\n00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:40,250\nBut in theory if you're\nmaking the right decision,\n\n579\n00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,390\nit should be easy to convince people\nto go with the right decision.\n\n580\n00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,892\nSo that's what is the premise\nbehind the unanimity.\n\n581\n00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:51,530\nAll right, next one is majority and\nthis is probably the most common of them.\n\n582\n00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,050\nBut, the other ones still come into play.\n\n583\n00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,592\nMajority, we have a group of people,\nwe take a vote.\n\n584\n00:29:56,592 --> 00:30:00,412\nAnd whichever choice gets\nthe most votes wins, right?\n\n585\n00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:04,423\nEven if it's just 51% versus 49%,\n\n586\n00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:09,817\nas long as it's not a tie,\nthen that one decision wins.\n\n587\n00:30:09,817 --> 00:30:10,535\n>> Yeah.\n\n588\n00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,390\nAnd the other one is the idea\nof the plurality, here.\n\n589\n00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,160\nNow there may be more than one\ndecision that needs to be made.\n\n590\n00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,820\nSo what if your particular group ends\nup dividing up into well, three or\n\n591\n00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,530\nfour different positions here?\n\n592\n00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,380\nThe idea of plurality\njust pretty much means,\n\n593\n00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,550\nwhoever gets the most votes at that point,\nwhether it's 50% or over.\n\n594\n00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,730\nThat's the one you're actually gonna\nend up going with a lot of times.\n\n595\n00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,580\nBut it's actually kind of a tenuous\n\n596\n00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,590\nposition a lot of times\nwhen you start doing that.\n\n597\n00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,120\n>> Yeah the thing with plurality and\nactually if we kinda look at it from\n\n598\n00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,420\nthe perspective of majority, majority just\nrequires 51%, right, to have a majority.\n\n599\n00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:47,350\nThat means you could have as much\nas 49% of your team saying no.\n\n600\n00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,650\nThat's not the strongest\ndecision in the world,\n\n601\n00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,650\nso a lot of times you'll set\na higher level than that.\n\n602\n00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,870\nWith a plurality, we say we don't\ncare what the percentage is,\n\n603\n00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,860\nit's just whoever gets\nthe biggest percentage.\n\n604\n00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,430\nSo in Ronnie's example, he said what if\nyou get more than one decision, right?\n\n605\n00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:07,340\nSo what if, for example, let me just\ndo it another little note here.\n\n606\n00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:13,010\nSo I have choice 1, choice 2 and choice 3.\n\n607\n00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,903\nI've got three different choices, okay?\n\n608\n00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:18,861\nAnd we take a vote, and\nchoice 1 one gets 40% of the vote.\n\n609\n00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:24,898\nChoice number 2 gets 20% of the vote,\nnot let's got 25%.\n\n610\n00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:26,396\n25% of the vote.\n\n611\n00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:29,774\nAnd choice number 3 gets 35% of the vote.\n\n612\n00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:33,380\nOkay, did anyone get more than 50%?\n\n613\n00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,280\n>> Nope.\n\n614\n00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,280\n>> No, nobody got half the votes.\n\n615\n00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,250\nBut choice number 1 would win\nbecause it has the plurality, right?\n\n616\n00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,716\nIt's not a majority.\n\n617\n00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,215\nIt doesn't have over 50%.\n\n618\n00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:47,650\nIt's a plurality.\n\n619\n00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,410\nIt's got more than anybody else,\nbut it's 40%.\n\n620\n00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,590\nAnd this is something\nthat is extremely common.\n\n621\n00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,930\nWe always equate this stuff\nto governments, right?\n\n622\n00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,670\nIn European governments,\nyou have a lot of coalition governments\n\n623\n00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,840\nwhere multi-party systems\nend up with this.\n\n624\n00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,080\nIn the US we just have two parties.\n\n625\n00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,950\nThey both kinda suck.\n\n626\n00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,005\nBut anyhow, we have two parties, and so\n\n627\n00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:10,276\nthis idea of majority is what we're\nkind of used to as a society.\n\n628\n00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:16,439\nBut even here, we've had where\nthe pluralities in the past But this one.\n\n629\n00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:20,674\nIt's another one where we say,\nwe're going with this choice but\n\n630\n00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:23,470\nonly 40% of the team agreed with it.\n\n631\n00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,010\nSo is that really the best choice since\n\n632\n00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,380\nless than half of our people\nactually thought it was a good idea?\n\n633\n00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,890\nMaybe these other people have enough\nmerit to make us think, you know,\n\n634\n00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,900\nhere's 60% of my team\nthought this choice was bad.\n\n635\n00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n636\n00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,400\nThat something else was better.\n\n637\n00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,490\nBut I'm about to go with this one\nthat only 40% of the team chose.\n\n638\n00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, pluralities are not something we\n\n639\n00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,590\nsee very often just because there's so\nmuch\n\n640\n00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,255\n>> Room for doubt.\n\n641\n00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:50,392\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n642\n00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:53,090\n>> All right, and\nthen the last one is my favorite.\n\n643\n00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,015\nDictatorship.\n\n644\n00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:54,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n645\n00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,175\nWe might listen to other people.\n\n646\n00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We might take some recommendations.\n\n647\n00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,250\nBut, at the end of the day,\nwe're going to make the call, right?\n\n648\n00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,790\n>> My decision.\n\n649\n00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:07,420\n>> This is really useful in environments\nwhere you need to move rapidly,\n\n650\n00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,960\nwhere you don't have time for debate and\nsitting around in a committee or\n\n651\n00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,415\nwhatever, but the problem is you can\n>> And in a lot of cases make mistakes.\n\n652\n00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:22,245\nAnd you can make mistakes faster\n[LAUGH] because it's a Dictatorship.\n\n653\n00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:24,905\nYou see this in companies though.\n\n654\n00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:25,405\nApple for\n\n655\n00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:29,790\nthe longest time who had Steve Jobs who\nwould absolutely not listen to anyone.\n\n656\n00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,580\nHe had an idea and\nvision and he was right.\n\n657\n00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,400\nAll those years, the company\nkept making more and more money.\n\n658\n00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,470\nThat was an example of a Dictatorship.\n\n659\n00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,770\nBut then you have other organizations\nlike Microsoft where they do have all\n\n660\n00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,820\nthe mid-level management that\ngets involved in the decisions.\n\n661\n00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,810\nAnd they're making progress.\n\n662\n00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:51,020\nIt's slower progress, but\ngenerally it's a little bit more safe.\n\n663\n00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,700\nSo those four methods right there,\n\n664\n00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,680\nthose are group making\ntechniques that PMI recognizes.\n\n665\n00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,530\nIn other words, these are the four\nthat you'll see on the exam.\n\n666\n00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,900\nIn real life,\nyou might have other techniques.\n\n667\n00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,178\nYou'll see like a two-thirds\nMajority is pretty common.\n\n668\n00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:11,140\nAnd a two-thirds Majority\nmeans somebody has to\n\n669\n00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,650\nscore of 66% in order to be the choice.\n\n670\n00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,908\nYou can see like\na three-fourths majority 75%.\n\n671\n00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:20,380\nSo there's variations of these.\n\n672\n00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,950\nBut just these four general concepts.\n\n673\n00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,690\nThese are the ones that we're\ngonna see on the the exam.\n\n674\n00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,380\nAll right.\n\n675\n00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,640\nSome of the other things that we've got.\n\n676\n00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,960\nQuestionnaires and surveys.\n\n677\n00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,510\nAll right.\n\n678\n00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,880\nWe talked earlier about focus groups.\n\n679\n00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,590\nThe problem with a focus group is\nyou've gotta get independent people\n\n680\n00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,110\noutside your company to come in and\n\n681\n00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:42,050\nsit in the room and take part in\nan hour of questioning and stuff.\n\n682\n00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,190\nIt's not convenient, not fast.\n\n683\n00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,220\nAnd it's not really an option for\na lot of people.\n\n684\n00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,030\nQuestionnaires and surveys,\non the other hand, are much more simple.\n\n685\n00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,840\nYou write up your questions and\nyou send them out to people.\n\n686\n00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:59,050\nYou send them out to a sizeable enough\nportion that it's statistically valid.\n\n687\n00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,400\nAnd you send it out to these people, or\nstatistically significant I think is\n\n688\n00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,180\nthe official term we're supposed to use,\nand so we send that out to the people.\n\n689\n00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,290\nAnd you're only gonna get a portion of\nthose surveys and questionnaires back,\n\n690\n00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,380\nright, some people just\naren't gonna fill them out.\n\n691\n00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,020\nBut of the results you get back,\n\n692\n00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,970\nyou can start to make decisions\nbased on the responses.\n\n693\n00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,350\nJust understand that there\nare limitations to surveys.\n\n694\n00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> For example,\n\n695\n00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,530\nif you're doing a phone survey.\n\n696\n00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,180\nAnd you call various people by\nphone to ask them questions,\n\n697\n00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,505\nyou're limiting yourself, one,\nto people who have phones, right?\n\n698\n00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,890\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Not everybody does.\n\n699\n00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,550\nAnd, two, you're limiting yourself to\npeople who have listed phone numbers.\n\n700\n00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,500\nAnd so what you'll find is\nwhen you do a phone survey,\n\n701\n00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,200\nyou're excluding the poverty classes,\nand you're excluding the wealthy elite.\n\n702\n00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,650\nAnd you're really just\npolling the middle class.\n\n703\n00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,900\nRight, the middle class society\nis who's going to have phones and\n\n704\n00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,310\nbe listed in the phone book.\n\n705\n00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,820\nAnd so\nthat's all your phone survey is hitting.\n\n706\n00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,190\nAnd so you need to understand\nyour demographic and\n\n707\n00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,480\nwhich is the best way\nto reach out to them.\n\n708\n00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,910\nIf you do an internet survey, well,\n\n709\n00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,350\nan internet survey assumes that\nyou've got people on the internet,\n\n710\n00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,990\nthat are using computers and so again,\nyou're excluding a lot of the elderly.\n\n711\n00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,200\nPeople who didn't grow up using computers,\nyou're excluding the youth, you know?\n\n712\n00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,800\nPeople who are too young\nto get on the internet.\n\n713\n00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,664\nYou're excluding the Amish, so\nif you're selling Amish goods,\n\n714\n00:36:17,664 --> 00:36:20,920\n[LAUGH] wooden barrels or whatever,\nthen that's not going to work out so well.\n\n715\n00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,920\nSo you do need to tailor this so they\ncan be questions and surveys by paper.\n\n716\n00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,000\nYou can have a person just\nwalking around asking people.\n\n717\n00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,370\nYou can do all sorts of\nways to get information.\n\n718\n00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,989\nIt's kind of a cheaper\nversion of a focus group.\n\n719\n00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:36,410\n>> Yeah.\n>> Alright.\n\n720\n00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,950\nNumber 7 is Observations.\n\n721\n00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,550\nNow, in the IT world we don't\nsee Observations that much,\n\n722\n00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,460\nactually we did it here with\nITProTV with our redesign project.\n\n723\n00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,930\nAs a viewer, I don't know how long you\nguys have been with us as a customer.\n\n724\n00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,420\nBut at the end of March in 2014\nwe did a website redesign.\n\n725\n00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,230\nWe had a website that looked one way.\n\n726\n00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,450\nAnd then at the end of\nMarch they changed it.\n\n727\n00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,150\nAnd now it looks completely different.\n\n728\n00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,750\nRight?\n\n729\n00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,710\nExcept the logo.\nI think everything else is different.\n\n730\n00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:09,030\nSo that was actually the result of\na series of surveys and observation.\n\n731\n00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:14,110\nWe used Google Analytics to monitor how\npeople were navigating through our site.\n\n732\n00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,030\nWhat links were the most clicked on.\n\n733\n00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,470\nHow long people spent on web pages.\n\n734\n00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,870\nAnd we use that information,\n\n735\n00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:24,890\nobservation of how people use the page, to\nmake the decision of how to redesign it.\n\n736\n00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,220\nIf there was a link that nobody ever\nclicked on, it didn't need to be there.\n\n737\n00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,250\nIt could go away.\n\n738\n00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,880\nBut if people are constantly clicking five\ntimes to get to a particular destination,\n\n739\n00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,680\nthen it makes sense to move that so\nthat they will only have to click once.\n\n740\n00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,870\nSo, Observations were a direct contributor\nto how we redesign that website.\n\n741\n00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,450\nI say we.\nI don't think I did anything.\n\n742\n00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,427\nSo we'll have the web designers\nredesign the website.\n\n743\n00:37:46,427 --> 00:37:50,110\n>> [LAUGH] The next one that we have\nhere is the idea of prototyping.\n\n744\n00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,470\nPrototyping, again,\ncan come in many various forms for us.\n\n745\n00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,860\nSo they really do list about\nthree different examples\n\n746\n00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,310\nin our PMBOK here for this.\n\n747\n00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,570\nAnd the first one is just\na simple working model.\n\n748\n00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,240\nRight?\n\n749\n00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,300\nWe again may not have everything done.\n\n750\n00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,820\nWe may say, hey,\nhere's a particular working model, and\n\n751\n00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,360\nlet's see how this works here.\n\n752\n00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,560\nAnd we try it out, and again, depending\non how people take a look at this,\n\n753\n00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,690\nthen they go, that's exactly what we want.\n\n754\n00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,660\n>> Yep.\n\n755\n00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,780\nYeah, you see Prototypes with any\nkind of manufacturing project.\n\n756\n00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,520\nI mentioned, for example, maybe we're\ndesigning the new 2016 Ford Focus.\n\n757\n00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,430\nAnd so we create a few Prototypes.\n\n758\n00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,370\nThat doesn't mean we\ncreate full size cars.\n\n759\n00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,810\nMaybe they're little clay models or\nwhatever.\n\n760\n00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,990\nAnd so the designers create a few of these\nand we use those in our focus groups and\n\n761\n00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,200\nsurveys and stuff.\n\n762\n00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,215\nSo it just gives people\na tangible ability to see it.\n\n763\n00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:42,035\nMaybe you're creating some kind of hand\nheld, you know, iPod, MP3 player and\n\n764\n00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:46,075\nso you want people to hold it in\ntheir hand and see how it feels.\n\n765\n00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:51,560\nThat's easy to do if you have a real\nprototype versus something that is just\n\n766\n00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,780\non a computer screen.\n\n767\n00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now with our website,\n\n768\n00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,870\nthe way that redesign went is\nthe designers actually submitted to us\n\n769\n00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,060\na wire frame drawing.\n\n770\n00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,700\nAnd they said, here's what\nthe website's going to look like.\n\n771\n00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,540\nwhat do you think?\n\n772\n00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,620\nAnd we went back and\nforth a few times as they revised it.\n\n773\n00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,950\nThose were Prototypes, right?\n\n774\n00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Just mock ups of what the website was\n\n775\n00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,870\ngoing to look like.\n\n776\n00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:14,000\nStoryboarding you really see with\nthings like movies and books, right?\n\n777\n00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,570\nIf you're gonna be doing a movie you've\ngot a whole plot to deal with, so.\n\n778\n00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,500\nI was joking around\nabout it the other day.\n\n779\n00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,230\nThere was the movie 300 about the Spartan.\n\n780\n00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,730\n>> Stand up thermo.\n\n781\n00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,200\nNo, thermopoly.\n>> There you go, the thermopoly.\n\n782\n00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,250\nSo anyhow, they made a sequels\nof the dag gone things.\n\n783\n00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,100\nSo, they made 300 parts to it,\nor whatever it was called.\n\n784\n00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,470\nAnd I remember saying at the time man,\nhow do they storyboard that.\n\n785\n00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:44,020\nBecause they had to say all right, first\nthing, everyone died in the first film so\n\n786\n00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,550\nI guess we're going to\nneed to overcome that.\n\n787\n00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:50,410\nSo we'll put that in here [LAUGH] so they\nprobably did a few different mock ups of,\n\n788\n00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:54,560\nhere's how we can resurrect all these\ndead people and have a story out of it.\n\n789\n00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,550\nSo they do these storyboards.\n\n790\n00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,130\nand then kind of play\nout to see how it goes.\n\n791\n00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,320\n>> All right.\n>> Did you see that movie?\n\n792\n00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,560\n>> I did not.\n>> I curious how they get around.\n\n793\n00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,410\nYou can't kill everybody and\nthen make a sequel.\n\n794\n00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,440\nMabye it's a prequel.\n\n795\n00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> Who knows.\n\n796\n00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,492\nThese are the things that way on my mind.\n\n797\n00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,510\n>> You know they did do that\nwith the godfather movies.\n\n798\n00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,214\nThey'd kill everybody at\nthe end Michael Corleone.\n\n799\n00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:14,690\n[CROSSTALK] Just goes back in the past.\n\n800\n00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,360\n>> All right.\n\n801\n00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,540\nSome of the other things.\n\n802\n00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,440\nBenchmarking.\n\n803\n00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,880\nIf we have more than one solution.\n\n804\n00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,820\nRight?\nMore than one requirement.\n\n805\n00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,170\nWe may need to do some Benchmarking,\n\n806\n00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,340\nto determine which one actually\nachieves what we want.\n\n807\n00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,130\nIf we know that we want to\nget an engine that will\n\n808\n00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,560\ngive our car 54 miles to a gallon, right?\n\n809\n00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,400\nWell then I might have more than\none engine that can do that.\n\n810\n00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,620\nAnd so I might need to do Benchmarking\nwhen I say here's my measure,\n\n811\n00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,390\nI wanna have 54 miles to the gallon,\nlet's try these three or four engines.\n\n812\n00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,910\nAnd see which one does the best,\n\n813\n00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,410\nand it may be that we find one\nthat 58 miles to a gallon, and\n\n814\n00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,440\nthat's not what we wanted it's better and\nso we choose to go that route.\n\n815\n00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,350\nYou know we don't know unless we\nstart to compare the different ones.\n\n816\n00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,010\nAnd then once we've picked that,\nwe make that part of our requirement.\n\n817\n00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,780\nWe require that we use\nthis particular engine,\n\n818\n00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,847\nbecause it gives us the performance\ncharacteristics we want.\n\n819\n00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,125\nAll right, we have Context Diagrams.\n\n820\n00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:15,150\n[LAUGH] Sometimes when we look at just\nan individual piece of the project\n\n821\n00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,730\nby itself everything is simple and it\nlooks like we've planned for everything.\n\n822\n00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,200\nBut then when we start to\nstring it all together and\n\n823\n00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,690\nput it into context,\nwe see problems creep up.\n\n824\n00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,590\nRight?\n\n825\n00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,310\nThis is really true with building a house.\n\n826\n00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:32,650\nYou're building a house so you might\nsecure a contractor to do the plumbing,\n\n827\n00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,120\na contractor to do the electricity,\na contractor to do the drywall.\n\n828\n00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,090\nWell, you don't want people\nputting up the drywall\n\n829\n00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,250\nbefore the electricians\nrun the electrical cable.\n\n830\n00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,730\nAnd you don't want\nthe plumber coming in and\n\n831\n00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,990\nrunning plumbing that gets in\nthe way of the electrician.\n\n832\n00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,850\nAnd so independently it's really\neasy to plan and line them up.\n\n833\n00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,800\nBut getting them to kind of work together,\nthat becomes a bit of a challenge.\n\n834\n00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,290\nAnd we start to do Context Diagrams kind\nof showing how all of this is going to\n\n835\n00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,730\nwork, any inputs into the systems,\nthe actors that are apart of it and so on.\n\n836\n00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,450\nWe can start to see complexities\nthat we didn't see at first, and\n\n837\n00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,440\nwe can start to plan for those.\n\n838\n00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,150\n>> You know the last one here is\nthe idea of Document Analysis.\n\n839\n00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,490\nSometimes, it is getting\ninformation from the past again and\n\n840\n00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,560\ncoming in and being able to actually\nadd in something into the scope itself.\n\n841\n00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,150\nOr maybe even examining a comparison\nproduct that you may actually want to do.\n\n842\n00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,280\nAnd take a look at some of\nthe documentation behind it.\n\n843\n00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,370\nAnd pulling information from that to\nhelp you build your scope as well.\n\n844\n00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,840\nSo I mean there's a couple of\ndifferent neat techniques here for\n\n845\n00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,060\nus to be able to help us\nfulfill what we need to.\n\n846\n00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,120\n>> Now the key thing to remember here,\nit's not necessarily your documents.\n\n847\n00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,780\nI mentioned the Gardner Group\nin an earlier episode.\n\n848\n00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,540\nWhen I engage in a high level IT project,\n\n849\n00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,040\nI'll usually reach out\nto the Gardner Group and\n\n850\n00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,170\nsay hey, do you have any documentation\nfrom other companies that have done this?\n\n851\n00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,700\nAnd that way I can get a copy\nof their project document.\n\n852\n00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,850\nSo I'm not analyzing mine.\n\n853\n00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:49,790\nI'm analyzing theirs.\n\n854\n00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,010\nAnd saying okay,\nhow can I benefit from what they learned?\n\n855\n00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,460\nHow can I streamline my system?\n\n856\n00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,700\nSo that's a very useful thing to have.\n\n857\n00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,370\nAll right, so those are all the tools and\ntechniques available for\n\n858\n00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,660\ncollect requirements.\n\n859\n00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,460\nAre we going to use them all?\n\n860\n00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,350\nProbably not, right?\n\n861\n00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,500\nMaybe if you're super thorough, but\nnormally you're only going to need three\n\n862\n00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,130\nor four of these to be able to get\nthe information that you need.\n\n863\n00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,010\nNow you might pass through it more than\nonce, you might do a set of focus groups,\n\n864\n00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,180\nmake some changes and then do another set\nof focus groups, make some more changes,\n\n865\n00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,610\nthen maybe do some surveys.\n\n866\n00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:26,590\nYou know, so you'll mix and match these,\nyou'll go through it several times and\n\n867\n00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,030\nthat's why, when we reach the end of this,\n\n868\n00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,720\nwe've got requirements documentation,\nwhere we write out our requirements.\n\n869\n00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,800\nAnd then we may just feed that right\nback in here as our requirements and\n\n870\n00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,550\nrepeat, right?\n\n871\n00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,350\nRinse and repeat, you can cycle\nthrough this one several times.\n\n872\n00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,900\nYou continue cycling through it\n\n873\n00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,820\nuntil everyone agrees that\nyou've covered all your bases.\n\n874\n00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,010\nYou don't want any surprise requirements\ncreeping up later on because\n\n875\n00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,870\nyou won't have planned for them and\nthey're gonna slip through the cracks.\n\n876\n00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,280\nThe other output that we have, though,\naside from the requirements documentation,\n\n877\n00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,910\nis the requirements\nTraceability Matrix and\n\n878\n00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,730\nI know I've talked about this\none a couple of times now.\n\n879\n00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,970\nBut the main goal of that Traceability,\n\n880\n00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:10,250\nactually we've got quite\na bit of stuff here.\n\n881\n00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,960\nLet's talk about\nthe Traceability one first.\n\n882\n00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,660\n>> Okay.\n>> And then we'll\n\n883\n00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,390\ncome back to the other one.\n\n884\n00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:18,720\nSo when we're talking about that\nTraceability Matrix, this guy right here.\n\n885\n00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:26,090\nWhat it's doing is it's helping us to keep\ntrack of the requirements themselves,\n\n886\n00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:30,440\nwhere they came from, who's responsible,\nhow they're interrelated.\n\n887\n00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,380\nAnd so we need to make sure\nwe've got a record of that.\n\n888\n00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:37,220\nNow, some of this we'll be able to fill\nout right away, some we won't because\n\n889\n00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,900\nwe'll see it's tied to another document\ncalled a work breakdown structure, and\n\n890\n00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,740\nwe don't have the work\nbreakdown structure yet.\n\n891\n00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,200\nSo we may have to go and design that and\nthen come back and revisit this again.\n\n892\n00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,600\nSo that Traceability Matrix\nis a pretty neat thing, and\n\n893\n00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,320\nwe'll take a look at it in a moment.\n\n894\n00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,920\nBut I wanted to step back and\n\n895\n00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,690\ntake a look at some of this\nRequirements documentation.\n\n896\n00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:00,250\nWhen we create that requirements document,\nwe're identifying\n\n897\n00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,660\nevery requirement that we catalog and\nsome basic information about about it and\n\n898\n00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,910\nPMI has three categories that\nthey really hit on there.\n\n899\n00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:12,980\nThey have Business Requirements, Solution\nRequirements, and Project Requirements.\n\n900\n00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,560\n>> One more,\nthat's Stakeholder Requirements.\n\n901\n00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,924\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> The Stakeholder Requirements\n\n902\n00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,697\nare probably the most important of them.\n\n903\n00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:24,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, when you go into a project,\n\n904\n00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,080\n>> The one that you're hearing about first\n\n905\n00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,890\nis you're hearing about what's\ncoming from the originator.\n\n906\n00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,100\nRight?\nThat person who's kicking this off,\n\n907\n00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,790\nwho wants to get this thing done.\n\n908\n00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,010\nIt's their baby, their project, and\n\n909\n00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,400\nthey wanna make sure that\nit gets taken care of.\n\n910\n00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,860\nIt's actually, I guess,\nthat should be indented.\n\n911\n00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,500\nSo those are what we're working on.\n\n912\n00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,240\nBut other requirements come\nfrom different places.\n\n913\n00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,930\nSo our business might have it's\nown set of requirements for\n\n914\n00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,750\nany project that we undertake.\n\n915\n00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,260\nSo for example, you might have a\ngovernance requirement, that says whatever\n\n916\n00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,760\nproject you're in, you've got to do\nweekly financial status reporting,\n\n917\n00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,330\nto show your current budget allocation.\n\n918\n00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,530\nAre you above, below, or on budget?\n\n919\n00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,080\nSo we want to know and\nwant it to be weekly.\n\n920\n00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,490\nThere might be other requirements in there\nthat say, all along the way, any time you\n\n921\n00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,615\ncut a check, you've got to submit this\npaperwork into the accounting department.\n\n922\n00:46:16,615 --> 00:46:19,985\nAnd so these become requirements that\naren't something to work towards.\n\n923\n00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:23,150\nWe just have to make sure we follow as\nwe go through to meet that requirement.\n\n924\n00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,605\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So they may have their own\n\n925\n00:46:24,605 --> 00:46:26,965\nvalues in there, all right?\n\n926\n00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:29,530\nAnd you'll see some of the things here\nthat we gotta make sure that we have\n\n927\n00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,060\nTraceability which we'll\nsee with the matrix,\n\n928\n00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,260\nthat we've got other business rules for\nperforming, right?\n\n929\n00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,800\nYou have to meet certain\nperformance levels, and\n\n930\n00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,035\nwe've got just the general\n[LAUGH] Guiding Principles.\n\n931\n00:46:43,035 --> 00:46:43,655\nThere we go.\n\n932\n00:46:43,655 --> 00:46:47,595\nThe general Guiding Principles of our\nOrganization and how they do business.\n\n933\n00:46:47,595 --> 00:46:48,535\nThis would be like Google.\n\n934\n00:46:48,535 --> 00:46:51,295\n>> Yeah.\n>> Google has that motto, don't be evil.\n\n935\n00:46:51,295 --> 00:46:53,255\nRight?\nThat's their company motto.\n\n936\n00:46:53,255 --> 00:46:55,205\nSo whatever project they undertake,\n\n937\n00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,600\nwhich that project might be illegally\ncapturing people's data across America.\n\n938\n00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,680\n>> No.\n>> Which they did.\n\n939\n00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,550\nBut as long as they did it by not\nbeing evil then that's okay, right?\n\n940\n00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,090\n>> That's true.\n\n941\n00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,980\n>> So I think they failed on that one.\n\n942\n00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,370\nSo yeah but those are things that\nmight come from the business.\n\n943\n00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:10,870\n>> Yeah.\n\n944\n00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,880\nNow the stakeholder I talked\nabout this one earlier,\n\n945\n00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,400\nthis isn't necessarily the originator\nthis is any stakeholder that we attach,\n\n946\n00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,398\nremember I mentioned\nthat example of training.\n\n947\n00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:25,400\nSo a mid-level manager says boy,\nI'm really worried about our people being\n\n948\n00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,580\ntrained up on this software\nwe're about to deploy.\n\n949\n00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,090\nCan we add to the project\na training period, right?\n\n950\n00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:35,060\nSo here's a new requirement that\ncreeps up and the originator or\n\n951\n00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,080\nstakeholder may look a that and approve\nit, and say, yeah, that's a good idea,\n\n952\n00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,310\nlet's put that in there.\n\n953\n00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:44,930\nSo we have this when we impact other\norganizational areas in our company.\n\n954\n00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,480\nThese are other people that have\nrequirements because they're affected\n\n955\n00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,190\nby the project.\n\n956\n00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,860\nSame thing with entities, inside or\noutside of the organization,\n\n957\n00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,520\nthat we may have contractors or\nmore commonly our customers.\n\n958\n00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,445\nSo, when I worked for the bank and we\nwere replacing all these networks, well,\n\n959\n00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,920\nwe had to take the ATM machines\noffline while we replace the networks.\n\n960\n00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,679\nThat inconvenienced our customers,\nand so we had to\n\n961\n00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,080\nmake sure to schedule that during a time\nwhen it would impact the fewest customers.\n\n962\n00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,910\nSo we wanted to replace the network lines,\nbut there was a new requirement that was\n\n963\n00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,860\nwe had to do it while\nminimizing customer access.\n\n964\n00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,240\nSo we had to analyze what times\nthe ATM machines were busiest and\n\n965\n00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,230\nwhat time they were the least busy, and\n\n966\n00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:29,340\nschedule the changeover to happen\nwhen the ATMs were the least busy.\n\n967\n00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,480\nOur customers determined\nour migration schedule.\n\n968\n00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:36,648\nAnd then lastly,\njust general communication requirements.\n\n969\n00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:40,310\nThe other stakeholders that are out\nthere may not actually have influence on\n\n970\n00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,250\nyour project.\n\n971\n00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,260\nThey just need to be informed.\n\n972\n00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,950\nAnd so we might have to introduce\nrequirements that pertain to how we\n\n973\n00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:52,040\ncommunicate that, and we'll see that\nwith the communications management plan.\n\n974\n00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,250\nNow the solution requirements.\n\n975\n00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,670\nThese are generally the ones that come\nin the beginning from the originator,\n\n976\n00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,400\nfrom maybe the sponsor, but\nwhoever it is that kicked this thing off.\n\n977\n00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,690\nThey have a set of requirements and we've\ngot to meet those to make the solution for\n\n978\n00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:07,690\ntheir system.\n\n979\n00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:12,820\nBut we may identify other things as\nwe go that we have to live up to.\n\n980\n00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:16,930\nNow when a person comes up with a list\nof requirements for what they want,\n\n981\n00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,930\nthey're generally functional and\nnonfunctional requirements.\n\n982\n00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,330\nA functional requirement is\nsomething that's needed for\n\n983\n00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,430\nthis device to perform its function or\nfor this solution to work.\n\n984\n00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,920\nThere's nonfunctional ones that\naren't necessarily required for\n\n985\n00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,590\nthe service or device or\nwhatever to perform its function but\n\n986\n00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:38,300\nare still required for some other reason.\n\n987\n00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,500\nSo for example, the ITProTV website.\n\n988\n00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,340\nOur website doesn't have to look nice.\n\n989\n00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,880\nIt could look like vintage\n1997 if we wanted it to,\n\n990\n00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,090\nas long as people were able to log in,\nsubscribe, watch videos and do that stuff,\n\n991\n00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,730\nas long as the functionality was there.\n\n992\n00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:58,040\nBut we chose to have it look a little more\nmodern because, well, people like that.\n\n993\n00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,420\nIt's part of the experience.\n\n994\n00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,960\nWe want you guys to have an enjoyable\nexperience when you hit the web page.\n\n995\n00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,609\nSo those are our kind of\nnonfunctional requirements.\n\n996\n00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,420\nAll right, technology and\nstandard compliance requirements.\n\n997\n00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,700\nThese come from whatever our industry is.\n\n998\n00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,505\nSo if you're in the banking industry\nyou might have SAS 70 requirements or\n\n999\n00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:17,190\nSarbanes-Oxley to deal with.\n\n1000\n00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,430\nIn the medical industry\nyou have HIPAA compliance.\n\n1001\n00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:22,832\nSo we may get requirements that come not\nfrom the originator but from these laws,\n\n1002\n00:50:22,832 --> 00:50:24,294\nthese statutes and regulations.\n\n1003\n00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:30,810\nAll right, support and training I\nkind of already talked about I guess.\n\n1004\n00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:34,970\nIf we need to make sure that people are\nprepared to use what it is we're doing.\n\n1005\n00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:38,360\nIf we're designing the new 2016\nFord Focus, we need to make sure\n\n1006\n00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,570\nthe engineering team knows how to\nbuild what it is that we're designing.\n\n1007\n00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:44,910\nAnd you see this all the time in\ntechnology but in other industries too.\n\n1008\n00:50:47,892 --> 00:50:50,490\nQuality requirements,\nthese are kinda hard to define.\n\n1009\n00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:53,530\nFor most of us, quality simply\nmeans meeting our requirements.\n\n1010\n00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,680\nWhatever requirements we define,\nif we meet them all, we hit our quality.\n\n1011\n00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,850\nBut in manufacturing you\nhave a certain yield rate.\n\n1012\n00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,767\nIn manufacturing,\nit doesn't matter what you manufacture.\n\n1013\n00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:06,936\nYou can manufacture blue jeans, and\nout of 1,000 pairs of blue jeans,\n\n1014\n00:51:06,936 --> 00:51:11,169\nyou're going to have some-\n>> Defect qualities, defects?\n\n1015\n00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:11,969\n>> Defects, that is the exact word.\n\n1016\n00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,747\nSo you'll have some defects.\n\n1017\n00:51:13,747 --> 00:51:17,940\nAnd the defects, they're just there and\nit's a part of that process.\n\n1018\n00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,337\nAnd so maintaining quality is\nminimizing the amount of defects.\n\n1019\n00:51:21,337 --> 00:51:24,803\nAnd that's where you see\nthings like Six Sigma and CPI,\n\n1020\n00:51:24,803 --> 00:51:26,945\nContinual Process Improvement,\n\n1021\n00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:30,290\nwhere they're not working\nto change the processes.\n\n1022\n00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,510\nThey're working to reduce the defects.\n\n1023\n00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,019\nThe less defects you have, the better.\n\n1024\n00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:38,252\nIn IT, when Intel makes processors,\nwhen they make CPUs,\n\n1025\n00:51:38,252 --> 00:51:43,515\nthey print them in sheets that are several\nhundred processors on a sheet.\n\n1026\n00:51:43,515 --> 00:51:46,637\nAnd they just plan from the beginning\nthat they know they're gonna have\n\n1027\n00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:48,110\na failure rate in there.\n\n1028\n00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:52,399\nAnd when they make a brand new processor,\nlike these new Bay Trail ones right now,\n\n1029\n00:51:52,399 --> 00:51:54,710\ntheir yield rate is something like 40%.\n\n1030\n00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:00,410\nThey're losing over 60% of those CPUs and\nthey just become trash in a lot of cases.\n\n1031\n00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,913\nBut over time they get better and\nbetter and\n\n1032\n00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:03,640\nbetter at it,\nuntil their yield rate is 90%.\n\n1033\n00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,190\nAnd so they're always going\nto be throwing some away.\n\n1034\n00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,689\nWhen you have millions of\ntransistors that close together,\n\n1035\n00:52:09,689 --> 00:52:11,410\nyou're always gonna have some defects.\n\n1036\n00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:17,030\nAnd then the reporting requirements, these\nusually come from the originator also.\n\n1037\n00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,090\nThey say hey, as this project goes on,\nI need to be kept in the loop,\n\n1038\n00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:21,760\nI need to know this information.\n\n1039\n00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,270\nBut if they don't ask for it, we need\nto impose it as the project manager,\n\n1040\n00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:29,370\nas part of our openness and\nclarity as we share the information.\n\n1041\n00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:29,980\n>> Accountability.\n>> Yeah,\n\n1042\n00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,550\nabsolutely, so the best way to\navoid the appearance of impropriety\n\n1043\n00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,290\nis to be open with your information,\nso keep it available.\n\n1044\n00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,850\nAll right, and\nwe're running short on time, but\n\n1045\n00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,220\nlet's just hit some of these last\nones here real quick before we stop.\n\n1046\n00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,930\nThe project requirements.\n\n1047\n00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:49,010\nSo these are requirements that come\nfrom the project management plan.\n\n1048\n00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,890\nIn the project management plan it'll\ndefine any special requirements we have,\n\n1049\n00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:57,085\nand these'll be things like our level of\nservice, performance, safety, compliance.\n\n1050\n00:52:57,085 --> 00:53:00,615\nThat's things that we have to live up to\nbecause the company has designated that.\n\n1051\n00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:06,655\nThen the acceptance criteria also coming\nfrom that plan, saying when this project\n\n1052\n00:53:06,655 --> 00:53:11,335\nis done, how do both sides\nknow it's done beyond a doubt?\n\n1053\n00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:13,585\nSo what is that acceptance criteria?\n\n1054\n00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:16,250\nIf we've met all the requirements,\nthen you get acceptance.\n\n1055\n00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,660\nThe project's closed.\n\n1056\n00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,570\nIf we haven't met the requirements,\nwhat do we do?\n\n1057\n00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,702\nWhat do we do to obtain that,\nto get acceptance?\n\n1058\n00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:25,360\nHow do we get up to speed?\n\n1059\n00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,164\nTransition requirements.\n\n1060\n00:53:27,164 --> 00:53:31,787\nIf you are in a multipart project,\na project of multiple subprojects,\n\n1061\n00:53:31,787 --> 00:53:36,718\nwhen your subproject is done, we\ntransition into the next subproject, and\n\n1062\n00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:40,980\nthere's information that has\nto be shared and other things.\n\n1063\n00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,510\nThe second team has to be ready to receive\nwhatever it is that we've produced.\n\n1064\n00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:47,760\nAnd so we've got requirements\nto ensure interoperability.\n\n1065\n00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,780\nThat's what broke down with the United\nStates Healthcare website, healthcare.gov.\n\n1066\n00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:57,840\nThey had one big healthcare\nwebsite to design and\n\n1067\n00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,472\nthey used 25 separate contractors.\n\n1068\n00:54:00,472 --> 00:54:03,627\nThey had one big one that oversaw it and\nthen 25 subcontractors.\n\n1069\n00:54:03,627 --> 00:54:09,190\nAnd each contractor worked independently,\nproduced these 25 pieces, QCed them.\n\n1070\n00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,960\nThey all passed, they all worked well.\n\n1071\n00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,520\nAnd then they just threw\nthem all together and\n\n1072\n00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,310\nthey assume they would work,\nwhich they didn't.\n\n1073\n00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:18,310\nAnd so for months the site was unusable,\nand that's what happens.\n\n1074\n00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:21,980\nYou've gotta have transition requirements\nso you're readied for that interoperation.\n\n1075\n00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:29,060\nAnd then lastly, requirements assumptions,\ndependencies and constraints.\n\n1076\n00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:33,780\nThis is anything else that we know\nthat could limit our project.\n\n1077\n00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,550\nDependencies and constraints,\nthese are usually tied to budget,\n\n1078\n00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:42,840\nschedule, resources, when you can\nget people available and so on.\n\n1079\n00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,340\nAnd then assumptions are just,\n\n1080\n00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,110\nat this stage in the game\nthere's things we don't know.\n\n1081\n00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:54,181\nWe're making some assumptions about our\nproject and hopefully they stay true, but\n\n1082\n00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:59,582\nthey might not, so we need to make sure\nthat's all documented in here too.\n\n1083\n00:54:59,582 --> 00:55:00,415\nAll right, so\n\n1084\n00:55:00,415 --> 00:55:04,730\nthose are the primary outputs as far\nas the requirements documentation.\n\n1085\n00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:08,200\nWe're gonna take a look after the break\nat a template of what that documentation\n\n1086\n00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,810\nlooks like and how we catalog it.\n\n1087\n00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,680\nAnd then we'll take a look at\nthe requirements traceability matrix also,\n\n1088\n00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,050\nget a chance to see that.\n\n1089\n00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:19,350\nIt's some pretty neat stuff, so definitely\nsomething to take a look at there.\n\n1090\n00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,520\nAll right, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n1091\n00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,730\nWhen we get back,\nmore requirements after this.\n\n1092\n00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:30,788\n[MUSIC]\n\n1093\n00:55:30,788 --> 00:55:33,150\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n1094\n00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:38,060\nSo before the break, we were talking\nabout requirements documentation, and\n\n1095\n00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,230\nthen afterwards we still had\nthe traceability matrix, right?\n\n1096\n00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,434\nSo on the requirements documentation,\nit sounded like a lot and\n\n1097\n00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:47,058\nwhen you look at those notes,\nwhere'd my notes go?\n\n1098\n00:55:47,058 --> 00:55:50,178\nHere, requirements documentation,\nI started here and\n\n1099\n00:55:50,178 --> 00:55:54,802\nwent all the way down here and good gosh,\nthere's just so much stuff there, right?\n\n1100\n00:55:54,802 --> 00:55:55,949\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n1101\n00:55:55,949 --> 00:55:59,127\nrequirements documentation is\nactually pretty straightforward.\n\n1102\n00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:02,607\nIf you start with a template, so\nI've got my little template here for\n\n1103\n00:56:02,607 --> 00:56:06,569\nrequirements documentation, you can\nstart with something fairly simple and\n\n1104\n00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:10,770\nthrow information in there, knowing that\nwe can always be more specific later on,\n\n1105\n00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,391\nbut we need to get the basics here so\nthat it's everything identified.\n\n1106\n00:56:14,391 --> 00:56:18,644\nAnd so using this template you\nwould basically go through and,\n\n1107\n00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:21,250\nfirst you'd figure how to zoom in.\n\n1108\n00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,900\nThat's gonna help me some.\n\n1109\n00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,330\nThere we go.\n\n1110\n00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,650\nAnd you go through and\nyou just start to fill it out.\n\n1111\n00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,220\nAnd like any of my templates,\nwe put the project title, project manager,\n\n1112\n00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,490\ndate prepared up there at the top, and\nthen you get into the real information.\n\n1113\n00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,580\nWith each requirement we\nneed to track a few things.\n\n1114\n00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,700\nEvery requirement should\nhave an ID number.\n\n1115\n00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,920\nThe ID number, or letter or name,\nwhatever it is you want to use,\n\n1116\n00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,630\nI almost always use numbers,\nhelps us to refer to these later on.\n\n1117\n00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,450\nHey, I'm working with\nrequirement number seven.\n\n1118\n00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,920\nCan you take a look at this?\n\n1119\n00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,320\nOr requirement number seven actually\ndepends on requirement number\n\n1120\n00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,850\nfour being complete.\n\n1121\n00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:59,710\nHaving a number makes it much easier\nto write this and represent it.\n\n1122\n00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:04,570\nSo we can pick whatever we\nwant those numbers to be, and\n\n1123\n00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,020\njust kind of throw those in there.\n\n1124\n00:57:07,294 --> 00:57:10,400\nYou might want to pretty this up\na little bit or something, I don't know.\n\n1125\n00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,584\nBut basically you throw that\ninformation in there and\n\n1126\n00:57:12,584 --> 00:57:15,090\nthen you start to list what\nyour requirements are.\n\n1127\n00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:18,480\nNow remember, your original\nstakeholder gave you some requirements\n\n1128\n00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,250\nback in the charter draft when\nwe were trying to do that.\n\n1129\n00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:25,710\nAnd so if a project manager was\nalready attached at that time, they\n\n1130\n00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:29,115\nwere probably filling out this document\neven though we weren't in planning yet,\n\n1131\n00:57:29,115 --> 00:57:30,700\ncuz that saves a little time.\n\n1132\n00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,960\nBut otherwise, we can just cut and paste.\n\n1133\n00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,050\nWe can get the requirements from\nthe charter and throw them in here and\n\n1134\n00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:38,660\nstart to add to it as we go.\n\n1135\n00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:44,796\nSo we might have a color consistency\n\n1136\n00:57:44,796 --> 00:57:48,890\nrequirement and so on.\n\n1137\n00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:51,130\nYou know we just start to list\nthese various requirements.\n\n1138\n00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:54,710\nWe specify the stakeholder, where they\ncame from, so this one came from me,\n\n1139\n00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:57,180\nand a category.\n\n1140\n00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,660\nNow I said I like to do Primary,\n\n1141\n00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:05,650\nSecondary and Optional as my categories,\nbut you can use whatever category\n\n1142\n00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:09,170\nsystem you want to be able to rank and\nprioritize these.\n\n1143\n00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,830\nNow you'll see this particular\nform has a priority column also.\n\n1144\n00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,040\nYou may not need both.\n\n1145\n00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,480\nYou may just need one, so\ncustomize it however you want.\n\n1146\n00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,340\nBut if I continue down my requirements,\n\n1147\n00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:26,360\nmaybe I've got a couple of primary\nones that have to get done, but\n\n1148\n00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,630\nthis one's priority number one\nbecause it's got to be done first.\n\n1149\n00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,860\nThese other guys may be\nin a different order.\n\n1150\n00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,500\nSo I come through and\nI start to prioritize these.\n\n1151\n00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,890\nThat way if I ever have to\nmake a choice between one or\n\n1152\n00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:40,636\nthe other, I'll assign priority\nto one that's a higher priority.\n\n1153\n00:58:40,636 --> 00:58:44,140\nAll right, acceptance criteria.\n\n1154\n00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,300\nHow do I know when I've\nmet the requirement?\n\n1155\n00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,690\nSo what test is being\nused to measure that?\n\n1156\n00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,550\nNow there's two ways to go about this.\n\n1157\n00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:55,210\nIf it's a straightforward yes or\nno, it's complete,\n\n1158\n00:58:55,210 --> 00:59:00,500\ntangible good received, then we can\nput that, tangible good received.\n\n1159\n00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,830\nSo if I have a requirement\nthat five prototype\n\n1160\n00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:12,130\nwax mold Ford Focus 2016 models\nare created, I'll know that it's done,\n\n1161\n00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:17,540\nI'll accept that, when I have five wax\nmodel 2016 Ford Focus models in my hand.\n\n1162\n00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,490\nRight, so you don't need anything crazy.\n\n1163\n00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:24,500\nBut, what if it was the result of\nfocus groups and opinion surveys and\n\n1164\n00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,630\nstuff like that?\n\n1165\n00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:28,570\nIn that scenario,\nyou might need to have some kind of\n\n1166\n00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:32,390\ntest where you run a test to\nfind out if you're meeting that.\n\n1167\n00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:35,030\nSo we're designing a process, and\n\n1168\n00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,980\nthe process is the process of how\nwe're going to manufacture blue jeans.\n\n1169\n00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,310\nAnd we should be able to manufacture\n1,000 blue jeans per hour\n\n1170\n00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:45,040\nwith a 10% defect rate.\n\n1171\n00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,890\nWell, if I want to accept that process\nis being done I'm gonna need to run\n\n1172\n00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:54,440\na test and so I may have a QC or\nQA, quality control,\n\n1173\n00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,750\nquality assurance test that we run.\n\n1174\n00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,640\nAnd maybe we do 1,000 pairs of blue jeans\nand we see what our defect rate is.\n\n1175\n01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,960\nAnd if it's under 10%,\nthen we know we've met that requirement.\n\n1176\n01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,590\nBut if it's over 10%, we know we\nhaven't met the requirement yet and so\n\n1177\n01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:12,900\nwe go back to the books and\nwe continue to refine our process.\n\n1178\n01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,630\nSo different projects are going\nto have different needs.\n\n1179\n01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:18,260\nYou may not have acceptance criteria for\neverything.\n\n1180\n01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:26,160\nYour acceptance criteria might\nbe to pass the validation tests.\n\n1181\n01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,670\nAnd so then you would just jump\nover to this other column.\n\n1182\n01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,680\nBut if it's something like this,\ntangible good received, you don't\n\n1183\n01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,600\nneed a validation method for that, so\nyou just put non-applicable and that's it.\n\n1184\n01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,010\nSo you basically fill this out based\non the information that you need.\n\n1185\n01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:45,560\nUnderstand that the first\ntime you fill this out,\n\n1186\n01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,050\nyou're not gonna have\nall your requirements.\n\n1187\n01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,240\nIt's a rare thing.\n\n1188\n01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,600\nI've never had it happen.\n\n1189\n01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,090\nMaybe somebody smarter than me or\nsomething does, but for\n\n1190\n01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:53,830\nme that never happens.\n\n1191\n01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:58,140\nSo we're gonna revisit this\ndocument over and over again.\n\n1192\n01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,840\nEvery time we have a brainstorm meeting,\nevery time we send out a survey and\n\n1193\n01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,550\nwe start to get this information back,\nwe identify new requirements and\n\n1194\n01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:06,620\nwe throw them on here.\n\n1195\n01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,490\nSo I've got room for seven, right?\n\n1196\n01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:14,290\nBut you just keep adding somehow, there.\n\n1197\n01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:16,910\nSo we just keep adding\nas we've got more and\n\n1198\n01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,600\nkeep fleshing it out until we've got\nall the various ones that we need.\n\n1199\n01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,656\nAnd now we've got our\nrequirements document.\n\n1200\n01:01:22,656 --> 01:01:25,772\nJust a straight-up list\nof the requirements.\n\n1201\n01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:32,270\nAll right, this is a slightly\nliving document at this point.\n\n1202\n01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:38,530\nWhen the planning phase ends, this should\nbe treated as if it's set in stone,\n\n1203\n01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:43,390\nbecause all the planning you've done is\nbuilt around meeting these requirements.\n\n1204\n01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:46,880\nAnd if these requirements change,\nyour plan is thrown out the window, right?\n\n1205\n01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,900\nSo while we're in the planning\nphase this can change.\n\n1206\n01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,280\nIt can change regularly.\n\n1207\n01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:57,110\nBut when we go to move from planning\nto executing, we do a freeze.\n\n1208\n01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:58,220\nAnd we say that's it.\n\n1209\n01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:01,090\nThese are the requirements.\n\n1210\n01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,029\nThis is what we're gonna do.\n\n1211\n01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:08,020\nIf there needs to be a change, we'll have\nto institute a change management process.\n\n1212\n01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,960\nWe'll have to get it approved and\n\n1213\n01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,700\nwe'll have the opportunity to reject\nthe change, if we want, at that point.\n\n1214\n01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,115\nAt this stage,\nwe probably can't reject the change.\n\n1215\n01:02:16,115 --> 01:02:18,560\nIf If the sponsor says\nthis is what I want,\n\n1216\n01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,080\nthen we're gonna need to put it in there,\nbecause they're the sponsor and\n\n1217\n01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,290\nwe're still in planning,\nso we can account for it.\n\n1218\n01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,930\nBut just keep in mind with each of\nthese requirements that we add,\n\n1219\n01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:33,570\nwe still have to remember this guy.\n\n1220\n01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:38,410\nThe requirements are going to\naffect our budget and our schedule.\n\n1221\n01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:42,060\nThe more requirements you have, the more\nmoney it's gonna take to meet them and\n\n1222\n01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,200\nthe more time it's gonna take to complete.\n\n1223\n01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,040\nSo don't go crazy.\n\n1224\n01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,760\nAnd that's why it's important to\ncategorize, because we can say,\n\n1225\n01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,100\nI have no idea how much this\nstuff is going to cost yet.\n\n1226\n01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,530\nI'm just putting it in here.\n\n1227\n01:02:53,530 --> 01:03:00,210\nI don't know how long it's gonna\ntake me to produce five prototypes.\n\n1228\n01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:07,870\nAnd the stakeholder that did this will be,\nwe'll just say me.\n\n1229\n01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,320\nMe who can't even spell my own name.\n\n1230\n01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,500\nThere we go.\n\n1231\n01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,140\nWe'll say this is a secondary objective.\n\n1232\n01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:18,050\nAnd it's maybe the highest priority\nof the secondary objectives.\n\n1233\n01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:20,660\nNow when I go and look at it and\nI find out, well,\n\n1234\n01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:23,490\nwe don't wanna produce five prototypes\nbecause we only came up with\n\n1235\n01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:26,960\nthree designs, so\nwe don't need five prototypes anymore.\n\n1236\n01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,705\nWe might do a change ticket that comes\nback and changes this to three prototypes.\n\n1237\n01:03:30,705 --> 01:03:35,550\nCuz if I don't change it, at the end of\nthe project, even though we didn't need\n\n1238\n01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,930\nfive and we only need three, if it\nstill says I should've produced five,\n\n1239\n01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,980\nI didn't meet my requirements and\nthe project failed.\n\n1240\n01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,600\nEven though the project\nlooks like a success,\n\n1241\n01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,940\nif you don't live up to what you\ndocumentation promises, it is a failure.\n\n1242\n01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:49,750\nSo we need to make sure that we\ngo back and adjust these things.\n\n1243\n01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,410\nAll right, so continue to add this.\n\n1244\n01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,360\nAnd we may also find for money reasons.\n\n1245\n01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,150\nWe're running low on money.\n\n1246\n01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:02,440\nAs so we had a budget of $200,000.\n\n1247\n01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,040\nWe're creeping up on that limit and\n\n1248\n01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,620\nwe just don't have the money to\nproduce five prototypes anymore.\n\n1249\n01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,740\nSo maybe we make the decision\nto go down to three.\n\n1250\n01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,410\nWell this was a secondary objective\nanyway, so it's a good place to do a cut.\n\n1251\n01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:18,417\nWe could look for any optionals first to\ndo cuts, and then go to secondaries and\n\n1252\n01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:20,677\nonly cut primaries if\nwe absolutely had to.\n\n1253\n01:04:20,677 --> 01:04:28,710\nAll right, so that's the idea behind\nthe requirements documentation.\n\n1254\n01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:35,400\nNow the other document we talk about,\nif I can get back to my screen here,\n\n1255\n01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,630\nthere we go, is the requirements\ntraceability matrix, all right?\n\n1256\n01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:42,114\nWhere we tie these\nrequirements together and\n\n1257\n01:04:42,114 --> 01:04:45,064\nattach additional information about them,\nright?\n\n1258\n01:04:45,064 --> 01:04:49,780\nNow, the requirements traceability matrix,\na lot of information on that, all right?\n\n1259\n01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:53,720\nBasically, it has a bunch of stuff\nin there, it's identifying our\n\n1260\n01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,900\nbusiness needs, opportunities,\ngoals and objectives, right?\n\n1261\n01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:00,010\nThe things that our company requires\nof us which we should already know.\n\n1262\n01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:03,900\nWhat our objectives are but\nalso our project scope and\n\n1263\n01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,980\nwork breakdown structure deliverables.\n\n1264\n01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:09,130\nNow, we haven't talked about the WBS yet.\n\n1265\n01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:14,300\nBut the WBS is where we actually\nidentify the work that needs to be done.\n\n1266\n01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:18,110\nNot just these overall high-level\ndeliverables, these final products,\n\n1267\n01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:19,580\nbut how we get there.\n\n1268\n01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:22,170\nAnd so, we may put those in there,\n\n1269\n01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:25,420\nbecause they have to be performed\nto create the deliverable.\n\n1270\n01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,490\nI don't normally put them there, but\nyou can if you wanna be super thorough.\n\n1271\n01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,920\nAny design or\ndevelopment information can go in there.\n\n1272\n01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,990\nAnd the test strategy and\ntest scenarios for validating whether or\n\n1273\n01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:40,410\nnot you've met those requirements,\nthat information can be there.\n\n1274\n01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:42,790\nBut these are mostly\nhigh-level requirements.\n\n1275\n01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:45,040\nYou can go extremely detailed if you want.\n\n1276\n01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,260\nBut typically we're not going crazy\ndetailed here cuz we have a place for\n\n1277\n01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:48,850\nthat a little bit later.\n\n1278\n01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:55,020\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat a traceability matrix.\n\n1279\n01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:58,290\nLet's see I've got one\nin one of these windows.\n\n1280\n01:05:58,290 --> 01:05:59,700\nToo many windows, there we go.\n\n1281\n01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,210\nAll right, this is similar to\nthe requirements document.\n\n1282\n01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,730\nIt's pretty simple, it's just a table.\n\n1283\n01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,990\nAnd you'll see some of\nthe same information.\n\n1284\n01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:14,140\nWould it be crazy for\nthem to support pinch to zoom in this?\n\n1285\n01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:16,890\nThere we go.\n\n1286\n01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,690\nAll right, so we have an ID.\n\n1287\n01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:22,910\nThis should match the ID over on\nthe requirements document, right?\n\n1288\n01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:29,350\nSo remember requirement number two was\nthe produce five prototypes, right?\n\n1289\n01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:33,960\nThat was my requirement number two in this\ndocument produce five prototypes, right?\n\n1290\n01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,230\nSo over here I'm basically coming in and\nspecifying the same thing,\n\n1291\n01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:39,600\nthis is a secondary objective.\n\n1292\n01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,670\nI dont think I had category\nin the other one, did I?\n\n1293\n01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:43,770\nOh, actually that was my, shoot.\n\n1294\n01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:47,650\nThis one was priority one,\nsecondary, the column was backwards.\n\n1295\n01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,520\nAll right,\nthe source was me personally, right?\n\n1296\n01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,470\nMaybe the source isn't me.\n\n1297\n01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:54,529\nMaybe the source is the EPA.\n\n1298\n01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:56,840\nMaybe this is an environmental concern.\n\n1299\n01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,050\nMaybe the source is the US government,\nright,\n\n1300\n01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:04,110\nthis is a HIPPA compliance or\nsomething like that.\n\n1301\n01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:06,000\nSo the source may come from outside.\n\n1302\n01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,980\nMaybe it's because we're\nISO 9000 certified, right?\n\n1303\n01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:15,000\nSo you put that in as the source so people\ncan identify how critical this is, right?\n\n1304\n01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,140\nBut the source here is me and so,\nif anybody disagrees with this,\n\n1305\n01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,320\nthey know who to go to now.\n\n1306\n01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,733\nAnd oh, let's go to Don and\nsee if we can adjust for that.\n\n1307\n01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:25,846\nNow is where we start to get into\nthe things that are different\n\n1308\n01:07:25,846 --> 01:07:26,600\nthan the other side.\n\n1309\n01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,210\nWell, not totally different,\nwe have validation over here, right?\n\n1310\n01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:35,090\nWhich that one, did we say,\nwhat did we say, QC/QA?\n\n1311\n01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:40,290\nSo I'll just put that same thing, and\nI'm just putting in general QC/QA.\n\n1312\n01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:44,930\nWhen we talk about quality control later\non, in the quality control process,\n\n1313\n01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:49,730\nwe'll create the tests we need to verify\nthe functionality of our product, and\n\n1314\n01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,830\neach test will have a number.\n\n1315\n01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:58,372\nAnd so you would actually put in here\nthat this would be QC number 20.3.\n\n1316\n01:07:58,372 --> 01:08:01,230\nRight, so go and\nfind test number 20.3, and\n\n1317\n01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:03,890\nthat's the test we run\nto validate this one.\n\n1318\n01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:05,260\nSo may be very specific like that.\n\n1319\n01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:09,700\nAll right, what is my objective?\n\n1320\n01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:14,080\nWhy do I wanna produce five prototypes,\nokay?\n\n1321\n01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:19,769\nAnd I'm gonna put in the reason\nis to ensure multiple\n\n1322\n01:08:19,769 --> 01:08:24,435\noptions for focus group testing, right?\n\n1323\n01:08:24,435 --> 01:08:28,222\nI don't wanna just show my focus group\none model and ask their opinion on it.\n\n1324\n01:08:28,222 --> 01:08:31,120\nI wanna show them five different models,\nfive different possibilities.\n\n1325\n01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,500\nAnd maybe they like one\nmore than the others.\n\n1326\n01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,314\nOr maybe there's various aspects of\neach one that they like that they wanna\n\n1327\n01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:37,880\ncombine.\n\n1328\n01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,290\nBut I wanna ensure the best possible\nresults from my focus group.\n\n1329\n01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:43,470\nDo I have to have this?\n\n1330\n01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:45,310\nNo, that's why I made a secondary.\n\n1331\n01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:48,430\nBut this is gonna make my\nfocus groups more effective.\n\n1332\n01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:49,500\nThat's my objective.\n\n1333\n01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,100\nThat's why I'm doing it, okay?\n\n1334\n01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,160\nThen my work breakdown\nstructured deliverable.\n\n1335\n01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,810\nAgain, we still havent done the WBS yet,\nthat's coming up.\n\n1336\n01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:03,400\nBut with the WBS we're identifying all the\nwork that we would do to get this done.\n\n1337\n01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,840\nAnd there'll be items in there that\nidentify where these prototypes are made.\n\n1338\n01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:13,700\nAnd so the deliverable itself will have\na code number like 1.2, all right?\n\n1339\n01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,157\nSo I can go to my work\nbreakdown structure and,\n\n1340\n01:09:16,157 --> 01:09:20,067\nlet me just show an example of what\na work breakdown structure looks like.\n\n1341\n01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,660\nAll right.\n\n1342\n01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:28,970\nOkay, this is what a work\nbreakdown structure looks like.\n\n1343\n01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:31,070\nAnd we'll cover this\nmore in depth later on.\n\n1344\n01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:35,360\nBut you have deliverables,\nthe things that your project produces.\n\n1345\n01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:39,580\nAnd there's work that has to take\nplace to create that deliverable.\n\n1346\n01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,940\nSo if I want five prototypes,\n\n1347\n01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:45,460\nlet's say that creating the prototypes\nas deliverable number one, right?\n\n1348\n01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:48,290\nSo well first off I need to fix\nmy other document, don't I?\n\n1349\n01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,710\nSo it's gonna be deliverable number one,\nall right?\n\n1350\n01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:57,958\nWell, in deliverable number one, what does\nit take to make those prototypes, right?\n\n1351\n01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:00,446\nI've got to have a designer\ncome up with a design,\n\n1352\n01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:03,480\nI have to have somebody buy some clay and\nhave a studio ready.\n\n1353\n01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,680\nI have to have an artist\nwho can take that clay and\n\n1354\n01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,360\nsculpt it into the design that\nthe engineer came up with.\n\n1355\n01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:13,150\nSo there's a lot of actual,\nphysical work that has to be done.\n\n1356\n01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:18,849\nAnd so, I'm gonna identify all of that\nright here, activity 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.\n\n1357\n01:10:18,849 --> 01:10:21,247\nAn activity might even\nhave sub-activities.\n\n1358\n01:10:21,247 --> 01:10:26,194\n2.1.1, 2.1.2, so I'm gonna put in\nhere all of the stuff that needs to\n\n1359\n01:10:26,194 --> 01:10:28,860\nget done to get this thing created.\n\n1360\n01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,210\nAnd the traceability matrix\nis helping me find that.\n\n1361\n01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:34,290\nSo when I come over here and\nI look and I say,\n\n1362\n01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:37,890\nman we gotta get this requirement done,\nwhat work is involved?\n\n1363\n01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:40,420\nWhat does it actually\ntake to get this done?\n\n1364\n01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:43,770\nIf I failed my QC check,\ndid some work not get done?\n\n1365\n01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:44,970\nWhat was supposed to happen?\n\n1366\n01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:47,310\nWell, it's WBS deliverable one.\n\n1367\n01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,540\nLet me jump over to my\nwork breakdown structure.\n\n1368\n01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,970\nHere's deliverable number one.\n\n1369\n01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:52,750\nDid all this stuff happen?\n\n1370\n01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,100\nDid this work get done?\n\n1371\n01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,640\nAnd if it didn't, why not, right?\n\n1372\n01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,780\nSo that's what the tracability\nmatrix helps with.\n\n1373\n01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:03,030\nAnd then lastly we've got a metric and\n\n1374\n01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:07,890\nthe metric is if we have like\nvarying degrees of success.\n\n1375\n01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,511\nWith a focus group,\n\n1376\n01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:16,409\nwe might say 80% of respondents have to\nbe happy with the product, all right?\n\n1377\n01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:18,857\nSo we have a QC, or\na QA, a check that runs,\n\n1378\n01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:22,950\nthat tells us what the current\nresults are from the focus groups.\n\n1379\n01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,420\nAnd if we get back that only\n60% of the people like it,\n\n1380\n01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:27,530\nwell then we didn't meet that requirement.\n\n1381\n01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,797\nSo we'd go back and\nwe'd do five more designs, and\n\n1382\n01:11:29,797 --> 01:11:32,190\nwe'd submit them again until\nwe finally get to that.\n\n1383\n01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:38,786\nSo we might say like 80% approval rates.\n\n1384\n01:11:38,786 --> 01:11:39,930\nThere, all right.\n\n1385\n01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:43,090\nSo when we can get 80% of\nthe people to like this thing,\n\n1386\n01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,150\nthen we'll run with it, right?\n\n1387\n01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:46,840\nSo whatever metric it is we're using, and\n\n1388\n01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,660\nI'm just making this up\noff the top of my head.\n\n1389\n01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:51,430\nSo yours, you have to think\nabout your environment and\n\n1390\n01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:54,765\nwhat it is that you're measuring to come\nup with the appropriate metric for it.\n\n1391\n01:11:54,765 --> 01:11:56,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1392\n01:11:56,090 --> 01:12:01,180\n>> All right, so on the left side\nI've got requirement information.\n\n1393\n01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,050\nThat's pretty much coming right\nout of the requirements document.\n\n1394\n01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,940\nSo a lot of people when\nthey fill this out,\n\n1395\n01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:10,040\nthey start filling out the traceability\nmatrix first, and then\n\n1396\n01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,200\nthe requirements document later, or they\njust don't do a requirements document.\n\n1397\n01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,370\nAnd they just have the traceability\nmatrix and they use that.\n\n1398\n01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,170\nYou can do it, remember it's up to you.\n\n1399\n01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,341\nBut on the exam you may\nsee these separate so\n\n1400\n01:12:19,341 --> 01:12:21,822\nI wanna present it exactly\nhow it is in the PMBOK.\n\n1401\n01:12:21,822 --> 01:12:22,682\nAll right?\n\n1402\n01:12:22,682 --> 01:12:25,317\nAnd then on the right side is where\nwe have that real traceability.\n\n1403\n01:12:25,317 --> 01:12:29,822\nThe deliverable that's required, the\nobjective that we're trying to achieve,\n\n1404\n01:12:29,822 --> 01:12:33,249\nthe metric in the validation,\nall right there in that matrix.\n\n1405\n01:12:34,874 --> 01:12:35,920\nAll in the matrix.\n\n1406\n01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,430\nRight?\n\n1407\n01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,000\n>> It is.\n\n1408\n01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,926\n>> We need Keanu Reeves to come in\nhere and do some bad acting for us.\n\n1409\n01:12:40,926 --> 01:12:42,179\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so.\n\n1410\n01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:46,005\n[LAUGH] It can't be worse than our acting.\n\n1411\n01:12:46,005 --> 01:12:47,180\n[LAUGH] All right,\n\n1412\n01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:51,040\nso that's basically what all is going to\nhappen as we move through this process.\n\n1413\n01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,180\nAnd let me just bring the process back up.\n\n1414\n01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:57,800\nSo this is the collect requirements,\nhere we go.\n\n1415\n01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,640\nAll right, once we've got all of our\n\n1416\n01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,510\nrequirements in place, and we know what\nneeds to be done, only then are we\n\n1417\n01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:11,470\nreally ready to draft that scope\nstatement, which is pretty important.\n\n1418\n01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:15,210\nSo we should at this point be able\nto draft the scope statement or\n\n1419\n01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:20,170\nwork on our WBS if I go back to the PMBOC,\nwe kind of have that choice now.\n\n1420\n01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,150\nSo we just collected requirements.\n\n1421\n01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:25,780\nWe can move right on to defining\nthe scope, or we could skip over and\n\n1422\n01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,690\ngo to the work breakdown structure and\ncome back to the scope later.\n\n1423\n01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,940\nIt's kind of up to us at this point,\nwe could go either way.\n\n1424\n01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,360\nPersonally, I like to go and\ndefine the scope next.\n\n1425\n01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,520\nI know the requirements now, so\nlet's put some limits on there.\n\n1426\n01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,190\nRight?\n\n1427\n01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:40,490\nNow, we've only done one pass\non this requirements document.\n\n1428\n01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:42,160\nRight?\nI just made stuff up.\n\n1429\n01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,070\nNow is when we take this document,\nand we go back to our stakeholders.\n\n1430\n01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:50,720\nWe go back to our team, and\nwe say okay, everybody look over this.\n\n1431\n01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,260\nCan you think of anything we missed?\n\n1432\n01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,830\nAnd maybe we'll add some more things.\n\n1433\n01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:54,925\nNow, we have version 1.1.\n\n1434\n01:13:54,925 --> 01:13:56,310\nAnd then we send that out.\n\n1435\n01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:57,490\nCan anybody thing of anything else?\n\n1436\n01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:58,142\nWe add some more stuff.\n\n1437\n01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,320\nVersion 1.2, right?\n\n1438\n01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:04,180\nAnd you keep doing that until you've\ngot one that you're ready to act on.\n\n1439\n01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:05,960\nAnd as the project manager,\nyou sign off on it.\n\n1440\n01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,200\nYou say, this is cool, I'm good with this.\n\n1441\n01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,630\nAnd then we start to act upon it.\n\n1442\n01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:13,670\nBut it still might change\nwhile we're in planning.\n\n1443\n01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:14,730\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n1444\n01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:16,552\nYou may have to come back to this many,\nmany times.\n\n1445\n01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:19,100\nAll right.\n\n1446\n01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,480\nWell the next thing we're gonna move\ninto is the scope statement, and\n\n1447\n01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,830\nthen the work break down structure.\n\n1448\n01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:28,302\nSo you know Ronnie,\nthat might actually be better to put,\n\n1449\n01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:31,052\nlet's see how do we want to do this?\n\n1450\n01:14:31,052 --> 01:14:32,168\nShould we put that in the next episode?\n\n1451\n01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:33,514\nOr do you think?\n\n1452\n01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:35,718\n>> Sure.\n\n1453\n01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:37,770\n>> [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] I\nhate starting a topic and\n\n1454\n01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:40,750\nthen having to end the episode cuz we only\nhave so much more time left in this one.\n\n1455\n01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:44,780\nSo why don't we do this, why don't we go\nahead and wrap up this episode and when we\n\n1456\n01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:48,090\nget back, for those of you watching live\nwe'll come right back in a few minutes.\n\n1457\n01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:52,420\nBut for those of you watching recorded,\nin the next episode, we're gonna jump into\n\n1458\n01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:56,300\nthat scope statement and the WBS and\nkinda wrap up this part of the planning.\n\n1459\n01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,580\nSo, we'll move into that.\n\n1460\n01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:00,367\nBut yeah,\nthis is all pretty important stuff, right?\n\n1461\n01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:02,350\nEarly on, easy to make mistakes here.\n\n1462\n01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:04,590\nIf you miss a requirement, bad news.\n\n1463\n01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:05,790\nAll right, so stay tuned for that.\n\n1464\n01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:06,740\nLet me just remind you

and welcome back.\n\n4\n00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:38,490\nTo another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,660\nI'm your host Don Pezet back\nagain with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,470\nHow's is going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,190\n>> It is going swell this morning.\n\n8\n00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,025\nWe started off the day with\na Bette Midler song, so we are ready go.\n\n9\n00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:51,170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One of my all time favorites, right?\n\n10\n00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,190\nI celebrate her entire collection.\n\n11\n00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:53,735\n>> Constantly.\n\n12\n00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:58,850\n[LAUGH] The guys in the office\nare tormenting me today with bad music.\n\n13\n00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,283\nBut Miller, that pretty much sums it up.\n\n14\n00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:06,440\n[LAUGH] All right, so today we're\ngonna be taking a look at, well,\n\n15\n00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,690\nour scope statement Statement.\n\n16\n00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,000\nIn our last episode we started\ntalking about what's involved in\n\n17\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,600\ncreating our project scope?\n\n18\n00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,920\nThat's the knowledge area that we're in,\nand\n\n19\n00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,815\nactually here let me get my pinblock\npulled back up and we'll kind of jump but\n\n20\n00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:27,785\nbasically we started talking about our\nscope statement and how its important.\n\n21\n00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:31,005\nAnd how we cant really just jump\nright into the scope statement.\n\n22\n00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:34,788\nHow we actually need to jump into\nsome other things first and so\n\n23\n00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:37,535\nwe dealt with requirements yesterday.\n\n24\n00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:41,870\nWhat do we actually require our project\nto do to consider it successful?\n\n25\n00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,620\nSo that's what we were looking at\nthere was collector requirements 5.2,\n\n26\n00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,060\nnow we are going to take a look at 5.3,\nwhich is define the scope.\n\n27\n00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,050\nWe probably have enough information\nnow to create our scope statement.\n\n28\n00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,580\nI say probably, because we may have\nto revisit this a few times and\n\n29\n00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,900\nI know I've said it\na hundred times by now.\n\n30\n00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,550\nIt's okay here in planning for\nus to do that.\n\n31\n00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,020\nWe make adjustments until we\nfind what fits perfect, right?\n\n32\n00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,820\nSo let's take a look\nat that defined scope.\n\n33\n00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,560\nWell, before I throw up that\nprocess diagram on the screen,\n\n34\n00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,180\nlet me just start with\nsomething really simple.\n\n35\n00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:20,020\nA scope statement is, well,\nI mentioned earlier that the project\n\n36\n00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,720\ncharter was the single most important\ndocument to the project as a whole, right?\n\n37\n00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,300\nBecause it's what gives the project\nmanager authority over the project and\n\n38\n00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,380\nit's what allows the project to kick off.\n\n39\n00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,450\nSo from the perspective of\nthe project as a whole,\n\n40\n00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,470\nyes the project charter is\nthe most important document.\n\n41\n00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,130\nThe scope statement is\na close second place\n\n42\n00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,470\nbecause the scope statement is what's\ngoing to define beyond a doubt\n\n43\n00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,630\nexactly what it is we need to achieve for\nthis project to be successful.\n\n44\n00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,590\nWe already did that in\nthe charter right in our charter\n\n45\n00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,020\nwe put some high level statements in\nthere, but it's not very detailed.\n\n46\n00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,390\nIt's not really fully objective,\n\n47\n00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,260\nthere might be some subjective\nstatements in there.\n\n48\n00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,800\nIt's not really what we want to live and\n\n49\n00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,430\ndie by because there's\ntoo many gray areas.\n\n50\n00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,240\nSo as we prepare our scope statement we've\nreally gotta have our ducks in a row.\n\n51\n00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,260\nWe've got to make sure we\nunderstand all our details,\n\n52\n00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,530\nwhat it is we need to achieve and\nwe put it here.\n\n53\n00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,390\nAnd the scope statement we are gonna look\nat throughout the life of our project.\n\n54\n00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,980\nYou will constantly be referring\nback to your scope statement.\n\n55\n00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,680\nThe charter you'll probably\nnever look at again.\n\n56\n00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,500\nRight.\nIt got signed, it's extremely important\n\n57\n00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,770\nbecause it's what gives us that authority\nbut you don't need to go back to it\n\n58\n00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,460\nbecause we're going to replace everything\nthat's in it with other documents.\n\n59\n00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,080\nWe're going to supersede them with\nother ones that are more accurate.\n\n60\n00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,610\nThe scope statement is the first of these.\n\n61\n00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,210\nNow the scope statement,\nin it's most basic form, is a paragraph.\n\n62\n00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,630\nYou write a paragraph,\nthis is what you're gonna do.\n\n63\n00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,670\nBut the more detailed you can be,\nthe better off you'll be all right?\n\n64\n00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,090\nSo let's start, I'm going to do this one\nin a little different order, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,330\nLet's start with what\na scope document looks like.\n\n66\n00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,310\nI'm gonna bring up my template for\n\n67\n00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,830\na scope document which I've\ngot around here somewhere.\n\n68\n00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,560\nWhere is my project scope statement?\n\n69\n00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,585\nThere it is.\n\n70\n00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,440\nAll right.\n\n71\n00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,270\nSo here is an example of\na Project Scope Statement.\n\n72\n00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:21,520\nAnd what you'll see is we have several\ndifferent things that can go in here.\n\n73\n00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,190\nAnd you can be extremely detailed or\nyou can be a little less detailed,\n\n74\n00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,810\nsmaller projects you might\nnot need crazy detail.\n\n75\n00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,870\nBut you're typically going to want\nto be very thorough here, all right.\n\n76\n00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,170\nWe're going to put our\nproject scope description.\n\n77\n00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,770\nA description of our project,\nwhat it is we're going to achieve,\n\n78\n00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,070\nwhat it is we intend to do.\n\n79\n00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,850\nAnd you just write it out\nplain English style, you know.\n\n80\n00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,480\nDon't use any crazy technical\nterms if you can avoid it.\n\n81\n00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,660\nLay out the information about the project,\nall right.\n\n82\n00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,200\nThe project deliverables, that's going to\nbe what we are going to be producing and\n\n83\n00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,580\nwhen you produce something, it's really\neasy to, in our mind, lock into the idea\n\n84\n00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,340\nof a tangible object, that we're going\nto produce a physical item, right?\n\n85\n00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,580\nSo like arcade cabinet example,\nwe are going to create an arcade cabinet,\n\n86\n00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,280\na physical item, right?\n\n87\n00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,750\nBut you might not be\nproducing a physical item,\n\n88\n00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,670\nit might be some intangible like you\nmight be doing a service improvement.\n\n89\n00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,070\nI gave the example in the last episode\nthat if you work for a manufacturing plant\n\n90\n00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,290\nwhen you manufacture 1,000 pairs of\njeans maybe you have a 20% defect rate.\n\n91\n00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,130\nSo maybe your project is to\nget down to a 10% defect rate.\n\n92\n00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,830\nRight?\nSo\n\n93\n00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,600\nit's the process, what you're doing to\nchange the company that you're creating.\n\n94\n00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,290\nThat's your deliverable, right?\n\n95\n00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,870\nSo we'll list whatever those deliverables\nare right here to say when this project is\n\n96\n00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,050\ndone this is what we're going to give you.\n\n97\n00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,930\nWe're going to give you a fully\nfunctional arcade cabinet,\n\n98\n00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,930\nwe're gonna give you a four bedroom,\ntwo bathroom house.\n\n99\n00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,690\nWe're going to give you\na fully redundant data center,\n\n100\n00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,680\nlocated in another state that you can fail\nover to in under three minutes, right?\n\n101\n00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,100\nWe specify what that\ndeliverable is going to be.\n\n102\n00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,020\nThen, your project acceptance criteria,\nright?\n\n103\n00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,280\nHow do we know that we're done?\n\n104\n00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,065\nIf we meet this list of requirements\nwithin these range of tolerances,\n\n105\n00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:15,550\nthen we're done and if you disagree,\n\n106\n00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,990\nit doesn't matter because right here\nwe specified what had to be met.\n\n107\n00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,655\nAnd if we met that, then it's done.\n\n108\n00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:21,565\nAll right?\n\n109\n00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:24,285\nThis is where it's really important\nto make sure that we don't have\n\n110\n00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:25,295\nany subjective statements.\n\n111\n00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:28,975\nAnything where two people can\ninterpret it in different ways.\n\n112\n00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:32,315\nSo, I want my website to be fast.\n\n113\n00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:33,200\nOkay?\n\n114\n00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000\nHow fast?\n\n115\n00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,530\nRight.\n\n116\n00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,468\nHow do we measure fast because fast to me\nmight be different than fast to Ronnie.\n\n117\n00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:42,443\nWell that's definitely true [LAUGH] right\nbecause you've got that satellite internet\n\n118\n00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,530\nat home [LAUGH] So\npeople's perception of fast is different.\n\n119\n00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,800\nSo we need to say the page load\ntime needs to be under one second.\n\n120\n00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,390\nRight?\n\n121\n00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,180\nNow I've got something measurable and\nif it's under one second and\n\n122\n00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,100\nthen the original sponsor says,\nwell it still feels kind of slow to me,\n\n123\n00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,230\nthen you can say,\ntoo bad, it's right here.\n\n124\n00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,030\nWe said one second,\nif you want it less than one second.\n\n125\n00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,640\nWell, we can do another project, or we\ncan go back and we can update our scope,\n\n126\n00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,760\nmake some changes, and then move forward\nwith trying to get it even lower, right?\n\n127\n00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,810\nBut it needs to be right here.\n\n128\n00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,940\nThat's why we're gonna refer\nback to this document so much.\n\n129\n00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,580\nWe're gonna live and\ndie by this document right here.\n\n130\n00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,049\nIt's gonna determine our success.\n\n131\n00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,250\nNow one thing I like to do,\nis when we list our deliverables and\n\n132\n00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,390\nour project scope description,\nthat's what we're going to do,\n\n133\n00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,050\nI like to list what we're not going to do,\nall right?\n\n134\n00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,140\nThis is a good idea.\n\n135\n00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,070\nIn fact, let's do an example here.\n\n136\n00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,431\nI worked on a project a few\nyears ago that was a,\n\n137\n00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:44,380\nI'll call it a medium sized project.\n\n138\n00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,212\nIt was I worked for a bank and\n\n139\n00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:51,314\nwe had a disaster recovery facility\nthat the headquarters were in Seattle,\n\n140\n00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:55,320\nWashington and\nthe DR site was in Portland, Oregon right.\n\n141\n00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,180\nSo separate state,\nit was a few hours away.\n\n142\n00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,360\nAnd the DR site,\nit was getting pretty old.\n\n143\n00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,010\nIt hadn't been kept up to date.\n\n144\n00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,120\nThere were some systems that were\nproduction systems that weren't\n\n145\n00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,750\nin the DR site.\n\n146\n00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,590\nIt was a building that we rented,\nor leased.\n\n147\n00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,860\nWe didn't actually own it.\n\n148\n00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,050\nSo there were a number of different\nthings that were of concern for us.\n\n149\n00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,670\n>> Right.\n>> So we\n\n150\n00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,700\ndecided we needed a new\ndisaster recovery center.\n\n151\n00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,350\nAnd so we created a project.\n\n152\n00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,240\nWe kicked it off and said,\nwe want to create a new data center,\n\n153\n00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,340\na disaster recovery center that\nrecreates all of our necessary systems.\n\n154\n00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,720\nWe weren't very picky about were is went.\n\n155\n00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,020\nSo, we had some options there\nthat were part of the project,\n\n156\n00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,840\nas far as, selecting where\nthis location would be, and\n\n157\n00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,820\nselecting who the hosting provider,\nor the facility was, and so on.\n\n158\n00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,000\nBut, as we stated specifying\nour requirements,\n\n159\n00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,520\none of the system admin team,\nactually this is an admin manager.\n\n160\n00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,600\nHe came forward and\nhe said well, you know.\n\n161\n00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,380\nAt the time, so this was in 2007, 2008.\n\n162\n00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,620\nWindows Server 2003 was the standard\noperating system at the time for the bank.\n\n163\n00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,430\nWe still had many servers that were\nrunning Windows Server 2000 at the time.\n\n164\n00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,860\nAnd, so the sysadmin manager said, well\nhey, if we're gonna be moving this data\n\n165\n00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,980\ncenter, now would be a great time\nto upgrade those servers too.\n\n166\n00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,560\nLet's go ahead and\n\n167\n00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,720\nupgrade them, cuz they're gonna\ngo offline when we move them.\n\n168\n00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,940\nAnd, we looked at it, and we said,\n\n169\n00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,210\nI understand that you want to upgrade\nthese to server 2003, I understand.\n\n170\n00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,200\nAnd I understand it looks like a great\nopportunity to do it because the service\n\n171\n00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,420\nwill be offline.\n\n172\n00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,560\nBut here's the risk,\nwe move the servers to this new site and\n\n173\n00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,260\nall of a sudden they don't work.\n\n174\n00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,370\nWell, is it a problem with the new site?\n\n175\n00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,770\nOr is it a problem with\nthe upgrade that you did?\n\n176\n00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,390\nRight.\n\n177\n00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,460\nToo many changes at once can\nresult in too many problems.\n\n178\n00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,530\nSo when we created that scope,\nwhat we did is we put a specific\n\n179\n00:09:52,530 --> 00:10:01,530\nexclusion that said server\nconfigurations will not be updated.\n\n180\n00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,200\nRight?\n\n181\n00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,035\nServers will be moved or\n\n182\n00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:10,320\nreplaced as is, Right?\n\n183\n00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,680\nWhich meant if we had a server\nthat was really old and\n\n184\n00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,280\nwe had to buy new hardware that was fine\nwe'd buy new hardware, but the operating\n\n185\n00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,880\nsystem would stay the same, the software\nconfiguration would stay the same.\n\n186\n00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,190\nWe didn't want to make changes there\nbecause it introduced too much risk.\n\n187\n00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,960\n>> Right.\n>> Into the project, we had a window.\n\n188\n00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,450\nSo we were FDIC insured and\nthe FDIC said if we ever had a disaster,\n\n189\n00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,160\nwe had 72 hours to be back and\nservicing our customers right.\n\n190\n00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,570\nNow this was the DR site, so\n\n191\n00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,220\nif I shut the DR site down my\ncustomers don't even know it.\n\n192\n00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,770\nRight.\n\n193\n00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,150\nSo we had a three day window.\n\n194\n00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,200\nWe could turn off one center, turn on\nthe other, and be back in business.\n\n195\n00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,970\nWell if any problem happened we\nhad three days to resolve it.\n\n196\n00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,910\nAnd if it didn't get\nresolved in three days,\n\n197\n00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,900\nwell our customers might not know it.\n\n198\n00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,510\nBut what if we had a failure at\nthe headquarters at the same time, right?\n\n199\n00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,120\nIf the headquarters had a failure, and the\nDR site had a failure, we had three days,\n\n200\n00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,500\nright, and\nwe just didn't want to take that risk.\n\n201\n00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,280\nOur customers were more important and\nso we put a freeze on that.\n\n202\n00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,560\nIt's a good idea to put exclusions in to\nspecifically say we're not going to do\n\n203\n00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,330\nthis, all right, and so we may have\nother things we chose to list in\n\n204\n00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,470\nthere you know that we're not gonna bring\non new personnel at this time or whatever.\n\n205\n00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,820\nSpecifically put that in here, so\nit's right here in the project black and\n\n206\n00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,700\nwhite, nobody can argue\nagainst it later on.\n\n207\n00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,510\nBest to have that up front.\n\n208\n00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,760\nSo you're kinda running with that,\nfor the project scope description.\n\n209\n00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,550\nFor that one it was this project.\n\n210\n00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,050\nWe'll see the creation of a new disaster\n\n211\n00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,196\nrecovery center at\na location to be determined\n\n212\n00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:58,960\nb2y the project, right?\n\n213\n00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,860\nIn other words, we haven't picked the\nlocation yet, that's going to be one of\n\n214\n00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,350\nthe chores of the project, is to go in and\nfind that location, right?\n\n215\n00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:16,900\nThe selected location must\nmeet all the requirements\n\n216\n00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,990\nspecified by the FDIC, as well\n\n217\n00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:33,600\nas meet all requirements of the SAS70,\nwe'll just say that.\n\n218\n00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,440\nWhich is a US banking regulation that\nhas all sorts of requirements for\n\n219\n00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,123\nyour data center and how the data works.\n\n220\n00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:44,984\nAnd then finally all existing\n\n221\n00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:50,040\nDR functions must be recreated\n\n222\n00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,520\nin the new facility right.\n\n223\n00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,620\nAnd then we added in\nthe exclusion which said\n\n224\n00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:07,570\nany production servers\nnot currently present\n\n225\n00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,360\nin the DR facility will not be\nadded as a part of this project.\n\n226\n00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,870\nAnd the reason we specified that was,\nagain,\n\n227\n00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,810\nwe don't want to make too many changes.\n\n228\n00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,830\nWe were physically moving\nthis data center, so\n\n229\n00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,390\nwe don't want to add too much stuff yet.\n\n230\n00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,750\nOnce the data center is moved and now it's\nin the new place, then we can add stuff.\n\n231\n00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,190\nThat can be project 2.0 or 3.0 or 2.1 or\nwhatever, but not a part of this one.\n\n232\n00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,580\nWe want to deal with\nthe physical move first,\n\n233\n00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,190\nlet's get that done and taken care of.\n\n234\n00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,366\nSo our project deliverable\nwas a fully functional DR\n\n235\n00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:49,609\nfacility that replicates the existing or\nthe functionality,\n\n236\n00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:58,020\nof our existing facility, or\nour existing DR facility.\n\n237\n00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,990\nSo that was the big deal.\n\n238\n00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,020\nWe needed a fully functional\nfacility in a new location.\n\n239\n00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,050\nThat was what we were delivering.\n\n240\n00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,720\nRight?\n\n241\n00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,900\nThe project acceptance criteria for\nus was really simple.\n\n242\n00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,600\nAll right?\n\n243\n00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,180\nWe had a BRP, a Business Resumption Plan,\nthat said If a failure happened\n\n244\n00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,310\nat the headquarters, here's this book full\nof instructions that you would follow\n\n245\n00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,500\nto fail us over to the disaster recovery\nsite and we'd be back in business.\n\n246\n00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,760\nSo project acceptance criteria\nwas,The deliverables will be accepted\n\n247\n00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,274\nonce it has been demonstrated that\n\n248\n00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:43,980\nthe current BRP can be followed\n\n249\n00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:50,380\nsuccessfully using the new facility.\n\n250\n00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,000\nAll right?\n\n251\n00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,550\nSo if we can take that\nbusiness presumption plan and\n\n252\n00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,190\ngo through it step by step.\n\n253\n00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,880\nAnd fail our company\nover to this new center.\n\n254\n00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,900\nIf that was a success,\nthen the DR site was done, right?\n\n255\n00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,050\nWe met the requirement.\n\n256\n00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,670\nThe new DR site was functional.\n\n257\n00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,290\nIf we couldn't,\nif we tried to fail over and\n\n258\n00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,440\nit didn't work, well,\nwe could fail over to the old site.\n\n259\n00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,810\nYou've done something wrong, right?\n\n260\n00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,180\nThat was our acceptance criteria.\n\n261\n00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,960\nThat is what we looked for.\n\n262\n00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,990\nWe do have other things up here that we\nneed to meet the SAS 70 requirements,\n\n263\n00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,980\nthat we need to meet\nthe FDIC requirements.\n\n264\n00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,310\nSo we do have other things, but\n\n265\n00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,030\nthe primary acceptance\ncriteria was that right there.\n\n266\n00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,600\nCan we fail over and complete our BRP?\n\n267\n00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,800\nIf we can, then we're good.\n\n268\n00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,680\n>> Constraints.\n\n269\n00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,950\n>> Constraints, so project constraints.\n\n270\n00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,090\nWhat are our three constraints, right?\n\n271\n00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:40,900\nWe've got.\n\n272\n00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,400\n>> Time.\n\n273\n00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:48,530\n>> Time and schedule,\nwe've got cost and budget.\n\n274\n00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,489\nThat's how I normally write that.\n\n275\n00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:55,510\nAnd then we've got our requirements and\nscope, right?\n\n276\n00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,230\nNow cope slash requirements,\nyou might think,\n\n277\n00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,360\nwell this is the scope statement,\nso this is the scope.\n\n278\n00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,330\nHow can I embed the scope in the scope?\n\n279\n00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,000\nWell, when you create\nyour requirements sheet.\n\n280\n00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,190\nActually if you watched our special\non the arcade cabinet project,\n\n281\n00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,180\nwe built our requirement sheet for\nthat and\n\n282\n00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,470\nwe came up with all the little\nthings that we required.\n\n283\n00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,900\nWell it's more than I want to put\nright here in the scope statement so\n\n284\n00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:27,710\nhere under my project constraints\nI may put, See Exhibit A.\n\n285\n00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,100\nAll right, and what's exhibit a gonna be?\n\n286\n00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100\nThat requirement sheet.\n\n287\n00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,770\nRight?\nThat requirement matrix or\n\n288\n00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,690\nwhatever it is that we chose to build,\nwhatever document we created for\n\n289\n00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,560\nour requirements.\n\n290\n00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,420\nWell attach that to our scope.\n\n291\n00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,940\nSo the scope itself is\nfairly high level here.\n\n292\n00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,230\nRight?\nAs far as stating what we're going to do\n\n293\n00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:49,370\nand so on, but then see exhibit A and you\ngo grab exhibit A and it might be 50 pages\n\n294\n00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,790\nlong of all the individual requirements\nin a software development project.\n\n295\n00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,030\nYou can guarantee it's gonna be.\n\n296\n00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,370\n>> Yeah.\n>> Several pages long.\n\n297\n00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,890\nEven for our arcade cabinet I\nthink we had to be in two pages.\n\n298\n00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> Of just different\n\n299\n00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,090\nthings that we needed to keep in mind\nas we moved forward on the project.\n\n300\n00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,830\nAll right?\n\n301\n00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,920\nOther things on the time and\nschedule, we set a completion date\n\n302\n00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,590\nof whatever, I think we did July 31st or\nsomething like that.\n\n303\n00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:21,225\nAnd then a cost budget we set At $2000,\nright?\n\n304\n00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:23,090\nNow, for this, actually hang on.\n\n305\n00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,950\nOkay, so we were doing\nthe disaster recovery site right?\n\n306\n00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,860\nSo there our budget was a little bit\nhigher, it was actually $500,000.\n\n307\n00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,850\nAnd our completion date then,\nI remember it very well, was October 31st.\n\n308\n00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,060\nBecause it was Halloween.\n\n309\n00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,420\nBasically the, you know,\n\n310\n00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,410\nhang on now I'm thinking back to it\nbecause this project was a while ago.\n\n311\n00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,810\nOctober 31st was actually\nour drop dead date.\n\n312\n00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,360\nWe had a lease on the building in\nPortland that ended on October 31st,\n\n313\n00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,285\nso we needed to be out of\nthere by October 31st.\n\n314\n00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:54,745\nBut with any good project,\n\n315\n00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:57,335\nyou don't want tot put yourself\non a hard limit like that.\n\n316\n00:17:57,335 --> 00:18:01,585\nSo we actually chose to\nchange it to do October 1st.\n\n317\n00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:05,270\nWe shot for October 1st because\nit didn't hurt us to end early.\n\n318\n00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,030\nYou had one month's lease\n>> Right.\n\n319\n00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,620\n>> That you had to pay if you were out of\nthere early, but that wasn't a big deal.\n\n320\n00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,150\nSo, you set a date like that, and that way\nif you have to push back to October 15th\n\n321\n00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,840\nor to October 31st, you're okay\nyou had some extra time to play so\n\n322\n00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,220\nwe left a little bit of padding there.\n\n323\n00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,940\nAll right, and\nthen lastly we've got project assumptions.\n\n324\n00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,540\nAnd we can come in here and specify oh,\nmy pagination is a little bit weird.\n\n325\n00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,160\nWe can specify anything that\nis semi uncertain, right?\n\n326\n00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,530\n>> Yeah, it's unusual right?\n\n327\n00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:41,330\nThis is where the Generic definitions\nof the pembot really get you here.\n\n328\n00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,130\nSo the way they define it is\nthe same way that you and\n\n329\n00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,580\nI would define the idea of an assumption.\n\n330\n00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,910\nIt says anything that we can take as\na certainty but without any proof at all.\n\n331\n00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,030\nSo in other words if Don was in the middle\nof this disaster recovery, well,\n\n332\n00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,500\nwhat if now there was a snowstorm in\nOregon, and he couldn't get to that.\n\n333\n00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,910\nWell, he's assuming that\nthere's perfect weather.\n\n334\n00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,780\nThat there's never gonna be any\ncomplications to the physical move at all.\n\n335\n00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,730\nHe'll be able to get into the building.\n\n336\n00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,090\nAnd again, that isn't sense.\n\n337\n00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,150\nThere's no way that Don\ncould actually predict that.\n\n338\n00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,680\nBut, at this point,\nthat's a good example we have.\n\n339\n00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,040\n>> And those assumptions can change too,\nrigh?t They can change over time.\n\n340\n00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,150\nSo just to continue with this DR example,\nright?\n\n341\n00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,710\nSo one of the big assumptions we made in\nthe beginning was that we'd be able to\n\n342\n00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,780\npull it off in this time frame, right?\n\n343\n00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,150\nWe hadn't selected a new data center yet.\n\n344\n00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,720\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n345\n00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,380\nwere we going to build our own building?\n\n346\n00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,070\nWere we going to buy\nan existing building somewhere?\n\n347\n00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,720\nWere we going to co locate at\nsomebody else's data center?\n\n348\n00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,170\nAnd where were they going to be?\n\n349\n00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,190\nWe were in Seattle, but\nthis data center could have been anywhere.\n\n350\n00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,830\nIt could have been in New York,\nit could have been, you know,\n\n351\n00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,110\nit could have been at another\nbuilding right there in Portland.\n\n352\n00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,100\nWe have a lot of choices.\n\n353\n00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,844\nSo under the assumptions we had a big\n\n354\n00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:59,488\nassumption that we will\nbe able to transport\n\n355\n00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:04,062\nour existing equipment into the new\n\n356\n00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:09,414\nfacility within the project time frame.\n\n357\n00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:16,919\nNow, I specifically remember this\nassumption because it ended up\n\n358\n00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:17,720\nbeing wrong.\n\n359\n00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,730\nWe assumed that we'd be able to transport\nour equipment into this new facility.\n\n360\n00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,080\nThe facility that we chose\nwas SAS 70 compliant, and\n\n361\n00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,030\nthey had various requirements.\n\n362\n00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,330\nThe main requirement was that we\nweren't allowed int the data center.\n\n363\n00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,330\nWe actually moved our data to a place\nthat we weren't allowed to go into.\n\n364\n00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,660\nSo we took a tour of the facility and\n\n365\n00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,230\nduring the tour we had guards\nwith us while we did the tour.\n\n366\n00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,530\nIt was very secure.\n\n367\n00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,540\nWe weren't allowed to touch anything.\n\n368\n00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,620\nSo something we didn't\nrealize going into this,\n\n369\n00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,100\ncuz we hadn't picked this place yet,\nwas that the servers.\n\n370\n00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,740\nYeah, we could take them there, but\nwe weren't allowed to install them.\n\n371\n00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,660\nWe weren't allowed to\nput them in the racks.\n\n372\n00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,820\nThe data center had to do it.\n\n373\n00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,950\nThey had to do it for us.\n\n374\n00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,970\nIt was part of their requirements.\n\n375\n00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,920\nSo part of this transport got a little\nbit more complex later on than\n\n376\n00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,790\nwe thought about.\n\n377\n00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,230\nThe other thing was, we initially\ndidn't think much about it, but\n\n378\n00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,530\na lot of our servers weren't encrypted\n>> Oh.\n\n379\n00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,990\n>> And that's because they\nwere physically secure.\n\n380\n00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,220\nWell, we had to transport them\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n381\n00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,170\n>> And trucking them into a U-Haul or\n\n382\n00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,165\nsomething like that.\n\n383\n00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:23,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not necessarily secure and so\n\n384\n00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,020\nwe had to take some extra measures there,\nwe actually had to have security guards.\n\n385\n00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,040\nWe transported our servers\nthe same way we transported money.\n\n386\n00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,290\nThey were in armored cars and they drove\nacross, so you know, it was some things\n\n387\n00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,200\nthat we just didn't know at this stage and\nunderstand that's gonna happen.\n\n388\n00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,400\nThat as your project rolls forward,\nyou're going to find out things.\n\n389\n00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,070\n>> Yeah.\n>> And something that's an assumption now\n\n390\n00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,080\nmight turn into a fact later and then it\nhas to get incorporated into the project.\n\n391\n00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,600\nSo we'll see that.\n\n392\n00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,400\nAll right?\n\n393\n00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,070\nOnce we've got that done,\nyou sign off on it.\n\n394\n00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,180\nRight?\nNow if this is your first draft,\n\n395\n00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,220\ndon't bother signing off on it.\n\n396\n00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,760\nYou're wasting your time.\n\n397\n00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,570\nThat first draft is never\nthe one that you run with.\n\n398\n00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,380\nYou're gonna take this draft and you're\ngonna send it out to the project team and\n\n399\n00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,150\nto the stakeholders and to the sponsor and\neverybody's gonna review it and\n\n400\n00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,120\nsee if they agree.\n\n401\n00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,010\nAnd if they spot anything they want to\nchange, any wordsmithing they want to do,\n\n402\n00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,905\nalterations, whatever,\nthen great, you do those.\n\n403\n00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,885\nAnd then you got Version 1.1 and\nVersion 1.2.\n\n404\n00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,295\nAnd you continue to advance from there.\n\n405\n00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:27,775\nBut the scope statement itself\nis really not that heavy, but\n\n406\n00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:29,525\nit's extremely important.\n\n407\n00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:30,215\nRight?\nSo\n\n408\n00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:34,370\nmy document now is two pages, and\nI might have a requirement sheet,\n\n409\n00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,860\nthat's another 20 pages that goes\nonline that goes together with this.\n\n410\n00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,740\nBut, for the most part,\nmy statements here are very concise.\n\n411\n00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,930\nI try to pick words\nthat are not debatable.\n\n412\n00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,854\nApparently, I've got some\nkind of grammar error here.\n\n413\n00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:51,120\nBut, all right, so we try and\n\n414\n00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,060\npick that and then we've got a simple\ndocument that everyone can refer back to.\n\n415\n00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,320\nHow do I know if I'm done?\n\n416\n00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,390\nHow do I know if we've\nachieved what we want?\n\n417\n00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,670\nGo grab the scope statement.\n\n418\n00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,350\nIt's right there in the scope\nstatement and the requirements sheet.\n\n419\n00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,500\nThey tell you what you\nwere supposed to do.\n\n420\n00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,150\nAre they done?\n\n421\n00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> If aren't, your project's not done.\n\n422\n00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,740\nRight?\n\n423\n00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,420\nSo, just be on the lookout little\nthings like this, See Exhibit A.\n\n424\n00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,169\nAll of a sudden this single page or\n\n425\n00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:16,470\ntwo page document becomes\na 30 page document, right?\n\n426\n00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,850\nThose exhibits are pretty important.\n\n427\n00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,260\nAll right, now, this information here,\nI pretty much just made up as we went.\n\n428\n00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,420\nWell, I didn't make it up,\nit comes from a prior experience, but\n\n429\n00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,100\nif you're the one charged\nwith filling this out,\n\n430\n00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,880\nhow do we get to the point\nthat we can fill this out?\n\n431\n00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,260\nHow do we get to where we\nhave that information?\n\n432\n00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,250\nThat's where the scope\nstatement process comes in.\n\n433\n00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,850\nWhich I've got parked right here.\n\n434\n00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,659\nSo we've got the define\nscope process that tells\n\n435\n00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:47,850\nus what we do to start to build up this\nscope statement and get it defined.\n\n436\n00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,330\nAll right?\n\n437\n00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,530\nNow, we'll start with the inputs.\n\n438\n00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,531\nThis is one of those, and you see these\na lot in the early stages of the project,\n\n439\n00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:57,190\nthat pretty much everything\nthat you have becomes an input.\n\n440\n00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,090\nSo, we've got a project charter.\n\n441\n00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,580\nSo that's gonna be an input.\n\n442\n00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,640\nWe've got a requirements document\nthat we drafted in the last episode.\n\n443\n00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,270\nSo we've got that.\n\n444\n00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,580\nWe bring that in, and then our\nScope Management Plan, if we have one.\n\n445\n00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,030\nWhich is going to tell us\nhow we go about drafting it.\n\n446\n00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,720\nAnd the Scope Management\nplan might be very simple,\n\n447\n00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,630\nit might just say, use this scope\ntemplate and off you go, right?\n\n448\n00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,120\nOr it might have something\nfar more detailed.\n\n449\n00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,040\nThe only other thing we got\nare Organizational Process Assets,\n\n450\n00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,430\nwhich would be the templates and\nother resources we might have available.\n\n451\n00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,910\nSo we take that information and\n\n452\n00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,380\nbased on it, we start to create\nthe scope statement, right.\n\n453\n00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,450\nAnd you can do what I did and\njust grab that template and\n\n454\n00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,960\njust start filling it out.\n\n455\n00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,340\nOr we've got several tools and\ntechniques that we can use.\n\n456\n00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,210\nSo what I did a minute ago,\nthat was expert judgment.\n\n457\n00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,390\nI just used what was in my head and\n\n458\n00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,200\nmemory in that case, and\nkind of just wrote it out there.\n\n459\n00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,150\nAnd you can do that,\nsmall medium project that's probably fine.\n\n460\n00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,890\nIn a large project though, you need\nto be a little more detail oriented.\n\n461\n00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,840\nAnd so we've got other things.\n\n462\n00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,720\nAll right?\n\n463\n00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,310\nNumber two, product analysis.\n\n464\n00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,060\nThis is one that we can spend\na lot of time on because we're\n\n465\n00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,460\nlooking at the products, what we're\ngonna produce, our final deliverable and\n\n466\n00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,070\nwe analyze it to break down what all\ndecisions have to be made to create it.\n\n467\n00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,680\nI gave an example of this on\nthe last episode on a website.\n\n468\n00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,100\nSomebody says, I want a website and\n\n469\n00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,230\nI want it to have fancy menus where\nyou float your mouse over it and\n\n470\n00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,550\nthey drop down and I want to have it\nwhere it looks very modern and it's fast.\n\n471\n00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,030\nSo you take that to your\nsubject matter expert and\n\n472\n00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,020\nyou show it to them and they go, okay,\n\n473\n00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,560\nwell if they want to have fancy menus,\nwhat do they want in the menus?\n\n474\n00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,250\nWhat menu items to they need?\n\n475\n00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,866\nWhat exactly is going up there, and\n\n476\n00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:39,350\nthey want it to look modern,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n477\n00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,310\nDo they want flat logo images,\ndo they want multiple colors,\n\n478\n00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,120\ndo they want it to be black and\nwhite, you know?\n\n479\n00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,550\nWhat is it exactly that they want?\n\n480\n00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,310\nAnd we start to refine that and\nget more and more detailed information.\n\n481\n00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,930\nThat's a part of product analysis,\nall right?\n\n482\n00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,660\nYou might have a end design\nalready figure out but\n\n483\n00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,932\ngetting to the end of that\nis part of the challenge.\n\n484\n00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:05,480\nAll right, now the PMI, they break own\nseveral different components of product\n\n485\n00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,720\nanalysis and\ndo I have this document, let's see.\n\n486\n00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,098\nSomewhere around here,\nI've got this document.\n\n487\n00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:17,632\nNot here.\n\n488\n00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:22,580\n[LAUGH]\nRonnie made some really good notes on\n\n489\n00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,140\nthis, I want to pull them up.\n\n490\n00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,410\nNow I have to figure out\nwhere I put them though.\n\n491\n00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,610\nThis is Planning.\n\n492\n00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,550\n>> It might be\n>> Be in the part one there.\n\n493\n00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,360\nI don't know why but\nit may still be in there.\n\n494\n00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,730\nThat kind of a lot stuff together.\n\n495\n00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,892\n>> Here we go.\nDefiance.\n\n496\n00:26:37,892 --> 00:26:41,330\nAll right so you'll see the PMI\nbreaks down product analysis and\n\n497\n00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,750\nthey break it down into\na number of different things.\n\n498\n00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,490\nSo what I was talking about that\nwas product break down right.\n\n499\n00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,760\nWe take that product and we break it\ndown into its individual components.\n\n500\n00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,700\nWe figure out all the different things\nthat need to be determined here early on.\n\n501\n00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,350\n>> Right?\n\n502\n00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,350\nWe also have Systems Analysis.\n\n503\n00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,670\nSystem Analysis is basically\nthe same thing as Product Breakdown.\n\n504\n00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,640\nProduct Breakdown is when you have\nsomething physical, a website,\n\n505\n00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,410\na 2016 Ford Focus.\n\n506\n00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> Something that you're\n\n507\n00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,200\nphysically producing.\n\n508\n00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,290\nA Systems Analysis that's when we're\ndealing with something that's a little\n\n509\n00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,785\nmore logical, right?\n\n510\n00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:17,165\nI'm trying to get our defect\nrate from 20% down to 10%.\n\n511\n00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:21,220\nOkay, what all is involved in\nmanufacturing these blue jeans?\n\n512\n00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,110\nWhat systems are involved in that?\n\n513\n00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,210\nHow do they interact?\n\n514\n00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,810\nHow do those systems work together?\n\n515\n00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,940\nSo, we've go one system that actually\ncuts the fabric and another system that\n\n516\n00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,040\nstitches the buttons on, and another\nsystem that stitches the fabric together.\n\n517\n00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,360\n>> Well, where are defects coming from?\n\n518\n00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,740\nWhere do we need to focus in on this?\n\n519\n00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,510\nHow do these systems tie together and\n\n520\n00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,010\nthen that's gonna start to set some\nof the scope of our project too.\n\n521\n00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,030\nSo, Systems Analysis,\nvery similar to Product Breakdown.\n\n522\n00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:52,600\nRequirements Analysis, we get a list of\nrequirements from our sponsor or whoever.\n\n523\n00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,480\nNow we start to look at those\nrequirements to identify additional\n\n524\n00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,550\ninformation we need.\n\n525\n00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,820\nThis is where a subject matter\nexpert can really help, right?\n\n526\n00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,570\nThey can look at it and\n\n527\n00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,460\nfind those additional questions\nthat we need to break down.\n\n528\n00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,490\nAll right.\n\n529\n00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,430\nThe next two, Systems Engineering and\nValue Engineering, right?\n\n530\n00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,360\nSystems Engineering, this is saying, all\nright, we've got multiple systems involved\n\n531\n00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,110\nin this process\n>> Do we need to make changes to them?\n\n532\n00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,810\nAre we gonna have to reinvent them?\n\n533\n00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,800\nHow detailed are we gonna get in here?\n\n534\n00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,730\nAnd so we might have to create new\nsystems to achieve what we want.\n\n535\n00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,670\nOr we might be able to retrofit existing\nsystems to achieve what we want.\n\n536\n00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,130\nAnd the other thing is there might be\nother projects that are going on at\n\n537\n00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,280\nthe same time that are doing\nthe same type of thing.\n\n538\n00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,960\nWe might be able to integrate\nthose projects together.\n\n539\n00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,570\nThere might be overlap there to be\nable to save time and resources and so\n\n540\n00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,910\nthat's where Systems Engineering comes\nin is finding where we can create these\n\n541\n00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,670\nnew systems, or modify the ones we have.\n\n542\n00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,390\nValue Engineering, this ones\na little bit different, all right?\n\n543\n00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,440\nIf my goal that the thing that I\nwant to product is an item, right?\n\n544\n00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,740\nThe 2016 Ford Focus, right?\n\n545\n00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,420\nThere are ways that I can build value\n\n546\n00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,780\ninto that product from the very beginning,\nright?\n\n547\n00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,930\nI don't have to, but I can.\n\n548\n00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:13,720\nWhen you buy a car today a lot of cars\ncome with a 30,000 mile warranty, right?\n\n549\n00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,480\nSo for the first 30,000 miles, it's\nunder warranty and if somethings wrong,\n\n550\n00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,040\nthey'll fix it for you.\n\n551\n00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,620\nBut there's other cars out there that\ncome with a 100,000 miles warranty.\n\n552\n00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,260\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n553\n00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,390\nDo they have to do that?\n\n554\n00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,550\nThey don't, right?\n\n555\n00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,990\nThey choose to because they\nget good marketing out of it.\n\n556\n00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,690\nAnd maybe they trust their cars enough.\n\n557\n00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,340\nOr they just know the expense\nwon't be that great.\n\n558\n00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,600\nSo they do it anyway.\n\n559\n00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,020\nThat's a part of Value Engineering.\n\n560\n00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,900\nWe can choose to build that value\ninto our product if it's required or\n\n561\n00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,650\nif we just feel like it's\nthe right thing to do, right?\n\n562\n00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,340\nThat kind of goes hand in\nhand with Value Analysis.\n\n563\n00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,260\nWe can look at a system and say,\nyou know what, in our prototype for\n\n564\n00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,920\nthe 2016 Ford Focus,\nwe did an all steel body.\n\n565\n00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n566\n00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,810\nWhat if we went to.\n\n567\n00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,770\nShoot, what's that really cheap?\n\n568\n00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,800\n>> Carbon fiber?\n\n569\n00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,990\nNo, that's expensive.\n\n570\n00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,470\nKevlar.\n>> Yeah, carbon fiber's probably fine.\n\n571\n00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,990\n>> Yeah.\n>> What do they make those Jon Boats and\n\n572\n00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,880\nstuff, the cheap fishing boats,\nwhat are they made out of?\n\n573\n00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,780\n>> Fiberglass.\n>> Fiberglass!\n\n574\n00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,370\nThere we go.\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n575\n00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,640\n>> What if we went with, I was trying\nto think of something super cheap.\n\n576\n00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,260\n>> Yeah.\n>> Carbon fiber's not always cheap.\n\n577\n00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,440\nBut what if we went with a fiberglass body\nor like the Saturn's the plastic body.\n\n578\n00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,200\n>> Yes.\n>> Right.\n\n579\n00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,180\nWe don't have to have steel and somebody\nmight say, well if we want our customers\n\n580\n00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,750\nto survive a crash,\nwe probably don't want to go plastic.\n\n581\n00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,950\nAnd somebody else might say, you know\nwhat, we can go with a plastic body but\n\n582\n00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,000\nwe can build in a stronger\ncage inside of it,\n\n583\n00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,170\nso it's structurally sound,\neven though it's got a plastic body.\n\n584\n00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,720\nSo you start looking at things like that,\nand\n\n585\n00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,540\nyou say, all right, is the value\nof having a steel body worth it?\n\n586\n00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,600\nIs the value of going with something less\nexpensive, sometimes less expensive and\n\n587\n00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,980\nyou create a piece of junk and\npeople don't buy it.\n\n588\n00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,160\nYou can hurt the project by going cheap.\n\n589\n00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,500\nSo Value Analysis is where\nwe weigh the odds on that.\n\n590\n00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,550\nWe look at the materials\nthat we're choosing and\n\n591\n00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,920\nwe say is this the right decision.\n\n592\n00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:08,160\nBecause sometimes we manufacture something\nin plastic just because it was easy.\n\n593\n00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,030\nNot because we have some other reason for\nit.\n\n594\n00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,180\nNot because it saved us money or anything.\n\n595\n00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,890\nIt might just be that\nwhoever was the designer,\n\n596\n00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,990\nthat was the material they had\nsitting there at the time, right?\n\n597\n00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,230\nWe're gonna build this arcade cabinet.\n\n598\n00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,720\nWell, we could use really nice wood.\n\n599\n00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,580\nWe could get some cedar, well you probably\nwouldn't want cedar, but we could get\n\n600\n00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,580\n>> Oak or something like that, and\n\n601\n00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,540\nbuilding this cabinet would\nbe incredibly expensive.\n\n602\n00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,670\nBut, if we just happened to have a couple\nof sheets of plywood laying around,\n\n603\n00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,850\nwe might choose to use that\njust because it's here.\n\n604\n00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,450\nRight?\n\n605\n00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,230\nWell, we might want to do\nsome Value Analysis and say,\n\n606\n00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,100\nwell, over the years that\nplywood is not going to hold up.\n\n607\n00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,019\nIt's going to break down,\nit's going to look terrible.\n\n608\n00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:48,980\nSo, there will be some value in going\nahead and using a higher quality material.\n\n609\n00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,700\nAll right?\n\n610\n00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,840\nThat's Value Analysis.\n\n611\n00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,070\nAlright, so\nall of that falls under product analysis.\n\n612\n00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,370\nIt's a general umbrella.\n\n613\n00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,220\nYou have to look at what you're producing,\nservice or good.\n\n614\n00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,130\nYou know, tangible or intangible.\n\n615\n00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,690\nAnd figure out questions that\nhaven't been asked, right?\n\n616\n00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,280\n>> Right.\n>> All the different details and\n\n617\n00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,170\nget that nailed down This will really\nbecome part of your requirements list.\n\n618\n00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,420\nAlright We got a few others but\nI think I talked a little too long.\n\n619\n00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,690\n>> Yup.\n>> I see our timer's run out.\n\n620\n00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,760\nSo let's do this.\n\n621\n00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,890\nLet's stop and take a break.\n\n622\n00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,910\n>> Okay.\n>> When we get back,\n\n623\n00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,930\nwe're gonna talk about some\nof the other tools and\n\n624\n00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,420\ntechniques we have generating\nthat scope statement.\n\n625\n00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,440\nAnd then we'll see about wrapping\nthat one up and moving on.\n\n626\n00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,830\nWe still have our work breakdown structure\n>> Yup.\n\n627\n00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,530\n>> and a few other things to get to, so.\n\n628\n00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,449\nWe'll stop here and\nwe'll see you back in a few minutes.\n\n629\n00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:38,393\n[MUSIC]\n\n630\n00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:39,078\nAll right.\n\n631\n00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:40,550\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n632\n00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,180\nSo, we've got a couple more tools and\n\n633\n00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,720\ntechniques to cover as far as\ndeveloping our scope statement.\n\n634\n00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,830\nThe next one is one that I like.\n\n635\n00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:52,140\nIt's actually kind of a neat one,\nit's called alternatives generation.\n\n636\n00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,550\nAnd basically,\nwhen your sponsor comes to you and\n\n637\n00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,120\nkicks off this project and\ngives you what they want,\n\n638\n00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,410\nit's your job to figure out how\nyou're going to achieve it and\n\n639\n00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:08,320\nthere is usually more more than one way to\nachieve what the sponsor is asking for.\n\n640\n00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,560\nSo what you need to do is\nyou need to get creative and\n\n641\n00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,490\ntry and think of the different ways.\n\n642\n00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,480\nIf you just take the first solution\nthat comes along, it might work.\n\n643\n00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,220\nBut there might be other\nsolutions that have less risk or\n\n644\n00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,550\nare more cost efficient,\nwork better in a certain time schedule.\n\n645\n00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,580\nThere's always different ways\nthat we can solve that problem.\n\n646\n00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,425\nSo alternatives generation is simply\na process of us figuring out,\n\n647\n00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:36,295\nwhat alternative means do we have for\nachieving this goal.\n\n648\n00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:37,145\nAlright.\n\n649\n00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:41,245\nFor example,\nwe wanna design the 2016 Ford Focus.\n\n650\n00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:43,830\nDo we design an entirely new car?\n\n651\n00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:48,720\nOr do we just take the 2015 and\nmaybe make some minor tweaks to it and\n\n652\n00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,960\nremarket it as the 2016,\nwhich is what they usually do.\n\n653\n00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,880\nSo, do we go that route?\n\n654\n00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,890\nSo, you got some kind of choices there.\n\n655\n00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,290\nAnd then if it's something\nlike building a house,\n\n656\n00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,030\nthere's more than one\nway to build a house.\n\n657\n00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,640\nYou can build it fully custom,\nor you can do a modular\n\n658\n00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,550\ndesign where you just buy\nthe components and stick them together.\n\n659\n00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,160\nSo, tons of different options there.\n\n660\n00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,130\nYou need to take a look at\neach of the alternatives and\n\n661\n00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,330\nchoose which one best meets\nthe needs of the sponsor.\n\n662\n00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:13,850\n>> Yeah.\n\n663\n00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,840\nSometimes because we're limited just\nbecause of the way we're used to\n\n664\n00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,690\ndoing things,\n\n665\n00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,200\nwe don't think that there may be more\nthan one particular approach doing it.\n\n666\n00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,160\nAnd we may find out that another approach\nis actually better than the way that we\n\n667\n00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,790\nwere thinking about, so\nalways keep an open mind even at\n\n668\n00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,270\nthis point even though you're\nstarting to define the scope, and\n\n669\n00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,110\ntrying to figure out is there\nanother way that we can approach is.\n\n670\n00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,170\n>> Yeah, and this is something I've\nlearned repeatedly over the years.\n\n671\n00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,120\nI have networking background.\n\n672\n00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,840\nI've been a network manager for several\ncompanies, I've worked with Cisco and\n\n673\n00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,230\nJuniper networking equipment for\na long time.\n\n674\n00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:48,040\nAnd I know a lot of stuff about\nthe equipment just because I've\n\n675\n00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,600\nused it so long.\n\n676\n00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,100\nI'm not special or anything,\nI've just used it a lot.\n\n677\n00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,030\nAnd so, when somebody asks me to do\nsomething, to configure a network or\n\n678\n00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,220\nimplement something using Cisco equipment,\nI know at least one way to do it.\n\n679\n00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,880\nBut there's always other ways and\nwhen I talk with other network engineers,\n\n680\n00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,310\nI learn every time,\nyou're always seeing something new.\n\n681\n00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,640\nBecause I may have deployed it in one\nenvironment that had one set of needs, but\n\n682\n00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,780\nthere's other environments with different\nneeds that modify how that technology\n\n683\n00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,620\nis deployed.\n\n684\n00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,920\nSo you always want to be open-minded,\n\n685\n00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,020\nbring in subject matter experts or\ncontractors or\n\n686\n00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,090\nsomebody to get their opinions too and\nkind of put it all together.\n\n687\n00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,870\nSo some of the ways we do that,\nbrainstorming we've already talked about.\n\n688\n00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:31,850\nYou get a bunch of people in a room and\nyou say, anybody got some other ideas?\n\n689\n00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,890\nLet's just throw them out here.\n\n690\n00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,930\nYou also do what's\ncalled lateral thinking.\n\n691\n00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,230\nLateral thinking is where we look\nat the steps to achieve our goal.\n\n692\n00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,250\nAnd we say okay,\nwe're going to pick this one step.\n\n693\n00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:45,800\nWe can't do it.\n\n694\n00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,310\nWhat are our other options?\n\n695\n00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,800\nThink of a lateral solution\nthat does the same thing.\n\n696\n00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,890\nSo if we talk about building a house and\n\n697\n00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,430\nstep one of building the house\nis to lay the foundation.\n\n698\n00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,080\nAnd so we come in and we say all right,\nlet's pretend that for\n\n699\n00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,020\nsome reason we can't lay a foundation,\nwhat else can we do?\n\n700\n00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,250\nWell you can build a house\nwithout a foundation,\n\n701\n00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,220\nyou can do the raised,\nwhat do they call that?\n\n702\n00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,420\n>> Stilts, house on stilts?\n\n703\n00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,070\n>> Or you can do a stilt one,\nI didn't even think of that.\n\n704\n00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,040\n>> Here in Florida,\nit's almost like one giant flood plane.\n\n705\n00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,920\n>> House on stilts.\n>> So you'll see houses that are built\n\n706\n00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,460\neight feet off the ground, on stilts,\nyou can park your car under the house.\n\n707\n00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,860\n>> You'll also see some that are only\nlike a foot off the ground though.\n\n708\n00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,780\nAnd, I'm not talking about mobile homes or\ntrailers.\n\n709\n00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,510\nI'm talking about actual houses that\nare just a foot off the ground or so and\n\n710\n00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,220\nthey'll have giant cement,\n>> Pylons.\n\n711\n00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,930\nPylons, that's the word I'm looking for,\n\n712\n00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,400\nthat they rest on instead of\nan actual cement foundation.\n\n713\n00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,470\nSo what are the pros and cons, right?\n\n714\n00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,860\nIs there a benefit of going\none way over another?\n\n715\n00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,040\nWith the pylon solution\nsomebody come in and\n\n716\n00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,920\nthrow some pylons down in a day and\nthen you're off and building.\n\n717\n00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,810\nBut if somebody pours concrete slab down,\nyou've got to wait a couple of days so\n\n718\n00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,330\nthat it dries, that it gets in there,\n\n719\n00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:05,040\nand your plumbers have to put the plumbing\nin so that it's in the foundation\n\n720\n00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,650\nvs if they do the raised off the ground,\nthe plumbers can come in and\n\n721\n00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,720\ndo it whenever because it's things\nyou get right there under the house.\n\n722\n00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,810\nSo it's an alternative solution\nto how we achieve the same goal.\n\n723\n00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,360\nWhich one's gonna be better for us?\n\n724\n00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,240\nIt depends.\n\n725\n00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,980\nI know a lot of people\nprefer to have the cement\n\n726\n00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,840\nslab down cuz when you walk\nthrough the house it sounds solid.\n\n727\n00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,550\nBut if you're in one of those raised\nhouses, you can hear your footsteps echo.\n\n728\n00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,820\nNow if you're from\nthe Northern United States,\n\n729\n00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,750\nyou probably have a basement anyway,\nso it really doesn't matter.\n\n730\n00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:39,330\nBut here in Florida, we can't have\nbasements because the water level is what?\n\n731\n00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,370\nOne inch down.\n\n732\n00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,160\nSo you know you dig one inch down and\nyou hit water.\n\n733\n00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,920\nSo, we don't have that here.\n\n734\n00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,580\nAgain, different areas you're going\nto have different solutions you\n\n735\n00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,490\nknow up there,\nup north you may do a basement.\n\n736\n00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,260\nSo that really influence things.\n\n737\n00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,870\nSo, lateral thinking is just\ntaking individual components,\n\n738\n00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,620\nis there something else I can do.\n\n739\n00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:03,410\nI find it better to break it\ndown to individual components.\n\n740\n00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,935\nSo, usually you get the whole things.\n\n741\n00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:07,770\nAll right, so\nwe're going to build this house this way.\n\n742\n00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,560\nWhat's another way to do it?\n\n743\n00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,800\nWhen people think big picture,\nit's hard to come up with an alternative.\n\n744\n00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,180\nBut if you take it down to one component,\nthis one component, for\n\n745\n00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,100\nwhatever reason we can't do that.\n\n746\n00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,610\nWhat else do you got?\n\n747\n00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:26,970\nThat's what lateral thinking is all\nabout and analysis of alternatives.\n\n748\n00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,960\nJust because there is an alternative\ndoesn't mean it's a good one, right?\n\n749\n00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,670\n>> Right.\n\n750\n00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,620\n>> So sometimes you'll get people that\nhave recommendations that are fine they're\n\n751\n00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:39,410\ngood recommendations, but they just don't\nwork out because too high of cost or\n\n752\n00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,990\nsomething of that nature.\n\n753\n00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,610\nAnd I just watched a movie a few\nweeks ago that was talking about\n\n754\n00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,890\nhow some of the early\ncomputers were designed.\n\n755\n00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,820\nAnd it had this little bit on Steve Jobs,\nand\n\n756\n00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,490\nhow they were pushing out\none of the Apple computers.\n\n757\n00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:58,770\nAnd they wanted to put one processor in\nit, that cost a normal amount of money,\n\n758\n00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,340\nbut Steve Jobs, was one of\nthe higher-end processor in there.\n\n759\n00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,870\nSo he said, put in this higher-end one.\n\n760\n00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,370\nAnd it made the price\nof the computer go up,\n\n761\n00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,830\nand nobody bought it,\nand it was a failure.\n\n762\n00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,840\nSo, it was a terrible decision,\nbut that should have been look at.\n\n763\n00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,643\nIt was, he was kind of a jerk.\n\n764\n00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:13,700\n[LAUGH] And so he did it anyway.\n\n765\n00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,100\nBut, you have to look at that and say,\n\n766\n00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,410\nall right,\nwe got two processors we can pick from.\n\n767\n00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,210\nSure, this other one is faster,\nthat's nice.\n\n768\n00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,280\nBut, the cost is gonna make it higher,\nwhich is gonna make it reach less of our\n\n769\n00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,120\ncustomers, and\nit's gonna be less successful.\n\n770\n00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,760\nWe shouldn't go that route, right?\n\n771\n00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,830\nSo, just because an alternative exists,\ndoesn't mean that it's a given.\n\n772\n00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,520\nDoesn't mean you should go that route.\n\n773\n00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,930\nYou've got to weight them together and\nso we'll see analysis of alternatives\n\n774\n00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,880\nthroughout this show especially when\nwe get into procurements and biding.\n\n775\n00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,152\nWe gonna see how we can compare\ndifferent elements together and\n\n776\n00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:46,177\nmake those decisions but for\nnow we'll just go with them or\n\n777\n00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:49,881\ngeneral concept of you just need to\ncompare, You need to look at them and\n\n778\n00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:53,180\ndetermine which one is really\ngoing to be the most beneficial.\n\n779\n00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,729\n>> Okay,\nthe last tool's another one we've already\n\n780\n00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:59,403\ntalked about which is facilitated\nworkshops So facilitated workshops,\n\n781\n00:39:59,403 --> 00:40:02,958\nthose are just where we have a meeting and\nwe get some people together and\n\n782\n00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:06,985\nwe come up with a series of questions, an\nagenda that we go through, and we try and\n\n783\n00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:10,510\ncome up with some answers,\nthings that will become part of our scope.\n\n784\n00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,460\nWith all that information in hand now,\nwe're ready to go and\n\n785\n00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,540\ndraft that project scope statement.\n\n786\n00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,320\nNow the scope statement, if this is the\nfirst draft, then we're going to do what I\n\n787\n00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,300\ndid at the beginning of the show,\njust go through and fill it out, right?\n\n788\n00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,690\nBut then when you're done,\n\n789\n00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,970\nyou're going to send it out to everybody,\nthey're going to evaluate it and\n\n790\n00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,080\nthen you're going to go through this\nprocess again and potentially update it.\n\n791\n00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,870\nWhen the scope statement is done, there's\nthings in here that might have changed.\n\n792\n00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:45,130\nOur constraints, our time cost scope,\n\n793\n00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,710\nthose might have changed from what\nthe original project charter stated,\n\n794\n00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,910\nfrom what the original\nrequirements list stated.\n\n795\n00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,940\nThings like that.\nWe might have found new things.\n\n796\n00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,510\nSo, we're gonna start seeing this\nwith processes from here on out.\n\n797\n00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,730\nMost of our processes\nare gonna include two outputs.\n\n798\n00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,300\nOne which is whatever it is\nwe were trying to produce.\n\n799\n00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,100\nAnd the second one is,\nproject document updates.\n\n800\n00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,000\nThat means we might have\nfound something new, and\n\n801\n00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,550\nwe need to go back and update some\nof our existing project documents.\n\n802\n00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,530\nWe might need to go and\nupdate our project management plan,\n\n803\n00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,330\nto reflect something new\nthat we're doing here.\n\n804\n00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:21,160\nWe might need to go and\nupdate our requirements list.\n\n805\n00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,890\nYou, typically,\n\n806\n00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:25,800\ndon't go and update the charter, usually\nthe charter stays the way that it was.\n\n807\n00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,800\nBut, you may have to come back and\nrevise this document.\n\n808\n00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,190\nIf you've already produced your scope\nstatement, then when you run through here\n\n809\n00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,200\na second time, you're doing\nan update to the scope statement.\n\n810\n00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,720\nSo, we'll start seeing that project\ndocument update on each of the processes\n\n811\n00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,640\nthat we look at.\n\n812\n00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,290\nWhen you're done,\nyou should be left with a scope statement\n\n813\n00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,030\nthat adequately defines\nwhat you're going to do.\n\n814\n00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:53,230\nAnd this scope statement will\nserve as a basic checklist.\n\n815\n00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,760\nAt the end of this project\nwhen everything's said and\n\n816\n00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,930\ndone, you should be able to grab\nthe scope statement and read through it.\n\n817\n00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:04,430\nAnd you should be able to say okay\ndid we create a new data center\n\n818\n00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,460\nat a location we selected.\n\n819\n00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,330\nAlright, yes or no?\n\n820\n00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,550\nIs the location,\ndoes it meet the FDIC requirements and\n\n821\n00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,116\nis it [INAUDIBLE] compliant.\n\n822\n00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,317\nYes or no right?\n\n823\n00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:20,400\nIs all existing, or was all existing\nfunctions at the old center\n\n824\n00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,550\nrecreate at the new center, yes or no?\n\n825\n00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,830\nAnd we just kind of keep going.\n\n826\n00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,100\nDid we replicate that functionality?\n\n827\n00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,030\nWere we able to complete a BRP fail over?\n\n828\n00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,510\nWere we able to flip over to it,\nand it functions properly?\n\n829\n00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,080\nYes or No?\n\n830\n00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:36,750\nDid we exclude these things?\n\n831\n00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,150\nThat's easy, cause we're\nusually pretty good about that.\n\n832\n00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,090\nDid we get it done by October 1st?\n\n833\n00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,250\nDid it cost less than 500 grand?\n\n834\n00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,800\nDid we meet all\nthe requirements in exhibit A?\n\n835\n00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,910\nYes or no?\n\n836\n00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,770\nAnd then the assumptions you don't really\nhave to follow up on it at this point.\n\n837\n00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,685\nBut you could say Were these\nassumptions realistic?\n\n838\n00:42:53,685 --> 00:42:54,475\nDid we meet those?\n\n839\n00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:55,245\nYes or no?\n\n840\n00:42:55,245 --> 00:42:58,815\nIf we answered yes, to all of those\nquestions, this project is done.\n\n841\n00:42:58,815 --> 00:42:59,415\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n842\n00:42:59,415 --> 00:43:02,545\nWe've completed it, it's a success.\n\n843\n00:43:02,545 --> 00:43:07,480\nIf we answered no to any of those\nquestions, the project is not done and\n\n844\n00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,380\nthe project is a failure.\n\n845\n00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,850\nWell it's a failure if you're past this\ndate and you're at your budget, right?\n\n846\n00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,550\nBut if you still have time left and\nyou still have budget money left,\n\n847\n00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,760\nand you still have resources\nthen you can keep moving.\n\n848\n00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,310\nSo you use this as a checklist\nthroughout your project.\n\n849\n00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,810\nThis becomes the guiding\nelement of your entire project.\n\n850\n00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:31,420\nAnd that's why I say the charter\nis the most powerful document.\n\n851\n00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,720\nIt's what empowers the project manager and\nkicks off the project, gives it authority.\n\n852\n00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,680\nBut this document Is the one\nthat serves as the guide for\n\n853\n00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,662\nthe whole rest of the project.\n\n854\n00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:45,560\nAll right,\nas such this document is very special.\n\n855\n00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,590\nChanges to this document could\nchange your whole project.\n\n856\n00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:53,430\nIf you start adding new requirements to\na requirements register, our exhibit A.\n\n857\n00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:58,190\nIf we start adding more requirements\nthere, they might cost us more money,\n\n858\n00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,780\nthey might require more time.\n\n859\n00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,770\nSo we run the risk of failing.\n\n860\n00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,400\nIf we need more time or\nwe need more money we need to come and\n\n861\n00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,100\nupdate the scope statement to reflect that\nwe got more money, that we got more time.\n\n862\n00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,400\nSo changes to this need to be strictly\ncontrolled and we're gonna have a show\n\n863\n00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,670\njust on change management later\non where we'll address that.\n\n864\n00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,510\nBut this document,\n\n865\n00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:24,310\nchanges to it should not be taken\nlightly after the planning phase.\n\n866\n00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,630\nRight now we're in planning,\nwe can change it all we want.\n\n867\n00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:31,420\nBut once we get out of planning we really\nneed to try and keep this set in stone and\n\n868\n00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,374\nnot deviate from it.\n\n869\n00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:33,225\nAll right.\n\n870\n00:44:33,225 --> 00:44:36,526\nNow we have an idea of what we need to do.\n\n871\n00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:41,570\nLet's figure out how we're gonna do it,\nall right?\n\n872\n00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:46,150\nAs a project manager, the odds are you're\nnot going to be a subject matter\n\n873\n00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,520\nexpert for what your project does, okay.\n\n874\n00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:54,930\nSo for example, for me at the bank,\nI was the network manager.\n\n875\n00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,580\nThe network side, I know the network side,\nso when it came to moving data lines, and\n\n876\n00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,290\nIPs, setting up VPN tunnels, or redundant\nlinks, and stuff, I knew that world.\n\n877\n00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,980\nAnd, my network team,\nthey knew that world.\n\n878\n00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,610\nSo, the network side of that\nproject was easy for me.\n\n879\n00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,810\nBut, on the system admin side, sure,\nI know Windows Server and stuff.\n\n880\n00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:16,050\nBut, I didn't know the applications\nthat our bank ran,\n\n881\n00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,270\ncuz I didn't have to deal with those.\n\n882\n00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:20,110\nI wasn't the apps guy,\nI wasn't the sysadmin guy.\n\n883\n00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:24,200\nSo, for that side of it I was\ndependent on other people.\n\n884\n00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,790\nAnd, as we all started\nto plan this project out\n\n885\n00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:28,930\nI had to work with them to say.\n\n886\n00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:33,100\nOkay, what work are you guys going to\nhave to do to move these servers over,\n\n887\n00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,620\nto not lose data,\nto keep things operational.\n\n888\n00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,480\nWhat work do you have to do?\n\n889\n00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,270\nAnd we all had to come up with\nbasically lists that showed\n\n890\n00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:44,700\nthe actual work that's gonna be done\nin the execution process, all right?\n\n891\n00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,470\nThe way we come up with that list\nis by using something called a work\n\n892\n00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,770\nbreakdown structure.\n\n893\n00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,380\nAnd I showed a work\nbreakdown structure briefly,\n\n894\n00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,290\nin terms of just the diagram,\nyesterday I think, in the show.\n\n895\n00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:02,190\nSo here's what a work breakdown\nstructure diagram looks like.\n\n896\n00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,630\nYou don't have to do a diagram.\n\n897\n00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,360\nI usually don't.\n\n898\n00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,030\nI kind of hate these because\nthey're not very flexible.\n\n899\n00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:11,630\nBut I normally do like\nan outline in Word or\n\n900\n00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,750\nExcel when I do a work\nbreakdown structure.\n\n901\n00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:18,660\nBut this is a diagram and basically\nwhat we do is we take our project, and\n\n902\n00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,450\nwe say, here's our project and\nfor our project to be a success.\n\n903\n00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:27,760\nWe need to create something, a process,\na good, whatever it is we're doing.\n\n904\n00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,330\nAnd so, we break that up into the\ndeliverables that we're going to create.\n\n905\n00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,050\nAll right?\n\n906\n00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:36,780\nAnd then, we say all right, to achieve\nthis deliverable, what do we need to do?\n\n907\n00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,440\nSo maybe Ronnie and I,\nwe decided we're gonna write a textbook.\n\n908\n00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,890\nI've talked to you about this for years.\n\n909\n00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,350\nI wanted to write an active directory.\n\n910\n00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:43,850\n>> Group policy, yeah.\n\n911\n00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,450\n>> Group policy book for years.\n\n912\n00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:48,220\nSo maybe we decide finally to do it.\n\n913\n00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,830\nSo deliverable number one for\n\n914\n00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:54,940\nus would maybe be coming up\nwith a table of contents.\n\n915\n00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,450\nRight, what are we kind cover, right?\n\n916\n00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:56,960\n>> Right.\n\n917\n00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,860\n>> So deliverable number one\nis that table of contents.\n\n918\n00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,100\nAnd that deliverable number two is,\nlet's write the book.\n\n919\n00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,530\n>> Right.\n>> So we're gonna right this book.\n\n920\n00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:10,790\nDeliverable number three might be to\nsecure a publisher and print the book.\n\n921\n00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,680\n>> Right.\n>> And so that's our project,\n\n922\n00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,170\nonce it' printed then we're done.\n\n923\n00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,760\nSo we've got three deliverables.\n\n924\n00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,200\nTable of contents,\nthe rest of the book and\n\n925\n00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,500\nthe psychical book printing, all right.\n\n926\n00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,400\nSo we need to sy, okay for\n\n927\n00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,780\na table of contents what\nactual work needs to be done?\n\n928\n00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,600\nWell, it's easy to think\nof some of these things.\n\n929\n00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,110\nWe can say, well I need to,\nI need to just write a table of contents.\n\n930\n00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,470\nWell table of contents\nare kind of an outline.\n\n931\n00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,130\nYou've got your main areas and\n\n932\n00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:39,150\nthen the individual areas underneath\neach ones that you want to tackle.\n\n933\n00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,510\nSo we have to start coming up with that\nlist of all the stuff that's in there.\n\n934\n00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:45,320\nSo, we've got to have an agreement.\n\n935\n00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,400\nRonnie and I have to agree on\nthe topics we want to cover.\n\n936\n00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,396\nAnd then we probably need to divide\nthem up between each other, so\n\n937\n00:47:51,396 --> 00:47:53,083\nthat you get half, I get half, and so\n\n938\n00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:56,359\nwe're not overwhelmed with trying\nto write the whole book ourselves.\n\n939\n00:47:56,359 --> 00:47:59,460\nSo we start breaking this process down.\n\n940\n00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:04,289\nAnd at the end of the day we come up with\na list of the actual work that needs to be\n\n941\n00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:06,950\ncompleted to achieve that deliverable.\n\n942\n00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,980\nSo when it comes to printing, we might\nhave to have a graphics designer create\n\n943\n00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,650\nthe artwork for our book, it might\nhave to get submitted to the printer,\n\n944\n00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,760\nthey have to print it out, right they\nhave to type set it or whatever they do.\n\n945\n00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,700\nThe binding, the printing, the shipping,\n\n946\n00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,910\nyou know all of these are actual work\nelements that we need to identify.\n\n947\n00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:28,920\nRight, now each of these are what\nare called work packages.\n\n948\n00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,120\nA work package, and this is the official\nterm, what you'll see on the exam.\n\n949\n00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,150\nA work package is just a granular or\n\n950\n00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:42,310\ncompartmentalized segment of work\nthat needs to be performed that, when\n\n951\n00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:46,620\ncombined with other work packages, results\nin the production of your deliverable.\n\n952\n00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,650\nThe hardest part about creating a WBS\n\n953\n00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:53,170\nis identifying all the work\nthat is necessary.\n\n954\n00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,130\nBecause it's really easy\nto leave things out.\n\n955\n00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,830\nAnd if you leave things out it's going to\nmake it hard to determine schedule and\n\n956\n00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:00,740\nbudget later on.\n\n957\n00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:04,560\nSo we've got to be thorough, so\nwe've got several tools available for\n\n958\n00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,770\nus to help make sure\nwe're thorough about it.\n\n959\n00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,130\nWe're gonna get a chance to see those.\n\n960\n00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,030\nLet me bring up my,\noh I'm already in here.\n\n961\n00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,450\nWhere is my create a WBS?\n\n962\n00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,610\nAlright, so we have a WBS process.\n\n963\n00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,330\nCreate the work breakdown structure\nprocess, and you'll see tons of inputs.\n\n964\n00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,450\nPretty much everything we've got, scope\nmanagement plan, the scope statement,\n\n965\n00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:29,940\nthe requirements documentation,\nenterprise environmental factors,\n\n966\n00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,100\norganizational process assets.\n\n967\n00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,090\nWe've already talked about all of those.\n\n968\n00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:37,560\nSo basically it's saying gather up\neverything you've got, get it together.\n\n969\n00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,520\nThe only thing we're leaving out\nhere is the stakeholder analysis,\n\n970\n00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,050\nthe stakeholder register.\n\n971\n00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,520\nBut every other document is here.\n\n972\n00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,752\nSo we gather those together and\nthen we get to work.\n\n973\n00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:52,510\nAll right, now getting to work really\nfalls down to just a couple of tools.\n\n974\n00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,760\nDecomposition and\nexpert judgement, all right.\n\n975\n00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,520\nNow expert judgement is dangerous,\n\n976\n00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:04,120\nwith expert judgement that's where we\nsay okay, we need to build a house.\n\n977\n00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,160\nWhat actual work needs to\ngo into building a house?\n\n978\n00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,470\nWell I dont know.\n\n979\n00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,400\nLet me just bring in somebody\nwho builds houses for a living.\n\n980\n00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,350\nThey've done it a ton of times,\nthey know all the stuff.\n\n981\n00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,240\nLet me get it from them.\n\n982\n00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,420\nOr we can do what I've been\ndoing in this show, and\n\n983\n00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,730\njust say well let me figure it out.\n\n984\n00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,920\nYou've got to lay a foundation, right?\n\n985\n00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,440\nAnd you've gotta put some walls up,\nand you gotta put a roof on it,\n\n986\n00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,960\nand you gotta put some drywall up.\n\n987\n00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,710\nAnd you gotta paint it and\nput carpet in, right?\n\n988\n00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:32,300\nBut I just named off all that stuff.\n\n989\n00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,960\nI didn't mention you gotta get it plumbed.\n\n990\n00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,460\n>> Right.\n\n991\n00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,150\n>> You gotta get electricity run.\n\n992\n00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,110\nYou probably have to pull some permits.\n\n993\n00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:38,630\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n994\n00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,850\n>> And let's go even further back,\n\n995\n00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,150\nyou might need to buy some land.\n\n996\n00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:41,730\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n997\n00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,370\nSo these are things I didn't think\nof cuz I don't build houses.\n\n998\n00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,210\n>> Right.\n>> It's not what I do.\n\n999\n00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,030\nNever have.\n\n1000\n00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:52,380\nSo it is important that when we say expert\njudgement that it's actually an expert.\n\n1001\n00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,960\n>> Yeah.\n\n1002\n00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,430\n>> And\nyou are an expert in project management.\n\n1003\n00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,080\nYou're not necessarily an expert in\nwhatever it is your project is doing.\n\n1004\n00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,700\nYou know how to manage the project.\n\n1005\n00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,610\nYou don't necessarily know how to\ndo what the project is requiring so\n\n1006\n00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,580\nmake sure that you identify\nthe right experts and\n\n1007\n00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:14,090\nif you're bringing in a contractor or\nsomebody, get two.\n\n1008\n00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,550\nRight?\nGet a second opinion.\n\n1009\n00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,230\nGet three if you can afford it.\n\n1010\n00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:20,460\nBecause if you've got one project manager\ntelling you all of the stuff necessary to\n\n1011\n00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,200\nbuild that house,\nanother one might tell you even more.\n\n1012\n00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:24,800\nAll right?\n\n1013\n00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,910\nSo what we'll typically do is a process\ncalled progressive elaboration, all right?\n\n1014\n00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:36,690\nProgressive elaboration, is another term\nyou'll see on the exam, is yeah sure,\n\n1015\n00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,250\nI might start high level, so\nI'll start with what's in my head.\n\n1016\n00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,640\nI wanna build a house, lay foundation,\nput up walls, put up a roof,\n\n1017\n00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,240\ndrywall it, stick some carpet in there,\npaint it, done, all right?\n\n1018\n00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,090\nSo, or whatever it is that\nwe're gonna do with it.\n\n1019\n00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,280\nThat might be good for our first draft.\n\n1020\n00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,270\nThen I say, anybody here in the room,\nanybody built a house before or\n\n1021\n00:51:55,270 --> 00:52:00,210\nhad one built for you?, and maybe Jason,\nour director, says, yeah, yeah, I did it.\n\n1022\n00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,620\nSo he starts telling me some of\nthe stuff they went through, so\n\n1023\n00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,590\nI add to it, a second round.\n\n1024\n00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,420\nI'm elaborating, I'm adding more,\nbreaking some of it down.\n\n1025\n00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,930\nAnd then I say, Okay, that's good,\nnow it's time for an expert.\n\n1026\n00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,290\nLet's go get an expert and\nactually get someone who builds houses.\n\n1027\n00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,980\nSo we can bring in our\nfriend Eric Gonzales, right?\n\n1028\n00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,340\nHe comes by every couple of weeks.\n\n1029\n00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,040\nSo we go get Eric.\n\n1030\n00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,390\nEric builds houses for a living.\n\n1031\n00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,200\nAnd so, he builds expensive house, so\n\n1032\n00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,605\nI've never had him build one,\nbut he builds them.\n\n1033\n00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:27,730\n[LAUGH] And so I can go and get Eric and\nsay, hey Eric, you do this for\n\n1034\n00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:33,240\na living man, can you take a look at\nthis and break these packages down and\n\n1035\n00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,450\nhe'll look at it and say gosh,\nthis is like kindergarten.\n\n1036\n00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:39,160\nSo then he'll take it and\nreally break it down,\n\n1037\n00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,230\nso when I say something\nsimple like lay foundation.\n\n1038\n00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,060\nYou'll look at it and say,\n\n1039\n00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:47,330\nwell, we need to bring this machinery in\nto pack the earth and level it first.\n\n1040\n00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,330\nRight?\nWe've got to clear it and pack it.\n\n1041\n00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,990\nThen we've gotta have\nwood framers come in and\n\n1042\n00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,400\nput the frame in where\nthe foundation is gonna be.\n\n1043\n00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,575\nThen we gotta have our\nconcrete guys come in and\n\n1044\n00:52:55,575 --> 00:52:59,405\npour the concrete and then we've got\nto have our meter guys come in to run,\n\n1045\n00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:02,985\nthey have this like radioactive thing they\npush around to measure the density of that\n\n1046\n00:53:02,985 --> 00:53:07,180\nconcrete, to make sure it poured level and\nthere's no giant bubbles in there.\n\n1047\n00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,230\nAnd then you've gotta have just\nstep after step after step.\n\n1048\n00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:13,120\nHe knows that stuff,\nhe knows it cuz he does it for a living.\n\n1049\n00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,700\nSo, he's building on it more.\n\n1050\n00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,880\nAnd you want that,\n\n1051\n00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,700\nyou want more than one set of eyes on\nthis work breakdown diagram because\n\n1052\n00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,890\nyou might know the deliverable, and you\ncan think of some high level activities.\n\n1053\n00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:30,530\nBut then that expert comes along and\nthey take that high level activity and\n\n1054\n00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:34,580\nthey break it down into additional\nwork packages that are smaller.\n\n1055\n00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,360\nAll right?\n\n1056\n00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,420\nNow here's a key thing that may\nnot seem like common sense, but\n\n1057\n00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,220\non the exam it's important.\n\n1058\n00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:46,580\nIn a work breakdown structure If you have\na work package and you break it down\n\n1059\n00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:53,810\ninto subpackages, this work package\nshould not actually be work itself.\n\n1060\n00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:58,626\nThere's zero work associated with\nthis entity right here, 2.1.\n\n1061\n00:53:58,626 --> 00:54:03,018\nBut instead If activity 2.1.1 and 2.1.2,\n\n1062\n00:54:03,018 --> 00:54:10,230\nif those two work packages get done, they\ncomplete this work package, all right?\n\n1063\n00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:16,300\nSo these guys, deliverable to activity\n2.1, those are just placeholders and\n\n1064\n00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:22,100\nthen it's the lowest level that actually\nrepresents true work, all right?\n\n1065\n00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,430\nSo this might say it lays foundation.\n\n1066\n00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,830\nAnd then I have work packages for\nall the work,\n\n1067\n00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,720\nthe actual work that needs to be\ndone to lay that foundation and\n\n1068\n00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,040\nwhen all of these are done,\nthis one is automatically done.\n\n1069\n00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:39,360\nThere's no actual work associated\nwith that element, versus over here,\n\n1070\n00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,610\nthese have no sub elements, so\nthese are actual work, right?\n\n1071\n00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,260\nSo it's whatever the lowest tier is.\n\n1072\n00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:52,550\nThese are actual work, this is actual\nwork, this is not, it's a place holder.\n\n1073\n00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:56,040\nThis is not, it's a place holder.\nThe project as a whole is a place holder.\n\n1074\n00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,290\nThis is the actual work,\nthe lowest level, here.\n\n1075\n00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,730\nThe lowest level inside of that\ntree is the actual work package.\n\n1076\n00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:07,660\nSomebody has to go and\ndo this physical work to get this done.\n\n1077\n00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:11,530\nThat's what a work breakdown structure is\nall about, and you're not gonna get it\n\n1078\n00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:15,660\non the first draft unless you're repeating\na project that's been done before.\n\n1079\n00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:19,460\nIf you're building a house odds are you're\nnot the very first person to build\n\n1080\n00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,530\na house ever.\n\n1081\n00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:23,640\nSo there's probably a work breakdown\nstructure in your environment that\n\n1082\n00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,320\nalready shows the stuff\nthat needs to be done.\n\n1083\n00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,260\nSo how is this going to be customized?\n\n1084\n00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,310\nSo you might have some unique\nstuff that's in there, but\n\n1085\n00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:33,310\nthe overall process for building\nthe house is going to be the same.\n\n1086\n00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:36,160\nSo you might start out with a work\nbreakdown structure that already has\n\n1087\n00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,320\nsome data in it and\nthen you just elaborate.\n\n1088\n00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,630\nSo progressive elaboration,\n\n1089\n00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,550\nthat's an important term,\nremember that one because it will turn up.\n\n1090\n00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,020\nAll right, well Ronnie looking at the\nclock it's about time for us to stop and\n\n1091\n00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,550\ntake a break.\n\n1092\n00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,010\nSo why don't we pause here.\n\n1093\n00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,030\nWhen we get back we're going to talk more\nabout the work break down structure.\n\n1094\n00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:58,102\nWe've got a few other tools and techniques\nand things that are in there And so\n\n1095\n00:55:58,102 --> 00:56:01,550\nwe're gonna look at that and\nkind of see how that process works.\n\n1096\n00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,494\nSo, we'll stop here and\nwe'll see you back in a few.\n\n1097\n00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:09,425\n[MUSIC]\n\n1098\n00:56:12,304 --> 00:56:16,380\nAll right, so now we're gonna continue on\nwith the old work breakdown structure.\n\n1099\n00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:16,910\nRight?\n\n1100\n00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:21,171\nOne of the components here inside of our\nTools & Techniques is decomposition.\n\n1101\n00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:21,740\nRight?\n\n1102\n00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,000\nWhich is somewhat morbid,\nI always thought.\n\n1103\n00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,470\nBut, all it means is\ntaking a work package and\n\n1104\n00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,640\nbreaking it down into its sub components.\n\n1105\n00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,120\nAnd continuing to do that until we\nget down to the smallest component.\n\n1106\n00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,740\nNow you don't wanna go too crazy.\n\n1107\n00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:43,270\nThe thing I always remind myself is that\nthis is not corresponding to schedule and\n\n1108\n00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,910\nbudget yet, but\n\n1109\n00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:48,350\neventually we're gonna wanna track\nthis with the schedule and budget.\n\n1110\n00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,940\nBut for right now we're just trying to\nthink of the work that needs to be done.\n\n1111\n00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,140\nDon't worry about who's gonna do the work,\n\n1112\n00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,690\nwe'll figure that out in\nthe human resources processes.\n\n1113\n00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:59,050\nDon't worry about how much it's gonna\ncost, we'll do that in the budget side.\n\n1114\n00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,605\nIf you have that information,\nthough, it can save you some time.\n\n1115\n00:57:01,605 --> 00:57:05,375\nSo, decomposition just means we're\ndecomposing an activity into\n\n1116\n00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:05,935\nits smallest parts.\n\n1117\n00:57:05,935 --> 00:57:11,155\nWe're breaking it down and\nkind of building our project from there.\n\n1118\n00:57:11,155 --> 00:57:15,445\nSo, if we take something\nlike building a house.\n\n1119\n00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:16,260\nRight?\nSo\n\n1120\n00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:22,250\nI already said that hey\nif I wanna build a house.\n\n1121\n00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,890\nI wanna build a house.\n\n1122\n00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:29,755\nSo that's what I wanna do, and at a high\nlevel I know we need to do a few things.\n\n1123\n00:57:29,755 --> 00:57:33,466\nRight?\nWe need to buy some land.\n\n1124\n00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:34,770\nRight?\n\n1125\n00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:37,630\nWe need to lay foundation.\n\n1126\n00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,310\nWe need to put up walls.\n\n1127\n00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,800\nI think they call that framing the house.\n\n1128\n00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,410\nRight?\n\n1129\n00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:44,530\nSo we need to frame the house.\n\n1130\n00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:49,331\nWe need to put on a roof [NOISE].\n\n1131\n00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:53,321\nWe need to put in, we need to plum it.\n\n1132\n00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:58,187\n[NOISE] We need to get electric,\n\n1133\n00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:01,373\nwe need to dry wall.\n\n1134\n00:58:01,373 --> 00:58:05,088\nWe need carpet and we need paint.\n\n1135\n00:58:05,088 --> 00:58:07,828\nAll right, when all that's done I'm done.\n\n1136\n00:58:07,828 --> 00:58:09,870\nMy house is done, right?\n\n1137\n00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:12,110\nBut, that's just the first stage.\n\n1138\n00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:13,520\nI've got my high level stuff.\n\n1139\n00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,200\nNow I need to break it down even further.\n\n1140\n00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:16,750\nOkay?\n\n1141\n00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,290\nSo let's take buy land.\n\n1142\n00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,960\nI wanna buy some land for the house.\n\n1143\n00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,480\nRight?\n\n1144\n00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,680\nSo, what's actually involved now?\n\n1145\n00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,290\nWhat actual work do we have to do?\n\n1146\n00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,330\nI'm gonna decompose.\n\n1147\n00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:26,930\nI'm gonna break down the buy land.\n\n1148\n00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:30,690\nWork package into smaller work packages,\nright?\n\n1149\n00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,060\nSo what do we have to do?\n\n1150\n00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:38,810\nI think most people start with step one,\nis secure a realtor, right?\n\n1151\n00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:42,480\nSo we've got to get somebody\nto help us find some land.\n\n1152\n00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,880\nIt would probably be a good idea\nto come up with requirements.\n\n1153\n00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,380\n>> Yep.\n\n1154\n00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,350\n>> For the land, you know.\n\n1155\n00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,060\n>> How much?\n\n1156\n00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,700\n>> If you're going to build a big\nhouse you need a lot of land.\n\n1157\n00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,770\nOr maybe it's a small house but\nyou just want a lot of land because you've\n\n1158\n00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:59,260\ngot pets or kids or whatever and\nyou want that area.\n\n1159\n00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:05,050\nMaybe you want that land to be near town,\nin town, out of town, whatever.\n\n1160\n00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,150\nYou've got requirements.\n\n1161\n00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:07,686\nWe need to come up with\nthat list of requirements.\n\n1162\n00:59:07,686 --> 00:59:09,949\nFor the land, all right?\n\n1163\n00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:16,140\nWe need to select the land, right?\n\n1164\n00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,730\nWe're gonna get some choices.\n\n1165\n00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:21,420\nWe're gonna have to pick the land\nthat we want before we can buy it.\n\n1166\n00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,529\nWe may need to secure financing.\n\n1167\n00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,190\nAnd if we're gonna secure\nfinancing we probably need to,\n\n1168\n00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,620\nwell hey I'll talk about that in a second.\n\n1169\n00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,690\nWhat else might we need there Ronnie?\n\n1170\n00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:37,050\n>> I can't think of anything much else.\n\n1171\n00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,000\n>> Okay.\n\n1172\n00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,580\nSo we're done.\n\n1173\n00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,590\nNow we know all the work to buy land,\nright?\n\n1174\n00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,100\nNot necessarily.\n\n1175\n00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,490\nNow we do another pass and\nwe see if we can decompose this further.\n\n1176\n00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,070\nSecure realtor.\n\n1177\n00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:48,450\nWhat's that gonna take?\n\n1178\n00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:49,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n1179\n00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,968\n>> So we need to get a list of realtors.\n\n1180\n00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:59,064\nWe need to compare realtors and\n\n1181\n00:59:59,064 --> 01:00:03,820\nselect a winner, right?\n\n1182\n01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,920\nWe have many realtors to chose from.\n\n1183\n01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,245\nHow do we know which one we want?\n\n1184\n01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:09,140\nRight?\nWe need to get a list of the realtors.\n\n1185\n01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,010\nWell, how do we get that list of realtors?\n\n1186\n01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:15,761\nNow we break this down and\nwe say that we can call the,\n\n1187\n01:00:15,761 --> 01:00:18,330\nwhat's the realtor association?\n\n1188\n01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,280\n>> Theres a..\n\n1189\n01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,350\nI don't know.\n\n1190\n01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:27,110\n>> American Associates of Realtors or\nsomething like that, so I'll just say,\n\n1191\n01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:29,390\ncall the realtor association.\n\n1192\n01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,080\nRight?\n\n1193\n01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,690\nWe can look at trade materials.\n\n1194\n01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:37,580\nThese would be things like,\nyou see the house buyers guides and\n\n1195\n01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,470\nstuff like that that are on\nevery street corner.\n\n1196\n01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,683\n>> We may get referrals.\n\n1197\n01:00:40,683 --> 01:00:45,222\n>> Yeah, get referrals from friends.\n\n1198\n01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:49,270\nApparently, I don't know how to spell\nreferrals, couple extra Rs in there.\n\n1199\n01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,710\nWe might check the phone book.\n\n1200\n01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:55,790\nNow I'm putting in here, and\nsome of these sound kind of dumb, but\n\n1201\n01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:59,270\nchecking the phone book for somebody\nto get the phone book, go in there,\n\n1202\n01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:01,940\nfind the realtors, make a list,\nthat takes time, you know?\n\n1203\n01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,510\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know,\n\n1204\n01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,440\nthis is time that's measurable, it's an\nelement that's going to have to be done.\n\n1205\n01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,520\nSomebody is going to have to do this,\nthis is work, actual work.\n\n1206\n01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,790\nAnother thing that's\nworth mentioning here,\n\n1207\n01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:13,740\nI kind of wrote this out chronologically.\n\n1208\n01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,710\nBut it isn't necessarily in\nchronological order here.\n\n1209\n01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,160\nI'm just trying to figure out\nthe work that needs to be done.\n\n1210\n01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,270\nWe'll worry about timing\nlater cuz we may find, for\n\n1211\n01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:26,690\nexample, that maybe the electric has to\ngo into the house before the plumbing.\n\n1212\n01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:27,620\nI don't know.\n\n1213\n01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,570\nMaybe they can be done at the same time.\n\n1214\n01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:32,820\nSo, these two events might actually\nbe occurring simultaneously.\n\n1215\n01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:37,452\nSo, don't worry about\nthe chronological order yet, right?\n\n1216\n01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:40,856\nAll right, I think we've probably broken\nthis one down as far as it needs to go.\n\n1217\n01:01:40,856 --> 01:01:42,470\nWhen do you stop?\n\n1218\n01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:45,560\nWhen do you decide not to\nbreak it down any further?\n\n1219\n01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,800\nWell, it's kind of up to you.\n\n1220\n01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,900\nI usually break it down to the point where\nI know that one person can achieve that or\n\n1221\n01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:56,300\none team can achieve that job,\nwithout further direction.\n\n1222\n01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:00,380\nSo if I tell somebody to check the\nphonebook, and get me a list of realtors.\n\n1223\n01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,670\nThere's not really much more\nI can do to break that down.\n\n1224\n01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:06,440\nI could specify what phone book,\nor whatever.\n\n1225\n01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,060\nThey are pretty much gonna\nknow what to do at that point.\n\n1226\n01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:12,960\nYou also don't wanna micromanage because\nit's gonna limit people's productivity, so\n\n1227\n01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,170\nwe want to leave some room for them to,\nyou know, reach their own decisions.\n\n1228\n01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,570\n>> Yeah,\nwhen it comes down to the pen bach,\n\n1229\n01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:22,530\nthey kind of describe this\na little bit unusually, right?\n\n1230\n01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,680\nThe idea of breaking it down in terms\nof decomposition is decomposing it to\n\n1231\n01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,800\nthe point where it's\na manageable work unit, right?\n\n1232\n01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,530\nA manageable work package.\n\n1233\n01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:31,920\nSo you don't have to micromanage the book.\n\n1234\n01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,085\nMake sure you choose this phone book,\nDon, not this one.\n\n1235\n01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, but\n\n1236\n01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:40,190\nso that you're able to say, okay, remember\nthese are the steps you have to do.\n\n1237\n01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,650\nYou can actually manage it.\n\n1238\n01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,690\nAnd so you may, at that point,\nleave that leeway.\n\n1239\n01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,930\nAnd then you don't decompose any further.\n\n1240\n01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,040\nSay, remember, you can only do\nthis on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n1241\n01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> But not Friday.\n\n1242\n01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:53,860\n>> And now we would need to continue and\ndecompose the other elements,\n\n1243\n01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,510\nso compare realtors and select a winner.\n\n1244\n01:02:56,510 --> 01:03:01,500\nSo someone is going to have\nto choose selection criteria.\n\n1245\n01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:06,960\nSomeone's gonna have to choose, or\n\n1246\n01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,629\nsomebody's going to have to\ndetermine the criteria values for\n\n1247\n01:03:12,629 --> 01:03:17,390\neach realtor, right?\n\n1248\n01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:21,190\nSo maybe one of my criteria is\nhow many houses have they sold\n\n1249\n01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:23,280\nin this neighborhood in the last year?\n\n1250\n01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:23,790\nRight?\n\n1251\n01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:28,860\nSo, realtor A might have 500 houses,\nrealtor B might have 100 houses, right?\n\n1252\n01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:31,217\nSo, I need to know what the criteria are,\nand\n\n1253\n01:03:31,217 --> 01:03:34,020\nthen I need to find out the criteria for\neach realtor.\n\n1254\n01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:39,168\nThen I need to assign\na weight to each criteria,\n\n1255\n01:03:39,168 --> 01:03:45,360\nbecause some are going to be\nmore important than others.\n\n1256\n01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,040\nSo, I need to determine which\nones are more important to me.\n\n1257\n01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,400\nAnd then, finally, I need to select.\n\n1258\n01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,580\nThe winner.\n\n1259\n01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:55,280\nSo like who it is that's actually\ngoing to be our realtor, all right?\n\n1260\n01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,590\nSo you do this,\nyou repeat this for each of these.\n\n1261\n01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,580\nAnd you might only have\nto go one level deep.\n\n1262\n01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,980\nYou might have to go five levels deep.\n\n1263\n01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,440\nYou know for me starting here\nat the parent I went one, two,\n\n1264\n01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,060\nthree, four levels deep to get\nto my actual work packages here.\n\n1265\n01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:13,760\nI might find later on something like\ncarpet, it may only go down two levels.\n\n1266\n01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,050\nBecause I might have a work package\nunder here which is find a contractor,\n\n1267\n01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:19,340\nand one that's hire him.\n\n1268\n01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:22,010\nSo basically just pay somebody\nelse to worry about it.\n\n1269\n01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:25,430\nThey will have to break it down\neven further for themselves, but\n\n1270\n01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:28,280\nwhen you get like a fixed rate quote,\nyou don't care what they have to do,\n\n1271\n01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,970\nyou've got one dollar assigned you pay and\nthey're going to do it.\n\n1272\n01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:35,590\nSo you're basically pushing that off,\nyou're kind of outsourcing.\n\n1273\n01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:38,250\nIt's like a subproject at that\npoint getting the carpet installed.\n\n1274\n01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:42,710\nSo you just have to revisit this and\ncontinue to decompose all the way down\n\n1275\n01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,980\nuntil you get into that\nmanageable work package.\n\n1276\n01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,795\nWhere it's something that's,\nit's gotta be trackable.\n\n1277\n01:04:47,795 --> 01:04:50,310\nRight?\nWe gotta be able to monitor its progress\n\n1278\n01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:54,320\nand know when it's done, so\ndon't have something subjective in there.\n\n1279\n01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,340\nAnd, basically break it down to that.\n\n1280\n01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:00,870\nI usually do outlines, just like what\nyou see here, in Microsoft Word.\n\n1281\n01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:04,450\nCuz, it has this nice outline view that\nlet's you collapse, and expand, and stuff.\n\n1282\n01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:06,610\nBut, you can do it this way.\n\n1283\n01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:11,450\nOr, you can do what they show in\nthe PMBOK, which is a design like this.\n\n1284\n01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,210\nThis is called a work\nbreakdown structure diagram.\n\n1285\n01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,830\nYou can do both.\n\n1286\n01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:18,880\nYou can start with an outline and\nthen turn it into a diagram.\n\n1287\n01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,700\nAnd if you're using some software out\nthere like Microsoft Project you can\n\n1288\n01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,160\ngenerate these.\n\n1289\n01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,710\nI don't typically do these, but\nthe other thing is these don't always make\n\n1290\n01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:31,120\nsense because they're not following\na chronological order or whatever.\n\n1291\n01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,420\nUsually when I deal with diagrams,\n\n1292\n01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,928\nI worry about it when we\nget to the scheduling side.\n\n1293\n01:05:34,928 --> 01:05:36,310\nAll right.\n\n1294\n01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:42,060\nSo once we've done all of that, now\nwe've got our work breakdown structure,\n\n1295\n01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:46,740\nwe've got the, you know what?\n\n1296\n01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,420\nThis is wrong, my outputs are wrong.\n\n1297\n01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,550\nHang on a second.\n\n1298\n01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,850\nSo our outputs here, are my outputs right?\n\n1299\n01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:59,660\n>> No, your outputs are right,\njust a couple that we didn't add in there.\n\n1300\n01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:00,690\n>> Okay.\n>> Yep, yeah.\n\n1301\n01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,030\n>> That WBS itself, and the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1302\n01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:05,020\n>> Once we start to create the WBS, yeah,\nthat's why I said the output is wrong,\n\n1303\n01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,230\nif we're creating a WBS,\nthat should be one of our outputs.\n\n1304\n01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> So let me pull it up in the pin box,\n\n1305\n01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,090\nmake sure I show you guys the right thing.\n\n1306\n01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,770\nWe are creating the WBS, which is 5.4, so\n\n1307\n01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:19,090\nlet me jump up to that in the book here.\n\n1308\n01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:22,610\nOops, well here I'll find the diagram.\n\n1309\n01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,199\nIt should be right around here,\ncollect requirements.\n\n1310\n01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,598\nYou know, it's convenient,\nhere we go, here.\n\n1311\n01:06:32,598 --> 01:06:35,180\nCreat a WBS, oh and I am right,\n\n1312\n01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:39,880\nthat is interesting, I would have assumed\nthat the WBS was one of the outputs.\n\n1313\n01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,630\nSo one of our outputs here is jut the\nscope baseline, which includes the WBS, so\n\n1314\n01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:48,110\nthat works, but I could have sworn that\nit was listed as it's own element.\n\n1315\n01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,054\nI shouldn't have doubted my own-\n>> [CROSSTALK] as it's own element.\n\n1316\n01:06:50,054 --> 01:06:51,480\n>> All right.\n\n1317\n01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,200\nWell, when we talk about our outputs,\nwhat are we outputting?\n\n1318\n01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,320\nWell, the work breakdown structure, right?\n\n1319\n01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,470\nThe work breakdown structure,\nthat list of work that needs to be done.\n\n1320\n01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:03,910\nWell, the work that needs to be done,\nit's being done to fulfill the needs\n\n1321\n01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:08,325\nof your scope, and so you'll see what's\nlisted here as the scope baseline.\n\n1322\n01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:08,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1323\n01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,670\n>> Now that term baseline,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n1324\n01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:15,960\nA baseline is a snapshot,\na point in time reference.\n\n1325\n01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:21,210\nThis is the work that needs to\nbe done as we know it right now.\n\n1326\n01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:24,100\nThrough the life of your project,\nchanges are gonna happen.\n\n1327\n01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,780\nYou're gonna submit change tickets.\n\n1328\n01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,490\nModifications will happen.\n\n1329\n01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,720\nModifications will often happen to\nthe work breakdown structure as you\n\n1330\n01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,590\nfind new work that needs to be done.\n\n1331\n01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:36,050\nSo you'll have multiple\nversions of your WBS.\n\n1332\n01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:38,680\nYour scope baseline, your original one,\n\n1333\n01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,380\nwill be the scope as determined at\nthe beginning of your project, and\n\n1334\n01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:45,930\nwhen you move into execution there\nwill be little changes that occur.\n\n1335\n01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:48,720\nSo now you've got a newer\nversion of the scope\n\n1336\n01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,030\nthat you compare back to that baseline.\n\n1337\n01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:54,540\nCuz you used the baseline to plan\nyour budget and schedule and\n\n1338\n01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:55,580\nall that good stuff.\n\n1339\n01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,840\nSo the WBS itself,\nall the work that needs to be done.\n\n1340\n01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,530\nIs a part of that baseline.\n\n1341\n01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:02,990\nIt's one of the components\nto fall inside of it.\n\n1342\n01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:06,880\nRonnie your notes have that.\n\n1343\n01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,460\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1344\n01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,180\n>> Get into our app.\n\n1345\n01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,505\nHere we go.\nProject scope statement, and so, or no,\n\n1346\n01:08:10,505 --> 01:08:13,455\nthat's the wrong spot, here we go.\n\n1347\n01:08:13,455 --> 01:08:18,425\n>> I kinda separate, I did not put\nWBS underneath scope A's language.\n\n1348\n01:08:18,425 --> 01:08:21,004\nThat's probably why it's [CROSSTALK].\n\n1349\n01:08:21,004 --> 01:08:21,859\n>> Yeah, so we just need to\nbump all these into one. So,\n\n1350\n01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:26,525\nand I'm just gonna rearrange\nthis a little bit here.\n\n1351\n01:08:26,525 --> 01:08:31,480\nThe WBS itself, which is that statement\nof the work that needs to be done.\n\n1352\n01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,860\nAnd, we'll see that the WBS\nis just a really a diagram.\n\n1353\n01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:40,890\nNow, you don't have a whole heck of a lot\nof room as you're creating that WBS,\n\n1354\n01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:43,700\nespecially if you doing a diagram,\nyou're going to have simple words.\n\n1355\n01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,440\nSo, a lot of times,\nyou're going to use abbreviations, and\n\n1356\n01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,280\nother terminology that may be\nunique to your organization.\n\n1357\n01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:53,740\nSo typically when you draft the WBS,\n\n1358\n01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:59,620\nat the same time you're creating\na WBS dictionary, all right?\n\n1359\n01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:03,650\nThe WBS dictionary is what it sounds like,\nit's dictionary that lists\n\n1360\n01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:06,530\nall the terminology that you used in\nyour work breakdown structure and\n\n1361\n01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:07,540\nwhat it actually means.\n\n1362\n01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,750\nSo you're kind of elaborating on it,\nthe deliverables, the activities,\n\n1363\n01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:15,330\nany other scheduling information you\nmight have, any budgeting information,\n\n1364\n01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:18,510\nall of that other stuff that just didn't\nfit in that nice little outline view,\n\n1365\n01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:21,820\ngoes into this WBS dictionary, all right?\n\n1366\n01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:25,290\nAnd so you'll see all of the different\nthings that you'll want to put in there.\n\n1367\n01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:29,050\nDescriptions of the work, assumptions and\nconstraints, most of the stuff is really\n\n1368\n01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:31,040\nstraightforward stuff we\nalready talked about.\n\n1369\n01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,600\nOne of the only things that makes it in\nhere that we haven't talked about so far.\n\n1370\n01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,960\nIs this guy right here, you know?\n\n1371\n01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,500\nCode of account identifier.\n\n1372\n01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:43,070\nMany organizations will have to,\neven if you're using your\n\n1373\n01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:46,800\nown employees internally,\nwill have to handle billing, right?\n\n1374\n01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,250\nSo my company, if I'm designing a website.\n\n1375\n01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,550\nI may have web designers on staff.\n\n1376\n01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:54,960\nWhen I bring one of my web\ndesigners into the project,\n\n1377\n01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,520\nI may need to show financially\nthat my project is paying for\n\n1378\n01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,130\ntheir time while they're\nworking on my project.\n\n1379\n01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:03,490\nAnd when they're working\non somebody else's project,\n\n1380\n01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,920\ntheir time is being paid\nby that other project.\n\n1381\n01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,980\nSo we may have a code\nof account identifier.\n\n1382\n01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:13,670\nThat shows when I'm using that\nweb designer, they have a salary.\n\n1383\n01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:17,300\nAnd here's what I'm paying per\nhour while I use them, and\n\n1384\n01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,940\nhere's the code that I credit that too.\n\n1385\n01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:22,670\nSo, when the billing takes place\nin our accounting department,\n\n1386\n01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:24,110\nthey know that this isn't a real bill.\n\n1387\n01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:25,530\nI'm not cutting a check.\n\n1388\n01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:28,980\nThey're just saying when that person's\nsalary gets paid from the company,\n\n1389\n01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:34,560\nit's being charged to my project so we can\ntell exactly how much my project costs.\n\n1390\n01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,360\nIt's a very common thing.\n\n1391\n01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,590\nSome people call it internal billing,\nthere's different names for it.\n\n1392\n01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:42,780\nBut you may have a code\nsystem that references that.\n\n1393\n01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,700\nAnd the code system is\ncompletely arbitrary.\n\n1394\n01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,260\nIt's determined by you guys.\n\n1395\n01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:49,140\nBut it's normally one of the most\ncommon ones that I've seen.\n\n1396\n01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:53,920\nWhere it will be like a three number,\nseparated by decimals.\n\n1397\n01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,780\nThe first digit will\nidentify your department.\n\n1398\n01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,920\nIf I'm in IT,\nthat might be department five.\n\n1399\n01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,345\nSo it'll be five dot,\n\n1400\n01:11:00,345 --> 01:11:05,040\nand then after that it'll be one\nthat'll identify the type of expense.\n\n1401\n01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,084\nSo you'll have things like facilities,\n\n1402\n01:11:09,084 --> 01:11:13,830\nmaintenance, subscriptions, projects.\n\n1403\n01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:15,070\nThen you'll have a period.\n\n1404\n01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:19,300\nThen under projects you'll have this third\none which is identifying your project.\n\n1405\n01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:25,245\nSo, when you start up you might have a\nproject that says your project is 5.2.371,\n\n1406\n01:11:25,245 --> 01:11:25,813\nright.\n\n1407\n01:11:25,813 --> 01:11:29,218\nSo anything that needs to get billed\nto your project will use that code of\n\n1408\n01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:30,430\naccounting.\n\n1409\n01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:33,970\nWell, that web designer may\nhave his own code of account.\n\n1410\n01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:36,450\nAnd it refers back to\nthe web design department.\n\n1411\n01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:37,730\nSo it will be an IT.\n\n1412\n01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:39,040\nSo five dot.\n\n1413\n01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,450\nAnd the web designers might be .12.\n\n1414\n01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:46,910\nAnd then the allocation code or whatever\nthat follows the references that we're.\n\n1415\n01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:49,850\nBasically pulling one of these\nassets billed to our project.\n\n1416\n01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:54,076\nSo code of account identifiers, if you\nuse them, you wanna put those in the work\n\n1417\n01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:57,234\nbreakdown structure to specify\nwhere the money is going for\n\n1418\n01:11:57,234 --> 01:12:01,230\neach of these work breakdown structure\nwork activities or work packages.\n\n1419\n01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:06,000\nAll right, but all the other stuff here,\nis if we have it, great.\n\n1420\n01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,580\nIf you know the resources required,\nif you know the people and\n\n1421\n01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,620\nmaterials, great, put it in there.\n\n1422\n01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,530\nIf you know the cost,\nquality, the schedule,\n\n1423\n01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,950\nif you know that stuff put it in there.\n\n1424\n01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:18,150\nIf you don't know,\nwe'll determine it later and\n\n1425\n01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:19,490\nwe'll put it in here after the fact.\n\n1426\n01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:22,570\nSo we may have to come to\nour WBS later on, right?\n\n1427\n01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:27,130\nYou'll see any acceptance criteria,\nwhich should be in our scope already.\n\n1428\n01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:29,230\nOur agreement information.\n\n1429\n01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:33,412\nAll of that stuff should be there.\n\n1430\n01:12:33,412 --> 01:12:37,249\nAll right, and then, project document\nupdates, what we kind of expect to see.\n\n1431\n01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,000\nAll right now I did just a quick and\n\n1432\n01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,230\ndirty example here of a work break\ndown structure and we saw the diagram.\n\n1433\n01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:47,740\nBut let me show you guys a couple of\nother templates that we may use if\n\n1434\n01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:50,750\nwe have a scope management plan, right?\n\n1435\n01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,180\nSo going back to this idea,\n\n1436\n01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:55,990\nthe scope management plan will likely\ntell us how to build our work break down\n\n1437\n01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:59,310\nstructure it will tell us whether we\nshould be using code of accounting.\n\n1438\n01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:01,070\nIt will tell us the things to have.\n\n1439\n01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:05,470\nAnd so if I go into my templates,\nwhere did I put those?\n\n1440\n01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:06,600\nHere we go.\n\n1441\n01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,920\nSo on the work breakdown structure,\nI'll just pull this one up here.\n\n1442\n01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,990\nSo this is the one from the PMI site.\n\n1443\n01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:13,840\nI had to redo it to get it to work here.\n\n1444\n01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,655\nBut you'll see that it's just this\nstraight up layout here of an outline and\n\n1445\n01:13:17,655 --> 01:13:19,994\nthey just went ahead and\nassign numbers to it.\n\n1446\n01:13:19,994 --> 01:13:25,197\nSo we can do it that way just like I\nshowed in my little notepad window there.\n\n1447\n01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:25,940\nAll right?\n\n1448\n01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:30,072\nThe dictionary, if I go back to my work\n\n1449\n01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:35,450\nbreakdown structure dictionary here we go.\n\n1450\n01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:38,890\nThis is a little more complex,\nbecause the dictionary is cataloging\n\n1451\n01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:42,220\nall sorts of different stuff, so let's\ntake a look at some of the things that\n\n1452\n01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,980\nare found in the work breakdown\nstructure dictionary.\n\n1453\n01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:47,740\nWe've got the work package name, so\n\n1454\n01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:52,230\nwe're gonna have a page in the dictionary\nfor every single work package.\n\n1455\n01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:55,460\nSo this is referencing one thing, right.\n\n1456\n01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,980\nMaybe this is for our realtor one, right?\n\n1457\n01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,760\nSo get referrals from friends.\n\n1458\n01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,420\nSo that's gonna be our work package.\n\n1459\n01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:03,970\nThe code of account for\nthis package, right?\n\n1460\n01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:04,920\nWho's gonna get billed for this?\n\n1461\n01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,845\n>> Right.\n\n1462\n01:14:05,845 --> 01:14:08,325\nThe description of the work\nthat needs to get done.\n\n1463\n01:14:08,325 --> 01:14:11,435\nWhat do we need to do to go out and\nget these referrals.\n\n1464\n01:14:11,435 --> 01:14:13,015\nAnd then any assumptions and constraints.\n\n1465\n01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:15,875\nAssumption might be that we have\nfriends but no realtors, right?\n\n1466\n01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,455\nSo there we go.\n\n1467\n01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:22,400\nThen if this work package is big enough,\nit might have milestones in it.\n\n1468\n01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,030\nRight?\n\n1469\n01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:25,360\nOr we might set some arbitrary ones,\nor we're getting referrals.\n\n1470\n01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,420\nSo, we wanna get 15 referrals, so\nI'll have milestones at five, 10 and 15.\n\n1471\n01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:33,140\nSo they can let us know, hey, yeah I've\ngot five I'm still working on more.\n\n1472\n01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,500\nNow I've got 10.\n\n1473\n01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,610\nIf it's a big one.\n\n1474\n01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:38,020\nBut if this is a simple thing,\nit might only take and hour or two,\n\n1475\n01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,420\nwe don't normally bother\nwith the milestones.\n\n1476\n01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,890\nAnd then due dates,\nwhen this needs to be done by.\n\n1477\n01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:47,190\nAll right.\nAfter that, we break down any activities\n\n1478\n01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:51,640\nthat might be a part of this work\npackage if it breaks down further.\n\n1479\n01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:56,310\nIf it doesn't, then we just have one\nactivity and we specify its ID number.\n\n1480\n01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:58,820\nThat ID number will be important later\non cause we're gonna tie it in to\n\n1481\n01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:02,990\nthe schedule and you can specify\nthe resources if you know them,\n\n1482\n01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:05,480\nthe amount of time,\nthe rate, the total, right?\n\n1483\n01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,080\nThis is all gonna be\nleading towards your cost.\n\n1484\n01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,110\nYour materials,\n\n1485\n01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:13,200\nagain, leading towards cost until you\nget a total here for your total cost.\n\n1486\n01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,850\nSo this will help with scheduling and\nbudgeting down the road.\n\n1487\n01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,700\nAnd here well see the other things\nthat were in the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1488\n01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,790\nQuality requirements, acceptance criteria,\ntechnical information,\n\n1489\n01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,060\nagreement information.\n\n1490\n01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,820\nAll right, right out of the pin box.\n\n1491\n01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:30,590\nSo we'll create these for\neach of our work package elements and\n\n1492\n01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:33,730\nwe'll bond those together and\nthat will be our work breakdown structure.\n\n1493\n01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:34,680\nDictionary.\n\n1494\n01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,825\nSo when you look at the WBS itself,\nit's pretty high level.\n\n1495\n01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:40,450\n[INAUDIBLE] of explanation in it.\n\n1496\n01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:43,260\nBut then you go to the dictionary for\nthat particular package, and\n\n1497\n01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,060\nyou'll find everything you need.\n\n1498\n01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,810\nDescriptions of the word,\nyou know, terminology that we used.\n\n1499\n01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,060\nAnything that is in here that's special,\n\n1500\n01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:53,140\nit's all gonna be right\nhere in the WBS dictionary.\n\n1501\n01:15:55,412 --> 01:15:59,470\n>> All right and I also mentioned\nthe scope management plan, right?\n\n1502\n01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:02,134\nSo let's go back to that, cause it's kind\nof the last piece of this whole puzzle.\n\n1503\n01:16:02,134 --> 01:16:07,810\nYou know, if we go back to the,\nlet's see, that's not what I want.\n\n1504\n01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:13,570\nIf we go back to the pin back,\nthe only other\n\n1505\n01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:18,600\nelement that we've got here, we collected\nour requirements in the last episode.\n\n1506\n01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,860\nI just cannot click today.\n\n1507\n01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,190\nWe collected our requirements\nin the last episode.\n\n1508\n01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:25,490\nWe define the scope at\nthe beginning of this episode.\n\n1509\n01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,190\nWe just created our WBS,\n\n1510\n01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:31,550\nthe only thing we really didn't do\nwas that scope management plan.\n\n1511\n01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:34,870\nIf you're company already has one,\ngreat, but you may need to create one.\n\n1512\n01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:38,590\nSo now that we've got this under our belt,\nnow that we've seen how we gather our\n\n1513\n01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:42,460\nrequirements, we've seen how we created\nour WBS we'll wanna go back and\n\n1514\n01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:45,250\ncreate a scope management plan,\nso that we've got it.\n\n1515\n01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,910\nAnd, the next time we go\nthrough this process,\n\n1516\n01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:51,080\nwe'll be able to use that\nplan to direct us, right?\n\n1517\n01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:55,520\nSo, if I go back here and\npull up my scope management plan template,\n\n1518\n01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,370\nwe'll see in here,\nscope statement development.\n\n1519\n01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:01,720\nHow do you create your scope statement,\nright?\n\n1520\n01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:08,574\nSo, we might put in here,\nuse template scope_statement.docx.\n\n1521\n01:17:08,574 --> 01:17:09,430\nRight?\n\n1522\n01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:10,440\nVery specific.\n\n1523\n01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:14,680\nUse this template, and\nthen get review from these people,\n\n1524\n01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,610\nand put this information.\n\n1525\n01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:19,930\nSo all the details we need on how our\ncompany creates scope statements.\n\n1526\n01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:23,030\nAnd then,\nhow do we create our WBS structure.\n\n1527\n01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:24,270\nIt's gotta be a diagram.\n\n1528\n01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:26,860\nAnd you've got to use\nPrimavera to generate it.\n\n1529\n01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:27,430\nAll right.\n\n1530\n01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:30,300\nOr, it might be just do an outline and\nuse word.\n\n1531\n01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,710\nDon't do anything crazy.\n\n1532\n01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:33,690\nYou specify how you create\nthat work breakdown structure.\n\n1533\n01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:35,860\nThe WBS dictionary.\n\n1534\n01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:36,910\nWhat template do you use?\n\n1535\n01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:38,380\nWhat information needs to be in it?\n\n1536\n01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,540\nSo you're specifying the guidelines\nof how that gets created.\n\n1537\n01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:43,880\nScope baseline maintenance.\n\n1538\n01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,472\nIf we need to change the baseline,\nhow we allow those changes to happen.\n\n1539\n01:17:47,472 --> 01:17:50,420\nWe're gonna see that later on, so\nI don't wanna dive too deep into that.\n\n1540\n01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,210\nAnd so\nyou'll see the baseline maintenance,\n\n1541\n01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:55,290\nthat's how many copies of\nthe scope we wanna mantain.\n\n1542\n01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:56,590\nAnd scope change.\n\n1543\n01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,040\nHow we make those changes\nthat generates those copies.\n\n1544\n01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,040\nSo, those two are linked together.\n\n1545\n01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,780\nHow we determine deliverable acceptance.\n\n1546\n01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,820\nThis isn't the deliverable acceptance for\nour project.\n\n1547\n01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,780\nThis is how we determine it for\nany project.\n\n1548\n01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:11,380\nAnd then scope and\nrequirements integration.\n\n1549\n01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,270\nAre all of our requirements\nlisted in the scope?\n\n1550\n01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:15,910\nIs there a separate requirement socket?\n\n1551\n01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:17,140\nAnd are they tied together?\n\n1552\n01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,830\nI tied them together in our example.\n\n1553\n01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:20,030\nI said see exhibit A.\n\n1554\n01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:23,650\nSo we can specify that here if you\nhave a separate requirements sheet,\n\n1555\n01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:26,960\nattach it as an exhibit to the scope, you\nknow, that's the kind of thing that you\n\n1556\n01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,900\nwould put here and when that's done going\nforward, the next time you have to create\n\n1557\n01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,585\na scope statement, you would grab\nthis scope management plan and\n\n1558\n01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:38,420\nyou'd read through it and it's telling you\nhow to go about doing that, all right?\n\n1559\n01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,760\nThat's the purpose of this plan.\n\n1560\n01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,930\nAnd then this becomes part of\nthe project management plan.\n\n1561\n01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:46,280\nAnd so again, the next time you do\na project you've got this overall sweeping\n\n1562\n01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,840\nplan and you go through and\nyou get that data together.\n\n1563\n01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,990\n>> Right.\n>> So there's an example of that.\n\n1564\n01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:53,530\nAnd once that's complete\n\n1565\n01:18:54,730 --> 01:19:00,000\nnow we've actually finished\nthe planning for our scope.\n\n1566\n01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,610\nNow we know what our project needs to do.\n\n1567\n01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:06,330\nWe have a better understanding\nof what we're about to embark on\n\n1568\n01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:08,030\nnow we need to work on details.\n\n1569\n01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,030\nAnd you'll see that's\nthe next several things.\n\n1570\n01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:12,100\nWe need to figure out our schedule.\n\n1571\n01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,020\nWe need figure out our cost.\n\n1572\n01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:16,520\nand we need to figure out our quality.\n\n1573\n01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,530\nQuality really means our, you know,\nhow well we meet our requirements.\n\n1574\n01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:22,450\nSo those are our triple constraints right?\n\n1575\n01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:25,460\nCost, requirements, schedule or budget.\n\n1576\n01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,050\nSo those are the next things\nthat we need to figure out.\n\n1577\n01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:31,560\nBeyond that we've got a few other things\nto worry about is getting resources,\n\n1578\n01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,170\npeople and\nmaterials to complete the project.\n\n1579\n01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,340\nHow we're gonna communicate?\n\n1580\n01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,740\nRight, so these are some other\ncomponents that are in here.\n\n1581\n01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:41,700\nBut the next three things that we do are\nreally important cause they're the details\n\n1582\n01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,230\nand that's how we're gonna start to\nfind out how long this is gonna take,\n\n1583\n01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:49,400\nhow much it's gonna cost us, and whether\nor not we think it's gonna be feasible.\n\n1584\n01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,850\n>> So we're gonna start to see that.\n\n1585\n01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:54,350\nAll right Ronny I think that pretty\nmuch wraps up the scope site.\n\n1586\n01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,830\n>> I think so too.\n>> Can you think of anything I left out?\n\n1587\n01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,280\nNot really, yeah, this is pretty detailed.\n\n1588\n01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,720\n[LAUGH] all right well ladies and\n\n1589\n01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,290\ngentlemen this is good spot for\nus to stop.\n\n1590\n01:20:02,290 -->

an episode, this is really just\na special little segment we're doing as\n\n4\n00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,430\npart of our project management\nprofessional training.\n\n5\n00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,920\nIn the PMP show,\nwe're doing a mock project,\n\n6\n00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,820\nkind of a fun one for us,\non building a video game arcade cabinet.\n\n7\n00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,460\nAnd this is our requirements meeting.\n\n8\n00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,450\nSo, I got our team together here,\nthese are our main project team members.\n\n9\n00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,620\nAnd we're going to be evaluating\nwhat needs to go down.\n\n10\n00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,680\nSo this is a great example of how\nrequirements gathering meeting occurs, and\n\n11\n00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,280\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n12\n00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,648\nI'm the project manager for the project.\n\n13\n00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:48,060\nSo I'm gonna kick it off and\nsay thanks guys for showing up today for\n\n14\n00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,760\nthe meeting that you're\nrequired to attend.\n\n15\n00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,520\n>> You're welcome.\n\n16\n00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,020\n>> You attended like your job depended\non it, which it, of course, did.\n\n17\n00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,510\nSo let me just recap.\n\n18\n00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,330\nIn our first meeting,\nwhich was very impromptu,\n\n19\n00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,580\nbetween Ronnie and I, and\nme yelling at Nate offset.\n\n20\n00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,650\nWe came up with just a basic set of\nrequirements for this arcade cabinet.\n\n21\n00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,820\nSo what we wanted to have and\nI've got it pulled up right here.\n\n22\n00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,785\nWe've basically said that we wanted\na custom built wooden cabinet.\n\n23\n00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:20,480\n>> Yes.\n\n24\n00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,150\n>> Didn't necessarily have to be custom,\nbut it's kind of the fun part of\n\n25\n00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,920\nthe project to actually build it,\nso custom built wooden cabinet.\n\n26\n00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,495\nIt must support up to four players, right\ncuz you could skimp and go, one or two.\n\n27\n00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:33,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's gonna be an upright,\n\n28\n00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,670\ntraditional cabinet.\n\n29\n00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,030\nNot a sitdown cocktail.\n\n30\n00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,340\nIt'll contain a PC.\n\n31\n00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,100\nSo you've gotta have something\nto drive the video games on it.\n\n32\n00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,300\nAnd it will have joy stick and\ntrack ball support.\n\n33\n00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,820\n>> Nice.\n\n34\n00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,061\n>> So that you can play Galaga.\n\n35\n00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:50,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n36\n00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,950\nthen see if we can find a public domain\nGalaga because that's one of our risks.\n\n37\n00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,580\n>> Galaxia.\n\n38\n00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,100\n>> Right.\n\n39\n00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,210\n>> And Galaxia?\n\n40\n00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,950\nAnd then it must create\nan arcade like feel.\n\n41\n00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,437\nSo the overall experience should be\nlike what we had growing up going to\n\n42\n00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:05,650\nAladdin's castle.\n\n43\n00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,590\n>> So it'll randomly eat quarters.\n\n44\n00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,650\n>> That's right, We'll stick a do not, no,\n\n45\n00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,720\nout of order sign right in\nfront of it once a week and\n\n46\n00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,828\nyeah, that'll be, we'll have to get\na screen for it that's kind of washed out.\n\n47\n00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n48\n00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,330\nso these were really\nhigh level requirements.\n\n49\n00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,730\nThey were good enough for our charter.\n\n50\n00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,800\nBut now we're in the planning phase.\n\n51\n00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,890\nAnd so\nwe need to revisit these requirements.\n\n52\n00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,200\nKinda break them down a little bit more\nto get a better understanding of what\n\n53\n00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,060\nwe're actually going to need\nto get this thing done.\n\n54\n00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,250\nAnd this is going to be\nour first pass at it.\n\n55\n00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,740\nSo we might have to revisit this\nagain before it's all said and done,\n\n56\n00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,490\nbefore we do our work\nbreak down structure.\n\n57\n00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,650\nBut for right now,\nI just want to think about these and\n\n58\n00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,255\nreally come up with what our true\nrequirements are going to be.\n\n59\n00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:48,070\nOkay, so\n\n60\n00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,520\nwe've got this kind of simple template\nthat I use here with the requirement.\n\n61\n00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,060\nAnd these are kind of some generic things.\n\n62\n00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,220\nNow, some of these are not totally\nvaluable to me, as far as,\n\n63\n00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,760\nour project, and\nevery project is a little bit different.\n\n64\n00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,060\nSo I'm gonna adjust some of this for\nright now.\n\n65\n00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,330\nAnd actually what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna split some of this\n\n66\n00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,150\noff into another document.\n\n67\n00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,730\nSo, let me just move down here and\n\n68\n00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,560\nwhat I want to do is have a nice\nbig column here for a Description.\n\n69\n00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,950\nAnd then I'll integrate this in to the\ndocument a little bit more later on, okay.\n\n70\n00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,000\nSo, that way we've got plenty\nof room to discuss it.\n\n71\n00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,770\nSo, custom built wooden cabinet.\n\n72\n00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:36,390\nNow, the source for a lot of these,\nI can fill out right now, was Nate, right?\n\n73\n00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,270\nSo, Nathan Copeland who\noriginated the project.\n\n74\n00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,484\nSo, you said that it should\nsupport four players,\n\n75\n00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:46,635\nthe upright cabinet, contains a PC.\n\n76\n00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:49,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Joystick and trackball support.\n\n77\n00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,420\nMost of this came from you.\n\n78\n00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,910\nAs far as priorities and categories,\nwe're gonna need to break that down.\n\n79\n00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,909\nSo let's just start off right here\nwith that custom built wooden cabinet.\n\n80\n00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,650\nWhat does that really entail,\nwhen we say a custom built wooden cabinet?\n\n81\n00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,810\n>> Something to put buttons in, that\nhas a monitor that we can stand at and\n\n82\n00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,720\nplay games.\n\n83\n00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,490\n>> All right, and you,\nyou did some research and\n\n84\n00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,340\nI believe you found some plans, right?\n\n85\n00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,420\n>> Correct.\n>> So you have those handy,\n\n86\n00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,390\nis that what you got right here?\n\n87\n00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,750\n>> Well not the print out of the plans,\nbut\n\n88\n00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,300\njust the print out of the list of items.\n\n89\n00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,626\n>> Okay, and what you did is you found\nthat online, do you remember the site?\n\n90\n00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:32,864\nIt's nice, talking\n\n91\n00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:38,380\noctopus's name cabinets, all right,\n\n92\n00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,360\nthere we go, so here's a gentleman\nwho's already done this.\n\n93\n00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,885\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n94\n00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,565\n>> It's kind of gone through the process,\n\n95\n00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:50,890\nand so this is gonna be one of our\norganizational process assets, right?\n\n96\n00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,560\n>> Og, yeah.\n>> So\n\n97\n00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,300\nwe've found somebody else\nhas already done this, and\n\n98\n00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,900\nwe're benefiting from other industry\nknowledge that's out there.\n\n99\n00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,780\nAnd so he's got some designs for\n\n100\n00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,760\nhow he cut that out of plywood or\nMDF, or whatever it is.\n\n101\n00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,380\nExcellent, so we are going to\nbasically steal this guy's design?\n\n102\n00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,310\n>> Yes, he documented it pretty well,\nwell enough for us and so rather than,\n\n103\n00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,950\nyou know, spending the time to try and\n\n104\n00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,770\nreinvent everything, he obviously\nposted it to share with others.\n\n105\n00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so we'll base ours off of this.\n\n106\n00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,810\n>> And it looks like it meets\nthe requirements that we do have,\n\n107\n00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,810\nthe four controls and\ntrackball support in there.\n\n108\n00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,210\nJust one trackball or should we do more?\n\n109\n00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,390\n>> One to start with.\n\n110\n00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,670\n>> Okay, one to start with.\n\n111\n00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,640\nSo we've got, you say to start with.\n\n112\n00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,220\nDo we need a plan, do we need to leave\nblanks for future track balls, or?\n\n113\n00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,810\n>> Well, no.\n>> Okay.\n\n114\n00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,454\n>> Not at this point.\n\n115\n00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:43,508\n>> Actually,\n\n116\n00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:48,160\nyou know, I'm trying to think,\nI'm going back in history in my mind.\n\n117\n00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,210\nI can't think of any games\nthat had two trackballs.\n\n118\n00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,240\nCan you?\n>> I can't think of any.\n\n119\n00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,870\n>> No.\n>> I just like the early Pong tables,\n\n120\n00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,990\nthe cocktail ones, there were some that\nhad, where you both had a trackball.\n\n121\n00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,220\nDo you remember those?\n\n122\n00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,910\n>> With the turning.\n\n123\n00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,860\nI don't remember\n>> Yeah I remember the knob.\n\n124\n00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,650\n>> Well that was the one\nthat hooked up to your TV.\n\n125\n00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,793\nI'm talking about like Pizza Hut.\n\n126\n00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,802\n[LAUGH] All right, well okay.\n\n127\n00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,180\nSo it may be that we never\ndo add a second track ball.\n\n128\n00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,240\n>> And if we're going to make\nany modifications to it,\n\n129\n00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,600\nwe could add a set of light guns for\na House of the the Dead.\n\n130\n00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,170\n>> Nice.\n\n131\n00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,670\n>> But through the reading, just the\noptical sensor for it was a hundred and\n\n132\n00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,490\nfifty bucks.\n\n133\n00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,350\n>> Oh, that's a lot.\n\n134\n00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,613\n>> Yeah, I don't know if we can get\na licensed copy of House of the Dead.\n\n135\n00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:32,395\n>> Do they sell that for PC?\n\n136\n00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:35,200\n>> [INAUDIBLE] The Wii.\n>> [LAUGH] Can\n\n137\n00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,775\nwe stick a Wii inside the cabinet?\n\n138\n00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:40,850\n[LAUGH] Well, all right, so maybe\nwe'll put that as like a stretch goal,\n\n139\n00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,710\nall right.\n\n140\n00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:48,223\nSo in our requirements list, all right,\nI'm gonna put multiple track ball and\n\n141\n00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:54,330\nlightgun support [LAUGH]\nRight?\n\n142\n00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,660\nI think I am spelling that right.\n\n143\n00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,970\nAnd what I'm going to do is,\n\n144\n00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,985\nour source column is really\nlacking value in this project.\n\n145\n00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:07,031\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because the source of most of this\n\n146\n00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:10,358\nstuff is going to be\n[INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK].\n\n147\n00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:11,632\n>> Oh it is.\n>> It's his birthday,\n\n148\n00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,865\nwe should let him go.\n\n149\n00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n150\n00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,850\nBut what I'm gonna do is under category,\nI'm gonna put light gun\n\n151\n00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,500\nsupport down as an optional entry and\nmultiple trackball support, same thing.\n\n152\n00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,020\nIf we can do them great.\n\n153\n00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,150\nBut, if we can't do those,\nthe project is still a success.\n\n154\n00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,460\nSo these are our kind of stretch goals.\n\n155\n00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,530\nAnd up here we've got joystick and\ntrack ball support.\n\n156\n00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,860\nI'm gonna knock out track ball support and\nI'm gonna put joystick.\n\n157\n00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,280\nActually we need to have at least one, and\n\n158\n00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,620\nso I-\n>> I think track ball will also double as\n\n159\n00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,730\nour mouse.\n\n160\n00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,900\nAs we navigate, you know,\nthe underlying platform.\n\n161\n00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,010\n>> Good point, good point, so\nI'll put track ball support and\n\n162\n00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,070\nnow my numbers are going to be\nout of synch, so you know what?\n\n163\n00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,736\nI am just going to, oh, don't do that.\n\n164\n00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:00,130\nI am just going to blank\nout these numbers.\n\n165\n00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,869\nAfter we're done,\nI can always add numbers in.\n\n166\n00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:03,914\nAnd identify things, so.\n\n167\n00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:04,867\n>> You think you're going to.\n\n168\n00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,073\n>> I know.\nIf it'll let me double click.\n\n169\n00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:10,301\nApparently Steve Jobs has decided\ndouble clicks are not gonna like this\n\n170\n00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:11,010\nnumber for me.\n\n171\n00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,600\nThere we go.\n\n172\n00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,500\n>> Need a command click.\n\n173\n00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,480\n>> So, joystick support, though,\nthat's a big requirement.\n\n174\n00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,860\nWe've gotta have joystick support.\n\n175\n00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,760\n>> Primary.\n\n176\n00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,370\n>> And the single track ball.\n\n177\n00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,470\n>> It could go both ways.\n\n178\n00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,050\nBut it would be easier at this phase than\nit would be to modify after the fact.\n\n179\n00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,642\n>> Let's go primary on that one.\n\n180\n00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,150\nAll right some of these other\nones that we've got here.\n\n181\n00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,470\nTook back to the custom built,\nwooden cabin.\n\n182\n00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,505\nWe've found some plans.\n\n183\n00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:37,310\nRight?\nAnd I'm just going to grab this URL here.\n\n184\n00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,910\nAnd in the description I'm gonna say,\nusing plans from,\n\n185\n00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,090\nand I'll stick that URL in there so\nthat we've got it.\n\n186\n00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,160\nSo here's this guy's charter website\nthat'll definitely be up next week.\n\n187\n00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,105\nWe probably want to save\nan offline copy of that.\n\n188\n00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:54,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because you never know with those.\n\n189\n00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,670\nAll right, so we've got some plans.\n\n190\n00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,990\nAnd did he go as far as to.\n\n191\n00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,714\nOh my goodness, he did.\n\n192\n00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:00,376\nLook at that part list.\n\n193\n00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:01,015\n>> He listed everything.\n\n194\n00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,830\n>> This guy's awesome.\n\n195\n00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,480\n>> Yes.\n>> We need to send him a thank you note.\n\n196\n00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,800\nIf we didn't have this information,\n\n197\n00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560\nwe would have to come up with this\nparts list as part of our requirement.\n\n198\n00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,470\nThese are materials that we're\ngoing to need to purchase.\n\n199\n00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,060\nThey're going to need to go\ninto the budget and stuff so.\n\n200\n00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,500\nBut fortunately,\nhe's telling us everything we need, now.\n\n201\n00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,150\nRob?\n\n202\n00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,310\n>> Yes\n>> In a past life you were a carpenter\n\n203\n00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,270\nslash cabinet builder.\n\n204\n00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,551\n>> Yes\n>> And if it weren't for\n\n205\n00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:25,877\nyou we would probably wouldn't\nundertake this project.\n\n206\n00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:26,980\n>> That's true.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,124\n>> So because you've got that technical\n\n208\n00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:33,152\nexpertise and I'm guessing that you\nprobably have most of that stuff.\n\n209\n00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:35,630\n>> Most of those drill bits and\nall that stuff I do have.\n\n210\n00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,610\nAnd the glue, just the sheet goods, and\n\n211\n00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,900\nthe wood material, and\nprobably some additional screws.\n\n212\n00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,720\n>> Okay, yeah so\nthere's some Pine strips and Poplar,\n\n213\n00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,690\ncasters, that's the kind of stuff\nthat we'll probably need to go.\n\n214\n00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,940\nBut yeah,\nmost of this is pretty straight forward.\n\n215\n00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,900\nAll right, so we've got our hardware\nlisted and, you know, I'm tieing into\n\n216\n00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,040\nthat here, so I don't want to go too crazy\ndetailing here on this page, I can always\n\n217\n00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,840\nget that later for my other documentation,\nbut for right now I can back to that page.\n\n218\n00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,976\nThe cabinet design.\n\n219\n00:10:04,976 --> 00:10:10,170\nAlright, now-\n>> Custom overlays\n\n220\n00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,020\n>> We need to do custom overlays?\n\n221\n00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,210\n>> You know, I was thinking about it and\nI know, we could always go the route\n\n222\n00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,180\nof like vinyl wraps, because vinyl\nwraps are pretty inexpensive,\n\n223\n00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,250\nrather than going to like a print shop and\ngetting something like this up and\n\n224\n00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,030\nit's awesome that it can\nbe made after the fact.\n\n225\n00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,000\nBecause we will paint\nthe cabinet all one color and\n\n226\n00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,840\nwe'll either put on graphics with like\na lexan or acrylic on top of it or\n\n227\n00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,720\nsomebody is really artistic and\nthey can do some pin striping.\n\n228\n00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,870\n>> Rob, can you paint MDF?\n\n229\n00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,590\nIs it like particle board\nwhere it looks all grainy?\n\n230\n00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,310\n>> Oh, does it look grainy?\n\n231\n00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,760\nNo, it's pretty smooth.\n\n232\n00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,039\nSo we could just paint it and\n\n233\n00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,725\na lot of cabinets, actually a lot of\nkitchen cabinet doors are made out of MDF.\n\n234\n00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:49,944\nIt's very\n>> Nice.\n\n235\n00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:53,398\n>> So as a part of this project,\ndo we wanna incorporate overlay art, or\n\n236\n00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:57,107\ndo we just wanna be happy with painting\nit one color and being done with it?\n\n237\n00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:59,034\n>> Hm.\n\n238\n00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,750\nI think we need to try and\nincorporate overlay art.\n\n239\n00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,450\n>> Okay, so\nthis is a decision that we have to make.\n\n240\n00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,220\nIs we could always have project 2.0,\n\n241\n00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,010\nsomething that you could do after\nthe fact as a separate project.\n\n242\n00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,180\nBut if we could do it now,\n\n243\n00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,490\nwhy bother painting the cabinet when we\ncould have just stuck overlays on it.\n\n244\n00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,451\nAnd I don't know about these,\nthese are a little on the Oakie side.\n\n245\n00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:17,952\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n246\n00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:18,958\n>> And I'm sure that's violating\n\n247\n00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:19,936\nsomebody's, well I don't know.\n\n248\n00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:24,753\nThat's It's like, it looks like PacMan but\nit obviously isn't, so--\n\n249\n00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:26,010\n>> It's like \"Wack-Man.\"\n\n250\n00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,873\n>> I wonder.\n\n251\n00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:29,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So this is all stuff where it's like\n\n252\n00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,890\nreminiscent of-\n>> I see Gambit-\n\n253\n00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,650\n>> Yeah that's clearly Venom.\n\n254\n00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,544\n>> Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK] There's Captain America over\n\n255\n00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:37,102\nthere.\n\n256\n00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:40,130\n>> Well that says Camcom up at the top.\n\n257\n00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,750\n>> Does it?\n\n258\n00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,561\n>> Does it?\n>> Or Capcom.\n\n259\n00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:44,502\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Maybe that's how they\n\n260\n00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:45,322\nget away from the copyright.\n\n261\n00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:49,750\nI'm not sure if we bump into\nlicensing issues on that or not.\n\n262\n00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,108\nThat'll have to go into our\nrisk assessment later on.\n\n263\n00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:58,310\nBut all right, so I am going to go ahead\nand add, we'll just inset that in here.\n\n264\n00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,880\nSo I am gonna put.\n\n265\n00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,330\n>> Would that not fall, sorry, would that,\n\n266\n00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,270\ncould you like, put things like\ngraphic in the arcade like feel, so\n\n267\n00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,520\nit does feel like an arcade machine with\nthe graphics and the whole experience?\n\n268\n00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,530\n>> Well, you know,\nlet's talk about arcade feel, right?\n\n269\n00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,750\n>> Yep.\n>> We're kind of jumping all over but\n\n270\n00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,750\nthat's fine.\n\n271\n00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,550\nArcade feel is the only one that we\nhave that I can't really quantify.\n\n272\n00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,090\nIt's one of those subjective terms\nthat can be really dangerous for us to\n\n273\n00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,420\nleave in as a requirement because at the\nend of a project, how do you measure that?\n\n274\n00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,650\nAnd we might have where\nthe whole team thinks, yeah,\n\n275\n00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,090\nit's like we're in an arcade, but you go\nman, this is lame, this isn't anything\n\n276\n00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,950\nlike, you know, Dave and Buster's,\nor whatever it is that you think of.\n\n277\n00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,670\nSo I'd kind of like to get\nrid of this requirement and\n\n278\n00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,140\nreplace it with what you really need.\n\n279\n00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,310\nSo when we say an arcade like feel,\nI think you have to have cabinet graphic\n\n280\n00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,010\noverlays for that, if you don't, it's not\ngoing to look like something in an arcade.\n\n281\n00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,100\nBut at the same time, you know, we're\ngoing to need that cabinet in order for\n\n282\n00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,390\nthis project to happen, right?\n\n283\n00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,610\nSo that's a primary one.\n\n284\n00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,320\nBut the graphics are really,\nwe might set that as secondary.\n\n285\n00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,130\nWe're going to try and do it but\nif we have to cut something,\n\n286\n00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,595\nmaybe that'll be one of\nthe first things that we cut.\n\n287\n00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:13,553\nRight?\nSo what else would we need to achieve that\n\n288\n00:13:13,553 --> 00:13:14,834\narcade like feel?\n\n289\n00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:17,190\n>> Authentic\n>> RK controls.\n\n290\n00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,020\nSo the button has to have that click.\n\n291\n00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,440\n>> Oh, yeah?\n>> You know the RK button?\n\n292\n00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,460\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n293\n00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:28,790\n>> All right, so authentic,\nauthentic arcade controls.\n\n294\n00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,811\nAnd a PM we can stop.\n\n295\n00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:31,107\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:31,955\n>> All right.\n\n297\n00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:34,576\nAnd in my description here I'll just say,\ngee whiz.\n\n298\n00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,005\n>> Yeah, that is important.\n\n299\n00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:51,940\n>> All right, does that mean the joystick\nhas to be like super worn down and\n\n300\n00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,261\nnot respond half the time.\n\n301\n00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,662\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, actually,\n\n302\n00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:58,005\nyou know it has to be able to hold up\nto a lot of abuse because those arcade\n\n303\n00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,300\nmachine really like, pretty sturdy.\n\n304\n00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,500\n>> Now, does he have a picture\nof his final product?\n\n305\n00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,310\nOh, he's got the PCB diagrams and\neverything.\n\n306\n00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,617\nThis is really a [CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n307\n00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:17,540\n>> Oh, now, for an arcade feel, so\nthe embedded TV that's not a big deal.\n\n308\n00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,730\nDo you recess the TV and\nhave a sheet of plexiglass in front of it?\n\n309\n00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,130\n>> Is it plexiglass or real glass?\n\n310\n00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,160\n>> I thought it was plexiglass.\n\n311\n00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,830\n>> Yeah, acrylic.\n\n312\n00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,680\n>> Yeah, it's acrylic, cause you go into\nsome old arcades and it's all kinda cloudy\n\n313\n00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,110\nfrom somebody who like scuffed it up or\nsomething, it's got that lame glare on it.\n\n314\n00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,550\n>> So do we recess the TV and\ncover it like that?\n\n315\n00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,760\nOr do we just have the TV in there and\nnot, cuz we're adults?\n\n316\n00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,248\nI'll spill my beer on it.\n\n317\n00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:49,520\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n318\n00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,250\nYou know it yeah.\n\n319\n00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,270\n>> Covering it.\n\n320\n00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,310\n>> Covering might be a secondary thing\nbecause I think we're all adults here and\n\n321\n00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,100\nI don't think it will get as much use.\n\n322\n00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,640\n>> Okay.\n>> And\n\n323\n00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,060\nyou know with our studio lights it\nmight create some unwanted glare.\n\n324\n00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,916\n>> So I will add that as maybe,\nshould that be optional or\n\n325\n00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:04,797\nshould it be secondary.\n\n326\n00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:06,655\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n327\n00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,639\nSo plexi glass.\n\n328\n00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,745\nScreen cover.\n\n329\n00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,140\n>> Optional.\n\n330\n00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,613\n>> Not how you spell plexiglass, I have no\nidea how to spell it and there we go, so\n\n331\n00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,066\nwe'll make that one optional.\n\n332\n00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,820\nIf we can do it, great, you know?\n\n333\n00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,062\nIt just kind of creates that,\nso creates arcade field.\n\n334\n00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:26,690\nAll right.\n\n335\n00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,030\nThe other thing I noticed here in\nthe picture, this guy is hardcore.\n\n336\n00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,930\n>> Yeah.\n>> He's got the coin slot operation now.\n\n337\n00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,070\n>> Yeah.\n>> Lock.\n\n338\n00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,300\n>> I think that it's probably a waste\nof money to have that on there.\n\n339\n00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,515\n>> Yeah.\n>> Do they make imitation ones though?\n\n340\n00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,590\n>> Maybe, perhaps.\n\n341\n00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,400\nBut, that coin door is in our build plan.\n\n342\n00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,580\n>> Oh, is it really?\n\n343\n00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,660\n>> It's in our part lists.\n\n344\n00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,950\n>> Is it just a coin door, does it\nactually have the machine behind it?\n\n345\n00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,490\n>> It does but its not wire.\n\n346\n00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,845\nIt's a real old coin slot door but\n\n347\n00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:59,125\nwe're not gonna wire it into\neverything with relays and stuff.\n\n348\n00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,445\nBut it's a real door that lights up.\n\n349\n00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:02,065\n>> We could just have a bucket

00:16:49,870\nAnd so Nate, do you have any idea of what\nthe cost is, on that particular option?\n\n368\n00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,232\n>> Of what, the coin door?\n\n369\n00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:59,140\n>> Mm-hm, it seems like, it just seems\nto me like that would be expensive.\n\n370\n00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,640\n>> A non-working coin door?\n\n371\n00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:04,700\n>> Yeah, it's on here somewhere.\n\n372\n00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,716\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is $99.98.\n\n373\n00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:12,925\n>> Of $100, so I'm gonna add that in here.\n\n374\n00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:14,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm gonna add in,\n\n375\n00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,650\nto get the arcade feel,\n\n376\n00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,280\nI think you need to have that, I just\ndon't know if I'm ready for that expense.\n\n377\n00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,905\nCould you put a picture of it on there?\n\n378\n00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:23,740\n[LAUGH] So coin slots, right?\n\n379\n00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,670\nOr coin slot covered door,\ncoin slot door, whatever it's called.\n\n380\n00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,968\nI'm gonna put that one\nin here as secondary.\n\n381\n00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:38,374\nIt cost $100 [LAUGH] but,\n\n382\n00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:42,420\ncreates the arcade feel.\n\n383\n00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,060\nRight, I need to remember that.\n\n384\n00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,400\nAnd the requirement came from Nate.\n\n385\n00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,350\nSo, it's his vision that\nwe're trying to achieve here.\n\n386\n00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,760\nThis one was mine.\n\n387\n00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:57,810\nThis one came from Rob, and\nthe graphics overlays we'll see.\n\n388\n00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,500\nOkay, all right, so there's some things\nthat we just need to keep in mind.\n\n389\n00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,690\nAgain, we might need to revisit.\n\n390\n00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,430\nSo, all right, let's double back to\nthe custom built wooden cabinet.\n\n391\n00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:13,070\nSo, I know a lot of those arcade machines\nwere made out of really cheap plywood,\n\n392\n00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,820\nbecause they were having\noverlay stuck on them, right?\n\n393\n00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,580\nAnd if you paint plywood,\nyou can still see that it's plywood, so\n\n394\n00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,310\nyou really can't paint it, but\nwe're gonna use MDF right?\n\n395\n00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,450\n>> I think we'll use MDF for\nthe most part.\n\n396\n00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:30,050\nIf we don't move it around much,\nthen that's probably a good option,\n\n397\n00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,990\nit just weighs like four\ntimes as much as plywood, so.\n\n398\n00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,820\n>> Well, I think I saw castors on\nthe list, so it's gonna have wheels.\n\n399\n00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,540\n>> Okay.\n>> So there's that.\n\n400\n00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,025\n>> Cheaper than plywood.\n\n401\n00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:42,882\n>> [CROSSTALK] I didn't know that.\n\n402\n00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:45,486\n>> Well as far as working with cutting.\n\n403\n00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:50,390\nCuz in there we've got little T-strips so\nyou have to cut a groove in\n\n404\n00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,670\nthere to fit the moulding, that's gonna go\non the outside to give those rolled edges.\n\n405\n00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,054\n>> It cuts really nice,\nit's just heavier to work with, so\n\n406\n00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,882\na lot of times it may take two people\nto kinda muscle it through a saw or\n\n407\n00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:01,931\nsomething like that, but-\n>> Do you need a router to cut that,\n\n408\n00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:02,434\nto do the little T?\n\n409\n00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:06,393\n>> I mean, I have a router, but-\n>> You do, okay.\n\n410\n00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:08,152\n>> Actually I have like three routers so.\n\n411\n00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:09,074\n>> [CROSSTALK] Really?\n\n412\n00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:13,150\n>> Wow, we have Cisco routers, [LAUGH].\n\n413\n00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,404\n>> Not very well but.\n\n414\n00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,980\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Tip bits.\n>> All right, so Rob, for\n\n415\n00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,610\nthe custom cabinet I mean we're really\njust talking about wood and glue and\n\n416\n00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,240\nscrews, and your skill set.\n\n417\n00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,587\nYou feel comfortable with what we've\nseen here, or are these plans,\n\n418\n00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:30,575\nas this gentleman has listed them,\nare these adequate for you?\n\n419\n00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:32,688\nDoes he-\n>> Yeah, they look great.\n\n420\n00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:35,323\n>> He says he followed\nsomebody else's plans.\n\n421\n00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:37,076\nLet's-\n>> Yep.\n\n422\n00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,195\n>> Look, this is so thorough.\n\n423\n00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,147\nThis is-\n>> Nice.\n\n424\n00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:44,332\n>> Really impressive,\nhe's got the measurements, supports.\n\n425\n00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,813\nWow, yeah.\n\n426\n00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:46,839\nThis is really good stuff right here.\n\n427\n00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,617\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n428\n00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:51,130\n>> Okay, I'm gonna add this link,\ncuz that's just a PDF.\n\n429\n00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,480\nLet me add that.\n\n430\n00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,505\nWe will need to modify their designs,\n\n431\n00:19:56,505 --> 00:20:02,470\ncuz I believe we'll be going\nwith a 16 by 9 ratio television,\n\n432\n00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,895\nas where this is all centered around\na 4 by 3 CRT or a arcade monitor.\n\n433\n00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n434\n00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,095\nI don't think we should do an arcade\nmonitor, cuz I'm sure that's expensive.\n\n435\n00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:12,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A TV or\n\n436\n00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,360\na computer monitor would\nbe much less expensive.\n\n437\n00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,750\nCan you buy 4 by 3s anymore?\n\n438\n00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,405\n>> You can from the arcade place.\n\n439\n00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:24,891\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They were around $600.\n\n440\n00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,318\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But they came with these shrouds,\n\n441\n00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:30,208\nthat actually slip into your machine, and\n\n442\n00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,980\nit attaches on the outside of it and\nthey come with Viesels too.\n\n443\n00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,690\nSo it really is a, Viesels.\n\n444\n00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,650\n>> If only they came with Vezzels,\nthen it would be perfect.\n\n445\n00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,794\n>> [CROSSTALK] I think\nthey're the same thing.\n\n446\n00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:43,323\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it was like a the drop in solution.\n\n447\n00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:48,045\nBut for $600 blocks for\na 4 x 3 CRT type display.\n\n448\n00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:48,765\n>> Nah.\n\n449\n00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:49,365\n>> Not selling.\n\n450\n00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:51,005\n>> So, if we just go with our own, right?\n\n451\n00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:55,080\nMaybe we pickup a refurb TV or something\nlike that and stick it in there at 16 x 9.\n\n452\n00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,616\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Do you think we could make that Bezel,\n\n453\n00:20:58,616 --> 00:20:59,820\nthe shroud?\n\n454\n00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,100\n>> Yeah, like acrylic.\n\n455\n00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,438\nAcrylic is easy to work with, we can get\ndifferent colors of acrylic, we can even.\n\n456\n00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:08,010\n>> Cut it with a router.\n\n457\n00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,110\n>> Yes, we can cut it with a router and\nacrylic is pretty easy to work with, so\n\n458\n00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,782\nI think we could make\na pretty sweet a vezzel.\n\n459\n00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:15,822\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n460\n00:21:15,822 --> 00:21:18,010\n>> All right, so\nI think we're good there then.\n\n461\n00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,580\nSo, on the equipment.\n\n462\n00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,427\nThat's gonna be part of our\nmaterials to tackle a little later,\n\n463\n00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:26,230\nwe kinda hammer into our budget and all.\n\n464\n00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,650\nBy the way, you guys,\nyou've done your research.\n\n465\n00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,620\nSo, let's just kind of requirements aside.\n\n466\n00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,690\nJust to set me at ease.\n\n467\n00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,450\nReally, as far as materials,\nwe've got two different things.\n\n468\n00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,990\nSo, we've got the wooden cabinet itself,\nright?\n\n469\n00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,055\nAnd do we have a ball park on what\nthe wooden cabinet itself is gonna run?\n\n470\n00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:56,250\nWithout the vezzel material,\nwe're gonna $200 for the material.\n\n471\n00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,103\nOkay, not including vezzel.\n\n472\n00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:04,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Totally gonna look that up after\n\n473\n00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,200\nthe show and see,\nhow its actually pronounced.\n\n474\n00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,460\nAll right, so then there's\nthe electronics, which is going\n\n475\n00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,410\nto include the controls, and we've already\ngot the PC, so that's kind of handy.\n\n476\n00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,650\nThat knocks that out.\n\n477\n00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,270\nBut, we need all the control deck.\n\n478\n00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,480\nWe need a monitor slash TV.\n\n479\n00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,770\nAnd the interface cards and stuff, right.\n\n480\n00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,340\nSo it's all the electronics.\n\n481\n00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,110\nDo we have an idea of what\nthe ballpark is on that right now?\n\n482\n00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,029\n>> Not including the monitor,\nwe're looking around $760.\n\n483\n00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,644\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n484\n00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:41,520\n>> And that includes the coin door,\nand the track ball.\n\n485\n00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,520\n>> All right, so\nthat's including coin door and track ball.\n\n486\n00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,550\n>> And\nI call it the track ball specifically,\n\n487\n00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,165\nbecause the track ball was $131.\n\n488\n00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:53,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Pretty\n\n489\n00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,610\ngood chunk of the overall budget.\n\n490\n00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,240\n>> Yeah, the little clicky buttons, and\n\n491\n00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,880\nthey are actual,\nreal arcade clicky buttons.\n\n492\n00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,020\n>> All right, nice one.\n\n493\n00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,360\n>> See and those run two bucks a piece,\nso that, the big track ball?\n\n494\n00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,165\n>> Yeah.\n\n495\n00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:14,740\n>> [LAUGH] So no Golden Tee for us.\n\n496\n00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,829\n>> All right, I'm putting a note\nin here on this one Nate.\n\n497\n00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,020\nThe trackball, I think, is something\nthat you really wanna have for\n\n498\n00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,658\nsome arcade games, but if push comes to\nshove if we start pressing our budget?\n\n499\n00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:31,230\nAt 130 bucks, to me, that will be\none of the first things to go.\n\n500\n00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,365\nI'm going to demote.\n\n501\n00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:34,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Track ball,\n\n502\n00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,290\nsupport from primary to secondary,\n\n503\n00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,802\nand we should take a vote on it but\nI'm not going to.\n\n504\n00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:44,522\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna exercise a dictatorship on\n\n505\n00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:48,240\nthis decision, it's still second\nI'm not making it optional, so\n\n506\n00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,160\nI wanna to get done and I think.\n\n507\n00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,000\nWe'll be fine.\n\n508\n00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,940\nI think we'll be fine doing that,\ncuz you said 760 bucks.\n\n509\n00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,910\nIf we add in a monitor, right,\nwhich we just bought some studio monitors,\n\n510\n00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,000\nand we got them,\nthey were maybe 200 a piece or something.\n\n511\n00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,280\nAnd I think those were bigger\nthan what we want here.\n\n512\n00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,837\nNo.\n\n513\n00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:12,713\n>> So, those ones were 32 inch, and\nthey are smart TVs, they are full HD.\n\n514\n00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:16,382\nNow, for an arcade machine,\nwe could get away with a dumb TV.\n\n515\n00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:17,292\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n516\n00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:21,230\nwe could get away with a 60\nhertz television, a 720p even.\n\n517\n00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,480\nWe could get a scepter or dynamics.\n\n518\n00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,413\n>> This is brand I've never heard of.\n\n519\n00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:27,446\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or a Westinghouse, you know.\n\n520\n00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:29,530\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH] Well you know,\n\n521\n00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,735\nreally offer in TV because it's not,\nwe don't really need 1080p graphics.\n\n522\n00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:38,715\n>> We need a.\n\n523\n00:24:38,715 --> 00:24:39,710\n>> Mex tv?\n\n524\n00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,210\n>> They do.\n\n525\n00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,860\nSo let's just say that we set it at 200.\n\n526\n00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,105\nSo our budget right now is looking at,\nwhat like 1160?\n\n527\n00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:52,790\nSo about $1200 and\nthat's below my hard limit of 2000,\n\n528\n00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,850\nit's closer to desired 1000,\nso it's actually not bad.\n\n529\n00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,300\nI'm not feeling too bad about that.\n\n530\n00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,570\nAll right, I just want you to know that's\nnot part of the requirements process but\n\n531\n00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,030\nthese are the things that we need\nto be understanding at this point,\n\n532\n00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,000\nbecause they're going\nto come into to play.\n\n533\n00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,360\nAll right, so\nthere's our custom built wooden cabinet.\n\n534\n00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,320\nWe know we're going to need some\nmaterials for that, we've got some plans.\n\n535\n00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,570\nThat we're gonna follow\nthat tell us what to get.\n\n536\n00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,900\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n537\n00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,660\n>> So, he mentions in here\nthe equipment that he needed.\n\n538\n00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,790\nAnd, yeah,\nsome of the instructions are screws.\n\n539\n00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:37,010\nIt doesn't really say how many sheets of,\nis that what that represents?\n\n540\n00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,520\nIs that one sheet?\n\n541\n00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,030\n>> Yeah, that's one sheet,\nso that's a 4 by 8 sheet,\n\n542\n00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,400\nso there's three of them there, so.\n\n543\n00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,930\n>> Okay.\n\n544\n00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,230\nAll right, good.\n\n545\n00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,270\nSo that's really handy.\n\n546\n00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,585\nIf we had to come up with\ndo this stuff on our own,\n\n547\n00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:51,033\ncan you imagine how bad\nthis thing would look?\n\n548\n00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:55,165\n[LAUGH]\nHow bad\n\n549\n00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:59,597\nthis could potentially look if\nwe were left to our own devices.\n\n550\n00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:01,531\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] You know,\nthe Tiki bar, I did see it.\n\n551\n00:26:01,531 --> 00:26:03,180\nIt's coming along nicely.\n\n552\n00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> So that, just for the record,\n\n553\n00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,302\nthe Tiki bar, not for IT Pro TV\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n554\n00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:08,410\n>> Something completely different.\n\n555\n00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,690\nAll right, so\ncabinet graphics and overlays.\n\n556\n00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,150\nRob, you are our graphics designer.\n\n557\n00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,740\n>> Right, so\nthe design I'm comfortable with\n\n558\n00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,960\n>> Is there a print shop or\n\n559\n00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,890\nsomebody that can print that on\n>> Oh, sure.\n\n560\n00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,540\n>> Yeah?\n\n561\n00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,260\n>> Yeah.\nWe could get it printed out.\n\n562\n00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,140\n>> So our estimated budget down here\ndoesn't really include those overlays, so\n\n563\n00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,130\nwe don't really know\nwhat that's gonna cost.\n\n564\n00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,770\n>> No.\n>> So let me just put a little note down\n\n565\n00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,838\nhere for me.\n\n566\n00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:40,800\nThat overlay graphics, unknown cost.\n\n567\n00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,860\nSo we need to do some research there.\n\n568\n00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,580\nWe know the sizes and so we can probably\nreach out to somebody right now and\n\n569\n00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,670\nsay you know what's it going\nto cost to get that printed.\n\n570\n00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,650\nSo somebody's going to have to do a little\nmore research on the overlay graphics.\n\n571\n00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,540\nIf they are inexpensive well,\nwe'll definitely do them.\n\n572\n00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,420\nBut I can see them becoming expensive.\n\n573\n00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,360\nThat's if we do a giant overlay for\nthe entire side of the cabinet.\n\n574\n00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,140\nSo, would we want that,\nI don't think he did that, did he?\n\n575\n00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,243\n>> I don't think so.\n\n576\n00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:06,370\n>> I think he just did the panel.\n\n577\n00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,300\n>> And the marquee as well.\n\n578\n00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,670\n>> Oh yeah, that's true.\n\n579\n00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,840\n>> So he did, oh,\nthat's up at the top of the thing, right,\n\n580\n00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,190\nand there's the controls.\n\n581\n00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,690\nSo his sides and\nstuff is probably just all black.\n\n582\n00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,140\n>> You know, instead of graphics on the\nsides we could take it out somewhere and\n\n583\n00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,160\njust shoot it with paint ball guns.\n\n584\n00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,735\nNow that kinda paint splatter vision\nstreetwear-esque kind of thing.\n\n585\n00:27:26,735 --> 00:27:28,990\n>> [LAUGH] Like you did\nit like Jackson Pollock?\n\n586\n00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,395\nYou don't know your artists?\n\n587\n00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:32,450\n[LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n588\n00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,260\nIs it?\n\n589\n00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,010\nNo.\n>> He's an artist,\n\n590\n00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,560\nhe paints by throwing paint at the wall.\n\n591\n00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,260\n>> Okay well we could\ndo something like that.\n\n592\n00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,480\n>> He was an alcoholic,\nhe was completely drunk.\n\n593\n00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,340\n>> Oh, okay. [LAUGH] >> True that.\n\n594\n00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,280\n>> Okay, so this really turned out nice.\n\n595\n00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,710\nIs that this a sheet of\nplexiglass laid on top of it?\n\n596\n00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,280\n>> Correct.\n\n597\n00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,050\n>> Okay.\n>> And there's the track ball.\n\n598\n00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,928\n>> And then, there's the track ball.\n\n599\n00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:55,028\n>> Blue.\n\n600\n00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:56,950\n>> All right.\n\n601\n00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,180\nSeems pretty straight forward.\n\n602\n00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,750\nDoesn't it?\n\n603\n00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,190\n>> Yeah.\nNot to bad.\n\n604\n00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,980\n>> Now, maybe we could take like a bomb\nhouse and somehow flip it upside down and\n\n605\n00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,930\nsomehow modify it to where we\ncan like enlarge the ball and\n\n606\n00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,420\njust use the little sensors and\na track ball.\n\n607\n00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,300\nAnd little mouse.\n\n608\n00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,475\nLike an upside down mouse and [NOISE].\n\n609\n00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,295\nAny how all right what.\n\n610\n00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,000\n>> Has anybody done that?\n\n611\n00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,925\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know, I'll have to do research.\n\n612\n00:28:18,925 --> 00:28:20,215\nThat's when you start to say well,\nfor $130,\n\n613\n00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:25,645\nwe get one where we know works\nversus experimenting, and\n\n614\n00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:31,290\nsee he's got that perfect bezel and\nthe speakers are mounted up there.\n\n615\n00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,400\nAre speakers in the\n>> Yes\n\n616\n00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,170\n>> Parts list.\n\n617\n00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,890\n>> And speaker grill\n>> Oh grills\n\n618\n00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:39,610\n>> All right, okay so\n\n619\n00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,980\nwe're looking good there so let's see\nwhat else to we have on our requirements?\n\n620\n00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,140\nBudget I've kid of already\ntalked about a little bit.\n\n621\n00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,020\nI got that put in here as a requirement,\ntime frame\n\n622\n00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,400\nthis is obviously a leisure activity so\nI don't really have a time frame for it.\n\n623\n00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,640\nBut as a general practice,\n\n624\n00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,080\nI hate to leave things open ended\nbecause you know what happens.\n\n625\n00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,060\nThey just keep getting delayed and\ndelayed and delayed.\n\n626\n00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,210\nAnd they never get done.\n\n627\n00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,190\nAnd I want to film\nthe project aspects of this,\n\n628\n00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,590\nto make it apart of the project\nmanagement professional training.\n\n629\n00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,350\nThe PMP training is going to be\ngoing through approval of PMI, and\n\n630\n00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,250\nthey said that takes like two months.\n\n631\n00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,760\n>> Yeah.\n>> So.\n\n632\n00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,140\nI'd like to have this done by\nthe time that approval is done so\n\n633\n00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,380\nit's one big package we can give out\nto our viewers and it will be cool.\n\n634\n00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,160\nToday is May 21st.\n\n635\n00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:35,820\nSo let's set a deadline of,\nshould we do end of July?\n\n636\n00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,090\n>> Sure.\n>> End of July.\n\n637\n00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,660\n>> End of July.\nNow obviously if we can\n\n638\n00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,180\nget it done earlier the better.\n\n639\n00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,840\nBut if we say that's our target date,\nend of July.\n\n640\n00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,950\nAnd then I can try and get PMI to approve\nour training by that same time and\n\n641\n00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,950\nwe can kind of have it all coordinated.\n\n642\n00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,580\n>> Sweet.\n\n643\n00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,510\n>> Do you guys feel that's\nan aggressive schedule or\n\n644\n00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,780\ndo you think that's a reasonable one?\n\n645\n00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,310\n>> Reasonable one.\n\n646\n00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,290\n>> Sounds pretty leisurely to me but yeah.\n\n647\n00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,880\n>> I mean it's just an arcade cabinet,\nall right?\n\n648\n00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,560\nYou screw woods together, you put a PC\nin there, you put your buttons in.\n\n649\n00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560\n>> Now Nate.\n\n650\n00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:09,020\nYou and I we are comfortable\nwith a soldering iron and\n\n651\n00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,040\nthis kind of stuff doesn't phase me all.\n\n652\n00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,545\nIn fact I look at that and I think\n>> Oh, what a nightmare.\n\n653\n00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,721\n>> I could do so much better.\n\n654\n00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:15,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm not worried about\n\n655\n00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,710\n>> That aspect of it, Rob,\n\n656\n00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,610\nI have no idea whats involved in\nconstructing the wooden cabinets.\n\n657\n00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,420\nSo, does this seem like\nits gonna be like a,\n\n658\n00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,510\nhow many hours of work do\nyou think its going to be?\n\n659\n00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:31,130\n>> Umm, probably 12, with the shopping,\ngetting the materials,\n\n660\n00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,005\ngetting delivered, getting set up,\ncutting it out, assembling.\n\n661\n00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:38,400\n>> Okay, and we're not doing\nduration planning just yet but\n\n662\n00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,950\nit doesnt hurt to gather some\nof this data ahead of time.\n\n663\n00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,850\nSo, 12 hours including shopping.\n\n664\n00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,295\nDoes that include doing\nyour hair before going out?\n\n665\n00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,239\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Bring your purse.\n\n666\n00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:56,040\n>> All right, graphics overlays,\n>> Obviously,\n\n667\n00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,460\nyou know, we'll have to come back when we\ndo our schedule and reevaluate it, so for\n\n668\n00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,090\nright now though,\n\n669\n00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,900\nI just want to make sure that we have\nour triple constraints planned for.\n\n670\n00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,650\nSo, our requirements list we're\nworking on now, our budget,\n\n671\n00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,810\nI've lightly touched on by\nsetting it as a requirement.\n\n672\n00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:16,390\nAnd then I'm gonna hit our schedule\nlightly here as completed by July,\n\n673\n00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,180\nthat's a 31 day month, isn't it?\n\n674\n00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,610\n>> Yes.\n>> Close enough.\n\n675\n00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,090\n>> Do the little knuckle thing.\n\n676\n00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:23,900\n>> I'll put July 32nd.\n\n677\n00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,548\nShould be completed by\n\n678\n00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:26,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> July 32nd.\n\n679\n00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,340\nAnd we'll make that a primary.\n\n680\n00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,005\nIf we take much longer than that,\nthen we've kind of wasted time and stuff.\n\n681\n00:31:33,005 --> 00:31:34,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now, we're going to\n\n682\n00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,350\nhave to order some of this stuff, Nate.\n\n683\n00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,930\nAnd the equipment is weird equipment.\n\n684\n00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,180\nThis is not stuff you go to target and\npick up.\n\n685\n00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,450\nSo, do you have any idea what the ship or\nlead time is on any of this stuff?\n\n686\n00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,950\n>> Most of it was\n>> One to two weeks.\n\n687\n00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,375\n>> Okay, so that's not bad at all.\n\n688\n00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,810\n>> Mm-hm, that's not bad.\n\n689\n00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,700\n>> All right.\n\n690\n00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,250\n>> On, Prime?\n\n691\n00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,210\n>> I know, right.\n\n692\n00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,590\n>> And is there any point in worrying\nabout the electronics before\n\n693\n00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,491\nthe cabinet is built?\n\n694\n00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,260\nOther than just testing stuff to make\nsure the buttons work and just to.\n\n695\n00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,101\n>> We can actually assemble\nit without the cabinet?\n\n696\n00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:12,004\n>> Yeah, in the control surface\naccording to these plans that\n\n697\n00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:14,856\nis its own separate little build.\n\n698\n00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:15,970\nSo he built the control surface.\n\n699\n00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,897\nHe mounted in the buttons.\n\n700\n00:32:17,897 --> 00:32:19,639\nAnd he tested everything.\n\n701\n00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:23,920\nAnd the control surface then attached\nto the cabinet with the monitor.\n\n702\n00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,830\nSo it was a two part little deal.\n\n703\n00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,520\n>> Hm.\n>> He built a control cabinet first.\n\n704\n00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,340\nOkay.\n>> Yeah, so you could do that and\n\n705\n00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,390\nthen we get, and so while you finish\nthe rest of the cabinet, then Don and\n\n706\n00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,380\nI can drill out the buttons,\nget the wiring done.\n\n707\n00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,830\n>> Right.\n>> That sort of thing.\n\n708\n00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,310\n>> Again not a requirement but\nsomething good for me to note down and\n\n709\n00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,110\nI'll work this into the other\ndocumentation as we move forward.\n\n710\n00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,602\nSo, good information to gather.\n\n711\n00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:50,228\nAll right.\n\n712\n00:32:50,228 --> 00:32:52,540\nLet's see.\n\n713\n00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,290\nLet's just scan across\nour other requirements,\n\n714\n00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,700\nsee if there's anything\nwe can come up with.\n\n715\n00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,850\nI think we've covered everything we\nneed about the wooden cabinet, right?\n\n716\n00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,370\nIs MDF wood?\n\n717\n00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,480\n>> MDF wood?\n>> Is it wood or is it like some sort of-\n\n718\n00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480\n>> It's wood and resins together, yeah.\n\n719\n00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,405\n>> Okay, so we'll call it wood.\n\n720\n00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:10,460\n[LAUGH] So cabinet graphics and\noverlays, we kinda about at this point.\n\n721\n00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,680\nAuthentic arcade controls,\n\n722\n00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,870\nwhich it looks like we're going to\nbe able to meet that pretty easy.\n\n723\n00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,570\nThe plexiglass screen cover.\n\n724\n00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:22,080\nAre we able to get plexiglass\njust at the regular store?\n\n725\n00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,500\n>> Yep.\n>> The coin slot door,\n\n726\n00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,243\nthat will have to be ordered.\n\n727\n00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:25,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> $100.\n\n728\n00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,985\nYou know, between the coin slot and the\ntrack ball it's almost 25% of the budget.\n\n729\n00:33:31,985 --> 00:33:32,670\n>> Um-hm.\n\n730\n00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,150\n>> It's impossible.\n\n731\n00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,580\n>> I guess we could then delete\ntwo items to get a larger display.\n\n732\n00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,590\n>> You know,\nthese are the things we need to weigh.\n\n733\n00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I almost feel like\n\n734\n00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,920\nthough that we need to\nhave that trackball.\n\n735\n00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,710\nThat if you want that authentic,\n\n736\n00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,590\narcade experience, I think-\n>> Where your fingers get pinched at\n\n737\n00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,931\nthe top of the trackball.\n\n738\n00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That experience?\n\n739\n00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,040\n>> Yeah.\nSo, I hate to move away from that one.\n\n740\n00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,680\nThe coin slot door, though, I think would\nbe one of the first things that to hit.\n\n741\n00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,690\nI put trackball down here being the first\nto get cut if it comes to the wire but\n\n742\n00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,960\nhonestly the coin slot door\ndoesn't affect your ability\n\n743\n00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,380\nto-\n>> Play.\n\n744\n00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,600\n>> To play versus this so\nactually, you know what?\n\n745\n00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,370\nI'm going to change that.\n\n746\n00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,060\nAre you guys in agreement on that?\n\n747\n00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,125\nLike that would kind of be the second.\n\n748\n00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,751\n>> That's sounds good.\n\n749\n00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,668\n>> So this one would be first to get cut.\n\n750\n00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:25,611\nIf it comes to the wire, all right.\n\n751\n00:34:25,611 --> 00:34:27,500\nAnd we can revisit it as time goes on, but\n\n752\n00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,166\nI'm thinking that you could almost just\nlike get a picture of a coin slot door,\n\n753\n00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,465\nprint it out, and\ntape to the front of the thing.\n\n754\n00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:37,760\n[LAUGH] All right,\nmust support four players,\n\n755\n00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,130\nI think that our spec here does it\npretty well so I'm cool with that.\n\n756\n00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,620\nAnd it is an upright cabinet,\nwe agreed that just the cocktail cabinet,\n\n757\n00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:53,240\nthe down one, that it's really just\ntwo people, yeah, it's not the same.\n\n758\n00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,112\n>> And the footprint as well, so if we\nmade [INAUDIBLE] cabinet large enough,\n\n759\n00:34:57,112 --> 00:35:01,421\nwhere four people could get around, you\nknow, instead of just three sides of it,\n\n760\n00:35:01,421 --> 00:35:04,306\nit would end up being,\nI mean it would be a pretty wide.\n\n761\n00:35:04,306 --> 00:35:06,477\n>> Yeah.\n>> Footprint as an upright, you know,\n\n762\n00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:09,350\nwe can get four dudes packed\naround it pretty easy.\n\n763\n00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,870\n>> It's got to be guys, can't have women?\n\n764\n00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,448\n>> I mean, at first, we've got to\nset all the high scores first.\n\n765\n00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:16,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Alright, alright.\n\n766\n00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,510\nFair enough.\n\n767\n00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,160\nContains a PC to power games.\n\n768\n00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,350\nNow we haven't talked about this.\n\n769\n00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,340\nI know, that when I think of arcades\nI think of the mame, which is what?\n\n770\n00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,355\nMulti arcade machine emulator?\n\n771\n00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:29,220\n>> Yep.\n>> So\n\n772\n00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,560\nthe mame emulator is what\nwe're going to be running.\n\n773\n00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,400\nAnd I know that it runs on Linux,\nWindows, OSX,\n\n774\n00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,480\nit runs on whatever OS we choose to pick.\n\n775\n00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,710\nWhat operating system are we going to be,\nI guess it doesn't matter, right?\n\n776\n00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,380\nWhat I'm thinking is,\nif we're running windows,\n\n777\n00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,630\nthen we gotta get a Windows license.\n\n778\n00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,160\nBut, if we have a PC that\nalready has a Windows.\n\n779\n00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,460\nWindows license so we're fine there.\n\n780\n00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,370\nWhat did that guy use?\n\n781\n00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,980\nDo we want to do Linux?\n\n782\n00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,660\nWould it be better?\n\n783\n00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,020\n>> I haven't given it a lot of\nresearch as to which would.\n\n784\n00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:05,200\nWhatever really is open source or\njust freely available that we can run.\n\n785\n00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,860\n>> Okay.\n\n786\n00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,380\nSounds like we might need to\ndo more research, though.\n\n787\n00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,740\nCuz, we wanna do MAME.\n\n788\n00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,750\nDo we wanna support other platforms?\n\n789\n00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,920\nDo we wanna support, like,\nSuper Nintendo or other ones?\n\n790\n00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,340\n>> Oh, yeah.\nYeah, it'll be a growing project.\n\n791\n00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,420\n>> Do we need to make a list here?\n\n792\n00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,670\nWhich ones do we wanna support initially.\n\n793\n00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,410\nCuz, this is gonna be part\nof our acceptance factor.\n\n794\n00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,550\nThat, if we don't support one of these,\nthe project fails.\n\n795\n00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,130\nSo.\n\n796\n00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,830\nSo what do we need to think of success?\n\n797\n00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,340\nIs MAME the only one?\n\n798\n00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,270\nLike it, what I mean though is at the end\nof this project if we just support\n\n799\n00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,530\nMAME is it still a success, right?\n\n800\n00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,950\n>> Yes, I think so because, MAME, I means\nthere's hundreds, thousands of games.\n\n801\n00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,590\n>> Okay.\n>> On there.\n\n802\n00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:46,180\nAnd somebody should find\nsomething that they like.\n\n803\n00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,900\n>> Okay, so this way we don't really\nhave to worry about the other\n\n804\n00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,516\nones to start, right?\n\n805\n00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:54,335\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n806\n00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:58,020\n>> And we'll add\n>> And I'm writing this out because when\n\n807\n00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,680\nwe do our scope statement, we'll want\nto put exclusions

project done and\nnot get distracted by other things.\n\n810\n00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,150\nSo we'll say we will add support for,\nyou know,\n\n811\n00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,650\nSNES or Game Boy Advanced,\nor whatever at a later date.\n\n812\n00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,950\nI think we've got to add Atari, right?\n\n813\n00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,484\nYou've got to do that.\n\n814\n00:37:20,484

there.\n\n826\n00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,810\nYeah, so I'm sure there's ways around it,\nbut for right now,\n\n827\n00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,227\nwe're gonna support MAME.\n\n828\n00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:53,850\n>> Yep.\n\n829\n00:37:53,850 --> 00:38:01,220\n>> So we're gonna support MAME and\npublic domain software to start.\n\n830\n00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,350\nWe'll worry about the licensing later,\nright?\n\n831\n00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,330\nI mean the license material,\n\n832\n00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,620\nnot getting the license because\nwe want to be on the up and up.\n\n833\n00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,210\nSo we'll have a main cabinet\nwith public domain software.\n\n834\n00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,180\nNow Nate I've seen software out there\n\n835\n00:38:13,180

you going to do with it\nwhen it's just a title screen?\n\n850\n00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,560\n>> How much?\n>> Okay, but\n\n851\n00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,130\nif we get the public domain games, or\nwhatever, and you throw them in there, and\n\n852\n00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,650\nthe front end is free, then technically,\nall the software's free, right?\n\n853\n00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,680\n>> Technically.\n\n854\n00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,000\n>> And then, the license software,\nwhich we've stated,\n\n855\n00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,165\nwe'll worry about license software later,\nso we'll worry about public domain now.\n\n856\n00:39:07,165 --> 00:39:09,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, there's no cost there.\n\n857\n00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,680\nBut, we probably need to pick,\nthere's multiple front ends to pick from.\n\n858\n00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,660\n>> Just one.\n\n859\n00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,400\n>> Oh, there's just one?\n\n860\n00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n861\n00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,040\n>> Hyper spin?\n\n862\n00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,420\n>> Yep.\n>> Okay, so you know, we\n\n863\n00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,270\ndon't want to entertain any other options,\nhyper spin is the one for us?\n\n864\n00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,760\n>> I think so, I think we'll\nmove forward with it and yep.\n\n865\n00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:36,160\n>> If we do get that coin slot,\ncan we make it receive like an SD card, so\n\n866\n00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,518\nthat's why you can load games in this\n[INAUDIBLE], you could slide them.\n\n867\n00:39:40,518 --> 00:39:41,740\n>> [LAUGH] I bet we could.\n\n868\n00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,710\n>> Maybe not the scope, but.\n\n869\n00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,940\n>> We could put smart

that.\n\n880\n00:40:05,782 --> 00:40:08,810\nUpright cabinet, that's a primary now.\n\n881\n00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,415\nAnd must support four players\nwe said was a primary.\n\n882\n00:40:11,415

it.\n\n886\n00:40:18,661 --> 00:40:23,550\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n887\n00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,560\nLet's see, track ball support and\n\n888\n00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,840\nyou know where I am putting like\nfirst to get cut, second to get cut?\n\n889\n00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,849\nI am forgetting that I\nhave my priority call and\n\n890\n00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:35,426\nI should be using it to prioritize those,\nbecause really,\n\n891\n00:40:35,426 --> 00:40:39,054\nthese optional ones would get cut before\nany of those secondary ones would get cut.\n\n892\n00:40:39,054 --> 00:40:39,815\n>> Oh.\n\n893\n00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:40,360\n>> Hm.\n\n894\n00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,753\n>> So\nwe'll just make use of my primary column.\n\n895\n00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:46,090\nAll right, some of these other ones\nmust create an arcade-like feel.\n\n896\n00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,810\nI think we've met that now with\nour other requirements, right?\n\n897\n00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:49,335\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n898\n00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:49,843\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n899\n00:40:49,843 --> 00:40:50,530\n>> So, all right, so\n\n900\n00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,280\nI think we can get rid of that one,\nwhich that was the only one that had any\n\n901\n00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,015\nworried just cuz it wasn't\nsomething that you could measure.\n\n902\n00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:57,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n903\n00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,860\n>> All right, so multiple track balls.\n\n904\n00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:05,240\nDefinitely at $130 a track ball,\nI don't see us adding more track balls.\n\n905\n00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,680\nBut adding potential support for it.\n\n906\n00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,120\nRight?\nSo, I'll add that in.\n\n907\n00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,570\nOr support for it in the future.\n\n908\n00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:19,136\nSo maybe we leave space in the layout for\nwhere you'd insert those track balls and\n\n909\n00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:19,821\nwhatever.\n\n910\n00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:20,623\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n911\n00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:23,955\n>> The electronics that this\ngentleman has picked out,\n\n912\n00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:26,520\ndo they support more than trackball?\n\n913\n00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,580\n>> No.\n\n914\n00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,406\nNo.\n>> So, there'd be new\n\n915\n00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:29,357\nelectronics involved.\n\n916\n00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:29,857\nCorrect.\n\n917\n00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,695\n>> I'm kinda voting to drop that anyway.\n\n918\n00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:35,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Eh.\n\n919\n00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,296\n>> But,\njust because with the four controllers and\n\n920\n00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:38,540\nthe elbow room while you're playing.\n\n921\n00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,225\n>> Eh.\n\n922\n00:41:39,225 --> 00:41:40,827\n>> Swing at it.\nIt's already pretty squeezed.\n\n923\n00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:41,450\n>> I'm not keen.\n\n924\n00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,340\n>> If you put in that track ball, you're\ngonna put your elbow in somebody's face.\n\n925\n00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,050\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n926\n00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:45,990\n>> I'm not keen on buying\n\n927\n00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,970\nextra hardware or\nreplacing hardware just to support it too.\n\n928\n00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,260\nSo, what do you think?\n\n929\n00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,868\nShould we just knock out\nmultiple track balls?\n\n930\n00:41:51,868 --> 00:41:52,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n931\n00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:52,998\n>> Alright.\n\n932\n00:41:52,998 --> 00:41:56,620\n>> Yeah.\nWe can bag it.\n\n933\n00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,220\n>> All right.\n\n934\n00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,630\nLight gun support,\nwe've flagged as optional.\n\n935\n00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,370\nI don't really know what's involved,\nso there's sensors you have to get and\n\n936\n00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,330\nthen does the electronics\nhere support light gun?\n\n937\n00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,830\n>> Probably, I am not entirely sure.\n\n938\n00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,052\nIt's kind of a new project to me.\n\n939\n00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:13,450\n>> All right, that's fair enough, so\n\n940\n00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,170\nI'll put down here light gun\nsupport needs more research.\n\n941\n00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,535\n>> Yes, but it would be absolutely,\nincredibly awesome, though, to have it.\n\n942\n00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:22,889\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n943\n00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,360\nSo, we got our budget, our time.\n\n944\n00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,920\nWe got a list of requirements.\n\n945\n00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,340\nLet's just open up.\n\n946\n00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,080\nCan you guys think of anything else that\nwe need to add in that would be a gauge of\n\n947\n00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,540\nsuccess?\n\n948\n00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,760\n>> I would say a better sound system.\n\n949\n00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,870\nSomething with either like a sub woofer or\nsome sort of shaker in there.\n\n950\n00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:45,640\nTo where, because right now,\nout are these little four inch\n\n951\n00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,942\ntiny 8 ohm speakers that\nwill get the job done.\n\n952\n00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:54,470\nThey're gonna plug into the speaker\nport on the PC, yeah, not that great.\n\n953\n00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,580\nI mean if your gonna play like cruising\nUSA or something It's not gonna have\n\n954\n00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,360\nthe same kind of level that\nwe had maybe an amplifier,\n\n955\n00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:08,470\nmaybe a powered sub woofer or something\nto where you can really get, yeah,\n\n956\n00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,610\nI mean we're not talking\nabout surround sound.\n\n957\n00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:15,380\nJust better quality, and\nMDF right, resonates really well.\n\n958\n00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,740\n>> Yeah that's what they make a lot of\nspeaker box's out of or [INAUDIBLE].\n\n959\n00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,040\nIs that gonna actually go\nagainst our arcade like feel?\n\n960\n00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,349\nBecause I don't have any fond\nmemories of great sound.\n\n961\n00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Crappy sound.\n\n962\n00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,740\nYeah.\n\n963\n00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,380\n>> Hey we just want whatever.\n\n964\n00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,730\n>> Does anybody have anything else.\n\n965\n00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,575\n>> If we want arcade fell we need\nto make like 20 of these boxes.\n\n966\n00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:39,375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n967\n00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:44,550\n[LAUGH] All right, let's put it in here,\nthe upgraded sound system,\n\n968\n00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,400\ncuz I'm also thinking,\nhow hard would it be to put a switch in\n\n969\n00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,920\nto switch between crappy little speakers,\nand so that would be pretty easy to do.\n\n970\n00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,220\nBut I'm gonna list this as optional,\nbecause upgraded speakers that would be,\n\n971\n00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,930\nyou know they probably have a decent cost\nif you were to get like some clips or\n\n972\n00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,890\nwhatever speakers they probably\nrun a hundred bucks or\n\n973\n00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,210\nsomething like that so\nwe'll just put option.\n\n974\n00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,750\nYou know if we can, we can.\n\n975\n00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,480\nIf not, its not a big deal.\n\n976\n00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,850\nAll right anything else guys?\n\n977\n00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,915\n>> Maybe a steering wheel so\nwe can play Eiden Stewart's Off Road.\n\n978\n00:44:19,915 --> 00:44:23,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, I've played that game.\n\n979\n00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,900\nI played it with a joystick,\nnot a steering wheel.\n\n980\n00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,530\n>> Really?\n\n981\n00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,950\n>> Yeah.\n>> We had the foot pedal.\n\n982\n00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:31,600\nWe had that little teeny tiny\nsteering wheel that only had\n\n983\n00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,690\nthat much throw into it and\n\n984\n00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,170\nyou're just like slamming the crap out\nof it because your truck's not turning.\n\n985\n00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,835\n>> That might be a reason not to do it.\n\n986\n00:44:37,835 --> 00:44:41,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know how-\n\n987\n00:44:41,350 -->

wheels.\n\n990\n00:44:46,613 --> 00:44:49,660\nWouldn't it get kind of messy\ntrying to mount steering wheels?\n\n991\n00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,818\n>> They would have to be like modular and\nhave, maybe we could do like--\n\n992\n00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:55,600\n>> I think we\n\n993\n00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,910\nmight have to build a second arcade\ncabinet at some other point and\n\n994\n00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,130\nthat one might be the steering\nwheel one or something.\n\n995\n00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,240\nI don't know.\nSo, all right.\n\n996\n00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,690\nWell, we'll hold off on that.\n\n997\n00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,870\nI don't think I'm even gonna put\nthat in here as a requirement.\n\n998\n00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,380\nWe're gonna leave it optional.\n\n999\n00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,750\nI think we'll hold off on that.\n\n1000\n00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,470\n>> At least you put down\nthe light gun support, and\n\n1001\n00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,960\nI'm good with light gun support, so.\n\n1002\n00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,080\n>> If we can make it happen, cool.\n\n1003\n00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,850\nI

more research and\nyeah we've got that.\n\n1013\n00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:51,880\n>> You know Nate didn't actually request\nany of these which is kind of unusual.\n\n1014\n00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,480\n>> I know, well I was going to,\n\n1015\n00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,350\nI was going to but\n>> Yeah.\n\n1016\n00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,870\nWe'll see.\n\n1017\n00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,330\nSo that will be like a suppress.\n\n1018\n00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,570\n>> What I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to take this information.\n\n1019\n00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,730\nI think we definitely\ngot a pretty good start.\n\n1020\n00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,210\nI'm going to take this and\nafter the meeting I'll go and\n\n1021\n00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,900\nactually plug this in to my requirements,\nmatrix here.\n\n1022\n00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,080\nI just kind of went freehand\nto get this stuff together.\n\n1023\n00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,305\nWe'll get it put in the matrix,\nand, be in the matrix.\n\n1024\n00:46:18,305 --> 00:46:20,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And once it's in there, we'll meet\n\n1025\n00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,940\nagain, because we still need to have our\nschedule meeting, we need to have our\n\n1026\n00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,270\nbudget meeting, we need to start talking\nabout our work breakdown structure.\n\n1027\n00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,120\nSo, we know, like, materials, and\n\n1028\n00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,720\nwhat we want, what's it going to\ntake to actually achieve this.\n\n1029\n00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,070\nWhat work has to be done?\n\n1030\n00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,610\nAnd so that'll be another meeting for us.\n\n1031\n00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,710\nBut I think as far as our requirements,\nwe've got it.\n\n1032\n00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:40,766\nDoes everybody feel good about this?\n\n1033\n00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:41,556\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1034\n00:46:41,556 --> 00:46:42,183\n>> Feels good.\n\n1035\n00:46:42,183 --> 00:46:43,460\n>> All right.\n\n1036\n00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,218\nSo everybody out there, what we've\ndone now is we've basically drafted\n\n1037\n00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:50,380\nour requirements,\neverybody had their input and feedback.\n\n1038\n00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,170\nYou saw how some requirements came and\nwent, some went up in priorities,\n\n1039\n00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:55,270\nsome went down in priority.\n\n1040\n00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,210\nThat's all part of the process, right?\n\n1041\n00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,630\n>> Right.\n>> All part of the show,\n\n1042\n00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,690\nand I know that what I've got\nright now it's just version 1.0.\n\n1043\n00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:05,440\nWe're going to have to update this\nas we come up with new things,\n\n1044\n00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,500\nespecially when we start identifying\nactual work that needs to be done.\n\n1045\n00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,200\nWe'll probably find some new\nrequirements at that point.\n\n1046\n00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,810\nSo our next meeting will be about setting\nan actual schedule and an actual budget.\n\n1047\n00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,670\nWe've got a lot of \"what\nifs\" number wise here.\n\n1048\n00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,940\nI want to nail that down, right?\n\n1049\n00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,010\nSo does that pricing include shipping and\nstuff?\n\n1050\n00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,510\nThis is all stuff we need to know.\n\n1051\n00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,330\nI want to know some actual numbers, right?\n\n1052\n00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,810\nSo everybody's got some homework.\n\n1053\n00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,650\nHere's where we throw\nout the action items.\n\n1054\n00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,400\nA meeting with no action\nitem is worthless.\n\n1055\n00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,690\nSo Rob, if you can take a look at what\nthose materials are going to cost,\n\n1056\n00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:43,460\nas far as the wood, the castors,\nthe screws, the glue and\n\n1057\n00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,370\ncome up with estimates of how much\ntime that's really going to take you.\n\n1058\n00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,690\n>> Okay.\n>> And so on, so work on that.\n\n1059\n00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:55,445\nNate, we need you to do\nthe electronics side of it, right?\n\n1060\n00:47:55,445 --> 00:47:55,968\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1061\n00:47:55,968 --> 00:48:00,090\n>> Take a look at what the actual\ncost with shipping are gonna be.\n\n1062\n00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:03,960\nAnd see if you can document the lead time\non each one, so that we can track them.\n\n1063\n00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,140\nI mean, if five things can be\nordered from the same vendor,\n\n1064\n00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,060\njust the lead time of that as a whole.\n\n1065\n00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:11,240\nBut so we can put that in our schedule and\ntrack that.\n\n1066\n00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,270\nRonnie, I think I'm gonna get\nyou to revise this document,\n\n1067\n00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,410\nas the assistant project manager.\n\n1068\n00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:18,130\n>> All right.\n\n1069\n00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,080\n>> So I'll turn this over to you, and\n\n1070\n00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,370\nyou can just take this and\nplug it into the matrix.\n\n1071\n00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,150\nNow the work breakdown structure\ndeliverables and stuff,\n\n1072\n00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,560\njust leave that blank for now.\n\n1073\n00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,700\nWe'll do that after we actually\ncreate the work breakdown structure.\n\n1074\n00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,855\n>> Sounds good.\n>> And then I'll drink a mai tai.\n\n1075\n00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:35,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's my action item, so\n\n1076\n00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,460\nyeah, I'll sit back and review.\n\n1077\n00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,300\nSo I think we're good, let's have\nanother meeting, we'll see when.\n\n1078\n00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,360\nHow much time do you guys think you need\nfo research, planning and all of that?\n\n1079\n00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,620\n>> A couple of days?\n\n1080\n00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,740\n>> A day or two.\n\n1081\n00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,070\n>> Okay.\n>> So it's Wednesday.\n\n1082\n00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,250\n>> Let's do Friday.\n\n1083\n00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,170\n>> Friday?\nOkay.\n\n1084\n00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,640\n>> Okay.\n>> So we'll have another meeting Friday.\n\n1085\n00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,060\nRight before the long weekend.\n\n1086\n00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,500\nAnd we'll go from there.\n\n1087\n00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,300\n>> Sweet.\n\n1088\n00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,050\n>> Excellent.\n\n1089\n00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,320\n>> All right.\nWell everybody out there in TV land.\n\n1090\n00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,360\nWe hope that you guys enjoyed that.\n\n1091\n00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,630\nObviously not official training here,\nbut we wanted you to get an example of\n\n1092\n00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,370\nwhat these project meetings are like and\nhow they go.\n\n1093\n00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,680\nAnd we had a small enough group here\nthat we didn't need a white board or\n\n1094\n00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,710\nanything crazy like that.\n\n1095\n00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,839\nBut it definitely gives you\nan idea of that process.\n\n1096\n00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:14,125\nSo all right, yep, that's all I've got.\n\n1097\n00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:16,365\nI hope you guys enjoyed it,\nand we'll see you next time.\n\n1098\n00:49:16,365 -->

00:00:38.380\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.990\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.050\nToday, Mr. Nate Copeland.\n\n6\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.950\nHow's it going, Nate?\n\n7\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.670\n&gt;&gt; Pretty good Don, pretty good.\n\n8\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.479\n&gt;&gt; We got another exciting\nLinux Plus episode ahead of us, and\n\n9\n00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.087\nthis is actually an episode I know some\nof our viewers have been waiting for.\n\n10\n00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:54.675\nBecause we're gonna drift away from\nthe command line interface and\n\n11\n00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:59.190\ndabble briefly in the world\nof graphical user interfaces.\n\n12\n00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.462\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I took this opportunity\nto jump in, fill in for Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:01:04.462 --> 00:01:08.100\nAnd some of the command line stuff,\nI do like it.\n\n14\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.603\nUsing command line stuff it makes\nme feel like a smart computer user.\n\n15\n00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:12.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like back in the day when\n\n16\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.880\neverything is done on the keyboard,\nbut after, you can only look at so\n\n17\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.030\nmany lines and\nclick on things and type stuff.\n\n18\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.190\nBut to get into the GUI, it's,\nfinally get to use a mouse, so.\n\n19\n00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and for our Mac users out there,\n\n20\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.120\nand for our newer, younger people just\ncoming out of high school right now,\n\n21\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.280\na graphic user interface is what you know.\n\n22\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.790\nIt's what you grew up with, right?\n\n23\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.350\nAnd so it's what you're used to,\nand it is a lot more intuitive.\n\n24\n00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.060\nThe command line gives\nus a lot more power.\n\n25\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.240\nAnd for those of us who have been in\nthe computer industry a lot longer,\n\n26\n00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.420\nthe old days, we didn't have mice,\nwe didn't have GUI's, we had command line.\n\n27\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.250\nSo for people like me,\n\n28\n00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.220\nI find myself dropping to command\nline as often as I am in the GUI.\n\n29\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.460\nIt's kind of split.\n\n30\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.030\nWell, you've seen me work Nate, you know\nhalf the time I'm just in a text editor.\n\n31\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.712\nI don't even like to use Word or whatever.\n\n32\n00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:08.260\nSo these are the, I'm just that guy,\nI just won't let go.\n\n33\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.740\nBut, so, for some of you guys,\nI don't know, I know, not all of you,\n\n34\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.118\nnot even most of you, but\nthere's at least one or\n\n35\n00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:18.130\ntwo of you that are out there going man,\nI though Linux+ was gonna be a lot easier.\n\n36\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.150\nBecause I've been running Ubuntu and\nI just drag these folders and\n\n37\n00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.040\nI've got my little wizards and stuff.\n\n38\n00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.080\nAnd that's true,\nthat's exactly how that's supposed to be.\n\n39\n00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.760\nThe desktop experience,\n\n40\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.390\nwhat you're experiencing with the GUI,\nthat's what's designed for end users.\n\n41\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.330\nFor people who don't need\na steep learning curve,\n\n42\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.110\nwho don't need a power experience, and\nso you get it a lot more simplified.\n\n43\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.070\nAnd for day to day use,\nby all means, do that.\n\n44\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.680\nIt's not a bad thing, right?\n\n45\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.230\nBut on a server, where you're\nconcerned about power and efficiency,\n\n46\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.309\ngetting things done fast.\n\n47\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.988\nAnd not just getting one thing done, but\n\n48\n00:02:50.988 --> 00:02:54.087\ngetting of hundreds of things done at the\nsame time, you don't have time for a GUI.\n\n49\n00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:57.713\nYou don't have the resources available\nto waste on rendering pretty\n\n50\n00:02:57.713 --> 00:03:01.715\nbuttons on the screen when your server\nprobably doesn't even have a monitor\n\n51\n00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.046\nattached to it, right?\n\n52\n00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:05.039\nI think it was in some episode,\n\n53\n00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:09.270\nwe brought up a picture of one of\nthe Google data centers, right?\n\n54\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.170\nLet me see if I can find one real quick.\n\n55\n00:03:14.087 --> 00:03:16.480\nLet's go to images.google.com.\n\n56\n00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.250\nSo Google has these data centers and they\nrun their own special version of Linux,\n\n57\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.980\nthey won't tell anybody what it is.\n\n58\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.094\nBut, hm?\n\n59\n00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:24.930\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n60\n00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they, so-\n&gt;&gt; I guess I wasn't\n\n61\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.470\nlistening on that episode.\n\n62\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't remember what,\nit might've been in my head.\n\n63\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.171\nSometimes these things happen in my head,\nand I think they happened in real life.\n\n64\n00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:40.576\nBut Google, they created a special\ninternal version of Linux that they run,\n\n65\n00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:43.353\nand they use,\nnot on their Chromebooks, but for\n\n66\n00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:46.710\ntheir internal employees it's this deep,\ndark secret.\n\n67\n00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.760\nAnd they don't want to tell people about\nit, because the more people know about it,\n\n68\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.498\nthe harder it becomes to secure.\n\n69\n00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:55.543\nBut yeah, so\nthey have a bunch of servers that\n\n70\n00:03:55.543 --> 00:03:59.171\nare especially designed just for them.\n\n71\n00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:03.501\nAnd you can kind of see them right here\nthis is what a Google data center looks\n\n72\n00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:05.504\nlike and, can I make that bigger?\n\n73\n00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:07.130\nI don't want to see pretty lights.\n\n74\n00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.860\nA lot of people want to see pretty lights,\n\n75\n00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.530\nand you see he's kind of\nlike making it himself.\n\n76\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.691\nBut basically they have these custom\nmade servers that are just rack upon\n\n77\n00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:20.003\nrack upon rack of these servers with\nno monitor, no keyboard, whatever.\n\n78\n00:04:20.003 --> 00:04:23.304\nThey just boot right up they go right\ninto handling their search indexing and\n\n79\n00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.730\nall that good stuff.\n\n80\n00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.000\nSo that kind of a thing,\nyou don't need a GUI for that.\n\n81\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.780\nYou can save a lot of memory.\n\n82\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.750\nYou can save a lot of disk I/O by\njust abandoning the GUI altogether.\n\n83\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.504\nThat's something that Google understands.\n\n84\n00:04:37.504 --> 00:04:40.480\nThat's something that every\nLinux distro understands.\n\n85\n00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.090\nThat's something that Novell\nunderstood with NetWare.\n\n86\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.330\nIt's something that Microsoft\nis learning with Windows,\n\n87\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.490\nright, cuz now they're starting to do\nthe core server installs and stuff.\n\n88\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.520\nBut it's something we've had in\nthe Linux world since the beginning.\n\n89\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.900\nSo, it's something we can take\nadvantage of is just going CLI only.\n\n90\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.212\nBut, on a desktop we\nprobably want that GUI.\n\n91\n00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:02.500\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntake a look at today.\n\n92\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.300\nNow, Linux is all about choice.\n\n93\n00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.050\nYou can pick from a wide variety\nof graphical user interfaces.\n\n94\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.685\nWhen we installed CentOS back\nin episode number two, I think,\n\n95\n00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:18.630\n[LAUGH] I'm pretty sure it was episode\ntwo, we choose to do, or at least\n\n96\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.880\nI choose to do a basic install, which did\nnot include a graphical user interface.\n\n97\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.770\nAnd that's my machine right here that\nwe've been working with all show, so\n\n98\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.050\nI've been just going through here and\nworking, running commands.\n\n99\n00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.080\nIt's been exciting, right?\n\n100\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.930\nHad I chosen to do a desktop install,\n\n101\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.960\nthough, with the graphical user interface,\nwhen I boot it up,\n\n102\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.710\nI would have been greeted with a screen\nsomething like this, all right.\n\n103\n00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.870\nThis is the default desktop for CentOS.\n\n104\n00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.010\nIt's a graphical user interface, and\n\n105\n00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.720\nit's being rendered by a window\nmanager that's called GNOME.\n\n106\n00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.240\nGNOME is G-N-O-M-E.\n\n107\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.610\nIt is a open source,\nfreely available window manager.\n\n108\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.450\nAnd CentOS is not the only one to use it,\nright, CentOS and\n\n109\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.240\nRed Hat because they're linked together.\n\n110\n00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.770\nBut you also see like\nSolaris use GNOME for\n\n111\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.790\na long time, which, I don't even\nknow if Solaris is still around.\n\n112\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.760\nBut you'll see where FreeBSD\nhas support for GNOME.\n\n113\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.720\nLots of operating systems support\nthe GNOME window manager.\n\n114\n00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.710\nAnd so it starts to create this common\nGUI, even across the different distros,\n\n115\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.860\nand that's pretty nice.\n\n116\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.020\nBecause you might have Fedora running\nGNOME, or RHEL running GNOME,\n\n117\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.650\nor Debian running GNOME.\n\n118\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.690\nAnd all three of them look kinda the same.\n\n119\n00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.180\nSo you're at home regardless\nof which one you're on.\n\n120\n00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.210\nAnd it's arranged in a pretty\nstraightforward way.\n\n121\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.020\nIf you wanna browse to your home folder,\nhere it is and\n\n122\n00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.870\nI get a nice little graphical view of my\nhome folder and now I've got Documents and\n\n123\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.050\nDownloads, Pictures,\nand that kind of stuff.\n\n124\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.140\nI don't see .bashrc or\n.profile or whatever.\n\n125\n00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.250\nThey're there,\nI just don't see them, right.\n\n126\n00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.872\nThat stuff is kind of hidden away, and\nif I turn on my hidden files, I can go in\n\n127\n00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:07.171\nhere and like there's my .cache and here's\nmy .bashrc and stuff, they're there.\n\n128\n00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:11.285\nThey're just hidden away because your\naverage desktop user doesn't need to\n\n129\n00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:12.820\ndeal with that.\n\n130\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.620\nOkay, and\nwe've got nice little menus up here.\n\n131\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.410\nSo our applications are tucked away,\nwe can go in here and\n\n132\n00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.620\nbrowse the web with Firefox or if you\ninstalled Debian, then it's Iceweasel.\n\n133\n00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.550\nHave you heard about that whole thing?\n\n134\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.720\n&gt;&gt; No, I think you brought it up once or\ntwice.\n\n135\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.679\nBut once again, I don't think\nI was paying attention to it.\n\n136\n00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:31.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Par for the course when I talk?\n\n137\n00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.015\n&gt;&gt; So there was this big fight\nbetween the Mozilla developers and\n\n138\n00:07:36.015 --> 00:07:37.879\nthe Debian developers.\n\n139\n00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:42.679\nAnd At the end of the day the Debian guys\nfelt like the Mozilla developers were\n\n140\n00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:46.510\nbeing a little bit untrusting,\nor not acting in good faith.\n\n141\n00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.697\nAnd so Firefox on Debian,\nthey've changed the logo to be blue and\n\n142\n00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:53.170\nthey call it Iceweasel instead.\n\n143\n00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.576\nOr at least they were doing that for\nseveral versions.\n\n144\n00:07:54.576 --> 00:07:57.053\nI haven't checked the latest one to\nsee if they're still doing it but\n\n145\n00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:58.560\nthey were doing it for several versions.\n\n146\n00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.040\nVery funny.\n\n147\n00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.800\n&gt;&gt; Very funny.\n\n148\n00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.350\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I'm laughing on the inside.\n\n149\n00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.050\nBut you'll see all this stuff here.\n\n150\n00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.750\nNice easy to use menus.\n\n151\n00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.360\nYou can jump to your folders.\n\n152\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.310\nIf you want to shut down\nyou go to system and\n\n153\n00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.510\nshut down we don't have to\ndo a crazy command line.\n\n154\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:19.090\nWe don't worry about run levels and inits,\nit's all nice right here in our GUI,\n\n155\n00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.100\nand if we want to add more software\nI don't have to think about.\n\n156\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.645\nYum or anything like that,\nI can just go to Administration and\n\n157\n00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:29.600\nAdd/Remove Software, and\nI can find what I want to add.\n\n158\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.870\nSo if I wanna add some kind of\nproject management software,\n\n159\n00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.580\nI can find and let's see where is project.\n\n160\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.230\nIt's buried in here somewhere.\n\n161\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.160\nThe search didn't really narrow\nthings down for me did it.\n\n162\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.390\nSomewhere in here there's\nlike a web not a web base,\n\n163\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.510\nbut a graphical user interface\nproject management software.\n\n164\n00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.150\nAll right.\n\n165\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.472\nWell apparently I'm not gonna find it.\n\n166\n00:08:51.472 --> 00:08:54.980\nBut [LAUGH] it's in there\nsomewhere dadgummit.\n\n167\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.500\nAnd so you can go through,\n\n168\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.360\nyou can find all sorts of stuff\nbased on what your needs are.\n\n169\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.440\nThere's LibreOffice if\nI want a Office suite.\n\n170\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.230\nI think Open Office might\nalready be installed\n\n171\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.250\nthere's a project management tool.\n\n172\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.860\nTask juggler, or here I can do planner,\nplanner's a little smaller.\n\n173\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.530\nSo I can just check that off and apply it.\n\n174\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.350\nNow it's gonna install planner.\n\n175\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.840\nI'm not logged in as root,\n\n176\n00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.720\nI'm logged in as a regular user which is\ngood practice and so it's asking me for my\n\n177\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.930\nroot password because the root user is who\nhas permission to install the packages.\n\n178\n00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.060\nAnd so here it goes, it's gonna\ninstall it again not having to worry\n\n179\n00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.940\nabout repositories and stuff like that,\nit's sorting it all out for me.\n\n180\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.660\nThat's the advantage of\na graphical user interface.\n\n181\n00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.400\nAnd also in this graphical user\ninterface under applications, is it?\n\n182\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.550\nThere's a you still get down\nto the terminal correct?\n\n183\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.150\nSo you drop down to the command line.\n\n184\n00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.180\nSo really I mean you get\nthe best of both worlds, right.\n\n185\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.160\nSo I mean you still get a little\nmouse clicky navigation thing.\n\n186\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.330\nBut mouse clicky navigation thing, yes.\n\n187\n00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.420\nBut yeah and then if you need to get\ndown to the command line you can still\n\n188\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.990\ninto the terminal, right.\n\n189\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.740\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n190\n00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.520\nWe have x term and so if we go up\nto applications and system tools.\n\n191\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.470\nI'll see terminal right there.\n\n192\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.310\nAnd I can jump in and here I am you know.\n\n193\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.580\nWe can run all the different things that\nwe've been doing so far and I can work,\n\n194\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.330\nI can do my stuff.\n\n195\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.100\nMake whatever changes it is that\nI feel like I need to make.\n\n196\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.850\nI'm not a root user, so\nI can su and become one.\n\n197\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.530\nAnd there we go, so\nnow I can perform my root activities.\n\n198\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.510\nAnd I can get to work.\n\n199\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.890\nSo yeah,\nabsolutely the best of both worlds.\n\n200\n00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.052\nAnd there's some pretty advanced\nterminal clients that are out there.\n\n201\n00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:36.800\nYou can have tabbed ones,\nwhich actually does this one do tabs?\n\n202\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.590\nLet's see.\nCan I do a open tab there we go.\n\n203\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.660\nSo I can have multiple tabs.\n\n204\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.927\nSo this would be like my TTys,\nwhere I could do Alt F1, Alt F2, Alt F3.\n\n205\n00:10:45.927 --> 00:10:49.679\nWell here I can just have a bunch of tabs,\nand I can be running different things,\n\n206\n00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:50.640\nand going through.\n\n207\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.830\nSo maybe in one of these I launch,\nhold on get my commander installed.\n\n208\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.490\nBut I could run whatever,\nsome application.\n\n209\n00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.310\nMaybe I run top.\n\n210\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.470\nThere we go.\n\n211\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.030\nSo I'm running top over here,\nmeanwhile I come over here.\n\n212\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.760\nAnd I start to form some action\nlike that and so while it's\n\n213\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.550\ninstalling I jump over to top and now I\ncan see yum and I can monitor performance.\n\n214\n00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.390\nRight, so you get bouncing around.\n\n215\n00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.350\nIt's still the command line, but I'm\nbenefiting from the GUI side of things,\n\n216\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.530\nbeing able to use the mouse to\nquickly jump between these tabs\n\n217\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.350\nto see things to work with them,\nand to really get some stuff done.\n\n218\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.900\nEverything we do from the command line,\nwe can do right here.\n\n219\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.420\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nAnd that's running from the command line?\n\n220\n00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That window?\n\n221\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.465\n&gt;&gt; Again, not paying attention?\n\n222\n00:11:34.465 --> 00:11:36.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a text based.\n\n223\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.970\nIt looks graphical, but\n\n224\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.880\nit's actually a text based little\nfile manager called Midnight Command.\n\n225\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.820\nSo I like to use it when I want to show\nfull-screen apps that stay resonant, so.\n\n226\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.840\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n227\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.160\n&gt;&gt; Anyhow, so there's some stuff,\nit's exciting [LAUGH].\n\n228\n00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.790\nIt I know it's not really\nall that exciting.\n\n229\n00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.340\nBut that's basically it, and so\n\n230\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.080\nthese are kind of cool, Mad at me\ncuz I'm leaving software running.\n\n231\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.780\nBut this is nom, and nom is pretty common.\n\n232\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.450\nIt's not the only graphical user\ninterface that's out there though.\n\n233\n00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.930\nNom is very popular.\n\n234\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.260\nAnother one that is popular is KDE.\n\n235\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.570\nAll right.\n\n236\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.021\nHere is CentOS running KDE, all right.\n\n237\n00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:23.390\nAt KDE it's a very, very sharp looking,\npleasant user interface.\n\n238\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.280\nI mean it looks sharp but\nlook at these semi transparent windows.\n\n239\n00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.270\nThey got rounded edges.\n\n240\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.310\nI feel like i'm talking\nabout a used car here.\n\n241\n00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.911\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was kept in a garage,\n\n242\n00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:32.860\nbarely been driven.\n\n243\n00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.286\n&gt;&gt; To the grocery store and back.\n\n244\n00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:38.320\n&gt;&gt; But you'll see it's got a lot of little\nlaunch pad here that we can pull up.\n\n245\n00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.800\nWe can search for applications, or\nwe've got our applications right here,\n\n246\n00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.750\nso that we can go in and\nfind what we're looking for.\n\n247\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:49.390\nThink I wanna play some card games,\nso I'll launch patience.\n\n248\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.510\nSo you go through and\nyou fire up your Freecell.\n\n249\n00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.620\nAnd then we'd really get some work done,\nright.\n\n250\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.940\nBut, so KDE is very nice.\n\n251\n00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.230\nIt's also fairly resource\nintensive though.\n\n252\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:04.160\nIt takes some work, right to keep\na GUI up and running like this.\n\n253\n00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.850\nIf you've got a nice graphics\ncard in your computer like\n\n254\n00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:14.040\nan ATI or an Nvidia,\nthen this stuff runs really sharp.\n\n255\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.130\nIf you've got an Intel card, if you're\ndoing standard business graphics,\n\n256\n00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.400\nthis can be a little overbearing.\n\n257\n00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.610\nSo KDE is popular for home users, not so\n\n258\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.190\npopular for\nbusiness users just as a general rule.\n\n259\n00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.390\nSo KDE is another option, this one has\na virtual desktop like already setup for\n\n260\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.830\nme and so it's neat.\n\n261\n00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.740\nAll right.\n\n262\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.785\nNow there's a third one too, correct.\n\n263\n00:13:33.785 --> 00:13:36.094\n[CROSSTALK] There's tons, tons.\n\n264\n00:13:36.094 --> 00:13:38.380\n&gt;&gt; A third one that we're\ngonna cover here, right.\n\n265\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.230\nThe xfce something like that.\n\n266\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.190\nBunch of kdexfce.\n\n267\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.785\nJust bunch of those.\n\n268\n00:13:43.785 --> 00:13:44.730\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All those letters.\n\n269\n00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.300\nYeah.\n\n270\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.590\nAnd some of them are really funny.\n\n271\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.340\nLike the original author don't remember\nwhat they stood for like fvwm is another\n\n272\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.060\none and if you ask the author, they don't\nreally remember what the letter stood for.\n\n273\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.300\nSo some of them are really nice like this.\n\n274\n00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.850\nRight.\nNome, nome is very pretty.\n\n275\n00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.310\nAnd it's very functional.\n\n276\n00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.390\nIt's a good balance between function and\nbeauty.\n\n277\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.180\nKDE it's high on the beauty side and\n\n278\n00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.390\nit's actually really good function wise\ntoo but it is pretty resource intensive.\n\n279\n00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.690\nMy personal favorite is\none called the Xfce.\n\n280\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.130\nIt is not very pretty, all right.\n\n281\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.660\nIt is all built around performance,\nit's extremely efficient.\n\n282\n00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.020\nYou don't see extra stuff, there's no 3D\nrendering involved in this desktop, but\n\n283\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:30.060\nyou'll your get your menu up here,\nyou get your applications, so\n\n284\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.940\nI can see my calendar and other things.\n\n285\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.890\nSo we get our programs and\napplications in here.\n\n286\n00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.510\nYou can run what you want,\nfire up your terminal emulator, whatever.\n\n287\n00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.660\nBut it's a very simple and\nplain graphical user interface.\n\n288\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.690\nOkay.\n\n289\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.420\nThere are many, many more out there.\n\n290\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.940\nAnd getting them configured\ncan be a little bit tricky.\n\n291\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.190\nTricky enough that a lot of vendors will\nmake it where when you go to download\n\n292\n00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:00.690\ntheir distro you can download the install\nCD with different default user interfaces.\n\n293\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.350\nA great example of that is Linux Mint.\n\n294\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.090\nThe Linux Mint guys do\na great job of this.\n\n295\n00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:11.220\nIf we take Linux mint, all right.\n\n296\n00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.940\nSo they're a Linux distribution,\nit's based on Ubuntu.\n\n297\n00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.260\nAnd it is a really good distribution,\nI like it.\n\n298\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.520\nAnd when you go to download it,\nif we go in here and we go to download,\n\n299\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.050\nI'll just go to the download page.\n\n300\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.360\nAll right.\n\n301\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.520\nSo the current version is,\nI guess Qiana, or however you say that.\n\n302\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.080\nBut when you go to download it,\nyou've got choices here.\n\n303\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.510\nAnd you've got the cinnamon desk top.\n\n304\n00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.460\nYou've got the matt or mate desktop,\nI forget how you say that.\n\n305\n00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.140\nThere's KDE, so\nthey actually don't have nome, so\n\n306\n00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.620\nyou can pick between these\ndifferent desktops that they have.\n\n307\n00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.238\nI don't have a machine running cinnamon.\n\n308\n00:15:48.838 --> 00:15:51.008\nLet me see if I can find\na quick image of it just so\n\n309\n00:15:51.008 --> 00:15:52.690\nyou guys can see a quick image of it.\n\n310\n00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.291\nHere we go.\n\n311\n00:15:53.291 --> 00:16:00.080\nSo that's what it look like very stylized,\nlooks a lot similar to the other desktops.\n\n312\n00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.185\nThe other one was the.\n\n313\n00:16:01.185 --> 00:16:03.310\n&gt;&gt; Matte,matt?\n\n314\n00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.154\nYeah, I think it's actually\npronounced matt or matte?\n\n315\n00:16:06.154 --> 00:16:09.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's some kind of African coffee bean\n\n316\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.573\nor something if I remember like serious.\n\n317\n00:16:10.573 --> 00:16:12.308\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it sounds like I make this\n\n318\n00:16:12.308 --> 00:16:15.220\nstuff up\n&gt;&gt; But there it is.\n\n319\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.530\nVery full featured.\n\n320\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.300\nIt's a little friendlier looking.\n\n321\n00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.240\nI like it.\n\n322\n00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.000\nBut these are just different user\ninterfaces that are available.\n\n323\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.870\nYou can actually have more than\none installed if you want.\n\n324\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:26.820\nYou can install all of these.\n\n325\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.410\nYou can install all five\nof these on your machine,\n\n326\n00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.550\nand when you login,\nyou have the choice to pick between them.\n\n327\n00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.320\nThat's important Because what we\nare looking at here, this user interface,\n\n328\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.250\nthis is not what's actually\ndriving the true user interface.\n\n329\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.930\nThis is what is drawing\non the screen sure, but\n\n330\n00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:47.535\non the back end there's a common\nsystem that's powering all of this.\n\n331\n00:16:47.535 --> 00:16:53.290\nAnd that common system is X11 or\nX11, right.\n\n332\n00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:59.286\nX11, that is the shoot it's gonna turn up\nstuff that I've searched for recently.\n\n333\n00:17:01.558 --> 00:17:02.220\nLet me just.\n\n334\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:02.960\nActually you know what,\n\n335\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.230\nit's kind of changed names, so\nI know why it's not turning up.\n\n336\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.450\nNow, it's x.org.\n\n337\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.740\nSo it was called X11 for the longest time,\nit's the X Windows system.\n\n338\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:17.330\nX Windows was the original graphical user\ninterface developed for Unix like systems.\n\n339\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.880\nAnd so it was ported to\nsupport Linux very early on.\n\n340\n00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.520\nAnd if you wanted a GUI in Linux,\nX Windows was all you used.\n\n341\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.100\nBut X Windows is not very user friendly.\n\n342\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.760\nAnd so over the years,\npeople have written KDE and\n\n343\n00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.310\nGnome and XFC and stuff like that.\n\n344\n00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:40.700\nThat lay on top of X Windows, and gives\nit all sorts of additional functionality.\n\n345\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.870\nSo think of it kind of like Linux.\n\n346\n00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.710\nWith Linux you had the Linux kernel, and\nthen the various distributions out there\n\n347\n00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.390\nhave all the tools that wrap\naround it to create your OS.\n\n348\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.820\nWell X windows is kind\nof like that kernel.\n\n349\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.410\nIt's the heart of your GUI and\nthen your desktop, your\n\n350\n00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.100\nWindow manager is what that's called, your\nwindow manager lays on top of that and\n\n351\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.360\nit's what creates what you actually\ninteract with on the screen.\n\n352\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.090\nSo you're picking between all sorts\nof different window managers.\n\n353\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.550\nI might pick KDE or I might pick Gnome.\n\n354\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.290\nAt the end of the day underneath it is X.\n\n355\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.150\nNow X went through several revisions over\nthe years, and so it was X11R5, X11R6,\n\n356\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.380\neach of the different releases.\n\n357\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.680\nAnd then with X11R7,\nthey renamed it to just x.org.\n\n358\n00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.010\nOkay, and if you look at\ntheir website it's www.x.org.\n\n359\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.400\nThat's why they did that, so it would\nkind of match in line with domain name.\n\n360\n00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.870\nSo now what's called x org and\nit's still freely available.\n\n361\n00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.840\nIt's ported to tons of systems.\n\n362\n00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.350\nIt can run just about anywhere and\nwhat x does is it\n\n363\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:45.100\nhelps ensure the different programs\ncan run in Windows and that they.\n\n364\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.950\nNot Windows like Microsoft but\nin Windows on our screen.\n\n365\n00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:52.190\nAnd that they can interact and multi-task\nwithout interfering with each other.\n\n366\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.476\nIt's taking care that graphically drawing\nof these Windows onto our screen.\n\n367\n00:18:57.476 --> 00:19:00.610\n&gt;&gt; Don, so\nthis reminds me a lot like android.\n\n368\n00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.880\nRight.\nI'm an android user and at the base,\n\n369\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:09.720\nright of Android we have wether it's AOSP\nor Touch Wiz or something like that,\n\n370\n00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.430\nbut then you can different launchers that\ngo on top of this where you can interact\n\n371\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.870\nwith everything and different\nlaunchers you can different looks and\n\n372\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.930\ndifferent little things thrown in there.\n\n373\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.570\nYeah, reminds me a lot like that.\n\n374\n00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.120\n&gt;&gt; That's a great example.\n\n375\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.280\nUnder the hood and in fact I think\nandroid doesn't android use xorg?\n\n376\n00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.050\nI think it might.\n\n377\n00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.000\nI'd have to look that up.\n\n378\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.180\nI'm not sure now.\n\n379\n00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.500\nBut any anyhow,\nit has to used some kind of,\n\n380\n00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.530\nI'm forgetting the word for\nwhat that's called, shoot it's a really\n\n381\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:42.545\nfancy long name too for what's responsible\nfor drawing crap on your screen.\n\n382\n00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:43.162\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n383\n00:19:43.162 --> 00:19:45.040\n[LAUGH] I'll have to look\nit up during the break.\n\n384\n00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.150\nNow it's a cool word.\n\n385\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.395\nI would have seemed really smart if\nI could have remembered it off hand.\n\n386\n00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:49.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyhow, so\n\n387\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.240\nthen it has to have a GUI on top of it,\nand so yeah,\n\n388\n00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.740\nyou use launchers in Android, but here\nwe have our Window managers, all right.\n\n389\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.120\nSo our Windows are being\nkinda generated by these.\n\n390\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.820\nWe can pick from any window\nmanager we want, all right.\n\n391\n00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.520\nWhen you boot up that graphical UI though.\n\n392\n00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.670\nThe first thing you see is\nnot your Window manager.\n\n393\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.560\nIt's actually your desktop manager.\n\n394\n00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.500\nThe desktop manager is what determines,\nwell first off,\n\n395\n00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.680\nit handles your login, right.\n\n396\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.740\nCuz you gotta login before you\nget the ability to run things.\n\n397\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.500\nSo the desktop manager's gonna ask you for\n\n398\n00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.328\nyour username and\npassword before you login.\n\n399\n00:20:22.328 --> 00:20:26.900\nOnce you login, it's then going to launch\nthe appropriate Window manager and\n\n400\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.670\nit's gonna run that Window\nmanager under your credentials.\n\n401\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.610\nSo that it's protected.\n\n402\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.150\nSo that it's got limited access\n\n403\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.410\npermissions limited to whatever\nyour permissions are, so\n\n404\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.810\nthe Window manager can't do anything\nthat you couldn't do yourself.\n\n405\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.250\nThat's pretty important.\n\n406\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:45.160\nSo while we have a bunch of different\nfront ends different Window managers,\n\n407\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.980\nthere are a handful of desktop managers\nthat are out there also that we'll\n\n408\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.060\nsee a little bit later, like KDM, GDM, so\n\n409\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.290\nthat's a KDE desktop manager,\nthe GNOME desktop manager.\n\n410\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.280\nThere's XDM, which is just\nthe X-Windows desktop manager.\n\n411\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.480\nSo we'll see that kind of combination.\n\n412\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.150\nThe desktop manager that handles just\ngetting us connected into the system,\n\n413\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.590\nlogged in, and\nlaunching the Window manager, and\n\n414\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.640\nthen the Window manager itself,\nwhich is what we interact with, right.\n\n415\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.610\nNow which one you pick is up to you.\n\n416\n00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.210\nDifferent distribution for\ndifferent one's.\n\n417\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.520\nI know I showed Linux meant which is not.\n\n418\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.930\nNot the most popular Linux.\n\n419\n00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.100\nLet's take all the Ubuntu.\n\n420\n00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.040\nSo Ubuntu which is from [INAUDIBLE].\n\n421\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.706\nAnd if I remember, I default to what\ndoes do they default to, is it nome?\n\n422\n00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:32.420\n&gt;&gt; Hmm, you got me.\n\n423\n00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't recall, so I want to say\nthey default to nome, but if you go around\n\n424\n00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:42.000\nand look you'll find other people out\nthere that build things like K Ubuntu or.\n\n425\n00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.330\nKubuntu or however you want to say that.\n\n426\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.740\nAnd all it is is an ubuntu that's been\nreconfigured to use KDE by default,\n\n427\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.820\nso when you launch it it's the same\nubuntu under the hood, but\n\n428\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.990\nthe window manager set the default to KDE.\n\n429\n00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.980\nNow you could have just added KDE to the\nregular ubuntu and gone that route but you\n\n430\n00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.930\nhave to know how to do it and if you don't\nknow how to do it, this might be easier.\n\n431\n00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.810\nJust getting a distro that\nalready has it turned on.\n\n432\n00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.820\nSo you'll find a lot of\ndistros where they do that.\n\n433\n00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.520\nWhere they just change the windows\nmanager and that's it.\n\n434\n00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.020\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; So.\n\n435\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.238\nBut Trusty Tahr,\nthat's a goat of some sort.\n\n436\n00:22:17.238 --> 00:22:19.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lion goat.\n\n437\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Ubuntu, just\nbecause how bloated it gets so quickly, so\n\n438\n00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.440\nmuch extra software in there, it's really\nhard to keep it narrowed and focused.\n\n439\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.360\nBut that's me,\nbecause I'm kind of a minimalist.\n\n440\n00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.590\nIf you're a feature person, Ubuntu is\nawesome, it's got all the features you\n\n441\n00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.350\nwant, so different people,\ndifferent needs, I guess.\n\n442\n00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.462\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I gotta behave myself.\n\n443\n00:22:38.462 --> 00:22:42.130\n&gt;&gt; Some do, do you have a lot\nof icons on your desktop?\n\n444\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.870\nOr do you just keep everything,\nlike on your start screen?\n\n445\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.690\n&gt;&gt; I try not to keep icons on my desktop.\n\n446\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:47.660\nI try to keep it clean.\n\n447\n00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.006\n&gt;&gt; No, no, that's what it's there for is,\n&gt;&gt; But I can't see and\n\n448\n00:22:51.006 --> 00:22:52.780\nI quickly lost things.\n\n449\n00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.762\n&gt;&gt; Is it now?\n\n450\n00:22:53.762 --> 00:22:55.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n451\n00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.995\nWell that's an argument for\na different day.\n\n452\n00:22:56.995 --> 00:23:01.665\n[LAUGH] Just rest assured in the fact\nthat I'm right and Nate's wrong.\n\n453\n00:23:01.665 --> 00:23:03.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n454\n00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:07.420\n&gt;&gt; So that's kind of an overview there\nof what Window managers are like,\n\n455\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.970\nwhat they do and there are a ton more.\n\n456\n00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.010\nYou might be screaming at your monitor\nright now, going Don you forgot,\n\n457\n00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:18.120\nI love ice wm or whatever one cuz\nthere are literally hundreds of\n\n458\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.900\nthem that are out there and\nit's not like there's a right or a wrong.\n\n459\n00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.050\nYou pick which one you like best.\n\n460\n00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:27.840\nNow personally, I like to pick ones that\nI know are stable and gonna be around\n\n461\n00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.170\na while, which means I normally\npick the ones the OSes default to.\n\n462\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.950\nBut sometimes it gets really frustrating,\nbecause organizations like Ubuntu,\n\n463\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.360\nthey change every couple of\ndistributions and when they switch UIs,\n\n464\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.515\nall of a sudden you gotta retrain your\nemployees, and that's really frustrating.\n\n465\n00:23:41.515 --> 00:23:43.700\nSo there's pros and cons to that.\n\n466\n00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.590\nAll right.\n\n467\n00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.528\nAnother thing just to put\nin the back of your mind,\n\n468\n00:23:46.528 --> 00:23:49.357\nit probably won't show up on the exam,\nbut I just want you to be aware of.\n\n469\n00:23:49.357 --> 00:23:54.245\nIs that X one one, or X eleven, Xorg,\nwhatever we want to call it today,\n\n470\n00:23:54.245 --> 00:23:55.180\nit's old.\n\n471\n00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.298\nIt is really old, I can't preface this,\nbecause I'm older than it is.\n\n472\n00:24:00.298 --> 00:24:01.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it just had it's 30th\n\n473\n00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.550\nbirthday, okay.\n\n474\n00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.850\nSo it is 30 years old.\n\n475\n00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:05.996\nIt has been around a while.\n\n476\n00:24:05.996 --> 00:24:07.829\nIt was developed in the 80's.\n\n477\n00:24:07.829 --> 00:24:11.459\nAnd like any software that's\nbeen around for 30 years,\n\n478\n00:24:11.459 --> 00:24:13.550\nit's starting to show its age.\n\n479\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.759\nYou've got a lot of code in there that was\nwritten by people that are long since done\n\n480\n00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:18.745\nwith developing.\n\n481\n00:24:18.745 --> 00:24:21.900\nAnd it's just,\nit's getting a little rough.\n\n482\n00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.663\nAnd so they are, they being\nthe programming community at large,\n\n483\n00:24:26.663 --> 00:24:30.993\nare looking to create the next\nsuccessor to replace Xorg and\n\n484\n00:24:30.993 --> 00:24:36.288\ntake over as the new graphical desktop\nenvironment for the Linux world.\n\n485\n00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:40.985\nThe two main competitors that are out\nthere right now, there's Mir,\n\n486\n00:24:40.985 --> 00:24:45.454\nM-I-R, Mir which is from Canonical,\nthe people who do Ubuntu.\n\n487\n00:24:45.454 --> 00:24:49.920\nThe Mir window,\nsee this is where I need that compositor.\n\n488\n00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.910\nGot it, that's the word,\nthe desktop compositor.\n\n489\n00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.580\nI couldn't remember it.\n\n490\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.641\nIt composes the windows on\nthe screen that's what it does.\n\n491\n00:24:58.641 --> 00:25:02.552\n[LAUGH] So X11 is a compositor,\nI knew I'd remember.\n\n492\n00:25:02.552 --> 00:25:09.320\nSo anyhow, Mir is a compositor that's out\nthere and it's definitely coming along.\n\n493\n00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.970\nIt's got some quirks and some problems,\nso it's not generally accepted yet.\n\n494\n00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.640\nThe other one is Wayland,\nWayland is another one.\n\n495\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.730\nIt's got a cool name, I don't know\nthe history of the name on it, but\n\n496\n00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.960\nit's another one that's up and coming.\n\n497\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.990\nAnd so, you're starting to see like\nFedora, Red Hat's experimental OS.\n\n498\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.580\nWhere they're testing out Wayland support,\nand\n\n499\n00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.606\nthey're testing out other\nthings like Mir support.\n\n500\n00:25:30.606 --> 00:25:35.840\nIn the next few years,\nprobably in the next three years I'd say,\n\n501\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.578\nwe'll probably start to see a shift\nin people moving away from Xorg.\n\n502\n00:25:39.578 --> 00:25:44.040\nBut today if you're running\na stable version of Linux today,\n\n503\n00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.980\nyou're running Xorg.\n\n504\n00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.420\nIt really, for the longest time,\nwas your only choice.\n\n505\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.201\nIt was the only one that\nwas fully featured,\n\n506\n00:25:50.201 --> 00:25:51.704\neverything else was experimental.\n\n507\n00:25:51.704 --> 00:25:54.304\nOnly today are we getting to that\npoint where we have not one but\n\n508\n00:25:54.304 --> 00:25:56.204\ntwo competitors that\nare both really close.\n\n509\n00:25:56.204 --> 00:25:58.995\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n510\n00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:03.538\nIf you don't already, there's a lot of\ngreat Linux news sites that are out there.\n\n511\n00:26:03.538 --> 00:26:09.765\nI visit one called Phoronix,\nand it is phoronix.com.\n\n512\n00:26:09.765 --> 00:26:14.771\nAnd these guys, they post news and\nadvertisements and they post news about\n\n513\n00:26:14.771 --> 00:26:19.787\nthings that are happening in the Linux\nworld and how timely, look at this.\n\n514\n00:26:19.787 --> 00:26:22.037\nMir display server picks\nup some new features.\n\n515\n00:26:22.037 --> 00:26:26.625\nSo, Mir 0.3 is the next one,\nthe next release that's come out.\n\n516\n00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:30.365\nAnd I bet if we keep looking, we'll\nfind something in here about Wayland.\n\n517\n00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:34.670\nLet's see, KDE plasma got an update.\n\n518\n00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.537\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n519\n00:26:36.537 --> 00:26:39.069\nNow, maybe we can search and\nsee if we can find it on my own, but, so\n\n520\n00:26:39.069 --> 00:26:40.037\nthey post a lot of stuff.\n\n521\n00:26:40.037 --> 00:26:43.734\nSo, if you're trying to\nfollow the developments,\n\n522\n00:26:43.734 --> 00:26:48.985\nseeing as things are coming up,\nyou can kinda watch in here and see.\n\n523\n00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:52.935\nHere we go, so, GNOME Shell\nWayland Benchmarks From Fedora 20.\n\n524\n00:26:52.935 --> 00:26:54.365\nSo they're actually testing it out.\n\n525\n00:26:54.365 --> 00:26:56.215\nNow notice what they're\nsaying in that sentence.\n\n526\n00:26:56.215 --> 00:27:00.230\nThey're still running GNOME\nas their window manager.\n\n527\n00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:05.720\nBut underneath it the desktop compositor,\nthat's Wayland, that's replacing Xorg.\n\n528\n00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.240\nAnd it even says it, so while an Xorg\nserver is still used by default on Fedora\n\n529\n00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.070\n20, Wayland has become a viable option for\nearly adopters.\n\n530\n00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.290\nAnd that's dated,\nthat's actually dated from December.\n\n531\n00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.850\nThat's six months ago.\n\n532\n00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.490\nThat's not even a new article.\n\n533\n00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.470\nBut yeah, you'll see things don't\nreally look different, right, and\n\n534\n00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.580\nthat's not the point.\n\n535\n00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.320\nThe desktop compositor on the bottom, it's\nsupposed to provide stability, security.\n\n536\n00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.860\nThat's really an area where X11 is weak,\nor Xorg is weak.\n\n537\n00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.100\nBecause it was designed\nin a friendlier time, and\n\n538\n00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.660\nwe didn't have the interception\ntechniques that we have today but, yeah.\n\n539\n00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.510\nYou'll see a lot of news on this stuff.\n\n540\n00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.170\nIt's a good idea to stay\nup on Linux news sites.\n\n541\n00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:47.880\nI used to say, yeah,\nmake sure you watch Slashdot,\n\n542\n00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.245\nthere's a lot of stuff\nthat comes up on there.\n\n543\n00:27:49.245 --> 00:27:52.710\nNow it's just mostly garbage\nnews on there but Phoronix,\n\n544\n00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.760\nthey really have good stuff on Linux.\n\n545\n00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.162\nIt's on my little RSS feed\nlist I check every day.\n\n546\n00:27:58.162 --> 00:28:02.981\n&gt;&gt; So then, so\nwhether you're on a CentOS or Red Hat or\n\n547\n00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:08.371\nDebian, can you use any of\nthese desktop managers then?\n\n548\n00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:10.580\n&gt;&gt; Someone may or\nmay not have made a package for it.\n\n549\n00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.110\nIf they made a package for it,\nyeah, it's super easy, right?\n\n550\n00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.910\nBut if they haven't made a package for\nit, then you got to get the source and\n\n551\n00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:17.590\ncompile it.\n\n552\n00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.705\nAnd it becomes very, very challenging.\n\n553\n00:28:18.705 --> 00:28:21.640\nIt's really designed for\ndevelopers at that point.\n\n554\n00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.330\nSo, I don't know.\n\n555\n00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.840\nIf we were to do Debian,\nlet's see if we have any support.\n\n556\n00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.780\nThat's not what I want.\n\n557\n00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.620\nThat's probably gonna\ngive me something bad.\n\n558\n00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.218\nAny site, chaosreigns.com,\nI probably don't want to go to that.\n\n559\n00:28:36.218 --> 00:28:40.420\nBut, here, packages.debian.org,\nthat's what I want.\n\n560\n00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.510\nAnd so we can see if there's\nsome Wayland packages or not.\n\n561\n00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.040\nLooks like we've got libwayland client.\n\n562\n00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.630\nSo yeah,\nlooks like somebody's building it.\n\n563\n00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:51.795\nLibwaylanddev, xwayland.\n\n564\n00:28:51.795 --> 00:28:58.630\nExperimental rc-buggy, and\nthen there's libwayland0 wheezy stables.\n\n565\n00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:02.100\nThey actually have a stable release for\nwheezy so, yeah, you could deploy it.\n\n566\n00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.570\nSo, that's really the trick right there,\n\n567\n00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.840\nis your distro may or\nmay not support it yet.\n\n568\n00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.230\nBut, I can guarantee you,\n\n569\n00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.050\nthey're all testing it,\nbecause this is the way that it's going.\n\n570\n00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.730\nYou don't want to to be the last\ndistribution still running Xorg\n\n571\n00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.290\nwhen everybody else has moved\non to these new ones, and\n\n572\n00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.140\nthe big challenge is\nthe video card vendors.\n\n573\n00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:23.160\nATI, NVIDIA, and Intel,\nto a lesser extent, those three guys,\n\n574\n00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.980\nwhen they write their video card drivers\nfor Linux, they're not writing a video\n\n575\n00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.420\ncard driver for the CLI, your CLI\ndoesn't need a crazy video card driver.\n\n576\n00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.550\nThey're writing it for X.\n\n577\n00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:38.020\nAnd so all these years they've\ncreated X server drivers, right?\n\n578\n00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.413\nFor Xorg.\n\n579\n00:29:39.413 --> 00:29:43.912\nNow they're having to switch up and write\nMir drivers, or Wayland drivers, okay.\n\n580\n00:29:43.912 --> 00:29:46.750\nAnd what's gonna happen,\nthey're gonna pick the most popular ones.\n\n581\n00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.810\nAnd so there will come a time when\none of them takes over the lead.\n\n582\n00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.300\nAnd so you'll stop getting drivers for\nthe other.\n\n583\n00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.810\nSo you do need to stay on top of it.\n\n584\n00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.970\nAnd I can guarantee you that all\nthe distros are doing that right now.\n\n585\n00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.080\nThey're keeping an eye on this\nbecause there's multiple ones.\n\n586\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.360\nBut on the exam, Wayland and\nMir are not stable yet.\n\n587\n00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.910\nNot considered truly stable.\n\n588\n00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.100\nSo we're not using them in\nthe business world, everything's Xorg.\n\n589\n00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.640\nSo that's what we're gonna focus\non the rest of the episode.\n\n590\n00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.450\n&gt;&gt; Hm, nice.\n\n591\n00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:12.000\n&gt;&gt; Sound good?\n\n592\n00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.412\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nSounds great.\n\n593\n00:30:13.412 --> 00:30:16.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, ladies and gentleman,\nwhy don't we stop here and take a break?\n\n594\n00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:20.640\nAnd when we get back I wanna take\na stab at basically installing\n\n595\n00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.300\nX Windows on my basic install where\nI chose not to install one, right?\n\n596\n00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.440\nSo, if you pop the CD in and\nyou pick graphical, it's really easy, but\n\n597\n00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.500\nwhat about after the fact?\n\n598\n00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.814\nI wanna show you what's involved in\ngetting a GUI up and running and\n\n599\n00:30:31.814 --> 00:30:33.090\nwhat it's like.\n\n600\n00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.180\nThe joy of a GUI.\n\n601\n00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:34.680\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n602\n00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.121\n&gt;&gt; All right, so stay tuned.\n\n603\n00:30:36.121 --> 00:30:40.135\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n604\n00:30:40.135 --> 00:30:46.287\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n605\n00:30:46.287 --> 00:30:49.573\nSo in the last section or segment,\nwhatever, we got a chance to see some of\n\n606\n00:30:49.573 --> 00:30:53.410\nthe different user interfaces available,\nsome of the different desktops.\n\n607\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.030\nAnd now I wanna show you\nguys how to install them.\n\n608\n00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.900\nInstalling the GUI, it's super easy if\nyou do when you install the OS, right?\n\n609\n00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.710\nJust a little check mark and you're done.\n\n610\n00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.340\nIt takes care of everything.\n\n611\n00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:08.780\nBut what if you did a basic install,\nyou've got a command line interface, and\n\n612\n00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.520\nyou change your mind?\n\n613\n00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.860\nYou're like well, all right,\n\n614\n00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.910\nI guess I would kind of like\nto have that GUI, all right?\n\n615\n00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.000\nThere's a few things we have to do.\n\n616\n00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.138\nFirst off we have to install\nthe appropriate packages,\n\n617\n00:31:19.138 --> 00:31:22.287\nthe appropriate software\nthat's gonna power the GUI.\n\n618\n00:31:22.287 --> 00:31:26.410\nSecondly, we need to tell\nthe operating system to boot the GUI.\n\n619\n00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.900\nOtherwise we can manually run it,\nyou can run the GUI when you want it, and\n\n620\n00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.660\nthen close it, and then not have it.\n\n621\n00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.460\nSome people like that.\n\n622\n00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.450\nIf it's a server,\nmaybe you want the GUI every now and\n\n623\n00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.610\nthen just to make administration easier.\n\n624\n00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.710\nAnd then when you're not using it,\nyou just leave it closed.\n\n625\n00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.900\nSo maybe you don't want it to boot\nevery time the system fires up.\n\n626\n00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.620\nIt's kind of up to you, all right?\n\n627\n00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.690\nWell, I'm gonna take my\nbasic install right here.\n\n628\n00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.439\nAnd yep, this guy and\nhe's just straight up CLI, right?\n\n629\n00:31:50.439 --> 00:31:52.496\nWhen I boot up,\nit dumps me to a text prompt.\n\n630\n00:31:52.496 --> 00:31:56.278\nAnd it never actually goes Into\na graphical user interface.\n\n631\n00:31:56.278 --> 00:31:59.940\nIn fact the GUI's not even installed,\nI didn't pick that option.\n\n632\n00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.180\nSo if I want it I'm gonna\nhave to get it installed.\n\n633\n00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.422\nWell, let's just start with GNOME, because\nGNOME is the default desktop in CentOS and\n\n634\n00:32:07.422 --> 00:32:09.848\nit's probably one of\nthe easier ones to install.\n\n635\n00:32:09.848 --> 00:32:15.700\nIf I wanna install it, I can use\nthe yum groupinstall command, right?\n\n636\n00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.667\nSo, I actually have a group for\nit that is called the X Window system,\n\n637\n00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:23.060\nlike that, right?\n\n638\n00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.620\nSo, technically, that is going to be\nX Windows, and it doesn't say it.\n\n639\n00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.230\nBut it's going to combine GNOME with it.\n\n640\n00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:32.040\nGNOME is going to be our window manager\nby default if we do that install.\n\n641\n00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.710\nNow, I could stop here,\n\n642\n00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.740\nbut there is a couple little\ncaveats we need to be aware of.\n\n643\n00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.190\nFirst off, fonts.\n\n644\n00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.370\nLinux has fonts built in.\n\n645\n00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.224\nAnd a lot of the fonts are very nice and\nperfectly serviceable.\n\n646\n00:32:44.224 --> 00:32:48.307\nBut in the GUI world oftentimes\nthere are different fonts.\n\n647\n00:32:48.307 --> 00:32:51.748\nAnd if we just install X Windows it's\ngonna have our native font library and\n\n648\n00:32:51.748 --> 00:32:54.080\nyou might have programs\nthat don't match up.\n\n649\n00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.930\nIf you start seeing weird characters\nlike little squares, black marks.\n\n650\n00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.539\nThings like that on the screen and\nyou can't read anything,\n\n651\n00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:03.057\nthat usually means you're\nmissing some font libraries.\n\n652\n00:33:03.057 --> 00:33:08.190\nSo we typically want to add\nthe fonts option to the end of it.\n\n653\n00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.695\nAll right,\nthat's another group that we can install.\n\n654\n00:33:11.695 --> 00:33:16.095\nNow if we stop here, if that's all I\ninstall, I'm gonna get X Windows, and\n\n655\n00:33:16.095 --> 00:33:17.485\nit's not gonna be very pretty.\n\n656\n00:33:17.485 --> 00:33:20.135\nIt's just gonna be straight\nup X Windows and that's it.\n\n657\n00:33:20.135 --> 00:33:24.105\nSo we normally want to couple that with\nour desktop and applications and so\n\n658\n00:33:24.105 --> 00:33:27.895\nI'm gonna add that group also,\nthe desktop group.\n\n659\n00:33:28.935 --> 00:33:33.570\nI did a basic install which is really\nthe server install, not much of a GUI.\n\n660\n00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.100\nIf I leave it at the X Window system\nthat'll be the minimal GUI option.\n\n661\n00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:42.260\nIf I do desktop now I'll get\na full featured GNOME desktop.\n\n662\n00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.850\nSo I'll go ahead and run that.\n\n663\n00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.835\nAnd it's gonna reach out and\ninstall those groups.\n\n664\n00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:50.042\nOkay, now when that's done, well,\n\n665\n00:33:50.042 --> 00:33:54.766\nfirst off you'll notice there's one or\ntwo packages.\n\n666\n00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:58.630\n309 packages, which sounds like a lot,\nthe download size is only 151 Meg.\n\n667\n00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.150\nSo we're not talking about giant stuff.\n\n668\n00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.780\nUnpacked on the hard drive it's\nabout 500 Megs to get this GUI.\n\n669\n00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.220\nSo it's gonna reach out there and\nget it and turn them on.\n\n670\n00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.290\nThese are packages ranging\nfrom all sorts of things.\n\n671\n00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:13.360\nVideo card drivers,\nconfiguration files, different fonts,\n\n672\n00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.330\ndifferent language and localization files.\n\n673\n00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.040\nA lot of graphics libraries.\n\n674\n00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.550\nLibraries for drawing buttons and\nimages on your screen and\n\n675\n00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.500\nall the GUI stuff that we need.\n\n676\n00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.590\nAll of that is being\nrepresented here as a package.\n\n677\n00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.070\nSo we'll let it churn along.\n\n678\n00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:33.000\nSome of these I recognize,\nthe control center, that's part of,\n\n679\n00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.490\nkind like our administrative tools for\nmanaging the system.\n\n680\n00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:38.320\nSome of these I'm not\nreally familiar with.\n\n681\n00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.600\nFestival, Festival's apparently some\nkind of speech tools that it's got.\n\n682\n00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.438\nThere's GDM, the GNOME desktop manager.\n\n683\n00:34:45.438 --> 00:34:48.720\nThat's gonna be pivotal to\nactually getting our desktop\n\n684\n00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.780\nvisible to where we can see it.\n\n685\n00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.420\nThat's what's gonna launch our window\nmanager and empower that for us.\n\n686\n00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.640\nThere's the GNOME desktop.\n\n687\n00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.570\nActually going right there.\n\n688\n00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.530\nAnd you'll see,\nthat's a pretty big chunk of our download.\n\n689\n00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.770\nIt's taking a moment.\n\n690\n00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.918\nAnd then it's moving through and\ngetting some of the other things.\n\n691\n00:35:03.918 --> 00:35:08.950\nSo while I didn't specifically say GNOME\nin the groups that I chose to install,\n\n692\n00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.690\nGnome is the default desktop, and so that\nis what it's bringing in and setting up.\n\n693\n00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.060\nSo it's gonna do all those.\n\n694\n00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.810\n&gt;&gt; So Don, these group installs,\n\n695\n00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:22.800\nin the quotes there you specified\nX Windows system, and desktop and fonts.\n\n696\n00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.950\nThese are groups then of packages.\n\n697\n00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\ninstead of specifying all 309.\n\n698\n00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.330\n&gt;&gt; We could have done that.\n\n699\n00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:32.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You still get the same thing.\n\n700\n00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.350\nSo then, I guess,\nwhere do you find these groups or\n\n701\n00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.410\nI guess these packages\nare all bundled together.\n\n702\n00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.080\nIs there a list or something?\n\n703\n00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.790\n&gt;&gt; We saw it in one of the earlier\nepisodes, I don't think you were in,\n\n704\n00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.090\nwhich was the yum group list command.\n\n705\n00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.670\nAnd then that will give you a list\nof the groups that are available and\n\n706\n00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.510\nIn the exam objectives, I think\nthey mention like five of them, and\n\n707\n00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:55.400\nin the install you see like seven I think.\n\n708\n00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.670\nBut then when you do yum group list, you\nsee that there's like 30 of them there,\n\n709\n00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:59.260\nthere's a bunch.\n\n710\n00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.800\nSo yeah that's how you see them.\n\n711\n00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay, a little behind the curve then.\n\n712\n00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.676\n&gt;&gt; Well, not paying attention,\nit's your style.\n\n713\n00:36:04.676 --> 00:36:06.092\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n714\n00:36:06.092 --> 00:36:08.310\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it's installing,\n\n715\n00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.800\nnow while it's installing.\n\n716\n00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.940\nWe are installing GNOME and X Windows.\n\n717\n00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.950\nNow we could stop right there and\nwe have GNOME.\n\n718\n00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.640\nBut I mentioned we could install\nmultiple desktop managers if we wanted.\n\n719\n00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.820\nI mean not desktop, well you can.\n\n720\n00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.720\nBut you can install multiple\nwindow managers if we want.\n\n721\n00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.640\nSo I could have Gnome and KDE and Xfce so\n\n722\n00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.840\nwe could have several of\nthese if we really wanted.\n\n723\n00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.520\nAnd so\nthat's what I want to show you guys.\n\n724\n00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.210\nI want to show you guys how we can get\nmore than one of those in place, too.\n\n725\n00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.340\nBut before I do all that,\nwe'll see this working in an action first.\n\n726\n00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.760\nThere it goes doing xorg and notice\nthe drivers, you can see some of them that\n\n727\n00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.850\nare going across there vmware,\nand I think I saw ATI in there.\n\n728\n00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.110\nSo you'll see a couple of those drivers\ncoming through as it gets them ready.\n\n729\n00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:55.160\nAll these are important packages, you\nknow, and most of them aren't very big.\n\n730\n00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.460\nNautilus, Nautilus is the file\nmanager inside of GNOME.\n\n731\n00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.100\nSo, when you're browsing\nthrough your folders and\n\n732\n00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.540\nstuff that's actually Nautilus that\nyou're using and then other stuff.\n\n733\n00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.090\nNothing too terribly\nexciting on this screen,\n\n734\n00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.599\norca, we're gonna be talking\nabout orca a little bit later.\n\n735\n00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:12.440\nThat's a screen reader for\naccessibility options.\n\n736\n00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.740\nSo, those are getting installed.\n\n737\n00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.630\nPulse audio, that's the audio player,\neverything that's responsible for\n\n738\n00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:21.520\nsounds inside of X Windows and\nseveral of the other ones.\n\n739\n00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.330\nGok, that's the on-screen keyboard.\n\n740\n00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:24.410\nWe're gonna talk about it later, too.\n\n741\n00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:30.370\nWhich used to be an accessibility option\njust for people who needed that, but\n\n742\n00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.980\nnow it's used on tablets a lot.\n\n743\n00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:37.280\nYou might have a tablet with no keyboard,\nso the onscreen keyboard is necessary.\n\n744\n00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.320\n&gt;&gt; Scrolling up there,\nI see Wacom express keys scroll up there.\n\n745\n00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.418\nI guess as far as drivers and things,\nit's not like reading your hardware and\n\n746\n00:37:46.418 --> 00:37:51.141\npulling only what it needs, but\njust everything within that package.\n\n747\n00:37:51.141 --> 00:37:56.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is a little bit\nwasteful I guess, in that sense.\n\n748\n00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.225\nI can see it just installed\nthe Thai scalable fonts, right?\n\n749\n00:38:00.225 --> 00:38:03.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not running a Thai localization so\n\n750\n00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.960\nI don't really need that.\n\n751\n00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.010\nThat is a negative of using\nsome of these packages.\n\n752\n00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.600\nAnd we can always go and remove the\nindividual ones if we don't need them, but\n\n753\n00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.340\nit does do a little overkill.\n\n754\n00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.870\nSo, it should almost be done.\n\n755\n00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:14.780\nYeah, there it goes verifying.\n\n756\n00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.330\nAnd now, I have a GUI.\n\n757\n00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:18.090\nIt's wonderful isn't it?\n\n758\n00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.290\nIt's so easy to navigate.\n\n759\n00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.760\nSo, here's the thing.\n\n760\n00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.920\nI did a basic install and so\nit's expecting a command line interface.\n\n761\n00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.120\nJust because I installed a GUI\ndoesn't mean it's going to use it.\n\n762\n00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.480\nIt's got it, I could fire it up.\n\n763\n00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.210\nWell, we are going to\nsee some weird things.\n\n764\n00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.760\nX Windows is installed.\n\n765\n00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.300\nAnd I could fire it up if I wanted.\n\n766\n00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.910\nNow I am logged in as root,and so\nI really shouldn't fire it up directly.\n\n767\n00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.420\nI guess I could,\nit wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\n768\n00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.249\nBut I if I try, well here,\nlet's see, I'll see if it complains.\n\n769\n00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.480\nX windows has a very simple\nexecutable called X.\n\n770\n00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.310\nNow you're not suppose to run directly.\n\n771\n00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:59.230\nI'm going to, just to see what it does,\nand let's see if it actually works for me.\n\n772\n00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:03.330\nCuz when you run it directly like that,\nwhen you just run X, it doesn't have any\n\n773\n00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:06.690\nconfig files to load and so\nit usually freaks out and does this.\n\n774\n00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.730\nHm, I get a nice black screen.\n\n775\n00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.000\nIt's not a black mouse,\n\n776\n00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.730\non a black background, with black windows-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n777\n00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.420\n&gt;&gt; It's just a completely black screen.\n\n778\n00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.180\nAnd that's because X needs config files.\n\n779\n00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:21.420\nIt needs various things to get it set\nto be able to display what we want.\n\n780\n00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.675\nAnd had I thought about this more.\n\n781\n00:39:24.675 --> 00:39:28.596\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Normally what you hit is Ctrl + Alt +\n\n782\n00:39:28.596 --> 00:39:29.108\nBackspace.\n\n783\n00:39:29.108 --> 00:39:33.200\nCtrl + Alt + Backspace is a nice little\nshortcut that closes X Windows and\n\n784\n00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.640\ngets you out of it.\n\n785\n00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:42.820\nBut I am in VMware and it is\nintercepting my little command there.\n\n786\n00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.662\nSo I'm gonna have to go\na little more aggressive.\n\n787\n00:39:45.662 --> 00:39:46.491\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n788\n00:39:46.491 --> 00:39:52.043\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, yeah,\nI'm gonna have to force it to reboot.\n\n789\n00:39:52.043 --> 00:39:54.409\nSo normally what you would\ndo on a standard PC is,\n\n790\n00:39:54.409 --> 00:39:56.544\nif you launch it like that and\nit freaks out,\n\n791\n00:39:56.544 --> 00:40:00.055\nCtrl+Alt+Backspace is one of the keys\nthat'll get you out of there.\n\n792\n00:40:00.055 --> 00:40:03.929\nCtrl+Alt+X is another one\nthat can get you out.\n\n793\n00:40:03.929 --> 00:40:08.330\nLet me try that one, Ctrl+Alt+X,\neh, it's not getting me out.\n\n794\n00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.780\nA lot of my keyboard shortcuts\nare being intercepted and not working.\n\n795\n00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:17.690\nSo let me force this one to reboot and\nthen I'll be able to read.\n\n796\n00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.650\nNow when I reboot,\nactually it's kind of a good point here.\n\n797\n00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:26.180\nWhen I reboot, we're gonna see that it's\nnot going to come back up into a GUI,\n\n798\n00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.530\nor at least I don't think it will.\n\n799\n00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:32.050\nAnd when it comes back up,\nit'll come back up into the CLI, and\n\n800\n00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.300\nthat'll give us a chance to go in and\nkinda fix the problem.\n\n801\n00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.290\nSo I can see right there it's going\ndown for a reboot, and it'll fix itself.\n\n802\n00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.599\n&gt;&gt; So if, all right, so let's say\nthat X Window launched normally you\n\n803\n00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:43.457\nknow-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n804\n00:40:43.457 --> 00:40:47.464\n&gt;&gt; And it wasn't stuck with those keyboard\nshortcuts still close it even though it's\n\n805\n00:40:47.464 --> 00:40:47.988\nnot safe?\n\n806\n00:40:47.988 --> 00:40:51.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are standard shortcuts and\nthey're there just for that scenario.\n\n807\n00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.270\nHere there's a couple of situations where\nyou might have it where you can't see\n\n808\n00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:54.850\nyour screen.\n\n809\n00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:55.870\nThis used to be a problem.\n\n810\n00:40:55.870 --> 00:41:00.300\nI installed X Windows the first time\nback in the 90's and it was a nightmare.\n\n811\n00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.880\nIt was super hard to get your video card\nsupported and your display supported.\n\n812\n00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.500\nYou had to know all sorts of information\nabout your monitor that the vendors didn't\n\n813\n00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.400\nnormally tell you.\n\n814\n00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.980\nYou had to know your vertical and\nhorizontal refresh rates and\n\n815\n00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.710\nstuff like that.\n\n816\n00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.540\nAnd you're lucky if you\ncan get that information.\n\n817\n00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.830\nSo that was always a real challenge.\n\n818\n00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:23.710\nIt's become so much easier these days and\nwe can see mine's recovering.\n\n819\n00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.474\nSo mine is noticing here\nthat I installed the GUI but\n\n820\n00:41:26.474 --> 00:41:31.300\nI've never gone into it before and so it's\ngiving me this text mode set up utility\n\n821\n00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.820\nAnd you'll see this if something\nwent wrong typically, or\n\n822\n00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.020\nthe first time you reboot\nafter installing the GUI.\n\n823\n00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.950\nI don't actually need any of this stuff so\nI'm just gonna quit out.\n\n824\n00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:46.758\nAnd it will put me back\nto my command prompt.\n\n825\n00:41:46.758 --> 00:41:47.640\nThere we go.\n\n826\n00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:52.250\nSo, no GUI, still just the command\nline interface and I logged in as me.\n\n827\n00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:56.428\nBut, if I switch over to route here,\nI'll see no GUI there either, okay.\n\n828\n00:41:56.428 --> 00:41:59.147\nNow, I mentioned when I\nsupposed to run X directly and\n\n829\n00:41:59.147 --> 00:42:01.310\nthen I did it anyway just to show you.\n\n830\n00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.700\nWhat we're supposed to run is startx.\n\n831\n00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:10.230\nstartx is actually a script that runs,\nand it prepares X Windows.\n\n832\n00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:13.630\nIt gives it information about your\nmonitor, about your video card, and\n\n833\n00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.700\nthis was a huge advancement\nover the old way.\n\n834\n00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.540\nIt used to be, I used to dread it.\n\n835\n00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:22.150\nI used to dread setting up X Windows on a\nnew system cuz of all the stuff you had to\n\n836\n00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.480\ndo to get supported.\n\n837\n00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.650\nBut today is a new world, right.\n\n838\n00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.200\nI can't remember the last time\nI had a problem with X windows.\n\n839\n00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.880\nNormally they just fire up and\nit works right out of the box.\n\n840\n00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.702\nIt's really cool but\nI still remember those keyboard shortcuts.\n\n841\n00:42:34.702 --> 00:42:37.620\nCtrl+Alt+Backspace, Ctrl+Alt+X and\n\n842\n00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:42.600\nthe other ones are control,\nwe use Ctrl +Alt+Plus and Ctrl+Alt+Minus.\n\n843\n00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.990\nIf it comes up in a resolution that's\nnot supported in your monitor, plus or\n\n844\n00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.970\nminus will move you to higher\nresolution and lower resolutions so\n\n845\n00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.570\nyou can do it without having\naccess to control panel.\n\n846\n00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.880\nCuz you might not be able to do\nthat if you can't see your screen,\n\n847\n00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.360\nif your screen's all garbled up.\n\n848\n00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.510\nSo those are some nice little short cuts\nwe can use to try and fix it, all right.\n\n849\n00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.910\nNow if I run startx right now,\n\n850\n00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:03.800\nit's gonna be a little angry\nwith me because I'm root.\n\n851\n00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.280\nAnd root really shouldn't be running\na GUI and so here we get that message.\n\n852\n00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.330\nYou are currently trying to\nrun as the root super user,\n\n853\n00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:15.140\nit's a specialized account, and\nnot designed for normal operation.\n\n854\n00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.390\nYou shouldn't be using it.\n\n855\n00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:18.400\nOkay, but I went ahead and\n\n856\n00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.220\nlaunched it this way just to\nmake sure that it was cool.\n\n857\n00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.220\nAnd I can see that there's my GUI.\n\n858\n00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.660\nIt is functional.\n\n859\n00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.210\nIt is there, all right?\n\n860\n00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:30.840\nSo huge difference between running the X\nbinary directly versus running startx.\n\n861\n00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.860\nstartx actually gathered information\nabout my system, including what\n\n862\n00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.260\nvideo card driver I can use, which is a\npretty handy piece of information to have.\n\n863\n00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.370\n&gt;&gt; Mm, so don't know it.\n\n864\n00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.240\nNow you mentioned that to run this,\n\n865\n00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:46.670\nwe would need some config files\nto be typed up or whatnot.\n\n866\n00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.520\nSo, we're running it, but\nyet, no config files.\n\n867\n00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.290\n&gt;&gt; So, it generated them for us, right?\n\n868\n00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.600\nThat's the cool thing.\n\n869\n00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.300\nYeah, and if we wanna see them, we can.\n\n870\n00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.470\nLet me get out of here.\n\n871\n00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.790\nNow this is going to be a little weird.\n\n872\n00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:02.430\nWe didn't start the GUI at boot time,\nso when I go here to like system and\n\n873\n00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:06.790\nshut down this will actually shutdown,\nwell here watch.\n\n874\n00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.735\nIf I choose shutdown, if we take it\nit's going to shut down the X server.\n\n875\n00:44:10.735 --> 00:44:13.075\nSo there it goes shutting\ndown the X server.\n\n876\n00:44:13.075 --> 00:44:17.395\nAnd it's not actually gonna shut down\nmy system or at least it shouldn't.\n\n877\n00:44:17.395 --> 00:44:19.047\nAnd it will drop me back to a prompt.\n\n878\n00:44:19.047 --> 00:44:21.282\nIt did actually shut my system down,\ngod damn it.\n\n879\n00:44:21.282 --> 00:44:25.162\nSo normally it won't actually shut the\nsystem down because I launched it after\n\n880\n00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:25.832\nI was logged in.\n\n881\n00:44:25.832 --> 00:44:28.832\nA lot of times it'll drop you back to\nthe prompt but it didn't in my case.\n\n882\n00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.137\n&gt;&gt; So it would be like\nshutting down its own process.\n\n883\n00:44:31.137 --> 00:44:33.478\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\nthat's what you'll typically see.\n\n884\n00:44:33.478 --> 00:44:34.970\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n885\n00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:36.980\n&gt;&gt; All right but\nyou mentioned those config files.\n\n886\n00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.248\nSo we didn't create them,\nstartx created them for us.\n\n887\n00:44:40.248 --> 00:44:42.170\nIt saw that this was the first\ntime that we launch and\n\n888\n00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:45.190\nhad built the files that we needed and\nput them in place.\n\n889\n00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:48.625\nAnd we can see them, there's spread\nout in a few different places.\n\n890\n00:44:48.625 --> 00:44:52.515\nIf your system just happened\nto be super lucky and\n\n891\n00:44:52.515 --> 00:44:55.095\nmatch like every default\nsetting possible and\n\n892\n00:44:55.095 --> 00:44:59.290\nnothing had to be change it is possible\nthat it didn't create the files.\n\n893\n00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:01.160\nBut it's pretty rare, right?\n\n894\n00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.330\nSo normally we can see where it's\ncreated files in a few different places.\n\n895\n00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.640\nIn etc we should have a folder in there\ncalled error folder in there called X11,\n\n896\n00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.020\nand I can see it right there,\nand if I go into X11.\n\n897\n00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.848\nI'll see that I've got some files in here.\n\n898\n00:45:16.848 --> 00:45:20.952\nThe most important one being\nthat directory right there,\n\n899\n00:45:20.952 --> 00:45:23.060\nxorg.conf.d, all right?\n\n900\n00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:30.000\nAnd if we go into that and\ntake a look, mine is empty.\n\n901\n00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.700\nI guess cuz I'm in a virtual machine so\n\n902\n00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:36.740\nmaybe I didn't meet all of the\nrequirements, but we'll see in a minimum\n\n903\n00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.500\nof file called prefdm which is\nthe preferred desktop manager.\n\n904\n00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.960\nAnd the desktop manager is\nwhat's launching X Windows and\n\n905\n00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.510\ngetting the configs in place,\nand I can see I do have that one.\n\n906\n00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.790\nAnd so we can see it right there.\n\n907\n00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.933\nThere's just a simple little script that\nruns when we go to launch X Windows.\n\n908\n00:45:54.933 --> 00:45:59.904\nSets the path, goes out and finds out\nwhich Window manager we're gonna be using,\n\n909\n00:45:59.904 --> 00:46:03.260\nor display manager so\nyou got GNOME, KDE, WDM, XDM.\n\n910\n00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.480\nA few of the different display\nmanagers that it can pick from.\n\n911\n00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.780\nBased on whatever desktop\nwe're going to be using.\n\n912\n00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.370\nEven though I don't have KDE installed,\n\n913\n00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.920\nit's got that little\nentry in there to say,\n\n914\n00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.700\nif we do install KDE, we can switch that\ndesktop manager if we wanted, all right?\n\n915\n00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.810\nAnd then here's where you'll start to\nsee information about it executing.\n\n916\n00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:26.700\nSo, it's actually running GDM, the GNOME\ndesktop manager, and calling the services.\n\n917\n00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.940\nYou'll see a whole lot\nof information in here.\n\n918\n00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.990\nSome of it I guess a little\nbit cryptic [LAUGH] as it\n\n919\n00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:33.930\nhandles it's redirections or whatever.\n\n920\n00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.836\nBut we'll see that\ninformation right in there.\n\n921\n00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:38.596\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n922\n00:46:38.596 --> 00:46:42.296\n&gt;&gt; So that's a key one to go and check\nout, make sure that your display manager\n\n923\n00:46:42.296 --> 00:46:46.070\nis entered in there and\nthat you've got the information you need.\n\n924\n00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.860\nYou know,\nI do feel like I'm missing something.\n\n925\n00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.390\nLet's see, sysconfig.\n\n926\n00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:58.110\nIf we go into /etc/sysconfig\nyou may also have\n\n927\n00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:04.870\na file in here called desktop and,\nlet's see, I apparently don't have one.\n\n928\n00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:11.060\nBut, desktop is another file so\nit would be /etc/sysconfig/desktop.\n\n929\n00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.370\nAnd, that's a great place\nto put in overrides,\n\n930\n00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:16.980\nif you wanna override\nthe behavior of X Windows or\n\n931\n00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:22.000\nanything like that, it's a config file\nthat is specifically for that purpose.\n\n932\n00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.386\nSo, I don't think I have any examples\nof what we would do there but\n\n933\n00:47:25.386 --> 00:47:32.860\nyou'll see various people, it seems like I\nmade an example If I wanted to force it.\n\n934\n00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:38.370\nSo maybe I've installed KDE but I wanna\nforce it to use GDM all the time, right?\n\n935\n00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:41.480\nSo, use the GNOME display\nmanager to fire up and\n\n936\n00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.560\nthen people can choose to go KDE and\nit'll switch them over to KDE fine.\n\n937\n00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.820\nBut GDM is the one that's\ngonna run under the hood.\n\n938\n00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.140\nIf I want to force that,\nI could put that right into display.\n\n939\n00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:56.149\nSo I could just do vi ./display, and\nI could put in some entries in here.\n\n940\n00:47:56.149 --> 00:48:00.462\nI could say, DESKTOP=,\n\n941\n00:48:00.462 --> 00:48:06.742\nlet's do Gnome, got to do my quotes.\n\n942\n00:48:06.742 --> 00:48:11.099\nSo I'll say DESKTOP = \"Gnome\", and\n\n943\n00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:16.020\nthen I'll say DISPLAYMANAGER=\"GDM\".\n\n944\n00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.260\nAll right so by a hard setting that\nlike that, hard setting the desk top and\n\n945\n00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.430\nhard setting the display manager,\nnow people aren't gonna have the choice.\n\n946\n00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.360\nEven if I install a KDM or\n\n947\n00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.920\nI mean KDE, it's still going\nto use GDM and Gnome right?\n\n948\n00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.970\nSo they're always gonna\nget that one desktop.\n\n949\n00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.080\nThat's useful if you have\nmore than one root user, and\n\n950\n00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.610\nyou want to prevent people\nfrom switching desktops.\n\n951\n00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:39.210\nIf they're a root user,\nthey're gonna do what they want anyway.\n\n952\n00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:40.920\nBut you can at least annoy them.\n\n953\n00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.340\nSo there's that,\nwe can hard set these things.\n\n954\n00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.395\nOtherwise, the system just detects it,\nand that's what we normally want, so\n\n955\n00:48:46.395 --> 00:48:48.485\nthat's like what I would want.\n\n956\n00:48:48.485 --> 00:48:53.135\n&gt;&gt; So then if you have multiple like\nKDE and Gnome installed on there,\n\n957\n00:48:53.135 --> 00:48:57.035\nis there a menu to switch between\nthe two like grub or something?\n\n958\n00:48:57.035 --> 00:48:58.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me show you that.\n\n959\n00:48:58.085 --> 00:49:02.670\nRight, so right now, actually, before\nI do that, let me do one more thing.\n\n960\n00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:06.830\nWhen I reboot right now, it took me\nto the command line interface, and\n\n961\n00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:10.060\nthat's because I haven't told\nthe system we've got a GUI.\n\n962\n00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:13.140\nRemember from an earlier episode,\nwe talked about run levels and\n\n963\n00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:18.360\nhow in CentOS run level 3 is full\nmulti-user with a text based interface and\n\n964\n00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:25.280\nrun level five was a full multi-user run\nlevel with a graphical user interface.\n\n965\n00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.660\nI need to tell my system to start in\nrun level 5 every time it boots now so\n\n966\n00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.170\nit knows to go to the GUI.\n\n967\n00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:35.670\nOtherwise I'm gonna have to launch X\nmyself every time and that gets annoying.\n\n968\n00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:39.210\nSo let's make that change real quick and\nthen I'll show you how to install.\n\n969\n00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:41.410\nWe'll install multiple window managers and\n\n970\n00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:45.220\nI'll show you that menu where people\ncould pick, it's pretty cool.\n\n971\n00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.970\nSo the first thing I need to do is,\nif I wanna fix the boot up to\n\n972\n00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:55.170\nGUI is I need to modify my\ninitialization table, my inittab.\n\n973\n00:49:55.170 --> 00:50:00.368\nSo I'm gonna edit /etc/inittab.\n\n974\n00:50:00.368 --> 00:50:03.750\nAnd we looked at this one\nin an earlier episode.\n\n975\n00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:07.540\nAnd see down there at the bottom,\nit's set to boot up into run level 3.\n\n976\n00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.640\nAnd run level 3 is a text based interface,\nright?\n\n977\n00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.480\nSo I'm going to just mark that one out.\n\n978\n00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.020\nOr comment it out.\n\n979\n00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:19.522\nAnd add my own line that says, there.\n\n980\n00:50:19.522 --> 00:50:20.842\nid:5:initdefault:.\n\n981\n00:50:20.842 --> 00:50:24.115\nI could have just changed the 3 to a 5 but\n\n982\n00:50:24.115 --> 00:50:30.110\nI always like to leave the default\nthere so I can remember what it was.\n\n983\n00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.530\nWhat was that default?\n\n984\n00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.960\nWell, now I've got it right there.\n\n985\n00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.910\nSo now I'm telling when it boots up\nto boot up into X Windows, right.\n\n986\n00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:41.380\nBoot into Xorg and\nactually give me a GUI, all right.\n\n987\n00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.830\nSo I'll save that.\n\n988\n00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:44.850\nNow, we installed Gnome.\n\n989\n00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:47.150\nWe installed the font packages.\n\n990\n00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.680\nWe installed the desktop applications.\n\n991\n00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.400\nSo what if I want other window managers?\n\n992\n00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.050\nI can add them, right.\n\n993\n00:50:53.050 --> 00:51:01.220\nSo I can do yum\ngroupinstall \"KDE Desktop\".\n\n994\n00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.290\nIs that lower case D, let's find out.\n\n995\n00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.910\nI can't remember if it's a capital or\nlower case D in the group name.\n\n996\n00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:06.510\nIt might not matter.\n\n997\n00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.786\nLet's see if it comes back, that was it.\n\n998\n00:51:10.786 --> 00:51:16.515\nOkay so here's KDE, a quick 120 packages,\nthis ones a little bit on the big side.\n\n999\n00:51:16.515 --> 00:51:18.472\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ninstall KDE and get that one in.\n\n1000\n00:51:18.472 --> 00:51:20.722\nNow I'm using CentOS.\n\n1001\n00:51:20.722 --> 00:51:24.807\nAnd the guys at Red Hat, you know,\nCentOS is based on Red Hat.\n\n1002\n00:51:24.807 --> 00:51:28.348\nThey've chose to support Gnome,\nand KDE, and that's it.\n\n1003\n00:51:28.348 --> 00:51:33.690\nSo, those are the two Window managers\nthat are a part of that distribution.\n\n1004\n00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.740\nSo, if I want one of those, great.\n\n1005\n00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.300\nThat'll work fine, I can run with it.\n\n1006\n00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.840\nBut, if I want a different window manager,\nwell.\n\n1007\n00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.480\nI'm not out of luck, I can do it.\n\n1008\n00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.310\nIt's just not gonna be easy as this.\n\n1009\n00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.820\nI can't just go and\npull right out of their repositories.\n\n1010\n00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.940\n'Cuz it's missing the files that I want.\n\n1011\n00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.670\nSo, while that's installing,\nI'm gonna jump over to.\n\n1012\n00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:54.670\nNo, the day is gonna be like.\n\n1013\n00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:55.190\nIt won't let me do it.\n\n1014\n00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.808\nI was gonna say, I was gonna go and\ninstall it in another window.\n\n1015\n00:51:57.808 --> 00:52:00.340\nI guess I can do some of\nthe prep work in another window.\n\n1016\n00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:07.680\nLet me jump over to one of my other TTYs,\nand we'll do some of the prep work, right?\n\n1017\n00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.390\nIf I wanna install Xfce, I mentioned\nthat's one of my favorites, well,\n\n1018\n00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:13.490\nRed Hat chose not to\nsupport that one anymore.\n\n1019\n00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:15.020\nI'm very sad about that.\n\n1020\n00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.250\nBut we can still get it through\na third party repository.\n\n1021\n00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:22.980\nThere is the E-P-E-L or EPEL repository.\n\n1022\n00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:28.807\nIt's a collection of ports for Enterprise\nLinux that, for Red Head Enterprise Linux,\n\n1023\n00:52:28.807 --> 00:52:33.450\nthat Red Hat has chosen not to support but\nthe Open source community has\n\n1024\n00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:38.190\nchosen TO support and Xfce is in there and\nI can pull it from there.\n\n1025\n00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:43.100\nSo, if I wanna do Xfce,\nI need to add that repository first.\n\n1026\n00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.380\nLet me see if I have wget.\n\n1027\n00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:45.400\nI do.\nAll right, so\n\n1028\n00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.430\nI'm gonna install that repository\nreal quick on my system.\n\n1029\n00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:51.620\nAnd I'll post how to do this with the show\nnotes if any of you guys feel like doing\n\n1030\n00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:56.380\nit, but\nI'm just gonna get that one in here.\n\n1031\n00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:01.294\nIt's actually a part of Fedora, so\nit's not in their mainstream OS,\n\n1032\n00:53:01.294 --> 00:53:06.056\nbut it is in their research OS in Fedora,\nso I'll get it from there.\n\n1033\n00:53:06.056 --> 00:53:07.681\nEPEL.\n\n1034\n00:53:07.681 --> 00:53:08.722\nI don't have this memorized,\n\n1035\n00:53:08.722 --> 00:53:10.795\nI actually have it written on\na piece of paper here beside me.\n\n1036\n00:53:10.795 --> 00:53:13.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That helps out a little bit.\n\n1037\n00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.810\nSometimes, people assume I\nhave this stuff memorized.\n\n1038\n00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:18.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're like, man,\nDon, you're pretty hardcore.\n\n1039\n00:53:18.875 --> 00:53:22.405\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not as smart as you might think.\n\n1040\n00:53:22.405 --> 00:53:24.306\n[LAUGH] All Right, so.\n\n1041\n00:53:27.514 --> 00:53:28.750\nAnd there we go, okay.\n\n1042\n00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:32.480\nSo I just reached down and downloaded\nan RPM package and this is not Xfce.\n\n1043\n00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.320\nThis is adding this extra repository,\nso I just got the RPM for that.\n\n1044\n00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.713\nAnd I'm gonna install it real quick, so\n\n1045\n00:53:40.713 --> 00:53:45.764\nI'm doing a,\nan out of band package install.\n\n1046\n00:53:47.513 --> 00:53:49.222\nAll right.\n\n1047\n00:53:49.222 --> 00:53:53.235\nNow I can say, well, probably not\nwhile the other one's installing.\n\n1048\n00:53:53.235 --> 00:53:58.205\nBut now I can say yum groupinstall \"Xfce\"\nand, while that didn't exist before,\n\n1049\n00:53:58.205 --> 00:53:58.990\nnow it does.\n\n1050\n00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:02.150\nBecause that repository has it,\nand I'll be able to see it.\n\n1051\n00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:05.570\nLet me go see what the status\nis of my other install.\n\n1052\n00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:08.300\nIt is crawling along.\n\n1053\n00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:11.560\n&gt;&gt; Now you did say that\nKDE was a bit more,\n\n1054\n00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.360\nbit more heavier than with Gnome, correct?\n\n1055\n00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:15.500\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n1056\n00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.505\n&gt;&gt; A bit more involved?\n\n1057\n00:54:16.505 --> 00:54:18.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, why don't we do this?\n\n1058\n00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:23.450\nWe're just kinda waiting on it,\nwe could stop here and\n\n1059\n00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:27.390\ntake a break and then when we get back,\nhopefully that'll be done.\n\n1060\n00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:31.040\nI'll install the Xfce after that.\n\n1061\n00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.470\nIt seems to be stalled.\n\n1062\n00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.750\nNo, it's copying along.\n\n1063\n00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:38.800\nIt's got an eta of 361 minutes,\nthat's not, that's not awesome.\n\n1064\n00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.498\nSo it's the KDE games package,\nwhich I care about.\n\n1065\n00:54:41.498 --> 00:54:42.482\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n1066\n00:54:42.482 --> 00:54:45.280\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah,\nwe might have a problem there.\n\n1067\n00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n1068\n00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.931\nSo, it comes like chocked full of games,\ntoo?\n\n1069\n00:54:48.931 --> 00:54:51.470\n&gt;&gt; It's copying at a blazing\n2 kilobytes per second..\n\n1070\n00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:55.681\nThat's awesome.\n\n1071\n00:54:55.681 --> 00:54:57.264\nIt's like I'm downloading on a modem here.\n\n1072\n00:54:57.264 --> 00:55:00.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Great, all right, well, let's do this.\n\n1073\n00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:02.265\nLet's stop and take a break.\n\n1074\n00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:04.910\nWhen we get back, hopefully this\nwill be finished installing.\n\n1075\n00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:10.120\nI'll add Xfce and when that's done,\nwe'll reboot, we'll come up in our GUI and\n\n1076\n00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:14.120\nwe'll see a menu where we can\npick between the different GUIs.\n\n1077\n00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.190\nIt'll be awesome.\n\n1078\n00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:16.230\n&gt;&gt; Can't wait.\n\n1079\n00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.230\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned.\n\n1080\n00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:18.222\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1081\n00:55:18.222 --> 00:55:22.597\n[MUSIC]\n\n1082\n00:55:22.597 --> 00:55:25.972\n[NOISE] All right.\n\n1083\n00:55:25.972 --> 00:55:27.430\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1084\n00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:30.490\nSo during the break,\nit finished installing KDE.\n\n1085\n00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:32.210\nI had to use a little trick.\n\n1086\n00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.880\nWhich is,\nif you ever have an install that stalls.\n\n1087\n00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.310\nOurs was going at two kilobytes\nper second, which is ridiculous.\n\n1088\n00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:43.550\nYou can hit CTRL+C once and\nit'll abandon the download and restart it.\n\n1089\n00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:47.108\nAnd so mine jumped to another mirror and\nthen downloaded nice and fast.\n\n1090\n00:55:47.108 --> 00:55:50.135\nIf you CTRL+C twice,\nit'll actually abort the install and\n\n1091\n00:55:50.135 --> 00:55:53.830\nroll back all the packages, so\nCTRL+C is kind of a handy shortcut there.\n\n1092\n00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:58.835\nBut at this point, we've installed\nGnome and now we've installed KDE, and\n\n1093\n00:55:58.835 --> 00:56:04.084\nI set the groundwork for installing Xfce,\nso that's the one I'm gonna add now.\n\n1094\n00:56:04.084 --> 00:56:08.087\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndo a group install for XFCE and so\n\n1095\n00:56:08.087 --> 00:56:12.290\nwhen I do that,\nit's gonna reach out and find that.\n\n1096\n00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:14.960\nIt wouldn't normally find\nthis because it's not\n\n1097\n00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.800\nin the Red Hat approved repository.\n\n1098\n00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.874\nBut it is in EPEL.\n\n1099\n00:56:19.874 --> 00:56:22.041\nIt is an additional\nrepository that I added.\n\n1100\n00:56:22.041 --> 00:56:26.430\nSo, now it find it and\nwe can install XFCE.\n\n1101\n00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:31.920\nNotice XFCE, a whopping 18 meg download,\n58 megs uncompressed.\n\n1102\n00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.980\nIt's all about performance and efficiency.\n\n1103\n00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.060\nIt's 10% the size of KDE, right?\n\n1104\n00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.190\nKDE was 580 megs for us, so.\n\n1105\n00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:42.417\nHuge difference there and\nit will install a whooping 28 packages.\n\n1106\n00:56:42.417 --> 00:56:46.370\nIt also helps that I have a bunch of\npackages already installed from the other\n\n1107\n00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:49.291\nWindow manager, so\nit's maybe not a fair comparison.\n\n1108\n00:56:49.291 --> 00:56:54.196\n&gt;&gt; So Don, when you installed Nona the\nfirst time, you also ran a fonts group,\n\n1109\n00:56:54.196 --> 00:56:57.580\nand then when you ran a KDE,\nyou did not run any font.\n\n1110\n00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.105\nSo it uses the same-\n&gt;&gt; They were already there, yeah.\n\n1111\n00:57:00.105 --> 00:57:02.490\nYeah, those fonts are a part of Exon 1 and\nI'm glad you mentioned that,\n\n1112\n00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:06.430\nNate, cuz I almost forgot XFCE it's old.\n\n1113\n00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:10.570\nIt's been around a while and it actually\nuses some slightly different font packs\n\n1114\n00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:13.020\nand so\nI do need to install a few fonts here.\n\n1115\n00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.880\nBut KDE, yeah, I didn't install\nthe fonts just cuzI already had.\n\n1116\n00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.480\nIf I hadn't, I would have done it,\nyeah, all right.\n\n1117\n00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:24.050\nSo, I am gonna add just a little\nbit more here for good old XFCE.\n\n1118\n00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:29.450\nI need to add the xorg -x11-fonts.\n\n1119\n00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.460\nI need to add the Type1 fonts.\n\n1120\n00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:38.832\nAnd I need to add the miscellaneous fonts.\n\n1121\n00:57:38.832 --> 00:57:40.207\nSo, let me just punch those in.\n\n1122\n00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:44.220\nAnd we'll get them,\nit looks like I already had one of them.\n\n1123\n00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:49.420\nYep, so it says that the Type1 fonts\nare already installed and at the latest\n\n1124\n00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.570\nversion, so it's a miscellaneous font for\nthe only one that I need.\n\n1125\n00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.323\nThat's one of the nice things\nabout dependency checks and yum,\n\n1126\n00:57:55.323 --> 00:57:57.832\nand aptget is they will check\nto see if you've already got it.\n\n1127\n00:57:57.832 --> 00:58:00.249\nSo, there we go.\n\n1128\n00:58:00.249 --> 00:58:04.680\nAll right, so now I've got KDE installed.\n\n1129\n00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.760\nI've got XFCE installed and\nI've got Gnome.\n\n1130\n00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:11.540\nMy default is gonna be Gnome cuz\nthat's what send OS defaults do.\n\n1131\n00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:13.270\nBut the users will actually get a choice.\n\n1132\n00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:15.040\nAnd that's what Nate was asking about.\n\n1133\n00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.040\nWhat kind of lead us to this in\nthe first place was, do they get a menu?\n\n1134\n00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.440\nCan they choose?\n\n1135\n00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.221\nI showed you how to force and how to\nuse one by modifying slash, etc, slash,\n\n1136\n00:58:24.221 --> 00:58:26.940\nwas it assist control, slash, desktop?\n\n1137\n00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.150\nAnd going in there and modifying it there.\n\n1138\n00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:33.860\nBut if we wanna give them the choice,\nit actually does that for us.\n\n1139\n00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.470\nIf I reboot.\n\n1140\n00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:35.819\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nreboot this machine.\n\n1141\n00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.120\nSo we'll reboot.\n\n1142\n00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:44.490\nWhen it reboots, we modify our inittab or\nour initialization table or inittab.\n\n1143\n00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:46.290\nSo, we modify that to say to boot up and\n\n1144\n00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:49.910\nto run level five,\nboot up with the GUI, okay?\n\n1145\n00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:53.420\nSo, when it boots,\nit's gonna know to launched a GUI.\n\n1146\n00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:56.622\nAnd it's gonna launch the GDM,\nthe Gnome Display Manager, and\n\n1147\n00:58:56.622 --> 00:58:58.790\nit's gonna give us a login screen.\n\n1148\n00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:01.330\nAnd on that login screen, we should,\n\n1149\n00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:04.780\nunless I mess something up, we should\nsee a little option at the bottom of our\n\n1150\n00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:08.200\nscreen that lets us pick\nwhich window manager we want.\n\n1151\n00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.710\nSo some of our users can\nrun one Window manager,\n\n1152\n00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.510\nwhile others run a different one, okay?\n\n1153\n00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:14.190\nSo here it is.\n\n1154\n00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:15.300\nI'm at my log-in screen.\n\n1155\n00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.320\nIt's listing the various\nusers that I can pick from,\n\n1156\n00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.720\nall the ones we've created in the show.\n\n1157\n00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.280\nSo I'll pick myself.\n\n1158\n00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.458\nAnd so here I go to log-in.\n\n1159\n00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:28.000\nNow, before I hit log-in, notice down\nhere at the bottom, it's set to Gnome.\n\n1160\n00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:34.500\nAnd I can choose from Gnome, KDE,\nor XFCE depending on what I want.\n\n1161\n00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:38.707\nAnd so I could pick KDE,\nand I could log in.\n\n1162\n00:59:38.707 --> 00:59:42.624\nAnd now I'm gonna get my KDE desktop\nagain unless I screwed something up.\n\n1163\n00:59:42.624 --> 00:59:45.140\n[LAUGH] There's always that possibility,\nright?\n\n1164\n00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:49.170\nThere we go.\nSo I've got a nice pretty Katie\n\n1165\n00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:56.750\nenvironment here, and I can come into\nmy own folder, and in my downloads.\n\n1166\n00:59:56.750 --> 01:00:02.640\nIf I create something on my desktop, so\nif I come in here and I create a new file.\n\n1167\n01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.380\nSo Don's passwords.\n\n1168\n01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.632\nThis is what I like to do,\n\n1169\n01:00:05.632 --> 01:00:09.013\nI save all my passwords just in\na text file right on my desktop.\n\n1170\n01:00:09.013 --> 01:00:10.207\n&gt;&gt; It's easy that way.\n\n1171\n01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:13.365\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, I wanna have\naccess to them quickly, right?\n\n1172\n01:00:13.365 --> 01:00:16.330\nSo here are all my passwords.\n\n1173\n01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:20.110\nAnd sometimes I back them up, so I just\ndo a copy the text file to a USB key and\n\n1174\n01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:20.945\nleave it on the desk.\n\n1175\n01:00:20.945 --> 01:00:23.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's my backup plan.\n\n1176\n01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:27.540\nSo any how, so I create that,\nit's right there, it's on my desktop, so\n\n1177\n01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.170\nI've got Don's passwords.\n\n1178\n01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:33.069\nAnd if I log out, so\nif I go to leave and I log out.\n\n1179\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.090\nI can log out of my system.\n\n1180\n01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.260\nI can attempt to log out of my system,\nthat didn't really get very far.\n\n1181\n01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.180\nThere we go, I'm being impatient.\n\n1182\n01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:46.310\nI can log out, and when I log back in,\nI can pick a different window manager.\n\n1183\n01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.630\nI'm not stuck to that one window manager.\n\n1184\n01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.620\nSo I can switch back over to Gnome or\nXFCE.\n\n1185\n01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.900\nWhich is my preference.\n\n1186\n01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.660\nAnd so I can log in with XFCE and\nhere we go.\n\n1187\n01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.880\nIt's letting me know this is\nthe first time I've come in so\n\n1188\n01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.400\nI can just use the default config.\n\n1189\n01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.000\nHere we are.\n\n1190\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.499\nAnd notice, there's my passwords, right?\n\n1191\n01:01:03.499 --> 01:01:04.670\nWell, that's a temporary file.\n\n1192\n01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:05.530\nHere's the real one.\n\n1193\n01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:06.590\nSo here's my passwords.\n\n1194\n01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:07.210\nI can go in there.\n\n1195\n01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:08.600\nAll right?\n\n1196\n01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.060\nIt's the same home folder.\n\n1197\n01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.120\nIt's the same document.\n\n1198\n01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.560\nIt's just a different window manager.\n\n1199\n01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.610\nSo, the window manager is changed,\nnot my user profile, so\n\n1200\n01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:20.830\nyou can flip between these at your\nleisure, whichever you prefer.\n\n1201\n01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:26.030\nIt's just a matter of logging out and\nlogging back in, and off you go.\n\n1202\n01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.581\nSo, let's see.\n\n1203\n01:01:26.581 --> 01:01:31.292\nI did KDE and XFCE,\nnow I'll just switch it to Gnome.\n\n1204\n01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:35.430\nWhich will make the Red Hat guys happy.\n\n1205\n01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:39.340\nAnd now,\nwe see it the way that Red Hat wants this.\n\n1206\n01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:43.600\nAnd so there we go, I've got my\ngood old passwords right there.\n\n1207\n01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.080\n&gt;&gt; Now, as far as now, locking it down,\nso there is no option, right?\n\n1208\n01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.900\nSo, you must not, or we can do\nthat as well, and lock it down, so\n\n1209\n01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:53.120\nthere is no option?\n\n1210\n01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.840\n&gt;&gt; So, you just have the one manager?\n\n1211\n01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:00.920\nYeah, you can go and modify the desktop\nfile that I showed you guys earlier,\n\n1212\n01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.430\nthat can override the setting and\nforce you to use one window manager.\n\n1213\n01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:07.875\nThe other option is you can\nset it in the user's profile.\n\n1214\n01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:10.930\nCuz those are just variables that we set,\nright?\n\n1215\n01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:15.874\nSo there was the desktop variable,\nand the desktop manager variable.\n\n1216\n01:02:15.874 --> 01:02:18.460\nAnd if you set those,\nyou can hard set it, and so\n\n1217\n01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.706\nyou can put it into the user's\nindividual profile to do it.\n\n1218\n01:02:21.706 --> 01:02:25.695\nPersonally, I just uninstall the window\nmanager's you don't wanna use.\n\n1219\n01:02:25.695 --> 01:02:28.160\nSo, if you don't want people using KDE,\ndon't install it.\n\n1220\n01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.020\nAnd if they're not root users,\n\n1221\n01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.030\nthen they're not gonna be\nable to add it anyways.\n\n1222\n01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:35.113\nSo that's really the best way to\nhandle it, but you can hard set it.\n\n1223\n01:02:35.113 --> 01:02:39.794\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, and then once again,\nwhether it's xorg or Waveland, or\n\n1224\n01:02:39.794 --> 01:02:46.510\nMir on the back end, so I mean they'll all\nlook the same as far as the desktops go.\n\n1225\n01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:49.727\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well with the exception of\nthe newer ones look a little buggy,\n\n1226\n01:02:49.727 --> 01:02:51.624\ncuz [LAUGH] they're not quite right yet.\n\n1227\n01:02:51.624 --> 01:02:55.410\nBut at the end of the day,\nwhen those products are complete, yes,\n\n1228\n01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:57.041\nthey'll all look the same.\n\n1229\n01:02:57.041 --> 01:02:57.582\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n1230\n01:02:57.582 --> 01:03:00.838\n&gt;&gt; All right, now we haven't really\nworked with the GUI much, and\n\n1231\n01:03:00.838 --> 01:03:04.170\nwe're not because it's only 8%\nof this one, the second exam.\n\n1232\n01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.374\nIt's such a small part of the exam.\n\n1233\n01:03:05.374 --> 01:03:07.425\nI don't wanna spend a ton of time on it.\n\n1234\n01:03:07.425 --> 01:03:11.635\nBut there are a few neat commands and\na few neat things I do wanna show you.\n\n1235\n01:03:11.635 --> 01:03:15.745\nOne is, we might wanna get some\ninformation about the windows that\n\n1236\n01:03:15.745 --> 01:03:20.125\nare running, and there's a couple of\nX Windows commands that are kind neat.\n\n1237\n01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:24.885\nI'm gonna launch these, depending on your,\nwhoops, depending on your GUI,\n\n1238\n01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:29.325\nyou might have a little run option\nthat you can pull up, or might not.\n\n1239\n01:03:29.325 --> 01:03:31.140\nSome of them h ave it, some of them don't.\n\n1240\n01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.550\nBut, I'm gonna run a few commands.\n\n1241\n01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:34.950\nI'll just launch them from a terminal,\n\n1242\n01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.600\nwould probably be the easiest\nway to go about this.\n\n1243\n01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.583\nI've got all sorts of terminals\nnow cuz I have KDE installed.\n\n1244\n01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:45.110\nBut, one little command that we can use,\nif we're in here and\n\n1245\n01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:50.284\nwe're working, and\nwe're firing up some different programs.\n\n1246\n01:03:50.284 --> 01:03:53.320\nDid I install, I don't have Firefox.\n\n1247\n01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.510\nI didn't install Firefox.\n\n1248\n01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:59.650\nIt's not a part of the default stuff,\nbut we do have Konqueror?\n\n1249\n01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:00.800\nYeah, there we go.\n\n1250\n01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.752\nKonqueror is the web browser\nthat comes with KDE.\n\n1251\n01:04:02.752 --> 01:04:05.650\nIt's got it's own little web browser,\nif you're into that.\n\n1252\n01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.628\nI can fire that up and get to work.\n\n1253\n01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:12.573\nNow if I want to find out information\nabout these windows, cuz these windows\n\n1254\n01:04:12.573 --> 01:04:15.254\nreally are just kind of programs\nthat are running in the background.\n\n1255\n01:04:15.254 --> 01:04:16.857\nAnd, if we run ps or whatever,\n\n1256\n01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:20.955\nwe don't see them because they're\nactually being run by our window manager.\n\n1257\n01:04:20.955 --> 01:04:24.953\nThey're there though, if I were to do\na ps aux, and poke around in there,\n\n1258\n01:04:24.953 --> 01:04:29.225\nyou can see there's my gnome terminal,\nthat's the window I'm in right now.\n\n1259\n01:04:29.225 --> 01:04:33.815\nAnd I can see gnome screensaver and\na bunch of other things that are now\n\n1260\n01:04:33.815 --> 01:04:38.502\nrunning as a part of me being in\na graphical user environment, right?\n\n1261\n01:04:38.502 --> 01:04:41.395\nIt's a lot more processes than we\nnormally have with the CLI and\n\n1262\n01:04:41.395 --> 01:04:43.970\nthat's one of the reasons we\ndon't do this on a server.\n\n1263\n01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:47.249\nServers, you wanna use as few\nresources as possible, so\n\n1264\n01:04:47.249 --> 01:04:49.996\nyou can support as many\ncustomers as possible.\n\n1265\n01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:53.294\nBut on a desktop you're just\nsupporting yourself, right?\n\n1266\n01:04:53.294 --> 01:04:56.471\nSo it's about giving you as\nmany features as you can, so\n\n1267\n01:04:56.471 --> 01:04:59.730\nit's just a different way of\nlooking at things, right?\n\n1268\n01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:02.530\nOne of the commands I wanted\nto show you guys, let's see,\n\n1269\n01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:08.450\nI think they called a few of them out\non the objectives, actually, I don't\n\n1270\n01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:13.790\nreally see any, but I know we've got a\ncouple like xwininfo, which is a neat one.\n\n1271\n01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:15.010\nI'll just use these.\n\n1272\n01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:19.490\nSo if I do xwininfo, it's a cool one\nbecause what it does is you'll see my\n\n1273\n01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:24.680\nmouse changes to a plus sign, and\nit lets me click on a window on my screen,\n\n1274\n01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.810\nand it'll give me information about it.\n\n1275\n01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:30.000\nSo, if I click on Conqueror here,\nyou'll see it gives me output.\n\n1276\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.720\nThe window is called Conqueror.\n\n1277\n01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.766\nHere's the dimensions that it's using.\n\n1278\n01:05:33.766 --> 01:05:37.480\nHere's the color scheme and\nthe current location,\n\n1279\n01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.805\nthe geometry,\nall sorts of details about the window.\n\n1280\n01:05:40.805 --> 01:05:45.670\nX-Windows is drawing this on the screen,\nso it has to track this information.\n\n1281\n01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:50.150\nWe can use that programmatically,\nyou'll see a lot of software does that,\n\n1282\n01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:51.790\nif it's managing your windows.\n\n1283\n01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.140\nIf it's a screen reader or whatever,\n\n1284\n01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.410\nit has to be able to know when you've\nmoved from one window to another, so\n\n1285\n01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:00.160\nthis information is all being\ntracked in the background.\n\n1286\n01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.890\nIt's transparent to us, right?\n\n1287\n01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:04.860\nYour average end user has no\nidea the stuff is going on, but\n\n1288\n01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.170\nit's happening every second of the day.\n\n1289\n01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:10.009\nThe Windows manager has to see that stuff,\nall right?\n\n1290\n01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:14.941\nThere's other utilities like that, like\nxdpyinfo, which is another one that will\n\n1291\n01:06:14.941 --> 01:06:18.562\nshow you information about how\nyour monitor's configured.\n\n1292\n01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:21.382\nSo you'll see your color\ndepth that you support and\n\n1293\n01:06:21.382 --> 01:06:25.318\nall sorts of different information there,\nit's really a ton of data,\n\n1294\n01:06:25.318 --> 01:06:27.626\ntrying to get to the top\nof it right there.\n\n1295\n01:06:27.626 --> 01:06:31.652\nAs it starts to lay out\ninformation about your resolution,\n\n1296\n01:06:31.652 --> 01:06:34.954\nsee I'm running at 1280x720 right now,\n\n1297\n01:06:34.954 --> 01:06:39.313\nI can see that I'm at a 96 dpi,\ndots per inch, or 96 by 96.\n\n1298\n01:06:39.313 --> 01:06:41.449\nYou just see all sorts of information.\n\n1299\n01:06:41.449 --> 01:06:45.401\nAgain, more stuff that has to be tracked,\ncuz we're not just throwing text\n\n1300\n01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:48.259\non a screen anymore,\nnow we're rendering graphics.\n\n1301\n01:06:48.259 --> 01:06:51.314\nAnd so it's gotta have a good\nunderstanding of your system to do that.\n\n1302\n01:06:51.314 --> 01:06:54.600\nSo, xdpyinfo shows us that.\n\n1303\n01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.412\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n1304\n01:06:56.412 --> 01:07:00.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a couple little things\nthat are there in the background.\n\n1305\n01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:04.822\nAll right,\nI feel like I'm leaving something out, but\n\n1306\n01:07:04.822 --> 01:07:08.050\nlooking at my notes, I don't think I am.\n\n1307\n01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:09.362\nNow, I do wanna cover one thing.\n\n1308\n01:07:09.362 --> 01:07:12.398\nI'm gonna go a little bit off the beaten\npath from the exam objectives.\n\n1309\n01:07:12.398 --> 01:07:17.099\nA lot of people look at X-Windows and\nthey see it just as a GUI for\n\n1310\n01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:20.138\nthe system while you're sitting at it.\n\n1311\n01:07:20.138 --> 01:07:24.564\nBut X-Windows is actually very, very\npowerful and any time you have something\n\n1312\n01:07:24.564 --> 01:07:28.550\nthat's very powerful,\nit's usually misunderstood, right?\n\n1313\n01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:31.134\nThe saying [LAUGH],\nI feel like I'm talking about a superhero,\n\n1314\n01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:35.190\nit's like Spider-Man, he's just\nmisunderstood, he's got emotions too.\n\n1315\n01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:36.485\nIt's okay for guys to cry.\n\n1316\n01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:41.490\n[LAUGH] But, you know it goes back to one\nof the things that I say, probably to\n\n1317\n01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:47.245\nmuch, which is 80% of the people\nonly use 20% of the features, right?\n\n1318\n01:07:47.245 --> 01:07:52.110\nX-Windows, sure it can draw\nthe graphical user interface for\n\n1319\n01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.980\na program on your screen and\nyou can use it, but\n\n1320\n01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:59.070\ndid you know that it doesn't\nhave to draw it to your screen?\n\n1321\n01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:01.790\nIt can draw it to anybody's screen.\n\n1322\n01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:03.610\nX-Windows is a server.\n\n1323\n01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:06.760\nYou're running the X-Windows\nserver on the back end.\n\n1324\n01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.740\nYou just happen to be running the client\nright here on the same machine.\n\n1325\n01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.120\nThat client is letting\nyou view the windows, but\n\n1326\n01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.260\nyou can run the client anywhere.\n\n1327\n01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:19.450\nYou can run the client on a completely\nseparate computer if you want, and\n\n1328\n01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:23.670\npeople can connect to it and see those\nwindows and launch applications and so on.\n\n1329\n01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.920\nIt's really, really cool, okay?\n\n1330\n01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.780\nLet me show you what I'm talking about cuz\njust describing it doesn't necessarily\n\n1331\n01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:30.060\ncommunicate it very well.\n\n1332\n01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.480\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n1333\n01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.710\nFirst off, X-Windows is set to only\nallow local communications by default.\n\n1334\n01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:41.420\nSo what we can do is we can open it up to\nallow connections from other machines.\n\n1335\n01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.820\nNow it's not gonna open it wide,\nfor the world.\n\n1336\n01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.641\nPeople still have to connect and\nauthenticate and all that good stuff.\n\n1337\n01:08:45.641 --> 01:08:50.390\nBut what we can do,\nlet me get it back into a terminal and\n\n1338\n01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:55.462\nI need to elevate my privileges\nhere real quick to do this.\n\n1339\n01:08:55.462 --> 01:09:00.171\nWe have a command called xhost, and xhost\nis what defines who's allowed to connect\n\n1340\n01:09:00.171 --> 01:09:04.629\nto this system and the default is that\nit is just limited to local connections.\n\n1341\n01:09:04.629 --> 01:09:08.110\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna use xhost to open it up.\n\n1342\n01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:12.170\nNow, normally what you do\nis you say xhost + and\n\n1343\n01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:17.100\na user name or xhost + and a host name for\na computer and that'll say that\n\n1344\n01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:21.000\nthat computer is allowed to connect or\nthat user is allowed to connect.\n\n1345\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.170\nI'm gonna go ahead and say xhost+, and\n\n1346\n01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:27.740\nthat will say access control disabled,\nclients can connect from any host.\n\n1347\n01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.220\nI'm saying anybody can\nconnect to this machine.\n\n1348\n01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.150\nNow, I'm not completely throwing\nsecurity out the door here.\n\n1349\n01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:37.030\nPeople still have to authenticate\nto get to it, and on your network,\n\n1350\n01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:38.510\nif you're allowing connectivity\nwith the Internet,\n\n1351\n01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:41.960\nyou should be using a firewall to control\nwho's even allowed to touch this.\n\n1352\n01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.234\nWhat I normally do is use SSH to\nbuild a secure tunnel to my system,\n\n1353\n01:09:46.234 --> 01:09:49.187\nand once I've got SSH in place,\nfrom there,\n\n1354\n01:09:49.187 --> 01:09:53.414\nI can then connect to X-Windows and\nrun applications, right?\n\n1355\n01:09:53.414 --> 01:09:55.999\n&gt;&gt; So Don,\nup on your taskbar up at the very top,\n\n1356\n01:09:55.999 --> 01:09:58.802\nthe little computers have\nlittle red x on there.\n\n1357\n01:09:58.802 --> 01:10:02.610\nDo you have your network\nconnection turned on to this VM?\n\n1358\n01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:06.255\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't seem to say that, but\nlet's just double check, I thought I did.\n\n1359\n01:10:06.255 --> 01:10:12.050\nYeah, so\nit's probably just picking up a different\n\n1360\n01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:17.700\nadapter, maybe a loopback or something.\n\n1361\n01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.940\nWe can go in here and hunt that down, but\n\n1362\n01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:26.240\nif I go into my network connections, you\nknow what it is, I did a basic install.\n\n1363\n01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.150\nAnd in the basic install, I didn't have\nthe GUI then and so on the network\n\n1364\n01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:34.470\nadapter, I set it so that it wouldn't be\nmanaged by the network manager, right?\n\n1365\n01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:38.310\nThat was an option in the card,\nI said I'm gonna manage it myself.\n\n1366\n01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:42.330\nAnd so I did that, and so now X-Windows,\nnow that I have the network manager,\n\n1367\n01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:45.580\nit can't see the card and so\nthat's why that's coming up.\n\n1368\n01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:50.994\nThat was in, let's see if I can find it.\n\n1369\n01:10:50.994 --> 01:10:54.558\nLet's see, now I gotta remember\nwhere that setting was.\n\n1370\n01:10:54.558 --> 01:11:03.056\nIt was in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts.\n\n1371\n01:11:05.654 --> 01:11:06.514\nThere we go.\n\n1372\n01:11:06.514 --> 01:11:10.464\nSo I'm in\n/etc/sisconfig/network-scripts and\n\n1373\n01:11:10.464 --> 01:11:15.286\nyou'll see a script in there\ncalled ifc of g-eth0, that's for\n\n1374\n01:11:15.286 --> 01:11:18.283\nmy ethernet, 0, or my first adapter.\n\n1375\n01:11:18.283 --> 01:11:25.802\nAnd if I take a look at that one,\nMy typing is horrible.\n\n1376\n01:11:25.802 --> 01:11:27.200\nThere we go.\n\n1377\n01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.450\nSee how I said NM CONTROLLED=no.\n\n1378\n01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:33.080\nThat's network manager\ncontrolled equals no.\n\n1379\n01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.930\nI set that back on, I mean that was\nlike day one of our network, so\n\n1380\n01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:38.160\nit's over a week ago now.\n\n1381\n01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.080\nI set that because I didn't have a GUI.\n\n1382\n01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.060\nSo I didn't have the network manager,\nso I just said no it's not controlled.\n\n1383\n01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:47.160\nAnd as a result, now that I do have\nthe network manager, it can't see my card.\n\n1384\n01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.238\nThat's what's going on.\n\n1385\n01:11:48.238 --> 01:11:52.230\nIf I changed that to yes and rebooted,\nthen it would see the card and\n\n1386\n01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:53.680\nbe able to manage it and so on.\n\n1387\n01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.500\nSo, that's why it's shown.\n\n1388\n01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.592\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n1389\n01:11:56.592 --> 01:11:58.550\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I am up on the network.\n\n1390\n01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:00.897\nActually while we're in here,\nI need to get my IP address.\n\n1391\n01:12:00.897 --> 01:12:04.502\nSo the IP address of this machine, I'm\njust gonna jot it down here on my note,\n\n1392\n01:12:04.502 --> 01:12:05.782\ncuz my memory is horrible.\n\n1393\n01:12:05.782 --> 01:12:11.041\nIt's 192.168.29.139.\n\n1394\n01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:14.653\nOkay, I need that because now\nI can go to another computer,\n\n1395\n01:12:14.653 --> 01:12:17.320\nanother computer on my network.\n\n1396\n01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.190\nI can build an ssh tunnel to this host,\nand\n\n1397\n01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:23.100\nI can start to launch X Windows\nprograms from here, all right?\n\n1398\n01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.830\nI guess I need a program to run.\n\n1399\n01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:28.060\nLet me install something,\nI'll install planner.\n\n1400\n01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.621\nThis was that project management\nprogram I fired up earlier.\n\n1401\n01:12:30.621 --> 01:12:33.800\nAll right, so\ni'm just going to install it real quick.\n\n1402\n01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:41.520\nIt's nice and small, so Planner, if you've\nnever seen it, it's this guy right here.\n\n1403\n01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.465\nIt's a little project manager utility, and\nit seems to be unhappy with me right now,\n\n1404\n01:12:45.465 --> 01:12:49.670\n[LAUGH] but\nyou can basically come in and set tasks.\n\n1405\n01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:50.770\nWhat is going on here?\n\n1406\n01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:55.700\nSome of your configuration settings\nfailed to contact connection server,\n\n1407\n01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.120\nagain, it's because the network card is.\n\n1408\n01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.400\n&gt;&gt; So, the apps can't make\na call to your network?\n\n1409\n01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it's enabled in the so\nI should probably fix that, but\n\n1410\n01:13:06.228 --> 01:13:08.430\n[LAUGH] anyhow, this is the program.\n\n1411\n01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:11.930\nThat's all that's important,\nthis is the program, and so we can see it.\n\n1412\n01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.160\nWe could add tasks and\ndo all sorts of project management stuff.\n\n1413\n01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.640\nIt's very exciting, right?\n\n1414\n01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.140\nWell, my desktop is actually a Mac, right?\n\n1415\n01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.390\nSo, I'm running on a Mac, and\nthe Mac doesn't have that planner program.\n\n1416\n01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:24.370\nBut maybe I love it.\n\n1417\n01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.420\nI really want that planner program.\n\n1418\n01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:30.210\nWhat I can do is,\nI can use X-Windows as a Client on my Mac.\n\n1419\n01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:35.510\nAnd I can have it connect to this\nmachine and run the planner program.\n\n1420\n01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:38.540\nBut, instead of displaying\nit here on this computer.\n\n1421\n01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.620\nI can have it display on my Mac.\n\n1422\n01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.430\nAnd it'll look like it's\nrunning natively on my Mac.\n\n1423\n01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:43.810\nIt looks like it's right there.\n\n1424\n01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:46.730\nBut, in reality it's running\nback here in X Windows server.\n\n1425\n01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:51.590\nThe only difference is the display\nis being play shifted somewhere else\n\n1426\n01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:53.640\nThat's the power of x windows.\n\n1427\n01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.820\nX windows will run your\ngraphical applications and\n\n1428\n01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:58.630\nit will display them where ever you want.\n\n1429\n01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:00.060\nYou can have 18 monitors and\n\n1430\n01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:03.660\nyou can display it all across those\ndifferent monitors or 18 completely\n\n1431\n01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:07.890\ndifferent computers, all displaying\napplications run from one location.\n\n1432\n01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:09.840\nIt's really, really cool.\n\n1433\n01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.660\nOkay.\n\n1434\n01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:14.700\nWell to do it If you have other Linux\nmachine's you just need to add X Windows\n\n1435\n01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.880\nthem, they need to have\nthe X Window's Client.\n\n1436\n01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:23.500\nBut if you have Windows or OSX, they\ndon't have a X Window's Client on them.\n\n1437\n01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.750\nSo you need to go out And get one.\n\n1438\n01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:28.620\nWell, in the Windows world\n\n1439\n01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:32.170\nyou can use cygwin/x that's one\nway that you can go about it.\n\n1440\n01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:35.460\nI'm not a big fan of this one cause\nit's a little on the quirky side.\n\n1441\n01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.340\nOn the Windows side I usually use x ming.\n\n1442\n01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:43.270\nX ming, it's the x ming server is\nbasically X Windows for Windows.\n\n1443\n01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:47.050\nNotice that they have a Windows 7\ndesktop in the background there, and\n\n1444\n01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:52.550\nwhat your seeing is a Windows 7\ndesktop and these are applications\n\n1445\n01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:56.070\nthat are actually being run from\nan X Windows server somewhere else.\n\n1446\n01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:58.560\nSee how they all have\nthat X icon down here.\n\n1447\n01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.080\nSo they look like they're\nrunning on Windows.\n\n1448\n01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.840\nBut they're really being executed\nfrom an X server, somewhere else.\n\n1449\n01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.730\nXming let's you do that and\nit's really straight forward.\n\n1450\n01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:09.810\nIt's a good software.\n\n1451\n01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:13.100\nOn the Mac side, I use XQuartz.\n\n1452\n01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.160\nAnd really there there is no\ncompetition on the mac side.\n\n1453\n01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.670\nX Quartz is awesome.\n\n1454\n01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:18.270\nIt's free and open source.\n\n1455\n01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:19.830\nYou can download it and install it.\n\n1456\n01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:22.340\nI know it says for OSX 10.6.\n\n1457\n01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.960\nActually it says including Mavericks.\n\n1458\n01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.660\nI'm running it on Mavericks just fine, and\n\n1459\n01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:31.920\nit's basically an X Windows client for\nOSX.\n\n1460\n01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.930\nIt works really well.\n\n1461\n01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.950\nI've got it installed or\nat least I think I do.\n\n1462\n01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:41.260\nYep, there it is, so\nI'm just gonna fire up X Quartz, and\n\n1463\n01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:46.300\nwhen you fire it up,\nyou get a bash prompt.\n\n1464\n01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:50.190\nNow, the bash prompt is actually for\nright here on my Mac, and so\n\n1465\n01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:55.460\nI need to build a connection to that\nvirtual machine where I'm running Linux,\n\n1466\n01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.636\nand so I'm gonna run ssh and\nI'm gonna use -y.\n\n1467\n01:15:58.636 --> 01:16:04.170\nThere's -x and -y, both of which\nare indicating that I'm gonna build remote\n\n1468\n01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:08.840\nwindow sessions to the other side, and\nso I'll just tell it that I'm going to\n\n1469\n01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:13.270\nremote over that other side and\nconnect up and try and do some damage.\n\n1470\n01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:19.570\nI'm gonna log in as dpezet on\nthe other side, and what was that IP?\n\n1471\n01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:24.230\nIt was 192.168.29.139,\nremembering the IP is\n\n1472\n01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:28.765\nreally the hardest part of this\nwhole process, so I'm gonna connect.\n\n1473\n01:16:28.765 --> 01:16:31.475\nIt's the first time I'm connecting,\nso I have to say whether or\n\n1474\n01:16:31.475 --> 01:16:35.535\nnot I trust that certificate,\nso I'll say yes, and so\n\n1475\n01:16:35.535 --> 01:16:39.775\nit's gonna add it, and\nnow, it wants my password.\n\n1476\n01:16:39.775 --> 01:16:44.620\n&gt;&gt; So, maybe, if I had missed the show,\nbut, so, on CentOS, I mean,\n\n1477\n01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.240\nis there already an SH server or whatnot\nserver running, like, built into it, so\n\n1478\n01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.560\nyou don't have to install anything else?\n\n1479\n01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.820\n&gt;&gt; Didn't even have to install anything.\n\n1480\n01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.900\nYeah, in fact, every modern Linux distro\nhas that, SSH is turned on by default,\n\n1481\n01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:59.690\nIf it isn't, you may need to start\nthe sshd service or the open\n\n1482\n01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:04.080\nssh service depending on what disk trial,\nbut it's usually on by default.\n\n1483\n01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.640\nNow I didn't log in as root,\nand on most distros,\n\n1484\n01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.360\nroot is not allowed in the ssh cuz,\nagain, if you're a hacker,\n\n1485\n01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.430\nif you're trying to break in\n&gt;&gt; What account you're gonna go for?\n\n1486\n01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:17.430\nRoot, so it's normally blocked off,\nbut I'm using my regular user,\n\n1487\n01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:20.670\njust D Pizet, and\nI know that's really small.\n\n1488\n01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:26.288\nMy font is not the biggest,\nthat made no difference whatsoever.\n\n1489\n01:17:26.288 --> 01:17:29.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so anyhow,\n\n1490\n01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:31.630\nbut\n&gt;&gt; Could probably bump my font up somehow,\n\n1491\n01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:33.227\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n1492\n01:17:33.227 --> 01:17:34.550\n&gt;&gt; Not, not like that.\n\n1493\n01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:37.930\nYeah, but apparently,\nI'm just beyond actually.\n\n1494\n01:17:37.930 --> 01:17:39.204\nYou know what, forget it.\n\n1495\n01:17:39.204 --> 01:17:41.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I just did ssh-y and\n\n1496\n01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.490\nthen I did my name @ and the IP address\nof the host I was connecting to.\n\n1497\n01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:46.920\nI provided my password.\n\n1498\n01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:53.060\n&gt;&gt; And now I've got an SSH tunnel that's\nready to launch remote applications.\n\n1499\n01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.930\nSo now remember on the other\nside were I run planner and\n\n1500\n01:17:55.930 --> 01:17:58.450\na pound symbol,\nwe'll I'm gonna do the same thing here.\n\n1501\n01:17:58.450 --> 01:18:00.760\nI'm gonna run planner and\nthe pound symbol and\n\n1502\n01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.330\nwhat's it gonna do is it's gonna\nlaunch that and if you look,\n\n1503\n01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:07.910\nlet me, you know I got to may windows\nopen, let me minimize some of these junk.\n\n1504\n01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:12.330\nYou'll see that I'm on my Mach\n&gt;&gt; Here's my Mac desktop back here,\n\n1505\n01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.300\nand, really you're not gonna let me?\n\n1506\n01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.062\nThere.\n[LAUGH] Please let me drag and drop.\n\n1507\n01:18:18.062 --> 01:18:21.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you'll see my Mac desktop back here.\n\n1508\n01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.000\nHere's my little launcher.\n\n1509\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.050\nI got my Macintosh hard drive and\nall that.\n\n1510\n01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:27.130\nAnd then I launch Planner, and\n\n1511\n01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:30.000\nit looks like Planner is running\nright here on my Mac, right?\n\n1512\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.059\nI mean it looks like\nthis is just straight up\n\n1513\n01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.760\n&gt;&gt; Me doing work whatever.\n\n1514\n01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.390\nAnd I can get in here and\nI can start to work with this.\n\n1515\n01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:42.240\nAnd insert my tasks in fact I'm\nnot even getting that error.\n\n1516\n01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.510\nSo I'm going to put in,\n\n1517\n01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:46.690\nI'm starting a project here to fire\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n1518\n01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:48.630\n&gt;&gt; So step one.\n\n1519\n01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:49.860\nWrite pink slip.\n\n1520\n01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:55.734\nAnd\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Did I spell it wrong?\n\n1521\n01:18:55.734 --> 01:18:57.110\nI did.\nI spelled it wrong.\n\n1522\n01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.610\n&gt;&gt; Zing.\n\n1523\n01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:59.520\nGood one, yeah.\n\n1524\n01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.575\nWho should be terminated now?\n\n1525\n01:19:00.575 --> 01:19:04.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I can go through and\nstart to do this.\n\n1526\n01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:07.520\nJust write it up and do all\nthe different things that I need to do.\n\n1527\n01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.440\nLink these together.\n\n1528\n01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.620\nI'm working with project management.\n\n1529\n01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.250\nNow, I can run my favorite Linux apps,\nthe programs I wanna run.\n\n1530\n01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:14.460\nI can run them on my Mac.\n\n1531\n01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.210\nAnd I didn't have to do any\ncrazy virtualization sublayer or\n\n1532\n01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:18.310\nanything like that.\n\n1533\n01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:19.960\nI just needed an X windows client.\n\n1534\n01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:24.150\nThis program is actually running on my\nLinux box, it's not running on the mac.\n\n1535\n01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:24.690\nRight?\n\n1536\n01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:26.100\nBut I see it here.\n\n1537\n01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:29.490\nAnd it's the same thing when\nyou run x ming on windows\n\n1538\n01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:33.250\nit looks like the application's running\nright there on windows, but it's not.\n\n1539\n01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:36.810\nIt's running on the x server\nhosted on your Linux And\n\n1540\n01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:40.650\nyou could have hundreds, even\nthousands of users connected this way.\n\n1541\n01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:43.893\nWhere they're all running\napplications off if your server.\n\n1542\n01:19:43.893 --> 01:19:47.320\nYou server that might not even\nhave a GUI running on it.\n\n1543\n01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.550\nIt might be sitting at\na command prompt just waiting.\n\n1544\n01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:53.820\nAnd all the remote sessions Are GUI based.\n\n1545\n01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.220\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n1546\n01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:59.432\n&gt;&gt; You know, Don, so looking at this\nstuff and I'm kind of a Windows guy but\n\n1547\n01:19:59.432 --> 01:20:04.130\nyou know, with your little command prompt\nthere entering it in, it looks like,\n\n1548\n01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:07.239\na lot like you're entering\nin a power cell session and\n\n1549\n01:20:07.239 --> 01:20:10.376\nthen running the stuff here\nin like at v at Microsoft.\n\n1550\n01:20:10.376 --> 01:20:11.317\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n1551\n01:20:11.317 --> 01:20:15.270\nSetting that stuff up is a bit more\ninvolved, and you just fired it up,\n\n1552\n01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:18.151\nyou clicked a couple things,\nyou typed a line, and\n\n1553\n01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:21.210\nnow you're running a remote application.\n\n1554\n01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:23.714\nAnd much, much easier then App-V.\n\n1555\n01:20:23.714 --> 01:20:27.470\n&gt;&gt; The big difference, aside from it being\neasier, right, cuz App-V is a nightmare.\n\n1556\n01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:30.090\nIf you never heard of App-V\nit's Microsoft's application\n\n1557\n01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:32.510\nvirtualization stuff,\nand it's a nightmare.\n\n1558\n01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:36.080\nThe big difference is Linux has\nbeen doing this for over 20 years.\n\n1559\n01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:36.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n1560\n01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:40.920\nWindows, Microsoft has been rolling those\nfeatures out over the last seven years.\n\n1561\n01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.070\nThey've really just\nbeen getting into that.\n\n1562\n01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:48.250\nTheir terminal server just in general\ndidn't really kick off until like 1999.\n\n1563\n01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:51.310\nX Windows has had this since day one,\nand it's 30 years old.\n\n1564\n01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:54.440\nSo it's been around a long time.\n\n1565\n01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.680\nAnd other vendors like Microsoft and\n\n1566\n01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.180\neven Apple recognize that\nthere's value in that.\n\n1567\n01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.140\nThere's value in being able\nto run applications remotely,\n\n1568\n01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:07.880\nnot having to install and\nmanage the application on my client.\n\n1569\n01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.690\nInstead, just remotely connect to it.\n\n1570\n01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:10.920\nIt's already installed on the other side.\n\n1571\n01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.700\nIt's got all the packages it needs.\n\n1572\n01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:16.350\nIf I wanna do an upgrade, so\nI decide it's time to upgrade planner.\n\n1573\n01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:18.190\nWell, if I have it\ninstalled on 50 machines,\n\n1574\n01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:20.900\nI've gotta go and upgrade it in 50 places.\n\n1575\n01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:25.120\nBut if I'm running it remotely like this,\neverybody's running it off of one server,\n\n1576\n01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.250\nI just upgrade that one server and\nnow everybody's updated.\n\n1577\n01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:32.090\nOf course, if that one server fails,\nwhat happens to everybody?\n\n1578\n01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:33.070\nEverybody fails, right?\n\n1579\n01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:34.740\nSo, it gives you a central\npoint of failure.\n\n1580\n01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:39.360\nPros and cons of each model, there's no\nright answer because every environment is\n\n1581\n01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.980\na little bit different,\neverybody has slightly different needs but\n\n1582\n01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.720\nthis is the true power of X Windows,\nright?\n\n1583\n01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.840\nThe fact that it can render\nyour windows anywhere,\n\n1584\n01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.200\nnot just on the machine\nthat you're sitting at.\n\n1585\n01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.320\nIt can do it anywhere,\nand it's pretty cool.\n\n1586\n01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:56.260\n&gt;&gt; So you could be running\na bunch of these applications,\n\n1587\n01:21:56.260 --> 01:22:01.450\nand it will be using the RAM and\nthe hard disk on that server then,\n\n1588\n01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:03.660\nand so it won't be taxing\nyour little system here.\n\n1589\n01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI mean, here\n\n1590\n01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:05.750\nI've got the X Windows client.\n\n1591\n01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:06.290\nAnd that's it.\n\n1592\n01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:08.930\nSo, the ex Windows client has probably\ntaken a couple of megs of RAM\n\n1593\n01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:09.860\nand that's it.\n\n1594\n01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:14.600\nMeanwhile, planner is actually running\nback over here on my Linux box.\n\n1595\n01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.800\nSo, it's running here and\nit's consuming memory and\n\n1596\n01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:22.885\nso on here, now on this one, I see planner\nhere just cuz I ran it earlier, but\n\n1597\n01:22:22.885 --> 01:22:25.705\nI don't see a planner window open.\n\n1598\n01:22:25.705 --> 01:22:31.050\nBut if I do a PS aux,\nand I pass that through.\n\n1599\n01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:32.630\nAnd I look for planner.\n\n1600\n01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.070\nI'll find it in there.\n\n1601\n01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:39.270\nWell I see my graip also but\nthere it is deposit is running planner.\n\n1602\n01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:40.770\nThe GUI application.\n\n1603\n01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:44.380\nIt's just not coming up on my screen,\nit's coming up remotely.\n\n1604\n01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:47.000\nIt's being sent onto a remote screen.\n\n1605\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.350\nReally neat.\n\n1606\n01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:51.300\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. That is. That is pretty slick,\nand pretty, yeah, pretty straight forward,\n\n1607\n01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.040\npretty seamless.\n\n1608\n01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.092\n&gt;&gt; It helps when it's built into the OS.\n\n1609\n01:22:54.092 --> 01:22:56.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, there is one last thing that\n\n1610\n01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:58.690\nwe wanna talk about with\nthe graphical user interface and\n\n1611\n01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:02.770\nthat is accessibility options and\nfeatures.\n\n1612\n01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:04.270\nSo we're gonna take a look at that, but\n\n1613\n01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:07.230\nI see I've already run overtime on\nthis segment, so why don't we do this.\n\n1614\n01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:10.710\nLet's stop and take a break, and when\nwe get back we're gonna take a look at\n\n1615\n01:23:10.710 --> 01:23:15.170\nthe accessibility tools and how we can\nuse those to better interact with our OS.\n\n1616\n01:23:15.170 --> 01:23:20.348\nStay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1617\n01:23:20.348 --> 01:23:24.730\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n1618\n01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:26.290\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n1619\n01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:29.840\nSo, for the last part of this show,\nI wanna talk a little bit about\n\n1620\n01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:34.820\naccessibility options or\nassistive technologies.\n\n1621\n01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:36.990\nA number of different names for it.\n\n1622\n01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:40.690\nGraphical user interfaces, and\nreally computers in general.\n\n1623\n01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:45.030\nThey're designed for people that have\na full range of sight and auditory and\n\n1624\n01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:49.130\nphysical control and not everyone\nis fortunate enough to have that.\n\n1625\n01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:52.980\nMany people have needs that kinda\ndiffer from the standard use scenario\n\n1626\n01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:53.720\nof a system.\n\n1627\n01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:58.840\nSo for example if you're visually\nimpaired, that nice pretty splash screen,\n\n1628\n01:23:58.840 --> 01:23:59.870\nthe graphics on the screen,\n\n1629\n01:23:59.870 --> 01:24:03.130\nthey don't really help you to be\nable to interact with the computer.\n\n1630\n01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:06.310\nAnd so most operating systems, Linux and\n\n1631\n01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:10.660\nLinux Distros is no exception have various\nsoftware packages and functions that can\n\n1632\n01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.320\nhelp to remove those barriers to basically\nmake computers accessible to everyone.\n\n1633\n01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.640\nNot just people that fit\nthe common use scenario.\n\n1634\n01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:22.320\nNow, some of these are for\nvery specific scenarios.\n\n1635\n01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.650\nFor example, if you are blind you\nare not gonna be able to receive that\n\n1636\n01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:31.220\nvisual input from the PC, so you need some\nother way to to get that information.\n\n1637\n01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:34.400\nBut some of these are really\njust a matter of convenience.\n\n1638\n01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:38.530\nMaybe you have small hands and\nit's very difficult for\n\n1639\n01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:41.920\nyou to hold down the Shift key\nwhile you press another key, and\n\n1640\n01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.100\nso we can use this assistive\ntechnologies to help with that too.\n\n1641\n01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:49.320\nSo don't immediately think in your mind\nthat there's just certain people that\n\n1642\n01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.660\nthese meet the needs for.\n\n1643\n01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:54.870\nMany of us can use the assistive\ntechnologies, sadly I find myself starting\n\n1644\n01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:58.080\nto use the screen magnifier as\nthe resolution on these machines keeps\n\n1645\n01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.000\ngetting higher and higher and\nmy eyes don't get better and better.\n\n1646\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.365\nSo, these definitely fit all\nsorts of different scenarios.\n\n1647\n01:25:05.365 --> 01:25:07.925\nSo I wanna walk you through some\nof the ones that are available.\n\n1648\n01:25:07.925 --> 01:25:11.475\nI am gonna focus on Gnome,\nbecause Gnome is the most common desktop.\n\n1649\n01:25:11.475 --> 01:25:14.756\nThe assistive technologies do\nvery from desktop to desktop.\n\n1650\n01:25:14.756 --> 01:25:17.173\nIt really is your window\nmanager that determines it.\n\n1651\n01:25:17.173 --> 01:25:22.289\nSo it doesn't matter if I'm running or\nor Red Hat or Slackware or\n\n1652\n01:25:22.289 --> 01:25:27.255\nwhatever, if I'm running Gnome I'm gonna\nhave the same set of accessibility\n\n1653\n01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:32.172\nfeatures to be able to use my system,\nor the assist of technologies, right.\n\n1654\n01:25:32.172 --> 01:25:36.801\nSo on the Gnome website, help.gnome.org\nthey actually have their assistive\n\n1655\n01:25:36.801 --> 01:25:41.568\ntechnologies desktop guide, and it walks\nthrough some of the different features\n\n1656\n01:25:41.568 --> 01:25:46.150\nthat are available, and the different\nscenarios where they're useful for.\n\n1657\n01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:51.380\nSo, if you have full legal blindness,\nif you just have a visual impairment,\n\n1658\n01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:55.920\nyou're not completely blind, but\nyou're not yeah, able to see 20/20.\n\n1659\n01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.530\nHearing impairments, mobility impairments,\nand that's becoming, sadly,\n\n1660\n01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:02.570\na very needed thing.\n\n1661\n01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:06.470\nThere's a lot of degenerative diseases and\nthings that affect people.\n\n1662\n01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:10.760\nAnd in the past, it would prevent\nyou from using a computer outright.\n\n1663\n01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.810\nSo they've really come a long\nway in making that case.\n\n1664\n01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:17.430\nBecause computers, computers can\nreally enrich the lives of a lot of\n\n1665\n01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:20.250\npeople if they are able\nto make use of them.\n\n1666\n01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:23.190\nSo we see a ton of different things and\nherein,\n\n1667\n01:26:23.190 --> 01:26:26.200\nif you ever browse through\ntheir help documentation.\n\n1668\n01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:29.240\nThey explain them all outright and\nkind of what they do.\n\n1669\n01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:33.020\nBut just kind of running down the list,\nas far as visual impairments,\n\n1670\n01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:36.360\none of the most useful\nthings is a screen reader.\n\n1671\n01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.590\nA screen reader will take what's\non your screen and read it aloud.\n\n1672\n01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:44.950\nI made a comment when we were\ninstalling GNOME or KDE earlier,\n\n1673\n01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:47.800\nthat Orca was one of\nthe packages that was installed.\n\n1674\n01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.000\nWell, in the Red Hat based OSs and\n\n1675\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.210\nin many others we have Orca\nwhich is a screen reader.\n\n1676\n01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:57.270\nIt will take text that appears on\nthe screen and read it out loud to people.\n\n1677\n01:26:57.270 --> 01:27:00.080\nSo, if you can't necessarily\nsee what's going on,\n\n1678\n01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.830\nit's reading that text\nthrough an auditory means.\n\n1679\n01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:04.490\nSo that you can hear what's going on.\n\n1680\n01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:05.180\nAll right.\n\n1681\n01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:08.820\nThat is one very easy solution to use\nbecause it doesn't require special\n\n1682\n01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:10.470\nhardware right.\n\n1683\n01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:13.840\nBut if this is something\nyou deal with everyday\n\n1684\n01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.079\nthen you may choose to use\nwhat's called a monitor.\n\n1685\n01:27:17.079 --> 01:27:22.070\nA monitor is instead of displayed a visual\noutput, that's not gonna help you.\n\n1686\n01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:26.120\nIt will basically display a braille\noutput that you can use your sense of\n\n1687\n01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.470\ntouch to be able to\ninterpret the feedback.\n\n1688\n01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:32.230\nAnd has support for\nthat and it's again through.\n\n1689\n01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:35.355\nSays, hey instead of reading\nit out loud through audio\n\n1690\n01:27:35.355 --> 01:27:37.795\nwe can represent it through\na braille keyboard.\n\n1691\n01:27:37.795 --> 01:27:40.125\nAnd I was mentioning this earlier and\n\n1692\n01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:42.625\nit turns out most of the guys on\nthe set had not seen one of these.\n\n1693\n01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:47.490\nI had seen one in the past for\nvarious reasons.\n\n1694\n01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:50.750\nBut this is an example here\nof a braille keyboard.\n\n1695\n01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:52.796\nI shouldn't call it a keyboard.\n\n1696\n01:27:52.796 --> 01:27:54.780\nIt's a monitor.\nI mean it is effectively a monitor.\n\n1697\n01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:57.410\nIt's just not a visual monitor in\nthe way that we think about it.\n\n1698\n01:27:57.410 --> 01:28:00.964\nAnd what it does is it has little\ntactile bumps that change,\n\n1699\n01:28:00.964 --> 01:28:04.533\nbased on what's being displayed\non the screen, so it's.\n\n1700\n01:28:04.533 --> 01:28:08.780\nAlmost more like a printer, except it's\ndynamic, it's constantly changing,\n\n1701\n01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:13.440\nthe bumps come up and go down as needed,\nand they make portable versions and so on.\n\n1702\n01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.600\nAnd so, if we enable Orca, and\nwe tell it we have a Braille monitor,\n\n1703\n01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.611\nit can output to that, and now when\ntext is represented on the screen,\n\n1704\n01:28:20.611 --> 01:28:25.790\nwe can feel the text and be able to\nread it that way, or even do both.\n\n1705\n01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:29.040\nYou can have it read it out loud and\ngive you the braille interpretation,\n\n1706\n01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.250\nit can output to both.\n\n1707\n01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:35.074\nVery, very useful, and that's built in,\nif we choose to turn it on, all right?\n\n1708\n01:28:35.074 --> 01:28:37.407\nAll of these options are like that,\nthey're built in.\n\n1709\n01:28:37.407 --> 01:28:40.990\nWe just have to turn them on, and they try\nto make that as easy as possible because\n\n1710\n01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:44.570\nthe first time you sit down at a computer,\nif it's not equipped for this stuff,\n\n1711\n01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:47.395\nthen you're gonna have a hard\ntime getting that up and going.\n\n1712\n01:28:47.395 --> 01:28:52.540\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, all right, so Don, so we've got\na screen reader that will read back, we've\n\n1713\n01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:58.730\ngot this braille monitor that will kind of\nprint it out, what about the input stuff?\n\n1714\n01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:01.860\nSo, how are you going to get\nthe information into it?\n\n1715\n01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.520\nSo, we get information out\nof it by putting it into it,\n\n1716\n01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:09.600\nwas there more In there as far\nas dictation or something?\n\n1717\n01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.510\n&gt;&gt; Now that one's a little easier\nbecause all input these days is being\n\n1718\n01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:19.690\nmanaged by the HID system, the human\ninput device, or human interface devices,\n\n1719\n01:29:19.690 --> 01:29:24.550\nand so keyboards and mice that hook up\nvia USB, they're recognized as HID.\n\n1720\n01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:27.550\nAnd so, you'll see a lot of inputs like,\n\n1721\n01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.970\nif you are a quadriplegic, then you're\nnot able to use a traditional mouse, but\n\n1722\n01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:36.900\na lot of times they can rig you up with\na joystick that you can operate with your\n\n1723\n01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.705\nchin, if you have that mobility,\nor with your mouth, if you don't.\n\n1724\n01:29:40.705 --> 01:29:43.125\nSome of them even have where you can\nmanipulate with your eyes, right,\n\n1725\n01:29:43.125 --> 01:29:44.635\nit tracks eye movement.\n\n1726\n01:29:44.635 --> 01:29:48.775\nIn the end of the day, you'll have\nan application, usually specialized for\n\n1727\n01:29:48.775 --> 01:29:53.235\nthe hardware that you're using that\ntranslates whatever that input is into\n\n1728\n01:29:53.235 --> 01:29:55.385\nmouth movements or\ncursor movements, or whatever, and\n\n1729\n01:29:55.385 --> 01:29:58.565\nit's done entirely through the HID system,\nso that's easier.\n\n1730\n01:29:58.565 --> 01:30:00.685\nI don't want to say it's too easy cuz,\nI mean,\n\n1731\n01:30:00.685 --> 01:30:03.918\nit does take a pretty good amount of\nwork to make these things happen, but\n\n1732\n01:30:03.918 --> 01:30:06.742\nit's simpler just because\nthe computer receives that input.\n\n1733\n01:30:06.742 --> 01:30:10.778\nThe output is more challenging\ncuz you're taking content that\n\n1734\n01:30:10.778 --> 01:30:14.740\nwasn't necessarily rendered\nwith accessibility in mind and\n\n1735\n01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:18.866\nhaving to convert it to give it out so\nthat is a little bit harder.\n\n1736\n01:30:18.866 --> 01:30:22.946\nSome of the other accessibility features\nare things that would pertain to people\n\n1737\n01:30:22.946 --> 01:30:24.732\nwith other ailments.\n\n1738\n01:30:24.732 --> 01:30:30.160\nFor example, let's say you're\na Parkinson's patient, right?\n\n1739\n01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.140\nParkinson's Disease,\nif you're not familiar with it,\n\n1740\n01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:36.270\nis a muscular degenerative disease, and\nit causes you to lose muscle control,\n\n1741\n01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:38.905\nso it becomes very hard\nto do precise movements.\n\n1742\n01:30:38.905 --> 01:30:44.260\nDouble-tapping of keys is very common, so\ntyping becomes a real challenge, right?\n\n1743\n01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.350\nIt can be really frustrating, and so\n\n1744\n01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:51.520\nwe have the option to turn on,\nwe'll see it back here.\n\n1745\n01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:56.140\nTo turn on, let's see what is it\ncalled it's in here somewhere.\n\n1746\n01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:59.590\nLet's see bounce keys, there we go.\n\n1747\n01:30:59.590 --> 01:31:03.010\nBounce keys and slow keys,\nboth of which can help with that.\n\n1748\n01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:06.360\nSo bounce keys,\nwe ignore quickly repeated key presses.\n\n1749\n01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.100\nSo, if it's an accidental jitter,\n\n1750\n01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:12.160\nyou tap the keys a couple of times,\nit will interpret that as one key press,\n\n1751\n01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.560\ninstead of multiple, so\nthat's a very nice feature.\n\n1752\n01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.850\nThere is the opposite where\nwe can do sticky keys.\n\n1753\n01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:21.800\nI mentioned, maybe you just have\nsmall hands, and it's difficult for\n\n1754\n01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:25.715\nyou to operate that Shift key and\nthe letter, or whatever.\n\n1755\n01:31:25.715 --> 01:31:30.595\nSticky keys is where you can, if I want\nto write a capital F, normally I would\n\n1756\n01:31:30.595 --> 01:31:34.945\nhold Shift, and I would hit F, and\nthen that would create the capital F, but\n\n1757\n01:31:34.945 --> 01:31:38.241\nif you can't operate that way,\nthen you can turn on Sticky Keys.\n\n1758\n01:31:38.241 --> 01:31:42.550\nYou can tap the Shift key and\nlet it go, and\n\n1759\n01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:46.270\nthe system will treat it as if it is still\ndown, until you press your next letter,\n\n1760\n01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:51.500\nand then when you press F\nthen you get a capital F.\n\n1761\n01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.980\nThat's an incredibly useful thing for\n\n1762\n01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:57.200\npeople that find it difficult\nto manipulate a keyboard.\n\n1763\n01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:02.180\nAll of these accessibility or\nassistive technologies Have purpose right.\n\n1764\n01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:06.700\nAnd it's a matter of finding which ones\nmeet the needs of either yourself or\n\n1765\n01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:09.800\nthe person you're trying to assist\nto be able to use a computer.\n\n1766\n01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.230\nDon't pigeon hole yourself to\none technology or another right.\n\n1767\n01:32:12.230 --> 01:32:14.320\nYou'll need to find a mixture of them.\n\n1768\n01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.210\nAnd you don't have to settle for\nwhat's built in the system either.\n\n1769\n01:32:17.210 --> 01:32:20.340\nSo, for example, Orca,\nit's a good screen reader.\n\n1770\n01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:22.050\nYou can use it, it works well.\n\n1771\n01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:23.530\nBut maybe you just don't like it.\n\n1772\n01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:26.777\nThere are other ones that are out there.\n\n1773\n01:32:26.777 --> 01:32:29.003\nSpecifically calls out Emacspeak.\n\n1774\n01:32:29.003 --> 01:32:31.430\nAnd I've never used Use\nthis one personally, but\n\n1775\n01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:35.340\nit's another one that's out there\nthat is a third party screen reader.\n\n1776\n01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:39.900\nSo, you can load that and they've got\nseveral different versions of it and\n\n1777\n01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:43.460\nyou can run it and it's basically\na screen reader much like Orca.\n\n1778\n01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:46.490\nSome people prefer one or\nthe other because of language support.\n\n1779\n01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:50.660\nI don't know native you listen\nto the text-to-speech voices.\n\n1780\n01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.300\nSometimes their painful.\n\n1781\n01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, actually I just recently\nI had the opportunity listen\n\n1782\n01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:58.660\n&gt;&gt; To a bunch of different voices through\n\n1783\n01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:01.580\na speech thing.\n\n1784\n01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:05.440\nA bunch of different examples, and yeah,\nsome of them do sound much better,\n\n1785\n01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.030\nmore natural than others.\n\n1786\n01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n1787\n01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:11.670\nYou know I use them all the time.\n\n1788\n01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:13.430\nBecause when I'm driving.\n\n1789\n01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:16.820\nObviously you don't want to text\nwhile driving and things like that.\n\n1790\n01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.910\nAnd so I use text to speech a lot.\n\n1791\n01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:23.370\nSo if I get an email while I'm driving I\nhave my phone read out that text to me.\n\n1792\n01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:28.590\nAnd so I've probably been through 20\ndifferent voices in the last year\n\n1793\n01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:31.260\ntrying to find that voice that\nsounds the least robotic.\n\n1794\n01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:33.150\nAnd so that happens.\n\n1795\n01:33:33.150 --> 01:33:37.140\nIf this is something you need every\nsingle day You're gonna shop around and\n\n1796\n01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:39.190\nfind the one that works the best for you.\n\n1797\n01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:44.140\nUnfortunately some of the best support for\nthis is in the Windows world.\n\n1798\n01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.410\nRight, you know we have jaws and\n\n1799\n01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:47.700\napplications like that in the Windows\nworld just because Windows is such\n\n1800\n01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:51.055\na prominent operating system But\nthat doesn't mean you can't run Linux, and\n\n1801\n01:33:51.055 --> 01:33:54.405\nwe've got it in Linux also,\nso Orca is a great one.\n\n1802\n01:33:54.405 --> 01:33:56.245\nIt's probably the most popular, Emax,\n\n1803\n01:33:56.245 --> 01:33:59.595\nthere's other ones, you just find\nth ones that suit your needs.\n\n1804\n01:33:59.595 --> 01:34:01.855\nWell let's take a look at\nthis on an actual desktop.\n\n1805\n01:34:03.155 --> 01:34:06.075\nWhen we go to login to our desktop,\nand let me just log out.\n\n1806\n01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.540\nI'll log out of this system here.\n\n1807\n01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:14.240\nAll right, to get to the assistive\ntechnologies, when you're on the login\n\n1808\n01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:17.550\nscreen, we need to look for a little icon,\nand it'll be at the bottom right.\n\n1809\n01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:19.200\nSo when I go to log in to this machine,\n\n1810\n01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:22.650\nsee down here I've got this blue\ncircle with a little stick man in it?\n\n1811\n01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:24.800\nThat's the assistive technologies icon.\n\n1812\n01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.990\nAnd if I click on that I'm not\neven logged in yet, right?\n\n1813\n01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:29.220\nSo I'm at the login screen.\n\n1814\n01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.490\nIt's important we have this\nat the login screen, right?\n\n1815\n01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:34.880\nBecause we need people to be able to read,\nor interpret, or\n\n1816\n01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.070\ninteract with that login screen\nin whatever way works for them.\n\n1817\n01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:42.720\nAnd we can quickly turn on some of\nthe various Different options, right?\n\n1818\n01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:47.460\nI mentioned GOK,\nthe Gnome Onscreen Keyboard.\n\n1819\n01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:49.910\nAnd so I've got that right here,\nI can turn that on.\n\n1820\n01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:51.360\nAnd there's my onscreen keyboard.\n\n1821\n01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:56.660\nThis is useful if you're Using\nagain as an example like\n\n1822\n01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:01.010\na quadriplegic that might not be able to\ntype on a keyboard you might have a oral\n\n1823\n01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:04.790\nappliance that you use to tap on a touch\nscreen, and you'd be able to use this.\n\n1824\n01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:07.150\nWe're seeing this used on\ntablets a lot now, right.\n\n1825\n01:35:07.150 --> 01:35:10.890\nSo now it's not even a matter of having\na disability, just having device that\n\n1826\n01:35:10.890 --> 01:35:15.940\ndoesn't have a keyboard you can make use\nof that So that's the onscreen keyboard.\n\n1827\n01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:19.500\nYou may or\nmay not need that in your environment.\n\n1828\n01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:22.500\nWe've got this screen reader and\nthat's Orca that will turn on.\n\n1829\n01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.490\nAnd I don't think I have a sound card\nattached to this virtual machine, so\n\n1830\n01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:27.750\nI'm pretty sure it's not gonna talk.\n\n1831\n01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:29.690\nAlthough it is gonna think for a while.\n\n1832\n01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:32.570\n[LAUGH] If you want the screen\nreader to work, it's probably\n\n1833\n01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:36.450\na good idea to have a sound card,\nwhich I'm pretty sure I don't on this one.\n\n1834\n01:35:36.450 --> 01:35:40.730\nThere's the screen magnifier,\nwhich is incredibly useful because boy,\n\n1835\n01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:43.480\nscreen resolutions are getting higher and\nhigher.\n\n1836\n01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.570\nSo, if you are, not necessarily\nlegally blind but if you are just\n\n1837\n01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:51.188\nvisually impaired Impaired,\nif your vision is half as bad as mine is.\n\n1838\n01:35:51.188 --> 01:35:52.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mine's pretty bad.\n\n1839\n01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:55.685\nI don't think you can see it on camera\nexactly how thick my classes are, but.\n\n1840\n01:35:55.685 --> 01:35:59.406\n[LAUGH] So if yours are as bad as mine,\nyou can use this screen magnifier,\n\n1841\n01:35:59.406 --> 01:36:00.532\nit's really handy.\n\n1842\n01:36:00.532 --> 01:36:02.705\nIt just follows your mouse,\nand it magnifies And\n\n1843\n01:36:02.705 --> 01:36:05.944\nyou'll see there's actually two\nlevels of magnification by default.\n\n1844\n01:36:05.944 --> 01:36:08.613\nSo I've got three panes on my screen here,\n\n1845\n01:36:08.613 --> 01:36:13.359\none that is magnified a decent amount and\none that's like super magnified,\n\n1846\n01:36:13.359 --> 01:36:18.800\nagain, trying to help me line up that\nmouse to be able to click and operate.\n\n1847\n01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.110\nHm.\n\n1848\n01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:22.461\nWe've got Enhance contrast in colors.\n\n1849\n01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:25.586\nYou'll see my screen goes mostly black and\nwhite.\n\n1850\n01:36:25.586 --> 01:36:31.752\nIf you have a visual impairment then this\nmake things really stand out, right.\n\n1851\n01:36:31.752 --> 01:36:37.136\nSo I know I had my Uncle Bud who had very,\nvery bad tunnel vision, and telling\n\n1852\n01:36:37.136 --> 01:36:42.710\nthe difference between subtle color\nvariations is not something he could do.\n\n1853\n01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:46.300\nUsing Enhance contrast\nin colors really helped.\n\n1854\n01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.850\nWe can also make text larger.\n\n1855\n01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:51.070\nI know a lot of people are doing that on\nhigh resolution monitors these days, and\n\n1856\n01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:53.050\nthat'll just make the general text bigger.\n\n1857\n01:36:53.050 --> 01:36:56.170\nThis is a great option, but\nit does cause problems with some software.\n\n1858\n01:36:56.170 --> 01:36:59.020\nA lot of software is not written\nto respect the setting and\n\n1859\n01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:00.120\nthat's an unfortunate thing.\n\n1860\n01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:03.710\nI do wish more software was\ncompatible with this stuff.\n\n1861\n01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:09.010\nBut you might see screen artifacts, things\nnot rendering properly, that does happen.\n\n1862\n01:37:09.010 --> 01:37:10.660\nAll right.\n\n1863\n01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:13.470\nYou'll see Sticky Keys is the next option.\n\n1864\n01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:15.990\nPress keyboard shortcuts\none key at a time.\n\n1865\n01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:20.820\nThat's where if I tap shift and let go,\nnow I'm actually holding the shift key,\n\n1866\n01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:22.250\neven though I'm not actually holding it.\n\n1867\n01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:25.690\nAnd with the very next key I press\nit'll enter it in as a capital letter.\n\n1868\n01:37:27.450 --> 01:37:30.880\nIgnore duplicate key presses,\nthat's the bounce keys and\n\n1869\n01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.330\nthen press and hold keys to accept them,\nthat's slow keys.\n\n1870\n01:37:34.330 --> 01:37:36.660\nSo in other words,\nif you just tap it that won't count.\n\n1871\n01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.340\nYou have to hold the key down\nbefore it registers it as a press.\n\n1872\n01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:45.360\nSo each of those are basically supporting\na different use case scenario.\n\n1873\n01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Now these options here,\nthese accessibility options,\n\n1874\n01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:51.795\nthese are baked into Gnome,\nwas that correct?\n\n1875\n01:37:51.795 --> 01:37:55.340\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yep, with the default packages\nthat we installed here in the OS.\n\n1876\n01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:55.847\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n1877\n01:37:55.847 --> 01:37:56.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n1878\n01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.706\nif I turn some of these things on.\nI'll go ahead and\n\n1879\n01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.920\nturn on, I'll do Sticky Keys.\n\n1880\n01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.940\nA lot of these have\nkeyboard shortcuts also.\n\n1881\n01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:06.770\nSo for example Sticky Keys,\nif I wanted to turn it on,\n\n1882\n01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:09.880\none of the things you can do is you\ncan tap the shift key five times.\n\n1883\n01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:12.590\nAnd when you tap it five times\nthat'll turn on Sticky Keys.\n\n1884\n01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:15.170\nSo, a lot of them have\nlittle shortcuts like that.\n\n1885\n01:38:15.170 --> 01:38:18.340\nAnd like everything in Linux there's\nalways more than one way to do stuff.\n\n1886\n01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:20.430\nThis is a really simple screen.\n\n1887\n01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:23.950\nIt's designed to get you what you need,\nso you can get logged in.\n\n1888\n01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:26.090\nOnce we're logged in,\nthere's actually more options.\n\n1889\n01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:26.950\nLet me show you those.\n\n1890\n01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:32.420\nSo I'm going to log in here, as dpizat,\nprobably need to punch in my password and\n\n1891\n01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:33.380\nnot my username.\n\n1892\n01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:35.050\nThere we go.\n\n1893\n01:38:35.050 --> 01:38:36.620\nSo I'll get logged in.\n\n1894\n01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:40.970\nOnce I'm logged in,\nI can go up to System, and\n\n1895\n01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:43.360\nPreferences and\nyou'll see Assistive Technologies.\n\n1896\n01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.805\nIt's the same icon the blue\ncircle with the stick man in it.\n\n1897\n01:38:45.805 --> 01:38:46.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n1898\n01:38:46.330 --> 01:38:50.110\n&gt;&gt; And when we fire that up here's\nwhere we can start to do some advanced\n\n1899\n01:38:50.110 --> 01:38:50.960\ncustomizations.\n\n1900\n01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:55.530\nFor example under Assistive Technologies\nI've got Preferred Applications.\n\n1901\n01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:57.172\nAnd here's where I can\nset my screen reader.\n\n1902\n01:38:57.172 --> 01:38:59.390\nSee how I've got Orca chosen?\n\n1903\n01:38:59.390 --> 01:39:04.020\nI can do Orca with Magnifier,\nGNOME Magnifier, KDE Magnifier.\n\n1904\n01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:07.425\nIf I had installed a third party one,\nI could choose custom and\n\n1905\n01:39:07.425 --> 01:39:11.470\nchoose that other screen reader,\nor my visual enhancement here.\n\n1906\n01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:15.480\nAny mobility options that I might need,\nlike the onscreen keyboard, we can set\n\n1907\n01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.750\nthem to run at start, so they're\nautomatically running and waiting for us.\n\n1908\n01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.615\nSo we've got various functionality there.\n\n1909\n01:39:20.615 --> 01:39:22.310\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n1910\n01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:23.730\nSo then Don, maybe this is, yeah.\n\n1911\n01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:28.790\nSo let's say that you don't\nhave GNOME installed, and\n\n1912\n01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:31.120\nyou are just running on\nthe straight up command line.\n\n1913\n01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.860\nIs there any kind of accessibility options\nthat we have just running like a straight\n\n1914\n01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:37.320\nup basic minimal install?\n\n1915\n01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.540\n&gt;&gt; It's much more limited,\nit's much more limited.\n\n1916\n01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.110\nI've never used that.\n\n1917\n01:39:41.110 --> 01:39:45.150\nSo from just a native command line,\na lot of this stuff,\n\n1918\n01:39:45.150 --> 01:39:48.240\nlike Orca depends on X Windows.\n\n1919\n01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.910\nAnd so it's really expecting to be in that\nGUI as part of the screen interpreter.\n\n1920\n01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:54.670\nThat's not to say that you can't.\n\n1921\n01:39:54.670 --> 01:39:55.680\nSomebody might make it.\n\n1922\n01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.530\nI'm just not familiar with it.\n\n1923\n01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:58.550\n&gt;&gt; Right on.\n\n1924\n01:39:58.550 --> 01:40:04.000\n&gt;&gt; My exposure, I personally don't have\na need for most of the assistive tools.\n\n1925\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.885\nMost of them.\nI do actually use one or two.\n\n1926\n01:40:05.885 --> 01:40:06.587\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n1927\n01:40:06.587 --> 01:40:07.640\n&gt;&gt; But for most of them.\n\n1928\n01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:10.520\nBut I know I grew up with my Aunt Maureen,\nwho was deaf.\n\n1929\n01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:14.690\nAnd that's where I got exposed to a lot\nof this was through her needs, and\n\n1930\n01:40:14.690 --> 01:40:16.430\nhelping her get things set up.\n\n1931\n01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:19.940\nAnd my Uncle Bud,\nwho was severely visually impaired.\n\n1932\n01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:23.740\nSo you know it may not be you that\nhas specific need for these, but\n\n1933\n01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:27.930\nlearning to support them, man it is\nworthwhile because the moment that you\n\n1934\n01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:32.090\nfind somebody who needs that help,\nwhen you can take away that obstacle and\n\n1935\n01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:35.510\nlet them use a computer,\nthat's big deal, that really is.\n\n1936\n01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:40.290\nSo, we'll see other options in here\nlike our Keyboard accessibility options.\n\n1937\n01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:43.422\nHere we can go in and manually, not just\nturn the options on, but tweak them.\n\n1938\n01:40:43.422 --> 01:40:48.380\nSo like Slow Keys, how long do you have\nto hold the key for before it registers?\n\n1939\n01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:52.288\nOr Bounce Keys, how long do you wait\nto invalidate a double press, right?\n\n1940\n01:40:52.288 --> 01:40:57.490\nCuz that can get annoying if you're typing\na word like bookkeeper that has double Os,\n\n1941\n01:40:57.490 --> 01:41:00.500\ndouble Ks, double Es all in a row, right.\n\n1942\n01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:04.160\nIf you've got Bounce Keys turned on it's\nfrustrating to type a word like that.\n\n1943\n01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.690\nSo, adjusting those values.\n\n1944\n01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:07.930\nYou've also got things like Mouse Keys.\n\n1945\n01:41:07.930 --> 01:41:11.320\nSee how I've got Pointer can be\ncontrolled using the keypad?\n\n1946\n01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:15.080\nThat lets you use the arrow keys on your\nkeypad to move the mouse pointer instead\n\n1947\n01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:16.000\nof using your mouse.\n\n1948\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.291\nThat's a neat feature,\nif a mouse is not something you wanna use.\n\n1949\n01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:22.800\nYou can also do Typing Break.\n\n1950\n01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:25.780\nThis one I've never used,\nI think it's more for controlling kids.\n\n1951\n01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:30.810\nBut if you're worried about fatigue,\nif you don't want to\n\n1952\n01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:33.890\nhave somebody using a keyboard for\ntoo long, you can set it to lock\n\n1953\n01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:37.050\nyour workstation after a certain period\nof time and hold it locked for a while.\n\n1954\n01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:42.870\nSo basically enforcing breaks so that\nyou don't wear yourself out, all right?\n\n1955\n01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:44.570\nYou'll see a lot of other options in here.\n\n1956\n01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:47.190\nReally it is just a ton of options.\n\n1957\n01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:49.780\nAnd so it's a matter of finding\nthe ones that are right for\n\n1958\n01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:52.050\nthe scenario that you need.\n\n1959\n01:41:52.050 --> 01:41:56.470\n&gt;&gt; Having that one mouse one where you can\ncontrol your mouse cursor with the arrow\n\n1960\n01:41:56.470 --> 01:42:00.700\nkeys, I find that at times on my XPS,\nwhere I need something like that to help\n\n1961\n01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:02.126\nme get around the little-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because\n\n1962\n01:42:02.126 --> 01:42:02.670\nyour touch pad is so bad.\n\n1963\n01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:04.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, the touch pad on there.\n\n1964\n01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:04.970\nOn this one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n1965\n01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:09.050\nIt just goes to show these assistive\ntechnologies, they're for everyone.\n\n1966\n01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:10.180\nAnybody can benefit from these.\n\n1967\n01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:14.130\nAnybody who is having difficulties\ninteracting with that desktop.\n\n1968\n01:42:14.130 --> 01:42:17.810\nBecause just because there's\na common use scenario\n\n1969\n01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:20.020\ndoesn't mean that's the use\nscenario that fits for you.\n\n1970\n01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.790\nYou may need to adjust\nthings to meet your needs.\n\n1971\n01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:23.630\nAll right.\n\n1972\n01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:27.180\nSo those are the basics of\nthe assistive technologies.\n\n1973\n01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:28.720\nThere are more out there.\n\n1974\n01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:30.400\nThere's tons, third party ones.\n\n1975\n01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:33.390\nThere's a lot of great websites out there\nthat catalog different software that's\n\n1976\n01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:35.770\navailable and you can make use of that.\n\n1977\n01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:39.420\nDon't ever feel like you shouldn't\nbe able to use a computer.\n\n1978\n01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:42.419\nThere's the tools to make it happen, it's\njust a matter of putting them together.\n\n1979\n01:42:42.419 --> 01:42:46.843\nAnd unfortunately a lot of vendors out\nthere haven't taken the time to make their\n\n1980\n01:42:46.843 --> 01:42:49.966\nsoftware compliant and so\nit may be a bit of a challenge but\n\n1981\n01:42:49.966 --> 01:42:51.479\nit can definitely be done.\n\n1982\n01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:54.202\n&gt;&gt; All right, nice.\n\n1983\n01:42:54.202 --> 01:42:57.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I think that's\nabout it for assistive technologies.\n\n1984\n01:42:57.530 --> 01:43:01.570\nAnd really that's about it for\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n1985\n01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:06.340\nRemember the GUI only makes\nup 8% of the second exam.\n\n1986\n01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:07.920\nSo the first exam is all CLI.\n\n1987\n01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:12.378\nThe second Exam is 92% CLI.\n\n1988\n01:43:12.378 --> 01:43:14.790\nSo we don't spend a ton of time in here.\n\n1989\n01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:17.160\nSo we're just gonna have the one\nepisode here on the GUI.\n\n1990\n01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.110\nI think we've covered\na decent bit of stuff.\n\n1991\n01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:22.100\nMost of the things people\nwant to know anyway.\n\n1992\n01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:23.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n1993\n01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:28.750\nwell let me just remind everybody that if\nyou ever have any questions on this stuff,\n\n1994\n01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:31.360\nlive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1995\n01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.560\nYou'll see the chat box\nright

in\n\n2005\n01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:58.240\nthere to do some more answers, but\nwe do monitor and answer there.\n\n2006\n01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:01.880\nWe wanna make sure you guys have the\nanswers you need to be able to study and\n\n2007\n01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.120\nbe successful on that exam.\n\n2008\n01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.430\nYou should never go into\nan exam with questions, right.\n\n2009\n01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:07.040\nThat's not the way you wanna go about it.\n\n2010\n01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.695\nSo, they'll have plenty of them\nin the exam room for you already.\n\n2011\n01:44:09.695 --> 01:44:11.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n2012\n01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.770\nWell, I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n2013\n01:44:12.770 -->

and welcome back.\n\n4\n00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:39,419\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,881\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:42,647\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:44,040\n>> I am saddened this morning.\n\n8\n00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,927\nI did not get on Kim Kardashian's wedding\nlist for the summer event of the year.\n\n9\n00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,587\n>> Didn't she already get married?\n\n10\n00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:51,644\n>> No, apparently not.\n\n11\n00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:54,361\n>> Are you telling me they had\na kid before they got married?\n\n12\n00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:54,907\nThat happens?\n\n13\n00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:55,870\n>> Yes, yes that happens.\n\n14\n00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,345\n>> That's shocking news.\n\n15\n00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:02,301\nKim Kardashian, she is a never\nending source of entertainment.\n\n16\n00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:03,462\n>> That's right.\n\n17\n00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:08,184\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well since there's\na big wedding that's being planned,\n\n18\n00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:11,811\nobviously, one of the big deals\nthat you deal with there.\n\n19\n00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:17,249\nThat is a project right there, even for a\nnormal person's wedding, not little note.\n\n20\n00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:20,005\n>> When Jay Z made it and\nI didn't make it, I was shocked.\n\n21\n00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:23,208\n>> [LAUGH] Even for\na D-list actress, there's a lot.\n\n22\n00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,032\nIs she an actress?\n\n23\n00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:25,590\nWhat is she?\n\n24\n00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,260\n>> Who knows?\n>> Yeah, I'm sorry.\n\n25\n00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,810\nSo, anyhow, one of the big aspects\nwe deal with is scheduling, and\n\n26\n00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,480\nthat's what we were doing in the last\nepisode, which was planning project, or\n\n27\n00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,890\nplanning our schedule really, and it was\npart one, we got through some good stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,050\nLet me pull up the process list here.\n\n29\n00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,770\nSo basically we were in\nthe planning process group, and\n\n30\n00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,170\nwe were dealing with\nproject time management.\n\n31\n00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,710\nWe took a look at the schedule management\nplan, defining our activities,\n\n32\n00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,520\nsequencing our activities, and\nestimating our activity resources.\n\n33\n00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,860\nNow that last one we didn't spend\na ton of time on, because down here,\n\n34\n00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,390\nwe've got our human resource management,\nso\n\n35\n00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,200\nreally, up here,\nwe're just thinking more like materials.\n\n36\n00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,730\nAnd even then, with materials,\nyou focus a little more on cost.\n\n37\n00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,860\nSo that one kinda gets broken up\ninto the other two a little more.\n\n38\n00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,380\nAll right, but today, today we're\ngonna hit the hard stuff, right?\n\n39\n00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,387\nAnd I'm not talking about the alcohol\nthat Ronnie drinks for breakfast.\n\n40\n00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,883\nI'm talking about-\n>> That's true.\n\n41\n00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:23,947\n>> [LAUGH] Estimating activity\ndurations and developing the schedule.\n\n42\n00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:29,705\nThese two processes are the main\nones in this process group.\n\n43\n00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:33,739\nThis is where we're gonna spend a lot\nof time and, sadly, these two processes\n\n44\n00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,297\nare what most people think of when\nthey think of project management.\n\n45\n00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,600\nThey don't think of\nthe other 45 processes.\n\n46\n00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,130\nThey think of these two right here.\n\n47\n00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,460\nThe project manager is building\na calendar, who does what, when.\n\n48\n00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,550\nWell, that's kinda what we\ntackle right here, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,280\nSo these are a big deal.\n\n50\n00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,260\nWe created a list of activities yesterday,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,690\nSo here's all the activities\nour project needs.\n\n52\n00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,114\nAnd then we sequence them,\nwhat order do they need to follow, and\n\n53\n00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:01,619\nwhat activities are dependent\non what other activities, right?\n\n54\n00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:04,588\nDo we have finish to start relationships,\nstart to start relationships,\n\n55\n00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:05,775\nall those different things.\n\n56\n00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:13,050\nNow we need to go through and figure out\nhow long each one is going to take, right?\n\n57\n00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,410\nSo, when we start to do\na project management plan,\n\n58\n00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,452\nand we start laying out our project,\nI'm using different software today.\n\n59\n00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:23,250\nI'm gonna try and rotate through\ndifferent software throughout the show.\n\n60\n00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,200\nSo I was using GanttProject yesterday,\n\n61\n00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,750\nwhich is free open source software,\nbut it's very basic.\n\n62\n00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,420\nAnd if you're just looking for basic\nproject management that software is great.\n\n63\n00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,190\nThis one is called ProjectLibre,\n\n64\n00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,840\nit's another open source\nproject software out there.\n\n65\n00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,370\nAnd it's free, runs on Mac,\nWindows, Linux, whatever, and\n\n66\n00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,960\nit's designed to be a little\nmore close to Microsoft Project.\n\n67\n00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,700\nSo it's got some more advanced features,\nwhich I need for today's show, so\n\n68\n00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,430\nwe had to move away from GanttProject.\n\n69\n00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,110\nSo, here I've got a bunch of\nactivities thrown in, and you'll see,\n\n70\n00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,480\nit defaults to just one day for\nevery activity, and\n\n71\n00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,330\nthat's very common with\nproject management software.\n\n72\n00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,120\nAnd see how it's got a little\nquestion mark by each one.\n\n73\n00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,980\nOne day question mark.\n\n74\n00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,830\nThat means that it's an estimate, and\nby default a lot of software will treat\n\n75\n00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,400\neverything as an estimate,\nuntil you tell it otherwise.\n\n76\n00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,800\nSo you can see down here where\nI created activities, and\n\n77\n00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,390\nthey don't have question marks.\n\n78\n00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,530\nThese are ones where I told it,\nthis is not an estimate anymore, this is,\n\n79\n00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,390\nor it may still be an estimate but it's my\nfinal estimate, I can't get any better.\n\n80\n00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,550\nSo this is the number that\nwe're gonna work with.\n\n81\n00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,480\nThat's just a visual cue to let you\nremember which ones might still need to be\n\n82\n00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,110\nrevised, ones that might be influxed,\njust a little question mark.\n\n83\n00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,230\nYou'll also see that I've got\na few that are set to zero days.\n\n84\n00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,582\nNow why would I have one set to zero days?\n\n85\n00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:47,310\nA zero-day activity, or a zero-hour or\nwhatever, is not a work activity but\n\n86\n00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,380\nsome kind of tracking activity\nmost commonly a milestone.\n\n87\n00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,520\nAnd so\nyou'll see I've got milestone one here and\n\n88\n00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,510\nit's represented as a black diamond,\nthat's what most project software does.\n\n89\n00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,940\nPMI doesn't have an official icon for\nthat.\n\n90\n00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,690\nThat's just what most\nproject software sticks with.\n\n91\n00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,050\nHere, that computer example we\ngave yesterday, we're going to\n\n92\n00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,300\nreceive 400 computers, we're gonna unbox\nthe computers, we're gonna set them up.\n\n93\n00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,190\nWhen that's done, the hardware is ready.\n\n94\n00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,050\nAnd so I created a milestone that\nsays right here on June 16th,\n\n95\n00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,540\nour hardware will be ready.\n\n96\n00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,080\nAll right, do we hit that milestone or\ndo we fall behind schedule?\n\n97\n00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,470\nDo we not get there, right, where are we\nat in terms of hitting that milestone?\n\n98\n00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,747\nAnd we're gonna talk when we get\ninto the monitoring control phase,\n\n99\n00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:38,480\nhow we track our progress to see if\nwe're gonna hit that milestone, right?\n\n100\n00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,130\nSo we may create those, but\nmilestones are not really activities,\n\n101\n00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,280\nthey don't have a duration.\n\n102\n00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,970\nThey're just an event that occurs,\n\n103\n00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,300\nwe don't really have to do\nanything as a part of that event.\n\n104\n00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:50,010\nAll right, so\nas we start to map these things out,\n\n105\n00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,840\nwe may just be putting them all in as one\nday when we're sequencing the event just\n\n106\n00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,610\ntrying to figure out the order.\n\n107\n00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,700\nNow we need to come back and\nadd how long they're truly going to take.\n\n108\n00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,670\nAnd we'll find there's a lot of factors\ninvolved in determining that duration.\n\n109\n00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,935\nSo, PMI's made a nice little process for\nus, which is not this.\n\n110\n00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which is this right here.\n\n111\n00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,100\nEstimate Activity Durations.\n\n112\n00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,240\nAnd this is just a collection\nof tools that are available for\n\n113\n00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,340\nus to use to go in and try and figure\nout how long things are going to take.\n\n114\n00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,490\nNow, to make good decisions you\nneed good information, right?\n\n115\n00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,942\nYou need as much\ninformation as you can get.\n\n116\n00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:36,260\nAnd it's from a book,\nI can't remember what book it was,\n\n117\n00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,550\nprobably a Dune book\ncuz I read those a lot.\n\n118\n00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,980\nBut it was from a book where they said\nlike, too much information never makes for\n\n119\n00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,450\neasy decisions, right?\n\n120\n00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,280\nSo sometimes the more information you\nhave the harder it is to make a decision\n\n121\n00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,040\nbecause you keep finding out things\nthat you just don't know enough about.\n\n122\n00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,600\nSo there are limits,\nthe information that we get.\n\n123\n00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,972\nBut when you look at this process the\nfirst thing you'll probably notice is just\n\n124\n00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:00,951\nthe record setting amount of inputs,\nright?\n\n125\n00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:02,831\nWhen you go to estimate durations,\n\n126\n00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:05,595\nyou need information from\nevery source you can get.\n\n127\n00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:10,675\nAt a minimum you're going to\nneed your activity list, right?\n\n128\n00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:13,025\nBecause you need to know\nwhat activities to plan for.\n\n129\n00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:16,240\nAnd that activity list might be your\nlist that you created if you did\n\n130\n00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360\nthe dedicated list.\n\n131\n00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,630\nIt might be your work breakdown\nstructure if you just did that.\n\n132\n00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,610\nOr it might be that you've already fired\nup your project management software and\n\n133\n00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,040\nsequenced your activities there.\n\n134\n00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,430\nSo that's your list, right?\n\n135\n00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,160\nBut one way or\n\n136\n00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,830\nanother, you need a list of all the\nactivities that are going to occur, right?\n\n137\n00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,280\nIt's definitely a good idea to also\nhave activity resource requirements,\n\n138\n00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,900\nbecause if I have three activities\nthat are occurring all in a row, and\n\n139\n00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,320\nit's the same employee\nattached to all activities, or\n\n140\n00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,880\nall three of those,\nthey've gotta happen one after the other.\n\n141\n00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,530\nI can't run them at the same time.\n\n142\n00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,480\nI should have already figured that\nout when we sequenced, but, if not,\n\n143\n00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,490\nwe can see it here, too, if we've got\nour resource requirements, all right?\n\n144\n00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,210\nOther things like resource calendars,\nif I have that employee,\n\n145\n00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,560\nwhen are they available?\n\n146\n00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,464\nThey have different schedules.\n\n147\n00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:02,751\nDifferent people have different\nschedules that we have to track.\n\n148\n00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,643\nOur project scope statement,\nwhich is kind of\n\n149\n00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:08,970\na higher level activity list\n>> But the project scope statement is\n\n150\n00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,423\ngonna specify things like\ndates we need to be aware of.\n\n151\n00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:15,290\nThe project needs to be done by this date.\n\n152\n00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,760\nWhen I'm calculating my durations and\n\n153\n00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,220\nstuff, I always need to keep that scope\nstatement or the schedule specification in\n\n154\n00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,810\nthe scope statement,\nin the front of my mind, all right.\n\n155\n00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,320\nOur risk register,\nwhich we haven't created yet\n\n156\n00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,260\nbecause that's gonna show us\nsome of the risks we have and\n\n157\n00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,510\nthe mitigations, what we can do\nif there's a failure, right?\n\n158\n00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:39,600\nSo, if I'm planning an outdoor\nrock concert and it rains,\n\n159\n00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,180\nwe may have to postpone that rock concert\nand put it on again a month later.\n\n160\n00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,300\nWell what's that going\nto do to my schedule?\n\n161\n00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,220\nIt's going to blow it out of the water,\nright?\n\n162\n00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,900\nBut if I've got it in\nthe risk register and\n\n163\n00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,180\nI see that,\nI can work that into my schedule.\n\n164\n00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,660\nAnd now it's an expected value and it's\nnot gonna ruin my project if it rains.\n\n165\n00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,360\nWe plan for that.\n\n166\n00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,060\nIf it rains, we go back a month.\n\n167\n00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,460\nThat's just how it is, right.\n\n168\n00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,220\nAnd it becomes part of the process.\n\n169\n00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,410\nThe resource breakdown structure,\nwe may or may not have created this, but\n\n170\n00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,860\njust like the work breakdown\nstructures listing the people and\n\n171\n00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,120\nwhat activities are attached to them and\nthen our favorites, right.\n\n172\n00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,570\nEnterprise environmental factors and\norganizational process assets.\n\n173\n00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,050\nSo this is really anything\nthat relates to activities\n\n174\n00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,160\nthat are gonna happen\nas part of our project.\n\n175\n00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,552\nAlright now we take that data and\nwe sift it through a number of techniques.\n\n176\n00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:29,920\nWe're gonna see expert judgment because\nthat one's pretty much always there right.\n\n177\n00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,300\nUse your noodle, use your brain and\nmake sure you make good decisions.\n\n178\n00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,560\nBut the other ones that are on here,\n\n179\n00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,400\nthese are estimation techniques,\nand we're gonna see them here for\n\n180\n00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,930\nestimating duration, but we're gonna\nsee them again for estimating cost.\n\n181\n00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,480\nIt's the same technique, right?\n\n182\n00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,120\nEstimating is estimating.\n\n183\n00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,190\nSo you pretty much have the same methods.\n\n184\n00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,790\nIt's just the data you work with\nthat's different and that's it.\n\n185\n00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,930\nSo this is very similar to what\nwe're gonna have with cost.\n\n186\n00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,050\nAll right,\nthe first one is probably the easiest and\n\n187\n00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,740\nit's called analogous estimating, right.\n\n188\n00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,070\nIt's one of my favorites.\n\n189\n00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,640\nIf you're about to build a house and\nit's 2400 square feet, right.\n\n190\n00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,150\nYou can go out and\nmaybe within your company or\n\n191\n00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,250\nwithin other companies and find.\n\n192\n00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,540\nSomeone else who just finished building\na 2400 square foot house with the same\n\n193\n00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,670\nplans, how long did it take them, right.\n\n194\n00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,510\nThere you go,\nuse their numbers as your numbers.\n\n195\n00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,070\nYou can find another project or somebody\nwhose done the same work that you're about\n\n196\n00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,100\nto set out to do and use their number.\n\n197\n00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100\nIt's kind, it's almost cheating, right?\n\n198\n00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But they've already been through it.\n\n199\n00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,040\nThey went through it in real life,\nyou haven't necessarily at this point.\n\n200\n00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,250\nSo you're using their data.\n\n201\n00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,340\nIt can be really handy\nas far as shaving down\n\n202\n00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,120\nthe amount of time it\ntakes us to estimate.\n\n203\n00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,250\nThey're not even really estimates anymore,\nnow it's based on factual data.\n\n204\n00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,030\nThis is how long it took them, that's\nprobably how long it will take us right.\n\n205\n00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,940\nSo analogous estimating is great unless\nyou're doing something brand new.\n\n206\n00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,410\nIf nobody else has done it well it's\npretty hard to use their numbers.\n\n207\n00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,850\nAll right, so\nthat is analogous estimating.\n\n208\n00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,020\nIt's my favorite.\n\n209\n00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,530\nIt takes the least amount of time and it's\nthe most reliable so it really is like\n\n210\n00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:19,310\nthe Holy Grail of estimating techniques,\nif it's available, all right.\n\n211\n00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,750\nIf it's not available, then we go to all\nthese other ones that are listed here.\n\n212\n00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,930\nWell, except reserve analysis.\n\n213\n00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,640\nThat one's always there.\n\n214\n00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,260\nSo the next one is parametric, all right.\n\n215\n00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,230\nNow, parametric estimating,\nit sounds like something complex, but\n\n216\n00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,290\nit's really not that big of a deal,\nand that is,\n\n217\n00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,300\nyou effectively hire somebody\nto figure it out for you, right.\n\n218\n00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,900\nAnd by hiring somebody I mean,\nyou might have software,\n\n219\n00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,130\nestimation software that\ndoes the estimate for you.\n\n220\n00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,860\nYou might use somebody like, I think I\nmentioned the Gardner Group in an episode.\n\n221\n00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,690\nSo you might have them where they\nhave other projects they look at and\n\n222\n00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,470\ninformation they know from the market.\n\n223\n00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,340\nAnd they look at your data, right,\nthe parameters of your project and\n\n224\n00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,110\nthey calculate out what they\nthink it's gonna take and\n\n225\n00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,770\nthey tell you that estimation data.\n\n226\n00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,840\nSo, parametric is really just where\nwe rely on some sort of external data\n\n227\n00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,770\nto come up with our estimate.\n\n228\n00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,860\nAnd you see this most often\nwith estimation software.\n\n229\n00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,960\nEvery good construction company.\n\n230\n00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,070\nUses estimation software,\ncuz every project they do,\n\n231\n00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,210\nevery building is a little bit different.\n\n232\n00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,500\nIf you're building a 20 story office\nbuilding, or you're building a 25 story\n\n233\n00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,235\noffice building, it's not that\nit's just 20% more construction.\n\n234\n00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:34,845\nIt's different things, different\nmaterials, different weight loads, and so\n\n235\n00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:37,315\nyou need software to be\nable to manage that.\n\n236\n00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:39,895\n>> Yeah,\nthe nice thing about the idea of this is,\n\n237\n00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:42,035\nwe provide whatever we're asked of, right.\n\n238\n00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:44,050\nSo, we hire a consulting group, they say,\n\n239\n00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,260\nall right, what are the parameters\nthat we need to work with?\n\n240\n00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,420\nAnd then they figure it all out and\nthen we get the results back.\n\n241\n00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,850\nSo it really does work out for us,\nespecially if we're doing that.\n\n242\n00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,410\nAnd that's what all that type\nof software really does for us.\n\n243\n00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,290\nWe just have to know what\nit is we really want.\n\n244\n00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,680\n>> Yeah.\n\n245\n00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,400\nAll right, now,\nwhat if we are doing something so\n\n246\n00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,110\nnew that there's nobody out there\nwith estimation software for this.\n\n247\n00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,110\nOur business is such a niche business\nthat nobody else is doing this, and\n\n248\n00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,120\nso there's no historical stuff for\nus to do analogous estimating.\n\n249\n00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,690\nThere's no companies out there doing\nthe estimates for us to do parametric.\n\n250\n00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,880\nSo we're kinda left to our own, all right?\n\n251\n00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,340\nWell, there's a neat,\nsimple principle that we can use,\n\n252\n00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,745\ncalled three-point estimating, all right?\n\n253\n00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:29,040\nThree-point estimating is\nthe last of the mathematically\n\n254\n00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,988\nsound ones that we have before\nwe start shooting in the dark.\n\n255\n00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:32,068\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n256\n00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:36,790\nthree-point estimating is kind of a neat\nlittle formula, and it comes in two forms,\n\n257\n00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,970\nbut they work on the same principle.\n\n258\n00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,090\nLet me bring up my notes screen here.\n\n259\n00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,320\nWe'll just do it like a blank note for\nnow, all right.\n\n260\n00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,000\nSo I wanna talk about three-point\nestimates, all right.\n\n261\n00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,970\nBasically, what you do,\nis you get three people\n\n262\n00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,360\nto come up with their best guess for\nhow long something is gonna take.\n\n263\n00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,680\nSo you go to your subject matter expert,\nif you've got one on staff.\n\n264\n00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,390\nOr maybe it's a web development project\nand you have three web developers and so\n\n265\n00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,290\nyou get opinions from each of them.\n\n266\n00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,990\nOr if it's outside,\nyou're hiring contractors, you get.\n\n267\n00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,200\nQuotes from three different contractors.\n\n268\n00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,980\nGet three opinions at a minimum, right.\n\n269\n00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,130\nYou can get more, but\nat a minimum get three.\n\n270\n00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,140\nAnd you're gonna classify\nthe three like this,\n\n271\n00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,280\nI'll use the official ones,\nyou have the most likely.\n\n272\n00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,440\nYou have the most optimistic and\n\n273\n00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,260\nyou have the most pessimistic,\nwhich is spelled wrong, there, okay.\n\n274\n00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,600\nSo when you go to somebody, you say,\nall right web developer number one,\n\n275\n00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,580\nwhat do you think is the best case\nscenario, worst case scenario?\n\n276\n00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,120\nAnd the most likely amount of\ntime that this is gonna take.\n\n277\n00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,640\nAnd I do this in networking all the time,\nis I say okay, we're gonna be installing\n\n278\n00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,990\nsome MPOS lines between five cities and we\nneed to get that networked out, all right.\n\n279\n00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,930\nIf the ISPs have done their job and\nI walk into that building,\n\n280\n00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,590\nand the MPLS lines are in place, and all\nI've gotta do is configure the routers,\n\n281\n00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,640\nI can have that job done in one day, easy.\n\n282\n00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,760\nSo, my most optimistic would be one day,\nokay.\n\n283\n00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:29,520\nBut if the ISP screwed up and they didn't\neven put the order in and the MPLS\n\n284\n00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,720\nline isn't deposited I know that it\ntakes 60 days to get a MPLS sign put in.\n\n285\n00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,630\nAnd so at a most pessimistic\nit could take 61 days.\n\n286\n00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,290\nSo I recognize that it wasn't installed,\nI put in a new order,\n\n287\n00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,580\nwait 60 days and then I go out and\nthere's the one day of work that I can do.\n\n288\n00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,800\nThat would be the worst case scenario,\nthey completely drop the ball, all right.\n\n289\n00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,704\nBut more likely, all the orders will go\nin, I'll get down there, and maybe one or\n\n290\n00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,635\ntwo of the cities just\naren't connected right.\n\n291\n00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:03,314\nAnd so, I've gotta do a help desk ticket,\nI gotta reach out and\n\n292\n00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:07,843\nkinda do some troubleshooting, and so\nmaybe- Four days is the most likely.\n\n293\n00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:12,095\nI say, it'd probably be one day of work,\nbut give me a couple of extra days to\n\n294\n00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:16,930\ndeal with support tickets and stuff just\nto get it all squared away and in place.\n\n295\n00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,820\nAnd maybe there might be\nan option where I have to go to\n\n296\n00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,180\none of the other cities to fix it so\nI need some flight time.\n\n297\n00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,040\nSo let's just say four\ndays as the most likely.\n\n298\n00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,710\nAll right.\n\n299\n00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,060\nSo, here's my three quotes for\nhow long this is gonna take.\n\n300\n00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,860\nMy most optimistic would be one day.\n\n301\n00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,530\nMy most likely is four days.\n\n302\n00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,760\nMy most pessimistic is 61 days, all right?\n\n303\n00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,970\nWe can then feed this into a formula and\nif I get quotes from more than one person,\n\n304\n00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,790\nI take their most likely and I average\nthem, I take their most optimistic and\n\n305\n00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,590\naverage them and their most\npessimistic and average them and\n\n306\n00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,930\nI like to get estimates from three people,\nminimum.\n\n307\n00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,680\nThat's something I learned in\nstatistics a long time ago.\n\n308\n00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,670\nAnd so\nyou may want to get multiple quotes.\n\n309\n00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,260\nIf you've got multiple people.\n\n310\n00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:06,210\nBut if I'm the only tech available to do\nit, then you'll just take what I say.\n\n311\n00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,130\nAnd then we take this and\nwe feed it through one or two formulas.\n\n312\n00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,290\nThe two formulas work like this,\n\n313\n00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:20,220\nthere is the Triangular Distribution and\n\n314\n00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,890\nthere is the Beta Distribution\nwhich is the more common.\n\n315\n00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:32,230\nAnd what they do is they take most likely,\nwhich is abbreviated tM,\n\n316\n00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,900\nmost optimistic, which is tO, and\n\n317\n00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,180\nmost pessimistic, is tP.\n\n318\n00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,020\nThere T for time, and\n\n319\n00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,000\nthen you've got your,\nactually, is most likely M?\n\n320\n00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,500\nIt is, okay.\n\n321\n00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,010\nAll right, and so you have M, O,\nand P for these other ones, right?\n\n322\n00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,480\nAnd we run them through a simple formula.\n\n323\n00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,870\nWith a Triangular Distribution,\nwe really just end up averaging the three.\n\n324\n00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:09,676\nSo the way the formula works is like this,\n\n325\n00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:15,955\nwe say tM + tO + tP divided/3.\n\n326\n00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:17,040\nOkay.\n\n327\n00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,880\nSo we add the three values and\nthen we divide them by three.\n\n328\n00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,810\nThat's just averaging right?\n\n329\n00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,220\n>> Yeah.\nWhen you take an average,\n\n330\n00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,510\nyou add the numbers together and you\ntake however many numbers there were and\n\n331\n00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,080\ndivide it by that number.\n\n332\n00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,030\nThat's an average.\n\n333\n00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,090\nSo this is gonna give\nus a average estimate.\n\n334\n00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,950\nAnd in our scenario this would be 4 days\n\n335\n00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,970\nplus 1 day plus 61 days.\n\n336\n00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,670\nDivided by three which is gonna\nequal something that I can't\n\n337\n00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,700\nfigure out in my head.\n\n338\n00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,820\nSo let's fire up our calculator.\n\n339\n00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:56,820\nAnd we'll say 4+1+61 and\nthen we'll divide that by three.\n\n340\n00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,569\nSo 22 days will be the result of this\nif we do a triangular distribution.\n\n341\n00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:02,100\nRight?\n\n342\n00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,880\nThe problem with doing\na triangular distribution\n\n343\n00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,360\nis it doesn't handle outliers very well.\n\n344\n00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,540\nAll right.\n\n345\n00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,270\nAnd you'll see here one day,\nfour day, 61 days.\n\n346\n00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,570\nThat's so far out there that\nit's skewing this pretty bad.\n\n347\n00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:22,470\nWhen my most likely is four days,\nbut I planned for\n\n348\n00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,060\n22, that's pretty big\noverkill right there.\n\n349\n00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,200\nSo that's the problem with\nthe triangular distribution,\n\n350\n00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,460\nit doesn't handle it very well.\n\n351\n00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,155\nSo instead with a beta distribution,\nwe modify it a little bit, okay?\n\n352\n00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:39,175\nWhat we do is we basically add\na weight to the most likely.\n\n353\n00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:42,095\nWe make the most likely more important.\n\n354\n00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:45,345\nAnd we do that by multiplying it by four.\n\n355\n00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:48,215\nAnd you'll see the formula\nwritten two different ways.\n\n356\n00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:51,585\nYou'll see it written this way,\nwhich is, here, I'll just take this one.\n\n357\n00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,492\nAnd do a little copy and paste action.\n\n358\n00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:55,190\nAll right.\n\n359\n00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,250\nSo we take that most likely and\n\n360\n00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,850\nyou can write it out,\nactually I usually see it this way.\n\n361\n00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:07,216\nWhere you've got\nthe optimistic plus the most\n\n362\n00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:11,910\nlikely and\nthen we just do that four times.\n\n363\n00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,700\nWe come in here and say,\none, two, three, four.\n\n364\n00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,560\nAnd then we divide the whole thing by six.\n\n365\n00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,090\nSo, the optimistic is counted once,\nthe pessimistic is counted once, and\n\n366\n00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,850\nthe most likely is counted four times.\n\n367\n00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,567\nAnd a simpler way to write that,\nis to just take these and\n\n368\n00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:37,787\nmake it four times The most likely,\nand I could\n\n369\n00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:42,700\ndo more parentheses, I guess, but order\nof operations would be correct there.\n\n370\n00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,250\nSo, the optimistic plus 4 times the most\nlikely, plus the pessimistic divided by 6.\n\n371\n00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,540\nIt's the same formula,\njust different way of writing it.\n\n372\n00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,546\nAll right, so for\n\n373\n00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:59,560\nus it would be 4 is the most likely so\n\n374\n00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,772\nit would be 1 + 4 x 4 + 61,\n\n375\n00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:07,990\nall divided by 6.\n\n376\n00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:13,270\nAnd in this scenario,\nthat is going to equal what?\n\n377\n00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,522\nSo let's get back to our calculator.\n\n378\n00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:24,510\nAll right, so it's 1 plus 16 plus\n61 divided by 6 which is 13.\n\n379\n00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:29,760\nAnd what you'll see here\nis we use the same numbers.\n\n380\n00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,100\nBut because we gave more weight,\nmore value to the most likely number,\n\n381\n00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,950\nthe most likely estimate, it's brought our\nnumber down from 22 days down to 13 days.\n\n382\n00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,310\nAnd most people find that this is\na much more accurate number, right?\n\n383\n00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,700\nThat going 13 days,\nit's still overkill in most scenarios,\n\n384\n00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,660\nbut at least it's only\noverkill by nine days.\n\n385\n00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,820\nIf the most likely occurs,\n\n386\n00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,220\nwe're only over by nine days here\nversus up here we're over by 18 days.\n\n387\n00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,140\nSo almost twice, exactly twice\nthe amount of time for our overage.\n\n388\n00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,350\nSo it is a little more accurate\nto go with the beta distribution.\n\n389\n00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,030\nAnd so you'll see most people refer\nto this method right here, and\n\n390\n00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,230\nit's usually the one that\nmakes it on the exam.\n\n391\n00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,210\nBut the triangular distribution\nis the rawest form of this.\n\n392\n00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,020\nThese are all called three point estimates\nbecause we've got three points right here.\n\n393\n00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,890\nMost likely, most optimistic,\nmost pessimistic, all right.\n\n394\n00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,950\nAnd you can remember this simple mnemonic\nis MOP so those are the three points.\n\n395\n00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,790\nAnd then we just run them\nthrough a simple average.\n\n396\n00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,240\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n397\n00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,290\nthis is good if we're doing\nsomething all new, right.\n\n398\n00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,850\nThere's just so many unknowns.\n\n399\n00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,960\nThat you gotta work with\nthe information that you have.\n\n400\n00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,010\nSo you get that best case scenario, worst\ncase scenario and the likely estimate.\n\n401\n00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,730\nNow there are some people who say,\nyou know what?\n\n402\n00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,320\nLet's just go with the likely.\n\n403\n00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,080\nAnd if there's going to be an overage,\nmaybe we can plan for\n\n404\n00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,390\nthat in our schedule reserve.\n\n405\n00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,540\nAnd so we'll talk about\nthat here in a little bit.\n\n406\n00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,390\nBut you can go that route, remember it's\nentirely up to you on your estimates\n\n407\n00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,340\nbecause even if I go 13 days,\nmy most pessimistic is 61.\n\n408\n00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,130\nI could still end up going 61 days so\nI'm still gonna be way over.\n\n409\n00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,630\nSo, it may not make a difference for\nme if I go four days versus 13.\n\n410\n00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,230\nSo we always need to evaluate\nthat as we go with the estimate.\n\n411\n00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,190\nBut that is a three point estimate.\n\n412\n00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,130\nAll right.\n\n413\n00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,950\nLet me take that and move that inside\nof our show notes for this one.\n\n414\n00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,850\nSo let's see.\nWe've got our three point estimates\n\n415\n00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,980\nhere, so.\n\n416\n00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,410\nYes, we've got those various values,\ntriangular, beta,\n\n417\n00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,330\nand, I'm just going to throw\nit in here as a example.\n\n418\n00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,544\nNo, wait it's in the notes\n\n419\n00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:54,810\nAll right, okay, so\nthose are some easy to use tools, right.\n\n420\n00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,390\nNow, there are some other\nthings that we can use and\n\n421\n00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,080\nit kinda comes down to desperation, right.\n\n422\n00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,138\nIf we get to a point where we\njust don't have good data, right,\n\n423\n00:24:03,138 --> 00:24:04,479\nyou gotta make a decision.\n\n424\n00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,266\nYou have to make a decision and\nmove forward.\n\n425\n00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:09,121\nYou can't just sit there and\nwait for new data to come out.\n\n426\n00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:12,378\nAnd so that's where we get our group\nDecision making techniques and\n\n427\n00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:14,160\nwe've already talked about these.\n\n428\n00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,670\n>> Yeah.\n\n429\n00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,410\n>> You just get everybody together.\n\n430\n00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:21,330\nAnd you come up with the best information\nthat you can and you make a decision.\n\n431\n00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,850\nAnd document how you made that decision,\n\n432\n00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,610\nbecause if it's completely\nwrong down the road.\n\n433\n00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,400\nYou can say look,\nwe were breaking new ground here.\n\n434\n00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,910\nNobody knew,\nwe didn't have anything to act on.\n\n435\n00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,450\nWe did the best we could with\nthe information that we had.\n\n436\n00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:41,900\nAll right, so that is pretty important\nthere as far as the group decision making.\n\n437\n00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,460\nNow I mentioned reserve analysis.\n\n438\n00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,010\nReserve analysis is a really tricky one,\n\n439\n00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:52,280\nbecause it can be a violation\nof ethics in some cases.\n\n440\n00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,330\nI always think of Star Trek, right?\n\n441\n00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,100\nI think it's Star Trek anyway,\nI'm not a Trekkie.\n\n442\n00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,650\nBut in the original series,\nyou had Scottie, and\n\n443\n00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,890\nthe captain would call down and\nsay Scottie, I need warp nine!\n\n444\n00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,910\nAnd Scottie would say,\nI'm giving her all she's got!\n\n445\n00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,740\nAnd the captain would say,\ncome on, I need it.\n\n446\n00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,290\nHow soon can you have it?\n\n447\n00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,050\nAnd Scotty would say, give me three hours.\n\n448\n00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,693\nAnd then Captain Kirk would say,\nyou've got one, right.\n\n449\n00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:19,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So Scotty kind of like built it into\n\n450\n00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,600\nhis mind over time that hey,\nI always need to say a higher number,\n\n451\n00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,320\nknowing the captain is\ngoing to cut it down.\n\n452\n00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,115\nOr if we have the same\nthing in the tech world,\n\n453\n00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:31,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n454\n00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,980\n>> under promise, over deliver.\n\n455\n00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,700\nIf you promise three days and\ncome in at one you look like the hero.\n\n456\n00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,250\nIf you promise one day and you come in at\none day well, you did your job, right?\n\n457\n00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,380\nSo a lot of people will do that.\n\n458\n00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,790\nThey will artificially pad their estimate.\n\n459\n00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,590\nThat's what it's called.\n\n460\n00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,510\nThat's what it will be called in\nthe exam is padding your estimate.\n\n461\n00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,730\nAnd padding your estimate is\nforbidden in the code of ethics.\n\n462\n00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:02,040\nYou should not pad your estimate without\nclearly designating it as reserve.\n\n463\n00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,630\nAll right.\n\n464\n00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,540\nIn other words, if I've got\na three-day activity on the calendar,\n\n465\n00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,560\nit needs to take three days.\n\n466\n00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,160\nAnd if we agree that reserve needs to\nhappen, maybe I decide there needs to be\n\n467\n00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,970\ntwo days of reserve afterwards\nin case it runs late,\n\n468\n00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,870\nI need to put it on my schedule as\na three day activity and then two days of\n\n469\n00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,770\nreserve clearly marked on the schedule so\nthat everybody knows there is reserve.\n\n470\n00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,610\nIf it's a three day activity and\nwe put it in there for five, we're lying.\n\n471\n00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,150\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right?\n\n472\n00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,860\nWe are not telling the truth.\n\n473\n00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,600\nIt is not a five day activity, and this is\none of the biggest challenges we have as\n\n474\n00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,900\na project manager is, we understand that.\n\n475\n00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,170\nWe understand that reserve\nis a necessary thing.\n\n476\n00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,930\nWe just need to be open about it, but\n\n477\n00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,930\nthe people doing the work on your\nproject probably don't know that.\n\n478\n00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,070\nAnd especially if you're\ndealing with contractors,\n\n479\n00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,530\nthey almost always pad their values.\n\n480\n00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:57,160\nAnd so I make it a habit when I\nbring in a contractor, is to be very\n\n481\n00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,310\nup front at the beginning and say look I\nunderstand that these ties are not exact.\n\n482\n00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,100\nI understand that things happen,\n\n483\n00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,010\nand things don't always go\nthe way we want them to.\n\n484\n00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,280\nI understand that and I understand\nthat you need reserve time in case.\n\n485\n00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,860\nThe only thing I ask is that\nyou're upfront about it.\n\n486\n00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,970\nThat you tell me what\nthat reserve time is.\n\n487\n00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,050\nYou tell me you should have it done in\nthree, but we're going to do five days.\n\n488\n00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,000\nWe're going to do two extra days just for\nreserve, just in case.\n\n489\n00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,480\nIf they're upfront with me,\nI'm okay with it.\n\n490\n00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,330\nI can plan around it, and\nnow my stuff is accurate.\n\n491\n00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,170\nIf they tell me that, what I do is\nI look around at my calendar and\n\n492\n00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,640\nI say you know what,\nlet me do some contingencies here, right?\n\n493\n00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,210\nContingency planning is what\nthis is really all about.\n\n494\n00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,510\nIf I have task five and it's scheduled for\nthree days with two days of reserve, so\n\n495\n00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,755\nfive days, then task six would\nneed to start two days later.\n\n496\n00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:49,195\nIn my head it's great.\n\n497\n00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:52,975\nLet me diagram this so\nit makes more sense.\n\n498\n00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:57,455\nSo, here let's just say\nI've got task five.\n\n499\n00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,870\nI reach out to my contractors, they\ntell me it's gonna be a five day task.\n\n500\n00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,260\nSo it's a five day.\n\n501\n00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,811\nWhoops.\nOh stop.\n\n502\n00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:15,430\nThere we go.\nAll right, so it is a five day task right?\n\n503\n00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,490\nIt's actually a three day task, but they\ntold me that it was gonna be five, right?\n\n504\n00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,640\nSo for whatever reason it doesn't\nwanna scroll down for me.\n\n505\n00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,520\nWhoops.\n\n506\n00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,160\nLittle crazy.\n\n507\n00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,700\nAll right, there, so five days and\nlet me have it start on a Monday.\n\n508\n00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:30,930\nAll right.\n\n509\n00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:35,773\nSo they tell me it's going to be five days\nand immediately afterwards I have Task 5.\n\n510\n00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:41,020\nAnd Task 6 is another five day\n\n511\n00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,280\nactivity and\nit's going to be linked to Task 5.\n\n512\n00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,340\nSo I'm just going to come in here and\nlink these guys.\n\n513\n00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,230\nLike that, one after the other.\n\n514\n00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,630\nSo, task five happens,\nit's five days, task six happens.\n\n515\n00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,810\nNow, in reality,\n\n516\n00:28:54,810 --> 00:29:00,010\nTask 5 has two days of reserve in it,\nbut they didn't tell me that.\n\n517\n00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,670\nSo then they get to work and\nthey finish on Wednesday.\n\n518\n00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,270\nThey finish in three days.\n\n519\n00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,000\nWell, I don't have Task 6\nscheduled to start until Monday.\n\n520\n00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,690\nSo what happens Thursday and Friday?\n\n521\n00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,440\n>> Nothing.\n\n522\n00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,870\nWe sit and we do nothing, right.\n\n523\n00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,650\nWe don't move forward because\nthose guys are done and\n\n524\n00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,620\nhere we are just twiddling our\nthumbs wasting two days, all right.\n\n525\n00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,460\nBut if I knew that they were going to be\ndoing reserve, what I could've done was\n\n526\n00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:32,140\ntaken Task 5, and\nmarked it as a three day activity.\n\n527\n00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:39,905\nI could've inserted a Task 5 reserve,\nand punched that one in.\n\n528\n00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:43,545\nIn as a two day activity, all right?\n\n529\n00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:46,115\nAnd let me just update\nmy predecessors here.\n\n530\n00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:47,175\nSo this one's going to depend on 19.\n\n531\n00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:48,615\nThis one's going to depend on 20.\n\n532\n00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:52,535\nThere, okay and\nnow I have the same thing, right?\n\n533\n00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:59,410\nI've got the three day activity, followed\nby two days of reserve followed by Task 6.\n\n534\n00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,375\nMy calendar's no different.\n\n535\n00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,470\nOkay.\n\n536\n00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,540\nBut looking at this as a product\nmanager I can say you know what,\n\n537\n00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,490\nlet me reach out to these guys and say,\nhey you guys you got a five day activity.\n\n538\n00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,550\nIf this contractor finishes by Wednesday,\n\n539\n00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,360\ncould you actually get\nstarted on Thursday?\n\n540\n00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,810\nAnd they can start looking at their\ncalendars and say, yeah, we can do that!\n\n541\n00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,190\nOr we've got three people assigned to it.\n\n542\n00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,520\nOne of them is available on Thursday and\nFriday.\n\n543\n00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,090\nSo if you can get in there early,\nthey can get a head start and\n\n544\n00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:32,340\nthat'll increase the odds of this activity\nfinishing early, finishing on schedule.\n\n545\n00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,290\nAnd you can start to gain time that'll\nhelp you out later in your project.\n\n546\n00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:41,050\nYou can make those decisions if you\nknow that there's reserve in the number.\n\n547\n00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,325\nSo, as a project manager,\nif you're a PMI member,\n\n548\n00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:51,435\nyou're required to designate\nreserve like this.\n\n549\n00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,055\nAnd depending on your\nproject manager software,\n\n550\n00:30:54,055 --> 00:30:57,295\na lot of times I will come in here and\nchange the color or\n\n551\n00:30:57,295 --> 00:31:02,189\nthe bar style to make this one look a\nlittle different so it's not designated as\n\n552\n00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,040\nan activity that needs work,\nyeah, so you can do that.\n\n553\n00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,850\nBut you wanna clearly denote it.\n\n554\n00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,650\nAnd if you're acting on\ninformation from your contractors,\n\n555\n00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,710\nyou've gotta make sure that they tell you.\n\n556\n00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,640\nBut if you don't ask,\nthey're not gonna tell you.\n\n557\n00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,980\nThey're not gonna say oh yeah, yeah.\n\n558\n00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,080\nWe cooked those numbers.\n\n559\n00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,360\nWe added a few extra days.\n\n560\n00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,720\nRight, because they'll do that.\n\n561\n00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,490\nThey'll cook the dates,\nthey'll cook the budge.\n\n562\n00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,060\nThey're just used to that\nbecause it's their safety net.\n\n563\n00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,140\nI'm OK with that.\n\n564\n00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,920\nI fully understand safety nets.\n\n565\n00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,190\nI use them myself.\n\n566\n00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,530\nBut I'm very clear about it,\nwe wanna have that on the schedule.\n\n567\n00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,670\nAll right, so\nkeep that in mind as reserve.\n\n568\n00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:47,190\nAnd so this last technique here,\nreserve analysis, that just means we\n\n569\n00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,750\nneed to look at our activities and\ndetermine where we need some reserve time.\n\n570\n00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,660\nAnd we're gonna talk about reserve cost or\n\n571\n00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,290\nmoney later but\nreserve time where we need that.\n\n572\n00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,774\nAnd if we can allocate, or\nif we can assign it now and track it,\n\n573\n00:32:00,774 --> 00:32:03,790\nwe can still take advantage\nof it if we don't need it.\n\n574\n00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,927\nIf we don't track it, we're not gonna be\nable to take advantage of that later on if\n\n575\n00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:07,981\nwe're ahead of schedule.\n\n576\n00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:09,235\nSo that's what reserve\nanalysis is all about.\n\n577\n00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:14,044\nDigging into that, finding out where\nit's needed, and then planning what you\n\n578\n00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:19,290\ncan do with it, if you don't use it,\ncan you get ahead of schedule, right?\n\n579\n00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,950\nI think that's about it for\nReserve Analysis.\n\n580\n00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,490\nIsn't it Ronnie?\n\n581\n00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,271\n>> That's it.\n\n582\n00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:24,674\n[SOUND]\n>> Yeah, that's it, and\n\n583\n00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:27,856\nwe'll see like base line tracking,\nwhere we get into the monitoring phase.\n\n584\n00:32:27,856 --> 00:32:31,751\nAnd we wanna track, so we know when we use\nthat reserve, and when we didn't use it,\n\n585\n00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:35,105\nbecause we can put that in our lessons\nlearned at the end of the project.\n\n586\n00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:39,150\nWe can use that to track whether we\nactually needed that reserve or not and\n\n587\n00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,021\nlearn from it.\n\n588\n00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:43,690\nSo, all right, well, that's a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n589\n00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,390\nSo, why don't we take a breather here.\n\n590\n00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:50,270\nWhen we get back, we're gonna take\na look at the actual scheduling system.\n\n591\n00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,396\nHow we start to schedule things and how we\nkind of evaluate the data that's there.\n\n592\n00:32:54,396 --> 00:32:56,146\nCool stuff to be seen.\n\n593\n00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,688\nAll right, so stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in a few.\n\n594\n00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:06,396\n[MUSIC]\n\n595\n00:33:06,396 --> 00:33:08,030\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n596\n00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,530\nSo we took a look at all the tools and\ntechniques that we've got.\n\n597\n00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,580\nAnd when we apply those to generating\nour estimates what are we left with at\n\n598\n00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,280\nthe end of the day?\n\n599\n00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,600\nWhat are our outputs?\n\n600\n00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,380\nWell, the main output that we're\ngenerating is this guy right here,\n\n601\n00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,060\nthe activity duration estimate.\n\n602\n00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,660\nWe should have an estimate for\nhow long each activity is going to take.\n\n603\n00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,520\nSo we're reaching out to\nour subject matter experts,\n\n604\n00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,200\nreaching out to all these individuals and\n\n605\n00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,120\nthey're saying, yeah, that'll take\ntwo hours, that'll take five weeks.\n\n606\n00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,900\nAnd you wanna be a little\nmore specific than that.\n\n607\n00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:43,090\nYou wanna get them to say, well it'll\ntake two weeks if I have one person, but\n\n608\n00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,400\nif I could have two people,\nwe'd get it done in one week, right?\n\n609\n00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,520\nSome activities, you have this, we're\ngonna talk about it a little bit later, so\n\n610\n00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,160\nI don't wanna get too far ahead of myself,\nbut, you have fixed duration activities.\n\n611\n00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,490\nAnd then you have other activities\nthat are what are called fixed work.\n\n612\n00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,970\nAnd with a fixed work activity,\n\n613\n00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,490\nthat means you have a certain amount\nhours of work that need to be done.\n\n614\n00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,030\nThe more people you have\nthe faster that work can get done.\n\n615\n00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,550\nA great example might be painting a house,\nall right?\n\n616\n00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,550\nIf I have one person painting the house\nit might take them four days.\n\n617\n00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,410\nIf I have two people painting the house\nmaybe they can get it done in two days.\n\n618\n00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:24,090\nIf I got three people painting the house\nmaybe I can get it done in one day.\n\n619\n00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:29,340\nThe more people I attach to that activity,\nthe faster it gets done, right?\n\n620\n00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,870\nThat's called effort-driven work, right?\n\n621\n00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,780\nThe more effort we put in,\nthe faster it gets done.\n\n622\n00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,756\nSo when we come up with these estimates,\nwe need to know is this a fixed duration,\n\n623\n00:34:39,756 --> 00:34:43,500\nsomething we can't do anything about,\nor is it fixed work?\n\n624\n00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,807\nThere's a certain amount of man hours or\nwoman hours or whatever [LAUGH] people\n\n625\n00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:51,810\nhours that need to be done in\norder to complete this activity.\n\n626\n00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,760\nSo I gave an example\nof painting the house.\n\n627\n00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,690\nThat would be like fixed work.\n\n628\n00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,030\nThere's a certain amount of hours,\n\n629\n00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,500\nthe more people you have\nthe faster it gets done.\n\n630\n00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,810\nBut you might have something like,\nwe're in Gainesville, Florida, right?\n\n631\n00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,390\nSo maybe as part of our project we need\nto move some materials from Gainesville\n\n632\n00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,180\nto Orlando so\nit's gonna have to be driven.\n\n633\n00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,490\nAnd that's about a two-hour drive, right?\n\n634\n00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,430\nSo I put in a activity that says\ndrive to Orlando, two hours, right?\n\n635\n00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,040\nThat's an example of a fixed duration.\n\n636\n00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,175\nIf I have one person driving that car,\nit's gonna take two hours.\n\n637\n00:35:23,175 --> 00:35:25,235\nWhat if I have two people in the car?\n\n638\n00:35:25,235 --> 00:35:25,855\nTwo hours.\n\n639\n00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:26,745\nThree people?\n\n640\n00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:27,365\nTwo hours.\n\n641\n00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:29,855\nDoesn't matter how many people, well\neventually you max out the car I suppose,\n\n642\n00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:32,035\nbut it doesn't really matter\nhow many people are in the car,\n\n643\n00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:34,465\nit's gonna take two hours\nno matter what we do.\n\n644\n00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,465\nYou might speed,\nbreak the law, or whatever, but\n\n645\n00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:38,005\nit's just gonna take that two hours.\n\n646\n00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,715\nThat's fixed duration.\n\n647\n00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:42,895\nThere's no sense in assigning a bunch\nof extra resources to it when\n\n648\n00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:44,490\nwe're not gonna make it any shorter.\n\n649\n00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,500\nSo, it's fixed duration.\n\n650\n00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,400\nSo, when we get these estimates,\nwe need to be thinking about that also.\n\n651\n00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,580\nWhen we do the duration, there's really\na couple of things we need to think about.\n\n652\n00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,680\nLet me jump back to my notes here.\n\n653\n00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,010\nSo, we've got details of an estimate.\n\n654\n00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,360\nAnd really it's of a time estimate,\ncuz cost is gonna be different.\n\n655\n00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:16,672\nSo, is it fixed duration or\n\n656\n00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:20,580\nfixed work, right?\n\n657\n00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,930\nCan I assign more people to it?\n\n658\n00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,150\nI'm kinda leaving out\nthe most important part,\n\n659\n00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:30,000\nwhich is how long,\nhow long will it take, right?\n\n660\n00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,290\nThat's really what this is all about.\n\n661\n00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,120\nAnd how you measure that\nis up to your project.\n\n662\n00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,680\nIf it's a short project,\nyou might measure it in hours.\n\n663\n00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,190\nIf it's a long project,\nyou might measure it in days or weeks.\n\n664\n00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,300\nYou might even go months.\n\n665\n00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,146\nWe don't normally do months.\n\n666\n00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:44,110\nRemember our 8/80 rule?\n\n667\n00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,710\nWe're trying to keep things in 80-hour\nmaximums, which would be about two weeks,\n\n668\n00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,830\nso we don't normally go too crazy, but\nhow long is this activity gonna take?\n\n669\n00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,710\nIs it fixed duration or fixed work?\n\n670\n00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,040\nVery important to know that, cuz we can\nuse that to adjust our schedule later on.\n\n671\n00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,980\nWe also need to know is\nthere a reserve time?\n\n672\n00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,646\nIf so, how much?\n\n673\n00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:07,276\nRight, so\n\n674\n00:37:07,276 --> 00:37:11,980\nthat we can designate the reserve time\nin there as we designate it also, right?\n\n675\n00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:18,730\nThe last thing we need is,\nare there any constraints, okay?\n\n676\n00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,190\nConstraints are an interesting thing and\n\n677\n00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:26,480\nin the pin they mention it but\nit's kinda spread throughout.\n\n678\n00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,100\nI don't think there's like one big\ndesignation of how the constraints are.\n\n679\n00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,490\nBut it's something that we need to gather.\n\n680\n00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:35,420\nSo you might not see this one on the exam\nbut in real life it's pretty important.\n\n681\n00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,750\nWhen you have an activity\nthere're certain factors that can\n\n682\n00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,220\ninfluence where it falls on your\nschedule and we can see those.\n\n683\n00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,370\nLet me get rid of some of these windows.\n\n684\n00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,521\nYeah, we don't need that.\n\n685\n00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:57,698\n[SOUND] And I'll just take,\nactually this one\n\n686\n00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:03,564\nhas a constraint already so\nlet me pull it up there.\n\n687\n00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:08,184\nAll right, so kinda looking in here,\nI've pulled up an activity in my project\n\n688\n00:38:08,184 --> 00:38:12,220\nmanagement software and\nyou'll see this constraint value.\n\n689\n00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,960\nAnd there's eight different values\nhere in the constraints, okay?\n\n690\n00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,770\nMost project management software will\nuse what are called soft constraints.\n\n691\n00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,420\nAnd there's two of them.\n\n692\n00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,650\nAs soon as and as late as possible.\n\n693\n00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:32,600\nOkay, so when we add this activity into\nour calendar we're normally saying\n\n694\n00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,630\nit can start as soon as possible.\n\n695\n00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,390\nSo just look at our dependencies and\nbased on the dependencies,\n\n696\n00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,910\nstart as soon as you can.\n\n697\n00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,160\nWe use this when we're trying\nto schedule a project and\n\n698\n00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,050\nget it done as fast as possible,\nwhich is what most of us are trying to do.\n\n699\n00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,580\nSo as soon as possible do this, all right?\n\n700\n00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,850\nBut sometimes there's projects\nlike the Olympics, right?\n\n701\n00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,890\nIf we're planning the Olympics,\nthe Olympics start on a particular day,\n\n702\n00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,720\nthere's not a lot of sense in\ngetting things done early.\n\n703\n00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,660\nWe wanna plan on getting things\ngoing right at that moment.\n\n704\n00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,840\nAnd so you may have something that's\nas late as possible, all right?\n\n705\n00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,200\nBased on the other activities that\nwe depend on, our preceders and\n\n706\n00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,420\nour succeeders, those guys, based on that\n\n707\n00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,710\nwe'll start as late as we can without\nmissing our finish date, all right?\n\n708\n00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,720\nSo those two as soon as possible is what\nalmost every project management software\n\n709\n00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,810\ndefaults to.\n\n710\n00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:35,450\nThey're called soft constraints\nbecause one activity can move in\n\n711\n00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,820\ntime based on the stuff that's around it.\n\n712\n00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,410\nIf something else finishes early,\nthis one can start early.\n\n713\n00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,130\nWe might not have that, though.\n\n714\n00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,060\nIf you're dealing with contractors, and\n\n715\n00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:49,940\nthe contractors say it's gonna take three\ndays, and we're next available July 12th.\n\n716\n00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,450\nSo, now it's not just that\nit's gonna take three days.\n\n717\n00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,480\nIt's gonna take three days from July 12th.\n\n718\n00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,509\nNo matter what happens before,\nthey're not available until July 12th.\n\n719\n00:39:57,509 --> 00:40:02,129\nAll right, so in those scenarios,\nwe have to use harder constraints,\n\n720\n00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:05,752\nconstraints that are a little\nmore restricted, okay?\n\n721\n00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:10,128\nAnd the recommendation is that you\nstill have some flexibility, so\n\n722\n00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:13,220\nyou'll see\n>> As soon as, as late as, and\n\n723\n00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,900\nthen you've got start no earlier,\nstart no later.\n\n724\n00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,250\nOkay, if I say start no earlier\nthen July 12th, I can still start\n\n725\n00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:28,040\non July 13th or July 14th,\nI just can't start earlier than July 12th.\n\n726\n00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,150\nSo there's still some flexibility, but\n\n727\n00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:36,120\nwhen the contractor says we'll be there\nJuly 12th, that is must start on.\n\n728\n00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,610\nYou've got to start on July 12th\nbecause the contractor has said it.\n\n729\n00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,220\nThat is the hardest\nconstraint you can have.\n\n730\n00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,090\nYou can't start on July 13th,\nyou can't start on July 11th,\n\n731\n00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,440\nyou can only start on July 12th.\n\n732\n00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:54,590\nSo must start on, must finish on,\nthey're necessary evils, but\n\n733\n00:40:54,590 --> 00:41:00,930\nwe want to avoid them if possible because\nwe get no flexibility whatsoever.\n\n734\n00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:01,790\nAll right.\n\n735\n00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,338\nA couple of the other ones we've got start\nno earlier than, start no later than.\n\n736\n00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:13,703\nAnd these are just saying it's okay\nto start, if we say start no earlier\n\n737\n00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:18,460\nthan July 12th,\nwe could start on July 13th or July 14th.\n\n738\n00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,820\nWe just can't start on July 11th.\n\n739\n00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,450\nAnd start no later than means If\nwe can get ahead, great, do it.\n\n740\n00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,460\nBut July 12th is the last\ntime we can start.\n\n741\n00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,090\nWe can't start on July 13th cuz we\nwon't make our deadline, right.\n\n742\n00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:36,280\nSo start no later than,\nwe set a limit for when we can start.\n\n743\n00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,700\nAnd then the last ones were\nfinish no earlier than and\n\n744\n00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,470\nfinish no later than, okay.\n\n745\n00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,340\nAnd if we break these down in\nterms of flexibility, right,\n\n746\n00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:53,910\nwe have the most flexibility\nwith these guys.\n\n747\n00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,538\nIs it spelled right?\n\n748\n00:41:54,538 --> 00:41:55,218\n>> Sure.\n\n749\n00:41:55,218 --> 00:41:57,420\n>> [LAUGH] Sure.\n\n750\n00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,180\nIt's spelled to our standards, I guess.\n\n751\n00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:06,355\nAll right, and then we've got the\nmoderate, or we'll say some flexibility.\n\n752\n00:42:09,698 --> 00:42:10,650\nWith these guys.\n\n753\n00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,791\nAnd then we've got no flexibility-\n\n754\n00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:23,350\nWith these guys, and so\nwe just need to be aware that,\n\n755\n00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,886\nas we get the estimates from these people,\nthey're already going through the trouble\n\n756\n00:42:26,886 --> 00:42:29,120\nof figuring out how much\ntime it's gonna take.\n\n757\n00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,760\nWe need to say, all right, based on\nyour schedules, when can you do this?\n\n758\n00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,010\nWhen can we have you?\n\n759\n00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,330\nIf we can put more people into it\nto shrink its time, can we do that?\n\n760\n00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,030\nThese are the things we need to think\nabout while we're getting the durations,\n\n761\n00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,910\nand now is the time to do that.\n\n762\n00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,320\nYou can do it later, but you've already\ngot people thinking about it, so\n\n763\n00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,300\nyou might as well knock it out right now,\nokay.\n\n764\n00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,440\nThis is gonna help us figure out the dates\nthat are gonna be attached to these\n\n765\n00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,010\nthings, and as we start populating our\ncalendar with this information as we\n\n766\n00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,360\ndevelop our schedule,\n\n767\n00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,930\nwhich we're gonna do in the next process,\nthis information will be pretty handy.\n\n768\n00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:04,620\nSo, even though it's not listed here as\na specific thing that we wanna gather,\n\n769\n00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,620\nnow's the time to do it.\n\n770\n00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,850\nYou wanna gather it while you're\ndoing your activity estimates.\n\n771\n00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,440\n>> This is where this project management\nsoftware really does help us out, right?\n\n772\n00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,560\nBecause once we start\nsetting those predecessors,\n\n773\n00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,500\nthen we start for\nputting in these constraints.\n\n774\n00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,100\nWe can see and\ndevelop around that process here,\n\n775\n00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,640\nso we actually do get our project\nin doing what we need to.\n\n776\n00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,670\nYou can do it manually but, again,\nthis means that you're actually taking\n\n777\n00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,960\na manual calendar and putting those things\nin and then trying to develop around it.\n\n778\n00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,980\nProject Manager development\nsoftware makes it so much easier.\n\n779\n00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,680\n>> Yeah, and just if you look here,\nyou see an example.\n\n780\n00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,630\nSee how most of these activities\nhave nothing in the left column?\n\n781\n00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:42,090\nThese are basically set to as\nsoon as possible, right and\n\n782\n00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,870\nso if I have an activity like this one,\n\n783\n00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:47,970\nselect software is a two day activity and\nit starts on June 6th, right.\n\n784\n00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:52,890\nSo June 7th, June 8th and\nthen we lead into our next one.\n\n785\n00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,970\nNow the next one is set\nto start on June 10th,\n\n786\n00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:59,910\nwhich I imagine means we hit a weekend in\nthere and so it kind of got pushed back.\n\n787\n00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,820\nYeah, the one crosses a weekend.\n\n788\n00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,080\nSo it's gonna start on June 10th.\n\n789\n00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,760\nThat's as soon as it can start.\n\n790\n00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,100\nIf I find that select software is\nactually gonna take three days so\n\n791\n00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,760\nI bump it up to three.\n\n792\n00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,050\nSee how this Bid / RFq\njust moved to June 11th.\n\n793\n00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,240\nIt dynamically moved cuz there\nwasn't a constraint set on it.\n\n794\n00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,270\nIt was okay to move it, all right.\n\n795\n00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,640\nBut if I've got something where\nI'm dealing with a contractor,\n\n796\n00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,130\nlike this one, install software.\n\n797\n00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,380\nSo installing the software right\nnow is occurring a little bit\n\n798\n00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,960\nlater in the schedule.\n\n799\n00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,440\nHere we go.\nIt's right here.\n\n800\n00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,560\nAnd it's set to take 10 days, and right\nnow, it's starting on July 10th, okay.\n\n801\n00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,580\nPurchase software before it is a one day\nactivity, wrapping up on July 9th, and\n\n802\n00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,245\nso that's why we're able to move\nright into install software.\n\n803\n00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:49,125\nWell, what if Install software was\ngonna be done by a contractor?\n\n804\n00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:53,425\nAnd the contractor says we will\nbe there July 10th, right.\n\n805\n00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:54,275\nAnd that's it.\n\n806\n00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,945\nThat's the only time we've got available.\n\n807\n00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:57,800\nWe'll be there July 10th.\n\n808\n00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,580\nSo we could come in here and\nadd a constraint that says must start on,\n\n809\n00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,920\nand we'll set it to July 10th, right.\n\n810\n00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,740\nSo they told us July 10th,\nthat's when they can be here, all right.\n\n811\n00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,860\nNow, that there's a constraint,\n\n812\n00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,930\nmy schedule doesn't change\ncuz it was July 10th already\n\n813\n00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:19,880\nIf I scroll over a little more so you guys\ncan see if my head's on top of it, there.\n\n814\n00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,500\nYou can see here in the week of July 14th,\nor whatever, so we've got July 10th,\n\n815\n00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,680\nthat's when it starts and it's there.\n\n816\n00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,090\nBut this little calendar icon\nlets me know I have a constraint,\n\n817\n00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:31,720\nthough I float over it tells me\nits gotta start on July 10th.\n\n818\n00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,680\nIf purchased software takes too long,\nif it ends up taking two days, so\n\n819\n00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,710\nI'll just bump it up to two days,\nthe calendar starts to get a little weird.\n\n820\n00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,350\nNotice my points are strange now and\n\n821\n00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:48,070\nwhat's going on is,\nthis is still starting on July 10th.\n\n822\n00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:52,710\nEven though this one is two days,\nand so what's going on is it has\n\n823\n00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,490\npushed us back but\nsee how we're missing this milestone now?\n\n824\n00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,930\nRight, this activity is\nfinishing after the milestone.\n\n825\n00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,100\nI can see I'm gonna be behind schedule.\n\n826\n00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,140\nThese guys are gonna come in and they're\ngonna have nine days to do the work that\n\n827\n00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,120\nthey should have had ten days in and\nso they're gonna be behind schedule.\n\n828\n00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,740\nSo your software will represent that.\n\n829\n00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,380\nMicrosoft projects will be a little bit\nbetter about this because you get a big\n\n830\n00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,160\nred exclamation point over here so\nyou know that there's a problem.\n\n831\n00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,720\nBut you can start to see that, so anytime\nyou see this little calendar over here,\n\n832\n00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,770\nin this software at least, That lets\nme know that there's a constraint.\n\n833\n00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:30,180\nSo, be aware that that is going to affect\nyour schedule as you go to set those up.\n\n834\n00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,560\nAll right, so\nlet me incorporate this into our notes,\n\n835\n00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,700\nsince it wasn't really in there.\n\n836\n00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,540\nWe generate our notes based on\nwhat is in the pin bot, but\n\n837\n00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,920\nsometimes there's a little\nextra that's nice,\n\n838\n00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,440\nso when we talk about estimating\nthose activity durations.\n\n839\n00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,130\nI'm just gonna punch in here some of\nthis other stuff that we wanna get here\n\n840\n00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:55,400\nas far as like details of that estimate,\nall right.\n\n841\n00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,430\nSo then as far as our\noutputs are concerned,\n\n842\n00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,310\nwe're getting those duration estimates.\n\n843\n00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:05,630\nWe're including how long they're going\nto take, what reserve time they need,\n\n844\n00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,730\nwhat date they can happen on, whether\nthey're fixed work or fixed duration.\n\n845\n00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:15,340\nSo whether I can effect the length\nof that on the actual calendar.\n\n846\n00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,479\nSo we need to get all that information.\n\n847\n00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,410\nAnd then we have project document updates.\n\n848\n00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:24,400\nRemember that activity list we created\nin the list activities process?\n\n849\n00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,850\nWell, we go back to that.\n\n850\n00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,378\nAnd we update it to reflect\nthese new durations [COUGH].\n\n851\n00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:32,475\nExcuse me.\nThat was a field that was in our template,\n\n852\n00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,155\nand so now, we can go back and\npopulate that.\n\n853\n00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:36,715\nWe may not have had that\ninformation at that time.\n\n854\n00:47:36,715 --> 00:47:40,245\nIf we did these at the same time, we\nwould, but we didn't, so we go back, and\n\n855\n00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:40,965\nwe update it.\n\n856\n00:47:40,965 --> 00:47:42,575\nSo, it's a document update.\n\n857\n00:47:42,575 --> 00:47:46,695\nWe get that information in there,\nand now we're in business, okay.\n\n858\n00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:49,505\nNow, once we have all our durations,\nwhat do we do?\n\n859\n00:47:49,505 --> 00:47:53,150\nWell, we go to our project\nmanagement software.\n\n860\n00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,410\nIf we're using it, or\nwe go to our regular document templates,\n\n861\n00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:59,170\nor whatever, and\nwe punch all that data in.\n\n862\n00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,479\nAll right, now I know how long\nthis stuff is going to take.\n\n863\n00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:04,819\nSo I come in here, and I go to each\nof my activities in this list,\n\n864\n00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:06,401\nand I start punching them in.\n\n865\n00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:11,253\nAnd I say, okay, I know this one\nis actually going to take one day.\n\n866\n00:48:11,253 --> 00:48:14,712\nIt's not an estimate anymore, so\nI'm just gonna punch in one day.\n\n867\n00:48:14,712 --> 00:48:17,890\nThis one might actually take two days.\n\n868\n00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:22,410\nAnd so I'm just going through and updating\neach of them based on what they're\n\n869\n00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:27,265\nactually going to take so\nthat they're no longer estimates.\n\n870\n00:48:27,265 --> 00:48:31,800\nAnd keep in mind that when you\nhave nested activities like these,\n\n871\n00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,570\nit's updating the nested activity that\nsets the roll up activity's duration.\n\n872\n00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:40,720\nSo I'm not bothering to update my roll\nups, they're updating themselves.\n\n873\n00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,810\nSo these I already put some in for,\nlooks like I got them in for most of them.\n\n874\n00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:48,230\nYeah, I don't have anymore question marks,\n\n875\n00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,432\nthese are the estimates\nthat we're rolling with.\n\n876\n00:48:50,432 --> 00:48:52,570\nThese dates, I can't see the future so\n\n877\n00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,170\nI don't know if this is\ngonna be a 100% accurate.\n\n878\n00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,780\nSo they are still estimates but\nit's the best estimate I've got.\n\n879\n00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,350\nIt's what I'm gonna work with.\n\n880\n00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,860\nAnd if I know any constraints,\nI'm gonna go and plug those in too.\n\n881\n00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,040\nSo we go through each activity and we plug\nin whatever constraint is built around it.\n\n882\n00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,220\nIf the constraint is caused by\nhaving a contractor or whatever.\n\n883\n00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:14,045\nAnd let me give you a piece of advice\nhere that'll make life easier on you.\n\n884\n00:49:14,045 --> 00:49:19,420\nAnytime you do a constraint,\ngo back into that activity, and\n\n885\n00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,360\nwhatever software you use, if it's worth\nanything will have a notes column.\n\n886\n00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,290\nPut in there why you have that constraint.\n\n887\n00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,380\nPut an entry that says here's\nwhy that constraint exists.\n\n888\n00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,790\nNow, you can do it in your activity list,\nalso,\n\n889\n00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:35,060\nthat other document, but you're probably\nusing your project management software to\n\n890\n00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,050\ndo your activity list like I am here.\n\n891\n00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,580\nSo put it in these notes.\n\n892\n00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,740\nThat way when you look at it\nlater when you're panicking and\n\n893\n00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,220\nyou need more time,\nyou can see why you have that constraint.\n\n894\n00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,320\nAnd it may be that you put\nthe constraint in there as a safety, but\n\n895\n00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,650\nthat you could actually\ndeviate from it a little bit.\n\n896\n00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,840\nWell for example,\ncontractors might say, you know?\n\n897\n00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,800\nWe'll start on Monday and\nwork Monday through Friday.\n\n898\n00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,480\nBut if you really need to we could\nstart on Saturday, you'd just have to\n\n899\n00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,810\npay us overtime for Saturday and Sunday\nand then we work the rest of the week.\n\n900\n00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,840\nSo I'd put in here a constraint\nthat says they start on Monday and\n\n901\n00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,000\nI would add a note that says,\n\n902\n00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,160\nby the way if we have to we can pay\novertime and they can start on Saturday.\n\n903\n00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,820\nRight.\n\n904\n00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,350\nDo that because you'll forget.\n\n905\n00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:21,090\nYou might be planning today, this activity\nmight not happen for six more months.\n\n906\n00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,080\nAnd six months goes by and you're\npanicking cuz you're a little behind\n\n907\n00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,230\nschedule and you see that constraint and\nyou're like, I've got no flexibility.\n\n908\n00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,510\nWell, here's your chance.\n\n909\n00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:32,110\nYou can go and read that and\nfind out what you can do.\n\n910\n00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,540\nDefinitely, definitely make use of that.\n\n911\n00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,724\nAll right, so that pretty much wraps\nup doing our estimates, right?\n\n912\n00:50:38,724 --> 00:50:41,264\nAnd you might be asking yourself,\nall right,\n\n913\n00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:45,080\nin my company should I use analogous,\nparametric, three-point?\n\n914\n00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,510\nWhich of these should I use?\n\n915\n00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,430\nWell, use whichever one is appropriate for\nyou.\n\n916\n00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:54,380\nAnd after you've figured it out, go back\nand update your schedule management plan.\n\n917\n00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,685\nAnd say, in our company we use the beta\n\n918\n00:50:58,685 --> 00:51:03,560\nthree-point estimating and not the\ntriangular three-point estimating, right?\n\n919\n00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,220\nSpecify that so\nthat everybody's calculating the same way,\n\n920\n00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,030\nthat it's consistent across your projects.\n\n921\n00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,350\nThat's what should be in your\nschedule management plan,\n\n922\n00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:16,220\nis how you use the tools and you might\neven put in there that reserve analysis.\n\n923\n00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,650\nYou've got to specifically\nlist reserve separately.\n\n924\n00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,000\nThat's actually a part of your\nschedule management plan too.\n\n925\n00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,900\nThat way everybody knows and\neverybody does it the same way.\n\n926\n00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,510\nAll right.\n\n927\n00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:30,160\nI think that's pretty much it for\nour estimates.\n\n928\n00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,410\nCan you think of anything else Ronnie?\n\n929\n00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,100\n>> I cannot.\n\n930\n00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,290\nThat's pretty good.\n\n931\n00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,580\n>> All right, well, we're gonna\nrevisit this again for cost and\n\n932\n00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,910\nyou'll see a lot of this is the same.\n\n933\n00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:41,530\nNow, you don't have fixed\ndurations with costs.\n\n934\n00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:42,680\nIt's just money, but\n\n935\n00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,380\nwe'll see a lot of these same concepts\nagain when we get to the cost estimates.\n\n936\n00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,720\nAll right.\n\n937\n00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,210\nSo the next thing that we've\ngot is developing the schedule.\n\n938\n00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,155\nAnd boy, this is a fun one.\n\n939\n00:51:53,155 --> 00:51:54,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n940\n00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:58,455\nAgain when working with our schedule\nwe're gonna have a couple inputs, right?\n\n941\n00:51:58,455 --> 00:51:59,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n942\n00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,130\nthe inputs here,\nit's basically everything that we've got.\n\n943\n00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:05,030\nSo you'll see many of the same\nthings we had from before,\n\n944\n00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:09,440\nthe difference is we've added in our\nactivity duration estimates, right?\n\n945\n00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,470\nSo we've got a little more there.\n\n946\n00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:16,412\nOur project schedule network diagrams, so\nthe calendar as we've developed it so far,\n\n947\n00:52:16,412 --> 00:52:20,099\nthese are some extra inputs that\nhave bumped us from 10 to 13.\n\n948\n00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:24,180\nThe only other one that was added here\nwas this one, project staff assignments,\n\n949\n00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,380\nall right.\n\n950\n00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,920\nRemember I mentioned in\nthe early planning stages,\n\n951\n00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,480\nwe don't know the people\nthat we're gonna be using.\n\n952\n00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,090\nWe're going to be putting\nin place holders.\n\n953\n00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,660\nSo like if I go into my resources\nI can see tech one, tech two,\n\n954\n00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,740\ntech three, web developer one,\nweb developer two, all right.\n\n955\n00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,570\nAs we start to actually\ndevelop our schedule,\n\n956\n00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,260\nwe need to know who these people are.\n\n957\n00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:52,160\nWe need to know because each person\nis going to have a resource calendar,\n\n958\n00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,920\nwhen they're available,\nwhen they're not available, and\n\n959\n00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,720\nthat resource calendar can\ntake a few different forms.\n\n960\n00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,070\nSo, I whipped up a few during\nthe break just to show you guys so\n\n961\n00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,790\nyou could see what I mean.\n\n962\n00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:09,730\nI've got tech one here, and they're\njust a regular full time employee, and\n\n963\n00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:12,980\nthey have been completely\nassigned to my project.\n\n964\n00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,770\nThey're gonna work on my project and\nnothing else.\n\n965\n00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,310\nWhen we create a person on our project,\n\n966\n00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:24,230\na resource,\nwe set their availability, all right.\n\n967\n00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,630\nAnd their availability is normally\ngonna start on a particular date,\n\n968\n00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,480\nthe date they're actually\nassigned to our project.\n\n969\n00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,965\nI probably don't need them in the planning\nphase, I need them in the execution phase,\n\n970\n00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:38,945\nand so this particular employee,\nI get them starting May 13th, all right?\n\n971\n00:53:38,945 --> 00:53:44,285\nStarting May 13th,\nI get them 100%, all right?\n\n972\n00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:49,977\nBut by August first I get\n\n973\n00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:55,672\nthem 0%, all right?\n\n974\n00:53:55,672 --> 00:54:00,160\nAnd I did an extra, let me delete that.\n\n975\n00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,290\nYou know what?\nI'm just gonna sit here and\n\n976\n00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:02,880\nstart creating too much junk.\n\n977\n00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,400\nAll right,\nwell let me just put this to 0% also.\n\n978\n00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,500\nOkay.\n\n979\n00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,620\nSo, starting August first,\nthey go back to 0%.\n\n980\n00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:15,540\nSo I have this employee from\nMay 13th through August first.\n\n981\n00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,460\nThat's when I've got them.\n\n982\n00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,915\nBut while I've got them,\nI've got them 100%.\n\n983\n00:54:18,915 --> 00:54:23,030\nThey work 8:00 to 5:00,\nMonday through Friday.\n\n984\n00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,000\nI get them 100% of that time, right.\n\n985\n00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,430\nWe need to understand\nthat about the employees.\n\n986\n00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,190\nIf they work strictly for our project,\nwe might not have a beginning and\n\n987\n00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,990\nend date, and so\nyou'll see what this software does.\n\n988\n00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:35,689\nIt says July first, 1970, 100%.\n\n989\n00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,384\nAnd if you just leave it at that\ndefault then you've got them forever.\n\n990\n00:54:38,384 --> 00:54:42,785\nBut the way this one works here, I'm\nsaying I get them on a particular date and\n\n991\n00:54:42,785 --> 00:54:44,830\nI have them for that time.\n\n992\n00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,310\nNow, just because I have\nthem 100% of the time,\n\n993\n00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:50,290\ndoesn't mean they're\navailable every single day.\n\n994\n00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:55,170\nSo this is really just their availability,\nnot necessarily their calendar.\n\n995\n00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,420\nSo most software will\ntrack a second value.\n\n996\n00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,470\nIf we close this I'm gonna\nchoose Tech 1 here and\n\n997\n00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,780\nI'm gonna hit the Calendar button.\n\n998\n00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,910\nAnd I'll see that Tech 1, oh, let's see.\n\n999\n00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,430\nOh, that's the working calendar.\n\n1000\n00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,330\nI click the wrong thing?\n\n1001\n00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,950\nThere it is.\nYeah, okay.\n\n1002\n00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:18,830\nI didn't have them highlighted.\n\n1003\n00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,980\nI highlighted Tech 1 and\nI pulled up the calendar this time.\n\n1004\n00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,300\nAnd I'll see here tech\none has its own calendar.\n\n1005\n00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,560\nEach employee needs their\nown calendar because well\n\n1006\n00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,210\nassuming they're not all the same, right?\n\n1007\n00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,040\nEach employee may have variations.\n\n1008\n00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,860\nAnd that's what we need to\ntrack with resource calendars.\n\n1009\n00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,010\nSo this particular employee,\nTech 1, is full-time, and\n\n1010\n00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,750\nif I take a look at an average day,\nsee how I've got 8:00 to noon.\n\n1011\n00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,870\nThey take a one hour lunch,\nand then they work to 5:00.\n\n1012\n00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:47,120\nSo I've got 8:00 to 5:00 or\neight hours a day.\n\n1013\n00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,810\nAnd if I just click around on\nthe calendar I can see that.\n\n1014\n00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:53,370\nNow, May 23rd is highlighted special for\nsome reason.\n\n1015\n00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:54,420\nThat's not a holiday or anything.\n\n1016\n00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:00,040\nI don't know why that's highlighted,\nbut yeah, so you can look around and\n\n1017\n00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,570\nkinda see.\n\n1018\n00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,340\nIf I click on the weekend,\nsee how he has no hours?\n\n1019\n00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,270\nAnd notice these red entries here.\n\n1020\n00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,370\nIf I click on those days,\nsee how there's no hours?\n\n1021\n00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:10,950\nThis employee has vacation.\n\n1022\n00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,468\nThey're taking a vacation\nfrom June 23rd to June 27th.\n\n1023\n00:56:13,468 --> 00:56:14,977\nThat's in my time.\n\n1024\n00:56:14,977 --> 00:56:19,110\nMy time is May 13th through August first.\n\n1025\n00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,061\nThey're taking a vacation\nin the middle of it.\n\n1026\n00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:25,303\nSo if I assign this resource to\nan activity during that time,\n\n1027\n00:56:25,303 --> 00:56:28,150\nthey'll have 0% availability.\n\n1028\n00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,740\nNo work will get done, right?\n\n1029\n00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,730\nNow your project software will show that,\nand\n\n1030\n00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,260\nthat activity will take longer than\nyou expect when you assign it.\n\n1031\n00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,240\nSo we have to be careful there,\n\n1032\n00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,810\nbecause your resources may\nnot always be available.\n\n1033\n00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,970\nAll right, so keep that in mind.\n\n1034\n00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,150\nYou've got these resource calendars.\n\n1035\n00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,830\nThat's one example.\n\n1036\n00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:51,640\nAnother example is, the employee\nmight only be a part time employee.\n\n1037\n00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,359\nSo, tech two, here,\nI've got tech two here 100% of the time.\n\n1038\n00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,882\nBut he's only part-time.\n\n1039\n00:56:56,882 --> 00:57:00,610\nHe works from 8:00 to noon, and that's it.\n\n1040\n00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:04,590\nSo I've got him 100%, but 100% for\nthis guy is only four hours a day.\n\n1041\n00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:08,040\nAnd so if I pull up his calendar,\nhere's Tech 2.\n\n1042\n00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,099\nAnd if I click on each of the days,\nsee how it shows only 8 to 12.\n\n1043\n00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:15,072\nHis resource counter is only 8 to 12,\nhe's a part time employee, and\n\n1044\n00:57:15,072 --> 00:57:16,570\nhe's got a vacation.\n\n1045\n00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:19,810\nWhat kind of part-timer take vacation?\n\n1046\n00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,280\nAnyhow, he's got vacation, so\n\n1047\n00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,270\nI can see right here he's got a week\nwhere he's not gonna be available.\n\n1048\n00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,980\nSo I need to be aware of that.\n\n1049\n00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:32,690\nThe third form is where we might have\na tech like this guy who's available for\n\n1050\n00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:35,600\nthe company, works full time,\nworks eight hours a day, but\n\n1051\n00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,840\nhe's being split between two projects.\n\n1052\n00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:43,800\nAnd so if I look at his calendar,\nhe works from eight to five every day.\n\n1053\n00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,530\nLook at all these days, eight to five.\n\n1054\n00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:49,352\nLooks like he's got a vacation also,\nbut he works 8:00 to 5:00.\n\n1055\n00:57:49,352 --> 00:57:55,680\nBut if I pull up his record, notice his\navailability is 50%, his maximum units.\n\n1056\n00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,350\nI cannot book him more than\nfour hours per day of work\n\n1057\n00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:02,550\nbecause he's working on a second project.\n\n1058\n00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:06,250\nHe's got four hours with me,\nfour hours with the other project.\n\n1059\n00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:10,630\nSo in this scenario I'm juggling this\nemployee with another project so\n\n1060\n00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,490\nI've got limited resources.\n\n1061\n00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:18,560\nSo be aware as we start to attach\nresources to our activities that if I have\n\n1062\n00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,930\nan activity that's a two day activity, but\nI assign an employee to it that's only\n\n1063\n00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:27,590\nworking half the time, that two day\nactivity may become a four day activity.\n\n1064\n00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,200\nRight?\n\n1065\n00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,350\nOr if that activity is driving to Orlando,\nand\n\n1066\n00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:34,390\nI only give them two hours out of the day,\nI just sent them to Orlando,\n\n1067\n00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:37,290\nhow can they get back to do their work for\ntheir other projects, right?\n\n1068\n00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,800\nSo I need to be aware of this.\n\n1069\n00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,800\nAnd that's why it's one\nof the inputs here,\n\n1070\n00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,770\nwhere we've got our resource calendars.\n\n1071\n00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,340\nThat's why they're so important.\n\n1072\n00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:51,180\nNow we don't normally create these,\nhuman resources does, or your PMO or\n\n1073\n00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,800\nyour project management office does.\n\n1074\n00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,000\nBut in a small company, you may have\nto figure this out yourself, so\n\n1075\n00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,530\nyou gotta pay attention.\n\n1076\n00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,920\nWe need to know who those people are,\nwho it is.\n\n1077\n00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,230\nThe project staff assignment because\nthat's the only way we're gonna know about\n\n1078\n00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:08,420\nvacations, sick time, things like that\nthat we need to plan for in our project.\n\n1079\n00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:11,450\nAll right, well let's stop here and\n\n1080\n00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:15,030\ntake a break, cause we kind of\nran over on time on this one.\n\n1081\n00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,510\nThe inputs here,\nthere's no new inputs for us.\n\n1082\n00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,824\nIt's all stuff that we're already aware of\nbut we do need to spend some time on our\n\n1083\n00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:23,230\ntools and techniques,\nwe got a lot of good stuff in there.\n\n1084\n00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:29,875\nSo, let's take a break and\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n1085\n00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:34,950\n[SOUND] all right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1086\n00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:39,734\nSo now that we've gathered all of our\ndata together as far as our estimates,\n\n1087\n00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:41,976\nand how long things are gonna take,\n\n1088\n00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:46,878\nnow it's time to do what's called\nSchedule Network Analysis, right here.\n\n1089\n00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:52,641\nNow, if [LAUGH], I need to do microphone\ncable analysis as I trip myself here.\n\n1090\n00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:55,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If we're using project\n\n1091\n00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,120\nmanagement software,\n\n1092\n00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:01,390\nthe whole point of that software is to\ndo schedule network analysis for you.\n\n1093\n01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:05,510\nAnd it's likely already doing\nall sorts of really cool stuff.\n\n1094\n01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:09,070\nSo if you have a fixed work activity and\n\n1095\n01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:12,950\nyou attach three people to it,\nthen it's gonna shorten the time down.\n\n1096\n01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:13,900\nYou attach a fourth person,\n\n1097\n01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,390\nit will shorten it down more and\ndoing that automatically.\n\n1098\n01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,450\nIf you have a fixed\nduration activities and\n\n1099\n01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,300\nyou start adding people, it'll do nothing.\n\n1100\n01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:24,730\nSo it's paying attention to that and\nkeeping track of it for you.\n\n1101\n01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:28,480\nMore importantly, as you start\nsetting up your dependencies, right?\n\n1102\n01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,030\nLinking one activity to the next,\nto the next it's adjusting them and\n\n1103\n01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,950\nmoving them on the calendar to\nlay them out in a realistic time.\n\n1104\n01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:37,440\nIt's doing all of this dynamically.\n\n1105\n01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,200\nAll right.\n\n1106\n01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,210\nIt's also doing something\ncalled Critical Path Method,\n\n1107\n01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:47,140\nCPM, which is showing you\nthe danger zone of your project,\n\n1108\n01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,630\nthe riskiest piece for\nwhere your project may be in danger.\n\n1109\n01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:56,510\nUnfortunately on the exam you're not gonna\nhave that project management software and\n\n1110\n01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:00,050\nyou're going to be expected to be able\nto do all of this stuff in your head.\n\n1111\n01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:03,720\n[CROSSTALK] not in your head necessarily,\nyou have paper you can write on.\n\n1112\n01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,710\nBut you're gonna do it manually.\n\n1113\n01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:09,050\nSo let me just start off by\nshowing you the concept and\n\n1114\n01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,930\nthen we'll take a look at\nhow to do this by hand.\n\n1115\n01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:12,650\nAll right.\n\n1116\n01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:18,450\nSo jumping into this project here,\nI've added some activities and\n\n1117\n01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:21,110\nI've added some dependencies and\nlinked them together.\n\n1118\n01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,650\nAnd this is just a sample project, I've\njust been kinda throwing things into it.\n\n1119\n01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:28,050\nAnd you may have noticed on the right\nside some of the different symbols\n\n1120\n01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,720\nthat we've got, right?\n\n1121\n01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:34,290\nMost of our activities are blue and the\nblue bar is whatever the duration is for\n\n1122\n01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:34,970\nthat activity.\n\n1123\n01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,440\nYou'll notice that some\nof the bars are black.\n\n1124\n01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,163\nThe black ones are roll-ups,\n\n1125\n01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:44,865\nsee how I've got receive 400 computers,\nunbox, set-up, hardware ready.\n\n1126\n01:01:44,865 --> 01:01:47,535\nThat all falls under set up new computers.\n\n1127\n01:01:47,535 --> 01:01:50,645\nSet up new computers is\nnot an activity in and\n\n1128\n01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:54,170\nof itself,\nit's a roll-up of several sub activities.\n\n1129\n01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:58,520\nAnd I can collapse it so that it just\nshows up as that one black bar, so\n\n1130\n01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,600\nthat's what that black bar is.\n\n1131\n01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,550\nThat's not anything special.\n\n1132\n01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:04,727\nYou'll also notice little black diamonds,\n\n1133\n01:02:04,727 --> 01:02:09,880\nwhich are milestones, but you'll notice\nsome other activities that are red, okay?\n\n1134\n01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,070\nSee, this activity here is red.\n\n1135\n01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:12,810\nWhy is it red?\n\n1136\n01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,200\nWhat happened there?\n\n1137\n01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,280\nWell, what happened is,\n\n1138\n01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,440\nmy project management software\nlooked at all of my activities.\n\n1139\n01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:23,010\nAnd they said, okay, if this project is\ngoing to finish as early as possible, or\n\n1140\n01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,550\nif it's gotta finish on a particular date,\n\n1141\n01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:30,600\nwhich pathway through our\nproject takes the most time?\n\n1142\n01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,170\nRight?\n\n1143\n01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:34,580\nWhich one is determining the length\nof our project right now?\n\n1144\n01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,660\nThat one is the critical one.\n\n1145\n01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,250\nAll right, now what do I mean by that?\n\n1146\n01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:43,060\nWell, look at set up new computers,\nin hardware ready, right, these guys.\n\n1147\n01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:46,240\nI've already created some delays\nby extending them out, and so\n\n1148\n01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,350\nyou'll see like it comes along, and\n\n1149\n01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:53,800\nit starts somewhere here around May 14th,\nand then or May 25th.\n\n1150\n01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:58,150\nAnd then it runs along and it ends\nsomewhere here around July 6th, okay.\n\n1151\n01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,890\nWell, it ends, and\nlet me just scroll over,\n\n1152\n01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,780\nwhile the next activity,\ninstall software, continues on.\n\n1153\n01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:12,590\nAnd that install software runs\nall the way here to July 23rd.\n\n1154\n01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:15,240\nSo my project is gonna end on July 23rd,\nand\n\n1155\n01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,050\nit's install software\nthat's determining that.\n\n1156\n01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,500\nAll right.\n\n1157\n01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:23,960\nIf set up new computers gets delayed,\nif it falls behind schedule,\n\n1158\n01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,710\nwell, notice, I've got some leeway here.\n\n1159\n01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:29,300\nI've got some extra space.\n\n1160\n01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:34,290\nThat space is called float, and\nfloat is area where an activity can\n\n1161\n01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:38,490\nbe delayed but\nnot change your overall project schedule.\n\n1162\n01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,190\nIt's not gonna delay our project.\n\n1163\n01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,690\nOur project can still finish on July 23rd.\n\n1164\n01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,030\nThat this activity gets\na little bit behind, okay.\n\n1165\n01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:50,970\nSo any activity that has float that can\nmove like that, that can be delayed and\n\n1166\n01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:54,710\nit's all right,\nthat's just a normal activity.\n\n1167\n01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:58,350\nBut if this activity were\nfall behind schedule,\n\n1168\n01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:01,590\nmy project would then take longer.\n\n1169\n01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:04,649\nAnything that falls behind schedule and\naffects the whole project,\n\n1170\n01:04:04,649 --> 01:04:05,871\nthat's called critical.\n\n1171\n01:04:05,871 --> 01:04:09,684\nAnd somewhere in your\nproject there will be one,\n\n1172\n01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:13,404\nat least one,\nthere might be more than one, but\n\n1173\n01:04:13,404 --> 01:04:18,899\nnormally there's at least one path,\none collection of activities.\n\n1174\n01:04:18,899 --> 01:04:20,888\nWhere from start to end every\nsingle activity is critical and\n\n1175\n01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:22,700\nthat's called the critical path.\n\n1176\n01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,350\nMost project software will highlight\nit in red like what I'm seeing here.\n\n1177\n01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:31,440\nAnd that lets me know if any one of those\nactivities, if any of these red activities\n\n1178\n01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,190\nfall behind schedule, my whole\nproject will fall behind schedule.\n\n1179\n01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:36,720\nRight.\n\n1180\n01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,490\nThat's a big deal.\n\n1181\n01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,920\nRight?\nWe need to be careful with that\n\n1182\n01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,510\nbecause those are the ones\nthat are the most sensitive.\n\n1183\n01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:46,830\nIf some of these other things fall behind,\nit's not a big deal, right?\n\n1184\n01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:51,030\nIn our planning stage we often don't\nknow what are critical path is,\n\n1185\n01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:54,080\nand that's because our durations\nare still somewhat in flux.\n\n1186\n01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,580\nAs we go through and\nwe start assigning durations and\n\n1187\n01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,740\nthings like that,\nwe'll see that things can actually change.\n\n1188\n01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:05,080\nSo while we're planning,\nour critical path might change.\n\n1189\n01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:09,020\nSee how by bumping that up,\nI now have two critical paths?\n\n1190\n01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,360\nNow both of these are tied together.\n\n1191\n01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,670\nIf either one falls behind,\nmy project falls behind.\n\n1192\n01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:20,200\nSo I've created a dual\ncritical path environment.\n\n1193\n01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:25,700\nThat can happen, and so you've got to\nbe sensitive to both of those tracks,\n\n1194\n01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,950\nand it can be where one\ncritical path replaces another.\n\n1195\n01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,100\nThat can happen, too.\n\n1196\n01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,340\nThere's all sorts of various scenarios.\n\n1197\n01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,203\nOh, I've got fixed resources.\n\n1198\n01:05:35,203 --> 01:05:37,501\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's why it's getting upset.\n\n1199\n01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:41,760\nI'm getting weird days in here now\nbecause of my resource availability, but\n\n1200\n01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,890\nthese are all different things\nthat can kinda come into play.\n\n1201\n01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,850\nAnd you've got to watch them and\n\n1202\n01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,480\npay attention to how your\ncalendar's developing.\n\n1203\n01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,910\n>> Yeah, a lot of times on this critical\npath if you're actually using this project\n\n1204\n01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:56,380\nmanagement software, just like Don\npointed out in the areas of float,\n\n1205\n01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,910\nmost of the time when you see\nthis in the critical path,\n\n1206\n01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:03,210\nthis is actually the line of tasks\nwhich tend to have no float in them.\n\n1207\n01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:07,120\nAnd that's why any delay\nalong these ticker tasks\n\n1208\n01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:11,735\nare gonna cause a delay to your actual\nfinish on your overall project so\n\n1209\n01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:15,865\nyou can actually determine it that was too\njust by looking at a lot of times as well.\n\n1210\n01:06:15,865 --> 01:06:19,455\n>> I just modified some of my\ndurations and see what happened.\n\n1211\n01:06:19,455 --> 01:06:21,265\nThis path is no longer critical.\n\n1212\n01:06:21,265 --> 01:06:23,425\nThis other path is now critical.\n\n1213\n01:06:23,425 --> 01:06:27,675\nAny delay on this new path will cause\nmy entire project to be behind but\n\n1214\n01:06:27,675 --> 01:06:31,320\nI've got some room down here where\nI can have delay and I'll be ok.\n\n1215\n01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,490\nNow, how do I know how much delay I\ncan have, and where can I have it?\n\n1216\n01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:38,350\nWell, your project management software\nis figuring that out for you.\n\n1217\n01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:41,090\nBut on the exam we've gotta do it by hand.\n\n1218\n01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:45,280\nAnd so we have what's called the CPM or\nCritical Path Method.\n\n1219\n01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,370\nAnd it uses a standard diagram that,\n\n1220\n01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,520\nI think I brought it up\nin an earlier episode.\n\n1221\n01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,250\nIt looks really intimidating,\nbut it's not that bad.\n\n1222\n01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,690\n>> Nope.\n\n1223\n01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:59,110\n>> Basically you map out\nyour activities like this.\n\n1224\n01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:03,710\nAnd so I've got an activity here and it's\ngot a finish to start relationship with\n\n1225\n01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:07,680\nthese two activities, and then they've got\nfinish to starts with the next one and so\n\n1226\n01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,590\non, as it moves through my project\nto the project end, right.\n\n1227\n01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,570\nSo that's kind of the path.\n\n1228\n01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:17,570\nAnd I just did a simple project here,\nright.\n\n1229\n01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:21,110\nAnd we start off Just by putting\nin some simple labels with\n\n1230\n01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,010\nthe information that we have.\n\n1231\n01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:25,130\nNow you'll see there's several\ndifferent things in here.\n\n1232\n01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:28,300\nLet me just throw in\na little text block here.\n\n1233\n01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:35,420\nAnd basically what we have are- That's\ngonna be really small, isn't it?\n\n1234\n01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,120\nLet me bump this up until it's legible.\n\n1235\n01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,800\nAll right so ES that equals Early Start.\n\n1236\n01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,060\nEF is Early Finish.\n\n1237\n01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:58,500\nWe've got let's see, LS,\n\n1238\n01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:03,850\nwhich is Late Start,\nLF which is Late Finish.\n\n1239\n01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:08,920\nWe've got DU which is Duration.\n\n1240\n01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,810\nAnd I didn't put them on here but\nyou have FF which is Free Float.\n\n1241\n01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:18,230\nAnd TF which is Total Float.\n\n1242\n01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:24,080\nAll right, when you're dealing\nwith the Critical Path Method,\n\n1243\n01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,690\nthese are the values that\nyou're gonna be working with.\n\n1244\n01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,690\nAnd when you get started,\n\n1245\n01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:32,650\na lot of times you only know one of\nthese values which is duration, right?\n\n1246\n01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,500\nWe just did our duration estimates so\nwe have how long each of these are going\n\n1247\n01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,155\nto take and so we can go through and\nplug these into our activities.\n\n1248\n01:08:40,155 --> 01:08:42,630\nAnd I should have labeled these\na little better like activity A,\n\n1249\n01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,320\nactivity B, and so on.\n\n1250\n01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,440\nI just labeled them activity, right.\n\n1251\n01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:49,840\nSo we're gonna do an example and\nget a chance to see what this is like.\n\n1252\n01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,620\nAll right.\n\n1253\n01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:54,600\nI threw an extra square up here to use as\na legend so we could remember what these\n\n1254\n01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,590\nstand for, because we're going\nto put numbers in here and\n\n1255\n01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,120\nit won't necessarily make sense anymore.\n\n1256\n01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:06,334\nI'm going to update these a little bit\nhere to show this is activity A and\n\n1257\n01:09:06,334 --> 01:09:12,360\nthen up here we've got activity B,\nactivity C, and so on.\n\n1258\n01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,295\nThis is turning out to be a little tricky.\n\n1259\n01:09:18,295 --> 01:09:20,465\nBut that way I can just\ntell the activities apart.\n\n1260\n01:09:21,685 --> 01:09:26,775\nSo basically I map it out exactly like I\nwould in my project management software.\n\n1261\n01:09:26,775 --> 01:09:30,285\nJust so I can kind of identify what\nactivities have what relationship.\n\n1262\n01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:34,585\nAnd then all I have to do is go back and\nplug in whatever their duration is.\n\n1263\n01:09:34,585 --> 01:09:37,430\nSo each one has a certain amount\nof time that it's gonna take.\n\n1264\n01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:40,120\nAnd the unit of time we need to determine.\n\n1265\n01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,490\nIs it gonna be an hour,\nis it gonna be a day or whatever?\n\n1266\n01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:48,170\nSo I'm just gonna use days here\n'cause that's gonna be easy for me.\n\n1267\n01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,203\nAll right.\n\n1268\n01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:54,780\nSo there's my activities.\n\n1269\n01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,510\nSo then I go back and\nI plug in their durations.\n\n1270\n01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:01,150\nMy very first activity,\nit is going to have a duration,\n\n1271\n01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:07,350\nlet's just say it is one day, and then\nI'll go through each of the other ones.\n\n1272\n01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:11,350\nMaybe activity B is two days.\n\n1273\n01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:14,390\nActivity C is, maybe it's three days.\n\n1274\n01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,620\nMaybe that's one day,\nand this one's one day.\n\n1275\n01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:21,910\nWe'll do maybe four days for this one and\n\n1276\n01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:27,140\nat the end of my project we'll\nsay this is two more days.\n\n1277\n01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,280\nSo I'm just plugging in my duration.\n\n1278\n01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:35,170\nNow, identifying the critical\npath Is actually really easy.\n\n1279\n01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:39,650\nAll you have to do is look at the multiple\npaths that you have in your project and\n\n1280\n01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,050\nfigure out which one is the longest.\n\n1281\n01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:41,800\nRight?\n\n1282\n01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,040\nI have two paths in my project right now.\n\n1283\n01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,220\nI've got a path that goes A, B, C, F, G,\n\n1284\n01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:52,480\nand I've got another path that goes A,\nD, E, F, G.\n\n1285\n01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,310\nSo, if I come in here and\nwrite those down.\n\n1286\n01:10:54,310 --> 01:11:00,222\nIf I say, it was A,\n\n1287\n01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:05,676\nB, C, F, G, and then there was A,\n\n1288\n01:11:05,676 --> 01:11:10,390\nD, E, F, G, right.\n\n1289\n01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:12,349\nThose are my two paths that I have.\n\n1290\n01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,930\nLet's go a little bigger here.\n\n1291\n01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:16,440\nAll right.\n\n1292\n01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,100\nSo these are the two paths that I have,\nand I just need to add them up, right?\n\n1293\n01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:24,890\nSo, A is one day, B is two days,\nC is three days, F is four days,\n\n1294\n01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:28,230\nand G is off my screen, two days.\n\n1295\n01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,220\nI just need to add these up.\n\n1296\n01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:33,188\nI've got one, three, six, [INAUDIBLE]\n>> 12.\n\n1297\n01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:34,200\n>> 12, right?\n\n1298\n01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,201\nYou'll be my official mathematician for\nthis project.\n\n1299\n01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:38,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so 12.\n\n1300\n01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,350\nThat path is 12 days long.\n\n1301\n01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:45,820\nThe bottom path, well if I add those up,\nright, one plus one plus one.\n\n1302\n01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:49,280\nSo three, seven, nine, all right,\nso the bottom path is nine.\n\n1303\n01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:56,190\nSo the path across the top is 12 days,\nthe path across the bottom is nine days.\n\n1304\n01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:59,530\nThe path across the top\nis the critical path.\n\n1305\n01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:04,040\nIf the path across the top falls behind,\nthe whole project will take longer.\n\n1306\n01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,190\nIf if falls a day behind,\nmy project's now gonna take 13 days.\n\n1307\n01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:11,250\nBut if it's on schedule,\nmy project will take 12 days.\n\n1308\n01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,700\nNow the bottom path is nine days.\n\n1309\n01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:14,661\nSo what if it falls behind?\n\n1310\n01:12:14,661 --> 01:12:18,818\nWhat if it takes ten days, what if takes\n11 days, what if it takes 12 days?\n\n1311\n01:12:18,818 --> 01:12:20,535\nThat's okay.\n\n1312\n01:12:20,535 --> 01:12:25,840\nBecause my project is 12 days long anyway,\nso my project doesn't fall behind.\n\n1313\n01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,330\nThe problem here is,\nI guess it's two fold.\n\n1314\n01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:34,610\nThe main problem is, it's not that I can\nhave three days of delay wherever I want.\n\n1315\n01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:38,040\nIt's that I can have three days\nof delay in very specific places,\n\n1316\n01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,870\nbecause if activity A falls behind,\nthat effects both paths.\n\n1317\n01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:47,850\nIf activity F or activity G falls behind,\nit effects both paths.\n\n1318\n01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:53,020\nSo I can really only have three\ndays of delay in activity D and E.\n\n1319\n01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:57,975\nI can only have delay in activities\nthat aren't shared between the paths\n\n1320\n01:12:57,975 --> 01:13:01,560\ncuz otherwise you're introducing\nthe delay on the other path also.\n\n1321\n01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,700\nAll right, so\n\n1322\n01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:07,340\njust knowing the critical path doesn't\ntell us where we can have delay.\n\n1323\n01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,040\nWe have to do a little bit more\nwork to kind of sort that out and\n\n1324\n01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,120\nfigure out what our float is, okay?\n\n1325\n01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,970\nNow, looking at this,\nthe top half is my critical path.\n\n1326\n01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:21,730\nI've got three days that I\ncan delay if I need to and\n\n1327\n01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:25,730\nI'll see my various paths\nthat I've highlighted.\n\n1328\n01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:30,280\nOn the exam you're gonna see simple\nprojects like this that we can do in our\n\n1329\n01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,620\nhead or with basic calculator work.\n\n1330\n01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:36,720\nIn real life, your project might\nhave thousands of activities.\n\n1331\n01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,860\nYour project might have 50 different paths\nand trying to calculate this stuff out\n\n1332\n01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:45,000\nis a nightmare, and every time you\nchange a duration of even one activity,\n\n1333\n01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,120\nyou have to recalculate it all.\n\n1334\n01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:52,540\nSo doing this by hand is near impossible,\nto do it accurately in real life land.\n\n1335\n01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,500\nAnd that's why we use\nproject management software.\n\n1336\n01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:58,080\nThat's why we have Microsoft Project,\nGanttProject, ProjectLibre,\n\n1337\n01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,980\nwhatever it is that we're using,\nbecause they calculate this for\n\n1338\n01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:03,770\nus across many very complex paths.\n\n1339\n01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:07,670\nMicrosoft Project can calculate\nit across multiple project files.\n\n1340\n01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:09,520\nYou might have five different\nprojects that are running.\n\n1341\n01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,100\nYou can do a path across all of them.\n\n1342\n01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,360\nYou can do some really fancy stuff.\n\n1343\n01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,190\nIt would be a nightmare\nto do that by hand.\n\n1344\n01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:19,210\nBut on the exam, they'll give you\nfairly simple diagrams like this and\n\n1345\n01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:21,630\nyou'll need to calculate\nwhat's the critical path.\n\n1346\n01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:23,880\nAnd you'll see questions\nthat'll say things like,\n\n1347\n01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:28,320\nif this activity now takes this amount of\ntime, what happens with critical path?\n\n1348\n01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,560\nStays the same, changes,\nyou now have two critical paths,\n\n1349\n01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,190\nyou'll have some different options.\n\n1350\n01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:36,120\nSo, you'll need to be able to calculate\nthat out and figure it out and\n\n1351\n01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:40,050\nyou'll need to be able to do it somewhat\nquickly cuz it's a four hour exam.\n\n1352\n01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,640\nAnd you gotta make sure you\nget to all your questions.\n\n1353\n01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,422\nAll right.\n\n1354\n01:14:43,422 --> 01:14:47,200\nSo now know this top\npath is my critical path,\n\n1355\n01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:51,310\nI know I've got three days of float.\n\n1356\n01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,690\nSo I can have some delay\nin that bottom path.\n\n1357\n01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:57,400\nI know that D and\nE are the only non shared activities.\n\n1358\n01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:01,140\nSo, that three days of flow really\njust applies down here on D and E.\n\n1359\n01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:05,020\nAll right, so,\nif that's all I needed, I'm done.\n\n1360\n01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,000\nWas critical path method hard?\n\n1361\n01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,720\nNo.\nIt was pretty intimidating but\n\n1362\n01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,670\nit really was pretty easy.\n\n1363\n01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:13,660\nWell, you might notice these four\nother values we haven't messed with.\n\n1364\n01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,540\nAll right.\n\n1365\n01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:19,760\nThe problem we have here is\nyou have not just float, but\n\n1366\n01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,840\nyou have times when you can use it.\n\n1367\n01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,110\nAnd so,\nfloat gets broken up into two pieces.\n\n1368\n01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:27,490\nTotal float and free float.\n\n1369\n01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,140\nAll right.\n\n1370\n01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:32,150\nThat three days that we just counted,\nthat's called total float.\n\n1371\n01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:38,790\nThat's the total float this path has that,\nif activity D is three days late,\n\n1372\n01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:41,910\nthat doesn't mean activity E can\nbe three days late also, right?\n\n1373\n01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:46,020\nIt's shared, so\nthat's total float for the path.\n\n1374\n01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:49,330\nWe need to look at where it\ncan be used individually and\n\n1375\n01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,810\ncalculate what's called Free Float.\n\n1376\n01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:55,190\nFree Float is where one\nactivity can be delayed and\n\n1377\n01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:58,700\nit doesn't affect any\nother activity whatsoever.\n\n1378\n01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,090\nIt's completely isolated\nin that one activity.\n\n1379\n01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:04,000\nThis will help us to isolate\nwhere that can occur.\n\n1380\n01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,180\nAnd it's even more important when you have\nthings like contractor's scheduled on\n\n1381\n01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:08,520\na specific day.\n\n1382\n01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,570\nJust because you could be late\ndoesn't mean that you really can,\n\n1383\n01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:15,070\ncuz you might have contractors fixed\nto come in at a particular time.\n\n1384\n01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:19,512\nSo Float is very nebulous.\n\n1385\n01:16:19,512 --> 01:16:22,690\nIt comes and\ngoes based on various criteria.\n\n1386\n01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:23,490\nAll right.\n\n1387\n01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,530\nSo how do we use all these other values?\n\n1388\n01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:30,000\nWell, each of these other values captures\na characteristic of an activity.\n\n1389\n01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,330\nEarly start is the earliest,\nbest case scenario,\n\n1390\n01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:36,990\nthe earliest that that\nactivity is able to start.\n\n1391\n01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:41,170\nLate start is worst case scenario.\n\n1392\n01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:45,840\nWhat's the absolute latest that that\nactivity could start without delaying\n\n1393\n01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,380\nthe next person in line.\n\n1394\n01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:49,490\nIt's always thinking about\nthe next person in line.\n\n1395\n01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:50,750\nSame thing with finishing.\n\n1396\n01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:54,640\nWhat's the earliest we could\nfinish best case scenario, and\n\n1397\n01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:59,480\nwhat's the latest we could finish without\nbothering the next person in line?\n\n1398\n01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,060\nOkay?\n\n1399\n01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,720\nSo we've always got to look at\nthat as we calculate along and\n\n1400\n01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,110\nfigure out these values.\n\n1401\n01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:06,720\nSo we're gonna start with the earliest.\n\n1402\n01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,491\nWe start with the best case scenarios and\n\n1403\n01:17:08,491 --> 01:17:10,970\nthen we calculate our\nworst case scenarios.\n\n1404\n01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:16,400\nAnd we're gonna do some basic mathematics,\nand we're gonna go from the beginning of\n\n1405\n01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,660\nthe project to the and when we calculate\nour early's, and then we'll go backwards.\n\n1406\n01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:24,250\nWe'll go from the end of the project\nto the beginning when we calculate\n\n1407\n01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,110\nour late's.\n\n1408\n01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:28,490\nWhat's the latest we can go, you know\nyou have to go backwards for that.\n\n1409\n01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:30,000\nSo we'll start with early's.\n\n1410\n01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,320\nActivity A.\n\n1411\n01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,340\nThis is my very first project or\nmy first activity, so\n\n1412\n01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:38,860\nthe earliest it can start is,\nwell, it's a zero, zero.\n\n1413\n01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:42,460\nRight at the beginning it\ncan get started right away.\n\n1414\n01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:46,860\nAll right, if it starts on day zero and\n\n1415\n01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:53,080\nit's a one-day duration then,\nthe earliest it can finish is day one.\n\n1416\n01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,620\nIt can finish on day one.\n\n1417\n01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:56,880\nAll right.\n\n1418\n01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,650\nIf it finishes on day one,\nwhat about activity B?\n\n1419\n01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:02,890\nWhen can activity B get started?\n\n1420\n01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:07,120\nWell, activity B can get started like to.\n\n1421\n01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,650\nThis is where we start to get some debate.\n\n1422\n01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:12,400\nIt kind of depends on your scheduling,\nright?\n\n1423\n01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,670\nIf you're scheduling certain hours and\nthat one day,\n\n1424\n01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:18,210\nconsume the entire day then yeah,\nthen the realistic start date is day two.\n\n1425\n01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:22,317\nBut, if activity A finished and\nit's still within a particular day,\n\n1426\n01:18:22,317 --> 01:18:25,668\nactivity B might be able to\nstart on day one also, right?\n\n1427\n01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:29,550\nSo, you do need to be aware of that,\nbut I'm gonna go ahead and say day two.\n\n1428\n01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:30,220\nAll right?\n\n1429\n01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:32,670\nCuz that's a little more common,\nall right?\n\n1430\n01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:35,500\nAnd if it starts on day two,\nand it's a two-day duration,\n\n1431\n01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:39,110\nthen the earliest it's gonna\nfinish is day four, right?\n\n1432\n01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:41,700\nNow, meanwhile, activity D down here.\n\n1433\n01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,920\nActivity D,\nit can start on day two also, right?\n\n1434\n01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,270\nAnd it's only one day.\n\n1435\n01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:48,350\nSo, it can finish on day three.\n\n1436\n01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:50,020\nAll right.\nSo, I just plug those values in.\n\n1437\n01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:54,486\nThe earliest they can start and assuming\nwe start on that date, when do we finish?\n\n1438\n01:18:54,486 --> 01:18:57,840\nNow, activity B finishes on day four.\n\n1439\n01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:04,590\nActivity C, assuming that activity B\nfinished, It can start on day five.\n\n1440\n01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:05,800\nAll right?\n\n1441\n01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,830\nAnd if it's a three-day, we're wracking\nour brain here with mathematics,\n\n1442\n01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:12,560\nwe'll add that in, and\nit's gonna finish on day eight, right?\n\n1443\n01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,540\nDown here,\nactivity D finished on day three, so\n\n1444\n01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:19,680\nthe earliest activity E can\nstart would be day four.\n\n1445\n01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,250\nAnd then, it's one day, so\nit'll finish on day five.\n\n1446\n01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:24,730\nAll right.\n\n1447\n01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:25,844\nHere's where things get tricky.\n\n1448\n01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:32,090\nActivity F cannot start until both\n\n1449\n01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:37,690\nActivity C and E have finished, okay,\nthere's a finish to start relationship.\n\n1450\n01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:41,040\nThese two have to finish\nbefore activity F can start.\n\n1451\n01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:45,780\nWell, activity C, best case\nscenario is gonna finish on day 8.\n\n1452\n01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,400\nActivity E is gonna finish on day five.\n\n1453\n01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,960\nWell activity F cannot start on day six,\nright?\n\n1454\n01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,370\nBecause this activity is still going.\n\n1455\n01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:57,250\nSo I have to pick the highest number.\n\n1456\n01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,860\nThe highest number here is eight.\n\n1457\n01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:04,810\nIf it finishes on day eight, then this\nguy right here can start on day nine.\n\n1458\n01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:07,570\nBest case scenario, day nine.\n\n1459\n01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:12,020\nAnd if it starts on day nine and has four\ndays Best finish is going to be day 13.\n\n1460\n01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:14,470\nAll right.\n\n1461\n01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:17,336\nAnd if it finishes on day 13,\nthat takes us to our last activity.\n\n1462\n01:20:17,336 --> 01:20:22,339\nIt will start on day 14, and\nit's going to take two days,\n\n1463\n01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:25,555\nso it will finish on day 16, right?\n\n1464\n01:20:25,555 --> 01:20:27,830\nAnd, oh, shoot.\n\n1465\n01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:30,020\nRonnie, I did bad math.\n\n1466\n01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,830\n>> Oh.\n>> This is why we don't want humans doing\n\n1467\n01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:32,715\nthis stuff.\n\n1468\n01:20:32,715 --> 01:20:35,812\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If we start on day 14, right, we work\n\n1469\n01:20:35,812 --> 01:20:41,640\non day 14, and we work on day 15, so we're\ntechnically done on day 15, not day 16.\n\n1470\n01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,330\nDay 16 we're already done.\n\n1471\n01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:46,180\nI need to go back and update my math.\n\n1472\n01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,870\nSo, like here,\nwhen we said we were one day and\n\n1473\n01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:52,010\nwe finished on day one,\nthis one starts on day two, so\n\n1474\n01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:56,760\nwe work day two, we work day three, so\nwe're actually finishing day three.\n\n1475\n01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:00,190\nSo let me go through and update these\nnumbers real quick to correct that.\n\n1476\n01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:05,120\nSorry guys, it's not the simplest\nmathematics after all.\n\n1477\n01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,700\nSo we've got four, five, six, and\n\n1478\n01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:12,970\ndown here we've got this guy starts on day\ntwo and would finish on day two, right?\n\n1479\n01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:16,250\nSee, it's just one day of work, and so\n\n1480\n01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:22,110\nhere we start on day three and\nwe finish on day three.\n\n1481\n01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:26,210\nIt's one day of work, so here,\n\n1482\n01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:31,970\nthis guy finishes on day six,\nso we start on day seven,\n\n1483\n01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:36,100\nand it's four days of work seven,\neight, nine, ten.\n\n1484\n01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,250\nSo, actually, that would be ten.\n\n1485\n01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,370\nThere we go, and then we continue on.\n\n1486\n01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,450\nThis guy could actually start on 11.\n\n1487\n01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:48,820\nIf I can get in there.\n\n1488\n01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,660\nThere we go.\n\n1489\n01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:50,770\nAnd then finishing on 12.\n\n1490\n01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:51,730\nThere we go.\n\n1491\n01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:52,560\nAll right.\n\n1492\n01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,311\nI knew I was wrong.\n\n1493\n01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:55,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The instant I saw numbers higher than\n\n1494\n01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:56,380\nour path.\n\n1495\n01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,560\n[LAUGH] So when I exceeded our\nduration number, that was my red flag.\n\n1496\n01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,910\nAlways a good idea to go back and\n\n1497\n01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:03,540\ndouble check your math because simple\nmistakes like this can happen.\n\n1498\n01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,640\nSo, now I've got my 12 day right?\n\n1499\n01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,140\nI finish on day 12.\n\n1500\n01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:09,500\nNow things are working out right.\n\n1501\n01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:14,370\nAnd if I look at that path, I have kind\nof a better idea of how things are going.\n\n1502\n01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:18,970\nNow when it comes to calculating\nthe latest that we can finish and\n\n1503\n01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:23,120\nthe latest, what we're thinking\nabout is that day 12 stuff, right.\n\n1504\n01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,580\nRight now, best case scenario,\nwe're going to finish on day 12.\n\n1505\n01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:28,400\nAll right.\n\n1506\n01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,880\nNow I'm going to go backwards and say,\n\n1507\n01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,690\nwhat's the latest that things can\nhappen where we still finish on day 12?\n\n1508\n01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:38,050\nOur best case scenario is day 12,\n\n1509\n01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:41,550\nwhat's the worst that can happen\nwhere we still end up on day 12?\n\n1510\n01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:45,080\nWell, for this last activity,\n\n1511\n01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:50,070\nif the latest we can finish is day 12,\nright, that's when we're trying to finish,\n\n1512\n01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:53,930\nWell, then the latest we can start is\nday 11, there's no change here at all.\n\n1513\n01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:55,960\nAnd you'll see that when\nyou've only got one path.\n\n1514\n01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:56,720\nThere is no change.\n\n1515\n01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,900\nThe early start, late start,\nthey're all the same.\n\n1516\n01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,590\nBut as we branch out,\nthat's where things are gonna change.\n\n1517\n01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:07,730\nSo here, for activity F,\nif the latest this\n\n1518\n01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:11,870\nguy can start is day 11,\nthen the latest we can finish is day ten.\n\n1519\n01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:14,890\nWe've gotta be done, so\nthat that guy can start on day 11.\n\n1520\n01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,300\nAnd if we're gonna finish on day ten,\n\n1521\n01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:21,790\nand we're a four day activity,\nthe latest we can start is day seven.\n\n1522\n01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:25,308\nWe cannot start any later than that,\nif we intend to finish on day ten.\n\n1523\n01:23:25,308 --> 01:23:27,368\nAll right.\n\n1524\n01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:29,850\nNow things start to get a little weird.\n\n1525\n01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:30,610\nAll right.\n\n1526\n01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:35,620\nIf we want to start this guy on day seven,\n\n1527\n01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:40,620\nthen both of these activities\nneed to be done by day six.\n\n1528\n01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:44,350\nIf this guy's gonna start on day seven,\nthese guys have to be done by day six.\n\n1529\n01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:48,790\nSo I can just take their late finishes and\nmake them a six.\n\n1530\n01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,480\nOkay?\nAnd here's where I'm gonna see my\n\n1531\n01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,170\nfirst deviation.\n\n1532\n01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:54,770\nI'm having deviation here cuz\nI got two different paths and\n\n1533\n01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:55,640\ntwo different durations.\n\n1534\n01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,770\nThis one's a three day activity.\n\n1535\n01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:04,830\nSo if it needs to finish on day six,\nit can't start any later than day four.\n\n1536\n01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:09,540\nDay four's the latest we can start, where\nday six is our finish if we're three days.\n\n1537\n01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,440\nRight.\n\n1538\n01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,860\nDown here though,\nwe're just a one day activity.\n\n1539\n01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:18,200\nSo if we want to finish on day six,\nthe latest we could start is day six.\n\n1540\n01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,390\nWe're a one day activity, right?\n\n1541\n01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:24,630\nSo we'll put that in there and now we\nstart to see where we get this variation,\n\n1542\n01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:26,110\nthe flexibility.\n\n1543\n01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:28,670\nAnd I'm just going to go back and\ncontinue to calculate that.\n\n1544\n01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:32,395\nNow the two different pads have two\ndifferent numbers they're working with.\n\n1545\n01:24:32,395 --> 01:24:39,718\nUp here, activity C,\nthe latest it can start is day four,\n\n1546\n01:24:39,718 --> 01:24:45,258\nso activity B has got to\nbe done by day three.\n\n1547\n01:24:45,258 --> 01:24:46,283\nAll right.\nAnd if it's a two day activity the latest\n\n1548\n01:24:46,283 --> 01:24:46,848\nit can start is day two.\n\n1549\n01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:49,820\nThere we go.\n\n1550\n01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:52,162\nAnd down here, activity D.\n\n1551\n01:24:52,162 --> 01:24:56,912\nThe latest it can finish, if we want that\nguy to finish on day six, we need, or\n\n1552\n01:24:56,912 --> 01:24:59,680\nto start on day six,\nwe need to be done by day five.\n\n1553\n01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:05,870\nWe are a one day activity, so if we start\non day five, we finish on day five.\n\n1554\n01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:09,420\nThat frees up activity\nsix to start on day six.\n\n1555\n01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,860\nAll right?\n\n1556\n01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:15,050\nNow, just like before, when we\ncombined and we had to pick the worst.\n\n1557\n01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:16,750\nThat's kinda how we are here.\n\n1558\n01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:20,090\nActivity B,\nthe latest it can start is day two.\n\n1559\n01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:22,330\nCan't start any later than day two.\n\n1560\n01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:27,280\nActivity D could start as late\nas day five if we wanted,\n\n1561\n01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,730\nbut it could start as early as two.\n\n1562\n01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:32,870\nUp here, this guys the more restrictive,\nthat's the one we're gonna go with.\n\n1563\n01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:38,260\nBecause this guy has to start by day two,\nactivity A has got to be wrapped up by\n\n1564\n01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:44,960\nday two and if it's going to wrap up on\nday two then, or if it's gonna be done.\n\n1565\n01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,910\nWe need to be done by day one and\nthat means the latest we can start\n\n1566\n01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:53,320\nis really on day one, I could put\na zero there, but we'll do it that way.\n\n1567\n01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,060\nAll right.\n\n1568\n01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:59,220\nSo now, we did our forward pass,\nand we did our backward pass.\n\n1569\n01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:03,320\nAnd so we figured out the earliest,\nso best case scenario going forward.\n\n1570\n01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,680\nAnd now we've gone backwards\ndoing worst case scenario.\n\n1571\n01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:08,610\nWhat's the worst that could\nhappen going backwards.\n\n1572\n01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:13,760\nAll right, so we've calculated that out,\nwe've kind of moved along figured it out.\n\n1573\n01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,520\nWhat good does that do us?\n\n1574\n01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,070\nWell, now we can use these numbers\nto figure out what our float is,\n\n1575\n01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:21,820\nto figure out the difference.\n\n1576\n01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:26,220\nAnd figuring out float is just\nsimple subtraction, right.\n\n1577\n01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:33,040\nYou take the early start, and the late\nstart, and you subtract the difference.\n\n1578\n01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,100\nYou take the difference between them,\nand that's how much difference,\n\n1579\n01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,980\nhow much float you have.\n\n1580\n01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:43,030\nSo, free float, and it doesn't matter\nif you do the early start late start,\n\n1581\n01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:44,250\nor the early finish late finish,\n\n1582\n01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:47,890\nyou take either one as long as their\nboth finishes or their both starts.\n\n1583\n01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:50,640\nAnd you just take the larger number and\nsubtract the smaller number, and\n\n1584\n01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,600\nyou end up with what your float is, okay?\n\n1585\n01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,160\nSo we can go through and\nwe can look at the float on each one.\n\n1586\n01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:02,370\nNow, the only issue we have with this is,\nwe also need to pay attention to\n\n1587\n01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:07,190\nwhether or not we'll be delaying\nsomebody else down the line.\n\n1588\n01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:10,670\nSo let's talk about total float first, and\n\n1589\n01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:13,580\nthen we'll talk about free\nfloat afterwards, all right?\n\n1590\n01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:17,897\nSo when I take a look at\nlike activity B here,\n\n1591\n01:27:17,897 --> 01:27:24,220\nI'm gonna need to calculate its\ntotal float and its free float.\n\n1592\n01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:32,724\nAll right, and I'm gonna go through and\nwe'll calculate that for\n\n1593\n01:27:32,724 --> 01:27:34,550\neach of our activities.\n\n1594\n01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:38,680\nMost of them are gonna be super easy,\nbecause if you have something that's on\n\n1595\n01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,488\nthe critical path,\nhow much float is it gonna have?\n\n1596\n01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:40,996\n>> None.\n>> None.\n\n1597\n01:27:40,996 --> 01:27:42,500\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n1598\n01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,640\nSo that makes it easy.\n\n1599\n01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,030\nSomething on the critical\npath is easily identifiable,\n\n1600\n01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:49,160\nbecause it cannot be delayed.\n\n1601\n01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,650\nIf it can't be delayed.\n\n1602\n01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:51,220\n>> No float.\n\n1603\n01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:51,770\n>> No float.\n\n1604\n01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:52,460\nYup.\nThat's why.\n\n1605\n01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:53,540\nAll right.\n\n1606\n01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:56,260\nSo I'm just going to add these\nlittle values in here so\n\n1607\n01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,940\nthat we can calculate off of them.\n\n1608\n01:27:59,070 --> 01:27:59,770\nAll right.\n\n1609\n01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:03,820\nSo, like I mentioned the critical\nones are easy to spot.\n\n1610\n01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:06,660\nAnywhere where you've got a single entry,\n\n1611\n01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,880\nlike activity A,\nthere's no deviation there.\n\n1612\n01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,837\nYou can't have flow.\nBut just to be sure, we can do math,\n\n1613\n01:28:11,837 --> 01:28:13,464\none minus one is zero.\n\n1614\n01:28:13,464 --> 01:28:14,485\n>> Zero.\n\n1615\n01:28:14,485 --> 01:28:16,274\n>> Right.\n\n1616\n01:28:16,274 --> 01:28:18,989\nSo our total float on this guy\nis going to be Zero, all right.\n\n1617\n01:28:18,989 --> 01:28:23,400\nAnd as we start to go through each of\nthe other ones we can see the same thing.\n\n1618\n01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:27,320\nHere activity B, we've got two\nminus two or three minus three,\n\n1619\n01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,010\neither one, gives us a zero.\n\n1620\n01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:33,830\nSame thing here on activity C and\nactivities F and G.\n\n1621\n01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,770\nI knew the top ones would be zero cuz we\nalready know they're our critical path.\n\n1622\n01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,350\nThey're the longest path in our project.\n\n1623\n01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:41,370\nAnd here we can figure out this way.\n\n1624\n01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:43,710\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwhy bother with all this?\n\n1625\n01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:46,850\nIf I already knew the top half\nwas the longest, why bother?\n\n1626\n01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:51,080\nWell, in a complex project where you've\ngot a number of different paths,\n\n1627\n01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,330\nyou may not be able to spot\nwhich one is the longest, so\n\n1628\n01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:56,890\ndoing this math right here says,\nwe don't need to spot the longest.\n\n1629\n01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:58,630\nThe longest one will tell us where it is.\n\n1630\n01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:01,450\nIt'll tell us where it is by\nhaving all zeroes along it.\n\n1631\n01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:03,630\nNow we just look for\na path with all zeroes for total float.\n\n1632\n01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:04,440\nThat's our critical path.\n\n1633\n01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:08,620\nThe bottom path, here, though,\nwe'll see differences.\n\n1634\n01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:13,160\nRight, so six minus three, five minus two.\n\n1635\n01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:17,112\nBoth of those if I do five minus two\nI've got three days of total float.\n\n1636\n01:29:17,112 --> 01:29:20,863\nAnd activity E, six minus three,\nI can come in here and\n\n1637\n01:29:20,863 --> 01:29:23,628\nsay that's three days of total float.\n\n1638\n01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:28,106\nNow I can see if I,\nlet me zoom out a little bit.\n\n1639\n01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,640\nCan I get this whole thing on my screen?\n\n1640\n01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:32,382\nProbably not.\n\n1641\n01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,740\nWell, we can see it right here.\n\n1642\n01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:39,010\nSo I have zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.\n\n1643\n01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:44,720\nZero, I've got zero, three,\nthree, zero, and so on, right?\n\n1644\n01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:49,430\nSo looking at it this way I can\nsee where my float resides.\n\n1645\n01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:52,550\nNot just the fact that I have\nthree days of float on that path,\n\n1646\n01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:54,980\nI can see where I'm allowed to use it.\n\n1647\n01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:57,740\nI can't use it on activity A,\nI can't use it on activity F or\n\n1648\n01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:00,230\nG, cause that'll delay the whole project.\n\n1649\n01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:05,550\nBut these guys are sharing three\ndays that they can use and\n\n1650\n01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:08,400\nnot affect the project as a whole.\n\n1651\n01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,150\nAll right.\n\n1652\n01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:12,980\nThat is total float, and\nit's pretty easy to calculate.\n\n1653\n01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,750\nYou just take Early Start,\n\n1654\n01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:17,680\nEarly Finish, subtract the smaller\nnumber from the larger number.\n\n1655\n01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,960\nWhat's left, there's your flow.\n\n1656\n01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,730\nOr you can do it with the starts or\n\n1657\n01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:25,040\nyou can do it with the finishes,\nwhichever you want.\n\n1658\n01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,430\nDid I say start early, finish?\n\n1659\n01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:30,850\nIt would be early start, late start,\nor early finish, late finish.\n\n1660\n01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:31,680\nLet me just clarify that.\n\n1661\n01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,720\nYou're always dealing with the same ones,\nyeah.\n\n1662\n01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:38,690\nYou would get weird stuff,\nif we did early start and early finish,\n\n1663\n01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:41,580\nyou'd end up with one,\nand that's not right.\n\n1664\n01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:44,080\nOkay, so now we've got our total float.\n\n1665\n01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,760\nSo what is free float?\n\n1666\n01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,880\nWell free float is the amount\nof time we can delay\n\n1667\n01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:54,840\nwithout affecting the next person in line.\n\n1668\n01:30:54,840 --> 01:31:02,150\nAnd what we do here with this one, is we\nbasically take whatever our finish is,\n\n1669\n01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:07,090\nokay, and we compare our late finish.\n\n1670\n01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:10,960\nTo the next person's,\nthe latest that we can finish.\n\n1671\n01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,180\nWell actually hang on,\nlet me make sure I'm doing this right.\n\n1672\n01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:18,960\nIt would be our late finish and we compare\nthat with the early start of the next guy.\n\n1673\n01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:25,005\nAll right, if there's a difference\nActually, did I do my numbers wrong?\n\n1674\n01:31:25,005 --> 01:31:26,537\nHere, let me make sure I've\ngot this math right, here.\n\n1675\n01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:32,206\nOh, sorry.\n\n1676\n01:31:32,206 --> 01:31:33,255\nI see what I'm doing.\n\n1677\n01:31:33,255 --> 01:31:34,720\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n1678\n01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,840\nWe look at when we're gonna finish, right?\n\n1679\n01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:41,660\nSo this one, if it finished on day five,\nwhat's gonna happen is activity E is going\n\n1680\n01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:44,040\nto have to move to accommodate that,\nright?\n\n1681\n01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,640\nSo starting at day five, for\n\n1682\n01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:50,570\nus, is going to affect somebody down\nthe line and cause a problem, right?\n\n1683\n01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:53,470\nIf I finish at day five,\nit's no longer possible for\n\n1684\n01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:56,100\nactivity E to finish on day three, right?\n\n1685\n01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,070\nOr to start on day three,\nit's gonna have to move.\n\n1686\n01:31:59,070 --> 01:32:04,200\nBut if we look at activity E,\nit could finish as late as day six.\n\n1687\n01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,960\nAnd if it did, if it finished at day six,\n\n1688\n01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,570\nwould that affect the early\nstart of this guy?\n\n1689\n01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:10,330\nNo.\n\n1690\n01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:13,600\nIf we finished as late as possible here,\n\n1691\n01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,160\nthe Early Start of F\nwould not move at all.\n\n1692\n01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:17,860\nRight.\n\n1693\n01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:22,470\nThat means we could be late\nwithout effecting the next guy.\n\n1694\n01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,810\nOver here, activity D,\n\n1695\n01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:29,020\nif we finish on day five, the early start\nof activity E would no longer be valid.\n\n1696\n01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:31,180\nWe effected, we've moved it.\n\n1697\n01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:33,440\nOur late finish.\n\n1698\n01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,540\nIs higher than the early\nstart of the next activity.\n\n1699\n01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,810\nThe other activity has to move, okay.\n\n1700\n01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:40,950\nAnd doing the math,\nI'm trying to do the math in my head,\n\n1701\n01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:43,000\nmathematically this looks really weird.\n\n1702\n01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,780\nBut if you think about it common\nsense wise, if this one goes late,\n\n1703\n01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,140\ndoes it delay the next one?\n\n1704\n01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:48,690\nYes.\n\n1705\n01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:49,330\nAll right.\n\n1706\n01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:53,160\nIf that happens,\nthen you don't have free flow.\n\n1707\n01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:56,160\nFree flow is movement you\ncan have in one activity.\n\n1708\n01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,490\nThat doesn't affect anyone else.\n\n1709\n01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:01,130\nNo one else feels the repercussions.\n\n1710\n01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:05,900\nWell, activity D, when it's done,\nactivity E can immediately start.\n\n1711\n01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:09,400\nSo any delay whatsoever right here.\n\n1712\n01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,370\nIs going to affect activity E.\n\n1713\n01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:17,970\nSo while we have three days of total\nfloat, we have zero days of free float.\n\n1714\n01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:22,090\nThere's zero days that we can use\nwithout affecting anybody else.\n\n1715\n01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:24,970\nAlright, meanwhile activity E,\n\n1716\n01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:29,080\nif it finishes on day three\nActivity F still can't start.\n\n1717\n01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:33,920\nIf it finishes on day six,\nactivity F will start the next day, but\n\n1718\n01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,750\nthat's its plan anyway, right?\n\n1719\n01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:39,780\nSo, any variation there, we have, and\n\n1720\n01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:43,180\nso we just subtract that out, and\nit's basically our total float here.\n\n1721\n01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:45,800\nAnd we'll end up with that\nvalue of three there also.\n\n1722\n01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:48,710\nSo activity E has three days of free flow.\n\n1723\n01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:52,650\nIf activity E runs behind\nno one will notice.\n\n1724\n01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:57,030\nIt's not going to effect any other\nactivity what so ever right.\n\n1725\n01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:59,670\nI need to know this as the project manager\n\n1726\n01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:03,590\nbecause that says if this runs behind I\ndon't have to take any actions right.\n\n1727\n01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:05,080\nBut activity D,\n\n1728\n01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,720\nif it falls behind it's not the end of the\nworld right it's not on the critical path.\n\n1729\n01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:13,280\nBut if it falls behind, I need to call the\npeople that are working on this activity.\n\n1730\n01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,890\nAnd I need to tell them hey guys\nyou're going to be starting a little\n\n1731\n01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:16,610\nbit late right.\n\n1732\n01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:19,840\nYou're going to start late because\nthese guys aren't done yet.\n\n1733\n01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,800\nIt doesn't effect the whole project.\n\n1734\n01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,360\nOur deadline is still on day 12.\n\n1735\n01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,920\nBut, I still have to move this guy.\n\n1736\n01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,590\nSo, free float is awesome.\n\n1737\n01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:31,570\nAnybody can do free float and it's great.\n\n1738\n01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:34,700\nIt doesn't affect anybody else and\nI'm not gonna take any action.\n\n1739\n01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:38,340\nBut, you don't have it in most cases.\n\n1740\n01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,000\nMost of the time you just have\nwhat's called total float.\n\n1741\n01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,970\nAnd total float is gonna\nrequire some work on our part.\n\n1742\n01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:45,940\nAny time we use it,\nwe have to contact everyone\n\n1743\n01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:49,910\nelse that's sharing that total float and\nlet them know that we're moving back.\n\n1744\n01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:53,080\nAnd if it's a contractor with\na constraint on their start date.\n\n1745\n01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> We may not be able to do that.\n\n1746\n01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:58,920\nSo, even though we have total float,\nwe might not be able to use it here.\n\n1747\n01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:02,330\nIf activity E has to start\non a particular day,\n\n1748\n01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:04,630\nI don't care that there's\ntotal float here.\n\n1749\n01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:08,660\nI can't use it, because these guys\nhave to start on a particular day.\n\n1750\n01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:10,022\nThat's why we need to know free float.\n\n1751\n01:35:10,022 --> 01:35:11,550\nAll right.\n\n1752\n01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:14,660\nNow on your critical path\nyou've got zero total float so\n\n1753\n01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:19,420\nyou've got zero free float also\nright that's just how it works.\n\n1754\n01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:24,754\nSo we can go through and\npopulate that across these.\n\n1755\n01:35:30,581 --> 01:35:31,359\nThere we go.\n\n1756\n01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:37,004\nAll right, so that is calculating\nyour critical path by hand and\n\n1757\n01:35:37,004 --> 01:35:40,530\ncalculating your float by hand.\n\n1758\n01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:42,980\nYou need to know how to\ndo that on the exam.\n\n1759\n01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,180\n>> Right.\n>> All right?\n\n1760\n01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:45,970\nWhat's the best way to do it?\n\n1761\n01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:46,820\nPractice.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1762\n01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:47,480\n>> Right?\n\n1763\n01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,740\nMake a chart.\n\n1764\n01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:52,380\nMake a chart like this and\njust leave the boxes empty.\n\n1765\n01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:54,830\nIn fact, on the exam,\nthey'll give you the numbers, and\n\n1766\n01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:55,760\nthey won't tell you what they are.\n\n1767\n01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,420\nThey won't have this legend that I\nmade right here that tells us which\n\n1768\n01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,350\none is early and late or whatever.\n\n1769\n01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:03,650\nThey're gonna give you a box like this,\nand\n\n1770\n01:36:03,650 --> 01:36:06,190\nyou need to know what each\nof these numbers represents.\n\n1771\n01:36:06,190 --> 01:36:10,055\nI've written them here like they are in\nthe pin bot, so this is what you'll see.\n\n1772\n01:36:10,055 --> 01:36:15,325\nYou need to know that this two is duration\nand that this two is the late start.\n\n1773\n01:36:15,325 --> 01:36:16,162\nYou need to know which.\n\n1774\n01:36:16,162 --> 01:36:17,079\nWhich is which.\n\n1775\n01:36:17,079 --> 01:36:17,717\nAll right?\n\n1776\n01:36:17,717 --> 01:36:19,377\nSo, create a blank sheet of paper.\n\n1777\n01:36:19,377 --> 01:36:24,200\nWrite a project path, a diagram on there.\n\n1778\n01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,500\nLeave all the blanks empty, and\nthen just photocopy it a few times, and\n\n1779\n01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:31,130\nthen just write random durations\nthrough it, and start calculating.\n\n1780\n01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:32,500\nGo forward, go back.\n\n1781\n01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,490\nDo your forward paths,\nyour backward paths.\n\n1782\n01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:35,250\nRun through it.\n\n1783\n01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:37,540\nThe more you do it,\nthe more comfortable you'll get.\n\n1784\n01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:42,622\nAnd what I like to do, is I like to stick\nit into project management software also,\n\n1785\n01:36:42,622 --> 01:36:44,030\nto check the numbers.\n\n1786\n01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:47,149\nYou adjust your durations here,\nand you see your critical path.\n\n1787\n01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:49,807\nYou go to your project management\nsoftware, you punch it in there, and\n\n1788\n01:36:49,807 --> 01:36:51,149\nyou see it to verify you're right.\n\n1789\n01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:54,060\nSo really easy to do.\n\n1790\n01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:54,970\nWork through it.\n\n1791\n01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:59,190\nIf this is the first time you've seen\nthis done by hand, it's a little complex.\n\n1792\n01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:02,120\nI mean you saw, I messed up my numbers and\nhad to correct them there, right?\n\n1793\n01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:06,180\nThe more you do it, the more you get\nused to it, the more it makes sense.\n\n1794\n01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:07,940\nThis is critical path management.\n\n1795\n01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:10,840\nAll right.\n\n1796\n01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,700\nThe book, the pin box does call out one\n\n1797\n01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:17,980\nextra thing we should be aware of which\nis what's called critical chain method.\n\n1798\n01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:20,250\nCritical chain method is almost the same.\n\n1799\n01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:23,040\nThe difference is\nthe critical chain method\n\n1800\n01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,820\ndoesn't put durations\non the activity itself.\n\n1801\n01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:31,740\nIt puts the durations on the connections,\non the relationships between them and\n\n1802\n01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:36,310\nso it represents float\nas an actual activity.\n\n1803\n01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:38,060\nThe float looks like an activity.\n\n1804\n01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,030\nThe reserve or\n\n1805\n01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:42,175\nwhatever looks like an activity,\neven though it's not a work action.\n\n1806\n01:37:42,175 --> 01:37:44,495\nSo it's a weird way of\nrepresenting things.\n\n1807\n01:37:44,495 --> 01:37:47,095\nIt's not something you see very often.\n\n1808\n01:37:47,095 --> 01:37:49,645\nSo in the PMBOK,\nI don't think they even show a picture.\n\n1809\n01:37:49,645 --> 01:37:50,255\n>> No.\nOf it in there.\n\n1810\n01:37:50,255 --> 01:37:52,015\nThey just mention what it is.\n\n1811\n01:37:52,015 --> 01:37:54,440\nSo be aware that there is\nan alternative to this.\n\n1812\n01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,100\nIt's just, it's kind of weird.\n\n1813\n01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,970\nYou have an activity and it's duration\nis attached to this arrow, snd so\n\n1814\n01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:02,930\nit's a different representation.\n\n1815\n01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:07,390\nAnd if you have float, we would actually\nhave another activity like right here,\n\n1816\n01:38:07,390 --> 01:38:10,500\nthat would be a three day activity,\nit would be five day reserve.\n\n1817\n01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:14,210\nAnd that would mean that\nit's extra room that we had.\n\n1818\n01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:17,570\nLet me see if I can find\na Google picture or something.\n\n1819\n01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:22,510\nLet's see here.\n\n1820\n01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:25,460\nIf we do critical chain method.\n\n1821\n01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:29,520\nHere's a good one.\n\n1822\n01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,490\nYep.\n\n1823\n01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:32,000\nAll right, who is this from?\n\n1824\n01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,830\nPM Knowledge Center.\n\n1825\n01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:34,650\nI want to reference who they are.\n\n1826\n01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:35,750\nSo they've got a good one here,\n\n1827\n01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:38,810\nbecause see what it's doing is\nwe've got these activities, and\n\n1828\n01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:43,940\nyou'll see how the arrows actually have\ninformation associated with them, and\n\n1829\n01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:49,670\nso here's activities six,\neight, two, four, one.\n\n1830\n01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:50,710\nIt's kind of all over the place, right?\n\n1831\n01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:52,050\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n1832\n01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:53,800\nSo, there they are.\nThere's the activity numbers.\n\n1833\n01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:58,490\nBut the durations, this is a 6 day right\nhere, this is a 4 day, this is a 2 day.\n\n1834\n01:38:58,490 --> 01:39:01,330\nThis is the longest path,\nso they've done it in red.\n\n1835\n01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:07,460\nAnd then up here we've got 1 day,\n1 day, got 3 days, 2 day, 1 day, right?\n\n1836\n01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:08,310\nIt's there.\n\n1837\n01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:11,750\nAnd see how you've got these green boxes?\n\n1838\n01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,660\nThat's that reserve that\nthey're demonstrating.\n\n1839\n01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:17,010\nSo, you likely won't see this on the exam,\nbut\n\n1840\n01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:20,180\nyou might see it as an incorrect\nanswer somewhere, but\n\n1841\n01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:23,990\ncritical chain method is just a different\nway of representing that same data.\n\n1842\n01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:27,830\nIt's a little harder to calculate this way\nwhich is why we don't see it very often.\n\n1843\n01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,660\nCritical Path Method is\ngenerally more accepted.\n\n1844\n01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:33,200\nAll right.\n\n1845\n01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,700\nRonnie, that was a lot of stuff, right?\n\n1846\n01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:36,380\n>> It was.\n>> So let's see where we're at.\n\n1847\n01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:38,280\nThis might be a good spot to wrap it.\n\n1848\n01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:45,170\nSo, we took a look at Schedule Network\nAnalysis, so we're analyzing our schedule,\n\n1849\n01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:47,610\nlooking for where we have room,\nwhere we can move things.\n\n1850\n01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:50,370\nWe talked about critical path and\ncritical chain.\n\n1851\n01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:53,260\nWe still have a lot of other stuff to talk\nright here right here on this schedule.\n\n1852\n01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:56,520\nThis is one of the most important\nprocesses that we have but\n\n1853\n01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,950\nI don't want to go on too long,\nit will blow our minds.\n\n1854\n01:39:58,950 --> 01:40:01,250\nSo let's do this,\nthis was time management part two.\n\n1855\n01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:03,210\nThere's going to be a time\nmanagement part three, right?\n\n1856\n01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:06,598\nEvery good movie has a trilogy, right?\n\n1857\n01:40:06,598 --> 01:40:10,970\nEasily If we follow the rules of\nthe trilogy we have some kind of amazing\n\n1858\n01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:12,130\nclosure At the end of the next one.\n\n1859\n01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:15,150\nSo we'll see how that goes, but\ndefinitely stay tuned for that.\n\n1860\n01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:18,100\nIn part three we're gonna move\nthrough the rest of our tools and\n\n1861\n01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,520\nthen we'll see actually creating\nthat schedule baseline.\n\n1862\n01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,120\nThe schedule that we start work\nwith when we go into execute.\n\n1863\n01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:24,190\n>> Right.\n>> All right.\n\n1864\n01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:25,800\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n1865\n01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:29,411\nLet me remind you guys that if you\nhave any questions on this stuff,\n\n1866\n01:40:29,411 --> 01:40:30,390\nfeel free to ask.\n\n1867\n01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:33,210\nLive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1868\n01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:34,500\nYou'll see the chat room.\n\n1869\n01:40:34,500 -->

Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,610\n>> I am sad today,\n\n7\n00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,190\nbecause I have learned that Macaulay\nCulkin has a band that honors pizza.\n\n8\n00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,880\nThat's a little bit unusual.\n\n9\n00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,850\n>> That's his life mission?\n\n10\n00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,054\n>> That is, yeah.\n>> That's what he's gained from\n\n11\n00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:52,934\na career in Hollywood acting?\n\n12\n00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:53,793\n>> Yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:56,013\nAfter his one particular apode.\n\n14\n00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:59,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the only thing you know him for.\n\n15\n00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,110\nAnd now,\nhe's honoring pizza through a band.\n\n16\n00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,120\n>> You know, it's not uncommon for\na celebrity to choose a cause.\n\n17\n00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,800\nWe haven't chosen our charities yet.\n\n18\n00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,785\nYou know, you've got Bono, who is helping\nto fight AIDS across the world and stuff.\n\n19\n00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:14,030\nAnd Macaulay Culkin,\nwho is promoting pizza awareness.\n\n20\n00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,920\nSo good to know.\n\n21\n00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,457\nNow, in the world of pizza awareness.\n\n22\n00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:22,790\nOne of the big things that we\nhave to worry about is schedule.\n\n23\n00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,880\nHow do you have time with a busy career,\nas Macaulay Culkin I'm sure has.\n\n24\n00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,330\nHow do you find the time\nto get things done?\n\n25\n00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,750\nSo that's what we've spent\nour last two episodes on.\n\n26\n00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,730\nAnd we're back again, for\npart three of schedule management.\n\n27\n00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,850\nWe already went through all of our inputs,\nand\n\n28\n00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,060\nwe went through maybe about half\nof our tools and techniques.\n\n29\n00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,120\nBut even though it was only half,\nthey were big.\n\n30\n00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,115\nSo we went through our\ncritical path method, our CPM.\n\n31\n00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:55,150\nWe talked a little bit about critical\nchain, and got a chance to see those.\n\n32\n00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,880\nWe did our mathematical operations,\nif I can say it.\n\n33\n00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,250\nFor calculating out the forward pass and\n\n34\n00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,910\nbackward pass to calculate out your float,\nyour total float and free float.\n\n35\n00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,580\nAnd so today, we're gonna continue\non kind of working with that.\n\n36\n00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,570\nSo by this stage in our project,\n\n37\n00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,770\nwe should have a pretty good idea\nof what activities need to be done.\n\n38\n00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,590\nThe sequence those activities\nare going to occur in, and\n\n39\n00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,630\nhow long each one's going to take.\n\n40\n00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,640\nThat was part of the estimate\nactivity duration process.\n\n41\n00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,820\nSo what we're left with is actually\ncreating the schedule, right?\n\n42\n00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,040\nSo, develop the schedule, and\nthat critical path chart that we did,\n\n43\n00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,160\nthat's pretty close to what\nyour schedule's going to be.\n\n44\n00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,520\nIn fact, the only thing it\ndidn't have were real dates,\n\n45\n00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,430\nreal live dates that we can act upon.\n\n46\n00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,500\nIt just had, hey,\nthis is gonna happen on day one.\n\n47\n00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,980\nThis is gonna happen on day five.\n\n48\n00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,500\nThis is gonna happen on day ten.\n\n49\n00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,550\nWell what day is day ten?\n\n50\n00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,430\nIs day ten March 1st, 2014?\n\n51\n00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,170\nOr is it March 1st, 2020?\n\n52\n00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,540\nRight?\n\n53\n00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,790\nWhat is that particular day, and\n\n54\n00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,230\nthat's what we've gotta kinda sort out\nhere in the last part of scheduling.\n\n55\n00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,910\nSo let me bring up my diagram and\nthis guy right here.\n\n56\n00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,350\nAnd basically we went through\nall our inputs which is\n\n57\n00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,830\npretty much every document\nwe've generated so far.\n\n58\n00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,220\nAnd we got through number three here,\nas far as our tools and techniques.\n\n59\n00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,550\nEverything else that we see after this,\nso from four down,\n\n60\n00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:32,190\nis focused on getting real dates attached\nto when this stuff is going to happen.\n\n61\n00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,770\nAnd the first one that we've got is what's\ncalled resource optimization techniques.\n\n62\n00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,940\nWhen you're juggling activities, somebody,\nsome human being at some point or\n\n63\n00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,420\nanother is gonna be the person responsible\nfor making that activity happen.\n\n64\n00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,380\nSo if I have an activity that says,\ninstall 15 routers and\n\n65\n00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,350\nconfigure the routing protocol.\n\n66\n00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,030\nAnd I want Ronnie to do it,\nRonnie is now my resource.\n\n67\n00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,840\nSo I've got to plan around his\ncalendar and what he's doing and\n\n68\n00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,220\nI've got his resource calendar\nhere as one of my inputs.\n\n69\n00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,590\nSo I had to plan around that.\n\n70\n00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,480\nAnd then I have to find ways to\noptimize the time that I've got him.\n\n71\n00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,510\nBecause I don't necessarily\nhave him open ended.\n\n72\n00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,510\nSo we've got a couple of tools\nthat are available for us.\n\n73\n00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,910\nI'm just gonna bring up our notes here.\n\n74\n00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,950\nSo when we talk about our tools and\ntechniques and\n\n75\n00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,930\nwe look at our resource optimization.\n\n76\n00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,390\nPOI calls out two in specific.\n\n77\n00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:32,282\nSo they talk about resource leveling and\nresource smoothing.\n\n78\n00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:37,980\nAll right, these two things right here\nare very similar and very easy to confuse.\n\n79\n00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,300\nSo we have to be careful,\nbecause they kind of work the same way.\n\n80\n00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,380\nAll right?\n\n81\n00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,310\nResource leveling,\nthat's where I say, all right.\n\n82\n00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,130\nI've got an activity that\nneeds to be performed.\n\n83\n00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,230\nAnd it is a 24 hour activity.\n\n84\n00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:56,085\nAnd that means it's going to take\n24 man hours of work to get done.\n\n85\n00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:59,245\nPMI doesn't use these terms specifically,\nbut Microsoft does.\n\n86\n00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,675\nYou have duration which PMI recognizes.\n\n87\n00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:04,175\nBut you also have effort, and\n\n88\n00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:07,725\neffort is a term that we see in a lot\nof project management software.\n\n89\n00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,860\nThat's not saying this is gonna\ntake 24 hours to get it done.\n\n90\n00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,270\nIt's gonna say that there's 24\nhours of actual work to be done.\n\n91\n00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,845\nAnd so, if I have two people,\nI can get it done in 12 hours,\n\n92\n00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:20,100\ncause I've got two people both working.\n\n93\n00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,590\nSo one hour passes,\nthey just did two hours of work.\n\n94\n00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,240\nIf I have three people working,\n\n95\n00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,090\nI can do three hours of work in\neach real hour as we progress.\n\n96\n00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,740\nSo you have that duration and effort,\nor the actual work being done.\n\n97\n00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,380\nSo when I look at Ronnie, there's only so\nmuch work that he can do during a day.\n\n98\n00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,630\nWorking a standard work week,\nthat's about eight hours of work per day.\n\n99\n00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,420\nSo, if you do a 40 work week, five days\na week, you're working eight hours.\n\n100\n00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,330\nIf I look at his schedule and\nI assign him a 24 hour activity.\n\n101\n00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,220\nAn activity that's going to\ntake 24 hours of his time.\n\n102\n00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,536\nAnd he's only working 8 hours a day, how\nlong is that going to take him to do it?\n\n103\n00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:02,140\nI could give him 24 hours\nin 1 day if I wanted.\n\n104\n00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,880\nGood luck, Ronnie.\n\n105\n00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,760\nHere you go, get to work.\n\n106\n00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,600\nDon't sleep.\n\n107\n00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,190\nNo lunch breaks.\n\n108\n00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,460\nBut it's not realistic.\n\n109\n00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,010\nRight.\n\n110\n00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,030\nSo instead we do what's\ncalled resource leveling.\n\n111\n00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,180\nAnd resource leveling is\nwhere we take Ronnie, and\n\n112\n00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,650\nwe say he's gotta do 24 hours of work.\n\n113\n00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,920\nBut he's only working 8 hours a day so\nI've got to spread that over three days.\n\n114\n00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,590\nThree days working eight a day,\nRonnie would get 24 hours of work done.\n\n115\n00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,570\nSo while the activity itself is 24 hours,\nand in theory could be done in one day.\n\n116\n00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,970\nNow it's gonna take three days because\nit's just Ronnie working on it, and\n\n117\n00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,340\nI need to spread it out so\nI'm not paying overtime.\n\n118\n00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,200\nThat's the basic premise\nbehind resource leveling.\n\n119\n00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,980\nAs we start to add resources or\n\n120\n00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,660\ntake away resources, our project schedule\nmay get longer or shorter depending.\n\n121\n00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,770\nIt does go both ways.\n\n122\n00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,700\nLet me see if I can work\nup an example here.\n\n123\n00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:02,140\nI should have thrown on Microsoft Project\ncause it does a really good job with this.\n\n124\n00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,720\nWorking with something like Project Libre\nI don't have a ton of experience with, but\n\n125\n00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,420\nlet's see if it will do leveling for\nus kind of automatic.\n\n126\n00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,000\nSo when I come in here and\nI create a task.\n\n127\n00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,800\nRight?\nSo I'm just going to have Task 7.\n\n128\n00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,360\nAnd for\nTask 7 I'm not going to list a duration.\n\n129\n00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,010\nLet's see,\ndoes it track a estimate here, work.\n\n130\n00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,305\nSee how the duration is one day,\nand then work is eight hours.\n\n131\n00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:30,220\nOkay.\n\n132\n00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,102\nIt's eight hours and if I bump that up I'm\ngoing to say this is 24 hours of work.\n\n133\n00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:38,610\nAll right,\nnow the duration is still one day.\n\n134\n00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,860\nI'm saying that it's 24 hours of work, and\n\n135\n00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,810\nwhen I say that, you'll notice that now\nthat duration changed to three days.\n\n136\n00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,765\nIt's 24 hours of work being\ndone over three days.\n\n137\n00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:53,359\nBecause it's assuming one person\nworking eight hours a day, right?\n\n138\n00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:56,186\nAnd, I'm going to move this\nstart date to a Monday, so\n\n139\n00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:58,710\nwe'll be able to see this\na little more clearly.\n\n140\n00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,940\nLet's take it to.\n\n141\n00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,150\nNope, that's not what I wanted.\n\n142\n00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,690\nThere we go.\n\n143\n00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,250\nThere it is.\n\n144\n00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,830\nSo, I've got it on three days.\n\n145\n00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,037\nYou know, I need to move it to\nthe future or it's gonna be mad at me.\n\n146\n00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:21,936\nIf you try and schedule something in the\npast, it's gonna show as behind schedule,\n\n147\n00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:22,820\nso there we go.\n\n148\n00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,180\n>> Let me go to a different year.\n\n149\n00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,060\n>> I know, now we're way off.\n\n150\n00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,910\nSee?\n\n151\n00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,450\nThis is\n>> There we go.\n\n152\n00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,950\n>> This is why you need\na good project manager.\n\n153\n00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,060\nSo there we go.\n\n154\n00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,590\nI'm gonna go under my resources and\n\n155\n00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,140\nI'm just gonna create a couple of\npeople here on my resource sheet.\n\n156\n00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,800\nSo I'll create a, maybe there's\nsome kind of programming job.\n\n157\n00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,460\nAnd so I've got Developer 1,\nDeveloper 2, and Developer 3.\n\n158\n00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,130\nSo I've got three people\navailable to do work.\n\n159\n00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,120\nAnd I'm just using my default resource\ncalendar, which is eight hours a day,\n\n160\n00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,010\nMonday through Friday.\n\n161\n00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,670\nWhen I go back to my task view here, and\n\n162\n00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,490\nI take task 7, I left the duration in\nestimate, so it's calculating that out.\n\n163\n00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,460\nThe work I set at 24 hours.\n\n164\n00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,920\nAnd if I come in here and\nI start to assign some resources, so\n\n165\n00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,453\nI'm going to assign Developer 1, 2, and\n\n166\n00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:17,410\n3, and I'm gonna assign those out.\n\n167\n00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,140\nSo now Developer 1, 2, and 3 are attached.\n\n168\n00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,517\nNow that there's three people attached,\nIt's going to go and, see it didn't\n\n169\n00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:31,428\ndo the calculation, all right let's\nsee if we can't change this here.\n\n170\n00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:38,344\nI am gonna put each one of them down for\neight hours of work, there we go,\n\n171\n00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,798\nand I'm going to assign each of them for\njust a day.\n\n172\n00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:45,540\nOr is it calculating it?\n\n173\n00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,500\n>> I think it's trying to calculate.\n\n174\n00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,780\n>> All right, we'll give it a break.\n\n175\n00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,370\nThis is one of the difficulties we have.\n\n176\n00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,100\nProject management software a lot of times\nwill do the calculations for you, and so\n\n177\n00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,950\nit's trying to sort some things out for\nme, and did it do it?\n\n178\n00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,060\nYeah, it did it, good.\n\n179\n00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,030\nAll right, so notice, now that I've\ngot the three people attached,\n\n180\n00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,270\nsee how the duration went down to one day?\n\n181\n00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,700\nIt went down to one day, and\n\n182\n00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,120\nI can see that I've got three people\nthat are working eight hours each.\n\n183\n00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,540\nAnd so now it's taking just three\ndays to get this thing done.\n\n184\n00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,450\nOkay, but maybe I get a call from\nthe head office, or whatever, and\n\n185\n00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,780\nthey're like hey, you got three\nemployees working on this activity.\n\n186\n00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,560\nWe gotta get your budget down, all right.\n\n187\n00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,390\nWe can't give you three people like that.\n\n188\n00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,650\nYou're gonna think of going down to two,\nor we need one for another project,\n\n189\n00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,840\nor maybe we need one to go to some other\nactivity that's going on at the same time.\n\n190\n00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,420\nSo, I can take that person away and\nthen level\n\n191\n00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,340\nout the resource allocation to accommodate\nthe employees that I've already got.\n\n192\n00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,770\nAnd most software will do this\nautomatically if you just go in and\n\n193\n00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,010\nremove one of the people.\n\n194\n00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:54,440\nSo if we go in and take Developer 3 and\nremove them, now that they're gone,\n\n195\n00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,210\nwhen I go back, now, now it's got me\nat one and a half days for some reason.\n\n196\n00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,500\nBut if I pull up my resources,\nI can see they're each working 12 hours.\n\n197\n00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,580\nSo it's a 24 hour project again but\nbeing done in 12 hours.\n\n198\n00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,800\nOh, that's why it's one and a half days.\n\n199\n00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,190\nSo each of them are working eight\nhours for that first day, and\n\n200\n00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,290\nthe second day,\neach of them are working four hours.\n\n201\n00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,090\nAnd so that's where we get\nthat kind of distribution.\n\n202\n00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,740\nSo by doing that,\nthis software is leveling for me.\n\n203\n00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,900\nBut sometimes,\nwe need non-standard leveling.\n\n204\n00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,750\nPeople get this in their head that\nleveling always means a nice flat line,\n\n205\n00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,380\nbut in project management, it doesn't.\n\n206\n00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,090\nThere's several different styles\nof leveling that we can do, and\n\n207\n00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,395\nif I pull that task back up.\n\n208\n00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:40,527\nSee how I've got Developer\n1 working 12 hours, and\n\n209\n00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,715\nthey have a work contour that is flat.\n\n210\n00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:47,855\nIf I drop that down, you'll see several\ndifferent contours that are available, and\n\n211\n00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:50,115\nthis'll vary from software to software.\n\n212\n00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:51,581\nI know Microsoft Project has a weird one.\n\n213\n00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:54,337\nThey have turtle and different weird ones.\n\n214\n00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:57,452\nBut you'll see back-loaded.\n\n215\n00:11:57,452 --> 00:12:01,537\nBack-loaded means they'll have very little\nwork the first part of the project, or\n\n216\n00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:05,080\npart of the activity, and\nthey'll have a lot of work at the end.\n\n217\n00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,180\nSo you'll see, instead of going eight\nhours day one and four hours day two.\n\n218\n00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,560\nIf I chose back-loaded, it would flip\nit around, four hours on day one,\n\n219\n00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,860\neight hours on day two, back-loading it.\n\n220\n00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,880\nFront-loaded is the default or whatever.\n\n221\n00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,040\nWe do all the work we as we can up front.\n\n222\n00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,580\nDouble peak, a lot of work in the\nbeginning, a little work in the middle,\n\n223\n00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,840\na lot of work at the end, right?\n\n224\n00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,640\nSo it creates a, what's that called?\n\n225\n00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,150\nA parabola?\n\n226\n00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,620\nA parabolic curve, or something like that?\n\n227\n00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,880\n>> Yep.\n>> Early peak,\n\n228\n00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,520\nmeans that you get a lot of work\nright at the very, very beginning and\n\n229\n00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,790\nthen it tapers off.\n\n230\n00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,000\nLate peak, you get a lot of work\nright there at the very end.\n\n231\n00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,560\nA bell,\nall the work is done in the middle,\n\n232\n00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,060\nit's valleys at the beginning and end.\n\n233\n00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,410\nAnd a plateau, we spike up,\nstay at that level, and drop down again.\n\n234\n00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,960\nEach of these are gonna change\nthe way this stuff is loaded.\n\n235\n00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,531\nAnd if I flip both of\nthese guys to back-loaded,\n\n236\n00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:58,551\nsee how we've got work 7.2 hours.\n\n237\n00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:01,000\nOh now, I've broken it haven't I?\n\n238\n00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,220\nThis is where the math starts\nto get a little acting up.\n\n239\n00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,910\nBut we can throw that in there and\nit'll start allocating it.\n\n240\n00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,860\nIt's not gonna look any different\nhere on this screen, but\n\n241\n00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,460\nif I go into my resource calendars.\n\n242\n00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,190\nIf I go into my resource usage screen and\n\n243\n00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,030\nI start looking at developer one,\ndeveloper two and\n\n244\n00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:26,350\ndeveloper three down here, I can start to\nfind their hours and how they're laid out.\n\n245\n00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,600\nAnd see how I've got 3.3 hours on Monday,\n3.9 hours on Tuesday.\n\n246\n00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,110\nIt's doing more work at the back end\nbecause I chose that particular layout.\n\n247\n00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,110\nI chose back-loaded for their work.\n\n248\n00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,840\nAnd if I switch it back to just flat,\nwe can go back to flat and\n\n249\n00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,780\nnow they're back to normal and\neventually it'll recalculate.\n\n250\n00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,310\nThere we go.\n\n251\n00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,900\nEight hours and four hours right there.\n\n252\n00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,480\nSo those are some of the ways that we can\nadjust when this work is going to be done.\n\n253\n00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,430\nFor the exam, we need to be aware\nof what resource leveling is.\n\n254\n00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,910\nSpreading their hours out over time\nto fit the needs of what we've got to\n\n255\n00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,490\nmake sure that we don't go into\novertime and stuff like that.\n\n256\n00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,000\nWe don't want people exceeding eight hours\ncuz our cost would go up if we do that.\n\n257\n00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,520\nAnd the other option is some\nproject management software,\n\n258\n00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,050\nnot all, but some, will have\nthe ability to do resource leveling,\n\n259\n00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,940\nand you'll see, oh,\nis this one not gonna show it?\n\n260\n00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,690\nHere we go, where we've got\na leveling delay, which is,\n\n261\n00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,710\nwe can have it where it\ngoes a flat model for\n\n262\n00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,420\na little while, and then applies the\nleveling after a certain period of time.\n\n263\n00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,340\nSo you can set that leveling delay to\noffset when that leveling kicks in.\n\n264\n00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,590\nI don't normally use that\nduring the planning phase.\n\n265\n00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,580\nYou shouldn't need it.\n\n266\n00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,307\nBut, down the road, while you're in the\nexecution phase, things are moving along,\n\n267\n00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:51,222\nyou might already be partly\nthrough an activity, and\n\n268\n00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,966\nnow you're trying to level\nto sort out a problem.\n\n269\n00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:56,166\nAnd that's where you'd need to\nintroduce a leveling delay,\n\n270\n00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,390\ncuz you don't want to level something\nthat's already happened, it's too late.\n\n271\n00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,900\nYou only want to level things in\nthe future, so see you've got that.\n\n272\n00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,340\nMicrosoft Project actually has an auto\nleveling feature that I absolutely\n\n273\n00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,820\nhate because it does all\nsorts of erratic things.\n\n274\n00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,970\nSo I almost always prefer to\ndo this by hand and you can.\n\n275\n00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,550\nYou don't have to use these\nlittle work contours and stuff.\n\n276\n00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,830\nYou can just go in by hand and\nsay all right,\n\n277\n00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,740\nI've got developer one working task seven,\neight hours and eight hours.\n\n278\n00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,330\nYou know what?\nI'm gonna change it to six hours and\n\n279\n00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,220\nsix hours like this.\n\n280\n00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,340\nAnd that way, just in case each employee\nhas two extra hours, kind of built into\n\n281\n00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,100\nmy schedule that they're not allocated,\nso I'm just gonna manually punch that in.\n\n282\n00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,710\nI'm still getting my 24\nhours of work done, right?\n\n283\n00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,180\nSo that's good, but at the end of the day,\n\n284\n00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,797\nI've got a little bit\nof extra time built in.\n\n285\n00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:51,850\nAnd I would normally represent that by\nadding an entry here called reserve.\n\n286\n00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,648\nAnd, or actually, you know what?\n\n287\n00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:57,344\nI just added resource.\nI would add a task on called reserve,\n\n288\n00:15:57,344 --> 00:16:02,212\nattach developer 1 and 2 to that reserve\nand assign them two hours a day for\n\n289\n00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:07,560\nthat and that way I've clearly noted,\nhere's the reserve that I've got.\n\n290\n00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,150\nAnd that'll prevent me from\nover allocating them later on.\n\n291\n00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,620\nI forgot here, I'm actually\nadding a resource called reserve,\n\n292\n00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,500\nwhich is not what I wanted.\n\n293\n00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,020\nBut yeah, those are some examples\nof things that we can do there\n\n294\n00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,520\nto try and get this stuff moving along,\nget things put in.\n\n295\n00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,050\nDoing it by hand,\nIf anything goes wrong, it's your fault.\n\n296\n00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,600\nBut at least you know what happened,\n\n297\n00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,560\nand you're not trusting\nmathematical operations.\n\n298\n00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,070\nSo that's an example of how\nwe can use resource leveling.\n\n299\n00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,030\nNow Resource Leveling was just one\nof the things we had available,\n\n300\n00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,310\nif I can get back to my notes.\n\n301\n00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,950\nThe other one was Resource Smoothing.\n\n302\n00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,040\nResource smoothing is extremely similar.\n\n303\n00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,160\nBecause what you're doing is\nyou're taking those resources and\n\n304\n00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,080\nspreading those activities over days to\naccommodate their work schedule, right?\n\n305\n00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,630\nSo how is that any different\nthan resource leveling?\n\n306\n00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,270\nWell the difference here is with resource\nsmoothing, it only applies delay\n\n307\n00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,090\nwithin the free and total float, okay.\n\n308\n00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,880\nRemember critical path method.\n\n309\n00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,600\nAnd I don't have my little chart, shoot.\n\n310\n00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,960\nLet me open up the diagram\nfrom the other day.\n\n311\n00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,920\nThat was schedule part two, here we go.\n\n312\n00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,040\nHere's that chart that we worked on,\non the show,\n\n313\n00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,350\nwhen we were doing the critical\npath method, right?\n\n314\n00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,590\nAnd let me just zoom out some here.\n\n315\n00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,010\nHere and maybe more, there we go,\nI want to see the whole thing.\n\n316\n00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,730\nAll right so, when we looked at\nthis path here this whole chart.\n\n317\n00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,050\nWe identified a critical path, right?\n\n318\n00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,840\nAnd that critical path,\nwent something like this.\n\n319\n00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,510\nThat is a terrible, terrible line.\n\n320\n00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,670\nCan I do anything about that?\n\n321\n00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,130\nLet's see can I make that\na nice big gigantic line.\n\n322\n00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,490\nThere we go, all right.\n\n323\n00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,410\nSo there is our critical path, right?\n\n324\n00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,680\nEvery activity on that critical\npath is well critical, right.\n\n325\n00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,680\nSo if any of these activities take longer,\n\n326\n00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,310\nif I level the resource out inside\nof one of these activities.\n\n327\n00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,530\nMy whole project's gonna take longer,\nright?\n\n328\n00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,210\nSo if my whole goal is to finish on\nday 12, I gotta finish on day 12.\n\n329\n00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,420\nI can't do resource leveling across here.\n\n330\n00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,020\nI need those resources working\nevery moment that they've got\n\n331\n00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,040\nin order to reach my goal.\n\n332\n00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,750\nAll right?\n\n333\n00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,660\nBut down here, Activity D and E,\n\n334\n00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,810\nI don't need those guys busting their buts\nten hours a day to get that stuff done.\n\n335\n00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,440\nI can level these and\n\n336\n00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,840\nmaybe there's one where I've got\nthree people assigned to it.\n\n337\n00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,860\nI can go down to two people.\n\n338\n00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,330\nHave it take a little bit longer and\nreduce my cost.\n\n339\n00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,770\nThat is a very real thing.\n\n340\n00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,180\nWhen we do that, we just level\non activities that have float,\n\n341\n00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,800\nthat is called Resource smoothing.\n\n342\n00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,900\nIt's the same thing as Resource leveling,\n\n343\n00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,910\nexcept it doesn't effect\nthe over length of our project.\n\n344\n00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,510\nResource leveling almost always\neffects the length of our project,\n\n345\n00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,420\nby either shortening it or lengthening it.\n\n346\n00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,100\nTypically, lengthening it.\n\n347\n00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,770\nBut it's a direct effect on time.\n\n348\n00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:16,630\nAll right, so those are resource\nleveling and Resource smoothing.\n\n349\n00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,120\nJust remember that,\nthe thing I memorized for the the exam is.\n\n350\n00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,440\nResource smoothing,\nyou just do it with inside the float.\n\n351\n00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,900\nResource leveling, you do it everywhere.\n\n352\n00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,190\nAll right, so that is basically that.\n\n353\n00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,900\nLet me get back to my, yeah, we don't need\nto save that, back to our part three,\n\n354\n00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,690\nwherever that is.\n\n355\n00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,680\nAll right, so those are two of the\ntechniques that we've got available for\n\n356\n00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,570\nus, Resource leveling and\nResource smoothing.\n\n357\n00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,930\nWhen you've got that kind of in place, you\ngo through all your different activities,\n\n358\n00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,720\nyou look for\nany areas where you can do that.\n\n359\n00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,380\nIf you're still in planning and you don't\nhave a hard deadline, then you look for\n\n360\n00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,540\nanywhere where you might have overtime\nscheduled, where you have more work than\n\n361\n00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,820\none person can handle, and\nthat's somewhere where you level.\n\n362\n00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,660\nYou spread that out.\n\n363\n00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,130\nThat cuts out the overtime or adds time to\ntheir schedule to allow them to work on\n\n364\n00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,400\nother projects or\nwhatever it is that you need.\n\n365\n00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,280\nYou'll have to do this\nactivity by activity.\n\n366\n00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,340\nI can go through and look at each one.\n\n367\n00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,300\nIf your project managing software has auto\nlevel and you can use it, I personally\n\n368\n00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,990\nwouldn't but you can but instead usually\nwhen you go activity by activity,\n\n369\n00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,230\nyou're looking at each resource and saying\nhow many hours a day do I actually have\n\n370\n00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,120\nthis person and so on and make this real,\nlay all that out properly.\n\n371\n00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,060\nIt's very important.\n\n372\n00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,750\n>> Yeah, with some of the project\nmanagement software, when you say, hey,\n\n373\n00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,385\nI think I'm gonna do this auto leveling.\n\n374\n00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:34,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It auto levels across every single\n\n375\n00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,520\ntask, and you never know what you're\nactually gonna end up with, and\n\n376\n00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,905\nit's gonna be things you may want,\nthings you're not, not gonna want it all.\n\n377\n00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:44,975\nAnd sometimes, having to readjust\nthat's gonna take more time\n\n378\n00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:48,345\nthan you actually going down\nindividual tasks one by one and\n\n379\n00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:51,005\nputting the resource time and\nthe leveling where you want it.\n\n380\n00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:54,850\nSo yeah, do be careful when somebody says,\nyeah just do the auto leveling here.\n\n381\n00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,190\nIt's not something you always want to do.\n\n382\n00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,830\n>> And then always keep in mind,\nthat when you change one activity.\n\n383\n00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,280\nYou've got relationships.\n\n384\n00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,080\nWhen one activity changes,\nit will often times have a ripple effect.\n\n385\n00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,175\nChanging other activities\nthrough the project.\n\n386\n00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:10,495\nSo you've always gotta look at it.\n\n387\n00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:13,075\nNow, we don't wanna necessarily\nteach the project manager software.\n\n388\n00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:16,575\nBut a lot of software out there\nhas a simple undo feature.\n\n389\n00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,395\nSo, you can do it.\n\n390\n00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:18,215\nOh, this is a good segway.\n\n391\n00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:20,505\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can do a what if analysis, right?\n\n392\n00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:24,525\nSo I didn't intend to segway into that,\nbut I kind of have.\n\n393\n00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:29,350\nThe very next tool, if I go to my notes\nhere, is a what if scenario analysis.\n\n394\n00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,930\nYou know,\n\n395\n00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,850\na what if scenario it's just where you\nsay what if I were to make this change?\n\n396\n00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,230\nWhat if this were to happen?\n\n397\n00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,030\nWhat if one thing took longer\nthan it was supposed to?\n\n398\n00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,090\nSo select software,\n\n399\n00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,550\nwhat if it took me longer what if\nwe just couldn't make up our mind.\n\n400\n00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,900\nAnd it took us five days\nto select that software.\n\n401\n00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,630\nWhat does that do to my project?\n\n402\n00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,550\nWhen you can make that change and\nthen you can see what happens.\n\n403\n00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,810\nNow, I've got my critical path up here and\nyou'll see that when I\n\n404\n00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,345\ndid select software,\nIt didn't change the critical path.\n\n405\n00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:01,775\nSo the overall length of\nmy project hasn't changed.\n\n406\n00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:03,985\nSo that's fine, I don't have to\nworry about anything else, right?\n\n407\n00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:08,195\nNot exactly,\nselect software's back two more days now.\n\n408\n00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:12,475\nSo that means the start date for\nwhatever file it is, so like Bid RFQ,\n\n409\n00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:18,085\nPurchase Software,\nthose all just shifted back two days also.\n\n410\n00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:19,845\nSo now I can go and look and\ntry to sort that out.\n\n411\n00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:24,230\nNow, ProjectLibre it's free and\nit's got a limited feature set.\n\n412\n00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,640\nSo I have to visually go and note changes.\n\n413\n00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,750\nOne of the features that's introduced\nin Microsoft Project 2010 that I love,\n\n414\n00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,670\nis that when you make a change,\n\n415\n00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,340\nany other activity that was modified\nby that will be highlighted blue.\n\n416\n00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,596\nSo you'll get a chance to see that,\n\n417\n00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:41,150\nyou know maybe i'll install that during\nthe break just so I can show it on air.\n\n418\n00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,910\nBut you can see the ripple\neffect that causes\n\n419\n00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,530\neverything that changes to be highlighted.\n\n420\n00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,260\nAnd you may look at that and go,\noh holy moley, I do not want that.\n\n421\n00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,740\nAnd so that's when you go hit\nyour undo and put it back.\n\n422\n00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,970\nAnd there you go.\n\n423\n00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,740\nAnd you can sit here, and this is\nwhat I used to do, in Project 2007,\n\n424\n00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,670\nyou didn't have that\nripple effect feature.\n\n425\n00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,885\nAnd, so I would make a change, and\nthen I would just sit here with Ctrl+Y and\n\n426\n00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:09,730\nCtrl+Z, put the change in, take the change\nback, and I would just sit here and look.\n\n427\n00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,360\nTo find out what's happening,\nbecause notice watch purchase software.\n\n428\n00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,280\nThis guy right here.\n\n429\n00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,250\nPurchase software is just a two\nday activity, it's right here, and\n\n430\n00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,700\nwhen I put that delay in, what happens?\n\n431\n00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,730\nIt spans a weekend now.\n\n432\n00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,740\nSo one day of work is done on a Friday,\none day of work is done on a Monday.\n\n433\n00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,050\nThat might be a problem for me.\n\n434\n00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,460\nRight, because if purchasing the software,\n\n435\n00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,840\nif I actually have to go somewhere to\npurchase whatever this material is, right?\n\n436\n00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,330\nI would go there on Thursday,\nbuy the stuff, come back on Friday.\n\n437\n00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,580\nSo it's a two day purchase activity.\n\n438\n00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,924\nNow it's a four day project.\n\n439\n00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,884\nI would go out there on Friday,\nbuy the stuff.\n\n440\n00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:50,135\nStay in a hotel Saturday and Sunday and\nthen come back on Monday, oh,\n\n441\n00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:51,434\nthat's not so realistic.\n\n442\n00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:52,008\nListed.\n\n443\n00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:52,658\nMaybe I just drive back.\n\n444\n00:23:52,658 --> 00:23:55,616\nBut you guys get the idea that\nonce you stretch over weekend,\n\n445\n00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:58,140\nthat may not be something that's possible.\n\n446\n00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,940\nSo it's important to do\nthese what if analysis, and\n\n447\n00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,760\nif you're doing it in computer software in\na project management information system,\n\n448\n00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,200\nPMIS, it becomes pretty easy to do.\n\n449\n00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,330\nYou just punch it in.\n\n450\n00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,970\nUse your undo, right.\n\n451\n00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,070\nMake sure you save your project before\nyou start doing this just in case\n\n452\n00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,920\nyou make some changes and\nyou can't undo them for some reason,\n\n453\n00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,100\nyou can just go back to\nyour saved document.\n\n454\n00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,470\nBut it's a quick and\neasy way to kind of analyze that.\n\n455\n00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,900\nYeah, what if scenarios\nare really cool and\n\n456\n00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,450\ndefinitely something\nthat you're going to do.\n\n457\n00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,090\nEspecially in planning, but\nI do them in execution, too.\n\n458\n00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,130\nYou know, as I'd look ahead, I always\nlook at the various activities for\n\n459\n00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,610\nthe following month and plan for delays.\n\n460\n00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,820\nWhat if this one falls behind?\n\n461\n00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,220\nWhat if this other one falls behind?\n\n462\n00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,660\nWhat if two of these fall\nbehind at the same time?\n\n463\n00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,260\nWhat am I gonna do?\n\n464\n00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,030\nAnd I try and\nformulate my I plan ahead of time.\n\n465\n00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,930\nI plan for that so that I'm ready,\nI'm not surprised.\n\n466\n00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,170\nOh I fell behind, great.\n\n467\n00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,000\nI'm ready for that.\n\n468\n00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,440\nNot, oh my gosh, I fell behind.\n\n469\n00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,260\nWhat am I gonna do now?\n\n470\n00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,790\nI gotta go find all my options.\n\n471\n00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,720\nAnd you're running on a deadline and\nyou're under pressure.\n\n472\n00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,701\nSo, what if analysis,\n\n473\n00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:01,680\nIt's really as simple as that,\nyou come up with scenarios.\n\n474\n00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,210\nWhat if event X happened?\n\n475\n00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,670\nWhat if event Y happened?\n\n476\n00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,970\nWhat if event X and\nY happened at the same time?\n\n477\n00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,990\nWhat would I do, how would it effect the\nschedule, how would it effect the project?\n\n478\n00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,830\nSo really simple to do.\n\n479\n00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,930\nAlright, well, you know Ronnie ,I\nreally do want to show that kind of\n\n480\n00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,060\nripple effect, and\nI can't do it here in project Libre.\n\n481\n00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,540\nSo, let's do this.\n\n482\n00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,520\nLet's stop and take a break.\n\n483\n00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,990\nAnd during the break,\nI'll fire up the Microsoft Project and\n\n484\n00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,630\ngive you guys an example of\nhow that works, sounds good?\n\n485\n00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,200\n>> Sounds great.\n\n486\n00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,460\n>> All right, ladies and gentlemen,\nstay tuned, when we get back,\n\n487\n00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,284\nmore schedule management after this.\n\n488\n00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:39,391\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n489\n00:25:39,391 --> 00:25:43,629\nSo during the break, through the magic\nof time shifting technology I installed\n\n490\n00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:46,360\nMicrosoft Project 2013 on my machine.\n\n491\n00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,990\nAnd let me just show you guys this so\n\n492\n00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,080\nI can kind of do that\nwhat if scenario thing.\n\n493\n00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,700\nYou know, the what if functionality\nit really does come down to\n\n494\n00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,560\nyour project management software.\n\n495\n00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,030\nRonnie and I are both Microsoft\ncertified trainers and\n\n496\n00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,030\nwe've been teaching Microsoft courses for\nyears and years, and\n\n497\n00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:07,590\nwe both started with project a long time\nago, so my first one was Project 2000.\n\n498\n00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,936\n>> Mine was 2002.\n\n499\n00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:11,213\n>> Okay.\n>> And quickly in 2003.\n\n500\n00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:15,010\n>> So, we've been working with it for\na long time and in the early versions of\n\n501\n00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,740\nProject, you could not trust the undue and\nthe redo and the functionality like that.\n\n502\n00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,040\nSo you had to frequently make\nsaves to your project and\n\n503\n00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,920\nmake a change and go and\nreload your project file.\n\n504\n00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,300\nBut its come a long way since then.\n\n505\n00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,920\nAnd I wanted to show you guys that ripple\neffect of what happens to your project\n\n506\n00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,300\nwhen you make a change.\n\n507\n00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,460\nSo for example ,lets say that I've\ngot my entire project lined up,\n\n508\n00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,390\nhere it is, I'm about ready to go into\nexecution, so we're pretty much done\n\n509\n00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,570\nwith planning and I get a call from\na contractor and they say, you know what?\n\n510\n00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,410\nWe quoted you right here on\na three day activity, but,\n\n511\n00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,610\nafter looking at the information a little\nmore we can get it done in two days.\n\n512\n00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,590\nWe can get it done that much faster.\n\n513\n00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,050\nAnd you say, wow that's great.\n\n514\n00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,730\nCuz I've got you scheduled here.\n\n515\n00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,910\nI've got you as a three day activity.\n\n516\n00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,070\nIf I can cut you down to two,\nmaybe I can get ahead of schedule.\n\n517\n00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,680\nWhen we start to look at that though,\n\n518\n00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,750\nthere's some little\nissues that can creep up.\n\n519\n00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,980\nIf I bump that down to a two day activity,\nall right?\n\n520\n00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,940\nSee how all these just lit up in blue,\n\n521\n00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,480\nthat's my ripple effect\nI can see what changed.\n\n522\n00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,460\nThe overall duration of phase two changed,\n\n523\n00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,200\nall the dates on every activity\nafterwards have changed.\n\n524\n00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,490\nAnd now I'm seeing that my project\nis finishing one day early.\n\n525\n00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:38,250\nWell, that's cool except, now all\nof these start dates are different.\n\n526\n00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,430\nSo I now need to look at\neach of these activities.\n\n527\n00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,540\nThese are activities I now need to act on.\n\n528\n00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,570\nI need to call those people and\nsay hey, would it be possible for\n\n529\n00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,150\nyou to start one day early?\n\n530\n00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,500\nCheck your schedules.\n\n531\n00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,870\nWhatever resources I have assigned.\n\n532\n00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,530\nIf they can't, maybe I need to\nline up different resources.\n\n533\n00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,930\nNow, I need to start making changes for\nthe entire remainder of my project.\n\n534\n00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:00,910\nSo this is nice because we can identify\nwhat it is that got affected, and go and\n\n535\n00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,810\nact upon them.\n\n536\n00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,640\nThese activities that are still in white,\nthese guys didn't change.\n\n537\n00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,340\nI don't need to call them,\nthey're unaffected by this.\n\n538\n00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,880\nSo that's an example of\nusing that information,\n\n539\n00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,180\nkind of getting an idea and\nsetting it in place.\n\n540\n00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,830\nAnd then I can always\njust do a quick undo, and\n\n541\n00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,520\nit puts it back to the way it was.\n\n542\n00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,780\nAnd I can do redos and so on.\n\n543\n00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,810\nWoops, I can try and do redos.\n\n544\n00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,470\nAnd just go back and forth to kinda see\nthat change and what it is we want to do.\n\n545\n00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,770\nAll right?\n\n546\n00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,930\nSome project management software even goes\nmore advanced, and has the ability for\n\n547\n00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,520\nyou to create multiple versions of a task.\n\n548\n00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,200\nSo I have Task 2 right here.\n\n549\n00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,650\nAnd maybe I go in and I take Task 2.\n\n550\n00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,931\nAnd maybe I'll call this Task 2\n\n551\n00:28:47,931 --> 00:28:52,809\noptimistic.\n\n552\n00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:56,810\nAnd then I'm going to make\na Task 2 pessimistic.\n\n553\n00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:05,622\nLet's say insert That's not what I wanted.\n\n554\n00:29:07,584 --> 00:29:11,050\nThere, so\nI'm gonna make a Task 2 pessimistic.\n\n555\n00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,630\nRight?\n\n556\n00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,510\nSo on the optimistic side.\n\n557\n00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,000\nIs it two esses?\n\n558\n00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,620\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, my spelling abilities.\n\n559\n00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,780\nSo the duration is three\ndays in the optimistic one.\n\n560\n00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,280\nI'm gonna set it to six days\nin the pessimistic one.\n\n561\n00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,360\nAll right, so there's my two,\nand let me just go over here and\n\n562\n00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,980\nupdate my predecessors to\nmake sure this is all even.\n\n563\n00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:38,060\nAll right, so these guys are both preceded\nby task 2, that one's [INAUDIBLE], good.\n\n564\n00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,020\nAll right.\n\n565\n00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,180\nSo now, I've got two different\nversions of the same task, and\n\n566\n00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,580\nif I look over here on my Gantt chart,\nI can see activity 1 finishes or task 1.\n\n567\n00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,280\nAnd then it's gonna go into one\nof these two visions of task 2.\n\n568\n00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,260\nAnd then when task 2 is done,\n\n569\n00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,940\nthen it's gonna go to its milestone\ninto task 3 and all that stuff, right?\n\n570\n00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,760\nAnd in Microsoft Project, it is\nthe ability to disable and enable tasks.\n\n571\n00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,750\nAnd so you'll see that option buried\naway in here in the millions of entries.\n\n572\n00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,810\nYou have this inactivate button.\n\n573\n00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,990\nAnd so I can take task 2 optimistic and\ninactivate it.\n\n574\n00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,630\nNow I can see what my project looks\nlike in the pessimistic view.\n\n575\n00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:23,730\nAnd then I can reactivate it, and\nI can inactivate the pessimistic one,\n\n576\n00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,510\nand now I see what my project\nlooks like in the optimistic view.\n\n577\n00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,950\nAnd so you can build those one if\nscenarios in, and leave them there, so\n\n578\n00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,060\nthroughout the life of your project you\ncan come back and turn this on and off,\n\n579\n00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,250\nand just kind of see how things go\nthis ability to turn activities on and\n\n580\n00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,560\noff is really nice, but\nit is a function of the software.\n\n581\n00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,670\nSo I'm not showing it here for\nyou guys to know, oh,\n\n582\n00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,450\nhere's how I use Microsoft Project,\ncuz you might not use it at all, and\n\n583\n00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,685\non the exam, there is no\nspecific software package used.\n\n584\n00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:56,230\n[LAUGH] I'll tell you, almost all the\nscreenshots are from Microsoft Project,\n\n585\n00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,710\nbut that doesn't mean you're gonna use.\n\n586\n00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,990\nYou don't have to know how to use\nany project management software.\n\n587\n00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,230\nThe important part here is the concept.\n\n588\n00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,750\nA what if scenarios is where we\nbounce some ideas off of our project.\n\n589\n00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,360\nWhat if this happens?\n\n590\n00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,510\nWhat if that's a six day activity\ninstead of a three day activity?\n\n591\n00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,860\nWell, I can find out.\n\n592\n00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,780\nIf I inactivate the three day activity.\n\n593\n00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,690\nIt's not going to be\nhappy about that is it.\n\n594\n00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,920\nAnd then I activate the six day activity,\n\n595\n00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,110\nnow I can see here's what\nit's going to be like.\n\n596\n00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,380\nHere's when these other\nactivities are gonna happen,\n\n597\n00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,340\nwhen they're going to fall on and\nwhen that finish date is.\n\n598\n00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,960\nSo now, I can see that I'm\ngonna finish on October 1st.\n\n599\n00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,944\nBut if things go the right way,\nand we finish this way,\n\n600\n00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:38,758\nwe'll finish on, what is it?\n\n601\n00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:39,948\nSeptember 26th, right?\n\n602\n00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:44,197\nSo now, I can kinda get an idea,\nsee that, and figure out what's what.\n\n603\n00:31:44,197 --> 00:31:47,656\nAll right, so\nthose are what if scenarios and\n\n604\n00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:51,090\nthat was our kind of chance to see those.\n\n605\n00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,738\nReally pretty straight forward, right.\n\n606\n00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:57,880\nYou can get really crazy\nscientific on this stuff.\n\n607\n00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,570\nWhat if scenarios are really\nnot crazy science?\n\n608\n00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,070\nIt's just come up with possibilities,\nsee how they affect your calendar.\n\n609\n00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,100\nThere is something called\na Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n610\n00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,320\nAnd a Monte Carlo simulation\n,is where we try and\n\n611\n00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:17,190\ncreate a more statistically accurate\naverage of what's going to happen.\n\n612\n00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,710\nIf you took statistics in college,\n\n613\n00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,840\nthen you've probably dealt\nwith Monte Carlo simulations.\n\n614\n00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,990\nBut in real life,\nwe don't see them that much,\n\n615\n00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,540\nbecause they're terrible inefficient,\nkind of a pain in the butt to make.\n\n616\n00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,440\nBasically what you do\nis you create a chart.\n\n617\n00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,110\nAnd you chart what you are expecting\nto happen, so what you're estimate is.\n\n618\n00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,276\nAnd so you map out, you know,\n\n619\n00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:40,960\nhow much work is expected to be done\non these particular time lines.\n\n620\n00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,370\nAnd then you just start\nthrowing out possibilities.\n\n621\n00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,240\nWhat could happen?\n\n622\n00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,520\nThis could happen, that could happen,\n\n623\n00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,190\nyou're just throwing\nout dots on that chart.\n\n624\n00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,330\nBasically you just scatter them along.\n\n625\n00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,110\nThe more dots you have, the more\naccurate your numbers are going to be.\n\n626\n00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,880\nBecause at the end of the day, after you\nhave plotted all the possible outcomes,\n\n627\n00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,740\nyou average them together, and\nhopefully they equal your estimate.\n\n628\n00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,060\nBut if they don't ,you adjust your\nestimate to equal the average of these\n\n629\n00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,650\npossibilities.\n\n630\n00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,700\nSo the nice thing about a Monte Carlo is,\n\n631\n00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,250\nthat it makes it easy to\ncombine more than one estimate.\n\n632\n00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,400\nSo if you have 50 different estimates,\n50 different possibilities for\n\n633\n00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,670\nthe outcome of an activity, you can plot\nthem all out and average them together.\n\n634\n00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,845\nVersus something like a what if scenario,\nwhich is really just two possibilities.\n\n635\n00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:25,780\nRight?\nWhat if it happens this way?\n\n636\n00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,570\nOr this way.\n\n637\n00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,730\nIf you start bringing in three or\nfour elements into that,\n\n638\n00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:33,850\nthe what-if scenarios become really\ndifficult to manage, all right.\n\n639\n00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:38,176\nMonte Carlos are not something\nthat I use very frequently, but\n\n640\n00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:43,005\nlet me see if I can find you guys\nan example of a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n641\n00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:46,671\nLet's see if we can't\njust find something here.\n\n642\n00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:48,588\nThat's a nice one.\n\n643\n00:33:48,588 --> 00:33:53,100\n[LAUGH] Well, yes, these aren't.\n\n644\n00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,450\nThey're terribly difficult to interpret.\n\n645\n00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,760\nAll right, this is a good one right here.\n\n646\n00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,860\nSo yeah.\nSo this is from contiuum.io.\n\n647\n00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,320\nI'm not familiar with that website.\n\n648\n00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,940\nBut basically they've plotted several\npaths of a particular value of an asset.\n\n649\n00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,875\nSo, something is happening.\n\n650\n00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:12,045\nAnd it's got a dollar\nvalue attached to time.\n\n651\n00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:15,875\nAnd so over time,\nthe cost of this element is increasing.\n\n652\n00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:19,725\nAnd they've plotted,\nit looks like a good 20,\n\n653\n00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,870\nmaybe 30 different scenarios for it, so\nyou see all these different colors, and\n\n654\n00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:29,950\neach one representing a slightly different\noutcome based on some analysis, right?\n\n655\n00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:34,400\nSo you chart 'em out like this, and then\nyou average them together, and you'll see\n\n656\n00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,810\nthat, just visually you can just see,\nwhere that average is going to be.\n\n657\n00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,130\nAnd you act upon that average.\n\n658\n00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,440\nSo that's what a Monte Carlo\nsimulation is.\n\n659\n00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,170\nThey're very time consuming.\n\n660\n00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,230\nThey require a lot of data.\n\n661\n00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,500\nBut when you need the best estimate\npossible for planning out a schedule, or\n\n662\n00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,140\ncost, or budget, or whatever,\nMonte Carlo scenarios are good for that.\n\n663\n00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,950\nSo you'll see these in\nbig dollar projects.\n\n664\n00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,460\nProjects that are built around,\nespecially built around sciences.\n\n665\n00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,010\nLike the space community,\nwhen they are sending a rocket into space,\n\n666\n00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,450\nwhatever, they'll do these because\nthey're very, very effective.\n\n667\n00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,710\nBut if you're building a house,\n\n668\n00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,810\nthere's really not that many\nscenarios that you have to deal with.\n\n669\n00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,870\nPeople show up for work, or\nthey don't show up for work.\n\n670\n00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,330\nThey put up a wall, or\nthey don't put a wall.\n\n671\n00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,503\nRight, so it's not like you've got\nradiation levels, and launch windows, and\n\n672\n00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:21,210\nall that stuff, that can affect\nwhen that rocket's going up.\n\n673\n00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,980\nSo if you're not dealing\nwith a huge variable set,\n\n674\n00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,410\nMonte Carlo's scenario's gonna\noften be a waste of time.\n\n675\n00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,650\nBut if you have a large variable set,\nthese are kinda the only option right?\n\n676\n00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,020\nThis allows us to chart all that out, and\nfind out what that average is going to be.\n\n677\n00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,460\nAnd not just do it at one point, but do\nit throughout the life of that activity.\n\n678\n00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,350\nHere doing time and cost,\nwhich is probably the most common.\n\n679\n00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,365\nI'm not familiar with that website,\nlet's see what they do.\n\n680\n00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:52,637\nWhat does continuim.io do?\n\n681\n00:35:52,637 --> 00:35:55,150\nI like to give credit\nto where credit's due.\n\n682\n00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,230\nOh, they're an analytics company.\n\n683\n00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,590\nThat makes sense.\n\n684\n00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,060\nThese guys make their money\ndoing this kind of thing.\n\n685\n00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,240\nLook's like they do web services.\n\n686\n00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,420\nAnaconda is a web platform.\n\n687\n00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,605\nAnd so they probably take a look\nat software packages, and\n\n688\n00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:13,160\nlook at the response time, and maintenance\ncosts, and support values over time.\n\n689\n00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,520\nSo they specialize in it.\n\n690\n00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,700\nIt makes perfect sense,\nthat they would deal with that.\n\n691\n00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,010\nBecause there's so many different\nscenarios that affect web servers.\n\n692\n00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:22,475\nAll right, cool.\n\n693\n00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:23,775\nI'm glad they served that picture up.\n\n694\n00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,125\nAll right, so\nthat's a Monte Carlo analysis.\n\n695\n00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:30,365\nIt's basically just a very\nadvanced what-if scenario.\n\n696\n00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:33,309\nTons of different models,\nall being averaged together.\n\n697\n00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,380\nAll right, we had a few last\nconcepts to throw in here.\n\n698\n00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,330\nLeads and lags we already talked about.\n\n699\n00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:45,233\nAs far as, you know, we may need to\nattach a delay, or a lead, or whatever,\n\n700\n00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:46,570\nto an activity.\n\n701\n00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,570\nThe example I gave was it last episode,\nor the episode before,\n\n702\n00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,880\nthey all kind of blend together.\n\n703\n00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,930\nWas, if I've got an activity that says,\nreceive 400 computers, and\n\n704\n00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,630\nthen unbox 400 computers, and\nthen set up 400 computers.\n\n705\n00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,940\nThen, I don't have to wait for\nall 400 computers to be unboxed,\n\n706\n00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,660\nbefore I can set up the first one.\n\n707\n00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,360\nIn fact, if they just unboxed 100 of them,\nwe can get started setting up those\n\n708\n00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,000\nhundred, while they're\nunboxing the other ones.\n\n709\n00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,780\nThe key thing to remember, is that\nlead time is when we can start early,\n\n710\n00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,900\nlag time is when we have to start late,\nright.\n\n711\n00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,500\nThere's a delay for some reason.\n\n712\n00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,830\nBut most project management software\nrepresents them the same way.\n\n713\n00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,810\nAnd I did it in, I think I did it\nin Gantt Project the other day,\n\n714\n00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,940\nwhich just had one value,\nwhich I believe was called delay.\n\n715\n00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,080\nDifferent project management\nsoftware is well, different.\n\n716\n00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,964\nSo if I jump over to Microsoft project,\nthat was different, there we go.\n\n717\n00:37:41,964 --> 00:37:44,588\nMy little transition\nwas kind of slow there.\n\n718\n00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:48,873\nThat we can come in here, and\ntake a look and say like,\n\n719\n00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:55,088\nreceive 400 computers, which I will\nset to be like a four-day activity.\n\n720\n00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:55,713\nActually you know what?\n\n721\n00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:56,275\nWe'll say one day.\n\n722\n00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:58,845\nMaybe they just all show\nup on the same day.\n\n723\n00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:02,480\nAnd then unbox 400 computers.\n\n724\n00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,620\nAnd we'll say that's a four day activity.\n\n725\n00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,410\nSo we're basically unboxing\na hundred computers a day, and\n\n726\n00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,360\nthen we'll set up 400 computers, and\nwe'll say that that's a ten day activity.\n\n727\n00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,830\nI'm just gonna link these guys together.\n\n728\n00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,850\nThere we go.\n\n729\n00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:24,310\nSo there's my layout as\nit stands right now.\n\n730\n00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,020\nThese are finish to start relationships.\n\n731\n00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,760\nOne finishes, the next starts.\n\n732\n00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,870\nBut if I'm saying hey, 400 computers.\n\n733\n00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,800\nAfter the get the first hundred unboxed,\nso\n\n734\n00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,500\nafter the first day, the other\nguys can go ahead and get started.\n\n735\n00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,620\nThey don't have to wait.\n\n736\n00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:42,350\nSo I can go in, and I can take this\nactivity, and I can set a lead time on it.\n\n737\n00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:46,590\nWhen I pull up that activity,\nno its bar, but the activity itself.\n\n738\n00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,650\nThere we go.\n\n739\n00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,110\nWhen we go to set it up, you'll see in\nhere when we go to like predecessors,\n\n740\n00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,570\nhere it depends on unbox 400 computers.\n\n741\n00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,770\nIt's finish to start.\n\n742\n00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,820\nAnd it's got zero days of lag.\n\n743\n00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,970\nSo Gantt Project called it delay,\nMicrosoft calls it lag.\n\n744\n00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,060\nOn the exam, it's lag and lead.\n\n745\n00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,770\nBut in Microsoft,\na lead time is simply a negative lag, so\n\n746\n00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,070\nif I set it to a negative three days, that\nmeans I can get started three days early.\n\n747\n00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,070\nAnd when I say, okay, you'll see\nwe get one solid day of unboxing.\n\n748\n00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,240\nAnd then the next activity starts.\n\n749\n00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,780\nSo that's lead time.\n\n750\n00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,610\nWe can get started early, and\nthat shortens the length of our project.\n\n751\n00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:31,080\nThe opposite of that, you know,\nwe've got building a house.\n\n752\n00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,990\nPour foundation, and then frame the walls.\n\n753\n00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,670\nRight?\n\n754\n00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,237\nSo we pour the foundation to the house.\n\n755\n00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:40,338\nOnce that's done,\nthen we stick the walls up.\n\n756\n00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:43,073\nWell, the walls can't go up\nuntil the foundation is done, so\n\n757\n00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:44,294\nthat's a finish to start.\n\n758\n00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:48,554\nAnd I'll say that you know, it's just\ngoing to take one day to pour that\n\n759\n00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:53,108\nfoundation but it's gonna take five\ndays to frame up the walls, all right.\n\n760\n00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:56,495\nBut they pour the foundation and\nthen it's gotta dry.\n\n761\n00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:59,820\nWe've gotta leave three\ndays of lag time for\n\n762\n00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,730\nit to dry before people get in there and\nput up the wall.\n\n763\n00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,240\nSo I just go right back\ninto frame up the walls.\n\n764\n00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,116\nAnd this time for that lag,\nit's going to be a positive value,\n\n765\n00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,900\nthree days of lag time.\n\n766\n00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,060\nAnd here, the opposite of this one\nwhere I got started three days early,\n\n767\n00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,380\nnow I'm waiting three days, and\nthis one included the weekend.\n\n768\n00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,950\nI need to pay attention to that, right?\n\n769\n00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,970\nBecause if the weekend counts for\nthe dry time,\n\n770\n00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,180\ndo I actually need three days of lag?\n\n771\n00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,430\nNo, I can get started on Monday cuz\ntechnically this is five days of lag.\n\n772\n00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,740\nSo we do have to pay attention to that as\nwe plan out why we've got that lag time.\n\n773\n00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,950\nIt might be something like we place\nan order and we're waiting to receive it.\n\n774\n00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,870\nOur estimated ship time is\nsix to ten business days, so\n\n775\n00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,210\nI might put a lag time of ten days\nto allow for that shipping to occur.\n\n776\n00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,450\nWhatever it is,\nit's just the opposite of a lead time.\n\n777\n00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,100\nSo those are pretty straightforward,\nlag and lead time.\n\n778\n00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,350\nAll right, now,\nhow can we use that to our advantage?\n\n779\n00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:00,860\nWell, lead time is something\nthat people often overlook.\n\n780\n00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,875\nWhen we come up with our project schedule,\nwhen we're doing the sequencing of\n\n781\n00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:08,165\nactivities, we're not really thinking\nabout getting things started early.\n\n782\n00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,425\nWe're just trying to plan\nout the relationships.\n\n783\n00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:13,250\nSo when we did our project\nschedule network diagram,\n\n784\n00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,895\nwhen we did our sequencing\nof activities process and\n\n785\n00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:20,070\nall of that, we probably\nhaven't optimized our schedule.\n\n786\n00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,920\nAnd that's the last part,\nreally, of planning for\n\n787\n00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,340\nthe schedule side of things,\nis to go through and\n\n788\n00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:30,890\nsee how we can optimize our schedule\nto get it as efficient as possible.\n\n789\n00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,330\nAnd for that we've got a couple\nof other little tools.\n\n790\n00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,650\nBut before I move on to that, have I\nleft anything out on lag and lead time?\n\n791\n00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,460\n>> I don't think so.\n\n792\n00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,110\n>> Okay.\n\n793\n00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:42,490\nJust be aware on the exam,\nit will be called lag time for\n\n794\n00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,570\na delay, lead time for\ngetting started early.\n\n795\n00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:50,045\nEven though your project management\nsoftware probably only uses one term,\n\n796\n00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:52,445\non the exam you'll see two separate terms.\n\n797\n00:41:52,445 --> 00:41:57,305\nSo you really won't see a negative lag\ntime on the exam like you would in your\n\n798\n00:41:57,305 --> 00:41:58,087\nsoftware.\n\n799\n00:41:58,087 --> 00:42:03,101\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about optimizing our schedule.\n\n800\n00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:07,762\nWhen we talk about optimizing the\nschedule, we're trying to get our schedule\n\n801\n00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:12,209\nas short as possible, so that we can\neither finish as early as possible or,\n\n802\n00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:14,256\nif we're working for a deadline,\n\n803\n00:42:14,256 --> 00:42:18,948\nthen we can leave as much space as\npossible to ensure that we're successful.\n\n804\n00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:22,788\nSo we want things to take\nas little time as possible.\n\n805\n00:42:22,788 --> 00:42:26,984\nThe way we do that is through\na technique called schedule compression.\n\n806\n00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:29,344\nAnd schedule compression takes two forms.\n\n807\n00:42:29,344 --> 00:42:31,454\nThere's crashing and fast tracking.\n\n808\n00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:37,964\nCrashing is where we look at our schedule\nand we say, okay, here's my schedule.\n\n809\n00:42:37,964 --> 00:42:41,262\nThis project is going to take six months.\n\n810\n00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:44,102\nBut I get a call from the higher-ups and\nthey say,\n\n811\n00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:48,422\nlook, I know the project's up to six\nmonths, but can we get it done in five?\n\n812\n00:42:48,422 --> 00:42:50,912\nIf we can get it done in five months,\nthere's a trade show.\n\n813\n00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:53,130\nWe want to announce our product.\n\n814\n00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,460\nWe really want to get that ball rolling.\n\n815\n00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,160\nCan you get it done in five?\n\n816\n00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,790\nAnd you look at your calendar and\nyou say, you know what?\n\n817\n00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:59,685\nI'm sorry, guys.\n\n818\n00:42:59,685 --> 00:43:00,601\nI didn't lie.\n\n819\n00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:01,810\nI didn't pad my numbers.\n\n820\n00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,110\nThese are legitimate numbers.\n\n821\n00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,180\nThis project is gonna take six months.\n\n822\n00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,203\nAnd they say, well, what can we do?\n\n823\n00:43:06,203 --> 00:43:09,270\nWhat can we do to get\nit down to five months?\n\n824\n00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,095\nWell, there's one answer, and\nthat's throw money at it.\n\n825\n00:43:13,095 --> 00:43:14,220\nThat's what I always tell them.\n\n826\n00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,650\nThrowing money at the problem.\n\n827\n00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:19,192\nYou can throw money at almost\nany problem and solve it.\n\n828\n00:43:19,192 --> 00:43:23,120\n[LAUGH] I know that's a jaded,\nnegative thing to say, but\n\n829\n00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,160\nin the world of project management-\n>> It's true.\n\n830\n00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,695\n>> It is true,\nyou can fix anything with money so\n\n831\n00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:31,832\n[LAUGH] just look at the US government.\n\n832\n00:43:31,832 --> 00:43:35,320\n[LAUGH] So if we want to get it\ndone in five months, you say, well,\n\n833\n00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,570\nhere's the deal, guys.\n\n834\n00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:42,320\nIf I had twice as many employees or\nif I could approve overtime.\n\n835\n00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,005\nOr I've only got one payloader,\nand if I had two payloaders or\n\n836\n00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:49,925\nseven dump trucks instead of three dump\ntrucks, I can get us done in five months.\n\n837\n00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:51,655\nIt's going to cost you guys money,\nbut we can get it done.\n\n838\n00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:55,845\nAnd if the sponsor or whoever it is,\n\n839\n00:43:55,845 --> 00:43:59,445\nthat approving authority,\nif they look at it and say, you know what?\n\n840\n00:43:59,445 --> 00:44:01,925\nIt's worth it, let's do it.\n\n841\n00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:03,150\nThat's a change to your project.\n\n842\n00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:11,860\nThat is a change to your\nproject constraints.\n\n843\n00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,500\nThey want to get it done early,\nso what do they do?\n\n844\n00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:20,250\nThey come in and they tell you, our new\nschedule time is going to be shorter,\n\n845\n00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,780\nand to compensate for that,\nour budget cost is gonna go up.\n\n846\n00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,630\nWe're okay with that cuz\nwe wanna get done faster.\n\n847\n00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,839\nThat is schedule crashing.\n\n848\n00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,800\nIt's typically the result of\nthe sponsor changing their mind.\n\n849\n00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,670\nThey decide that they want more\nrequirements done in the same amount of\n\n850\n00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,640\ntime, or they decide that they want\nthe same amount of requirements done\n\n851\n00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,340\nin a shorter amount of time.\n\n852\n00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,790\nAnd the only way we can adjust for\nthat is budget and cost.\n\n853\n00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:51,650\nThere are some times they say,\ncan we get it done in five months?\n\n854\n00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,550\nAnd to do that we'll cut\noff some requirements.\n\n855\n00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,300\nRemember these three are linked.\n\n856\n00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,190\nSo to make one better,\nto lower our budget or lower our schedule,\n\n857\n00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,762\nwe're going to have to cut requirements.\n\n858\n00:45:01,762 --> 00:45:04,470\nAnd it kind of works all\nthroughout that linked triangle.\n\n859\n00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,265\nSo when they come in and and they say,\nwe want it to get done faster,\n\n860\n00:45:07,265 --> 00:45:12,860\nthe easiest solution is typically to throw\nmoney at the problem, increase our budget.\n\n861\n00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,160\nWe can get more people, get more\nresources, get things done faster.\n\n862\n00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,940\nSo that's the premise behind schedule\ncrashing and you'll see the official PMI\n\n863\n00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:28,840\ndefinition to approve overtime, to pay\nextra to get people to work more, bring\n\n864\n00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,100\nin additional resources, more employees,\nand paying to expedite delivery.\n\n865\n00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,550\nThese are things that we can\ndo to shorten that schedule.\n\n866\n00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:41,464\n>> On this particular definition, remember\nthat when you start doing the idea of this\n\n867\n00:45:41,464 --> 00:45:46,810\ncrashing for us here, you're always\ngonna do it along the critical path.\n\n868\n00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,920\nBecause doing it along those areas which\nare not on the critical path are really\n\n869\n00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,840\nnot gonna shorten the duration here, so\n\n870\n00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,720\nmake sure you do it along the critical\npath as you crash the plan.\n\n871\n00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,461\n>> Yeah, great point.\n\n872\n00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,710\n[LAUGH] If you crash an activity\nthat's outside of it what do you get?\n\n873\n00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,880\nMore flow time, you know?\n\n874\n00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,800\nSo you really don't achieve anything.\n\n875\n00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,340\nIt would be critical path, and\nthat highlights another danger.\n\n876\n00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,590\nIf you start crashing the critical\npath and shortening the critical path,\n\n877\n00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,820\nwhat can happen?\n\n878\n00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,330\nA new critical path could emerge, right?\n\n879\n00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> That is not an uncommon thing.\n\n880\n00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,265\nSo as you start manipulating things,\nas you start shrinking that project down,\n\n881\n00:46:18,265 --> 00:46:22,380\nyour critical path might change, and\nwe definitely have to be aware of that.\n\n882\n00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,100\nI wonder if I could\nsimulate that real quick.\n\n883\n00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,458\nI could probably whip something up in\nProject pretty quick, but as I said,\n\n884\n00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:32,347\nas you shorten one path,\nanother path may become the new long one.\n\n885\n00:46:32,347 --> 00:46:34,647\nThat's where project software\nmanagement software is really handy,\n\n886\n00:46:34,647 --> 00:46:35,728\ncuz you'll see that right away.\n\n887\n00:46:35,728 --> 00:46:39,483\nBut if you're calculating CPM by hand,\nyou're gonna have to go through and\n\n888\n00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:41,135\ncalculate it with every change.\n\n889\n00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:42,215\nIt's very time consuming.\n\n890\n00:46:43,315 --> 00:46:44,690\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n891\n00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,510\nVery useful technique, though,\nif you've got where somebody's willing to\n\n892\n00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:52,400\ncutback on their requirements or\nthey're willing to increase your budget,\n\n893\n00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,040\nthen you can absolutely\nshorten time in that scenario.\n\n894\n00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,112\nAnother scenario is what's\ncalled fast-tracking.\n\n895\n00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:01,430\nNow fast-tracking's\na little bit different,\n\n896\n00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,490\nbecause with fast-tracking I'm not\nreally throwing money at the problem.\n\n897\n00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,750\nI'm not diving in there and\ndropping requirements.\n\n898\n00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:11,020\nI'm just saying let's look at\nthe schedule as it is right now.\n\n899\n00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,050\nIs there any place in here where I\nmight be able to make an adjustment,\n\n900\n00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,520\nwhere I might be able to do\nsomething to speed this along?\n\n901\n00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,694\nAnd the most common scenario for\nfast-tracking,\n\n902\n00:47:23,694 --> 00:47:29,528\nI'm just going to add an entry here,\nis what we saw a moment ago, lead times.\n\n903\n00:47:29,528 --> 00:47:34,134\nAre there any places in my Gantt chart\nwhere I've got two activities scheduled to\n\n904\n00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:38,207\nhappen one after the other,\nwhen one could get started a little early?\n\n905\n00:47:38,207 --> 00:47:40,815\nAnd you'll find that throughout\nyour calendar, because when you\n\n906\n00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:43,856\ndo your sequencing of activities,\nyou're not really thinking about that.\n\n907\n00:47:43,856 --> 00:47:45,911\nYou're just thinking What depends on what?\n\n908\n00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:48,703\nBut you start to look at it and\nyou say, you know what?\n\n909\n00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:51,420\nIt could get started a little bit early.\n\n910\n00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:56,830\nSo we look at our calendar and we locate\nany place where we might have that.\n\n911\n00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:01,350\nSo here where I said I knew I needed\na three day lag time, so I start\n\n912\n00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:05,260\nlooking at the calendar, I go, wait a\nminute, this is Thursday and Friday here.\n\n913\n00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,500\nAnd then these guys,\nthat's a five day lag time right?\n\n914\n00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,330\nCould I shorten that up?\n\n915\n00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,270\nMove this one to Monday?\" Absolutely.\n\n916\n00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,010\nWouldn't hurt anything.\n\n917\n00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,010\nOr maybe I call the foundation guys.\n\n918\n00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:20,100\nAnd I say, hey I know you guys were gonna\ncome in here and get started there.\n\n919\n00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,890\nCan we get that done a little bit earlier?\n\n920\n00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,060\nYou just call them on the phone and say,\n\n921\n00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,080\nhey you guys are scheduled\nto come in on a Wednesday.\n\n922\n00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,780\nAny chance you could come in on a Monday?\n\n923\n00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,375\nAnd same thing with these, the guys who\nare framing up a wall, you say, all right,\n\n924\n00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,125\ndo you guys take weekends off?\n\n925\n00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:36,565\nDifferent construction\ncompanies work different ways.\n\n926\n00:48:36,565 --> 00:48:39,205\nMaybe they're perfectly happy with\nworking on Saturday and Sunday.\n\n927\n00:48:39,205 --> 00:48:42,065\nMaybe that's a normal workday for them,\nso it's not going to cost you extra.\n\n928\n00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:43,340\nMight as well do it, right?\n\n929\n00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,570\nJust because you work Monday through\nFriday eight to five doesn't mean that\n\n930\n00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:47,650\nthey have to.\n\n931\n00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,330\nSo, you may choose to move that up.\n\n932\n00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,470\nYou may find another company.\n\n933\n00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,880\nAnd say all right, well these guys\ndon't work on Saturday and Sunday.\n\n934\n00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,690\nLet me find another one that does.\n\n935\n00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:56,950\nAnd so you call around.\n\n936\n00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,180\nMaybe your number two choice for\ncontractor does.\n\n937\n00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,580\nAnd so now you switch over to them.\n\n938\n00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,900\nYou switch contractors.\n\n939\n00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,690\nSo you may find ways where\nyou can optimize that, and\n\n940\n00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,100\nit can be as simple as that.\n\n941\n00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,940\nIf I just notice here,\nhey, there's this weekend,\n\n942\n00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,217\nso I don't need three days of lag,\nI can get away with just two days now.\n\n943\n00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:17,095\nBecause when I do two days of lag,\nnow they start on Monday.\n\n944\n00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:18,715\nI still actually have four, right?\n\n945\n00:49:18,715 --> 00:49:22,365\nSo Thursday and Friday, it gets to dry.\n\n946\n00:49:22,365 --> 00:49:23,625\nSaturday and Sunday, it gets to dry.\n\n947\n00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:27,550\nSo it's really getting four days\nbefore these guys fire up on Monday.\n\n948\n00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:31,340\nSo I just shortened that\nparticular path one day.\n\n949\n00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,202\nSame thing here with these guys, where I\nsaid all right these guys are unboxing\n\n950\n00:49:36,202 --> 00:49:39,087\n100 computers a day for four days, right.\n\n951\n00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:42,333\nSo why don't I get these\nguys to start on day two.\n\n952\n00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:45,540\n100 computers are already unboxed\nthey can start undoing it.\n\n953\n00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,680\nWell If I look at the math on this and\nI say all right,\n\n954\n00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,270\nthey told me it would take ten\ndays to set up 400 computers.\n\n955\n00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:56,703\nThat means they are doing\n40 computers per day.\n\n956\n00:49:56,703 --> 00:50:01,870\nSo that means they can really get started\nas soon as 40 computers were unboxed.\n\n957\n00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:06,550\nWell, these guys told me they could\nunbox 400 computers in four days.\n\n958\n00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:11,710\nSo that means they're unboxing\nroughly 100 computers a day.\n\n959\n00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,405\nAnd in an eight hour period,\nthey're unboxing 100 computers.\n\n960\n00:50:14,405 --> 00:50:19,190\nThat means in four hours,\nthey would unbox 50 computers.\n\n961\n00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,358\nSo not only could I get\nstarted here after one day,\n\n962\n00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:24,557\nI can get started after half a day.\n\n963\n00:50:24,557 --> 00:50:29,392\nSo I can go back here and\nI can change my lead time from\n\n964\n00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:34,464\nnegative 3 days to a negative\n3.5 days like that.\n\n965\n00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,420\nAnd now I'm getting started\nhalf a day earlier, right?\n\n966\n00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,710\nIt's just half a day gain.\n\n967\n00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,900\nWhat does that get me?\n\n968\n00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:44,210\nWell, at a minimum it's gonna get me\nhalf a day of reserve right here, right?\n\n969\n00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,974\nHalf a day I didn't have before that\nnow I do in case things fall behind.\n\n970\n00:50:47,974 --> 00:50:52,580\nBut that's the kind of stuff that we look\nfor when we're trying to get the best use\n\n971\n00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,987\nout of our schedule,\nschedule optimization, all right?\n\n972\n00:50:55,987 --> 00:51:01,164\nAnd that's the thing behind fast tracking.\n\n973\n00:51:01,164 --> 00:51:03,026\nLet me, I put this in the wrong spot.\n\n974\n00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:08,620\nThat's the thing about fast tracking\nis lead times don't cost us anything.\n\n975\n00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,689\nWe just identify places we\ncan take advantage of them.\n\n976\n00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:19,433\nOther places we can do optimizations\nhere is by assigning resources.\n\n977\n00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:22,545\nI might have a web developer\nassigned to my project.\n\n978\n00:51:22,545 --> 00:51:27,437\nI might have two web developers, and\nas I look at how my tasks are scheduled,\n\n979\n00:51:27,437 --> 00:51:31,600\nI might have downtime for\nsome developers in my schedule.\n\n980\n00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,750\nSo if I go through and I look.\n\n981\n00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:40,170\nLet's say,\nI hate it in the new versions of Project,\n\n982\n00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:44,350\nhow they don't show the view\nbar by default anymore, and\n\n983\n00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:48,180\nthen every time I come in here, I have\nto remember how to turn the view bar on.\n\n984\n00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,680\nIt's, let's see, in here somewhere,\nthere, view bar.\n\n985\n00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,460\nI love my view bar.\n\n986\n00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,150\nIf you started with\nMicrosoft Project in 2010-\n\n987\n00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,330\n>> That's what happened, yep.\n\n988\n00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,370\n>> Then you don't know about the view bar,\nand\n\n989\n00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,970\nyou just used the main\nstuff that they give you.\n\n990\n00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:05,278\nBut if you were an old school user,\nthe view bar was awesome,\n\n991\n00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:07,783\nbecause you'd just flip between\nyour views, it's right here.\n\n992\n00:52:07,783 --> 00:52:11,552\nBut anyhow, so\nif I go into my resource sheet,\n\n993\n00:52:11,552 --> 00:52:16,593\nwhich is buried in here somewhere,\nthere, resource sheet.\n\n994\n00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:21,191\nAnd so I've got Web Developer 1,\nWeb Developer 2.\n\n995\n00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,765\nThat didn't save me any time did it?\n\n996\n00:52:27,765 --> 00:52:31,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was like here,\n\n997\n00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:34,240\nI'll just punch it in this way so\nI don't have to type the whole thing, and\n\n998\n00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,490\nnow it won't let me rename the person.\n\n999\n00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,053\nWonderful.\n\n1000\n00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:40,768\nWeb Developer 2, all right.\n\n1001\n00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:44,190\nAnd I'm scheduling these guys for\nwork throughout my project, right?\n\n1002\n00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:49,020\nSo I go back to my Gantt chart, and so\n\n1003\n00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:54,823\nI've got UI design meeting, UI mockups.\n\n1004\n00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:59,413\nI've got back end design meeting,\n\n1005\n00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:02,933\nback end mockups, right.\n\n1006\n00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:06,719\nAnd the UI design meeting I know that\nthat's going to be just a one day\n\n1007\n00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:07,390\nactivity.\n\n1008\n00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,830\nBack end design meeting is one day also.\n\n1009\n00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,330\nThe UI mockup, I'm going to put that down\nas a five day, but the back end, boy,\n\n1010\n00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,970\nthat can take awhile so\nI'm going to put that in as ten days.\n\n1011\n00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:23,428\nNow when I assign my resources,\nI'm going to give one to Web Developer 1,\n\n1012\n00:53:23,428 --> 00:53:30,328\nand the other one to Web Developer 2,\nwhich we can't really see here very well.\n\n1013\n00:53:30,328 --> 00:53:31,372\nThere.\n\n1014\n00:53:35,877 --> 00:53:38,300\nAll right, so I'm just gonna assign\nthese resources out real quick there.\n\n1015\n00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,005\nAnd let me just link these so\n\n1016\n00:53:40,005 --> 00:53:42,100\nwe can kind of get an idea of\nhow this is gonna map together.\n\n1017\n00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,740\nAll right.\nAnd these can be going on at the same\n\n1018\n00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:48,150\ntime, the front end and the back end\nare in the initial stages being developed\n\n1019\n00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,450\nindividually and\nthen we'll combine them later.\n\n1020\n00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:53,530\nSo, Web Developer 1 and 2,\nthey're both busy this day.\n\n1021\n00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,030\nThey've both got meetings.\n\n1022\n00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:58,390\nAnd then the next five days they're both\nworking on their respective project.\n\n1023\n00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:03,440\nBut at the end of day five, or I guess\nit would be day six they're meeting.\n\n1024\n00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,220\nWeb Developer 1 is done.\n\n1025\n00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:09,250\nAnd now Web Developer 1 is\nsitting there waiting for\n\n1026\n00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:13,849\nthe integration testing, or\nintegration design phase and\n\n1027\n00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:18,270\nintegration mock up.\n\n1028\n00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,949\nThese are what's gonna come next.\n\n1029\n00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:27,370\nAnd I probably wanna take my back\nend mock ups and link those to this.\n\n1030\n00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:32,551\nWhoops.\nI'm probably making this more complex than\n\n1031\n00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:38,797\nI really should but I want that one,\nlinked to this one.\n\n1032\n00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:41,094\nI want this one, linked to this one.\n\n1033\n00:54:44,972 --> 00:54:50,610\nI must have some kind of mouse\nthing getting in my way here.\n\n1034\n00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,680\nAll right, let me just manually set this.\n\n1035\n00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,850\nSo right now I've got my integration\ndesign meeting dependent on 32,\n\n1036\n00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,590\nwhich is, that one, and\nI wanna tie it to 30 also.\n\n1037\n00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:06,450\nSo I'm gonna take this one, and\nI'm just gonna tie it to 30.\n\n1038\n00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,810\nFinish to start, there, okay.\n\n1039\n00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:13,550\nSo you'll see that we\ncan't move on with our,\n\n1040\n00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,760\nwhy did that one end up way back there?\n\n1041\n00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,230\n>> I don't think you linked it.\n\n1042\n00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,130\nDid you?\n\n1043\n00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:18,710\nNo, it is.\n\n1044\n00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:19,540\n>> I got it in there as a link.\n\n1045\n00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,080\nI don't know how it ended up back there.\n\n1046\n00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,107\nBut anyhow, so we basically see\nthat our front end gets designed,\n\n1047\n00:55:25,107 --> 00:55:28,351\nour back end gets designed, and\nthen we go in the integration meeting,\n\n1048\n00:55:28,351 --> 00:55:29,558\nwhere they get combined.\n\n1049\n00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:32,629\nWell, for this five day period right here,\n\n1050\n00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:36,535\nWeb Developer 1 is not\nassigned to the project, okay?\n\n1051\n00:55:36,535 --> 00:55:38,415\nThey're not doing anything.\n\n1052\n00:55:38,415 --> 00:55:39,588\nThey're basically sitting\nthere doing nothing.\n\n1053\n00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:41,898\nWell maybe they've got\nsomething else to work on.\n\n1054\n00:55:41,898 --> 00:55:43,292\nMaybe, or maybe they don't.\n\n1055\n00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:45,990\nMaybe they're literally\nsitting there doing nothing.\n\n1056\n00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,660\nThey're browsing Facebook or whatever for\n\n1057\n00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,140\nthose five days,\nwaiting on the backend work to get done.\n\n1058\n00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:53,700\nWell, I could take Web Developer 1 and\n\n1059\n00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:59,690\nI could attach them to this activity down\nhere also, and then I can just set it so\n\n1060\n00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:05,470\nthey're not doing any work these first\nfive days, so that they're free to\n\n1061\n00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,550\nwork on their own, and when they're done,\nthey can jump over here and help out.\n\n1062\n00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:12,940\nAnd maybe when I have two web\ndevelopers working in the back end,\n\n1063\n00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:17,490\nI can get this from a ten day\nactivity down to a seven point five.\n\n1064\n00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,150\nWe can start to do adjustments like that.\n\n1065\n00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:23,260\nSo you look across your calendar for\nanywhere where someone is idle.\n\n1066\n00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,870\nIt is near impossible to see\nthat in your Gantt chart though,\n\n1067\n00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:28,420\nyou can see it here because\nit's really simple.\n\n1068\n00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,570\nBut the more complex your Gantt chart\ngets, the more impossible it is.\n\n1069\n00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,520\nAnd that's why we have our resource\nsheets where we can go in and\n\n1070\n00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,850\npull up our resource graph right here.\n\n1071\n00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:42,680\nAnd you can take a look at people\nlike your web developers, and see\n\n1072\n00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,950\nwhen they're assigned work, when they're\nnot doing anything, when they're idle.\n\n1073\n00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:51,970\nYou can go through and\nkind of page through and spot that.\n\n1074\n00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,350\nAnd then look for places where you\nmight want to go ahead and assign them.\n\n1075\n00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,888\nSo I'm gonna go under resource usage here.\n\n1076\n00:56:56,888 --> 00:57:02,440\nAnd so here's Web Developer 1 and\nWeb Developer 2.\n\n1077\n00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,080\nI know I pulled up a form similar to\nthis in In the other software project,\n\n1078\n00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,770\nlead ray, or lead ray project, whatever.\n\n1079\n00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:12,860\nBut, here I can see Web Developer 1 and\nWeb Developer 2..\n\n1080\n00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,440\nAnd if I, is my shortcut gonna work?\n\n1081\n00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,510\nNo.\n\n1082\n00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,320\n>> Your calendar is just a couple\nof years off, that's the problem.\n\n1083\n00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,300\n>> Is it?\n>> Yeah, cause there had been 14 and\n\n1084\n00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,080\nI been joking around.\n\n1085\n00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,950\n>> Finally starts it.\n\n1086\n00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:24,730\nTwelve.\n\n1087\n00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,150\n>> Oh it's in 2012, All right?\n\n1088\n00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,822\nNormally, if I weren't\nrunning in a virtual machine,\n\n1089\n00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:32,940\nCtrl+ Shift+ F5 would jump\nme right to that activity.\n\n1090\n00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,738\nOh, I'm still in 2013.\n\n1091\n00:57:35,738 --> 00:57:36,920\nAll right ,well anyhow,\n\n1092\n00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,660\nwe can go in here and we can find\nthe hours where they're working.\n\n1093\n00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,720\nAnd the cool part here is we can attach\nthem to these other activities and\n\n1094\n00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,610\nadjust their hours so\nthat we don't have overlap, there it is.\n\n1095\n00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:51,980\nSo I can very clearly see as\nI look here at the calendar,\n\n1096\n00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,680\nsee how I've got right here where\nweb developer one is doing nothing.\n\n1097\n00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,440\nHere's a Thursday and\n\n1098\n00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,050\nFriday where Web Developer 1 is just\nsitting there taking a break, right?\n\n1099\n00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:03,930\nAnd meanwhile, Web Developer 2 is\nbusting their butt doing work.\n\n1100\n00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:06,300\nWeb Developer 1,\nnot doing anything, right?\n\n1101\n00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,500\nSo we can and take web developer1,\n\n1102\n00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:12,920\nand attach them to the back\nend mockups activity.\n\n1103\n00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,330\nBut, they can't work those days because\nthey're dealing with these other ones.\n\n1104\n00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,000\nSo that's when we have to start\nmanually adjusting their hours on\n\n1105\n00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,400\nan individual day basis.\n\n1106\n00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,300\nAnd so on to get the most\nutilization out of them.\n\n1107\n00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,770\nSo if I go back up to my Gantt chart,\nactually, can I do it from here?\n\n1108\n00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:28,960\nI probably don't wanna do it from here.\n\n1109\n00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,870\nI'm gonna go here to my Gantt chart and\nI'll take integration design.\n\n1110\n00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:41,260\nI'll take back end mock ups and under\nresources I'm gonna add Web Developer 1.\n\n1111\n00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,030\nAll right.\n\n1112\n00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,640\nAnd so I'm gonna add,\nI'm gonna leave these units and stuff,\n\n1113\n00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,130\njust that the default which is\ngonna kind of mess up things.\n\n1114\n00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,650\nSee I'm getting a warning over here,\nletting me know,\n\n1115\n00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,060\nthat I've got an over allocated resource.\n\n1116\n00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:56,360\nI've got somebody assigned to do two\nthings at once and so it's broken, right?\n\n1117\n00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,190\nAnd it'll tell me that if I float\nmy mouse over it, there we go.\n\n1118\n00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:04,694\nSo, but I can now go into my resource\n\n1119\n00:59:04,694 --> 00:59:08,739\nusage and I can find that.\n\n1120\n00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:11,396\nAnd I can see my red flags and\nwhat I'm gonna do is,\n\n1121\n00:59:11,396 --> 00:59:15,130\nI'm gonna come through here and\nI'm gonna take Web Developer 1, and\n\n1122\n00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,484\nI'm just gonna zero him out for\nbackend mockups on the days that\n\n1123\n00:59:18,484 --> 00:59:21,930\nI've already got him assigned\nto work on the other activities.\n\n1124\n00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,300\nSo I'm just zeroing those out.\n\n1125\n00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,040\nRight.\n\n1126\n00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,070\nBut then, he's available to work\neight hours that Thursday and\n\n1127\n00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:31,700\nFriday when he's not, you know,\ndoing his own stuff anymore.\n\n1128\n00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,435\nAnd if it continues on, he's available\nto work eight hours there also.\n\n1129\n00:59:35,435 --> 00:59:39,190\nOkay, so now it starts to shrink down,\nonly I broke one of the rules of\n\n1130\n00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:44,420\nMicrosoft, which is if I go back to my\nGantt chart I hard set the duration,\n\n1131\n00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,400\nso I'm not gonna see\nthe benefit of that just yet.\n\n1132\n00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,710\nSee these durations are all hard set.\n\n1133\n00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:53,330\nThey're not estimates anymore, and\n\n1134\n00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:59,400\nthat means that it's not gonna be able\nto do the math to figure that out.\n\n1135\n00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,640\nYeah, now it's gonna be\nreally ticked off at me.\n\n1136\n01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,870\nSo, well, anyhow,\nyou guys kinda got the idea, though.\n\n1137\n01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:07,250\nBack on the resource usage screen.\n\n1138\n01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,620\nLet me just go back to that.\n\n1139\n01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:14,720\nBut by doing this, if I go here and I\nassign that extra person to do some work.\n\n1140\n01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,640\nI should be able to get that done faster.\n\n1141\n01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,410\nSo, I zero hour them here,\nnow they're working eight hours, and\n\n1142\n01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:25,330\nthis is five days of two people\nworking eight hours each, so\n\n1143\n01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:30,180\nI should be able to come through here and\nshorten that up, and say you know what?\n\n1144\n01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,200\nI really just need them to do eight hours,\neight hours, four hours.\n\n1145\n01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,910\nSame thing here.\n\n1146\n01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,120\nAnd then I don't need\neither of them these days.\n\n1147\n01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,520\nWe can actually remove that, and\nif I had let it do its own math,\n\n1148\n01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,070\nit would have shortened the duration\nof this overall activity, so\n\n1149\n01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:45,910\nI'm just gonna shorten that there.\n\n1150\n01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,380\nSee they dropped off.\n\n1151\n01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:50,300\nAnd now, they're getting\nthe same amount of work done, but\n\n1152\n01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,120\nby having that extra person,\n\n1153\n01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:56,480\nwe've been able to shrink it down a bit to\nget it done two and a half days earlier.\n\n1154\n01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,950\nDid it cost me more money?\n\n1155\n01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:02,720\nNo, I had the web developer already, they\nwere sitting there twittling their thumbs,\n\n1156\n01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,600\nnot doing a darn thing, and now I'm\nable to get it done that much faster and\n\n1157\n01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:09,980\ndid it properly calculate the sign?\n\n1158\n01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,000\n>> Scroll down.\n\n1159\n01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,500\n>> Oh, I'm not even looking at it, am I?\n\n1160\n01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,780\nIt still didn't do it.\n\n1161\n01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:18,175\nBut basically, this would shorten up and-\n>> Yeah it did, but but\n\n1162\n01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,715\nyou got it eight days.\n\n1163\n01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:23,315\n>> Yeah whatever.\nSo you can basically sort that out.\n\n1164\n01:01:23,315 --> 01:01:26,025\nI just threw a constraint in,\nso now I really screwed it up.\n\n1165\n01:01:26,025 --> 01:01:28,060\nBut it'll shorten it up\nto accommodate that.\n\n1166\n01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,450\nLook across your calendar,\nyou're looking for two things.\n\n1167\n01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:34,280\nOne, anywhere you can build\nlead time into an activity.\n\n1168\n01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,750\nAnd two, anytime you have unused\nresources that you can allocate out, and\n\n1169\n01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:42,990\nyour project management software probably\nhas some resource utilization screens\n\n1170\n01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,890\nyou can use.\n\n1171\n01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:47,340\nTo go through and look for\nanybody who is not allocated and\n\n1172\n01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,100\nI don't remember the shortcut for it.\n\n1173\n01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:56,090\nBut project actually has a resource\nassignment wizard thing.\n\n1174\n01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,080\nWhat's it here?\n\n1175\n01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,730\nWhere you can pull up a graph.\n\n1176\n01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:01,690\nAnd as you pick up your\nactivities over here.\n\n1177\n01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:05,290\nYou get a little chart down at the bottom\nthat shows their allocation, so\n\n1178\n01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,190\nyou can go through and look for\nactivities and try and\n\n1179\n01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:12,320\nspot people who have nothing assigned\nto them and assign them for that work.\n\n1180\n01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,160\nSo you know,\n\n1181\n01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,520\na lot of these people are already showing\nus allocated cause this stuff overlaps.\n\n1182\n01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,730\nBut you can use that to find\ntheir busy times or whatever, and\n\n1183\n01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,392\nassign them as you go.\n\n1184\n01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:27,500\nAll right, so that takes care of that one,\nwe still have a little bit more but\n\n1185\n01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,180\nI know I went way past our break time so\nlet's do this.\n\n1186\n01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,480\nLet's stop here and take a break.\n\n1187\n01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,170\nWhen we get back,\n\n1188\n01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:36,500\nwe've got a little bit more to talk\nabout before we wrap up scheduling.\n\n1189\n01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,990\nWe are so close to Ronnie, it's exciting.\n\n1190\n01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,720\nA three part series, so\n>> [LAUGH}\n\n1191\n01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,130\n>> Alright well, ladies and\n\n1192\n01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:45,770\ngentlemen stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in a few.\n\n1193\n01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,860\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n1194\n01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,860\nSo at this point, we've covered all our\nvarious tools and techniques except for\n\n1195\n01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,760\none, the very last one.\n\n1196\n01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,880\nAnd that is the scheduling tool.\n\n1197\n01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,010\nThat's our final tool and technique there.\n\n1198\n01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:07,650\nYour scheduling tool, at a minimum,\nIs gonna be a calendar.\n\n1199\n01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,820\nRight, so\nthe next time you buy girl scout cookies,\n\n1200\n01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,730\nyou add on a little extra to get the girl\nscout calendar and there you go, right?\n\n1201\n01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:13,685\nThere's your scheduling tool.\n\n1202\n01:03:13,685 --> 01:03:17,000\n[LAUGH] It can be as simple as that.\n\n1203\n01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,920\nMore often that that though,\nit's scheduling software.\n\n1204\n01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,338\nAnd it might be project based software\nlike Microsoft project, or Gantt project,\n\n1205\n01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:28,970\nor whatever ,or it might\nbe specifically designed\n\n1206\n01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:32,560\nscheduling software like human\nresources management software.\n\n1207\n01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,696\nIt just depends on your organization.\n\n1208\n01:03:33,696 --> 01:03:37,060\nWhatever it is that you use for\na scheduling tool, that's one of the tools\n\n1209\n01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,260\nand techniques here because you're\ngoing to need to keep track of when\n\n1210\n01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,006\nan employee is scheduled for two things\nat once, and who's available when and And\n\n1211\n01:03:44,006 --> 01:03:47,020\nall of that is gonna come down to\nwhatever your tool happens to be.\n\n1212\n01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:55,420\nSo we use all of those tools and\ntechniques to create our project schedule.\n\n1213\n01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,230\nBut notice how the outputs\nare listed here.\n\n1214\n01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:58,920\nThere's quite a few outputs.\n\n1215\n01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,520\nThe project schedule is\nactually number two.\n\n1216\n01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,080\nThat's the schedule of when\nthings are going to occur and\n\n1217\n01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:08,170\nwhat we're going to use as we run\ninto our actual project execution.\n\n1218\n01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,510\nBut number one is even more important.\n\n1219\n01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:15,770\nThe project schedule,\nwe draft that before execution starts.\n\n1220\n01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,420\nSo we don't really know\nwhat's gonna happen.\n\n1221\n01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,940\nWe're doing estimates.\n\n1222\n01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:22,180\nWe're doing our best guess here,\nnot really a guess,\n\n1223\n01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,700\nit should be an educated guess, right?\n\n1224\n01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,700\nBut our best estimate to figure\nout where we want to go on this.\n\n1225\n01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:30,170\nSo we immediately take what's\ncalled a schedule baseline.\n\n1226\n01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:34,310\nThe schedule baseline is a snapshot\nof how that schedule is right now.\n\n1227\n01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:37,370\nAs we go through our project,\nthings are gonna change.\n\n1228\n01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:41,300\nThings are gonna creep up, things that\nwe didn't expect, and when that happens,\n\n1229\n01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,080\nwe're gonna have to make adjustments.\n\n1230\n01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,930\nAnd that adjustment is gonna cause\nus to deviate from the baseline.\n\n1231\n01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,038\nSo our project schedule, number two,\n\n1232\n01:04:49,038 --> 01:04:54,920\nthis guy's gonna change as the project\ngoes based on what really happens.\n\n1233\n01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,830\nWe need that baseline to look back and\nsay here's what we planned for.\n\n1234\n01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,641\nSo that at the end of the day we\ncan say here's what we planned for.\n\n1235\n01:05:01,641 --> 01:05:02,919\nHere's what's really happening.\n\n1236\n01:05:02,919 --> 01:05:04,710\nLet's compare the two.\n\n1237\n01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:07,230\nSo the baseline is really\nthe most important.\n\n1238\n01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:12,800\nThat is the schedule as we came up\nwith before we went into execution,\n\n1239\n01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,850\nand it's not a living document.\n\n1240\n01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:17,340\nThe baseline is frozen in time.\n\n1241\n01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:21,630\nAnd then as the project goes on,\nthe project schedule is what we follow and\n\n1242\n01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:22,680\nwhat we modify.\n\n1243\n01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,850\nIt is a living document.\n\n1244\n01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:27,630\nNow, any modification of that schedule,\nwe've already seen, affects the whole rest\n\n1245\n01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:30,460\nof the project, so you don't want\nto change it if you can avoid it.\n\n1246\n01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,540\nBut things happen, right?\n\n1247\n01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,690\nPeople get behind schedule.\n\n1248\n01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:35,090\nPeople get ahead of schedule.\n\n1249\n01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:38,484\nIt gives you the opportunity\nto make adjustments, and\n\n1250\n01:05:38,484 --> 01:05:40,490\nthat is your project schedule.\n\n1251\n01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:43,140\nAll right, the other things\nhere are pretty common sense.\n\n1252\n01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,430\nThe schedule data.\n\n1253\n01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:47,960\nSo if we have activities on the schedule,\n\n1254\n01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:52,390\neach activity has certain data associated\nwith it, what resource is attached to it,\n\n1255\n01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:55,990\nwhat hours they're working,\nhow much money they need to get paid.\n\n1256\n01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:58,900\nWe'll see all those different\ndetails attached to each activity.\n\n1257\n01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,560\nThe project calendars.\n\n1258\n01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,340\nThe project calendars are the calendar for\nthe project itself,\n\n1259\n01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:07,780\nwhich is what we normally think of,\nbut also our resource calendars,\n\n1260\n01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,590\nwhen individual people can work,\nwhen we have them available,\n\n1261\n01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:13,750\nwhen they're gonna be doing what they do,\nwhen equipment is available.\n\n1262\n01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,070\nThese are all different calendars\nthat we're gonna be tracking.\n\n1263\n01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:19,372\nThey're really our resource\ncalendars from way back here,\n\n1264\n01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:23,950\nnumber six, but being brought in\nnow into our official calendar.\n\n1265\n01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,860\nAfter that, just updates, right?\n\n1266\n01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:32,440\nIf we didn't have a project management\nplan for developing our schedule,\n\n1267\n01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,370\nwe look at all the things we did\nhere to develop our schedule and\n\n1268\n01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:38,290\nwe turn that into our plan for the future.\n\n1269\n01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:41,990\nAs people develop a schedule,\nthey don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n1270\n01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,800\nThey can go back and\nfollow the process that we followed here.\n\n1271\n01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,610\nAnd then lastly, project document updates.\n\n1272\n01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,510\nWe may need to go back and\nupdate our scope.\n\n1273\n01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:54,100\nRemember, our scope statement had things\nlike what our schedule was gonna be and\n\n1274\n01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,820\nwhat our budget was gonna be.\n\n1275\n01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,970\nWe know a lot more now than we knew then.\n\n1276\n01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:02,758\nWe might need to go and update those,\nand it's okay right now.\n\n1277\n01:07:02,758 --> 01:07:05,950\nRemember, we wanna keep that to\na minimum once we get into execution.\n\n1278\n01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:08,710\nBut while we're in the planning phase,\nchange is reality.\n\n1279\n01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:13,780\nSo we make those changes and we just\nmake sure that we're ready to rock.\n\n1280\n01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,290\nSo those are our project document updates.\n\n1281\n01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:19,490\nThe main output of this is\nthat schedule baseline,\n\n1282\n01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:22,810\nand the project schedule which would\nbe the same thing at this point.\n\n1283\n01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:26,220\nThey don't deviate until the first\nchange happens in execution.\n\n1284\n01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,800\nSo these two are really the same thing\nwhen we talk about the output at\n\n1285\n01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,780\nthis point in time.\n\n1286\n01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,920\nSome of the other things that we might\noutput, things like a milestone list.\n\n1287\n01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:38,180\nWe've seen the various project views.\n\n1288\n01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,690\nActually where was that?\n\n1289\n01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:40,370\nSomewhere around here.\n\n1290\n01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,720\nThere.\nSo we've seen the various project views\n\n1291\n01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,900\nhere, like in our, oh, come on.\n\n1292\n01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,920\nLet's get back to my Gantt chart.\n\n1293\n01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,610\nAll right, so\n\n1294\n01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:57,360\nwe've seen the various views like this\nwhen we have that calendar that we output.\n\n1295\n01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,820\nWe might keep it in the Gantt chart.\n\n1296\n01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:01,650\nIt's got our activity list and\nkind of a schedule.\n\n1297\n01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:05,110\nBut a lot of software will have\nother views, like a calendar view so\n\n1298\n01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:08,450\nyou can lay out what tasks\nare occurring on what days.\n\n1299\n01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:10,760\nYou'll have resource calendars,\ntoo, so you can say,\n\n1300\n01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,530\nshow me the calendar for web developer\none and just show me those events.\n\n1301\n01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,520\nWhatever view it is that you\nsettle on is entirely up to you.\n\n1302\n01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,360\nYou pick what you need and\nyou chart it out.\n\n1303\n01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,240\nThat's gonna be one of your outputs.\n\n1304\n01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,920\nYou might also have a milestone list,\nor a milestone calendar.\n\n1305\n01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,670\nYou might have a calendar that just shows\nmilestones so you can keep track of that.\n\n1306\n01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:34,208\nI normally do that as a list, and in fact,\nI've got a template that shows that.\n\n1307\n01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:36,978\nWhere's my milestone list here?\n\n1308\n01:08:36,978 --> 01:08:39,400\nAll right, and so\nI like to do a milestone list.\n\n1309\n01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,140\nI think I brought this up in another show.\n\n1310\n01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,240\nI don't remember.\n\n1311\n01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:47,550\nBut basically I'll put the milestones in\nhere along with when they're going to be\n\n1312\n01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,660\noccurring, so\nthat we can keep track of that.\n\n1313\n01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:55,250\nBy ID here I'm normally referring\nto the ID in the project file.\n\n1314\n01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:59,050\nSo you know every activity inside\nof Microsoft Project has an ID, so\n\n1315\n01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,170\nI track it that way.\n\n1316\n01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,700\nBut you'll also change it and\nput a date in.\n\n1317\n01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,670\nI've got ID twice, Interesting.\n\n1318\n01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:07,420\nSo anyhow,\nwe might throw in a date there instead so\n\n1319\n01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,570\nwe can keep track of when\nthat milestone occurs.\n\n1320\n01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:12,560\nWe can use this to track whether or\nnot we're hitting those milestones,\n\n1321\n01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,470\nwhether they were successful.\n\n1322\n01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:17,280\nA lot of people don't bother\nwith a milestone list because\n\n1323\n01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:22,160\nwe don't necessarily need it since we\ncan track our milestones right here.\n\n1324\n01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,960\nYou'll see here's a milestone\nscenario test pass.\n\n1325\n01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,450\nAnd so we know if we hit it or not based\non whether we're on schedule, on target.\n\n1326\n01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,370\nAnd we'll see that in the monitoring and\n\n1327\n01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:36,110\nanalysis phase when we get to that\nlater on, monitoring and controlling.\n\n1328\n01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:40,060\nWe'll see how we track that progress.\n\n1329\n01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,550\nThat's basically it.\n\n1330\n01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:42,780\nThose are our outputs.\n\n1331\n01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:48,050\nIt's really not that crazy as far\nas what needs to be done there.\n\n1332\n01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:50,790\nWe generate this calendar,\nand hopefully it's done.\n\n1333\n01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,690\nWe still haven't looked at budget though.\n\n1334\n01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,110\nWe gotta figure that out.\n\n1335\n01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:57,900\nAnd we haven't really looked\nin depth at human resources.\n\n1336\n01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,510\nTypically these things are all\nbeing done at the same time.\n\n1337\n01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:05,170\nThe schedule, the budget and the resources\nall planned at the same time.\n\n1338\n01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:08,389\nBut we're breaking it up here\nto make it easier to grasp.\n\n1339\n01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,810\nIn real life land,\nby the time I generate this calendar,\n\n1340\n01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:12,970\nI've already generated the other stuff.\n\n1341\n01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:14,930\nBut we still need to go back and\ngenerate the other things.\n\n1342\n01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:17,980\nFortunately, things like budget aren't\ngoing to affect our schedule much,\n\n1343\n01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,680\nalthough it can.\n\n1344\n01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,870\nYou'll see that in building projects,\nif you're building a house.\n\n1345\n01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:29,287\nWhen a construction contractor or\nproject manager goes to build a house,\n\n1346\n01:10:29,287 --> 01:10:32,706\nthey go to the bank and\nthey say I need a building loan, and\n\n1347\n01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:36,569\nwe're gonna be building\na house that costs $800,000.\n\n1348\n01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:40,040\nAnd the bank will say sure,\nwe'll guarantee that.\n\n1349\n01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,370\nBut they won't give it to him upfront.\n\n1350\n01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,480\nThey don't just say,\nhere's 800 grand, good luck.\n\n1351\n01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,318\nThey say okay,\nyour first disbursement is $200,000.\n\n1352\n01:10:47,318 --> 01:10:49,889\nAnd when you show us\nyou've done this work,\n\n1353\n01:10:49,889 --> 01:10:53,935\nyou'll get your second\ndisbursement of $200,000 or so on.\n\n1354\n01:10:53,935 --> 01:10:56,745\nAnd so they'll have scheduled\ndisbursements based on\n\n1355\n01:10:56,745 --> 01:10:58,033\nthe work that gets done.\n\n1356\n01:10:58,033 --> 01:11:01,702\nAnd in that case, your budget is\nworking around these disbursements.\n\n1357\n01:11:01,702 --> 01:11:04,510\nYou can't do work unless\nyou have the money.\n\n1358\n01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,975\nAnd so cost starts to affect the schedule.\n\n1359\n01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:08,050\nSo we may see that.\n\n1360\n01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:09,730\nNot every project has that.\n\n1361\n01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:12,760\nThe reason banks do it is\nif you don't do the work,\n\n1362\n01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,860\nthe bank has to seize the property and\nsell it, and they can only sell it for\n\n1363\n01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:17,770\nthe value of what's been done to it.\n\n1364\n01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:18,890\nIf you haven't done any work but\n\n1365\n01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:21,990\nthey gave you the full amount,\nthey're left holding the bag.\n\n1366\n01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,840\nSo that's the reason you see that.\n\n1367\n01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,899\nDifferent industries have different\nrequirements, so just be aware,\n\n1368\n01:11:27,899 --> 01:11:29,964\nyou've gotta adapt this for\nyour environment.\n\n1369\n01:11:29,964 --> 01:11:34,153\nAll right, let me just check the notes,\nmake sure I didn't leave anything out, but\n\n1370\n01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:35,748\nI think that's pretty much it.\n\n1371\n01:11:35,748 --> 01:11:39,041\nOh Ronnie,\nyou got a few extra things in here,\n\n1372\n01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:43,950\nlike as we generate that schedule data,\nwhat, no I mentioned that.\n\n1373\n01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,910\nResources, we might do a histogram,\na bar graph.\n\n1374\n01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:51,040\nI showed that earlier like the resource\nutilization screens in project.\n\n1375\n01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,490\nWhere it does the bar charts to show\nhow busy people are on different days.\n\n1376\n01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:59,990\nWe might have alternative schedules,\nright, if we're doing what if scenarios.\n\n1377\n01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:02,370\nI don't normally print those out,\nI keep them for my own benefit.\n\n1378\n01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:05,625\nBut you might have several of\nthose that are output also.\n\n1379\n01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:09,580\nAnd any contingency reserves,\nI say you should go ahead and\n\n1380\n01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,110\nclearly denote those in the project.\n\n1381\n01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:13,070\nSo you don't need a separate document for\nit, but\n\n1382\n01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,996\nthat is another thing\nthat might be output.\n\n1383\n01:12:14,996 --> 01:12:15,710\n>> Right.\n\n1384\n01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:18,900\n>> After that yeah,\nit's just the resources we need and\n\n1385\n01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,360\nthe calendars we're tracking.\n\n1386\n01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,360\nThe risk register might be a part of that\nbecause part of your risk is falling\n\n1387\n01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,230\nbehind schedule.\n\n1388\n01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:27,700\nSo here's things that\ncould affect the schedule.\n\n1389\n01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,760\nAgain, something that we\nprepare in the risk phase and\n\n1390\n01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:34,370\nwe'll see that, I mean not the risk\nphase but the risk process group.\n\n1391\n01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:35,750\nAnd so we'll see that a little later, too.\n\n1392\n01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:39,520\nAll right, Ronnie, can you think of\nanything else that we have left out?\n\n1393\n01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,589\n>> I don't think so, I think\neverything is pretty good in coverage.\n\n1394\n01:12:42,589 --> 01:12:43,647\n>> Excellent.\n\n1395\n01:12:43,647 --> 01:12:44,168\nAll right.\n\n1396\n01:12:44,168 --> 01:12:45,207\nWell with that,\n\n1397\n01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:49,821\nwe have now completed what is arguably\nthe longest of the process groups.\n\n1398\n01:12:49,821 --> 01:12:53,372\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Let me go back to our PMBOK here.\n\n1399\n01:12:53,372 --> 01:12:56,520\nSo looking at all the different\nthings involved in scheduling.\n\n1400\n01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,038\nIt's a lot.\n\n1401\n01:12:57,038 --> 01:13:00,340\nAnd this is,\nwhen you say you're a project manager,\n\n1402\n01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:01,572\nin other people's minds,\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n1403\n01:13:01,572 --> 01:13:02,378\n>> This is what they think of,\n\n1404\n01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,950\nthis is what they think you do everyday.\n\n1405\n01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:06,870\nSo it does make up a big piece of it.\n\n1406\n01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:08,800\nWe're gonna see a lot more\nas we go through, though,\n\n1407\n01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,090\ncuz this is really just a small portion.\n\n1408\n01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,151\nWe still have our budget,\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n1409\n01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:13,597\n>> Which is equally important, and\n\n1410\n01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:14,810\nother activities.\n\n1411\n01:13:14,810 -->

and welcome back\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,130\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,750\nBack here again Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,650\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,168\n>> It is going extremely well.\n\n8\n00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:48,700\nI did photobomb the Kim Kardashian and\nKanye West wedding so\n\n9\n00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,630\nI'm in every one of their wedding photos.\n\n10\n00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,050\nNice, nice.\n\n11\n00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,521\nWas it as elegant an affair\nas you had hoped it would be?\n\n12\n00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,802\n>> It was a little on the cheap\nside to tell you the truth.\n\n13\n00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:59,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n14\n00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,930\ncongratulations to the newlyweds, I\nsuppose, if anybody even cares about them.\n\n15\n00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,670\nBut I am gonna comment here real\nquick that this is a special\n\n16\n00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,270\nsauna edition of ITProTV.\n\n17\n00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,300\nThe air conditioning team is actually\nhere working on the roof right now.\n\n18\n00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,320\nSo if you hear crazy footsteps, it's not\nSanta Claus landing to bring us presents.\n\n19\n00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,220\nIt's Santa Claus landing to\nbring us air conditioning.\n\n20\n00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,290\n>> Yes.\n>> So if you see us beading sweat on our\n\n21\n00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,190\nbrows it's not because we're panicked or\nstressed out.\n\n22\n00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,630\nIt's just because it's really hot in here.\n\n23\n00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,590\n>> Hot.\n>> These studio lights are like\n\n24\n00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,365\nan Easy-bake Oven.\n\n25\n00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:37,285\nSo the end of this episode we'll have\ntiny little cupcakes that taste terrible.\n\n26\n00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:39,695\nAnd that's what we're going for.\n\n27\n00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,305\nAll right.\nSo ladies and gentlemen,\n\n28\n00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:45,215\nwe are continuing on with\nthe planning process here inside of\n\n29\n00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:49,570\nthe Project Management Institute's Project\nManagement Professional Certification.\n\n30\n00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,140\nAnd we've moved the schedule.\n\n31\n00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,930\nWhich boy, that was a big chunk, right.\n\n32\n00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,300\nIt took us three episodes\nto move through that.\n\n33\n00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,450\nThis one today is gonna\nbe cost management.\n\n34\n00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,960\nAnd it's almost a mirror\nof schedule management.\n\n35\n00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,560\nA lot of what we do under\nschedule management is the same\n\n36\n00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,750\nthing under cost management.\n\n37\n00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,940\nThe only difference is instead of dealing\nwith time, you're dealing with money.\n\n38\n00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,080\nMost of the systems are the same.\n\n39\n00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,420\nSo when we look at the process groups, let\nme just pull this up here in the PMBOK.\n\n40\n00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,820\nWhen we go into all of our process groups,\n\n41\n00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,020\nwe have this huge chuck here for\nProject Time Management and\n\n42\n00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,770\njust three little, sad\nProject Cost Management entries in here.\n\n43\n00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,460\nThe reason is twofold.\n\n44\n00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,460\nOne reason is a lot of it is duplicate\nof what we have already seen.\n\n45\n00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,090\nWe don't need a ton more infrastructure\nand bureaucracy around it.\n\n46\n00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,850\nThe second reason is not all project\nmanagers out there manage their budget.\n\n47\n00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,050\n>> Right.\n>> Also.\n\n48\n00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,520\nOften times they'll have an accounting\nteam or an accounting department.\n\n49\n00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,330\nAccounts payable.\n\n50\n00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,780\nAccounts receivable all that good stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,850\nThat is managing the finances\nof your project.\n\n52\n00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,730\nSo there are many organizations that\ndeploy formal project management and\n\n53\n00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,230\njust knock number seven right now.\n\n54\n00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,300\nJust that's it,\nit's not even apart of our project.\n\n55\n00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,340\nWell, I've worked in\nenvironments like that,\n\n56\n00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,740\nand even in those environments,\nI still tracked my cost.\n\n57\n00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,880\nAnd I did it because there's some neat\ntechniques we'll see in the monitoring and\n\n58\n00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,580\ncontrolling phase where we can try,\nI glamorize it a little bit.\n\n59\n00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,950\nWe can try and predict the future.\n\n60\n00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,520\nTo see what our project is trending like\nand if we're not monitoring that stuff.\n\n61\n00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,750\nWe don't stand any chance of being\nable to do something like that.\n\n62\n00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,860\nYou know, it's an important thing.\n\n63\n00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,760\nAnd we're really leveraging some\nof the same technologies from\n\n64\n00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,540\nProject Time Management.\n\n65\n00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,670\nAll right.\nSo let's dive in and take a look at it.\n\n66\n00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,340\nThe first process group we're gonna\nlook at is Plan Cost Management.\n\n67\n00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,690\nMuch like up here we did\nPlan Schedule Management.\n\n68\n00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,350\nWell what is plan cost management?\n\n69\n00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,430\nIt's the same thing.\n\n70\n00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,080\nWe are figuring out how we\nwant to manage our costs.\n\n71\n00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,500\nHow we want to manage that.\n\n72\n00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,740\nAnd if you've already got a project\nmanagement plan in place,\n\n73\n00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,490\nif your company has been doing formal\nproject management for a while.\n\n74\n00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,730\nYou don't even need to worry about this\nprocess because your cost management plan\n\n75\n00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,520\nis already made.\n\n76\n00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,340\nBut if it isn't,\nthen you've got to create one.\n\n77\n00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,910\nSo you go through these\nother processes figuring out\n\n78\n00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,500\nwhat it is that you're going to do.\n\n79\n00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,120\nAnd when you find the model\nthat works best for you,\n\n80\n00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,120\nyou then document that, and\nit becomes our cost management plan.\n\n81\n00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,700\nSo this is one of our more\nsimple processes right here.\n\n82\n00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,130\nOur input would be\nthe project management plan.\n\n83\n00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,350\nBecause if we already have one it's\ngoing to stay exactly what we need to do\n\n84\n00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,260\nto manage our costs and\nwe're pretty much done.\n\n85\n00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,600\nBut if we don't we take what ever we have.\n\n86\n00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,630\nWhatever we have as a management plan.\n\n87\n00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,890\nWe take our project charter, which says\nwhat we're trying to achieve with this\n\n88\n00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,220\nproject And then we take\nenterprise environmental factors.\n\n89\n00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,890\nWhatever the laws, regulations,\nstatutes, standards, whatever we follow.\n\n90\n00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,660\nWhatever they say we need to do.\n\n91\n00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,820\nAnd we combine that with\norganizational process assets.\n\n92\n00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,790\nAssets, whatever paperwork\nour company already has.\n\n93\n00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,680\nIf we have templates,\nif we have things like that, we use them.\n\n94\n00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,500\nAll right?\n\n95\n00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,280\nThen we just apply some\nvery simple things to it.\n\n96\n00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,180\nExpert judgment.\n\n97\n00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,930\nWe've seen that one time and\ntime again, right?\n\n98\n00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,630\nUse your noodle.\n\n99\n00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,229\nWhat's in your head?\n\n100\n00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,010\nAnalytical techniques.\n\n101\n00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,100\nThere are a number of analytical\ntechniques available to us and\n\n102\n00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,570\nwe're going to see several of them.\n\n103\n00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,930\nYou don't necessarily\nneed to use all of them.\n\n104\n00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,260\nSo you need to pick which ones\nare going to be the ones you use in\n\n105\n00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,980\nyour organization.\n\n106\n00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,880\nAnd then lastly meetings.\n\n107\n00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,810\nYou have meetings with\nthe other project managers.\n\n108\n00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,560\nThe PMO whoever.\n\n109\n00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,390\nTo come up with at the end\nthis Cost Management Plan.\n\n110\n00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,550\nHow we're going to manage costs.\n\n111\n00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,970\nSo there's not a ton to it.\n\n112\n00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,050\nIf this is the very first formal\nproject management that we're doing.\n\n113\n00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,725\nWe're gonna skip this process.\n\n114\n00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,430\nWe're gonna skip it.\n\n115\n00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,210\nDo the other two first.\n\n116\n00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,310\nAnd by the other two,\nI mean estimate cost and determine budget.\n\n117\n00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,540\nAnd by the time we build that budget, we\nnow know what we had to go through, and we\n\n118\n00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,810\nuse that to serve as the template process\nfor creating a cost budget in the future.\n\n119\n00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,400\nBut if we have done this time and\ntime again.\n\n120\n00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,100\nWe get that data.\n\n121\n00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,130\nAnd that doesn't mean we necessarily\nhave to run it in its stock form.\n\n122\n00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,670\nWe might need to tweak it,\noptimize it, whatever.\n\n123\n00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,140\nAnd so we kinda go through that process.\n\n124\n00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,120\nSo pretty straight forward, there, and so\n\n125\n00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,610\nwe won't see a whole heck of a lot for\nplanning cost management.\n\n126\n00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,060\nThe inputs, it's all pretty much the same\nstuff that we've been dealing with so far.\n\n127\n00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,850\nNothing really new and\nearth-shattering there.\n\n128\n00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,490\nTools and techniques.\n\n129\n00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,910\nAgain, nothing really new and\nearth-shattering,\n\n130\n00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,860\njust analytical techniques.\n\n131\n00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,400\nWe break down the different\ntools that are available to us.\n\n132\n00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,150\nAnd which ones we adopt,\nwhich ones we choose to use.\n\n133\n00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,740\nWe're gonna take a look at\nthese here in a minute.\n\n134\n00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,710\nAnd you'll see some of them are really\nnot appropriate for small businesses,\n\n135\n00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,125\nso they're just useful for\nlarge organizations.\n\n136\n00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:36,945\nZ.\nKind of pick and\n\n137\n00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:39,825\nchoose based on what works for you.\n\n138\n00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:43,425\nAnd then lastly we have our output,\nyou know, that Project Management Plan and\n\n139\n00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:45,955\nit should contain a number\nof different things.\n\n140\n00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,635\nAnd we actually got\na little template here.\n\n141\n00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:51,235\nI'll show you.\nIt's a little easier to swallow here.\n\n142\n00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,760\nLet me get ITProTV templates.\n\n143\n00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,810\nAnd cost management plan.\n\n144\n00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,100\nHere we go.\n\n145\n00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,510\nSo we specify some really simple things.\n\n146\n00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,930\nThese are guidelines we're gonna\nfollow as we deal with our budget.\n\n147\n00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,010\nFirst off, level of accuracy.\n\n148\n00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,060\nWhen we do estimates,\nthere's always room for error.\n\n149\n00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,510\nSo we specify right off the top,\nwhat is our expected level of accuracy.\n\n150\n00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,450\nWhat error rate do we want to allow.\n\n151\n00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,770\nUnits of measure.\n\n152\n00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,710\nAre we doing this in U.S.\ndollars or the Euro?\n\n153\n00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,190\nOr what is it that we're using to\nserve as our currency unit of measure?\n\n154\n00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,650\nAnd then, any thresholds that we have.\n\n155\n00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,330\nIf we start to have deviations.\n\n156\n00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,920\nOur level of accuracy,\nif we start to get too far.\n\n157\n00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,700\nAt which points do we set up, our,\nreserves kick in, red flags, and\n\n158\n00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,630\nthings like that.\n\n159\n00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,960\nWhere do we want to consider that\narea where we need to start acting.\n\n160\n00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,481\nRules for performance measurement.\n\n161\n00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:47,180\nHow do we measure what's going\non as far as our costs and\n\n162\n00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,843\ngauge that against our original plan?\n\n163\n00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,353\nWe're not really gonna look at that now,\n\n164\n00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:53,825\nwe're gonna look at that in\na monitoring and In controlling phase.\n\n165\n00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:57,072\nCuz at that point, you're looking at\nhow that money is being spent and\n\n166\n00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:58,680\nhow we're getting a return on it.\n\n167\n00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,620\nThe cost reporting and format.\n\n168\n00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,050\nSo obviously as we spend money,\nwe need to report that it was spent, and\n\n169\n00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,840\ntell people here's what we've done and\nhere's what we're gonna do.\n\n170\n00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,910\nHow does that get formatted?\n\n171\n00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,890\nYou want it to be consistent across all\nof your projects, so it is easy for\n\n172\n00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,980\nthe accounting team, or whoever to be\nable to determine that information.\n\n173\n00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,860\nAnd then, anything else that we have.\n\n174\n00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,380\nHow we estimate cost.\n\n175\n00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,550\nHow we develop the budget.\n\n176\n00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,910\nYou will notice that both of those\nare tied to our other processes.\n\n177\n00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,230\nEstimate costs, determine budget, right?\n\n178\n00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,910\nSo we're just saying how we're gonna do\nthose, and then updating, monitoring,\n\n179\n00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,460\nand controlling.\n\n180\n00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,500\nWhat we're gonna see later,\nhow that's gonna be managed, too.\n\n181\n00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,040\nSo all of that needs to be put in here,\nand it should be put in here in a way\n\n182\n00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,050\nwhere it's generic enough, but it can\napply to any project in your company.\n\n183\n00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,070\nSo that when you draft it now,\nit'll work time and\n\n184\n00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,800\ntime again as you do future projects.\n\n185\n00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,752\nSo this was the easiest, and\nreally nothing I said there was too\n\n186\n00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:57,480\nsignificant right,\nbecause plan cost management\n\n187\n00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,400\nis really the same as plan schedule\nmanagement or plan scope management.\n\n188\n00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,100\nThey're all kinda the same.\n\n189\n00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,820\nYou figure out what works for\nyou and you document it so\n\n190\n00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,420\nthat you can then use that over and\nover again and be consistent about it.\n\n191\n00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,680\nAll right, so\nthat knocks out our first process group.\n\n192\n00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,110\nWe're really cooking now, we did that in\nthe first ten minutes of the episode.\n\n193\n00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,620\nUnfortunately that's the shortest one,\nright.\n\n194\n00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,830\nThe others are where we're actually\ndealing with the cost management stuff.\n\n195\n00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,720\nAnd they start to grow quite a bit.\n\n196\n00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,870\nSo let's move into the next one,\nwhich is estimate cost.\n\n197\n00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,630\nYou'll see that the third\nprocess is determine the budget.\n\n198\n00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,740\nWe can't really figure out our budget\nunless we know what things cost.\n\n199\n00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,110\nAnd so logically it makes sense\nto do estimate costs first.\n\n200\n00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,790\nAll right.\n\n201\n00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,810\nNow, early on in this series,\n\n202\n00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,540\nI mentioned that we don't have to\ndo this stuff chronologically.\n\n203\n00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,030\nBut there's some things that make sense or\nsome things that build on each other.\n\n204\n00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,640\nEstimating cost is a tricky one because a\nlot of times it is impossible to estimate\n\n205\n00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,530\nyour cost all at once.\n\n206\n00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,820\nIt's something that you do as\nmore information comes in.\n\n207\n00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,930\nYou can start it as early as developing\nthe work breakdown structure.\n\n208\n00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,660\nWhen you develop that work breakdown\nstructure, you're creating work packages.\n\n209\n00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,410\nActual work that needs to be\ndone to complete your project.\n\n210\n00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,130\nYou can start coming up\nwith costs right then.\n\n211\n00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,170\nFiguring out what things are gonna cost,\nwhat labor and so on.\n\n212\n00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,750\nBut you might have things that\nrequire a contractor, and\n\n213\n00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,960\nyou're going to be doing bidding.\n\n214\n00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,860\nSo you send out for quotes, and you\nhaven't even picked who the winner is yet.\n\n215\n00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,460\nYou don't know what that cost is.\n\n216\n00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,460\nAnd so at this stage, you may be able to\nget some of the information in there, but\n\n217\n00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,130\nyou're going to have some holes, right.\n\n218\n00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,650\nThen we go into schedule management, and\n\n219\n00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,080\nwe figure out when things\nare going to occur.\n\n220\n00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,060\nSome things cost more or cost less\ndepending on the time they occur, right.\n\n221\n00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,125\nWe're here in Florida and in Florida\nsomething as simple as hotel rooms.\n\n222\n00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:48,210\nThe price on a hotel room varies\ngreatly depending on the time of year.\n\n223\n00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:54,250\nA hotel room in Florida in February,\nthe second week of February,\n\n224\n00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,730\nis gonna be dirt cheap, but getting one\nin July is going to be double the cost.\n\n225\n00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,020\nThat's just how the state of Florida\nworks, it's a tourism-based industry.\n\n226\n00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,110\nSo, their cost can vary widely\nbased on that schedule.\n\n227\n00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,930\nSo can we estimate the cost\nbefore we know that schedule?\n\n228\n00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,180\nYou can try, but every time that data\ngets updated you'll have to go and\n\n229\n00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,110\nrevise your budgets.\n\n230\n00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,055\nSo it becomes a lot of rework.\n\n231\n00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:22,585\nSo many people will wait,\nfinish the schedule first, and\n\n232\n00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:26,565\nonce that schedule is done,\nthen go into cost management.\n\n233\n00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:27,355\nIt's up to you.\n\n234\n00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,185\nThey don't have to be\ndone chronologically.\n\n235\n00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:30,990\nThey can be done mixed and matched.\n\n236\n00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,450\nPersonally, I usually develop it as I go.\n\n237\n00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,010\nSo as I go I'm creating those numbers,\nand updating, and so on.\n\n238\n00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,870\nAnd only once the scheduling is\ncompletely done do I then go back and\n\n239\n00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,120\nrevisit and say all right,\nI shouldn't have any more holes.\n\n240\n00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,160\nEverything should have\na dollar sign attached to it.\n\n241\n00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,270\nAnd go back and recalculate.\n\n242\n00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,884\nSo just be aware that the order\nthis occurs in can vary.\n\n243\n00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:55,500\nAll right, but when we're ready to\nestimate cost, we wanna get granular.\n\n244\n00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,980\nWe wanna look at an individual\npiece of our project.\n\n245\n00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,860\nNormally an activity or\na work package, and\n\n246\n00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,150\ncome up with what the cost is going to be.\n\n247\n00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,330\nAnd the cost is actually gonna be\na mixture of two things in most cases.\n\n248\n00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,160\nIt's usually gonna be a mixture of labor,\nand materials.\n\n249\n00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,590\nLabor, you've got employees doing work,\nand they probably have an hourly or\n\n250\n00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,720\nsalary wage that's got\nto be accounted for.\n\n251\n00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120\nAnd then materials.\n\n252\n00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,620\nIf you're doing something\nthat creates a tangible good,\n\n253\n00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,190\nlike building a house,\nyou've got a lot of materials.\n\n254\n00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,070\nWood, shingles, cement,\nall that stuff that goes into it.\n\n255\n00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,410\nAnd so we need to know estimates not\njust on the cost of those things but\n\n256\n00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,120\non the quantity of those things, right?\n\n257\n00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,720\nRonnie, do you know like a two by four,\nthey normally get them in like what,\n\n258\n00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,340\nlike eight foot sections or ten foot?\n\n259\n00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> And they run\n\n260\n00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,260\ncouple of bucks each, right?\n\n261\n00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,030\nLet's just say $3 each.\n\n262\n00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,660\nRight?\n\n263\n00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,720\nWell okay, great.\n\n264\n00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,460\nNow I know, hey, if I get a two by four,\nit's going to cost $3.\n\n265\n00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,440\nWonderful.\n\n266\n00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,590\nWell, how many do I need?\n\n267\n00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,680\n25, 2500, or I need 25,000?\n\n268\n00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,590\nI actually have no clue how many two\nby fours go into building a house, but\n\n269\n00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,030\nI imagine it's a lot.\n\n270\n00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,970\nAnd so\nwe need to estimate not just the cost but\n\n271\n00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,910\nthe quantity of a lot of this stuff,\nand that is important.\n\n272\n00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,160\nSame thing with your people.\n\n273\n00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,820\nI might know that a web developer\nis gonna cost me $25 an hour,\n\n274\n00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,540\nbut how many web developers do I need,\nright?\n\n275\n00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,160\nI don't know that.\n\n276\n00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,940\nSo, I might have to reach out\nto my subject matter experts and\n\n277\n00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,850\nfind out that information before I\ncan get a really good cost estimate.\n\n278\n00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,750\nSo let's take a look at\nthe estimate cost process,\n\n279\n00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,980\nwhich I have parked around here somewhere.\n\n280\n00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,480\nHere.\n\n281\n00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,080\nThe first thing you'll notice,\nthis is another full one.\n\n282\n00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,220\nWe've got a lot of stuff in here.\n\n283\n00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,530\nOur inputs are a lot of stuff.\n\n284\n00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,310\nA cost management plan if we have one.\n\n285\n00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,130\nIf we don't, we can make it by without it.\n\n286\n00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,210\nA human resource management plan.\n\n287\n00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,140\nNow why is that important.\n\n288\n00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,989\nWell, the human resource management\nplan is gonna contain information\n\n289\n00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,960\non how we get people\nattached to our project.\n\n290\n00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,560\nI know I need a web developer.\n\n291\n00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920\nHow much is that web developer gonna cost?\n\n292\n00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,110\nWell, my company might employ\nseveral different web developers and\n\n293\n00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,200\nsome might be brand new out of college and\nthey're making $20 an hour and\n\n294\n00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,170\nothers might be professionals have been\nwith the company for 20 years, and\n\n295\n00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,750\nthey're making $50 an hour.\n\n296\n00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,650\nAnd so now,\nI don't know which one I'm going to get.\n\n297\n00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,520\nSo I need to look at my human\nresources' management plan.\n\n298\n00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,900\nI need to approach whoever it is\nthat starts to issue people, and\n\n299\n00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,750\nstart to nail that down and say, hey, I\nknow I'm gonna need three web developers.\n\n300\n00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,200\nWho can I get and what's their salary or\nwhat's their hourly rate so\n\n301\n00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,130\nI can start to budget for it.\n\n302\n00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,230\nWe can't just go with that generic\nplaceholder anymore unless we're lucky\n\n303\n00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,880\nenough to have every person with a generic\nplaceholder make the same amount of money,\n\n304\n00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,050\nwhich is not terribly common.\n\n305\n00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,240\nAll right, so that human resources\nplan we haven't covered yet,\n\n306\n00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,640\nwe haven't gotten to the human\nresources knowledge group yet.\n\n307\n00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,120\nWe'll take a look at that\nin the next few days.\n\n308\n00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,520\nBut if we've got it, we'll grab that.\n\n309\n00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,090\nOur scope baseline isn't gonna have\nmuch in there that's terribly useful for\n\n310\n00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,220\nthat except for one big thing\nwhich is the total project budget.\n\n311\n00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,240\nWe need to know what\nwe're working against.\n\n312\n00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,650\nOur project may not have a budget yet.\n\n313\n00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,750\nIf it doesn't have a budget,\n\n314\n00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,930\nit's the result of these\nestimates that will create it.\n\n315\n00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,435\nBut if we already have a budget,\nif my budget is $1 million,\n\n316\n00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:16,540\nthen as I start working on these estimates\nI know what I'm working against and\n\n317\n00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,410\nif I start to go over that while\nI'm in the estimation phase,\n\n318\n00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,850\nI need to find some alternatives and\ndo some alternatives analysis.\n\n319\n00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,450\nAll right.\n\n320\n00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,090\nOther things that we bring in\nare project schedule, right, and\n\n321\n00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,250\nI already hit on this.\n\n322\n00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,380\nBased on our schedule,\ncertain things can cost more or\n\n323\n00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,030\nless based on timing, and so\nwe need to know that schedule.\n\n324\n00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,480\nOur risk register.\n\n325\n00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,750\nThe only reason we've got risk\nregister here is that, and again.\n\n326\n00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,046\nWe haven't reached the risk\nknowledge area yet.\n\n327\n00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:48,775\nBut with the risk register, one of the\nthings that we might do is see a risk, and\n\n328\n00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:52,659\nthe way we address it is by setting\nup A cash reserve, all right.\n\n329\n00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:56,040\nAnd we might set a cash reserve\njust in case something happens.\n\n330\n00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,727\nSo we need to be able to look at the risk\nregister to factor in that cash reserve,\n\n331\n00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:01,233\nright.\n\n332\n00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:06,992\nLet's say that we are planning\na outdoor rock concert, all right.\n\n333\n00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:09,920\nAnd one of the risks\nis that it might rain.\n\n334\n00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,810\nSo, the risk handlers,\nthey're going to make some decisions.\n\n335\n00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,490\nThey could say, you know what, forget it,\nlet's just do an indoor concert.\n\n336\n00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,470\nNow the risk is gone,\nwe don't worry about it.\n\n337\n00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,200\nBut they might say, you know what,\nlet's do this: Let's put down a deposit\n\n338\n00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,310\non renting some tents for\nthat day, all right?\n\n339\n00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,090\nAnd if it looks like it's going\nto rain we'll call that in and\n\n340\n00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,390\nsay get those tents out there, right.\n\n341\n00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,300\nBut, if it's not going to rain we\nwon't and we're just out the deposit.\n\n342\n00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,060\nThis is a very common thing.\n\n343\n00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,990\nSo, they put that in place.\n\n344\n00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,431\nNow, I need to have in my estimate costs\nwhat that deposit was because that's money\n\n345\n00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:42,970\nwe're going to spend no matter what.\n\n346\n00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,440\nAnd then the reserve that say's if it\nrains we have a call on the tents and\n\n347\n00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,670\nhere's the X amount of\ndollars we have to pay extra.\n\n348\n00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,530\nI need to be aware of that.\n\n349\n00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,110\nSo the risk register is an input here\n\n350\n00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,350\nbecause I need to see anywhere\ncash reserves are involved.\n\n351\n00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,880\nOr for purchasing insurance premiums,\nthings like that.\n\n352\n00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,300\nAnywhere that is, I need that info.\n\n353\n00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,872\nAnd then our two favorites, right.\n\n354\n00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:05,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Enterprise environmental factors\n\n355\n00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,740\nan organizational process assets.\n\n356\n00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,230\nYou know, we do have one here in a minute,\nunder determined budget but,\n\n357\n00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,830\nwe have organizational process assets\nwithout enterprise environmental factor.\n\n358\n00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,630\nSo, its not always a given then but,\n\n359\n00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,910\nyou do normally have those\ntwo turkeys right there.\n\n360\n00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,880\nAll right, so\nwe take all that information.\n\n361\n00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,220\nAnd what do we do with it?\n\n362\n00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,370\nWell, we do a lot with it.\n\n363\n00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,570\nComing up with a budget is hard.\n\n364\n00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,000\nIt is hard because there are so\nmany variables.\n\n365\n00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,660\nIt doesn't come down to just\nthe purchase of a particular item.\n\n366\n00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,240\nThere is always more stuff involved.\n\n367\n00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,950\nThere are taxes and shipping.\n\n368\n00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,210\nThere are man hours for\nthe purchasing itself.\n\n369\n00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,350\nThere are all sorts of different things.\n\n370\n00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,930\nContract negotiations and stuff,\nthat gets in the way of cost.\n\n371\n00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,690\nSo we have a lot of tools and\ntechniques to help account for that.\n\n372\n00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,850\nSome of these we've already seen.\n\n373\n00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,730\nRight, expert judgement,\nwe already know that one.\n\n374\n00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,860\nAnalogous estimate.\n\n375\n00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,390\nAnalogous estimating, just to refresh\nbecause we saw this with the schedule,\n\n376\n00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,140\nis I need to find out how much\nsomething is going to cost.\n\n377\n00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,560\nI can look at my other projects, and\n\n378\n00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,840\nsee if somebody else has\nalready done what I'm doing.\n\n379\n00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,300\nAnd if they have I can find out what\nit cost them and just use that, right?\n\n380\n00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,460\nI know I need to rent a flat bed truck for\nthree days.\n\n381\n00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,900\nLet me go look at some\nof these other projects.\n\n382\n00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,660\nDid anybody rent a flat bed truck?\n\n383\n00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,080\nOh sure, here's somebody.\n\n384\n00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,300\nHow much did they pay?\n\n385\n00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,897\nLet's use that for my estimate, right.\n\n386\n00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,820\nNow if it's an old project,\n\n387\n00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,970\nif enough time has passed, those\nnumbers might not be accurate anymore.\n\n388\n00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,200\nBut at least it gives us a basis to start\non, and then we can start reaching out and\n\n389\n00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200\ngetting some quotes, right?\n\n390\n00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,770\nThat's where analogous\nestimating comes in handy.\n\n391\n00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,230\nThe positive is,\n\n392\n00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,290\nit gives you a pretty accurate result\nin a very short amount of time.\n\n393\n00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,460\nIt's very fast.\nVery low labor intensive to come\n\n394\n00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,210\nup with this estimate.\n\n395\n00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,590\nOn a negative side, it kind of\nassumes that you have historical data,\n\n396\n00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,830\nyou have other projects that you worked\non, or that you're dealing with a third\n\n397\n00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,484\nparty who's sharing that\ninformation with you, all right.\n\n398\n00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:01,551\nIf you don't have those,\nyou can't use an analogous estimate.\n\n399\n00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:02,242\nIt's not gonna help you.\n\n400\n00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,690\nAll right.\nYou can go on the Internet, but\n\n401\n00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,335\nall the numbers on\nthe Internet are BS anyway.\n\n402\n00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:07,562\n[LAUGH] So you go on there and\nsomebody says, yeah,\n\n403\n00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:09,798\nwe deployed Linux across\nour entire scoreboard.\n\n404\n00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,130\nIt cost $5!\n\n405\n00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,060\nAnd then you find out,\nyeah it cost $5, but\n\n406\n00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,710\nthen they spent $20,000 in\nhardware cost or whatever.\n\n407\n00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,184\nThere's always these extra things\nthat they never mention so\n\n408\n00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:25,541\nwe do have to be careful with analogous\nestimating, if it's even an option.\n\n409\n00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,898\nParametric estimating.\n\n410\n00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:33,000\nThis one is also fairly accurate, but\nit does make some other assumptions.\n\n411\n00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,602\nWith parametric estimating,\nwhat we're doing here is saying,\n\n412\n00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:39,952\nI don't know the numbers, so\nI'm gonna pay somebody else.\n\n413\n00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:43,101\nI'm gonna pay somebody else, either a\nthird party entity, who just comes in and\n\n414\n00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:45,370\nthey have that information\ntogether already.\n\n415\n00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,430\nOr more commonly, I'm gonna get\nsome kind of a software package.\n\n416\n00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,700\nSome kind of a software package\nlike Timberline for construction\n\n417\n00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,860\nthat I can plug in my data, and\nit will generate the cost estimate for me.\n\n418\n00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,140\nThe cost of the materials, it'll even\nput a little reserve in there for\n\n419\n00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,260\nfluctuations in pricing,\nthe cost for labor, and so on.\n\n420\n00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,090\nI'm getting my estimates from statistical\ndata gathered by a third party, and\n\n421\n00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,795\neither presented to me directly or through\nthe use of some kind of software, right.\n\n422\n00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,440\nThat's what parametric estimating is.\n\n423\n00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,610\nIt's rarely free, and so\nit almost always costs money.\n\n424\n00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,780\nAnd it almost always\nrequires a subscription.\n\n425\n00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,880\nThis is data that is constantly changing.\n\n426\n00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,220\nSo if you're using parametric data\nfrom a year ago, it's out of date.\n\n427\n00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,460\nYou're not gonna get\na very accurate result.\n\n428\n00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,250\nSo when you sign up like this, there's\nusually a monthly fee that you're having\n\n429\n00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,780\nto pay to keep subscribed so\nyou have the latest data.\n\n430\n00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,462\nAgain, not something that may be\na available for a small company,\n\n431\n00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:42,974\nbut for\na large company it can be a necessity.\n\n432\n00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,925\nAll right, bottom up estimating.\n\n433\n00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:50,841\nBottom up estimating is a technique that\nwe use when we have no idea what the cost\n\n434\n00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:53,000\nof our project is going to be.\n\n435\n00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,390\nSo here I am looking at this\nwork break down structure.\n\n436\n00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,070\nThis layout of all the different\nactivities that need to be completed as\n\n437\n00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,940\npart of my project, and\nI don't know how much it's going to cost.\n\n438\n00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,062\nSo I need to create one big, fat number\nthat represents the amount of money I'm\n\n439\n00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:07,800\ngoing to come out of pocket\nto finish this project.\n\n440\n00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,300\nBut instead of looking at big picture and\n\n441\n00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,760\ntrying to figure it out,\nwe go to our work breakdown structure.\n\n442\n00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,130\nAnd we go to the bottom level of that work\nbreakdown structure where the individual\n\n443\n00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,480\nwork packages are.\n\n444\n00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,950\nAnd we estimate each\nof those individually.\n\n445\n00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,870\nBy coming up with a cost by\nthe bottom level activities\n\n446\n00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,600\nwe can add that together and now we\nknow what the big cost is, all right.\n\n447\n00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,670\nIt's also called cost aggregation\nwhich we don't see here on this.\n\n448\n00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,890\nBut you'll see that terminology\nwhen you're reading books.\n\n449\n00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,420\nYou take all these individual entities,\nyou add them together,\n\n450\n00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,710\nnow you've got your total cost.\n\n451\n00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,538\nThis is one of the most accurate forms of\nestimating because you're addressing each\n\n452\n00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:49,414\nactivity individually, and\nyou can get quotes from experts in each\n\n453\n00:21:49,414 --> 00:21:52,770\nindividual one, so\nit works out really well.\n\n454\n00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,243\nBut it's also the most time and\nlabor intensive.\n\n455\n00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:58,210\nIt's a lot of work to go out and\nget all of those quotes.\n\n456\n00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,790\nYou have got to reach\nout to each individual,\n\n457\n00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,530\nyou've got to find subject matter experts.\n\n458\n00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,597\nIt really is a burden, and so that's one\nthat we use as kind of a last ditch,\n\n459\n00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:11,117\nsaying, hey I guess I have nothing else,\nI don't have any analogous or parametric\n\n460\n00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:15,315\ndata to use, so I'm just going to figure\nthis out myself let's go this way and\n\n461\n00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:16,890\nwe total from the bottom up.\n\n462\n00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,094\nAll right.\n\n463\n00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:21,399\nSo those are three that\nwe've already seen,\n\n464\n00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:24,790\nwe saw those with schedule just\nmoney now instead of time.\n\n465\n00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,325\nAnd same thing with this next one,\nthree point estimating.\n\n466\n00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:30,693\nThree point estimating,\nyou'll remember, actually hang on,\n\n467\n00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:32,600\nyou've got this in your notes,\nthe formula.\n\n468\n00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,696\nIt's not a crazy complex formula or\nanything, but let's see if I can find it.\n\n469\n00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:38,670\nHere we go.\n\n470\n00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,980\nWith three point estimating,\nthis is where we have our quotes.\n\n471\n00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,030\nWe go out and we get quotes from\ndifferent people, or from one person.\n\n472\n00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,820\nWe know that one person.\n\n473\n00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,540\nWe say we're gonna build this house.\n\n474\n00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,610\nOr I need to purchase wood.\n\n475\n00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,860\nWhat is the best case scenario price.\n\n476\n00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,350\nWhat's the worse case scenario price and\nwhat's the most likely or\n\n477\n00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,940\nthe normal price, okay.\n\n478\n00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,270\nAnd they'll give me those three estimates.\n\n479\n00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,560\nWe then feed that through a very simple\nformula to generate a result and\n\n480\n00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,730\nthat result tells us what\nwe're most likely to pay.\n\n481\n00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,660\nSo, the formula,\nagain we covered this in schedule,\n\n482\n00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,450\nbut just to refresh us in case you skipped\nthat episode for some reason, is that,\n\n483\n00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,550\nif we want to do the triangular\ndistribution which is not as accurate.\n\n484\n00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,860\nYou basically take your optimistic value,\nyour most likely value, and\n\n485\n00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,320\nyour pessimistic value,\n\n486\n00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,560\nyou add them together and divide them\nby three effectively averaging them.\n\n487\n00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,790\nAnd you take the average and\nthat's the number that you act on.\n\n488\n00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,420\nTo make it a little bit more accurate\nthough, because the optimistic or\n\n489\n00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,700\nthe pessimistic might be outliers.\n\n490\n00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,550\nThey might be massively,\nway off from what the most likely is.\n\n491\n00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,390\nWe may choose to do a beta distribution.\n\n492\n00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,232\nAnd this is the way\nthat I normally see it.\n\n493\n00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:52,799\nI don't think I've ever done\ntriangular in production but\n\n494\n00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,758\nthe beta distribution\nis what I normally do.\n\n495\n00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:59,276\nAnd that's where we take our\noptimistic and our pessimistic, and\n\n496\n00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:01,380\nwe add them to our most likely.\n\n497\n00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,220\nBut we multiply the most likely by four.\n\n498\n00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,150\nThat assigns a heavier\nweight to the most likely.\n\n499\n00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,130\nIt makes it count for more.\n\n500\n00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,900\nAnd then we divide it by six again,\ntaking the average, all right.\n\n501\n00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,405\nThis makes sure that an outlier on\nyour pessimistic or an outlier on your\n\n502\n00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:22,452\noptimistic doesn't sway your estimate\nin a way that's negative, all right.\n\n503\n00:24:22,452 --> 00:24:25,900\nIf you've never seen that before jump back\nto the schedule management episodes cuz\n\n504\n00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,264\nwe've worked through a few of them and\ndo the math on it and\n\n505\n00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:29,820\ngive you a chance to see it.\n\n506\n00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,480\nThe only difference is in that\nepisode we were talking about days,\n\n507\n00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,690\nnow we're talking about dollars.\n\n508\n00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,443\nSo other than that it's\nthe exact same concept.\n\n509\n00:24:39,718 --> 00:24:41,883\nAll right, so as far as that goes,\n\n510\n00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:46,310\nnot really seeing anything new here,\nsame stuff that we use.\n\n511\n00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,120\nReserve analysis, again, same things.\n\n512\n00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,950\nWe're about to see our deviation,\nbut up to this point,\n\n513\n00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,350\nit's all pretty much the same.\n\n514\n00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,422\nReserve analysis, this is where we\njust look at what's being done, and\n\n515\n00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:56,555\nwe say, all right,\n\n516\n00:24:56,555 --> 00:25:01,120\nwhich of these estimates do we have where\nthe error rate might be a little higher.\n\n517\n00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,190\nWhich of these have the most unknowns?\n\n518\n00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,410\nAnd in those scenarios we may need\nto build in a cash reserve, right?\n\n519\n00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:13,000\nJust like with schedule though, we need\nto be very, very transparent about that.\n\n520\n00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,150\nWhen we create our budget\nif we quote one number for\n\n521\n00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:20,209\nour budget for the project,\nthat needs to include the reserve.\n\n522\n00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:24,498\nAnd the reserve should be clearly\nnoted that, hey, my project is a $1\n\n523\n00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:29,087\nmillion project, and I've got\n$50,000 in reserves built into it.\n\n524\n00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:32,280\n>> So that should be clearly\nnoted as a budget item.\n\n525\n00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,460\nAnd that way when people\nlook at the project,\n\n526\n00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,200\nthey know, hey, it's $1 million project,\nbut they only expect to pay $950,000.\n\n527\n00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,340\nIt's only if something goes wrong that\nthey have to tap into this other $50,000.\n\n528\n00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,950\nWe wanna make sure that's out there,\nbecause, excuse me,\n\n529\n00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,480\npeople need to know when things\nare going wrong, when something,\n\n530\n00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,090\nwhen we're tapping into that reserve.\n\n531\n00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,250\nHopefully we don't have to, but\nif we are that, then we know it's there.\n\n532\n00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,290\nBut the other thing is to avoid\nthe appearance of impropriety.\n\n533\n00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:03,828\nThat $50,000 is sitting there earmarked\nfor trouble days, right, rainy days.\n\n534\n00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:08,420\nWe don't wanna be tapping into that\nto offset things that are mistakes or\n\n535\n00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,970\nwhatever that were made on our part.\n\n536\n00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,210\nSo we need to be very transparent\nabout those reserves.\n\n537\n00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,880\nHow much do you need in reserves?\n\n538\n00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,620\nWell, there's no one size\nfits all formula here.\n\n539\n00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,150\nIt comes down to the error\nrate of your calculations.\n\n540\n00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,744\nIf you get quote from somebody,\nand you have your pessimistic and\n\n541\n00:26:23,744 --> 00:26:27,340\nyour optimistic and your most likely,\nand you start to look at these numbers.\n\n542\n00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,100\nAnd the number you come up with\nin your estimate is way off\n\n543\n00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,010\nfrom what your most likely is, instead of\nflagging that as the actual budget for\n\n544\n00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,470\nthat item, you might choose\nto specify that as a reserve.\n\n545\n00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,050\nOkay, let me give you an example.\n\n546\n00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,950\nI know I said refer to the other episode,\nbut I'm gonna do an example anyway.\n\n547\n00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,930\nSo let's say I go out and\nI get a quote from somebody, and\n\n548\n00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,470\nthey tell me the optimistic,\nthe best case scenario for\n\n549\n00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,360\nthis thing, in fact,\nlet me write it that way.\n\n550\n00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,990\nThe best case scenario is going to be that\n\n551\n00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,910\nthis particular activity is\ngonna cost me $250, all right?\n\n552\n00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,153\nThey tell me that most likely\n\n553\n00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,559\nit's gonna cost me around $500, okay.\n\n554\n00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:23,561\nBut if workers go on strike,\nif political events occur,\n\n555\n00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:28,562\nif who knows what goes on,\nthen our worst-case\n\n556\n00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:34,206\nscenario is that it could\ncost as much as $1000.\n\n557\n00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:35,645\nRight, no, let's see if we can go higher.\n\n558\n00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:38,221\nLet's just say it's $1500.\n\n559\n00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:41,040\nAll right, so that would be my\nworst case scenario, all right?\n\n560\n00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,830\nSo I then feed that into my formula,\nthe optimistic\n\n561\n00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:51,720\nplus the most likely, times four,\n\n562\n00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,480\nplus the pessimistic,\nall divided by six, right?\n\n563\n00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,100\nThat's that basic formula for\ndoing the beta distribution.\n\n564\n00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,260\nSo we feed that in here.\n\n565\n00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,342\nOptimistic is 250\n\n566\n00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:13,970\n+ (500 x 4) + 1500.\n\n567\n00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,057\nAll right, and\nthen we're going to divide all that by 6.\n\n568\n00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:20,780\nAll right, so let's work this in our head.\n\n569\n00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,907\nSo that's-\n>> 3750.\n\n570\n00:28:22,907 --> 00:28:29,524\n>> All right, so 3750 divided by 6,\nwhich I don't know.\n\n571\n00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,920\nSo let's just get our old calculator up.\n\n572\n00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,773\nWe're exceeding my education level here.\n\n573\n00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:40,769\nSo 3,750 divide by 6 is 625, okay.\n\n574\n00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:44,087\nSo I get a quote.\n\n575\n00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:46,278\nI get multiple quotes, and\nthen I average this out.\n\n576\n00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,109\nAnd I come up with 625 for\nmy beta distribution.\n\n577\n00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:54,750\nOkay, I could run with 625 as my budget.\n\n578\n00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,670\nAll right, I could budget 625.\n\n579\n00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:02,650\nBut when I look at this budget,\nI know the most likely is 500, okay.\n\n580\n00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:09,350\nThis 625, that's over 20% higher\nthan the most likely, okay?\n\n581\n00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,780\nSo, do I want to just incorporate that\nin knowing that I could be 20% off?\n\n582\n00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,994\nWell, I need to go back and\nlook at my cost management plan.\n\n583\n00:29:16,994 --> 00:29:18,400\nWhat does it say in there?\n\n584\n00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,510\nIn the cost management plan,\nam I allowed to be this far off, right?\n\n585\n00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,970\nRemember back here in\nthe cost management plan,\n\n586\n00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,280\nwe have level of accuracy and\ncontrol thresholds.\n\n587\n00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,520\nMaybe we have in there that our\nestimates need to be plus or minus 5%.\n\n588\n00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,669\nWell, the number that I\njust got right here is over\n\n589\n00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:42,655\n20% off from my most likely scenario.\n\n590\n00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:47,245\nThis may exceed the control threshold\nthat we've got designated in\n\n591\n00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,575\nour cost management plan.\n\n592\n00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:54,071\nAnd if that's the case,\nwe'll need to list this\n\n593\n00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:59,590\nas estimate $500, reserve $125.\n\n594\n00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,490\nThat way we're being very transparent.\n\n595\n00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:07,420\nWe're acting with that 625 that we came\nup with from the beta distribution,\n\n596\n00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,900\nbut people know that this\nis what we expect to pay.\n\n597\n00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,120\nWe expect to pay 500.\n\n598\n00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,610\nThat's our most likely.\n\n599\n00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,575\nBut now we've got that\nreserve built in of 125.\n\n600\n00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:17,875\nWe stick that in our reserve funds, and\n\n601\n00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:21,760\nwe specify under what conditions\nthat money is accessible.\n\n602\n00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,889\nYou might have $50,000 in that reserve\nfund, and this is just $125 of it.\n\n603\n00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:31,376\nBut you put in that reserve note when\nyou designate the reserve budget,\n\n604\n00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:36,635\nyou specify this $125 is earmarked for\nthis one activity.\n\n605\n00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:40,215\nIf this one activity goes over,\nhere's $125 for it.\n\n606\n00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:44,680\nIf some other activity goes over,\nthis $125 is not for that, right?\n\n607\n00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,856\nIt cannot be touched for that.\n\n608\n00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:47,810\nSo you're designating it and\nbeing very clear and\n\n609\n00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,590\ntransparent about what that\nreserve analysis is for.\n\n610\n00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,000\nAnd in your documentation,\nyou put this formula.\n\n611\n00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,770\nAnd you say, here's how I came up with it.\n\n612\n00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,530\nI got these three quotes, and\n\n613\n00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,380\nbased on these three quotes, the worst\ncase scenario was really far off.\n\n614\n00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,140\nSo, I felt the need to do\na beta distribution and\n\n615\n00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,090\ncome up with a reserve to put in there.\n\n616\n00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,970\nHere's how I did it.\n\n617\n00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,760\nI didn't make this up.\n\n618\n00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,450\nI am acting in good faith on the number\nthat I was quoted as the most likely.\n\n619\n00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,710\nBut I'm just putting in\na little safety net.\n\n620\n00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,390\nTransparency is very important.\n\n621\n00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,510\nThat's the way reserve analysis works.\n\n622\n00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,950\nThere's other ways to do it.\n\n623\n00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,350\nIf you talk to any accountant,\n\n624\n00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,670\nthey can bend your ears for hours on end\non other ways to calculate out reserves.\n\n625\n00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,930\nBut this is the one that's the easiest and\nthe most likely to show up on the exam.\n\n626\n00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,300\nAll right, well, Ronnie I just noticed\nthat we're out of time on this segment so\n\n627\n00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,420\nwhy don't we stop here and take a break?\n\n628\n00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,360\nAnd when we get back we've got\nsome more tools and techniques.\n\n629\n00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,200\nSo everything we've talked about so\nfar is kind of stuff we've already seen.\n\n630\n00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,705\nSo we're about to move into some\nthat are new, which is exciting.\n\n631\n00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:49,205\n>> Yep.\n>> Right?\n\n632\n00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:49,705\n>> Right.\n\n633\n00:31:49,705 --> 00:31:51,053\n>> All right, well ladies and\n\n634\n00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:53,553\ngentlemen stay tuned.\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n635\n00:31:53,553 --> 00:31:56,759\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n636\n00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:02,196\nwelcome back, everybody.\nSo\n\n637\n00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:06,806\nlet's continue to take a look at the tools\nand techniques of estimating our costs.\n\n638\n00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:08,756\nWe moved through the first six, and\n\n639\n00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:12,336\nthere really wasn't anything new there.\nThese are all things that we saw inside\n\n640\n00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:15,350\nof our schedule plan development also.\n\n641\n00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,910\nSo now let's take a look at some that\nare a little more unique, right?\n\n642\n00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,630\nNumber seven is cost of quality.\n\n643\n00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,600\nCost of quality is a concept\nwhere we make two assumptions.\n\n644\n00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,140\nAnd we're gonna talk about these\nlater in the quality knowledge areas.\n\n645\n00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,390\nBut you deal with quality control and\nquality assurance.\n\n646\n00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,560\nQuality control is where we ensure\nthat things are turned out right\n\n647\n00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,930\nthe first time.\n\n648\n00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,820\nWe make sure we only have to do\nsomething once because it was done right\n\n649\n00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,240\nfrom the beginning.\n\n650\n00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,160\nQuality assurance is where we\ncheck something after the fact,\n\n651\n00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,820\nand we say it's already done,\ndid it get done to our standards?\n\n652\n00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,330\nAnd if not we redo it.\n\n653\n00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,310\nAnd any time you're dealing\nwith numbers in a project\n\n654\n00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,470\nyou're weighing those two ideas.\n\n655\n00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:03,610\nDo I pay money now to prevent\na problem before it happens or\n\n656\n00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,580\ndo I pay money afterwards\nto fix the problem,\n\n657\n00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,600\nhoping that the problem just\ndoesn't happen in the first place?\n\n658\n00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,980\nAnd normally you'll do\na mixture of the two.\n\n659\n00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,560\nYou'll do a mixture of quality control and\nquality assurance.\n\n660\n00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,290\nWell both of those have a cost.\n\n661\n00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,490\nQuality control always has a cost.\n\n662\n00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,300\nYou're putting money in place to\nprevent a problem from occurring.\n\n663\n00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,860\nQuality assurance may or\n\n664\n00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,780\nmay not have a cost because it's dependent\non the problem actually happening, right?\n\n665\n00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,820\nSo if I'm gonna build a house, somebody's\ngotta put up the walls There's a chance\n\n666\n00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,150\nthey can put the wall up wrong, and if\nthey do they're going to have to redo it.\n\n667\n00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,000\nSo do I spend some money\nhiring somebody to go and\n\n668\n00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,800\ncheck the blueprints and stuff before the\nwall goes in to make sure it's done right?\n\n669\n00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,010\nOr, do I just let them put up the wall,\nand pay somebody to come in and check\n\n670\n00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:58,420\nto make sure it's right after the fact,\nand then have them redo it if it's wrong.\n\n671\n00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,589\nAnd Ronnie,\nyou probably remember this building.\n\n672\n00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:04,203\nWe got that wall on the other side of the\nbuilding that one end of the wall is off\n\n673\n00:34:04,203 --> 00:34:05,290\nby about four inches.\n\n674\n00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,940\nIt makes it a diagonal wall.\n\n675\n00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,110\nThat's the kind of mistake\nthat can happen in a building.\n\n676\n00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,390\nIt wasn't supposed to be that way.\n\n677\n00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,820\nIt's just kind of what happened.\n\n678\n00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,210\nSo there is a cost of quality.\n\n679\n00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,970\nAnd the PMI, you know, they actually\nhave a little chart in the PMBOK and\n\n680\n00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,740\nhere we go, which they have\nthe cost of conformance And\n\n681\n00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,670\nthe cost of non-conformance.\n\n682\n00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,310\nThat cost of conformance,\nthat's like quality control,\n\n683\n00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:31,500\nmaking sure that you conform,\nthat you do it right the first time.\n\n684\n00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,760\nAnd then cost of non-conformance\nis If we don't do it right,\n\n685\n00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,360\nwhat's gonna cost to fix it,\nto put it right?\n\n686\n00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,930\nSo under cost of conformance\nit's prevention, right?\n\n687\n00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,890\nPrevention, making sure that things get\ndone right from the beginning, training,\n\n688\n00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,282\ndocumentation, equipment, time and so on.\n\n689\n00:34:48,282 --> 00:34:52,660\nAnd appraisal, testing,\nmaking sure that something works, and\n\n690\n00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,280\ngoing through some experiments.\n\n691\n00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,590\nAnd then nonconformance, rework.\n\n692\n00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,450\nMaybe it's so\nbad you have to scrap it, right?\n\n693\n00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,110\n[LAUGH] Funny story,\n\n694\n00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,300\nthere was a Public's grocery store\nthat was being built here in town.\n\n695\n00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,540\nIt was a long time ago, it's closed now.\n\n696\n00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,250\nBut when they built it They\nbrought in this big crane, and\n\n697\n00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,110\nthey'd put up the four\nwalls to the building.\n\n698\n00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,410\nAnd then they realized they didn't\nhave a way to get the crane out.\n\n699\n00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> They put these\n\n700\n00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,690\nwalls up around the crane,\nand the crane was stuck, and\n\n701\n00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,160\nthey had to tear down one of\nthe walls to get the crane out.\n\n702\n00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,010\nIt was hilarious.\n\n703\n00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,780\nTo us, not to the people on the project.\n\n704\n00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,410\nBut that's a true story right there,\n\n705\n00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,140\nand the crane was stuck inside\nthe building, very funny.\n\n706\n00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,160\nSo in that case, one of the walls\nhad to be completely rebuilt.\n\n707\n00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,880\nThey had to tear the wall down, get the\ncrane out, and then put the wall back up.\n\n708\n00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,440\nSo that's the kind of thing that\nhappens with non-conformance that\n\n709\n00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,780\nobviously costs money.\n\n710\n00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,680\nThey had to buy new bricks.\n\n711\n00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,250\nYou can't tear down brick walls\nwithout breaking a few of them.\n\n712\n00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,970\nAnd so they had to redo that,\nthat increased the cost of the project.\n\n713\n00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,410\nIt was a big mistake.\n\n714\n00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,680\nWhere did that money come from?\n\n715\n00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,920\nDid it come from insurance?\n\n716\n00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,020\nWas it a bonded thing that\ngets covered by insurance?\n\n717\n00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,810\nOr did it have to come directly\nfrom the reserves of the project?\n\n718\n00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,540\nOr did that make the project\nrun over budget and\n\n719\n00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,960\nsomebody had to approve of\nthe expenditure to move forward?\n\n720\n00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,970\nThe money came from somewhere and\n\n721\n00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:12,070\nwe just wanna make sure as project\nmanagers that we try and see that coming.\n\n722\n00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,990\nThat we see instances like\nthese as being possible, and\n\n723\n00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,272\nhave the reserves to be\nable to deal with that.\n\n724\n00:36:17,272 --> 00:36:21,280\nAll right,\nthey also list things like liabilities.\n\n725\n00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,030\nThat if you get a workplace injury, or\nsomething like that during the project.\n\n726\n00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,450\nLost business,\n\n727\n00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,210\nyou see lost business all the time when\nthere is road work that's being done and\n\n728\n00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:35,790\naccess to a building gets cut off,\nthat people do lose money because of that.\n\n729\n00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:39,930\nAs we do projects in our own organization,\nthere might be things where we lose money.\n\n730\n00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,270\nWe'll use IT Pro T.V. as an example.\n\n731\n00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:47,170\nAny time we shut our website down for\nmaintenance, we might be losing customers.\n\n732\n00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,020\nIf somebody tries to come to\nthe site during that time and\n\n733\n00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,528\nsees it's under maintenance they go I'm\nnot gonna sign up with this company,\n\n734\n00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:52,810\nthey're under maintenance.\n\n735\n00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,360\nSo that's the kind of thing\nwe have to watch out for.\n\n736\n00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,750\nSo when we talk about the cost of quality\nwe're talking about exactly that.\n\n737\n00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:06,050\nHow much money do we need to set aside to\neither prevent problems from happening or\n\n738\n00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,890\nto fix the problems once they occur?\n\n739\n00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,400\n>> Right.\n\n740\n00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,850\n>> And we'll see a lot more of\nthat when we get into risk and\n\n741\n00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,750\nthe quality knowledge areas.\n\n742\n00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,765\nAll right,\nour project management software.\n\n743\n00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:18,300\nNow I always thought that was funny.\n\n744\n00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,360\nA lot of project management software\nout there doesn't do budget.\n\n745\n00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,532\n>> Right.\n>> Just doesn't do it, right?\n\n746\n00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:26,560\nGanttproject doesn't do it.\n\n747\n00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,370\nProjectlibre has some really basic stuff.\n\n748\n00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,800\nMicrosoft Project, for\nthe longest time wouldn't do it.\n\n749\n00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,080\nIn the latest versions\nof Microsoft Project,\n\n750\n00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,830\nthey actually have budget functions in\nthere and they don't work very well.\n\n751\n00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,710\nIn fact, Microsoft will even tell you,\nit's here, you can use it for\n\n752\n00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,330\nestimates but\ndon't submit this to the IRS.\n\n753\n00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,960\nDon't use this for\nyour official accounting.\n\n754\n00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,730\nSo we almost always have separate\nsoftware that's being used for\n\n755\n00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,790\nmanaging the finances of our project.\n\n756\n00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,020\nAnd it could be something\nas simple as QuickBooks.\n\n757\n00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,870\nBut it's usually something\nmuch more advanced.\n\n758\n00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,160\nAnd so here where it says\nproject management software,\n\n759\n00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,590\nit might be separate financial software.\n\n760\n00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,190\nIf you're fortunate enough to have\nproject management software that does do\n\n761\n00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:13,780\nthe accounting side, like I think Sage\nactually does the accounting inside of it.\n\n762\n00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,360\nSo if you've got something\nlike that then great.\n\n763\n00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,710\nBut if you don't, then you're\ngonna be doing it somewhere else.\n\n764\n00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,332\nAll right, vendor bid analysis.\n\n765\n00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:27,660\nAll right, now we are gonna get into this\na little more on the procurement knowledge\n\n766\n00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,530\narea when we talk about contracts.\n\n767\n00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:34,600\nBut if you need to buy something, and\nyou put it out for bid, you're going\n\n768\n00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,470\nto get bids back from various sellers,\npeople who want to sell you this product.\n\n769\n00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,520\nHow do you pick?\n\n770\n00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,630\nWell, there's different\ntechniques available, and\n\n771\n00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,250\nit's called vendor bid analysis.\n\n772\n00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,095\nAnd let me just bring up the notes here.\n\n773\n00:38:47,095 --> 00:38:49,230\nCuz I think you listed some\nof these didn't you Ronnie?\n\n774\n00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,730\n>> No I just didn't find it.\n>> No?\n\n775\n00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,780\nAll right, that's fine.\n\n776\n00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,870\nLike I said we're gonna deal more with\nthis under the procurement section.\n\n777\n00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,060\nFor those of you that have\nbeen with the PMI a while\n\n778\n00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,820\nthere used to be something called\nthe select seller process.\n\n779\n00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,250\nAnd so we have this whole\nseller selection process.\n\n780\n00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,370\nKinda dumb way to put it.\n\n781\n00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,450\nBut anyhow,\nwhere you would pick the winning bid.\n\n782\n00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,540\nNow it's been moved up under\nthe procurement section.\n\n783\n00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,990\nSo we're gonna see it a little bit later.\n\n784\n00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,450\nBut basically you need to\nestablish the criteria.\n\n785\n00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,730\nHow do you determine\nwho's the winning bidder?\n\n786\n00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,030\nAnd a lot of people say well,\nit's whoever is cheaper.\n\n787\n00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,660\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n788\n00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,600\nSometimes it's worth it to pay a little\nmore because you get better quality out of\n\n789\n00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,110\nit, you get a faster timeline out of it,\nyou get better support, whatever it is.\n\n790\n00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,290\nSo it doesn't come down to the dollar\nevery time, unless you work for\n\n791\n00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,290\nthe U.S. government.\n\n792\n00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:34,740\nSo for the rest of us,\nthere are outlying factors.\n\n793\n00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,050\nSo how do we make that decision?\n\n794\n00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,470\nAnd that's what they're talking about\nwhen they say vendor bid analysis.\n\n795\n00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,350\nHow do we pick that winner?\n\n796\n00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,440\nWhat is important for our company?\n\n797\n00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,570\nIf you've got a project\nmanagement plan in place,\n\n798\n00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,490\nit's in there how you pick them right?\n\n799\n00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,115\nBut if it isn't, you've got to come\nup with your own solution, and\n\n800\n00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:53,022\nthat becomes a part of\nour cost management plan.\n\n801\n00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:58,322\nAll right, and then we have our\ngroup decision making techniques.\n\n802\n00:39:58,322 --> 00:40:00,508\nAs we get our people together, and\nstart talking about the budgeting,\n\n803\n00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:01,572\nhow we're gonna be able to run it.\n\n804\n00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:05,638\nWe reached to our team,\nour project management team and\n\n805\n00:40:05,638 --> 00:40:10,120\nthe subject matter experts\nthat we've accumulated.\n\n806\n00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,770\nWe gather the information from them and\nput it together.\n\n807\n00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,250\nAny time I get quotes,\nquotes are good, but\n\n808\n00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,650\nI always like to bounce\nthem off of somebody else.\n\n809\n00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,120\nYou know, get somebody and say,\nhey, is this quote in line?\n\n810\n00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,380\nCuz you'll get weird things sometimes.\n\n811\n00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,680\nOne of my favorites, I work in IT,\nI've worked in IT my entire professional\n\n812\n00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,860\ncareer and one of the things I've noticed\nis that when you send out bids on,\n\n813\n00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,060\nbid requests on the internet you'll\nget responses from all over.\n\n814\n00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,445\nAnd a lot of times you'll get responses\nfrom people who've never done\n\n815\n00:40:39,445 --> 00:40:43,935\nwhat you're asking, but they'll send a bid\nin anyways cuz they are willing to do it.\n\n816\n00:40:43,935 --> 00:40:46,305\nAnd so I used to live out in Seattle for\na little while and\n\n817\n00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:49,175\none of my mentors out there,\nhe had this great technique.\n\n818\n00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:53,970\nAny time you send out a software bid,\na request for bid, he would put in there,\n\n819\n00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:58,175\nin the requirements, the software must do\nA, B, and C which were real requirements.\n\n820\n00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:02,590\nAnd then one of the last requirements\nwas he would put in there,\n\n821\n00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:07,060\nmust be able to synchronize\ndata with ToddStar database,\n\n822\n00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,430\nand his name was Todd, and so must be able\nto synchronize data with ToddStar database\n\n823\n00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,620\nand I think he even went very specific,\nlike version 3.7 or something like that.\n\n824\n00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,580\nAnd he would send out this bid and\n\n825\n00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,670\nhe would get responses back,\nactual bids back from the companies.\n\n826\n00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:24,745\nAns a lot of them would say, yes I'm\ncompatible with ToddStar database 3.7.\n\n827\n00:41:24,745 --> 00:41:27,760\nAnd he showed me that,\nand I said why would they\n\n828\n00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,550\nsay they're compatible with\na product that you just made up?\n\n829\n00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,340\nIt's not even a real product, it's just\nsomething made up out of his mind.\n\n830\n00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:37,200\nHe said the reason is, a lot of these\npeople will bid you the work and\n\n831\n00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,376\nthey'll say they're compatible with\nthe product that they're not, and\n\n832\n00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:42,400\nthen once you get going, they'll say, oh,\n\n833\n00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,560\nwe have to do custom development to\nsupport that and your costs go up.\n\n834\n00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,092\nAnd he learned that the hard\nway years before and so\n\n835\n00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,323\nhe built that into his request for\nquotes and\n\n836\n00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:54,716\nthat way he would be able to gauge\nwhether a company was doing that.\n\n837\n00:41:54,716 --> 00:41:58,342\nAnd he knew when they put the a note\nthere, we're unfamiliar with that\n\n838\n00:41:58,342 --> 00:42:02,540\ndatabase, or no that that was a quote\nthat would be a little more accurate.\n\n839\n00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,260\nBut unfortunately in\nthe IT contracting world,\n\n840\n00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,490\na lot of people just\ndon't know the word no.\n\n841\n00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:11,100\nThey'll put whatever they want on that\nquote knowing that they can charge you\n\n842\n00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,120\nextra for additional bill time down the\nrode, it's is not an uncommon practice.\n\n843\n00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,110\nSo, when we have group\ndecision making techniques\n\n844\n00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,030\nthese are the things that come up.\n\n845\n00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:23,090\nWhen we get our groups together, we start\nmaking decisions, you find information for\n\n846\n00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,550\npeople like that and you use that as\npart of your decision making process.\n\n847\n00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,636\nSo yep one of the more entertaining\nanecdotes that I have.\n\n848\n00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:34,266\nAll right, once all that's done, when\nwe've used whatever of these worked for\n\n849\n00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:37,890\nus, and it really is you're just\ngonna pick a couple of these.\n\n850\n00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,820\nBecause if I've got an analogous estimate\nI don't need a parametric estimate,\n\n851\n00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,450\nI don't need a lot of these others.\n\n852\n00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:47,890\nSo we figure out which one's we're going\nto use and then we make our decision.\n\n853\n00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:51,880\nWe find out what our activity\ncost estimate is going to be.\n\n854\n00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,320\nNow notice they say the activity and\nnot the work package.\n\n855\n00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,680\nWhen we did our schedule in\nthe last couple episodes,\n\n856\n00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,860\nwe were scheduling activities and\nnot work packages.\n\n857\n00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,360\nThe difference being that an activity\nis normally going to be following that\n\n858\n00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360\n8-80 rule.\n\n859\n00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,290\nTasks that take more than eight hours but\nless than 80 hours,\n\n860\n00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,150\nnot normally outside of that.\n\n861\n00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,650\nAnd the reason is,\nit's easier to deal with that,\n\n862\n00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,840\neasier to deal with\nthe chunks of time like that.\n\n863\n00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,800\nWell, money is the same way.\n\n864\n00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,650\nYou don't want to micro mange\nyour expenses based on individual\n\n865\n00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,430\nwork packages.\n\n866\n00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,700\nIt might be a one hour package,\nor whatever it's just too much.\n\n867\n00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,594\nSo, by binding this to the schedule we can\ntrack our manage at the same time it's\n\n868\n00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:38,758\ntracking time and that's why these\ngreat charts that show Ttime and\n\n869\n00:43:38,758 --> 00:43:40,970\nmoney represented on the two axes.\n\n870\n00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,174\nIs that the plural for axis, axes?\n\n871\n00:43:43,174 --> 00:43:44,380\n>> Sure.\n\n872\n00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,610\n>> I don't know whatever, axis I.\n\n873\n00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,286\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyhow, we can map time and\n\n874\n00:43:48,286 --> 00:43:51,430\nmoney like that because\nwe've tied them together.\n\n875\n00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:56,096\nSo you want your estimates to be tied\nto the activities in your schedule,\n\n876\n00:43:56,096 --> 00:44:00,838\nwhich in turn are usually aggregates\nof work packages from your work break\n\n877\n00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,000\ndown structure.\n\n878\n00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,190\nAny time you have an estimate, you need\nto document the basis of the estimate.\n\n879\n00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,940\nHow did you come up with that number?\n\n880\n00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,520\nYou should never make a number\nup off the top of your head.\n\n881\n00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,510\nThat's okay back in the charter phase and\n\n882\n00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,310\nas you draft that\noriginal scope statement.\n\n883\n00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,720\nIt's okay to make stuff\nout of your head then, but\n\n884\n00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,390\nby the time we get here to doing\nthe budget, make-up time is over.\n\n885\n00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,550\nThis needs to be real numbers,\nyou need to have quotes to back it up,\n\n886\n00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,090\nor formulas that you did.\n\n887\n00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,600\nYou need to be able to show that math.\n\n888\n00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:34,510\nThat needs to be attached to your\nestimates so that if it goes wrong,\n\n889\n00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:38,480\nif the estimate turns out to be\nwildly inaccurate, you can show why.\n\n890\n00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,560\nYou can show,\nhey this is the information I had,\n\n891\n00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,130\nit was the best available at the time,\nhere's how we reach that decision.\n\n892\n00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,760\nSorry it's higher, but that was\nthe information we had at the time.\n\n893\n00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,710\nIt's still wrong,\nyou still have to deal with it, but\n\n894\n00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,910\nat least people will understand.\n\n895\n00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,755\nIt wasn't malicious, it wasn't ineptitude.\n\n896\n00:44:53,755 --> 00:44:56,690\nYou're only as good as\nthe information that you have.\n\n897\n00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,850\nAnd then lastly, project document updates.\n\n898\n00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:05,510\nIf we don't have a cost management plan,\nwe look at all the tools and\n\n899\n00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,690\ntechniques that we used here and\nwe take that and we put it\n\n900\n00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,610\ninto a cost management plan, which becomes\na part of the project management plan.\n\n901\n00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,570\nSo that there's our project document\nupdates, it goes in there, and\n\n902\n00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,540\nnow we're in business.\n\n903\n00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,900\nAll right, so\nthis is how estimating the cost works.\n\n904\n00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,750\nThat took us, I don't know, maybe half\nan hour here of talking about it.\n\n905\n00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:29,420\nRemember, you're going to do that for\neach and every activity\n\n906\n00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:33,750\nthroughout your entire project and you're\nestimating not just the labor cost but\n\n907\n00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,110\nthe material cost in quantity,\nalso It's a lot of work.\n\n908\n00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,490\nSo, don't think that just because we\ntalk about it in half an hour that\n\n909\n00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,620\nthis is easy and a quick thing.\n\n910\n00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,770\nIt's gonna take a lot of work.\n\n911\n00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:50,188\nYou know, its a lot of nose to\nthe grindstone, figuring that out and\n\n912\n00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:54,100\ngetting these numbers as\naccurate as possible.\n\n913\n00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,250\nAll right, so let's see,\nthat is our estimating cost.\n\n914\n00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,810\nOnce that's done, now we've got\nestimates attached to every activity,\n\n915\n00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,420\nthe rest of this is easy.\n\n916\n00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,470\nNow we create our budget.\n\n917\n00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,690\nNow that we know what each\nactivity is gonna cost,\n\n918\n00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,170\nwe can add all that together and now we\nknow what our project's gonna cost, right?\n\n919\n00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,000\nWell, there's still room for\n\n920\n00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,370\nvariation, but we do, we have a pretty\ngood idea of what our budget is.\n\n921\n00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,310\nAnd that means we're ready to move into,\ndetermine the budget.\n\n922\n00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:26,970\nDetermining the budget is the third\nprocess in the planning cost\n\n923\n00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:29,150\nknowledge area, if I can say it,\n\n924\n00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,090\nand it's got a lot to it, but\nmost of it's pretty straight forward.\n\n925\n00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,550\nThe hard work is done.\n\n926\n00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,560\nSo we start off with our inputs.\n\n927\n00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,330\nWhat are we bringing into this, right?\n\n928\n00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:43,209\nSo on our input side, we're bringing in\nthat cost management plan, if we have one,\n\n929\n00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:44,460\nour scope baseline.\n\n930\n00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,420\nMost of this is what we had on the other\nside, but the main two things that we need\n\n931\n00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,860\nare these guys right here, activity cost\nestimates and basis of the estimates.\n\n932\n00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,080\nWe need those estimates cuz that's\nwhat our budget is gonna come from.\n\n933\n00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,160\nThe rest of these are the same\nas the estimate cost process.\n\n934\n00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,940\nThen we figure out our budget.\n\n935\n00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,210\nThe easiest tool, is this first one,\ncost aggregation.\n\n936\n00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,050\nWe just add up all our estimates right?\n\n937\n00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,520\nSimple addition like we all\nlearned in elementary school and\n\n938\n00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,033\nsupposedly mastered,\nalthough I still have problems with.\n\n939\n00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,729\n[LAUGH] So we add it all together.\n\n940\n00:47:17,729 --> 00:47:23,200\nWhen you have that all added together, now\nyou know the total cost of your project.\n\n941\n00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,520\nAnd since every estimate\nwas based on fact,\n\n942\n00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,700\nthe information you could find, you're\noverall project estimate is pretty good.\n\n943\n00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,950\nIt's a really good estimate.\n\n944\n00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,020\nIt's not gonna be perfect,\nthey never are, right?\n\n945\n00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,038\nSo, we always have to plan for that, but\nif we did we've done our reserve analysis\n\n946\n00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:43,009\nand if you calculated reserve\non every activities you went,\n\n947\n00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:45,880\nnow you add up the reserve amount too,\nand you pop that in.\n\n948\n00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,474\nAnd so you might say, my project\nis $750,000, that's my cost, and\n\n949\n00:47:50,474 --> 00:47:52,748\nI need $200,000 in reserve.\n\n950\n00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:54,031\nBut it's not just,\n\n951\n00:47:54,031 --> 00:47:58,344\nI need a check for 200 grand sitting\non my desk ready to be signed.\n\n952\n00:47:58,344 --> 00:48:01,424\nIt's these activities\nhave these contingencies,\n\n953\n00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:05,130\nhere's when I'll need to\ndraw upon that reserve.\n\n954\n00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,640\nVery black and white.\n\n955\n00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,440\nThat there is no just random drawing for\nthe reserve.\n\n956\n00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,060\nEvery dollar in the reserve\nshould be ear-marked.\n\n957\n00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:17,120\nFor not just a particular activity but\na particular scenario in that activity.\n\n958\n00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,220\nAnd if a different scenario plays out,\n\n959\n00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,290\nthat doesn't mean you can\ntap into that reserve.\n\n960\n00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:25,090\nYou need to do a change ticket and\nsay well, the money's in the reserve.\n\n961\n00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,120\nIt was ear-marked for this result.\n\n962\n00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,300\nWe got an unexpected result so\n\n963\n00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,380\nI want to submit a change ticket\nto allow me to draw that funding.\n\n964\n00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,240\nThe change ticket will either\nget approved or denied.\n\n965\n00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,850\nIf it's denied money stays in\nthe reserve and you're out of luck.\n\n966\n00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,320\nIf it gets approved you draw the money\nfrom the reserve and you go.\n\n967\n00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,870\nBut that helps us to\nprevent any improprieties.\n\n968\n00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,130\nRight?\nThat it is shown the money goes in and\n\n969\n00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,664\nout of the reserve based\non what we specified.\n\n970\n00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:51,560\nAll right.\n\n971\n00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,440\nSo that's where reserve\nanalysis comes back in.\n\n972\n00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,430\nWe're not doing some overall\ngeneric padding or whatever,\n\n973\n00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,130\nwe're just doing an aggregate of the\nreserves that we've already calculated.\n\n974\n00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:07,240\nNow, I do know some projects where\nonce they get that total number,\n\n975\n00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,440\nthen they add 10% more, or whatever.\n\n976\n00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,510\nYou can do that.\n\n977\n00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,940\nTechnically, it's against\nour code of ethics though.\n\n978\n00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,360\nOn the exam, you don't do that.\n\n979\n00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,400\nUnless it's clearly\ndesignated what you're doing.\n\n980\n00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,850\nHey, I'm padding these numbers by 10%.\n\n981\n00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,430\nOtherwise our estimates,\n\n982\n00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,590\nthey really need to be true accurate\nestimates of what's gonna be done.\n\n983\n00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,829\nReserve needs to be clearly\ndenoted as reserve.\n\n984\n00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,310\nAll right.\n\n985\n00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:33,910\nOther things.\n\n986\n00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,070\nExpert judgment.\n\n987\n00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,340\nUse our brains, right?\n\n988\n00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,390\nThat's why we get paid.\n\n989\n00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,750\nSo, just basically evaluating these,\n\n990\n00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,090\nputting the information together,\nmaking 1 plus 1 equal 2.\n\n991\n00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,360\nHistorical relationships.\n\n992\n00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,280\nThis is a good one because it's kind\nof like the analogous estimating.\n\n993\n00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,650\nThat if we're about to move\ninto various cost things,\n\n994\n00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:57,290\nif we're purchasing materials and so on,\nwe probably already have relationships\n\n995\n00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:01,100\nwith various vendors and a lot of\ntimes those can result in discounts.\n\n996\n00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:01,620\n>> Right.\n\n997\n00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,860\n>> So I used to get this all the time,\n\n998\n00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,872\nwhere we would buy computer\nequipment from CDW.\n\n999\n00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:10,370\nCDW is a big computer and electronics\ndealer here in the United States.\n\n1000\n00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,780\nI think they're all over the world.\n\n1001\n00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:16,040\nBut the more you buy from them,\nthe bigger discount you get.\n\n1002\n00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,180\nAnd so we would go and get quotes.\n\n1003\n00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,460\nAnd the quotes were based off of\nwhat we had done at that time and\n\n1004\n00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,720\nthe values that they would quote us.\n\n1005\n00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,260\nBut when we went to place the order.\n\n1006\n00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,080\nIf the order was a $60,000 order or\nwhatever.\n\n1007\n00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,580\nWe would get a discount on that.\n\n1008\n00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:34,060\nAnd so our historical\nrelationship affected that quote,\n\n1009\n00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,330\naffected the overall budget even.\n\n1010\n00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:40,310\nKnowing that history, knowing that\nbackground of people you purchase from,\n\n1011\n00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,790\ncontractors that you use,\n\n1012\n00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:45,520\nthings like that, are going to\ninfluence your ultimate budget.\n\n1013\n00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,190\nSo be aware of those, don't discount that.\n\n1014\n00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,530\nIt does make a difference.\n\n1015\n00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,770\nAnd then number five is\nthe funding limit reconciliation.\n\n1016\n00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:56,950\nThis is a weird one.\n\n1017\n00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,760\nThis is one that I always say, I ended up\njust having to memorize before the exam\n\n1018\n00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,630\nbecause it doesn't in my mind,\nthose terms don't fit together.\n\n1019\n00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:10,670\nFunding limit reconciliation says, if you\nhave a budget of x amount of dollars,\n\n1020\n00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,760\nover time you're supposed to\nspend that amount of money..\n\n1021\n00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,740\nSo we need to reconcile\nour budget to time.\n\n1022\n00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,890\nAnd it is a concept that in my mind just\ndoesn't quite click so I made a chart.\n\n1023\n00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:25,280\nLet me bring this up.\n\n1024\n00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,390\nCost baseline.\n\n1025\n00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,030\nI call it a cost baseline\ncuz that's how I use it.\n\n1026\n00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:33,660\nBut basically what you do is, if you\nknow what your costs are going to be,\n\n1027\n00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,305\nyou can bring up.\n\n1028\n00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:36,360\n>> [LAUGH] I was worried for a second.\n\n1029\n00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,970\nYou can bring up this\ncompletely blank spreadsheet.\n\n1030\n00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,690\nYou can bring up a chart and\n\n1031\n00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:46,960\nyou can plot what your\nexpenses are going to be.\n\n1032\n00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,960\nSo, here I am planning my budget and in my\nbudget of this project, I come through and\n\n1033\n00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,825\nI put on this date, I have an activity.\n\n1034\n00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:55,815\nThat's gonna cost me $1,200.\n\n1035\n00:51:55,815 --> 00:51:59,745\nAnd on this date I have an activity\nthat's gonna cost me 750.\n\n1036\n00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:01,765\nAnd I lay it out like this.\n\n1037\n00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:06,170\nLaying out each activity, see how I've\ngot the activities noted right here.\n\n1038\n00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,220\nAnd what they're going to cost.\n\n1039\n00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:12,725\nSo now, I have a running total,\nand here is my cost.\n\n1040\n00:52:12,725 --> 00:52:14,520\n$36,880, right?\n\n1041\n00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,538\nThat's how much this project\nis going to cost me.\n\n1042\n00:52:16,538 --> 00:52:17,864\nSo there we go.\n\n1043\n00:52:17,864 --> 00:52:19,861\nI know I need $37,000.\n\n1044\n00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:20,860\nLet me go get a check right now for\n$37,000.\n\n1045\n00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,750\nFirst off, that's not going to happen.\n\n1046\n00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,970\nBut secondly it's not\nthat I need it right now.\n\n1047\n00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,410\nSome of the cost yeah, some of the costs\nare right away May 20th, right?\n\n1048\n00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:33,030\nBut other costs are way\ndown the road here.\n\n1049\n00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,125\nSeptember 3rd.\n\n1050\n00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:36,465\n$9,000.\nThat's a pretty big percent.\n\n1051\n00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:37,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What is that?\n\n1052\n00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,880\n25% of my budget I don't even need for\nthree more months.\n\n1053\n00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,210\nI guess maybe two.\n\n1054\n00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,750\nI don't know, three months, whatever.\n\n1055\n00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,200\nWay down the road.\n\n1056\n00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,780\nIf I take that money now,\nwhat am I gonna do with it?\n\n1057\n00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,770\nI can stick it in a bank account,\nmaybe draw some interest on it.\n\n1058\n00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,870\nOr my company could continue to use that.\n\n1059\n00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,700\nMy company might not have that money yet,\nbut my company may know that\n\n1060\n00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:02,700\nsales in August will cover the $9,000\nthat we need to spend in September.\n\n1061\n00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,120\nSo, they may not have that money yet.\n\n1062\n00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,610\nIf I go and ask for it,\nthey may not have it to give it to me.\n\n1063\n00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:13,010\nSo what we have to do is a reconciliation,\nwhere we tie the money to the date.\n\n1064\n00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,800\nAnd I usually make a chart like this.\n\n1065\n00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:22,440\nAnd what this chart does is it shows\nthe money that I need on particular dates.\n\n1066\n00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,110\nAnd so I can see right here,\nI need $17,800 on July 12th.\n\n1067\n00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:27,670\nRight?\nAnd\n\n1068\n00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,470\nthat's just coming from right here on\nJuly 12th, $17,000, half my budget.\n\n1069\n00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:35,120\nHalf my budget I need right\nthere on July 12th, okay?\n\n1070\n00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,290\nAnd then I plot that with another line,\n\n1071\n00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:41,670\nwhich is my total,\nthe total that I've spent.\n\n1072\n00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,120\nSo my project as a whole yes.\n\n1073\n00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,420\nIt is $36,880.\n\n1074\n00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,290\nBut on day one I only need 1,200 bucks.\n\n1075\n00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,290\nAnd by the time I get to the end of the\nfirst month so if I started on May 20th.\n\n1076\n00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:58,140\nBy the time I get to end of June,\nI only need a total of $6,080.\n\n1077\n00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:05,360\nSo I need a small fraction, less than\n20% of my budget by the first month.\n\n1078\n00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,530\nBut that second month, boy it's a doozy.\n\n1079\n00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:12,380\nI need another 50% of my budget\nright there just in July.\n\n1080\n00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,100\nBut then August very few expenditures,\nright.\n\n1081\n00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,540\nLooks like I got a total\nof $4,000 in August and\n\n1082\n00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,870\nthen it's in September\nthat we jump up to $9,000.\n\n1083\n00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:24,600\nSo by reconciling our\nexpenses to dates like this.\n\n1084\n00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,370\nWe can set not just what\nour total budget is but\n\n1085\n00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:30,770\nwhat our budget is at\npoints along the way.\n\n1086\n00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:34,180\nAnd that's important when we get\nto monitoring and controlling.\n\n1087\n00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,860\nBecause when you're monitoring\nyour project you can say here I\n\n1088\n00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,620\nam on June 15th.\n\n1089\n00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,890\nHow much money should I have spent?\n\n1090\n00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:41,090\n>> Yeah.\n>> On June 15th and\n\n1091\n00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:43,520\nI can look\n>> And I can say all right.\n\n1092\n00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,120\nAccording to this chart, by June 15th,\nI should have spent $6,080.\n\n1093\n00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,270\nHow much have I actually spent.\n\n1094\n00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,550\nOh, I've spent $6,080.\n\n1095\n00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,150\nI'm perfect.\n\n1096\n00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:51,830\nOn schedule.\n\n1097\n00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,480\nRight.\n\n1098\n00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,774\nWhere I look at it and\nI've only spent $5,000.\n\n1099\n00:54:55,774 --> 00:54:58,800\nWhy is that?\nWhy have I only spent $5,000?\n\n1100\n00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,570\n>> Did some work not get done\nthat was supposed to get done?\n\n1101\n00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,160\nRight?\n\n1102\n00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,340\nOr maybe I got a great deal on some\nlumber or something like that and\n\n1103\n00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,710\nthat's why we haven't spent so much.\n\n1104\n00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:09,400\nMore often than not,\nit means something didn't get done.\n\n1105\n00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,075\nOr I can say I spent $7.000.\n\n1106\n00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:12,835\nWhy the discrepancy?\n\n1107\n00:55:12,835 --> 00:55:14,635\nWhy have I spent more at this point?\n\n1108\n00:55:14,635 --> 00:55:17,385\nNow they're numbers that are very,\nvery useful.\n\n1109\n00:55:17,385 --> 00:55:20,865\nSo attaching these to a date is really\nhandy and I usually just use Excel.\n\n1110\n00:55:20,865 --> 00:55:22,535\nThis is just something that I whipped up.\n\n1111\n00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:25,350\nYou know in Excel you can lay\nout a chart like this and\n\n1112\n00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:29,250\nthen you can do an easy\ngraph right in here.\n\n1113\n00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,770\nIf I pull it up you'll see...\n\n1114\n00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:33,150\nThat's not what I wanted.\n\n1115\n00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,950\nHow do you edit the formula?\n\n1116\n00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,760\nI'm the one who made this thing.\n\n1117\n00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,000\nYou'd think I'd know how to do it.\n\n1118\n00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,110\nSomewhere in here we designate exactly\nhow we want this chart to function.\n\n1119\n00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,460\nSelect Data.\n\n1120\n00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,600\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n1121\n00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,581\nSo you come in here and you specify\nyour x and your y values, right.\n\n1122\n00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,925\nSo, this is where it's doing cost and\ntotal and the range of sales.\n\n1123\n00:55:54,925 --> 00:55:56,690\nIt's not a hard thing to build.\n\n1124\n00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:00,289\nI probably used a wizard to do it.\n\n1125\n00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:02,286\nYou'll see all the Crazy wizards up here.\n\n1126\n00:56:02,286 --> 00:56:03,775\nBut you do it, you lay it out,\nand this really works.\n\n1127\n00:56:03,775 --> 00:56:07,960\nThis is a great way to determine\nhow your budget is doing.\n\n1128\n00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,920\nSo that is a cost baseline.\n\n1129\n00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,730\nAnd again, your baseline,\nthis is how it is in planning.\n\n1130\n00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,060\nSo now when you get into production,\n\n1131\n00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:20,290\nyou're gonna actually have a third\nline that I don't have in here.\n\n1132\n00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:24,640\nSo I would add another column to this,\nwhich was the actual.\n\n1133\n00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,920\nAnd so\nI would track my actual expenditures,\n\n1134\n00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,230\nwhich would be somewhere in between these,\nright?\n\n1135\n00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:32,380\nWith where we're at for\nour expenses and hopefully,\n\n1136\n00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,670\nit's right on top of this red line.\n\n1137\n00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:37,330\nBut anywhere above the red line,\nI'd be over budget.\n\n1138\n00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:40,674\nAnywhere below the red\nline I'm under budget, and\n\n1139\n00:56:40,674 --> 00:56:43,797\nthen I can make that decision,\nhow to fix that.\n\n1140\n00:56:43,797 --> 00:56:47,960\nAll right, so\nthat is funding limit reconciliation.\n\n1141\n00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,420\nReally important there, very useful stuff.\n\n1142\n00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,170\nIf you don't do it now,\n\n1143\n00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:54,730\nyou're gonna end up doing it later anyway\nwhen we do the monitoring and controlling.\n\n1144\n00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,130\nSo you might as well do it\nnow as you set up that plan.\n\n1145\n00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,760\nAnd when we're done?\n\n1146\n00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,300\nWhat do we get?\n\n1147\n00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,790\nWell we get a handful of other things,\nright?\n\n1148\n00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:04,460\nWe get our outputs, our cost baseline,\n\n1149\n00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:09,190\nwhich my funding limit reconciliation,\nI call that my cost baseline.\n\n1150\n00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,800\nIt may be done as a graph and a chart like\nthat, that's the way I normally do it.\n\n1151\n00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,616\nOr you might have some kind of form, some\nspreadsheet or whatever that you fill out,\n\n1152\n00:57:16,616 --> 00:57:17,492\nbut I like charts.\n\n1153\n00:57:17,492 --> 00:57:19,815\n[LAUGH] It's hard to\nargue against a chart.\n\n1154\n00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,219\nWhen you show somebody a chart,\nthey think you know what you're doing.\n\n1155\n00:57:21,219 --> 00:57:21,729\n>> Love it.\n\n1156\n00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:26,955\n>> [LAUGH] So they're like, oh, this guy\nmade a chart, don't wanna argue with that.\n\n1157\n00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:28,715\nProject funding requirements.\n\n1158\n00:57:28,715 --> 00:57:32,212\nThis is how much money do I need and\nwhen do I need it, right?\n\n1159\n00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:34,606\nThis is something your\naccounting team wants to know,\n\n1160\n00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:36,720\nthis is something your CEO wants to know.\n\n1161\n00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,410\nThis is how they recognize the money they\nneed to set aside to support this project.\n\n1162\n00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,005\nAnd they also know if\nthey choke your project,\n\n1163\n00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:46,570\ncuz this happens with\nthe government all the time.\n\n1164\n00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:52,320\nThey'll allocate $2 billion for a project\nand the project kicks off, it moves along.\n\n1165\n00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,420\nThen times get tough, and so\nthey cut money back on the project.\n\n1166\n00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,270\nDoes that mean the project's over?\n\n1167\n00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:00,280\nWell if they cut 100% of the funding,\nyes then the project's over.\n\n1168\n00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,270\nBut if they just cut back your funding,\n\n1169\n00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:06,940\nwhat we normally have to do is either when\nyou lose cost, right, what do you do?\n\n1170\n00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:11,870\nYou lose some requirements to make up for\nit or you expand your time.\n\n1171\n00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,980\nYour two year project just became\na five year project cuz you had half\n\n1172\n00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,090\nthe funding, right?\n\n1173\n00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:20,240\nThat's what happens, so just keep that\nin mind that that number, if it changes,\n\n1174\n00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,750\nit affects the other two.\n\n1175\n00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:28,450\nAlright so our project funding\nrequirements, what money we need and when.\n\n1176\n00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,150\nAnd then lastly project document updates.\n\n1177\n00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:33,670\nAgain, if we didn't have a cost\nmanagement plan, we take the tools and\n\n1178\n00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:37,150\nstuff that we did here, any templates\nthat we made, like my little template.\n\n1179\n00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,275\nAnd that becomes a part of our\nproject management plan, and\n\n1180\n00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:43,570\nspecifically the cost management plan,\nall right?\n\n1181\n00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,038\nAnd I think that's pretty much what\nyou called out too, Ronnie, right?\n\n1182\n00:58:46,038 --> 00:58:47,280\n>> That's it.\n>> Did I leave anything out?\n\n1183\n00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,670\n>> Nope.\n>> No, pretty good there.\n\n1184\n00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,720\nAll right, so that's pretty much what's\ninvolved in the cost side of things.\n\n1185\n00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,075\nNow again, let me caution you,\n\n1186\n00:58:55,075 --> 00:58:59,971\nwe spent three episodes going\nover the project schedule, right?\n\n1187\n00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,780\nAnd now we're just doing\none episode on cost?\n\n1188\n00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,860\nBoy that was easy, this must be\nthe simplest part of an entire project.\n\n1189\n00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,940\nWell, let me just pull this back up.\n\n1190\n00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,880\nDon't let it deceive you.\n\n1191\n00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,540\nOn the test, yes, this is actually a\nreally simple, small portion of the exam.\n\n1192\n00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:18,160\nYou're not gonna see a lot of questions\nfrom this knowledge area because again,\n\n1193\n00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,960\na lot of project managers don't\nuse this knowledge area, so\n\n1194\n00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,320\nit doesn't show up very\nheavily on the exam.\n\n1195\n00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,410\nBut the main reason why it's shorter\n\n1196\n00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:29,280\nis a lot of it is overlap with what\nwe saw up in schedule management.\n\n1197\n00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,820\nSo they are very similar, and in real\nlife, if you're planning your budget,\n\n1198\n00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,720\nit will take a lot of time and\nresources, it takes a lot of effort.\n\n1199\n00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,470\nBut we're also gonna\ntake a look at quality,\n\n1200\n00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:41,790\nwhich is actually the next thing in line,\nwhich factors into our cost too.\n\n1201\n00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,830\nWe saw that, cost of quality,\nthat's an important thing.\n\n1202\n00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,780\nAll right, well Ronnie, I think that\npretty much wraps up cost management.\n\n1203\n00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,470\nCan you think of anything\nelse we should throw in?\n\n1204\n00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:50,100\n>> No, I don't think so.\n\n1205\n00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,205\nI think we're ready for\nthe next set when we get to it.\n\n1206\n00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:57,488\n>> I think that we should mention in\nthe famous words of the Notorious B.I.G.,\n\n1207\n00:59:57,488 --> 00:59:59,580\nmo money mo problems, right.\n\n1208\n00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,250\n>> That's true.\n\n1209\n01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,200\n>> So be aware of that.\n\n1210\n01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,530\nI don't know if it'll be on the exam or\nnot, but it might.\n\n1211\n01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,750\nSo [LAUGH], all right.\n\n1212\n01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,800\nWell ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the

right, good morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening, and welcome back.\n\n5\n00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,800\nTo another episode of IT pro\nTv I'm your host Don Pizette.\n\n6\n00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,040\nBack again with mister Ronnie Wang.\n\n7\n00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,820\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,920\n>> We are doing well today.\n\n9\n00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,710\nWe have used none of the Beastie Boy\nsongs in any of our advertisements here\n\n10\n00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,250\nat IT Pro Tv.\n\n11\n00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,050\n>> That's important.\n\n12\n00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,685\n>> So we're doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:53,990\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know it's amazing which bands\n\n14\n00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,098\ndecide to apply their intellectual\nproperty the way they do.\n\n15\n00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,327\n[LAUGH].\n\n16\n00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:00,820\nThe Beastie Boys, of all things.\n\n17\n00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,580\nAll right, so today,\nwe are gonna continue on with planning.\n\n18\n00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,920\nAnd you might be ask yourself,\ncome on guys.\n\n19\n00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,710\nHow many episodes are we\ngonna do on planning.\n\n20\n00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,590\nEventually we gotta do something, right.\n\n21\n00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,124\n>> More.\n[LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:12,010\n>> Yeah, well, we got more.\n\n23\n00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,985\n>> So it's a lot.\n\n24\n00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:16,722\nPlanning is a big, [CROSSTALK] big part\nof what we do as project managers.\n\n25\n00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:19,190\nAnd it's a big, big part of the exam.\n\n26\n00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,990\nSo that's why we continue on.\n\n27\n00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,080\nFortunately we are starting to wind down,\nright.\n\n28\n00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,030\nLet me bring up my pimbock, and\nget to my good ole process groups.\n\n29\n00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,810\nSorry, just a second, there we go.\n\n30\n00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,200\nAnd, basically we're starting\nto wind things down.\n\n31\n00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,990\nWe got all the way through our\nscope management, time, cost.\n\n32\n00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,071\nAnd now we're going into these last\ncouple of ones which are pretty sure with\n\n33\n00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,813\nthe exception of risk, right.\n\n34\n00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:44,950\nThere's a lot involved with risk.\n\n35\n00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,240\nBut the other guys are pretty short, so\ntoday, depends on how time goes, but\n\n36\n00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,530\nwe're gonna shoot for the triple threat.\n\n37\n00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,280\nWe're gonna try and\nknock out quality management, and\n\n38\n00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,200\nhuman resource management and\ncommunications management today.\n\n39\n00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,690\nWe'll see how it goes.\n\n40\n00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,930\nSometimes I ramble on too much, and\nthen we might have to do part two,\n\n41\n00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,350\nbut we'll see.\n\n42\n00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,390\nSo we're gonna start out\nright here with this guy,\n\n43\n00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,870\nwhich is Plan quality management.\n\n44\n00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,110\nNow quality management is\nkind of a weird topic.\n\n45\n00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,960\nBecause it doesn't apply\nto every industry.\n\n46\n00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,400\nSo I go back to what I said\nin episode number one.\n\n47\n00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,190\nWhich was the PMI framework\nis a modular framework.\n\n48\n00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,170\nYou pick and choose the things\nthat you need in your company.\n\n49\n00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,100\nAnd the things that you don't need,\nyou cut them out.\n\n50\n00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,500\nYou just throw them on the floor and\nthat's it.\n\n51\n00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,390\nAnd so\nquality management is one of those where\n\n52\n00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,300\nyou may not need any kind of\nformal quality management.\n\n53\n00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,420\nAnd you might lop this out and\nit's gone, right.\n\n54\n00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,070\nSo, how do we know if we need it or not.\n\n55\n00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,840\nWell we start by saying, what is quality.\n\n56\n00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,640\nWhat the heck am I even talking about,\nright.\n\n57\n00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,850\nIf your project involves\nthe creation of a physical,\n\n58\n00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,030\ntangible item, there's going to be\nspecifications that item has to meet.\n\n59\n00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,490\nAnd our quality Is how well\nwe met those requirements.\n\n60\n00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,890\nNow if we're talking about\nprocess improvement, or\n\n61\n00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,610\na service, it's a little bit\nharder to measure, right?\n\n62\n00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,610\nBut pretty much everything\ncan be quantified.\n\n63\n00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,470\nIf our project is to improve\nthe efficiency of a,\n\n64\n00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,010\nlet's use a real world example.\n\n65\n00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,410\nThis was done years ago.\n\n66\n00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,370\nThere was a project to improve the\nefficiency of the McDonald's Drive Thru.\n\n67\n00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,470\nHow to make the drive thru\nget people through faster.\n\n68\n00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,470\nSo they did studies,\nthey did some prototypes,\n\n69\n00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,030\nthey tried some various things.\n\n70\n00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,060\nAnd at at the end of the day they\ndecided it would be best to add a second\n\n71\n00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,070\ndrive through window.\n\n72\n00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,970\nSo you had a window where you paid, and\n\n73\n00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,410\nanother window where you got your food,\nright.\n\n74\n00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,870\nAnd they found that got people\nthrough the drive through faster.\n\n75\n00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,520\nThey were able to measure that by\nmeasuring the amount of time people spent\n\n76\n00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,910\nin the drive through.\n\n77\n00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,570\nYou improve the quality of the customer\nexperience by making that time shorter.\n\n78\n00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,470\nAlright, now there's always room for\nimprovement.\n\n79\n00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,210\nWe have this concept called\ncontinual improvement or\n\n80\n00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,110\ncontinual process improvement.\n\n81\n00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,110\nWhich is stating that\nyou're never really done.\n\n82\n00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,830\nYou can always make things better, right.\n\n83\n00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,010\nBut when we're dealing with a project,\n\n84\n00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,850\nwe're not necessarily\nmaking something better.\n\n85\n00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,380\nThat's not necessarily\nwhat our project is.\n\n86\n00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,350\nMaybe we're creating something all new.\n\n87\n00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,510\nIn which case we just have a set of\nrequirements that we need to meet.\n\n88\n00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,950\nAnd in the IT world we're not normally\ndoing quality measurements like these.\n\n89\n00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,380\nWe're normally meeting our\nrequirements and that's, that.\n\n90\n00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,440\nBut if there's something\nthat's subjective,\n\n91\n00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,480\nif you're creating an advertising\ncampaign or something.\n\n92\n00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,840\nThen you're going to need ways to\nmeasure quality to ensure that you\n\n93\n00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,680\nmeet your customers needs.\n\n94\n00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,810\nSo planning quality\nmanagement is creating,\n\n95\n00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,730\nwell it's creating our\nquality management plan.\n\n96\n00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,860\nAnd it's basically saying how are we\ngoing to handle quality for our project.\n\n97\n00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,080\nThen you'll see, perform quality\nassurance, and control quality,\n\n98\n00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,440\nwhere we actually implement that later on.\n\n99\n00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,830\nAnd in fact,\nif you look at all three of these,\n\n100\n00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,720\nunlike every other one we've done so far.\n\n101\n00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,045\nWhere you created a plan, and\nthen you had other things that you did.\n\n102\n00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,075\nRight?\nSo plan scope management,\n\n103\n00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:00,415\nplan schedule management,\nplan cost management.\n\n104\n00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:01,985\nBut then they had other things.\n\n105\n00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,065\nThese next three that we're gonna do,\nthe quality management,\n\n106\n00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:07,530\nhuman resource management, and\ncommunications management.\n\n107\n00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,880\nWe're just coming up with\na plan right here, that's it.\n\n108\n00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,020\nThat's all we're doing at this\nparticular phase in the planning model.\n\n109\n00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,540\nAnd that's because we can't\nreally do much with these,\n\n110\n00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,470\nuntil we're actually executing.\n\n111\n00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,980\nWe can't manage our human resources until\nwe actually have the human resources.\n\n112\n00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,390\nAnd we don't need those\npeople until work starts.\n\n113\n00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,950\nRight?\n\n114\n00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,970\nSame thing with communications.\n\n115\n00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,240\nWe don't need to communicate\nwith people until work starts.\n\n116\n00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,240\nWhen we're in the planning phase, we're\ntalking with our project management team.\n\n117\n00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,110\nWe're already in communication with them.\n\n118\n00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,610\nSo these three phases\nare a little bit special,\n\n119\n00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,020\nin that we're just kind of coming up with\nhow we're going to manage these things.\n\n120\n00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,050\nWhen we detect it.\n\n121\n00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,360\nSo let's take a look at\nplanning quality management.\n\n122\n00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,910\nPlanning quality management it's\npretty standard process for us.\n\n123\n00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,220\nOn the input side, we've got our project\nmanagement plan, if we have one.\n\n124\n00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,510\nBecause if we already have\na project management plan,\n\n125\n00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,850\nthen we've already planned for\nquality management.\n\n126\n00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,220\nWe've already designated how we're\ngonna handle it, we're, kind of, done.\n\n127\n00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,680\nBut if we're having to\ncreate this ourselves,\n\n128\n00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,350\nthen we're gonna have to get\ninformation from other places.\n\n129\n00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,340\nOur stakeholder register, that's gonna\nidentify the people that are involved.\n\n130\n00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,594\nThe people that I need to reach out to,\nare gonna have the information that I need\n\n131\n00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,030\nas I figure out how I\nwant to do this plan.\n\n132\n00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,930\nMy risk register that I know\nwe haven't talked about yet.\n\n133\n00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,560\nBut listing the various quality concerns\nthat might happen as part of our project.\n\n134\n00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,600\nOur requirements documentation,\n\n135\n00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,760\nhow do I know whether I'm\nmeeting what my customer wants?\n\n136\n00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,920\nWell, the requirements documentation\nis where that data is found, so\n\n137\n00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,870\nI need to go and look there.\n\n138\n00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,230\nAnd, then our two favorites,\nEnterprise environmental factors and\n\n139\n00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,490\nOrganizational process assets,\nsame as they always are.\n\n140\n00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,430\nAny regulations I have to meet and\nany paperwork,\n\n141\n00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,360\ndocumentation, templates or whatever that\nI've already got as part of the company.\n\n142\n00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,300\nAll right,\nthen we start to apply the magic.\n\n143\n00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,120\nThe world of quality is a very complex and\nadvanced world.\n\n144\n00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,730\nYou have a lot of organizations out\nthere that have quality managers.\n\n145\n00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,520\nThat have people that have\nPhD's in quality management.\n\n146\n00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,810\nThis is a very, very robust field.\n\n147\n00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,330\nBut with PMI,\nwe're concerned about the project.\n\n148\n00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:15,910\nRight?\nSo\n\n149\n00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,420\nwe reduce it down to what looks\nlike a very simple thing.\n\n150\n00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,520\nIt's actually a pretty complex topic.\n\n151\n00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120\nFortunately we don't have\nto go too crazy on it.\n\n152\n00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,760\nSo what we're gonna do,\n\n153\n00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,240\nis we're gonna look at some of\nthe various ways of managing quality.\n\n154\n00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,600\nSome of the various tools\nthat are available out there.\n\n155\n00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,400\nAgain you just pick and choose what it\nis you want to use in your company.\n\n156\n00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,170\nThe first one is one of the easiest.\n\n157\n00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,660\nIt's what's called\na cost benefit analysis.\n\n158\n00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,010\nThere's a lot of things that we can do in\nour organization to make something better.\n\n159\n00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,255\nAll right, and it's up to us to choose\nwhether or not we want to do it.\n\n160\n00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:48,674\nAnd it often comes down\nto something very simple.\n\n161\n00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:51,975\nWe look at how much it would\ncost us to do something and\n\n162\n00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:54,989\nwhat benefit we would get out of it,\nall right.\n\n163\n00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:59,720\nAnd sometimes you'll find that\nthe benefit is greater than the cost.\n\n164\n00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,830\nAnd it makes sense to do it.\n\n165\n00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,590\nOther times the cost is\ngreater than the benefit, and\n\n166\n00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,680\nit doesn't make sense to do it.\n\n167\n00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,880\nLet me give you guys an example.\n\n168\n00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,730\nHere in the studio that we're in,\nall of our electricity is provided by\n\n169\n00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,130\nthe electrical grid here in\nthe city of Gainesville, all right.\n\n170\n00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,710\nSo we have no alternate energy\nsolutions here in the building.\n\n171\n00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,340\nSo let's say we wanted to change that.\n\n172\n00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,070\nWe wanna put solar panels on the ceiling,\nor\n\n173\n00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,380\non the roof,\nI just wouldn't on the ceiling.\n\n174\n00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,900\nSo we'll put solar panels on our roof,\nthat'll capture the sun's energy,\n\n175\n00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,420\nconvert it to electricity, and maybe\noffset some of our electrical costs here,\n\n176\n00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,950\nas far as powering our lights,\nand all of that.\n\n177\n00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,820\nAll right?\n\n178\n00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,150\nWell, the solar panels cost money.\n\n179\n00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,080\nThe electricity costs money also.\n\n180\n00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,529\nSo, by installing those solar panels,\n\n181\n00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,730\nwill I save at least that\namount of electricity?\n\n182\n00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,540\nYou know my electric bill, will it go\ndown that much to offset the cost, or\n\n183\n00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,198\nis offsetting the environmental\nfoot print enough for me?\n\n184\n00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:04,830\nMm-hm\n>> Right, maybe I'm just really well for\n\n185\n00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,093\nthose who know me I'm not very upset.\n\n186\n00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:10,600\n[LAUGH] But lets say I'm upset that\nwe're burning to many fossil fuels or\n\n187\n00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,580\nwhatever, and I'm worried,\nthe environment.\n\n188\n00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,150\nAnd so\nI wanna reduce our environmental impact.\n\n189\n00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,690\nI wanna reduce our carbon footprint.\n\n190\n00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,630\nSo, I want to put those solar panels up,\nand it's not a matter of money to me.\n\n191\n00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,940\nI'm not worried about how\nmuch those solar panels cost,\n\n192\n00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,690\nI'm worried about how much I can\nhelp the environment, right?\n\n193\n00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,980\nSo, is that the best thing to help?\n\n194\n00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980\nWould wind turbines be better?\n\n195\n00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,195\nWould, what else do we have, Ronnie?\n\n196\n00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:34,550\n[LAUGH] Biomass?\n\n197\n00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> We are going to do a biomass thing?\n\n198\n00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,970\nWhich one is gonna give me the best\nimprovement over, whatever my goal is?\n\n199\n00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,530\nNow, I use the example of the environment.\n\n200\n00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,040\nI've never dealt with a project\nthat dealt with environment.\n\n201\n00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,700\nBut what I normally dealt with was money.\n\n202\n00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,160\nEverybody's concerned about money,\nyour bottom line.\n\n203\n00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,450\nAnd we actually did a little study\nright here, just a few weeks ago.\n\n204\n00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,110\nWe have some servers in place.\n\n205\n00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,920\nAnd our general manager came to me and\nsaid Don,\n\n206\n00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,880\nthose servers are getting kind of old,\nand I think we should replace them.\n\n207\n00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,660\nAnd I said, well, they're getting\nkind of old, but they're not used for\n\n208\n00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660\nanything production,\nthey're our test servers.\n\n209\n00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,500\nAnd they work fine.\n\n210\n00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,650\nThey're not under warranty, but\nI'm not worried about that,\n\n211\n00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,430\nwe don't need to replace them.\n\n212\n00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,530\nAnd he said well, Don they're old, so\nthey probably draw a lot of electricity.\n\n213\n00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,110\nI bet if we put new servers in, it would\nsave enough electricity to pay for\n\n214\n00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,120\nthemselves.\n\n215\n00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,205\nAnd I said Philip you're crazy.\n\n216\n00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:32,130\nThat' not, you know, I can't imagine\nthose servers drawing off power.\n\n217\n00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,620\nSo he went out and\nhe purchased a device called a kilowatt.\n\n218\n00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,190\nAnd you plug it in between the server and\nthe wall and\n\n219\n00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,720\nit measures the electrical draw.\n\n220\n00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,500\nAnd so he did that,\nhe monitored it over a period a days,\n\n221\n00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,800\nwhat each power supply\nthose servers would take.\n\n222\n00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,610\nAnd then he took it, and\nhe ran the numbers he got against our\n\n223\n00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,580\nelectrical bills,\nto find out what those servers cost us.\n\n224\n00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,940\nAnd each servers,\nthere were three of them in this case,\n\n225\n00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,430\nwere costing us about $600\nper year in electric,\n\n226\n00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,260\nwhich is way more than I thought\nit would be, so I was wrong.\n\n227\n00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,520\nI thought it would be way less.\n\n228\n00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,280\n$600 per year.\n\n229\n00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,890\nRight.\n\n230\n00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,420\nSo at $600 per year,\nlet's think about the server here.\n\n231\n00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,260\nSo I'm going to bring up\njust a blank notepad,\n\n232\n00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,110\nand I'll show you how a simple\ncost benefit analysis works.\n\n233\n00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,700\nAll right.\nSo the old servers,\n\n234\n00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:30,368\nthey basically have\nan operational cost of $600\n\n235\n00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:34,850\nper year just for electricity, right.\n\n236\n00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,970\nSo that's our old servers.\n\n237\n00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,190\nWe could get new servers, and the new\nservers, you know, prices have come down,\n\n238\n00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,020\ntechnology has advanced and so\nthese older servers that we have.\n\n239\n00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,090\nI think we paid about $6,000 for\neach of them.\n\n240\n00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,650\nAnd there are three of them, so\n\n241\n00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,180\nyou know we got What is that 18\nthousand sunk into those servers.\n\n242\n00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,296\nWe could get new servers of similar\nspecification for less money.\n\n243\n00:11:58,296 --> 00:12:00,830\nFor about $3,000 a piece, so\n\n244\n00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,495\nI'm just going to put in here\nthere are three of them.\n\n245\n00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:13,220\nThey originally cost $6,000 each.\n\n246\n00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,880\nRight?\n\n247\n00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,410\nAnd the operational cost of $600 per year,\neach, just in electricity.\n\n248\n00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,339\nAnd what Phillip was showing me,\nwas that the new servers,\n\n249\n00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,987\nif we wanted to get three of them.\n\n250\n00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:28,900\nThese cost around $3,000.\n\n251\n00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,680\nSo they cost about half as much\nas they did before, right.\n\n252\n00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,570\nBecause the cost of memory comes down.\n\n253\n00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,950\nThe cost of storage comes down.\n\n254\n00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,060\nAll that comes down over time.\n\n255\n00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,820\nAl lright.\n\n256\n00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,780\nBut he showed me where the new\nones had a much lower power draw.\n\n257\n00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,850\nIn fact it was so\nlow that their operational cost,\n\n258\n00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,860\nhe was showing me was right around\nsomething like $90 per year each.\n\n259\n00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,930\nSo the newer power supplies\nwere far more efficient.\n\n260\n00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,370\nThey drew a much lower wattage.\n\n261\n00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,620\nThe newer CPUs required\na much lower wattage.\n\n262\n00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,776\nSo what he was showing me was, that for\neach of these servers that we replace,\n\n263\n00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:16,660\nyou're actually saving $510 per year, so\n\n264\n00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,230\nthat equals a $510 savings per year for\neach server.\n\n265\n00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,920\nAll right, and his argument was,\nif the server cost $3,000 and\n\n266\n00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,110\nyou save $510 a year, doesn't it make\nsense to go ahead and replace them.\n\n267\n00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,950\nGet some new servers in there and\nreplace it.\n\n268\n00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,570\nWell here's when we do our cost benefit.\n\n269\n00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,800\nAnalysis.\n\n270\n00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,300\nWe look at the cost versus the benefit.\n\n271\n00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,410\nThe cost would be $3,000 per server,\nand there's three of them.\n\n272\n00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,450\nSo our cost benefit analysis.\n\n273\n00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,086\nOur cost would actually be $9,000.\n\n274\n00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:00,090\nSo our cost, $9,000 for new equipment.\n\n275\n00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,810\nAll right, our benefit would be\na $510 savings per year, but\n\n276\n00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,840\nthere's three of them, right.\n\n277\n00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:14,510\nSo it would actually be aone $1,530\n\n278\n00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:20,071\nsavings in electricity per year.\n\n279\n00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:24,140\nAlright electricity, there we go.\n\n280\n00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,050\nAll right, so\nI'm saving about $1,500 per year, right?\n\n281\n00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,950\nWell that sounds like a great idea,\nI can save 1,500 per year,\n\n282\n00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,120\nI should do it, right?\n\n283\n00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,640\nWell here's the thing,\nlet's look at the cost to benefit.\n\n284\n00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,810\nThe cost is $9,000 to\nbe able to save $1,500.\n\n285\n00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,910\nSo when does that pay for itself?\n\n286\n00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,480\nWhen does it start to benefit us?\n\n287\n00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,020\nRight?\n\n288\n00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,195\nWell we have to work that out.\n\n289\n00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:50,850\n$9,000 divided by $1,500, right?\n\n290\n00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,780\nNow I'm just going to round it\nbecause 30 bucks is 30 bucks.\n\n291\n00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,670\nThat equals, what is it four?\n\n292\n00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,120\nOh no it's six right?\n\n293\n00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,880\n>> Yeah just about six.\n\n294\n00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,690\n>> So it's six.\n\n295\n00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,680\nIt would take six years for\nthese servers to pay for\n\n296\n00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,330\nthemselves and\nstart to earn us money back.\n\n297\n00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,240\nSo for the first six years that power\nsaving is just compensating us for\n\n298\n00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,950\nthe cost of the initial servers.\n\n299\n00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,600\nWe don't actually make that money back.\n\n300\n00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,170\nNow, in some worlds,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n301\n00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,190\nBut in the IT world,\nif I buy servers today,\n\n302\n00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,330\nam I going to be running\nthem six years from now?\n\n303\n00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,940\nNo.\nServers don't normally make it\n\n304\n00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940\nthree years, better yet five.\n\n305\n00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,640\nAnd so, you know,\nam I going to run these six years, no?\n\n306\n00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,080\nSo they won't have time to pay for\n\n307\n00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,620\nthemselves by the time they die out,\nby the time I'm ready to replace them.\n\n308\n00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,090\nSo the cost to benefit\nanalysis here shows that,\n\n309\n00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:47,540\nthis should not be the sole\nfactor I do the upgrade.\n\n310\n00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,420\nI say it that way because\nthere might be other factors.\n\n311\n00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,700\nOur old servers, they are just that.\n\n312\n00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,470\nThey're old.\n\n313\n00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,723\nThey're not under warranty anymore.\n\n314\n00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:56,209\nIf I have a motherboard fail?\n\n315\n00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,069\n>> Yeah, we're up.\n\n316\n00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:00,262\n>> Yeah, I've gotta go on eBay and\nfind one, or something like that.\n\n317\n00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:03,745\nBut if I get new servers,\nthey'll come with a three year warranty.\n\n318\n00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:04,790\nSo they'll be under warranty.\n\n319\n00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,200\nIf something goes wrong, I've got that.\n\n320\n00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,790\nSo there may be other benefits\nthat I need to be aware of.\n\n321\n00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,650\nBut just looking at raw cost here,\nthis looks like a pretty easy decision.\n\n322\n00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,700\nI shouldn't be motivated to replace the\nservers unless I just feel like it, right?\n\n323\n00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,330\nThis is not a reason, all right?\n\n324\n00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,230\nSo that's what a cost-benefit analysis is.\n\n325\n00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,330\nWe just need to take a honest to\ngoodness look, quantify our numbers,\n\n326\n00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,620\nfigure out does it make\nmathematical sense to do it, right?\n\n327\n00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,640\nAnd you see many projects across\nthe world that don't take the time\n\n328\n00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,490\nto do a simple cost-benefit analysis,\nand they end up going kinda crazy.\n\n329\n00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,860\nAnd I said biomass earlier,\nwhich was kind of an inside joke.\n\n330\n00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,330\nThe city of Gainesville, where we are,\n\n331\n00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,280\nwe approved a biomass plant\nto be built years ago, right?\n\n332\n00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,410\nIt was approved ten years ago.\n\n333\n00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,360\n>> Yeah, pretty long.\n\n334\n00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,880\n>> It just went into operation\nabout two years ago.\n\n335\n00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,550\nAnd it's turned out to be\njust a outright debacle.\n\n336\n00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,870\nThe cost of operating the plant has\nfar exceeded any benefit on it and\n\n337\n00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,500\nit's turned out to just be a mess.\n\n338\n00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,580\nAnd they're actually having to\nchop down trees to power it,\n\n339\n00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,200\nwhich is completely against\nthe environmental idea of it.\n\n340\n00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,580\nSo it is a mess, so\nthat's why I threw that one out there.\n\n341\n00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,750\nBut you see it in any project, right?\n\n342\n00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,030\nYou're building a new house.\n\n343\n00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,870\nAnd you decide you want to\nput solar panels on it.\n\n344\n00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,610\nOkay?\n\n345\n00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,830\nThe solar panels cost money.\n\n346\n00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,310\nHow long does it take for\nthem to pay themselves off?\n\n347\n00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,530\nWell, with solar panels it's\ndifferent than servers.\n\n348\n00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,380\nSix years?\n\n349\n00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,290\nThat's too long for servers.\n\n350\n00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,960\nBut let's say this same thing\nplayed out a different way.\n\n351\n00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,010\nLet's say that it was solar panels that\ncost $9000, and they saved us 1500 a year.\n\n352\n00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,710\nIt would take six years for\nthose solar panels to pay themselves off.\n\n353\n00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,670\nBut, how long am I gonna\nlive in that house?\n\n354\n00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,040\nI might live in that house for 30 years.\n\n355\n00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,030\nA house could stay standing, there's\nplenty of houses, well not in Gainesville,\n\n356\n00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,780\nbut in other cities that\nare a hundred years old.\n\n357\n00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,310\nFor our European viewers,\nmight be hundreds of years old.\n\n358\n00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,310\nAnd so, in those scenarios,\nwill the solar panels pay themselves off?\n\n359\n00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,190\nAbsolutely.\n\n360\n00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,510\nAnd is it worth it to do it?\n\n361\n00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,800\nAbsolutely.\n\n362\n00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,070\nSo it definitely depends\non what you're doing,\n\n363\n00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,030\nthe other kind of circumstances\nthat surround it.\n\n364\n00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,750\nSo that is a cost to benefit analysis,\nvery common thing.\n\n365\n00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,810\nAnd it should really be done\nwith just about any expenditure.\n\n366\n00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,710\nAll right, other things.\n\n367\n00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,950\nWhere is my?\n\n368\n00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,830\nThere.\n\n369\n00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,320\nCost of quality.\n\n370\n00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,280\nI mention cost of quality\nin another episode.\n\n371\n00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,000\nCost of quality,\nit actually takes two forms.\n\n372\n00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,740\nWe have really two different\nconcepts when it comes to quality.\n\n373\n00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:50,160\nThis was basically\na cost benefit analysis.\n\n374\n00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,700\nAll right, so\nwhen it comes to cost of quality.\n\n375\n00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,540\nCost of quality normally presents\nitself in one of two ways.\n\n376\n00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,780\nCost of quality.\n\n377\n00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,540\nIt's gonna present itself as\neither quality control or\n\n378\n00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,130\nquality assurance, all right?\n\n379\n00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:15,300\nSo quality assurance is the first one,\nquality control is the second.\n\n380\n00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,200\nAnd we're gonna see more of these\nwhen we get into execution, but\n\n381\n00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,270\nquality assurance,\nthat's preventative measures.\n\n382\n00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,500\nAnd I'm writing this, Ronnie, you\nalready have notes for this, don't you?\n\n383\n00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,250\n>> I do, yep.\n>> I am spinning my wheels, aren't I?\n\n384\n00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,410\n>> Right there, yep.\n\n385\n00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,100\n>> Where?\nOh, right here.\n\n386\n00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,080\nCost equality.\nOkay.\n\n387\n00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,981\nSo, we have quality assurance, and\nwe have Quality control and well,\n\n388\n00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:36,033\nactually you do all that but.\n\n389\n00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:39,800\nLet me just write these out and\nthen we'll come back to this.\n\n390\n00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,940\nYou've got important stuff there but\nnot exactly what I wanted to say.\n\n391\n00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:53,160\nSo quality of assurance that is preventing\nquality issues before they occur.\n\n392\n00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,990\nOkay?\n\n393\n00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:59,700\nQuality control is correcting\nquality issues after they occur.\n\n394\n00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,540\nThey're really the same concept.\n\n395\n00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,270\nIt's just one is proactive,\none is reactive.\n\n396\n00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,600\nThey both have a cost.\n\n397\n00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,070\nThey both have a benefit.\n\n398\n00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,630\nAnd we have to determine whether or\nnot it's worthwhile to do either one.\n\n399\n00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,400\nOkay?\n\n400\n00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,830\nSo, for example,\nif you're an automotive company.\n\n401\n00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,550\nIf you're manufacturing,\nwhat car were we manufacturing?\n\n402\n00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,590\n>> The Ford Focus.\n\n403\n00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,151\n>> That's it!\n\n404\n00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:21,677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The 2016 Ford Focus.\n\n405\n00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:24,574\nSo, you are Ford, and you're going\nto be manufacturing this vehicle.\n\n406\n00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:26,420\nYou've got a choice.\n\n407\n00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,960\nOne, you can improve your assembly\nline to produce a Better car.\n\n408\n00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,930\nA better car will have less failures,\nless failures means less warranty work.\n\n409\n00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,190\nSo you save money on the back end by\nnot having to do warranty work, but\n\n410\n00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,900\non the front end you're paying extra\nto make your assembly line better.\n\n411\n00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,840\nThat is quality assurance.\n\n412\n00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,900\nQuality control is where we say,\nyou know what,\n\n413\n00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,630\nlet's just make the car and send it out.\n\n414\n00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,980\nAnd if anything's broken, people will\nbring it back for warranty work and\n\n415\n00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,210\nwe'll fix it then.\n\n416\n00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,720\nRight?\n\n417\n00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,740\nSo we save money on the front end by\nnot having to improve our processes.\n\n418\n00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,300\nBut we spend money on the back end having\nto fix the problems as they occur,\n\n419\n00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,850\nif they occur.\n\n420\n00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,290\nAll right.\n\n421\n00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:15,790\nNow, it's not normally a one size\nfits fits all, normally we do both.\n\n422\n00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,590\nWe find out certain things that we can\ndo for quality assurance ahead of time.\n\n423\n00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,600\nAnd then other things we evaluate and\n\n424\n00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,020\nsay it's a low enough risk that we\npush off to quality control later.\n\n425\n00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,830\nAnd we're seeing that now, what is it,\nlike the ignition systems,\n\n426\n00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,080\nhave you read about that Ronnie?\n\n427\n00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,790\nSomething, and I don't understand this\ncuz I don't have an automotive mind, but\n\n428\n00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,620\nthere's some kind of piece in the ignition\nsystem of a particular vehicle that,\n\n429\n00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,800\nit should have been longer than\nwhat it was measurement wise.\n\n430\n00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,175\nAnd something happened in\nthe manufacturing process where it was\n\n431\n00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:48,700\nmanufactured shorter\nthan it should have been.\n\n432\n00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,840\nSo, they had a choice.\n\n433\n00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,440\nEither recall all the vehicles and\nfix it, or just let it go.\n\n434\n00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,030\nLet it go and\nas problems happen they would fix them.\n\n435\n00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,190\nAnd that's the choice they made.\n\n436\n00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,380\nThey said you know what?\n\n437\n00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,480\nThe cost of fixing them as problems occur\nwill be less than the cost of us going and\n\n438\n00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,300\ndoing the repair right now so\nwe'll just wait.\n\n439\n00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,880\nThat was fine until somebody died.\n\n440\n00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,870\nThen when somebody dies\nthen it becomes a big deal.\n\n441\n00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,680\nSo then they went out and\nnow they're repairing the vehicles.\n\n442\n00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,210\nThe automotive industry's\na little cynical in that aspect.\n\n443\n00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,320\nBut now they're doing quality assurance.\n\n444\n00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,150\nThey're saying, for every vehicle\nmanufactured from now on we're\n\n445\n00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,510\ngonna make sure that part is long enough,\nright?\n\n446\n00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,180\nSo it's really a combination of the two\nthat's going to suit your environment.\n\n447\n00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,100\nThe trick is just figuring out whether\nit's worth the money to fix it ahead\n\n448\n00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,990\nof time or fix it after the fact.\n\n449\n00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,990\nFixing it after the fact not\nonly has a monetary price but\n\n450\n00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,520\nit also has a public image,\npublic relations price.\n\n451\n00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,560\nIf you If you have a giant recall,\nthat's gonna hurt sales of your vehicle.\n\n452\n00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,350\nThat's a big deal.\n\n453\n00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,790\nSo, when we're talking\nabout cost of quality,\n\n454\n00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,350\nthose are the costs that we're evaluating.\n\n455\n00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,202\nThe cost of fixing things ahead of time\nto ensure problems don't occur, or\n\n456\n00:22:57,202 --> 00:23:01,917\nthe cost of just letting it ride and\nfixing the problems as they do occur.\n\n457\n00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:09,390\nSo let's take that idea and I'm just\ngonna stick that here in the notes.\n\n458\n00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,560\nAnd you went straight from the pin box so\nI'm just gonna add right above it there.\n\n459\n00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,810\nOkay, so when we talk about\ncost of quality, you see it\n\n460\n00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,920\nworded a few different ways and so\nhere we've got like cost of conformance.\n\n461\n00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,970\nWhat's it gonna cost us during the project\nto prevent that failure from occurring.\n\n462\n00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,358\nAnd that's what we would call\nquality assurance, or QA.\n\n463\n00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:34,720\nAll right, and\nthen you'll see cost of non-conformance,\n\n464\n00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,620\nthat is if we let the problem happen,\nand we go and resolve it after the fact.\n\n465\n00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,190\nThat would be quality control, all right?\n\n466\n00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,900\nAnd we'll see those two concepts\nmore in the execution phase or\n\n467\n00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,670\nreally monitoring and controlling.\n\n468\n00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,570\nBut you'll see here under\ncost of conformance,\n\n469\n00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,130\nyou've got the prevention costs.\n\n470\n00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,080\nSo whatever it does to\nimprove your processes.\n\n471\n00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,100\nMaybe you need to buy some new machinery.\n\n472\n00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,699\nMaybe you have to add an extra\ninspector on the inspector line.\n\n473\n00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:01,382\nMaybe things take a little\nlonger to manufacture.\n\n474\n00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:05,481\nSo documentation, equipment,\ntime to do it right.\n\n475\n00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:08,948\nAll of these things have real\ncost associated with them and\n\n476\n00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,648\nwe need to figure out\nwhether it's worth it.\n\n477\n00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:13,926\nSame thing with non-conformance, right?\n\n478\n00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,911\nRework, where you have to go and\nfix something.\n\n479\n00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:20,500\nScrap, maybe you have to\nthrow it out all together.\n\n480\n00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,130\nIf you're McDonald's and\nyou're manufacturing hamburgers for\n\n481\n00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,420\nyour customer, and you mess up an order,\nand they bring it back like,\n\n482\n00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,680\nyou ruined my order.\n\n483\n00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,540\nWhat do you do?\n\n484\n00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,800\nYou can't just fix it.\n\n485\n00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,720\nYou have to throw it out, and\nmake an all new hamburger.\n\n486\n00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,060\nWell, a hamburger probably cost\nthem pennies on the dollar.\n\n487\n00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,320\nBut, if you're talking about\nan entire vehicle, like lemon law,\n\n488\n00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,310\nor whatever, T then that get's expensive.\n\n489\n00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,300\nSo, what happens there?\n\n490\n00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,350\nLiabilities, that's the big one.\n\n491\n00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,230\nLiabilities, if the failure is shown\nto be due to negligence on your part,\n\n492\n00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,840\nthe legal cost can be through the roof.\n\n493\n00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,060\nIf somebody dies as a result\nof that failure to meet spec,\n\n494\n00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,920\nthat's a big deal and\nit's going to cost a lot.\n\n495\n00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,990\nAnd how can you put\na price on a human life?\n\n496\n00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,060\nIf you're dealing with something that is,\nif somebody's life depends on it, you take\n\n497\n00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,200\nthe time, to spend that money ahead of\ntime, to get that product designed right.\n\n498\n00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,940\nAll right, and then warranty work,\nI already talked it.\n\n499\n00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,540\nAnd then lost business,\nthat public relations side.\n\n500\n00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,890\nIf you make a bad product,\n\n501\n00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:30,390\none that has a lot of returns,\nit's gonna hurt your overall image.\n\n502\n00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,770\nAnd we saw that with Packard Bell, right?\n\n503\n00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> Packard Bell was a computer company\n\n504\n00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,030\nhere in the US.\n\n505\n00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,560\nI think they still sell under\nthe Packard Bell name in Europe.\n\n506\n00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,990\nSo, some of you guys might be\nfamiliar with them, but for awhile,\n\n507\n00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,880\nthey were the leading brand of computers.\n\n508\n00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,680\nEverybody had a Packard Bell.\n\n509\n00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,820\nAnd then what they did is to save money,\nthey started using\n\n510\n00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,800\nrefurbished parts on their computers,\nand it created a higher failure rate.\n\n511\n00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,340\nAnd so, Packard Bell's became\nknown as Packard Hells.\n\n512\n00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,897\nThat if you got one, you knew it was going\nto go into warranty repair every couple of\n\n513\n00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:01,341\nmonths, and\nthe quality level went down and\n\n514\n00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:04,400\nit became such a product that\nyou just didn't want it.\n\n515\n00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,360\nSo it hurt them and\n\n516\n00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,690\nnow they don't do business under\nthat name in the US anymore.\n\n517\n00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,920\nThe brand has been ruined here in the US.\n\n518\n00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,640\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe things that we've got as far as\n\n519\n00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,860\nquality control now,\nand quality assurance.\n\n520\n00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,970\nNow, how do we actually plan for\na lot of this stuff?\n\n521\n00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,740\nWell, we've got seven basic quality tools\nthat we're gonna take a look at, but\n\n522\n00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,060\nwe don't have enough time left\nin this segment to hit them.\n\n523\n00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,980\nSo, let's do this.\n\n524\n00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,490\nLet's stop and\n\n525\n00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,500\ntake a break, and when we get back we're\ngonna take a look at those seven tools.\n\n526\n00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,435\nWhat they do, how they work,\nand get an idea of how we can\n\n527\n00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:45,370\nuse them as we start to plan\nquality in our environment.\n\n528\n00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,099\nAll right, so stay tuned,\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n529\n00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:54,050\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n530\n00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,940\nSo, now we're gonna take a look at these,\nthey call them in the pin box,\n\n531\n00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,520\nthese seven tools of quality management.\n\n532\n00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,650\nAnd there's way more than that, but\nthere's seven that they specifically call\n\n533\n00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,410\nout, and they're easy things that\nwe can put to use to help us make\n\n534\n00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,540\nsure that we're, well,\nproviding quality in our project.\n\n535\n00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:16,020\nThere is a awesome diagram in the PMBOK,\nI'm just gonna pull it up here.\n\n536\n00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,410\nSo this is, in the PMBOK,\nit's page 239 if you've got one.\n\n537\n00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,320\nAnd they basically lay out\nthe seven tools as pictures.\n\n538\n00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,280\nI like pictures because that's\nreally what all these are.\n\n539\n00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,410\nIf you're trying to deal with quality\nin your project, either beforehand or\n\n540\n00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,850\nafterwards, these are the tools\nthat we're gonna use.\n\n541\n00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,390\nSo, let's look at each one.\n\n542\n00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,350\nThe first one's what's called a cause and\neffect diagram.\n\n543\n00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,580\nNow, there's a few different names for\nthis.\n\n544\n00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,230\nYou'll hear it called a fishbone diagram,\nor an ishikawa chart.\n\n545\n00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,470\nThere's a few different\nnames that are out there.\n\n546\n00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,330\nBut, at the end of the day, it's\na cause and effect and what it's doing,\n\n547\n00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:55,840\nI don't know how far in can\nI zoom in on this thing?\n\n548\n00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840\nIt's still pretty clear\neven zoomed in like that.\n\n549\n00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n550\n00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,840\n>> What you do is basically you set up\nwhat it is you're trying to achieve.\n\n551\n00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,390\nOkay?\n\n552\n00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,450\nSo what am I trying to achieve?\n\n553\n00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,952\nWell, here it says,\nawake at 2 AM daily and-\n\n554\n00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:10,491\n>> Strong odors.\n\n555\n00:28:10,491 --> 00:28:13,370\n[LAUGH]\n>> Strong odors.\n\n556\n00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,705\nSo I don't know that I've\never actually read this.\n\n557\n00:28:15,705 --> 00:28:17,480\n>> Recalls analysis of sleeping problems.\n\n558\n00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,010\n>> Okay, so basically they've got\nsomebody who's got a problem, right?\n\n559\n00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:25,760\nSo they're waking up at 2AM every day,\nand at 2 AM they detect a strong odor and\n\n560\n00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,910\nthey don't know why.\n\n561\n00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,300\nSo now, we start to try and\nidentify the potential causes.\n\n562\n00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,760\nWhat could be causing this person to wake\nup at 2 AM and to smell a strong odor?\n\n563\n00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,360\nSo we've detected a flaw in our process,\nor our project, or whatever.\n\n564\n00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,400\nNow we're trying to identify what caused\nthe flaw, so that we can then go and\n\n565\n00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,650\ntake corrective actions.\n\n566\n00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,600\nAnd there might be more than one\nthing that contributes to it, right?\n\n567\n00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,170\nSo as we start to look at this, we see\nthere might be issues with our materials,\n\n568\n00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,470\nour methods, our people,\nor our environment.\n\n569\n00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,950\nThe four categories they've divided up and\nyou can do as many categories as you want,\n\n570\n00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,490\nbut these are pretty standard.\n\n571\n00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,360\nAnd so, looking at these,\nif we break that down even further,\n\n572\n00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,700\nwe'll see trying to identify\nthe root cause of that problem.\n\n573\n00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,645\nSo materials,\nmaybe they were pesticides, cleaners,\n\n574\n00:29:14,645 --> 00:29:18,680\nbathroom materials that were used,\nmaybe dirty sheets.\n\n575\n00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,635\nAll these things could be\ncontributing to the odor.\n\n576\n00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:26,395\nNot necessarily contributing to\nwaking up at 2 AM so much, right?\n\n577\n00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:29,355\nVersus other things that\nmight be disturbing somebody.\n\n578\n00:29:29,355 --> 00:29:30,407\nHere they've got-\n>> Body odor.\n\n579\n00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:32,025\n>> People [LAUGH], body odor with people.\n\n580\n00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:35,735\nThis is a really pleasant diagram, you'd\nthink they'd come up with something else.\n\n581\n00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:38,185\nSo these are all just\ntrying to identify that.\n\n582\n00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:41,385\nIn the environment,\nmaybe there's a skunk outside, right?\n\n583\n00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:43,780\nAnd, so that's contributing to this odor.\n\n584\n00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,800\nMaybe the air conditioning,\nmaybe the air conditioning is turning on,\n\n585\n00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,020\nmaybe it's generating a smell.\n\n586\n00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,300\nMaybe garbage cans too close to the AC,\nthe garbage smell is being bought in.\n\n587\n00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,600\nAll of these are potential causes.\n\n588\n00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,960\nNow which one is the true cause?\n\n589\n00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,290\nWell, there's livelihoods, probabilities.\n\n590\n00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,480\nThe odds of there being a skunk\noutside might be pretty low.\n\n591\n00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,380\nHere in the US, we have skunks,\nin other countries, maybe you don't.\n\n592\n00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,914\nSo, you have to kind evaluate that,\nbut each of these are possibilities.\n\n593\n00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:17,475\nAnd that's the really the point of\na fishbone or ishikawa diagram,\n\n594\n00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:20,925\nis just to basically break down\nwhat are the possible causes.\n\n595\n00:30:20,925 --> 00:30:23,749\nLet's do some brainstorming and\ncome up with things and\n\n596\n00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:27,170\nthen as we look at it afterwards we say,\nwhat can we do to curb these,\n\n597\n00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,590\nbecause each of these\nare really a type of risk.\n\n598\n00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,520\nThere's a risk that there could be a skunk\noutside, but there might not be, right?\n\n599\n00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,560\nIt's not a guarantee, so\nwe need to evaluate that and\n\n600\n00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,700\ndetermine whether there's any mitigation\ntactics that we should follow, right?\n\n601\n00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,530\nThat is a cause and\neffect diagram, all right?\n\n602\n00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,500\nThe next one is a flow chart.\n\n603\n00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,240\nWith a flow chart, when we start to break\ndown one of our processes, we look at all\n\n604\n00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,260\nthe various activities that are happening\nand the things that could go wrong.\n\n605\n00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,232\nAnd anywhere there's a spot where\nsomething could go wrong we plan what\n\n606\n00:31:01,232 --> 00:31:02,800\nwe'll do as a result.\n\n607\n00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,350\nAnd so they show here this\nis a project happening.\n\n608\n00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,210\nSo we get a project requested,\nwe get a plan.\n\n609\n00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,620\nIs there artwork requested?\n\n610\n00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,960\nAnd then if there is then we work on it.\n\n611\n00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,964\nAnd then, is the artwork approved?\n\n612\n00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:21,630\nIf yes, we continue on, if no we go back\nand we generate new artwork and we try and\n\n613\n00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,690\nget it approved.\n\n614\n00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,260\nAnd we might have to cycle through\nhere a few times to ensure that we get\n\n615\n00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,020\nartwork that meets\nthe needs of our customer.\n\n616\n00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,140\nIf we don't, if we just move on, we might\nreach the very end of the project, and\n\n617\n00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,750\nthey say, you know that our work,\nit stinks.\n\n618\n00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,890\nIt's not what I want, and\nthen we have to go back again.\n\n619\n00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,940\nSo, these are the typical\ntype of issues that we have.\n\n620\n00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,800\nBy making a flow chart like this,\nwe can kind of map it out, and\n\n621\n00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,110\nanywhere we have a decision point,\nit's normally represented as a decision\n\n622\n00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:52,330\ndiamond, that we basically evaluate\nour possible outcomes from there.\n\n623\n00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,440\nAnd you'll see they've got it down here.\n\n624\n00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,540\nSo vendors make the proofs,\ndoes the development package,\n\n625\n00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,200\nor whatever, does it get approval?\n\n626\n00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,180\nIf it does, we move on, if not,\nwe go back to more proofs.\n\n627\n00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,300\nSame thing with does it meet QA review?\n\n628\n00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,280\nQuality assurance, before we send it to\nour customer, versus quality control,\n\n629\n00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,198\nwhich is after it gets to our customer.\n\n630\n00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:13,587\nSo, flow charts are pretty\nhandy with that for\n\n631\n00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:16,538\nmapping out where we need to\nhave those decision points.\n\n632\n00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:22,930\nChecklists, or checksheets,\nthey call them.\n\n633\n00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:28,210\nChecklists are the number\none tool of quality control.\n\n634\n00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,060\nAnd we're gonna see in the monitoring\ncontrolling processes where we actually\n\n635\n00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,940\nhave to create these checklists.\n\n636\n00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,220\nThat you've got a set of\nrequirements that say,\n\n637\n00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,060\nI need to meet these requirements for\nthe project to be successful.\n\n638\n00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,381\nSo a checksheet or\na checklist is really just saying,\n\n639\n00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:44,010\ndid I meet these requirements?\n\n640\n00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,650\nYes or no?\nRight?\n\n641\n00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,420\nAnd we go through and we check them off.\n\n642\n00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,230\nAttribute one, do we meet it?\n\n643\n00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,980\nYes.\n\n644\n00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,550\nAttribute two.\n\n645\n00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,110\nDo we meet it?\n\n646\n00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,870\nYes.\nAttribute three.\n\n647\n00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,660\nDo we meet it?\n\n648\n00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,170\nNo.\n\n649\n00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,680\nAll right.\n\n650\n00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,380\nWe got a problem.\n\n651\n00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,580\nWe're not meeting quality.\n\n652\n00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,220\nRight.\n\n653\n00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,910\nAnd then frequency.\n\n654\n00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,280\nHow often do we check?\n\n655\n00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,200\nRight?\nIs this something that we're checking\n\n656\n00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,870\nevery day, every hour?\n\n657\n00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,100\nIf we're manufacturing, I think I used\nblue jeans in an episode the other day.\n\n658\n00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,130\nIf we're manufacturing thousands\nof blue jeans per day,\n\n659\n00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,500\nI can't run every single pair\nthrough a quality check.\n\n660\n00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,820\nSo maybe I'm sampling one\nout of every hundred.\n\n661\n00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,900\nAnd I'm checking, running it against this\nchecklist to look for tolerances right?\n\n662\n00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,400\nIt's a very common thing.\n\n663\n00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:25,850\nAll right, we've got Pareto diagrams.\n\n664\n00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,880\nNow Pareto diagrams are one of\nthose that look really complex, but\n\n665\n00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,560\nare actually really simple.\n\n666\n00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:35,710\nLet's say that I am manufacturing\n1,000 pairs of blue jeans per hour.\n\n667\n00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,590\nAnd I've got a defect rate, right.\n\n668\n00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,070\nMy defect rate is 20%, and\nI wanna get that defect rate down.\n\n669\n00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,498\nI don't want it to go\nout to the customer and\n\n670\n00:33:43,498 --> 00:33:46,760\nhave the customer have to\nreturn 20% my product.\n\n671\n00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,961\nThat means one in five customers\nwill be doing a return,\n\n672\n00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:51,260\nthat's gonna hurt my image.\n\n673\n00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,780\nSo what I do is I look at the defects.\n\n674\n00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,570\nSo out of a batch of a thousand,\nI collect the 20% that are defective.\n\n675\n00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:03,020\nAnd we categorize where\ntheir defect is coming from.\n\n676\n00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:10,510\nSo maybe, in a certain percentage,\nI see that the zipper won't stay up.\n\n677\n00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,870\nFor some reason the zipper keeps falling.\n\n678\n00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:18,080\nIn another percentage,\nthe button isn't properly attached.\n\n679\n00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,940\nIn another one,\nmaybe the button hole is not cut out.\n\n680\n00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> Something happens in our\n\n681\n00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,500\nmachine where it doesn't cut out the hole.\n\n682\n00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,270\nAnd so on.\n\n683\n00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,480\nWe break down all the reasons for\n\n684\n00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,250\na defect, cuz the defect can\ncome from more than one area.\n\n685\n00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:30,830\nAll right.\n\n686\n00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,600\nSo we break down all the reasons, and\n\n687\n00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,290\nthen we sort them by which\none happens the most.\n\n688\n00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,870\nAnd we look at the one that happens\nthe most, this guy right here.\n\n689\n00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,890\nWe total up all the incidents.\n\n690\n00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:50,035\nAnd if I grab 20% of my 1,000 pair of\njeans, then I should have 200 defects.\n\n691\n00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:51,490\nAnd so these should add up to 200.\n\n692\n00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,765\nThat's what this line is here.\n\n693\n00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:55,365\nIt is just making sure that our\nfull number adds up to 200.\n\n694\n00:34:55,365 --> 00:34:58,425\nIf it does not add up to 200,\nthen I must have missed some defects.\n\n695\n00:34:58,425 --> 00:34:59,790\nI need to go and find those out.\n\n696\n00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,650\nEven if there's only one pair that\nsuffered from a particular defect,\n\n697\n00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,410\nI still need to document it.\n\n698\n00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:11,480\nBut when it comes to finding solutions,\nI wanna solve the biggest culprit first.\n\n699\n00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,960\nIf I can solve this one right here,\nand it amounts to 50% of my defects,\n\n700\n00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,800\nthen I just saved, what,\n100 pairs of jeans.\n\n701\n00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,830\nAll these other guys combined might\nonly be 100 pairs of jeans themselves.\n\n702\n00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,090\nSo it makes sense to focus in on this one.\n\n703\n00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:31,860\nI say, all right, for some reason,\nthe zippers are not staying up in 100 out\n\n704\n00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,660\nof 1,000 pairs of jeans\nthat I manufactured.\n\n705\n00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,940\nWe need to replace that zipper.\n\n706\n00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,890\nWe need to change that design or\nuse a different contractor, or\n\n707\n00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,220\nsomething like that.\n\n708\n00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,360\nJust by changing that one component I\nnow regain, I increase my yield by 10%.\n\n709\n00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,810\nThat's a big gain, right?\n\n710\n00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,350\nThat's worth it, right,\nto save 10% of defects.\n\n711\n00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:55,520\nThen I can say all right, what's\nthe cost to benefit analysis on that?\n\n712\n00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,350\nHow much does it cost to\nuse a different zipper?\n\n713\n00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,790\nIf it costs the same,\nit's a no-brainer, do it.\n\n714\n00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:05,250\nIf it cost a little more though, what\ndid it cost us to lose those 10%, right?\n\n715\n00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,010\nWell, if the cost of replacing the zipper\nis higher than the cost of the 10%,\n\n716\n00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,470\nthen we just take that 10%\nthat have a bad zipper, and\n\n717\n00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,960\nwe throw them into the defect rack, right.\n\n718\n00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,690\nAnd they make it over to, a lot of times\nthey'll sell them in outlets or whatever.\n\n719\n00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,530\nThese are defective goods and off they go.\n\n720\n00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,450\nSo maybe we do that.\n\n721\n00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:28,590\nIt makes sense for us not to even bother\nand fix it because 80% of our jeans\n\n722\n00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:34,200\nare fine, and we can sell those at full\nprice, and we recoup our loss, right.\n\n723\n00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,275\nThat's what a Pareto\ndiagram helps you to do.\n\n724\n00:36:36,275 --> 00:36:39,975\nYou're just doing,\nthis is a histogram, a bar chart,\n\n725\n00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:44,225\nthat is mapping the amount of\nincidences of a particular defect.\n\n726\n00:36:44,225 --> 00:36:47,175\nSo this is one defect, this is one defect,\nthis is a different one,\n\n727\n00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:48,975\nthis is a different one, and so on.\n\n728\n00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:52,565\nAnd then a line graph that's showing\n\n729\n00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:56,405\nthe total amount of defects to make sure\nthat we add up to 100% of our defects.\n\n730\n00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,849\nAll right, so Pareto diagrams,\nthey look complex but\n\n731\n00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:02,248\nthey're really not very hard at all.\n\n732\n00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:07,480\nAll right, histograms.\n\n733\n00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,150\nHistograms are another combination\nwhere we've got a bar chart,\n\n734\n00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,110\nreally that's the histogram\nis the bar chart.\n\n735\n00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:18,170\nThey've done a,\nlike a trend analysis here, and\n\n736\n00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,340\nthat's not truly part of the histogram.\n\n737\n00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,620\nYou can have that if you want.\n\n738\n00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,030\nBut the bar chart is the histogram.\n\n739\n00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,630\nAnd again, we're just ranking instances\nof typically a particular defect.\n\n740\n00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,055\nAnd this might be over time\nthat we have that defect.\n\n741\n00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:33,340\nIt depends on how you wanna map it.\n\n742\n00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,120\nI'll give you an example.\n\n743\n00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,410\nI have a friend who,\nit's an odd business, but\n\n744\n00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,040\nhe makes his living\nmanufacturing cowboy hats.\n\n745\n00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,310\nHe hand makes leather cowboy hats.\n\n746\n00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,950\nApparently there's a market for this.\n\n747\n00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,650\nAnd he sells them for\nridiculous amounts of money.\n\n748\n00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,290\nI've never worn a cowboy hat,\nnor do I ever intend to.\n\n749\n00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,170\nBut this is what he does.\n\n750\n00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,610\nAnd he hand makes them.\n\n751\n00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,390\nHe makes them himself by hand,\nwhich is impressive.\n\n752\n00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,260\nAnd when he does it, he uses wooden molds.\n\n753\n00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,310\nSo if he's gonna make a size\nseven-and-a-quarter hat,\n\n754\n00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,860\nhe's got a wooden mold for\nsize seven-and-a-quarter.\n\n755\n00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,195\nAnd if it's gonna be seven and\nthree-quarters, he has got a seven and\n\n756\n00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:11,440\nthree-quarters mold for that.\n\n757\n00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,183\nSo he's got these little wooden, they're\nnot heads cuz they're shaped weird,\n\n758\n00:38:15,183 --> 00:38:17,420\ncuz he actually shapes\nthe leather around that.\n\n759\n00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,630\nSo it's more shaped like\na cowboy hat would be.\n\n760\n00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,140\nSo anyways,\nhe's got these molds that he uses.\n\n761\n00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,900\nWell the problem is they're wood.\n\n762\n00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,130\nAnd after he makes a few\nhundred hats on the mold,\n\n763\n00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,170\nthe leather starts to wear the wood down.\n\n764\n00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,650\nAnd that seven-and-three-quarters hat all\nthe sudden becomes a seven-and-a-half.\n\n765\n00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,320\nAnd then as he works on it even longer,\n\n766\n00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,210\nthat seven-and-a-half becomes\na seven-and-one-quarter, right.\n\n767\n00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,776\nThe mold gets smaller and smaller and\nsmaller as it wears down.\n\n768\n00:38:43,776 --> 00:38:47,090\nYou see there's some blue jeans,\nwe'll stick with the blue jeans example.\n\n769\n00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:51,917\nIf you go to the store and\nyou grab three pairs of size 32 jeans,\n\n770\n00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:57,575\n32 waist, some of them might be size 32,\nsome might be 33, some might be 31.\n\n771\n00:38:57,575 --> 00:39:02,385\nThere is an acceptable deviation from\nthat measurement that they allowed, and\n\n772\n00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:03,505\nstill sell it out there.\n\n773\n00:39:03,505 --> 00:39:07,305\nThat's why two identical measured\njeans might fit differently,\n\n774\n00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:09,587\nbecause of those\ntolerances at the factory.\n\n775\n00:39:09,587 --> 00:39:12,657\nSo what Patrick had to do with his hats,\n\n776\n00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:17,897\nis as he manufactured them, at the end\nof each day, he had to measure the mold.\n\n777\n00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,207\nAnd there was a certain\ndeviation he would allow,\n\n778\n00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:25,250\nwhere it might not be\nexactly seven-and-a-quarter.\n\n779\n00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,415\nIt might be seven-and-three-eighths,\nright.\n\n780\n00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:32,020\nJust a little bit more\nthan seven-and-one-fourth.\n\n781\n00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,955\nSo if that was the case, he'd still\nsell it as a seven-and-a-quarter,\n\n782\n00:39:35,955 --> 00:39:37,086\nit was okay, right.\n\n783\n00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:40,094\nBut once it deviated far enough,\nhe would then re-label\n\n784\n00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:44,660\nthat mold to be the different size, and\nnow it would work for that different size.\n\n785\n00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,590\nSo with a histogram like this\nwe can start to chart that.\n\n786\n00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,870\nThat how long does it take for\nthat mold to wear down, and\n\n787\n00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,554\nto start manufacturing a different size.\n\n788\n00:39:54,554 --> 00:39:58,110\nYou know, on day one,\nit was manufacturing hats at this size.\n\n789\n00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,530\nOn day two, here's our deviation\nas we start to creep up.\n\n790\n00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,650\nAnd so, then we replace the mold.\n\n791\n00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,490\nWe move it,\nwe swap it with something else.\n\n792\n00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,087\nSo, you might have one that\njust goes continually up.\n\n793\n00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:10,592\nYou might have one that goes like this,\nthat goes up and\n\n794\n00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,996\nthen down based on what it\nis that we're working on.\n\n795\n00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,547\nI might say over a course of a day,\n\n796\n00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:20,206\nit manufactured this many hats\nthat were at these two sizes.\n\n797\n00:40:20,206 --> 00:40:22,829\nBut these other sizes were outliers right?\n\n798\n00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:26,109\nAt the beginning of the day\nwhen the mold was nice and\n\n799\n00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:30,835\ncool it was manufacturing down at this\nsize and as it warmed up it started to\n\n800\n00:40:30,835 --> 00:40:34,740\ndefect into higher sizes and\nso we may map that out too.\n\n801\n00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,000\nBut a histogram is a simple tool.\n\n802\n00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,161\nIt's just a bar chart that maps that out.\n\n803\n00:40:41,877 --> 00:40:44,060\nNow I mentioned tolerances.\n\n804\n00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,220\nOkay.\n\n805\n00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,530\nIn manufacturing, you've got tolerances.\n\n806\n00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,270\nYou have what are called control limits.\n\n807\n00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,600\nAnd basically what you say is when\nyou manufacture something you know\n\n808\n00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,550\nthat it's not always going\nto be exactly the same.\n\n809\n00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,240\nIt's very difficult to\nreproduce something exactly.\n\n810\n00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,720\nAnd, so what you're normally\ngoing to have is a target, right?\n\n811\n00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,610\nHere's our average, our target,\nthat we're trying to hit.\n\n812\n00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:10,580\nAnd, then as you manufacture, some\nthings might hit the target perfectly.\n\n813\n00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,680\nSome might go over, some might go under,\nthey get close but not perfect.\n\n814\n00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,986\nSo I want those pairs of jeans\nto have a 32-inch waistline,\n\n815\n00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:21,950\nthat's what I want a 32.\n\n816\n00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,680\nOkay.\n\n817\n00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,525\nBut I might get some that are a 33 or\n\n818\n00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:29,940\na 31 you know as long as they're close\nit's good enough I can sell it that way.\n\n819\n00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,920\nRight it's meeting my tolerance.\n\n820\n00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,360\nSo if we have a tolerance like that.\n\n821\n00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,730\nIt's important that we establish it\nearly on in our quality management plan.\n\n822\n00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:43,810\nAnd we specify what we call an upper\ncontrol limit and a lower control limit.\n\n823\n00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,400\nA UCL and a LCL.\n\n824\n00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,430\nThe upper control limit is the most\nin a positive direction we can\n\n825\n00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,840\ndeviate from the norm and still sell\nthe product as not being defective.\n\n826\n00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,380\nOnce you cross that limit,\nnow you're defective, right.\n\n827\n00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,190\nAnd you're lower control limit,\nsame thing.\n\n828\n00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,400\nThe farthest negative you\ncan deviate from the norm\n\n829\n00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,660\nwithout being considered a defect, right.\n\n830\n00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,200\nAnd in most manufacturing you do\nhave an acceptable window a plus or\n\n831\n00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,100\nminus window that you can fall into.\n\n832\n00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,540\nAnd still be an acceptable product.\n\n833\n00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,860\nIf this is engineering, you might\nhave two parts that fit together.\n\n834\n00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,630\nAnd they fit together fine as long as\nthey're within a few millimeters of\n\n835\n00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,090\nmeasurement from each other.\n\n836\n00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:25,940\nBut if they get more than four millimeters\ndifferent, then it's too far apart and\n\n837\n00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,340\nthey're not gonna fit together right.\n\n838\n00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,690\nThey're gonna have uneven wear and\ncause breakage.\n\n839\n00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,420\nIn those cases we need\nto measure that out.\n\n840\n00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,780\nThis is going to vary\nfrom project to project.\n\n841\n00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,590\nWhatever it is that you're dealing with\nyou'll have these acceptable limits.\n\n842\n00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,390\nNow, here they are talking\nabout call wait times.\n\n843\n00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,560\nThey have a call center, and\n\n844\n00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,970\nif someone calls in they only want\nthem to wait on average 15 seconds.\n\n845\n00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:54,890\nSo if somebody calls in, they want that\nphone to be answered within 15 seconds.\n\n846\n00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:58,760\nAnd they set an upper limit of, what do\nyou think that is Ryan, like 23 seconds or\n\n847\n00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,410\nsomething?\n\n848\n00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,120\n>> Yeah.\n\n849\n00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,641\n>> Saying that if it takes as\nlong as 23 seconds we're okay.\n\n850\n00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:06,549\nIf it takes as little as\nseven seconds we're okay.\n\n851\n00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:11,247\nBut if we deviate above that,\nif it takes too long to answer the phone,\n\n852\n00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:13,340\nwe have a problem, right?\n\n853\n00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,110\nIf we answer the phone too fast,\nwe have a problem.\n\n854\n00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:18,680\nThat might sound crazy, but then maybe\nthat makes your company sound desperate.\n\n855\n00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,830\nYou answer the phone right away.\n\n856\n00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,640\nSo that's just not long enough.\n\n857\n00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,000\nSo we set these limits of what we consider\nacceptable and we monitor our trend.\n\n858\n00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,460\nYou might notice here that\nthey didn't do the trend, but\n\n859\n00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,860\nif you look at this, notice how we start\nkinda below here and we're really below.\n\n860\n00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,560\nAnd they we start kind of creeping up,\nand now we're no so much below anymore.\n\n861\n00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,490\nAnd towards the end of this,\nsee how we're not very far below at all.\n\n862\n00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,940\nThere's a general trend here of going up.\n\n863\n00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,550\nSo our average way call,\nif we were to map that trend,\n\n864\n00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:55,830\nis slowly creeping up, meaning our\nwait times are starting to increase.\n\n865\n00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,080\nNow, this is being done over\nthey just show 20 samples.\n\n866\n00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,700\nI don't know what that is right,\nmaybe this is 20 days.\n\n867\n00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:07,150\nSo over 20 days I've got a general\ntrend of increasing call wait times.\n\n868\n00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,820\nSo is I map this out,\nhow many days is it going to be\n\n869\n00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,590\nbefore this general trend\nhits my upper control limit?\n\n870\n00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,900\nSo we can use this to\nkinda predict the future.\n\n871\n00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,950\nIf this trend stays the same,\ntwo years from now,\n\n872\n00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,620\nI'm gonna hit my upper control limit,\nokay?\n\n873\n00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,230\nAnd so I can make plans for that.\n\n874\n00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:25,850\nI can say, you know what?\n\n875\n00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,700\nTwo years from now, I'm gonna need\nto add some more phone reps so\n\n876\n00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,900\nthat we can get that call wait time down,\nright?\n\n877\n00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,345\nThat's what this stuff is all about,\nis kind of planning for that eventuality.\n\n878\n00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:42,510\nAll right, and then the last of our\nseven tools the Scatter Diagrams.\n\n879\n00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,000\nScatter Diagrams are where I\ndo my statistical samples.\n\n880\n00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,990\nIf I'm manufacturing 1000 pairs of jeans,\nI don't want to go out and\n\n881\n00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,110\nlook at every single pair.\n\n882\n00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:54,760\nSo maybe I grab every tenth pair,\nor every 100th pair.\n\n883\n00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,140\nAnd I throw it on a diagram or I map.\n\n884\n00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,280\nHere they're doing temperature\nversus pounds per square inch.\n\n885\n00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,930\nAnd so we map what that is.\n\n886\n00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,450\nSo here, what would you measure\ntemperature and PSI for?\n\n887\n00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,170\nAn engine maybe?\n\n888\n00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:07,910\nSo.\n>> Could be yeah.\n\n889\n00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,460\n>> Like compression on an engine.\n\n890\n00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,090\n>> Yeah.\n>> I don't know.\n\n891\n00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,000\nWhatever it is.\n\n892\n00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,302\nSo we would measure these two values and\nchart it out.\n\n893\n00:45:15,302 --> 00:45:21,583\nAnd what you're looking for is again that\ntrend to see where you are on average.\n\n894\n00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:26,170\nAnd then if you have deviation, now see\nthis big deviator down here, this outlier.\n\n895\n00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:26,950\nWhat's going on there?\n\n896\n00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,420\nWhat caused that?\n\n897\n00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,300\nIs there a flaw in my manufacturing\nprocess that led to these, or\n\n898\n00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,260\nis that just something that happened?\n\n899\n00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,110\nAn outlier that we can disregard.\n\n900\n00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:40,350\nSo scatter diagrams help us to plot\nthat and see when we've got deviation.\n\n901\n00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,300\nWith a scatter diagram,\n\n902\n00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,280\nthe goal is to have all of your dots\nbe as close together as possible.\n\n903\n00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,770\nA perfectly working system\nshould only have one point.\n\n904\n00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,230\nEverybody falls at the same point.\n\n905\n00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,370\nBut it's never perfect, right?.\n\n906\n00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:55,320\nSo you'll see it a little more like this,\nwhere it kind of flowers out.\n\n907\n00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,200\nBut if you've got it all over the place,\nthat means a very inconsistent process and\n\n908\n00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,240\nsomething we need to reevaluate.\n\n909\n00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,170\nSo those are our seven tools available for\nquality control.\n\n910\n00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,950\nThey're all pretty common sense.\n\n911\n00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:10,930\nThey're pretty powerful.\n\n912\n00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:13,015\nThe challenging part of the exam\nis just remembering the names,\n\n913\n00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:13,960\ncuz some of them are strange.\n\n914\n00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,220\nThe Pareto Diagram, right?\n\n915\n00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,820\nYou might not be familiar with that one.\n\n916\n00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,080\nAnd then the Cause & Effect diagram,\nbecause it's got three names, right?\n\n917\n00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,190\nAlso a Fishbone,\nalso an Ishikawa, and I think,\n\n918\n00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,710\nRonnie, you had all those in the notes,\nright?\n\n919\n00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:25,640\n>> Yep.\n>> Let me\n\n920\n00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,730\n>> Bring that up.\n\n921\n00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,950\nSo yeah cause and effect also known\nas Fishbone also known as Ishikawa.\n\n922\n00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,000\nSo just be familiar with those names.\n\n923\n00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,199\nThey may turn up on the exam.\n\n924\n00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:40,375\nAll right.\n\n925\n00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:42,175\nSome of the other things\nthat we might see.\n\n926\n00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,165\nThose seven tools, that's the big deal.\n\n927\n00:46:44,165 --> 00:46:45,825\nWe also have benchmarking.\n\n928\n00:46:45,825 --> 00:46:51,895\nBenchmarking is where, maybe we don't know\nexactly how accurate our stuff should be.\n\n929\n00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:53,325\nSo we come up with a benchmark.\n\n930\n00:46:53,325 --> 00:46:57,095\nA goal that we want to hit, and it might\nbe something that we set internally, or\n\n931\n00:46:57,095 --> 00:47:00,165\nwe might reach out to our competitors,\nor other people in our industry and\n\n932\n00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:04,030\nsay, we're manufacturing\na thousand pairs of jeans and\n\n933\n00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,590\nhere's the defect rate\nwe're trying to get to.\n\n934\n00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:11,480\nI wonder what Levi's hits or\nwhat Lee or some other competitor.\n\n935\n00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,440\nWhat defect rate do they have?\n\n936\n00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,040\nAnd we then we kind of work towards\nthat we use that as our benchmark.\n\n937\n00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,390\nWe compare that against what they're\ndoing to see if we're being competitive.\n\n938\n00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,190\nIt might be an internal benchmark.\n\n939\n00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,660\nLast month here's what my defect rate was.\n\n940\n00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,000\nSo this month I want my defect\nrate to be the same, or better.\n\n941\n00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,660\nSo last month's defect rate\nbecomes this month's benchmark.\n\n942\n00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,510\nSo that, kind of,\na goal that we work towards.\n\n943\n00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,480\nAnother tool or technique we\nhave is design of experiments.\n\n944\n00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,560\nThis is a tough one.\n\n945\n00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,060\nIf we are manufacturing blue jeans.\n\n946\n00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,520\nI'm a project manager.\n\n947\n00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,950\nI have project management skills.\n\n948\n00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,300\nDo I have manufacture blue jeans skills?\n\n949\n00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,300\nNo.\nI couldn't do it.\n\n950\n00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,740\nI don't even know how to\nwork a sewing machine.\n\n951\n00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,270\nIf you gave me a pair of blue jeans,\n\n952\n00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:02,696\nam I capable of judging whether or\nnot the blue jeans are up to quality?\n\n953\n00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:04,126\nNo.\nI don't really know what quality\n\n954\n00:48:04,126 --> 00:48:07,483\ncomes down to if you just stick them in my\nhands and tell me to look at them, right?\n\n955\n00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:11,744\nSo what we need Is to come up with tests.\n\n956\n00:48:11,744 --> 00:48:15,640\nTests to evaluate\nthe quality of our product.\n\n957\n00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,761\nSo, we're typically gonna bring\nin a subject matter expert.\n\n958\n00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:22,092\nAnd they're gonna do\ndesign of experiments.\n\n959\n00:48:22,092 --> 00:48:26,890\nAnd that just means they're going\nto create the tests that we use.\n\n960\n00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,010\nAnd it could be as simple as a checklist.\n\n961\n00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,380\nYou look at the jeans,\nyou do a checklist, right?\n\n962\n00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,920\nYou ever buy a new pair of jeans, and\nyou stick your hand in your pocket, and\n\n963\n00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,200\nyou pull out a sticker that says,\ninspected by 47, right?\n\n964\n00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,259\nThat means that there was a quality\nassurance person at the factory,\n\n965\n00:48:41,259 --> 00:48:45,146\nwhose ID number is 47, who had\na checklist, that looked at your pair of\n\n966\n00:48:45,146 --> 00:48:48,870\njeans and said your pair of jeans\nmet their checklist requirements.\n\n967\n00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:51,308\nThat's usually all\nthe experimentation we get.\n\n968\n00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:52,086\nAll right.\n\n969\n00:48:52,086 --> 00:48:55,198\nIt might be a lot more sophisticated.\n\n970\n00:48:55,198 --> 00:49:00,492\nThere is a, I did a little bit of work for\na road paving company.\n\n971\n00:49:00,492 --> 00:49:03,173\nAnd, when they would pave the road,\nI don't think much about them.\n\n972\n00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,242\nJust put down asphalt.\n\n973\n00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:05,216\nDraw some lines on it.\n\n974\n00:49:05,216 --> 00:49:05,890\nThey're done.\n\n975\n00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,167\nEasiest job in the world, right?\n\n976\n00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:12,385\nWell, when they manufacture that asphalt,\nthey have a number of chemical experiments\n\n977\n00:49:12,385 --> 00:49:16,758\nthey perform on it to make sure that\nit meets certain consistency levels,\n\n978\n00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:20,073\nthat the components are mixed\nin the right quantities,\n\n979\n00:49:20,073 --> 00:49:22,701\nand that it will withstand\nthe test of time.\n\n980\n00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:27,700\nAnd so, every batch of asphalt that they\nmanufacture has to meet these tests, and\n\n981\n00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,409\nthey have a chemist on staff\nthat actually does those tests.\n\n982\n00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:33,939\nVery sophisticated, way more\nsophisticated than I thought it was.\n\n983\n00:49:33,939 --> 00:49:39,710\nAnd then after they lay it, they have\na radioactive depth measurement tool.\n\n984\n00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,610\nThey go through and\nthey can measure the density and\n\n985\n00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,000\nthe depth of the asphalt at any point.\n\n986\n00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,780\nSo, they do these measurements every so\n\n987\n00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,630\nmany feet to evaluate how\ndense that asphalt is.\n\n988\n00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,624\nThey're doing that because if they don't,\n\n989\n00:49:52,624 --> 00:49:57,203\nthe road is gonna wear down early,\nand sinkholes are going to occur.\n\n990\n00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:00,814\nAnd so, if that happens, they're gonna\nhave to get back out and fix them, and\n\n991\n00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:02,805\nit's tough to shut down\na road to fix them.\n\n992\n00:50:02,805 --> 00:50:06,671\nAnd, it's even more tough to have a city\nthat has the funding to repair the roads\n\n993\n00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,182\nas we see here in Gainesville.\n\n994\n00:50:08,182 --> 00:50:10,109\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it's like pothole city out there.\n\n995\n00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:11,154\n>> Yeah.\n\n996\n00:50:11,154 --> 00:50:13,313\n>> So, that's design of experiments.\n\n997\n00:50:13,313 --> 00:50:15,340\nSomebody's got to create these tests.\n\n998\n00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,550\nWe create the tests in the planning\nphase but we don't use them.\n\n999\n00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:22,970\nWe use them in the monitoring and\ncontrolling phase.\n\n1000\n00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:26,260\nStatistical sampling,\nI've already talked about a few times now.\n\n1001\n00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,750\nAnd that is, you can't test everything.\n\n1002\n00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,690\nWell, you can,\nif you have enough time and resources.\n\n1003\n00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:31,960\nBut for most of us,\n\n1004\n00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:38,530\nwe grab a sample that is big enough\nto be statistically significant.\n\n1005\n00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:42,430\nAnd if you get too small of a sampling\npool, then it's not gonna be significant.\n\n1006\n00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,030\nThe numbers aren't gonna be realistic.\n\n1007\n00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,700\nSo, you gotta get enough that it is and\n\n1008\n00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,680\nit just comes down to what\nyour acceptable error rate is.\n\n1009\n00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,670\nBut you collect some samples.\n\n1010\n00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:54,335\nYou do your testing based in on that,\nand then you extrapolate that out, and\n\n1011\n00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,345\nyou say all right, if 1 out of 100\nare defective, then 100 out of 1,000\n\n1012\n00:50:58,345 --> 00:51:02,557\nare probably defective, or 1,000 out\nof 10,000 are probably defective.\n\n1013\n00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:07,391\nSo, you can kind of use that\nto evaluate your overall loss.\n\n1014\n00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,860\nAnd then, after that,\nit's kind of left up to us, right?\n\n1015\n00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,082\nAdditional planning tools or\nquality planning tools,\n\n1016\n00:51:13,082 --> 00:51:16,173\nthere are a number of other\nthings that are out there.\n\n1017\n00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:21,337\nSo, we'll see things like brainstorming,\nforce field analysis, right?\n\n1018\n00:51:21,337 --> 00:51:27,168\nYou kind of see what forces are acting\nagainst your tolerances and whether you've\n\n1019\n00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:32,427\ngot things in place to mitigate that or\nwhether you need it to take action.\n\n1020\n00:51:32,427 --> 00:51:35,673\nNominal group technique, I know we've\nalready talked about, as well as,\n\n1021\n00:51:35,673 --> 00:51:37,860\nquality management and control tools.\n\n1022\n00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,070\nAny of the various things that\nwe've seen in our other processes,\n\n1023\n00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,750\nwe've got them here too that we can\nuse as we do our quality planning.\n\n1024\n00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,537\nAnd then, there's meetings, right?\n\n1025\n00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:50,134\nEndless, endless meetings as we\nfigure out our quality needs there.\n\n1026\n00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:51,063\nOkay.\n\n1027\n00:51:51,063 --> 00:51:54,527\nOnce all this is done,\nonce we've leveraged these tools,\n\n1028\n00:51:54,527 --> 00:51:58,837\nwe now know what we need to do to get\nquality in place, now we do it, right?\n\n1029\n00:51:58,837 --> 00:52:02,362\nOur output for this process is gonna\nbe our quality management plan, so\n\n1030\n00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:06,239\nhow we're gonna handle quality, and\nif we already had one, then it might just\n\n1031\n00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:09,560\nbe updates to that plan, so\nwe'll see project document updates.\n\n1032\n00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,340\nBut if we don't, we draft it here.\n\n1033\n00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:16,427\nAnd we keep it generic enough so that we\ncan reuse it in other projects, all right.\n\n1034\n00:52:16,427 --> 00:52:19,678\nWe also see things like\na process improvement plan.\n\n1035\n00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,529\nSo, it might be our\nproduct that's at fault,\n\n1036\n00:52:22,529 --> 00:52:26,320\nit might be the way that we create it,\nyeah the process.\n\n1037\n00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,387\nSo, we need to go in and evaluate that.\n\n1038\n00:52:28,387 --> 00:52:30,347\nAnd if we find improvements\nthat we can make,\n\n1039\n00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,043\nthen we create a plan that says\nhow we're going to improve it.\n\n1040\n00:52:33,043 --> 00:52:36,733\nOr, we create a plan that says how we\nwill evaluate to determine if we can\n\n1041\n00:52:36,733 --> 00:52:37,420\nimprove it.\n\n1042\n00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,315\nWe also have our quality metrics and\nquality checklists.\n\n1043\n00:52:41,315 --> 00:52:44,405\nSo, the metrics, those are all\nthe numbers we're gonna measure against.\n\n1044\n00:52:44,405 --> 00:52:47,312\nWhat is the acceptable deviation for\nour product or\n\n1045\n00:52:47,312 --> 00:52:49,278\nwhatever it is that we're doing?\n\n1046\n00:52:49,278 --> 00:52:52,578\nAnd what are the metrics\nwe're gonna measure?\n\n1047\n00:52:52,578 --> 00:52:53,530\nThe checklists we're gonna check against,\nall right.\n\n1048\n00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:56,825\nWe're creating all of those\nhere in the planning phase.\n\n1049\n00:52:56,825 --> 00:53:00,045\nSo when we're done, we have a collection\nof documents that are ready to rock.\n\n1050\n00:53:00,045 --> 00:53:03,173\nI do have a template or\ntwo I wanted to show you guys.\n\n1051\n00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:07,653\nSo, when we talk about like our\nprocess improvement plan, all right?\n\n1052\n00:53:07,653 --> 00:53:08,827\nLet me bring that up.\n\n1053\n00:53:08,827 --> 00:53:11,760\nSo, we basically describe the process.\n\n1054\n00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,412\nWe describe the starting point,\nthe ending point, the inputs and\n\n1055\n00:53:16,412 --> 00:53:20,316\noutputs of that process,\nas far as its boundaries, and\n\n1056\n00:53:20,316 --> 00:53:24,403\nwe basically just come up with\nways that we can improve it.\n\n1057\n00:53:24,403 --> 00:53:28,901\nSo, what our metrics are and our\ncontrol limits as they stand right now,\n\n1058\n00:53:28,901 --> 00:53:33,059\nwhat we want to improve and\nwhat we're proposing to improve them.\n\n1059\n00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:34,640\nAll right,\nhow is our improvement approach?\n\n1060\n00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,340\nAre we evaluating it\nevery couple of weeks,\n\n1061\n00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,530\nevery couple of months to see\nif there's something we can do?\n\n1062\n00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:43,415\nAre we evaluating new technologies to see\nif there's improvements, or new equipment?\n\n1063\n00:53:43,415 --> 00:53:46,437\nWhat it is that we are going\nto be looking to do for that?\n\n1064\n00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:48,829\nAnd then, if you want,\nyou can attach a flow chart.\n\n1065\n00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:52,805\nSo, this is what a process\nimprovement plan looks like.\n\n1066\n00:53:52,805 --> 00:53:56,312\nIt's documenting not only how\nthe process is right now, but\n\n1067\n00:53:56,312 --> 00:54:00,116\nwhat we're doing to evaluate\nthose improvements down the road.\n\n1068\n00:54:03,037 --> 00:54:06,077\nAll right, and\nthen there's our quality metrics,\n\n1069\n00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:10,390\nwhere we document what it is we're\nmonitoring, the item, right?\n\n1070\n00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,460\nAnd then what the metric is.\n\n1071\n00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,510\nAnd remember the metric could be money or\ntime, but\n\n1072\n00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,640\nit's most commonly requirements, right?\n\n1073\n00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,727\nDifferent features that we expect it to\nhave, and what is the metric for it, and\n\n1074\n00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:23,073\nthe measurement method?\n\n1075\n00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:25,997\nSo, if it's manufacturing the blue jeans,\nand\n\n1076\n00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:28,850\nyou have a waist size\nthat you're monitoring,\n\n1077\n00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:33,578\nour metric is I want to be plus or minus\none inch from the advertised waist size.\n\n1078\n00:54:33,578 --> 00:54:37,903\nSo, if I say it's a 32, it can be\nas low as a 31, or as high as a 33,\n\n1079\n00:54:37,903 --> 00:54:40,591\nand we'll still call it a 32, all right?\n\n1080\n00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:44,315\nThe measurement method, take a tape\nmeasure, and measure the inseam or\n\n1081\n00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:46,645\nthe waistline of that pair of jeans,\nright?\n\n1082\n00:54:46,645 --> 00:54:49,027\nSo, we just designate how we're going\nto measure that and what's acceptable,\n\n1083\n00:54:49,027 --> 00:54:49,700\nwhat's that metric.\n\n1084\n00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,182\nAnd then, our quality management plan that\nwe output, very similar to the process\n\n1085\n00:54:57,182 --> 00:55:01,470\nimprovement plan because we're specifying\nwhat is our quality planning approach?\n\n1086\n00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,310\nHow do we plan for it?\n\n1087\n00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,370\nWhat are we going to get ready for\nquality?\n\n1088\n00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:07,040\nWhat is our quality assurance approach?\n\n1089\n00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,070\nHow do we determine what we do ahead of\ntime versus we put off to deal with later?\n\n1090\n00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:14,430\nQuality control.\n\n1091\n00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,690\nHow do we determine what to deal\nwith later as opposed to dealing\n\n1092\n00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,810\nwith ahead of time, right?\n\n1093\n00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,590\nSo, this is not saying exactly what we're\ngonna do cuz this is our plan, right?\n\n1094\n00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:26,400\nBut how we determine what we're going\nto be doing is quality assurance and\n\n1095\n00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,790\nquality control.\n\n1096\n00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,260\nSame thing with quality improvement.\n\n1097\n00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,770\nIf we see our quality is\nnot at the level we want,\n\n1098\n00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:34,070\nwhat are the steps we can\ntake to improve upon it?\n\n1099\n00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:37,904\nThese are all documents that we\nshould have nice generic ones for\n\n1100\n00:55:37,904 --> 00:55:42,743\nour company to reuse but then we create\nspecific ones that deal with our project.\n\n1101\n00:55:42,743 --> 00:55:44,365\nWhat it is that we're going to be doing,\n\n1102\n00:55:44,365 --> 00:55:47,484\nwithin the boundaries of this project\nspecifically to improve those areas.\n\n1103\n00:55:49,598 --> 00:55:54,003\nAll right, and remember I'll be posting\nall these templates with the episode,\n\n1104\n00:55:54,003 --> 00:55:56,657\nso by the time you guys\nare seeing this recorded,\n\n1105\n00:55:56,657 --> 00:56:00,637\nthey'll be right there on the site,\nprobably in the course resources.\n\n1106\n00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:03,972\nAll right, so\nthat pretty much wraps up quality, Ronnie.\n\n1107\n00:56:03,972 --> 00:56:07,570\nI'm trying to think if there's anything\nelse on quality we need to tack on to.\n\n1108\n00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:11,902\nI do apologize, if any of you guys\nout there are, if you have a masters\n\n1109\n00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:16,608\nin quality management, you know there\nis a lot more, but as far as the PMI is\n\n1110\n00:56:16,608 --> 00:56:21,380\nconcerned, as far as the exam is\nconcerned, those are the main areas.\n\n1111\n00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,370\nWe are gonna talk a little bit more about\nprocess improvement when we get into\n\n1112\n00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,160\nexecution, cause we do have\nto talk about Deming and\n\n1113\n00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,040\na couple of the other people that\nare big names in the quality world.\n\n1114\n00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:36,630\nBut, for right now as far as planning is\nconcerned those are our general things.\n\n1115\n00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,830\n>> That's good.\n\n1116\n00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,260\n>> All right, well let's stop here and\ntake a break.\n\n1117\n00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,860\nWe've got a lot more to get\nthrough in this episode.\n\n1118\n00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:44,560\nWe're gonna start taking a look at human\nresources and communications also.\n\n1119\n00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,665\nSo stay tuned and\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n1120\n00:56:46,665 --> 00:56:50,223\n[NOISE] All right,\n\n1121\n00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:55,922\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n1122\n00:56:55,922 --> 00:56:58,587\nSo now that we've wrapped up quality,\n\n1123\n00:56:58,587 --> 00:57:03,930\nwe're ready to move into our next\nknowledge area which is, human resources.\n\n1124\n00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:08,208\nWe've got to plan our human resource\nmanagement plan, and stuff.\n\n1125\n00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:12,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I know I talk about in cost.\n\n1126\n00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,880\nHow we had to worry about\nthings like materials, right?\n\n1127\n00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,980\nAnd you have to worry about personnel,\nlabor cost, and so on,\n\n1128\n00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,070\nas we evaluate how much each activity\nin or project is gonna cost.\n\n1129\n00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:26,380\nWell a part of that was a little\nuncertain, because I said, it's\n\n1130\n00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:30,570\nhard to figure out labor when you don't\nknow who your people are going to be.\n\n1131\n00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:34,320\nSo in early planning stages of our\nproject, we probably have a lot of\n\n1132\n00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,810\nplaceholder people, or silhouettes,\nghosts, whatever you wanna call them.\n\n1133\n00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:42,140\nSo I might have web developer one,\nweb developer two, web developer three.\n\n1134\n00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:48,070\nWell, at some point, I've got to get\nactual people to fill those holes and\n\n1135\n00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:51,670\nthose people will have different\nsalary requirements and needs.\n\n1136\n00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:56,020\nSo we have the human resources\nmanagement knowledge area,\n\n1137\n00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,660\nwhich centers around,\nhow we get those people,\n\n1138\n00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,370\nhow we get them attached to the project,\nand how we handle them.\n\n1139\n00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:04,660\nBecause people, unfortunately,\ndo need to be handled.\n\n1140\n00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,320\nSo let me just bring up\nmy process management,\n\n1141\n00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,880\nI mean my process groups chart here.\n\n1142\n00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,110\nAnd so\nwe just wrapped up quality management, and\n\n1143\n00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:15,650\nnow we're moving into\nhuman resource management.\n\n1144\n00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,760\nNow you'll notice this\nis not a very big area,\n\n1145\n00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,120\nand that's because most organizations\nhave a human resources team, or\n\n1146\n00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,440\nmost environments have a PMO,\na project management office,\n\n1147\n00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,300\nwhich is handling that\nassignment of human resources.\n\n1148\n00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,400\nSo we may not need this much at all.\n\n1149\n00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,290\nNow, you are gonna need develop\na project team, manage a project team.\n\n1150\n00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:37,950\nYou're always gonna need those.\n\n1151\n00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:41,230\nBut doing the human resource\nmanagement plan and\n\n1152\n00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,940\nacquiring the project team, those two\nmight actually be taken care of for\n\n1153\n00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,340\nus by other entities in our company,\nall right?\n\n1154\n00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,690\nBut let's say they aren't.\n\n1155\n00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:52,608\nIf they aren't well, we need to get that\nhuman resource management plan in place.\n\n1156\n00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:54,185\nAnd so we've got a process for that.\n\n1157\n00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,935\nWe'll take a look at what's here.\n\n1158\n00:58:56,935 --> 00:59:00,475\nFirst off if we already have a plan,\nit will be in our project management plan.\n\n1159\n00:59:00,475 --> 00:59:01,625\nThat'll be an input for us.\n\n1160\n00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,885\nWe go and we get it.\n\n1161\n00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:06,715\nIf we don't,\nit's up to us to create our own.\n\n1162\n00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:09,660\nSo we take a look Some of\nthe various other things we have.\n\n1163\n00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,700\nThe main thing being activity\nresource requirements.\n\n1164\n00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,840\nI need to look at the activities\nthat we charted out before, and\n\n1165\n00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,040\nI need to figure out what they need.\n\n1166\n00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,030\nI need web developer one,\nweb developer two, web developer three.\n\n1167\n00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:23,650\nI got to put some people in those places.\n\n1168\n00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,310\nSo we go and gather all that together.\n\n1169\n00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,840\nWe may have enterprise\nenvironmental factors.\n\n1170\n00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,890\nNow, in the past, I've said these\nare like standards, and regulations.\n\n1171\n00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:37,450\nWell, when it comes to human resources,\nthis is super important.\n\n1172\n00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:41,890\nMany countries, the US included,\nhave labor limitations.\n\n1173\n00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:44,560\nYou know, a certain amount of\nhours people are allowed to work.\n\n1174\n00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,670\nYou might have guidelines\nwithin your own company,\n\n1175\n00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:50,870\nthat say people can't work over forty\nhours before they go into overtime.\n\n1176\n00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,780\nYou know they get Saturday and\nSunday off, we're closed whatever it is\n\n1177\n00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:58,670\nthat in your company that is part of\nyour enterprise environmental factors.\n\n1178\n00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:02,850\nThen organizational process assets,\nthat's going to include any templates and\n\n1179\n01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:06,430\nhistorical data of other projects\nthat have dealt with this as well as,\n\n1180\n01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:09,700\nin a lot of cases,\nthe employee documentation.\n\n1181\n01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,000\nWho works for your company,\n\n1182\n01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,080\nwho you have available, cuz you might\nhave to contract out to get some people.\n\n1183\n01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,580\nYou might not have them internally.\n\n1184\n01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,620\nAll right.\nSo once we've got that data together,\n\n1185\n01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:19,540\nwe're ready to work with it.\n\n1186\n01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,880\nThere's not too much to go on here, right?\n\n1187\n01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,100\nHopefully, we have organizational\ncharts and position descriptions.\n\n1188\n01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,320\nIf I know I need a web developer,\n\n1189\n01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:32,580\nI should have a company directory where I\ncan identify who my web developers are.\n\n1190\n01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,650\nAnd I should be able to look at that\nchart to figure who their boss is.\n\n1191\n01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:39,940\nSo I can go to their boss, and I can say,\nhey, I'm Don, I'm the project manager for\n\n1192\n01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,740\nour new online mortgage payment project.\n\n1193\n01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,900\nAnd, as part of this,\nI'm gonna need two web developers for\n\n1194\n01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,820\napproximately 60 hours of work.\n\n1195\n01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,190\nDo you have somebody available?\n\n1196\n01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,600\nCan I get them?\n\n1197\n01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,730\nCan I bring them in and\nget them as part of the project?\n\n1198\n01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:57,320\nIf they say yes, you're coordinating\nwith that functional manager to get and\n\n1199\n01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,930\nsecure that personnel.\n\n1200\n01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:01,120\nIf they say no, then you say,\nokay that's cool.\n\n1201\n01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,660\nI'm going to have to contract them.\n\n1202\n01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,100\nSo, then they'll bring in some contractors\nand bring them in place to do this work.\n\n1203\n01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,530\nSo, we're establishing that.\n\n1204\n01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,080\nWe're trying to figure out what we need.\n\n1205\n01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,050\nThe organization charts are what\nare going to help with that.\n\n1206\n01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:15,090\nNow, remember, gee, what was it Ronnie?\n\n1207\n01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:19,929\nLike episode two where we did\nthe functional organization matrices and\n\n1208\n01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:20,930\nstuff.\n\n1209\n01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:23,490\nYou know,\nyou might have a Projectized company,\n\n1210\n01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:27,200\nyou might have a functional company,\nyou might have a matrix company.\n\n1211\n01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,830\nSo, as a Project manager,\nyou might already have the authority\n\n1212\n01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:34,630\nto get these people, you might not, you\nmight have to ask a Functional Manager.\n\n1213\n01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:39,060\nThat's where those organizational\ncharts come in handy, also, all right?\n\n1214\n01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,200\nNetworking.\n\n1215\n01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,850\nNetworking is getting to know people,\nright?\n\n1216\n01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:45,480\nHobnobbing, bumping elbows\nat community events.\n\n1217\n01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,480\nIf you need some web developers,\nhow do you find them?\n\n1218\n01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,100\nWell, it might be that you're a part of\na technical group, or something like that.\n\n1219\n01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,610\nWhere you've met web developers that\nare out there in the community.\n\n1220\n01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,140\nSo if you're looking for a contractor,\nyou're not just trying to guess.\n\n1221\n01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,155\nYou have people that you can go to.\n\n1222\n01:02:00,155 --> 01:02:03,135\nWe actually just did this for\nIT Pro TV not too long ago.\n\n1223\n01:02:03,135 --> 01:02:04,645\nWe needed help with some of our marketing.\n\n1224\n01:02:04,645 --> 01:02:06,210\nWe are terrible marketers.\n\n1225\n01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:06,835\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1226\n01:02:06,835 --> 01:02:10,105\n>> We don't send out huge amounts\nof advertisements and things.\n\n1227\n01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:12,480\nSo we said, we really need somebody.\n\n1228\n01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,520\nAnd instead of going out, and\n\n1229\n01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,290\ntrying to find them on our own,\nwe went to a conference.\n\n1230\n01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,290\nWe went to this conference where\nthere were tons of marketers, and so\n\n1231\n01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,650\nwe could shake their hands,\ntalk to them, and\n\n1232\n01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:23,620\nget a good feel of who would be right for\nus.\n\n1233\n01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,380\nAnd so that's something that's very handy.\n\n1234\n01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,390\nThat's all a part of networking.\n\n1235\n01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,210\n>> Right.\n\n1236\n01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,160\n>> And\nyou don't just do networking externally,\n\n1237\n01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,960\nyou do networking internally too.\n\n1238\n01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,170\nIf you're relying on resources\ncoming from a functional manager,\n\n1239\n01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:36,940\nyou need to know them.\n\n1240\n01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,820\nYou need to go sit down,\nhave lunch with them.\n\n1241\n01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:42,430\nTalk to them, get a good idea of\nwho they are, how they work, and\n\n1242\n01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:43,340\nwhat their requirements are.\n\n1243\n01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:47,330\nOrganizational theory is another one.\n\n1244\n01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:52,030\nNow this is a big one, and if we dive in,\nRonnie did good notes on this stuff.\n\n1245\n01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:56,230\nOrganizational theory, it's a big deal.\n\n1246\n01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:59,510\nSo, we're basically saying that there\nare a number of different ways that we can\n\n1247\n01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:03,570\norganize our companies, like that\nfunctional and project eyes and all that.\n\n1248\n01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,030\nAnd so we need to make sure that we've got\n\n1249\n01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,630\na good grasp of how our\ncompany is organized.\n\n1250\n01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:12,290\nAnd then when we bring in\nemployees into our project,\n\n1251\n01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:14,990\nwe're creating like a microcosm,\na small company.\n\n1252\n01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:19,610\nSo we have a different organizational\nstructure inside of the project than we do\n\n1253\n01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:22,530\nin our company ourself, and\nwe have to be Aware of that.\n\n1254\n01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:26,570\nAnd you know I was leading\ninto the RACI diagram, but\n\n1255\n01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:30,160\nI see that you've already got that\nup here so I skipped over it.\n\n1256\n01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,830\nSo I did talk about the matrix-based,\nand hierarchical stuff, so that's good.\n\n1257\n01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:37,880\nBut one other thing that we might\nbe doing as we develop this,\n\n1258\n01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,980\nis what's called a R-A-C-I,\nor RACI diagram.\n\n1259\n01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:46,680\nWhich is responsible, accountable,\nconsult, and informed.\n\n1260\n01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,010\nIt's a chart of people, and\n\n1261\n01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:52,600\nwe designate what role they're\nperforming inside of our organization.\n\n1262\n01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:57,069\nAnd I've got a template for this,\nlet me see if I've got that handy here.\n\n1263\n01:03:57,069 --> 01:04:00,140\nI think I had it open this morning,\nwhich was, here we go,\n\n1264\n01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,784\nresponsibility assignment.\n\n1265\n01:04:01,784 --> 01:04:05,269\nSo this is what a RACI diagram looks like.\n\n1266\n01:04:05,269 --> 01:04:07,332\nBasically you have your work packages.\n\n1267\n01:04:07,332 --> 01:04:09,830\nThese are from your work break\ndown structure, your WBS.\n\n1268\n01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,489\nSo here's stuff that needs to get done.\n\n1269\n01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:14,747\nAnd then up here is a list\nof people that can do it,\n\n1270\n01:04:14,747 --> 01:04:18,420\nperson one through person four, and so on.\n\n1271\n01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,020\nAnd what you do is you designate what\n\n1272\n01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:25,040\nrole that person has in that\nparticular work package.\n\n1273\n01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,720\nAnd so you'll flag them as, and\n\n1274\n01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,530\nyou'll see the little legend down\nhere at the bottom, R is responsible.\n\n1275\n01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:37,800\nThat means if person one has an R for\nWork package one,\n\n1276\n01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,050\nthen down here I can see that they\nare responsible for that work package.\n\n1277\n01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:41,740\nThey've got to do it.\n\n1278\n01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,610\nThey're the ones who have to get it done.\n\n1279\n01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:46,480\nIf it was an A, they're accountable.\n\n1280\n01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,370\nThat means they're not necessarily\nthe one doing the work, but\n\n1281\n01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:52,510\nif it doesn't get done, it's their fault.\n\n1282\n01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:55,810\nSo I might need web developers,\nbut I don't have any.\n\n1283\n01:04:55,810 --> 01:05:01,350\nSo I go to the CIO, the Chief Information\nOfficer and I request from her.\n\n1284\n01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:02,860\nI say, hey,\ncan you give us some web developers.\n\n1285\n01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,020\nAnd she says, sure,\nyou know, I've got them.\n\n1286\n01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,600\nFlag me as the one who's accountable.\n\n1287\n01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,230\nI'll make sure my web\ndevelopers get it done.\n\n1288\n01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:11,680\nAnd so, off you go.\n\n1289\n01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,075\nYou don't even know who\nthe web developers are,\n\n1290\n01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,430\ncuz she's the one who's\nacting as the intermediary.\n\n1291\n01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:16,110\nShe takes care of it.\n\n1292\n01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,080\nShe is accountable.\n\n1293\n01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,150\nAnd then consult.\n\n1294\n01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,160\nThey're not the ones who\nare responsible or accountable.\n\n1295\n01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,500\nThey're not actually doing the work or\neven involved in it.\n\n1296\n01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,370\nBut I am meaning to consult\nwith them about decisions\n\n1297\n01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:28,940\nthat are being made as a part of it.\n\n1298\n01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,790\nThese might be subject matter experts.\n\n1299\n01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:33,940\nThese might be people that\nare high up in the chain, but\n\n1300\n01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,000\naren't the ones that who\nactually do the work.\n\n1301\n01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,490\nAnd so they need to be\nconsulted as we make decisions.\n\n1302\n01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:41,730\nYour project sponsors\nalmost always consult.\n\n1303\n01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:44,850\nAnd then we have inform.\n\n1304\n01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,930\nThey're not involved at all\nin this particular activity.\n\n1305\n01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:52,680\nBut we need to inform them of the status,\nand so if you have a real hands off\n\n1306\n01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,710\nsponsor, or typically the originator,\nthese are the people who just need to be\n\n1307\n01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:59,330\nkept informed to understand\nhow things are going.\n\n1308\n01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:03,070\nAnd so, we can create a diagram\nlike this to try and chart that.\n\n1309\n01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:06,700\nTo keep a list so\nthat we know who to reach out to,\n\n1310\n01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,760\nand how we need to interact with them.\n\n1311\n01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:10,460\nAll right.\n\n1312\n01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:14,130\nSo this is a part of that\nhuman resources plan also.\n\n1313\n01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,780\nAre we going to keep a chart like this?\n\n1314\n01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,210\nPersonally, I don't like these charts,\n\n1315\n01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:22,490\njust because if you have four people on\nyour project, this chart works great.\n\n1316\n01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:24,510\nBut what if you have 400\npeople on your project?\n\n1317\n01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:25,680\nThis chart's useless.\n\n1318\n01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,110\nAnd so, you know, I'll normally do\na slightly different arrangement.\n\n1319\n01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,480\nYou know, basically what I like\nto do is when I do the WBS,\n\n1320\n01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,978\nthe work breakdown structure, in my\nWBS dictionary for each work package,\n\n1321\n01:06:36,978 --> 01:06:41,610\nI've got information detailing that\npackage in the WBS dictionary.\n\n1322\n01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:44,560\nI list who's responsible,\naccountable and so forth in there,\n\n1323\n01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,250\nas part of the WBS dictionary.\n\n1324\n01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:46,750\nYou can do that.\n\n1325\n01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,310\nRemember all this stuff is modular and\nflexible.\n\n1326\n01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:52,860\nThe larger projects are not gonna lend\nthemselves well to a chart like this.\n\n1327\n01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:57,860\nAll right, so\n\n1328\n01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:01,892\nthose are some of the different things\nthat are available to us in there.\n\n1329\n01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:05,700\nWe've got other simple things\nlike expert judgments and\n\n1330\n01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,050\nmeetings that we seen over and over again.\n\n1331\n01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:11,490\nBut basically, we're specifying in\nhere how we're gonna get these people,\n\n1332\n01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:15,650\nhow we know how many people to get, and\nat what process we're going to go through.\n\n1333\n01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:19,750\nThe end result as a human resources\nmanagement plan, which is far less\n\n1334\n01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:24,090\ndetailed than you'd think, because we're\nnot actually getting the people yet, so\n\n1335\n01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:27,930\nit's really detailing what we're\ngoing to do in the future.\n\n1336\n01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:31,600\nWhen it comes time to get people,\nhow do we get them, right?\n\n1337\n01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,400\nThat's what's in our\nresource management plan.\n\n1338\n01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,010\nSo let me pull up a sample of\na resource management plan.\n\n1339\n01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,700\n>> Two down.\n\n1340\n01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,730\n>> Human resource management plan.\n\n1341\n01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,230\nThere we go.\n\n1342\n01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:48,650\nAnd so, what you'll see in here is\nattached to your project, who is attached,\n\n1343\n01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:51,900\nwhat their role is, their responsibility,\ntheir authority, right?\n\n1344\n01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,770\nThese are generally people that are a part\nof like your project management team but\n\n1345\n01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:57,130\nit's also gonna include\nthings like your PMO,\n\n1346\n01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:59,380\nif that's where you're\ngetting people from, or\n\n1347\n01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:02,330\nyour Human Resources Department if\nthat's where you're getting people from.\n\n1348\n01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,270\nYour project organizational structure.\n\n1349\n01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:09,480\nNow notice that's not the company\norganization, it's the project.\n\n1350\n01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,134\nThe project manager is usually\ngonna be at the top of this and\n\n1351\n01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:14,700\nhow people breakdown underneath that.\n\n1352\n01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:20,150\nAnd then the most important part of\nthis plan, the Staffing Management Plan.\n\n1353\n01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:22,740\nHow do you acquire your staff?\n\n1354\n01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:26,550\nIf I need web developer one, two,\nand 3, all right, how do I do it?\n\n1355\n01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:27,890\nWell, in my acquisition plan,\n\n1356\n01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:33,270\nI might put whatever possible\nleverage internal personnel.\n\n1357\n01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,920\nYou'll acquire internal personnel\nthrough the use of a PMO, or\n\n1358\n01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,240\nthrough the functional manager for\nthat appropriate department, right?\n\n1359\n01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:46,090\nAnd then, when not possible,\nperform a request-for-bid process and\n\n1360\n01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:48,200\nbring in contractors to perform that role,\nall right?\n\n1361\n01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,590\nSo I'm laying that out.\n\n1362\n01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:52,140\nUse internal people first.\n\n1363\n01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,760\nIf you can't, then use external\nto move the project forward.\n\n1364\n01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:01,520\nAnd anytime you have staff acquisition,\nit's important that you do staff release.\n\n1365\n01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,970\nAlso, remember these employees, if\nthey're internal employees, they work for\n\n1366\n01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:05,640\nthe company, they don't work for\nyour project.\n\n1367\n01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,430\nAt least not in most cases.\n\n1368\n01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:08,880\nAnd, so in that scenario,\n\n1369\n01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,710\nwhen you're done with them,\nhow do you turn them back in, right?\n\n1370\n01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:13,510\nAnd it sounds really negative,\n\n1371\n01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:16,760\nlike turning in a bowling ball at the\nbowling alley when you're done bowling.\n\n1372\n01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,010\nBut, basically, when you're done with\nthat person, when they're done with their\n\n1373\n01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:23,890\nresponsibilities in the project, they're\nnow free to go work on other projects.\n\n1374\n01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:28,460\nSo you need a formal process for\nreleasing the employee so\n\n1375\n01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:31,690\nthat the company knows they are now\navailable to work on other projects.\n\n1376\n01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:33,010\nYou're not firing them.\n\n1377\n01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:36,190\nYou're just making them available\nagain for other projects.\n\n1378\n01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:40,020\nBut while you've got them locked in,\nwhile you've got them acquired,\n\n1379\n01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,250\nno one else can use them unless you've\ncome up with an agreement there.\n\n1380\n01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:47,580\nFor example, you might secure somebody\nto work part time on your project and so\n\n1381\n01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:50,660\nthey have more time available for\nother responsibilities.\n\n1382\n01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:54,710\nThat is incredibly common.\n\n1383\n01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:59,380\nI was a network manager for\na bank and my team,\n\n1384\n01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:04,520\nmyself and the other network engineers,\nthe way we work is about 50% of our time\n\n1385\n01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,970\nwas spent on projects and 50% of our time\nwas spent on maintenance and operations.\n\n1386\n01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:13,620\nAnd so in any given day, we only had\nhalf our time to work on projects.\n\n1387\n01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:16,970\nThe other time, it was spent maintaining\nand monitoring our networks.\n\n1388\n01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:19,590\nWe were always split\nbetween those two roles.\n\n1389\n01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,960\nVery common, and so you need to make\nsure that's set out in your plan.\n\n1390\n01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,480\nAll right, some of the other\nthings that we might include here.\n\n1391\n01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,750\nIf we're gathering people together\ntheir resource calendars.\n\n1392\n01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,120\nIf we're collecting them, I wouldn't\nnormally put them in a box here.\n\n1393\n01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,610\nThey'd normally be, like,\nattached as appendices.\n\n1394\n01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:38,800\nAny training requirements?\n\n1395\n01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,470\nIt might be that I need personnel and\nI could contract it out, but\n\n1396\n01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:46,280\nI could train somebody\ninternally to meet my need.\n\n1397\n01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,240\nI need to do a cost benefit analysis.\n\n1398\n01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:52,140\nThe advantage of training somebody is that\nthey're then available to help with other\n\n1399\n01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,640\nprojects in the future and\navoid that outsourcing requirement.\n\n1400\n01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,300\nRewards and Recognition.\n\n1401\n01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:04,010\nWhen somebody successfully completes\nthe project, as a project manager,\n\n1402\n01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:08,160\nyou may not have hire/fire and\nevaluation roles.\n\n1403\n01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,110\nYou might not have the authority\nto give somebody a raise, but\n\n1404\n01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:16,200\nby building it into our plan,\nwe can get our sponsor to sign off on it.\n\n1405\n01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,200\nAnd our sponsor may have that authority,\nusually does have that authority.\n\n1406\n01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,710\nSo any kind of rewards, or\n\n1407\n01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,340\nwhatever you might be planning,\nyou build in to your plan.\n\n1408\n01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,810\nThen any regulations and standards,\n\n1409\n01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:34,830\nthis comes right from Enterprise\nEnvironmental Factors, there we go, EEF.\n\n1410\n01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:36,130\nIt comes straight from those.\n\n1411\n01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:38,460\nWe basically punch in anything\nthat we have to live up to.\n\n1412\n01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,940\nAnd safety, right?\n\n1413\n01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,840\nIn the United States, we have OSHA.\n\n1414\n01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,830\nEvery single business, 100% of them,\nhas to comply to the, what is that?\n\n1415\n01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,350\nOccupational Safety and\nHazard Administration?\n\n1416\n01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,160\nThat there we go.\n\n1417\n01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,560\nSo one of the few acronyms\nthat I got on the first try.\n\n1418\n01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,050\nSo those are things that\nwe have to live up to.\n\n1419\n01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:56,040\nWe put those in the plan too.\n\n1420\n01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,125\nYou'll notice that all of this\nis pretty generic, right?\n\n1421\n01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:01,681\nSo if you keep it generic enough,\nthis human resources\n\n1422\n01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:06,180\nplan is then able to apply to all of\nyour projects, you just reuse it.\n\n1423\n01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,160\nSo you typically only have\nto draft this one time, and\n\n1424\n01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,218\nthen just keep it up to date.\n\n1425\n01:12:09,218 --> 01:12:11,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1426\n01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:12,016\n>> All right.\n\n1427\n01:12:12,016 --> 01:12:14,970\nSo that is pretty much\nhuman resources management.\n\n1428\n01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:19,570\nOur outputs of this process\nare the human resource management plans.\n\n1429\n01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:23,120\nWe're not acquiring people yet,\nwe're just planning for it.\n\n1430\n01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,820\nAnd you'll notice that we've got\nplan human resource management here\n\n1431\n01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:26,790\nin planning.\n\n1432\n01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:29,600\nIn execution, you've got acquire the team.\n\n1433\n01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,900\nIf we acquire the team now in planning,\n\n1434\n01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,570\nwe're not ready to start the work\nthat we have them assigned to.\n\n1435\n01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:37,070\nSo we do have a project management team.\n\n1436\n01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:40,240\nNotice over here, it doesn't say\nacquire the project management team.\n\n1437\n01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:44,460\nIt says acquire the project team,\ndevelop the project team.\n\n1438\n01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,410\nThe project management\nteam is already in place.\n\n1439\n01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:52,300\nThey were put in place back here, when we\nwere dealing with our scope and so on.\n\n1440\n01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,540\nIn order to get that stuff going\nonce our charter was signed,\n\n1441\n01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,200\nthat's where we got our\nproject management team.\n\n1442\n01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:02,152\nKeep that in mind,\nthat's pretty much human resources.\n\n1443\n01:13:02,152 --> 01:13:03,885\nAll right.\n\n1444\n01:13:03,885 --> 01:13:05,715\nWe've got one more area\nthat we want to jump into,\n\n1445\n01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:09,565\nwhich is our communications management\nplan, before we wrap up this episode.\n\n1446\n01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:10,295\nSo let's do this.\n\n1447\n01:13:10,295 --> 01:13:13,565\nLet's stop here and\ntake a break and when we get back,\n\n1448\n01:13:13,565 --> 01:13:16,525\nwe're gonna dive into communications and\ntake a look at that.\n\n1449\n01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,755\nKind of see what's involved and\nwe'll wrap up from there.\n\n1450\n01:13:18,755 --> 01:13:23,620\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1451\n01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:27,927\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n1452\n01:13:27,927 --> 01:13:30,717\nSo for our last process this afternoon,\n\n1453\n01:13:30,717 --> 01:13:35,320\nwe're gonna take a look at planning\ncommunications management.\n\n1454\n01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,000\n>> Right.\n\n1455\n01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,130\n>> Now, we talked briefly about\ncommunications back at the very beginning\n\n1456\n01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:41,340\nof the project.\n\n1457\n01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,470\nWe created a stakeholder register,\n\n1458\n01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:46,120\nwhere we listed all\nthe stakeholders of our project.\n\n1459\n01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,260\nAnd we put some basic information\nabout how to communicate with them.\n\n1460\n01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,260\nBut now, we need to refine that.\n\n1461\n01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,680\nA lot of that was done early on in the\nproject, and we've learned a lot more now.\n\n1462\n01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,570\nThe main thing we've learned is that\nwe've got a lot of work packages\n\n1463\n01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:03,210\nthat have actual workers attached to them,\nthat we're gonna have to communicate with.\n\n1464\n01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:05,380\nNot necessarily the stakeholder\nwho identified earlier.\n\n1465\n01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,750\nSo we've got a whole slew of new\npeople attached to our project, so\n\n1466\n01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,820\nit's time to revisit that.\n\n1467\n01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,620\nRevisiting the communications management\nplan is one of the things that I like to\n\n1468\n01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,280\ndo later in the planning phase\n\n1469\n01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,335\nbecause the more planning you\ndo the more people you find.\n\n1470\n01:14:18,335 --> 01:14:19,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so, this is one that's constantly\n\n1471\n01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:22,560\ngetting updated\n>> So I like to do a final pass before we\n\n1472\n01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:27,820\nmove into execution, just to make sure\nthat I've got all my people listed.\n\n1473\n01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,080\nYou'll see the inputs on this one.\n\n1474\n01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,160\nThe project management plan,\nagain, if we have it.\n\n1475\n01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,340\nThat makes this easy.\n\n1476\n01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,990\nThe stakeholder register.\n\n1477\n01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:38,080\nThat is really where all of our\ninformation is going to come from.\n\n1478\n01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,950\nAnd then,\nenterprise environmental factors and\n\n1479\n01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:43,812\norganizational process assets\nlike we've come used to seeing.\n\n1480\n01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,750\nAll right, on the tools and\ntechniques side though.\n\n1481\n01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,560\nThis is where things get really complex.\n\n1482\n01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:53,490\nBecause what you're trying to do, is\nyou're trying to come up with a plan that\n\n1483\n01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:58,350\ndefines how you communicate information\nabout your project to other people.\n\n1484\n01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,260\nAnd that's a big deal, right?\n\n1485\n01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:02,990\nIf you are working on\na government project,\n\n1486\n01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:07,030\nyou may have to report to the Senate or\nthe House, various committees.\n\n1487\n01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:09,980\nYou may have to report that\ninformation in certain formats,\n\n1488\n01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,840\ncertain intervals that they define.\n\n1489\n01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,500\nIf it's just an internal project, you may\nhave your own calendar that you follow.\n\n1490\n01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:20,650\nWhat information you disseminate,\nhow you disseminate it, and so on.\n\n1491\n01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:23,890\nAnd that stuff needs to be\nagreed upon ahead of time.\n\n1492\n01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:26,470\nAnd that's where\nare communications plan comes in.\n\n1493\n01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:29,040\nSo it can be very, very simple.\n\n1494\n01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,300\nBut it can also be very incredibly\ncomplex depending on how crazy you want\n\n1495\n01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,422\nto go on it.\n\n1496\n01:15:36,422 --> 01:15:37,300\nAll right?\nSo, we start by doing ommunication\n\n1497\n01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,460\nrequirements analysis.\n\n1498\n01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:44,890\nAnd that's basically where we take a look\nat our people and our project, and\n\n1499\n01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:50,120\nwe determine what type of communications\nwe really need to provide for\n\n1500\n01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,630\nthis project to be successful, right?\n\n1501\n01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,390\nSo what's the bare minimums?\n\n1502\n01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:56,890\nAnd you'll see a ton of\npossible things to think about.\n\n1503\n01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:00,060\nRonnie, you've been\nexhaustive here in your list.\n\n1504\n01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,400\nSo for example,\nwhen we reach out to people,\n\n1505\n01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,130\nwe might have specific communication\nmethods that we want to use.\n\n1506\n01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:10,180\nSo we have potential communications.\n\n1507\n01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:13,605\nWe might have email, fax, phone,\n\n1508\n01:16:13,605 --> 01:16:18,530\nphysical meetings,\nonline meetings, mailers.\n\n1509\n01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,630\nAll sorts of communication methods.\n\n1510\n01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:23,760\nWe need to identify what people\nare attached to our project, and\n\n1511\n01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,264\nwhich communication method is suitable for\nthem.\n\n1512\n01:16:26,264 --> 01:16:28,920\nRight?\nIf I'm giving a status update to my\n\n1513\n01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,830\nkey stakeholders, a physical in\nperson meeting might be the best way.\n\n1514\n01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:36,800\nGet them in a room, sit down with them,\nand say what's going on.\n\n1515\n01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,020\nBut if I'm communicating with\nthe general public as a whole,\n\n1516\n01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,980\nI can't call them in for a meeting.\n\n1517\n01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:46,040\nSo for them,\nmaybe a mailer is the way to go.\n\n1518\n01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,830\nOr maybe a email, or something like that.\n\n1519\n01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:52,080\nI need to determine the methods that\nare appropriate for reaching out to them.\n\n1520\n01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,680\nAll right?\n\n1521\n01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,330\nNow, Ronnie put in a formula here, and\n\n1522\n01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:58,330\nthis formula has been a part of\nthe pin bach for a long time.\n\n1523\n01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:04,330\nAnd what it is, is the potential\ncommunication channels or paths, right?\n\n1524\n01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:09,730\nWhen we think about projects, it's\nreally easy to think of it as everyone\n\n1525\n01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:13,280\ntalking to the project manager and\nthe project manager talking to everyone.\n\n1526\n01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,150\nSo if there's 50 people\nattached to the project and\n\n1527\n01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:19,510\nI'm one of them, then there's 49 paths.\n\n1528\n01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:23,130\nMe talking to 49 people,\n49 people talking to me.\n\n1529\n01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,620\nBut, that's not really it\n\n1530\n01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:30,090\nbecause people within the project may talk\nto each other without going through me.\n\n1531\n01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:35,250\nSo when we talk about communications,\nthere are several paths that occur.\n\n1532\n01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:39,800\nAnd so, there's a simple formula for that\nand it's not the most terribly useful one,\n\n1533\n01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,580\nbut it does show up on\nthe exam from time to time.\n\n1534\n01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,010\nSo it's good to highlight it.\n\n1535\n01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:47,960\nWhich is basically giving\nus a way to figure out\n\n1536\n01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:53,150\nhow many people, or how many paths\nof communication of may exist.\n\n1537\n01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:59,153\nThe n simply equals\nthe number of personnel.\n\n1538\n01:17:59,153 --> 01:18:01,770\nIt's two ns.\n\n1539\n01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:03,200\nThere we go.\nPersonnel or\n\n1540\n01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,530\nstakeholders that are communicating,\nright?\n\n1541\n01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:06,630\nAnd we just plug it in.\n\n1542\n01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,480\nI gave an example of 50, right?\n\n1543\n01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:13,725\nSo if we said 50 times 50 minus 1.\n\n1544\n01:18:13,725 --> 01:18:16,125\nAll divided by 2.\n\n1545\n01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:16,695\nRight?\n\n1546\n01:18:16,695 --> 01:18:22,565\nSo we do 50 minus 1 because,\nsomebody's not gonna talk to themselves.\n\n1547\n01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:24,375\nSo we have to reduce it by one.\n\n1548\n01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:27,785\nSo we take 50 times 49 and\nwe divide that by 2.\n\n1549\n01:18:27,785 --> 01:18:30,005\nAnd that's going to give us\nthe total amount of paths.\n\n1550\n01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,605\nAnd that's not gonna be a number that\nI'm gonna be able to do in my head.\n\n1551\n01:18:32,605 --> 01:18:35,050\nSo let's fire that up in here.\n\n1552\n01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:36,270\nSo 50 times 49.\n\n1553\n01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:37,454\n>> 2450.\n\n1554\n01:18:37,454 --> 01:18:40,335\n>> And we'll divide that by 4, so\n\n1555\n01:18:40,335 --> 01:18:45,360\n1225 different communication\npaths are present.\n\n1556\n01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,277\nAll right?\n\n1557\n01:18:46,277 --> 01:18:48,900\nNow, that you have that information,\nwhat does it mean to you?\n\n1558\n01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,310\nWell if you're like me,\nit doesn't mean much.\n\n1559\n01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:51,150\nRight?\nThat's why I say\n\n1560\n01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:53,560\nthis is not a terribly useful method.\n\n1561\n01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,020\nBut, what it's doing is\nit's giving me a warning.\n\n1562\n01:18:56,020 --> 01:19:00,330\nIt's saying, look in your project,\ncommunications can be very complex.\n\n1563\n01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:05,850\nBecause there's 1225 different\ncombinations that could occur as people\n\n1564\n01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:07,250\nstart to talk to each other.\n\n1565\n01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,900\nSo are we going to plan for\nevery single one of them?\n\n1566\n01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:15,190\nNo, but what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nplan for the major lines of communication.\n\n1567\n01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:18,960\nHow we talk to the project team members,\nhow we talk to the project members.\n\n1568\n01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,210\nHow we talk to the stakeholders,\n\n1569\n01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:24,759\nhow we talk to the sponsors,\nthose are all key communications.\n\n1570\n01:19:24,759 --> 01:19:25,290\nRight?\n\n1571\n01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:28,340\nAnd we need to plan for\nhow they're going to be handled.\n\n1572\n01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:33,590\nIf we plan for all 1,225 lines,\nwe'll be in the planning phase forever.\n\n1573\n01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:34,370\nAll right.\n\n1574\n01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:37,600\nSo in order to understand those key\ncommunications, we need to know or\n\n1575\n01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,270\norganization.\n\n1576\n01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:41,520\nSo organizational charts are something\nthat we'll look at as we figure out\n\n1577\n01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,980\nwho's talking to who.\n\n1578\n01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:45,690\nIf I have three web developers,\n\n1579\n01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:48,470\nI might not wanna communicate\ndirectly with all three of them.\n\n1580\n01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:51,945\nBut instead, have a team lead, or\nhave the functional manager for\n\n1581\n01:19:51,945 --> 01:19:54,747\nthe web development team and\ncommunicate with them.\n\n1582\n01:19:54,747 --> 01:19:58,288\nThat way I'm talking with one person,\nand they are controlling the input and\n\n1583\n01:19:58,288 --> 01:20:00,808\noutput of data to those three\npeople underneath them.\n\n1584\n01:20:00,808 --> 01:20:02,456\nThat really simplifies things.\n\n1585\n01:20:02,456 --> 01:20:09,310\nI know mid level management gets vilified\nin comic strips and movies all the time.\n\n1586\n01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:12,450\nBut the whole purpose\nof mid level management\n\n1587\n01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:14,094\nis to allow us to easily communicate\n\n1588\n01:20:15,555 --> 01:20:19,265\nwith large groups of our employees without\nhaving to deal with them individually.\n\n1589\n01:20:19,265 --> 01:20:21,785\nSo, they better understand\nthe language and\n\n1590\n01:20:21,785 --> 01:20:24,805\nmethod to communicate with their employees\nso that we don't have to, and so\n\n1591\n01:20:24,805 --> 01:20:27,312\nthis is one of those areas where mid-level\nmanagement comes in really handy.\n\n1592\n01:20:28,982 --> 01:20:29,902\nAll right.\n\n1593\n01:20:29,902 --> 01:20:33,272\nSo some of the other things that we're\nlooking at are project organization,\n\n1594\n01:20:33,272 --> 01:20:36,322\nwhich again might differ\nfrom our organization.\n\n1595\n01:20:36,322 --> 01:20:41,020\nDisciplines, departments, and\nspecialties involved in the project.\n\n1596\n01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:43,660\nSo if we've got employees\ndivided up different ways,\n\n1597\n01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:45,010\nnormally those are departments or\n\n1598\n01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:48,550\ndisciplines, we need to be able to\nreach out and communicate with them.\n\n1599\n01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:51,680\nIf we're contracting then we might\nhave people that have specialties.\n\n1600\n01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,430\nAnd you'll see this with employees, too.\n\n1601\n01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:54,930\nI might have three web developers.\n\n1602\n01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:57,709\nOne might be an outstanding PHP developer,\n\n1603\n01:20:57,709 --> 01:21:02,452\nthe other two might be outstanding CGI\ndevelopers or something like that.\n\n1604\n01:21:02,452 --> 01:21:06,202\nAnd so in those scenarios I've\ngot different specialties so\n\n1605\n01:21:06,202 --> 01:21:10,905\nwhen I communicate I need to make sure\nI'm talking to the right people in a way\n\n1606\n01:21:10,905 --> 01:21:12,391\nthat they understand.\n\n1607\n01:21:12,391 --> 01:21:14,455\nSo that's really what we're juggling.\n\n1608\n01:21:14,455 --> 01:21:18,095\nAnd when we start drawing our lines,\nour communication methods,\n\n1609\n01:21:18,095 --> 01:21:22,035\nwe're gonna have our internal and\nour external methods.\n\n1610\n01:21:22,035 --> 01:21:24,105\nInternally we're talking\nwith our own employees,\n\n1611\n01:21:24,105 --> 01:21:27,980\ngenerally people on our project\nmanagement team and our project team.\n\n1612\n01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:33,240\nExternally we're generally talking to\nour contractors and the press, right.\n\n1613\n01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,310\nYou might be talking\nto your customer base.\n\n1614\n01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:36,430\nSo for example,\n\n1615\n01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:42,060\nif you're doing a project that is\na road reconstruction project, right.\n\n1616\n01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:45,740\nSo you're repairing some roads, you might\nwant to communicate out to the citizenry\n\n1617\n01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,790\nto say hey,\nthis road's gonna be closed for\n\n1618\n01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:51,150\nthree days as part of our ongoing\nproject to make the town better.\n\n1619\n01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:54,490\nSo you put a positive spin on it while\ninforming them that the road's gonna\n\n1620\n01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:55,360\nbe closed.\n\n1621\n01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,590\nThat's the kind of communication\nthat needs to go out, and\n\n1622\n01:21:57,590 --> 01:22:00,600\nwe need to say what's the best\nway to communicate with them.\n\n1623\n01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,450\nIt's gonna be different than how we\ncommunicate with internal employees.\n\n1624\n01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,210\nAll right.\n\n1625\n01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:09,470\nAnd then our stakeholder information,\nwhat you're gonna find is that\n\n1626\n01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:13,420\neach stakeholder might have their own\npreferred method of communication.\n\n1627\n01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:16,260\nI used to work for\nan insurance company, and\n\n1628\n01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,760\nthe president of the insurance\ncompany hated email.\n\n1629\n01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,820\nJust, he didn't like computers in general,\nbut hated email.\n\n1630\n01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,551\nSo whenever you sent him an email, what\nwould happen is he had a secretary who\n\n1631\n01:22:27,551 --> 01:22:31,576\nwould print the email out, and when he'd\ncome into the office in the morning he'd\n\n1632\n01:22:31,576 --> 01:22:35,480\nhave a stack of papers on his desk that he\nwould read just like they were letters,\n\n1633\n01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:39,026\nlike he had been doing doing for\n50 years, that is what he was used to.\n\n1634\n01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:40,795\nThat was how he liked to communicate.\n\n1635\n01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:45,365\nSo, I knew if I sent him an email,\nhe wouldn't read it until the next\n\n1636\n01:22:45,365 --> 01:22:49,545\nmorning after it was printed out on paper\nand then he read it in the morning.\n\n1637\n01:22:49,545 --> 01:22:53,035\nSo, even email for\nhim could have as much as a 24 hour delay.\n\n1638\n01:22:53,035 --> 01:22:56,830\nSo, if I had something urgent that\nneeded to go out I got off my butt,\n\n1639\n01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:58,480\nand I went up to his office.\n\n1640\n01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,420\nOr I called and I scheduled\nan appointment with his secretary,\n\n1641\n01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,160\nto be able to go up there and talk to him.\n\n1642\n01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,480\nThat was how he needed to be handled.\n\n1643\n01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,280\nIt was not wrong.\n\n1644\n01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,850\nYou don't have to use email.\n\n1645\n01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,260\nIt was just how he liked to do it.\n\n1646\n01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:13,310\nAnd so I knew that in any project,\n\n1647\n01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:17,850\nif I had to communicate with him,\nemail was fine if I was okay with waiting.\n\n1648\n01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:19,590\nIf I was in a hurry, it wasn't.\n\n1649\n01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:22,870\nThat's the kind of stuff that needs\nto go into our communications plan\n\n1650\n01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:23,430\nin our project.\n\n1651\n01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:30,515\nAll right, now where this gets really fun\nis the next one, communication technology.\n\n1652\n01:23:30,515 --> 01:23:33,745\nWhat are all the different\nways we can communicate?\n\n1653\n01:23:33,745 --> 01:23:38,605\nEmail, fax, text message,\ngood god, text messages.\n\n1654\n01:23:38,605 --> 01:23:41,415\nSee now here is where\nI start to show mine.\n\n1655\n01:23:41,415 --> 01:23:43,395\nI hate text messages.\n\n1656\n01:23:43,395 --> 01:23:46,445\nIf somebody texts me, and\nI don't get it, I don't care.\n\n1657\n01:23:46,445 --> 01:23:47,715\nAnd they say well, I sent it to you.\n\n1658\n01:23:47,715 --> 01:23:49,735\nAnd I say well it's your fault for\nsending me a text.\n\n1659\n01:23:49,735 --> 01:23:51,155\nI don't like texts.\n\n1660\n01:23:51,155 --> 01:23:54,230\nSo different people\ncommunicate different ways.\n\n1661\n01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,530\nWe need to know the appropriate\ntechnology, right.\n\n1662\n01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:59,430\nFax, the facsimile, it's a great system.\n\n1663\n01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:01,280\nBut who has a fax machine anymore?\n\n1664\n01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,280\nRight, aside from the government.\n\n1665\n01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,525\nSo it's just not something\nWe see very often, so\n\n1666\n01:24:05,525 --> 01:24:09,975\nwe need to understand what technologies\nwe want to even allow in our company.\n\n1667\n01:24:09,975 --> 01:24:12,355\nThere might some means\nthat we don't allow.\n\n1668\n01:24:12,355 --> 01:24:14,992\nYou're starting to see this in\nthe medical industry a lot now,\n\n1669\n01:24:14,992 --> 01:24:17,692\nwhere they're blocking email,\nno communications via email.\n\n1670\n01:24:17,692 --> 01:24:20,504\nBecause email is non\nencrypted by default and\n\n1671\n01:24:20,504 --> 01:24:23,839\nthey worry about patient\nrecords making it in there.\n\n1672\n01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:26,670\nSo you may have that kind\nof thing in place, so\n\n1673\n01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:30,260\nyou've gotta make sure that\nyou've got that document.\n\n1674\n01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:31,840\nCommunication models.\n\n1675\n01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,750\nCommunication models are different\nways to reach out to people,\n\n1676\n01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:40,560\nand PMI breaks it down\ninto five categories.\n\n1677\n01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,070\nRight.\n\n1678\n01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:45,920\nWe've got encode, transmit, decode,\nacknowledge, feedback response, right.\n\n1679\n01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,041\nFeedback and\nresponse are kind of combined.\n\n1680\n01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:48,343\nAll right.\n\n1681\n01:24:48,343 --> 01:24:49,781\nSo starting out in code,\n\n1682\n01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:53,620\nwe have information that\nwe need to give to people.\n\n1683\n01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:58,200\nBut to us, it might be a Gantt chart,\nit might be a resource sheet,\n\n1684\n01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,500\nit's project management speak.\n\n1685\n01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,300\nAnd when we start communicating out,\n\n1686\n01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:04,870\nwe'll see this with earned\nvalue analysis later on.\n\n1687\n01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:11,200\nIf I start talking to the CEO about EAC\nand BAC and all these other numbers\n\n1688\n01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,530\nthat we deal with as project managers,\nwe'll see all these in monitoring and\n\n1689\n01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:17,780\ncontrolling, when we start talking\nabout that stuff their eyes glaze over.\n\n1690\n01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:19,130\nThey don't know what you're talking about.\n\n1691\n01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:20,500\nThey haven't seen these formulas.\n\n1692\n01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,740\nThey don't know what they mean.\n\n1693\n01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:23,460\nSo I've gotta translate it.\n\n1694\n01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:27,640\nI've got to encode this data in\na way that I know the recipient\n\n1695\n01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:28,970\nwill be able to interpret it.\n\n1696\n01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:31,890\nDon't use project management\nspecific terminology,\n\n1697\n01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:35,060\nuse terms that are understandable\nwithin your company.\n\n1698\n01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,020\nTransmit.\n\n1699\n01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:37,420\nHow do I send the data?\n\n1700\n01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:42,370\nI need to get this data to the people,\nand I do it via phone, email, whatever.\n\n1701\n01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:45,960\nThat's something that I've gotta come\nup with a communication model for that.\n\n1702\n01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,260\nDecode, right.\n\n1703\n01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:50,390\nThey're gonna receive it, and\nthey're going to interpret it.\n\n1704\n01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:53,030\nIf it's an email they're,\ngonna open up and they're gonna read it.\n\n1705\n01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:55,690\nAnd I need to understand\nhow they're doing this.\n\n1706\n01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:59,830\nIf it's a voicemail, you hear my voice,\nyou hear tone, you hear inflections,\n\n1707\n01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,210\nit's very easy to\nunderstand what I'm saying.\n\n1708\n01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:03,190\nWell, except for\nthe fact that I have terrible speech.\n\n1709\n01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:08,210\nBut if I send you an email,\nno inflection, no tone.\n\n1710\n01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:08,810\nYou don't know.\n\n1711\n01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:09,550\nAm I angry?\n\n1712\n01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:10,610\nAm I happy?\n\n1713\n01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:15,230\nI've gotta make sure that I properly\naddress that, use the right adjectives,\n\n1714\n01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:17,840\nand verbs, and stuff, to make that\nmessage carry the information I need.\n\n1715\n01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:21,820\nAcknowledge, this is a big challenge.\n\n1716\n01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:24,100\nIf I send somebody an email, and I say,\n\n1717\n01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:28,760\nhere's a problem, you need to do this to\nfix it, and then they don't do it, right?\n\n1718\n01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,060\nAnd I come to them and\nI say why didn't you do this, I told you?\n\n1719\n01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,300\nAnd they say, I didn't get the email.\n\n1720\n01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:34,420\nI didn't get the voicemail.\n\n1721\n01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:38,500\nWell, that happens a lot, and the majority\nof the time they did get the email or\n\n1722\n01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,475\nthey did get the voicemail.\n\n1723\n01:26:40,475 --> 01:26:43,466\nSo we need a way to acknowledge that.\n\n1724\n01:26:43,466 --> 01:26:47,091\nWith email, you have read receipts,\nthey're not the most trustworthy, so\n\n1725\n01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:50,938\nif there's a case where I need absolute,\nwhat they call it, non-repudiation,\n\n1726\n01:26:50,938 --> 01:26:54,427\nthe ability or the lack of ability for\nsomebody to say they didn't get it.\n\n1727\n01:26:54,427 --> 01:26:59,120\nAnd we might need to do registered mail,\nor signature required.\n\n1728\n01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,690\nSomething like that,\nwhere they have to sign off on it.\n\n1729\n01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:05,400\nI might require a phone call, so\nthat I can have a phone call recording, or\n\n1730\n01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,430\nI keep a phone log that says yes, I talked\nto this person, at this time, at this day.\n\n1731\n01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:11,160\nThis is what was agreed upon.\n\n1732\n01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,100\nThat's very important, and\nthat's acknowledgement.\n\n1733\n01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:15,380\nAnd then lastly is feedback and response.\n\n1734\n01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:17,500\nIf you're sending out a communication,\n\n1735\n01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:21,380\nyou probably expect some kind\nof information back, not always.\n\n1736\n01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:22,430\nMaybe it's a status report.\n\n1737\n01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:25,680\nEverything's going great,\nno actions required, that's it.\n\n1738\n01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,580\nBut, if there's even\nthe slightest deviation,\n\n1739\n01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:30,450\nthen you may expect some feedback.\n\n1740\n01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,770\nAnd so in your communication,\n\n1741\n01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:36,230\nyou need to specify the best\nway to receive that feedback.\n\n1742\n01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:39,270\nIf I'm reaching out to the public with\na mailer, I need to put in there hey,\n\n1743\n01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:40,350\nif you have any questions,\n\n1744\n01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:43,560\ncall this 1-800 number we've prepared\nto answer any questions you have.\n\n1745\n01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,690\nSo you specify a way to\nprovide that feedback.\n\n1746\n01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:48,725\nAn acceptable channel, right,\n\n1747\n01:27:48,725 --> 01:27:51,150\ncuz you don't want people just\ncommunicating however they want.\n\n1748\n01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:53,870\nWe get that Like, well, ITProTV,\n\n1749\n01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:58,320\nI am amazed at the way that\nour viewers reach out to us.\n\n1750\n01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,903\nSo we set up our Q&A forums,\nand our live chat so\n\n1751\n01:28:00,903 --> 01:28:03,172\nyou guys to able to ask questions with us.\n\n1752\n01:28:03,172 --> 01:28:05,924\nAnd so,\nthose are our communication methods.\n\n1753\n01:28:05,924 --> 01:28:08,073\nBut over the years I've gotten,\n\n1754\n01:28:08,073 --> 01:28:12,228\nwhere people have reached out to\nme through all sorts of things.\n\n1755\n01:28:12,228 --> 01:28:17,220\nI get LinkedIn requests even though\nI don't have a LinkedIn account.\n\n1756\n01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:19,520\nI got a google hangout once,\nit was actually kind of fun.\n\n1757\n01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,500\nI talked to one of our viewers and\nhelped them out all via google hangouts.\n\n1758\n01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:27,320\nI never even thought about it,\njust ways that are out there.\n\n1759\n01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:30,160\nSo, understand that if you leave\npeople to their own devices,\n\n1760\n01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,390\nthey'll communicate with\nwhatever way works for them.\n\n1761\n01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:37,020\nYou might not be expecting,\nyou might miss that communication, and\n\n1762\n01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,510\nnow they think you're ignoring them.\n\n1763\n01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:40,160\nRight.\nI would have hated for that to happen.\n\n1764\n01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,350\nSomebody sends me a message and\nthey think I'm ignoring them,\n\n1765\n01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:46,490\nbut it just came through\na channel I wasn't expecting.\n\n1766\n01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:51,310\nSo in those scenarios, if we had just\nlaid it out in our communication and\n\n1767\n01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:53,580\nsay \"hey do you have feedback and\nresponse?\n\n1768\n01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:56,670\nHere's how you send it to us and\nthen feed that information to them.\n\n1769\n01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:59,540\nSo that's an important part\nof that communication model.\n\n1770\n01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:05,337\nAll right, and then our methods,well,\nwe've got interactive push and pull,\n\n1771\n01:29:05,337 --> 01:29:09,060\nInteractive communication,\nit's like a phone call.\n\n1772\n01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:11,430\nI say,\nhey Ronnie what do you think about this?\n\n1773\n01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:12,060\nYou tell me.\n\n1774\n01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,070\n>> That's it.\n>> I respond, right?\n\n1775\n01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:13,900\n>> Right.\n\n1776\n01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:16,140\n>> So it's a straightforward\ncommunication there.\n\n1777\n01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,750\nPush and pull though.\n\n1778\n01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:22,130\nPush, I tell you, I send something\nto you just like a mailer, right?\n\n1779\n01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:23,580\nWhen I send you a letter in the mail and\n\n1780\n01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,070\nyou read it,\nyou can't really respond to me right then.\n\n1781\n01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:28,009\nYou've been given one way information.\n\n1782\n01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:32,820\nAnd then pull, that's where I reach\nout to you, or you reach out to me and\n\n1783\n01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,710\nyou say, hey Don,\nI need the status update.\n\n1784\n01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:37,730\nTell me this, tell me what I need.\n\n1785\n01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:40,083\nAnd this might be a written letter,\nor subpoena-\n\n1786\n01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:40,599\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1787\n01:29:40,599 --> 01:29:42,210\n>> Those are the fun ones.\n\n1788\n01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:42,920\nSomething like that,\n\n1789\n01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:46,130\nthat says you've gotta provide us with\nthis information, and we provide it.\n\n1790\n01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:47,940\nSo pull,\n\n1791\n01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:51,960\nin theory if there's ever a poll going on,\nthat means your system is broken down.\n\n1792\n01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,670\nThat means that there's something\nthat you didn't account for.\n\n1793\n01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:58,670\nIf somebody needs some information,\nwe should have identified that early on in\n\n1794\n01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:02,520\nthe planning phase of our project,\nso that we knew to send it to them.\n\n1795\n01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,240\nBut if they're doing a pull,\nif they're saying, hey,\n\n1796\n01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,350\nI need this data, then that was\nsomething we didn't plan for.\n\n1797\n01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:10,930\nSo we really need to do two things.\n\n1798\n01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:12,690\nOne is give them the information\nthey want, right?\n\n1799\n01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:14,490\nAlways give people\nthe information that they want.\n\n1800\n01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:16,190\nThere's nothing that we should hide.\n\n1801\n01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:20,935\nAnd then, two, do a change ticket\nto update your communications\n\n1802\n01:30:20,935 --> 01:30:22,380\nplan to say,\n>> Right.\n\n1803\n01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:25,894\n>> This person did a poor request for this\nso going forward we need to send them this\n\n1804\n01:30:25,894 --> 01:30:28,570\ninformation at regular intervals so\nthat they've got it.\n\n1805\n01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:30,320\nSo that they don't have\nto request it from us.\n\n1806\n01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,480\nThat it's already prepared.\n\n1807\n01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,010\nIt becomes part of our plan.\n\n1808\n01:30:35,312 --> 01:30:36,140\nAll right, so\n\n1809\n01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:39,670\nthese are all some of the different\nthings that we have to think about.\n\n1810\n01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:41,760\nOnce we've come up with\neverything we need.\n\n1811\n01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,570\nAnd we have meetings.\n\n1812\n01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,400\nMeetings to discuss communications.\n\n1813\n01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,430\nThat's always fun.\n\n1814\n01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:48,130\nMeetings to discuss what kind\nof meetings we want to have.\n\n1815\n01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:50,030\nBut once we've got that all figured out,\n\n1816\n01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:55,510\nnow we have a handle on how we need to\ncommunicate throughout our project.\n\n1817\n01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:59,320\nAnd we're able to draft our\ncommunications management plan.\n\n1818\n01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:04,330\nThat plan is going to basically\ndictate how we communicate.\n\n1819\n01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:08,040\nOne thing we may have learned as we\nwere doing this was how people wanna be\n\n1820\n01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,690\ncommunicated with, so we may need to\ngo back to our stakeholder register and\n\n1821\n01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:14,190\nupdate that,\nif that's where we're keeping track of it.\n\n1822\n01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:18,720\nSo we've got our Project Document Updates\nhere, as we continue to update there.\n\n1823\n01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,840\nBut let's look at\na Communications Management Plan.\n\n1824\n01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,270\nI've got a few templates on this one.\n\n1825\n01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:25,290\nOr actually, you know what, maybe I don't.\n\n1826\n01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:28,800\nSo I've got a Communications\nManagement Plan, at a minimum.\n\n1827\n01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,980\nSo this is what a Communications\nManagement Plan looks like.\n\n1828\n01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,590\nWe've got our Stakeholder.\n\n1829\n01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:38,760\nThe information that they need,\nthe method that we send it to them,\n\n1830\n01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,360\nand the timing frequency,\nhow often we send it.\n\n1831\n01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,650\nAnd then just who's responsible for\nsending that data.\n\n1832\n01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:47,700\nThis is the key set of information we\nneed as part of our communications\n\n1833\n01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:48,750\nmanagement plan.\n\n1834\n01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,110\nWho we're reaching out to.\n\n1835\n01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:54,550\nNow this may not be the same\nacross every project.\n\n1836\n01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:57,750\nSo when you have that plan that\nserves as a template plan,\n\n1837\n01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,430\nyou may have your default data in here.\n\n1838\n01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:03,160\nSo it might say,\nkey stakeholder is the project manager.\n\n1839\n01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:05,340\nAll right.\n\n1840\n01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:08,160\nAnd you might have project sponsor.\n\n1841\n01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:12,190\nAnd so, these are religious,\ngeneric terms that are going in our plan.\n\n1842\n01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:15,800\nAnd I might say that they\nget all information, and\n\n1843\n01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,260\nhere we get regular status updates.\n\n1844\n01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:26,490\nAnd then we can put how their getting it,\nphone, meeting, email, fax, whoops.\n\n1845\n01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:27,670\nIf I can spell fax.\n\n1846\n01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,290\nRight, so\nall the different ways they communicate.\n\n1847\n01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:34,060\nAnd then we specify the timing, right?\n\n1848\n01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:37,420\nThe project manager, that would be\nconstant just as information comes in.\n\n1849\n01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:42,360\nBut the project sponsor, we might be\ngiving them weekly status updates.\n\n1850\n01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,770\nAnd the center for\nthat is going to be the project manager.\n\n1851\n01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,619\nAnd up here,\nthis will be the Project Management Team.\n\n1852\n01:32:53,104 --> 01:32:56,640\nWe just filled that out to be\nappropriate for what our company needs.\n\n1853\n01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:01,390\nEach of the different elements\nthat needs to be sent out.\n\n1854\n01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:02,940\nWe document it here.\n\n1855\n01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:06,570\nIn here it's high level so when\nthe project kicks off I take this plan and\n\n1856\n01:33:06,570 --> 01:33:08,080\nI say, well, you know what?\n\n1857\n01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,840\nI'm the project manager so\nI'll just sub my name in there.\n\n1858\n01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,860\nThen the sponsor is Ronnie.\n\n1859\n01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,460\nAnd so, I punch his name in there.\n\n1860\n01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:18,140\nAnd now, it becomes a plan for my project.\n\n1861\n01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,040\nAnd then I add,\nyou always have to add, right?\n\n1862\n01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,720\nCuz you've always got different\nstakeholders with every project.\n\n1863\n01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,100\nSo, you'll have to add people,\nand their communications too.\n\n1864\n01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:28,940\nAny assumptions and\nconstraints come in here.\n\n1865\n01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:32,130\nThere's some information that\nwe just can't provide in\n\n1866\n01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:34,460\nas timely a manner as people might expect.\n\n1867\n01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:37,480\nSo maybe they're asking for\ndaily status reports, but\n\n1868\n01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,940\nwe don't have the resources to do that.\n\n1869\n01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:42,990\nAnd so, we put in here that daily\nstatus reports are not possible,\n\n1870\n01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:44,490\nthat's a constraint we have.\n\n1871\n01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:48,560\nAny assumptions we make,\nwe assume we got everybody here.\n\n1872\n01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,440\nBut if we didn't, we can add them\nin using a simple change ticket.\n\n1873\n01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:57,450\nAnd then, glossary of terms or\nacronyms, you see this in the military.\n\n1874\n01:33:57,450 --> 01:34:01,770\nWe might have, as a method,\nwe might have email and...\n\n1875\n01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:10,280\nActually, we might do SIPRNet or\nNIPRNet or\n\n1876\n01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:15,290\nwhatever, which, in the United States\nMilitary, they have two networks.\n\n1877\n01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:19,200\nOne is a secure network that's isolated,\nand one is a non secure\n\n1878\n01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:22,870\nnetwork that isn't isolated from the\ninternet, and so when they communicate,\n\n1879\n01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:26,540\nif it is a secure communication,\nit's supposed to go over SIPRNet.\n\n1880\n01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:28,340\nIf it's not then it goes over NIPRnet.\n\n1881\n01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:32,470\nAnd so, I might put that glossary down\nhere, and say here's what those stand for.\n\n1882\n01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:35,010\nHere's what the SIPRnet means.\n\n1883\n01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:37,410\nAnd so on, so\nI just lay that information out.\n\n1884\n01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:40,505\nAll right, which I think I used\nthe wrong acronym there but whatever.\n\n1885\n01:34:40,505 --> 01:34:43,345\nSo, that's basically some of the stuff\nthat's gonna go in this communication\n\n1886\n01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:44,715\nmanagement plan.\n\n1887\n01:34:44,715 --> 01:34:50,415\nNow, I normally couple this\nwith my stakeholder register,\n\n1888\n01:34:50,415 --> 01:34:54,347\nand it's up to you, and I think I\ndidn't do it here in my template.\n\n1889\n01:34:54,347 --> 01:34:55,637\nSo let me pull that up.\n\n1890\n01:34:55,637 --> 01:34:59,817\nStake holder,\none more management plan, here.\n\n1891\n01:34:59,817 --> 01:35:03,047\nSo, what we've got, like our stakeholder,\noh, and I did do it.\n\n1892\n01:35:03,047 --> 01:35:06,540\nSo, communication needs method,\nand medium, timing frequency So\n\n1893\n01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:09,640\nyou may have some of this in your\nstakeholder management plan already,\n\n1894\n01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:12,670\nin which case you might not need\nthat separate communications plan.\n\n1895\n01:35:12,670 --> 01:35:15,160\nAgain, it's up to you,\nyou can merge this stuff together,\n\n1896\n01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,160\nor keep it split apart like this.\n\n1897\n01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:21,940\nSo what I'll typically do is, like here\nin the stakeholder management plan,\n\n1898\n01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:25,540\nthese will be my project team,\nmy main stakeholders.\n\n1899\n01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:26,950\nBut then in my other one,\n\n1900\n01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:29,370\nmy communications management\nplan which I closed.\n\n1901\n01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:33,530\nThis one, I'll go all out and\njust have everybody,\n\n1902\n01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:35,520\nall the various people that\nare doing work on my project so\n\n1903\n01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,180\nthis might be much larger, and this is\nprobably what I refer to more frequently.\n\n1904\n01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:42,050\nSo, entirely up to you.\n\n1905\n01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:46,700\nAlright, so that pretty much wraps\nup communications management plan.\n\n1906\n01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,380\nNot a whole heck of a lot\nto think about there.\n\n1907\n01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,740\nWe could really sum this up\ninto a couple of sentences.\n\n1908\n01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:53,585\nWho do we need to talk to,\nhow do we need to talk to them...\n\n1909\n01:35:53,585 --> 01:35:55,075\nAnd when we need to talk about it?\n\n1910\n01:35:55,075 --> 01:35:56,985\nThat's basically all we need to know.\n\n1911\n01:35:56,985 --> 01:35:57,885\nI guess you could go, what?\n\n1912\n01:35:57,885 --> 01:36:00,155\nLike what do we need\nto talk to them about?\n\n1913\n01:36:00,155 --> 01:36:00,895\nThat's about it.\n\n1914\n01:36:00,895 --> 01:36:02,785\nSo we try and plan for that.\n\n1915\n01:36:02,785 --> 01:36:04,765\nUnderstand that this is\na very living document.\n\n1916\n01:36:04,765 --> 01:36:09,155\nThis is gonna change as your project goes\non because new communication needs pop up.\n\n1917\n01:36:09,155 --> 01:36:10,525\nWell, fortunately,\n\n1918\n01:36:10,525 --> 01:36:14,530\ncommunications like these don't normally\ncost us a lot of money or even a burden.\n\n1919\n01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:17,910\nAnd so making changes to this\nplan after we're in production,\n\n1920\n01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:21,000\nafter we're executing and\nall that, usually not a big deal.\n\n1921\n01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,140\nSo just be prepared for\nthat, changes will happen.\n\n1922\n01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:28,370\nAll right, well that knocks out\na pretty decent chunk right there.\n\n1923\n01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:32,110\nSo we just tackled Quality Management,\nHuman Resource Management, and\n\n1924\n01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:33,450\nCommunication Management.\n\n1925\n01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:36,360\nWe still have risk to get through,\nand then a couple other little ones.\n\n1926\n01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,460\nWe'll tackle those in our next episode.\n\n1927\n01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:41,850\nBut for right now, well that's a pretty\ngood spot for us to wrap up for today.\n\n1928\n01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:42,920\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1929\n01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:46,110\n>> All right, well let me just remind\nyou guys if you have any questions on\n\n1930\n01:36:46,110 --> 01:36:50,180\nthis stuff, live during the show\nyou

They use the concepts of risk tolerance: risk adverse, risk seekers and risk neutral as base for risk management of the project. They also talk about the tools and techniques used to identify risks. They describe performing qualitative and quantitative risk analysis before project execution begins. They finish the risk management planning by taking a look into the risk response planning.",

evening and welcome back.\n\n4\n00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,050\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,060\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,900\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,240\n>> It is going well today, we had our\nfirst Padphone announcement yesterday,\n\n8\n00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,045\nand we still don't know\nwhen it's coming out.\n\n9\n00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,178\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm doing okay.\n\n10\n00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:50,722\n[LAUGH]\n>> For\n\n11\n00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:54,650\nthe viewers that have been with us long\nenough, I think that most people probably\n\n12\n00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,770\nknow that I am obsessed with this\nPadphone device, I must have it.\n\n13\n00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,780\nAnd they are obviously exercising\nthe greatest in project management skills,\n\n14\n00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,790\nbecause they haven't\nannounced zero date data.\n\n15\n00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,380\nIt's really frustrating,\nbut that's all right.\n\n16\n00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,670\nAnyhow, today we are gonna\ntake a look at risk.\n\n17\n00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,000\nSo for example,\nI have a great level of risk of being\n\n18\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,564\npointed disappointed when\nthe Padfhone never comes out.\n\n19\n00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:18,694\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, so\n\n20\n00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:21,280\nwe're going to take a look at risk.\n\n21\n00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,290\nEvery project has risk, this possibility\nthat certain events can happen,\n\n22\n00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,520\nand part of being a good project\nmanager is planning for that.\n\n23\n00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,031\nAnd being prepared, and being able to\nhandle that, if in a certain event,\n\n24\n00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:35,330\nwere to occur, all right.\n\n25\n00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,030\nSo we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n26\n00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,330\nWe got a whole process group for it.\n\n27\n00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,950\nLet's jump into our PMBOK here, so\n\n28\n00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,530\nI'm going back in to my process group\nchart here, in my knowledge areas.\n\n29\n00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,010\nAnd we've moved through a lot\nof planning at this point.\n\n30\n00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,860\nWe're kind of getting\ndown to the last part.\n\n31\n00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,260\nThis is the last of the large sections and\nin fact, if you look at everything after\n\n32\n00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,300\nthis is really the last large section for\nthe whole process group arrangement.\n\n33\n00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,553\nBut you'll see for plan risk,\nwe've actually got five different\n\n34\n00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:05,938\nprocesses available, there's a lot,\nright, a lot of stuff here.\n\n35\n00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:11,320\nThere are many people out there who make\na perfectly good living as risk managers,\n\n36\n00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,078\nthis is an entire career field there\nis a science you can get Masters, and\n\n37\n00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:18,430\nPhDs in EN risk management.\n\n38\n00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,630\nAnd it's because it's so complex.\n\n39\n00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,000\nThere's so much theory.\n\n40\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,490\nThere's so much there that it's\nreally an impressive world.\n\n41\n00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,760\nFor us as a project manager,\nwe're just dipping our toe in it, right?\n\n42\n00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,680\nWe're just getting a little bit\ninto that world of risk and\n\n43\n00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,180\nnot being exposed to\nthe whole craziness of it.\n\n44\n00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,290\nBut that doesn't mean we\ncan't be familiar with it.\n\n45\n00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,990\nWe need to at least at a high\nlevel be able to plan for\n\n46\n00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,770\nthat risk, figure what's going on,\nand set up reasonable expectations.\n\n47\n00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,490\nIf we can't up, we need to hire somebody,\nbring in a consultant,\n\n48\n00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,270\nbring in somebody who is a risk manager\nwould be able to evaluate that for us.\n\n49\n00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,164\nAll right, so the first process group,\njust like anything else,\n\n50\n00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:01,121\nis coming up with a plan, right?\n\n51\n00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,210\nSo plan for risk management.\n\n52\n00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,390\nWe need to come up with\na risk management plan.\n\n53\n00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,040\nOur company might already have one.\n\n54\n00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,940\nIf they do, we're done, right?\n\n55\n00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,784\nIf they don't though, we can skip\nover this, go through the four other\n\n56\n00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:18,710\nprocesses as we plan for risk, and\nthen take whatever we found worked for\n\n57\n00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,537\nus and turn that into our\nrisk management plan, right.\n\n58\n00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,629\nBut let's Let's take a look at that plan\nrisk management process anyway because\n\n59\n00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:27,625\nsooner or later you have to go through it.\n\n60\n00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,915\n>> Right.\n>> And this is it right here.\n\n61\n00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:32,935\nSo we start off by taking our input and\nour main\n\n62\n00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:36,255\ninputs here are going to be the project,\ncharter and the stakeholder register.\n\n63\n00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:39,980\nThose two things because the project\ncharter is saying what we're planning on\n\n64\n00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,440\ndoing and the stake holder register,\nwhich is saying who's involved.\n\n65\n00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,100\nBecause that's usually where\nour risk is going to come from.\n\n66\n00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,611\nWhat we're trying to do and\nwho's got their hands in it.\n\n67\n00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:54,620\nSo, we need those depending on\nwhere you're at in your project.\n\n68\n00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,060\nIf you started this\nright after initiation,\n\n69\n00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,720\nwhich plenty of people do, then those\nmay be the only documents you have.\n\n70\n00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,360\nBut if you've already gone through some of\nyour planning cycles, if you've already\n\n71\n00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,120\ncreated your schedule and your budget\nthen there's new risks that come in.\n\n72\n00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,550\nSo those may serve as inputs here, also.\n\n73\n00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,230\nBut, assuming that we start\nthis right after initiation,\n\n74\n00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,800\nthen those two documents\nare pretty much all we have.\n\n75\n00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,580\nYou may have your project management plan.\n\n76\n00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,880\nAgain, if you're company has been\ndoing formal project management,\n\n77\n00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,380\nyou'll have that.\n\n78\n00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,116\nAnd then,\nour enterprise environmental factors and\n\n79\n00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:28,447\norganizational process assets that we've\nseen in darn near every single process.\n\n80\n00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:30,424\nAll right, so nothing new and\nshocking there,\n\n81\n00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:33,270\nall documents that we've\nalready got prepared.\n\n82\n00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,190\nWhat we do now is we figure out\nhow we're gonna handle risk for\n\n83\n00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,120\nour particular project, right.\n\n84\n00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,270\nAnd there's a few different\nthings we need to choose from.\n\n85\n00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,660\nThe main thing being\nthe analytical techniques.\n\n86\n00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,370\nNow I don't wanna dive too deep into\nthe analytical techniques right now,\n\n87\n00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,320\ncuz we got a few that we'll see.\n\n88\n00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,000\nBut that's because we're gonna really\nsee them when we start talking about\n\n89\n00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,420\nidentifying risks, qualitative analysis,\nquantitative analysis, so\n\n90\n00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,200\nwe've got a lot of tools available.\n\n91\n00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,870\nSo, when we create our risk management\nplan, what we're doing is saying,\n\n92\n00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,550\nWhich analytical techniques work best for\nour company?\n\n93\n00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,370\nAnd if we pick certain techniques,how\ndo we use them for managing risks?\n\n94\n00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,450\nRemember these plans, whenever you see\nthat word plan in our little title there,\n\n95\n00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,140\nthat means that we're trying\nto create something generic\n\n96\n00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,470\nthat can apply to more than one project so\nthat it can be re-used.\n\n97\n00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,962\nWe're also gonna use our expert judgement,\nand we're gonna have meetings to come up\n\n98\n00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,359\nwith what's acceptable with us, and\nour management, our upper executives, and\n\n99\n00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:37,130\nso on, and come up with something\nthat works well for the organization.\n\n100\n00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,370\nAnd when we're done,\nwe generate our risk management plan.\n\n101\n00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,923\nAnd let me bring up my template for that.\n\n102\n00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:46,550\nWhich apparently I'm not in so\nlet me get into that.\n\n103\n00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,730\nBut I've got a template for\na risk management plan.\n\n104\n00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,330\nWhich is in here somewhere.\n\n105\n00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,903\n>> Yep, you were right there.\n\n106\n00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,369\nTo the left.\n\n107\n00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,290\nAnd down.\n\n108\n00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,563\n>> Is this not alphabetized?\n\n109\n00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:05,120\nWhat is going on?\n\n110\n00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,240\n>> It doesn't look like it.\n\n111\n00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,770\n>> Hang on.\nThis is the problem.\n\n112\n00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,640\n>> Oh, there you go.\n\n113\n00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,670\n>> Alphabets.\nThere we go, risk management plan.\n\n114\n00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,480\nSo [LAUGH], apparently in icon view\nthey don't bother alphabetizing for me.\n\n115\n00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,580\nAll right, so\nhere's my risk management plan.\n\n116\n00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,330\nSo we're gonna have things in\nhere like our methodology.\n\n117\n00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,130\nWhat methodology do we follow\nwhen it comes to managing risk?\n\n118\n00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,300\nAnd we're gonna talk about some\nof those methodologies later,\n\n119\n00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,000\nwe just haven't seen them yet.\n\n120\n00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,770\nAs far as whether we're gonna\nbe proactive or reacting, and\n\n121\n00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,970\nsome of the different\nresponses that we have.\n\n122\n00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,100\nWhat roles and responsibilities?\n\n123\n00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,420\nWho is it that's in charge of risk?\n\n124\n00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,600\nAnd your company might have a risk\nmanagement department, and so\n\n125\n00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,130\nthey'll have a big role and\nresponsibility there, or\n\n126\n00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,420\nit might be all up to you\nas the project manager.\n\n127\n00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,910\nAnd that's very common in small companies.\n\n128\n00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,010\nWe have our risk categories,\nas we start to break down our risks,\n\n129\n00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,650\nhow do we do that?\n\n130\n00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,970\nHow do we categorize them to determine\nhow we're gonna handle them?\n\n131\n00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,340\nWhere does the risk\nmanagement funding come from?\n\n132\n00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,770\nThis is important.\n\n133\n00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,840\nIn some organizations,\n\n134\n00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,780\nthe risk management funding has to\ncome from the project budget itself.\n\n135\n00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,130\nBut in other organizations, there may be\na central pool of funds available for\n\n136\n00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,220\nrisk management across\nall of the projects.\n\n137\n00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,850\nYou see that in program\nenvironments a good bit.\n\n138\n00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,020\nYou also have areas where maybe\nyour company is bonded, so\n\n139\n00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,320\nit's got an insurance policy of its own\nthat applies to risks even inside of\n\n140\n00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,170\nyour project.\n\n141\n00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,450\nSo that risk management funding may not\ncome from within the project itself,\n\n142\n00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,230\nIt might come from without.\n\n143\n00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,460\nContingency protocols, alright?\n\n144\n00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,670\nIf we set up things like cash reserves and\nschedule reserves what is the contingent?\n\n145\n00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,590\nWhat are the rules for us going and\naccessing those reserves?\n\n146\n00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,560\nFrequency and timing,\nthis ones a little confusing.\n\n147\n00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,915\nIt's talking about how often do\nwe need to monitor for the risks?\n\n148\n00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:53,667\nSo, for example, if we're doing\nan outdoor rock concert, and\n\n149\n00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:58,508\nI know that it might rain, so\nI set up a contingency plan for that.\n\n150\n00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:02,261\nWell, how often do I need to check The\nweather to see whether it's gonna rain.\n\n151\n00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:06,413\nBecause three months before the event\nit's really hard to predict that\n\n152\n00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:08,100\nweather, right?\n\n153\n00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,410\nOne month from the event,\nit's really hard to predict that weather.\n\n154\n00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,830\nTwo weeks from the event,\nyou start getting more accurate details.\n\n155\n00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,430\nOne week from the event,\neven more accurate.\n\n156\n00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,780\nThree days before, two days, one day.\n\n157\n00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,080\nThe closer you get to the event,\nthe more accurate it becomes.\n\n158\n00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,310\nAnd so we may need to designate\nhere what is the frequency and\n\n159\n00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,600\ntiming that we're going use as far as\nmonitoring and keeping up with that\n\n160\n00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,290\nto ensure that we have the most\nup-to-date information possible?\n\n161\n00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,490\nLooking three months ahead,\nI might say there's a 20% chance of rain.\n\n162\n00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,228\nBut one week ahead, I might look ahead and\nsay oh, that's like it's a 60% chance.\n\n163\n00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:43,120\nRight.\nSo\n\n164\n00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,175\nthat's the kind of thing that\nwe need to keep track of.\n\n165\n00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:48,150\nAll right.\n\n166\n00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,870\nStakeholder risk tolerances.\n\n167\n00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,780\nI know we talked about this\nin episode one or two, right.\n\n168\n00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,146\n>> Yeah.\n>> It was very early on in the PMP\n\n169\n00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:56,525\nshow that we started with this.\n\n170\n00:08:56,525 --> 00:09:00,113\nYour stake holders and\nnot just key like your sponsor but\n\n171\n00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:04,780\nyour just general stake holders fall\ninto one of three risk categories.\n\n172\n00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,739\nYou have people who are risk averse\nyou know don't want to take risks.\n\n173\n00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:12,130\nYou have people that are risk seekers.\n\n174\n00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,670\nPeople who are looking for risk,\n\n175\n00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,120\nbecause they know the bigger\nthe risk the bigger the reward.\n\n176\n00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,220\nAnd then you have people\nwho are risk neutral.\n\n177\n00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,670\nPeople who aren't adverse to taking a risk\n\n178\n00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,080\nif the odds are good enough\nthat they're going to succeed.\n\n179\n00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,400\nThey'll weigh the numbers.\n\n180\n00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,350\nThey'll look at it and\nmake an informed decision.\n\n181\n00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,870\nWe hope that everybody is risk neutral,\nbut that's not always the case.\n\n182\n00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,470\nAnd then you see these great success\nstories of people who are risk seekers and\n\n183\n00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,400\nthey kinda gloss over all the failures\nthat have from other risk seekers.\n\n184\n00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,990\nSo we may need a document that,\neach of our stakeholders,\n\n185\n00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,050\nwhat their tolerances are, and\nso how we need to handle it.\n\n186\n00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,940\nTracking and auditing, right?\n\n187\n00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,930\nAs we monitor these risks,\nhow do we track that?\n\n188\n00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,810\nHow do we record it?\n\n189\n00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,600\nHow do we have that information together?\n\n190\n00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,620\nWhat templates or forms do we use?\n\n191\n00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,750\nWhat's our accepted method of\ncollecting and reporting that data.\n\n192\n00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,590\nNext comes our definitions.\n\n193\n00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,150\nWhen we start to categorize our risks,\n\n194\n00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,330\nwhen we start to compare them\nwe do apply some terminology.\n\n195\n00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,220\nTerminology's up to us.\n\n196\n00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,480\nYou can use whatever you want.\n\n197\n00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,530\nHere they're showing very high,\nhigh, medium, low, very low, right?\n\n198\n00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,410\nWell, what do I mean,\nwhen I say there's a very low probability?\n\n199\n00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:23,960\nOkay.\n\n200\n00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,200\nDo I mean there's a less than 10% chance?\n\n201\n00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,250\nDo I mean that there's\na less than 50% chance?\n\n202\n00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,090\nWhat to me is very low?\n\n203\n00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,830\nWe need to define that, and\nit needs to be numerical.\n\n204\n00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,770\nIt needs to be something\nwe can measure against.\n\n205\n00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,540\nIt needs to be a percentage or\na ratio, a five to one odds.\n\n206\n00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,910\nOr something like that.\n\n207\n00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,490\nWe need a number we can work with,\nthat's really important.\n\n208\n00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,560\nAnd that's really,\nthat's the magic of being a risk manager.\n\n209\n00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,690\nThat's where they're so successful is\nhow do you put a number on some things?\n\n210\n00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,630\nHow do you put a number\non customer happiness?\n\n211\n00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,210\nI want to have it where\nI have a support line,\n\n212\n00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:03,620\nwhere people call it and I want to\nmake sure that my customers are happy.\n\n213\n00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,750\nOkay, how do we measure that?\n\n214\n00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,850\nHow do we put a number on happiness?\n\n215\n00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,810\nWell we can create surveys and\nscales and things like that, but\n\n216\n00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,320\nthey're just really challenging.\n\n217\n00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,330\nDoctors deal with this.\n\n218\n00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,050\nI don't know, Ronnie,\nif you've ever been do the doctor and\n\n219\n00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,200\nyou say, boy my arm hurts.\n\n220\n00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,530\nAnd they say all right, well, on a scale\nof one to ten, how bad does it hurt?\n\n221\n00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n222\n00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,940\nWell, how do you quantify that pain,\nright?\n\n223\n00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,500\nIt's challenging.\n\n224\n00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,430\nSo, we need to make sure that\nwe account for that somehow.\n\n225\n00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,480\nAnd we do that kinda stuff right here.\n\n226\n00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,120\nAnytime we get a sign in number we need\nto do that, that's what risk managers do.\n\n227\n00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,680\nAll right.\nWe also need to take a look at the impact.\n\n228\n00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,840\nWe're going to talk about probability and\nimpact quite a bit, and\n\n229\n00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,500\nthe impact can vary based\non one of the facts.\n\n230\n00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,890\nQuality, time, cost.\n\n231\n00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,134\nAnd so, we go through and we say for\nvery high, high, medium, very low,\n\n232\n00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,329\nwhatever what their impact would be.\n\n233\n00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:59,253\nSo for example something that is a very\nhigh impact at the scope level might not\n\n234\n00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,978\nbe, well it probably\nwould be a big deal but\n\n235\n00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:06,636\nif it was early enough in the project\nit might not be a very big deal at all.\n\n236\n00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:12,970\nVersus something that's a very high\nrisk to my time might be catastrophic.\n\n237\n00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,840\nI have a deadline I've got to hit.\n\n238\n00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,390\nIf this risk occurs,\nI won't hit my deadline, right.\n\n239\n00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,720\nThat would be catastrophic.\n\n240\n00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,180\nSo we need to define what that\nimpact is gonna be like for\n\n241\n00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,650\neach objective that could be affected.\n\n242\n00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,770\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe things that are going in to our risk\n\n243\n00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,680\nmanagement plan, and again, we're\ntrying to keep this somewhat generic so\n\n244\n00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,820\nthat we can reuse it on our other\nprojects and be consistent.\n\n245\n00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,290\nAll right, so that's our first process.\n\n246\n00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,500\nPretty straight forward, right?\n\n247\n00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,090\nNothing too crazy there.\n\n248\n00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,900\nThe real work starts with the other guys.\n\n249\n00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,800\nIdentifying the risks, so\njust coming up with a list.\n\n250\n00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,070\nRight, and then figuring out\nwhich risks we need to deal with.\n\n251\n00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,540\nAnd once we figure that out,\nhow we're going to deal with them.\n\n252\n00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,000\nSo those are kind of the three steps.\n\n253\n00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,710\nNow I group these two, quantitative and\nqualitative, I group them together.\n\n254\n00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,550\nBut PMI calls them out separately,\nbecause it is different math.\n\n255\n00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,910\nAll right, so\nlet's dive into identify risks.\n\n256\n00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,720\nWith identify risks,\nwe're just trying to come up with a list.\n\n257\n00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,620\nA list of all of the risks\nthat affect our project.\n\n258\n00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,808\nAnd you'll see as an input it's\npretty much everything when it comes\n\n259\n00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:30,365\nto risk analysis the more data you\nhave the better off you'll be, right.\n\n260\n00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:31,526\nThe more informed your decisions.\n\n261\n00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:33,388\nBut before I dive into those,\n\n262\n00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:38,480\nlet me just start with one concept I\nwant to make sure you guys understand.\n\n263\n00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,000\nThe term risk is really misunderstood,\nall right?\n\n264\n00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,501\nWhen people hear the word risk,\nthey think negative things, right.\n\n265\n00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:50,580\nThey think all the bad\nthings that can happen.\n\n266\n00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,330\nRisk of injury, right.\n\n267\n00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,430\nRisk of bankruptcy,\nrisk of lawsuits and litigation.\n\n268\n00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,780\nThat's what people think\nof when they think risk.\n\n269\n00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,660\nBut there's good risks also, right.\n\n270\n00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,060\nThere's a risk that I own some stock and\nthe stock value sky rockets.\n\n271\n00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,760\nAll right.\nThere's a risk that my lottery ticket\n\n272\n00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,930\nmight be the winner, right.\n\n273\n00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,200\nThere's a risk that I might have\nmillions of dollars tomorrow and\n\n274\n00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,030\ndon't have to deal with that.\n\n275\n00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,470\nOh, the burden of having\nmillions of dollars.\n\n276\n00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,690\nSo, those are real risks.\n\n277\n00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,060\nSo, that term risk,\nit can be good as well as bad.\n\n278\n00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,273\nAnd so a lot of organizations\ndon't like to use that word risk.\n\n279\n00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:36,360\nInstead they like to use two terms,\nthreats and opportunities.\n\n280\n00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:39,410\nThreat is a risk,\n\n281\n00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,400\nthat if it happens, would hurt\nthe company or hurt your project.\n\n282\n00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,080\nAn opportunity, is a risk,\n\n283\n00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,320\nthat if it happens would help your\ncompany, or help your project.\n\n284\n00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,130\nRight?\n\n285\n00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,910\nAnd so when we deal with risk,\nwe need to plan for both sides, right.\n\n286\n00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,620\nPlan for the good, as well as the bad.\n\n287\n00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,450\nBecause when you have a bad risk,\nyou want to mitigate it,\n\n288\n00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,920\nminimize it,\nreduce the impact of that threat.\n\n289\n00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,460\nBut when you have an opportunity\nyou want to exploit it.\n\n290\n00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,380\nYou want to take advantage.\n\n291\n00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,050\nYou want to make it as big as possible.\n\n292\n00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,830\nSo very different reactions based on\nthat but it all falls under risk.\n\n293\n00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,150\nAnd for somebody who's not a risk manager,\nit's easy to lose sight of that.\n\n294\n00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,180\nSo, when we look at all this\nstuff here on the left side,\n\n295\n00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,030\nwe kind of start with our constraints.\n\n296\n00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,060\nSo here's our project constraints.\n\n297\n00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,080\nOur scope, cost and time.\n\n298\n00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,870\nOur requirements, budgets, and scale.\n\n299\n00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,480\nThese guys right here, if any one of these\ngets messed up, it affects the other two.\n\n300\n00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,204\nI know that's been our ongoing\ntheme throughout the project.\n\n301\n00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:45,216\nI keep bringing this slide up,\nbecause if our schedule,\n\n302\n00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:49,861\nif we're running behind schedule, in order\nto get caught back up, we're either going\n\n303\n00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:53,530\nto need to kill off some requirements or\nget some more money, right?\n\n304\n00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,271\nAll three of these are tied to each other.\n\n305\n00:15:56,271 --> 00:16:01,252\nSo when we go to identify the risks,\nwe need to look at our cost, our schedule,\n\n306\n00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,940\nand our quality, right.\n\n307\n00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,850\nThose three things,\n\n308\n00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,900\nthat's where our risk really comes from,\nand here they're talking about the plans.\n\n309\n00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,770\nHow do we plan our cost?\n\n310\n00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,630\nHow do we plan our schedule?\n\n311\n00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,880\nHow do we plan our quality?\n\n312\n00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,470\nCuz they're going to include in\nthere how we can change our cost,\n\n313\n00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,170\nhow we can change our schedule, and so on.\n\n314\n00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:23,080\nAnd then you'll see down here, the actual\nfixed numbers, the scope baseline.\n\n315\n00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,410\nThat's our requirements,\nright, or our quality.\n\n316\n00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,170\nOur activity cost estimates,\nthere's our budget.\n\n317\n00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,688\nOur activity duration estimates,\nthere's our schedule, right?\n\n318\n00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:35,629\nSo those 6 entries of this 13,\nhalf the list, is really just talking\n\n319\n00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:40,506\nabout our triple constraints, right, the\ntriumvirate of project management power.\n\n320\n00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:42,307\nSounds so\nmuch more fancy when you put it like that.\n\n321\n00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:44,289\n>> It does.\nSo, that really accounts for\n\n322\n00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:46,140\nhalf this list.\n\n323\n00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,520\nThe other half are just areas\nwhere problems can creep up.\n\n324\n00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,030\nYour stakeholder register,\nyour general project documents.\n\n325\n00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,150\nI love this one, right,\nnumber 10, project documents,\n\n326\n00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,660\nbecause that just means everything, right.\n\n327\n00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,888\n[LAUGH] All of our documentation, which\nreally includes all these things up here,\n\n328\n00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:03,410\nso they could of made this a lot shorter.\n\n329\n00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,790\nBut I want to make sure that you see\nall these individual entities, right.\n\n330\n00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,020\nWe got our procurement documents.\n\n331\n00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,250\nThat would be any contract, right,\ncuz there's always a risk of breach of\n\n332\n00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,790\ncontract, and we're gonna talk about that\nin the procurement knowledge area later.\n\n333\n00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,450\nBut there's always that\nrisk of breach of contract.\n\n334\n00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:23,910\nSo all of these things are data\nthat we gather together, and\n\n335\n00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,340\nthen we do our risk analysis.\n\n336\n00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,160\nWe look at all this data, and\n\n337\n00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,250\nwe try to find anywhere that\nsomething could go wrong or\n\n338\n00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,779\nwhere anything could exceed expectations,\nright.\n\n339\n00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:42,260\nIn an earlier episode\nwe talked about doing\n\n340\n00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,940\nlike beta-\n>> Distribution?\n\n341\n00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,390\n>> Yeah, beta distributions and\ntriangular distributions.\n\n342\n00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,567\nAnd we talked about when we get a quote or\nan estimate we do a optimistic,\n\n343\n00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,530\npessimistic, and most likely.\n\n344\n00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,121\n>> Most likely.\n\n345\n00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:58,810\n>> So we're normally planning\naround the most likely.\n\n346\n00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,330\nBut our risk is documented right there.\n\n347\n00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:07,790\nOur opportunity, or our positive risk,\nis that most optimistic quote.\n\n348\n00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,480\nOur threat, or our negative risk,\nthat is the pessimistic,\n\n349\n00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,500\nright, the worst-case scenario.\n\n350\n00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,270\nThe most likely is what we act on.\n\n351\n00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,100\nSo we kind of already have that idea\nof where our risk is there in something\n\n352\n00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,730\noccurring, based on those quotes that\nwe got as far as cost and duration.\n\n353\n00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,680\nSo, we're just going back and\ngathering that data again, and\n\n354\n00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,410\nnow we're gonna make use of it, all right?\n\n355\n00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,460\nSo, we pull all that data from here.\n\n356\n00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,835\nWe go through, we identify everything,\nincluding our stakeholders and\n\n357\n00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,930\nrisks that can come from them.\n\n358\n00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,050\nI've got a number of stories on this.\n\n359\n00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,170\nI've dealt with people that I knew for\na fact change their minds a lot, right?\n\n360\n00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,150\nIf you have a project sponsor,\nwith bottomless pockets, right, or\n\n361\n00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,300\nbottomless wallets I guess would\nbe a better way of putting it.\n\n362\n00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,880\nIf you have a sponsor that has a ton\nof money and isn't worried about money,\n\n363\n00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,060\nthen they are very likely to\nchange requirements as you go.\n\n364\n00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,720\nAnd if you say, ooh, yeah,\nwe can do that, but it's gonna cost more,\n\n365\n00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,860\nthey go fine, do it.\n\n366\n00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,270\nI'm cool with that, right?\n\n367\n00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,680\nYour project's gonna be tough, because you\nknow early on that there's going to be\n\n368\n00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,220\nconstant change throughout this project\nbecause they don't have a limit of money.\n\n369\n00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,900\nIt seems like a good problem to have,\nbut it is frustrating as hell,\n\n370\n00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,920\nbecause it's hard to plan around that.\n\n371\n00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,120\nSo that is a thing that we would need to\nidentify in our stakeholder register.\n\n372\n00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:31,300\nOther things we need to look at\nare areas where we might have people who\n\n373\n00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,870\ncan't make decisions.\n\n374\n00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,570\nNow I've bumped into this,\nwhere you have a sponsor and\n\n375\n00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,230\nyou throw a question to them like hey,\nwe're\n\n376\n00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,790\nthinking about making this modification\nin order to facilitate this deadline.\n\n377\n00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,360\nWhat do you think?\n\n378\n00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,080\nAnd they go well,\nlet me think about it, right?\n\n379\n00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,130\nLet me go back and look at some paperwork.\n\n380\n00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,490\nAnd then a day goes by, two days go by,\nyou know I just haven't made up my mind.\n\n381\n00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,685\nThree days goes by, four days goes by,\nright, and a decision hasn't been made.\n\n382\n00:19:57,685 --> 00:19:58,950\nThat's a real challenge, okay.\n\n383\n00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,943\nI have something that my\ngrandfather taught me.\n\n384\n00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:08,245\nHe said, hey, I'm going into like old,\npointless stories now,\n\n385\n00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:10,405\nbut he had this saying.\n\n386\n00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:13,840\nHe said, when you're working on something,\nyou gotta make decisions.\n\n387\n00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,790\nMake a decision.\n\n388\n00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,890\nDon't delay.\n\n389\n00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,390\nIf you delay,\nthat in itself is making a decision.\n\n390\n00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,110\nYou're choosing to do nothing, all right?\n\n391\n00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,280\nAnd you're probably setting\nyourself up for failure.\n\n392\n00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,970\nBut he said if you make a decision now and\nit's wrong, you'll\n\n393\n00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,420\nprobably have time to fix it, but at least\nyou made a decision, you move forward.\n\n394\n00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,770\nIf you make a decision and it's right,\nyou've set yourself up for success.\n\n395\n00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,100\nYou made the right decision,\nyou move forward, right?\n\n396\n00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,040\nBut it all starts with\nmaking a decision and\n\n397\n00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,610\nknowing that sometimes\nwe're gonna be wrong.\n\n398\n00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,241\nYou can't make the right\ndecision every time,\n\n399\n00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:47,150\notherwise everyone would\nbe insanely successful.\n\n400\n00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,799\nAnd that's not the case.\n\n401\n00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,240\nSo, we got to make a decision.\n\n402\n00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,330\nIf you've got a stake\nholder who's notorious for\n\n403\n00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,760\nnot making decisions,\nyou've got to stay on top of them.\n\n404\n00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,276\nWhen they say, I need to think about it.\n\n405\n00:20:57,276 --> 00:21:00,900\nYou say, all right, what information\ndo you need to make a decision?\n\n406\n00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,490\nLet me help you get that information.\n\n407\n00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,770\nYou tell me what you want.\n\n408\n00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,260\nWhat format do you want this data in?\n\n409\n00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,170\nDo you like pie charts?\n\n410\n00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,780\nI can make pie charts.\n\n411\n00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,230\nWhatever you need to do,\nto get them to make that decision.\n\n412\n00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,150\nAnd you sit them in a room with you,\nor you sit in their office.\n\n413\n00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,380\nAnd you say, let me help you.\n\n414\n00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,030\nYou tell me what data you need,\nI'll give the data to you.\n\n415\n00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,450\nAnd then we'll make that decision.\n\n416\n00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,760\nBut you've got to make it.\n\n417\n00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,590\nSo, we can identify those\npeople very early on.\n\n418\n00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,330\nThere's a risk that they could derail\nyour project by not making a decision.\n\n419\n00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,482\nAnd if you know you're going to be\nworking with somebody like that,\n\n420\n00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:36,242\nyou need to set up a change board, where\nthey don't have control of the changes,\n\n421\n00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:37,430\nnot exclusive control.\n\n422\n00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,910\nSo that they can be outvoted,\nand you can move on.\n\n423\n00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,413\nBut you gotta have that process.\n\n424\n00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:42,539\nAll right, so\n\n425\n00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:47,490\nunder our Tools & Techniques, we got a lot\nof things to help us with this, right?\n\n426\n00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,270\nDocumentation Reviews.\n\n427\n00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,490\nThese are important,\n\n428\n00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,050\nespecially when it comes down\nto our work breakdown structure.\n\n429\n00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,200\nOur WBS is identifying all\nthe work that needs to be done\n\n430\n00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,798\nto the best of our ability.\n\n431\n00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,025\nWhenever possible ,you should bring in\na third party to evaluate the WBS and\n\n432\n00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:05,005\nsee if they reach the same conclusion.\n\n433\n00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:07,385\nIs there any work that\ndidn’t make it in there?\n\n434\n00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:08,735\nDid we leave something out?\n\n435\n00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:12,225\nBecause anything that we left out\nis going to introduce more time and\n\n436\n00:22:12,225 --> 00:22:16,000\nmore money that we may not have,\nall right, so a documentation review.\n\n437\n00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,430\nIt's also a chance for us to look and\n\n438\n00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,400\nsee if there's any documents that\nhaven't been created, right.\n\n439\n00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,652\nIs this project advancing\nwithout a charter?\n\n440\n00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:23,418\n>> Yeah.\n\n441\n00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:26,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've seen that so many times.\n\n442\n00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,670\nIt's advancing without a charter so\nit's got no authority.\n\n443\n00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,740\nSo this project can be cancelled at any\nmoment because technically it was never\n\n444\n00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,050\nauthorized to happen.\n\n445\n00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,000\nWe identify that right here.\n\n446\n00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,640\nAnd we either fix it or the project ends.\n\n447\n00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,070\nNip it in the bud before execution starts.\n\n448\n00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,270\nWe're not going to be out of a lot\nof money until execution starts.\n\n449\n00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,792\nIf you stop once execution is running,\nyou've lost money.\n\n450\n00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:51,660\nAll right, we've also got our\ninformation gathering techniques.\n\n451\n00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,790\nWe reach out and\nwe get any additional information we need.\n\n452\n00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,820\nAnd there's a ton of ways to\ngo about things like that.\n\n453\n00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,683\nLet's see, do we-\n>> Yeah,\n\n454\n00:22:59,683 --> 00:23:00,250\nthere's a few of them mentioned in there.\n\n455\n00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,040\n>> All right,\nlet me pull up the notes here.\n\n456\n00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,600\nLet's see, identify risks, and\n\n457\n00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,780\nwe've got, those are all things\nwe've kind of talked about.\n\n458\n00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,280\nI went too far.\n\n459\n00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,370\nThere we go.\n\n460\n00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,040\nSo information gathering techniques,\nI know we've talked about some of these.\n\n461\n00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,650\nLike brainstorming, we've talked about.\n\n462\n00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,210\nInterviewing, we've talked about.\n\n463\n00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,190\nRoot cause analysis,\nwe've talked a little bit about.\n\n464\n00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,200\nI don't think we've talked\nabout Delphi at all, have we?\n\n465\n00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,140\n>> No.\n\n466\n00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,350\n>> All right, so\nDelphi technique is kinda neat.\n\n467\n00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,880\nIn a way it's kind of like\nthe nominal group technique\n\n468\n00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,970\nwhere we get a group of people,\nand we get information from them.\n\n469\n00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,368\nAnd in nominal,\nsome people count more than others.\n\n470\n00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:37,668\nThere's a little bit of weight there.\n\n471\n00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:40,885\nBut you're trying to get ideas\nfrom all the various people.\n\n472\n00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:42,895\nThe Delphi technique goes\na step further and it says,\n\n473\n00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:46,645\nwhen you get a bunch of people in a room,\nthey affect each other.\n\n474\n00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:49,455\nThey affect and\nimpact what each other thinks.\n\n475\n00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:52,731\nOne person feeds off of the next or\none person is subverted.\n\n476\n00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,053\nI call it steamrolling.\n\n477\n00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:59,417\nEvery company has that employee\nwho is Super alpha type, right?\n\n478\n00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:03,855\nWhere they have an idea, and\ndag gummit, it is the best idea, and\n\n479\n00:24:03,855 --> 00:24:06,710\nthey won't listen to anybody else.\n\n480\n00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,280\nAnd if somebody starts to promote\nother ideas, they steamroll them.\n\n481\n00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,390\nThey just throw out all this information,\nand\n\n482\n00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,790\nit basically hinders other people\nfrom presenting their ideas.\n\n483\n00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,450\nEventually they get to the point\nwhere they say, you know what?\n\n484\n00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,100\nI'm just not even gonna say anything\ncuz I know Bob in accounting is\n\n485\n00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,640\ngonna go all crazy, so\nI'll just let it go, right?\n\n486\n00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,150\nWell, with Delphi technique\nwe do it like this.\n\n487\n00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,290\nWe say, let's do it anonymously.\n\n488\n00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:32,460\nLet's have where we send out\na questionnaire to everybody and\n\n489\n00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,940\nthey fill it out by themselves.\n\n490\n00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,260\nThey fill out their ideas and\ntheir information, and\n\n491\n00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,450\nwe bring it all back together and\nwe don't necessarily know who did.\n\n492\n00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,490\nI mean, you can do it with names but\nnormally you don't.\n\n493\n00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,310\nSo you don't know who\nprovided these ideas.\n\n494\n00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,290\nAnd now you can look at it unbiased,\nand figure out which one is the best.\n\n495\n00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,610\nAnd nobody has that opportunity\nto overrule, or whatever.\n\n496\n00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,440\nIt's a neat technique.\n\n497\n00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,910\nAll right.\n\n498\n00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,400\nRoot cause analysis.\n\n499\n00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,280\nWhen we were talking a little bit\nabout quality, we talked about this.\n\n500\n00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,480\nThat if we have a defect,\nwhat's causing it?\n\n501\n00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,470\nWhat is the root cause?\n\n502\n00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,690\nAnd there might be more then one cause,\nso we're looking for the main one.\n\n503\n00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,330\nAnd when you're dealing\nwith things like defects,\n\n504\n00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,710\nthere's always the symptom and the cause.\n\n505\n00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,450\nDoctors talk about this a lot.\n\n506\n00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,230\nSomebody comes in with a runny nose.\n\n507\n00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,580\nWell the runny nose is the symptom,\nwhat is the cause?\n\n508\n00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:26,600\nWell, they've got a viral sinus infection,\nright, or something like that.\n\n509\n00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,510\nSo, the runny nose is a symptom,\nthe sinus infection is the cause.\n\n510\n00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,450\nSo if we treat the runny nose,\n\n511\n00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,630\nlike a antihistamine, that doesn't\nhelp with the sinus infection.\n\n512\n00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,920\nSo you've gotta make sure you\nfind out what that root cause is.\n\n513\n00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,890\nSo we basically break down\nwhatever our problem is,\n\n514\n00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,920\nwhatever it is we're dealing with, and\nwe try and find not just the symptoms,\n\n515\n00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,530\nbut what's actually\nleading to that to occur.\n\n516\n00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,680\nAnd that's where those fishbone and\nIshikawa Diagrams that we talked about,\n\n517\n00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,000\nthat's where those come in.\n\n518\n00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,310\nThe other things that we have\nare pretty common sense.\n\n519\n00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,280\nChecklist analysis.\n\n520\n00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,540\nIn the quality process group or\n\n521\n00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,070\nknowledge area,\nwe came up with checklists to follow.\n\n522\n00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,814\nWhen we're monitoring,\ncontrolling our project,\n\n523\n00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:13,040\nhow do we know if the things\nare getting done, we've got checklists.\n\n524\n00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,100\nWell, we need to look at those checklists\nand say are they thorough enough?\n\n525\n00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,550\nAre they properly cataloging\nthe information to ensure success?\n\n526\n00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,100\nAre there negative scenarios that can\nhappen that this checklist is not going\n\n527\n00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,640\nto capture?\n\n528\n00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,370\nAssumptions analysis,\n\n529\n00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,170\nwe've seen it on a few forms now where\nwe document any assumptions we've made.\n\n530\n00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,170\nWell we make an assumption, I can say,\n\n531\n00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,960\nwe're gonna plan an outdoor rock concert,\nand I'm assuming that we'll be able to\n\n532\n00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,130\nreserve some tents, and\nwe don't actually have to rent them.\n\n533\n00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,520\nWe can just reserve them, and if we\nneed them, we'll have them available.\n\n534\n00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,390\nSo that's my assumption.\n\n535\n00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,560\nWell, as we identify risk,\n\n536\n00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,840\nwe need to look at it and\nsay is that assumption realistic?\n\n537\n00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,210\nWhat company is gonna offer for\nme to reserve tents for\n\n538\n00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,900\nthe day and\nnot actually charge me full rental price?\n\n539\n00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,830\nCuz they can't use the tents\nif I've reserved them,\n\n540\n00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,770\nso I might as well be renting them.\n\n541\n00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,600\nThe only difference is\nwhether I set them up or not.\n\n542\n00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,728\nThat might not be a realistic assumption.\n\n543\n00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:17,880\nAnd so, if we identify that, we need to\nchange that assumption to become a fact,\n\n544\n00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,700\nto be no, that's not realistic.\n\n545\n00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,690\nYou need to plan for\nnot paying your reserve price but\n\n546\n00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,960\npaying the full rental price\neven if you don't use the tents.\n\n547\n00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,900\nSo that's the kind of thing we\nstart with in assumption analysis.\n\n548\n00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,380\nHow accurate,\nhow realistic are those assumptions?\n\n549\n00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,870\nAnd is there anything we can\ndo to make them more factual?\n\n550\n00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,190\nOur diagram techniques, we saw a lot\nof diagrams in the shows yesterday.\n\n551\n00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,590\nBut, you got your cause and\n\n552\n00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:47,390\neffect diagrams, your flow charts and\nyour influence diagrams.\n\n553\n00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,680\nInfluence, what activities\ninfluence other ones.\n\n554\n00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,380\nYou see that with like your project\nschedule network diagram and stuff.\n\n555\n00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,460\nSo identifying that information,\nthat's not really anything new.\n\n556\n00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,390\nAll right, but the big one here, the big\nnew one that we've got, the one that's\n\n557\n00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:08,260\nprobably the most important technique,\nis what's called a SWOT analysis.\n\n558\n00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:14,380\nA SWOT analysis is strength,\nweakness, opportunity, threat.\n\n559\n00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,650\nYou look at every activity\nin your project, every idea,\n\n560\n00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,220\nevery assumption everything,\nand you say all right,\n\n561\n00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,550\nwhat are the strengths, and\nweaknesses, of how we're doing this?\n\n562\n00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,800\nWe've chosen a way to achieve this goal.\n\n563\n00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,740\nWhat's the strength of it?\n\n564\n00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,321\nWhat makes this the right way?\n\n565\n00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:33,901\nWhat are the weaknesses?\n\n566\n00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:36,270\nWhat are the trade offs I've\nmade by choosing this option?\n\n567\n00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,950\nAnd then after we figured\nthat out we start,\n\n568\n00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,300\nwhat are the opportunities and threats?\n\n569\n00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,320\nOpportunities, what are the positive\nrisks that I might be able to amplify or\n\n570\n00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,320\nexploit, and then threats,\nwhat are the negative risks?\n\n571\n00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,150\nThe things I need to avoid,\nI need to reduce whenever possible.\n\n572\n00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,130\nSo, maybe we're building a house and\nwe're on a tight deadline.\n\n573\n00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,840\nAnd so we say, all right,\nif we pour a full cement foundation,\n\n574\n00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,060\nthere's gonna be like a three\nday wait while that thing dries.\n\n575\n00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,580\nI don't have that kind of time.\n\n576\n00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,800\nSo what if we don't do\na cement poured foundation?\n\n577\n00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,740\nWhat if instead we just raised the house\nup a foot and a half off the ground and\n\n578\n00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,870\nbuild it without a true foundation.\n\n579\n00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,620\nWe'll just those pylons down there and\nstand the house on it.\n\n580\n00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,320\nAll right?\n\n581\n00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,610\nWell the strength of that plan is that\nI don't have to wait three days for\n\n582\n00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,210\ncement to dry.\n\n583\n00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,560\nWe can act as soon as\nthose pylons are down.\n\n584\n00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,770\nThe pylons take like an hour to put\ndown and then we're in business.\n\n585\n00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,630\nRight?\nThere's my strength.\n\n586\n00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,820\nMy weakness?\n\n587\n00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,410\nI don't have a foundation.\n\n588\n00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:38,080\nAnd so if there is a tornado, or\nearthquake, or something like that,\n\n589\n00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840\nthis house might be more susceptible\nto seismic activity or whatever, right?\n\n590\n00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,350\nAnd that might be my weakness.\n\n591\n00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,230\nOr a skunk might move in under the house,\nright?\n\n592\n00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,050\nWho knows.\n\n593\n00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,660\nSo there's my weakness.\n\n594\n00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,350\nIt might also affect\nthe overall value of the house,\n\n595\n00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,800\nnot having a true foundation might\nlower the value of the house.\n\n596\n00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,390\nSo these are weaknesses\nthat we need to identify.\n\n597\n00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,910\nAnd then we say opportunities and threats.\n\n598\n00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,100\nWhat's my opportunity?\n\n599\n00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,550\nMy opportunity is that I can\nfinish three days early.\n\n600\n00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,840\nI could gain back three days, so\nI'm not waiting on a foundation to dry.\n\n601\n00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,430\nAll right.\n\n602\n00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,540\nMy other opportunity is it might be\neasier for the plumbers to look.\n\n603\n00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,030\nCuz the plumbers can\nget under the house and\n\n604\n00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,390\nrun plumbing even after the floor is in,\nmaybe they couldn't normally do that.\n\n605\n00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,570\nSo now I can get the plumbers working,\n\n606\n00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,430\nat the same time as the electricians or\nwhatever.\n\n607\n00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,320\nSo again I can fast track my project and\nget things done faster.\n\n608\n00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,800\nThat's an opportunity.\n\n609\n00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,930\nI need to look at the rest\nof my activities,\n\n610\n00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,289\nand find out where I might be able to fast\ntrack, and how much I can shave time off.\n\n611\n00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,550\nMy threat, though, is we try and\n\n612\n00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:38,390\ndo this raised up house and some problem\noccurs, some issue happens where\n\n613\n00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,590\nI'm not able to perform something\nproperly or I violate code.\n\n614\n00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,580\nMaybe the pylons don't sit right and\n\n615\n00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,750\nI end up having to spend three days just\ngetting the pylons put in place and now I\n\n616\n00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,920\nend up in the same time schedule I had\nbefore, but without a solid foundation.\n\n617\n00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,810\nSo what can I do to minimize that,\nto insure the pylons are put in properly?\n\n618\n00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,490\nWhat kind of planning can I\ngo through to mitigate that?\n\n619\n00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,860\nWe find all of that in a SWOT analysis.\n\n620\n00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,150\nSo real important that we do these.\n\n621\n00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,760\nAnd how do we do that analysis?\n\n622\n00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,650\nWell we use a lot of these things, expert\njudgement, meetings, Delphi technique,\n\n623\n00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,130\nwe use all these different things to find\nout from everybody else what they feel\n\n624\n00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,385\nare the strengths, weaknesses,\nopportunities, and threat, or SWOT.\n\n625\n00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,760\nIf you look this up online,\n\n626\n00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,110\nyou'll find there's many arguments\nas to what SWOT stands for, so\n\n627\n00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:35,160\nthere are other ones, but with PMI,\nstrength, weakness, opportunity, threat.\n\n628\n00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,595\nThat's what you want to remember for\nthe exam.\n\n629\n00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:43,084\nAll right, after we apply our\nexpert judgement to all of that,\n\n630\n00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:45,286\nwe gather the data together and\n\n631\n00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:50,468\nnow we create one of our super\nimportant documents, the risk register.\n\n632\n00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:54,779\nAnd the risk register is just\na list Of all the risks.\n\n633\n00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,370\nWe're not coming up with mathematical data\njust yet, it just identifying the risk.\n\n634\n00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,260\nSome might be outlandish,\nsome we might not even care about, but\n\n635\n00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,280\nwe need that list.\n\n636\n00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,720\nWe need the information,\nand we put it together.\n\n637\n00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,490\nAnd I think I've got a risk\nregistered template.\n\n638\n00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:07,990\nYeah.\n\n639\n00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,180\nHere we go.\n\n640\n00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,320\nSo here's an example of\nthat risk register, and\n\n641\n00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,200\nwe'll look more into\nthis a little bit later.\n\n642\n00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,950\nBut, basically what you'll see\nis we create a risk statement.\n\n643\n00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,610\nWhat that risk is and\nthat's all we're creating at this point.\n\n644\n00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,520\nWe don't have any of this\nother data just yet, okay.\n\n645\n00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,390\nSo, we're just trying to fill out this\nrisk statement, just listing in that name.\n\n646\n00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,310\nAnd we'll fill the rest\nof the data out as we go.\n\n647\n00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,250\nBut it's basically going to include\nthings like what's the probability of it\n\n648\n00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:37,760\nhappening.\n\n649\n00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,580\nWhat's the impact at each phase and so on.\n\n650\n00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,610\nAnd we'll see how we get\nto that a little bit later.\n\n651\n00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,680\nBut that's an example of\na risk register right there.\n\n652\n00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,990\nBecause it's just containing the name and\n\n653\n00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,930\nnot a lot of detailed data, we'll\nprobably also create a risk data sheet.\n\n654\n00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:59,030\nAnd the risk data sheet allows us to\nbreak down an individual risk and\n\n655\n00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,560\nthe data regarding it.\n\n656\n00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,090\nSo this sheet, we fill out one for\nevery single risk we have.\n\n657\n00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:10,640\nThe risk description, the cause, the\nimpact, any secondary or residual risk,\n\n658\n00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,810\ncontingency plans, all of this, this is\nthe detailed information about the risk.\n\n659\n00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,595\nThe risk register is kind of high level,\nright?\n\n660\n00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:22,585\nJust the name of the risk,\nand its other probabilities.\n\n661\n00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:26,435\nAnd then the risk data sheet\nis where we go crazy, right?\n\n662\n00:33:26,435 --> 00:33:30,660\nSo when we're having a meeting where we're\ntrying to identify risks we'd probably\n\n663\n00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,380\njust print out 50 or 60 of these, and then\nwe fill them out as the meeting goes on,\n\n664\n00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,570\nand then we populate\nthe data as we get it.\n\n665\n00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,060\nWell this is probably a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n666\n00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,560\nSo why don't we pause here.\n\n667\n00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,200\nWhen we get back,\nwe've got some more risks stuff to talk\n\n668\n00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,785\nabout-\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n669\n00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:47,620\n>> So we'll get into that.\n\n670\n00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,810\nAnd it's risky business.\n\n671\n00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,862\n>> It is risky business.\n\n672\n00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:55,080\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n673\n00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,808\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n674\n00:33:57,808 --> 00:33:58,934\n[MUSIC]\n\n675\n00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:02,035\n[SOUND] Alright, welcome back everybody.\n\n676\n00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:08,023\nSo in the last process we were talking\nabout identifying the risks and\n\n677\n00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:12,564\nour goal was to come up with\na great big list of risks,\n\n678\n00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:16,820\nevery risk we could\nthink of in our project.\n\n679\n00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,249\nAny where we felt like\nthe schedule might slip and\n\n680\n00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:21,810\ncause the project to fall behind schedule.\n\n681\n00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,730\nAnywhere we might have a bad estimate,\n\n682\n00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,730\nan estimate made on limited data\nwhere we might go over budget.\n\n683\n00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,470\nAnywhere that we identify\nrisk in our project.\n\n684\n00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,870\nThe problem with doing\nsomething like that is,\n\n685\n00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,030\nnow that we've got this great big list,\nwe have to figure out what to do about it.\n\n686\n00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,320\nAnd some risks are more\nimportant Important than others.\n\n687\n00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,918\nSo for example, we have insurance on this\nbuilding, on this studio that we're in.\n\n688\n00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,150\nIf there were a forest fire,\nwhich we seem to have all the time.\n\n689\n00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,390\nIf there was a hurricane.\n\n690\n00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,985\nIf something like that came through and\ntore this building down insurance will\n\n691\n00:34:54,985 --> 00:34:58,210\ncover it, we can build a new building and\nwe'll be back in business.\n\n692\n00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:58,930\nRight?\n\n693\n00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,920\nBut while the building is destroyed,\nit's gonna knock us off air.\n\n694\n00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,710\nWe're an internet company,\nwe need to be on air,\n\n695\n00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,930\nif we're not we're not\nservicing our customers.\n\n696\n00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:16,311\nSo that's a big deal for\n\n697\n00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:19,826\nus, right?\n\n698\n00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,702\nAnd so we have contingencies in place\nplace to handle that.There's also a risk\n\n699\n00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,578\nthat a meteor could come down from outer\nspace and just analate this building and\n\n700\n00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:24,650\nwipe our entire staff.\n\n701\n00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,455\nIt's real, it can happen, I saw that\nmovie deep impact, it can happen.\n\n702\n00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:33,990\n[LAUGH] But, It's so unlikely.\n\n703\n00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,652\nThe odds of it happening are so,\nno pun intended, astronomical [LAUGH].\n\n704\n00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:39,730\nI'm very witty today.\n\n705\n00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,150\nSo astronomical that it's not even\nworth planning for something like that.\n\n706\n00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:49,210\nIt's not even worth thinking\nabout because it's just super,\n\n707\n00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,870\nsuper unlikely, I'll probably win the\nlottery five or six times between now and\n\n708\n00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,830\nthen anyway so\nwe wont have to worry about that.\n\n709\n00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,970\nSo, that's one of the things that we need\nto think about when we deal with risk and\n\n710\n00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,840\nthat's what leads us to our\nnext process group which is,\n\n711\n00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,930\nPerform Qualitative Risk Analysis,\nall right?\n\n712\n00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,810\nQualitative risk analysis is\nwhere we do the hard work.\n\n713\n00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,380\nAll of these risks that we just\nidentified, we need to assign\n\n714\n00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,630\nnumbers to them so we can figure\nout what the heck they mean, right?\n\n715\n00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,750\nWe need to make it where we\nunderstand the importance.\n\n716\n00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:31,140\nEvery risk can be broken down into two\ncharacteristics, impact and probability.\n\n717\n00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,530\nAnd the concept is really simple.\n\n718\n00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,230\nProbability, what's the likelihood\nof this risk is going to occur?\n\n719\n00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,140\nAnd if it's a positive and negative risk\nwhat's the likelihood of going either way.\n\n720\n00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,700\nSo, we need to know\nthat likelihood because\n\n721\n00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,390\nthat's what going to determine in a large\npart whether we need to deal with it.\n\n722\n00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,450\nAnd then there's the impact,\nhow big of a deal is it going to be?\n\n723\n00:36:52,055 --> 00:36:55,215\nThere is a risk, we have a show\nscheduled tomorrow, more PMP.\n\n724\n00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,655\nThere is a risk that it\nmight rain tomorrow, right?\n\n725\n00:36:58,655 --> 00:37:00,895\nI know there's a risk, there's like\na 30% chance of rain or something.\n\n726\n00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:04,885\nWhich you know, a significant percentage\nso odds are it'll probably rain tomorrow.\n\n727\n00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,490\nBut, what's the impact, right?\n\n728\n00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,480\nThe impact is nothing.\n\n729\n00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,930\nWe shoot inside, right.\n\n730\n00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,720\nIt would have to be a really,\nreally, really bad thunderstorm for\n\n731\n00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,530\nus to not record.\n\n732\n00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,890\n>> Right.\n>> And, that's happened a few times.\n\n733\n00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,440\nBut it would have to be really bad.\n\n734\n00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,910\nSo, even though there's a high likelihood\nthat somethings going to occur,\n\n735\n00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,900\nlet's say it was 80%\nchance of rain tomorrow,\n\n736\n00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,220\neven though there's a high likelihood\nit's gonna occur, the impact is so small.\n\n737\n00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,070\nIt's gonna annoy us, my shirt might be\na little wet when I first come in, so\n\n738\n00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,270\nI have to let that dry before we shoot.\n\n739\n00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,950\nBut other than that,\nnot a big deal, right?\n\n740\n00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,485\nSo, if the probability is high and\n\n741\n00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:45,130\nthe impact is low,\nwe might not need to do anything.\n\n742\n00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:51,060\nIf the impact is high and the probability\nis low we might not need to do anything.\n\n743\n00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,960\nIf both of them are high,\nif probably and impact are high,\n\n744\n00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,980\nwe absolutely need to do something, we\nneed to do something to control that risk.\n\n745\n00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,910\nAnd so, that's what this\nprocess is helping us with,\n\n746\n00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,540\nwe're not planning what to do yet.\n\n747\n00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,390\nWe're just trying to identify\nthe risks we need to worry about.\n\n748\n00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,740\nSo, we go and we get that risk\nregister that we just made, right?\n\n749\n00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,150\nSo that last process group\nhad us create a list\n\n750\n00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,370\nof all the potential risks\nthat effect my project.\n\n751\n00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,640\nAll right.\n\n752\n00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,420\nNow we start to deal with it.\n\n753\n00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,200\nAnd we also have our risk management plan.\n\n754\n00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,210\nAnd our scope baseline is input.\n\n755\n00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:30,580\nOur scope baseline, that's gonna be\nlisting our budget, our schedule and\n\n756\n00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,930\nour requirements.\n\n757\n00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:36,140\nAs they are right now, as part of our\nplan, unchanged by future events right.\n\n758\n00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,270\nSo if things go they way we want them to.\n\n759\n00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,900\nThe scope baseline is gonna hold true.\n\n760\n00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,090\nWhat are the risks that center around it.\n\n761\n00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,260\nAll right.\n\n762\n00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,460\nThen, we apply a couple of simple things.\n\n763\n00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,710\nWe start off by doing what's called\na risk probability and impact assessment.\n\n764\n00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,160\nThat means that we look at\neach risk in that list.\n\n765\n00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,000\nWe go line by line.\n\n766\n00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,580\nIf there's five risks, it's easy.\n\n767\n00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,630\nIf there's 500 risks,\nthis is gonna take a while, right?\n\n768\n00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,260\nAnd on each one we come\nup with a probability.\n\n769\n00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,090\nWhat's the likelihood of it occurring.\n\n770\n00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,359\nAnd it's possible that there's different\nlikelihoods based on date and time so\n\n771\n00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,670\nwe gotta really work that out.\n\n772\n00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,710\nBut what's the likelihood of it occurring?\n\n773\n00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,140\nWe need to assign a number.\n\n774\n00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,430\nRight, and, and we typically do\npercentages right, 80%, 20% whatever.\n\n775\n00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,140\nThen we come up with a impact and\n\n776\n00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,160\nyou know you can use whatever\nscale you want for impact.\n\n777\n00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,280\nI generally use a scale of one to ten.\n\n778\n00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,420\nRight, and\nI do this because of the percentages,\n\n779\n00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,930\nwe're doing on the probabilities.\n\n780\n00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,860\nThe probability, 0% means, something\nis absolutely not going to happen,\n\n781\n00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,730\na 100% means that it\nabsolutely is going to happen.\n\n782\n00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,300\nNow is it a risk if it's zero or\na hundred percent?\n\n783\n00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,132\nNo, right.\n\n784\n00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,851\nBecause it's a known fact at that point.\n\n785\n00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:48,152\nYou know it's not gonna happen, or\nyou know it is going to happen,\n\n786\n00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,260\nit's not a risk anymore,\nit's just a part of your project.\n\n787\n00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,319\nBut if it's 10% to 90%,\nor really 1% to 99%,\n\n788\n00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:56,010\nnow it's a risk,\nit could go either way, right.\n\n789\n00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:02,350\nSame thing with impact, but I need to\nbe able to compare the two together.\n\n790\n00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:06,180\nSo, by putting impact on\na scale of zero to ten,\n\n791\n00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,310\nit's the same thing as\nthe percentages that goes 0 to 100%.\n\n792\n00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,330\nI have numbers that I can\ncompare pretty easily.\n\n793\n00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,800\nBut it's up to you how you\nwanna do your probabilities.\n\n794\n00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,150\nSo we just need to go down that list,\nand assign a impact, right?\n\n795\n00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,630\nSo I might say, on a scale of one to ten,\n\n796\n00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,310\nthis has an impact of one,\nvery little impact.\n\n797\n00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:29,410\nOr this has an impact of 10, it will cause\nmy project to fail without a doubt, right?\n\n798\n00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,054\nThat's my scale.\n\n799\n00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:33,792\nWell, in your risk management plan,\nyou defined that.\n\n800\n00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,610\nYou defined what you consider your impact.\n\n801\n00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,490\nNow remember the template I showed\nyou had, what were they, it was high,\n\n802\n00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,410\nvery high, normal, low,\nvery low or something like that.\n\n803\n00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,830\nSo you might use that terminology for\nyour impact.\n\n804\n00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:51,600\nI like numbers, so\nI just get a one to ten.\n\n805\n00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,080\nThen once you've gathered that data for\nevery single risk, right.\n\n806\n00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,400\nHow significant is the risk,\nhow much damage is it gonna do.\n\n807\n00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,740\nWhat's the likelihood\nthat it's gonna occur.\n\n808\n00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,420\nThen we can start to chart that out on\nwhat’s called a probability matrix.\n\n809\n00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,636\nThe probability matrix is, it's one of\nmy favorite documents because its super\n\n810\n00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:13,390\nsimple, it's common sense and\nit really works out.\n\n811\n00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,170\nAnd everybody looks at it and\nimmediately understands what it does.\n\n812\n00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,930\nSo what I've got is I've got a few things.\n\n813\n00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,100\nFirst off, I have my probability and\nimpact assessment, all right?\n\n814\n00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,360\nSo for each risk,\nI'm going to come through and\n\n815\n00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,720\nI'm going to catalog,\nwhat is the scope impact, right?\n\n816\n00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,090\nIs it very high?\n\n817\n00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,240\nIs it very low or whatever.\n\n818\n00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,140\nWhat's the quality impact, the schedule\nimpact, the cost impact, right?\n\n819\n00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,560\nThese are all things we saw in the plan.\n\n820\n00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,240\nWhat's the probability?\n\n821\n00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,370\nHow likely is it going to occur?\n\n822\n00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:47,820\nAnd then based on all of this information,\n\n823\n00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,060\nI need to come up with\nwhat's called a risk rating.\n\n824\n00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,470\nThe risk rating is the risk as whole,\ntaking probability and\n\n825\n00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:01,470\nimpact into account, what is the odds\nI'm gonna have to deal with this.\n\n826\n00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:05,179\nAnd, that risk rating comes from\na combination of probability and impact.\n\n827\n00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:08,604\nAnd to do that, I use a risk matrix.\n\n828\n00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:14,620\nSo let me pull up my risk, my probability\nand impact matrix, all right?\n\n829\n00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,830\nAnd that sounds like a really complex\ndocument, but it really isn't.\n\n830\n00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,380\nIt's pretty straight forward.\n\n831\n00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,100\nWhat we do,\nis we take a document like this, and\n\n832\n00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,270\nthis is working on\nthe template terminology.\n\n833\n00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:30,115\nIf I say very low, low, medium,\nhigh, now I mention for me,\n\n834\n00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:32,255\nin real life, I use numbers.\n\n835\n00:42:32,255 --> 00:42:34,750\nSo over here on the left,\nI might have my probabilities.\n\n836\n00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:40,165\nStarting with 10%, 20, 30,\n40, all the way up to 90%.\n\n837\n00:42:40,165 --> 00:42:43,900\nI don't normally bother with 100% and\nI don't bother with 0.\n\n838\n00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,980\nSo we kinda mapped those\nup along the side.\n\n839\n00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,430\nAnd then across the bottom\nwe have our impact.\n\n840\n00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,550\nWhat is the impact on the project?\n\n841\n00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,815\nHow big of a deal is it going to be,\nfrom very low all the way up to very high,\n\n842\n00:42:55,815 --> 00:42:57,007\nokay?\n\n843\n00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:02,250\nSo let's use our show as an example.\n\n844\n00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,170\nAnd say it might rain tomorrow.\n\n845\n00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,090\nWell, there's a 20% chance\nthat it might rain tomorrow.\n\n846\n00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,570\nSo that is a fairly low probability.\n\n847\n00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,150\nSo looking at my list here I'm gonna\nsay that's a low probability so\n\n848\n00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,150\nit's gonna be in this row.\n\n849\n00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,040\nThen I say the impact.\n\n850\n00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,470\nWhat's the impact if it rains tomorrow?\n\n851\n00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,870\nNot a big deal at all for us.\n\n852\n00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,060\nWe have a roof, right?\n\n853\n00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,880\nSo, I'll just put your chance of rain,\nright?\n\n854\n00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,100\nSo, it might rain.\n\n855\n00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,310\nSo I'll just stick that right\nthere in that box, all right?\n\n856\n00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,038\nThere could be a hurricane tomorrow,\nright?\n\n857\n00:43:32,038 --> 00:43:35,720\nA hurricane, it's a,\nwe are in a hurricane, wait,\n\n858\n00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,260\nare we in hurricane season right now?\n\n859\n00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:41,040\nIt starts in July so it's not\nhurricane season yet so it's very low.\n\n860\n00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,660\nBut let's say I'm planning for\n\n861\n00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,000\nsomething in August, which is in the heat\nof the hurricane season here in Florida.\n\n862\n00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,990\nSo if it's in August, I probably have\na medium chance of that hurricane.\n\n863\n00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:54,630\nIf a hurricane comes through, though,\nwe will shut the studio down.\n\n864\n00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,890\nSo how will that impact our show?\n\n865\n00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:57,850\nIt's pretty high.\n\n866\n00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:01,082\nI'm not gonna put very high, it's not\ngonna stop the show from ever airing\n\n867\n00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:03,151\nagain, but it'll shut us down for\na day or two.\n\n868\n00:44:03,151 --> 00:44:06,541\nSo I'm gonna put that in here,\nhurricane all right?\n\n869\n00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:11,690\nWhat about worker strike, right?\n\n870\n00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,780\nWe're non-union, but if we had a worker's\nstrike, so Nate and Jason decide\n\n871\n00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:21,730\nthat's it, we're done, we're not gonna\nwork for you, your tyranny any more.\n\n872\n00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,590\nSo [LAUGH] they decided that,\nand they walk off the set.\n\n873\n00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,070\nWell if we don't have a director and\n\n874\n00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,210\nwe don't have a producer,\nit's gonna be really hard to do the show.\n\n875\n00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:33,690\nThe show would have one camera angle,\nand no credits, and all that stuff.\n\n876\n00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,270\nSo the likelihood of that happening, I'd\nlike to think is very low, but who knows?\n\n877\n00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,110\nMaybe the seeds of discord have been sown.\n\n878\n00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,980\nSo we've had to evaluate our employee\nhappiness there to determine\n\n879\n00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,970\nthe probability.\n\n880\n00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,790\nThe impact would be pretty high though.\n\n881\n00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:49,190\nSo I'm gonna put that\nunder here under medium.\n\n882\n00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,260\nAnd we'll just say employee strike.\n\n883\n00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,920\nAll right,\nthere might be other things though like\n\n884\n00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,120\na meteor destroying the building.\n\n885\n00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,760\nVery low probability\nthat that would happen.\n\n886\n00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,450\nBut very high impact Meteor strike, right?\n\n887\n00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,920\nSo that would be a big deal, all right?\n\n888\n00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,300\nLet's go with something a little\nmore realistic though, all right?\n\n889\n00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,080\nWhat about our Internet connection fails?\n\n890\n00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,650\nNow we have a 40 megabit fiber optic\nconnection that we feed our stream over,\n\n891\n00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,560\nthat's a pretty good connection,\npretty rock solid.\n\n892\n00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,820\nBut things can go wrong.\n\n893\n00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,410\nAnd in fact they go\nwrong from time to time.\n\n894\n00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,970\nWe've had it happen a few times\nin the years we've had that line.\n\n895\n00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:32,440\nSo I'm gonna put that up here at high,\nand the impact is pretty significant.\n\n896\n00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,050\nIf our internet connection goes down,\nwe can't stream you guys live.\n\n897\n00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:38,563\nWe can still record and then we can put\nthe show up, but we lose that live thing,\n\n898\n00:45:38,563 --> 00:45:40,708\nwhich is something that\nwe pride ourselves in.\n\n899\n00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:46,055\nSo I'll put ISP failure here,\nall right, it's a high impact,\n\n900\n00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:50,226\nI mean a high probability and\na high impact right?\n\n901\n00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:51,320\nI've just kind of categorizing, right.\n\n902\n00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,170\nNow notice how I've flagged some\nof these as red, some as yellow,\n\n903\n00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,130\nsome as green okay?\n\n904\n00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,600\nIf something is in the red that means it's\ngot a high probability and a high impact.\n\n905\n00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,760\nI absolutely need to deal with that.\n\n906\n00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,920\nI need to find some way to either\neliminate the risk, or minimize the risk.\n\n907\n00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,803\nIf something is in the yellow,\nI may not need to take direct action, but\n\n908\n00:46:16,803 --> 00:46:20,192\nI do need to come up with some\nkind of a plan, to deal with that.\n\n909\n00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:23,301\nAnd then if something is\ndown here in the green,\n\n910\n00:46:23,301 --> 00:46:28,606\nthat means it's either got a low impact,\nor a low probability, or both are low.\n\n911\n00:46:28,606 --> 00:46:32,750\nAnd in which case I probably\ndon't need to do anything at all.\n\n912\n00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:38,240\nI can honestly tell you guys we do not\nhave a rain plan for tomorrow, all right.\n\n913\n00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,040\nAnd, you know,\nit probably will rain tomorrow.\n\n914\n00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,050\nIt's looking kind of cloudy out there.\n\n915\n00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,820\nSo that's an example of a real thing.\n\n916\n00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,520\nI know the risk.\n\n917\n00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,200\nI identified it, but\nI'm not going to deal with it.\n\n918\n00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,056\nAnd in fact, meteor strike,\nit's got a high probability so\n\n919\n00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:51,960\nit's bumped all the way up here.\n\n920\n00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,800\nBut you know what?\n\n921\n00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,640\n>> What can you do?\n>> I'm not gonna\n\n922\n00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,000\ndeal with that either, right?\n\n923\n00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,380\nWe do have insurance and stuff, but\nI'm just not gonna deal with it.\n\n924\n00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,040\nIt's just so unlikely.\n\n925\n00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,810\nSo in the yellow,\nit's kind of a judgement call.\n\n926\n00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:06,190\nIn the green it's pretty obvious\nwe don't need to do anything.\n\n927\n00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:10,350\nIn the red it's pretty obvious\nwe do need to do something.\n\n928\n00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:14,060\nThis is a, you'll hear it called\na risk matrix or a probability and\n\n929\n00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:19,100\nimpact matrix cuz you're comparing those\ntwo to determine where something falls.\n\n930\n00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,180\nWhat its risk rating is.\n\n931\n00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,940\nNow this document itself\nis completely up to you.\n\n932\n00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,610\nHere they're using terms, words.\n\n933\n00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,650\nI use this.\n\n934\n00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:27,796\nI modeled it after what's in the PMBOK.\n\n935\n00:47:27,796 --> 00:47:30,332\nBut in real life land, I use numbers.\n\n936\n00:47:30,332 --> 00:47:35,006\nAnd I'll show you why a little bit later,\nbecause when we create our risk rating,\n\n937\n00:47:35,006 --> 00:47:39,370\nit's a lot easier if we have numbers,\nso we'll see that a little bit later.\n\n938\n00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:43,046\nAll right, so\nthis is a big part of what we're doing\n\n939\n00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:46,390\nright here in our\nqualitative risk analysis.\n\n940\n00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,360\nQualitative, we're\nlooking at each risk And\n\n941\n00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,350\nwe're assigning values to it so\nthat we can begin to categorize it.\n\n942\n00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:58,050\nNow, we are gonna move into\nquantitative risk analysis.\n\n943\n00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:01,930\nAnd quantitative is where we start to\ncompare the risks to each other, and\n\n944\n00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:05,430\nwe look at the overall level\nof risk of our project.\n\n945\n00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,260\nSo we're gonna end up having to do both.\n\n946\n00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,120\nQualitative, and quantitative, and\nit's easy to mix them up on the exam.\n\n947\n00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,010\nSo something we definitely wanna memorize.\n\n948\n00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,820\nI do have a lot more that I wanna\ntalk about here on qualitative risk.\n\n949\n00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,600\nSo I wanna run though some examples,\nand kinda see that.\n\n950\n00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,710\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n951\n00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,570\nBut for right now why don't we\nstop here and take a break?\n\n952\n00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,220\n>> Sounds good.\n\n953\n00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,483\n>> And when we got back we'll\npick back up with qualitative and\n\n954\n00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:27,120\nthen we'll jump into some quantitative.\n\n955\n00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:27,840\nIt'll be exciting.\n\n956\n00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,870\n>> Sounds great.\n\n957\n00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:29,830\n>> So stay tuned.\n\n958\n00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:30,759\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n959\n00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:39,140\n[NOISE]\n>> All right.\n\n960\n00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,280\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n961\n00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,493\nSo before the break, we were talking\nabout the probability and impact matrix.\n\n962\n00:48:44,493 --> 00:48:45,909\nWe were trying to plot that.\n\n963\n00:48:45,909 --> 00:48:48,588\nAnd I mocked it up using the PMI,\nthe PMBOK,\n\n964\n00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:53,390\nproject management body of knowledge\nmethod, kind of their example.\n\n965\n00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,405\nLet's pull this back up.\n\n966\n00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:57,960\nSo, basically just kind of\ncharting it with their very low,\n\n967\n00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,180\nlow medium, very high,\nand high, and so on.\n\n968\n00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,560\nThis is a good system.\n\n969\n00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,520\nIt works.\n\n970\n00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,840\nBut it's not the system\nthat I use in production.\n\n971\n00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,460\nAnd it's not the system that\nI'm forcing on you either.\n\n972\n00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,090\n>> No.\n\n973\n00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:11,680\n>> On the exam you may see names\nlike these or you may see numbers.\n\n974\n00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,090\nThe PMI leaves it up to you.\n\n975\n00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,523\nBasically they say,\ncome up with a way to grade your risks and\n\n976\n00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:16,728\njust be consistent about it.\n\n977\n00:49:16,728 --> 00:49:19,351\nSo I'm a little more normal.\n\n978\n00:49:19,351 --> 00:49:20,160\n>> [LAUGH] Normal.\n\n979\n00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,930\n>> Not that I'm more normal.\n\n980\n00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:26,140\nIt's that I normally tend to use numbers\nbecause they're easier to quantify.\n\n981\n00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,470\nSo I wanted to show you\nguys an example of that.\n\n982\n00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,230\nSo during the break, Ronnie and\nI banged out a quick Excel spread sheet,\n\n983\n00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,620\njust to show you guys an example\nof how I normally go about this.\n\n984\n00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,520\nAnd what I normally do\nis something like this.\n\n985\n00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,310\nI create a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet,\nand I use Excel,\n\n986\n00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,940\nyou could probably use anything.\n\n987\n00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,540\nBut basically, I come up with my risks.\n\n988\n00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:51,130\nAnd for each risk, we just put in what\nthe name of that risk is, and then we're\n\n989\n00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:55,800\ngonna pop in some information like\nthe impact and probability, all right.\n\n990\n00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:03,120\nSo for a risk, I might have something\nlike a chance of rain, right?\n\n991\n00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,240\nAnd there's a 80% chance of rain,\nbut only a 2 for impact.\n\n992\n00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,020\nThe impact is extremely low.\n\n993\n00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,410\nSee how I'm doing a percentage for\nprobability, but\n\n994\n00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,470\nI'm just doing a whole number for impact.\n\n995\n00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,220\nBut I'm ranking them really\nboth on a scale on zero to ten.\n\n996\n00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,360\nWhere zero is absolutely no impact or\n\n997\n00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,350\nabsolutely no chance that it\ncan happen probability wise.\n\n998\n00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:29,390\nAnd a ten is total catastrophic impact or\n\n999\n00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,800\na 100% chance probability\nthat this is going to occur.\n\n1000\n00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,038\nSo I'm really not gonna see zero or\nten, or\n\n1001\n00:50:36,038 --> 00:50:40,060\n0% or 100%, because in those\ncases it's not a risk anymore.\n\n1002\n00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,490\nNow it's a known entity.\n\n1003\n00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:45,020\nBut, I'm gonna to see numbers\none through nine a lot.\n\n1004\n00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,618\nOne being the lowest impact,\nnine being the highest impact.\n\n1005\n00:50:47,618 --> 00:50:50,440\n10%, I usually just do it in tens,\n\n1006\n00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,770\n10% is lowest probability,\n90% is highest probability.\n\n1007\n00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,750\nSo each of these might be\ncategorized different ways.\n\n1008\n00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,500\nI might put here Show Host Out Sick.\n\n1009\n00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,790\nThat's a possibility.\n\n1010\n00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,550\nI'm putting a 50/50 chance,\n50% chance that happens,\n\n1011\n00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:13,580\n50 or a 5 for probability, I mean, impact.\n\n1012\n00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,400\nThat's kind of we have to\nbring in another host.\n\n1013\n00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,440\nIt would affect half of the show.\n\n1014\n00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:23,210\nLet's see if we said something that is\nanother one that's like a low probability,\n\n1015\n00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,080\nlow impact.\n\n1016\n00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,178\nMight be something like.\n\n1017\n00:51:25,178 --> 00:51:29,790\n[LAUGH] Let's see.\n\n1018\n00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,920\nWhat would be a good one?\n\n1019\n00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,885\nWell, we could do like,\nlike well today, nah.\n\n1020\n00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:37,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's do something like Don runs\n\n1021\n00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,740\nout of gas.\n\n1022\n00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,120\nOr host has car trouble.\n\n1023\n00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,180\nThat's what happened yesterday.\n\n1024\n00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,340\nHost Has Car Trouble.\n\n1025\n00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,600\nSo, it's a low possibility\nthat it's gonna happen.\n\n1026\n00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,410\nThe probability is low,\nwe don't have car trouble every day.\n\n1027\n00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,820\nAnd then the impact might be\nlow because what do we do?\n\n1028\n00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,700\nThe host calls and says hey my car\nbroke down, can you come and get me?\n\n1029\n00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,200\nAnd somebody comes and\ngets them and brings them in.\n\n1030\n00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,200\nSo it's inconvenient, but\nit doesn't derail one of our shows, right?\n\n1031\n00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,620\nI might have something that is a high\nprobability, or a low probability,\n\n1032\n00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,250\nhigh impact right?\n\n1033\n00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,078\nLike a meteor strike is what I\nwas saying before the break.\n\n1034\n00:52:08,078 --> 00:52:11,830\nIt's a 10% probability, that's too high.\n\n1035\n00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:16,880\nBut a really low probability, but\nif it happened, a 9 for impact.\n\n1036\n00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,060\nIt would destroy our facility.\n\n1037\n00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:22,650\nWe definitely wouldn't have\na show that day, or ever again.\n\n1038\n00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:29,024\nThen we might have something that is a\nlittle more in line, I might put in here.\n\n1039\n00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,173\nActually, I might do, let's see,\nwhat would be a good one?\n\n1040\n00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:33,309\n>> Do the hurricane again.\n\n1041\n00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:34,285\n>> A hurricane?\n\n1042\n00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:35,387\n>> Yeah, in hurricane season.\n\n1043\n00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:38,254\n>> All right,\nwe'll say that we're in hurricane season.\n\n1044\n00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:41,186\nThere's an 80% chance that\na hurricane's gonna happen and\n\n1045\n00:52:41,186 --> 00:52:44,128\nI'll have a 7 on the impact scale\nas far as affecting our show.\n\n1046\n00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:47,405\nSo we just come up with whatever it\nis we think that there's going to be.\n\n1047\n00:52:47,405 --> 00:52:49,493\nMaybe there's a break-in, right?\n\n1048\n00:52:49,493 --> 00:52:52,670\nSo somebody breaks into the studio and\nsteals our equipment.\n\n1049\n00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,540\nProbability is low,\n\n1050\n00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,730\nwe've been in this building like five\nyears now, we've never had a break-in.\n\n1051\n00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,530\nNow I've jinxed myself.\n\n1052\n00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,290\nSo our probability might be extremely low,\nso I'll just Put in a 10% chance, and\n\n1053\n00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,480\nthen my impact,\nwell that might be significant.\n\n1054\n00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,500\nIf they steal our equipment, if we lose\nour cameras and all, it's insured, right?\n\n1055\n00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,480\nInsurance can get us stuff.\n\n1056\n00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,640\n>> We won't have it.\n\n1057\n00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,790\n>> But, it'll delay the show,\nright, we won't be able to record.\n\n1058\n00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,980\nSo I'm gonna put that impact\na little bit on the higher side,\n\n1059\n00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,650\nat like, actually we'll go 8.\n\n1060\n00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,180\nIt's not catastrophic,\nit's not like we're out of business, but\n\n1061\n00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,825\nit would impact the show, all right.\n\n1062\n00:53:24,825 --> 00:53:29,510\nNow from there,\nbecause I'm using Excel, I use a little\n\n1063\n00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:33,940\nchart to kind of throw all this\ntogether into a way that is meaningful.\n\n1064\n00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,290\nAnd so I've got this back here.\n\n1065\n00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:36,990\nAnd hang on,\n\n1066\n00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:41,270\nI just have to run a little macro real\nquick to name everything properly.\n\n1067\n00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,150\nSo I'm just gonna rerun this macro, there.\n\n1068\n00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,490\nExcel does this thing where it doesn't\nlike to label the data points, and so\n\n1069\n00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,030\nwe have to adjust it a little bit.\n\n1070\n00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:50,990\nBut what you can see in here,\n\n1071\n00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:54,780\nI guess it is a little bit\nhard to see cuz of the colors.\n\n1072\n00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:00,660\nBut Basically I plot these out where we've\ngot impact across the bottom on that\n\n1073\n00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:06,396\nscale of 0 to 10 and my probability\non the left side from 0% to 90%.\n\n1074\n00:54:06,396 --> 00:54:11,040\nAnd it's plotting each\nof those risks out here.\n\n1075\n00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,220\nAnd then what I've done, is I've\nput a color gradient in here saying\n\n1076\n00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,849\nthings down here are in the green,\nand green is okay.\n\n1077\n00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:18,950\nThat's not a big deal.\n\n1078\n00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:19,930\nIt's not gonna hurt us.\n\n1079\n00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,842\nProbably not something\nwe need to worry about.\n\n1080\n00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,034\nYellow, that's something I\nneed to start worrying about.\n\n1081\n00:54:25,034 --> 00:54:30,265\nAnd then red, that's something\nI absolutely need a plan for\n\n1082\n00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:32,222\nto get us to overcome.\n\n1083\n00:54:32,222 --> 00:54:35,940\nSo looking in here I can see\nhurricane up in the red.\n\n1084\n00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,160\nThat's something I need\nto have a plan for.\n\n1085\n00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,520\nWhat do we do if\na hurricane comes through?\n\n1086\n00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,310\nAll right?\n\n1087\n00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:47,049\nBut down here, host has car trouble, well,\nit's a low probability and a low impact.\n\n1088\n00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:48,291\nI really don't need to plan for that.\n\n1089\n00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:48,907\nI can.\n\n1090\n00:54:48,907 --> 00:54:50,998\nI can go ahead and put in, hey,\n\n1091\n00:54:50,998 --> 00:54:56,060\nhave a plan to go an pick somebody\nup if there's a problem, all right?\n\n1092\n00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:56,970\nSo I can state that.\n\n1093\n00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,660\nBut otherwise, it's just kinda up to us.\n\n1094\n00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:05,940\nNow, when you do this, that level\nwhere we go from green to yellow or\n\n1095\n00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,718\nyellow to red,\nit's up to us where we draw that line.\n\n1096\n00:55:09,718 --> 00:55:13,330\nEvery company is a little different,\nso you may need to manipulate that\n\n1097\n00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:17,740\nto match the needs of your organization,\nright.\n\n1098\n00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,880\nEverybody's a little bit different and,\nlet me see here.\n\n1099\n00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,530\nSo, like in Excel, you can go through and\nkind of tweak some of this stuff.\n\n1100\n00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,640\nSo, I might want to increase\nmy green a little bit to\n\n1101\n00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,680\nbump up where i really get worried about\nthings and bump up my yellow a little bit.\n\n1102\n00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,930\nSo that now, there's more things\nto kind of following in the green.\n\n1103\n00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:45,053\nIt just depends on our organization, what\nit is we think that's gonna affect us.\n\n1104\n00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:48,125\nAnd it maybe that we don't even have\na yellow, that we just go straight green.\n\n1105\n00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:49,286\nNow that's looking terrible.\n\n1106\n00:55:49,286 --> 00:55:52,258\n[LAUGH] Then we go straight like that.\n\n1107\n00:55:52,258 --> 00:55:55,381\nBecause in this scenario, we've got things\nthat we definitely don't deal with, and\n\n1108\n00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:56,510\nthen in which we kind of blend.\n\n1109\n00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:00,120\nIt's entirely up to you how\nyou want to go about it.\n\n1110\n00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,530\nYou might not do that at all, and just\nsay, you know what, plot it out for me.\n\n1111\n00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,840\nAnd then let me just figure it out.\n\n1112\n00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,330\nI've got break in and\nmeteor strike over here.\n\n1113\n00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,060\nBut see how they're so\nlow on the probability side,\n\n1114\n00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,770\nI probably just won't worry about them.\n\n1115\n00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,690\nBut when we start getting\ninto show host out sick or\n\n1116\n00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:17,060\nhurricane, maybe I do worry about that.\n\n1117\n00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:22,170\nAnd going back to the way that the PMI\nlisted here, even here we might choose\n\n1118\n00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:27,570\nto change this a little bit saying\ntake these two cells here and\n\n1119\n00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:34,110\nmaybe we'll take them and\nswitch them from being like yellow here,\n\n1120\n00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,860\nlike I've got 'em right now and\ngo ahead and make them green which,\n\n1121\n00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,911\nof course, is apparently not\none of the colors I can pick.\n\n1122\n00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,274\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's gonna\n\n1123\n00:56:40,274 --> 00:56:41,898\nbe a different green isn't it?\n\n1124\n00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,400\nThis is gonna look terrible.\n\n1125\n00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,870\nI guess I could have\ndone something like that.\n\n1126\n00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:46,420\nOh, it doesn't work.\n\n1127\n00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,060\nAll right.\nWell, whatever.\n\n1128\n00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,620\nDo you guys see what I mean though\nis that we could come in and\n\n1129\n00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:52,160\ntake this and change these a little bit.\n\n1130\n00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,510\nJust to meet whatever it is\nthat we're trying to achieve.\n\n1131\n00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:59,940\nSo, pick some all new green\nthat just looks horrible.\n\n1132\n00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,830\nThere we go.\n\n1133\n00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,330\nThat looks better.\n\n1134\n00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:08,970\nSo, you decide where it is that you\nneed to lay out what you plan for and\n\n1135\n00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:10,770\nwhat you don't is different for\nevery company.\n\n1136\n00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,310\nEverybody does things a little\nbit differently, all right?\n\n1137\n00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:17,090\nBut the key thing is probability and\nimpact are going to decide this.\n\n1138\n00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:21,430\nNow, we normally don't act on\nprobability and impact alone.\n\n1139\n00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,890\nWe normally combine the two,\nit makes sense to do it.\n\n1140\n00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:29,800\nAnd if you used compatible values like\nI have with this scale of one to ten,\n\n1141\n00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,410\nyou can do something really easy, you\ncan create what's called a risk rating.\n\n1142\n00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:38,540\nA risk rating has one of the simplest\nformulas in the entire pin box.\n\n1143\n00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,630\nA risk rating is simply\nprobability times impact.\n\n1144\n00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:45,280\nSo, you take your probability,\nyou multiply it by your impact, and\n\n1145\n00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,870\nwhatever number you get,\nthat's your risk rating.\n\n1146\n00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,970\nAnd you might of noticed in\nmy spreadsheet over here.\n\n1147\n00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,770\nI had Excel doing that for me.\n\n1148\n00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:55,970\nI had it taking whatever I plugged into\nthese two, and multiplying it out.\n\n1149\n00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,720\nSo when I look over here\nat this risk rating column.\n\n1150\n00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,160\nI can see that chance of rain\nhas a risk rating of 1.6.\n\n1151\n00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,030\nBut show host out sick\nhas a risk rating of 2.5.\n\n1152\n00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:10,930\nThis makes it very easy to compare\nthese numbers together, and\n\n1153\n00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:15,100\nI'm gonna need that when we get to\nthe quantitative risk analysis.\n\n1154\n00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,420\nWe're still doing qualitative right now.\n\n1155\n00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,450\nI'm just qualifying each risk, looking\nat them, figuring out their details.\n\n1156\n00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:23,560\nI'm not really doing comparisons just yet.\n\n1157\n00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,170\nThat's going to come with quantitative.\n\n1158\n00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:30,260\nSo those are some of the things\nthat are available to us there,\n\n1159\n00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,250\nas far as probability and impact.\n\n1160\n00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,530\nWe map it out in a risk register,\n\n1161\n00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,870\nas we list our risks and\nthen we map it out in a matrix.\n\n1162\n00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,190\nIf you want to figure that out.\n\n1163\n00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:44,770\nYou don't really need the matrix because\nyou can just the simple mathematic\n\n1164\n00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,200\nequations to do it, too.\n\n1165\n00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,740\nJust remember, probability times\nimpact equals your risk rating.\n\n1166\n00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:57,330\nAll right, then we have our\nrisk data quality assessment.\n\n1167\n00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:03,620\nYour data is only as good as\nthe data you used to formulate it.\n\n1168\n00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,180\nWhen I talk about these risks here.\n\n1169\n00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:08,550\nI said there's a chance of\nrain tomorrow and it's 80%.\n\n1170\n00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:09,680\nOkay?\n\n1171\n00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,260\nWhere did I get that from?\n\n1172\n00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:11,970\nWell I made it up.\n\n1173\n00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,550\nI just made it up off the top of my head.\n\n1174\n00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:18,350\nAlright, maybe I went a little more\nscientific and went to weather.com.\n\n1175\n00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:22,470\nSo you know I fired up weather.com and\nI got the data from there.\n\n1176\n00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:25,666\nSo I want to know what the weather\nis going to be like tomorrow so\n\n1177\n00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,480\nI punch in our zip code.\n\n1178\n00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,100\nAnd the weather for,\nwhere do you find tomorrow?\n\n1179\n00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:32,920\nHere, tomorrow.\n\n1180\n00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,690\nOkay.\n\n1181\n00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,390\nSo according to weather.com,\n\n1182\n00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:40,030\nthe weather tomorrow is going to be 90\ndegrees with evening thunderstorms.\n\n1183\n00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:41,107\nChance of rain 60%.\n\n1184\n00:59:41,107 --> 00:59:44,418\nSo weather.com is saying 60%,\nso I could stop right here,\n\n1185\n00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:45,925\nthat's where I got my data.\n\n1186\n00:59:47,145 --> 00:59:49,415\nWell, what's the quality of my data?\n\n1187\n00:59:49,415 --> 00:59:51,455\nHow accurate is weather.com?\n\n1188\n00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:54,810\nHave they done well over the last year?\n\n1189\n00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:57,410\nAre they wrong this amount of time or\nthat amount of time.\n\n1190\n00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,720\nWhat's the error rate of their data?\n\n1191\n01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:04,790\nMaybe I want to go and\nuse somebody else for my data.\n\n1192\n01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:07,190\nSo, maybe I want to use acuweather.\n\n1193\n01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,520\nSo, I'll go to acuweather.\n\n1194\n01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,560\nAnd I'll punch in their data,\nand they already found me.\n\n1195\n01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,570\nOminous, right?\n\n1196\n01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,910\nSo, they've found in Gainesville Florida.\n\n1197\n01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:22,520\nAnd tomorrow,\nit looks like they're saying a high of 89.\n\n1198\n01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,540\nSo a little bit different.\n\n1199\n01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,365\nAnd are they giving us\na generic chance of rain.\n\n1200\n01:00:27,365 --> 01:00:31,176\nThat's 64%.\n\n1201\n01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,808\n>> I'll try it on.\nWe'll see but I trust you.\n\n1202\n01:00:36,808 --> 01:00:38,210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So 64% is what they're saying.\n\n1203\n01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:43,590\nSo I had 60% on Weather.com,\n64% on AccuWeather.\n\n1204\n01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,190\nWhich one's right?\n\n1205\n01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:49,120\nMaybe I go ahead and take a third one and\nI bring in Weather Underground.\n\n1206\n01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,930\nI'm just trying to think of anybody.\n\n1207\n01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,610\nAnd so I bring up Weather Underground.\n\n1208\n01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:59,230\nI punch in old Gainesville here,\nwhich they already found us too.\n\n1209\n01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:04,000\nAnd I want tomorrow, ten day forecast.\n\n1210\n01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,060\n>> There you go.\n>> Well you know that's gonna be accurate.\n\n1211\n01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:10,969\nSo tomorrow is Friday, and\nwe got a chance of thunderstorms and\n\n1212\n01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,240\nboy, they lay it out here\nkinda crazy don't they?\n\n1213\n01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,830\n>> By hour by hour just about.\n\n1214\n01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:17,900\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n1215\n01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,370\nsometimes you get too much information.\n\n1216\n01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:20,890\n>> Yeah.\n>> It makes things difficult.\n\n1217\n01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:23,890\nSo, do we have just a generic\nstraight up percentage?\n\n1218\n01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:27,160\nI don't want an almanac,\nI'm not Benjamin Franklin.\n\n1219\n01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,625\n>> Right there would be the only thing.\n\n1220\n01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:30,290\n>> 56% humidity.\n\n1221\n01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,560\nIs that today?\n\n1222\n01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,935\n>> See, this information's\nalready too hard to interpret.\n\n1223\n01:01:35,935 --> 01:01:39,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well it was just a 62%, right?\n\n1224\n01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:42,010\nSo now I've got three values,\n60, 62, and 64%, which is right.\n\n1225\n01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:44,830\nMaybe I average them together, right?\n\n1226\n01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,540\nSo I just got three values,\njust average them and be done with it.\n\n1227\n01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,550\nSo, the accuracy of my data.\n\n1228\n01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:50,900\nWhere did I get that data from?\n\n1229\n01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,070\nHow accurate is it?\n\n1230\n01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,650\nDid somebody just guess?\n\n1231\n01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:56,575\nAm I going off of one subject\nmatter expert's estimate?\n\n1232\n01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:57,420\nRight?\n\n1233\n01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,930\nWhere did I get that from?\n\n1234\n01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:02,610\nSo we've got to make sure that\nour data is accurate as possible.\n\n1235\n01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:06,060\nAnd the risk data quality\nassessment does exactly that.\n\n1236\n01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,240\nWe just look and\nmake sure that we have some factual basis.\n\n1237\n01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,980\nAnd we document it.\n\n1238\n01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:14,060\nThe important reason we document it,\nis if we're wrong.\n\n1239\n01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,020\nWe need to see why.\n\n1240\n01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,760\nWhy were we wrong?\n\n1241\n01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,480\nWas it our fault?\n\n1242\n01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,050\nDid we just not do our due diligence?\n\n1243\n01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,040\nDid we not do good prep work?\n\n1244\n01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,048\nOr was it something out of our control?\n\n1245\n01:02:22,048 --> 01:02:26,600\nEverybody predicted 60% chance of rain,\nbut then on that day it ended up\n\n1246\n01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,880\nbeing 100%, or while it's\nraining it's always 100%, right?\n\n1247\n01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,200\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n1248\n01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,338\nWe also have risk categorization.\n\n1249\n01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:42,210\nNow risk categorization depends on you,\nhow you want to categorize things.\n\n1250\n01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:45,690\nYou can categorize them based\non mitigation techniques,\n\n1251\n01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,010\nways you would handle them.\n\n1252\n01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,290\nYou can categorize them based\non the areas that they affect.\n\n1253\n01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,098\nIf they affect your schedule,\nor your budget, or so on,\n\n1254\n01:02:53,098 --> 01:02:54,970\nthat's what I normally do.\n\n1255\n01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:58,490\nOr you can categorize them based\non whose responsible for them.\n\n1256\n01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:01,265\nIt's up to you,\nsome people categorize them just based on\n\n1257\n01:03:01,265 --> 01:03:04,545\nthe deliverable inside of the work\nbreakdown structure they affect.\n\n1258\n01:03:04,545 --> 01:03:06,435\nSo, figure out what works for you.\n\n1259\n01:03:06,435 --> 01:03:09,645\nThe main reason we wanna categorize\nthem is so that we can evaluate our\n\n1260\n01:03:09,645 --> 01:03:13,255\nrisk on a per category basis, and\nwe don't do that here in this process but\n\n1261\n01:03:13,255 --> 01:03:16,140\nwe do it in quantitative risk\nanalysis in the next process.\n\n1262\n01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,340\nYou also have a risk urgency assessment.\n\n1263\n01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,910\nThere are some risks that we\nneed to deal with immediately.\n\n1264\n01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,920\nIf we're planning an outdoor rock\nconcert three months from now,\n\n1265\n01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,730\nand there's a chance that it could rain,\nwe need to secure the tents now.\n\n1266\n01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:37,130\nBecause the tents might not be available\ntwo weeks before the show, right.\n\n1267\n01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:41,340\nSo some risks have a high urgency that\nwe need to immediately deal with.\n\n1268\n01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:48,614\nOther risks, there might not be any point\nto dealing with too far ahead of time.\n\n1269\n01:03:48,614 --> 01:03:50,551\nWhat can I really do now,\nthree months early,\n\n1270\n01:03:50,551 --> 01:03:52,599\nto make sure that a performer\ndoesn't get sick.\n\n1271\n01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:53,552\nDo you stick him in a bubble?\n\n1272\n01:03:53,552 --> 01:03:55,367\nThere's not really much you can do, so\n\n1273\n01:03:55,367 --> 01:03:57,575\nthere's not a lot of\nurgency around that risk.\n\n1274\n01:03:57,575 --> 01:04:02,680\nThe higher the probability and impact\nof a risk, the more urgent it becomes.\n\n1275\n01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,340\nThe lower the probability and impact,\nthe less urgent, because low probability,\n\n1276\n01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,240\nlow impact,\nis not really gonna affect our project.\n\n1277\n01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,760\nAll right, and then expert judgement.\n\n1278\n01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,180\nIf you happen to be fortunate\nenough to have a risk manager Or\n\n1279\n01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:20,260\nsome kind of risk consultant,\nthey will help you to no end.\n\n1280\n01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,690\nThey are worth their weight and gold.\n\n1281\n01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,070\nWell most of them are.\n\n1282\n01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:28,150\n[Laughs] like any profession there\nare some that aren’t but most of them are.\n\n1283\n01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,610\nSo they can really help you out.\n\n1284\n01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,770\nIf you don't have that and\nyou're on your own, well\n\n1285\n01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:36,350\nyou need to get all the information you\ncan so bring in subject matter experts for\n\n1286\n01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:41,190\nthe individual areas of your project and\nget their best opinion over the risks.\n\n1287\n01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,480\nAll right,\nnow the only thing we generate here,\n\n1288\n01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,140\nwith qualitative risk analysis,\nis Project Document Updates.\n\n1289\n01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:52,390\nThe reason is, we've probably already\ncreated a lot of these documents.\n\n1290\n01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:57,280\nNow they don't that that risk matrix is\nan output even though it technically is.\n\n1291\n01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,030\nHere's where we create it.\n\n1292\n01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:00,062\nSo you don't see that.\n\n1293\n01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:03,943\nBut what we're really doing is we're\nupdating our risk register, so\n\n1294\n01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:05,653\nthis risk register over here,\n\n1295\n01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:09,468\nand you might remember fro the templates\nI brought up at the beginning\n\n1296\n01:05:09,468 --> 01:05:13,382\nof this show that the risk register\nitself doesn't have a ton of data.\n\n1297\n01:05:13,382 --> 01:05:17,180\nBut it does have probability and impact.\n\n1298\n01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:20,810\nSo, as we get that information,\nwe plug it right in here and\n\n1299\n01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:22,510\nsee where it's got score?\n\n1300\n01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,290\nThat's the risk rating.\n\n1301\n01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:28,380\nProbability times impact\nequals the risk rating, so\n\n1302\n01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,109\nthey just call it score in\nthis particular template.\n\n1303\n01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:36,680\nThere's also, instead of the risk\nregister, there is the risk data sheet.\n\n1304\n01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,780\nAnd here's where we do the same thing,\nprobability, impact, score, but\n\n1305\n01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:45,130\nwe go a step further to include\nthings like risk cause,\n\n1306\n01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,790\nrisk responses, contingency plans.\n\n1307\n01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,950\nOther data surrounding that.\n\n1308\n01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:52,820\nAnd risk response plans\nin two more processes.\n\n1309\n01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,160\nSo, we'll get to that\ntowards the end of the show.\n\n1310\n01:05:55,822 --> 01:05:58,070\nAll right, so definitely things\nthat we want to be aware of, and\n\n1311\n01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:01,420\nthis is a great place to put information\nin on where we can get our data from.\n\n1312\n01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,370\nSo, we've got that documented.\n\n1313\n01:06:04,192 --> 01:06:08,900\nAll right, so those are pretty much the\nthings we need to thing about as far as\n\n1314\n01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,280\nQualitative Risk Analysis.\n\n1315\n01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,680\nJust remember, the main goal of\nQualitative Risk Analysis is to assign\n\n1316\n01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,260\nvalues to your risk to make it\npossible to compare them, right?\n\n1317\n01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:24,115\nWe need to qualify each risk to\nunderstand the significance or\n\n1318\n01:06:24,115 --> 01:06:26,025\nlack of significance of that risk.\n\n1319\n01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:29,135\nOnce we're done with that,\n\n1320\n01:06:29,135 --> 01:06:34,030\nwe usually immediately move into\nQuantitative Risk Analysis.\n\n1321\n01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,950\nVery similar words, very easy to confuse.\n\n1322\n01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:40,510\nQualitative, we're looking\nat individual risks.\n\n1323\n01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:43,790\nQuantitative, we look at the big picture,\nall right?\n\n1324\n01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,720\nSo, let's see that.\n\n1325\n01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,030\nLet me bring up that process group here.\n\n1326\n01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:47,840\nAll right.\n\n1327\n01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:52,350\nIn Quantitative Risk Analysis,\nwe take our inputs, and our inputs,\n\n1328\n01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:54,400\nthe main one is the risk register.\n\n1329\n01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,160\nBecause, really, all the other stuff: risk\nmanagement plan, cost management plan,\n\n1330\n01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,420\nschedule management plan.\n\n1331\n01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:05,390\nA lot of that stuff went into our\nQualitative Risk Analysis already.\n\n1332\n01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:07,580\nSo we don't normally need to\nharvest that information together.\n\n1333\n01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,130\nWe've already acted upon it.\n\n1334\n01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,040\nWhat we're really looking for\n\n1335\n01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:13,850\nis that risk register that's now nice and\npopulated with probability impact.\n\n1336\n01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,300\nRight, and a risk rating.\n\n1337\n01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:20,010\nAnd that's when we can start to go in and\ncompare our data, and\n\n1338\n01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:23,570\nmake some important decisions,\nright, some very important decisions.\n\n1339\n01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:27,530\nSo the first thing we need is data\ngathering and representation techniques.\n\n1340\n01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:32,430\nAnd what they're talking about there\nis of the data that we've gathered, we\n\n1341\n01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:36,520\nneed to be able to show it in a way that's\nmeaningful to the people we talk to,\n\n1342\n01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:41,050\nthat's meaningful to our CEO, to our\nsponsors to our stakeholders, right.\n\n1343\n01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:44,070\nSo we gather our data through\nany of a number of techniques.\n\n1344\n01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,760\nAnd the book specifically\ncalls out interviewing, right.\n\n1345\n01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,970\nSo we interview people, gather that data.\n\n1346\n01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:51,940\nAnd then we do probability distribution.\n\n1347\n01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,810\nThere are some events that\n\n1348\n01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:59,850\nmay have different probabilities\nbased on certain criteria.\n\n1349\n01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:03,350\nA great example is here in Florida,\npeople calling in sick.\n\n1350\n01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:07,590\nThere is a great instance of people\ncalling in sick in this springtime\n\n1351\n01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,100\nthen any other time of year.\n\n1352\n01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:14,220\nAnd the reason is in Florida we have\na pollen count that is ridiculous.\n\n1353\n01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:17,410\nThere is so much pollen in the air\nin spring it effects the gas\n\n1354\n01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:18,640\nmileage in your car.\n\n1355\n01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:23,490\n>> That it's just crazy so\nin the spring people's allergies flare up.\n\n1356\n01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,910\nPeople get sick, and they call in.\n\n1357\n01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:29,970\nIt happens every year, and\nit kind of coincides with flu season or\n\n1358\n01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:33,050\nthe end of flu season, so it's a big deal.\n\n1359\n01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:37,350\nSo if I'm trying to calculate employees\ncalling in sick, I need to account for\n\n1360\n01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:43,200\na higher probability, a higher incidence\nof that in January, February, March.\n\n1361\n01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,460\nBut then for the rest of summer,\nit drops down to normal levels.\n\n1362\n01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,810\nSo depending on the day I\nlook It's gonna be different.\n\n1363\n01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:53,260\nAnd so\nwe may have a probability distribution.\n\n1364\n01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:56,770\nThings are changing based\non the time frame or\n\n1365\n01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,900\nwhatever it is that I'm measuring against.\n\n1366\n01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,360\nSo be aware of that.\n\n1367\n01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:03,440\nYou'll see it especially in execution,\nwhen we're executing our project,\n\n1368\n01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,490\nwhere the real work is getting done.\n\n1369\n01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:09,200\nDifferent phases of the project might be\nmore dangerous or hazardous than others,\n\n1370\n01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,649\nand so we might have higher workers'\ncomp claims, things of that nature.\n\n1371\n01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:19,420\nAll right, so then we're ready to do\nour actual quantitative risk analysis.\n\n1372\n01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,510\nAnd this can be very simple,\nit can also be very complex.\n\n1373\n01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,260\nIt can be really hard.\n\n1374\n01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,690\nIt's up to you how exact\nyou want to get on this.\n\n1375\n01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:28,470\nAll right.\n\n1376\n01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:31,270\nWe already have our probability and\n\n1377\n01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:36,240\nimpact and from those we've extrapolated\na risk rating for our risks.\n\n1378\n01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,840\nNow, we need to make\nsome kind of a decision.\n\n1379\n01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,640\nA decision is going to\ncenter around two things.\n\n1380\n01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:48,510\nOne, what risks should we manage,\nand how do we manage them?\n\n1381\n01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:52,830\nAnd two, what level of risk does\nthe project as a whole have?\n\n1382\n01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:56,590\nAnd whether or not I should even\nmove forward with the project.\n\n1383\n01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:58,590\nAll right,\nthe first one we already talked about.\n\n1384\n01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:00,760\nWe've got a probability and\nimpact for each of our risks,\n\n1385\n01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,480\nwe calculated a risk rating,\nnow we just need to set a bar and\n\n1386\n01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,980\nsay, anything over this number,\nwe need to plan for.\n\n1387\n01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:14,440\nSo maybe I set that bar at one, anything\nwith a score over 1.0 I want to deal with.\n\n1388\n01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:21,060\nSo I go back to my spreadsheet and\nI look at my risk ratings over here and\n\n1389\n01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:27,380\nI can see like chance of rain has a 1.6,\nhost out sick has a 2.5,\n\n1390\n01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:31,785\nhost has car trouble is only .6,\nmeteor strike is a .9.\n\n1391\n01:10:31,785 --> 01:10:36,540\nHurricane 5.6, break in 0.8, so\nI say anything over a 1.0 is\n\n1392\n01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:41,720\nsomething I wanna deal with, so I'll\nneed to build a plan for chance of rain.\n\n1393\n01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,230\nI'll need to build a plan for\nshow host out sick.\n\n1394\n01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,100\nI'll need to build a plan for hurricane.\n\n1395\n01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,970\nBut these other things I'm just gonna\ndo what's called risk acceptance.\n\n1396\n01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:52,830\nI'm just gonna accept that they can happen\nand I'll deal with them when they happen.\n\n1397\n01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:55,190\nBut they're just so either improbable or\n\n1398\n01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:58,460\nlow impact that I'm not\nworried about it right?\n\n1399\n01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,140\nBut I need to set that bar.\n\n1400\n01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,710\nWhere do you set the bar?\n\n1401\n01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,090\nWell there's no formula for that.\n\n1402\n01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,070\nThere's no mathematics.\n\n1403\n01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:07,620\nWell a risk manager has certain\nstatistical analyses they can do.\n\n1404\n01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:12,190\nBut normally it comes down to your\ncompany's willingness to accept risk.\n\n1405\n01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:13,470\nAre you risk averse?\n\n1406\n01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,550\nThen you're gonna set this bar very low.\n\n1407\n01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,140\nAre you a risk seeker?\n\n1408\n01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,270\nThen you're gonna set this bar very high.\n\n1409\n01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,740\nWhy waste time planning for\nrisks that aren't likely to happen anyway,\n\n1410\n01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:22,910\nso I'm just setting the bar high.\n\n1411\n01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:28,390\nOr, are you risk neutral, you'll evaluate\nthe likelihood based on each of these and\n\n1412\n01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,960\nyou'll start to set the bar\nbased on the numbers you get.\n\n1413\n01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,970\nAlso, what about the risk as a whole,\nI only listed six risks.\n\n1414\n01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:37,870\nBut you'll see my spreadsheet,\nand I go down to 100.\n\n1415\n01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:40,566\nWhen we do a risk analysis on a project,\n\n1416\n01:11:40,566 --> 01:11:45,904\nit's very common that you can have 50,\n100, 200 different risks.\n\n1417\n01:11:45,904 --> 01:11:48,729\nEvery single work package\nhas some kind of risks.\n\n1418\n01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:49,596\nRight.\n\n1419\n01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:53,170\nSo you may have a lot of\nrisks across your project.\n\n1420\n01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:57,210\nWhat happens if you total up\nall the risk that you have?\n\n1421\n01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:01,670\nSo if we add up these numbers,\nand divide it by the total, so,\n\n1422\n01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:04,300\nI'm gonna have you do an average.\n\n1423\n01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,470\nIs it average?\n\n1424\n01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:05,970\nOh it is.\n\n1425\n01:12:07,525 --> 01:12:08,381\nSo, if I use good old Excel here, and\n\n1426\n01:12:08,381 --> 01:12:09,524\nI'm just gonna do an average\nof my risk ratings.\n\n1427\n01:12:12,947 --> 01:12:16,755\nOkay, I can see my overall\naverage is a 2.0, right.\n\n1428\n01:12:18,205 --> 01:12:23,172\nI need to set a bar that says,\nwhen is a project too risky?\n\n1429\n01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,522\nWhen is there just too\nmuch risk in my project?\n\n1430\n01:12:26,522 --> 01:12:29,412\nAnd, there's so much risk that I say, you\nknow what, I don't wanna do it anymore.\n\n1431\n01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:30,582\nLet's just cancel that.\n\n1432\n01:12:30,582 --> 01:12:32,320\nLet's not do that project at all.\n\n1433\n01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:38,060\nOkay, if there's enough high probability,\nhigh impact risks.\n\n1434\n01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:41,670\nIf there's enough things that\ncould derail your whole project,\n\n1435\n01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:45,610\nyou need to set a limit that says,\noh I've hit that limit, I am not doing it,\n\n1436\n01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,080\nthis project needs to stop.\n\n1437\n01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:50,890\nThere's just too much risk in\nthe project as a whole, okay.\n\n1438\n01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:52,430\nWhere do you set this bar?\n\n1439\n01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:53,770\nAgain, it depends.\n\n1440\n01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,860\nAre you risk adverse, are you risk seeker,\nare you risk neutral.\n\n1441\n01:12:56,860 --> 01:13:00,040\nThis is the kind of thing that you\nset up in your risk management plan.\n\n1442\n01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:05,950\nIn your risk management plan,\nyou might say, anything with a average\n\n1443\n01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:10,140\nrisk rating of 3.0 or\nhigher, we will not do.\n\n1444\n01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:12,818\nUnless you can mitigate it,\ncuz some of the stuff you can mitigate.\n\n1445\n01:13:12,818 --> 01:13:15,630\nSome of it you might look at and\nyou could say, you know what?\n\n1446\n01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,490\nAll right.\n\n1447\n01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:20,380\nThere's a chance that a show\nhost could call out sick.\n\n1448\n01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:24,610\nSo for now on what I'm gonna do is\nevery time we schedule a show I'm\n\n1449\n01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:26,290\ngonna schedule three hosts.\n\n1450\n01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:27,650\nI'll schedule three hosts.\n\n1451\n01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:30,590\nThat way if one calls in sick I\nstill have two, the show goes on.\n\n1452\n01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,140\nBy mitigating that risk\nmy cost is gonna go up.\n\n1453\n01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,270\nI gotta pay a third person to stand here.\n\n1454\n01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:40,430\nA third person I might not even use.\n\n1455\n01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:43,850\nBut my show host out sick,\nthe probability didn't change.\n\n1456\n01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:46,080\nIt's still the same\nlikelihood of happening but\n\n1457\n01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,610\nnow the impact drops to negligible.\n\n1458\n01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:52,300\nI don't really care if\nthey're out sick cause\n\n1459\n01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,490\nI've already got the extra\nextra person handy.\n\n1460\n01:13:54,490 --> 01:14:00,450\nSo if we see our number is too high,\nwe make a go, no go, decision.\n\n1461\n01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:05,380\nEither we go, we run with the project\nas it is, or we do a no go,\n\n1462\n01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,980\nand say as it is this\nproject dead in the water.\n\n1463\n01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,200\nUnless we can get the risk down.\n\n1464\n01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:15,100\nAnd we start evaluating our risk\nresponses, which is the next process, and\n\n1465\n01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,500\nwhat we can do to lower it.\n\n1466\n01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:20,710\nOnce we lower it, we come back and\nwe revise our risk.\n\n1467\n01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:22,555\nNotice back here in my templates.\n\n1468\n01:14:24,389 --> 01:14:29,923\nThat in the Risk Data Sheet,\nsee how I've got a probability right here,\n\n1469\n01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:32,475\nand then a revised probability.\n\n1470\n01:14:32,475 --> 01:14:33,385\nWhat's that all about?\n\n1471\n01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:37,912\nWell yeah there was a certain\nrisk when I first came in and\n\n1472\n01:14:37,912 --> 01:14:39,542\nflagged this as something to deal with.\n\n1473\n01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:42,672\nSo here it is, this is the risk\nas it was in the beginning, but\n\n1474\n01:14:42,672 --> 01:14:44,222\nour risk was too high.\n\n1475\n01:14:44,222 --> 01:14:47,012\nSo, we took some kind\nof action to reduce it.\n\n1476\n01:14:47,012 --> 01:14:52,472\nSo now, here's my revision,\nnow here's what's the probability, and so\n\n1477\n01:14:52,472 --> 01:14:59,030\nI go and I update my register,\nto show those lower values.\n\n1478\n01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:03,460\nNow my overall project risk drops down,\nand the project moves forward.\n\n1479\n01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:07,300\nThis is the corner stone\nof quantitative analysis.\n\n1480\n01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:12,700\nI don't know this information unless\nI'm comparing all of my risks together.\n\n1481\n01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:16,390\nI might look at it and\nhave a bunch of mid level risks.\n\n1482\n01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:19,010\nNo one risk by itself\nis that big of a deal.\n\n1483\n01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:22,026\nBut what if two risks happen at\nthe same time, or three, or five, and\n\n1484\n01:15:22,026 --> 01:15:24,330\nthey're all negative risks right,\nnot positive.\n\n1485\n01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:27,040\nYou want five positive risks\nto all happen at once.\n\n1486\n01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,590\nNow what if all those negative\nrisks happen at the same time.\n\n1487\n01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:33,180\nThen it can become a high impact event,\n\n1488\n01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:37,330\neven though none of the risks\nby themselves were there.\n\n1489\n01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:40,760\nBy averaging these numbers,\nwe're taking that into account.\n\n1490\n01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,890\nRight by averaging this together\nwe're averaging these probabilities,\n\n1491\n01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:45,420\nwe're averaging these impacts.\n\n1492\n01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:49,120\nAnd creating something\na little more useful.\n\n1493\n01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,520\nAnd you could even go further,\nyou know I do the average of\n\n1494\n01:15:55,505 --> 01:15:59,275\nthe risk rating as a whole, but you could\ncome up with an average probability,\n\n1495\n01:15:59,275 --> 01:16:02,035\nand an average impact, and\nkind of look at those and\n\n1496\n01:16:02,035 --> 01:16:05,285\nsee just whether you're dealing with\na lot of high level risk or not.\n\n1497\n01:16:05,285 --> 01:16:06,755\nI find that those numbers are less useful.\n\n1498\n01:16:06,755 --> 01:16:08,570\nThe average of the risk\nrating is the most useful.\n\n1499\n01:16:09,754 --> 01:16:17,240\nAll right, so\nquantitative risk analysis and modeling.\n\n1500\n01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,620\nThat's where we start to look at that.\n\n1501\n01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:19,970\nWhat is our overall risk?\n\n1502\n01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:23,020\nHow risky is the project as a whole?\n\n1503\n01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,470\nWhat's our percentage of failure?\n\n1504\n01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:27,570\nRight, If we're creating a large\nchance of failure on this project,\n\n1505\n01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:28,520\nwe probably need to rein it in.\n\n1506\n01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,110\nUnder analysis and\n\n1507\n01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:36,798\nmodeling techniques we do have a few\nother things, sensitivity analysis.\n\n1508\n01:16:36,798 --> 01:16:42,620\nThat is how sensitive,\nhow, I don't want to say,\n\n1509\n01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:45,250\nI want to say paranoid,\nthat's not the right word for it.\n\n1510\n01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:48,960\nBut, you know, how risky is our project?\n\n1511\n01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,380\nIf we have a lot of high risk stuff,\nthen it's a very sensitive project.\n\n1512\n01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,870\nAny of those risks could come through and\nundermine the project so\n\n1513\n01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:58,710\nobviously we want, we want projects\nthat aren't terribly sensitive, that\n\n1514\n01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:01,730\nare resilient, that if they have failures\nit doesn't derail the whole project.\n\n1515\n01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,290\nExpected monetary value analysis.\n\n1516\n01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:11,340\nThis one's is a tough one, we're going\nto get into earned value, EVA, and\n\n1517\n01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:15,310\nall of that good stuff,\nin the monitoring and\n\n1518\n01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:18,500\ncontrolling phases, so\nwe're gonna see that a little bit later.\n\n1519\n01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,800\nBut basically,\n\n1520\n01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:24,640\nwhen you perform a project, the whole\npoint is to improve your company somehow.\n\n1521\n01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,880\n>> Yep [LAUGH].\n>> And typically to make more money.\n\n1522\n01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:32,480\nAnd so EMV, the expected monetary value,\nthat's were we can look at our project and\n\n1523\n01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,650\ncome up with what we expect\nour financial gain to be.\n\n1524\n01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:41,800\nAnd if we have enough risk\nwe may have to take so many\n\n1525\n01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:47,080\nmitigating techniques, or steps that\nwe offset that expected monetary value,\n\n1526\n01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:51,160\nand that really starts to hurt things.\n\n1527\n01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:54,400\nSo that's a real thing that\na lot of companies deal with.\n\n1528\n01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,150\nHave you ever seen,\nyou go to a sporting event.\n\n1529\n01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:02,920\nBaseball, football, hockey, whatever,\nand at halftime they bring just your\n\n1530\n01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:07,080\naverage Joe off the street out into\nthe middle of the field, and they say,\n\n1531\n01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,380\nlet's use hockey,\ncuz that's a little more international.\n\n1532\n01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:12,830\nSo they stick a guy right in\nthe center of the rink, and they say,\n\n1533\n01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:17,245\nif he can shoot the puck\nhalfway across the the rink and\n\n1534\n01:18:17,245 --> 01:18:22,545\nget it into this little hole in the goal,\nhe'll get a million dollars.\n\n1535\n01:18:22,545 --> 01:18:25,235\nOne million dollars, okay?\n\n1536\n01:18:25,235 --> 01:18:28,575\nWell, if the guy makes it, yeah,\nhe gets a million dollars.\n\n1537\n01:18:28,575 --> 01:18:33,030\nWhoever put on that contest is out\na million dollars, but if he misses it he\n\n1538\n01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:36,350\ndoesn't get anything and the company that\nput this on just gets great publicity.\n\n1539\n01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:37,140\nRight?\n\n1540\n01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:41,140\nSo do you think they've got a stack of\na million bucks sitting in the backroom\n\n1541\n01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,188\nwaiting for that guy to make it?\n\n1542\n01:18:42,188 --> 01:18:46,750\nAbsolutely not,\ninstead they buy insurance.\n\n1543\n01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:50,140\nThey buy insurance that\nsays if this guy makes it,\n\n1544\n01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:53,510\nthe insurance company will pay\nthat million dollars and not us.\n\n1545\n01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:56,400\nBut if they guy misses it, well we just\npay our insurance premium and that's it.\n\n1546\n01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:02,035\nAnd so they reach out to, usually it's\nlike, what is it, Sotheby's I think.\n\n1547\n01:19:02,035 --> 01:19:02,765\nWell, no that's not right.\n\n1548\n01:19:02,765 --> 01:19:04,865\nWhat's the big-\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n1549\n01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:05,655\nLloyd's of London.\n\n1550\n01:19:05,655 --> 01:19:08,055\n>> Lloyd's of London that's it,\nthank you Jason.\n\n1551\n01:19:08,055 --> 01:19:11,310\nSo Lloyd's of London, these guys,\nthey'll insure anything.\n\n1552\n01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:12,390\nAnything you can think of.\n\n1553\n01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:14,010\nAnd so they run the statistics.\n\n1554\n01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:17,820\nWhat are the odds of your average joe\noff the street shooting a puck halfway\n\n1555\n01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,160\nacross an ice rink and\ngetting it into a hole this big?\n\n1556\n01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:20,730\nRight?\n\n1557\n01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:26,000\nAnd so they calculate the odds, and\nthen based on those odds, they calculate\n\n1558\n01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,670\na dollar value that they can get paid\nwhere they will accept that risk for us.\n\n1559\n01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:32,960\nIt's called risk transference.\n\n1560\n01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,340\nWe're transferring the risk\nover to the insurance company.\n\n1561\n01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,370\nWe're gonna come out some money.\n\n1562\n01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,945\nLet's say it's $100,000, right?\n\n1563\n01:19:38,945 --> 01:19:42,896\nLet's say that Lloyds looks at it,\nand they say, wow,\n\n1564\n01:19:42,896 --> 01:19:46,273\nthere is like a 2% chance\nthis guy can make it.\n\n1565\n01:19:46,273 --> 01:19:47,946\nBut we're gonna charge you 10%.\n\n1566\n01:19:47,946 --> 01:19:48,711\nAll right?\n\n1567\n01:19:48,711 --> 01:19:52,148\nSo you wanna give away $1 million,\nwe're gonna charge you $100,000.\n\n1568\n01:19:52,148 --> 01:19:54,150\nThat's what we'll do, all right?\n\n1569\n01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:58,100\nSo if you are Coke or Pepsi, or\nwhoever is putting this thing on,\n\n1570\n01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,460\nyou pay the 100 grand.\n\n1571\n01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:03,780\nYou pay the 100 grand so you don't\nhave to pay 1 million if it happens.\n\n1572\n01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,920\nAnd so you pay 100,000,\nyou're out that money.\n\n1573\n01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,430\nIf the guy misses,\nLloyd's just made $100,000.\n\n1574\n01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:14,600\nAnd they've got a 98%\nchance of that happening.\n\n1575\n01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:20,720\nBut if that guy makes it, then Lloyd's\nis out, 900 and whatever $1,000.\n\n1576\n01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:26,350\nSo they're out a ton of money but there\nwas only a 2% chance it was gonna happen.\n\n1577\n01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:26,920\nRight.\n\n1578\n01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,860\nThat's part of what expected\nmonetary value analysis.\n\n1579\n01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,700\nDoes, is it let's us look at that and\ncome up with a concept.\n\n1580\n01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,650\nSo what do we stand to gain,\n\n1581\n01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:39,090\nhow much do we stand to lose,\nwhat the average outcome will be?\n\n1582\n01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,960\nWe're trying to figure that out.\n\n1583\n01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:46,160\nIt all falls under this umbrella\nterm of analysis under uncertainty.\n\n1584\n01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,220\nWe don't know what's gonna happen.\n\n1585\n01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:53,240\nWe don't know if Bob from Akron,\nOhio, whose been a mailman for\n\n1586\n01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:57,020\n30 years, we don't know if he can shoot\nthat puck across the ice rink and\n\n1587\n01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,230\nmake it, but we gotta take a guess.\n\n1588\n01:20:59,230 --> 01:20:59,790\n>> Right.\n\n1589\n01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:02,950\n>> And the better the information we have,\nthe better off we will be.\n\n1590\n01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:10,100\nAll right, so those are some of the things\nthat we've gotta keep in mind as we\n\n1591\n01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,020\ndeal with Quantitative Risk Analysis.\n\n1592\n01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:18,080\nWe've got our Expert Judgement and then,\nat the end of the day, we output our data.\n\n1593\n01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,630\nSo, we've got our risk register and\n\n1594\n01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:26,320\nyou may choose to create a risk evaluation\nsheet or something of that nature.\n\n1595\n01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:31,180\nBut typically, it's just updates to your\nrisk register to put that information in.\n\n1596\n01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,500\nAny responses we'll talk about later.\n\n1597\n01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,730\nBut you're gonna put in\nthere any probabilities,\n\n1598\n01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:40,270\nimpacts and any mitigation techniques\nthat we've got, and that's basically it.\n\n1599\n01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,050\nSo I make it sound easy.\n\n1600\n01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:42,640\nWell, maybe I don't.\n\n1601\n01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,720\nI don't know, in my mind it sounds easy.\n\n1602\n01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,010\nIt is easy when you're talking\nabout one risk, but the problem is,\n\n1603\n01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:47,690\nyou're gonna have a meeting.\n\n1604\n01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:48,490\nYou're gonna sit down, and\n\n1605\n01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:51,730\nyou're gonna come up with\npotentially hundreds of risks.\n\n1606\n01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:54,540\nAnd so you've gotta go through and\nlook at each one.\n\n1607\n01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:58,290\nSo while it takes us an hour\nto tell you about the process,\n\n1608\n01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:01,000\nit may take you weeks or even months.\n\n1609\n01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,800\nIf you're putting a man on the moon,\nit could take years.\n\n1610\n01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,580\nTo look at all the risks and\nfigure them out.\n\n1611\n01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:08,140\nSo, definitely keep that in mind.\n\n1612\n01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:14,420\nAll right, well we've talked a lot about\nevaluating our risks, looking at them.\n\n1613\n01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:16,720\nNow, we need to talk about\nwhat we do to handle it.\n\n1614\n01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,380\nHow to get out of a mess if it occurs,\nall right?\n\n1615\n01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,220\nSo let's stop here and\n\n1616\n01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:24,110\ntake a break because I did go\nover our little break timer.\n\n1617\n01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:25,130\nLet's stop here and take a break.\n\n1618\n01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:28,640\nAnd when we get back, we're going to\ntake a look at our risk response plan.\n\n1619\n01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:32,480\nWhich is probably the most critical\nin the different steps here,\n\n1620\n01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,960\ninside of the risk knowledge area.\n\n1621\n01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,875\nSo, let's wrap up here and take a break.\n\n1622\n01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:38,191\nWhen we get back, risk response plans.\n\n1623\n01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:46,310\n[SOUND]\nAll right.\n\n1624\n01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:47,670\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n1625\n01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:52,300\nSo, by this point, we have created\na list of all of our project risks.\n\n1626\n01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,830\nWe understand the dangers\nthat are out there.\n\n1627\n01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:58,440\nWe have qualified and\nquantified those risks, so\n\n1628\n01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:03,790\nwe've evaluated how significant they are,\nwhether we need to deal with them.\n\n1629\n01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:07,020\nSo now, we're at the point where\nwe do the last part which is,\n\n1630\n01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,190\nwe figure out how we're\ngonna deal with them, right?\n\n1631\n01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:11,320\nWe've got a risk response.\n\n1632\n01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,680\nHow we're gonna respond to the risks\nin the event that they occur?\n\n1633\n01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:18,778\nNow, there are responses that we\ntake if the risk doesn't occur.\n\n1634\n01:23:18,778 --> 01:23:21,300\nAnd there's this proactive\nresponses we take early on, so\n\n1635\n01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:24,350\nthere's all sorts of different\nstuff that can happen right here.\n\n1636\n01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:27,600\nThis process is deceptively simple.\n\n1637\n01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,780\nWe've just seen some processes\nthat were pretty heavy, right?\n\n1638\n01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,990\nThat had like this guy right here,\n13 inputs and all that.\n\n1639\n01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:38,620\nSo this one looks simple but\nit's probably the hardest to\n\n1640\n01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:42,150\ndo in real life because there's so\nmany different ways to solve a problem and\n\n1641\n01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:46,240\nwe've got to figure out which\none is the best for us.\n\n1642\n01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:50,890\nOn our input side, our main input\nis going to be our risk register.\n\n1643\n01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:52,390\nAnd then we have our Risk Management Plan,\n\n1644\n01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:56,440\nwhich is telling us how these things\nare available to us, how we can respond.\n\n1645\n01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,390\nWhat tools are there as an option for us.\n\n1646\n01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:01,380\nBut our risk register is the main input.\n\n1647\n01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,880\nBecause it lists all the risks.\n\n1648\n01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,330\nAnd which ones are significant enough for\nus to worry about, all right?\n\n1649\n01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:10,490\nNow, we need to find out what to do.\n\n1650\n01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:13,870\nSo on our techniques here, our Tools &\nTechniques, we've got strategies for\n\n1651\n01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:16,980\nnegative risks, and\nstrategies for positive risks.\n\n1652\n01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,580\nThere's a difference, right?\n\n1653\n01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,650\nObviously a negative risk,\nwe don’t want to make it happen,\n\n1654\n01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:24,050\nso anything we do is trying\nto minimize that occurrence.\n\n1655\n01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:27,140\nBut a positive risk,\nwe do want to happen so\n\n1656\n01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:30,580\nany response that we take there is trying\nto make it better and better, right?\n\n1657\n01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,180\nWhat is the most likely\nway we can do that.\n\n1658\n01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:36,010\nSo let's talk a little bit about those and\n\n1659\n01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:38,820\nRonnie threw out some good\nnotes here on this one.\n\n1660\n01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:43,060\nOn a negative risk, there's really\nfour different responses, right?\n\n1661\n01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:48,390\nAvoid, transfer, mitigate, accept,\nlet's talk about each one.\n\n1662\n01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:53,400\nAvoid, you can take a look at a risk and\nsay this risk exists,\n\n1663\n01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:57,040\nwhat can I do to 100%\ncompletely eliminate it?\n\n1664\n01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:57,540\nAlright.\n\n1665\n01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:01,660\nSo I'm planning an outdoor rock concert.\n\n1666\n01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,700\nThere's a chance it could rain.\n\n1667\n01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,760\nI'm worried about that.\n\n1668\n01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:10,290\nSo instead of trying to reduce the chance\nof rain, which is hard to do, right?\n\n1669\n01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:11,880\nYeah, I imagine it's possible.\n\n1670\n01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,530\nI could instead say,\nyou know what, forget it.\n\n1671\n01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:15,740\nLet's have an indoor.\n\n1672\n01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:20,270\nWe move that rock concert indoor and\nwhen we do that, we just avoided the risk.\n\n1673\n01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:21,350\nThe risk is gone.\n\n1674\n01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:23,570\nI no longer have the risk.\n\n1675\n01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:26,550\nIt could still rain,\nthat could still happen.\n\n1676\n01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:29,000\nBut it no longer affects\nmy project in any way.\n\n1677\n01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,300\nI've completely avoided the risk.\n\n1678\n01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:36,360\nThis is the nicest, right,\nbecause it does eliminate the risk, but\n\n1679\n01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,230\nit's also not always possible.\n\n1680\n01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:44,650\nIf I have to get some stuff transported\nfrom one city to another and\n\n1681\n01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:49,700\nit's going in truck, there is a risk\nthe truck could be in an accident, right?\n\n1682\n01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:50,790\nHow can I avoid that?\n\n1683\n01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:52,100\nWell, I really can't.\n\n1684\n01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,460\nI've got to get this stuff\nfrom one city to another.\n\n1685\n01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:56,110\nI could fly it, I could send it by train.\n\n1686\n01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:58,230\nBut they all have a risk\nof being an accident.\n\n1687\n01:25:58,230 --> 01:25:59,540\nAnd they're a lot more expensive.\n\n1688\n01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:02,250\nSo, I may have to use that truck.\n\n1689\n01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:04,760\nSo I might not be able to avoid, and\n\n1690\n01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,430\nin those cases we start to move\ninto some of the other options.\n\n1691\n01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,790\nWe've got transfer.\n\n1692\n01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:13,620\nRisk transference, I talked about in\nthe last segment is buying insurance.\n\n1693\n01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,330\nNormally, is how it is.\n\n1694\n01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:17,550\nThis is where you say,\nall right, the risk is there.\n\n1695\n01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:19,200\nNot much I can do about it.\n\n1696\n01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,860\nLet me put the negative\neffects off on somebody else.\n\n1697\n01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,640\nWhen you buy car insurance,\nhealth insurance,\n\n1698\n01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:30,490\nany kind of insurance, you're playing,\nwhat is it Black Jack?\n\n1699\n01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:33,300\nAnd you buy dealer's insurance\nwhen they lay out a ten card?\n\n1700\n01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,310\nWell in those scenarios,\nyou're saying there's some\n\n1701\n01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:40,380\nrisks here that I’m going to lose,\nlet me push it off on somebody else.\n\n1702\n01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:42,870\nAnd the tradeoff is\nthat you're paying them\n\n1703\n01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:45,700\nin the event that the risk doesn't occur,\nthey just keep that money, right?\n\n1704\n01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,940\nAnd they make money betting\non it not happening,\n\n1705\n01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,750\nyou're paying them in case it does happen.\n\n1706\n01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,790\nYou’re both just betting different ways.\n\n1707\n01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,360\nThe odds are stacked in their favor.\n\n1708\n01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,610\nThe odds are always stacked in\nthe insurance company's favor.\n\n1709\n01:26:56,610 --> 01:27:00,900\nBut boy, you'll be glad you had it\nif that risk comes to fruition.\n\n1710\n01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:03,000\nSo we definitely wanna be aware of that,\n\n1711\n01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,750\nand transference is one\nof the most common.\n\n1712\n01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:08,510\nNow, key thing to remember about\ntransference for the exam.\n\n1713\n01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:10,770\nIf you transfer the risk to somebody else,\n\n1714\n01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:14,780\ndoes that reduce\nthe probability of that risk?\n\n1715\n01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:15,570\nNo.\n\n1716\n01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:18,180\nDoes it reduce the impact of the risk?\n\n1717\n01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:18,760\nNot really.\n\n1718\n01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,680\nIt does a little bit in that at least it's\nnot you having to pay out that money.\n\n1719\n01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,680\nYou don't have to set up a cash reserve.\n\n1720\n01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,370\nBut it's still gonna be impactful.\n\n1721\n01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:28,250\nSo those are things that you have.\n\n1722\n01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,410\nIn a business like this, so\n\n1723\n01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:33,800\nhere at ITProTV we have what we\ncall key man insurance policies.\n\n1724\n01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:38,080\nThe assumption is,\nif I'm a host of a show and\n\n1725\n01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,940\nI get in a car accident and\nlet's say I'm out, right?\n\n1726\n01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:41,920\nOr something happens.\n\n1727\n01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,241\nI catch some rare malarian plague or\nsomething like that.\n\n1728\n01:27:45,241 --> 01:27:47,702\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm just, I'm done for, right?\n\n1729\n01:27:47,702 --> 01:27:49,560\nDoes that affect the show?\n\n1730\n01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,282\nYeah.\n\n1731\n01:27:50,282 --> 01:27:53,506\nSo we have a key man policy that says hey,\nif this person backs off,\n\n1732\n01:27:53,506 --> 01:27:57,363\nthen we need some money to compensate\nthat, so we can hire somebody better, and\n\n1733\n01:27:57,363 --> 01:27:59,398\nsend Nate to acting school or something.\n\n1734\n01:27:59,398 --> 01:28:02,820\n[LAUGH] And get the show going that way.\n\n1735\n01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:06,670\nSo that's great but\nwe still lost the host.\n\n1736\n01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:08,260\nRight, I'm still out of commission.\n\n1737\n01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:09,910\nSo we still have to deal with that.\n\n1738\n01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,221\nBut at least the money makes\nyou feel a little better.\n\n1739\n01:28:12,221 --> 01:28:15,291\n[LAUGH] So,\nkeep that in mind with risk transference.\n\n1740\n01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:18,270\nIt often times has zero\neffect on probability.\n\n1741\n01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:21,540\nAnd it has a minimal effect on impact.\n\n1742\n01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,090\nSo, those are still there.\n\n1743\n01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:24,610\nAt least we get monetary compensation.\n\n1744\n01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:27,580\nAll right, mitigate.\n\n1745\n01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:30,060\nMitigate is the one that\nwe might most commonly do.\n\n1746\n01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:33,990\nWith mitigate we say all right, we can't\nreally transfer this to somebody else,\n\n1747\n01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:35,300\nwe can't avoid it.\n\n1748\n01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:39,990\nLet's just try to reduce\nthe probability as much as possible.\n\n1749\n01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:46,420\nThat outdoor rock concert in Florida,\nwe have a very pronounced rain season.\n\n1750\n01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:52,149\nIt starts raining here sometime in March\nand it pretty much rains through May.\n\n1751\n01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:54,940\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> It really [LAUGH]\n\n1752\n01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,580\n>> We get a lot of rain right here, and\n\n1753\n01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:58,160\nthen it does the same thing\nat the end of summer,\n\n1754\n01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:02,620\nso from the end of July through\nabout September, it rains.\n\n1755\n01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:05,040\nSo if I put on a rock\nconcert in those months,\n\n1756\n01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,010\nthere's a pretty good chance\nI'm gonna get rained out.\n\n1757\n01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:11,690\nRight, if I put on the concert on\nin November or I put it on in July,\n\n1758\n01:29:11,690 --> 01:29:14,710\nodds are it's not going to rain.\n\n1759\n01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:17,590\nRight?\nI can improve my chances of having a dry\n\n1760\n01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:19,950\nconcert by picking which\nmonth I put it in.\n\n1761\n01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:21,450\nThat's mitigating.\n\n1762\n01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:24,340\nI'm not eliminating it there is\nstill a chance it's going to rain.\n\n1763\n01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:29,030\nBut I reduce that probability, right.\n\n1764\n01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:32,830\nWhat are some other\nexamples of mitigating.\n\n1765\n01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:37,770\nActually I gave an example earlier,\nwhich was, if we have two show hosts.\n\n1766\n01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:40,530\nAnd one calls in sick,\nRonnie, calls in sick.\n\n1767\n01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:43,230\nI'm gonna stand up here by myself,\nit affects the show.\n\n1768\n01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:44,940\nBut what if I book a third host?\n\n1769\n01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:47,050\n>> I have a third host ready, standing by.\n\n1770\n01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,700\nWaiting to jump up here if we need them.\n\n1771\n01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,390\nAll right?\n\n1772\n01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:52,330\nAnd if Ronnie calls in sick,\nthat other person jumps in and off we go.\n\n1773\n01:29:52,330 --> 01:29:53,130\nRonnie was still sick.\n\n1774\n01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,130\nThat happened.\n\n1775\n01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:56,500\nBut I've got a back up plan, right?\n\n1776\n01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,420\nI guess it's more of\na contingency than a mitigation.\n\n1777\n01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:03,080\nA better example of mitigation might\nbe that I give everybody flue shots.\n\n1778\n01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:03,970\n>> Yes\n>> All right?\n\n1779\n01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:05,730\nI know that we might get sick.\n\n1780\n01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:10,820\nAnd so maybe, as a company, ITProTV\ndecides to go ahead and pay for flu shots.\n\n1781\n01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:14,230\nWe're gonna pay for Ronnie, and\nNate, and Mike, and Wes, and\n\n1782\n01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:18,020\nthen everybody who's on the show,\nJason, everybody get's a flu shot.\n\n1783\n01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:22,520\nI'm willing to pay that because it will\nreduce the chance of them getting sick.\n\n1784\n01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,800\nI'm mitigating that.\n\n1785\n01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,460\nAll right.\n\n1786\n01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:29,040\nAnd then the last one is accept.\n\n1787\n01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,470\nAccept is what we do when we're saying,\n\n1788\n01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:34,480\nthis is just a low\nprobability of occurring.\n\n1789\n01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,060\nRight, so I'm going to go ahead and\naccept the risk.\n\n1790\n01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:38,465\nI'm not gonna do anything.\n\n1791\n01:30:38,465 --> 01:30:41,655\nI know that there's a chance that\n\n1792\n01:30:41,655 --> 01:30:44,945\nJason's car might break down on\nthe way to work tomorrow, right?\n\n1793\n01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:47,295\nI know the odds are increased,\ncuz it's, what is it, 18 years old?\n\n1794\n01:30:47,295 --> 01:30:48,299\nSo.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n1795\n01:30:48,299 --> 01:30:50,462\nthe odds are somewhat increased.\n\n1796\n01:30:50,462 --> 01:30:52,344\nI'm not gonna do anything about it, right?\n\n1797\n01:30:52,344 --> 01:30:56,087\nI'm not gonna do anything about it,\nbecause tomorrow, I know that Ronnie and\n\n1798\n01:30:56,087 --> 01:30:57,800\nI are gonna be the hosts of the show.\n\n1799\n01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:01,437\nAnd I know that I can always get Nate,\nour producer, to jump in and\n\n1800\n01:31:01,437 --> 01:31:05,605\ncover Jason until he gets in, so we\nkind of already have things in place, so\n\n1801\n01:31:05,605 --> 01:31:07,217\nI'm not gonna do anything.\n\n1802\n01:31:07,217 --> 01:31:10,477\nI'm gonna accept that risk and\njust leave it be, right?\n\n1803\n01:31:10,477 --> 01:31:14,840\nIf it's a low impact or if it's a low\nprobability, or if they're both low,\n\n1804\n01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,680\nprobability and impact,\nthen we may choose to accept that risk and\n\n1805\n01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,990\njust not act upon it, right?\n\n1806\n01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:23,410\nSo that is something that we can do,\nand in a lot of cases that's fine.\n\n1807\n01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:26,140\nThe meteor thing, I'm accepting that risk.\n\n1808\n01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:30,210\nI don't have a meteor plan in case this\nbuilding gets destroyed by a meteor.\n\n1809\n01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:32,080\nI'm accepting that risk, right?\n\n1810\n01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,460\nSo when we look at our risks.\n\n1811\n01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:36,660\nWe need to find out which of these\nfour things we're gonna do, right?\n\n1812\n01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:37,880\nYou're doing one of these four.\n\n1813\n01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,790\nIf you ignore it, you're accepting, right?\n\n1814\n01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:44,570\nSo we either avoid, transfer,\nmitigate, or accept.\n\n1815\n01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:47,910\nThose are the four we do for\na negative risk.\n\n1816\n01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:52,720\nNow on a positive risk If it's a good.\n\n1817\n01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,350\nIf it's an opportunity right?\n\n1818\n01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:59,580\nI know that I need to buy lumber\nto build this house, all right?\n\n1819\n01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,130\nSo my project is to build a house.\n\n1820\n01:32:01,130 --> 01:32:01,970\nI know I'm gonna buy lumber.\n\n1821\n01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,960\nI know that there's two\ndifferent risks at work here.\n\n1822\n01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,670\nThere's a risk the price\nof lumber could go up\n\n1823\n01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:12,010\nfrom what I quoted in the planning phase.\n\n1824\n01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:14,420\nAll right, that's a real risk.\n\n1825\n01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:15,770\nHow can I mitigate that?\n\n1826\n01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:19,640\nI can make sure I buy the lumber early and\nnot wait, right?\n\n1827\n01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:23,240\nBut there's a risk that the price\nof lumber could go down,\n\n1828\n01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:27,050\nand if I buy lumber later\nI might save money.\n\n1829\n01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:29,020\nSo what do I do?\n\n1830\n01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,070\nHow do I handle that?\n\n1831\n01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:31,350\nHow do I make that decision?\n\n1832\n01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:34,380\nWell, I'll tell you in computers\nit's almost a guarantee\n\n1833\n01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:36,680\nthat the price will go down, right?\n\n1834\n01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:40,880\nSo, if I know that in my project I'm\ngoing to need to buy 400 computers,\n\n1835\n01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:44,230\nI might buy them in batches\ndepending on when I need them.\n\n1836\n01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:49,110\nI might buy 100 this month, and 100 the\nnext month, and 100 the third month, and\n\n1837\n01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:50,050\n100 the fourth month.\n\n1838\n01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:53,790\nKnowing that each month that\nprice might go down, and\n\n1839\n01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:55,620\nI save money by doing it that way.\n\n1840\n01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:56,520\nWorse case scenario,\n\n1841\n01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,630\nthe price will stay the same, right,\ncuz I've got a quote from that vendor.\n\n1842\n01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:02,280\nSo if I know the price\nis gonna stay the same,\n\n1843\n01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,410\nwhy not wait to see if\nthe price goes down.\n\n1844\n01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:07,850\nOr, you might be able to use\nthat in your negotiations, and\n\n1845\n01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:09,490\ntell the vendor well, you know what?\n\n1846\n01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:13,150\nI'm thinking about buying these month\nby month in case the price goes down,\n\n1847\n01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:14,930\nunless you'll give me a bulk discount.\n\n1848\n01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:18,200\nIf I buy all 400 hundred right now, will\nyou give me a bulk discount that basically\n\n1849\n01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,250\nequals what pricing I might\nhave if I ride this and see?\n\n1850\n01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:23,410\nAnd a lot of times, you can do that.\n\n1851\n01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:25,760\nAnd you can take that benefit early.\n\n1852\n01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,420\nAll right, you save that money.\n\n1853\n01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:34,040\nSo what we're doing here is we're doing\nwhat's called exploiting the risk.\n\n1854\n01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:38,360\nWe're doing whatever we can to make\nit more likely that that can happen.\n\n1855\n01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:42,510\nWhat can I do to ensure that the price of\nthat computer's as good as it's gonna get?\n\n1856\n01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:44,570\nI take advantage of that, right?\n\n1857\n01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:47,200\nBut I don't want you to get a quote\nthat's three months old and\n\n1858\n01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,300\nthen buy on that quote but\n\n1859\n01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:51,590\nif it's been three months I go and get\na new quote because I know it's gone down.\n\n1860\n01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:52,210\nRight?\n\n1861\n01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:56,790\nOr with lumber,\nmaybe I'd buy it all now to lock it in.\n\n1862\n01:33:56,790 --> 01:34:00,380\nOr I buy it in batches hoping\nthat that price goes down.\n\n1863\n01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:01,650\nOr I build that into my project.\n\n1864\n01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:05,150\nAnd I say, before you buy lumber, look at\nwhere the pricing has been and try and\n\n1865\n01:34:05,150 --> 01:34:08,910\nget it when it's at a valley\ninstead of a peak, right?\n\n1866\n01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:10,830\nSo we can build that\ninto our project plan.\n\n1867\n01:34:12,895 --> 01:34:14,525\nEnhance is another one.\n\n1868\n01:34:14,525 --> 01:34:19,745\nWhat is something that we can\ndo to enhance the risk, right?\n\n1869\n01:34:19,745 --> 01:34:24,535\nA good example here, that outdoor rock\nconcert, I know I'm going to do an outdoor\n\n1870\n01:34:24,535 --> 01:34:28,695\nrock concert, and it'd probably be a good\nidea to have a concession stand, right?\n\n1871\n01:34:28,695 --> 01:34:32,855\nIt's outdoors, people get thirsty,\nthey want a water or something,\n\n1872\n01:34:32,855 --> 01:34:36,115\na snack, we can make some good\nmoney on that concession stand.\n\n1873\n01:34:36,115 --> 01:34:41,090\nWell, there's a risk that I could sell\nlike crazy out of that concession stand.\n\n1874\n01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:43,190\nAnd I could run out of soda, right.\n\n1875\n01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:46,050\nWell that might be something\nI want to enhance.\n\n1876\n01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:48,250\nI want to enhance the likelihood\nthat I run out of soda.\n\n1877\n01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,560\nI want to sell out all my inventory.\n\n1878\n01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,440\nI don't want to be stuck with\n\n1879\n01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:51,680\ninventory after this concert\n>> Right.\n\n1880\n01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,550\n>> I want to sell it all, right?\n\n1881\n01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:55,710\nSo, how can I enhance that risk?\n\n1882\n01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:59,050\nI could schedule the concert during\nthe hottest month of the year.\n\n1883\n01:34:59,050 --> 01:35:00,620\nI could throw it right in August, right?\n\n1884\n01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:04,410\nAugust is miserable in Florida, and\nI could schedule it right there in August,\n\n1885\n01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:08,210\nand I know it's gonna be 98 degrees out\nthere all day long, and people are gonna\n\n1886\n01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:11,375\nbe buying that water like crazy, and\nI'll sell it for $4 a bottle, right?\n\n1887\n01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:13,039\nThis is what they do at concerts.\n\n1888\n01:35:13,039 --> 01:35:14,383\nThey gouge the customers.\n\n1889\n01:35:14,383 --> 01:35:16,600\nBut we can enhance it by doing that.\n\n1890\n01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,540\nIf I had the same concert in February,\nso it'll be nice and\n\n1891\n01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:23,280\ncold, rains might be coming in so\nit might be overcast.\n\n1892\n01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,150\nI might not sell much water at all.\n\n1893\n01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:29,400\nSo, what can I do to enhance that risk,\nmake it more likely to occur.\n\n1894\n01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,070\nWe can share the risk.\n\n1895\n01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:36,440\nSharing an opportunity, this a tough one.\n\n1896\n01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,090\nRight?\n\n1897\n01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:38,510\nWith sharing it I might say.\n\n1898\n01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:41,920\nYou know what, there is a change\nthe price of lumber might go down and\n\n1899\n01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,240\nI get to save money.\n\n1900\n01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,260\nBut I don't want to mess that.\n\n1901\n01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:48,050\nI don't want to deal with the prices\ngoing up and down and so on.\n\n1902\n01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:50,125\nIt's a hassle.\n\n1903\n01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:54,212\nSo instead what I'll do,\nis I'll hire a buyer.\n\n1904\n01:35:54,212 --> 01:35:57,091\nThere are several companies out\nthere that will act as buyers.\n\n1905\n01:35:57,091 --> 01:35:58,577\nBuyers for you.\n\n1906\n01:35:58,577 --> 01:36:02,070\nThey have different names, personal\nshopper, whatever but they're buyers.\n\n1907\n01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:05,210\nAnd you say, look, I need to buy lumber.\n\n1908\n01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:07,770\nI want you to get me\nthe best price on lumber.\n\n1909\n01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:08,850\nHere's a quote I got.\n\n1910\n01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:09,480\nI got this quote.\n\n1911\n01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,510\nThis is what I'm planning on paying.\n\n1912\n01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:16,540\nIf you can get it for less, I'll split\nthe difference with you 50%, right?\n\n1913\n01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,990\nYou can keep half.\n\n1914\n01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:21,770\nNow you're splitting it with them,\nthey're doing the work of going out and\n\n1915\n01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:25,340\ntrying to find this lumber cheaper and\nnegotiating, beating people up,\n\n1916\n01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:27,170\ntrying to get the best price possible.\n\n1917\n01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:29,560\nSo, they're doing stuff that\nyou're not doing anyway.\n\n1918\n01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:34,810\nYou were already ready to pay your quoted\nprice, so if they can get it cheaper and\n\n1919\n01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:39,540\nyou split the difference with them 50-50,\nyou save money that you weren't gonna save\n\n1920\n01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:44,690\nall ready and they make money by\nnegotiating and buying at a cheaper rate.\n\n1921\n01:36:44,690 --> 01:36:49,070\nThat's sharing the risk, you share with\nthem, because if they can't get it cheaper\n\n1922\n01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:52,320\nat the end of the day,\nyou don't split anything with them, right?\n\n1923\n01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,700\nAnd, so it didn't cost you anything.\n\n1924\n01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,750\nBut it didn't benefit them either, right?\n\n1925\n01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:58,910\nThat's sharing the risk and it's great.\n\n1926\n01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:02,210\nThere's a number of organizations\nout there that do this and\n\n1927\n01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:04,180\nthere's no reason not to, right?\n\n1928\n01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:06,530\nYou do take a little risk in that\nthey could totally screw up.\n\n1929\n01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:10,943\nBut the benefits are usually.\n\n1930\n01:37:10,943 --> 01:37:14,040\nAnd then we've got acceptance,\njust like on the negative side.\n\n1931\n01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:17,600\nWe can say, eh, you know there's a chance\nwe can get it cheaper, but eh, whatever.\n\n1932\n01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,970\nYou know, we'll accept it.\n\n1933\n01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:19,830\nIf it happens, great.\n\n1934\n01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:22,870\nIf it doesn't, whatever,\nwe're not worried about it.\n\n1935\n01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:24,839\nI like to call that\nthe government approach.\n\n1936\n01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:29,220\n[LAUGH] So, on that one, you know,\ngovernment, it is a different world.\n\n1937\n01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:34,310\nIf you get a quote, and it's like a\nlegally binding quote or whatever, the act\n\n1938\n01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:38,670\nof trying to get it cheaper can sometimes\ninvolve a ton of paperwork, and so you\n\n1939\n01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:42,160\njust accept the risk to get it done, cuz\notherwise you jeopardize your schedule.\n\n1940\n01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:46,360\nSo I make fun of the government, but\nwhen you've got an enemy that big,\n\n1941\n01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,570\na lot of times you don't have a choice.\n\n1942\n01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,890\nSo that's how it plays out.\n\n1943\n01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:50,560\nAll right.\n\n1944\n01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:54,220\nSo, those are some of techniques\nthere are member on a negative risk,\n\n1945\n01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:59,480\non a threat, it is avoid,\ntransfer, mitigate, accept.\n\n1946\n01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:02,500\nYou're trying to dodge that risk or\nminimize it.\n\n1947\n01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:09,290\nOn a positive risk or on opportunity it\nis exploit, enhance, share and accept.\n\n1948\n01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:13,070\nYou're trying to get the most out of it,\nyou want it to happen.\n\n1949\n01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:16,800\nSo different techniques,\nwell with the acceptation of acceptance,\n\n1950\n01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:21,890\ndifferent techniques for\nthem as far as what you're going to do.\n\n1951\n01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:26,161\nNow, when we start to look at these risks,\nthere's a chance they could happen, and\n\n1952\n01:38:26,161 --> 01:38:28,990\nthere's a chance they might not happen.\n\n1953\n01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:30,840\nIf they don't happen, what do we do?\n\n1954\n01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,160\nStay the course, right?\n\n1955\n01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,020\nThings go as planned.\n\n1956\n01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,780\nThe risk didn't happen,\nwe ignore it, we move on.\n\n1957\n01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:36,960\nEverything's going according to plan.\n\n1958\n01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:42,220\nIf the risk happens,\nthen we have to act, right?\n\n1959\n01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,400\nThen we have to do something.\n\n1960\n01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,530\nSo if that risk happens,\nnow what do we do?\n\n1961\n01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:51,000\nWell that's where we have our\ncontingent response strategy.\n\n1962\n01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,160\nContingency, plan B, right?\n\n1963\n01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,090\nPlan A was for this risk not to happen.\n\n1964\n01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:59,430\nPlan A was for us not to have a hurricane\nnext month, but we got a hurricane.\n\n1965\n01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:00,620\nSo now, we got plan B.\n\n1966\n01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:01,790\nWhat's plan B?\n\n1967\n01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:04,500\nPlan B might be we close the studio for\na few days and\n\n1968\n01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,860\nwe just don't record those days.\n\n1969\n01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:09,790\nHopefully our studio doesn't get\ndestroyed and we'll be back in business.\n\n1970\n01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:16,280\nOr we might have a plan C or a plan D, it\njust kind of depends on what's going on.\n\n1971\n01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,840\nSo a contingency is just that, the plan B.\n\n1972\n01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:23,110\nSo what are response strategies for\nthose contingencies?\n\n1973\n01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:25,820\nAnd it's really kind of\ncoming back to these guys.\n\n1974\n01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:28,480\nYou know, did we plan on avoiding or\nexploiting,\n\n1975\n01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:32,730\nenhancing, when we figure out what we want\nto do, that is our contingent response.\n\n1976\n01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:37,740\nThat’s our risks response,\nwhat we're going to do to fix our mess?\n\n1977\n01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:39,470\nOr it might be a good mess, right?\n\n1978\n01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:40,930\nIt might be a positive risk.\n\n1979\n01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:44,470\nWe invented some new product and\nsales are just through the roof.\n\n1980\n01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:47,620\nWe went viral on YouTube or\nsomething, and now it's gone nuts.\n\n1981\n01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,890\nSo, how do we get the most out of that?\n\n1982\n01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:50,810\nThat's our contingency.\n\n1983\n01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:55,665\nThe important thing is think of it now.\n\n1984\n01:39:55,665 --> 01:39:58,930\nThink of it right now,\nbefore the risk happens.\n\n1985\n01:39:58,930 --> 01:40:01,480\nThat way when the risk happens, you're not\nscrambling trying to figure things out.\n\n1986\n01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:02,560\nYou've already got it.\n\n1987\n01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:06,120\nYou've got documents, here's what I need\nto do to get beyond this and move forward.\n\n1988\n01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:11,530\nAll right, so\nthat's pretty much our process here.\n\n1989\n01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:15,550\nWe've got expert judgement again, which\nis your noodle, use your common sense.\n\n1990\n01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:19,690\nYou'll find opportunities that\nare there to get past these.\n\n1991\n01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:20,970\nAll right?\n\n1992\n01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:23,120\nWhen we're done, our outputs, and\n\n1993\n01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:26,130\nthe outputs look really simple,\nbut they're not.\n\n1994\n01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:28,680\nThis is, again, it's deceptive.\n\n1995\n01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:33,340\nProject Management Plan Updates,\nIf we didn't have a Risk Management Plan,\n\n1996\n01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:38,440\nwe had to come up with our response\nstrategies, how we're going to respond,\n\n1997\n01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:42,590\nthat stuff is going to make it\ninto our project management plan.\n\n1998\n01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:44,780\nIn particular, our risk management plan.\n\n1999\n01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:46,900\nBut this is where it gets challenging,\nright here.\n\n2000\n01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:48,710\nProject document Updates.\n\n2001\n01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:51,020\nNow we've seen that as an output\non several other ones.\n\n2002\n01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:53,240\nNow, I've always said, well,\nyou know, if you update your plan,\n\n2003\n01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:54,110\nyou've got to go and update it.\n\n2004\n01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:56,200\nMaybe you have some minor changes here.\n\n2005\n01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,150\nBut, depending on your\nrisk response strategies,\n\n2006\n01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:02,020\nthis is the first time where\nwe might have drastic change.\n\n2007\n01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:07,560\nIf we decided to transfer\na risk to somebody,\n\n2008\n01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:10,410\nwe're pushing that risk off to\nsomebody else by buying insurance.\n\n2009\n01:41:10,410 --> 01:41:14,100\nWe gotta pay for that insurance,\nour budget is now affected.\n\n2010\n01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:17,970\nOur scope might have defined a budget\nnow we gotta go update the scope.\n\n2011\n01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:19,470\nThat's a big change.\n\n2012\n01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:21,120\nDoing that here in planning is okay.\n\n2013\n01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,490\nDoing it in execution, monitoring,\ncontrolling is a nightmare.\n\n2014\n01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:25,460\nSo, we want to make sure we do this early.\n\n2015\n01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:29,230\nBut that means there's a lot of things\nthat can change and Ronnie, you did\n\n2016\n01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:33,860\nan awesome job here listing out all of\nthe different things that might change.\n\n2017\n01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:36,850\nOur risk owners and\nour agreed upon strategies.\n\n2018\n01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:39,650\nWe're creating those and we're putting\nthose in the risk register, right.\n\n2019\n01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:43,850\nWe saw that when I pulled\nup the risk register here.\n\n2020\n01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:47,080\nYou've got your risk statement,\nand then you've got your response.\n\n2021\n01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,330\nWhat are you gonna do about that risk,\nright?\n\n2022\n01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:55,500\nAnd then in our risk data sheet,\nlet me just get that pulled up here,\n\n2023\n01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,490\nwe've got not just the response,\nbut who's the responsible party?\n\n2024\n01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:02,980\nWho is it that's gonna be taking\nthis action to get it cleaned up?\n\n2025\n01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:05,590\nWho is that's gonna be doing\nthe monitoring to see if the risk\n\n2026\n01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:08,690\nhas occurred or if the probability\nhas increased or decreased on it?\n\n2027\n01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:12,940\nCuz it changes over time, so\nwe need to keep an eye on that.\n\n2028\n01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,850\nAnd that information\nall goes right in here.\n\n2029\n01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:17,920\nDo we have contingency funds and\ncontingency time?\n\n2030\n01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,930\nThink of that as reserves.\n\n2031\n01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:23,740\nWhat's our reserve time, reserve budget,\nin the event that this occurs?\n\n2032\n01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:28,030\nWe go and we update this, and if we\nidentified 100 risks, we have to go and\n\n2033\n01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:29,830\nupdate 100 of these sheets.\n\n2034\n01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:31,330\nIt's a lot of work.\n\n2035\n01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:33,970\nSo, we've got to get into that,\nwe've got to get that knocked down.\n\n2036\n01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:35,060\nSo, it is a lot.\n\n2037\n01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:38,890\nAnd you'll see the other things listed\nhere, budget and schedule activities.\n\n2038\n01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:40,310\nWe've got to account for that.\n\n2039\n01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:45,645\nAny of our fallback plans are residual\nrisks that might happen, right?\n\n2040\n01:42:45,645 --> 01:42:48,055\nWhat's an example of a residual risk?\n\n2041\n01:42:48,055 --> 01:42:54,115\nWell, if one employee gets sick, and\nwe fall behind schedule, one activity\n\n2042\n01:42:54,115 --> 01:42:58,050\nfalling behind schedule could cause other\nactivities to fall behind schedule.\n\n2043\n01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:01,570\nOne employee getting sick could lead\nto other employees getting sick.\n\n2044\n01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:02,770\nYou got an epidemic, right?\n\n2045\n01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:04,485\nLike in that Dustin Hoffman film.\n\n2046\n01:43:04,485 --> 01:43:05,838\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And before you know it you're all\n\n2047\n01:43:05,838 --> 01:43:06,882\nwearing the yellow suits.\n\n2048\n01:43:06,882 --> 01:43:08,056\n>> That's right.\n\n2049\n01:43:08,056 --> 01:43:09,920\n>> And it's all gone crazy.\n>> Looking for monkeys.\n\n2050\n01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:10,590\n>> That's right.\n\n2051\n01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:13,320\nOnce you bring the monkeys into\nit then it's an absolute mess.\n\n2052\n01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,750\nSo, those are examples of residual and\nsecondary risks,\n\n2053\n01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:20,900\nsometimes one risk is linked to another.\n\n2054\n01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:23,320\nIf we have a hurricane,\nwe may have floods,\n\n2055\n01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:27,850\nwe may have decreased sales these\nare all things that might be risks.\n\n2056\n01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:30,210\nYou might have risks that\nare completely out of left field.\n\n2057\n01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:34,960\nLike your projects moving forward and\na competitor moves in and opens up.\n\n2058\n01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,890\nOr a competitor launches a similar\nproduct ahead of yours right.\n\n2059\n01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:41,340\nAll of a sudden the entire\nplaying field changes.\n\n2060\n01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,110\nSo we've got to plan for all of that.\n\n2061\n01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:48,770\nAnd it creates a lot of a paperwork\nthat comes out of our projects.\n\n2062\n01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:53,460\nThis is the smallest of our processes but,\n\n2063\n01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:56,970\nit's descepting because it's\nprobably the most work.\n\n2064\n01:43:56,970 --> 01:43:58,050\n>> Right.\n\n2065\n01:43:58,050 --> 01:44:02,660\n>> But if you plan for this now, if you\nget your risk strategies in place now\n\n2066\n01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:07,140\nwhile you're in planning, when you get\ninto execution, you can sleep easy.\n\n2067\n01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:10,540\nBecause if a problem occurs,\nyou've already thought about it.\n\n2068\n01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:13,840\nYou've already planned for\nwhat you're gonna do, and you act on it.\n\n2069\n01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:17,140\nYou don't have to do change tickets cuz\nyou've already got the plan in place.\n\n2070\n01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:20,735\nYou're just following the instructions\nyou've already except four, all right?\n\n2071\n01:44:20,735 --> 01:44:22,485\nSo very good stuff.\n\n2072\n01:44:22,485 --> 01:44:25,485\nThis is why risk managers are so valuable.\n\n2073\n01:44:25,485 --> 01:44:28,495\nI hear people make fun of risk\nmanagers from time to time because\n\n2074\n01:44:28,495 --> 01:44:31,595\nif the risks never happen, what does\nthe risk manager really do, right?\n\n2075\n01:44:31,595 --> 01:44:35,690\nBut man, they're doing a very\nimportant service in your company, and\n\n2076\n01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:39,120\nthey're basically making sure that you're\ninsulated from the problems that could\n\n2077\n01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,570\nlead to your project failing.\n\n2078\n01:44:40,570 --> 01:44:41,540\nSo very very valuable.\n\n2079\n01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,020\nAll right.\n\n2080\n01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:46,130\nWell, I think that pretty\nmuch wraps up risk.\n\n2081\n01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:48,920\nRonnie, can you think of\nanything I've left out.\n\n2082\n01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,360\n>> Nope, I cannot. [LAUGH] >> All right,\n\n2083\n01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:56,140\nwell we just have a little bit more\nto go in our planning processes.\n\n2084\n01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:58,870\nWe'll see procurement management,\nwhich is our contracts.\n\n2085\n01:44:58,870 --> 01:45:01,890\nAnd our stakeholder management,\nwhich is attaching and\n\n2086\n01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:03,060\nremoving people from a project.\n\n2087\n01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,280\nSo, we're gonna see a little bit of those,\nbut\n\n2088\n01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:05,970\nwe're pretty much\n>> Right\n\n2089\n01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:07,450\n>> ready to jump into execution there, so\n\n2090\n01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:10,730\nwe'll have one more short episode for\nplanning, and\n\n2091\n01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:13,530\nwe're gonna jump into execution,\nreally start to see some things take off.\n\n2092\n01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:16,630\nSo, definitely stay tuned for that.\n\n2093\n01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:19,200\nBut otherwise,\nif you guys have any questions,\n\n2094\n01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:23,160\nlet me just remind you, Live during\nthe show you can go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n2095\n01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:25,690\nYou'll see our chat box beneath the video.\n\n2096\n01:45:25,690 --> 01:45:26,650\nPost your questions there.\n\n2097\n01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:30,220\nWe monitor and answer,\nwanna make sure you get the help you need.\n\n2098\n01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:33,130\nAlso if you have questions after the show,\n\n2099\n01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:35,470\nif you're watching this\nrecorded Use the Q & A form.\n\n2100\n01:45:35,470 --> 01:45:39,070\nYou'll see a link at the top of\nthe page that says Q & A click on that.\n\n2101\n01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:40,520\nIt will take you to the forms.\n\n2102\n01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,610\nPost your questions there we monitor and\nanswer.\n\n2103\n01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:45,928\nWe want to make sure you get the help you\nneed so you're prepared for that exam.\n\n2104\n01:45:45,928 --> 01:45:46,733\n>> Right.\n>> And you're prepared for\n\n2105\n01:45:46,733 --> 01:45:47,392\nmanaging that project.\n\n2106\n01:45:47,392 --> 01:45:49,180\nAll right.\n\n2107\n01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:50,320\nI hope you guys have enjoyed the show.\n\n2108\n01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,835\nSigning off for IT Pro Tv, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n2109\n01:45:52,835 --> 01:45:53,422\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n2110\n01:45:53,422 --> 01:45:57,970\n>> And we will see\n\n2111\n01:45:57,970 --> 01:46:02,899\nyou next time.\n\n2112\n01:46:02,899 --> 01:46:06,277\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

planning?\n\n21\n00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,740\nWell, it is important.\n\n22\n00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,740\nI can't stress that enough.\n\n23\n00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,270\nSo, we want to make sure\nthat we're thorough.\n\n24\n00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,560\nWe have the last two processes\nto jump into this time around.\n\n25\n00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,960\nSo, let me bring up my old trusty PMBOK\nbot and we will get into the last two.\n\n26\n00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,250\nNow the last two aren't very long and\nsome of them are actually kind of new.\n\n27\n00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,960\nLet's see where did I put that?\n\n28\n00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,970\nThere we go.\nOkay.\n\n29\n00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,350\nSo if we take a look at our planning\nprocess group a lot of these are very\n\n30\n00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,000\nvery old.\n\n31\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,380\nThey've been around in the PMBOK since\nVersion 1 which is before my time.\n\n32\n00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,380\nI started with Version three And\nyou know, then version four came out and\n\n33\n00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,820\nnow we're on version five.\n\n34\n00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,340\nWell, one of the things that was added in\nversion four, so it's one that's only been\n\n35\n00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,190\naround for a few years,\nis the procurement management, the whole\n\n36\n00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,010\nknowledge area really, everything\nassociated with that was kinda new.\n\n37\n00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,000\nAbout the plan procurement management.\n\n38\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,560\nThis is talking about contracts.\n\n39\n00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,010\nSo how we handle contracts inside of\nour project that used to be done just\n\n40\n00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,930\nunderneath costs and then it was\nbranched out in the fourth edition.\n\n41\n00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,980\nSo now that we're in the fifth\nedition of the PMBOK this is\n\n42\n00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,440\na well-established standard now, so it's\nsomething you're expected to understand.\n\n43\n00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,250\nThey gave us some leniency under the\nfourth edition saying, well some people\n\n44\n00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,990\nmight have learned it some way versus\nanother, so we'll give them a break.\n\n45\n00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,730\nNo more breaks,\nright now you gotta know it this way.\n\n46\n00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,380\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat procurement management.\n\n47\n00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,330\nAnd then we're gonna wrap up talking\nabout stakeholder management.\n\n48\n00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,520\nI know we've addressed that\na little bit because this is one of\n\n49\n00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,420\nthe few that had a process in\nthe initiation process group.\n\n50\n00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,350\nSo identify stakeholders,\nwe've already done.\n\n51\n00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,590\nNow we're figuring out how we're\ngonna manage the stakeholders,\n\n52\n00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,850\nchanging them, adding new ones,\nmaking modifications and so on.\n\n53\n00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,080\nSo we'll get a chance to see that,\nthat's what we've got lined up today.\n\n54\n00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,370\nOnce that's done, then planning is over,\nright, we're done!\n\n55\n00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,750\nThen we get to move on over\ninto our execution and\n\n56\n00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,960\nmonitoring control which is pretty big.\n\n57\n00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,640\nLet's take a look at planning\nprocurement management.\n\n58\n00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,130\nFirst off, that word procurement.\n\n59\n00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,400\nProcurement just means getting something.\n\n60\n00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,030\nWhenever you go and get something,\nit might be for free, who knows.\n\n61\n00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,470\nBut when you procure something\nis when you secure it or\n\n62\n00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,200\nobtain it to be able to\nuse within your project.\n\n63\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,520\nIn the terms of the PMBOK,\nit's typically referring to a contract.\n\n64\n00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,970\nAnd that contract might\nbe a time-based contract,\n\n65\n00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,990\nlike you're hiring somebody to come and\ndo some work over time.\n\n66\n00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,850\nOr might be an outright purchase,\nI'm buying a computer.\n\n67\n00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,720\nThere's not really a time associated\nwith that, we buy the computer and\n\n68\n00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,070\nnow it's ours, we don't pay for\nit and it's not ours.\n\n69\n00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,690\nThat's pretty much it on and\noff, it works or it doesn't.\n\n70\n00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,790\nAs opposed to, getting somebody\nto come and do labor for us, or\n\n71\n00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,550\nwe've got to monitor that and\nmake sure that it happens.\n\n72\n00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,750\nEither the computers we've bought show up,\nor they don't.\n\n73\n00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,700\nSo when we enter into\nany kind of contract,\n\n74\n00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,130\nbe it a purchase or an ongoing service.\n\n75\n00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,670\nThere's a lot of stuff that\nwe have to put into play.\n\n76\n00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,500\nAnd contracts at least\nin the United States and\n\n77\n00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,640\nI know in most countries\nare legally binding.\n\n78\n00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,400\nWhen you enter into a contract you and\nanother party are agreeing to something.\n\n79\n00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,130\nAnd if one of you doesn't\nlive up to your obligation\n\n80\n00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,920\nthere's usually a penalty associated.\n\n81\n00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,350\nIf there's no penalty you may as\nwell not have a contract, right?\n\n82\n00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,070\nBut there's usually a penalty\nassociated with it.\n\n83\n00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,180\nSo when we talk about\nprocurement management,\n\n84\n00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,870\nwe're not just talking about\ncreating the contract.\n\n85\n00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,720\nWe're talking about how we monitor it,\nensure people live up to it,\n\n86\n00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,120\nhow we penalize if they\nfail to honor the contract.\n\n87\n00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,280\nAnd then how we terminate the contract\nwhen it's all said and done.\n\n88\n00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,990\nAnd so\nwe'll see a little bit of that as we go.\n\n89\n00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,190\nAll right, couple of terms\nyou wanna be familiar with.\n\n90\n00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,090\nWhen we talk about contracts,\nyou can execute a contract, and\n\n91\n00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,660\nyou can terminate a contract.\n\n92\n00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,260\nNow, if In our common language,\nif I say I'm going to execute Ronnie or\n\n93\n00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,210\nif I'm going to terminate Ronnie,\npretty much means the same thing.\n\n94\n00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,510\nRight?\nSo but in the contract world it doesn't.\n\n95\n00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,560\nExecuting the contract\nmeans you're signing it.\n\n96\n00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,930\nYou're making it active.\n\n97\n00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,820\nSo, it's now ready to execute.\n\n98\n00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,960\nIt's ready to move into our execution\nphase where it's actually going to occur.\n\n99\n00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,520\nTerminating it means we end the contract,\nand\n\n100\n00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,850\nnormally we end it because\nit's been fulfilled.\n\n101\n00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,880\nEverything we asked for has been done.\n\n102\n00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,040\nContract terms have been met,\nwe terminate the contract.\n\n103\n00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,610\nRight?\n\n104\n00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,130\nBut you can also terminate a contract for\nother things like breach of contract.\n\n105\n00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,560\nMaybe there's been a fundamental breach\nand the contract cant continue so\n\n106\n00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,770\nthen we terminate there.\n\n107\n00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,470\nSo in our Procurement Management Process,\nwe are trying to establish that\n\n108\n00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,630\nprocess of how we go about executing and\nterminating the contracts.\n\n109\n00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,400\nWhat things need to be aware and\nwhat people need to be involved.\n\n110\n00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,020\nAnd I'm the first person to admit,\nI am terrible at writing contracts.\n\n111\n00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,490\nI'm not an attorney, right?\n\n112\n00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,080\nI don't know the stuff to put in there.\n\n113\n00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,920\nSo anytime I deal with a contract,\nI bring in a legal department, right?\n\n114\n00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,450\nIf you're fortunate enough\nto work at an agency or\n\n115\n00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,960\ncompany that has a legal department,\nyou can use that.\n\n116\n00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,250\nIf you don't you need one on retainer.\n\n117\n00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,950\nSomebody you can take that contract to.\n\n118\n00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,960\nSomebody who specializes in\ncontract law who can evaluate it.\n\n119\n00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,750\nEnsure that the proper clauses are in\nthere to protect your company and\n\n120\n00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,540\nto protect your interests.\n\n121\n00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:17,020\nAll right so\n\n122\n00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,460\nIf we're going to be doing that kind\nof activity we need a lot of data.\n\n123\n00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,630\nThis is another one where\nit's not as bad as some.\n\n124\n00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,741\nI don't have 13 inputs.\n\n125\n00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:27,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we have a lot of inputs here.\n\n126\n00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,314\nThe key ones that we're concerned about,\n\n127\n00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:34,670\nare our requirements augmentation\nbecause that says what we need done.\n\n128\n00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,050\nEither what equipment we need to buy or\n\n129\n00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,980\nwhat work needs to be done\nto fulfill our needs.\n\n130\n00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,145\nAnd then our risk register, which is gonna\ntell us, any potential shortfalls or\n\n131\n00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:49,005\nissues that we might have, that we\nmight need to build another contract.\n\n132\n00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:52,735\nThose are the two most important\ninputs when it comes to planning for\n\n133\n00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:53,905\ncurrent management.\n\n134\n00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:55,805\nBut see this a lot more, right?\n\n135\n00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:58,205\nActivity resource requirements.\n\n136\n00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:00,795\nIf I'm planning to drywall a house,\n\n137\n00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,665\nI know I can bring a contractor\nin to do that drywall, right?\n\n138\n00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:05,565\nBut if they send me just one person,\n\n139\n00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:07,770\nit's gonna take them a lot\nlonger to get it done.\n\n140\n00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,510\nSo I need to make sure that I specify\nin my contract exactly how many\n\n141\n00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,020\ntechnicians or dry wall installers or\nwhatever they're called that I need so\n\n142\n00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,470\nthat I can get it done in\nthe amount of time that I've got.\n\n143\n00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,110\nSo our resource requirements listed\non our activities will tell us that.\n\n144\n00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,526\nRight?\nSo that's another input that we have.\n\n145\n00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,383\nOur project schedule.\n\n146\n00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:29,220\nNow our project schedule is going\nto serve two purposes here.\n\n147\n00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,680\nIt's going to actually be an input and\nan output.\n\n148\n00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,480\nIt's an input in terms of I need to\nknow what work I need done when.\n\n149\n00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,210\nSo I need dry wall installed and\nI need it done the second week of June.\n\n150\n00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,750\nCan you do it?\nAll right.\n\n151\n00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,670\nThat's what I'm asking the contractor.\n\n152\n00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,530\nAnd they come back and\nthey say yes, we can do it.\n\n153\n00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,800\nGreat.\nSo their schedule is my input, right?\n\n154\n00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,380\nThat's how I figure out when\nthe work was going to get done.\n\n155\n00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,142\nOr it might be an output.\n\n156\n00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:55,845\nThe contractor says hey,\nI can save you 50%.\n\n157\n00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:58,909\nI can cut your drywall budget down by 50%.\n\n158\n00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:02,602\nIf you can just wait to the last week in\nJune, we got some other projects going on.\n\n159\n00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:04,450\nOnce they're wrapped up,\nwe can knock it out.\n\n160\n00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,650\nWe'll give you it half price, right?\n\n161\n00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,470\nSo now we say, ooh,\nthat's really good right?\n\n162\n00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,420\nWe can saves some money.\n\n163\n00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,720\nThat's gonna help.\n\n164\n00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,990\nAll we have to do is move that\ndrywall back three weeks?\n\n165\n00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,940\nLet's do it.\n\n166\n00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,800\nSo on our output we'll have\na project document update.\n\n167\n00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,923\nAnd we'll go and update that schedule to\nreflect this new timeline that gave us\n\n168\n00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:24,300\na better deal or\nserved some kind of purpose.\n\n169\n00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,030\nOr maybe it's just something\nthat we had to have.\n\n170\n00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,671\nWe had to have this done, and they could\nonly do it the third week of June so\n\n171\n00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:32,657\nwe gotta shift things around, right.\n\n172\n00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:35,128\nSo sometimes our input becomes our output,\nright,\n\n173\n00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:37,342\nthat we've got to make\nchanges to support it.\n\n174\n00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:42,414\nAll right, some of the other things,\nthe activity cost estimates,\n\n175\n00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:46,971\nwe've got money that we budgeted for\neach of our activities.\n\n176\n00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:50,493\nAnd if we already determined it,\nwhen we go to line up our contracts,\n\n177\n00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:53,790\nwe need to make sure they\nget done within that budget.\n\n178\n00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,510\nWe're gonna see a little bit later\nthat there's more than one type of\n\n179\n00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,310\ncontract that we can enter into.\n\n180\n00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,644\nAnd there's contracts that protect\nus by ensuring they never go over\n\n181\n00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:04,597\nthe amount that we specified.\n\n182\n00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:08,339\nAnd there's contracts that protect\nthe contractor, whoever's doing the work,\n\n183\n00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,333\nto ensure that they don't get in\na situation where they're losing\n\n184\n00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,875\nmoney on the contract.\n\n185\n00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,925\nSo we have to find a middle ground\nbetween the two where we protect\n\n186\n00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:21,455\nboth our interests, ours as well as the\ncontractor, to ensure the work gets done.\n\n187\n00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:26,110\nSo, that is something that we need\nto be aware of, and we'll see,\n\n188\n00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,430\nand that's part of why the cost\nestimates become part of our inputs.\n\n189\n00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,170\nOur stakeholder register, right,\nif we enter into a contract,\n\n190\n00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,400\nwe're gonna have to make some choices.\n\n191\n00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,280\nWe're gonna have to choose a vendor,\nand so on.\n\n192\n00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,690\nAnd our stakeholders are gonna\nbe a part of that process.\n\n193\n00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,890\nAnd we're just gonna need\nto communicate with them.\n\n194\n00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,830\nAlso if we enter into a contractor, you\nmight remember from that initiation phase,\n\n195\n00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,040\nanybody we enter into a contract with\nbecomes a stakeholder in the project.\n\n196\n00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,700\nSo our stakeholder register is gonna\nupdate also as we add these new\n\n197\n00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,930\npeople to it to be informed.\n\n198\n00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,670\nAnd our RACI matrix, right,\nthe responsibility, accountability,\n\n199\n00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,710\nthat matrix,\nwe'll have to add in new people there.\n\n200\n00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,580\nBecause if it's contracted out,\n\n201\n00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,370\nthat contracted party is now\naccountable for the work.\n\n202\n00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,990\nBut I, as the project manager,\nmight be responsible for it.\n\n203\n00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,230\nJust cuz we contracted it out, doesn't\nmean we can wash our hands and that's it.\n\n204\n00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,590\nAs a project manager you're\nstill responsible, right?\n\n205\n00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,724\nBut now it's somebody else\nwho's accountable for the work.\n\n206\n00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,210\nI throw these out,\nI've got this vision in my mind.\n\n207\n00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,380\nBut just in case you don't remember\nwhat the RACI documents are,\n\n208\n00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,489\nlet me go back into our templates here,\nand I'll pull that up.\n\n209\n00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:39,680\nLet's see, that is our responsibility\nassignment matrix, this guy right here.\n\n210\n00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:44,340\nAll right, so this is a document that we\nbrought up in an earlier episode where we\n\n211\n00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,070\nflagged who's responsible,\n\n212\n00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,760\nwho is accountable, who gets consulted,\nand who gets informed.\n\n213\n00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,910\nAnd so you'll see all those right in here,\nwe just kinda flag each one.\n\n214\n00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,500\nWhen we contract something out,\n\n215\n00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,680\nthat's a new person who is now\naccountable for that work.\n\n216\n00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,250\nBut as the PM, we may be responsible.\n\n217\n00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,080\nSo, we just kind of flag\nthat in here to keep track.\n\n218\n00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,620\nI think I also mentioned that I don't\nlike these diagrams because they don't\n\n219\n00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,710\nscale very well.\n\n220\n00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,091\nBut that's it.\n\n221\n00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,156\nAll right, so\nwe gather all of our data together.\n\n222\n00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:20,340\nWe get that information, and\nnow we're ready to act upon it, right.\n\n223\n00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,340\nSo, if we want to act upon it,\nwe need some tools and techniques, and\n\n224\n00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,820\nyou'll see they're pretty\nstraightforward here.\n\n225\n00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,770\nThey actually don't list some of them so\nI'm gonna deviate a little bit.\n\n226\n00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:36,317\nBut the first one is we have what's\ncalled a make-or-buy analysis, all right?\n\n227\n00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:40,735\nMake-or-buy analysis is one of those\nterms that can be a little misleading.\n\n228\n00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:45,345\nBut basically whenever we have\na job that needs to be done,\n\n229\n00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:46,165\nwe got to make a decision.\n\n230\n00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:50,095\nIs it something we can do ourselves or\n\n231\n00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:54,260\nis it something I should pay\nsomebody else to do, all right?\n\n232\n00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,820\nMake or buy?\n\n233\n00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,270\nCan I make it myself or should I just\nbuy something that's already been built?\n\n234\n00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,330\nSo we run into this at\nITProTV all the time, right.\n\n235\n00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,630\nWe're tech guys, all of us, all the staff\nhere, everybody here is a techie,\n\n236\n00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,050\nwe like gadgets.\n\n237\n00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,200\nWe know computers really well, right.\n\n238\n00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,050\nAnd so, then we have to look\nat things like our studio.\n\n239\n00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,600\nWith all our cameras and\nour lighting and stuff, we're tech guys,\n\n240\n00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,520\nI know how a camera works.\n\n241\n00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,450\nDo we need to hire somebody to come in and\nset up the cameras for us, or\n\n242\n00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,460\ncan we do it ourselves?\n\n243\n00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,200\nWell you do a make or buy analysis.\n\n244\n00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,480\nYou look at it, and you say well,\nI could set up the cameras myself, right.\n\n245\n00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,610\nMost of them are pretty straightforward,\nyou can hook them up.\n\n246\n00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,500\nIt would take me a few hours, probably,\nto set the cameras up so I could do that.\n\n247\n00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,720\nAnd then all the little settings in there.\n\n248\n00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,950\nNow, things start to get a little fuzzy.\n\n249\n00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,150\nI got a camera at home,\nI just set it to auto.\n\n250\n00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,705\nBut here in the studio,\nI might need to set the aperture.\n\n251\n00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:52,482\nI might need to set the white balancing.\n\n252\n00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:56,187\nI might need to set, Jason,\nwhat's all the stuff we set on the camera?\n\n253\n00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:59,135\n[LAUGH]\n>> Stuff.\n\n254\n00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:01,016\n>> The stuff, so the contrast, right.\n\n255\n00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:03,860\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Good job video guy.\n\n256\n00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,528\nSo, [LAUGH] there's all sorts of\ndifferent things to set on a camera, and\n\n257\n00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:08,987\nI don't know them, right.\n\n258\n00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:12,750\nI didn't go to film school or\nwherever it is you go to learn that stuff.\n\n259\n00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,170\nSo I don't really know how\na camera operates, right.\n\n260\n00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,194\nI know there's light refraction\noff of a sensor or whatever, but\n\n261\n00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:22,133\nI also know that I could\nprobably figure it out.\n\n262\n00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,500\nBut it would time, right.\n\n263\n00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,043\nIt might take me days, or even weeks,\n\n264\n00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:28,000\nto get the cameras here in\nthe studio set up just right.\n\n265\n00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,400\nBut I could just pay somebody.\n\n266\n00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,804\nI could hire somebody to come in\nwho's a camera specialist, and\n\n267\n00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:34,955\nthey could set up all the cameras for us.\n\n268\n00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:37,290\nAnd I know it's done right.\n\n269\n00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,550\nAnd it freed me up to do other things,\nright?\n\n270\n00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,740\nSo it costs some money, but the job\nwas done right, and it took less time.\n\n271\n00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,360\nAnd that can be very valuable, all right.\n\n272\n00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,220\nAnd, I mean, that's exactly what we did.\n\n273\n00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,970\nLike our lighting, we actually brought\na lighting specialist in to hook these up,\n\n274\n00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,950\nbecause I know how a light works.\n\n275\n00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,550\nYou flip the switch and it's on, right?\n\n276\n00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,770\nBut eliminating shadows on the face and\nall that good stuff.\n\n277\n00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,940\nIt's a science and it's beyond me.\n\n278\n00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,230\nSo that's kind of the example of a make or\nbuy analysis.\n\n279\n00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,730\nCan you do it internally or not?\n\n280\n00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,320\nIt is something we face all the time.\n\n281\n00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,940\nWe need a web server.\n\n282\n00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,803\nDo we set it up ourselves?\n\n283\n00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:11,480\nWe know how.\n\n284\n00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,880\nWe can do it.\n\n285\n00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,811\nOr, do I want to contract that out because\nI don't want to deal with it day to day,\n\n286\n00:14:18,811 --> 00:14:19,699\nall right.\n\n287\n00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:20,820\nThat's another great example, our website.\n\n288\n00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,603\nYou're on ITP, well, the streaming video,\nyou are watching this live streaming video\n\n289\n00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:28,491\nright now, or\nyou are watching it recorded, right.\n\n290\n00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:31,928\nI know how to set up\na Flash streaming server.\n\n291\n00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:35,083\nI know how to set up a Wowza server so\nI know how those work.\n\n292\n00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,988\nI know how Amazon CloudFront works.\n\n293\n00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:39,194\nI can set up all that, the edge CDN.\n\n294\n00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:40,796\nThat's all stuff that I've done before.\n\n295\n00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,140\nI can easily do it.\n\n296\n00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,870\nBut when I come into work in the morning,\nI don't want to worry about the stream.\n\n297\n00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,940\nI want to walk right up here to this\npodium or whatever we call this thing and\n\n298\n00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,220\ndo a show, right?\n\n299\n00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,600\nI want to do a show when I come into work.\n\n300\n00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,020\nI don't want to tweak a video stream,\nright.\n\n301\n00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,062\nAnd Apple releases some new encoding\nthat they require on the device.\n\n302\n00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:01,300\nNow we got to update\nall our video streams.\n\n303\n00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,750\nI don't wanna worry about that, right?\n\n304\n00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,900\nI want to do a show.\n\n305\n00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,780\nSo in that scenario, we do a buy.\n\n306\n00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,960\nWe say there's plenty of companies out\nthere that specialize in video streaming,\n\n307\n00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,240\nwe'll use them, right?\n\n308\n00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,470\nAnd so we do, we use Scale Engine,\nVimeo, Amazon S3,\n\n309\n00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,100\nwe use several different providers.\n\n310\n00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,670\nAnd we let them worry about the video,\nso that we don't have to, right?\n\n311\n00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,266\nAnd on a day like today, for\nany of you watching live,\n\n312\n00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:27,060\nyou know the video stream\nwasn't working this morning.\n\n313\n00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,455\nAnd instead of us having to wrack\nour brains and figure it out,\n\n314\n00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:31,903\nwe open a support ticket.\n\n315\n00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:34,682\nAnd so Ronnie and I worked on our\nshow notes before the show, and\n\n316\n00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:35,795\nthe stream was working.\n\n317\n00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:39,780\nAnd that's the kind of thing that\nyou really benefit from with a buy.\n\n318\n00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,830\nBut there are times where you say I need\na web developer on this project to design\n\n319\n00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,700\npart of the website.\n\n320\n00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,285\nI've got staff web developers, that's\nwhat they do, that's what their job is.\n\n321\n00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:53,339\nI'll just get my internal guys\nto design that website, and\n\n322\n00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,203\nthen by doing that, you save some money\ncuz you've already got the staff.\n\n323\n00:15:57,203 --> 00:16:00,210\nYou may or may not save time,\nit just depends.\n\n324\n00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,764\nBut you can save money.\n\n325\n00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:05,860\nThat is a make or buy analysis.\n\n326\n00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,660\nIt’s up to you, your environment,\n\n327\n00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,220\nyour company whether one way is\nmore worthwhile over the other.\n\n328\n00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,751\nJust remember,\ndon't look at it just in terms of costs.\n\n329\n00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,586\n>> All right.\n\n330\n00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:21,780\n>> It would cost us less if I set up\nthe lighting in the studio myself, right?\n\n331\n00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,560\nI can read a manual,\nI can flip a power switch.\n\n332\n00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,530\nBut timewise, it's going to take me a lot\nlonger to get it right than an actual\n\n333\n00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:36,260\ncertified, licensed,\nunion light studio set whatever person.\n\n334\n00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,410\nI don't even know what they're called.\n\n335\n00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:37,970\n>> Me neither.\n\n336\n00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,020\n>> Hm.\nLighting techs.\n\n337\n00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,450\nAnyhow, whatever\na lighting tech is called.\n\n338\n00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,130\nSorry if any of you guys\nare lighting techs.\n\n339\n00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,525\nI just don't know the title.\n\n340\n00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:45,400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The microphone guy,\n\n341\n00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,650\nit's like a key grip to bring\nyou an actual key grip.\n\n342\n00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,800\nSo anyhow, that's the kind of things you\nhave to analyse when you do a make or\n\n343\n00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,082\nbuy analysis.\n\n344\n00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:53,930\nAll right.\n\n345\n00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,500\nThat term make, it's not really making\nanymore, its usually service related.\n\n346\n00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,680\nBut, it could be the actual\ninstruction of something.\n\n347\n00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,790\nI think I gave an example of a asphalt\ncompany in one of the episodes, and\n\n348\n00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,540\nthey used some really\nspecialized equipment.\n\n349\n00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,600\nEquipment that is so specialized that\nif they go out and buy, it's really,\n\n350\n00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,800\nreally expensive.\n\n351\n00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,470\nBut, they've got engineers on staff.\n\n352\n00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,440\nAnd in some cases, they can construct that\nequipment themselves and save a good bit.\n\n353\n00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440\nSometimes they can't, right?\n\n354\n00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,082\nThat's what the make or\nbuy analysis is all about.\n\n355\n00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:26,987\nAll right.\n\n356\n00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:30,029\nThe next entry I have here\nis the expert judgement.\n\n357\n00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:33,767\nAnd expert judgement,\nagain that's using our noodle.\n\n358\n00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:37,490\nBut what I wanna do is I wanna\nto break out of our mold here,\n\n359\n00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,110\nand talk about something else that\nfalls under expert judgement too.\n\n360\n00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,570\nWhen we talk about procurement management,\nwe're entering into contracts.\n\n361\n00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,770\nAnd there's different types\nof contracts out there, and\n\n362\n00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,140\nit's our expert judgement that\nlets us know which one to pick.\n\n363\n00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,910\nAnd thankfully, Ronnie,\n\n364\n00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,410\nwho is always prepared made a list\nof the contract type for us.\n\n365\n00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,180\nAll right?\n\n366\n00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,060\nSo you'll see here,\n\n367\n00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,480\non the exam there's actually going to be,\nwhat is it, eleven different contracts.\n\n368\n00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,922\n>> Yep.\n>> Yeah, 11 different contracts.\n\n369\n00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:08,760\nSo, 11 contracts in three different\ncategories that are available anytime\n\n370\n00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,240\nwe enter into some kind of contract or\nprocurement, right?\n\n371\n00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,540\nSo, some of these up here at\nthe top are pretty common.\n\n372\n00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,470\nYou see actual cost plus\nprofit margin based.\n\n373\n00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,210\nAll right?\n\n374\n00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,000\nWhen you enter into\na contract with somebody,\n\n375\n00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,690\nthey're gonna charge you x\namount of dollars, right?\n\n376\n00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,420\nAnd that company that's writing\nthe contract, they're thinking, all right.\n\n377\n00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,830\nThis is what it's gonna\ncost us to actually do it,\n\n378\n00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,375\nand then here's our profit.\n\n379\n00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,400\nRight?\n\n380\n00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,930\nWhen we enter into a contract, we might\nwant to be very clear about that so\n\n381\n00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,850\nthat we understand what it's actually\ncosting them versus what their profit is.\n\n382\n00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,295\nEverybody deserves to make a profit,\nright?\n\n383\n00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:46,870\nSo we're just being upfront\nabout it in the contract.\n\n384\n00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,190\nYou also have just the straight up agreed\nprice for contracted product, right?\n\n385\n00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,690\nWith this, we're normally talking\nabout the purchase of equipment.\n\n386\n00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,150\nSo here is just an upfront,\nyou purchase it,\n\n387\n00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,480\nit's not like it's an ongoing thing and\nthat's basically it.\n\n388\n00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,750\nAnd then we also just have\nour miscellaneous contracts.\n\n389\n00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,350\nOnes that don't really fit the mold\nof the other two categories right?\n\n390\n00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,200\nBut let's take a look at each of the ones\nthat are in here cuz I know these guys up\n\n391\n00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,220\nhere are really common on the exam.\n\n392\n00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,220\nSo we definitely want to make sure\nwe have a good grasp of those.\n\n393\n00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,410\nSo I'm talking about the actual cost,\nplus profit margin based.\n\n394\n00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,980\nThere's four different\nvarieties of this one,\n\n395\n00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,240\nthe first one is the cost plus fixed fee.\n\n396\n00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,080\nWith this one we tell the contractor,\nwhen you give us quotes you need to\n\n397\n00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,840\ngive us your actual cost for\nwhat its gonna take to do that work and\n\n398\n00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,570\nthen give me a fixed fee value for\nwhat I'm gonna pay you for profits, okay.\n\n399\n00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,490\nThe nice part about this contract is\nwe know what it's gonna cost, and\n\n400\n00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,430\nthere's no room for overage.\n\n401\n00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,710\nCuz we're not really\ntalking about time here.\n\n402\n00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,880\nIf the contractor gets it done early,\n\n403\n00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,380\nthen they technically make\na certain amount of money.\n\n404\n00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,080\nAnd if they get it done late,\nthey make the same amount of money.\n\n405\n00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,820\nSo the amount of money they make doesn't\nvary, whether they're on time or\n\n406\n00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,800\nbehind schedule.\n\n407\n00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,160\nBut if they're behind schedule, that means\nthey're having to put more hours in.\n\n408\n00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,480\nThey're profit starts to shrink because\ntheir labor costs are going up, but\n\n409\n00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,170\nthat's not our problem.\n\n410\n00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:22,790\nSo when we deal with that these fixed fee\ntype contracts they protect the buyer.\n\n411\n00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,820\nThey protect us,\nreaching out to a contractor.\n\n412\n00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,640\nSo contractors don't like these\nbecause if something goes wrong,\n\n413\n00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,370\nif there's something that's unexpected and\ntheir cost starts to go up,\n\n414\n00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,360\nit eats into their fixed fee profit.\n\n415\n00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,820\nTheir profit starts to\nwhittle down based on that.\n\n416\n00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,080\nThey're normally gonna move us off to one\nof the other type of models if possible.\n\n417\n00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,170\nWe have cost plus percentage of cost.\n\n418\n00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,920\nAnd this is probably one of the more\ncommon ones where they say,\n\n419\n00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,790\nall right we'll do this project for\nyou, here's what our costs are, and\n\n420\n00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,550\nthen we'll just charge 10% for profit.\n\n421\n00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,220\nOr 4%, or 15%, or whatever it is.\n\n422\n00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,580\nJust being upfront about\nwhat that profit is.\n\n423\n00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,030\nAnd if we add more work to the contract,\nif it ends up taking more the cost goes\n\n424\n00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,870\nup, their percentage ensures that\nthey're getting money on that.\n\n425\n00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,970\nAnd so this protects them also.\n\n426\n00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,280\nIt protects the contractor more\nthan it does us I suppose.\n\n427\n00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,950\nThere's a cost plus incentive fee.\n\n428\n00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,830\nAll right, here's an incentive\nthat we're adding on to say hey,\n\n429\n00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,250\nif you can get this done, at cost on time,\n\n430\n00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,440\non schedule, on budget then here's\nan incentive that we'll pay you.\n\n431\n00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,310\nThen that incentive is\nusually just a flat number.\n\n432\n00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,460\nAnd they work towards your goal.\n\n433\n00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,720\nWe can also balance that\nwith like an award.\n\n434\n00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,140\nCost plus award fee, all right?\n\n435\n00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,720\nNow the difference between incentive and\n\n436\n00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,980\naward, an award fee is normally\na fixed value, and that's it.\n\n437\n00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,830\nBut an incentive fee typically decreases\nas you get closer to being on time.\n\n438\n00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,190\nSo if you get done early,\nyou have an incentive for that, right?\n\n439\n00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,540\nAnd if you get done late, there's\na penalty coupling it, and they don't\n\n440\n00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,150\nmention that here, but you'll see cost\nplus incentive plus penalty sometimes.\n\n441\n00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:07,200\nSo, we have different ways of\nincentivizing people to get done early.\n\n442\n00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,620\nWith an award that's normally if you win\nthe contract you get this award fee and\n\n443\n00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,010\nthat's it, it doesn't really very,\nit can but it doesn't normally.\n\n444\n00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,830\nSo, those two are very similar.\n\n445\n00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,250\n>> Now in this one, when we start\ntalking about the idea of the contracts,\n\n446\n00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,010\nthe [INAUDIBLE] explicitly mentions\nreally two people in the contract right?\n\n447\n00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,230\nOne's called a buyer and\nthe other one is called the seller.\n\n448\n00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,940\nSo, in these particular contracts here,\nyou see that it's the seller at this\n\n449\n00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,550\npoint, that's actually responsible for\nthe risk.\n\n450\n00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,130\nIf he finishes early, that's fine.\n\n451\n00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,340\nBut if he doesn't,\n\n452\n00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,010\nhe's the one that actually ends\nup with less money at the end.\n\n453\n00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,020\nSo a lot a times, that's what you actually\ndo see in that terminology there.\n\n454\n00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,420\nBuyer and seller, don't forget that.\n\n455\n00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,750\n>> Yeah, every contract is looking\nat the interest of these two people,\n\n456\n00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,010\nof the buyer and seller.\n\n457\n00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,330\nAnd you'll see contracts that\nare sometimes very uneven.\n\n458\n00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,390\nRight that are completely\nprotecting one of the entities.\n\n459\n00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:01,620\nThose are not good contracts because the\nother party is really under the gun and\n\n460\n00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,260\nif anything goes wrong\nthey're left holding the bag.\n\n461\n00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:10,000\nSo the best contract is one that\nprotects both sides equally and\n\n462\n00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,669\nso trying to find that\nbalance is important.\n\n463\n00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,890\nAll right, so for those of you that\nworked with a third edition pimbock and\n\n464\n00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,360\nearlier, we didn't have the procurement\nprocess, we had the select seller process.\n\n465\n00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,880\nIt was actually called the seller process.\n\n466\n00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,450\nSo that changed,\ncuz it's not just dealing with sellers,\n\n467\n00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,649\nit's the buyer and the seller.\n\n468\n00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:34,170\nAll right we also have agreed price for\ncontracted product based.\n\n469\n00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,960\nThis is typically when\nwe're buying equipment.\n\n470\n00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,620\nWe're buying a tangible good, whether\nit's a sale, we're issued a receipt,\n\n471\n00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,240\nand it's done.\n\n472\n00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,440\nThere's not some ongoing thing.\n\n473\n00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,690\nThere might be warranty, or maintenance,\nsome kind of support agreement.\n\n474\n00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:52,430\nBut for the most part it's a one time,\nin and out charge.\n\n475\n00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,370\nSo these typically fall under what's\ncalled a fixed price contract.\n\n476\n00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,040\nRight?\nWe're gonna purchase this.\n\n477\n00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,390\nIt's gonna be a fixed price.\n\n478\n00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,200\nWe pay it.\n\n479\n00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,669\nAnd that's it.\n\n480\n00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:05,465\nBut there are variations based\non things that might occur.\n\n481\n00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:08,949\nThings like variable market environments.\n\n482\n00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,931\nWhether we pay In installments, right?\n\n483\n00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:15,416\nSo t might be a fixed price, but\nwe pay monthly for six months or\n\n484\n00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,450\nsomething like that a term agreement.\n\n485\n00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,710\nSo something like that\ncan have some variation.\n\n486\n00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,385\nSo instead, we might choose to go\nwith something like a lumped sum.\n\n487\n00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:31,135\nOr a lump sum agreement, which says we\npay it all up front and we're done.\n\n488\n00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:34,805\nWhen you go to the grocery store, you go\nup to that cash register, you have your\n\n489\n00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:38,325\ngallon of milk, your bread, and\nyour other items, and you pay them money.\n\n490\n00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:39,425\nThat's a lump sum payment.\n\n491\n00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:40,545\nYou pay it all up front.\n\n492\n00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,695\nThat's it and it's done.\n\n493\n00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:44,095\nThen you walk out with your groceries.\n\n494\n00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:47,220\nBut if you're a contractor and\nyou're building a house.\n\n495\n00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,450\nThe bank will put you on\nan installment kind of payment,\n\n496\n00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,400\nthey call it a disbursement payment.\n\n497\n00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,200\nAnd so, you'll get disbursements\nat certain milestones, and so\n\n498\n00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,240\nyou're getting that money as you go.\n\n499\n00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,900\nSo it is a fixed price, you know, what\nyou've agreed upon for that house, but\n\n500\n00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,208\nit's over time,\nlump sum it's all up front.\n\n501\n00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:06,772\nA firm-fixed price, all right,\n\n502\n00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:12,840\nfirm-fixed price is where we don't\nallow that agreed upon price to vary,\n\n503\n00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,730\nbased on stuff that's going on outside,\neconomic environment, things like that.\n\n504\n00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,520\nYou know here in Florida\nis a great example.\n\n505\n00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,860\nThe housing market in the United States\ntook a dive four or five years ago now?\n\n506\n00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,920\nA little while ago and it was bad.\n\n507\n00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,410\nA lot of banks went under.\n\n508\n00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:37,460\nA lot of construction companies\njust went belly up, right?\n\n509\n00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,320\nThere was a time before that,\nwhere it was actually just as bad, but\n\n510\n00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,770\nit didn't really make the news.\n\n511\n00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,000\nThere was one year when four\nhurricanes hit the state of Florida.\n\n512\n00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,530\nAnd that's pretty uncommon, we get usually\nat least one hurricane a year, but\n\n513\n00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,630\nwe had four in one year that all did\nlandfall ,all across the state of Florida.\n\n514\n00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,230\nWell after that, there was so\nmuch reconstruction going on,\n\n515\n00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,250\nthat it was hard to get wood.\n\n516\n00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,430\nAnd so the price of wood,\n\n517\n00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,630\nthe price of just like a two by four\nstud or whatever started going up.\n\n518\n00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,480\nSo all of the contractors,\n\n519\n00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,490\nall these people who were building houses\nwho had agreed upon prices for the house.\n\n520\n00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,130\nThat wood started costing more money.\n\n521\n00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,490\nStarted cutting into their profits that\neventually It caused two problems.\n\n522\n00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,980\nThere was demand issues.\n\n523\n00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,220\nThey couldn't get enough of the studs\nto be able to build the house, so\n\n524\n00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,500\nthey were going behind schedules.\n\n525\n00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,370\nAnd then their costs were going up,\nand they were running out of money.\n\n526\n00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,170\nAnd the banks were not giving\nthem their next disbursement,\n\n527\n00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,300\nbecause they hadn't hit their milestone.\n\n528\n00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,730\nAnd there were a lot of failed\nconstruction projects then.\n\n529\n00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,800\nSo we had that bout, then it was four or\n\n530\n00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,090\nfive years later that we had the housing\nmarket go under, and then, you know.\n\n531\n00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,180\nSo it's been rough for\nthe state of Florida.\n\n532\n00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,050\nBut that's one of the problems\nwith firm-fixed pricing.\n\n533\n00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,620\nAs a buyer, we like firm-fixed pricing,\n\n534\n00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,970\nbecause we know we're gonna pay one thing,\nand that's it no matter what happens.\n\n535\n00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,260\nBut the seller is left holding the risk.\n\n536\n00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,560\nNow it is a positive and a negative risk.\n\n537\n00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,930\nOn a negative side,\nthe price of materials could go up and\n\n538\n00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,290\nthen they're in real trouble.\n\n539\n00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,560\nOn a positive side, the price of materials\ncould come down, and now because we agreed\n\n540\n00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,360\non a firm fixed price, you know,\nthey get the entire benefit of that.\n\n541\n00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,170\nSo, this is pushing risk off to them.\n\n542\n00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,180\nAll right, and\nthen there's fixed price incentive fee.\n\n543\n00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,070\nSo we have a fixed price for\nwhat we're purchasing,\n\n544\n00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,350\nand then we have some kind of\nincentive fee attached to it.\n\n545\n00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,970\nYou’ll see this a lot of times with\ncompanies that do like referral programs,\n\n546\n00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,770\nand so you know,\n\n547\n00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,550\nyou pay for their service, and then as\nyou refer people you get incentives.\n\n548\n00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:42,140\nSo you see that kind of as a bonus\nattached to the purchase of that good.\n\n549\n00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,600\nYou see this in real estate a lot.\n\n550\n00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,180\nWhere you say, I need a warehouse, and\nI need it to be this many square feet,\n\n551\n00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,100\nI need it have great location, and\nhere's how much I want to pay for it .and\n\n552\n00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,210\nif you can find this for me, here's the\nincentive fee like the realtor's fee or\n\n553\n00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,770\nwhatever that we'll pay for that.\n\n554\n00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,650\nAnd they go out and find the perfect\nlocation for it, they buy it for\n\n555\n00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,440\nyou under your agreement.\n\n556\n00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,790\nAnd then you pay that incentive fee for\nthem finding it, like a finders fee.\n\n557\n00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,310\nThe other contract types\nare just miscellaneous,\n\n558\n00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,260\nthey don't really kind of\nfit the models up there.\n\n559\n00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,500\nSo you'll see like fixed price,\nwith economic price adjustments.\n\n560\n00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,740\nThis where it's a fixed price we agree\nupon, but we build in certain adjustments.\n\n561\n00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,300\n>> Right?\nLike inflation.\n\n562\n00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,610\nYeah, monitoring inflation is a great one.\n\n563\n00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,100\nCost of living for certain areas.\n\n564\n00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,650\n>> Yes.\n>> That might come into play.\n\n565\n00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,880\nStock market values.\n\n566\n00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,980\n>> Yes.\n>> Availability.\n\n567\n00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,620\nWe start to factor these into contract.\n\n568\n00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,435\nThese contracts are usually pretty\ncomplex, but they are around.\n\n569\n00:28:37,435 --> 00:28:41,280\nT&M, this is a really common one.\n\n570\n00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,150\nTime and materials, right?\n\n571\n00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,100\nWe enter into a contract with somebody to\nprovide a service or good or whatever.\n\n572\n00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,990\nAnd they bill us separately for\ntime and materials.\n\n573\n00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,030\nMaterials are usually at or near cost.\n\n574\n00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,800\nAnd then is their labor that's involved,\nand\n\n575\n00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,260\nthat's usually where\nthey make their money.\n\n576\n00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,430\nSo, I used to work for a company\na long time ago that sold servers.\n\n577\n00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,670\nAnd we would sell\nthe servers at near cost.\n\n578\n00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,980\nAnd then we would charge for installing\nthe servers and setting them up.\n\n579\n00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,630\nAnd so we would enter into time and\nmaterials contracts,where the servers,\n\n580\n00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,970\nwe would either sell them at or near cost,\nor people could buy them, themselves.\n\n581\n00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,850\nWe didn't really care\nwhere that came from, and\n\n582\n00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,410\nthen it was the time\nwhere we made our money.\n\n583\n00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,120\nMechanics are like this, right?\n\n584\n00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,170\nTime and materials, you pay for\nthe part to fix your car, and you pay for\n\n585\n00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,310\nthe mechanics time to do\nthe repair time and materials.\n\n586\n00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,780\n>> Right.\n>> And then you just have straight\n\n587\n00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,420\nup unit price.\n\n588\n00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,690\nRight?\nA unit price contract,\n\n589\n00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,040\nis where you enter into a contract to\nbuy something at a particular price, and\n\n590\n00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,730\nit's a unit price, meaning if you\nwant to buy more units down the road,\n\n591\n00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,900\nyou've already contracted\na price to pay it.\n\n592\n00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,080\nYou'll see this with, like,\nGSA accounts in the U.S.,\n\n593\n00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,650\nwhere companies will contract\nto the United States government\n\n594\n00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,570\nto make it where all of the governmental\nagencies can buy from this one vendor.\n\n595\n00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,160\nAnd they all get the same\nnegotiated price.\n\n596\n00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,890\nWe're not constantly renegotiating.\n\n597\n00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,780\nSo, if I need to buy 200 computers\nthis month, my price is already set.\n\n598\n00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,190\nIf I need to buy another 200 next month,\nmy price is already set.\n\n599\n00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,740\nAll right.\n\n600\n00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,650\nIt's nice because we don't have\nto go through negotiations.\n\n601\n00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,230\nIt's already agreed upon.\n\n602\n00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,080\nIt's not so nice in that the price\nof these things might vary, and\n\n603\n00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,800\nso I might not be getting the best deal.\n\n604\n00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,880\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe contract types that are out there.\n\n605\n00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,620\nWe definitely want to\nbe familiar with those.\n\n606\n00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,180\nWell, Ronnie, this is a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break so\n\n607\n00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,690\nlet's do that.\n\n608\n00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,490\n>> Right.\n>> Let's do that.\n\n609\n00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,480\nWe'll take a tv timeout.\n\n610\n00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,890\nAnd when we get back, we've got a little\nbit more to talk about on procurements,\n\n611\n00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,160\nand then we have our stakeholder\nmanagement to jump into.\n\n612\n00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,347\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n613\n00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:44,810\n[MUSIC]\n\n614\n00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,720\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n615\n00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,510\nSo, we took a look at some of the things\nas far as planning our procurements and\n\n616\n00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,560\nno we get to the real wallop on this one.\n\n617\n00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,240\nIn almost every process we've looked at,\nthere's been a ton of inputs,\n\n618\n00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,570\na handful of tools and techniques,\nand just like one or two outputs but\n\n619\n00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,870\nin the planned procurements process,\nthere's a lot of outputs.\n\n620\n00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,650\nWe generate a lot of information.\n\n621\n00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,520\nThe main thing that we're gonna\nbe generating are things like\n\n622\n00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,270\nthe actual contracts themselves, or\nat least, what contract we need.\n\n623\n00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,120\nCuz, we're not entering into the contract\nyet, we're still in the planning stage.\n\n624\n00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,420\nWe're planning for\nthe contracts that we need.\n\n625\n00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,130\nSo, the number one thing that we're\ngonna generate is this guy right here,\n\n626\n00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,110\nthe procurement statement of work.\n\n627\n00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,160\nIf I have an activity that says I need\ndrywall installed, and I decide I'm gonna\n\n628\n00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,135\ncontract that out, the contract is gonna\nhinge around what's called a sta- To work.\n\n629\n00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:40,755\nNow that term should sound familiar.\n\n630\n00:31:40,755 --> 00:31:44,475\nBecause way back at the beginning of our\nproject when we were in the initiation\n\n631\n00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:46,645\nphase, what did we do?\n\n632\n00:31:46,645 --> 00:31:49,965\nWe created a statement of work for\nour project.\n\n633\n00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:52,127\nWell, when we contract something out.\n\n634\n00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,657\nIt's like creating a subproject.\n\n635\n00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:58,732\nYou have to give them a charter, which is\nyour contract authorizing them to do work.\n\n636\n00:31:58,732 --> 00:32:00,966\nAnd you got to give\nthem a scope statement,\n\n637\n00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:04,082\nwhich is your requirements your budget and\nyour schedule.\n\n638\n00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:06,695\nThat's your statement of work for\nthat contract.\n\n639\n00:32:06,695 --> 00:32:09,944\nYou're telling them what you want done,\nwhen you want it done, and\n\n640\n00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:12,040\nhow much you'll pay to get it done.\n\n641\n00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,760\nAnd then they need to live up to that for\ntheir subproject to be successful.\n\n642\n00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,730\nSo we're really kicking off a whole\nnew project, and that's why we have so\n\n643\n00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,370\nmany outputs here, cuz it's so\nmuch information to get together.\n\n644\n00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,350\nThat procurement statement of work,\n\n645\n00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:31,680\nthe number one thing it needs to have is\na detailed, non-disputable explanation\n\n646\n00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,110\nof what you expect to be completed\nwhen that contract is terminated.\n\n647\n00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:40,645\nAll right, so it does need to\nbe very detailed, no room for\n\n648\n00:32:40,645 --> 00:32:42,795\ninterpretation and disagreement, right?\n\n649\n00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:47,219\nWe need to have that in place in that\nprocurement statement of work, all right.\n\n650\n00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:50,425\nNow if we already have\na procurement management plan,\n\n651\n00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:53,832\nthen we've probably been\nusing it all along.\n\n652\n00:32:53,832 --> 00:32:56,632\nAnd it will tell us how we\nshould be wording these,\n\n653\n00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:59,912\nand the process that we should go through,\nas far as getting attorneys involved and\n\n654\n00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:00,942\nall that good stuff.\n\n655\n00:33:00,942 --> 00:33:02,582\nBut, if we don't have\na procurement management plan,\n\n656\n00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,462\nthen that might be another\noutput that we have.\n\n657\n00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:07,582\nWe just went through this\nwhole process of figuring out\n\n658\n00:33:07,582 --> 00:33:11,892\nwhat was the best way to go and generate\nthese contracts, or whatever, and now we\n\n659\n00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:15,662\ncan reuse that in other projects, so\nwe create our procurement management plan.\n\n660\n00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,810\nSome of the other things,\nprocurement documents.\n\n661\n00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,600\nNow, what are those?\n\n662\n00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,335\nWell technically the procurement\nstatement of work is a document, but\n\n663\n00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:29,870\nwe're normally going to put that into\na contract itself, and this is something\n\n664\n00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:34,030\nthat as a project manager you're\nprobably not qualified to generate.\n\n665\n00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,540\nNow, I'm not saying that's always true,\nbut\n\n666\n00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,800\nusually a project manager\nis not qualified.\n\n667\n00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,320\nYou typically need an attorney, right?\n\n668\n00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,081\nSomebody who's trained in contract law to\ndraft up a legally binding contract for\n\n669\n00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,396\nwhat needs to be done.\n\n670\n00:33:46,396 --> 00:33:49,640\nNow if we're just purchasing goods from\nsomebody we don't need that right.\n\n671\n00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,180\nBut if we're laying out a contract for\n\n672\n00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,160\nwork to be performed, you want to make\nsure that's it's legally binding, and\n\n673\n00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,940\nit just takes a few mistakes in\nthe contract to invalidate it.\n\n674\n00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,500\nSo we need to make sure that\nit is done properly, so\n\n675\n00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,130\nthat is our procurement document.\n\n676\n00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,680\nSo pretty important thing there,\n\n677\n00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,170\nwhen we say procurement document\nwe're really meaning the contract.\n\n678\n00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,040\nAll right,\nsome of the other things that we have.\n\n679\n00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,080\nWell now we start to get into\nquite a bit of stuff here.\n\n680\n00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,720\nThe next one is probably\nthe one that looks small but\n\n681\n00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,970\nit's actually way bigger,\nsource selection criteria.\n\n682\n00:34:22,355 --> 00:34:24,610\nWe're coming up with work\nthat needs to be done.\n\n683\n00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,450\nWe know it needs to be done.\n\n684\n00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,120\nWe don't necessarily know\nwho's going to do it yet.\n\n685\n00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,000\nWe talk about make or buy decisions.\n\n686\n00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,340\nSo if we decide to make it,\n\n687\n00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,570\nif we're gonna do it ourselves,\nthen we don't necessarily need a contract.\n\n688\n00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,470\nWe are just going to do it ourselves,\nand we go, right.\n\n689\n00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:41,100\nAnd we document that with out make or buy\ndecision, how we've reached that decision.\n\n690\n00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,730\nBut, if we decided to go with a buy,\nwe're gonna buy this,\n\n691\n00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,160\nwe're gonna get somebody else\nto do the work for us, then\n\n692\n00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,270\nwe need to do a source selection to find\nout who it is that's gonna do the work.\n\n693\n00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:52,850\nALright.\n\n694\n00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,380\nSo through one means or another,\nwe're going to send out requests so\n\n695\n00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,730\nthat people can offer to do the work for\nus, right?\n\n696\n00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,120\nAnd then we need a way to pick\nwho that winner is going to be.\n\n697\n00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,358\nAnd that's what it's\ntalking about right here.\n\n698\n00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:08,370\nSource selection criteria is,\nhow do we pick the winner?\n\n699\n00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,030\nAnd this is something that should be\npart our procurement management plan.\n\n700\n00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,900\nHow do we select the winner of a contract,\nright?\n\n701\n00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,480\nWe're not necessarily drafting\nthe documents for this yet.\n\n702\n00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,090\nThis is kind of weird, because in the\nother planning phases we do draft these\n\n703\n00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,550\ndocuments, but for the procurement\ncycle it actually happens in execution,\n\n704\n00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,120\nthat's when we draft the documents.\n\n705\n00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,050\nBut I want to do a high level overview of\nsome of the documents right now, just so\n\n706\n00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,500\nwe're familiar with them, and\nthen we'll revisit them later.\n\n707\n00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,509\nAnd Rodney did a great job of\nfilling all of those in here.\n\n708\n00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,070\nSo when we talk about\nprocurement documents,\n\n709\n00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,850\nhere's an example of some of the different\nones that we might send out.\n\n710\n00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,720\nRequest for information.\n\n711\n00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,330\nRFIs are really handy when you\ndon't know what you need, right.\n\n712\n00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,075\nThese typically occur\nduring the planning phase,\n\n713\n00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:54,590\ncuz we're just trying to\nfigure out what's what.\n\n714\n00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:59,040\nSo I don't necessarily know what companies\nare able to deliver something that I need.\n\n715\n00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,570\nMaybe I need a very\nspecialized database developed.\n\n716\n00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,330\nI know a lot of contractors and\nconsultants out there, but\n\n717\n00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,610\nI don't know if they'll\ndo this specialized task.\n\n718\n00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,360\nSo I might draft up a letter\nthat says hey, we're looking for\n\n719\n00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,170\nsomebody who can develop a specialized\ndatabase that meets these needs,\n\n720\n00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,080\nis that something you're able to do?\n\n721\n00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,942\nAnd if you are, how would you go about it?\n\n722\n00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,350\nWhat is your solution to this?\n\n723\n00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,770\nWhat do you propose would be\nthe best way to handle this?\n\n724\n00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,380\nAnd then you send this out, this request\nfor information, and they reply back.\n\n725\n00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,320\nThey reply back with one, whether or\nnot they can even do the job, right.\n\n726\n00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,343\nThey might not be able to and say no,\n\n727\n00:36:32,343 --> 00:36:34,670\nthjat's kinda outside of what\nwe do we can't help you.\n\n728\n00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,390\nAnd then if they can help us then\nnumber two they tell us how.\n\n729\n00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,850\nThey say well for\nwhat you're talking about,\n\n730\n00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:45,890\nI would propose that we use a no\nSQL database hosted on Amazon S3,\n\n731\n00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,130\nor not S3, but Amazon what is\ntheir dynamic database called?\n\n732\n00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,600\nI think it's called anyhow.\n\n733\n00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,580\nSo you know hosted out there,\nthat would give us the best redundancy and\n\n734\n00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,960\nthat's what we propose.\n\n735\n00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,000\nThe other sellers might come in and\nhave different proposals.\n\n736\n00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,575\nAnd so we get to evaluate those and\nfigure it out.\n\n737\n00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:07,420\nRFIs are really handy when we just\ndon't know how to do something.\n\n738\n00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,520\nWe don't know what's necessary, very\ndifficult for us to draft up a document,\n\n739\n00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,650\nso we're trying to get\nmore information on it.\n\n740\n00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,070\nA request for proposal is similar.\n\n741\n00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:21,010\nA request for proposal, we know what needs\nto be done, we know who can do it, and\n\n742\n00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,250\nso we reach out to those people,\nwe say, can you give us a proposal?\n\n743\n00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,470\nWhat do you propose to do and how much\ndo you propose it's going to cost?\n\n744\n00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,980\nSo they're gonna give us different\nsolutions and what the cost would be.\n\n745\n00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,140\nBut if we already know the solution,\nI know exactly what I need.\n\n746\n00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:41,280\nI need dry wall installed in this house,\nI need it done this way to these specs\n\n747\n00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,820\nI don't want to hear about other\nproposals, I want it done this way.\n\n748\n00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,090\nIn that scenario, we just want\na request for quotation, an RFQ.\n\n749\n00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,610\nWe say, here's what I want done,\nhow much is it going to cost,\n\n750\n00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,080\ndon't deviate from this,\nI don't want to hear it.\n\n751\n00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,550\nAnd that's not an uncommon thing,\n\n752\n00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,220\nsometimes we want things done a particular\nway, so RFQs are very common.\n\n753\n00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,230\nSome of the other things that\nwe might have, things like,\n\n754\n00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,570\nthese become a little bit less common,\nlike tender notices.\n\n755\n00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,450\nWhere we talk about the tendering or\nthe providing of good.\n\n756\n00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,630\nYou know, we reach out and\nwe basically say,\n\n757\n00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,010\ncan you tell us if you're able to do this?\n\n758\n00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,790\nInvitation for negotiation, right?\n\n759\n00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,305\nWe don't know what it's going to cost,\nbut whatever you say,\n\n760\n00:38:22,305 --> 00:38:23,730\nwe're not gonna pay that.\n\n761\n00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,160\nSo why don't you come in and\nget into a negotiation with us.\n\n762\n00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,550\nTalk to us about what you can do.\n\n763\n00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,540\nWe will talk about what we want and\n\n764\n00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,360\nwe'll come up with some kind of\nagreement on what's provided.\n\n765\n00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,010\nAnd then invitation for\nsellers initial response.\n\n766\n00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,530\nWe reach out and we say, hey,\nwe're talking about this,\n\n767\n00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,080\nwe haven't really moved forward on it yet.\n\n768\n00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,510\nBut can you give us just some general\ndata, general information, your initial\n\n769\n00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,900\nresponse to this idea, might be a bad\nidea, you might tell us not to do it.\n\n770\n00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,570\nJust give us some information, right?\n\n771\n00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,210\nThose are not very common.\n\n772\n00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,570\nThese one, the ones up at the top here,\nthe ones that have nice initials,\n\n773\n00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:58,680\nRFI, IFB, RFP, RFQ, those are the ones\nthat normally make it on the exam.\n\n774\n00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,310\nBut these are some of\nthe documents you might generate.\n\n775\n00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,070\nNow we're not really generating\nthem now in the planning phase,\n\n776\n00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,120\nalthough you might generate\nthem at the same time.\n\n777\n00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,640\nIt's really in the execution phase that\nwe create these, we send them out,\n\n778\n00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,710\nwe get our responses.\n\n779\n00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,160\nNow you might ask yourself, if we don't\nknow how something's gonna get done and\n\n780\n00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,680\nwe're sending out a RFP.\n\n781\n00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,970\nSo we're asking people to\npropose ways to get it done.\n\n782\n00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,650\nIf I don't know how to get it done,\nI don't know how long it's gonna take.\n\n783\n00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,600\nI don't know how much it's gonna cost.\n\n784\n00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,450\nSo if I'm doing that in the execution\nphase, couldn't that affect my schedule,\n\n785\n00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,220\ncouldn't that effect my budget?\n\n786\n00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,590\nAbsolutely, right.\n\n787\n00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,540\nSo, these are some of the very first\nthings we do in the execution phase,\n\n788\n00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,000\nwhen we're going chronologically.\n\n789\n00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,060\nSo, it's something that we move into very\nrapidly, so that we can take account for\n\n790\n00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,150\nit before we kick off\nall of our other work.\n\n791\n00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,190\nMany people opt to go ahead and\ndo these in the planning phase.\n\n792\n00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,790\nI'm one of those.\n\n793\n00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,490\nI like to do them in the planning\nphase to get it done early.\n\n794\n00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,836\nBut, following the letter of the law,\nfollowing the PMBOK, in other words,\n\n795\n00:39:56,836 --> 00:40:02,602\non the exam, actually sending these out,\nis a part of the execution phase alright.\n\n796\n00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:05,980\nSo make you separate that in your mind,\nin real life you'll probably do this in\n\n797\n00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,650\nplanning, but on the exam it's\npart of the execution phase.\n\n798\n00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,927\nCuz you're actually doing work.\n\n799\n00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:12,247\nYou're doing work, you're filling out\nthese forms, you're sending them out,\n\n800\n00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:13,852\nyou're getting them back,\nyou're making decisions.\n\n801\n00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:16,920\nSo in the planning phase we're just\nplanning for how to handle these,\n\n802\n00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,330\nhow we're gonna handle picking who\nthe winning proposal is, right.\n\n803\n00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,400\nSo we need to come up with those criteria,\nand\n\n804\n00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,920\nthat's what leads us to our next output\nwhich is the source selection criteria.\n\n805\n00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,590\nAnd there's a ton of stuff there.\n\n806\n00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:33,290\nHow do we pick who the winner is\ngoing to be, when all these people\n\n807\n00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,600\npose the work that they are going to do,\nhow do I pick the winner?\n\n808\n00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,830\nWell, it can be as simple as cost.\n\n809\n00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,950\nMaybe I'm in that mode where I just\nwant whoever is cheapest, that's it.\n\n810\n00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,610\nBut that's not normally\nthe right way to go.\n\n811\n00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,840\nNormally, we're looking at other things.\n\n812\n00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,550\nWe're looking at things like\nthe overall or life cycle cost.\n\n813\n00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,000\nNot just the upfront cost but\n\n814\n00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000\nhow much it's going to cost to\nmaintain whatever this solution is.\n\n815\n00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,730\nWe're looking at the technical capability.\n\n816\n00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,600\nThere might be five different web\ndevelopers out there and the cheapest one\n\n817\n00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,320\nmight be a kid out of high school who\njust doesn't have a lot of experience.\n\n818\n00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,880\nThe most expensive one might be one\nthat's been in the field for 20 years.\n\n819\n00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,900\nHas a phD and is more expensive,\nbut has the knowledge and\n\n820\n00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,290\nbackground to warrant it.\n\n821\n00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,520\nWe might go the more expensive one because\nthat technical capability results in\n\n822\n00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,360\nsomething getting done faster and\nbeing more scalable.\n\n823\n00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,430\nSo, that has to come into play, too.\n\n824\n00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,860\nWe've got to weigh all\nthe different criteria.\n\n825\n00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,630\nThe risk, when we contract something\nout there's always risk, you know?\n\n826\n00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,820\nThat company could fold,\nyou just don't know.\n\n827\n00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,030\nSo, we have to take that into account\nas we pick our different sellers.\n\n828\n00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:47,290\nI think I gave an example of our disaster\nrecovery project out in Seattle.\n\n829\n00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:51,460\nWhen we moved our disaster recovery center\nwe had to find a new data center to host\n\n830\n00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,820\nit in, and I had selected a data\ncenter that was run by AT&T.\n\n831\n00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,200\nIt was in Denver, Colorado.\n\n832\n00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,200\nIt was a massive data center and it was\nrun by one of the largest telecoms in\n\n833\n00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,880\nthe United States, really one of\nthe largest telecoms in the world.\n\n834\n00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,750\nI knew these people knew their stuff,\nright?\n\n835\n00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,220\nBecause they were of a global scale.\n\n836\n00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,140\nThey had the services we need.\n\n837\n00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,220\nI prefered them, right?\n\n838\n00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,090\nUltimately we didn't pick them.\n\n839\n00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:22,110\nWe chose to go with another provider\nthat was in Spokane, Washington.\n\n840\n00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,230\nIt was very small.\n\n841\n00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,560\nThey had maybe 20, 30 employees.\n\n842\n00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,950\nIt was a fairly small environment.\n\n843\n00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,320\nThey had a very nice data center,\nstate of the art data center.\n\n844\n00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,940\nBut it was very small.\n\n845\n00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,560\nThey just had Spokane and that was it.\n\n846\n00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,200\nAll right, so\nwe opted to go with them because our CIO,\n\n847\n00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,000\nour Chief Information Officer,\nwhen he built his requirements, he said,\n\n848\n00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,630\nhe would rather deal with a small\ncompany that knew us personally,\n\n849\n00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,590\nthat we could reach out and call,\nand we could build a rapport with.\n\n850\n00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,280\nThat appreciated us as a customer,\n\n851\n00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,970\nthan deal with a massive conglomerate\nwho didn't care about us at all, right?\n\n852\n00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:58,880\nThat was important to him and\nthat criteria was more significant than\n\n853\n00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,410\nthe criteria of having a global level data\ncenter which to me was more important.\n\n854\n00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,660\nSo, different people,\nhave different criteria, different things.\n\n855\n00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,100\nAnd so we've got to catalog that.\n\n856\n00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,130\nAnd so risk,\nour CIO was willing to take the risk\n\n857\n00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,300\nof a small company because he\nfelt we'd get better service.\n\n858\n00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,720\nThe trade off was there.\n\n859\n00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,580\nVersus me, I was willing to deal with\na large entity that would probably ignore\n\n860\n00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,200\nus, because I knew they had\na strong infrastructure and\n\n861\n00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,050\nI knew they were stable.\n\n862\n00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,640\nThere were less risks.\n\n863\n00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,320\nSo that is something that comes into play.\n\n864\n00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,060\nWell I kind of tied into this next one,\nmanagement approach.\n\n865\n00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,350\nHow does our management choose\nto handle these contracts.\n\n866\n00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,400\nThe technical approach,\n\n867\n00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,110\nagain I kind of tied into that too,\nthe technical approach.\n\n868\n00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,890\nSo what is technically required of\nthe contract to be carried out.\n\n869\n00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,340\nAnd who's gonna provide the best support.\n\n870\n00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,717\nWarranty, right, whatever we contract out,\nsomeone's coming in and doing work.\n\n871\n00:43:50,717 --> 00:43:54,895\nThey're not us, they don't work for\nus full time so when the contract's over,\n\n872\n00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:56,365\ndo they care about us anymore?\n\n873\n00:43:56,365 --> 00:43:58,825\nProbably not, they move on and that's it.\n\n874\n00:43:58,825 --> 00:44:01,775\nWe got rain gutters put on our\nhouse a few months ago, and so\n\n875\n00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:04,280\nwe paid some guys to come out and\nput the rain gutters up.\n\n876\n00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,140\nIt was a contract job,\nit took him one day.\n\n877\n00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,130\nThey came in knocked it out,\ndid a great job.\n\n878\n00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:08,790\nAlright.\n\n879\n00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,093\nI can guarantee you today,\nthey don't remember my name,\n\n880\n00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:12,460\nthey don't remember my address.\n\n881\n00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,170\nThey have already installed\na thousand rain gutters since then.\n\n882\n00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:15,890\nRight?\n\n883\n00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:19,040\nAnd if those rain gutters\nfall off my house.\n\n884\n00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,620\nWho deals with that, all right?\n\n885\n00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,870\nWell, mine came with I think it\nwas like a five year warranty.\n\n886\n00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,970\nSo if I've got five years where they'll\nbe you know they'll come out and\n\n887\n00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:27,890\nthey'll fix it.\n\n888\n00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,860\nSo different contractors have\ndifferent warranty times.\n\n889\n00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,250\nSome don't have any warranty at all.\n\n890\n00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,230\nThey do the work and that's it.\n\n891\n00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,620\nNo liability.\n\n892\n00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,420\nSo we need to make sure that\nwe understand that as we pick\n\n893\n00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,840\nwho our winner is going to be.\n\n894\n00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,460\nFinancial capacity,\nthis is a big one that we bump into an IT.\n\n895\n00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,996\nIf your contracting somebody\nto install 400 servers, and\n\n896\n00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:53,290\nyou wanna buy 400 servers, they've got to\nbuy the servers and then sell them to you.\n\n897\n00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:56,790\nAnd if they're doing like net 60 terms,\nyou may not pay them for two months.\n\n898\n00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:02,190\nSo that means that they need to have\nthe cash on hand to buy 400 servers and\n\n899\n00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,520\nsit on it for two months.\n\n900\n00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,320\nRight?\n\n901\n00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,910\nNot every company can do that.\n\n902\n00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:09,410\nSo going with larger companies\nwill allow you to do net 60,\n\n903\n00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,770\ndealing with smaller companies,\nyou might need to do, pay in advance.\n\n904\n00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:13,820\nRight.\nSo\n\n905\n00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,319\nthat is a criteria if that's\nan important thing to you.\n\n906\n00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,190\nProduction capacity and interest.\n\n907\n00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,541\nBoy we bumped into that with ITPRO.tv.\n\n908\n00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:25,170\nITPRO.tv when we opened we started,\n\n909\n00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:29,560\nour servers were hosted by a company\nthat specialized in WordPress.\n\n910\n00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,800\nThe underlying infrastructure of our site,\nand\n\n911\n00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,260\nthey said we can scale to\nwhatever size you need.\n\n912\n00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:35,960\nAll right?\n\n913\n00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,130\nWell it turns out they couldn't.\n\n914\n00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,870\nThey just didn't have the capacity,\n\n915\n00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,610\nthey underestimated our\ngrowth in our user base.\n\n916\n00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,750\nWe warned them, we said hey, we've got\ntechnical users, they're gonna connect and\n\n917\n00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,600\nthey're gonna play videos.\n\n918\n00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,360\nThey're gonna be in there a lot.\n\n919\n00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,570\nWe're not some website where they log\nin to read an article once a week.\n\n920\n00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,500\nYou know,\nthey're going to be watching videos.\n\n921\n00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,700\nWe need the resources, and\nthey couldn't handle it.\n\n922\n00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,970\nSo we ended up having to move.\n\n923\n00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:03,230\nSo that's something that we need to pay\nattention to is thier production capacity.\n\n924\n00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,000\nIn this case they guarantee us\na certain production level, and\n\n925\n00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,230\nthey weren't able to meet their guarantee,\nso we didn't have an liability.\n\n926\n00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,500\nWe were able to move\naway without any issue.\n\n927\n00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,810\nBut, was it an inconvenience?\n\n928\n00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:15,400\nAbsolutely.\n\n929\n00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,040\nI remember there were three days where I\nwas pulling my hair out as we switched\n\n930\n00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,670\nproviders, so that is something\nthat we want to try and identify.\n\n931\n00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,190\nBusiness size and type.\n\n932\n00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,550\nWhen you are contracting to someone else,\nthere are numerous business types,\n\n933\n00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,960\nthere's numerous corporation types.\n\n934\n00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,810\nLimited liability corporations,\nS Corps and so on.\n\n935\n00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:39,520\nAnd each one is a different characteristic\nof how that company is responsible for\n\n936\n00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,210\ntheir debts, contracts and\nother obligations.\n\n937\n00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:47,700\nWe need to make sure we pick ones\nthat we're safe doing business with.\n\n938\n00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,420\nI've used construction as\nan example throughout the show.\n\n939\n00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,490\nIn the state of Florida,\nif you use a contractor in construction,\n\n940\n00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,500\nthey need to be licensed and bonded.\n\n941\n00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,710\nThey need to have insurance, right?\n\n942\n00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,610\nNot all of them do.\n\n943\n00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,900\nSo the business size and type,\nthat really comes into play as to\n\n944\n00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:06,720\nhow well they are going to survive\nmarket pitfalls and things like that.\n\n945\n00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,850\nAll right.\n\n946\n00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,020\nPast performance is one\nthat I really like.\n\n947\n00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,073\nWhen you have people sending in requests\nfor, or when they're sending in bids or\n\n948\n00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:17,150\nproposals, they need to\ninclude some references.\n\n949\n00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,950\nI want to hear from their past customers.\n\n950\n00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,950\nAre other people having good\nexperiences with them or not?\n\n951\n00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,310\nI almost bought a new digital video\nrecorder, a DVR, the other day.\n\n952\n00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,610\nRonnie, have you heard of Simple TV?\n\n953\n00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:28,660\n>> I have.\n\n954\n00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,120\n>> Simple TV,\nyou see these commercials for it.\n\n955\n00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,560\nIt looks really cool.\n\n956\n00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,440\nIt's a DVR and\nit'll stream to your phone and stuff.\n\n957\n00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,380\nIf you go into their forums and\n\n958\n00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,550\nlook at their forums, their support\nforums, it's like one giant nightmare.\n\n959\n00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,240\nAnd they don't respond.\n\n960\n00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,850\nThey do a quick response and\nsay we're looking into the issue and\n\n961\n00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:48,050\nthen they abandon it.\n\n962\n00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,870\nAnd so there are tons of people\nhaving problems with the device.\n\n963\n00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,800\nI wouldn't know that from the commercial.\n\n964\n00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,280\nBut I read those forums and now I know.\n\n965\n00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,605\nI looked at their past performance and\ntheir past performance is not good, so\n\n966\n00:47:57,605 --> 00:47:58,894\nnot a great device to go with.\n\n967\n00:47:58,894 --> 00:48:02,039\nThat might change down the road but\nI'm not gonna put up with that now.\n\n968\n00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,399\nSo I'm glad I did that.\n\n969\n00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:05,279\nWe do that with simple transactions.\n\n970\n00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:06,778\nYou go on Amazon and you read the reviews.\n\n971\n00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:07,833\nThere's that kind of thing.\n\n972\n00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:10,213\nWhen you deal with a contractor,\nread their reviews.\n\n973\n00:48:10,213 --> 00:48:13,560\nThey're not posted on Yelp or\nanything, but ask for references,\n\n974\n00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,430\nget some of their previous clients.\n\n975\n00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,170\nFind other people that have used them\nto see what kind of work they do,\n\n976\n00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,404\nwhich is references.\n\n977\n00:48:20,404 --> 00:48:22,890\nSo the references,\nthey're what's going to feed that to you.\n\n978\n00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,472\nIntellectual property rights.\n\n979\n00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:28,625\nAll right, now, if you're building\na house, you may not, well actually,\n\n980\n00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,337\nthey care about it too cuz you have plans.\n\n981\n00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:32,930\nYou have blueprints for the house and\nthat's intellectual property.\n\n982\n00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:36,141\nIn IT, if I have a contractor\nwork on our website,\n\n983\n00:48:36,141 --> 00:48:39,437\nthey could download copies\nof all of our episodes.\n\n984\n00:48:39,437 --> 00:48:42,450\nAnd then they could turn around and\ndo all sorts of crazy things with them.\n\n985\n00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:46,740\nSo any contract that we enter into\nwe have a clause in there that says,\n\n986\n00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,040\nall of our content, our videos, our HTML,\n\n987\n00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:55,880\nall that content is the property of\nour parent company, EdutainmentLIVE.\n\n988\n00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,650\nSo it's part of EdutainmentLIVE,\nand you're not allowed to use it.\n\n989\n00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,640\nYou can work with it while\nthe contract is active, but\n\n990\n00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,730\nwhen the contract is over,\nyou relinquish all materials.\n\n991\n00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,520\nYou turn everything back in to us.\n\n992\n00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,330\nYou have no ongoing rights to that.\n\n993\n00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:08,940\nThat's important.\n\n994\n00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,110\nAnd then proprietary rights.\n\n995\n00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:16,170\nIf you are dealing with copyrighted\nthings, patented things,\n\n996\n00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,740\nthat just because a contractor comes and\ndoes work for you,\n\n997\n00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:24,210\nthat doesn't give them a license right\nto use that patented material long term.\n\n998\n00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,870\nSo again they need to know\nthere is no extended benefits.\n\n999\n00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,790\nThese are things that are important.\n\n1000\n00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:33,520\nWe need to make sure that works for\nour material going to them and for\n\n1001\n00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,480\ntheir material to come to us.\n\n1002\n00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,593\nIf the seller comes in and does something\nusing their own proprietary technology,\n\n1003\n00:49:40,593 --> 00:49:43,815\nthey do have to give us\nlicense to continue using it.\n\n1004\n00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:47,460\nOtherwise when the contract is over,\nwe lose the work they did.\n\n1005\n00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,290\nYeah, yep,\n\n1006\n00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:53,030\nso these are all things that we need to be\naware of with source selection criteria.\n\n1007\n00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:57,061\nSo, what we're drafting right here is\nnot necessarily here's the criteria.\n\n1008\n00:49:57,061 --> 00:50:01,202\nWhat we're doing is we're putting\nthis in our project management plan,\n\n1009\n00:50:01,202 --> 00:50:05,007\nin our procurement plan to say\nhere's the criteria that we look at,\n\n1010\n00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:07,570\nthat we classify when\nwe make that decision.\n\n1011\n00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,820\nIt might be all of these,\nit might be half of these.\n\n1012\n00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,200\nWe pick and choose the ones that we want.\n\n1013\n00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:18,210\nAll right, so once we've got all that,\nthe only other things that we've got,\n\n1014\n00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,420\nproject document updates.\n\n1015\n00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,100\nWe update our plans and\nother things, and change requests.\n\n1016\n00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,220\nNow this is the first time\nwe've seen change requests,\n\n1017\n00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,510\nand we're gonna do a whole show\non change management later on\n\n1018\n00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:31,800\nbecause we're finding out\ninformation about these contracts.\n\n1019\n00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,220\nWe might do some RFIs,\nlearn some information.\n\n1020\n00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,210\nOdds are things in our\nproject are going to change.\n\n1021\n00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,940\nOur schedule might have to change, our\nbudget might have to change, and so on.\n\n1022\n00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,070\nSo, this is the first time that we're\ngoing to see change requests be generated.\n\n1023\n00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:50,360\nWe need to go and modify our other\ndocuments to reflect what we just learned.\n\n1024\n00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,356\nAnd at a minimum we're\nupdating resource names.\n\n1025\n00:50:52,356 --> 00:50:54,910\nSo where I had web developer one,\ntwo, and three,\n\n1026\n00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:59,470\nI might now have external company\nA that we're contracting that out to.\n\n1027\n00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,104\nThey're gonna come and provide that labor.\n\n1028\n00:51:01,104 --> 00:51:06,128\nSo these are our changes that'll\nhave to go in to update our project.\n\n1029\n00:51:06,128 --> 00:51:10,261\nAll right, so that's really all that's\ninvolved in procurement management.\n\n1030\n00:51:10,261 --> 00:51:13,260\nIt's pretty light here,\nwe just kind of talk about the concepts.\n\n1031\n00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,654\nWhen we get in the execution phase, I'll\nshow you guys some examples of RFQs and\n\n1032\n00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:21,607\nstuff, and so we'll get a chance to\nsee how that actually carries out.\n\n1033\n00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:24,740\nAll right, so,\nyou know what Ronnie let's do this.\n\n1034\n00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,630\nLet's stop here and take a little break.\n\n1035\n00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,740\nWe have stakeholder management left.\n\n1036\n00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,300\nThat's our last one, and\nstakeholder management very,\n\n1037\n00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,210\nvery short not a whole\nheck of a lot there.\n\n1038\n00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,324\nBut let's stop and take a brief break.\n\n1039\n00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:37,453\nWhen we get back, we'll knock\nout stakeholder management, and\n\n1040\n00:51:37,453 --> 00:51:38,778\nthen we'll wrap up the show from there.\n\n1041\n00:51:38,778 --> 00:51:39,778\nSound good?\n\n1042\n00:51:39,778 --> 00:51:40,844\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1043\n00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:41,430\n>> All right, so, ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n1044\n00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,448\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n1045\n00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:49,249\n[MUSIC]\n\n1046\n00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:51,390\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n1047\n00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:55,190\nSo the last process in our planning phase,\n\n1048\n00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,530\nis the plan stakeholder\nmanagement process.\n\n1049\n00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:00,460\nAnd it, fortunately,\nis one of the smallest ones\n\n1050\n00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,820\ncuz we've kind of been dealing with\nour stakeholders all throughout.\n\n1051\n00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:07,920\nYeah, we already did a lot of the work in\nthe initiation phase as we came up with\n\n1052\n00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,210\nour stakeholder list.\n\n1053\n00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,450\nAnd we've revised that\nin our planning phases.\n\n1054\n00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,650\nWe've started building up\nour stakeholder registers.\n\n1055\n00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,170\nWe've seen that register\nseveral times now.\n\n1056\n00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,771\nSo here, we're just saying, all right,\n\n1057\n00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:21,531\nlet's finish up that\nregister if we need to.\n\n1058\n00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:25,056\nAnd then let's come up with our\nstakeholder management plan if we don't\n\n1059\n00:52:25,056 --> 00:52:26,340\nalready have one.\n\n1060\n00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,670\nAnd that management plan is just\nhow we keep our project up to date,\n\n1061\n00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,710\nhow we add and remove stakeholders,\nand that kind of information.\n\n1062\n00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,270\nThe input here is pretty straightforward,\nthat stakeholder register,\n\n1063\n00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,410\nwhich is where we've already done\nour work, that's the main input.\n\n1064\n00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,030\nIf you've got a project management plan,\n\n1065\n00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,140\nyou bring that in too because\nthat'll tell you how to do this.\n\n1066\n00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,880\nYour enterprise environmental factors and\n\n1067\n00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,260\norganizational process assets\nlike we're used to seeing, right?\n\n1068\n00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,550\nThose are all of our inputs\non this particular process.\n\n1069\n00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,220\nTools and techniques are very light.\n\n1070\n00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,460\nExpert judgement, right,\nyou've got to use your noodle.\n\n1071\n00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,240\nAnd meetings, get people\ntogether to talk about it, right?\n\n1072\n00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,870\nThose are pretty common sense.\n\n1073\n00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,240\nBut the third one is\nanalytical techniques.\n\n1074\n00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,760\nThis is ways that we can break\n\n1075\n00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,960\ndown our stakeholders to figure\nout how to address them.\n\n1076\n00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,832\nAnd there's a few techniques called\nout specifically in the PMBOK.\n\n1077\n00:53:10,832 --> 00:53:11,770\nThere's five, all right.\n\n1078\n00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:17,060\nThe first one is, all right,\nthey are not techniques.\n\n1079\n00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,033\nThere's five different descriptions,\ncategories, or\n\n1080\n00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:24,680\nwhatever that we apply\nto our stakeholders.\n\n1081\n00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,220\nSo you'll see here unaware, resistant,\nneutral, supportive, leading.\n\n1082\n00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,500\nEach stakeholder has a different\nrole within our project.\n\n1083\n00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,580\nAnd we talked about this back in\nthe initiating phase where we said,\n\n1084\n00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,800\nI don't know why I pronounced that weird,\nbut the initiating phase.\n\n1085\n00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,770\nWhere we said that different people\nmay want to help your project,\n\n1086\n00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,120\nsome people might want\nto hurt your project.\n\n1087\n00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,520\nSome people might be ambivalent, but\n\n1088\n00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,320\nare just attached to the project\nthrough some tangent or whatever.\n\n1089\n00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,260\nAnd so that's what these are saying.\n\n1090\n00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,490\nBasically unaware,\nthat's one you don't want to have.\n\n1091\n00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:01,810\nThat means you don't know how that\nperson is going to affect your project.\n\n1092\n00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:04,010\nYou don't know if they support it,\nthey don't support it.\n\n1093\n00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:07,985\nOn day one all of your\nstakeholders are kind of unaware.\n\n1094\n00:54:07,985 --> 00:54:10,405\nWe don't know exactly how\nthey are going to affect us.\n\n1095\n00:54:10,405 --> 00:54:12,555\nWe need to find out, all right.\n\n1096\n00:54:12,555 --> 00:54:17,665\nAfter that, we have really resistant,\nneutral, and supportive, okay.\n\n1097\n00:54:17,665 --> 00:54:20,665\nResistant, this is someone that\nis aware of your project but\n\n1098\n00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:22,345\ndoesn't necessary support it.\n\n1099\n00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:27,295\nMaybe they, it's change they don't want,\nor they think the project is a bad idea.\n\n1100\n00:54:27,295 --> 00:54:28,735\nSo they don't want it to happen.\n\n1101\n00:54:28,735 --> 00:54:31,490\nThese are people that\nare not going to help you.\n\n1102\n00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,970\nAnd so we need to understand\nwho those people are so\n\n1103\n00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,150\nthat we can properly address that.\n\n1104\n00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,100\nNeutral, these are people that\nare attached to your project through\n\n1105\n00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,260\none means or another but aren't\nnecessarily contingent on the outcome.\n\n1106\n00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,590\nThey don't care if it succeeds or fails.\n\n1107\n00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:49,757\nThat's fine, as long as we know that\nthey're properly doing their work.\n\n1108\n00:54:49,757 --> 00:54:53,073\nThese are typically people that need to\nbe monitored a little more just to ensure\n\n1109\n00:54:53,073 --> 00:54:57,260\nthe work is getting done cuz they don't\nhave a vested interest in the project.\n\n1110\n00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,040\nSupportive, these are the people\nwho are gonna help you the most.\n\n1111\n00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,753\nThese are the people who want\nthis project to succeed.\n\n1112\n00:55:02,753 --> 00:55:05,776\nThey have a vested interest\nin the success of it, and so\n\n1113\n00:55:05,776 --> 00:55:09,150\nwe can rely upon them to be able\nto move that project forward.\n\n1114\n00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,365\nLeading, this is gonna be your\nentire project management team,\n\n1115\n00:55:14,365 --> 00:55:19,100\nright, as well as any other people like\nsponsors who are key stakeholders.\n\n1116\n00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,700\nThey don't just want this project to\nsucceed, they're ready to get involved and\n\n1117\n00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,150\ndrag others along with them\nto ensure that it succeeds.\n\n1118\n00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,910\nAnd you're gonna need somebody leading\nto overcome anybody who's resistant.\n\n1119\n00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:34,460\nYou might have somebody who\ndoesn't like your project.\n\n1120\n00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,120\nBut if the CIO comes over and says,\nlook you're gonna help out or\n\n1121\n00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,970\nyour fired, all the sudden\nthey become supportive, right.\n\n1122\n00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,818\nThat's all it takes is that authority.\n\n1123\n00:55:42,818 --> 00:55:49,130\nSo the stakeholders who are supportive,\n\n1124\n00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:53,600\nwho are leading, they're the ones that\nare really gonna drive this project along.\n\n1125\n00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,580\nSo we just identify that.\n\n1126\n00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:59,610\nAnd we've kind of already done it, because\nwe saw it in our stakeholder register.\n\n1127\n00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,026\nBut, what we'll do is we'll draft this up.\n\n1128\n00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,824\nWe'll update our register with\nany information that we gain.\n\n1129\n00:56:04,824 --> 00:56:08,561\nAnd we'll draft our\nstakeholder management plan.\n\n1130\n00:56:08,561 --> 00:56:10,690\nNow I've got a stakeholder\nmanagement plan template.\n\n1131\n00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,620\nI just kinda wanna show you some\nof the things that go in there.\n\n1132\n00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,980\nBut we've got our stake holder, and you'll\nsee where we're flagging them as being\n\n1133\n00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,480\nunaware, resistant, neutral supportive,\nor leading, all right.\n\n1134\n00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,685\nAnd then we flag them with\na current level of engagement and\n\n1135\n00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:25,320\na desired level of engagement.\n\n1136\n00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,990\nSo, where they are now,\neverybody starts at unaware.\n\n1137\n00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,990\nAnd then as we engage them, we start\nto categorize them with where they are.\n\n1138\n00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,770\nSo we put their current level and\ntheir desire, where we want to get them.\n\n1139\n00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:40,870\nThen our communications, and we saw this\nin the communications management plan, but\n\n1140\n00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,640\nhow we're gonna communicate out to\nthese people, what methods or mediums,\n\n1141\n00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,410\nwhat timing and frequencies.\n\n1142\n00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:49,380\nWhen you see overlap like this between the\ntwo plans, does that mean we do it twice?\n\n1143\n00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,370\nNo, we pick which one we want.\n\n1144\n00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:55,180\nI know many organizations just\nskip this whole knowledge area,\n\n1145\n00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,350\nthe stakeholder management,\n\n1146\n00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:01,450\nbecause it doesn't necessarily affect the\nwhole project, but we see overlap here.\n\n1147\n00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:06,500\nPending stakeholder changes, f we have\nstakeholders that are coming in or\n\n1148\n00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,980\ngoing out, we identify that here.\n\n1149\n00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:13,370\nIf this is our plan, we just specify the\nmethod that these people come in and out.\n\n1150\n00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:16,020\nCan just anybody become\na stakeholder if they want to?\n\n1151\n00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,930\nIs there a form they have to fill out?\n\n1152\n00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,730\nOr does the project manager determine\nwho's going to be a stakeholder?\n\n1153\n00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,290\nHow do we do that, right?\n\n1154\n00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:24,804\nIf this is actually becoming\na part of our individual project,\n\n1155\n00:57:24,804 --> 00:57:28,700\nwe'll put individual people who's\ngonna come on at what time.\n\n1156\n00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,560\nMaybe they're not a stakeholder now, but\nthey will be two months from now, and so\n\n1157\n00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,100\nwe put that in.\n\n1158\n00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,020\nStakeholder relationships.\n\n1159\n00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,680\nOftentimes one stakeholder will\nbe linked to another somehow,\n\n1160\n00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,310\neither as a functional manager,\nor maybe just as a close friend.\n\n1161\n00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:46,100\nAnd so you know that when one makes\na decision, the other is likely to follow.\n\n1162\n00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,449\nIt's good to understand those connections.\n\n1163\n00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:53,560\nAnd then lastly,\nour stakeholder engagement approach.\n\n1164\n00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,410\nHow are we going to be reaching out\nto these people and handling them?\n\n1165\n00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:00,570\nSo if I have somebody who is\nnot supportive of my project,\n\n1166\n00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,710\nthey're resistant,\nhow do I approach them, right?\n\n1167\n00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:05,930\nMaybe I never approach them directly.\n\n1168\n00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,930\nBut instead, I always approach them\nthrough their functional manager.\n\n1169\n00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:13,580\nMaybe I'll just say, look, this person\nis outwardly hostile to my project.\n\n1170\n00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,760\nSo I will always deal with\ntheir functional manager.\n\n1171\n00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,815\nOr we say, our approach is going\nto be to go and replace them.\n\n1172\n00:58:19,815 --> 00:58:22,525\nWe need to get them off of this\nproject as soon as we can, and\n\n1173\n00:58:22,525 --> 00:58:24,645\nreplace them with somebody\nwho is supportive, right?\n\n1174\n00:58:24,645 --> 00:58:26,565\nNo sense dragging along dead weight.\n\n1175\n00:58:26,565 --> 00:58:30,355\nSo those are some of the things that\nwe can identify in our stakeholder\n\n1176\n00:58:30,355 --> 00:58:31,210\nmanagement plan.\n\n1177\n00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,582\nWe put that information in there,\nand we've got it.\n\n1178\n00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:35,752\nNow, I've mentioned a lot of\ncompanies don't do this, and\n\n1179\n00:58:35,752 --> 00:58:39,952\nthe reason is employees don't like\nto be categorized as resistant.\n\n1180\n00:58:39,952 --> 00:58:44,042\nEmployees don't like to be categorized\nas having an approach to handling them.\n\n1181\n00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:45,820\nPeople don't like this stuff.\n\n1182\n00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,610\nAnd so as a result,\ndoing it might hurt some feelings,\n\n1183\n00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:50,620\nmight get some people angry.\n\n1184\n00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,720\nAnd so many organizations just\ndon't create a document like this.\n\n1185\n00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,112\nBut with the PMI the frame work is there.\n\n1186\n00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:59,710\nIf you want, you've got the tools,\nyou can use it.\n\n1187\n00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,280\nIf you don't, you leave it out.\n\n1188\n00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,130\nBut on the exam, it exists,\nyou need to be aware of it, and\n\n1189\n00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:06,100\nit is something you definitely can use.\n\n1190\n00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,970\n>> Yeah, this is also where a lot of\ntimes, we had mentioned a term earlier.\n\n1191\n00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:10,926\nI think maybe in the first episode we\nwere talking about a project champion\n\n1192\n00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:11,838\nreally coming in, and actually being\nkind of the coach to everyone.\n\n1193\n00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:14,819\nEven those people that are again,\nunaware or resistant may come over if\n\n1194\n00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:18,061\nyou actually have the right communication\nplan in method, or in place here.\n\n1195\n00:59:18,061 --> 00:59:21,860\nAnd along with a project champion\n\n1196\n00:59:23,081 --> 00:59:27,559\nshe helped them win them over into where\n\n1197\n00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:32,884\nthey're now supportive, and even leading.\n\n1198\n00:59:32,884 --> 00:59:34,452\n>> Yup, awesome.\n\n1199\n00:59:34,452 --> 00:59:36,170\nAll right,\nwell that is one of the shorter ones.\n\n1200\n00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:36,990\nI mean if you take a look,\n\n1201\n00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:41,350\nit's probably the only process where\nthe notes all fit on one screen.\n\n1202\n00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:44,090\nSo pretty straightforward there.\n\n1203\n00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:44,770\nBut yeah, it is important.\n\n1204\n00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:46,440\nIt's something we need to take care of.\n\n1205\n00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:51,390\nSo, with that one,\nwe've now finished the planning phase.\n\n1206\n00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:57,790\nWe've now covered all of the processes\nin that planning process group.\n\n1207\n00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,380\nNow we're ready to move on.\n\n1208\n00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:01,120\nNow, which is the next phase?\n\n1209\n01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,630\nThe next phase is the executing process\ngroup, but we may not move directly to it.\n\n1210\n01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:10,050\nWe're gonna get to the closing process\ngroup at the end of the show, and\n\n1211\n01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:14,230\nyou technically call on the closing\ngroup at the end of every phase.\n\n1212\n01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,880\nSo at the end of initiating,\nwe did closing.\n\n1213\n01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,670\nAt the end of planning, we now do closing.\n\n1214\n01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,440\nAnd the primary goal of doing\nclosing is to ensure that\n\n1215\n01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,060\nall of our paperwork is in order.\n\n1216\n01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,020\nIf we've drafted ten different\nversions of the scope,\n\n1217\n01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,350\nwe need to sign off on the final one.\n\n1218\n01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,660\nSo we do closing to ensure\nthat that's all in order,\n\n1219\n01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,160\nthat all the paperwork is ready, and\nwe're ready to move to executing.\n\n1220\n01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,320\nBut when we call it at the end,\nit actually closes the whole project down.\n\n1221\n01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,360\nWe're not ready to do that,\nwell unless it's a terrible project.\n\n1222\n01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,530\nBut we're just making\nsure our ducks in a row\n\n1223\n01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,510\nbefore we move to executing, all right?\n\n1224\n01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,820\nBut with that, we're done,\nwe're ready to move to executing.\n\n1225\n01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,450\nSo this a pretty good spot for us to stop.\n\n1226\n01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:57,170\nWe'll cut it here, and\nthat'll end the planning process group.\n\n1227\n01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:59,460\nWe'll pick up with executing, and\nwe're gonna jump right back in.\n\n1228\n01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,836\nWe'll get into directed\nmanaged project work, and\n\n1229\n01:01:01,836 --> 01:01:04,540\nyou'll see that even that's\na light process group for us.\n\n1230\n01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,970\nBecause as the project manager, you're\nnot normally the one doing the work.\n\n1231\n01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,790\nWhile other people are doing it,\nyou're monitoring and controlling so\n\n1232\n01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:12,750\nthat's where we'll see\nmost of our efforts.\n\n1233\n01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,570\nBut, let's go ahead and stop here.\n\n1234\n01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,360\nRonnie, can you think of anything\nshould throw in before we wrap up?\n\n1235\n01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,114\n>> No, just remember because of how big\nthe section is, right, the motto that\n\n1236\n01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:24,988\nwe've always come up with even since\nthe beginning of the show is that projects\n\n1237\n01:01:24,988 --> 01:01:28,470\ndon't fail during the execution or\nthe monitoring and controlling.\n\n1238\n01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:31,060\nIf they tend to fail anywhere,\nit's during the planning stage.\n\n1239\n01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:34,440\nSo, take a lot of time,\nmake sure you go over these processes and\n\n1240\n01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,460\nunderstand them fairly well.\n\n1241\n01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,140\n>> All right, well let me remind you guys,\nif you have any questions, you can always,\n\n1242\n01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,400\nlive during the show, go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1243\n01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,862\nAnd you'll see the chat box\nright beneath the video,\n\n1244\n01:01:45,862 --> 01:01:48,010\nyou can post your questions in there.\n\n1245\n01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:49,230\nWe monitor and answer.\n\n1246\n01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:52,054\nIf you have questions after the show,\nyou can use the Q & A forums.\n\n1247\n01:01:52,054 --> 01:01:55,400\nYou'll see the Q & A link at\nthe top of every single page.\n\n1248\n01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,520\nThat'll take you in there.\n\n1249\n01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,960\nPost your questions, and\nagain, we monitor and answer.\n\n1250\n01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,860\nSo definitely take\nadvantage of that resource.\n\n1251\n01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,850\nIt is there for you.\n\n1252\n01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:05,320\nWell signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n1253\n01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,100\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n1254\n01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,008\n>> And we will see you next

00:00:52,260\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] The sad things that go on\n\n13\n00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,020\naround this studio when\nwe're not shooting,\n\n14\n00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,480\nwe did have a pull up competition.\n\n15\n00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,605\nRonnie and I did tie on the amount of\npull ups, sadly that number was one.\n\n16\n00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:04,330\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n17\n00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,930\nAll right, so,\nupper body strength is not our forte.\n\n18\n00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,760\nBut fortunately, today we're gonna\ndo some more project management,\n\n19\n00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,465\nwhich doesn't require\nmuch upper body strength.\n\n20\n00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:16,000\n[LAUGH] The real sad part, Ronnie?\n\n21\n00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,665\nWe're both gonna be sore tomorrow,\nfrom our one pull.\n\n22\n00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,580\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm already breathing hard.\n\n23\n00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,050\n>> Sad state of affairs.\n\n24\n00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,728\nPresident Bush would be so disappointed.\n\n25\n00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:26,120\n[LAUGH] Or President Reagan,\n\n26\n00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,855\nReagan was the one who was really\npushing the health fitness, whatever.\n\n27\n00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:29,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, all right,\n\n28\n00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,220\nso today we are kicking\noff the execution phase.\n\n29\n00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,230\nAnd this is one of those phases\nthat's really interesting cuz\n\n30\n00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,170\nit's where the work really starts, where\n\n31\n00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,090\npeople start performing the activities\nthat are going to complete our project.\n\n32\n00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,660\nAnd that means, boy, take out all\nthe stops, all the action's happening,\n\n33\n00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,020\nthings go crazy.\n\n34\n00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,650\nWell as a project manager, for\nus, things actually slow down.\n\n35\n00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,700\nWe bust our butts in the planning phases,\nwe're getting ready.\n\n36\n00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,180\nAnd now that's it's time to execute,\nit's time for\n\n37\n00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,800\nus to turn the reigns over\nto the work package owners,\n\n38\n00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,639\nthe people who are actually going\nto do the work to get things done.\n\n39\n00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,960\nThat doesn't mean that we kick our feet up\non the table, drink a mai tai and relax.\n\n40\n00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,700\nOr maybe you do,\ndepends on the office you work in.\n\n41\n00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,980\nBut normally what it means is that\nwe transition into monitoring and\n\n42\n00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,920\ncontrolling.\n\n43\n00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,600\nWe start watching the work\nthat's getting done\n\n44\n00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,310\nto ensure that it does in fact get done.\n\n45\n00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,690\nSo that's our role at this point and\nit actually usually does ease up on us.\n\n46\n00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,970\nWhich is good cuz it takes a lot\nto get through the planning phase.\n\n47\n00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,010\nSo as we move through\nthe execution process groups and\n\n48\n00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,530\nthe knowledge areas inside of there.\n\n49\n00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,230\nWhen we start working through those,\nyou're gonna see there's not a whole heck\n\n50\n00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,790\nof a lot here for\nthe project manager to do.\n\n51\n00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,970\nAnd that's fine,\n\n52\n00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,900\nbecause when this is done we're going to\ntake a look at monitoring and controlling.\n\n53\n00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,750\nAnd there is a lot for us to do there and\nit's mostly paperwork.\n\n54\n00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,050\nSo it's not the most exciting but\n\n55\n00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,770\nit is very rewarding because we\nare seeing the project move along.\n\n56\n00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,260\nAll right, so\nthe first one we're gonna take a look at.\n\n57\n00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,070\nLet me bring up my process\ngroup guide o stuff.\n\n58\n00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,330\nHang on just a second.\n\n59\n00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,490\nLet me click and click and click.\n\n60\n00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,790\nThere we go.\n\n61\n00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,040\nSo here's the kind of\nprocess group structure, and\n\n62\n00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,250\nin the executing process group,\nyou'll notice how it's a little light.\n\n63\n00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,930\nThere's no risk management going on.\n\n64\n00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,080\nThere's no project cost management.\n\n65\n00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,330\nTime management, scope management,\nthere is none of that going on, and\n\n66\n00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,760\nthat's because we deal with\nthat in monitoring control.\n\n67\n00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,180\nWe've already planned for this stuff, now\nwe just need to make sure that it happens.\n\n68\n00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,340\nSo, we'll start off right here under\nproject integration management, and\n\n69\n00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,430\nremember that knowledge area,\nintegration management, that's us,\n\n70\n00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,680\nthat's the project manager.\n\n71\n00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,410\nAnd it's how we handle\nthe overall project.\n\n72\n00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,420\nSo see what we've got here,\ndirect and manage project work.\n\n73\n00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,130\nIt doesn't say, do the work.\n\n74\n00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,720\nIt's just direct and manage.\n\n75\n00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,870\nKeep an eye on things,\nmake sure they're going well.\n\n76\n00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,890\nWe're really gonna be doing this,\nmonitor and control project work.\n\n77\n00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,490\nPerform change control,\nvalidate scope and so on.\n\n78\n00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,520\nThose are the things that we're\nreally gonna be focused on.\n\n79\n00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,860\nBut let's take a look at this process and\nsee what damage we can do in there.\n\n80\n00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,330\nDirect and manage the work.\n\n81\n00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,690\nWe're telling people to get to work and\nthey get to work.\n\n82\n00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,220\nThat's it.\n\n83\n00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,640\nWe're done.\nEasiest processed group ever.\n\n84\n00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,630\nBut there is some tools and\ntechniques here.\n\n85\n00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,010\nYou'll see under the inputs,\n\n86\n00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,640\nwe've got our project management plan\nwhich is telling us how to do things.\n\n87\n00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,870\nIf there have been change requests,\nany changes from our original plan,\n\n88\n00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,420\nthe approved change requests\nbecome inputs here.\n\n89\n00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,900\nWhen people go to do their work,\n\n90\n00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,110\nif there's been a change\nthey need to be aware of it.\n\n91\n00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,930\nIf the date of that task has been moved or\nwhatever.\n\n92\n00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,100\nOur enterprise environmental factors and\norganizational process assets,\n\n93\n00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,860\nthose are the other inputs for us.\n\n94\n00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,720\nJust like we always have,\nany paperwork and so on.\n\n95\n00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,580\nNow there is an important one here that\nthey don't call out specifically, but you\n\n96\n00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,900\nmay have an organizational process asset\nthat is called a work authorization form.\n\n97\n00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,840\nJust because a resource is attached to an\nactivity, just because in our little Gantt\n\n98\n00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,750\nchart, we say that Tom in accounting is\nsupposed to do an accounting review on\n\n99\n00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,090\nTuesday, doesn't mean he's actually going\nto do an accounting review on Tuesday.\n\n100\n00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,690\nWe may need to fill out a work\nauthorization form that says,\n\n101\n00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,740\nTom is authorized to work for eight hours\non Tuesday to do this for our project in\n\n102\n00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,620\nblack and white, no uncertain terms\nthat we give to his functional manager.\n\n103\n00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,010\nAnd then his functional manager,\nshe can look at it and say okay,\n\n104\n00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,540\nTom you're authorized to work on it,\noff you go.\n\n105\n00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,310\nSo that's an important thing and\nthat would be an organizational process,\n\n106\n00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,420\nthat form.\n\n107\n00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,710\nNow filling it out and\napplying it, that's what we do.\n\n108\n00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,700\nOr we may have subordinates\nthat we delegate that to.\n\n109\n00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,320\nSo we may have extra judgment here,\njust whatever our own instincts tells us.\n\n110\n00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,340\nWhat our experiences over the years\nhave built up to include.\n\n111\n00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,549\nWe will most likely have project\nmanagement information systems,\n\n112\n00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:50,680\nwe'll have software that we use for\nmanaging all of this.\n\n113\n00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,250\nHow do I know what work needs\nto get done on Thursday?\n\n114\n00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,490\nIf I have a work authorization system I\nprobably have software that powers that,\n\n115\n00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,110\nscheduling software or what ever.\n\n116\n00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,130\nSo we need to leverage those\nsystems that our organization has.\n\n117\n00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,890\nAnd then, meetings.\n\n118\n00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,040\nWhen you're ready to kick off work,\nyou almost always start with a meeting.\n\n119\n00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,080\nIf you ever get to a construction site at\nthe beginning of the day, those guys don't\n\n120\n00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,330\njust walk up to the building and then\nstart breaking our their hammer and nails.\n\n121\n00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,750\nThey usually stop and have a meeting,\n\n122\n00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,900\nthey lay out what they're gonna work\non that day and then they get to work.\n\n123\n00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,170\nAnd so that's a pivotal\ntool of starting that work.\n\n124\n00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,300\nAll right,\nnow our output here is normally going\n\n125\n00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,379\nto be,\n>> The work.\n\n126\n00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,140\n[LAUGH]\n>> Work yeah, [LAUGH] but\n\n127\n00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,380\nit's hard to quantify and qualify work and\nso we represent it different ways.\n\n128\n00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,000\nWe'll see deliverables.\n\n129\n00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,900\nIn other words, what they did.\n\n130\n00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,150\nDid they actually finish\nthe work they set out to do?\n\n131\n00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,950\nThey said they were gonna put the roof up,\nis there a roof on the house?\n\n132\n00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,430\nWork Performance Data.\n\n133\n00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,870\nMost of our activities\ndon't finish in one day.\n\n134\n00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,290\nSo at the end of the day, if I got half\nthe roof up, do I have a deliverable?\n\n135\n00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,790\nNo.\n\n136\n00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,990\nDeliverables are either done or\nthey're not, there's no in between.\n\n137\n00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,030\nSo I don't have a deliverable.\n\n138\n00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,990\nBut that doesn't mean nothing happened.\n\n139\n00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,050\nI may just have performance data.\n\n140\n00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,580\nHey, it's the end of day one,\nwe're 20 percent done, and\n\n141\n00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,860\nit looks like we've got\nfour more days of work.\n\n142\n00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,500\nAll right?\n\n143\n00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,430\nThe reason we need that performance data\nis because we can then compare it to our\n\n144\n00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,840\nschedule, and we can see whether we\nare going to be on track or not.\n\n145\n00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,430\nIf at the end of day one we are 20%\ndone but it's a 3 day activity,\n\n146\n00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,500\nthen I'm behind schedule,\nI should be 33% done on day one, right?\n\n147\n00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,640\nSo, I can see that, and\nI can start to take action.\n\n148\n00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,520\nThat performance data, we're gonna see\nthat in the form of status reports which\n\n149\n00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,200\nwe'll look at more in the next phase.\n\n150\n00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,210\nBut those status reports are how we're\ngonna know whether things are going\n\n151\n00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:38,900\nright or wrong.\n\n152\n00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,260\nIf things are going\nwrong we gotta fix them.\n\n153\n00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,660\nAnd how do we fix them?\n\n154\n00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,540\nWe fix them with change requests.\n\n155\n00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,940\n>> Yep.\n\n156\n00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,915\n>> We keep seeing change\nrequests keep popping up.\n\n157\n00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:54,140\nI want to talk about change tickets when\nwe get to monitoring controlling because.\n\n158\n00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,714\nThat's how we control our projects.\n\n159\n00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:59,832\nAnd I don't want to dive too deep into\nthem here, but if something's gone wrong,\n\n160\n00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:01,980\nwe need to update our\nproject to correct for\n\n161\n00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,770\nthat and we fill out a change\nrequest to try and get it approved.\n\n162\n00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,170\nWe may not be the only ones\noriginating those though.\n\n163\n00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:13,120\nSomebody out in the field might say, wow,\nwe have these estimates, they're wrong.\n\n164\n00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,740\nHere's what's actually going on.\n\n165\n00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,840\nI need to fill out a change ticket.\n\n166\n00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,630\nSo we need to evaluate them and\nact upon that.\n\n167\n00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,090\nAfter that we may see project management\nplan updates if we need to change\n\n168\n00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,040\nthe plan, if you've had anything come up.\n\n169\n00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,430\nAnd then project document updates as\nyou update your stakeholder registry,\n\n170\n00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,760\nall the other data that may\nneed to get updated as a result\n\n171\n00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,100\nof that change request.\n\n172\n00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,030\nIf the change request is approved then\nit changes the schedule, or the budget.\n\n173\n00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,930\nWe've got a lot of documentation we've\ngot to go and update to reflect that.\n\n174\n00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,030\nSo this is all a part of directing and\nmanaging work.\n\n175\n00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,430\nIt's a lot, a decent bit of\nstuff that's going on there, but\n\n176\n00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,260\nfor the most part it's common sense.\n\n177\n00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,470\nSo, just be aware of some of\nthe variations of that data, all right.\n\n178\n00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,310\nI mentioned change requests, right?\n\n179\n00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,880\nThere's several different\ntypes of change requests.\n\n180\n00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,660\nWe have corrective and\nthat's the most common.\n\n181\n00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,490\nWe have a problem,\nwe need to do something to fix it.\n\n182\n00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,850\nHere it is, a corrective, right?\n\n183\n00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,570\nWe might have a preventative right?\n\n184\n00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:19,160\nWe see a problem might be coming down\nthe road and so we take action now.\n\n185\n00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,910\nIt's a five day activity.\n\n186\n00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,640\nDay one is done, they are only\nten per cent of the way through.\n\n187\n00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,610\nI know based on that data, they are not\nlikely to hit their scheduled date.\n\n188\n00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,780\nUnless something crazy happens.so I go\ndown and talk to the people and ask,\n\n189\n00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,040\nis it just that we have back\nloaded the work or whatever.\n\n190\n00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,270\nAnd If I find out that they are actually\nbehind, I can take preventative action now\n\n191\n00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,000\nto stop them from running behind,\ndo something to bolster up their speed.\n\n192\n00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,750\nThere might be defect repair, right?\n\n193\n00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,620\nThere may be an issue that has crept up.\n\n194\n00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,270\nAnd that issue is resulting\nin us having to stop and\n\n195\n00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,850\nfix the problem,\nsomething we didn't anticipate.\n\n196\n00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,880\nSo we've got to do a little more\nwork to get things done and move on.\n\n197\n00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,000\nAnd then updates, right.\n\n198\n00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,240\nAn update is not normally a true\nchange in the sense of change.\n\n199\n00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,190\nA great example of an update\nmight be I have a contract.\n\n200\n00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,810\nAnd the contract is with\na third-party company.\n\n201\n00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,160\nAnd the primary technical contact\nis Betsy, and Betsy retires.\n\n202\n00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,850\nAnd so a new employee steps in, it's Tom.\n\n203\n00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,930\nAnd I just need to change the contact,\nright?\n\n204\n00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,880\nSo I'm not changing the scope or budget or\n\n205\n00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,280\nschedule, it's just changing a contact on\nthat contract, it's a minor change and so\n\n206\n00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,780\nI do a change ticket with an update for\nthat information, right.\n\n207\n00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,130\nI'll replace a resource,\nI have a resource that's out sick,\n\n208\n00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,810\nI'll replace him with another resource.\n\n209\n00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,580\nMinor change, right?\n\n210\n00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,322\nThose are updates.\n\n211\n00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:47,130\nAll right, so those are things that might\nhappen under the scope, I mean not scope,\n\n212\n00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,960\nunder the project management plan\nwe could be updating anything and\n\n213\n00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,690\nRonnie list out just all\nthe different plans that we have.\n\n214\n00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:59,240\nAny one of those may need to be updated as\njust due course of working on the project\n\n215\n00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,510\nas we learn more we update those plans\nto reflect what works best for us.\n\n216\n00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,275\nAnd then on that\ndocumentation that we output.\n\n217\n00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:11,805\nA lot of it's just going to be\nproject logs, how we've moved along,\n\n218\n00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:16,355\nour issues, assumptions, anything like\nthat, what's going on, all right?\n\n219\n00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:19,305\nBut it could be something a little\nbit more significant, for\n\n220\n00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,275\nexample, remember our risk register.\n\n221\n00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:24,915\nWe kept track of all the risks we\ncould have, now we're executing,\n\n222\n00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:26,580\nnow things are happening.\n\n223\n00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,010\nIf one of those risks comes to fruition\nwe're going to see it right here.\n\n224\n00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,830\nThere was a risk that the price\nof lumber could go up.\n\n225\n00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,490\nI recognized that,\nI set some cash reserves for it.\n\n226\n00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,250\nNow I get to execution and the guys\nactually go out and buy that lumber.\n\n227\n00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,120\nDid the price go up?\n\n228\n00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,880\nIf it did, I've got my reserves,\nit's taken care of.\n\n229\n00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,350\nIf it didn't, great.\n\n230\n00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,840\nWe bought the lumber, it came in at\nthe low price, the risk is now gone.\n\n231\n00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,130\nWe bought our lumber,\nthat risk is no longer present.\n\n232\n00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,380\nSo we go to our risk register and\nwe update it, we put in there nope.\n\n233\n00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,590\nLumber came in at cost,\nno craziness here, this risk is resolved.\n\n234\n00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,920\nWe change that status to resolved, and\nit's no longer one we have to monitor.\n\n235\n00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,160\nSo that's a nice thing that we now can do,\nbecause we're in the execution phase.\n\n236\n00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,440\nWe're actually getting things done, we\nstart marking these things off the list.\n\n237\n00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,580\nAll right, so we're going to be getting\na lot of information back from our\n\n238\n00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,920\npeople as they're doing\nwork out in the field.\n\n239\n00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,720\nWe'll get status updates, we'll talk\nabout those more in monitoring and\n\n240\n00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120\ncontrolling, but\nwe'll also get change requests,\n\n241\n00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,640\nagain we'll also talk about those\nmore in monitoring and controlling.\n\n242\n00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,760\nBut that's basically all\nthat's going on right here\n\n243\n00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,610\nin the direct and managed project work.\n\n244\n00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,310\nThe key element here is you're\ntelling people, get to work.\n\n245\n00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,480\nAnd, they're getting to work that's it.\n\n246\n00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,840\nThat's what happens in this process.\n\n247\n00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,600\nAll right.\n\n248\n00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,180\nThe next one we want to take a look\nat is the Perform quality assurance.\n\n249\n00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,690\nRemember I mentioned quality in the last,\nactually it was a couple episodes ago.\n\n250\n00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,670\nWe have quality assurance,\nand quality control.\n\n251\n00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,360\nAnd notice my two processes here.\n\n252\n00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,360\nPerform quality assurance in execution,\nand\n\n253\n00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,190\nthen control quality in\nthe monitoring controlling.\n\n254\n00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,500\nThey're both really\nhappening at the same time.\n\n255\n00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,030\nThe key difference if you've\nforgotten is Quality assurance\n\n256\n00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,670\nis trying to prevent\na problem before it occurs.\n\n257\n00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,510\nDoing things,\n\n258\n00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,045\ntaking measures to insure the problems\ndon't happen in the first place.\n\n259\n00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:28,520\nThe people who are executing, the people\nwho are actually doing the work.\n\n260\n00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,220\nThey're the ones that do that.\n\n261\n00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,860\nThey're the ones who implement\nthe measures ahead of time\n\n262\n00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,230\nto ensure their work is\nas perfect as possible.\n\n263\n00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,910\nQuality control is\nmonitoring the work that has\n\n264\n00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,530\nalready been done to\nensure it meets quality.\n\n265\n00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,860\nAnd if doesn't, red flagging it and\ntaking action to correct it.\n\n266\n00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,430\nAnd that's what we as project managers, or\n\n267\n00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,320\nour inspectors that we bring in,\nthat's what they do.\n\n268\n00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,520\nWe monitor, and\nthen we take action if quality is not met.\n\n269\n00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,670\nYou don't normally pick one of the other,\nyou normally do both in moderation, right?\n\n270\n00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,450\nA fairly even distribution.\n\n271\n00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,680\nSo, you're doing quality assurance and\nquality control,\n\n272\n00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,120\nand between the two you should\nensure that you catch all defects.\n\n273\n00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,790\nAll right, so let's take a look at that\nprocess right there, quality assurance.\n\n274\n00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:19,047\nAll right, when we look at quality\nassurance, we take our quality management\n\n275\n00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:23,070\nplan, because it lays out how\nwe're going to be doing Q&A right?\n\n276\n00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,930\nWe take any process\nimprovement plan that we have.\n\n277\n00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,980\nAnd we haven't really.\n\n278\n00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,450\nDid we dive into process improvement yet?\n\n279\n00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,133\n>> Not much.\n>> Okay we're going to see\n\n280\n00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:31,390\nprocess improvement.\n\n281\n00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,480\nActually let me make sure.\n\n282\n00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,580\nDid we see that somewhere else or\nshould we go into that right now?\n\n283\n00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,350\nI don't want to get it out of order.\n\n284\n00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,580\nYou know, we really don't, do we?\n\n285\n00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,090\nThis is probably as good a time as any\nto talk about process improvement.\n\n286\n00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,230\nProcess improvement is\na really interesting thing.\n\n287\n00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,320\nIt starts to get out of\nthe scope of project management,\n\n288\n00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,620\nbecause most companies, especially\nmanufacturing companies they are going to\n\n289\n00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,490\nbe doing process improvement all the time.\n\n290\n00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,570\nThey do what's called CPI,\ncontinual process improvement.\n\n291\n00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,570\nAnd the idea is, no matter what you do,\n\n292\n00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,110\nthere's always some way to make it better,\nright?\n\n293\n00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,670\nYou can either do it cheaper, or\nwith less defects or more efficiently or\n\n294\n00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,250\nsafer, there's something you\ncan do to make it better.\n\n295\n00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,840\nUnless, 100% of what you do is perfect and\ndone in the most rapid schedule possible.\n\n296\n00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,880\nBut the odds are new technologies\ncome out that make yours obsolete.\n\n297\n00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,265\nSo there's always room for improvement.\n\n298\n00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:36,225\nWe made the example of\ndesigning the 2016 Ford Focus.\n\n299\n00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:41,021\nWell Ford already has tons of assembly\nlines for manufacturing vehicles.\n\n300\n00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:43,307\nAnd they work really, really well.\n\n301\n00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:45,199\nThey produce tons of vehicles every year.\n\n302\n00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,151\nAll right.\n\n303\n00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:47,696\nBut as new equipment comes out.\n\n304\n00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,190\nNew riveting machines,\nnew measuring and diagnostic machines.\n\n305\n00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,800\nAs new equipment comes out,\nthey can make their conveyor belt better.\n\n306\n00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,940\nThey can make them generate more\ncars per day for lower cost.\n\n307\n00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,010\nAnd how do they know to do that?\n\n308\n00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,380\nThrough process improvement.\n\n309\n00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,020\nOur company may have a process\nimprovement plan, where we designate out\n\n310\n00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,330\nwhat we're gonna do to make things better,\nand we constantly monitor that.\n\n311\n00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,180\nThat may be within a project.\n\n312\n00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,830\nIt may just be part of ongoing activities.\n\n313\n00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,660\nThat's why I say this one kinda\ngets outside of the realm of\n\n314\n00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,780\nproject management.\n\n315\n00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,470\nBut it is important.\n\n316\n00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,300\nIf we have a process improvement plan\nthat tells us what we need to do to\n\n317\n00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,850\nwatch what's going on in our project to\nmake it better, then we follow that plan.\n\n318\n00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:35,300\nIf we don't, well we do, it as part of our\nquality management and control on our own.\n\n319\n00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,670\nWe monitor what's going on and\nsee what we can do to make things better\n\n320\n00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,740\neven if we don't have\na process improvement plan.\n\n321\n00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,720\nNow there's an entire science built\naround process improvement, and if any of\n\n322\n00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,030\nyou have read a book on like Six Sigma\n>> yeah\n\n323\n00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,480\n>> That's probably one of the biggest\n\n324\n00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,260\nones, but there's other ones, OPM3,\nwhat are some of the other ones?\n\n325\n00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,190\nThere's a few that have crazy names.\n\n326\n00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,960\nSix Sigma is the biggest.\n\n327\n00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,480\nOPM3 is from PMI,\nthe same people who do PMP, so\n\n328\n00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,180\nthat's another one that's\ngaining in popularity.\n\n329\n00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,970\nBut there are a few special like special\nlet's see, do we have them here?\n\n330\n00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,660\nSpecial people that we need to be aware\nof when it comes to process improvement.\n\n331\n00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,180\n>> I think it comes later on in\nour controlling and monitoring.\n\n332\n00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,030\n>> I haven't jumped ahead?\n\n333\n00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,920\nI thought it was later.\n\n334\n00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,450\nBut you know what, I've started talking\nbout it, so daggonnit, I'm gonna find it.\n\n335\n00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:23,970\n>> Deming?\n\n336\n00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,330\n>> Yeah, let me hunt Deming.\n\n337\n00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,570\nI guess I have to spell their name right.\n\n338\n00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,170\nHere we go, all right.\n\n339\n00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,490\nWhen we talk about process improvement,\nhow do we do that?\n\n340\n00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,180\nHow do we make our processes better?\n\n341\n00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,140\nThe PMI calls out several different\nmethods so we'll see it right here,\n\n342\n00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,640\nsome of the ones that are listed.\n\n343\n00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,030\nPMI specifically calls out\na handful in the PMBOOK and\n\n344\n00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,390\nit all focuses on where we get this\ndata to make our processes better.\n\n345\n00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,270\nWhen I think of process improvement,\nI got straight to the idea of\n\n346\n00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,410\ncontinuous improvement and that's what\nI was talking about a moment ago.\n\n347\n00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,390\nNow let's run through each of\nthese because, for example,\n\n348\n00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,830\nwe've got customer satisfaction,\nif we're manufacturing blue jeans or\n\n349\n00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,980\nthe 2016 Ford Focus or whatever, and\nwe see a high amount of warranty returns.\n\n350\n00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,580\nIf we see a lot of returns\non the blue jeans and\n\n351\n00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,090\ndefects, customers are not\ngoing to be happy.\n\n352\n00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,560\nAnd so we're gonna hear about that.\n\n353\n00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,410\nAnd that will be our first\nindicator that there's a problem.\n\n354\n00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,220\nProblem that we need to fix to step in and\n\n355\n00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,650\nimprove upon, that's one area where we may\nfind out and then take steps to correct.\n\n356\n00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,390\nRight?\n\n357\n00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,570\n>> Another area here is the idea of\nthe prevention over inspection, too.\n\n358\n00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,210\nRight?\n\n359\n00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,070\nThis actually gives us that time to say,\nlook, we don't wanna actually\n\n360\n00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,302\nwait until we're under the quality\ncontrol to figure things out.\n\n361\n00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:44,010\nWe wanna go ahead and be proactive about\nthis and prevent anything that we see at\n\n362\n00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,170\nthat point, before we actually get in\nthat part where we actually have to\n\n363\n00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,160\nagain do this control and\nsend it all the way back for work.\n\n364\n00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,730\nHere is another ticker process that we\ncan do to improve our quality as well.\n\n365\n00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,360\n>> Yeah, and\nthen that leads to continuous improvement,\n\n366\n00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,370\nlike what I've been talking about.\n\n367\n00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,800\nYou can always make, things better, and\nthere's a couple of big names that are out\n\n368\n00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,450\nthere, and you can find books on these,\nentire college courses on these.\n\n369\n00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,215\nTQM which is Total Quality Management,\nSic Sigma and Lane Sic Sigma.\n\n370\n00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,065\nBig names that are out there.\n\n371\n00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:18,275\nBut you'll see some other people,\nMalcolm Baldridge.\n\n372\n00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:19,205\nWhere is Deming?\n\n373\n00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:20,315\nOh, there he is.\n\n374\n00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:22,085\nShoehard and modified by Deming.\n\n375\n00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:27,825\nThe Plan-Do-Check act,\nthat's what Deming's idea was.\n\n376\n00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:30,955\nYou plan, you come up with a plan for\nhow to do something and then you do it.\n\n377\n00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,915\nAnd then you don't stop there.\n\n378\n00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:37,780\nThen you check to see if there's anything\nwe can do to improve, and you act.\n\n379\n00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,226\nAnd when you're done,\nyou start over again.\n\n380\n00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:42,222\nPlan do check you repeat over.\n\n381\n00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,963\nIt's a continual cycle.\n\n382\n00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:46,690\nYou're never done improving.\n\n383\n00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,610\nThose names, they do turn up\non the exam from time to time.\n\n384\n00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,850\nYou do wanna make sure\nyou're familiar with them.\n\n385\n00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,530\nEspecially Demming and Six Sigma.\n\n386\n00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,930\nThose are the ones that Creep up.\n\n387\n00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,740\nBut OPM3, the Organization Project\nManagement Maturity Model,\n\n388\n00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,250\nthat's a mouthful,\nthat's the one from PMI.\n\n389\n00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,710\nVery similar to the other ones,\nso they promoted that one.\n\n390\n00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,650\nA few of the other ones,\nwe just have management responsibility.\n\n391\n00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,380\nAs a manager, it's your job,\nto look out for\n\n392\n00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,020\nthe interest of the company so you want\nto do anything you can to improve.\n\n393\n00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,330\nAnd then we've always got cost over\nquality which we talked about in another\n\n394\n00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,230\nepisode.\n\n395\n00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,270\nBut understanding that you can't\nmake things better, well normally,\n\n396\n00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,610\nyou can't make things better.\n\n397\n00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,960\nWithout having to spend a little money.\n\n398\n00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,960\nAre we able to get a return\non that money we spend?\n\n399\n00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,790\nWe have to do a cost-benefit analysis.\n\n400\n00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:41,320\nAll right, those are some of the different\nthings that we need to think about when\n\n401\n00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,070\nwe're talking about,\nprocess improvement and\n\n402\n00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,530\nlike Ronnie said we probably\nwill talk about it again later.\n\n403\n00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,890\nI just can't remember where it is and so\n\n404\n00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,362\nI wanna make sure that we cover\nit in enough depth for the exam.\n\n405\n00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:58,270\nThere we go, all right, we got a few other\nthings in here like our quality metrics.\n\n406\n00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:58,930\nAll right.\n\n407\n00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,720\nIf you're going to be measuring,\nhow your performance is and\n\n408\n00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840\ntaking action,\nyou're gonna need the numbers, right?\n\n409\n00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,190\nAnd it's whoever's doing the execution\nis gonna get those for you.\n\n410\n00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,090\nThey're doing the work, they're working\non it so they can gather the metrics and\n\n411\n00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,170\nsubmit it to you.\n\n412\n00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,795\nIf you don't trust them, if you want.\n\n413\n00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:16,055\nI shouldn't say it that way.\n\n414\n00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:17,345\nIt's not about trust.\n\n415\n00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:23,065\nIf you want impartial, unbiased data,\nthen you may need to bring in inspectors.\n\n416\n00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:27,580\nYou have some people doing the work, and\nyou have inspectors gathering your data.\n\n417\n00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,090\nIt's up to you how you\nwanna go about that.\n\n418\n00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,720\nTake like the EPA for example,\n\n419\n00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,360\nthe Environmental Protection Agency\nhere in the US,\n\n420\n00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,530\nthey need to gather data from how people's\nemissions are during manufacturing.\n\n421\n00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,770\nAnd it's not, well I guess it is, if they\ndon't trust the people, so they send out\n\n422\n00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,800\ntheir own EPA, investigators to gather\ndata on emissions and then you measure and\n\n423\n00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,110\nsite companies whenever they're in\nviolation of what they promised.\n\n424\n00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,630\nQuality control, quality control, if we've\nalready done something to fix the problem,\n\n425\n00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,130\ncuz remember quality control\nthat's after the fact.\n\n426\n00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,470\nIf we've done something to fix\nthe problem, we're done and we stop right?\n\n427\n00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,080\nWell, no.\n\n428\n00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,810\nNow that quality control has happened,\nthat's an input.\n\n429\n00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,580\nNow we need to see whether it worked or\nnot.\n\n430\n00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,620\nWhoever's executing is going through and\n\n431\n00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,460\ndoing quality assurance to verify that\neverything is working the way that it's\n\n432\n00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,960\nsupposed to, and\ntaking any actions necessary there.\n\n433\n00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,140\nAnd then our Project Documents.\n\n434\n00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,530\nOur documents have all sorts of\ninformation as far as how we're carrying\n\n435\n00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,690\nout quality and other people that\nwe may need to reach out to.\n\n436\n00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,240\nThese are all our inputs\ninto quality assurance.\n\n437\n00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,720\nAll right, now we've got a few tools and\ntechniques that we apply for\n\n438\n00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,260\nquality assurance, but let's do this.\n\n439\n00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,750\nLet's stop and take a break.\n\n440\n00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,700\nAnd when we get back,\nwe'll dive into those.\n\n441\n00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,450\nKind of take a look of some of\nthe things that are available there and\n\n442\n00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,130\ncontinue on with the world of quality.\n\n443\n00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,630\nSound good, Wren?\n\n444\n00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,460\n>> Sound great.\n\n445\n00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,440\n>> Ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n446\n00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,867\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n447\n00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:55,985\n[MUSIC]\n\n448\n00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:57,727\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n449\n00:22:57,727 --> 00:23:02,376\n>> Okay, so when we're working with\nthe idea of quality assurance, right, so\n\n450\n00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:06,600\npreventing issues before they happen,\nwe're in execution.\n\n451\n00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,880\nHopefully we've put our QA methods\nin place that are effective and\n\n452\n00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,390\nwe don't have to mess with them again.\n\n453\n00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,820\nBut how do we really know?\n\n454\n00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,970\nWe don't until execution happens and\nwe see what's going on.\n\n455\n00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,340\nNow, this is where PMI starts\nto blur the line a little bit.\n\n456\n00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,550\nWe're gonna do a lot of quality\ncontrol stuff in the monitoring and\n\n457\n00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,350\ncontrolling phase.\n\n458\n00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,950\nBut, somebody has to perform\nwhat's called a quality audit, and\n\n459\n00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,550\na quality audit is where we go and\n\n460\n00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,760\nexamine the work that's being done\nto ensure that quality is being met.\n\n461\n00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,140\nTo make sure that our quality assurance\nsteps are being applied properly.\n\n462\n00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,783\nAnd that we gather the data to provide for\nquality control.\n\n463\n00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:47,383\nWhen we saw over here quality metrics and\nquality control,\n\n464\n00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:49,230\nWhere does that data come from?\n\n465\n00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,924\nWell, it comes from quality audits.\n\n466\n00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:55,574\nThe quality audits give us data that\nwe can then use to put into some of\n\n467\n00:23:55,574 --> 00:24:00,062\nthe quality management and control tools\nthat are really just different charts and\n\n468\n00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:02,455\ngraphs that we can use\nto create these data.\n\n469\n00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:04,098\nI'm gonna go a little\nbit out of order here.\n\n470\n00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:06,835\nI'm gonna start with quality audits and\nthen come back to the tools so\n\n471\n00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:08,125\nwe can see that.\n\n472\n00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:13,820\nA quality audit is in the execution phase\nbecause you're gonna have an auditor,\n\n473\n00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,300\neither a third party inspector or your own\nemployee who goes to gather this data.\n\n474\n00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,780\nSo going and gathering the data is work,\nand that's why it falls under execution.\n\n475\n00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,600\nAnd they're gonna go out there with\na form that looks something like this.\n\n476\n00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,300\nAnd every company has different forms,\nso this is just an example.\n\n477\n00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,370\nBut basically they're gonna go and\naudit some aspect of the project.\n\n478\n00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,710\nWhatever that aspect is,\nthey document it here.\n\n479\n00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,540\nAnd then they're looking for\nareas where things are going great, and\n\n480\n00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,300\nareas where things are not going great.\n\n481\n00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,235\nWe wanna know what things are wonderful\nbecause that's behavior we want to\n\n482\n00:24:48,235 --> 00:24:49,275\nreplicate.\n\n483\n00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:51,975\nDid they find a new way\nto do things faster?\n\n484\n00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:53,405\nI wanna know that.\n\n485\n00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:55,175\nDid they find a new way to do it better?\n\n486\n00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:58,290\nIf we can figure that out we can\nuse that again in other projects.\n\n487\n00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,130\nBut if they're falling behind,\nif there's areas for improvement, why?\n\n488\n00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,710\nI need to find out why.\n\n489\n00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,580\nIf somebody finishes an activity a day\nahead of schedule, I need to know why.\n\n490\n00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,370\nAnd in my book there's really two\nreasons why something would finish\n\n491\n00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,600\nahead of schedule.\n\n492\n00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,960\nEither one, they found some great\nnew way to get through faster, or\n\n493\n00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,820\ntwo, something didn't get done.\n\n494\n00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,610\nAnd that something didn't get done,\nthat's either part of the activity itself,\n\n495\n00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:31,645\nor they didn't give factual numbers back\nwhen the original estimate was done.\n\n496\n00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:34,595\nSo the thing that didn't get done\nwas the whole being honest part.\n\n497\n00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:37,495\nSo, something didn't get done and\nthat's normally what I just default to.\n\n498\n00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,295\nI assume that something didn't get\ndone if they're ahead of schedule.\n\n499\n00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:44,405\nBut if I had auditors on the field and\nthey were sending me data back saying, oh,\n\n500\n00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:46,345\nyeah they found a new way\nto get this done faster.\n\n501\n00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,865\nThat's an area of excellence.\n\n502\n00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:49,925\nNow when they finish ahead of schedule,\n\n503\n00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,425\nI knew they were gonna\nfinish ahead of schedule.\n\n504\n00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,390\nI knew it because my audit data had it.\n\n505\n00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,470\nI'm prepared.\n\n506\n00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,800\nI'm ready to receive that and\nI don't have to get paranoid and say,\n\n507\n00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,598\nwait a minute, what did you guys screw up?\n\n508\n00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,640\nBecause they didn't, they did it great.\n\n509\n00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,599\nSo we wanna make sure we document that.\n\n510\n00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,920\nIf there's anything that is deficient,\nwe catalog that.\n\n511\n00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,100\nWhat's the defect?\n\n512\n00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,730\nWhat action do we need\nto take to correct it?\n\n513\n00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,589\nNow, just because you put it in\nhere as an action doesn't mean you\n\n514\n00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:17,250\nare actually going to do this.\n\n515\n00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,020\nWe need to create a change ticket\nthat centers around this to actually\n\n516\n00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,990\ntake the action.\n\n517\n00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,470\nSo this is kind of like\na preliminary action.\n\n518\n00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,870\nThe auditor just makes a recommendation,\nthey may not have one.\n\n519\n00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,110\nThey may see a defect and go, gosh,\nI don't know how to fix this.\n\n520\n00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,590\nAnd so\nwe just have to look at that later and\n\n521\n00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,080\ncome up with some other option,\nhave a meeting whatever.\n\n522\n00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,230\nAnd then they provide their commentary, so\nyour auditors are constantly going out and\n\n523\n00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,600\ngathering this data and\nsending it back to you.\n\n524\n00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,615\nAs the project manager, maybe you're\ngoing out and doing these audits, but\n\n525\n00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:48,643\nmore commonly you're handing\nthis off to someone else and\n\n526\n00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:52,181\nthey're collecting the data so\nthat you can take it and act upon it.\n\n527\n00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:52,806\nAll right.\n\n528\n00:26:52,806 --> 00:26:58,569\nSo that data is going to be fed into our\nquality management and control tools and\n\n529\n00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:03,830\nthose tools typically represent\nthemselves as charts and graphs.\n\n530\n00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,580\nRight?\n\n531\n00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,880\nPMI, they love the charts and graphs.\n\n532\n00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,400\nAnd you'll see here we've got all\nsorts of ones available to us.\n\n533\n00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,010\nOkay?\n\n534\n00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,190\nAffinity diagrams,\nprocess decision diagrams and so on.\n\n535\n00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,190\nEach one kind of serves\na different purpose.\n\n536\n00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:23,510\nThe PMBOK, again yet another reason to\ngo ahead and become a PMI member, so\n\n537\n00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,120\nyou can get the PMBOK,\ngives us some examples of all of these.\n\n538\n00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,442\nAnd each one has a slightly\ndifferent purpose, but\n\n539\n00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:31,015\nthey're fairly generic charts.\n\n540\n00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:34,330\nYou'll see the affinity diagram,\nand so on.\n\n541\n00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,830\nEach one represents a different\naspect of our organization.\n\n542\n00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:44,700\nSo the affinity diagram, here's where\nwe start looking toward cause and\n\n543\n00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,050\neffect type things.\n\n544\n00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,660\nSo we have an issue,\n\n545\n00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,260\nwhat are some of the different things\nthat contribute to the one issues?\n\n546\n00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,020\nThis is kind of like\na brainstorming when we start\n\n547\n00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,960\ndoing the affinity diagrams there,\ngrouping things together by like idea.\n\n548\n00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,330\nHere we're grouping things\ntogether by like defect or cause.\n\n549\n00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,740\nSo trying to collect that together to\nfind out where most of our issues are.\n\n550\n00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,372\nFitting d diagrams are pretty useful for\nthat.\n\n551\n00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:12,570\nPDPC, it's quite the mouthful,\n\n552\n00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,410\nthat's the process decision product chart.\n\n553\n00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,120\nWhen we go through a process,\n\n554\n00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,600\nthere's certain decisions that\nare made as we go through.\n\n555\n00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,050\nHow do we know that, right?\n\n556\n00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,980\nWell, most commonly,\nwe know that thanks to a flow chart.\n\n557\n00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,660\nAnd in the flow chart, they just kind of\nrepresenting here, is you make decisions.\n\n558\n00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,560\nHere's decision number one,\nis the answer yes or no?\n\n559\n00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,940\nIf it's yes, you go this way.\n\n560\n00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940\nIf it's no, you go this way, all right?\n\n561\n00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,630\nSo you said no.\n\n562\n00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,540\nHere you are.\n\n563\n00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,300\nNow here's question number two.\n\n564\n00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,980\nBased on what you get here,\nis it yes or no?\n\n565\n00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,010\nYes you go here, no you go here.\n\n566\n00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:49,500\nAnd you go through and it's guiding you\non the decision that you need to make.\n\n567\n00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,640\nYou see these in audits a lot, right?\n\n568\n00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,560\nSo you'll see maybe you're manufacturing\n\n569\n00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,600\nsome kind of pipe and\nthe pipe has to meet certain standards.\n\n570\n00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,610\nSo question number one, does the pipe's\nmeasurements match the specifications?\n\n571\n00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,850\nIs it so and so long?\n\n572\n00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,060\nIs it so and so wide?\n\n573\n00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,620\nAre the walls so and so thick?\n\n574\n00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,420\nYes or no.\n\n575\n00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,180\nOkay.\n\n576\n00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,940\nIf yes, move on to the next thing.\n\n577\n00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,862\nHow much pressure is\nthe pipe able to withstand?\n\n578\n00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:20,870\nCan it withstand 800 PSI or\nwhatever it is that we've rated it for?\n\n579\n00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,150\nIf yes, you move on and\n\n580\n00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,370\nif you get a bunch of yeses,\nthe audit passes and you're done.\n\n581\n00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,770\nBut if you get a no, it then moves you\nover and it says fill out this form,\n\n582\n00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,290\nreach out to this person,\ntake this action.\n\n583\n00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:35,120\nBecause there's a problem in our\nmanufacturing process, right?\n\n584\n00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,520\nBy having a decision chart like this,\nit takes the guess work out and\n\n585\n00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,400\nit insures consistent action\nwhen a defect is detected.\n\n586\n00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,180\nSo, people don't have to think too much,\nthey just go right down the chart.\n\n587\n00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,780\nYou see this, I'm gonna say it and\nit's gonna sound mean,\n\n588\n00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,240\nyou see this in the military a lot.\n\n589\n00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,850\nAll right.\n\n590\n00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,390\nAnd it's not because people can't\nindependently think in the military.\n\n591\n00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,440\nThere are brilliant\npeople in the military.\n\n592\n00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,330\nBut when you are under duress, when you're\nin combat situations, when you're in\n\n593\n00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,710\na submarine that is underwater and\na rupture happens, you don't wanna\n\n594\n00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:12,600\nhave to go through a lot of thought and\ndecision making, and all that on your own.\n\n595\n00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,620\nIf you have a chart that just\nwalks you through step by step,\n\n596\n00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,090\nhere's is this happening?\n\n597\n00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,330\nYes or no?\nAll right, yes it's happening.\n\n598\n00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,480\nIs this also happening right,\n\n599\n00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,110\nif these two things are related\nthen this is the action you take.\n\n600\n00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:27,370\nBy telling you exactly what to do you\nensure quick, consistent action and\n\n601\n00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,400\nit can be the difference between life and\ndeath in the military.\n\n602\n00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,030\nNow here at ITPro TV it's not life and\ndeath, but\n\n603\n00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:38,190\nit can be the difference between resolving\nan issue when I manufacture one episode,\n\n604\n00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,890\nversus resolving the issue after we've\nalready manufactured a hundred episode.\n\n605\n00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,780\nSo we need that kind of decision\ntree that's what a PDPC does.\n\n606\n00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,890\nWe also have inter relationship\ndiagraphs and a Ronnie were joking and\n\n607\n00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,250\nI were joking around about this earlier,\nI've never used the word diagraph ever,\n\n608\n00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,510\nbut it's a combination of a graph and\na diagram.\n\n609\n00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,600\nThey got them together\nwith a bottle of wine and\n\n610\n00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,960\nall of a sudden you get a diagraph.\n\n611\n00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,700\nAnd what it is is an absolute mess.\n\n612\n00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,620\nIt's where you basically plot out\nthe various causes and effects and\n\n613\n00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,200\nyou map them together.\n\n614\n00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,130\nOne thing is related to another,\nleads to another, leads to another.\n\n615\n00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,380\nAnd so you kind of map it.\n\n616\n00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,200\nThe problem is that you can have so\n\n617\n00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,560\nmany interrelationships that it gets to\nbe a mess and that's what you see here.\n\n618\n00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,420\nI had a student years ago who said Don,\n\n619\n00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,990\nas I learn about the PNP I can see\na lot of times where one process\n\n620\n00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,280\nis an output that then becomes and\ninput for another process.\n\n621\n00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:42,141\nSo could we create a flow chart of all 47\nprocesses and see what it would look like?\n\n622\n00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:44,789\nStart to finish which one's\noutput to which one's in?\n\n623\n00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:50,110\nAnd I said, you can except it\nbecomes a giant spaghetti mess.\n\n624\n00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,350\nA whole big picture, if you try to\nput together is an absolute wreck.\n\n625\n00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,100\nAnd you'll see that if we go through,\n\n626\n00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,230\nlet me see if I can find\none in the book real quick.\n\n627\n00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,810\nThe PMI actually maps some out in here.\n\n628\n00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,860\nWell, I saw looking there,\nsee what they're doing here?\n\n629\n00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,120\nThey're showing planned\nquality management.\n\n630\n00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,080\nAnd all of these processes here,\n\n631\n00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,760\nhave outputs that feed into\nplan quality management.\n\n632\n00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,750\nAnd then Plan Quality Management creates\noutputs that feed into different things.\n\n633\n00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,150\nAnd so they've tried to map it here,\nbut they just took a small portion.\n\n634\n00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,878\nBecause if they did the whole thing,\n\n635\n00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:28,590\nwell there's five different\nprocesses feeding into this one.\n\n636\n00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,240\nAnd each of these feed\ninto other processes too.\n\n637\n00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,040\nSo, it does become a giant arrow mess.\n\n638\n00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:39,150\nThat's what we're seeing in that diagraph,\nthe interrelational diagraph.\n\n639\n00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,140\nWhich I've now lost.\n\n640\n00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,550\nShoot, what page was that on?\n\n641\n00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,310\nRodney, did you see?\n\n642\n00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,890\n>> I don't.\nI think, it was further down.\n\n643\n00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,970\n>> Well, daggomit.\n\n644\n00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:48,510\nYou know what?\n\n645\n00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,930\nWe can probably just search for\nthe word digraph,\n\n646\n00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:54,060\ncuz I can't imagine,\nthat's used anywhere else in the book.\n\n647\n00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,750\nOr I can lose my file altogether.\n\n648\n00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,990\nThere's that.\n\n649\n00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,550\nBut, you know what,\nI searched in the wrong thing.\n\n650\n00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,620\nThere we go, all right?\n\n651\n00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,160\nSo, that's what the digraph\nis trying to show.\n\n652\n00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,110\nAnd you can see it right there.\n\n653\n00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,670\nI mean, look at that.\n\n654\n00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,880\nIt looks like an absolute mess.\n\n655\n00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,460\nJust everything is kind of\nthrown all over the place.\n\n656\n00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,620\nAnd it can be useful,\njust trying to chart it out.\n\n657\n00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,420\nBut, a lot of times it gets messy fast.\n\n658\n00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,694\n>> Even the PMP states that,\nlimit it to 50.\n\n659\n00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:23,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Once you get beyond 50.\n\n660\n00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,670\nThis is just gonna be a complete and\ntotal mess.\n\n661\n00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,780\nSo again, even PMP doesn't say\ndon't try and do it for everything.\n\n662\n00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,550\n>> We also have tree diagrams.\n\n663\n00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,790\nTree diagrams are basically like the PDPC,\n\n664\n00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,455\nthese guys up here,\njust like that except turned on its side.\n\n665\n00:33:38,455 --> 00:33:38,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n666\n00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,430\n>> So one thing leads to another and\nit kinda branches out,\n\n667\n00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,030\nuntil you get to your\nfinal decision point.\n\n668\n00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,170\nWe've got Prioritization Matrices,\nall right?\n\n669\n00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,780\nSo as we branch out, and\nwe come to our various solutions,\n\n670\n00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,100\nthere may be more than one action to take.\n\n671\n00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,650\nAnd so we prioritize them.\n\n672\n00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,900\nSo here's action number one,\nand action number two, and\n\n673\n00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,300\nthey should be taken in this order\nuntil you resolve the problem.\n\n674\n00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,720\nAction number one is the highest priority,\nit will likely resolve your problem.\n\n675\n00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,090\nBut if it doesn't,\nhere's action number two.\n\n676\n00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,500\nSo action number one,\nreach out to the working on the field,\n\n677\n00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,320\nget them them fix it, all right?\n\n678\n00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,300\nIf that doesn't work action number two,\ngo to the functional manager.\n\n679\n00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,630\nIf that doesn't work, action number three,\nsubmit a change ticket, right?\n\n680\n00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,107\nSo, you kind of go through this process of\nwhat to do based on prioritized entries.\n\n681\n00:34:24,012 --> 00:34:26,010\nWe also have our network diagrams.\n\n682\n00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,130\nNow, we took a look at those back\nin the scheduling side of things.\n\n683\n00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:33,100\nThe project schedule network diagram or\nPSND.\n\n684\n00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,400\nAnd what it's just showing is,\n\n685\n00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,030\nhow each issue of our various\nactivities inter-relate.\n\n686\n00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:41,570\nThese are useful for quality assurance\nbecause you may have quality entries built\n\n687\n00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,974\ninto here, but also knowing that if one\nactivity has an issue, see the ones that\n\n688\n00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:49,680\nfollow it, to see how they're going\nto be affected by that issue.\n\n689\n00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:54,600\nAnd then good old\nfashioned Matrix Diagrams.\n\n690\n00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,230\nAny kind of matrix where you\nplot out your various rankings.\n\n691\n00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,450\nOn a scale of one to ten or\none to six or whatever.\n\n692\n00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,890\nWhere does this activity rank, and\nyou go through and do your rankings.\n\n693\n00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,940\nI usually use checklists,\nbut these are effective too.\n\n694\n00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,460\nIt's up to you,\nto choose which ones you want.\n\n695\n00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,160\nSo these are some of\nthe different tools we use,\n\n696\n00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,530\nwhen it comes to measuring quality and\nproviding quality assurance, right?\n\n697\n00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,300\nDoing things ahead of time.\n\n698\n00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,250\nYou just manufactured one pipe.\n\n699\n00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,030\nGo ahead and run it through these checks,\n\n700\n00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,050\nbecause you don't wanna manufacture\na thousand more pipes and seed them.\n\n701\n00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,490\nA great example of this,\n\n702\n00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:36,870\nI had a friend who manufactured rifles, he\nwould create and he built target rifles.\n\n703\n00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,370\nAnd when you build a firearm.\n\n704\n00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:45,120\nIf you think about how a rifle works,\nyou put a cartridge into the chamber,\n\n705\n00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,850\nand a chemical explosion happens inside\nof that chamber causing the bullet to go.\n\n706\n00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,940\nSo, he's building a device that's designed\nto have an explosion inside of it.\n\n707\n00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,590\nAny weakness in the metal could result in\n\n708\n00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,300\nthe thing-\n>> Blowing up.\n\n709\n00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,453\n>> Yeah.\nIt could cuz injury, death,\n\n710\n00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,770\nit's a significant thing.\n\n711\n00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,370\nSo, when he would manufacture a rifle,\n\n712\n00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,440\nhe had certain devices that he would\nattach to the barrel and to the chamber.\n\n713\n00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,950\nWhere he could measure the thickness and\n\n714\n00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,180\nstrength of the walls,\nbefore he even fired that first shot.\n\n715\n00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:20,350\nBut then when he would take it to actually\ntest it, he would fire one round and\n\n716\n00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,490\none round only, and\nmake sure that it went, right?\n\n717\n00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:26,370\nAnd then he would fire two rounds and two\nrounds only, to make sure it could cycle.\n\n718\n00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,970\nAnd so he had this process\nthat he went through, and\n\n719\n00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,690\nthat was how he quality checked each\nof the rifles that he manufactured.\n\n720\n00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,310\nIt was a good system.\n\n721\n00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,100\nIt was time consuming, but\nit ensured that if there was a fault,\n\n722\n00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,820\nhe could detect it before the weapon was\nsold, instead of detecting it afterwards.\n\n723\n00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,780\nDo you see that with cars?\n\n724\n00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,730\nNobody ever buys a car with\nzero miles on the odometer.\n\n725\n00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,680\nThere's usually at least one mile\non there, cuz they do tests and\n\n726\n00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,790\nthings at the factory\nbefore they roll out.\n\n727\n00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,470\nThat's all a part of quality assurance.\n\n728\n00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:00,175\nAnd they just have charts like this,\nlittle steps they go through,\n\n729\n00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:02,391\nand rev the car up to 60 miles per hour.\n\n730\n00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:03,759\nDoes the engine sound normal?\n\n731\n00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:04,435\nYes.\n\n732\n00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:05,710\nAll right.\nMove onto the next one.\n\n733\n00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,893\nNow rev the car up to 80 miles per hour.\n\n734\n00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,110\nDoes the engine sound normal?\n\n735\n00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:15,090\nOr if it's no then it goes down to here,\nand it says are you feeling a vibration?\n\n736\n00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,250\nDo you hear a knocking noise?\n\n737\n00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,960\nThe different things that you\ncan have it branches out.\n\n738\n00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,470\nThat's how they do the quality assurance?\n\n739\n00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:24,320\nAnother one they don't\ngive us a diagram for,\n\n740\n00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,120\nit's more of a list, is that you\nmight have maintenance procedures.\n\n741\n00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,080\nLet's say that we manufacture blue jeans.\n\n742\n00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,640\nBefore we even manufacture that\nvery first pair of blue jeans,\n\n743\n00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,850\nwe might have somebody go through and\ncheck the machines out.\n\n744\n00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,340\nIs the machine free and clear?\n\n745\n00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,420\nHave the materials been loaded in there?\n\n746\n00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,220\nHas the machine been serviced,\non its regular schedule?\n\n747\n00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,100\nWe have a checklist of\nthings to look out for,\n\n748\n00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,400\nbefore we even flip the power\nbutton to turn it on.\n\n749\n00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,310\nYou run through those checks.\n\n750\n00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,250\nMake sure everything works\nthe way that you want.\n\n751\n00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,400\nAnd then you fire it up.\n\n752\n00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,542\nAgain, all part of quality assurance.\n\n753\n00:38:02,924 --> 00:38:03,712\nAll right.\n\n754\n00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:06,260\nAnd then we've got Process Analysis.\n\n755\n00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,670\nProcess analysis is where we say okay,\nwe've got a process, it works.\n\n756\n00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,650\nIt's doing what we need.\n\n757\n00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,150\nCould we make it better, right?\n\n758\n00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,020\nWe need to analyze the process.\n\n759\n00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,130\nLook at how things are going.\n\n760\n00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,370\nGather the data, right?\n\n761\n00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,750\nWhat are auto, and\nthen evaluate whether there's improvement.\n\n762\n00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,550\nSometimes there is improvement but\n\n763\n00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,250\nthe cost of doing it outweighs\nthe benefit of doing it.\n\n764\n00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,080\nSo we may stop.\n\n765\n00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,140\nOr we may look and it and say,\nyeah, there's some improvement.\n\n766\n00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,240\nLet's come up with\na better way to do this.\n\n767\n00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,530\nSo, that's something that's continual,\nongoing.\n\n768\n00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,540\nWe're always paying attention to.\n\n769\n00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,250\nWhen we perform quality assurance,\nwe have a couple of outputs that come up.\n\n770\n00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,610\nThe most common being a change request.\n\n771\n00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,358\nIf there's a problem,\nwe need to resolve it.\n\n772\n00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:47,940\nWe need to resolve it,\nbefore it becomes a big disaster.\n\n773\n00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,060\nSo a change request is,\nthe number one way to do that.\n\n774\n00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,315\nWe are out of the planning phase now.\n\n775\n00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:54,745\nWe're in execution.\n\n776\n00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:55,785\nSo everything that we've got,\n\n777\n00:38:55,785 --> 00:39:00,315\nour schedule, our budget,\nour requirements, all that is fixed now.\n\n778\n00:39:00,315 --> 00:39:02,285\nSo we wanna live up to that.\n\n779\n00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:06,620\nIf there's a problem that might\neffect schedule, budget, or\n\n780\n00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:11,580\nrequirements then we need to do something\nto fix it, and it might require a change.\n\n781\n00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,420\nWe might need more money to fix a problem,\nor we might need to draw of from our\n\n782\n00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,230\nreserves, or whatever and\na change ticket is how we do that.\n\n783\n00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,200\nWe may also have project\nmanagement plan updates,\n\n784\n00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,590\nif we make changes to those forms,\nthe checklist or whatever.\n\n785\n00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,460\nWe find something that just wasn't on\nthere before we decide to modified it we\n\n786\n00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,180\nneed to go, and update create that and\nso you'll see project updates also.\n\n787\n00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,770\nThat kind of falls under it.\n\n788\n00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,290\nAnd lastly, this is kind of new,\nOrganizational Process Asset Updates.\n\n789\n00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,960\nI don't think we've seen that one yet.\n\n790\n00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,250\nSo, when you're working with\nthings like checklists.\n\n791\n00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,800\nThe odds are, other projects could\nbenefit from those checklists also.\n\n792\n00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,870\nAnd so, we make sure that we create those\nand we make a generic form of them, so\n\n793\n00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,080\nthat other people can use\nthem in their projects.\n\n794\n00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,050\nAnother one is, we should be keeping\nwhat's called a Lessons Learned Log.\n\n795\n00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,700\nAnd we'll talk more about\nthat in the closing phase.\n\n796\n00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,910\nBut it's basically any time something\ndoesn't go the way you planned it,\n\n797\n00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,080\nyou document why it happened,\nand what you did to fix it?\n\n798\n00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,918\nAnd other people can\nbenefit from seeing that.\n\n799\n00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:15,650\nThat becomes an organizational process\nasset, other people will benefit from\n\n800\n00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,700\nlearning what happened to you,\nnot necessarily your mistakes but\n\n801\n00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:24,680\njust things that happen that were\nout of your control in the project.\n\n802\n00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,260\nAll right, and\nthat in a nutshell is quality assurance,\n\n803\n00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,250\nit doesn't sound crazy but\nthat's cuz it really isn't.\n\n804\n00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,930\nAs long as people are doing their checks,\n\n805\n00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,940\nthings are running as they're expected,\nquality assurance is pretty cut and dry.\n\n806\n00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,300\nAll right, Ronnie,\n\n807\n00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,410\ncan you think of anything that\nwe have left out on that one?\n\n808\n00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,350\n>> I don't think so, yeah.\n\n809\n00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,830\n>> All right.\n\n810\n00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:46,570\nWell remember, we're gonna continue\nto revisit quality assurance.\n\n811\n00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,280\nLet me jump back to my big diagram here.\n\n812\n00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,400\nSo, we did quality assurance.\n\n813\n00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,450\nWe still have control quality.\n\n814\n00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,400\nSo, we're gonna jump into quality\ncontrol a little bit later.\n\n815\n00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,980\nSo we've got some more of that,\nbut we're almost done with it.\n\n816\n00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,200\nBut yes, we'll see that.\n\n817\n00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,275\nThe next thing that we're gonna\nbe talking about in our next.\n\n818\n00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:04,105\nEpisode will be dealing with our teams,\n\n819\n00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:08,075\nour project team as well as the actual\nworker bees that we deal with.\n\n820\n00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:11,175\nHow we handle them, there's some\nimportant concepts to understand there?\n\n821\n00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:14,325\nBut, there's not too much\nafter that left for execution.\n\n822\n00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:15,755\nWe're about halfway through it.\n\n823\n00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:18,765\nSo we'll knock those out, and then we'll\nbe ready to move to monitoring and\n\n824\n00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:20,159\ncontrolling, where the real fun starts.\n\n825\n00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,370\nSo, all right, well let's wrap it up here.\n\n826\n00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,690\nI want to remind you guys,\nif you have any questions,\n\n827\n00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,777\nlive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n828\n00:41:29,777 -->

we're doing is another\nsegment as part of our\n\n4\n00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,570\nproject management professional\ncertification series.\n\n5\n00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,710\nAnd we're continuing on with our\narcade cabinet build out project.\n\n6\n00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,940\nSo, in our last special we got a chance\nto see kind of building our charter and\n\n7\n00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,390\nsetting up our initial scope statement,\nwhat it was we wanted to achieve.\n\n8\n00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,940\nAnd today we are going to\nbe going a step further and\n\n9\n00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,490\nactually moving into our planning phase.\n\n10\n00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,230\nNow in a full blown large project,\nthis can be a very drawn out thing.\n\n11\n00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,420\nBut this is a pretty simple project and\n\n12\n00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,230\nI've got the minds right here that\nhave all the information we need.\n\n13\n00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,280\nSo we should be able to at\nleast complete a first pass\n\n14\n00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,560\nof our triple constraints, right.\n\n15\n00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,770\nAnd when I say the triple constraints,\nI'm talking about our requirements,\n\n16\n00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,410\nour budgets and our schedule, right?\n\n17\n00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,680\nSo budget, that's cost, schedule, that's\ntime, and requirements, that's scope.\n\n18\n00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,410\nSo we need to start planning for\nour project to make that.\n\n19\n00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,300\nAnd at this stage one of the tools\nwe use is something called\n\n20\n00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,020\na Work Breakdown Schedule, or\na Work Breakdown Structure,\n\n21\n00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,650\nI gotta get my terms right.\n\n22\n00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,960\nAnd so we need to figure out\nwhen work needs to get done.\n\n23\n00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,610\nAnd so\nwe're going to pick each other's brains.\n\n24\n00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,770\nWe're going to do a little brain storm,\n\n25\n00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,090\nI'm going to use some software\ntools to put all that together.\n\n26\n00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,650\nAnd we're going to formulate that.\n\n27\n00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,805\nNow, one of the first things,\n\n28\n00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:30,081\nI don't know why I didn't think\nabout this before the show.\n\n29\n00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:33,920\nOne of the first things that we need when\nwe're going into the planning phase is\n\n30\n00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,673\nsome of our supporting documents.\n\n31\n00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:39,283\nAnd one of the supporting documents for\nus is going to be our scope statement.\n\n32\n00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:41,121\nSo let me pull that up real quick,\n\n33\n00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:46,040\nI've got that buried in here somewhere in\nmy show notes and all that good stuff.\n\n34\n00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,400\nSo I'm gonna pull up that project charter\n\n35\n00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,010\nthat we made earlier and\nwe signed off on it.\n\n36\n00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,600\nAnd also I'm gonna pull\nthat right up here.\n\n37\n00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,280\nSo, this is what we created\nin that first show.\n\n38\n00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,550\nAnd I know we didn't show it on screen,\nbut I said I was gonna get it signed and\n\n39\n00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,330\nprinted out and stuff.\n\n40\n00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,400\nSo I can see right here\nwe've signed off on this.\n\n41\n00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,712\nAnd Nathan, your signature's awesome.\n\n42\n00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So this is our charter.\n\n43\n00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,690\nThis is that first stab at\nthat scope statement and\n\n44\n00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,520\nthe things that we need to get done.\n\n45\n00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,460\nSo this is really one of the only\nsupporting documents I've got at\n\n46\n00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,290\nthis point.\n\n47\n00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,950\nSo as part of the planning process,\none of our inputs is our organizational\n\n48\n00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,290\nprocess assets and all that other good\nstuff, so we gather what we've got.\n\n49\n00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,955\nRight now this is really\nthe only document that I've got.\n\n50\n00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:36,926\nSo we're gonna go down the line here and\nlook at these requirements and\n\n51\n00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:39,500\nstart to figure out what\nour work needs to be.\n\n52\n00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,070\nAnd from there we can start to\nfigure out what our schedule and\n\n53\n00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,570\nour cost is going to be because\nwe've got a lot of, sort of,\n\n54\n00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,659\nunknowns in our charter\nthe way that it's written.\n\n55\n00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,130\nNow, to help with this,\nI'm going to use some software tools and\n\n56\n00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,510\nit's up to you what software\ntools make life easier.\n\n57\n00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,290\nPersonally I have a number that I go to\nbut for this project we are going to be\n\n58\n00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,750\nusing a project and\ntask management software called Asana.\n\n59\n00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,190\nAsana is something that\nyou introduced me to, Rob.\n\n60\n00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,983\nYou want to give them a little\noverview of what Asana is?\n\n61\n00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:18,465\n>> Well it's like an HTML5 app so\nit's available on the web.\n\n62\n00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,190\nYou can use it in a browser,\nwhich is nice.\n\n63\n00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,040\nAnd you put in tasks and you can assign\ntasks and invite people in on tasks.\n\n64\n00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,020\nYou can add lists to tasks and\ncompletion dates and\n\n65\n00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,870\nall that kind of stuff and create\nprojects and put task in projects, so.\n\n66\n00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,950\n>> And you might ask yourself well Don,\nAsana great,\n\n67\n00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,770\nit looks like a to do list program,\nwhich is kind of how we use it internally.\n\n68\n00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,643\nAnd that's true but the cool thing about\nAsana is they have all sorts of add ons.\n\n69\n00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:47,126\nAnd I like to combine it with\nanother site called Instagantt.\n\n70\n00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,428\nAnd what it allows you to do is\nto take your Asana projects and\n\n71\n00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:52,390\nturn them into Gantt charts like what\nwe're used to in project management.\n\n72\n00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,490\nSo we're gonna get a chance to use\nthat and kind of build this out.\n\n73\n00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,490\nBut in this stage of the game,\n\n74\n00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,280\nour first planning meeting, normally,\nI mean you might not even have a computer.\n\n75\n00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,382\nYou might just do a notepad\nbecause we just need to figure\n\n76\n00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:06,165\nout what works needs to be done.\n\n77\n00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:08,024\nSo guys,\nlet's approach it from that angle, right?\n\n78\n00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:11,605\nI'm not worried about cost or\ntime just yet.\n\n79\n00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,860\nLet's just talk about what\nwork needs to get done.\n\n80\n00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,886\nSo create that final product,\nthat final product for us is a functional\n\n81\n00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:24,777\narcade cabinet and in our requirements we\nspecify kind of what it had to do, right?\n\n82\n00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:27,910\nThat was going to provide\nthat real arcade feel.\n\n83\n00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,440\nIt was gonna run.\n\n84\n00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,380\n>> HyperSpin.\n\n85\n00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,420\n>> And MAME, right?\n\n86\n00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,450\nThere's a couple of the software\nproducts that it was gonna run, and\n\n87\n00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,590\nthat it was gonna done by June 31st.\n\n88\n00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,181\nOkay?\nSo that was our plan, at least initially.\n\n89\n00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:45,431\nSo, now, let's talk about,\na little bit about watching live,\n\n90\n00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:48,308\nyou might know that it is after June 31st.\n\n91\n00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:53,132\n[LAUGH] Actually, there wasn't even\na June 31st this year, was there?\n\n92\n00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:55,383\nThere's only 30 days in June,\nso that was a stupid date.\n\n93\n00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:58,612\n>> That's our loophole.\n\n94\n00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:00,934\n>> It means it hasn't come yet!\n\n95\n00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,200\nThat's true.\n\n96\n00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,240\nAll right, so,\nlet's just talk about real general stuff.\n\n97\n00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,130\nI'm thinking about deliverables.\n\n98\n00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,970\nWhenever you have a project, it's a good\nidea to break it up into pieces, and\n\n99\n00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,890\nthat way you can tackle\nthe pieces individually,\n\n100\n00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,960\nit makes it a lot more easy to manage.\n\n101\n00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,660\nSo I could just say there's one big thing,\nfinish the cabinet, and that's it.\n\n102\n00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,970\nBut I took a stab last night, and\nthis was just using my uneducated,\n\n103\n00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,520\nI've never built an arcade cabinet,\nyou know, my mind.\n\n104\n00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,620\nAnd I kinda broke it into five pieces,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,179\n>> Okay.\n>> So the way I saw it was the cabinet\n\n106\n00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:36,230\nitself, the giant wooden cabinet\nwith the speakers in it and stuff.\n\n107\n00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,790\nThere's that piece.\n\n108\n00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,700\nThen there's the control surface\nthat has all the circuitry and\n\n109\n00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,970\nwires, buttons and joysticks.\n\n110\n00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,650\nThen there's the PC hardware\nthat's gonna drive this stuff.\n\n111\n00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,623\nAnd then there's the software\non the PC itself.\n\n112\n00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:54,223\nAnd then finally we just bring those\nfour components together and we're done.\n\n113\n00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,384\n>> Yeah we should be done.\n\n114\n00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:59,192\n>> So does that sound accurate to you\nguys as far as like the four main pieces\n\n115\n00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,657\nin the final deliverable.\n\n116\n00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:01,631\nWould you guys agree with that?\n\n117\n00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:02,351\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n118\n00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:03,020\n>> I think it's pretty good.\n\n119\n00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,610\n>> Can you think of anything else?\n\n120\n00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,170\nLike that we might break down?\n\n121\n00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,196\n>> Nah, I mean there's only so much we\ncan do to have a cabinet working and\n\n122\n00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,385\nI think those are pretty good.\n\n123\n00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:15,680\n>> All right.\n\n124\n00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,170\nSo, let's take a look at\neach one of these then.\n\n125\n00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,065\nSo, for the cabinet.\n\n126\n00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:20,637\n>> Yeah.\n\n127\n00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:23,174\n>> So, to build out the actual cabinet,\nI know, Rob,\n\n128\n00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,016\nyou've been working on some blueprints,\nsome designs.\n\n129\n00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:26,610\n>> Right.\n\n130\n00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,400\nSo we had an initial design from\nthe project that you found.\n\n131\n00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,259\nBut we had to adapt it for our screen\nbecause, you know the screen is a certain\n\n132\n00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,083\nsize and make some adjustments to\nthe control surface and stuff like that.\n\n133\n00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,308\nAnd also shrink the size\nof it a little bit so\n\n134\n00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:44,270\nthat it fit better in our environment.\n\n135\n00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,477\n>> [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n136\n00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:49,743\nSo we had to design\nmodifications to the designer.\n\n137\n00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,224\n>> So I'm gonna say, I'm gonna add this as\na test even though you've already done it\n\n138\n00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:54,238\nat this point, right?\n\n139\n00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:54,887\n>> Right.\n\n140\n00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:56,102\n>> But I want to keep track of that so\n\n141\n00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:58,450\nI'm aware of the hours that you\nput into the project and so on.\n\n142\n00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,570\nSo I'm gonna add that as an entry here.\n\n143\n00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:06,510\nSo we need to adapt our existing\ndesign to meet our needs, right?\n\n144\n00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,772\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I'm just kind of going high\n\n145\n00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:09,679\nlevel here.\n\n146\n00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,609\nYou might want to go a little\nmore in In depth because Rob,\n\n147\n00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:12,990\nyou had a lot of good information there.\n\n148\n00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,401\nYou said the existing plans called for,\n\n149\n00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:20,827\nit was a four by three monitor\nwas the problem right?\n\n150\n00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:21,617\n>> Right.\n\n151\n00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:27,338\n>> Whereas they only sell\nsixteen by nine monitors today.\n\n152\n00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,565\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we had to make some adaptations.\n\n153\n00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:33,325\nSo you might want to put those entries\nin there as part of your record keeping.\n\n154\n00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:37,150\nYou know, why did we have to adapt\nthose existing designs, all right.\n\n155\n00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,000\nSo that's one thing that needs to be done.\n\n156\n00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,400\nAnd once the designs are done,\nthen I know you already had an entry.\n\n157\n00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,720\nWe need to get materials.\n\n158\n00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,077\n>> Well, right.\n\n159\n00:07:48,077 --> 00:07:51,857\nEven before we got materials though,\nyou may want to put in that we have to,\n\n160\n00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:54,978\nwell at some point this is like\ngetting into the minutia of it.\n\n161\n00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:56,686\nBut I have to take the designs and\n\n162\n00:07:56,686 --> 00:08:00,493\nthen fit them on the material sizes\nlike kind of do this layout pattern.\n\n163\n00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:02,792\nOkay, how does this How am I\ngonna cut out all these pieces?\n\n164\n00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:07,788\nThat's sort of in my in\nthe micro management of\n\n165\n00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:11,840\nthat task for building a cabinet.\n\n166\n00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,650\n>> You do that before\nyou got the materials?\n\n167\n00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,680\n>> Somewhere in here.\n\n168\n00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,800\nCause I know how big the materials are so\nI don't have to wait until I get them.\n\n169\n00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,350\nAt some point.\n\n170\n00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,420\n>> What would you call that?\n\n171\n00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,630\nCreating your cutting templates?\n\n172\n00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,390\n>> It's a cut list.\n\n173\n00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,660\nYeah.\nIt's creating a cut list.\n\n174\n00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,370\n>> All right.\n\n175\n00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,650\nAnd that's going to help you\nto judge exactly how many\n\n176\n00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,840\n>> The yield and how many pieces.\n\n177\n00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,480\nIf I can get these two big pieces out\nof the side of this, I'll go ahead and\n\n178\n00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,270\nblock those out.\n\n179\n00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,430\nCut those out, and then maybe I can\nget these smaller pieces from that.\n\n180\n00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,220\n>> Okay.\n\n181\n00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,110\nNow You haven't done that yet, right?\n\n182\n00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,620\n>> No.\n\n183\n00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,160\n>> So\nwhen we talk about our materials list\n\n184\n00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,400\nwe're gonna be careful because\nthere's gonna be some assumptions.\n\n185\n00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,730\nWe're going to assume we can get it\ndone with a certain amount of materials,\n\n186\n00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,190\nbut when you design your cut list\nyou might find that it's not enough.\n\n187\n00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,900\n>> Possibly.\n\n188\n00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,090\nBut I usually estimate over\nbecause I usually have\n\n189\n00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,000\na little bit of wood leftover.\n\n190\n00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,530\nOkay.\n\n191\n00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,220\nAnd I was just about to say,\nthat's a common thing.\n\n192\n00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,410\nBecause I think originally you\nsaid we could do this with what?\n\n193\n00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,720\nLike three sheets of MDF?\n\n194\n00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,310\n>> Yep.\n\n195\n00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,800\n>> So we have to make a decision.\n\n196\n00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,270\nDo we go with three sheets of MDF and\n\n197\n00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,460\nthen say there might be a case\nwhere we need a fourth one?\n\n198\n00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,610\nOr do we go with four sheets of MDF and\n\n199\n00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,680\nit might be the case where\nwe only need three, right?\n\n200\n00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,560\nWhich do we want to go.\n\n201\n00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,570\n>> Depends on the lead time for\nthe product or how expensive it is.\n\n202\n00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,960\n>> Right.\n>> And the MDF is not terribly\n\n203\n00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,800\nexpensive and it's readily available.\n\n204\n00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,170\n>> It's 35 dollars a sheet and\nit's always in stock.\n\n205\n00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,910\n>> So in a scenario like this what\nI'd say is, let's just go with three.\n\n206\n00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,490\n>> Right.\nAnd\n\n207\n00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,900\nthen if we need one,\nI'll have a reserve budget.\n\n208\n00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,860\nI'll have $35 in a reserve that says, if\nwe need to port them, we'll just run and\n\n209\n00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,990\ngrab one and it's not gonna slow us down.\n\n210\n00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> But if it was something we had to\n\n211\n00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,340\nspecial order, and\n\n212\n00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,880\nwas going to take weeks to get here,\nI'd say let's go ahead and buy it.\n\n213\n00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:56,790\nAnd we might just end up\nhaving to eat the $35, but\n\n214\n00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,180\nwill ensure we don't get behind schedule.\n\n215\n00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,310\n>> Okay.\n>> So, you're gonna create a cut list for\n\n216\n00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,930\nthe materials and\nthen we'll get the materials.\n\n217\n00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,840\nAnd I think you actually broke it down,\nyou did.\n\n218\n00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:14,500\nSo you put 3 sheets of\n3/4\" MDF at 4' by 8'.\n\n219\n00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,182\nCastors, how many castors?\n\n220\n00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,073\nFour or?\n\n221\n00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,407\n>> Four castors.\n\n222\n00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:18,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n223\n00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,600\n>> Two that rotate and\ntwo that are straight.\n\n224\n00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,223\nIt makes it easier to drive.\n\n225\n00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:29,322\n>> Two buy rotating castors and\ntwo buy fixed castors.\n\n226\n00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:36,540\nAm I spelling that right?\n\n227\n00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,110\nYes.\n\n228\n00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,780\n>> Yep.\n>> There, okay.\n\n229\n00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,529\nI can't see that on your screen.\n\n230\n00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,259\nI was going to say it's on\na big monitor right there.\n\n231\n00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,070\nHe has to look at it through Apple.\n\n232\n00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,620\nRob, I know there were a few other\nthings you talked to me about\n\n233\n00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,860\n>> Outside of the projects,\n\n234\n00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,660\nsome of our water cooler conversations.\n\n235\n00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,084\nThat you needed a router bit.\n\n236\n00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,840\n>> For the team holding.\n\n237\n00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,960\nAnd then I have some scrap\nthree quarter ply wood for\n\n238\n00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,959\nthe base that castors can attach to,\nI can use that because.\n\n239\n00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,080\nBut I don't know how that\nfits into our project.\n\n240\n00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,910\n>> So you've got it.\n\n241\n00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,030\nIf we didn't have it you'd be able\nto acquire it pretty easily, right?\n\n242\n00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,590\n>> Yes.\n>> And\n\n243\n00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,020\nthat's even less expensive\nthan MDF isn't it?\n\n244\n00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,180\n>> Now it's actually a little more.\n\n245\n00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,880\n>> Oh is it really?\n\n246\n00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,610\n>> Yeah, it's like 10 or $15 more.\n\n247\n00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,730\nIt's probably 40.\n\n248\n00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,790\nBecause it's cabinet grade.\n\n249\n00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,460\n>> Okay.\n>> Cabinet grade plywood.\n\n250\n00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,290\n>> And you're certain you have enough or?\n\n251\n00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,230\n>> Yes, I'm certain.\n\n252\n00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,120\n>> Okay.\n\n253\n00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,930\nIf you're certain,\n\n254\n00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,621\nthen I'm not going to worry about building\nin contingencies on it or whatever.\n\n255\n00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:36,840\n>> Okay.\n\n256\n00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,810\nAll right.\n\n257\n00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,242\nNow, we also needed T molding.\n\n258\n00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,630\nRight?\nAnd how much of that did we need?\n\n259\n00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,410\n>> Did we get 50 feet or 40 feet?\n\n260\n00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,430\nI think we.\n\n261\n00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,330\n>> 50 feet or 40 feet?\n\n262\n00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,400\n>> I think it was 50 feet.\n\n263\n00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,200\n>> Yeah, because it was 46 or\nsomething like that.\n\n264\n00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,160\nBut you can get bulk and fitting.\n\n265\n00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,180\nIt has a lead time on it.\n\n266\n00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,919\nIt's pretty cheap to we just\nwent ahead and went to 50.\n\n267\n00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,495\n>> All right.\n\n268\n00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:02,295\nSo it's already been ordered.\n\n269\n00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:08,948\nBut I'm just gonna add some little notes\nhere just to make sure I've got them.\n\n270\n00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:12,530\nWe need 40 feet but not available in bulk.\n\n271\n00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,990\nUnder 50 feet and do you remember\nwhat the lead time is on that?\n\n272\n00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,450\n>> It took like a week to get it at least.\n\n273\n00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,100\n>> Okay so one week lead time.\n\n274\n00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,660\n>> Hm.\n>> All right so\n\n275\n00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,870\njust making notes as I go so\nI've got a record of this.\n\n276\n00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,042\nRight that is important\nwe'll need to remember that.\n\n277\n00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:36,680\nAll right so other materials\nthat we might need, what else?\n\n278\n00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,900\n>> Well are we going account the kind of\ngraphics and that kind of stuff in here?\n\n279\n00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,090\nBecause that was kind of like content to\nlike if we could do it we were going to\n\n280\n00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,580\nbut it wasn't required.\n\n281\n00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,840\n>> Yeah so we can, we certainly can.\n\n282\n00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,720\nIt is an optional thing so\nwe could move that off\n\n283\n00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,280\n>> There's a separate entity altogether.\n\n284\n00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,619\nSo I can come in here and\ncreate a new section, which I'll call like\n\n285\n00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:05,410\nOptional Activities.\n\n286\n00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,740\nAnd, oh shoot, I'm messing up our stuff.\n\n287\n00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,210\nI'll just move this.\n\n288\n00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,019\nActually, you know what,\nmaybe I'll stick it right here.\n\n289\n00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:19,980\n>> So, under optional we had,\nthe arcade graphics.\n\n290\n00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,140\nSo we need to design the arcade graphics.\n\n291\n00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,450\n>> Correct\n>> And\n\n292\n00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:34,770\nthen we need to have them printed\n>> And then we need to apply them.\n\n293\n00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,781\nAll right, so let's leave those\nreal high level for right now,\n\n294\n00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,190\njust causeit is optional activities.\n\n295\n00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,790\nAnd we'll come back to that one later.\n\n296\n00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,220\nOn actually constructing the cabinet,\nwe've got adapt the existing design,\n\n297\n00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,900\ncreate a cut list, get the materials.\n\n298\n00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,810\n>> And then construction.\n\n299\n00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,680\n>> And then once we've got the materials,\nnow what?\n\n300\n00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,170\n>> Cut them out.\n\n301\n00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:57,780\n>> Yep.\n\n302\n00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,000\nAnd then assemble.\n\n303\n00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,650\n>> Yep.\n\n304\n00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,640\n>> And then we need to decide\nif we're gonna paint before\n\n305\n00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,006\nNate puts any of the buttons and\nstuff like that on it.\n\n306\n00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:11,320\n>> Mm.\n\n307\n00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,091\nYeah.\n>> It's probably easiest to assemble it\n\n308\n00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:17,680\nflat when it's not\n>> Actually put together.\n\n309\n00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,089\n>> So were we painting or\nwere we doing a laminate?\n\n310\n00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,090\nWell we wouldn't laminate everywhere.\n\n311\n00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,320\n>> That's right and the MDF is flat so\nwe can just paint it right?\n\n312\n00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,730\n>> It is, yeah it's very paintable.\n\n313\n00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,240\n>> Okay, so paint and\nthat's pretty much done right?\n\n314\n00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n315\n00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,550\n>> So those are the main activities for\nbuilding the cabinet.\n\n316\n00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,220\n>> Correct.\n\n317\n00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,010\n>> Alright,\nnow here's the most challenging part about\n\n318\n00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,130\nmaking a work breakdown\nstructure is where to stop.\n\n319\n00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,700\nBecause we can keep doing decomposition.\n\n320\n00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,070\nWe can take some of these say our\ncut pieces, let's break that down.\n\n321\n00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,020\nAnd you can start to micromanage but\nI like to apply the 8-80 rule.\n\n322\n00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,640\nDon't put things in here that\nare under 8 hours, don't but\n\n323\n00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,360\nthings in here that are over 80 hours.\n\n324\n00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360\nTry to fall in that window.\n\n325\n00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,080\nLooking at this list, Rob, do any of\nthese seem like they are over 8 hours?\n\n326\n00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,850\nI don't think they are\n>> I don't think so,\n\n327\n00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,330\nI think they're all kind\nof under that level,\n\n328\n00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,190\nso I don't want to decompose\nanymore than what they are.\n\n329\n00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,580\nNow we might come back and add some\nmore information, time estimates and\n\n330\n00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,460\nthings like that.\n\n331\n00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,110\nBut let's continue on with\nsome of these other ones.\n\n332\n00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,910\nThe control surface is the next piece,\nand I know with it, are we\n\n333\n00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,610\nmodifying the design or are we going\nwith the original design on that one.\n\n334\n00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,470\nWe've modified it because we had some\nquestions about the positions of\n\n335\n00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,660\nthe controllers and how the people\non the ends could see the screen.\n\n336\n00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,760\n>> All right, and then I imagine\nit's kinda like the cabinet.\n\n337\n00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,720\nYou're gonna have to create\na cut list get materials.\n\n338\n00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,230\n>> Correct.\n\n339\n00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,170\n>> The only difference is you're probably\ndoing those together, aren't you?\n\n340\n00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,450\n>> I'll probably cut them,\nwell, it depends on schedule.\n\n341\n00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,220\nI could cut those out ahead of time.\n\n342\n00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,040\nCut them, finish them, and\n\n343\n00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,450\nthen give them to Nate and then\n>> Okay.\n\n344\n00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,360\nfinish the rest, so\nit depends on schedule.\n\n345\n00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,380\n>> That's a good thing to note.\n\n346\n00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,535\nSo what Rob is saying is if we actually\nbuild that control surface first before\n\n347\n00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:07,770\nthe rest of the cabinet We can actually\nmove forward with the hardware pieces,\n\n348\n00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,610\nactually getting things wired,\nand electronic stuff.\n\n349\n00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,220\nBut Nate's gonna take over, and so\n\n350\n00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,550\nthat'll shorten the length\nof our project by doing it.\n\n351\n00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,150\nSo that's a great idea.\n\n352\n00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,100\nSo we'll just add in here the same\n\n353\n00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,836\nentries knowing that they might be\nhandled on a slightly different order.\n\n354\n00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:28,030\nGet materials, cut pieces.\n\n355\n00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,090\nAnd we would probably paint this.\n\n356\n00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,840\n>> I think so.\n\n357\n00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:39,110\n>> So we would assemble the,\nthat's not how you spell symbol.\n\n358\n00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,730\nWe would assemble the board.\n\n359\n00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:47,165\nAnd we would paint it prior to Nate\ninstalling the controls, right?\n\n360\n00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:48,135\n>> I think so.\nWe would make\n\n361\n00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:48,905\na decision to--\n>> Okay.\n\n362\n00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:51,695\n>> If we, It would be hard to go back and\n\n363\n00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:54,925\nadd a graphic after you put\nthe controls on but not impossible.\n\n364\n00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,682\n>> Okay.\n>> So I'm gonna add just a little\n\n365\n00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,323\nnote here.\n\n366\n00:16:57,323 --> 00:17:04,160\nOptional Install graphic overlay.\n\n367\n00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,570\nKnowing that we may or may not have\nthat graphic overlay at this point.\n\n368\n00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,908\nAnd then, install controls.\n\n369\n00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:14,790\nTest.\n\n370\n00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,410\nBecause you're going to have to do some\ntesting and programming and all that.\n\n371\n00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,120\nRight?\n\n372\n00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,520\nYeah, so we'll add that entry there.\n\n373\n00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,030\nOkay so\n\n374\n00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,890\nit's basically the same as the cabinet\njust on a much, much smaller scale.\n\n375\n00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,720\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n376\n00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,660\nwe really would want this to happen first.\n\n377\n00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,000\nNow I'm not worried about\nchronological order at this stage.\n\n378\n00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,695\nI'm just trying to list the work.\n\n379\n00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:35,515\nThat's some of the key components\nabout a work breakdown structure.\n\n380\n00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:36,585\nDon't worry about schedule.\n\n381\n00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:37,715\nDon't worry about budget.\n\n382\n00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:40,931\nWorry about figuring out what\nactual work needs to get done.\n\n383\n00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:43,836\nAll right, PC Hardware.\n\n384\n00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:44,600\n>> Mh-mm.\n\n385\n00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,601\nSo we need to procure a PC.\n\n386\n00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,157\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now we've already got the PC,\n\n387\n00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:51,070\nit's actually one of\nthe ones here in the studio.\n\n388\n00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,550\nBut, I'm gonna put this\nin an entry because\n\n389\n00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,670\nI wanna be able to track the material and,\nagain, tracking our budget and cost.\n\n390\n00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,370\nAll right.\n\n391\n00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,908\nWe need to reinstall an operating system\n>> Install,\n\n392\n00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:07,580\nthe arcade.\n\n393\n00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,200\nWe would add Hyperspin right?\n\n394\n00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,490\nInstall Hyperspin.\n\n395\n00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:10,990\n>> Yep.\n\n396\n00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,540\n>> Well, there's also a PC software sign.\n\n397\n00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,080\nIs that like the inuation stuff?\n\n398\n00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,950\n>> No, you are right.\n\n399\n00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,530\nI'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n400\n00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,180\nOn the PC hardware side, good point, Nate.\n\n401\n00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,810\nI'm just going to move this\ndown to the PC software side.\n\n402\n00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,280\nOkay, on the hardware side, all right.\n\n403\n00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,410\nProcure a PC, we need to procure-\n>> Hard drive space.\n\n404\n00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,710\nWe need that.\nMakes sure we have enough, well-\n\n405\n00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,510\n>> They kind of fall into the PC.\n\n406\n00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,080\nWe can kinda list that with our\nminimum specs, or whatever.\n\n407\n00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,580\nBut-\n>> Oh, right.\n\n408\n00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,770\n>> But, again, since we've got one we're\n\n409\n00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,710\nkind of covered.\n\n410\n00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,500\nWe're gonna procure Arcade controls and\ninterface boards.\n\n411\n00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,930\nWe've got a good bit that's\ngoing to happen there.\n\n412\n00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,780\nAnd then we need to assemble.\n\n413\n00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,750\nAll right.\n\n414\n00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,360\nIt seems small, but\nit's actually a good bit of work.\n\n415\n00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,080\nRight?\n\n416\n00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,480\nProcure the PC.\n\n417\n00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,270\nI'm gonna come in here and\njust add what our requirements here.\n\n418\n00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,340\nSo we need a dual core processor.\n\n419\n00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,020\nWe need at least what 2 gigs of ram,\nis that what we said?\n\n420\n00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,900\n>> Four gigs.\n>> Four gigs.\n\n421\n00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,652\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n422\n00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:25,330\nhow much hard drive space did we decide?\n\n423\n00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,110\n>> A terabyte [LAUGH] all\nthe little movies and everything.\n\n424\n00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,335\nIt takes a lot of space.\n\n425\n00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:32,751\n>> A whole arcade.\n\n426\n00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:35,725\nIf you hade a whole arcade there\nwould not be a terrabyte left.\n\n427\n00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:38,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We need,\n\n428\n00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,250\nfor the control boards don't\nwe need PS2 interfaces?\n\n429\n00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,150\n>> Yes.\nNow, yes.\n\n430\n00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,190\nYeah, the motherboard on\nthe back has the PS2,\n\n431\n00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,959\nbut we'll need those\nlittle breakout boards.\n\n432\n00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,680\n>> Okay, so\nthose are some of the little entries.\n\n433\n00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,330\nAnd I'm just putting\nthem in here as comments,\n\n434\n00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,392\nbecause they're not really sub tasks.\n\n435\n00:19:57,392 --> 00:20:01,480\nAll right but\nunder procure Arcade controls here,\n\n436\n00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,070\nI actually should create some sub tasks.\n\n437\n00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,560\nSo, let's see where's my options.\n\n438\n00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,780\n>> Next to delete date right?\n\n439\n00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,330\nIt's at the top.\n\n440\n00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,110\n>> Where is it?\n\n441\n00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,030\n>> I think it's at the top of\n\n442\n00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,020\nthe menu where-\n>> Near due date?\n\n443\n00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,200\n>> It says unassigned due date and\n\n444\n00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,280\nthe next over is like-\n>> Subtasks.\n\n445\n00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,760\nThere we go perfect.\n\n446\n00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,975\nSo under the subtasks we've got our\nthe Arcade controls themselves.\n\n447\n00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:25,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n448\n00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,148\n>> So we need the Arcade buttons.\n\n449\n00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:30,656\nJoy sticks.\n\n450\n00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:32,000\nIs it called a track ball?\n\n451\n00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,027\n>> I don't know what it's called.\n\n452\n00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:34,730\nTrack ball.\n\n453\n00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,720\n>> What are some of the other components?\n\n454\n00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,159\n>> Breakout boards, I suppose.\n\n455\n00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000\nSo interface the controls\nto the PC itself?\n\n456\n00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,120\n>> There's the interface controller and\n\n457\n00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,180\nthen it's got the two breakout boards,\nright?\n\n458\n00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,689\n>> That's right.\n\n459\n00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:55,730\nAll right, and joystick,\ntrackball, interface\n\n460\n00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,170\n>> Controller and breakout boards.\n\n461\n00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,470\n>> I'm putting this in a high level now.\n\n462\n00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,210\nWhen we worry about budget I'll get you\nto actually give me the itemized list.\n\n463\n00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,860\nHere is exactly what we\nneed in the budget so,\n\n464\n00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,140\njust kinda going high level\nright now to give me an idea.\n\n465\n00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,610\nBecause we'll also need to worry about\nthe lead time on some of this stuff for\n\n466\n00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,390\nordering it.\n\n467\n00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,070\nCause some of the special equipment,\nit'll take a little while to get in.\n\n468\n00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,010\nInterface controller, buttons, joysticks.\n\n469\n00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,940\n>> Now, Don, I don't know does any of\nthis require external power supply or\n\n470\n00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,050\nis it all just going through the PC?\n\n471\n00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,020\n>> It should all go through the PC right?\n\n472\n00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,949\n>> Yeah the trackball does\nneed a power source but\n\n473\n00:21:28,949 --> 00:21:33,845\nwe're gonna use like the bird connector\non our power supply and just feed it.\n\n474\n00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:35,709\n>> Through the PC, I just wasn't sure.\n\n475\n00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:41,564\n>> But you know what, I'm gonna add just\na little note here to double check power\n\n476\n00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:47,680\nrequirements because I know we got that\nPC laying around that we're gonna use.\n\n477\n00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,730\nI don't know what wattage\nthat power supply is.\n\n478\n00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,320\nWe start adding all the stuff,\ndrawing off of it,\n\n479\n00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,460\nwe might need to swap\nout the power supply.\n\n480\n00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,800\n>> Are we going to have one cord that\neverything plugs into out of the back of\n\n481\n00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,130\nthe arcade?\n\n482\n00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,980\nThe monitor will need something.\n\n483\n00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,200\n>> There's a light in\nthe top of the arcade too\n\n484\n00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,410\n>> We can put a power script in there.\n\n485\n00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,530\n>> We'll add that here,\nit's more hardware.\n\n486\n00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,990\nGives it that authentic, archaic feel of\nthe single cord going through the back.\n\n487\n00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,520\n>> All right, and\nassemble we'll leave that be.\n\n488\n00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,000\nSo getting all that installed and\nin place.\n\n489\n00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,830\nNow on the software side,\nwe've got the operating system on the PC.\n\n490\n00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,610\nWe've got Hyperspin.\n\n491\n00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,490\nWhat were some of the other things?\n\n492\n00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,920\nThere were the movies for\nthe nice little screen.\n\n493\n00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,540\n>> Yeah,\nthose movies all fit under Hyperspin.\n\n494\n00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:41,170\nHyperspin will go and sink all of it's\nstuff based on the ROMs that we have,\n\n495\n00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,650\nand kind of configure itself\nbased on what we have.\n\n496\n00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,610\n>> Is there software for\nmanaging the control board?\n\n497\n00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,840\n>> No,\neverything is just straight up hardware,\n\n498\n00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,680\ndip switches, those sorts of things.\n\n499\n00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,730\n>> Okay.\n\n500\n00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,020\nAll right, so I'll leave that be.\n\n501\n00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:00,540\nAll right, and then under Optional\nActivities we've got our graphics overlay.\n\n502\n00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,310\nGet them printed,\n\n503\n00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,650\napply the graphics, those are kind\nof our high level activities.\n\n504\n00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,730\nWere there any other\noptional things that we had?\n\n505\n00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,325\nSeems like there were something.\n\n506\n00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:10,937\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n507\n00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:12,762\n>> Now here's where my memory fails, but\n\n508\n00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:14,806\nwe can go right back to\nour project charter,\n\n509\n00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:17,200\nwhere we get our high level\nrequirements and so on.\n\n510\n00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,670\nSo we've got the wooden cabinet,\nmust support four players, upright.\n\n511\n00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,990\nPC to power the games.\n\n512\n00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,770\nJoystick and track ball.\n\n513\n00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,330\nSo I think we met all that.\n\n514\n00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:32,750\nThat stuff we're not going\nto worry about right now.\n\n515\n00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,640\nAnd let's see.\n\n516\n00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,380\nSelect seller.\n\n517\n00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,920\nWe still haven't done that.\n\n518\n00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,040\nAll right.\n\n519\n00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,400\nSo far it looks like we are okay so far.\n\n520\n00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,510\nAll right.\n\n521\n00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,240\nSo now what we need to do is\nwe need to go back and revise.\n\n522\n00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,360\nJust start evaluating everything.\n\n523\n00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,404\nI wanna work on our schedule.\n\n524\n00:23:51,404 --> 00:23:53,296\nSo we have an idea of what\nthis is actually gonna take.\n\n525\n00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:55,143\nSo we need to think about time.\n\n526\n00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,000\nWe also need to think about budget.\n\n527\n00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,415\nHow much is this stuff gonna cost so\nwe can total that up.\n\n528\n00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:01,126\nNow, I'll tell you guys.\n\n529\n00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,281\nIs not very good at tracking a budget.\n\n530\n00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:06,832\nIt doesn't have a whole lot in here\nas far as costs and so on, but\n\n531\n00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:08,110\nit's great for time.\n\n532\n00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,620\nSo on the scheduling side\nthat's gonna work out well.\n\n533\n00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,330\nOn the requirements side,\nthat's going to be up to me.\n\n534\n00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,920\nTo make sure that everything that's\nlisted here, when it gets finished,\n\n535\n00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,570\nis going to equal out to\nwhat we actually need.\n\n536\n00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,240\nAnd you know on final assembly,\nI didn't really put anything down here but\n\n537\n00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:30,030\nI guess we could put in here install\ncontrol surface into cabinet.\n\n538\n00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,450\nInstall PC components into cabinet.\n\n539\n00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,150\nThat should really be about it.\n\n540\n00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,070\nWire for power.\n\n541\n00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,420\nBut after that our final product\nshould be the arcade cabinet.\n\n542\n00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,633\nSo the last thing that we would really\nhave would be acceptance testing.\n\n543\n00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:52,226\nRight?\n\n544\n00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:54,090\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n545\n00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,860\n>> Test it out.\n\n546\n00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,950\nDoes it meet everything that we\nspecified in our charter and\n\n547\n00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,990\nour requirements document?\n\n548\n00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,140\nSo it's a fancy way of saying, play games?\n\n549\n00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,940\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes.\n\n550\n00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,872\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In this scenario, means to play games.\n\n551\n00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:10,050\n[LAUGH] Sounds so much better that way.\n\n552\n00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:15,300\nAll right, let's take a look at some\nof this stuff and kinda get some ideas.\n\n553\n00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,500\nDo we want to tackle cost or\nschedule first?\n\n554\n00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,140\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n555\n00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,090\n>> Yeah, we can do schedule.\n\n556\n00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,895\n>> Okay, schedule.\n\n557\n00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:24,610\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n558\n00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,960\n>> So, Rob you said you already did adapt\nexisting designs to meet our needs.\n\n559\n00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,780\nAs far as the control service\nof the cabinet, right?\n\n560\n00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,800\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it's really already done.\n\n561\n00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,570\nNow you might ask yourself, why bother\ntracking something that's already done?\n\n562\n00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,130\nAnd the reason is I need to know\nhow much Rob spent on this.\n\n563\n00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,480\nKind of what he did and\nyou know I haven't done it in here but\n\n564\n00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,490\nI need to assign this stuff to you.\n\n565\n00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,780\nSee I need to go through and\nattach some of these to Rob because he is\n\n566\n00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,360\nthe one that's going\nto be dealing with it.\n\n567\n00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,530\nIn fact can I assign\nthe entire section to you?\n\n568\n00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,540\nNah, I'll just make you a follower.\n\n569\n00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,380\nI'm gonna assign these to you,\ncuz you're doing each one of these.\n\n570\n00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,880\nSo let's punch that in there.\n\n571\n00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,380\nThat's going to effect schedule two,\nright?\n\n572\n00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,930\nBecause Rob can only do one thing at\na time, so as we kinda lay things out,\n\n573\n00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,430\nI gotta pay attention to that.\n\n574\n00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,170\nAll right, now for the schedule side,\nI'm gonna jump over to Instagantt and\n\n575\n00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,910\ncome in here and take a look at it.\n\n576\n00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:22,630\nI've made a lot of changes so\nI need to let it refresh.\n\n577\n00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,500\nWell, when it finishes thinking about it.\n\n578\n00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,270\nThere we go.\n\n579\n00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,990\nAll right.\n\n580\n00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,340\nSo get materials, we haven't done.\n\n581\n00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,120\nBut adapt existing designs and\nmeet our needs you've already done that.\n\n582\n00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,580\n>> Right.\n>> Do you remember when you did that?\n\n583\n00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,959\n>> What time period?\n\n584\n00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:46,900\nIt was like over an hour here, hour there.\n\n585\n00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,840\n>> Kind of spread out.\n\n586\n00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,470\n>> Yeah.\n\n587\n00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,830\n>> Well, let's just do this.\n\n588\n00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:55,230\nI'm just gonna take it and\nlet me just shrink it.\n\n589\n00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,260\nWe'll just track it was one day for now.\n\n590\n00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,760\nOh shoot.\n\n591\n00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,410\n>> Get materials\n>> I know I did the wrong one didn't I.\n\n592\n00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,160\nSo, I thought it was there.\n\n593\n00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,930\nSo, what we'll kind of list that\nas adapt existing design there.\n\n594\n00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,120\nSo we've got it, I really just\ngot it flagged as that one and\n\n595\n00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,480\nyou'll see here I can come in here and\nadjust the date or whatever.\n\n596\n00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,030\nInstagantt doesn't really do.\n\n597\n00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,750\nSuper short task.\n\n598\n00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,520\nIf you want things like that\nyou really need to go with\n\n599\n00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,670\nMicrosoft Project or something.\n\n600\n00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,400\nBut for our needs,\ndoing these in one days or\n\n601\n00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,830\nmultiple day intervals,\nis probably suitable for us.\n\n602\n00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,200\nSo get materials.\n\n603\n00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,410\nGetting materials,\nthat's not a big deal at all.\n\n604\n00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,110\nThat's just, now it's all off the shelf.\n\n605\n00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,970\n>> Right.\n\n606\n00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,130\nI think get materials and\ncreate a cut list and cut pieces.\n\n607\n00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,490\nIs one day total between\nall three of those.\n\n608\n00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,710\n>> Between all three.\n\n609\n00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,580\n>> Actually for both cabinets.\n\n610\n00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,720\nThe control surface and\nthat is just not that much.\n\n611\n00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,620\n>> Dang Ron.\n\n612\n00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,350\n>> It's just a bunch of rectangles except\nthe sides of the cabinet are the only\n\n613\n00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,313\ncomplicated shape.\n\n614\n00:27:54,313 --> 00:27:59,190\n>> [LAUGH] All right now assembling\nthe cabinet you said that's just one day?\n\n615\n00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,450\n>> On it's own?\n\n616\n00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:00,950\n>> Or?\n\n617\n00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,120\nWe'll have to see.\n\n618\n00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,720\nYeah.\n\n619\n00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,430\nThat's where you get, I'm not quite\nsure yet because I haven't done it yet.\n\n620\n00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,470\n[LAUGH] I would probably budget it.\n\n621\n00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:18,380\n>> So, do you think it's realistic\nthat we could create our cut list,\n\n622\n00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,740\nacquire the materials, cut the pieces\n>> And assemble the cabinet in two days.\n\n623\n00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,380\n>> Yes.\n\n624\n00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,180\n>> Okay.\n\n625\n00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,510\nSo what I'm going to do is I\"m\njust kinda going to lay this out.\n\n626\n00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,010\nKinda like that.\n\n627\n00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:34,390\nAnd then as far as painting,\nwhat do you think?\n\n628\n00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,780\nPainting another day?\n\n629\n00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,980\n>> Yeah, I think it's gonna\ntake more than one coat.\n\n630\n00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,830\nSo it's going to be like paint,\nlet it dry, flip pieces over, paint,\n\n631\n00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,950\nlet it dry, flip over.\n\n632\n00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,115\nCuz that MDF's gonna soak it up.\n\n633\n00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:47,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n634\n00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,860\n>> All right.\n\n635\n00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,700\nSo there we go on that.\n\n636\n00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:55,130\nAnd you know,\nI'm gonna kinda do some links here.\n\n637\n00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,580\nAnd these guys,\nwill it do a start to start?\n\n638\n00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,920\nOh it will, look at that.\n\n639\n00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,130\nI'm just going to do start to\nstarts on these guys because\n\n640\n00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,110\nthey are really all happening\nat the same time, right?\n\n641\n00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,180\nSo all four of these are really\nhappening at the same time.\n\n642\n00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,710\nWell, I guess adapt existing design.\n\n643\n00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,220\nThat one kind of happened before.\n\n644\n00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,760\n>> Right.\n\n645\n00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,503\n>> So, I mean maybe we should.\n\n646\n00:29:22,915 --> 00:29:27,467\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Remove that link.\n\n647\n00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:35,460\nOkay.\n\n648\n00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,490\nThere.\nSo again different software has much more\n\n649\n00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,100\nadvanced features.\n\n650\n00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,510\nThis one is suitable for what we're doing.\n\n651\n00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,260\nSo okay.\nSo there's kind of our line up on\n\n652\n00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,800\nthe cabinet.\n\n653\n00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,490\nNow you mentioned that\nthe control surface,\n\n654\n00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,240\nwe can go ahead and\ncut that and get that built and\n\n655\n00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,640\nNate can start working on that one while\nyou go back and work on this other stuff.\n\n656\n00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,980\n>> Right.\n>> So, lets just, again, not worrying too\n\n657\n00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,250\nmuch about dates I'm gonna just move this\nahead and say we start that on July 14th.\n\n658\n00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,140\n>> Okay.\n>> The cabinet, but\n\n659\n00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,140\nstart this other stuff\na little bit earlier.\n\n660\n00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,780\nSo let's say adapt the existing\ndesign to meet our needs,\n\n661\n00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,410\nagain, you've really already done that.\n\n662\n00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:08,910\n>> Yep.\n\n663\n00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,160\n>> So maybe I stick that on July 7th.\n\n664\n00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,130\nBut then create cut list, get materials,\ncut pieces, assemble board.\n\n665\n00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,330\n>> Right.\n>> Do you think that's one day for\n\n666\n00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,285\nthe board cuz it's smaller, or two days?\n\n667\n00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:22,955\n>> Oh, it's one day, yeah.\n\n668\n00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,415\n>> One day, okay.\n\n669\n00:30:24,415 --> 00:30:27,195\nSo I'll go ahead and park these.\n\n670\n00:30:27,195 --> 00:30:31,565\n>> Anybody got drill holes for all the\nbuttons, like sand it and stuff, and like,\n\n671\n00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:32,527\ndraw them all out.\n\n672\n00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:36,170\n>> Well, my plan was supposed to\nget a life size print of that.\n\n673\n00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,750\nBecause I have it drawn in CAD.\n\n674\n00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:42,590\nSo I can go and get a print and\njust tape in place.\n\n675\n00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,950\nI just can drill through.\n\n676\n00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,060\n>> Okay, installing the graphics overlay,\n\n677\n00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,260\nthat's actually not\na big deal at all is it.\n\n678\n00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:51,870\n>> No.\n\n679\n00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,850\n>> It's just a matter of whether or\nnot we actually do it.\n\n680\n00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,030\nAnd then installing the controls.\n\n681\n00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,350\nNate, it's a lot of buttons,\nlike 20 buttons.\n\n682\n00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,850\nIt's more than that, isn't it?\n\n683\n00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,600\nIt's like 30 buttons.\n\n684\n00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,480\n>> Quite a few, fortunately it's just\nthrough the hole and a nut in from\n\n685\n00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,019\nthe bottom and the trackball's got three\npieces and a mounting plate and over and\n\n686\n00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:18,500\na plate then the ball itself so there is a\nlot but there's not a lot of pieces to it.\n\n687\n00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,580\nSo yeah, I think you just take a couple\nhours to at least get the buttons\n\n688\n00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,020\ninside and the track ball screwed down.\n\n689\n00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,630\n>> So I'm going to add install controls\nhere and what I'm going to do is\n\n690\n00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,040\nI'm going to go through and I'm going to\nassign that, can I do assignments, yeah.\n\n691\n00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,010\nI'll do it and assign it to you,\nwhoops, there.\n\n692\n00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,430\nAll right, versus these other ones here.\n\n693\n00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:49,900\nThese other ones are really\nbeing assigned to Rob.\n\n694\n00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,383\nAnd is it gonna let me will it just\nlet me assign oh not it won't, shoot.\n\n695\n00:31:55,383 --> 00:31:58,515\nSo, I'm going to assign these other ones\nto [INAUDIBLE] which will probably be\n\n696\n00:31:58,515 --> 00:32:01,465\nfaster for me to jump in and do it in\nasauna itself, but We'll do it here.\n\n697\n00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:03,045\nAll right, so Rob is doing all this work.\n\n698\n00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:07,954\nAnd really even acquiring some of the\nmaterials we could always sub in Nate or\n\n699\n00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:11,300\nRonnie or somebody to run and\nget the materials.\n\n700\n00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:11,900\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n701\n00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,390\nas far as the actual construction stuff,\nwe'll leave that with Rob.\n\n702\n00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:18,423\nAlright.\n\n703\n00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:20,795\nAnd painting, heck, I can paint.\n\n704\n00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:22,175\nI'm not very good at it, but I can do it.\n\n705\n00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:26,165\n>> You could probably just get\na roller and some paint and\n\n706\n00:32:26,165 --> 00:32:28,445\njust paint the whole board\nbefore you even cut anything.\n\n707\n00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:31,690\nThen you wouldn't even need to cut any\nlittle piece You could just roll it on at\n\n708\n00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,310\nthe very beginning.\n\n709\n00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,135\n>> Now you're talking about gumming\nup my saw with a bunch of paint.\n\n710\n00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:38,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Alright, so let's go ahead and\n\n711\n00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,590\njust set these up.\n\n712\n00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,672\nJust kind of build their dependencies.\n\n713\n00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:47,200\nAnd again, a lot of start to starts\njust because they're all really\n\n714\n00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,114\nhappening at the same time.\n\n715\n00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:50,469\nAll right.\n\n716\n00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,115\nAnd, there we go.\n\n717\n00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:58,055\nSo in theory,\nif we kind of set this up to start and\n\n718\n00:32:58,055 --> 00:33:02,392\nend on a Friday, this part here where Rob,\n\n719\n00:33:02,392 --> 00:33:06,382\nyour work here gets done right in here.\n\n720\n00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:08,358\nYou could actually start\non the next leg and so\n\n721\n00:33:08,358 --> 00:33:10,180\nthey could be happening at the same time.\n\n722\n00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,690\nSo, this guy up here could be\nhappening a little bit earlier\n\n723\n00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,810\nbecause you'd be done here on Thursday.\n\n724\n00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,920\n>> Right.\n\n725\n00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,760\n>> And so on Friday you could start on\nthat piece and continue on from there.\n\n726\n00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,450\nSo, started to get some\nparalleling of activity.\n\n727\n00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,750\n>> Nice.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n728\n00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,670\nSo, under control service\nwhere it says test down there\n\n729\n00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,000\nthat is testing the functions\nof the buttons?\n\n730\n00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,530\n>> Yes.\n\n731\n00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,620\n>> All right.\nWell, then okay.\n\n732\n00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,840\nAll right good deal.\n\n733\n00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,610\n>> I see what you're saying.\n\n734\n00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,336\nCan't really test until the PC\npiece is hooked up, isn't it?\n\n735\n00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:45,350\nSo, you know let's do this, Nate,\nbecause that does make sense.\n\n736\n00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,450\nI'm just gonna ditch that.\n\n737\n00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,530\nLet's just delete that activity\nbecause we're gonna test later on so.\n\n738\n00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,640\nYeah, there is only so\nmuch you can do at this stage.\n\n739\n00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,350\nAll right, PC hardware.\n\n740\n00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,190\nProcure a PC that's really already done.\n\n741\n00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,980\nAnd so some of these we can come\nthrough and we can actually,\n\n742\n00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,450\nI'm gonna flag some of these\nthat are already done.\n\n743\n00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,640\nJust so I don't forget that\nthose guys are already done.\n\n744\n00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,110\nAnd then procure a PC, that's\nalready done and it meets our needs.\n\n745\n00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,040\nIt's got the storage.\n\n746\n00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,070\nIt's ready to rock.\n\n747\n00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,410\nNow procure arcade controls and\ninterface boards.\n\n748\n00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:29,000\nThis one because we know there's a lead\ntime and stuff we're gonna order it.\n\n749\n00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,770\nSome of the components only\nhad a handful of days.\n\n750\n00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,690\nSome of the components had, it was\nlike two weeks of lead time wasn't it?\n\n751\n00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,290\n>> Yeah.\n\n752\n00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:41,690\nThe track ball had, I mean,\ngoodness sakes, about a month back order.\n\n753\n00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,290\nNow we can get a different track ball,\none that does light up, and\n\n754\n00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,640\nthat one is available much sooner.\n\n755\n00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,710\nAnd so you can shorten it all up.\n\n756\n00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,880\n>> What are we talking about different?\n\n757\n00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,700\nThe normal trackball, what I'm\nenvisioning in my head is just that white\n\n758\n00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,250\ntrack ball that almost everything had.\n\n759\n00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,650\nYou're saying that that\nones got a month lead time?\n\n760\n00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,400\n>> Correct.\n\n761\n00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,500\n>> Which is a long time.\n\n762\n00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,430\nGranted this is a non essential thing,\nbut that is a long time.\n\n763\n00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,310\nWhat would be faster?\n\n764\n00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,950\n>> A different track ball.\n\n765\n00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,430\nSo they do have in stock a illuminated\n\n766\n00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,550\ntrack ball instead of\nthe solid white track ball.\n\n767\n00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,690\nThere's a little light\nunderneath it that glows.\n\n768\n00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,520\nNow we weren't planning\non a glowing track ball.\n\n769\n00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it is in stock and\n\n770\n00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:30,595\nit would ship out right away\nalong with all the other buttons.\n\n771\n00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,742\n>> How much more expensive is it?\n\n772\n00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:37,568\n>> It is the, I wrote it down just in\ncase we were going to bring this up.\n\n773\n00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,020\nAnd I I believe it's just\na couple of dollars more.\n\n774\n00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,050\n>> A couple of dollars\nin the Southern sens?\n\n775\n00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,957\nSo two dollars more?\n\n776\n00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:45,670\n>> Yes.\n\n777\n00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,705\nWell, like three or four bucks.\n\n778\n00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:49,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Three bucks more.\n\n779\n00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,820\n>> A few dollars.\n\n780\n00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,670\n>> A few dollars, yes.\n\n781\n00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,670\n>> Some uncertainties that\nare making me uncomfortable.\n\n782\n00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,620\nAll right, so there's the cost issue,\n\n783\n00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,020\nwhich we're not focused on cost yet,\nbut that's gonna come into play here.\n\n784\n00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,860\nAnd then the other thing\nis the appearance.\n\n785\n00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,690\nI mean, when you say it lights up blue,\n\n786\n00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,110\nare we talking like Honda Civic\nlights up blue, or is it neon?\n\n787\n00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,445\n>> Yeah, I don't know.\n\n788\n00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:12,860\nNow I did look,\ntried to do some Google image searches for\n\n789\n00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,770\nit and\nthere were many trackballs that did glow.\n\n790\n00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,830\nThey glow pretty brightly, but\n\n791\n00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,900\nnone of them actually said\nthis is this model trackball.\n\n792\n00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,270\n>> Okay.\n\n793\n00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,830\nSo it's an unknown.\n\n794\n00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:30,810\n>> Now it may be possible to\nnot illuminate the trackball.\n\n795\n00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:37,100\nBut without really knowing how it's wired\nup, how everything works, if we can, it's.\n\n796\n00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,620\n>> Okay.\n\n797\n00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,925\nAll right.\n\n798\n00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:43,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's table that one for the moment.\n\n799\n00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,307\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Huh.\n\n800\n00:36:45,307 --> 00:36:47,106\n>> All going down.\n\n801\n00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:52,434\n>> Yeah, I'm curious.\n\n802\n00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:57,790\nSo, that was procure arcade\ncontrols interfaces.\n\n803\n00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,520\nI'm going to come in here and\njust add a note.\n\n804\n00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,160\nTrackball lead time concerns.\n\n805\n00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,157\nI'm not sold.\n\n806\n00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:07,960\n>> No, I get you.\n\n807\n00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,690\nBecause nothing else is going\nto be glowing, or illuminated,\n\n808\n00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,210\nor emitting light.\n\n809\n00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,770\nWell, except the monitor.\n\n810\n00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,270\n>> And your face.\n\n811\n00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,835\n>> Oh yeah,\nbecause it will be glowing with such glee?\n\n812\n00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:23,320\nAs I'm destroying the [CROSSTALK]\n>> The illuminated track ball\n\n813\n00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,240\n>> I'm just gonna put a lot of light under\n\n814\n00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,080\nthere and have it just glow.\n\n815\n00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,155\nCost uncertain.\n\n816\n00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:34,019\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna revisit that one,\n\n817\n00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,340\nthat one is making a little uncomfortable.\n\n818\n00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,890\nSo, too much uncertainty there.\n\n819\n00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,936\nAll right so, going back here,\nit's now got this giant blue bar that I've\n\n820\n00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:46,679\ndrawn just cuz I don't really know\nanymore what's going to happen.\n\n821\n00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,783\n>> The longer Nate talked,\nthe longer that bar got.\n\n822\n00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:50,510\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know it just kept kind of changing.\n\n823\n00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,080\nAnd then I went and\n\n824\n00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,950\nattached it to the wrong dag gone\nthing after all that was said.\n\n825\n00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,078\nSo, all right, wait no my screen,\noh I see what happened,\n\n826\n00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,815\nmy screen got a little off, all right.\n\n827\n00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:07,550\nSo procure arcade cabinets,\nwe're somewhat uncertain.\n\n828\n00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,810\nAnd because there's different\ncomponents in here,\n\n829\n00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,180\nit might actually be better\nto track these separately.\n\n830\n00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,521\nSo if we do them as sub-tasks and\n\n831\n00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:20,020\nput in each of the different entries\nunder there for procure the controls.\n\n832\n00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,000\nSo, I know we are dealing\nwith multiple vendors right?\n\n833\n00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,670\n>> Correct.\n\n834\n00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,480\nThere will be two vendors.\n\n835\n00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,140\nOne is supplying the actual buttons and\njoystick and\n\n836\n00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,630\nthe other one is supplying\nthe breakout boards and\n\n837\n00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,920\nthe pieces that we need so\nthat the buttons will work with the PC.\n\n838\n00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,590\n>> Okay.\n\n839\n00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,036\nDo you remember the vendor names?\n\n840\n00:38:40,036 --> 00:38:40,707\n>> Yes.\n\n841\n00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:45,148\nThe button people is Suzo Happ,\n\n842\n00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:49,590\nS-U-Z-O space H-A-P-P.\n\n843\n00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,211\nAnd the other people is Hagstrom.\n\n844\n00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:58,064\nH-A-G-S-T-R-O-M.\n\n845\n00:38:58,064 --> 00:38:58,592\nYep.\n\n846\n00:38:58,592 --> 00:38:59,602\n>> Okay.\n\n847\n00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:03,505\nAll right.\n\n848\n00:39:03,505 --> 00:39:07,640\nSo, the reason I'm wanting to\nadd these in as Subtasks is.\n\n849\n00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,120\nIn fact you know what I might even add\nthem as, now that I think about it,\n\n850\n00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,620\nlet me get rid of these.\n\n851\n00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:20,596\nI'm gonna add these in as actual\nactivities in here under procure.\n\n852\n00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:26,040\nJust because I'm not certain how\n\n853\n00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,420\nlong some of this stuff is going to take,\nso I want to make sure that we track it.\n\n854\n00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:36,608\nSo, I'll do order from Suzo Happ, and\nI'm going to assign this to you, Nate.\n\n855\n00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,371\n>> Okay.\n>> All right.\n\n856\n00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:42,295\n>> And where did it go?\n\n857\n00:39:42,295 --> 00:39:46,685\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Did you delete it?\n\n858\n00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,657\nI think you deleted it.\n\n859\n00:39:48,657 --> 00:39:49,550\n>> Oh, did I?\n>> I think so.\n\n860\n00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,941\n>> Oh, did I hit cancel instead of save?\n\n861\n00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:51,453\n>> Yeah.\n\n862\n00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:52,557\nHooray.\n\n863\n00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,621\n>> Now I still don't know where it went.\n\n864\n00:39:54,621 --> 00:39:57,212\nThen edit at the top.\n\n865\n00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:59,021\nThere it is.\n\n866\n00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:02,744\nOkay, so\nwe're going to track these separately,\n\n867\n00:40:02,744 --> 00:40:07,830\njust because I'm not entirely\nsure what's gonna happen here.\n\n868\n00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,810\nSo, I want this order from Suzo Happ.\n\n869\n00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:13,280\nLet me jump back to a sonic,\nbecause this is a little squirrelly.\n\n870\n00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,792\nIt's a lot easier to add stuff in here.\n\n871\n00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:19,478\nAll right, and\nwe'll have order from Hagstrom, you said?\n\n872\n00:40:19,478 --> 00:40:20,502\n>> Correct.\n>> Okay.\n\n873\n00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,500\nAnd you said Hagstrom was the control.\n\n874\n00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,382\n>> Interfaces.\n\n875\n00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:29,770\n>> Control Interfaces.\n\n876\n00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,570\n>> All right cuz I have that,\nthat was the buttons and joysticks.\n\n877\n00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,160\n>> Correct\n>> All right,\n\n878\n00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,470\nand I'm gonna add another entry in here.\n\n879\n00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,425\nAn order from Suzo Happ and a trackball.\n\n880\n00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:41,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's\n\n881\n00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,310\na high risk item\n>> Yes.\n\n882\n00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,440\n>> Because of the schedule and\nthe costs and certain stuff.\n\n883\n00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,660\nSo I want to track that as\na separate entity just so\n\n884\n00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,830\nthat I can be aware of\nwhat's going on there.\n\n885\n00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,950\nLet me get those are attached to you also.\n\n886\n00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,829\n>> I'm glad that the trackball is still\nbeing attached at this point because\n\n887\n00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:01,800\nit was an optional item.\n\n888\n00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,820\nWasn't that correct if we're\ngetting close to our budget?\n\n889\n00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,300\nSo I'm glad it's still sticking around.\n\n890\n00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,990\n>> I think it's kind of a pivotable piece.\n\n891\n00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:14,300\nIt's something that I\nthink we definitely need.\n\n892\n00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,345\nSo as far as our schedule is concerned.\n\n893\n00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:20,380\nThat's kind of what we're\nreally talking about here.\n\n894\n00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,940\nWhen we're dealing with this stuff,\n\n895\n00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,210\nlet me just refresh to make sure it\nhas everything that I need, okay.\n\n896\n00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:30,540\nSo when we're dealing with this stuff,\nthe order from Suzo Happ\n\n897\n00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:35,260\nas far as the buttons and joystick, if we\norder that today, how long will it take?\n\n898\n00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,639\n>> Goodness, just about a week.\n\n899\n00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,670\nFor the items that are in stock.\n\n900\n00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,400\n>> Okay so let's come in here and\n\n901\n00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,930\nI'm going to stretch that\nto a five day activity.\n\n902\n00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,811\nGot it?\n>> Yep.\n\n903\n00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:52,470\n>> And a order from Suzo Happ, oh wait.\n\n904\n00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,035\nI keep jumping down to the wrong thing.\n\n905\n00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:57,613\nThere we go.\n\n906\n00:41:57,613 --> 00:42:03,330\nOkay, so that order is gonna take\nabout a week from when it's ordered.\n\n907\n00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:08,030\nThe trackball we're uncertain on,\nand just to be on the safe side for\n\n908\n00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,490\nright now so I can remember\nwhy I've got this one listed.\n\n909\n00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,540\nI'm going to set that one as\na nice long interval here.\n\n910\n00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,370\nI'll set it to the month.\n\n911\n00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,640\nJust so I can look at that and\nfreak out when I see the schedule and\n\n912\n00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,730\nremember I need to do it.\n\n913\n00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,962\nYou won't forget a task,\nthis flag is a month long.\n\n914\n00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:27,840\nAll right, procure the PC is already done.\n\n915\n00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,460\nOrder from action control interfaces.\n\n916\n00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,590\nAll right?\nSo from those guys,\n\n917\n00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,070\nwhat's their leave time?\n\n918\n00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,860\n>> Yeah, those items are in stock,\nand so we're looking, yep, same thing.\n\n919\n00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,370\nAbout five business days for\nit to ship out.\n\n920\n00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,850\n>> And then once you have all these\ncomponents, Nate, once they're in your\n\n921\n00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:47,190\npossession, how long do you think\nit'll take you assemble the hardware?\n\n922\n00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,250\n>> Yeah, so getting the buttons\ninside the control surface,\n\n923\n00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,520\nI mean that would just take\na couple of hours wiring it up.\n\n924\n00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,850\nThere are, every button will\nhave two wires essentially.\n\n925\n00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:02,780\nEach joystick will have four wires,\ncuz there'll be 4-way joysticks.\n\n926\n00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,527\nKind of those, a lot a wires now,\n\n927\n00:43:04,527 --> 00:43:08,522\nI believe we're all gonna use a quick\nconnect so it won't be any soldering,\n\n928\n00:43:08,522 --> 00:43:11,430\nthe breakup boards have\nlittle screw terminals.\n\n929\n00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,030\n>> Okay.\n\n930\n00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,940\n>> So, realistically I mean it would,\ngoodness sakes,\n\n931\n00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:21,210\nI mean many hours, I'd have to be\ndoing it in the evening, break it up.\n\n932\n00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,430\nSo I think two days.\n\n933\n00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,470\nTwo days to get the wiring done\n>> We'll go ahead and\n\n934\n00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,180\nput two days on that one.\n\n935\n00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,110\nAll right now that ones gonna be\na little tricky because it's got\n\n936\n00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,790\nmore than one dependency.\n\n937\n00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,790\nWhich Instagantt will let me do.\n\n938\n00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:42,410\nAll right and then these guys are all\nkind of independent of each other.\n\n939\n00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,510\nYou know,\nInstagantt let me set that dependency.\n\n940\n00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,660\nThat didn't, oh, I see.\n\n941\n00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,160\nI made this one a.\n\n942\n00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:52,177\nShoot.\n\n943\n00:43:52,177 --> 00:43:55,510\nI made that one a start\nto start instead of a.\n\n944\n00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,650\nOh, shoot so\nnow I gotta redo the whole thing.\n\n945\n00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,464\nI'm like from.\n\n946\n00:44:02,464 --> 00:44:04,988\n>> Kind of behind the box too,\nthere in r string.\n\n947\n00:44:04,988 --> 00:44:12,060\n>> We'll go ahead and\n\n948\n00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,290\nget that mapped out.\n\n949\n00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:20,910\nI'll eventually get my little\n\n950\n00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:26,752\nclicks in the right place here.\n\n951\n00:44:26,752 --> 00:44:27,739\nReally?\n\n952\n00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:28,923\n>> It won't let you go all\nthe way over that way.\n\n953\n00:44:28,923 --> 00:44:30,839\n>> It really doesn't, I guess maybe\ncuz where I got it positioned.\n\n954\n00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:32,920\nThere we go, now try it.\n\n955\n00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,540\nOkay.\n\n956\n00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,230\nSo, now we kind of got that one laid out\nand see how my entire project is going to\n\n957\n00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,900\nbe pushed back, thanks to that\nback report, right, I'm right.\n\n958\n00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,850\nThis is important you know,\n\n959\n00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,220\nwhen you get an item that can\nreally affect your whole project.\n\n960\n00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,349\nSo tracking that stuff is important.\n\n961\n00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:55,340\nAnd so this is all really kind of\nrolled up under this procure arcade so\n\n962\n00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,720\nthis is really all just\nkinda one in the same.\n\n963\n00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,870\nSo I'm gonna attach these kind of\nstart to start style to that just so\n\n964\n00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:09,850\nI can remember that they're linked.\n\n965\n00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,530\nOkay.\nAll right so\n\n966\n00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,700\nthat's kind of an idea there we'll revisit\nthat trackball in terms of schedule.\n\n967\n00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,690\nBut our time estimates\nare kind of in place here.\n\n968\n00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,994\nSome of these are already done,\nprocure PC is already done, and\n\n969\n00:45:18,994 --> 00:45:20,840\nthe other stuff we still need to do.\n\n970\n00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,335\n>> Okay.\n\n971\n00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:24,485\n>> All right, the software side of things.\n\n972\n00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:26,807\nSo, installing an operating system,\nI know.\n\n973\n00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,470\n>> Ten minutes.\n\n974\n00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,328\n>> Yeah, not a big deal.\n\n975\n00:45:28,328 --> 00:45:35,180\nYou know what, it did that thing again,\nwhere my screen didn't stay right.\n\n976\n00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,090\nThere we go, all right.\n\n977\n00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,132\nInstalling HyperSpin.\n\n978\n00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:40,010\nnow I've heard this can be a bear.\n\n979\n00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:40,850\nSo.\n\n980\n00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:44,890\n>> Yeah,\nthere is a lot of pieces in HyperSpin.\n\n981\n00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:47,440\nEverything is built, all these XML files.\n\n982\n00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,100\nAnd so to configure HyperSpin,\nyou have edit these files.\n\n983\n00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,390\nNow unfortunately there are some tools\nthat kind of automate the process a little\n\n984\n00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:59,550\nbit to make it a little bit easier but\neither way, at the end of the day,\n\n985\n00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,570\nthere will be many many files that will\nneed to be edited to configure HyperSpin.\n\n986\n00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,960\nFortunately, we are using just\none emulator so we use MAME.\n\n987\n00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,010\nAnd we're just going to throw\nin a handful of roms so\n\n988\n00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,970\nwe're not going to have to\nscroll through a thousand or so.\n\n989\n00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:19,830\nSo there won't be as many changes needing\nto be made, but yeah goodness sake,\n\n990\n00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,860\nit'll be a bit of reading to see what\nneeds to be edited sort of thing.\n\n991\n00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:29,000\nI mean so a few days really to install and\nget the roms.\n\n992\n00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,270\nIs that a few in the Southern sense,\nlike three or?\n\n993\n00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,650\n>> I think three days.\n\n994\n00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,290\nYes, I can do it in three days.\n\n995\n00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,388\n>> So what's your level on\nconfidence on that estimate?\n\n996\n00:46:40,388 --> 00:46:43,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think four days would be a little bit\n\n997\n00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,735\nmore relaxed.\n\n998\n00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:46,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just to make sure everything is\n\n999\n00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,090\ninstalled and functioning and the,\nI mean there's a lot of pieces to it.\n\n1000\n00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,160\n>> There are.\n>> The launcher and then the front end,\n\n1001\n00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,404\nand the emulator itself.\n\n1002\n00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:56,831\nI think [LAUGH].\n\n1003\n00:46:56,831 --> 00:46:58,176\n>> Right.\n\n1004\n00:46:58,176 --> 00:46:59,907\n>> Right.\n>> Right now we could.\n\n1005\n00:46:59,907 --> 00:47:02,079\n>> So I'm gonna go ahead and link this\nto procure a PC also just because we\n\n1006\n00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,889\ncan't really do this stuff\nwithout having the PC first.\n\n1007\n00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:09,750\nSo I'm going to link that up there.\n\n1008\n00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,570\nBut I'm going to go ahead and\nput you down for four days.\n\n1009\n00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:19,470\nApparently I don't have GanttProject\nto set to skip the weekends.\n\n1010\n00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,540\nI'll adjust that later.\n\n1011\n00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:27,410\nYeah, there is an option\nsomewhere in here, skip weekends.\n\n1012\n00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:30,614\nAnd apparently it only takes effect\nafter the fact, all right, well anyhow.\n\n1013\n00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:36,174\nSo we've got that in place,\n\n1014\n00:47:36,174 --> 00:47:40,350\nwhat else do we have?\n\n1015\n00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,440\nSo that's installing HyperSpin.\n\n1016\n00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,960\nThe software that interfaces\nbetween HyperSpin and\n\n1017\n00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,430\nthe arcade buttons and stuff?\n\n1018\n00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,760\nAre you including that in\nthat four day estimate?\n\n1019\n00:47:52,734 --> 00:47:55,402\n>> [LAUGH] No.\n\n1020\n00:47:55,402 --> 00:47:57,305\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n1021\n00:47:57,305 --> 00:47:58,491\nOkay.\n\n1022\n00:47:58,491 --> 00:48:03,621\n>> No, I have never hooked up these\ninterface boards to HyperSpin and\n\n1023\n00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:05,550\ngone that route before.\n\n1024\n00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:11,650\nI have set up HyperSpin before, so I have\nan idea sort of on what needs to happen.\n\n1025\n00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,210\nIt's a little bit of a tedious process but\n\n1026\n00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:19,120\nas far as getting the buttons to talk with\nthe software, that is a bit of an unknown.\n\n1027\n00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,160\n>> Okay.\n\n1028\n00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,980\nSo as far as subtasks, HyperSpin.\n\n1029\n00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,265\nWe've got HyperSpin itself.\n\n1030\n00:48:26,265 --> 00:48:27,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1031\n00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,375\n>> Then we have the control\nboard software.\n\n1032\n00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1033\n00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,560\n>> And then we have to Interface HyperSpin\nwith the control board software,\n\n1034\n00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,160\nand that's the part you're uncertain of.\n\n1035\n00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,660\n>> Correct.\n\n1036\n00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,900\n>> Alright, so.\n\n1037\n00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,400\n>> But you know it could go pretty\nquick because that control interface,\n\n1038\n00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,240\nall it does is emulate key\npresses on a keyboard.\n\n1039\n00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,560\nSo it could be just as easy as mapping\n\n1040\n00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,110\na keyboard press to an input\non that control board.\n\n1041\n00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,032\n>> It certainly could.\n\n1042\n00:49:05,032 --> 00:49:10,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not have a solid estimate.\n\n1043\n00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,200\n>> Man, I got more notes than Robin does.\n\n1044\n00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,540\n>> Well so here's what we need guys.\n\n1045\n00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,823\nBecause our estimate is\npulled out of our butts, so\n\n1046\n00:49:21,823 --> 00:49:25,110\nthis is not an estimate we can act on.\n\n1047\n00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,980\nSo what we need is more information,\nright, so we're not gonna be able to\n\n1048\n00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,440\nproduce a solid schedule today\nbecause of the uncertainties.\n\n1049\n00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,740\n>> Right.\n>> And that's to be expected.\n\n1050\n00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,230\nOn a small project like this, sure there\nwas a chance we could have created a solid\n\n1051\n00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:39,110\nschedule here but it's not gonna happen.\n\n1052\n00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,660\nSo in a large project,\n\n1053\n00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,330\nyou're never gonna have a solid\nschedule on your first meeting.\n\n1054\n00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:44,290\nUsually it's like your tenth or\n\n1055\n00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:46,940\ntwelfth meeting before you even\nget close to a solid schedule.\n\n1056\n00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,940\nSo we're identifying areas we\nneed to find more information on.\n\n1057\n00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,525\nSo how long is it going to take\nto to do this interfacing?\n\n1058\n00:49:53,525 --> 00:49:55,750\nWe don't know so we go and\nfind somebody who does,\n\n1059\n00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,330\nwe need to find a subject matter expert.\n\n1060\n00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:01,190\nWe need to go on line, see if somebody's\nposted a YouTube video that says how to do\n\n1061\n00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,930\nit that gives us that idea.\n\n1062\n00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:06,890\nSo we need to get a better estimate\nof what this is gonna take.\n\n1063\n00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:09,080\nFor right now I'm gonna\nleave it at four days.\n\n1064\n00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,960\nThis is our first stab at a schedule.\n\n1065\n00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,510\nWe can still amend it cause\nwe're in the planning phase.\n\n1066\n00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,470\nBut when we get an execution\nwe need to know.\n\n1067\n00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,200\nBut right now we can\nhave some uncertainties.\n\n1068\n00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,350\nRob, you mentioned some\nthings were uncertain.\n\n1069\n00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:24,260\nThat we didn't know exactly how long\nit would take to assemble that cabinet.\n\n1070\n00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,790\n>> Right.\n>> That's fine in the planning phase and\n\n1071\n00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,880\nwe actually could execute we need to know.\n\n1072\n00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,100\nSo we'll just kind of\nrefine these estimates and\n\n1073\n00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,630\ncome up with some things that\nare a little more on the definite side.\n\n1074\n00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,880\nSo I'm gonna leave that\nat four business days.\n\n1075\n00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,220\n>> Sweet.\n>> All right.\n\n1076\n00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,350\nOptional activities.\n\n1077\n00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,950\nWe still haven't decided whether or\nnot we're actually gonna do the graphics\n\n1078\n00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,320\noverlay, it kind of comes down to cost,\nwhich we don't know yet.\n\n1079\n00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,340\nAs far as designing the graphics overlay,\n\n1080\n00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,370\nI think Rob, you've already\nmocked some thing up haven't you?\n\n1081\n00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,760\n>> Right, yeah.\nI did work on it.\n\n1082\n00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,300\n>> And\ndo you know about how long that took you?\n\n1083\n00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,330\nTook me about an hour.\n\n1084\n00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,210\nI know, that's no time.\n\n1085\n00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:01,310\n>> Yeah, I'll just put it down as a day.\n\n1086\n00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,470\nWe're kind of tracking it in days.\n\n1087\n00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,540\nIt's a small project, so that's fine.\n\n1088\n00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,630\nIf we wanted to get them printed,\nto send them off to a printer and\n\n1089\n00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,670\nhave them printed, do you know\nabout how long that would take?\n\n1090\n00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,000\n>> Actually for them to produce them?\n\n1091\n00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,520\nI would guess they could\nhave it done in a day.\n\n1092\n00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,590\nIt's not anything outside of\n>> Okay.\n\n1093\n00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,360\nBut we'll need to actually get a quote.\n\n1094\n00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,715\n>> Yeah, get a quote on the vinyl.\n\n1095\n00:51:23,715 --> 00:51:26,801\n>> All right, so\nlet me add just a note here.\n\n1096\n00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:30,589\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1097\n00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:32,945\nNeed to get quote.\n\n1098\n00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:35,715\nOh, you know what, I'm typing in the-\n>> Description.\n\n1099\n00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:38,295\n>> Description not the comments.\n\n1100\n00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:43,640\nI need to go back to asana for that.\n\n1101\n00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,210\nSo if I want to get them printed this guy.\n\n1102\n00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:54,340\nSo we need to get a quote for\nprice and lead time.\n\n1103\n00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:58,069\n>> Is there a place in town that can do\nthat or are we going to have to send away?\n\n1104\n00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,770\n>> I'll try in town first to see.\n\n1105\n00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:02,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1106\n00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:07,110\n>> Yeah, like those companies that do\nthe wraps and stuff like that on cars,\n\n1107\n00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:08,230\nwe could see.\n\n1108\n00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,030\n>> Okay.\n\n1109\n00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,280\nApplying the graphics is not a big deal.\n\n1110\n00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,320\nIt's probably just a day, right?\n\n1111\n00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:12,980\n>> Right.\n\n1112\n00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,390\n>> Now,\nat what point can the graphics be applied?\n\n1113\n00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:19,610\nThe cabinet would need to pretty\nmuch be assembled, right?\n\n1114\n00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:24,620\n>> Well, okay so if we do get\nthe graphics for the control surface,\n\n1115\n00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:29,760\ntechnically we could cut\nout the control service and\n\n1116\n00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,260\napply the graphic and\nnot paint underneath it.\n\n1117\n00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,580\n>> Okay, because it's going to\nhave T moldings on the edge.\n\n1118\n00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:42,200\n>> So, in that scenario we\nwould not install the controls\n\n1119\n00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,538\nuntil after, I'm kind of\nrearranging this a little bit here.\n\n1120\n00:52:47,538 --> 00:52:51,566\nSo basically,\n\n1121\n00:52:51,566 --> 00:52:55,970\nthe right here where I've got this\noptional installed graphics overlay.\n\n1122\n00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,510\nRight, so that would be here,\nthis apply the graphics.\n\n1123\n00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,706\nLet me just slide like that and\nactually you know what,\n\n1124\n00:52:59,706 --> 00:53:00,597\nthat would need to be a start from start.\n\n1125\n00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:10,090\nOkay.\n\n1126\n00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,290\nSo, basically that's going\n\n1127\n00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,270\nto be right in there and then this guy,\nwhich would be Nate coming in and\n\n1128\n00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:30,740\ninstalling the controls,\nthat would happen afterwards.\n\n1129\n00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,404\nOh come on, you know you wanna link.\n\n1130\n00:53:32,404 --> 00:53:35,277\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It doesn't wanna link.\n\n1131\n00:53:35,277 --> 00:53:37,885\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well shoot.\n\n1132\n00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:41,925\nOh you know it's probably\nbecause the weekend.\n\n1133\n00:53:41,925 --> 00:53:47,225\nLet’s see if it'll let me do,\nsure enough it does not want to link it,\n\n1134\n00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:50,160\nso I’ll have to figure out which one\non there but basically, you know,\n\n1135\n00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,010\nthen we'd install the controls\nafter the graphic overlay.\n\n1136\n00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,420\nSo I've kind of all\nready got that in here.\n\n1137\n00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,560\nI guess I could just link it right there.\n\n1138\n00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,410\nIt will be the same thing.\n\n1139\n00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,650\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n1140\n00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:05,140\nSo that kind of falls into play and\nthen these guys, straighten those out.\n\n1141\n00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,110\nAll right.\nWell, whatever, I can sort that out later.\n\n1142\n00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:14,340\nOkay, so that's basically those.\n\n1143\n00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,225\nWe will need to get a better\nestimate of time on some of those,\n\n1144\n00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:20,510\ncuz they're not as well\nestimated as they should be.\n\n1145\n00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,480\nAll right, then final assembly.\n\n1146\n00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,570\nAt this point the cabinet's\nalready assembled and\n\n1147\n00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:29,260\nthe control surface is already assembled.\n\n1148\n00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,020\nThey just need to be put together.\n\n1149\n00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,100\nThe monitor needs to be installed, well I\nguess that might have already happened.\n\n1150\n00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,730\nWould you install a monitor\nas part of the main cabinet?\n\n1151\n00:54:43,101 --> 00:54:44,041\n>> I mean, you wouldn't like\nswing a two by four into it.\n\n1152\n00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:48,510\n>> We should probably do that\ndown here under final assembly.\n\n1153\n00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:54,330\nSo we would add in a new task down here\nin which we would say, install monitor.\n\n1154\n00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:56,820\n>> We'll be on that VESA mount.\n\n1155\n00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,585\nSo you could just.\n\n1156\n00:54:59,585 --> 00:55:04,090\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> No you could just.\n\n1157\n00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:08,650\nNice, All right,\nlet me send this down here is it,\n\n1158\n00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,240\nit's gonna be like that isn't it.\n\n1159\n00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,170\nAll right, let me.\n\n1160\n00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:11,690\n>> I know it's not.\n\n1161\n00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:12,480\n>> Oh, it won't scroll down.\n\n1162\n00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,700\n>> It's not responding to my mouse stuff.\n\n1163\n00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,940\nThe product's in beta so\nI'll give them a break.\n\n1164\n00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,640\nInstall control service into cabinet,\ninstall PC components, install monitor.\n\n1165\n00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,570\nSo I'm just gonna come here and\ndrop it into this one.\n\n1166\n00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,732\nApparently it's got to go up top.\n\n1167\n00:55:27,732 --> 00:55:28,320\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n1168\n00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,060\nSo we'll put that one in.\n\n1169\n00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,180\nSo we need to install a monitor.\n\n1170\n00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,940\nAll this stuff right here,\nthe main work for it is really done.\n\n1171\n00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,460\nSo its just sticking in in there and\nwiring it.\n\n1172\n00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,420\nSo this is all really probably\njust a one day activity, right?\n\n1173\n00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,080\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n1174\n00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,970\nall this stuff could really\nhappen on the same day.\n\n1175\n00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,880\nAnd acceptance testing\nwould happen immediately.\n\n1176\n00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:51,330\nSo, all of this stuff is\nreally start to start.\n\n1177\n00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:55,723\nSo, all of these are happening on the same\nday spread out over eight hours or\n\n1178\n00:55:55,723 --> 00:55:56,438\nwhatever.\n\n1179\n00:55:56,438 --> 00:55:59,915\nAnd then all this really can't happen\nuntil everything else is done, so\n\n1180\n00:55:59,915 --> 00:56:02,033\nwe need to Kind of move,\na lot of this stuff.\n\n1181\n00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:03,797\nIs it gonna make me move these one by one?\n\n1182\n00:56:03,797 --> 00:56:06,130\n>> Even though they're linked right.\n\n1183\n00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,680\n>> Will it let me do that?\n\n1184\n00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,270\nI don't think it will.\n\n1185\n00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:15,612\n>> I thought you drag over them one time,\nand got all them grayed out or something.\n\n1186\n00:56:15,612 --> 00:56:17,220\nThere's a couple of them at once.\n\n1187\n00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,230\nAnyhow, all of these have to\nwait before any of these can\n\n1188\n00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,470\nget done before any of\nthese can really happen.\n\n1189\n00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:28,090\nSo, each of these are really just\ndependent on whatever my critical path is.\n\n1190\n00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,435\nSo I'm just going to park them down here.\n\n1191\n00:56:29,435 --> 00:56:34,890\nAgain I'll have to do some detail\nwork on this a little bit later.\n\n1192\n00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,360\nWhat is up with this guy?\n\n1193\n00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,025\n[LAUGH]\n>> You drug that one into next year\n\n1194\n00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:46,150\n[LAUGH] It's like the time in-between was.\n\n1195\n00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:49,160\n>> You know they do say that\nthe product is in beta.\n\n1196\n00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,169\n>> And\nnow I can't right click on it either.\n\n1197\n00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:54,550\nBecause the little menu is appearing\ndown beneath it for some reason.\n\n1198\n00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,032\nAll right so that's a bit of a pain.\n\n1199\n00:56:59,032 --> 00:57:01,250\nSo, I'll have to find that activity later.\n\n1200\n00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:04,010\nBut alright, so we've got those in there.\n\n1201\n00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,960\nThat's good.\nActually, let's go in here and\n\n1202\n00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:11,250\nchange the date, just delete dates.\n\n1203\n00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,110\nThere done.\n\n1204\n00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,290\nOkay, so all that will happen.\n\n1205\n00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:19,210\nSo right now if we were to start the\nproject today with our rough estimates,\n\n1206\n00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:22,830\nwe've got it starting basically Monday,\nJuly 7.\n\n1207\n00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:23,780\nRight?\n\n1208\n00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,670\nAnd finishing August 11.\n\n1209\n00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:31,170\nSo it's about a six\nweek project right now.\n\n1210\n00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:32,310\n>> With the trackball.\n\n1211\n00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:35,025\n>> Almost all of that is because\nof the trackball, right?\n\n1212\n00:57:35,025 --> 00:57:37,030\n50% of our schedule is because of that.\n\n1213\n00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:40,230\nSo that's obviously\nsomething we need to find.\n\n1214\n00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,753\nSo our revisiting is rapid.\n\n1215\n00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:46,800\nThis for our initial draft schedule we're\nlooking at a six week project on this one.\n\n1216\n00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,480\nObviously, it could be much, much shorter,\nbut that's where we're at right now.\n\n1217\n00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,900\nI do need to go through and\nrevisit some of these assignments.\n\n1218\n00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,750\nAnd get those assigned out,\nbut that's, again for later.\n\n1219\n00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:03,070\nAll right, so we've covered our\nrequirements, we've covered our schedule.\n\n1220\n00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,240\nThe only other thing left is cost.\n\n1221\n00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,040\nNow a lot of these activities\nthe only cost is labor, and\n\n1222\n00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,200\nas everybody knows we barely pay you guys\nanything so not even worth tracking.\n\n1223\n00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,600\nSo, the only thing we really\nneed to track are the materials.\n\n1224\n00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,200\nAnd the time, but\nwe already have time with the schedule.\n\n1225\n00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,140\nSo, it comes down to materials.\n\n1226\n00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,800\nWe only have a handful of\ntests that are procure based.\n\n1227\n00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:27,820\nAnd if I look at these, like procure\nthe PC is one we've already got.\n\n1228\n00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:33,610\nSo, some of these things like the MDF,\nwe kind of have an idea of the cost.\n\n1229\n00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:38,200\nI'm going to get out of the Gantt\nchart and go back to Asana and\n\n1230\n00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,320\nwe'll do it from here.\n\n1231\n00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,289\nSo under get materials here,\nRob, this is your wheelhouse.\n\n1232\n00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:51,146\nFor your materials the router bit for\nthe t-molding.\n\n1233\n00:58:51,146 --> 00:58:53,690\n>> $25 I think.\n\n1234\n00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:56,330\n>> And you've got a hard set quote.\n\n1235\n00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,470\nWe'll pull the definite numbers later.\n\n1236\n00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,942\n>> 10 and 15 yes.\n\n1237\n00:58:59,942 --> 00:59:02,663\nIt's two parts 10 and 15.\n\n1238\n00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:06,280\n>> The t-molding,\nI believe that was $30 wasn't it?\n\n1239\n00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,463\n>> Right.\nSounds right.\n\n1240\n00:59:07,463 --> 00:59:09,076\n$15.\n\n1241\n00:59:09,076 --> 00:59:12,420\n>> Okay, and I'll go back afterwards and\nget the actual hard numbers in here.\n\n1242\n00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,730\nThree sheets of MDF you said $35 a sheet?\n\n1243\n00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:16,230\n>> Yep.\n\n1244\n00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,150\n>> So that's 105.\n\n1245\n00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:23,510\nAll right.\n\n1246\n00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,640\nAnd casters?\n\n1247\n00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,000\n>> I'm gonna say $5 each.\n\n1248\n00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:35,170\n>> All these numbers are estimates\nat this point, right?\n\n1249\n00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:39,880\nAnd what we'll need to do is actually go\nand get the hard numbers from Home Depot\n\n1250\n00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,660\nor wherever it is that\nwe're gonna get them from.\n\n1251\n00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,260\nBefore we can be certain on that.\n\n1252\n00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,680\nAll right, let's see that's pretty\nmuch it for our main parts list there.\n\n1253\n00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,250\nYou said things like nails and\nscrews that I should use on hands or buy.\n\n1254\n00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,250\n>> I have a lot on hand.\n\n1255\n00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:58,580\nShould I allocate a small budget for?\n\n1256\n00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,090\n>> Yes.\nLet's do $10 for miscellaneous.\n\n1257\n01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:05,420\nScrews, glue and shoes.\n\n1258\n01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,630\n>> Sodas.\n\n1259\n01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:07,450\n>> So a $10 reserve.\n\n1260\n01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:09,940\nOkay.\n\n1261\n01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,810\nSo cut the pieces,\nassemble the cabinet, paint.\n\n1262\n01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,960\nYou know, paint we really don't have\npaint on here as an item, do we?\n\n1263\n01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,456\nSo probably something we should add.\n\n1264\n01:00:23,978 --> 01:00:26,985\nSo if I want to come in here and\nadd paint,\n\n1265\n01:00:26,985 --> 01:00:30,115\nI can't imagine it would take more then.\n\n1266\n01:00:30,115 --> 01:00:32,500\n>> $30.\n\n1267\n01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,520\n>> So one gallon would probably\nknock out the whole thing.\n\n1268\n01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,510\nDo you need primer for MDF?\n\n1269\n01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,340\nYou don't need primer.\n\n1270\n01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,210\nYou don't have to use primer.\n\n1271\n01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:39,710\nIt'll bond to it.\n\n1272\n01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:44,830\nIt just soaks it up but\nit's not that much surface area.\n\n1273\n01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,820\n>> Okay.\n\n1274\n01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,720\nAnd you said it's about $30 for\nthat gallon of paint.\n\n1275\n01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,330\n>> Right.\n>> We'll worry about the color later.\n\n1276\n01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:51,280\nWe can have an argument over that.\n\n1277\n01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,690\n>> Glow in the dark so\nyou can find it at night.\n\n1278\n01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,920\n>> There you go.\n\n1279\n01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,918\nAlright so that's procurement there.\n\n1280\n01:00:55,918 --> 01:01:00,471\nNate Oh here, get materials for\n\n1281\n01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:03,368\nthis one really falls into\nthe materials for the other one, right?\n\n1282\n01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,030\n>> It is.\n\n1283\n01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:06,300\nIt's included, right.\n>> We don't have to worry about that one.\n\n1284\n01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:12,320\nBut, procure arcade controls and interface\nboards, that's our other big one.\n\n1285\n01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,240\nAnd since I broke it up\ninto these separate orders,\n\n1286\n01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,960\nlet's track it on the orders.\n\n1287\n01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:21,480\nSo Nate, do you have a ballpark for\nour buttons and joysticks?\n\n1288\n01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,460\nYes, well buttons and joystick and\n\n1289\n01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:29,440\nthe trackball,\nall three of them added to $531.\n\n1290\n01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,720\nAnd that includes yes with the track ball.\n\n1291\n01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,280\n>> Do you know what the tack ball cost is?\n\n1292\n01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:36,840\n>> Track ball.\n\n1293\n01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,330\n>> Look at you with your paperwork.\n\n1294\n01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:40,560\nSo you have these are exact numbers?\n\n1295\n01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,620\n>> Yep and let's see that.\n\n1296\n01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,420\n>> So this is not an estimate\nthis is an actual quote.\n\n1297\n01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,210\n>> So three parts to the track ball or?\n\n1298\n01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,940\n>> There's three parts to the track ball?\n\n1299\n01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,425\n>> Well there's like a mounting\nthe plate on the top right?\n\n1300\n01:01:52,425 --> 01:01:52,974\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1301\n01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,980\nYeah, I guess the trackball did not,\n\n1302\n01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:03,210\nbut it does include the trackball\nit just did get on my little print.\n\n1303\n01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,100\n>> All right.\nI'm\n\n1304\n01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,820\ngonna leave that as 531 with trackball.\n\n1305\n01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:13,930\nAnd I just put a little note here,\ntrackball with long lead time.\n\n1306\n01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,150\nAnd so we may swap that out.\n\n1307\n01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,960\nSo, we'll have to adjust\nthis a little bit.\n\n1308\n01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,150\nWe can get.\n>> Oh, there it is.\n\n1309\n01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,310\nSorry that's right.\n\n1310\n01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:22,640\nBecause it didn't even have a picture.\n\n1311\n01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,280\nI was just looking at the pictures.\n\n1312\n01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,580\nOkay, so a trackball 121.\n\n1313\n01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:29,590\n>> Okay.\n>> Oh yeah, and\n\n1314\n01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:30,800\nthen the mounting plate, 15 bucks.\n\n1315\n01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,780\n>> Oh, that's important, right?\n\n1316\n01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,490\nI mean, that's part of it.\n\n1317\n01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:35,480\n>> Oh yeah. Oh yes. 136.\n>> Good math.\n\n1318\n01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,623\n>> That's pretty expensive.\n\n1319\n01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:40,630\n>> It is.\n\n1320\n01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,230\n>> How much more is the glowing ball.\n\n1321\n01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:47,290\n>> Alright so here for this trackball,\n\n1322\n01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:51,670\nglowing ball with no lead time,\nwe need a quote.\n\n1323\n01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:56,025\nSo oh sorry,\nthat 121 is indeed the glowing ball.\n\n1324\n01:02:56,025 --> 01:02:57,098\nI apologize.\n\n1325\n01:02:57,098 --> 01:02:59,030\n>> Oh, wait a minute, the add is changing.\n\n1326\n01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:04,050\n>> Cause I really wanted\nthe Rcrate get it really quick.\n\n1327\n01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:07,790\n>> So I just kind of added it,\nalready in there.\n\n1328\n01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:08,290\nOkay.\n\n1329\n01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,733\n>> So, now you're okay with this,\nnow we can [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n1330\n01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:18,360\n[Laughs.]\n>> I would like to know what the normal\n\n1331\n01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,950\ntrackball costs, so\nI can weigh the benefit analysis.\n\n1332\n01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,610\nIs it worth waiting a month?\n\n1333\n01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:25,960\nFor the standard track, well you know,\nso I need to know that.\n\n1334\n01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,590\nSo, we do need to get a quote needed.\n\n1335\n01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:37,690\nSo, price of normal trackball,\nwith long lead time unknown.\n\n1336\n01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,705\nGet quote from slacker Nate.\n\n1337\n01:03:39,705 --> 01:03:41,826\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, it's like a couple bucks less.\n\n1338\n01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:42,740\n>> [LAUGH] A couple bucks.\n\n1339\n01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,498\n>> Yeah, I don't work in couples.\n\n1340\n01:03:44,498 --> 01:03:47,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I also don't know how to spell unknown.\n\n1341\n01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,620\nThere we go, all right.\n\n1342\n01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,920\nThe Hagstrom the control interfaces.\n\n1343\n01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,110\nSo with that it is 193.\n\n1344\n01:03:56,110 --> 01:04:03,296\nAnd that includes the keyboard parts the\nbreakup boards and the wires and stuff.\n\n1345\n01:04:03,296 --> 01:04:04,641\n>> Does that include shipping?\n\n1346\n01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,152\n>> Yes it does.\n\n1347\n01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:07,555\n>> All right,\ndid the other one include shipping?\n\n1348\n01:04:11,816 --> 01:04:16,189\nAnd yes it does,\nbecause from those people,\n\n1349\n01:04:16,189 --> 01:04:22,210\nif we get a certain amount ordered\nthen we get free shipping.\n\n1350\n01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:22,960\n>> Nice.\n\n1351\n01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,250\nAll right, good.\n\n1352\n01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,190\n>> So does it include shipping?\n\n1353\n01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,882\n>> Let me just add that so I don't ask\nmyself that same question later on.\n\n1354\n01:04:29,882 --> 01:04:32,785\n531 with trackball.\n\n1355\n01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,772\n>> And shipping!\n\n1356\n01:04:34,772 --> 01:04:36,650\n>> With shipping.\n\n1357\n01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:40,080\nAnd the other one, you had a specific\nquote, I'm looking over at your notes, and\n\n1358\n01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,000\nI just see pen for Hagstrom.\n\n1359\n01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,410\nIs that an actual quote from them or?\n\n1360\n01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,329\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay, so not an estimate.\n\n1361\n01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:52,790\nIt's important to know whether you've\ngot an estimate or an actual number.\n\n1362\n01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:54,590\nAn actual number I can rely on.\n\n1363\n01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,010\nI know that's what the price is gonna be,\nthere's some risk it might change.\n\n1364\n01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:01,610\nBut an estimate, a few or\na couple, words like that,\n\n1365\n01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:04,192\nthose are a project\nmanagers worst enemies.\n\n1366\n01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:08,220\nAll right, so\nI think that's it for items right?\n\n1367\n01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,218\nOh, there's the software,\nright, so HyperSpin.\n\n1368\n01:05:10,218 --> 01:05:12,722\n>> All free.\n\n1369\n01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:16,490\n>> Oh, HyperSpin is free?\n\n1370\n01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:21,403\n>> HyperSpin is free,\nnow there are some sync type utilities\n\n1371\n01:05:21,403 --> 01:05:25,780\nthat will make the process much,\nmuch easier.\n\n1372\n01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:30,960\nThose ones are not free but if we went\nstraight up super manual, it's all free.\n\n1373\n01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,324\n>> All right,\nlet's say we wanted the sync software,\n\n1374\n01:05:33,324 --> 01:05:35,310\ndo you know the prices offhand, or?\n\n1375\n01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:39,706\n>> Yeah it was, I believe like 30 bucks.\n\n1376\n01:05:39,706 --> 01:05:44,090\n>> That was for what?\n\n1377\n01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:47,060\n>> There were two pieces of them,\nI don't remember of the top of my head.\n\n1378\n01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,780\nBut there was-\n>> Okay, I'm gonna add a note.\n\n1379\n01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,398\n>> All right, yeah.\n\n1380\n01:05:50,398 --> 01:05:55,853\n>> Missing quote information for\nconvenience software, right?\n\n1381\n01:05:55,853 --> 01:05:57,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it's not something we necessarily\n\n1382\n01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:00,570\nneed, but if we had it it would be easier,\nso I'd like to know how much it costs.\n\n1383\n01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:02,870\nBecause if it's a reasonable amount,\n\n1384\n01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:06,450\nthen that convenience software\nmay help us meet our deadline.\n\n1385\n01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:10,580\nVersus if we don't have the convenient\nsoftware and you've got to do a lot of\n\n1386\n01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:14,000\nadvanced programming or whatever, all of\nthe sudden your, I think I can get it\n\n1387\n01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,755\ndone in five days becomes,\nwell we're on day ten and I'm not done.\n\n1388\n01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:20,360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If it's a matter of spending $50 extra\n\n1389\n01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,230\nto ensure the project is done,\nI'm willing to do that, but\n\n1390\n01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,780\nif it's several hundred dollars,\nprobably not.\n\n1391\n01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:29,979\nSo I can't make that judgement\nright now without knowing, so\n\n1392\n01:06:29,979 --> 01:06:31,400\nwe need more information.\n\n1393\n01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,417\n>> Okay.\n\n1394\n01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:37,484\n>> All right, and\nthe graphics overlay Rob,\n\n1395\n01:06:37,484 --> 01:06:40,040\nwe'd have to get a quote\nfrom somebody right?\n\n1396\n01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,550\n>> Yeah, I'd have to get a quote.\n\n1397\n01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:43,221\n>> Okay so we've got to note that.\n\n1398\n01:06:43,221 --> 01:06:44,139\n>> If it's assigned to\nme then that's good.\n\n1399\n01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:47,418\n>> Okay, and I will assign that to Rob.\n\n1400\n01:06:47,418 --> 01:06:52,070\nI need to do better about, and\n\n1401\n01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,760\nRob you already designed the graphics\noverlay so I'm gonna flag that as done.\n\n1402\n01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,410\nOh!\n>> Oh!\n\n1403\n01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:56,410\n>> Oh, there it goes.\n\n1404\n01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:58,800\n>> It doesn't leave it in the list\nwhen you flag it as done?\n\n1405\n01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,700\n>> I guess not.\n\n1406\n01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,570\n>> All right well,\nlet's let that sit then.\n\n1407\n01:07:01,570 -->

right.\n\n1412\n01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:18,890\nObviously we have some more\ninformation we need to get.\n\n1413\n01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:19,840\nWe got a basic schedule.\n\n1414\n01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,530\nWe'll probably need to do some\nlittle revisions on that.\n\n1415\n01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:25,720\nI don't think we'll do another\nshow covering the revisions,\n\n1416\n01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,520\nI think we'll just get the information\ntogether, tighten it up, and then when we\n\n1417\n01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,900\nkick off an execution we'll do another\nspecial and kind of see the progress of\n\n1418\n01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,600\nour work as we go through cuz we need\nto do monitoring and controlling.\n\n1419\n01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,500\nNormally I’d also launch into\nrisk management at this point.\n\n1420\n01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,570\nBut on a small project like this with\na reasonably small budget there's\n\n1421\n01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:47,140\nnot a whole lot of risk that\nwe're gonna have, right.\n\n1422\n01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:50,780\nSick days, if either of you guys get\nsick that could delay the project a bit.\n\n1423\n01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:53,730\nBecause I don't have a hard deadline\nI'm not so worried about that.\n\n1424\n01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:55,620\nOur schedule can slip.\n\n1425\n01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,690\nCost is the one thing\nI don't want to slip.\n\n1426\n01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:58,890\nYou know, I put that in the charter,\n\n1427\n01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:01,700\nthere is a maximum amount of\nmoney I'm willing to spend.\n\n1428\n01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:05,000\nAnd if we hit that maximum amount,\nI'm not gonna be happy.\n\n1429\n01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,980\nSo, I'm a little more rigid on that budget\npiece then I am on the schedule piece.\n\n1430\n01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:14,220\nBut, all right can you guys\nthink of anything else?\n\n1431\n01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,640\n>> I don't think so.\n\n1432\n01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,180\n>> All right, you guys are all\nassigned this in Asana, so\n\n1433\n01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,840\nit is attached to you guys so\ngo and review it on your own.\n\n1434\n01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,075\nWe’re gonna have another\nmeeting next week.\n\n1435\n01:08:26,075 --> 01:08:28,510\nLets just do same day, same time.\n\n1436\n01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:31,930\nAnd so we'll do another meeting.\n\n1437\n01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:34,850\nLet's bring those quotes,\nthe things that I've put on here that I\n\n1438\n01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,990\nneed to get quotes on,\nlet's get those together so\n\n1439\n01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:40,170\nthat we can finalize a lot information and\nget it put together.\n\n1440\n01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:42,481\nIn fact, don't wait for the meeting for\nthat, get that information to me earlier.\n\n1441\n01:08:42,481 --> 01:08:43,100\n>> [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n1442\n01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,310\n>> And then that way,\nwhen it comes time for that meeting,\n\n1443\n01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:48,650\nwe should have everything, you know,\nall our ducks should be in a row.\n\n1444\n01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:51,500\nWe can just do a final review,\nsign off on our plan, you know,\n\n1445\n01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,960\nactually draft our full plan and be done.\n\n1446\n01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,810\nI mean, well,\ndone with the plan so, sound good?\n\n1447\n01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:58,160\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1448\n01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,610\n>> All right, well ITPro TV viewers,\nI hope you guys enjoyed that.\n\n1449\n01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:06,000\nI know It seems kind of rambly,\nbut you kinda get an idea of,\n\n1450\n01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,430\nwhen you look at something,\none person's perspective is not enough.\n\n1451\n01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:10,430\nYou gotta get more\ninformation from the others.\n\n1452\n01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:13,740\nIf you can get everybody together,\nsit them around a table, communicate,\n\n1453\n01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:15,320\nyou can find out all of the things.\n\n1454\n01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,980\nYou may think you have all of the\ninformation you need, but there's always\n\n1455\n01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:21,670\nsomething extra that you can get, so\nidentifying that, that's kinda key.\n\n1456\n01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,362\nAnd all part of good project management,\nso.\n\n1457\n01:09:24,362 --> 01:09:27,660\nAll right well stay tuned, we're gonna\nhave more of these specials as the arcade\n\n1458\n01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:31,885\ncabinet, slash debacle continues.\n\n1459\n01:09:31,885 --> 01:09:34,787\nAnd hey, this time next month\nmaybe we'll be playing,\n\n1460\n01:09:34,787 --> 01:09:37,087\nsome kind of open source\nversion of Galaga.\n\n1461\n01:09:37,087 --> 01:09:37,961\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nice.\n\n1462\n01:09:37,961 --> 01:09:39,586\n>> Okay.\nAll right, stay tuned, we'll see you then.\n\n1463\n01:09:39,586 -->

--> 00:00:38,920\nTo another episode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,860\nI'm Don Pezet today with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,990\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,360\n>> It is going well today.\n\n7\n00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,060\nI am very pleased to announce that I read\nthat Miley Cyrus did not twerk one time\n\n8\n00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,140\nat the VMA Awards.\n\n9\n00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,868\n>> Really?\n>> Yes.\n\n10\n00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:54,140\n>> So\nthis shows how much I follow the news.\n\n11\n00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,275\nWhen were the VMA awards?\n\n12\n00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:57,184\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yesterday I think.\n\n13\n00:00:57,184 --> 00:00:58,066\nOr the day before.\n\n14\n00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:58,669\nI don't know.\n\n15\n00:00:58,669 --> 00:00:59,947\n>> [LAUGH] Timely information.\n\n16\n00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:04,752\nAll right, well we are diving\nright back into the world of pmp.\n\n17\n00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:07,050\n>> That's right.\n>> Project manager professional today.\n\n18\n00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,010\nFor those of you watching live,\n\n19\n00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,750\nwe took a little bit of a hiatus between\nthe first half of the show and this one.\n\n20\n00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,500\nBut for those of you watching recorded,\n\n21\n00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,160\nknow that we're just another\nclick on the webpage.\n\n22\n00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,810\nSo what we're doing today\nis we are cracking open\n\n23\n00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,830\nan all new process group, right?\n\n24\n00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,750\nWe are diving into the wonderful\nworld of the executing process group.\n\n25\n00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,628\nSo we have recorded more than\nhalf the show at this point.\n\n26\n00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:34,424\nAnd over half the show fell in\nthese first two process groups,\n\n27\n00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:38,807\ninitiating and planning, planning\nbeing the one where a lot of our work\n\n28\n00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,305\nis look at all those processes in there.\n\n29\n00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:44,795\nToday we're going to dive into executing,\nand aside from closing,\n\n30\n00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:47,340\nexecuting is really one\nof the shorter ones.\n\n31\n00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,810\nYou wouldn't think it is,\n\n32\n00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,550\nbecause in a project, executing is\nwhere we spend most of our time.\n\n33\n00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,210\nBut what is executing?\n\n34\n00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,160\nIt's doing the work that we planned for,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:03,090\nWe planned all sorts of work to be done,\nnow we need to do it, right?\n\n36\n00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,850\nAnd then what you said Ronnie is if\nsomeone is doing it someone has got to\n\n37\n00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,210\nmanage it, right?\n\n38\n00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,390\nSo, this is where our\nneeds start to diverge.\n\n39\n00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,860\nWe start splitting apart what's happening\nhere and you'll find that executing, for\n\n40\n00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,190\nus as a project manager,\nis actually kind of boring.\n\n41\n00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,760\nRight?\n\n42\n00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,150\nBut, not truly, we don't have a lot to\ndo with executing, we're monitoring.\n\n43\n00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,680\nSo while other people are doing\nthe actual work of the project,\n\n44\n00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,750\nwe need to be managing and\n\n45\n00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,820\nmonitoring, making sure things are going\nthe way the they're supposed to.\n\n46\n00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,840\nWell, we're not ready for\nmonitoring just yet.\n\n47\n00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,180\nWe're gonna dive into executing, so\nwe're gonna look at one side of things.\n\n48\n00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,890\nAnd it may seem that we're moving\nkinda quickly through the material,\n\n49\n00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,960\nthat we don't have a lot of data here,\nbut the reason is,\n\n50\n00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,910\nis as the project manager there's\nnot a lot you do in executing.\n\n51\n00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,010\nAnd you know, I've shown this diagram\nmultiple times during the show,\n\n52\n00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,380\nthis one, where sure,\nwe have initiation, then planning,\n\n53\n00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,210\nthen execution, then monitoring and\ncontrolling, then closing.\n\n54\n00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,590\nBut if you were to actually diagram it\nout, it's more like this right here\n\n55\n00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,340\nwhere execution and monitoring and\ncontrolling happen at the same time.\n\n56\n00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:09,200\nAll right, and if we were to go\nback to our process diagram,\n\n57\n00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,420\nif you were to combine these\ntwo processes together,\n\n58\n00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,920\nyou'll see that it actually\nwould be quite a bit of stuff.\n\n59\n00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,810\nAnd it would even compete with planning.\n\n60\n00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:22,280\nAll right, so all that being said,\nlet's dive into this stuff, right?\n\n61\n00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,380\nSo we are going to take a look at\ndirect and manage project work.\n\n62\n00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,370\nThat's going to be our first\nprocess group to tackle.\n\n63\n00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,680\nAnd you'll see that theres not\na whole heck of a lot to this one.\n\n64\n00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,240\nIn fact, I don't think there is a single\nthing on this slide that is new\n\n65\n00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,640\nfrom what we've talked about previously.\n\n66\n00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,194\nWhen we go into execution,\nwe basically tell people, okay guys,\n\n67\n00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:42,877\nyou know that schedule we made?\n\n68\n00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,433\nDo it, right?\n\n69\n00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,128\nLook at the days, figure out what\nyou are suppose to be doing.\n\n70\n00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:47,475\nGet to work.\n\n71\n00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:48,680\nI mean that budget we created.\n\n72\n00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,300\nGet to cutting those checks.\n\n73\n00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,900\nOr whatever you do the thing\nwe planned on you doing.\n\n74\n00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,900\nSo when it comes to directing and\n\n75\n00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,440\nmanaging that, we're really just\nmaking sure that it happens, right.\n\n76\n00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,200\nSo most of our tools and\n\n77\n00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,980\ntechniques here are really just gonna\ncenter around information gathering.\n\n78\n00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,390\nHow do we find out about\nthe work people are doing.\n\n79\n00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,400\nWell the people who are doing the work,\n\n80\n00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,190\nthey're looking at our\nproject management plan.\n\n81\n00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,850\nThey're looking at that plan that we came\nup with that's telling them what to do.\n\n82\n00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,460\nIf there had been Change Requests\nthat had been approved,\n\n83\n00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,230\nthose become part of the plan too, right?\n\n84\n00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,790\nSo that's where they're\nfinding out what to do.\n\n85\n00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,270\nAll right.\n\n86\n00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,510\nWhen a company starts actually doing work,\n\n87\n00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,560\nthere's Enterprise Environmental Factors\nand Organizational Process Assets.\n\n88\n00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,790\nWe've seen those on every process so far.\n\n89\n00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,400\nSo basically your company has a way\nof doing work, and that's it.\n\n90\n00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,350\nThat's the way of doing it.\n\n91\n00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,970\nThey have certain forms they fill out.\n\n92\n00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,150\nTime cards, punch clocks whatever,\n\n93\n00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,780\nall that's stuff that's involved\nin actually doing the work.\n\n94\n00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,760\n>> Right.\n\n95\n00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,510\n>> For us as a project manager though\nall we're doing is gathering data.\n\n96\n00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,770\nAnd we gather data through\na few different systems.\n\n97\n00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,270\nThe first one is expert judgement.\n\n98\n00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,550\nUse your noodle or your eyes in this case.\n\n99\n00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,900\nJust look, see what's going on.\n\n100\n00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,280\nKeep tabs on people and\nmake sure they're doing their work.\n\n101\n00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,520\nMeetings are another way.\n\n102\n00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280\nRight?\nWe do these here at ITPro TV.\n\n103\n00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,550\nEvery morning we have a stand up meeting.\n\n104\n00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,500\nWe get everybody together and\n\n105\n00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,910\nwe exchange information about\nwhat we've been working on and\n\n106\n00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,670\nwhat we're going to be working on, so\nthat everybody knows where everything is.\n\n107\n00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,950\nThose meetings are pivotal.\n\n108\n00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,620\nAnd boy, you hear more and\n\n109\n00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,570\nmore about these all the time, with other\nmethodologies like agile and scrum and\n\n110\n00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,240\nall that, where they're really pushing\ngathering data through meetings.\n\n111\n00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:25,725\nMeetings are a slippery\nslope [LAUGH] Friday.\n\n112\n00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,855\nI'm not a big fan of meetings\nthat are unstructured.\n\n113\n00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:30,885\nSo you need to have structured\nmeetings to really be successful.\n\n114\n00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:33,525\nYou wanna make sure that you don't bring\na bunch of people in for a meeting and\n\n115\n00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,700\nthen sit there and\nget nothing out of it, right.\n\n116\n00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,260\nI think I talked about it\nin another episode, so\n\n117\n00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,550\nI don't want to dive too deep into it.\n\n118\n00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,830\nI have a few rules for meetings which are,\n\n119\n00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,160\nrule number one,\ninvite as few people as possible.\n\n120\n00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,140\nSmaller meetings\nare always more effective.\n\n121\n00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,530\nRule number two, every person that comes\nto the meeting, at the end of the meeting\n\n122\n00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,340\nthey should have an action item, they\nshould have something they need to do.\n\n123\n00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,020\nIf they don't have an action item,\nthey didn't need to be in the meeting,\n\n124\n00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,090\nyou could have just gotten\nthe information from them ahead of time.\n\n125\n00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,030\nSo those are just some of\nthe rules that I have, and\n\n126\n00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,250\nthen number three is always\nhave an agenda, right?\n\n127\n00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,800\nDon't just go into a meeting willy nilly\nwith no actual plan, have something ready,\n\n128\n00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,100\nhave a list of topics you want to talk\nabout, and make sure you distribute it\n\n129\n00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,550\nbefore the meeting so people can prepare,\nthey may need to bring data with them.\n\n130\n00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,510\nYou don't want to have a second meeting\nbecause the first meeting didn't\n\n131\n00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,250\nhave all the information.\n\n132\n00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:25,120\nAll right, but the one I skipped\nover is probably the most useful and\n\n133\n00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,470\nthat's the project management\ninformation system the PMIS.\n\n134\n00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,540\nAnd that is a pivotal tool that\nI know we've talked about.\n\n135\n00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,280\n>> Yeah.\n\n136\n00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,580\nNow in this process, right,\nfor us as project managers,\n\n137\n00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,450\nthis is where we actually have to\nkeep track of that triangle, right?\n\n138\n00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,460\nThe constraint triangle that we actually\nhave here of the project cost, the time,\n\n139\n00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,880\nand the overall scope here.\n\n140\n00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,700\nAnd the easiest and most effective way for\n\n141\n00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,630\nus to be able to do that is to use that\nproject management instrument that we have\n\n142\n00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,210\nbecause without it right\nthe project continues to grow.\n\n143\n00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,210\nIt continues to, so\nnow that is actually executing, right.\n\n144\n00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,905\nAll of the sudden it just\ngrows beyond our control.\n\n145\n00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:03,398\nBut being able to keep track of it all in\none place is very essential for us, and\n\n146\n00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:08,379\nfor us to keep everything underneath that\nparticular constraint triangle is going to\n\n147\n00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:11,698\nbe how we successfully complete\nour overall project, so\n\n148\n00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,981\nwe want to make sure\nthat we have a hold or\n\n149\n00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:17,535\nat least we understand whatever\ntool we're gonna be using.\n\n150\n00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:20,474\n>> Yeah and what tool do you use,\nit's up to you, right.\n\n151\n00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,970\nThere's a ton of them out\nthere you can pick and choose.\n\n152\n00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,520\nLet me just give you an example,\n\n153\n00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,840\nmaybe you use Microsoft project\nto do your project management.\n\n154\n00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,170\nWell as people are out there doing\nthe work, as they're executing.\n\n155\n00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,420\nThey're filling out time cards.\n\n156\n00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,880\nThey're saying, yeah, I work from 8 AM\nto 5 PM Monday through Friday, or hey,\n\n157\n00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,860\nI did some overtime this day, or whatever.\n\n158\n00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,750\nThey're submitting those\ntime cards to you,\n\n159\n00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,960\nand then you punch them\ninto Microsoft Project.\n\n160\n00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,500\nRight?\n\n161\n00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,420\nOr maybe you've got\nMicrosoft Project Server.\n\n162\n00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,280\nThis is nice.\n\n163\n00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,640\nBecause then there's a web page and\n\n164\n00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,250\ninstead of people filling out their own\ntime card they go to the web page and\n\n165\n00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,730\nthey put their time in there and\nit's already entered into the system.\n\n166\n00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,330\n>> Yes.\n>> They do it for you.\n\n167\n00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,017\nThen all you have to do is review it.\n\n168\n00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:54,834\nThat's kind of nice.\n\n169\n00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:56,816\nMaybe use some other system.\n\n170\n00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:58,151\nIt's completely up to you.\n\n171\n00:07:58,151 --> 00:07:59,810\nEverybody uses different\nsolutions it seems.\n\n172\n00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,634\nAnd you just find the one that's right.\n\n173\n00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:07,279\nJust remember: with a PMIS, the thing\nto remember on the exam especially,\n\n174\n00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,890\nis a PMIS is only as good as\nthe data you put into it, all right?\n\n175\n00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,110\nIf you haven't put data into it yet,\nit's not going to be very effective.\n\n176\n00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,190\nSo, for example,\nyou might be looking at your PMIS, and\n\n177\n00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,340\nit tells you your project is on schedule\nand under budget; things look great.\n\n178\n00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,890\nBut meanwhile sitting\nright there on your desk,\n\n179\n00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,080\nyou've got ten overtime sheets\nthat you have to enter in, and\n\n180\n00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,360\nall of a sudden you will find that your\nschedule is good, but your budget is shot.\n\n181\n00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,630\nYou've gone way over\nbudget on overtime fees.\n\n182\n00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,440\nYour PMIS doesn't know that yet, because\nyou haven't given it the data, yet.\n\n183\n00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,050\nAll right?\n\n184\n00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,110\nSo that's why when it\ncomes to the PMP exam,\n\n185\n00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,920\nthey don't really focus on\na PMIS really very much.\n\n186\n00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,200\nThey ask questions about it but\nthey don't show you one.\n\n187\n00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,380\nThey don't say do this in\nMicrosoft Project or Timberline, or\n\n188\n00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,710\nwhatever program it is that you use,\nPrimavera I guess that would be bigger.\n\n189\n00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,590\nSo they don't do that, and that's\nbecause everybody uses different stuff.\n\n190\n00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,710\nAnd an effective project manager is doing\nboth, using the PMIS and using their own\n\n191\n00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,980\nexpert judgement, that number one tool and\ntechnique right there, all right.\n\n192\n00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,750\nNow as we monitor the work getting done,\nwe generate some outputs.\n\n193\n00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,580\nNow obviously if work is being done, then\nthere's not much of an output coming from\n\n194\n00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,050\nus, there's output coming from the people\nin the form of deliverables, right.\n\n195\n00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,330\nThey finish their job and\n\n196\n00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,660\nthey create whatever it is they\nwere supposed to create, or\n\n197\n00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,745\nthey perform whatever activity it was\nthey were suppose to perform, all right.\n\n198\n00:09:29,745 --> 00:09:34,360\nWe're building a house, and we have some\ndrywallers coming in to put the walls up.\n\n199\n00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,700\nThen when they're done with the work,\n\n200\n00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,220\nI should be able to walk in the house and\nsee drywall everywhere.\n\n201\n00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,680\nNot see struts and beams,\nand all that stuff.\n\n202\n00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,920\nBut, if they're not done yet,\nthen at a minimum,\n\n203\n00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,310\nthey should be delivering\nwork performance data.\n\n204\n00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,960\nHow much work they got done,\nhow many hours they put in,\n\n205\n00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,538\nhow much we need to pay them:\ntime sheets and progress reports.\n\n206\n00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:59,880\nThose are our big things that come\nout of the outputs, on a good day.\n\n207\n00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,720\nSometimes, there's a bad day.\n\n208\n00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,260\nSometimes things don't go quite right.\n\n209\n00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,860\nSometimes things don't match up with\nour plan that we defined earlier.\n\n210\n00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,050\nAnd when that happen,s we end\nup with change requests, right.\n\n211\n00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,340\nSo if something's not working\nout according to plan,\n\n212\n00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,270\nwe need to do a change request,\nand we need to get it approved.\n\n213\n00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,940\nIf it's approved, great, if it's not\napproved, well now we've gotta find some\n\n214\n00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,810\nother way to correct for\nthis divergence with our plan.\n\n215\n00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,710\nAll right, and the same thing goes for\nthese last couple of ones.\n\n216\n00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,860\nProject management plan updates,\nand project document updates.\n\n217\n00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,570\nThe most common one that\nI update at this point,\n\n218\n00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,370\nare the risk management plans, right?\n\n219\n00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,400\nCuz we have our risk register where\nwe're keeping track of all that, and\n\n220\n00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,130\nthat's designed to be a living document,\n\n221\n00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,650\nwhere you're updating your odds of\neffect and things of those nature.\n\n222\n00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,040\nSo you're constantly updating that\ninformation as you move through it.\n\n223\n00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,630\nThat's all a part of direct and\nmanage project work.\n\n224\n00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n225\n00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,940\n>> All right.\nSo as far as processes go,\n\n226\n00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,120\nthis one's pretty straightforward.\n\n227\n00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,550\nAnd in fact,\nyou could boil it down to what?\n\n228\n00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,720\nTwo sentences, right?\n\n229\n00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,120\nTell people to work, and\nmake sure they do it.\n\n230\n00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,280\nThat's really what this\nprocess is all about.\n\n231\n00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n232\n00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,100\nAt this point in our lives, right,\nand especially as project managers.\n\n233\n00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,990\nWe should no longer feel, I shouldn't say\nthat, we should no longer need to feel\n\n234\n00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,170\nthe idea of actually jumping right in,\nand having to do everything by ourselves.\n\n235\n00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,630\nAgain, when you're actually going for your\nPMP, you know, I delegate it out, I just\n\n236\n00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,410\nneed to make sure that what I delegate\nout is actually done at this point.\n\n237\n00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,420\nAnd that's why using those tools\nare actually very helpful for us.\n\n238\n00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,540\nSo directing and managing for us,\nagain is just the idea of monitoring,\n\n239\n00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,190\nmaking sure it's done.\n\n240\n00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,090\n>> All right, so what else do we have?\n\n241\n00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,990\nPeople are doing their work.\n\n242\n00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,790\n>> Yep.\n>> Right.\n\n243\n00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,640\nNow some other things need to happen.\n\n244\n00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,910\nYou might remember in the planning phase,\nwe went through quality assurance or\n\n245\n00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,670\nwait, quality management in general.\n\n246\n00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,750\nQuality management is made of two pieces,\nquality assurance and\n\n247\n00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,660\nquality control, right?\n\n248\n00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,940\nQuality assurance is stopping\nproblems before they happen.\n\n249\n00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,340\nMaking sure that our systems are optimized\nand functioning properly, to stop or\n\n250\n00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,510\nprevent a problem from\nhappening in the first place.\n\n251\n00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,080\nQuality control is detecting and\ncorrecting the problem, after it occurs.\n\n252\n00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,740\nRight?\n\n253\n00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,070\nWhen we did quality management, so\nplanned quality management, we did both.\n\n254\n00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,640\nRight?\nWe kind of planned for both.\n\n255\n00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,520\nWell now, in executing,\nyou're executing your quality assurance,\n\n256\n00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,090\nand in monitoring and\ncontrolling we'll do quality control.\n\n257\n00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,610\nAll right?\n\n258\n00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,040\nSo, they're kind of broken in pieces here,\nand\n\n259\n00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,700\nthe reason is, the project manager is\ntypically over here doing quality control.\n\n260\n00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,410\nRight?\n\n261\n00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,720\nBut the work package owners.\n\n262\n00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,300\nThe people who are actually\ndoing the work.\n\n263\n00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,520\nThey're the ones who do\nthe quality assurance, okay?\n\n264\n00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,810\nMaybe my project has a roofing\nthat needs to be done.\n\n265\n00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,160\nSo we've got to put\nshingles across the roof.\n\n266\n00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,830\nAnd one of the risks that I had to\nquality, was that somebody could\n\n267\n00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,400\nfall off the roof and break a leg,\nand have to go to the hospital.\n\n268\n00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,925\nAnd now I'd be short one person,\nwhich would put me behind schedule.\n\n269\n00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:50,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n270\n00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,150\nSo as part of my quality assurance,\nI might of said,\n\n271\n00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,330\nyou know what, we're gonna plan for this.\n\n272\n00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,450\nWe're gonna make sure that all the workers\nwho are up there on the roof have\n\n273\n00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,290\nharnesses.\n\n274\n00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,940\nSo that of they fall, they'll be safe.\n\n275\n00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,910\nThey've got a harness.\n\n276\n00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,980\nThat's gonna ensure that\nI have all my people,\n\n277\n00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,970\nthat the roof gets done on time and\nthat we move forward.\n\n278\n00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,270\nSo who's gonna make sure that those\npeople are wearing harnesses?\n\n279\n00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,780\nWell, that's their job.\n\n280\n00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,000\nThat's what they are supposed\nto do as part of roofing,\n\n281\n00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000\nthey need to harness up and get up there.\n\n282\n00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,560\nSo they're doing quality assurance.\n\n283\n00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,500\nThey're putting on a harness and\ngetting up there,\n\n284\n00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,880\nto make sure they don't get hurt so\nthey can do their work.\n\n285\n00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,770\nRight, that's one example.\n\n286\n00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,360\nOther examples of quality assurance are\njust, you know, measuring the performance,\n\n287\n00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,930\nor making sure the work\nis actually getting done.\n\n288\n00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,240\nIf they tell me it's gonna take\nfour days to get the roofing done,\n\n289\n00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,440\nat the end of day one,\nI expect the work to be about 25% done.\n\n290\n00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,260\nAnd at the end of day two,\nthey should be halfway.\n\n291\n00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,000\nAnd if I go and look and they aren't\neven there, then there's a problem.\n\n292\n00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,820\nRight?\n\n293\n00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,780\nI think in an earlier show\nI made an example of,\n\n294\n00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,890\nif you are like a blue jean factory,\nright?\n\n295\n00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,880\nAnd you're manufacturing a thousand\npairs of blue jeans at a time, and\n\n296\n00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,980\nyou want to get your defect rate down.\n\n297\n00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,340\nHow can we prevent problems ahead of time?\n\n298\n00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,210\nOne of the examples I gave,\n\n299\n00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,360\nwas doing routine maintenance\non the equipment, right?\n\n300\n00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,750\nThe equipment's not broken, but\nwe do maintenance on it anyway,\n\n301\n00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,100\nto prevent a problem from happening.\n\n302\n00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,210\nSo perform quality assurance means,\ndoing that maintenance.\n\n303\n00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,260\nGetting the worker, the support tech or\nwhatever, to come out and lubricate,\n\n304\n00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,760\nor replace parts, or whatever it\nis that they do on that machine,\n\n305\n00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,290\nto prevent problems in the first place.\n\n306\n00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,880\nAs a project manager, we just need to\nmake sure that's getting done, right?\n\n307\n00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,250\nWe're not the ones who do it,\nother people are.\n\n308\n00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,510\nBut we do have a whole process group for\nthis, let me pull it up.\n\n309\n00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,320\nAnd we'll go perform quality assurance.\n\n310\n00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,050\nNow our inputs on this,\n\n311\n00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,310\nare a lot of things that I was\ntalking about a moment ago.\n\n312\n00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,700\nOur quality management plan.\n\n313\n00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,760\nWe planned for how we want to do this.\n\n314\n00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,080\nThat's obviously going to be an input.\n\n315\n00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,950\nIf I can say it.\n\n316\n00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,460\nProcess improvement plan.\n\n317\n00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,590\nThere are many organizations that\ndo continual process improvement.\n\n318\n00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,770\nJust because things\nare running smooth now,\n\n319\n00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,700\ndoesn't mean we can't find new\nways to make it run more smoothly.\n\n320\n00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,020\nSo if we have a plan for that,\nthen that's an input also.\n\n321\n00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,570\nAfter that we've got our quality metrics.\n\n322\n00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,150\nI mentioned something like,\n\n323\n00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,640\nhow long I think it's gonna\ntake that roof to get done.\n\n324\n00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,680\nIf they tell me four days,\nand they do it in order so\n\n325\n00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,950\nat the end of day they should be 50% done.\n\n326\n00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,960\nThat's my metric.\n\n327\n00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,580\nHow do I measure that?\n\n328\n00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,920\nMaybe I measure by square\nfootage of the roof.\n\n329\n00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,210\nSo if it's 2,000 square foot of roof, they\n\n330\n00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,850\nshould be 1,000 square foot done when they\nare halfway through their time, right?\n\n331\n00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,600\nSo I can use that as my quality metric.\n\n332\n00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,960\nWhen we define those in our plan,\nnow we're just going out and\n\n333\n00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,230\nmeasuring them, right?\n\n334\n00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,190\nMaking sure that we're staying\non schedule and moving along.\n\n335\n00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,210\nQuality control is also a part of this.\n\n336\n00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,270\nNow I know this is quality assurance.\n\n337\n00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,800\nQuality control is dissecting\na problem after it happened, but\n\n338\n00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,820\nwe still feed data in from that too.\n\n339\n00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,528\nAnd then any other project documents\nthat we have, because there's\n\n340\n00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:46,887\na lot of data spread throughout them, the\nmost important one being really our scope,\n\n341\n00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:49,657\nbecause we're trying to make sure\nthat we've maintained our scope.\n\n342\n00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,958\n>> All right.\n\n343\n00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:51,940\n>> All right.\n\n344\n00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,600\nAfter that we've got quality\nmanagement and control tools.\n\n345\n00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,021\nAnd the quality management and\ncontrol tools,\n\n346\n00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:59,812\ncan be a number of different\nthings that are out there.\n\n347\n00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:02,866\nAnd we're gonna see some of these,\nlater on.\n\n348\n00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:05,884\nWhy is that little text box gonna...\n\n349\n00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:07,811\nThere we go.\n\n350\n00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:10,030\nSo there's a number of different\ntools that are out there but\n\n351\n00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,002\nthey're simple things usually,\nlike checklists.\n\n352\n00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:15,100\nSo when somebody's gonna get up there and\ndo that roof work,\n\n353\n00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,070\nthey should have a checklist that says\ndid I get enough tile to take up with me?\n\n354\n00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,540\nDo I have enough Visqueen to lay down?\n\n355\n00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,100\nDo I have my harness on?\n\n356\n00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,660\nThese are all the little things\nthat we need to check off\n\n357\n00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,970\nbefore we hop on up on the roof and\nstart to get to work.\n\n358\n00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,790\n>> A lot of times, we simply do the idea\nof also, like a flow process, where you\n\n359\n00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,790\nactually go, okay, did I complete this\nstep, did I do the next step here to make\n\n360\n00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,833\nsure that everything goes through the\nentire process and we don't skip steps.\n\n361\n00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,107\nOne of the hardest things about\nthe idea of quality assurance is\n\n362\n00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:45,580\nthat sometimes you'll skip steps\nwhen you don't really mean to.\n\n363\n00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,315\nAnd so by having some type of response,\nbeing able to actually go, okay,\n\n364\n00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:52,330\nI know what's going to be our\nquality metric at this point,\n\n365\n00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,740\nthose are some of the tools that\nyou might also implement instead.\n\n366\n00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,860\n>> Other things like quality audits,\n\n367\n00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,810\nwe're gonna talk more about quality\naudits under quality control, but\n\n368\n00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:07,530\na quality audit is usually, well,\nit takes many forms, but most commonly,\n\n369\n00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,610\nit's when a project manager, or somebody\ndelegated by the project manager, visits\n\n370\n00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,460\nthe site where the work is being done and\nperforms an audit to see where we're at.\n\n371\n00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,990\nThis is one of our main\ninformation gathering techniques.\n\n372\n00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,540\nWe trust our employees and our employees\nare giving us progress reports.\n\n373\n00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,790\nSo that's good, we want that, but\n\n374\n00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,210\nit's never a bad idea to go and\nreaffirm that same knowledge.\n\n375\n00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,670\nGo and do your own visual inspection\nto see that the things are actually\n\n376\n00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,585\nprogressing the way that they\nshould be progressing and\n\n377\n00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:36,700\nthat they are where\nthey're being reported.\n\n378\n00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,800\nI remember this story which was I was\nliving in Seattle at the time and\n\n379\n00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,685\nthere was a guy in Seattle who had\nthe opportunity to buy a house in Detroit,\n\n380\n00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,540\nMichigan.\n\n381\n00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,280\nIf you're not in the U.S., Detroit,\nMichigan is a very big city that\n\n382\n00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,330\nis basically collapsing, it's gone\nbankrupt, it's in really bad shape.\n\n383\n00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,630\nSo this guy had a chance to buy a house\nfor $5,000 which is a ridiculously small\n\n384\n00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,840\namount of money, and\nso he buys this house.\n\n385\n00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,545\nNow, he never actually went there.\n\n386\n00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:08,079\nSo people were sending him pictures of\nthe house, and he looked at it, and\n\n387\n00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,956\nhe bought it sight unseen, and he hired a\ncontractor out there in Detroit to go and\n\n388\n00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:15,055\nremodel it to make it livable\nagain because it wasn't livable.\n\n389\n00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:19,299\nAnd the contractor said, yeah, give me six\nmonths and I think it was like $100,000,\n\n390\n00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,716\nsomething like that, and\nhe would fix the place up and\n\n391\n00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:23,617\nturn it around to where you could sell it.\n\n392\n00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:25,080\nWell, there were two problems,\n\n393\n00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,852\nthe first problem was the guy\ndidn't know the neighborhood and\n\n394\n00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:30,740\nthe majority of the neighborhood\nhad been what to do they call it?\n\n395\n00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,000\n>> Condemned?\n[LAUGH] >> Condemned, that's it.\n\n396\n00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,420\nYeah, it had been condemned, so\n\n397\n00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,980\nthe majority of\nthe neighborhood was unlivable.\n\n398\n00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,530\nEven if you made this one house livable,\n\n399\n00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,720\nnobody would want to live there cuz\nit's surrounded by condemned stuff.\n\n400\n00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,521\nThe other thing was, the contractor was\nsending him pictures of the work to show\n\n401\n00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:47,055\nthe progress that was being done, and\nthe pictures were of other houses.\n\n402\n00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:49,352\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And he wasn't actually doing the work,\n\n403\n00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:51,360\nhe had basically stolen the guy's money.\n\n404\n00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,280\nSo for months he kept getting\nthese picture status reports, and\n\n405\n00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,480\nthey were all fake, and it wasn't until\nhe actually went out to Detroit to\n\n406\n00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,990\nlook at this place that he realized that\nnot a single bit of work had been done.\n\n407\n00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,153\nAnd by that point, the city stepped in and\ndemolished the building, so\n\n408\n00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:10,620\nhe basically lost\neverything he put into it.\n\n409\n00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,850\nThat's the kind of thing that happens.\n\n410\n00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,680\nNow, that's a worst case scenario.\n\n411\n00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,470\nBut it is possible,\nespecially with contractors, that\n\n412\n00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,350\nyou may not be getting the performance\nother than that they're reporting.\n\n413\n00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,631\nAnd what you don't want is for them to be\npushing off work and then all of a sudden\n\n414\n00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,915\nslam you with a bunch of overtime at the\nend while they're trying to correct and\n\n415\n00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:28,883\nget back on schedule.\n\n416\n00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:30,875\nYou need to catch that ahead of time,\n\n417\n00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,680\nwhich is why this falls under quality\nassurance not quality control.\n\n418\n00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,855\n>> And so a lot of times what ends up\nhappening is when you start seeing\n\n419\n00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:42,074\nquality deteriorate, and then that's what\ncatches your attention, by that point,\n\n420\n00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,280\nit's too late.\n\n421\n00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,360\nThey've already produced 10,000\nthings instead of 100 things.\n\n422\n00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,600\nSo the idea of here of actually\nmaking sure that we've gone and\n\n423\n00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,470\ndo the quality audits gives us the ability\nto go, here's the good stuff that's going\n\n424\n00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,480\non, but here's what we need\nto do to improve on that or\n\n425\n00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,118\ncontinue to maintain\nthe quality that we need.\n\n426\n00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:04,231\nWe need to do that regularly,\nbecause once again, if you go, okay,\n\n427\n00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:08,316\nI don't have to worry about you again, and\nthen 10,000 more things get produced and\n\n428\n00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:11,779\nwe're now not satisfied with the quality,\nwe've let it go on for too long.\n\n429\n00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,533\nSo for us as a project manager,\ndoing these quality audits are very much\n\n430\n00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:18,359\nan important part of whatever\nprocess we go through.\n\n431\n00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,123\nOr we're gonna find ourselves where cost\noverruns now, and then time behind cuz we\n\n432\n00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:25,260\nhave to go back and reproduce\neverything that we thought now was bad.\n\n433\n00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,040\n>> Now, the tools that we actually use for\nthis, it's up to us and we came up with\n\n434\n00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,970\nthem back in the planning phase, but\njust to recap, if it's been a while since\n\n435\n00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,750\nyou watched that episode, let me bring up,\nthese are Ronnie's notes here.\n\n436\n00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,920\nSo these are all some of the different\ntools we talked about in previous episodes\n\n437\n00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,450\nthat we used here.\n\n438\n00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,409\nSo affinity diagrams,\nthose were where we try and\n\n439\n00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,613\nlook at problems and tie them to a cause,\n\n440\n00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:54,475\nwhich is the cause of most failures of\nquality and how we can correct that.\n\n441\n00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:59,018\nProcess decision program charts,\nthat's what you were talking about Ronnie,\n\n442\n00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:02,424\nbasically like a flow chart to\nunderstand what's going on,\n\n443\n00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:05,585\nour inner relationship digraphs,\nour tree diagrams.\n\n444\n00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:09,788\nall of these are just different ways of\nmapping together problems and causes and\n\n445\n00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:11,807\ntrying to prevent them ahead of time.\n\n446\n00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:16,000\nSo, these are all tackled under planning,\nnow we're just using them.\n\n447\n00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,860\nSo in planning, we talked about like what\nthose charts were and how they worked,\n\n448\n00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,430\nnow we're actually getting the data back.\n\n449\n00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,970\nNow we're starting to get that information\nbecause we start manufacturing those blue\n\n450\n00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,290\njeans, and now we're churning out\nthousands of blue jeans per day, we might\n\n451\n00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:32,370\nstart to identify fault numbers that are\ndifferent than what we originally planned.\n\n452\n00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,130\nThere might be sources of those\nfaults that are different.\n\n453\n00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,169\nWe might've planned for\nthe button machine not working right, or\n\n454\n00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:41,858\nthe stitching machine not working right,\nand then at the end of the day, it turns\n\n455\n00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:45,765\nout it's the washing machine, where we\nactually launder them before selling them,\n\n456\n00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:48,403\nis causing some problems and\nwe just didn't foresee it.\n\n457\n00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:51,853\nAnd so we identify that through\nan innerrelationship digraph, or\n\n458\n00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:55,054\nhowever it is we choose to find that,\nwe populate that data and\n\n459\n00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:57,290\nnow we start to take actions.\n\n460\n00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,582\nSo this is one of those processes that\nwhen we get through it, oftentimes we go\n\n461\n00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:06,890\nright back to it, we're cycling through\nthis for the entire execution phase.\n\n462\n00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,830\nSo when we do this analysis, we then have\nto figure out what to do about it, and\n\n463\n00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,040\nwhat to do about it is oftentimes\ngonna be a change request.\n\n464\n00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,560\nSo we change the way that we do\nsomething to correct for it, and\n\n465\n00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,540\nthen we go right back in as an input and\nwe run through the same process again.\n\n466\n00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,390\nSo change requests are the number one\nthing that's gonna come out of this, but\n\n467\n00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,250\nthere's other things.\n\n468\n00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,512\nOur plan updates,\n\n469\n00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:32,668\nour other project document updates as we\ngather all this information together.\n\n470\n00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:36,150\nI mentioned all those tools that came up\nin the planning phase, they're a part of\n\n471\n00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,240\nour quality management plan,\nnow we're filling them with that data.\n\n472\n00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,005\nAnd that'll be important because\nwhether your project is successful or\n\n473\n00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:44,867\nwhether it fails doesn't matter.\n\n474\n00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:49,491\nI guess it does matter but\nat the end of the project, either outcome,\n\n475\n00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:52,145\nyou're going to do a lessons learned.\n\n476\n00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:53,988\nAnd if your project succeeded,\n\n477\n00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:58,491\nit might be because things went a lot\nbetter than you planned, or if it failed,\n\n478\n00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:01,993\nit might be that things went\na lot worse than how you planned.\n\n479\n00:23:01,993 --> 00:23:06,735\nAnd it's generally the data we get from\nperforming quality assurance that tells us\n\n480\n00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:09,983\nwhich it was, and we can see,\nlike man, our fault rate,\n\n481\n00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:13,184\nour defect rate was way lower\nthan what we anticipated.\n\n482\n00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,438\nAnd so as a result,\nwe were able to produce higher yields and\n\n483\n00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:18,190\nwe were able to finish early,\nand finish under budget.\n\n484\n00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,005\nOr you might find that, man, there were\nsome defects that we just didn't plan for,\n\n485\n00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:25,820\nwe didn't know about, and they caught us\nby surprise and they gave us lower yields,\n\n486\n00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,318\nit took us longer to get done and\nwe came in over budget.\n\n487\n00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:30,803\nBut here's why, we didn't see this.\n\n488\n00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:34,667\nWell, if you spot it during\nthe execution phase,\n\n489\n00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:38,899\nyou can do change requests\nto correct your schedule and\n\n490\n00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:42,579\nyour budget to reflect these new outcomes,\nand\n\n491\n00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:47,189\nthat way you don't come in over budget or\nbehind schedule.\n\n492\n00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:51,747\nAnd remember, when you come in under\nbudget and ahead of schedule, that sounds\n\n493\n00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:56,255\nlike a great thing, but what it actually\nis, is a reflection of bad planning.\n\n494\n00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:58,345\nIt means that in your planning early on,\n\n495\n00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:00,992\nthere was something you\ndidn't take account for.\n\n496\n00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:04,910\nRight?\nEither the amount of work people could do.\n\n497\n00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,850\nThe price you could get things for.\n\n498\n00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,410\nThere was work you thought you\nhad to do that you didn't.\n\n499\n00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,770\nYou know, that's what it means\nwhen you come in, under budget and\n\n500\n00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,550\nahead of schedule.\n\n501\n00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,630\nA lot of people look like that,\nlook at that as a great thing.\n\n502\n00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,690\nBut, it's almost always\na reflection of bad planning.\n\n503\n00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,740\nAnd, I shouldn't say it take way.\n\n504\n00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,150\nIt's just bad planning.\n\n505\n00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,420\nIt's just incomplete planning, right,\nwe didn't see all the possible outcomes.\n\n506\n00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,240\n>> And this is where that\nconstraint triangle comes back in.\n\n507\n00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,100\nWe've always talked about that idea.\n\n508\n00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,540\nThat if we overemphasize one over\nthe other, we sacrifice the other two.\n\n509\n00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,740\nSo we emphasize the idea of\ntrying to come in under time, but\n\n510\n00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,660\nwe might sacrifice something in\nour scope or in the overall time.\n\n511\n00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,750\nI was trying to make sure I said it right.\n\n512\n00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,780\nTo make sure, right?\n\n513\n00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,510\nSo if I only emphasize that, I might\nactually say I did come in under time,\n\n514\n00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,760\nbut why?\n\n515\n00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,300\nAnd so you always wanna make\nsure that you keep that in hand.\n\n516\n00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,010\nAnd quality assurance is probably one of\nthe best ways that we keep right on top of\n\n517\n00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,370\nthe project,is by making sure we're active\nin that part of the process as well.\n\n518\n00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,810\n>> All right Ronnie well that is\nprobably a pretty good spot to stop and\n\n519\n00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,322\ntake a break.\n\n520\n00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:09,195\n>> Sounds good.\n>> So we've talked about directing and\n\n521\n00:25:09,195 --> 00:25:10,061\nmanaging project work.\n\n522\n00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:12,610\nWe've talked about perform\nquality assurance.\n\n523\n00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,810\nNow we need to continue on,\n\n524\n00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,210\nwe're gonna talk about some other\nthings that we need to deal with.\n\n525\n00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,460\nWhich all fall under human resources\n>> Right\n\n526\n00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,260\n>> You'll see we've got\n\n527\n00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,420\nacquire project team, develop project\nteam, and manage project team.\n\n528\n00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,530\n>> Right.\n>> So team building,\n\n529\n00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,090\nfor the rest of the episode.\n\n530\n00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:27,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're a team!\n\n531\n00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,700\nThere's no I in team, so\ndefinitely stay tuned for that.\n\n532\n00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,830\nThese are some process groups\nthat get overlooked a lot and\n\n533\n00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,370\nI think they are important,\nespecially since they're on the exam.\n\n534\n00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,656\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n535\n00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:48,016\n[MUSIC]\n\n536\n00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,550\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n537\n00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,790\nOkay so what we're gonna do now,\n\n538\n00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:58,410\nis we're gonna take a look at the human\nresources knowledge area of our project.\n\n539\n00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,320\nAnd this is kind of\na funny one because it's,\n\n540\n00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,630\nwe're still in the executing\nprocess group.\n\n541\n00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,180\nBut if you look at some of the processes\nwe need this to act on next is things like\n\n542\n00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,990\nacquire a project team, develop\na project team, manage a project team.\n\n543\n00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,610\nIt's all centered around the project team.\n\n544\n00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:16,200\nNow, before we dive too deep into that,\nlet's remember what the project team is.\n\n545\n00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,980\nRight?\nWho is on your team?\n\n546\n00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,980\nThis does not mean every person\nwho's doing work for your project.\n\n547\n00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,470\nRight?\nNot all of your work package owners.\n\n548\n00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,930\nA work package owner, that's a person\nwho's either responsible for or\n\n549\n00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,010\nactually performing the work, as defined\nin our work breakdown structure.\n\n550\n00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,440\nBut the project team,\nthese are gonna be people like yourself.\n\n551\n00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,440\nThe project manager and any accountants,\nproject management assistants,\n\n552\n00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,320\nsub project managers,\nany kind of record keepers and\n\n553\n00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,960\nother people who are actually associated\nwith running the project itself.\n\n554\n00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,900\nAlright, you guys have\nto work together and\n\n555\n00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,020\nthere's various steps we have to\ngo through to make that happen.\n\n556\n00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,170\nNow, its kind of funny because\nthis one falls under executing.\n\n557\n00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:02,340\nBut, a lot of your project management\nteam members are involved in the earlier\n\n558\n00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,260\nphases of the project.\n\n559\n00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260\nSo if I jump back to this.\n\n560\n00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,549\nHow we gonna do our plan if we\ndon't have our team members?\n\n561\n00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,420\nThere's some team members you\nneed while your in planning, and\n\n562\n00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,370\nthere's some you don't.\n\n563\n00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,650\nI might know that I really\nneed an accountant.\n\n564\n00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,860\nI need a CPA.\n\n565\n00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,560\nI need somebody who can\nkeep track of my books.\n\n566\n00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,670\nand make sure that I'm reporting on\nthe up and up, and I'm following GAP, and\n\n567\n00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,960\nall that other stuff.\n\n568\n00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,220\nYou know what, I need that accountant.\n\n569\n00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,100\nBut I'm not spending any money yet so\nI don't need that accountant today.\n\n570\n00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,840\nI don't actually need the accountant\nuntil we start spending money,\n\n571\n00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,070\nand we don't actually start spending\nmoney until execution starts.\n\n572\n00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,900\nSo that accountant is going to be\non my project management team, but\n\n573\n00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,530\nI don't need them just yet.\n\n574\n00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,430\nSo in the planning phase we're normally\ndealing with the skeleton crew.\n\n575\n00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,190\nJust the bare minimum people we need\nto actually plan for this project, and\n\n576\n00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,890\nget work done.\n\n577\n00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,070\nOnce we switch into executing, we'll need\nall of our additional support staff.\n\n578\n00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,320\nIf this is a massive project.\n\n579\n00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,500\nIf you're building a shopping mall.\n\n580\n00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,950\nA shopping mall is huge.\n\n581\n00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,870\nAnd you as a project manager cannot go and\n\n582\n00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,000\ninspect, and audit all the different\nconstruction going on at once.\n\n583\n00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,460\nBecause there's just too much.\n\n584\n00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,020\nSo you might have assistants.\n\n585\n00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,120\nSeveral other people that are going\nout and doing those inspections.\n\n586\n00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,460\nAgain, you dont' need them in planning,\nright?\n\n587\n00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,530\nOne person can handle\nthe planning just fine.\n\n588\n00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,030\nBut then we need extra assistance\nwhen we actually get into executing.\n\n589\n00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,770\nSo, we plan for\nthat in our planning phase.\n\n590\n00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,570\nWe figured out who all\nwe needed on that team.\n\n591\n00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,490\nNow we need to get them.\n\n592\n00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,100\nOkay.\n\n593\n00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,260\nSo, we're bringing in\nthe people to fill that gap.\n\n594\n00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,250\nAnd that's what this phase is all about.\n\n595\n00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,270\nSo, you'll notice that 9.2\nis Acquire Project Team.\n\n596\n00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,210\nSo let's look at that one.\n\n597\n00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,210\nIf we go to Acquire Project Team.\n\n598\n00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,140\nBasically, we go back to our plan.\n\n599\n00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,560\nOur human resources management\nplan right here, and\n\n600\n00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,590\nour way our company does business, right?\n\n601\n00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,960\nEnterprise environmental factors and\norganizational process assets.\n\n602\n00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,885\nWe take that information that we got and\nnow we go and we get our team.\n\n603\n00:28:58,885 --> 00:28:59,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n604\n00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,900\n>> All right, now how we get our team is\ngoing to vary from company to company.\n\n605\n00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,740\nSo you'll see there's a number\nof different ways to do it.\n\n606\n00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,400\nOne way is pre-assignment.\n\n607\n00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,300\nFor somebody like the project manager, the\nproject managers have been pre-assigned.\n\n608\n00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,190\nBack in the planning phase, really back\nin initiation, when initiation was done,\n\n609\n00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,810\nwhen your company said, yes,\nwe're going to roll forward with that.\n\n610\n00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,550\nThey probably pre-assigned\na project manager.\n\n611\n00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,310\nSo you've been assigned to work it,\nyou're already on the team.\n\n612\n00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,720\nThat's not always true.\n\n613\n00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,220\nYou might have a very large\norganization that says, you know what,\n\n614\n00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,490\nwe want to go forward with this project.\n\n615\n00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,180\nLet's initiate it.\n\n616\n00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,340\nLet's kick it off.\n\n617\n00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,285\nAnd it's a key stakeholder, right?\n\n618\n00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:35,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or a sponsor that's really pushing it\n\n619\n00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,900\nforward at that point.\n\n620\n00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,280\nAnd a project manager\nhasn't been assigned yet.\n\n621\n00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,670\nAnd it might be that planning\nis all ready completed,\n\n622\n00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,370\nand now we bring in the project manager.\n\n623\n00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,100\nYou see that with construction\nfairly frequently.\n\n624\n00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,540\nWhere the house has all\nready been designed.\n\n625\n00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,110\nIf they've all ready\nbuilt it 50 times before,\n\n626\n00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,610\nthey know how long it's gonna take,\nhow much it's gonna cost.\n\n627\n00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,960\nAll the planning is already done.\n\n628\n00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,850\nWe don't need a project\nmanager in the planning phase,\n\n629\n00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,380\nbecause all that work is all\nready done to build this house.\n\n630\n00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:00,989\nIt's cookie cutter.\n\n631\n00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,550\nBut somebody does need to run the\noperation to make sure the house is built.\n\n632\n00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,985\nSo, by the time we move to\nexecuting we bring in the PM, then.\n\n633\n00:30:08,985 --> 00:30:09,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n634\n00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,230\n>> After planning.\n\n635\n00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,910\nSo planning the project manager's\nnot involved in at all.\n\n636\n00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,500\nNow they just have to follow the plan.\n\n637\n00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,750\nOther reasons we might do preassignment:\nyou might have somebody who is an expert.\n\n638\n00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,370\nYour company might be deploying\nsome software where you have\n\n639\n00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:28,150\none employee who is the expert, and\nnobody else is that knowledgeable.\n\n640\n00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,340\nSo it's a given that you're going to need\nthat person to complete this project.\n\n641\n00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,450\nOr, you might not have\nanybody who can do that job.\n\n642\n00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,340\nIn which case you're going\nto have to contract out, or\n\n643\n00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,680\nyou're going to have to train somebody.\n\n644\n00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,570\nSo again, pre-selection may be important.\n\n645\n00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,450\nAnother one is negotiation, and\nthis is one that I've fallen into a lot.\n\n646\n00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,820\nWhich is, you might be kicking off a\nproject, and you go to acquire your team,\n\n647\n00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,210\nso you go to your PMO.\n\n648\n00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,350\nAnd the PMO says, oh you need a web\ndeveloper, here I'll give you Steve.\n\n649\n00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,840\nAnd you look at it and you're like.\n\n650\n00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,920\nOh, Steve.\nI've never heard of Steve before.\n\n651\n00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,280\nSo you start asking those questions.\n\n652\n00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,200\nHey, how long's Steve\nbeen with the company.\n\n653\n00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,110\nOh, two months.\n\n654\n00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,750\nThat's great.\n\n655\n00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,290\nOh, he just graduated from college.\n\n656\n00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,070\nWonderful.\n\n657\n00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,010\nAnd in the back of your\nmind you're thinking.\n\n658\n00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,460\nMan, there's Amy down in the web\ndevelopment department, and\n\n659\n00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,540\nI've worked with her.\n\n660\n00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,440\nShe is a pro,\nshe's been doing it ten years.\n\n661\n00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,300\nShe's awesome.\n\n662\n00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,780\nI really wish I could have gotten her,\nbut I got Steve.\n\n663\n00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,470\nRight.\n\n664\n00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,420\nSo you go back to the PMO and\nyou say, boy,\n\n665\n00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,865\nis there Is there any way that I could\nget Amy on my project instead of Steve?\n\n666\n00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:31,035\nAnd they say well Amy's already\nworking on this other project.\n\n667\n00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:32,685\nAnd now you're start negotiating.\n\n668\n00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:35,665\nNow you start saying, well all right,\nwhat if I trade you this person for\n\n669\n00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:36,165\nthat person?\n\n670\n00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:38,255\nWhat if I move some stuff\naround on my schedule?\n\n671\n00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:42,225\nAnd you try and work it to build\nit around that person on the team.\n\n672\n00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:45,050\nThat, it may sound crazy, right, like\nwhy would you go through that much work?\n\n673\n00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,880\nBut I'll tell you, in real life,\nhaving the right person for\n\n674\n00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,070\nthe job is oftentimes the difference\nbetween success and failure.\n\n675\n00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,100\nAnd the relationships you build\nwhen you work on projects.\n\n676\n00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,046\nYou'll want those same team members over,\nand over again if you've had successes.\n\n677\n00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:02,029\nBecause you've already have that\nI'm gonna use the work Mike.\n\n678\n00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:02,725\nSynergy.\n\n679\n00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:04,525\n>> You've already got that synergy right.\n\n680\n00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:07,466\nWhich means absolutely nothing but\nyou've already got that connection,\n\n681\n00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:08,970\nthat relationship with that person.\n\n682\n00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,280\nIt works out better.\n\n683\n00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,700\nIt makes things easier.\n\n684\n00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,730\nSo we want that.\n\n685\n00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,140\nNot that we can't get by without it.\n\n686\n00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,710\nIf we have to deal with all new\nteam members, we can get by, or\n\n687\n00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,450\na good project manager can.\n\n688\n00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,370\nBut, it's so\nmuch safer to have somebody you know.\n\n689\n00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,050\nSo negotiation is a not an uncommon thing.\n\n690\n00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,210\n>> Yeah it almost sounds like\nfantasy football [laugh]\n\n691\n00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,470\n>> It's exactly like fantasy football\n\n692\n00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:35,510\nexcept I got two web developers and\nI got to change my lineup tonight.\n\n693\n00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:38,890\nALright, somebody probably\nmakes a video game out of that.\n\n694\n00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,240\nOk, acquisitions.\n\n695\n00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,680\nAcquisitions actually\ngetting these people.\n\n696\n00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,410\nNow as a project manager\nyou might not have hire and\n\n697\n00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,510\nfire responsibilities inside your company,\noften times you don't.\n\n698\n00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,150\nYou may not even have direct\nauthority over these people.\n\n699\n00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,190\nThey probably already have a functional\nmanager that they work for, and\n\n700\n00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,630\nyou're coming in as a project manager.\n\n701\n00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,550\nSo split differences, right?\n\n702\n00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,100\nYou've actually got to\nacquire that employee.\n\n703\n00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,000\nEither going to their functional\nmanager to have them assigned, or\n\n704\n00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,260\ngoing to human resources, or your PMO.\n\n705\n00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,390\nWhoever it is that actually assigns them.\n\n706\n00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,230\nThis is where we go back to our\nenterprise environmental factors and\n\n707\n00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,090\norganization process assets, right?\n\n708\n00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,920\nWe go through whatever mechanisms our\ncompany has to get them assigned to\n\n709\n00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,910\nthe project, and\nthen we do our onboarding.\n\n710\n00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,510\nOnboarding is where you bring\nthe person up to speed.\n\n711\n00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,250\nThis might be the very first time\nthey've heard of this project.\n\n712\n00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,180\nThey may not have even known this\nexisted prior to you talking to them.\n\n713\n00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,130\nYou say, all right.\n\n714\n00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:30,960\nHere's the project.\n\n715\n00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,040\nHere's what we're going to do.\n\n716\n00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,000\nHere's how much time we need.\n\n717\n00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500\nHere's what we need from you.\n\n718\n00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,560\nYou've got to bring all of that\ninformation to the table, so\n\n719\n00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,260\nthey understand it.\n\n720\n00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,650\nNow a new one that we see that is,\nit's kind of a hot button with PMI.\n\n721\n00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,220\nSo it's definitely something\nyou're going to see on the exam.\n\n722\n00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,130\nIs what's called a virtual team.\n\n723\n00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:55,070\nMore and more commonly today, we don't\nhave our team all in one location.\n\n724\n00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,080\nOftentimes we'll have employees\nthat are spread across the country,\n\n725\n00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,310\nacross the globe.\n\n726\n00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,340\nYou have different time zones,\ndifferent countries involved,\n\n727\n00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,800\nall sorts of complexities there.\n\n728\n00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,760\nThat's called the virtual team.\n\n729\n00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,640\nAnd virtual teams are fine.\n\n730\n00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,980\nThey do require a different\nmanagement style though,\n\n731\n00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,640\nbecause there's a lot of unknowns.\n\n732\n00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,220\nRonnie, you and I,\nwe work in the same office.\n\n733\n00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,360\nWhen I walk into\nthe office in the morning,\n\n734\n00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,400\nI know I saw Ronnie's car outside,\nso I know he's here..\n\n735\n00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,930\nAnd his cube, we have cubes here,\nwe're a cube type place.\n\n736\n00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,435\n>> Yeah.\n\n737\n00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:27,570\n[LAUGH]\n>> And Ronnie's cube is positioned\n\n738\n00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,555\nin the deepest,\ndarkest corner of the office.\n\n739\n00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:31,112\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm actually kinda pointing it out.\n\n740\n00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,900\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> And\nI can't see over there, so\n\n741\n00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,420\nI don't really know if Ronnie's there.\n\n742\n00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,980\nBut I just saw his car when I pulled in so\nI know he's here, I know he's here and\n\n743\n00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,990\nhe's working.\n\n744\n00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,780\nRight now, well, you are standing there.\n\n745\n00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,964\nSo I know you're working.\n\n746\n00:34:41,964 --> 00:34:46,090\nBut if this were a virtual team,\nif you were at home, you know,\n\n747\n00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,270\nworking from a home office, or\nsomething like that, I wouldn't know.\n\n748\n00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,240\nThere is a certain level\nof trust you have to have.\n\n749\n00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,350\nI trust that he's at home working.\n\n750\n00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,900\nMaybe he isn't.\n\n751\n00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,340\nSo, virtual teams create complexities\nthere that we have to plan around.\n\n752\n00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,970\nSome people like it, some people don't.\n\n753\n00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,910\nI'm not a big fan of it.\n\n754\n00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,640\nAnd I've done it.\n\n755\n00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,400\nI've done it where,\nactually I lived in Seattle for a while.\n\n756\n00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,850\nAnd I moved back to Gainesville,\nFlorida and\n\n757\n00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,490\nI was still working for\na Seattle company for six more months.\n\n758\n00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,560\nBecause I was wrapping up some\nprojects I was working on.\n\n759\n00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,150\nSo I was doing project management\nfrom Gainesville Florida,\n\n760\n00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,200\nmanaging entire teams\nthat were in Seattle.\n\n761\n00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,410\nI was doing a disaster recovery rollout,\n\n762\n00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,750\nto a disaster recovery center\nthat I had never even been to.\n\n763\n00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,020\nAnd that kind of stuff,\nthat's what happens with virtual teams,\n\n764\n00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,210\nand it does work.\n\n765\n00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,420\nNow you hear a lot of times\nwhere employers don't like it,\n\n766\n00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,540\nand employees love it.\n\n767\n00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,460\nEmployees over there,\nyeah I wanna work from home.\n\n768\n00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,240\nWell I can say as an employee,\nI did not like it.\n\n769\n00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,210\nMy home is not conducive\nto getting work done.\n\n770\n00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,840\nSo, you know, kids making noise.\n\n771\n00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,850\nThe damned cat jumping on the keyboard,\nstuff like that.\n\n772\n00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,330\nDogs barking, it's craziness.\n\n773\n00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,110\nNow it sounds like my house is a zoo.\n\n774\n00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,350\nIt's not that bad, but\nit's not as good as when I get to work.\n\n775\n00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,690\nAnd I've got my monitors,\nI've got my little cube and my phone and\n\n776\n00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,700\nI'm able to focus in and get stuff done.\n\n777\n00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,830\nI get more done at work.\n\n778\n00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,360\nI'd rather be at the office than at home.\n\n779\n00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,610\nDifferent people benefit\ndifferent ways from that.\n\n780\n00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,040\nSo just be aware, virtual teams.\n\n781\n00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,570\n>> Yeah.\n\n782\n00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,470\n>> They're a realistic option.\n\n783\n00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,820\nMore people are using it.\n\n784\n00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,490\nThere's also high\nvisibility stuff like HP.\n\n785\n00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,470\nHP, Hewlett Packard.\n\n786\n00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n787\n00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080\n>> They were pushing really big for\nthis for years, and\n\n788\n00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,880\nthen last year they announced they were\ncancelling all work from home stuff.\n\n789\n00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,260\nSo employees could either come back to\nthe office or they can get another job.\n\n790\n00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,818\nYeah, they cancelled all that.\n\n791\n00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:32,468\nAnd then,\n\n792\n00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:37,976\nthe last tool that we have here is what's\ncalled multi-criteria decision analysis.\n\n793\n00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:40,420\nIf you have employees that\nyou want to work with.\n\n794\n00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,600\nYou know who you are, you pick them and\nyou're done, you know,\n\n795\n00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,100\nyou don't worry about this.\n\n796\n00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,620\nBut if you're dealing with\nan entirely new set of employees,\n\n797\n00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,760\npeople that you've never met before.\n\n798\n00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,040\nHow are you going to pick who's right for\nyour project?\n\n799\n00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,770\nAnd one of the ways to do that is\nmulti-criteria decision analysis.\n\n800\n00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,840\nAnd Ronnie,\nI think you did this in your notes.\n\n801\n00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,550\nWhere'd I put your notes?\n\n802\n00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,110\nLet me find it here.\n\n803\n00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,250\nThere are a lot of\ncriteria we can look at.\n\n804\n00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:01,750\nHere we go.\n\n805\n00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,620\nSo, what are some of the things we need\nto consider when we pick a person?\n\n806\n00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,310\nAvailability is probably\nthe most important one.\n\n807\n00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,020\nBecause if they're not available,\nyou can't use them, and\n\n808\n00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,610\nyou don't care about the rest of it,\nright?\n\n809\n00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,000\nSo, we need to make sure\nthat they're available.\n\n810\n00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,780\nAfter that though is where we really\nstart to break into other things.\n\n811\n00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,110\nCost, right?\n\n812\n00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,640\nYou may have some people who\nare cheaper to work with than others.\n\n813\n00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,750\nThis might be hourly wages, or salary.\n\n814\n00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,570\nThese might be contractors,\nand different contract types.\n\n815\n00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,740\nSo some of them will be\nless of a financial burden.\n\n816\n00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,640\nNow normally the less you pay,\nthe lower quality work you get, but\n\n817\n00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,080\nthat's not always true.\n\n818\n00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,900\nSo it is a factor we\nneed to pay attention to.\n\n819\n00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,440\nExperience is one that\nI always care about.\n\n820\n00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,720\nIf you have somebody who\nhas experience doing a job.\n\n821\n00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,635\nThey're gonna give you good estimates and\nthey're gonna get the work done.\n\n822\n00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,100\nBecause they know what needs to be done.\n\n823\n00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,240\nIf you've got somebody who's\ninexperienced, who's new,\n\n824\n00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,150\nthat kid right out of college.\n\n825\n00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,890\nIt's not that they don't\nknow what they're doing,\n\n826\n00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,440\nit's just they've never done it before.\n\n827\n00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,700\nSo they can't give very\naccurate estimates, and\n\n828\n00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,300\nthe odds of mistakes happening are higher.\n\n829\n00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,849\nSo somebody's experience we\ndefinitely wanna measure.\n\n830\n00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,270\nAll right ability is next.\n\n831\n00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,750\nSome people have it some people don't.\n\n832\n00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,600\nThis is not something we can really learn.\n\n833\n00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,410\nI actually have this.\n\n834\n00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,310\nYou know,\nI'm gonna show it here on the show.\n\n835\n00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,620\nI have this picture on my wall.\n\n836\n00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,355\n>> Big motivator?\n\n837\n00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:17,560\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes.\n\n838\n00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,870\nCalled incompetence.\n\n839\n00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:23,425\nAnd I've had this hanging in my office for\nyears.\n\n840\n00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:27,700\n[LAUGH] And I just have a cube now,\nso I don't have it hanging, but\n\n841\n00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,240\nin my project management days I did.\n\n842\n00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,930\nI love this picture; it\nis somewhat negative.\n\n843\n00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:36,490\nBut basically it says, when you\nearnestly think you can compensate for\n\n844\n00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,632\na lack of skill by doubling your efforts,\nthere's no end to what you can't do.\n\n845\n00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:42,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And And that happens.\n\n846\n00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,360\nIf somebody doesn't have the ability\nto do a job, it doesn't matter if\n\n847\n00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,360\nthey're a hard worker,\nif they're cheap, if they're smart.\n\n848\n00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,130\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n849\n00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,390\nThey don't have the ability.\n\n850\n00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,270\nThey can't do it.\n\n851\n00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,490\nAnd so there's just not going\nto be a way to leverage them.\n\n852\n00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,000\nBut even if they do have the ability,\n\n853\n00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,990\nthere's obviously different\nlevels of ability.\n\n854\n00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,370\nSo you will have some people,\n\n855\n00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,980\nwhen it comes to web design--\nlet's use IT Pro TV as an example.\n\n856\n00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,370\nWe have Rob.\n\n857\n00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,620\nRob is our web design,\nand web developer guru.\n\n858\n00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,710\nHe really knows his stuff.\n\n859\n00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,610\nAnd if there's a problem\nwith the IT PRO TV website,\n\n860\n00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,910\nif somebody gives him that problem he\ncan have it fixed usually in minutes.\n\n861\n00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,110\nHe's a sharp guy.\n\n862\n00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,400\nI happen to know a good\nbit of that stuff too.\n\n863\n00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,890\nBecause I took a lot\nof courses in college.\n\n864\n00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,330\nAnd so I can do some basic PHP.\n\n865\n00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,380\nAnd some web development.\n\n866\n00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,350\nBut, for\n\n867\n00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:35,760\nme to do the same thing that Rob does, I\neasily take four times the amount of time.\n\n868\n00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,210\nSo if it's a one hour activity, it might\ntake me four hours to get it done.\n\n869\n00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,710\nI can get it done, I have the ability.\n\n870\n00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,080\nBut I don't have the same\nlevel of ability as Rob.\n\n871\n00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,700\nSo getting the right person for\nthe job is important.\n\n872\n00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,480\nThat's ability.\n\n873\n00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n874\n00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,020\nAnd that right person for the job not\nonly comes down to whatever you're doing.\n\n875\n00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,033\nBut, it may be one of the persons\nexcellent at what they do,\n\n876\n00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:56,989\nbut they can't really work\nin that project environment,\n\n877\n00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:59,668\nin terms of a A time constraint\nthat they might have.\n\n878\n00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:03,510\nAnd when you have that word you go,\nman, this guy is great.\n\n879\n00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,630\nHe can do everything we need him to do.\n\n880\n00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,230\nHe just can't do it in the time\nthat we need him to do it.\n\n881\n00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:13,360\nYou gotta be realistic about that as well,\nbecause that can clearly drive you nuts\n\n882\n00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,910\njust as much because you\nknow he has the ability.\n\n883\n00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,140\nYou just know he can't\nmanage his time very well,\n\n884\n00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,200\nand that's just something that would,\nyeah.\n\n885\n00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,920\nThat just goes overboard.\n\n886\n00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,910\n>> Now they have the next\nentry is knowledge.\n\n887\n00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,430\nNow that might sound like it's duplicating\nability, but there is a difference.\n\n888\n00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,230\nAbility is not normally something\nthat we can gain, but knowledge is.\n\n889\n00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,640\nI might not know how to do whatever this\nactivity is that's being assigned to me.\n\n890\n00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,570\nBut I can learn it.\n\n891\n00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,270\nMaybe you'll have to send\nme to some training, right.\n\n892\n00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,340\nSo, maybe we'll take Rob.\n\n893\n00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,400\nSo Rob, he knows PHP.\n\n894\n00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,400\nBut maybe I need some stuff done\nin Python, or some other language.\n\n895\n00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,830\nWell he doesn't know that language.\n\n896\n00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,600\nBut you know what, he knows development.\n\n897\n00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,980\nHe knows a programming language.\n\n898\n00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,870\nSo all he needs to do is run\nthrough a quick course or\n\n899\n00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,750\nwhatever to learn the other language and\nthen he can get into it, right.\n\n900\n00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,100\nHe's got that base knowledge.\n\n901\n00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,300\nThat is an important thing.\n\n902\n00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,350\nSome people, if we bring them onto our\nproject team, we might need to train them.\n\n903\n00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:10,410\nIf they've never worked in a PMI\nproject management environment before,\n\n904\n00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,358\nwe might need to train them.\n\n905\n00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:17,240\nSend them through, not PMP but\nlike Cap M,or something like that.\n\n906\n00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,910\nSo they get some basic\nproject management training.\n\n907\n00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,730\nThat's something that we can\nalways add on to people.\n\n908\n00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,400\nSkills.\nThey might have skills beyond\n\n909\n00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,030\nwhat you need, and that means they can be\nhelpful in other areas of the project.\n\n910\n00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,360\nSo you might be able to use them for\n\n911\n00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,880\nmore then one role if they've\ngot the skills to do it.\n\n912\n00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,220\nAnd then attitude.\n\n913\n00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,410\nAttitude, it's important.\n\n914\n00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,690\nIf somebody is not a good fit for\nyour team, if they don't mesh,\n\n915\n00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:46,408\nif they don't have that synergy, then\nthey can actually bring the project down.\n\n916\n00:41:46,408 --> 00:41:50,780\nAnd so making sure you've got people\nwith the right attitude for the project.\n\n917\n00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,260\nAnd then international factors.\n\n918\n00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,710\nThis is starting to become a big one.\n\n919\n00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,720\nI used to laugh about this one\nbecause we didn't really care.\n\n920\n00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,300\nNowadays, here in the U.S.\n\n921\n00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,120\nwe've got a limit on the amount\nof H-1B visas that can be issued.\n\n922\n00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,980\nIf you're using employees that\nare located outside of the United States,\n\n923\n00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,060\nyou have limits to how you can use them,\nhow much time you can use them and so on.\n\n924\n00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,950\nOther countries have\ntheir own requirements.\n\n925\n00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,420\nIf you're operating inside of Europe\nyou have things like the VAT,\n\n926\n00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,060\nthe value added tax, and stuff that starts\nto apply to some of those activities.\n\n927\n00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,930\nSo, all of those are things that\nare things that you've got to be\n\n928\n00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,330\nconcerned about when you're\nmeasuring these people.\n\n929\n00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,060\nSo what you can do is you can\nactually create a matrix.\n\n930\n00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,200\nAnd you can start to create report cards.\n\n931\n00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,970\nRanking the various possible\npeople based on these categories.\n\n932\n00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,830\nYou determine which one's more important,\nwhich one's less important, and\n\n933\n00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,650\nthen you rank to be able to select\nthe best person for the job.\n\n934\n00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,140\nOdds are your PMO is already doing that,\nbut if you don't have a PMO,\n\n935\n00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,710\nthen you have to.\n\n936\n00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n937\n00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,690\n>> Alright now the outputs on this\none are pretty straight forward.\n\n938\n00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,320\nWhen we figure out who our team\nis going to be we get them so,\n\n939\n00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,080\nProject Staff Assignments.\n\n940\n00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,480\nYou get the staff, and\nyou give them their assignment.\n\n941\n00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,570\nYou tell them what role they're going\nto be performing in your project.\n\n942\n00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,050\nSo you get Steve, the web developer,\nand you say all right,\n\n943\n00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,180\nyou're going to be the main web developer.\n\n944\n00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:05,820\nThat means you, inside of my project,\nI've defined you as web developer one.\n\n945\n00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,100\nSo, any activity that I've assigned\nto web developer one, that's yours.\n\n946\n00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:09,660\nRight?\n\n947\n00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,070\nOr you bring in Bob from accounting.\n\n948\n00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,010\nYou say, all right Bob you're\nthe project accountant.\n\n949\n00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:20,680\nSo I need you to read through\nall of our accounting plans.\n\n950\n00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,680\nAll the financial plans that we've done.\n\n951\n00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,030\nAll of our contracts and stuff.\n\n952\n00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,990\nYou're the one managing that.\n\n953\n00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,710\nSo you take a look at that.\n\n954\n00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,520\nOn all of my activities and stuff,\nI've listed you as accountant one.\n\n955\n00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,969\nSo we're going to change that\nto Bob Smith or whoever you are.\n\n956\n00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,200\nResource calendars are another thing\nthat's gonna come out of this.\n\n957\n00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,760\nSo, now that we have Bob, you say all\nright Bob, what's your calendar like?\n\n958\n00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,880\nSay, you know I've got a week schedule for\nvacation in November.\n\n959\n00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,300\nThat week at Thanksgiving,\nwe're travelling, and so I'm gonna be out.\n\n960\n00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,620\nAnd, oh my son's recital is the second\nof week of December, and so\n\n961\n00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,190\nwe've got that too.\n\n962\n00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,650\nSo now we start to get that.\n\n963\n00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,820\nNow when it was just web developer one,\nin my work breakdown structure.\n\n964\n00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,900\nWell, I didn't know who\nthat web developer was,\n\n965\n00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,920\nI didn't know that they might\nbe on vacation or whatever.\n\n966\n00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,550\nBut now that I actually know who\nthe person is, we can find out.\n\n967\n00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,270\nSo we've gotta go and\ndo Project Management Plan Updates.\n\n968\n00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,020\nWe gotta update information,\nload these people's\n\n969\n00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,330\nnames into all of our previous forms\nwe're we had just generic names.\n\n970\n00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,580\nAnd get that straightened out.\n\n971\n00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,510\nAll right, so that is all a part\nof acquiring the project team.\n\n972\n00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,420\nNow we put them to work, right?\n\n973\n00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,330\nWell, we got two more processes\nthat lead into that and if we take\n\n974\n00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:33,870\na look at it you'll see develop the\nproject team, and manage the project team.\n\n975\n00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,610\nThis is actually putting them to work.\n\n976\n00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,980\nDevelop happens first, right?\n\n977\n00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,420\nThis is actually building team cohesion.\n\n978\n00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,910\nGetting them together,\ngetting ready to move forward.\n\n979\n00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,660\nAnd then managing the project team\nis actually setting them to do it.\n\n980\n00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,430\nSo we need to take a look at those before\nour team is officially gelled, right?\n\n981\n00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,685\nBut we probably don't have enough enough\ntime this segment to jump into one of\n\n982\n00:44:53,685 --> 00:44:54,575\nthose, do we Ronny?\n\n983\n00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:55,645\n>> I don't think so.\n\n984\n00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:58,375\n>> So why don't we do this,\nwhy don't we take a break, and\n\n985\n00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:02,065\nwhen we get back we'll continue on\nwith our team building exercise here,\n\n986\n00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:04,055\ninside of the P and P training.\n\n987\n00:45:04,055 --> 00:45:06,775\nSo, stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n988\n00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:14,610\n[MUSIC]\n\n989\n00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,590\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n990\n00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:20,700\nSo in the last segment we took a look\nat acquiring our project teams.\n\n991\n00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,060\nSo now we've got all these employees\nsitting around, what do we do with them?\n\n992\n00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,845\nOr virtually sitting around, I guess.\n\n993\n00:45:26,845 --> 00:45:28,200\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n994\n00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,460\n>> Time for\nus to develop them into a team.\n\n995\n00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,060\nAnd so we're gonna talk about\nsome of the concepts here\n\n996\n00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,560\nin terms of actually making\nthem a cohesive unit.\n\n997\n00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,940\nI like using that term, cohesive.\n\n998\n00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,710\n>> Cohesive.\n\n999\n00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,010\nIt's an adhesive unit.\n\n1000\n00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,510\n>> An adhesive.\n\n1001\n00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,080\n>> All right, so\nwe really don't have much in the way of\n\n1002\n00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,480\ndifferent inputs here than we\ndid when acquiring the team.\n\n1003\n00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,250\nWe've got our human\nresources management plan.\n\n1004\n00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,770\nBecause that's what we define how we're\ngoing to define a lot of this, and\n\n1005\n00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,380\nthen we've got our project\nstaff assignments.\n\n1006\n00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,695\nWhich is what we created in\nthe acquire project teams that we know\n\n1007\n00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:58,025\nWhat each person's responsibility is.\n\n1008\n00:45:58,025 --> 00:45:59,545\nAnd then the resource calendars also, so\n\n1009\n00:45:59,545 --> 00:46:02,065\nwe can find out when somebody's\nnot going to be available.\n\n1010\n00:46:02,065 --> 00:46:06,455\nNow we take that, and these inputs really\ndon't contribute as much as we normally\n\n1011\n00:46:06,455 --> 00:46:08,375\nsee into the tools and techniques.\n\n1012\n00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:11,215\nMost of the tools and\ntechniques with developing a project\n\n1013\n00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:15,175\nteam are kind of designed to work\nby themselves without inputs right?\n\n1014\n00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:18,255\nYou're starting from scratch,\nbuilding a team together.\n\n1015\n00:46:18,255 --> 00:46:19,275\nSo what are some of the things?\n\n1016\n00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:24,040\nWell, number one is one that in\nthe IT industry we see the least of,\n\n1017\n00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,120\nwhich is interpersonal skills.\n\n1018\n00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,860\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah, it's terrible in the IT industry.\n\n1019\n00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,550\nBut if you work in another\nindustry it's probably great.\n\n1020\n00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> But interpersonal skills is simply\n\n1021\n00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,850\nyour ability to communicate and\nrelay information to another person.\n\n1022\n00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,174\nWithout having direct access\nto their mind, right?\n\n1023\n00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:42,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So writing a letter, speaking out loud,\n\n1024\n00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:45,440\ntalking on the telephone,\nthese are ways we communicate.\n\n1025\n00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,860\nAnd poor communication is typically one\nof the keystones of a failed project.\n\n1026\n00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,730\nI mean that is the way things can really\nplummet down if you're not careful.\n\n1027\n00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,940\nSo we wanna make sure that\nwe have good communications,\n\n1028\n00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,270\nand that it's something\nwe're comfortable with.\n\n1029\n00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:03,370\nIf it's not something we're comfortable\nwith, we need to hire somebody who does.\n\n1030\n00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,580\nMany organizations have a PR firm, or\n\n1031\n00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,250\npublic relations people to\nhelp with that communication.\n\n1032\n00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,180\nBut a good project manager is going\nto have good intrapersonal skills.\n\n1033\n00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,950\nYou might need to take a class.\n\n1034\n00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,990\n>> Sometimes because we don't have all the\nskills necessary one of the things that\n\n1035\n00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,430\nthey do call out on,\nespecially in the PEMBOT,\n\n1036\n00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:23,430\nis the idea of the conflict management or\nthe conflict resolution.\n\n1037\n00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,280\nSo again,\n\n1038\n00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,650\nif you don't have those skills, hiring out\nis probably the best way to go about it.\n\n1039\n00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,380\nIf you take a look at that idea.\n\n1040\n00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,870\nSo we might be great at everything\nelse in terms of communicating,\n\n1041\n00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:34,210\nespecially our anger and feelings but\n\n1042\n00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,240\nthe idea of actually making sure we\nresolve all of this is pretty much a key.\n\n1043\n00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,410\n>> So much pent up hostility.\n\n1044\n00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,570\n>> I know. [LAUGH] >> All right,\nnow after that we've got training, and\n\n1045\n00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,060\nI've mentioned this one\nin the last segment.\n\n1046\n00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,580\nIs that when you bring on team\nmembers they might not be trained.\n\n1047\n00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,906\nAnd when I'm talking about training I\n\n1048\n00:47:49,906 --> 00:47:51,530\nreally mean two different\ntypes of training.\n\n1049\n00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,246\nOne, they might not be trained for\nthe job they've just been assigned.\n\n1050\n00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,463\nIn which case,\nwe may need to get them training for that.\n\n1051\n00:47:57,463 --> 00:48:01,400\nYou might have brought somebody on to do\nyour bookkeeping, your accounting, but\n\n1052\n00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,750\nmaybe they just have\na background in computers.\n\n1053\n00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,030\nAnd so, you might need to send them\nthrough an accounting course or\n\n1054\n00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,610\nsomething to get them trained up.\n\n1055\n00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,670\nHopefully not, but it does happen.\n\n1056\n00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:12,720\nThe other thing they might not be\ntrained for is working in a project.\n\n1057\n00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,830\n>> Yeah.\n>> If this is the first time they've\n\n1058\n00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:20,200\nworked in a project, that is a project\ndone according to the PMI framework\n\n1059\n00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,640\n>> Then they may not know about things\n\n1060\n00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,850\nlike the importance of change tickets,\nor how to fill out a change ticket.\n\n1061\n00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,910\nThey may not know about progress\nreports and how to report that.\n\n1062\n00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:31,290\nAll the various plans and\nwhat the plans mean.\n\n1063\n00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:35,990\nWe may need to create an abbreviated\nPMP course just for these people.\n\n1064\n00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:38,830\nThere's a lot of people that do,\nthey have project management fundamentals,\n\n1065\n00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,070\nis what they normally call it.\n\n1066\n00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,510\n>> And you have a one day workshop\nwhere you bring your team together, and\n\n1067\n00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:48,670\nyou walk them through what's\nexpected of them in your project.\n\n1068\n00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,560\nSo they understand\nthe importance of paperwork,\n\n1069\n00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,490\nthat's the hard one to really\nbeat into somebody's head.\n\n1070\n00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,980\nIs like, oh it's common sense I\ndon't need to write this down.\n\n1071\n00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,380\nYes, yes you do, we need that for\nhistorical purposes.\n\n1072\n00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,320\nSo communicating that properly to them,\ngetting them trained up and\n\n1073\n00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320\nready to operate in\na projectized environment.\n\n1074\n00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,410\nThe next one is team building,\n\n1075\n00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,848\nand team building is one\nthat requires a bit of work.\n\n1076\n00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:14,386\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you are fortunate enough to have\n\n1077\n00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:18,265\nbeen working with the same group\nof employees for years and years.\n\n1078\n00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:22,135\nYou guys may already be a cohesive unit,\nthat's ready to operate and\n\n1079\n00:49:22,135 --> 00:49:25,625\ndo everything that you need at\nthe highest peak of performance.\n\n1080\n00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:29,415\nBut that's never happened for\nme, I've read about it somewhere.\n\n1081\n00:49:29,415 --> 00:49:33,150\nFor most of us though, you're going to\nhave at least one new team member, and\n\n1082\n00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,420\nanytime you introduce even\na single new team member.\n\n1083\n00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,720\nIt throws off the balance.\n\n1084\n00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,340\nYeah, it throws off the balance of\nthe project and the project team.\n\n1085\n00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:45,600\nSo you've got to get them back to\noperating like a smooth unit right.\n\n1086\n00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,580\nAnd there are a number of team building\nexercises that are out there for that.\n\n1087\n00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,110\nWe could talk about things like\nrock climbing or whatever.\n\n1088\n00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:58,054\nYou know, there's things you can do\nto get people to from a team, and\n\n1089\n00:49:58,054 --> 00:49:59,820\nform relationships.\n\n1090\n00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,610\nYou can let it happen on its own course,\nright?\n\n1091\n00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:04,110\nBut you run risks when you do that.\n\n1092\n00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,840\nSometimes people will choose\nto isolate themselves.\n\n1093\n00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,120\nOther times people start to form cliques.\n\n1094\n00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,240\nRight, so you get these divisions\ninside of your project team and\n\n1095\n00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,670\nthat's always a bad thing.\n\n1096\n00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,950\nSo more often than not\nas a project manager,\n\n1097\n00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,590\nyou need to get involved, all right.\n\n1098\n00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,900\nAnd when we get involved it's a good\nidea to recognize the various\n\n1099\n00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,830\nphases that a team goes through.\n\n1100\n00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,080\nAnd PMI specifically calls\nthis out in the PEMBAC.\n\n1101\n00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:31,380\nThey have what's called the Tuckman\nLadder, which defines like five different\n\n1102\n00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,800\nphases that a project goes through,\nand they're fairly easy to remember.\n\n1103\n00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,460\nLet me bring these up in the notes.\n\n1104\n00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,370\n>> Yeah, the overall developmental of the\nteam here, again, everybody goes through\n\n1105\n00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,500\npsychologically something, and here we're\nactually starting to take a look at that.\n\n1106\n00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,050\nIt's important that you\ndo understand these,\n\n1107\n00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,880\nbecause I think even Don\nwas talking about it.\n\n1108\n00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,120\nAnd, you will see this on the exam,\n\n1109\n00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,750\nso let's make sure we go ahead and\ncover this.\n\n1110\n00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,340\n>> All right.\nSo, there's five phases, and\n\n1111\n00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,870\nthey all kind of sound the same\nwhich makes them easy to remember.\n\n1112\n00:50:54,870 --> 00:51:00,440\nThere's Forming, Storming, Norming,\nPerforming and Adjourning.\n\n1113\n00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,430\nWhich doesn't sound right.\n\n1114\n00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,840\nYou can say adjourning and\nit makes it a little easier to remember.\n\n1115\n00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,165\nBut then you sound Nordic.\n\n1116\n00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:08,670\n[LAUGH] But adjourning is the last one.\n\n1117\n00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,700\nEach one kind of represents\nthe state that a team is in, and\n\n1118\n00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,710\nteams always start in the forming stage.\n\n1119\n00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,770\nAll right.\n\n1120\n00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,570\nAnd then,\nthey progress through these other stages,\n\n1121\n00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,530\nbut things can happen to\nmake them go backward.\n\n1122\n00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,870\nSo let's walk through what each stage is,\nand then we'll kind of give an example.\n\n1123\n00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,080\nSo forming is the very first stage.\n\n1124\n00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,370\nThis is where you get your team\ntogether in the very beginning and\n\n1125\n00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:32,810\nthey're meeting each other, for\nmany, for the first time, all right?\n\n1126\n00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,860\nSo these are people that may not have\never worked together a single moment.\n\n1127\n00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,980\nMaybe not have even bumped into\neach other in the hallway before.\n\n1128\n00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,950\nNow they're meeting each other, and\n\n1129\n00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,345\nthey're starting to kind of\nunderstand what the project is.\n\n1130\n00:51:44,345 --> 00:51:45,300\nYeah.\n\n1131\n00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,100\nNow a team in the forming\nphase is not ready to do work.\n\n1132\n00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,280\nOften times when you're in the forming\nphase they don't know who's responsibility\n\n1133\n00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,240\nwhat is.\n\n1134\n00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,830\nThey may not even know what\nthe project is just yet.\n\n1135\n00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:59,410\nSo you wanna get through the forming\nphase as quickly as possible.\n\n1136\n00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:04,590\nBasically as the project manager, you\nare informing them what the project is,\n\n1137\n00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:08,340\nwhat their job role is, those things\nto get them through the forming phase.\n\n1138\n00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,340\nAnd this is very important in a team\nbuilding, because what we need to do is we\n\n1139\n00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,170\nwant to make sure that everybody on\nthe team understands what my role is in\n\n1140\n00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,920\nthe team, or what Don's role\nis going to be in the team.\n\n1141\n00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,430\nSo the forming stage is very important,\n\n1142\n00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,950\nthat we go in and establish that here's\nwhat he's going to be responsible for, and\n\n1143\n00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:25,590\nhere's where we're going to go if we\nhave problems and issues with that.\n\n1144\n00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:28,400\nBecause without that right a lot of\ntimes people do come up with questions.\n\n1145\n00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,700\nAnd they go, you know I don't\nremember who to go to and ask.\n\n1146\n00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,380\nSo this is a very important part of it.\n\n1147\n00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,520\nYep.\n>> Yep.\n\n1148\n00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,820\n>> The second phase is storming,\nall right.\n\n1149\n00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:41,240\nWhen you get different people together,\nthere's different personality types.\n\n1150\n00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,980\nI can't even count the amount\nof different ways to measure,\n\n1151\n00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,655\nwhat are some of\nthe personality quiz things.\n\n1152\n00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:47,805\n>> Gosh.\nThere's so many.\n\n1153\n00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:48,875\nThere's Taylor Johnson.\n\n1154\n00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:49,855\nThere's disc.\n\n1155\n00:52:49,855 --> 00:52:50,815\nThere's so many.\n\n1156\n00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,875\n>> Disc.\nThat's a good one.\n\n1157\n00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:53,765\nYou hear people.\n\n1158\n00:52:53,765 --> 00:52:54,945\nLet's go really simple.\n\n1159\n00:52:54,945 --> 00:52:58,135\nYou hear people talk about\ntype A personalities.\n\n1160\n00:52:58,135 --> 00:53:00,595\nYou have some people who are alphas.\n\n1161\n00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:01,605\nWho are aggressive.\n\n1162\n00:53:01,605 --> 00:53:02,340\nWho are leaders.\n\n1163\n00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:06,000\nAnd then you have other people who aren't,\nwho are followers, not\n\n1164\n00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,520\nthat they're weak minded or anything like\nthat, they just don't want to step up and\n\n1165\n00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,800\ntake the leadership,\nthey're better at doing something.\n\n1166\n00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,940\nThey're doers, right.\n\n1167\n00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,680\nSo different people have\ndifferent personalities, and\n\n1168\n00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,800\nwhen a team first forms,\nwe don't know everybody's personality yet.\n\n1169\n00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,050\nSo when we're ready to start work,\nwe almost always go right into Storming.\n\n1170\n00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,100\nUnless the team has already been\nwell established in the past,\n\n1171\n00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,710\nyou might skip past this phase, but\n\n1172\n00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:33,040\nnormally we go right into storming and\nhere's where people start to butt heads.\n\n1173\n00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,880\nRight?\nHere's where people start doing work and\n\n1174\n00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,420\nthey're learning about each other,\nand how they do work and\n\n1175\n00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,800\nfinding out who is the alpha personality,\nwho is going to step up and\n\n1176\n00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,120\nbe that leader, and\nkind of how things are going to roll.\n\n1177\n00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,910\nThis can be good and bad.\n\n1178\n00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,890\nLeft uncontrolled, you can end up in\nsituations where somebody who is not\n\n1179\n00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,960\na project manager, becomes the de\nfacto ruler of your project,\n\n1180\n00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,960\nand that can be pretty bad, right?\n\n1181\n00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,950\nAs the project manager,\nyou are the leader.\n\n1182\n00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,810\nDoesn't matter if you have five\ntype A personalities on your team,\n\n1183\n00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,870\nyou're the leader so\nyou gotta rein them in.\n\n1184\n00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:07,990\nAnd you have to recognize that.\n\n1185\n00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,730\nSo, you're part of\nthe Storming process also.\n\n1186\n00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:11,620\nRight?\n>> Yeah, you know,\n\n1187\n00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,060\nwith that actually being unevalutated,\nit doesn't see it happen.\n\n1188\n00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,120\nAnd know where you have to go to control.\n\n1189\n00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,730\nIt becomes incredibly counterproductive\nin anything that you're\n\n1190\n00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:21,920\ntrying to do as a team from that point on,\ncuz now you have, you do,\n\n1191\n00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,140\nyou have that defactorial unit,\nand you have you.\n\n1192\n00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,880\nAs actually being the appointed leader,\nthey're not exactly sure who to listen to.\n\n1193\n00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,710\nSo really getting this out in\nthe open right at the beginning,\n\n1194\n00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,690\npart of a great process\nto building a team.\n\n1195\n00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:33,910\n>> Yep.\n\n1196\n00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,010\nOnce that's done, we shift into Norming.\n\n1197\n00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,810\nThe Norming phase is where all right.\n\n1198\n00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,270\n>> Yeah, jolly.\n>> People have learned how they work,\n\n1199\n00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,170\nhow they interact and\nthey start doing work, okay?\n\n1200\n00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> So they actually start being\n\n1201\n00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,620\nproductive at this point.\n\n1202\n00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,620\nThey may have been somewhat productive\nin the Storming phase, but probably not.\n\n1203\n00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,680\nNow they're ready to get things done.\n\n1204\n00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,140\nPeople have established their role, their\ndominance or submissiveness or whatever,\n\n1205\n00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,370\ninside of the project,\nand they're ready to rock.\n\n1206\n00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,040\nOkay?\n\n1207\n00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,590\nSo Norming is a pretty decent place to be,\nbut\n\n1208\n00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,660\nit just means people\nare getting things done.\n\n1209\n00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,940\nIt doesn't necessarily mean they're\nhappy about it or they're unhappy,\n\n1210\n00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,400\nthey're just getting things done.\n\n1211\n00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,170\nIf it's a good team though.\n\n1212\n00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:13,640\nIf everybody's able to communicate, and\nthings are going well, and people like\n\n1213\n00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,010\neach other, then all of a sudden we start\nswitching into what's called Performing.\n\n1214\n00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:22,520\nPerforming means not only are we\na team that works together, but\n\n1215\n00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:27,070\nwe work together highly efficiently, that\npeople know each other's pros and cons,\n\n1216\n00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,440\nthey kind of anticipate\neach other's needs, and\n\n1217\n00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,590\nnow they are able to work\nbetter than a normal team.\n\n1218\n00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,790\nWe can get even beyond that\nbecause of the closeness and\n\n1219\n00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,560\nthe relationship between the team members.\n\n1220\n00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,360\n>> Right\n>> That's where you want to be.\n\n1221\n00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,520\nWhen you're dealing with team building,\n\n1222\n00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,920\nPerforming is what you're\ntrying to achieve.\n\n1223\n00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,519\nSo even if your team is normalized,\nthey're working, they're doing okay,\n\n1224\n00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:48,726\nthat doesn't mean stop.\n\n1225\n00:55:48,726 --> 00:55:52,732\nYou've got to go even better, get these\npeople working really close together.\n\n1226\n00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:55,785\nCommunicating and exchanging information,\nand you'll get performing.\n\n1227\n00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:59,600\nThat's when you get the best effort\nout of all of your employees.\n\n1228\n00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,870\nNow any little thing can\nhappen to disrupt this.\n\n1229\n00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,240\nMaybe someone is out on sick leave.\n\n1230\n00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,140\nand so you have to bring in a replacement.\n\n1231\n00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,990\nWell, the instant you bring in\nthat replacement what happens?\n\n1232\n00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,700\nYou drop all the way back to storming,\nright?\n\n1233\n00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,550\nHere comes this new personality\nwho might be an alpha.\n\n1234\n00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:19,380\nWho has their own predisposition.\n\n1235\n00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,940\nAnd now you've got to\nkinda set that straight.\n\n1236\n00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,340\nKind line those expectations back up,\nand get things moving along.\n\n1237\n00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,910\nOr it might be a person that snaps\nright into the old persons place, and\n\n1238\n00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,650\nyou don't get any disruption whatsoever.\n\n1239\n00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,410\nBut it's not uncommon to drop all\nthe way back to storming, and\n\n1240\n00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,990\nthen you have to do norming,\nand then performing.\n\n1241\n00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,980\nKind of go through each of those again.\n\n1242\n00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,520\nSo just because you got to performing\nonce doesn't mean you stay there.\n\n1243\n00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,070\nAlright, it may not even be something\nlike adding a new employee,\n\n1244\n00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,420\nit could be an existing team.\n\n1245\n00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,700\nI can think of a great example.\n\n1246\n00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,410\nI was working on one project,\nwhere things were going great.\n\n1247\n00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,760\nWe were definitely in\nthat performing area.\n\n1248\n00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,110\nAll the team members were working\ntogether, things were going really well.\n\n1249\n00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,860\nAnd then we came to this spot where\nwe had to decide on a particular\n\n1250\n00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,460\npiece of hardware.\n\n1251\n00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,720\nWe had two vendors to pick from.\n\n1252\n00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,530\nAnd half the team preferred one vendor,\nand\n\n1253\n00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,240\nthe other half of the team\npreferred the other vendor.\n\n1254\n00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,100\nSo there became this divide in the project\nbased on this certain decision that\n\n1255\n00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,030\nhad to be made.\n\n1256\n00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,500\nNow we went through our\ndecision making process.\n\n1257\n00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,770\nWe did graded matrix cards and stuff.\n\n1258\n00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,399\nAnd then we selected one of the vendors.\n\n1259\n00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:25,070\nWell, from that point on,\nthe people that liked the other vendor,\n\n1260\n00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,300\nit was like a divide.\n\n1261\n00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:26,890\nIt really did.\n\n1262\n00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:31,360\nIt created a separation, and those\nemployees were not performing anymore.\n\n1263\n00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,530\nAnd since they weren't performing,\nthe other people couldn't perform.\n\n1264\n00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,590\nSo the whole team dropped down to norming.\n\n1265\n00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,490\nWe were still working.\n\n1266\n00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,210\nWe were still getting things done.\n\n1267\n00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:40,540\nBut that divide was there.\n\n1268\n00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,630\nIt was present.\n\n1269\n00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,940\nAnd basically I had to step in and\nstraighten that out.\n\n1270\n00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,090\nGet it where they understand, hey,\n\n1271\n00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:51,520\nat the end of the day your job isn't to\ninteract with this vendor or that vendor.\n\n1272\n00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,200\nIt's to move this project forward.\n\n1273\n00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,950\nSo we may deal with different vendors.\n\n1274\n00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:55,680\nThat's how it goes.\n\n1275\n00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,520\nWe had a scoring system that we all\nagreed upon in the planning phase.\n\n1276\n00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,910\nAnd we followed it right.\n\n1277\n00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,840\nSo you have to get people back in line.\n\n1278\n00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,860\nAnd we'll talk about that later when\nwe talk about issue management.\n\n1279\n00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:11,960\nAnd conflict resolution,\nwhich we get monitoring and controlling.\n\n1280\n00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,570\nSo we'll get a chance to see those later.\n\n1281\n00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,180\nBut that's what we need to keep our\neye out for as a project manager.\n\n1282\n00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:20,960\nTo make sure that we always see\nourselves in our performing phase.\n\n1283\n00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,460\nNow, when the project is done,\nwhen things start winding down.\n\n1284\n00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,590\nWe start getting our deliverables,\nand so on.\n\n1285\n00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:29,220\nThat's when we get into adjourning.\n\n1286\n00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,710\nOkay, adjourning is where our\nteam completes the work, and\n\n1287\n00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,010\nstarts to break apart.\n\n1288\n00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,460\nWe send our people back out to, you know,\nreturn them to the PMO or wherever, so\n\n1289\n00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,870\nthey can go and\nget assigned to the next project.\n\n1290\n00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:44,870\nNow, the reason adjourning is called out\nhere as a special phase is, as a PM,\n\n1291\n00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,630\nthere's some work we need to do.\n\n1292\n00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:50,450\nWe'll see this in the closing process\ngroup when we get to that, or\n\n1293\n00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,680\nthe closing phase.\n\n1294\n00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,580\nBecause what we want to do is we\nwant to create a score card, or\n\n1295\n00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,510\na report card for each person\nthat was a member of that team.\n\n1296\n00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:02,050\nAnd in there we want to report things like\nhow well they participated in the team.\n\n1297\n00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,480\nHow well they got along with person A or\nperson B, or person C.\n\n1298\n00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,450\nSo, that in the future when\nwe build our next team\n\n1299\n00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:11,150\nwe can make sure to get\nthe best team members possible.\n\n1300\n00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,620\nMay be I'm making a team of ten people,\n\n1301\n00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,130\nand there was one in particular that\nwas dragging the whole team down.\n\n1302\n00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,250\nWell, you can whip them into shape and\nget them in line, and\n\n1303\n00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,640\nturn them into a great employee, but\nsometimes that just doesn't work out.\n\n1304\n00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,550\nAnd so at the end of the day you\ncan mark that employee and say,\n\n1305\n00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:27,230\nyou know what, I wanna make sure I\ndon't have that guy on my next team.\n\n1306\n00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,220\nThe next time I form a team, we would\nbe better off without that person.\n\n1307\n00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,870\nSo that's information we need to know.\n\n1308\n00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:34,530\nAnd that's why we have\na designated adjourning phase.\n\n1309\n00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,820\nSo we can recognize that stuff and\nkind of document it.\n\n1310\n00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:42,550\nAll right, so those are all part\nof team building activities.\n\n1311\n00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,570\nThere are a few other things, and\n\n1312\n00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:47,575\nbe careful with these, team building\nactivities can go horribly wrong.\n\n1313\n00:59:47,575 --> 00:59:49,520\n[LAUGH]\n>> One of my favorites.\n\n1314\n00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,890\nI went to work for a company and they\nwanted to have a team building exercise.\n\n1315\n00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:57,720\nSo they decided that the best thing to\ndo would be to take the whole team and\n\n1316\n00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,840\ngo go-kart racing.\n\n1317\n00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,801\nAnd Ronnie, you've known me long enough,\nyou know I hate go-kart racing.\n\n1318\n01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:06,940\nAnd so we go go-kart racing.\n\n1319\n01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,160\nAnd I was thinking about it as I'm in this\nstupid little car driving around a track.\n\n1320\n01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,280\nAnd I'm thinking, boy,\nwhat better way to do team building\n\n1321\n01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,090\nthan to isolate each team\nmember in a separate car so\n\n1322\n01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:20,270\nthey can't talk to each other And\nthen pit them against each other, right?\n\n1323\n01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,870\nThat's just the ultimate in team building,\nand\n\n1324\n01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,650\nit was just a great example\nof a very poor exercise.\n\n1325\n01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:30,780\nYou want to create exercises\nthat get people talking,\n\n1326\n01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,830\nget people working together.\n\n1327\n01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:34,571\nSomething just as simple as going\nto lunch together as a team.\n\n1328\n01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:38,200\nYou know, kind of stuff to create\nthat non workplace chatter.\n\n1329\n01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,580\nJust to get people to understand\neach other's personalities.\n\n1330\n01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:43,960\nSome people have a hard time\ncoming out of their shells, and\n\n1331\n01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,530\nin the workplace that may not happen.\n\n1332\n01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,650\nSo, you've got to find out what works for\nyou.\n\n1333\n01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,220\nNow we've got a laundry list of\nother tools here, like ground rules.\n\n1334\n01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,850\nGround rules are an important one for\nme, especially in meetings.\n\n1335\n01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:59,380\nYou can have ground rules for everything,\nbut meetings are one of the best places.\n\n1336\n01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,950\nI've noticed over the years.\n\n1337\n01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:04,360\nThat if you're gonna manage\npersonality types like type As.\n\n1338\n01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,360\nWhat's a type A going to do in a meeting?\n\n1339\n01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,560\nThey're gonna have an idea.\n\n1340\n01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,310\nSo if I say all right, does anybody have\nany idea of how we can get this done on\n\n1341\n01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:13,890\nschedule, a type A is gonna have an idea,\nright?\n\n1342\n01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:16,410\nBut what about somebody\nwho's not a type A,\n\n1343\n01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:21,370\nsomebody who's a type B or\nwhatever's not a type A?\n\n1344\n01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,550\nWell, they might have a great idea.\n\n1345\n01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:24,800\nBut not want to say it.\n\n1346\n01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,290\nThey might say man, I could recommend it,\nbut that type A person,\n\n1347\n01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,570\nthey're just gonna steamroll me.\n\n1348\n01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:33,730\nThey're gonna bulldoze my idea,\nand just brow beat me, and\n\n1349\n01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:34,770\ntheir idea's gonna win out.\n\n1350\n01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:37,140\nSo I'll just keep it quiet.\n\n1351\n01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,590\nBut we wanna make sure that\neverybody participates equally.\n\n1352\n01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:42,310\nSo how do we do that?\n\n1353\n01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:43,850\nWe can establish ground rules.\n\n1354\n01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:47,350\nWe can set up rules for the meeting,\nand these can be very simple rules,\n\n1355\n01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,540\nvery complex rules,\n\n1356\n01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,640\nthey can be silly rules, like talking\nstick, if you've ever seen that one.\n\n1357\n01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,940\nYou can only talk if you've\ngot the talking stick.\n\n1358\n01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,050\nAnd you pass it around, and\n\n1359\n01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:00,250\nthat helps to eliminate the whole idea\nof somebody steamrolling other people.\n\n1360\n01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,370\nYou might have other rules that say like,\n\n1361\n01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:05,490\nhey when we have a decision in a meeting\nwe always use the Delfi technique.\n\n1362\n01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:07,590\nThe anonymous voting system or\n\n1363\n01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,460\nsomething like that,\nto make sure that we've got that.\n\n1364\n01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,110\nOther ground rules might\nbe to just say things like,\n\n1365\n01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,890\nwe don't allow people to raise\ntheir voices in the meetings.\n\n1366\n01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:19,410\nMeetings are always held to 30 minutes,\nand are not allowed to go over.\n\n1367\n01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,870\nYou're not allowed to\neat during the meetings.\n\n1368\n01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,230\nThey can be very simple mundane things.\n\n1369\n01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:26,213\nBut help the meetings stay cohesive.\n\n1370\n01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:30,020\nAlright, colocation.\n\n1371\n01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,960\nI kind of talked about this\nearlier with virtual teams.\n\n1372\n01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,750\nWith virtual teams you might have\nemployees all over the country,\n\n1373\n01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,080\nall over the world.\n\n1374\n01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,950\nAnd you lose that cohesive unit.\n\n1375\n01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,940\nYou lose the banter, the daily chit\nchat that helps to build a strong team.\n\n1376\n01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,980\nSo many organizations\nchoose to do colocation.\n\n1377\n01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:49,530\nNow, This applies even if all\nthe employees work in the same city.\n\n1378\n01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:52,960\nSo, for example I used to\nwork in a skyscraper, and\n\n1379\n01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,940\nour offices were spread\nacross five floors.\n\n1380\n01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:59,210\nSo we had like the 17th through\n21st floors, is what we had.\n\n1381\n01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,380\nAnd that meant employees could\nbe on any of those floors.\n\n1382\n01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,700\nThere were many employees\nthat I never saw in a day.\n\n1383\n01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,090\nI would go straight to the 19th floor,\nwhere my office was.\n\n1384\n01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:06,600\nI'd go in there.\n\n1385\n01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,010\nI'd see my department, right?\n\n1386\n01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:09,710\nThe IT guys, that's what I would see.\n\n1387\n01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:12,750\nBut I wouldn't see anybody in\nunderwriting, or accounting, or\n\n1388\n01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:13,990\nthese other departments.\n\n1389\n01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,660\nBecause they were on different floors.\n\n1390\n01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,510\nSo when you have a project,\na cool technique to use to\n\n1391\n01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:23,480\nbuild cohesiveness between your project\nmanagement team is co-location.\n\n1392\n01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,650\nHave them move their desks,\nmove their offices all to the same area.\n\n1393\n01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,620\nSo now it's not just me\nin the IT department.\n\n1394\n01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,100\nIt's me surrounded by my project team.\n\n1395\n01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,130\nWhich might have an accountant and so on.\n\n1396\n01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:35,140\nAll a part of that.\n\n1397\n01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,620\nThey're non IT people.\n\n1398\n01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:41,300\nThe nice thing about co-location is if\nI'm on the phone call with somebody and\n\n1399\n01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:45,500\nI'm talking to them about information And\nI'm like, hey, why are you over budget?\n\n1400\n01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,430\nMeanwhile, my accountant is\nsitting over beside me, and\n\n1401\n01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:50,210\nthey overhear the phone call and\nsay, oh wait.\n\n1402\n01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:51,360\nI've got some information on that.\n\n1403\n01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,045\nRight.\nNow we get better communication.\n\n1404\n01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:55,623\nThey had information I didn't,\nbut they were right there.\n\n1405\n01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,289\nSo it was able to happen And\nthat solved the problem,\n\n1406\n01:03:58,289 --> 01:04:00,175\nit's not always realistic though.\n\n1407\n01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:04,165\nIn a cube office like what we do here, I\ncould move cubes it would take me like ten\n\n1408\n01:04:04,165 --> 01:04:08,850\nminutes, right not a big deal, there's\nnothing in my cube I really care about.\n\n1409\n01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,240\nWell, it would really tick me off\nif someone took my computer but for\n\n1410\n01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,720\nthe most part, there's not anything\nin there that I care about but\n\n1411\n01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,510\nif you have an actual office, right?\n\n1412\n01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,670\nActually moving your\nentire office contents or\n\n1413\n01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:21,280\nsomething is not necessarily realistic.\n\n1414\n01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,528\nSo it's not an option for every\ncompany but it is an option for some.\n\n1415\n01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:29,780\nAll right, recognition and rewards.\n\n1416\n01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,550\nWith each of your team\nmembers they provide a role,\n\n1417\n01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:34,790\nthey provide a service to your project.\n\n1418\n01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:39,520\nAnd as your project moves along, some\npeople might do exemplary performance and\n\n1419\n01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,630\nwe wanna make sure we reward that but\n\n1420\n01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:43,570\nrewarding them actually\nserves two purposes.\n\n1421\n01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:46,090\nOne, it cements that person's\nposition in the project.\n\n1422\n01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,150\nThey understand they're doing a great job,\nyou've bolstered their confidence and\n\n1423\n01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:53,350\nmorale and it keeps them working,\nright, and it keeps them working well.\n\n1424\n01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:57,160\nBut it also encourages those who didn't\nget the award to say, man, if I do\n\n1425\n01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,230\na better job, this is the recognition\nI'll get, I'd really like that.\n\n1426\n01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,080\nAnd so it is a good idea to draw that out.\n\n1427\n01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,140\nWe also mentioned recognition and\nrewards at the close of a project,\n\n1428\n01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,050\nto reward the team there too.\n\n1429\n01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:10,850\nBut these are part of the team process.\n\n1430\n01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:13,830\nWhen somebody does an exceptional\njob you should recognize that.\n\n1431\n01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,520\nMake sure that the rest\nof the team is aware.\n\n1432\n01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:19,650\nAnd then personnel assessment tools.\n\n1433\n01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:23,360\nThis is what I mentioned earlier as\nfar as a scorecard or a grade report,\n\n1434\n01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,790\nwhatever you want to call it,\nwhere we need to assess our team members.\n\n1435\n01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,730\nAnd you may create ahead of time\na little score sheet that says,\n\n1436\n01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,000\nget's along well with others,\n\n1437\n01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,675\nattendance, things like that, all\nthe things we had in elementary school.\n\n1438\n01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:38,360\n[LAUGH] Use that to gauge your employees.\n\n1439\n01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,000\nIf you have a team member\nwho is falling behind,\n\n1440\n01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,700\nwho is not communicating with the team,\nyou've got two choices, right.\n\n1441\n01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,080\nChoice number one is to can them,\ndump them out of the project,\n\n1442\n01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,230\nget a replacement employee.\n\n1443\n01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,870\nYou can do that, certainly.\n\n1444\n01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:54,550\nBut the better options, option two,\nwhich is to correct that.\n\n1445\n01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,710\nTrain them to be better,\nmake sure they recognize their faults.\n\n1446\n01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,770\nA lot of times they just\ndon't even know it.\n\n1447\n01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:03,060\nSo you make sure they recognize it,\nyou inform them, you let them know and\n\n1448\n01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,410\ngive them the chance to\nbecome a better employee.\n\n1449\n01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:08,630\nBecause when they're a better employee,\nnot only does it help your project but\n\n1450\n01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:12,180\nit helps the next project that's\ngonna get that same employee, too.\n\n1451\n01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:15,040\nBetter to craft somebody who's\na successful employee than to just\n\n1452\n01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,570\nkeep starting from scratch until you hope\nto hit somebody who meets your needs by\n\n1453\n01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:19,370\nluck, right?\n\n1454\n01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:21,160\nThat's not really effective.\n\n1455\n01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,280\n>> Yeah, and\nyou read about this a lot of times and\n\n1456\n01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,430\nthe idea of the management books\nthat you actually see out there,\n\n1457\n01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:29,450\nwhere it talks about the idea of finding\nthe right person, then training them up,\n\n1458\n01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:32,830\ninstead of trying to look for every skill\nthat you need and then hoping that they're\n\n1459\n01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,700\nthe right person and this is a part\nof the idea of the assessment.\n\n1460\n01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,060\nMost people don't know if they're\nactually doing a great job or\n\n1461\n01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:42,220\nif they're doing an okay or mediocre or\nnot even a great job at all.\n\n1462\n01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,110\nBy helping them out to\nbe able to see that,\n\n1463\n01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:47,830\nit really does actually help them in\nterms of what they're doing every day.\n\n1464\n01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,530\nIt really just helps you because\nthey're going to become a more\n\n1465\n01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:51,810\nproductive team member.\n\n1466\n01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:53,100\nSo do remember that.\n\n1467\n01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:59,070\n>> There is a saying out on the internet\nright now, you're various IT companies,\n\n1468\n01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:04,960\nvery edgy, silicon valley,\nthey say, hire slow, fire fast.\n\n1469\n01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,765\nSo what they're saying is hire slow,\ntake time to find the right employee.\n\n1470\n01:07:09,765 --> 01:07:13,210\nAnd if they're not the right fit,\nfire them fast and move on.\n\n1471\n01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:17,580\nNow there's something to be said about\nthat approach but the fire fast thing\n\n1472\n01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:21,100\nmeans, instead of trying to correct the\nproblem, just give up on them and move on.\n\n1473\n01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,870\nAnd that's not really right for\nmost environments so be wary of that.\n\n1474\n01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:29,580\nWe hear about it because of companies\nlike Facebook and Amazon and Zappos and\n\n1475\n01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,450\nstuff where they are massive,\nmulti billion dollar companies, so\n\n1476\n01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:36,010\nwhen they fire somebody, a replacement?\n\n1477\n01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,750\nWell they've probably got a stack of\nresumes 10,000 high for that replacement.\n\n1478\n01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,430\nBut if you're a small or medium\norganization, somewhere like here in\n\n1479\n01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:48,840\nGainesville, if I got tired of Ronnie and\nfired him it's not like I've got a stack\n\n1480\n01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,950\nof show host resumes sitting over on my\ndesk that I could go and pick through.\n\n1481\n01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:54,610\n>> Wait, wait.\nYou have a whole\n\n1482\n01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,230\nChat room full probably now.\n\n1483\n01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:59,430\n>> That's right, everybody's like wow,\nI need to email Don.\n\n1484\n01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:03,560\nSo, it can be hard to line up that\nnext person and having a poor\n\n1485\n01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:08,140\nemployee that can be trained up better is\nmore valuable than having no employee.\n\n1486\n01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:11,190\nSo, you want to make sure you take\nthe approach that's right for\n\n1487\n01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:15,870\nyour situation and don't let\nSilicon Valley serve as your model.\n\n1488\n01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:22,190\nIt's like, have you ever heard the Steam,\nnot Steam, Valve.\n\n1489\n01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:24,280\nValve is a video game company.\n\n1490\n01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:28,406\nAnd they released their employee handbook\nout into the internet and people were\n\n1491\n01:08:28,406 --> 01:08:32,430\ngoing crazy over it because they had this\ninteresting project selection process.\n\n1492\n01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:34,960\nSo when they pick up a new project,\nwhat do they do?\n\n1493\n01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,530\nThey don't,\nthey let their employees do it.\n\n1494\n01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:40,120\nAnd they just they leave their\nemployees unassigned to teams and\n\n1495\n01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,580\nif the employees want,\nthey meet each other in the hallways and\n\n1496\n01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,940\nsay hey how do you feel\nabout working on this game?\n\n1497\n01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,540\nAnd they form a team right there and\n\n1498\n01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,570\nthey start to work on projects that\nweren't selected by the company.\n\n1499\n01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:52,920\nAnd some people see it like,\nman that sounds great.\n\n1500\n01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,330\nAnd I tell you, it does not work\nin most environments, right.\n\n1501\n01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:59,100\nAnd maybe the video game industry is\ndifferent, cuz they're very successful.\n\n1502\n01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:02,050\nBut if you were to do like,\nbuilding houses and\n\n1503\n01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,070\nyou just left it up to your\ncontractors to come together and\n\n1504\n01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:08,140\nsay, what do you think about building a\nfive story Tudor style house or whatever.\n\n1505\n01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,480\nThey could come up with all sorts of\ncrazy things, so finding the right\n\n1506\n01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,640\nteam methodology for your environment,\nobviously very important.\n\n1507\n01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,310\nAll right, now our outputs on this\nare really really straightforward, right.\n\n1508\n01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,950\nWe've got our\nTeam Performance Assessments.\n\n1509\n01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:23,370\nWe're talking about the entire team\nnot just a single person, here,\n\n1510\n01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,430\nthe entire team.\n\n1511\n01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:27,190\nWe need to evaluate it and\ncome up with a summary.\n\n1512\n01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:29,710\nAre we storming, norming, performing?\n\n1513\n01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:31,770\nWhere are we in that model?\n\n1514\n01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:32,470\nAll right.\n\n1515\n01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,480\nThen our enterprise environmental\nfactor updates, right.\n\n1516\n01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,580\nEnterprise environmental factors,\n\n1517\n01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,470\nremember that's how we do\nthe things that we do, right.\n\n1518\n01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:41,400\nHow our company operates.\n\n1519\n01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:45,850\nAnd as our team builds and we come up with\nnew ideas, new team building structures,\n\n1520\n01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:49,090\nwe may want to update our enterprise\nenvironmental factors to reflect that so\n\n1521\n01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:51,820\nthat other project managers\ncan take advantage of it, too.\n\n1522\n01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:55,140\nWe might say, boy,\nthat go-kart thing was a really bad idea.\n\n1523\n01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:59,070\nAnd so we can put that into our EEFs and\nbasically state, like, don't do this.\n\n1524\n01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:02,200\nThat really didn't work out.\n\n1525\n01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,650\nSo my second favorite, so\nthe go-kart racing was a bad one.\n\n1526\n01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:08,140\nCrew, are you familiar with crew?\n\n1527\n01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,440\nThe boating.\n\n1528\n01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,340\nSo, it's like Ivy league schools do.\n\n1529\n01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,430\nThey have a really long, thin boat and\nyou have ten people on there.\n\n1530\n01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:19,840\nAnd one person who's the coxswain and\nthey're yelling out stroke or whatever and\n\n1531\n01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:20,740\neverybody rows.\n\n1532\n01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,500\nSo, sounds like a great\nteam building exercise.\n\n1533\n01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:27,290\nIf everybody's not moving their oars at\nthe same time, you don't go anywhere.\n\n1534\n01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,345\n>> You can't breath.\n\n1535\n01:10:28,345 --> 01:10:30,080\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, the problem is,\n\n1536\n01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,100\nyou might have some team members\nthat are out of shape or\n\n1537\n01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,691\nyou might have team members like this guy\nright here who don't know how to swim.\n\n1538\n01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:37,567\n[LAUGH] And I'll be damned if\nI'm going on some kind of boat.\n\n1539\n01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:45,200\n[LAUGH] And so now, again It is tough to\nfind that right exercise for your team.\n\n1540\n01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,259\nYeah, that was my fault.\n\n1541\n01:10:46,259 --> 01:10:47,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can't be a team member,\n\n1542\n01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,940\nI can't even swim.\n\n1543\n01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,420\nAlright, so maybe that strengthens\nyour relationship, right?\n\n1544\n01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,320\nI'm counting on one of them\nto save me from drowning.\n\n1545\n01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:53,920\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1546\n01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,950\nIf they can breath.\n\n1547\n01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,450\nAs long as they can breath.\n\n1548\n01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:58,820\n>> Alright, anyway I don't like\ngetting up that early in the morning.\n\n1549\n01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,930\nThe crew, they always do it at like 5 AM.\n\n1550\n01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,550\n>> Yeah.\n>> They're crazy.\n\n1551\n01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:04,330\nAll right.\nWell, that's pretty much it for\n\n1552\n01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,670\ndeveloping the project team.\n\n1553\n01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:09,140\nWe have a little bit more team building\nto go on before we wrap this episode up,\n\n1554\n01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,075\nso let's stop here and take a break.\n\n1555\n01:11:11,075 --> 01:11:13,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And when we get back,\n\n1556\n01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,940\nwe've got managing the project\nteam to jump into.\n\n1557\n01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,160\n>> Yeah.\n>> So stay tuned.\n\n1558\n01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,752\nWe'll be back in a minute.\n\n1559\n01:11:18,752 --> 01:11:26,463\n[MUSIC]\n\n1560\n01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,510\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1561\n01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:31,720\nSo now we're going to dive into\nmanaging the project team.\n\n1562\n01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,180\nWe've formed our team,\n\n1563\n01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,420\nwe've got our people together,\nnow it's time to start work.\n\n1564\n01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:39,440\nWe are in the execution phase and\npeople should be executing.\n\n1565\n01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,560\nNow your team members each have different\nresponsibilities that they're performing\n\n1566\n01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,280\nand we need to keep an eye on that.\n\n1567\n01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,230\nNow, how do we keep an eye on that?\n\n1568\n01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,840\nIf it's a small team, we might just\nbe managing that ourselves, right?\n\n1569\n01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,487\nAnd you'll see that's the first tool and\ntechnique right here.\n\n1570\n01:11:52,487 --> 01:11:54,989\nObservation and Conservation.\nWe, as the project manager,\n\n1571\n01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:57,072\njust Keep an eye on our team.\n\n1572\n01:11:57,072 --> 01:11:58,658\nIf everybody's collocated,\n\n1573\n01:11:58,658 --> 01:12:02,870\nif they're all in one area, you can walk\naround and see them, that's easy to do.\n\n1574\n01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:08,860\nBut if you're a virtual team, if your team\nis spread out, if it's a massive team that\n\n1575\n01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:13,043\none person can't possibly manage, then\nyou're gonna be relying on other things.\n\n1576\n01:12:13,043 --> 01:12:15,500\nAnd that's where our\nInputs come in over here.\n\n1577\n01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,110\nLook at all the Inputs that we've got.\n\n1578\n01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,220\nThe Human Resource Management Plan,\nthat goes without saying.\n\n1579\n01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,460\nRight?\nThis is how we're gonna manage our people.\n\n1580\n01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:25,060\nThe Project Staff Assignments,\nso we know who is doing what,\n\n1581\n01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:27,010\nwhose got what responsibilities.\n\n1582\n01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:30,530\nBut then, we start to see the actual\ninformation that we're gonna work with.\n\n1583\n01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:34,090\nTeam Performance Assessments, Issue Logs,\nand Work Performance Reports.\n\n1584\n01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,050\nLet's talk about each one of these.\n\n1585\n01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:39,420\nTeam performance assessments,\nI mentioned in the last segment,\n\n1586\n01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,330\nwhen you've got a team and\nyou've done your storming,\n\n1587\n01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:45,640\nnorming, [LAUGH] storming,\nforming, norming, performing.\n\n1588\n01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,920\nWhen you've done all of that,\nyou need to stay performing.\n\n1589\n01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,850\nAnd so, you need to be assessing your\nteam to make sure they stay there.\n\n1590\n01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,660\nAnd so we may have an assessment report.\n\n1591\n01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,500\nI've got an example template.\n\n1592\n01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,530\nLet's see, where is it?\n\n1593\n01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:57,330\nI've got all sorts of junk.\n\n1594\n01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:57,920\n>> The second one, isn't it?\n\n1595\n01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,120\n>> Is it the second one?\n\n1596\n01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,160\nTeam performance does.\n\n1597\n01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,050\nThere we go.\nThis is an example of a performance\n\n1598\n01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:04,780\nassessment and\n\n1599\n01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:08,360\nyou'll see this there's really not much\nto it, notice how its breaking it down.\n\n1600\n01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:12,184\nScope, Quality, Schedule, okay?\n\n1601\n01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:13,844\nAnd cost.\n\n1602\n01:13:13,844 --> 01:13:17,619\nWhat kind of broken up scope and\nquality, I normally combine those.\n\n1603\n01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:21,916\nSo scope and quality, how well is\nthe team working together to create and\n\n1604\n01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:26,550\nachieve the scope of our project and\nthe quality that we've set aside.\n\n1605\n01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:32,160\nDo they exceed expectations, do they meet\nexpectations or do they need improvement?\n\n1606\n01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:37,030\nMeets expectations, that means we're\nnorming, things are running fine, but\n\n1607\n01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,700\nboy we're not performing.\n\n1608\n01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,520\nExceeds expectations means\nwe're performing, but\n\n1609\n01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,840\nwhen we're in these storming or\nnorming phases, those, or\n\n1610\n01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,760\nstorming or forming phases that's where\nwe're in the needs in improvement.\n\n1611\n01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:52,830\nAnd we can identify that and kind of\nrecognize how we're proceeding on that.\n\n1612\n01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:57,180\nSo this is just an example of\na Team Performance Report.\n\n1613\n01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:00,480\nAnd it goes on to break it down further,\nindividual areas that need improvement.\n\n1614\n01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,350\nCommunication, collaboration,\nconflict management, right?\n\n1615\n01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:05,900\nEach of these different things,\nwe kind of fill out.\n\n1616\n01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,420\nNow, how often do you need to\ndo this type of assessment?\n\n1617\n01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,170\nDepends on your project, right?\n\n1618\n01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:15,000\nIf your project is a five year project.\n\n1619\n01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,280\nWe were just talking about Star Trek,\nright?\n\n1620\n01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,450\nA five year, anyhow,\nif you've got a five year project,\n\n1621\n01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:23,490\nyou might be doing these assessments\nevery three months, or every six months.\n\n1622\n01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:24,750\nIf you've got a three month project,\n\n1623\n01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:29,050\nyou're probably doing these assessments\nevery week, trying to keep track of things\n\n1624\n01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:32,270\nin a manner that leaves you\nenough time to correct for that.\n\n1625\n01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:35,430\nThat's a Team Performance Assessment.\n\n1626\n01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:38,260\nI've also got\nTeam Member Performance Assessments\n\n1627\n01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,820\nwhich are really just the same thing.\n\n1628\n01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:42,440\nScope, quality, schedule, cost, and\n\n1629\n01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:46,690\nthen the individual elements inside\nof there on the single person.\n\n1630\n01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,050\nSo, if we find that we're needing\nto evaluate individual people,\n\n1631\n01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,610\nit's really just the same basic form.\n\n1632\n01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:56,390\nSo, those are some things we can use\nas we start to break down the team.\n\n1633\n01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:59,220\nThere are other forms and\npaperwork we might deal with.\n\n1634\n01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,790\nWe might have team operating agreements.\n\n1635\n01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:04,500\nAll right, here's where we set\nforth our values and principles,\n\n1636\n01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,910\nour meeting guidelines.\n\n1637\n01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:08,350\nRight, the ground rules\nI mentioned earlier.\n\n1638\n01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:12,490\nIf we've defined these things out we use\nthese as part of our assessments, how well\n\n1639\n01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:16,730\nare people adhering to all the different\nthings that we specified in here?\n\n1640\n01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:22,560\nWhat are our guidelines,\ndecision making processes, and so on?\n\n1641\n01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,020\nSo, those are some of the documents.\n\n1642\n01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,890\nThere are others, let's see, what else\ndo we call out here, an issue log and\n\n1643\n01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,690\na work performance report.\n\n1644\n01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:31,259\nThe issue log is pretty important.\n\n1645\n01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:35,130\nWhen there's an issue,\na conflict, an argument,\n\n1646\n01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,270\na problem, we need to address it.\n\n1647\n01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:41,590\nOne employee comes to you and says,\nlook, I'm working really hard here.\n\n1648\n01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:43,600\nThis other guy, he's not.\n\n1649\n01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,980\nHe's not pulling his weight and\nI'm having to double up my effort.\n\n1650\n01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:48,800\nIt's gonna hurt the project,\nit's definitely gonna hurt my moral.\n\n1651\n01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,590\nAs a Project Manager,\nyou need to step in and\n\n1652\n01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:54,120\ndo something about it,\nwhether it's a real problem or not.\n\n1653\n01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:57,010\nBecause sometimes people will\nbring you silly things like,\n\n1654\n01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:01,710\nI really like the Seattle Seahawks but\nthat guy's a San Diego Chargers fan and\n\n1655\n01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:03,100\nI just can't work with him!\n\n1656\n01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,170\nWell, we don't care about that.\n\n1657\n01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:06,920\nBut it's an issue, right?\n\n1658\n01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,910\nWe need to report it in the issue log so\nwe can refer to it later.\n\n1659\n01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:12,900\nIt especially helps if you\nhave a problem employee,\n\n1660\n01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,930\nyou can see multiple issues have arisen\naround that same person, then you can say,\n\n1661\n01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:19,570\nlook, you're not meshing\nwell with the team.\n\n1662\n01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:21,900\nLook at all these issues we've\nhad over the last six months,\n\n1663\n01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,090\nall these problems that have popped up.\n\n1664\n01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:26,360\nThe other thing is that\nwhen your project is done.\n\n1665\n01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:31,290\nYour project may be successful, come in\nat budget, on schedule right everything\n\n1666\n01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:35,320\nmeets needs, it meets the scope in\nqualities, things coming great, but\n\n1667\n01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:39,050\nyou might have had a problem employee\nthat whole time along that project.\n\n1668\n01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:41,640\nWell, when the next\nproject comes around and\n\n1669\n01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,060\nthey're acquiring their team, how do they\nknow if that team member is good or not?\n\n1670\n01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,390\nThey look at the project history and\nthey say wow, this guy was on Don's last\n\n1671\n01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:51,605\nproject and Don's project was a success,\nthis guy must be pretty good, right?\n\n1672\n01:16:51,605 --> 01:16:55,650\nBut,if we have our issue log,\nthey can say, whoa, it's amazing.\n\n1673\n01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,630\nDon's project came in successful,\n\n1674\n01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:59,950\neven with this guy causing\nproblems the whole time.\n\n1675\n01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,390\nAn issue log is what does that.\n\n1676\n01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:02,850\nAnd if you look at it,\nthere's not too much.\n\n1677\n01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:05,640\nThe way this is laid out, it's actually,\n\n1678\n01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:09,460\nit should just kind of continue on\nsideways but it's wider than the paper.\n\n1679\n01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,530\nSo with each issue, you assign an ID.\n\n1680\n01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:14,480\nIt's normally just going to be issue 1,\nissue 2, issue 3.\n\n1681\n01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,270\nYou give it a category if\nyou've got categories for\n\n1682\n01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:20,050\nissues, and then what the issue is.\n\n1683\n01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:24,250\nSo, I might have an issue\nwith an employee, and\n\n1684\n01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,410\nmaybe it's something serious, right?\n\n1685\n01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:29,090\nMaybe it's like a harassment issue,\na harassment claim,\n\n1686\n01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:29,940\nwhich I'm spelling wrong.\n\n1687\n01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,150\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH] You know a harassment claim and\n\n1688\n01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:39,150\nI might specify the impact on objectives,\nright?\n\n1689\n01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:42,380\nIf I have two employees who can't work\ntogether I have to separate them out,\n\n1690\n01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,910\ncan't have them in the same room.\n\n1691\n01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:48,110\nThat's going to reduce their productivity\nand it's going to extend my project\n\n1692\n01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:53,830\nschedule due to the special needs, urgency\non a harassment issue should be high.\n\n1693\n01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:57,240\nThe responsible party, you know who it is\nthat's handling that, that's usually gonna\n\n1694\n01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,990\nbe the project manager or you might have\nto get human resources involved in it.\n\n1695\n01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:02,840\nAll right.\n\n1696\n01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:09,290\nAction, separate employees or\nit might be terminate employee.\n\n1697\n01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:14,070\nYour status, this might be ongoing, and a\ndue date you need to take action if you've\n\n1698\n01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:16,290\ngot one If it's ongoing,\nI might not have one.\n\n1699\n01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:20,090\nAnd then, in the comments, I detail\nwhat the issue is and so as we go,\n\n1700\n01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:21,040\nwe're tracking this.\n\n1701\n01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,470\nTracking what the issue is and\nit might be issues with people.\n\n1702\n01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:27,100\nIt might be issues with just\nthe project as a whole.\n\n1703\n01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,950\nHey, there was a risk, right?\n\n1704\n01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:31,660\nThat the price of wood might go up.\n\n1705\n01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:35,020\nAnd as a result in my house building\nproject my expense is now high.\n\n1706\n01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:37,060\nI would record that as an issue.\n\n1707\n01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,430\nSo an issue log is a living document.\n\n1708\n01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:41,210\nIt doesn't really affect your project.\n\n1709\n01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:42,600\nThe issues affect your project but\n\n1710\n01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,690\nthe log itself is more to\nbenefit projects of the future.\n\n1711\n01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:49,300\nAnd to allow you to see trends if\nyou've got a problem area that's\n\n1712\n01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,810\nconstantly creeping up.\n\n1713\n01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,860\nIf you have more than one project manager,\n\n1714\n01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:56,040\nif you have subproject managers and\nissue log is essential.\n\n1715\n01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,420\nIt's the only way you can track this\nkind of activity across your project.\n\n1716\n01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,710\nOther things that we might have,\nthings like a team directory, just to\n\n1717\n01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:08,290\nbe able to identify who your team members\nare, their phone numbers and so on.\n\n1718\n01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,560\nTeam member status reports.\n\n1719\n01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,700\nAs you do individual evaluations of your\nteam members, you can go in and break\n\n1720\n01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:19,220\nit down like this indicating what their\nactivities are that are assigned to them.\n\n1721\n01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:23,125\nWhat their activities that they've\naccomplished, activities planned but\n\n1722\n01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,555\nnot accomplished this reporting period.\n\n1723\n01:19:24,555 --> 01:19:28,015\nWhat's outstanding,\njust kind of keeping track of that and\n\n1724\n01:19:28,015 --> 01:19:30,425\nany root causes for variance.\n\n1725\n01:19:30,425 --> 01:19:34,165\nAnytime they didn't meet the requirements\nthat you set forth, why?\n\n1726\n01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:37,275\nSo you can kind of lay all\nthat information out there,\n\n1727\n01:19:37,275 --> 01:19:39,995\ntracking exactly how that employee\nis operating in your environment.\n\n1728\n01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:44,690\nAnd the last one I have is this\nteam member performance report.\n\n1729\n01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,570\nYou'll notice overlap between these\ndocuments, you're not gonna use them all.\n\n1730\n01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,990\nYou're gonna pick which one is right for\nyour environment.\n\n1731\n01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,720\nThis one just has a simple audit,\na progress report.\n\n1732\n01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,796\nHow well are they doing in\na particular area audited.\n\n1733\n01:19:54,796 --> 01:19:57,050\nThat's why this is real general,\narea audited.\n\n1734\n01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:59,810\nWe have to tell them what it\nis that we're monitoring And\n\n1735\n01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:02,993\nthen areas where they excelled,\nareas where they can improve.\n\n1736\n01:20:02,993 --> 01:20:06,649\nIf there's areas where they can improve,\nany deficiencies or defects, and\n\n1737\n01:20:06,649 --> 01:20:08,350\nthen our comments, right.\n\n1738\n01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:11,910\nSo, this type of paperwork is how we're\ngoing to track this progress, and\n\n1739\n01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:15,210\non a large project team, where you\nmight have hundreds of people, or\n\n1740\n01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,950\nthousands of people,\nyou can't do it all by yourself.\n\n1741\n01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:21,800\nYou can other people who are completing\nthis data and turning it in to you.\n\n1742\n01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,850\nWhich is why in this project or\n\n1743\n01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:29,670\nin this process group, right here,\nwe'll see those are inputs.\n\n1744\n01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:32,850\nThe issue log, the work performance\nreports, the team performance assessment.\n\n1745\n01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:38,120\nAll of that is an input into\nmanage the project team.\n\n1746\n01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:43,590\nSo we take all that data, and we use that\nfor our project performance appraisal.\n\n1747\n01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:44,830\nSo now we've seen several, right?\n\n1748\n01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:49,920\nWe saw team member performance appraisal,\nwe've seen team performance appraisal,\n\n1749\n01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,230\nand now, project performance.\n\n1750\n01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:53,780\nHow is our project performing?\n\n1751\n01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:56,430\nIs it running like a well oiled machine,\nnice and smooth,\n\n1752\n01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:59,770\nthings are going great or\nam I hitting a lot of bumps?\n\n1753\n01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:02,460\nAm I hitting a lot of issues now\nthat are burning up time and\n\n1754\n01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,890\nresources that may make it more difficult\nfor me to be successful down the road.\n\n1755\n01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:09,070\nSo, that is important.\n\n1756\n01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,550\nWe want to make sure that\nwe pay attention to that.\n\n1757\n01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:12,030\nThat we keep on top of it.\n\n1758\n01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:14,600\nConflict Management is going\nto be a big piece of that.\n\n1759\n01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:18,600\nWhen we have conflict, conflict is such\nan aggressive word, I don't mean like one\n\n1760\n01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,010\nemployee punches another in the face, i\njust mean, you've got a decision to make.\n\n1761\n01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,370\nAnytime you have a decision,\nthere is a conflict.\n\n1762\n01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:28,290\nIf you have two possible outcomes, and\npeople are choosing different ones,\n\n1763\n01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:29,240\nyou've got conflict.\n\n1764\n01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:32,840\nIt may be a very amicable,\nfriendly, peaceful conflict, but\n\n1765\n01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,760\nit's still a conflict, nonetheless.\n\n1766\n01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,530\nAs a Project Manager,\nwe need to resolve it.\n\n1767\n01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:40,350\nWe come up with a solution that works for\neveryone and\n\n1768\n01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,000\nwe move forward,\nI shouldn't say it that way.\n\n1769\n01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,650\nThat's a trap, right?\n\n1770\n01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:46,000\nThere's never a solution that works for\neveryone, right?\n\n1771\n01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,060\nSo we need to choose the solution\nthat's best for our project, right?\n\n1772\n01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:55,890\nWhich one ensures the highest degree\nof success and gets us moving forward.\n\n1773\n01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:58,750\nSometimes that might not be\nthe best decision for everyone.\n\n1774\n01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,860\nIn fact,\nit might not even be the best decision for\n\n1775\n01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:04,230\na majority,\nyou might have to step in and override.\n\n1776\n01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:07,950\nAnd then we talked about that earlier,\nprojects can be run as a democracy or\n\n1777\n01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:13,080\nas a dictatorship or whatever, and often\ntimes you have to make that decision.\n\n1778\n01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:16,480\nBut if a conflict arises,\n\n1779\n01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,640\nPMI has a specific set of ways\nthat they can be handled.\n\n1780\n01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,040\nLet me bring up Ronnie's notes.\n\n1781\n01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,170\nHere we go.\n\n1782\n01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:25,740\nThe five techniques for\nresolving a conflict.\n\n1783\n01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:30,620\nIf we've got a conflict,\nwe can choose any of these five.\n\n1784\n01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:32,820\nMost of them are wrong, and\nyou don't want to do them.\n\n1785\n01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:36,020\nSo they're really here as\nan example of what not to do.\n\n1786\n01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:38,980\nBut there's at least one that's\nthe good way to do it and\n\n1787\n01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,220\nwhat we need to know for the exam.\n\n1788\n01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,500\nSo you want to be familiar with these, but\nlet's run through all of them, all right?\n\n1789\n01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,730\nThe first one is withdraw/avoid, right?\n\n1790\n01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:46,652\nWithdraw or avoid.\n\n1791\n01:22:48,161 --> 01:22:51,511\nYou may have an issue that's\ngoing on with the project, and\n\n1792\n01:22:51,511 --> 01:22:53,600\nyou come up with an idea to fix it.\n\n1793\n01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,060\nSo here's your idea, now,\nsomeone else has an idea on how to fix it.\n\n1794\n01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:00,570\nSo now you've got two different\nways on how to fix your project and\n\n1795\n01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:03,180\nget it back on track, and you gotta pick.\n\n1796\n01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:07,620\nWell, there's a conflict between the two\ndifferent solutions and one person,\n\n1797\n01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:10,590\nafter arguing long enough or whatever,\nfinally just says, you know what?\n\n1798\n01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:11,830\nForget it.\nWe'll go with your way.\n\n1799\n01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:12,710\nWhatever.\n\n1800\n01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:13,410\nRight?\n\n1801\n01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:16,020\nThey withdraw their recommendation.\n\n1802\n01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:18,720\nThey avoid the argument by just saying,\nforget it.\n\n1803\n01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,880\nI'm done.\nWe'll go your way.\n\n1804\n01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,920\nWhatever.\n\n1805\n01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,090\nWell, is that the problem solved?\n\n1806\n01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:24,280\nProblem solved, move on?\n\n1807\n01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,170\nWell the problem is solved in a way,\nright?\n\n1808\n01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:30,980\nBut now, you've got an employee who's no\nlonger gonna be in that performing phase.\n\n1809\n01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:34,820\nThey're no longer gonna be in tight mesh\nlock step with the rest of the team.\n\n1810\n01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:37,560\nThey're going to feel like they\nhad a perfectly good solution and\n\n1811\n01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,550\nwe didn't go that way.\n\n1812\n01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:41,450\nAnd we may find later on that their\nsolution was better, and then you get\n\n1813\n01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:45,730\nthe I told you so syndrome, right, which\nis really hard for people to overcome.\n\n1814\n01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:49,880\nSo when you see this, it's important that\nyou recognize it, because it's not you.\n\n1815\n01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:52,210\nThe project manager's not\nthe one that initiates this,\n\n1816\n01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:55,350\nit's usually the person who's\ninvolved in the argument, right?\n\n1817\n01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:59,270\nWhen you see somebody do withdrawing,\nrecognize that.\n\n1818\n01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:00,800\nRecognize that that's a problem,\n\n1819\n01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,100\nDon't say, oh thank goodness now I don't\nhave to worry about it let's move on.\n\n1820\n01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,950\nBecause it's easy to do that,\nas a PM you can do that.\n\n1821\n01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:10,900\nBut your team is wounded, right?\n\n1822\n01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,720\nAnd you need to get it healthy again.\n\n1823\n01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,750\nSo, you need to recognize that that\nwound happened and stop it and\n\n1824\n01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:19,340\nsay wait a minute, wait, don't take\nyour idea back, it's a good idea.\n\n1825\n01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:23,150\nMaybe you have an alpha personality,\nyou're steam rolling the other person,\n\n1826\n01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:24,720\nthe other person says, forget it.\n\n1827\n01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,930\nStep in and champion that person.\n\n1828\n01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,200\nSay, no, wait, that's a great idea.\n\n1829\n01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,560\nLet's look at these on the merits.\n\n1830\n01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,930\nLet's do the scorecard.\n\n1831\n01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:35,306\nLet's do an anonymous decision cycle like\na Delphi, let's do something to make sure\n\n1832\n01:24:35,306 --> 01:24:38,430\nthat that's on the table and\nthen we'll make the decision.\n\n1833\n01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:41,578\nAnd we may ultimately not choose their\nway, but at least now we know why, right,\n\n1834\n01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:42,331\nwe had a document.\n\n1835\n01:24:42,331 --> 01:24:45,120\nThey could say all right,\nI had my idea, it was a good idea, but\n\n1836\n01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,031\nwe went with the other guy's idea\nbecause it was better, right?\n\n1837\n01:24:48,031 --> 01:24:50,410\nAnd they understand that.\n\n1838\n01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:53,540\nBut if you just let them withdraw,\nthey don't know that.\n\n1839\n01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:55,790\nAnd in their mind,\nthey had the right idea, and\n\n1840\n01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:59,210\nin their mind they were wrong by the\nproject, by not moving forward with it.\n\n1841\n01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:05,340\nThe other one is smooth/accommodate.\n\n1842\n01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:11,310\nWith this one, you have the conflict,\nyou need to pick a solution.\n\n1843\n01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:16,930\nSo what you do is you pick a solution, and\nthen for the people who didn't succeed,\n\n1844\n01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:21,830\nyou start to highlight the part of\nthe solution that were in common, right?\n\n1845\n01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:22,950\nJust the good parts.\n\n1846\n01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:26,660\nYou highlight the good, and\nkinda push the bad under the rug.\n\n1847\n01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:29,920\nAnd say look, I know it's not your\nsolution, but this one's pretty similar.\n\n1848\n01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,771\nAnd yeah, it's got a lot of stuff\nin common with what you had, and so\n\n1849\n01:25:32,771 --> 01:25:35,289\nit's gonna work out well,\nlet's go this way, all right?\n\n1850\n01:25:35,289 --> 01:25:38,000\nWhat you're doing when you do\nsmoothing and accommodating,\n\n1851\n01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,557\nis you're not actually resolving the\nproblem, you're just trying to hide it.\n\n1852\n01:25:41,557 --> 01:25:47,354\nAnd that's a really big problem\nbecause when you hide the problem,\n\n1853\n01:25:47,354 --> 01:25:49,093\nit's still there.\n\n1854\n01:25:49,093 --> 01:25:50,812\nAnd sure it might go away for\na month or two but\n\n1855\n01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,309\nthen it's gonna pop back up later on.\n\n1856\n01:25:52,309 --> 01:25:55,176\nAnd you're gonna say man,\nwe went with that EMC san,\n\n1857\n01:25:55,176 --> 01:25:57,788\nI really thought we should\ngo with the HP san, and\n\n1858\n01:25:57,788 --> 01:26:02,154\nI know they had some common features and\nstuff but man, this problem stinks now.\n\n1859\n01:26:02,154 --> 01:26:03,460\nI hate it!\n\n1860\n01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,692\nIf we had only gone HP, right?\nEven though we made that decision\n\n1861\n01:26:05,692 --> 01:26:09,453\ntwo months, that kind of thing start\nto creep up and cause problems.\n\n1862\n01:26:09,453 --> 01:26:12,504\nThat's smooth and accomodating, and also\nanother one that you don't want to do.\n\n1863\n01:26:12,504 --> 01:26:16,344\n>> A lot of times a smoothing and\naccommodating for us really does come down\n\n1864\n01:26:16,344 --> 01:26:20,860\nto not very effective, they are ready\nto champion their bigger position.\n\n1865\n01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:24,300\nBut because I feel like that it would\nbe better harmony for the team and\n\n1866\n01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:28,180\nthen that compromise the overall project\ndeliverable that we might have instead.\n\n1867\n01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:32,640\nThat's why you go, oh, no,\nthat's exactly what I would rather do.\n\n1868\n01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:36,430\nYou may want that because it does provide\nharmony, but it really doesn't provide\n\n1869\n01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:39,200\nthe overall project deliverable so,\nlet's understand that, too.\n\n1870\n01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,070\n>> The next one is compromise/reconcile.\n\n1871\n01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:43,760\nSo no this is one you hear a lot.\n\n1872\n01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:46,182\nThis is where there's a conflict.\n\n1873\n01:26:46,182 --> 01:26:51,036\nYou have two parties that are in\ndisagreement, and you mediate,\n\n1874\n01:26:51,036 --> 01:26:54,030\nyou step in and\nyou get them both to compromise.\n\n1875\n01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:58,030\nTo come up with a single solution\nthat they're both happy with, right?\n\n1876\n01:26:58,030 --> 01:26:59,310\nAnd it's not even about happiness,\n\n1877\n01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:01,450\nthe single solution that\nthey both can agree upon.\n\n1878\n01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:06,300\nNow, on a positive side, you look at\nthis like, hey, I'm a great conflict\n\n1879\n01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:10,440\nresolution person, I got these both\nto agree on like terms, all right?\n\n1880\n01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,240\nHere's the problem with compromise.\n\n1881\n01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:17,080\nIn a normal argument there's a winner and\na loser, and the winner is happy,\n\n1882\n01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:20,880\nthey got what they want, and the loser is\nunhappy they didn't get what they want.\n\n1883\n01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,350\nIn a compromise,\nthere is no winner, right?\n\n1884\n01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:27,060\nNo one team got what they wanted.\n\n1885\n01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,550\nSo, in a compromise everyone's a loser.\n\n1886\n01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:33,750\nNow the project as a whole may be a winner\ncuz now you're moving forward, right?\n\n1887\n01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:37,463\nBut, the team members themselves\nwill not feel like they won.\n\n1888\n01:27:37,463 --> 01:27:40,080\nThey'll feel like we created a patchwork,\n\n1889\n01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,980\na hodgepodge of these\ntwo different solutions,\n\n1890\n01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:48,170\ntaking what worked and not really getting\nwhat was best about the two solutions.\n\n1891\n01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:53,565\nIt's hard to do a compromise where people\nfeel like it was the best decision.\n\n1892\n01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:58,264\nCompromises, while they appear\nattractive to us as a easy way to solve\n\n1893\n01:27:58,264 --> 01:28:02,422\na problem Really just kind of\ncreates that hidden animosity.\n\n1894\n01:28:02,422 --> 01:28:06,310\nSo a compromise, well you hear a lot\nof people say it's perfectly fine,\n\n1895\n01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:08,160\nis not a solution you want.\n\n1896\n01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,040\n>> Yeah.\nThe problem also with a compromise,\n\n1897\n01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,310\nis that once you make it\nwith one decision, right,\n\n1898\n01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:15,190\nfor your project,\nthe next one becomes easier.\n\n1899\n01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:17,750\nOkay, and\nthen the following becomes even easier.\n\n1900\n01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:18,410\nAnd all of a sudden,\n\n1901\n01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:22,420\nonce again now are overall quality of\nour deliverable is not where we want it.\n\n1902\n01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:26,820\nOr our project is not exactly where we\nneed to be, because we've now conceded so\n\n1903\n01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,030\noften, and we've compromised so\n\n1904\n01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:32,250\noften, we're really not even satisfied\nwith pushing for with the project.\n\n1905\n01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:32,860\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1906\n01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,640\nAnd it's gotta lot of downstream problems.\n\n1907\n01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:38,294\nThe next one is Force/direct.\n\n1908\n01:28:38,294 --> 01:28:39,190\nAll right.\n\n1909\n01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:40,880\nThis is where there's a conflict.\n\n1910\n01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,280\nYou have two parties in disagreement, and\nyou step in as the project manager and\n\n1911\n01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,070\nyou say all right, here's how it is.\n\n1912\n01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,960\nRight?\n\n1913\n01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,140\nNo more talking,\nno more arguments, this is it.\n\n1914\n01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:50,920\nThis is the decision we're making.\n\n1915\n01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,210\nWe're moving forward.\n\n1916\n01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:53,090\nAll right?\n\n1917\n01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:56,290\nOn a positive side,\nit solves the problem, doesn't it?\n\n1918\n01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:57,630\nRight?\nAnd gets the project moving in\n\n1919\n01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:59,090\nthe shortest amount of time.\n\n1920\n01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:03,860\nOn a negative side, the winners, the\npeople who's side you pick, they're fine.\n\n1921\n01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:05,760\nBut the other team is gonna feel slighted.\n\n1922\n01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,190\nYou didn't even bother to\nlisten to their argument.\n\n1923\n01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:11,280\nYou just cast it down and\nmoved on forward.\n\n1924\n01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:11,860\nRight?\n\n1925\n01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:13,800\nSo while it might be what's best for\n\n1926\n01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,060\nthe project, it is gonna seed\nsome disharmony amongst the team.\n\n1927\n01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,750\nSo there we have a problem also, right,\n\n1928\n01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:22,590\nthat we basically are slighting\nat least part of our team.\n\n1929\n01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:26,320\nYeah, and I hate to bring this up\nagain but again down the line right?\n\n1930\n01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:31,340\nOnce you use that human resource capital,\nthat idea of the good interpersonal\n\n1931\n01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:34,210\ncapital that you made with the team and\nnow you do this.\n\n1932\n01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:37,570\nYou've used up all that, and then next\ntime when it comes along and you do that,\n\n1933\n01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:41,560\nit becomes much more difficult to enforce\nwhat you feel like needs to be enforced,\n\n1934\n01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,030\nbecause then people really\nhave that built up wall now.\n\n1935\n01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:46,780\nThey think that you're\ngoing to treat them fairly.\n\n1936\n01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:51,970\nSo far we've gone through four solutions\nand they've all been pretty bad, right?\n\n1937\n01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:55,500\nAnd you guys, you're probably thinking\nabout past experiences right now, and\n\n1938\n01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,170\nhow you view this some of these four.\n\n1939\n01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:58,750\nWell, its the fifth one.\n\n1940\n01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:02,830\nThat's the one we want to use,\nwhich is collaborate/problem solve.\n\n1941\n01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:05,520\nThat means, collaborate.\n\n1942\n01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,616\nTalk, exchange of information,\nlearn about both sides.\n\n1943\n01:30:08,616 --> 01:30:11,250\nAnd then problem solve.\n\n1944\n01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:12,940\nFigure out which one is the best.\n\n1945\n01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:15,690\nAnd don't just like think about it,\nand say yeah, I like that one.\n\n1946\n01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:16,730\nIt sounds better.\n\n1947\n01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:17,470\nQuantify it.\n\n1948\n01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:18,000\nPut it together.\n\n1949\n01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,620\nCreate scorecards.\n\n1950\n01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,680\nTake a vote.\n\n1951\n01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,010\nDo the Delphi technique.\n\n1952\n01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:22,630\nDo whatever.\n\n1953\n01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:25,060\nWe talked about all of\nthose earlier in the show.\n\n1954\n01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:29,350\nFigure out which method is the best\nwith a quantifiable means, right?\n\n1955\n01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:33,590\nSo that when you pick the winning team,\nyou know it's the right one, because it\n\n1956\n01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:37,130\ngot the best scores with the information\nyou had, it was the best decision.\n\n1957\n01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:41,030\nAnd for the team that lost, the people who\nare backing the wrong idea, they know why.\n\n1958\n01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:43,410\nThey can look at the scorecard and\nthey can say, well all right,\n\n1959\n01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:47,590\nI can see why they chose to go that\nway because of these various things.\n\n1960\n01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:48,630\nWe understand that.\n\n1961\n01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:51,980\nWe like this other idea, but\nwe understand why we're going this way.\n\n1962\n01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:55,960\nThat moment of creating understanding,\nthat moment of closure for people,\n\n1963\n01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,210\nthat's important.\n\n1964\n01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:00,840\nBecause now they don't feel like\nwe went with the wrong idea,\n\n1965\n01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,480\nbecause we didn't have enough information.\n\n1966\n01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,520\nWe took the time to make the right call.\n\n1967\n01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,570\nAnd you should be doing that anyway.\n\n1968\n01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:08,830\nAny time you use your\ndecision making techniques,\n\n1969\n01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,340\nthis should be happening, right?\n\n1970\n01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,920\nSo you take a deep breath, you gather\nthe information from the people,\n\n1971\n01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,090\nyou hear both sides, you create\nyour scorecards, you quantify it,\n\n1972\n01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:19,170\nand you come up with a solution.\n\n1973\n01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:22,505\nPeople don't have to agree with it, but\nthey can understand why you made it,\n\n1974\n01:31:22,505 --> 01:31:24,305\nand you can get the project\nmoving forward.\n\n1975\n01:31:24,305 --> 01:31:28,245\nSo that's the way that we wanna go.\n\n1976\n01:31:28,245 --> 01:31:31,035\nAll right, now there is one that\nthey don't really mention in here,\n\n1977\n01:31:31,035 --> 01:31:34,995\nwhich is the postpone,\nwhere you just delay.\n\n1978\n01:31:34,995 --> 01:31:36,575\nWhen there is a problem,\n\n1979\n01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:40,025\nas a project manager,\nyou really need to be very confrontive.\n\n1980\n01:31:40,025 --> 01:31:42,445\nAll right, when there's\na problem that needs a decision,\n\n1981\n01:31:42,445 --> 01:31:44,130\nyou need to step in and do it.\n\n1982\n01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:48,090\nThe longer you delay, the worse it's gonna\nget, the harder it's gonna be to resolve.\n\n1983\n01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:51,410\nSo, if you're one of those that says, I'm\njust gonna let it kind of work itself out.\n\n1984\n01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:52,630\nWell, that's bad.\n\n1985\n01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:55,390\nBecause when it works itself out, it'll\nwork out using one of those four other\n\n1986\n01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,790\nmethods, and that's not what you want.\n\n1987\n01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:59,490\nSo you need to get in there and\nconfront the issue.\n\n1988\n01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:01,260\nThe sooner the better.\n\n1989\n01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:04,850\nIf you recognize somebody's performance\nis dropping, don't just wait and\n\n1990\n01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:05,988\nsee if they pick back up.\n\n1991\n01:32:05,988 --> 01:32:06,850\nThey might, right?\n\n1992\n01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:08,090\nBut in the meantime,\n\n1993\n01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:10,920\nyou're wasting valuable time\nwhile they're underperforming.\n\n1994\n01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,610\nStep in, recognize it right away;\nfind out what the problem is.\n\n1995\n01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:15,160\nThere could be something very serious.\n\n1996\n01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:19,290\nMaybe they had a relative pass away.\n\n1997\n01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:21,760\nAnd so they're, they're obviously not\ngoing to be very happy about that, and\n\n1998\n01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,240\nit's going to affect their\nworkplace performance.\n\n1999\n01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,620\nSo if you know that,\nyou can say you know what?\n\n2000\n01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,570\nWhy don't you take a week off?\n\n2001\n01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:30,430\nTake a week off, we'll bring somebody else\nin, and the you can come back, you know,\n\n2002\n01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:32,930\ntake some time to collect yourself.\n\n2003\n01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:36,110\nThat way you can bring somebody else\nin and cover them for that week.\n\n2004\n01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:39,620\nIf you just wait for them to pick back up\na week later, yeah they'll pick back up.\n\n2005\n01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,910\nBut you just gotta week\nof poor performance.\n\n2006\n01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:43,440\nYour project has been affected.\n\n2007\n01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,930\nYou want to take care of your people, but\n\n2008\n01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:46,530\nyou've got to take care of your project,\ntoo.\n\n2009\n01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:48,430\nSo, you've gotta find\nthat healthy solution.\n\n2010\n01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:52,140\nAll right.\n\n2011\n01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:54,050\nThe other thing is just\ninterpersonal skills.\n\n2012\n01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:55,060\nRight?\nThat's the other tool and\n\n2013\n01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:56,750\ntechnique we have here.\n\n2014\n01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:59,170\nAnd it really influences everything\nthat we've talked about so far.\n\n2015\n01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:01,080\nYou've got to be able to\ncommunicate to people,\n\n2016\n01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:04,530\nexchange information to find\nout you know about the issues,\n\n2017\n01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:08,230\nabout the problems, how we make those\ndecisions, how we get informed.\n\n2018\n01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:10,950\nThe end result of this is usually\ngonna be a change request.\n\n2019\n01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:12,990\nRight?\nWe had to make a decision.\n\n2020\n01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:15,550\nIf we're making a decision\nduring the execution phase,\n\n2021\n01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:16,970\nthen it's something we didn't plan for.\n\n2022\n01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:18,980\nAll of our decisions\nshould already be made.\n\n2023\n01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:20,500\nSo if you're making\na decision at this point,\n\n2024\n01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,210\nwhatever you choose is gonna\nresult in a change request.\n\n2025\n01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:23,920\nAll right.\n\n2026\n01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,930\nHopefully it gets approved,\notherwise you're in bigger trouble.\n\n2027\n01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:29,480\nBut, it gets approved and\nthat becomes part of the project.\n\n2028\n01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:32,060\nSome of the other things,\nproject management plan updates.\n\n2029\n01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:34,460\nAs we update with the information\nthat we've gathered.\n\n2030\n01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:37,580\nProject document updates,\nspecifically the issue log, right?\n\n2031\n01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:40,020\nAny decision needs to get\nlogged in the issue log.\n\n2032\n01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:43,600\nEnterprise environmental factors and\norganizational process updates,\n\n2033\n01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:49,090\nthose are all things that we may need to\ndo as a result of the output of this one.\n\n2034\n01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,720\nAll right, but\nwhen we follow that procedure,\n\n2035\n01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,800\nwe should have a team that is performing,\noperating at their optimal.\n\n2036\n01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,160\nEven when a disagreement occurs,\nbecause we resolve it quickly,\n\n2037\n01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,760\nwe continue to move forward, and\nthe team understands what's going on.\n\n2038\n01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,180\nThat's really what's important here.\n\n2039\n01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:03,850\n>> Yeah.\n\n2040\n01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:07,510\nThis is where your leadership skills, and\nyour influence are really gonna shine\n\n2041\n01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:10,312\nin the overall project when\nyou start doing this, right?\n\n2042\n01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:13,180\nYour team will now start taking on\nsome of the characteristics that\n\n2043\n01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:17,040\nyou really do approve of, and\nthat you can actually use to influence and\n\n2044\n01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,650\nto benefit the entire project here.\n\n2045\n01:34:19,650 --> 01:34:22,680\nSo doing the management\npart of this project, or\n\n2046\n01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:27,500\nthe team building, is really kind of\nwhere you have your biggest thumbprint\n\n2047\n01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,140\nthat you will have in terms of\ngetting done what you want done.\n\n2048\n01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:33,690\nAnd so, do take the time to make sure you\ntake a look at this part of the process.\n\n2049\n01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:37,390\n>> All right.\nWell Ronnie, as far as the executing phase\n\n2050\n01:34:37,390 --> 01:34:41,490\ngoes, that pretty much wraps up the human\nresource management knowledge area.\n\n2051\n01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,880\nWe still have some more to\ntalk about with executing.\n\n2052\n01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,090\nWe still have managed communications,\nconduct procurements,\n\n2053\n01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:49,610\nmanaged stakeholder engagement.\n\n2054\n01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:52,770\nSo we still have a few more on executing,\nnot too much more though and\n\n2055\n01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:56,100\nyou'll see a lot of what we've talked\nabout in executing is pretty common sense.\n\n2056\n01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:59,500\nIt's controlling where we'll get the real\nwork, so this is a pretty good spot for\n\n2057\n01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:00,930\nus to stop and wrap up the show.\n\n2058\n01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,220\nYou got anything else to throw in, Ronnie?\n\n2059\n01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:03,200\n>> No, I do not.\n\n2060\n01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,240\n>> All right.\n\n2061\n01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:07,440\nLadies and gentlemen let me just\nremind you that if you ever have any\n\n2062\n01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,740\nquestions on this, be sure to use us.\n\n2063\n01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:12,660\nThat's what we're here for.\n\n2064\n01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:15,000\nLive

to\n\n3\n00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:41,871\nanother episode of IT Pro TV I'm your host\nDon Pezet backing you is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:42,730\nHow's it going Ronnie.\n\n5\n00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,930\n>> I am disappointed.\n\n6\n00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,720\nLast night the Emmy awards happened and\nwe did not receive any nomination for\n\n7\n00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,970\nbest comedy at all.\n\n8\n00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,880\n>> Not even a nomination?\n\n9\n00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,693\n>> Not even a nomination and\nso I'm disappointed.\n\n10\n00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:54,521\n>> Well you know I'm holding out for\nthe viewer's choice awards.\n\n11\n00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,120\n>> Yes.\n\n12\n00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,150\n>> Or cable ace?\n\n13\n00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,030\nCable ace is a cost issue.\n\n14\n00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,650\n>> Oh, we'll have to work something out.\n\n15\n00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,590\n>> We'll get Anna Ward\none day it'll happen.\n\n16\n00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,210\n>> That's right.\n\n17\n00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,590\n>> So until then,\nlet's keep up our broadcasting excellence,\n\n18\n00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,810\ninto the world of project management.\n\n19\n00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,790\nSo we're diving right back into the\nexecuting process group, you'll remember\n\n20\n00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,610\nwe covered that in the last episode,\nand we started moving through it.\n\n21\n00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,860\nThis is one of the lighter topics\nbecause as a project manager,\n\n22\n00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,750\nwe're not typically the ones\ndoing the executing.\n\n23\n00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,780\nSo, really what it boils down to is\npeople taking what we did in our\n\n24\n00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,600\nplanning phase and applying it.\n\n25\n00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,280\nAnd we just make sure they do it.\n\n26\n00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,019\nNow most of what we do is happening\nin the monitoring phase but\n\n27\n00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:36,691\nwe do still have a few more processes here\nin executing that we need to talk about.\n\n28\n00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:37,339\nAll right.\n\n29\n00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:40,870\nSo, let me just bring up my handy PIN\nblock here and we'll take a look at those.\n\n30\n00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,540\nSo here we are in\nthe executing process group.\n\n31\n00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,630\nAnd we covered these other processes\nyesterday, so we developed our team and\n\n32\n00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,980\nall that good stuff.\n\n33\n00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,010\nNow we're ready to take a look\nat managing our communications,\n\n34\n00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,690\nconducting our procurements, and\nmanaging our stakeholder engagement.\n\n35\n00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,474\nAll right, a lot of these\nare centering around paperwork, right?\n\n36\n00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,124\n>> That does, yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:02,430\nUnfortunately this is\nthe bureaucratic action of a project.\n\n38\n00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,520\nVery important but kind of, not menial,\njust mundane and redundant.\n\n39\n00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,640\n>> Yeah, this is by far the process for\n\n40\n00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,040\nus, that it requires us to be on the ball,\nevery time.\n\n41\n00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,210\nSo the good communications that we have\nhere, that's carried throughout the very\n\n42\n00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,660\ntime we begin the planning,\nall the way through into the completion.\n\n43\n00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,240\nSo, this part of the process,\nwhile not exciting, is very important,\n\n44\n00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,990\nbut it is so pervasive that you kind of\njust bypass and go, we don't really care,\n\n45\n00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,240\ncuz we're already good at it.\n\n46\n00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,180\nBut it is something we do focus in on,\nbecause you're gonna see it on the PMP.\n\n47\n00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,100\n>> All right, so\nlet's talk about managing communications.\n\n48\n00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,340\nLet me bring up that process.\n\n49\n00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,390\nHere we go.\n\n50\n00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,980\nSo when it comes to managing\ncommunications, what we're talking about\n\n51\n00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,280\nis in the planning phase we came\nup with a communications plan.\n\n52\n00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,240\nNow we need to make sure that it happens,\nthat it's being followed.\n\n53\n00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,310\nWe already know what stakeholders\nneed to be communicated with.\n\n54\n00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,240\nWe already know what ways they\nwant us to communicate with them.\n\n55\n00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,280\nThat was all set forth right\nhere in the communications plan.\n\n56\n00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,430\nNow, what are we gonna\ncommunicate to them?\n\n57\n00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,810\nWell, then that was already communicated,\ntoo, right?\n\n58\n00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,910\nThese are gonna be things like, progress\nreports, status updates, change tickets,\n\n59\n00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,020\nand information like that.\n\n60\n00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,890\nThings that impact the project.\n\n61\n00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,310\nMaybe it's something very,\nvery simple like just a status.\n\n62\n00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,830\nLike hey, we're moving along,\nthings are going great.\n\n63\n00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,980\nOr maybe it's something very,\nvery detailed.\n\n64\n00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,960\nHere's the work that was\ncompleted yesterday.\n\n65\n00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,430\nHere's a summary of the activities and\nevents.\n\n66\n00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,010\nThose are the things that we provide.\n\n67\n00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,560\nSo as an input, the main input that we\nget here is the Work Performance Reports.\n\n68\n00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,270\nThat's usually the status that we are\ngoing to be presenting to these people.\n\n69\n00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,200\nAnd then our enterprise Environmental\nFactors and Organizational Process Assets,\n\n70\n00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,540\nwhich encompass all the different means\nof communications, the forms we use,\n\n71\n00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,230\nthe type of data we relay.\n\n72\n00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,500\nAll defined by our company.\n\n73\n00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,950\n>> Yeah, and\nthat work performance report for us,\n\n74\n00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,150\nright, this is where we\nagain get whether or not\n\n75\n00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,840\nthe information coming in form those work\npackages are actually on target or not.\n\n76\n00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,920\nAnd so that way we can adjust our\ncommunications plans to be actually to\n\n77\n00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,160\nbe able to say whether we\nneed something done faster,\n\n78\n00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,340\nor we can slow down on something her.\n\n79\n00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,910\nAnd so it really is key that we take a\nlook at that before Before we communicate.\n\n80\n00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,710\nIt's always easy to have assumptions here.\n\n81\n00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,300\nBut those performance reports are how we\nknow that we're actually gonna be saying\n\n82\n00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,790\nthe right things at the right time.\n\n83\n00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,650\nYeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n84\n00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,370\nSo, we're going to collect that data,\nand we're going to interpret it.\n\n85\n00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,450\nBecause, you know,\na lot of times you get that data and\n\n86\n00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,430\nit doesn't necessarily reflect\nexactly what's going on.\n\n87\n00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,370\nWe've got to interpret it in\nthe context of our project.\n\n88\n00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,890\nAnd then we turn that into\nthe information we relay to other people.\n\n89\n00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,180\nThose are our project communications.\n\n90\n00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,810\nThat's what we're sending\nout to other people.\n\n91\n00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,610\nNow to interpret the data we've got\na number of different things that we use.\n\n92\n00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,830\nWe put it into our various charts and\ngraphs and so forth, and\n\n93\n00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,570\nthen we send it along.\n\n94\n00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,600\nSo let's take a look at some\nof these tools and techniques,\n\n95\n00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,310\nthere's actually quite a few of them.\n\n96\n00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,190\nThey're broken out for\nthis particular process.\n\n97\n00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,690\nSome of them are really straightforward\nlike communication technology.\n\n98\n00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,300\nWhat is that?\n\n99\n00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,090\nWell, it's whatever you use to\ncommunicate, do you use telephone calls?\n\n100\n00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,340\nDo you have phone conversations?\n\n101\n00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,520\nDo you do web meetings,\nlike through WebEx?\n\n102\n00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,860\nOr GoToMeeting, do you do faxes?\n\n103\n00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,940\nEmails?\n\n104\n00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,780\nPostal letter?\n\n105\n00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,870\nIn person meetings, whatever it\nis that you use to communicate,\n\n106\n00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,740\nthat's your communication technology,\nright?\n\n107\n00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,920\nSo, that's a tool of communication,\nwe use that.\n\n108\n00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,290\nAnd, then, communication models, right?\n\n109\n00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,720\nHow do we communicate it out?\n\n110\n00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,830\nWell, this might be\na direct communication.\n\n111\n00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,470\nI want to tell Ronnie something so\nI tell him directly.\n\n112\n00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,820\nOr if I want to tell the whole company,\nmaybe I want to tell everybody here at\n\n113\n00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,250\nEdutainment Live, I want to tell all the\nemployees here that somethings going on.\n\n114\n00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,510\nSo I can call an all hands meeting,\nI can get everybody together but\n\n115\n00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,330\nthat might not be realistic,\nespecially if you have virtual teams.\n\n116\n00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,280\nSo what we might want to do instead\nis do something like a phone tree or\n\n117\n00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,750\na communications tree, right?\n\n118\n00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,000\nWhere I talk to two people and those\ntwo people talk to two people each, so\n\n119\n00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,520\nthat reaches out to four or\nwhatever and it starts expanding.\n\n120\n00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,970\nAnd that way, nobody's having to\ncall more than two people, but\n\n121\n00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,410\nthe entire company gets\nnotified pretty quickly.\n\n122\n00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,710\nThat is a communication model also.\n\n123\n00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,346\nIt's whatever you've designed to\nwork inside of your organization.\n\n124\n00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:02,417\nThat's kind of like a pyramid\nscheme with communications.\n\n125\n00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:07,440\n[LAUGH] So the method, it's up to you and\nthere's a ton of different ones.\n\n126\n00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,260\nIn the PMBOK they list a bunch of them.\n\n127\n00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,300\nYou can see them on the screen here.\n\n128\n00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,730\nHard copy documents like letters,\n\n129\n00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,560\ndigital stuff like email,\nelectronic project management tools.\n\n130\n00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,040\nI didn't mention that one.\n\n131\n00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,050\nIf we have something like\nMicrosoft Project Server, and\n\n132\n00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,720\nemployees are logging into\nthat to register their time,\n\n133\n00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,880\nto post their status updates, well,\nthat's how they're communicating with you.\n\n134\n00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,510\nAnd then you can communicate\nback again with reports and\n\n135\n00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,130\nother information via that same PMIS.\n\n136\n00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,810\nSo you may or may not have that.\n\n137\n00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,180\nAll right.\n\n138\n00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,240\nNow, the majority of what we're gonna be\ncommunicating is performance reports, and\n\n139\n00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,440\nperformance reports, they make up, or\n\n140\n00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,560\nthey're built up of a lot\nof different components.\n\n141\n00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,920\nThe main one that we think\nof is this right here.\n\n142\n00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,800\nAnalysis of past performance.\n\n143\n00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,300\nRight?\n\n144\n00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,370\nIf I send you a status report today,\nit's likely gonna have the last week or\n\n145\n00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,780\nlast month of activity and\nshow where we're at on our plan,\n\n146\n00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,430\non our schedule,\non our budget, on our scope.\n\n147\n00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,370\nHow many requirements have\nwe met of our project.\n\n148\n00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,450\nThese are things that people wanna know.\n\n149\n00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,750\nThey wanna know where we're at right now.\n\n150\n00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,630\nSo most of that is past performance.\n\n151\n00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,510\nBut to be truly useful,\nyou need to not just look at the past, but\n\n152\n00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,850\nlook at the future.\n\n153\n00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,680\nYou need to extrapolate that data and say,\nall right, based on what we've done so\n\n154\n00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,180\nfar, if we continue at this pace, in the\nfuture, we're gonna finish on schedule.\n\n155\n00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,720\nAll right.\n\n156\n00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,630\nSo, right now in the project I\nam three days ahead of schedule.\n\n157\n00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,480\nIf we continue on that pace, we're going\nto finish the project ahead of schedule.\n\n158\n00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,770\nIf I notice that each week, I'm getting a\nlittle further, and a little further, and\n\n159\n00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,390\na little further behind, then I know\nthat if we continue on that pace,\n\n160\n00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,420\nat the end of the project,\nwe're going to be behind schedule.\n\n161\n00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,770\nForecasting it forward\nshows people the affect.\n\n162\n00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,766\nIf you tell somebody yeah,\nwe're one day behind schedule.\n\n163\n00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,368\nThey might thing, well that's no big deal.\n\n164\n00:07:55,368 --> 00:07:55,994\nThat's just one day.\n\n165\n00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:56,517\nWho cares.\n\n166\n00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,800\nBut, if it means we missed\nour final ship date.\n\n167\n00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,450\nThat's a big deal, right?\n\n168\n00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,633\nWe missed our date, so that's important.\n\n169\n00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:06,279\nWe wanna forecast forward.\n\n170\n00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,059\nAll right, time and cost are the main ones\nthat we look at there, our budget and\n\n171\n00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:13,155\nour schedule, but\ndon't forget your scope and requirements,\n\n172\n00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:17,168\nthat if you haven't met some, the thing\nabout scope and requirements is it's hard\n\n173\n00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:21,150\nto say you're behind or ahead on those\nbecause you either meet them or you don't.\n\n174\n00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,174\nThere's no grey area.\n\n175\n00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:27,344\nSome of the other things that\nwe might include in there.\n\n176\n00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:28,439\nThings like risks.\n\n177\n00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,180\nAll of our risks, some of them we knew\nright ahead of time, we were able to\n\n178\n00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,790\npredict, but there's other ones that have\na lot of uncertainties surrounding them.\n\n179\n00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,730\nThe probabilities that are in\nthe middle range, things like that.\n\n180\n00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,570\nFor example, if we're doing a outdoor.\n\n181\n00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,130\nRock concert, right?\n\n182\n00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,340\nAnd we know there's\na chance it could rain.\n\n183\n00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,890\nBut we plan the project it\nmight be a year in advance.\n\n184\n00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,190\nSo we might not know what\nthe weather patterns are.\n\n185\n00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,280\nWe might have an idea of what\nthat weather season is like but\n\n186\n00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,010\nnot on that particular day.\n\n187\n00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,510\nAs we get closer to the actual event,\nweather predictions get more accurate.\n\n188\n00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,120\nAnd so we continue to push that\nout as forecast information,\n\n189\n00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,960\nactually a weather forecast, right?\n\n190\n00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,315\nSo saying now the odds\nare 20% chance of rain.\n\n191\n00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:08,820\nNow its 30% chance of rain.\n\n192\n00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,490\nNow its 15%,\n\n193\n00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,580\nright, communicating a lot\nof people can take action.\n\n194\n00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,530\nNow, when we talk about analysis\nof past performance, that normally\n\n195\n00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,580\nincludes work completed during the period,\nbut maybe not in great detail.\n\n196\n00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,320\nSo, they called us specifically here\nbecause they're saying you might wanna\n\n197\n00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,690\ngo into greater detail.\n\n198\n00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,610\nI gave an example,\nI think it was in the last show, where\n\n199\n00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,700\nwe were talking about how at ITProTV every\nmorning we do a little stand-up meeting.\n\n200\n00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,000\nAnd we talk about what we did yesterday\nand what we're going to do today, right?\n\n201\n00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,880\nJust communicate it\nthrough the organization.\n\n202\n00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,030\nThat is work completed during the period.\n\n203\n00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,780\nRight, we're saying what\ngot done yesterday?\n\n204\n00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,410\nWhat changes Right?\n\n205\n00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,500\nAnd what's gonna go on today?\n\n206\n00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,100\nSo work to be completed in\nthe next period, right?\n\n207\n00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,420\nThose are pretty useful things.\n\n208\n00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,140\nNow, this might not be something that\nyou want to communicate out to all\n\n209\n00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,840\nthe stakeholders.\n\n210\n00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,450\nMaybe they don't need to know the brass\ntacks of what work is being done, so\n\n211\n00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,790\nthis may be a component of\na different type of communication.\n\n212\n00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,540\nBut it is something that\nwe may want to communicate.\n\n213\n00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,160\n>> Yeah.\n\n214\n00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,902\nA lot of times we may see\nwhere we're not exactly sure\n\n215\n00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,581\nthe timeline of the completion\nof things here, but\n\n216\n00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:13,472\nwhat we can do again is actually\ntake a look and go here.\n\n217\n00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:17,658\nHere are the six things we did yesterday\nand here's what we're projecting to do\n\n218\n00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:21,778\ntoday in terms of what needs to be done by\nthe end of the day and it's very easy for\n\n219\n00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:24,528\nus to make a decision of\nwhether we need to go faster or\n\n220\n00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:27,110\nwhether we're actually on track here.\n\n221\n00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,330\nSometimes again that time period\nis kind of a bit pushed here so\n\n222\n00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,770\nif you know that in the next ten days,\n\n223\n00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,460\nhere's the nine things we need to\naccomplish, very easy like OK.\n\n224\n00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,760\nIf I'm not there in seven days,\n\n225\n00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,210\nI've only accomplished five of them,\nit's gonna be very difficult.\n\n226\n00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,400\nSo that's a nice little kinda gauge for\nus as well to go with to see that.\n\n227\n00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,270\n>> Yep, and summary of changes approved.\n\n228\n00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,790\nThat's pretty important, too.\n\n229\n00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,200\nIf you've done a change ticket,\nand it's been approved,\n\n230\n00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,090\nif we're gonna talk about change In,\nI think it's the next episode.\n\n231\n00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,430\nWhen you have an approved change,\n\n232\n00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,090\nit can be changing your schedule,\nit can be changing your budget.\n\n233\n00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,720\nIt can be changing your requirements.\n\n234\n00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,970\nEveryone needs to be aware of that.\n\n235\n00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,560\nYou don't want people acting under\nthe old date, or the old budget, or\n\n236\n00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,140\nthe old requirements when\nsomething has happened.\n\n237\n00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,220\nSo we need to make sure that gets\ncommunicated out very thoroughly.\n\n238\n00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,440\nAnd then we have our other relevant\ninformation which is to be\n\n239\n00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,320\nreviewed and discussed.\n\n240\n00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,110\nNow this is pretty all encompassing,\nthis is basically anything else.\n\n241\n00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,320\nAnything else you feel\nthe need to communicate,\n\n242\n00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,500\nmaybe reminding people\nabout holiday hours.\n\n243\n00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,190\nWe're coming up on,\nwhat holidays on Monday?\n\n244\n00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,430\n>> Labor Day.\n\n245\n00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,810\n>> So, here in the United States we have\nLabor Day coming up here in a few days.\n\n246\n00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,680\nAnd it's customary for\nmost companies to be closed on Labor Day.\n\n247\n00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,800\nIt's kind of a funny holiday\nif you're not in the US.\n\n248\n00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,465\nIt's a holiday celebrating\nthe average worker.\n\n249\n00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:47,400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, what you'll find is that,\n\n250\n00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,500\nbanks and white collar employees that,\nthey take the day off, but\n\n251\n00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,050\nthen the blue collar employees that are\nsupposed to be celebrating, most of them\n\n252\n00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,850\nare open and working so you just never\nknow what your hours are gonna be like,\n\n253\n00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,130\nso we might have to communicate that.\n\n254\n00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,200\nThey may be communications\nof a more simple basis,\n\n255\n00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,100\nthings like sick time, somebody's out\nsick and they're gonna be replaced.\n\n256\n00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,670\nWe want to communicate that.\n\n257\n00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,790\nIt may be It may be celebratory things\nlike hey congratulate this team\n\n258\n00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,140\ncause they just hit their new milestone.\n\n259\n00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,790\nOr congratulate so and so,\n\n260\n00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,400\nthey just had a new baby right\nyou know that kind of stuff.\n\n261\n00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,920\nWhatever is relevant now you don't want\nto bog people down with irrelevant stuff.\n\n262\n00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,790\nRight, because the more fluff, the more\ngarbage you put in to these reports,\n\n263\n00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,180\nthe less likely people\nwill be to read them.\n\n264\n00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,180\nSo you want to be sure you convey\njust the information necessary.\n\n265\n00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,610\nSo that people aren't overwhelmed.\n\n266\n00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,710\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's a great point.\n\n267\n00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,420\nSometimes we get so\nmuch information, it's hard for\n\n268\n00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,770\nsomebody to know what\ninformation to act on.\n\n269\n00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,300\nSo in this point as a project manager,\nit's good for\n\n270\n00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,770\nus to have that direct communication\nHey Ronnie, this is where its gonna affect\n\n271\n00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,840\nyour team as you continue to move forward\nhere because of what just happened or\n\n272\n00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,600\nhere's six things we've got\nto remember to watch out for.\n\n273\n00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,410\nAnd that way were not going, okay well,\n\n274\n00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,910\nhe just talked to this whole team we have\nto remember that, so direct communication\n\n275\n00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,680\nmaybe the way that we actually get\nbetter performance out of this.\n\n276\n00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,820\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n277\n00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,575\nIt was a few months ago that there\nwas a happy birthday email here.\n\n278\n00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:04,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One employee sent an email to the whole\n\n279\n00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,250\ncompany saying, it's so and\nso's birthday, wish him a happy birthday.\n\n280\n00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,790\nSo, nice email.\n\n281\n00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,470\nPeople started Replying to it\nsaying happy birthday and so\n\n282\n00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,690\nI started ignoring the email.\n\n283\n00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,242\nI actually flagged it in my email\nclient and send it to the recycle bin.\n\n284\n00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:20,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Well cuz after you see that\n\n285\n00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,640\nemail ten times, what do you really care?\n\n286\n00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,190\nSo I started ignoring it.\n\n287\n00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,580\nWell, it turns out that after in these\nhappy birthday emails, after about five or\n\n288\n00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,970\nsix replies, there was some\nactual business being discussed.\n\n289\n00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,580\nAnd somebody said, oh by the way,\nwhat are you going on this and and so\n\n290\n00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,940\nit actually elevated into\na conversation that was important.\n\n291\n00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,690\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> But\nI didn't know that,\n\n292\n00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,030\nbecause it started off with this happy\nbirthday email, and I didn't care.\n\n293\n00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,734\n>> Yeah.\n>> I wished the person a happy birthday.\n\n294\n00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:46,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not heartless,\n\n295\n00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,050\nbut I just didn't care about the emails.\n\n296\n00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,160\nSo that led to this communication\nbeing lost for me, and\n\n297\n00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,560\nit was something I was supposed to know\nabout, which, of course, I didn't.\n\n298\n00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,980\nSo that's something that can happen, and\n\n299\n00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,570\nthe way we prevent that is by\ndoing proper communication.\n\n300\n00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,800\nYou shouldn't be communicating important\nstuff with a happy birthday email, right?\n\n301\n00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,350\nYou know, so tacking a happy birthday onto\nthe end of a progress report is one thing,\n\n302\n00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,940\ntacking a progress report onto a happy\nbirthday is a different thing, so\n\n303\n00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,400\nmake sure you've got your priorities\nstraight with your communications and\n\n304\n00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,396\ndon't try and connect to me on LinkedIn,\nthat's the other thing.\n\n305\n00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:19,704\nWay is not to communicate with Don.\n\n306\n00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:23,073\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> LinkedIn, Facebook, off.\n\n307\n00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:24,400\n[LAUGH] So\n\n308\n00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,750\nthose are some of the things we need to be\naware of with our communications process.\n\n309\n00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,290\nThere's a lot in there right?\n\n310\n00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,470\nHow we reach out to people and\ncommunicate that.\n\n311\n00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,990\nIt's really just putting into\neffect what we defined in our plan.\n\n312\n00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,610\nNow on the output side, when we start\nto provide this data to people Well,\n\n313\n00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,340\nwe're providing them typically with\nproject communications, right?\n\n314\n00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,400\nThe data that represents\nhow our project is doing.\n\n315\n00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,640\nAnd these might be pie charts,\nor Gantt charts.\n\n316\n00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,360\nIt might just be written emails.\n\n317\n00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,940\nIt's whatever you've decided\nto use inside of your project.\n\n318\n00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,900\nThe other outputs that we\nmight have are updates.\n\n319\n00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,790\nAs we communicate with people,\nwe find out information.\n\n320\n00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,650\nWe find Find out additional\nthings like status updates.\n\n321\n00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,990\nThey may say, you flagged this\nactivity as complete in this email but\n\n322\n00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,560\nit's actually not complete,\nwe still have all this to do.\n\n323\n00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,750\nThat might result in\nproject document updates or\n\n324\n00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,560\norganizational process asset updates.\n\n325\n00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,520\nThings like that.\n\n326\n00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,690\nAs you learn and\ndevelop from your communications.\n\n327\n00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,890\nSo that's pretty much the managed\ncommunications process.\n\n328\n00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,760\nThere's not all that much to it\nin the general scheme of things,\n\n329\n00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,320\njust applying your plan.\n\n330\n00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,350\nAnother one that we've got that's pretty\nstraightforward is conduct procurements.\n\n331\n00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:43,570\nIn the planning phase, we came up with\nour various contract types and things\n\n332\n00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,480\nthat we might wanna engage in with third\nparties to operate inside of our project.\n\n333\n00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,710\nWell, those are our procurements.\n\n334\n00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,276\nAnd when we get into the executing phase,\nnow it's time to execute these.\n\n335\n00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:57,560\nAnd when it comes to the executing phase,\nI know I mentioned in an earlier episode\n\n336\n00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,992\nthat sometimes The executing\nphase gets a little blurred.\n\n337\n00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,873\nThat the planning phase and\n\n338\n00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:06,710\nthe executing phase might actually\noverlap a little bit, all right?\n\n339\n00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,350\nAnd that sounds counterintuitive.\n\n340\n00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,690\nHow can I be planning and\nexecuting at the same time?\n\n341\n00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,530\nAnd I know we have things\nlike rolling wave planning,\n\n342\n00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,240\nwhere you're always planning even while\nexecuting for really long term projects.\n\n343\n00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,270\nBut even in a normal small project,\nif you're gonna be engaging in contracts,\n\n344\n00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,720\na lot of times we will initiate those\ncontracts while we're still planning\n\n345\n00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,330\nbecause the terms of the contract may\naffect things like our schedule, okay.\n\n346\n00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,810\nSo for example, let's say that\nwe're gonna be building a house.\n\n347\n00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,710\nAnd I know that we need drywall put in,\nand I know that I can't do it.\n\n348\n00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,860\nSo I know I'm gonna subcontract that out.\n\n349\n00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,300\nSo I reach out to a contractor.\n\n350\n00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,820\nNow, in my planning phase I\ndefined that procurement.\n\n351\n00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,030\nI say, all right,\nhere's how we're gonna do it.\n\n352\n00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,793\nWe're gonna do a request for bid, and\n\n353\n00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:50,054\nwe're gonna have various drywall\ncontractors come and give me bids.\n\n354\n00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:54,340\nAnd I'll pick the winning bid, and\nthat's who I'm gonna contract with, right?\n\n355\n00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,130\nWe define all that in planning.\n\n356\n00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,160\nAnd actually sending out the RFPs,\n\n357\n00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,075\nactually doing that,\nis part of the executing phase.\n\n358\n00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:05,461\nSo I might stop right there in my plan and\nsay, all right, let's finish planning and\n\n359\n00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:07,195\nthen go into executing.\n\n360\n00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:09,969\nThe problem is when we do that,\nI pick my winning big, and I say, okay,\n\n361\n00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:11,844\nyou're the company I\nwant to do business with.\n\n362\n00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:13,695\nRight, I'm in executing.\n\n363\n00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:16,414\nI say I want to do business with you,\nand they say, okay,\n\n364\n00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:18,529\nour next availability is December 12th.\n\n365\n00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:22,605\nAnd I look at my calendar and I'm like,\noh, my goodness we're in August right now.\n\n366\n00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:24,260\nThat's months away.\n\n367\n00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,510\nThat's the earliest you can do it?\n\n368\n00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,430\nAnd they say, yeah, we're the best and\nwe're the cheapest, so we're busy, right?\n\n369\n00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,690\nAnd it's gonna be December.\n\n370\n00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,237\nSo now I've gotta go back and\nretool my schedule around that, and say,\n\n371\n00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:36,926\nwell crap, if I wanna use those guys,\nI'm gonna have to wait a few months.\n\n372\n00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:39,250\nI'm gonna have to extend out my schedule.\n\n373\n00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,550\nSo because contract can influence\nyour schedule and your budget and\n\n374\n00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,790\nthings like that, a lot of times\nwe'll engage in those contracts,\n\n375\n00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,940\nwe'll engage in those procurements\nwhile we're still in planning so\n\n376\n00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,840\nthat we can plan around those resources.\n\n377\n00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,910\nSo this is one of those gray areas\nwhere we start to get overlap between\n\n378\n00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,390\nthe process of the phases, right.\n\n379\n00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,900\nSo let's go back into\nconduct procurements, right.\n\n380\n00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,576\nWe had a procurement plan, and\n\n381\n00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:09,455\nthe plan stated how we were going\nto engage these contractors, right.\n\n382\n00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,198\nIf we already had somebody selected,\nif we already had other things that were\n\n383\n00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:16,340\ndefined, then there's not\na whole lot of work to do here.\n\n384\n00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,230\nBut if there was a selection process,\nand that selection process\n\n385\n00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,090\nwas defined in there and\nhere's where we go about that process.\n\n386\n00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,820\nSome of the other inputs\nthat we're gonna use here,\n\n387\n00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,070\nwe might already have\nprocurement documents drawn up.\n\n388\n00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,420\nWe might already have a contract\nin hand ready to be executed.\n\n389\n00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,130\nThis is when we need the contract.\n\n390\n00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,950\nWe need to go in and\nget it and get ready for that.\n\n391\n00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,100\nWe may have quotes some people\nalready generated, right?\n\n392\n00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,480\nThese are all things that\nare going to be inputs, all right.\n\n393\n00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,480\nThen, source selection criteria, right?\n\n394\n00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,696\nWhen we go to pick somebody as\na contractor, we have multiple,\n\n395\n00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:50,650\nthey're called sources, right.\n\n396\n00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,040\nWe have,\nlet me clarify this terminology here.\n\n397\n00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,860\nIf you were certified in\na previous version of the PMBOK\n\n398\n00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,200\nthey used to be called sellers.\n\n399\n00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,069\nAnd so we had what was called the select\nseller process, and that's all gone now.\n\n400\n00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:05,420\nAnd it's called procurements, and so\nthe terminology, it's a little weird.\n\n401\n00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,400\nSo see how I've got like seller proposals\nhere and source selection criteria.\n\n402\n00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,640\nThis used to be seller selection criteria,\nthat we'd actually pick who was going to\n\n403\n00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,590\nbe the seller,\nwho was going to sell us that good.\n\n404\n00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,407\nBut the thing is, the terminology is\njust weird for services and stuff.\n\n405\n00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,110\nSo, now it's the source selection.\n\n406\n00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,230\nWho is going to be the source for this\nproduct or service that we need, right?\n\n407\n00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,460\nWhich source are we going to use?\n\n408\n00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,140\nWhat are the selection criteria, right?\n\n409\n00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,592\nAnd do we break those down in the notes?\n\n410\n00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:31,968\n>> Yep, we do.\n>> Let's pull that up.\n\n411\n00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:34,880\nProcurement, here we go.\n\n412\n00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,600\nSo under source selection criteria,\nhow do we make that decision?\n\n413\n00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,410\nHow do we pick who's going to be\nthe person who provides us that service?\n\n414\n00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,500\n>> That first one there,\non the capabilities, right?\n\n415\n00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,100\nA lot of times you have a company,\nand you go, I know I want to use this.\n\n416\n00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,910\nBut then you talk to them about it, and\n\n417\n00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,710\nall of a sudden you realize they can do\npart of the job, but not the whole thing.\n\n418\n00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,495\nAs much as you like the company,\nyou've got to say, well,\n\n419\n00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,125\nthey just don't meet\nthe capabilities that we need.\n\n420\n00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,401\nAnd so sometimes that happens, where\nyou know that that's what you want to\n\n421\n00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:02,698\nwork with, but they just go,\nlook, I can't do it.\n\n422\n00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:06,187\nSo, again, that's one of the selection\ncriteria that we have to be aware.\n\n423\n00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:08,620\n>> We see it in IT all the time.\n\n424\n00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,954\nIt's different in other industries.\n\n425\n00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:14,783\nBut in IT If you need a development\nproject, if you need to somebody to write\n\n426\n00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:20,090\nsoftware for you and you reach out to a\ncontractor, IT contractors hate to say no.\n\n427\n00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,440\nThey almost never say no, because what\nthey do is, if they can't do something,\n\n428\n00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,880\nthey turn around and subcontract it\nout themselves to somebody else.\n\n429\n00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,300\nThey do that all the time.\n\n430\n00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,160\nIt's just, I don't know, it's\nsomething in the way they do business.\n\n431\n00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,140\nIt's not nice.\n\n432\n00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,920\nSo, we need to make sure we understand\nwhat their capabilities are actually of.\n\n433\n00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,770\nAnd I don't remember if I\ntold this story or not,\n\n434\n00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,400\ncuz I had a mentor that taught me a lot\nabout project management years ago.\n\n435\n00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,179\nAnd he showed me that\nthis trick that he used.\n\n436\n00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,376\nAnd whenever he would write up a\nrequirement sheet, cuz when you engage in\n\n437\n00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:57,316\na contract like this, you're gonna\ndo a statement of work, an SOW.\n\n438\n00:20:57,316 --> 00:21:00,790\nAnd this statement of work says\nhere's what I need you to do, right?\n\n439\n00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,850\nCan you do it?\n\n440\n00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,390\nAnd then if you can, let's sign off on it.\n\n441\n00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,480\nThat's what you're gonna do.\n\n442\n00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,840\nAnd he had found for years that he\nwould write these statements of work.\n\n443\n00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,820\nPeople would say they could do stuff,\nand then it would turn out it couldn't.\n\n444\n00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,361\nSo what he did is he made\nup a software product.\n\n445\n00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:14,837\nAll right,\nI can't remember what it was called.\n\n446\n00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:16,665\nIt was like Star Database or\nsomething like that.\n\n447\n00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:21,725\nAnd he would put on there, must be able\nto integrate with Star Database 5.2.\n\n448\n00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:25,093\nAnd it was a made up\nproduct that didn't exist.\n\n449\n00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:28,227\nAnd he would send out this RFB or\nwhatever, RFQ,\n\n450\n00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:30,301\nwhatever you're sending out.\n\n451\n00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:34,044\nAnd when he'd get replies back, he would\nfind where a lot of people would say, yes,\n\n452\n00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,935\nwe can integrate with that.\n\n453\n00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:37,365\nAnd it's not a real product.\n\n454\n00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:38,385\nSo you knew what they were saying.\n\n455\n00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:42,740\nWhat they were saying was, we can do it\nif we get paid more to develop it, or\n\n456\n00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,310\nwe subcontract it out.\n\n457\n00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,149\nAnd the people who said they couldn't\ndo it, he would say all right,\n\n458\n00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:47,846\nthese are people who are properly\nreflecting what they can do.\n\n459\n00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:50,920\nSo little things like that can help.\n\n460\n00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,450\nIt's a shame you have to do that stuff,\nbut it does work.\n\n461\n00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,120\nSo capabilities are important.\n\n462\n00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,278\nCapacity is another one, right.\n\n463\n00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:05,360\nI might have one contract web\ndeveloper that I know is brilliant,\n\n464\n00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,890\njust a genius,\ncan do everything that I need.\n\n465\n00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,035\nBut it's one person.\n\n466\n00:22:10,035 --> 00:22:14,250\nAnd I might have so\nmuch work that one person can't do it.\n\n467\n00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,040\nThen I need a team of ten\npeople working on it.\n\n468\n00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,410\nWhen I contract this out,\n\n469\n00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,850\nI need a real organization\nthat's got a lot of employees.\n\n470\n00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,140\nNow, on the Internet it's tough.\n\n471\n00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,890\nYou see all these companies, they\nmight have a really nice web page, but\n\n472\n00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,760\nit turns out it's just one\nperson running the show.\n\n473\n00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,530\nAnd so you look at this product and\nyou're like, wow,\n\n474\n00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,885\nthat product could really do what I want.\n\n475\n00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:36,120\nBut it's one person, and\nit's just not gonna fly.\n\n476\n00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,610\nSo, we need to make sure\nthey have the capacity\n\n477\n00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,260\nto handle the workload\nthat we have got here.\n\n478\n00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,490\nDo they have enough employees?\n\n479\n00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,340\nDelivery dates, that's another one, right.\n\n480\n00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,140\nI mentioned that one earlier.\n\n481\n00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,134\nIf we're gonna be contracting out to\nsomebody for a good or a service,\n\n482\n00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,728\nwe need it by a certain time, right.\n\n483\n00:22:50,728 --> 00:22:54,640\nAre they gonna be able to do that\nin the time that I need, right.\n\n484\n00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,426\nWhen you start shopping for\nthe lowest price, I know computers, right.\n\n485\n00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:03,164\nI know for a fact that I can\norder a computer from China and\n\n486\n00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:06,610\nget it cheaper than if\nI buy one from here.\n\n487\n00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,666\nBut I know if I order it from China,\n\n488\n00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,500\nthere's gonna be a three week\nshipping time on it, right.\n\n489\n00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,630\nAnd that may be too long.\n\n490\n00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,120\nSo, those are some of the things\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n491\n00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,590\nProduct cost.\n\n492\n00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,470\nCost, in my opinion,\n\n493\n00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,330\nshould not be the number one deciding\nfactor when you're doing a contract.\n\n494\n00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,695\nBut for most people it is.\n\n495\n00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,940\nRight, so that cost becomes really,\nreally important.\n\n496\n00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,046\nHow much is it gonna cost to\nuse that particular contractor?\n\n497\n00:23:28,046 --> 00:23:32,586\nThe reason I say it shouldn't be is\nwhen you go for the lowest bidder,\n\n498\n00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:37,310\nyou're sacrificing things like quality,\nright, and reliability.\n\n499\n00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,220\nThat's what gets sacrificed\nto get that lower price.\n\n500\n00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,240\nAnd so it may or may not be the way to go.\n\n501\n00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,440\nLife cycle cost.\n\n502\n00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,371\nWhen you buy something, or purchase a\nservice, they're normally quoting you for\n\n503\n00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:52,685\nthe initial installation or\nimplementation of whatever that is, but\n\n504\n00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:55,064\nthere's usually ongoing maintenance,\nright.\n\n505\n00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:58,805\nIf you buy a vehicle,\nthere's a vehicle cost.\n\n506\n00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:02,091\nBut then there's maintenance to keep\nit running, fuel to keep it running.\n\n507\n00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:04,603\nAll of that stuff adds\nto that cost over time.\n\n508\n00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:08,454\nWith software products Updates, upgrades,\nright, supporting new operating systems,\n\n509\n00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:09,664\nsupporting new databases.\n\n510\n00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,780\nThat all requires additional development.\n\n511\n00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,000\nSo what are the back-end costs?\n\n512\n00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,933\nWhat's the cost gonna be over the long\nrun of utilizing that service or product?\n\n513\n00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:22,660\nAll right, technical expertise.\n\n514\n00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,061\nDo they actually specialize\nin what it is that you need?\n\n515\n00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:31,590\nAll right, because there are a lot\nof people that have general\n\n516\n00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,010\nknowledge that can do a lot\nof different things, but\n\n517\n00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,231\ndo they specialize in what you want,\nall right.\n\n518\n00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:40,937\nFor example, we use ITProTV\nbecause I went through this way\n\n519\n00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,767\nback when we first opened\nup on the Internet.\n\n520\n00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:46,450\nWe decided that we wanted\nto do a Roku channel.\n\n521\n00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,720\nAnd we've had our Roku channel for\na long time now, and it's very stable and\n\n522\n00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,730\nworks great.\n\n523\n00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,117\nBut in the early days it didn't, right?\n\n524\n00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:57,510\nIn the first roll out of that Roku\nchannel, this was well over a year ago.\n\n525\n00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,653\nIt was a little bit iffy.\n\n526\n00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:01,060\nSometimes the videos wouldn't play and\nstuff.\n\n527\n00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,340\nWhat was happening was we were\nusing a video hosting provider.\n\n528\n00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,250\nThey hosted videos,\nit's what they did, right.\n\n529\n00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,000\nBut they didn't really have a lot\nof experience with the Roku.\n\n530\n00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,400\nAnd the Roku boxes had\nsome weird requirements,\n\n531\n00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,490\nand it was causing videos to stop playing\nhalfway through and things like that.\n\n532\n00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:21,790\nSo we ended up going with another video\nprovider that actually had expertise\n\n533\n00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,650\nin the Roku device itself, and they said,\nall right, we can directly support that.\n\n534\n00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,860\nYeah, there are some weird caveats.\n\n535\n00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,180\nWe know how to deal with it.\n\n536\n00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,960\nAnd by going to them,\nnow our Roku channel is rock solid, right?\n\n537\n00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,410\nSo we went with people that were\nreally good in video hosting, but\n\n538\n00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,740\nwe needed somebody who was a specialist,\nthat has that technical expertise\n\n539\n00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,610\nin that particular area that we needed,\nall right.\n\n540\n00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,500\nAnd then the last part here is\nthe approach to the contract, right.\n\n541\n00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,530\nIn the planning phase, we talk about the\ndifferent contracts that were out there,\n\n542\n00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:56,120\nlike the Cost Plus and\nother contract types like that.\n\n543\n00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,100\nSo which contract type\nare they wanting to sign?\n\n544\n00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,866\nIf it's a flat-fee contract\nthat's nice and safe for you.\n\n545\n00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:05,115\nAnd so you might prefer that over\nsomebody who is doing a time and\n\n546\n00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:09,225\nmaterials contract or something that's\na little bit more nebulous on what that\n\n547\n00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:11,010\nfinal price is going to be.\n\n548\n00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,550\nSo that's another weighing factor in\nwhich person you're going to pick,\n\n549\n00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,475\nwhich source you're going to go with for\nengaging in that contract.\n\n550\n00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:23,400\nSo, what we'll normally do is we'll\nnormally take these categories, and\n\n551\n00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,060\nwe'll assign a priority to them, right.\n\n552\n00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,800\nWhat's the most important to us?\n\n553\n00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,330\nIs cost the most important?\n\n554\n00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,450\nThen we make that our number one category,\nright?\n\n555\n00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,660\nIs capability or technical expertise,\nis that second place?\n\n556\n00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,570\nWe make that number two, and so on.\n\n557\n00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,330\nAnd then we score all of our\nsubmitted contracts that come in,\n\n558\n00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,580\nall the proposed contracts.\n\n559\n00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,130\nWe score them based on\nthis little score sheet.\n\n560\n00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,068\nAnd, we can then compare them, right.\n\n561\n00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:48,404\nYou quantify, you give them a number so\n\n562\n00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:50,730\nyou can compare them together\nto figure out who is the best.\n\n563\n00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,450\nThis are generally the criteria\nwe're looking for.\n\n564\n00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,010\n>> This particular process, once you\nactually start getting several of them in\n\n565\n00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,150\nhand, this is where it takes\neven more time, right?\n\n566\n00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,870\nYou already know what your\ncriteria is going to be.\n\n567\n00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,564\nAnd then once you actually get that\ninformation out to your sellers,\n\n568\n00:27:03,564 --> 00:27:05,747\nwhoever is actually trying\nto provide you the service,\n\n569\n00:27:05,747 --> 00:27:07,892\nthat's when it actually takes a little but\nmore time.\n\n570\n00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,700\nBecause all of a sudden you get two or\nthree that,\n\n571\n00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,850\nall of a sudden the score\nsheet's almost identical.\n\n572\n00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,700\nAnd now you're like, okay,\nwhat's going to be the determining factor?\n\n573\n00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,400\nAnd then, that's actually when it\ngets a little more complicated.\n\n574\n00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,670\nBut this is part of that process.\n\n575\n00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,470\nWe have to go through it,\nhave to be able to actually go,\n\n576\n00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,900\nokay, here's what our\ndeciding factor's gonna be.\n\n577\n00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,380\nAnd this is what we have\nin terms of most important.\n\n578\n00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,670\n>> Yep.\n>> Yep.\n\n579\n00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,890\n>> All right, well, we've got a lot\nmore to talk about on procurements.\n\n580\n00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,583\nWe're gonna get into some of the other\ncomponents we need to worry about and\n\n581\n00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:35,295\nsome of the different things that go\nin our statements of work and all that.\n\n582\n00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:36,690\nThat's really important.\n\n583\n00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,450\nBut this is a pretty good spot for\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n584\n00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,199\nSo why don't we take a pause here.\n\n585\n00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:43,566\nWhen we get back,\nmore procurement management after this.\n\n586\n00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:47,594\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n587\n00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:53,506\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n588\n00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:58,130\nSo before the break we were talking\nabout the source selection criteria.\n\n589\n00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,460\nAnd I mention how we use a score, and\n\n590\n00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,520\nI wanted to show everybody\nan example of that.\n\n591\n00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,560\nSo I've got one of our little\ntemplates fired up here, and\n\n592\n00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,790\nthis is the source selection\ncriteria template.\n\n593\n00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,660\nAnd basically what we do is\nwe weigh our criteria, and\n\n594\n00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,750\nthose were all the things that we\nwere talking about before the break.\n\n595\n00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,665\nThat was things like capabilities,\ncapacity, delivery dates, and so on.\n\n596\n00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:23,415\nThey can be really general like this,\nor they can be extremely specific,\n\n597\n00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:24,631\nbased on what you need.\n\n598\n00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:28,479\nAnd I know I talked about this in the\nplanning phase, but just to kind of recap.\n\n599\n00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:32,562\nSo, one project that I\nworked on was building\n\n600\n00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:37,440\na disaster recovery center for\nan organization.\n\n601\n00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,075\nAnd so we had to choose from several\ndifferent centers that we could\n\n602\n00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:42,510\nco-locate with.\n\n603\n00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,113\nSo we came up with some criteria, and\none criteria was must have multiple ISPs,\n\n604\n00:28:47,113 --> 00:28:49,112\nmultiple internet connections.\n\n605\n00:28:49,112 --> 00:28:51,510\nI can't even type it.\n\n606\n00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,920\nSo must have multiple internet\nconnections, another one was, must have\n\n607\n00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,510\nsecured, redundant power, was another one.\n\n608\n00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,910\nA lot of places will have generators,\n\n609\n00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,510\nbut they're just on the outside of\nthe building and not necessarily secured.\n\n610\n00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:13,888\nWe had another one,\nwhich was separate tectonic plates.\n\n611\n00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:17,970\nHow do you even spell tectonic?\n\n612\n00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,820\nApparently not like that.\n\n613\n00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,970\nTechtronic, that's not what I wanted.\n\n614\n00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,440\nSo anyhow, separate tectonic plate.\n\n615\n00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,490\nWe had these different requirements,\noh, no H I guess.\n\n616\n00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:29,780\nSo we had these different requirements\nthat were important for us for\n\n617\n00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,610\nthese disaster recovery facilities,\nto make sure that they met our needs.\n\n618\n00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,820\nWe needed multiple ISPs because\nwe were an Internet company, and\n\n619\n00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,920\nif the Internet connection failed,\nwe still needed to have service, right.\n\n620\n00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,930\nSecured redundant power, well,\n\n621\n00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,860\njust like the Internet, you need power\notherwise your servers aren't gonna work.\n\n622\n00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,160\nAnd then the separate tectonic plate,\nwe were in Washington State.\n\n623\n00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,876\nYou have earthquakes on\nthe West Coast of the United States.\n\n624\n00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:54,962\nAnd so if an earthquake hits and\nit affects your center or\n\n625\n00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:59,627\nsomething, your disaster recovery center\nshould be in a different area unaffected\n\n626\n00:29:59,627 --> 00:30:02,900\nby that same disaster,\nso, a separate plate.\n\n627\n00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,481\nNow, what we did is we ranked each of our\ncandidates on a score of one to five,\n\n628\n00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:11,418\nall right, where one meant that\nthey didn't meet our needs, and\n\n629\n00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:14,445\nfive meant that they exceeded our needs,\nright.\n\n630\n00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,390\nA three was that they just met our needs.\n\n631\n00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,150\nThat was kind of how we gauged it.\n\n632\n00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,240\nSo when we reach out to the candidates,\nwe might find\n\n633\n00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,940\nCandidate 1 might just have two\nInternet connections, all right.\n\n634\n00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,320\nSo they're redundant.\nThey meet our needs, 3.\n\n635\n00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,260\nBut Candidate 2 might have\nfive internet connections.\n\n636\n00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,235\nThey exceed our need.\n\n637\n00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:36,860\nYou have connections through multiple\nISPs, so we might go all the way up.\n\n638\n00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,080\nCandidate 3, on the other hand,\nmight only have,\n\n639\n00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,120\nlet's say three Internet connections.\n\n640\n00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,460\nSo they exceed our need, but\nit's not exceptional, so\n\n641\n00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,970\nmaybe I give them a score of 4, right?\n\n642\n00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,670\nSecured redundant power, maybe they\nall have that, and they all exceed,\n\n643\n00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,270\nso I'll just give them all 5s on that one,\nall right?\n\n644\n00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:58,730\nAnd then separate tectonic plate, maybe\nthe first place here, Candidate 1, yeah\n\n645\n00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,810\nthey're absolutely, they're on the other\nside of the country so I give them a 5.\n\n646\n00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,390\nCandidate 2, well maybe they're\non the same tectonic plate as us,\n\n647\n00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,560\nso they don't meet our needs,\nso I'll give them a 1.\n\n648\n00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,958\nAnd then Candidate 3,\nmaybe they are not too far away.\n\n649\n00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,660\nWe'll just say that they barely meet it,\nall right?\n\n650\n00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,070\nNow that I've given these scores,\nhow do I compare them together?\n\n651\n00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,180\nBecause if I think about it,\nmultiple ISPs, Candidate 2 wins.\n\n652\n00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,840\nSecured redundant power,\nit's a three way tie.\n\n653\n00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,080\nSeparate tectonic plate, Candidate 1 wins.\n\n654\n00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,010\nSo who's the big winner?\n\n655\n00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,380\nLooking at the numbers like this,\nwe can't really decide.\n\n656\n00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:38,050\nSo what we need to do is,\nwe need to apply a weight to each one.\n\n657\n00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,530\nSometimes you have requirements\nthat are nice to have, but\n\n658\n00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:46,940\nshouldn't cause your whole project\nto go offline or whatever, right?\n\n659\n00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,359\nWe might even have another entry in here\nthat says something about the financial\n\n660\n00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,972\nliability of that company, so\ndifferent things like that.\n\n661\n00:31:52,972 --> 00:31:55,490\nYou might not wanna change\nyour decision based on it.\n\n662\n00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,360\nBut you wanna track it.\n\n663\n00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,127\nAnyway, so you assign a weight.\n\n664\n00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:01,106\nAnd I might say something like,\nyou know what, multiple ISPs,\n\n665\n00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:02,440\nthat's really important.\n\n666\n00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,647\nWe've got to have that.\n\n667\n00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:06,712\nAnd so\nI'm going to give that a weight of 10.\n\n668\n00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:08,453\nSecured redundant power.\n\n669\n00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:10,199\nThat's really important,\nwe've got to have that.\n\n670\n00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:15,340\nI'll give it a weight of ten but separate\ntectonic plate it would be nice to have.\n\n671\n00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,100\nBut at the end of the day, if they're on\nthe same tectonic plate as us as long as\n\n672\n00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,750\nthey're far enough away,\nit's probably fine.\n\n673\n00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,610\nEarthquakes generally only\naffect a certain radius, so\n\n674\n00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,720\nas long as they're a certain\ndistance away it might be okay.\n\n675\n00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,849\nSo I might give that one a lower weight,\nsomething like a five.\n\n676\n00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,310\nSo now, when I do these scores,\nI have to adjust them based on the weight.\n\n677\n00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,890\nSo for candidate one, I would take\nthis 3 and multiply it by 10 so\n\n678\n00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,960\ntheir score would actually be a 30.\n\n679\n00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,850\nThis 5 multiplied by 10 becomes a 50,\nthis 5 times 5 becomes 25.\n\n680\n00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,010\nAnd I continue doing the scoring that\nway for each of the other candidates,\n\n681\n00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,730\nupdating their score based on the weight.\n\n682\n00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:59,910\nSo this one would be a 50, this one\nwould be a 50 and this one would be a 5.\n\n683\n00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,479\nAnd then over here we've got let's see,\n4 times 10 that's a 40.\n\n684\n00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:07,718\nWe've got a 50 and then we've got a 15.\n\n685\n00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:14,030\nNow, these scores are adjusted\nbased on what's important to us.\n\n686\n00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,320\nSo once they've been adjusted, now these\nnumbers can all be treated the same so\n\n687\n00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,940\nwe just aggregate them\ntogether to form a total.\n\n688\n00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:27,363\nSo our total score for\ncandidate 1 here would actually be 105.\n\n689\n00:33:27,363 --> 00:33:28,430\n>> 105, yup.\n\n690\n00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,322\n>> Q05-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n691\n00:33:29,322 --> 00:33:31,073\n>> Going to go into abstract mathematics.\n\n692\n00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:33,093\nThis one is also a 105.\n\n693\n00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:33,625\nGreat.\n\n694\n00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stinking tie.\n\n695\n00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,820\nAnd then-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n696\n00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,380\n>> This one, oh my goodness,\n\n697\n00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,235\nRonnie, did all three-\n>> Yes.\n\n698\n00:33:38,235 --> 00:33:39,316\n>> Of these end up as 105?\n\n699\n00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:40,477\n>> They did.\n\n700\n00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,490\n[LAUGH]\n>> I completely picked these numbers out\n\n701\n00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,536\nof my head and ended up where\nwe got a three way stinking tie.\n\n702\n00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:46,661\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n703\n00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:48,688\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That did not work out the way\n\n704\n00:33:48,688 --> 00:33:49,650\nthat I planned.\n\n705\n00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,690\nSo anyhow well now, we an see even\nthough candidate two got a one\n\n706\n00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:58,410\nin this category they completely\nfailed to meet this requirement.\n\n707\n00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,770\nEven though they failed to meet the\nrequirement because it had a lower weight\n\n708\n00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,360\nand they were exceptional in\nthe other two it made up for it.\n\n709\n00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,394\nAnd that brought their score up to\nultimately match the other three.\n\n710\n00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:13,465\nI did a terrible job here.\n\n711\n00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:14,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n712\n00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,500\nthat in effect I've got a three-way tie.\n\n713\n00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,520\nI could pick any one of these guys and\nbe just as well off as the others because\n\n714\n00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,390\naccording to what was important to me,\nit worked out that way.\n\n715\n00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,734\nAt a minimum you should usually\nbe able to trim off at least.\n\n716\n00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:29,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And say, we'll cut that guy.\n\n717\n00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,630\nLet's say that separate tectonic plate.\n\n718\n00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,890\nLet's say that was like\nan actual legal requirement.\n\n719\n00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,300\nSo I had to have it.\n\n720\n00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,850\nI just had to.\n\n721\n00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,986\nSo if I wanted to bump that up and\nincrease it to say like a 20.\n\n722\n00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:45,830\nNow, it becomes a lot\nmore important to me.\n\n723\n00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,020\nSo if you've got a score of 5 and it's\ngot a weight of 20, that's becomes a 100.\n\n724\n00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,722\nHere's it's a score of 1, and it's\na weight of 20, so that just becomes 20.\n\n725\n00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:56,198\nAnd then over here,\nit's a 3 so that becomes 60.\n\n726\n00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:58,550\nAnd that's gonna adjust my scores.\n\n727\n00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,770\nAnd so I'll see this one becomes 180,\n\n728\n00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,805\nif they're all the same Ronnie-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n729\n00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:04,475\n>> I'm gonna be frustrated.\n\n730\n00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:07,580\n>> 120, here we go.\n\n731\n00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,230\n>> And this one becomes 120 and\nthis one becomes 150.\n\n732\n00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,170\nNow, having adjusted that\ntectonic plate requirement,\n\n733\n00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,640\nI can see there's a clear winner.\n\n734\n00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,435\nCandidate 1.\n\n735\n00:35:16,435 --> 00:35:19,105\n>> Yup.\n>> Even though Candidate 1 only got a 3\n\n736\n00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:20,280\non multiple ISPs.\n\n737\n00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:26,360\nIt did great at redundant power and it\ndid great at the separate tectonic plate,\n\n738\n00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,760\nwhich is now my most important category.\n\n739\n00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,230\nAnd that put Candidate 1 ahead.\n\n740\n00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,946\nThat's what we can do when we\ndo a matrix like this, and\n\n741\n00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:37,142\nit makes decisions very straightforward.\n\n742\n00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:39,684\nWhat I'll normally do is\nactually a combination of things.\n\n743\n00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:43,635\nSo I'll get my information back from\nthe company, so candidate 1, 2,\n\n744\n00:35:43,635 --> 00:35:46,522\nand 3 and\nI'll distribute those to my project team.\n\n745\n00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:51,143\nAnd I'll have each of my project\nteam members score the candidates.\n\n746\n00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:53,008\nI usually don't even\ntell them the weights,\n\n747\n00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:56,080\nI just tell them to go through and\nscore the various requirements.\n\n748\n00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,100\nAnd so\nthey score it based on what they thought.\n\n749\n00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,510\nAnd then I take their numbers and\naverage them together.\n\n750\n00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,220\nSo I might have ten people that all\nawarded Candidate 1 a different score for\n\n751\n00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,980\nMultiple ISP, but I average them\ntogether to create an average score.\n\n752\n00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,420\nThen we lay it out on the scoresheet\nlike this, applied with our weights and\n\n753\n00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,810\nfrom there,\nwe can calculate a very clear winner.\n\n754\n00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,600\nSo now, there's no arguments no, we really\nshould have gone with that other ISP.\n\n755\n00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,750\nIt's clear, right?\n\n756\n00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,270\nHere we can show how we\ncame about those numbers?\n\n757\n00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,850\nHow we came across those results?\n\n758\n00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,200\nNow, when you're averaging\npeople's scores together,\n\n759\n00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,860\nsome people's-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n760\n00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,370\n>> Scores might count more than others so\n\n761\n00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,510\nyou might actually have\nweights attached to that too.\n\n762\n00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,790\nYou can really get complex\nwith this stuff if you want.\n\n763\n00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:38,830\nBut it is a good way to pick who\nthe best contractor is going to be.\n\n764\n00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,940\nAnd it can be fairly impartial.\n\n765\n00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,270\nOne thing we talked about in\nan earlier show was ethics, and\n\n766\n00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:48,260\nhow you want to avoid\nthe appearance of impropriety?\n\n767\n00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,660\nWell, one example of that,\nis if you put out a request for\n\n768\n00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,240\nbids and one company that responds back\nhappens to be a relative of yours.\n\n769\n00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,790\nMaybe it's your brother or sister or\n\n770\n00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,210\nbrother in law, it doesn't have to\nbe blood, but a legal relationship.\n\n771\n00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,570\nSo that person you've got\na relationship with them.\n\n772\n00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,370\nSo the instinct that we have\nis to just decline that bid.\n\n773\n00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,140\nWe're not gonna consider that bid\nbecause they're a relative of mine.\n\n774\n00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,611\nI don't want that to weigh on\nthe choice and we knock them out.\n\n775\n00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:19,630\nBut you might be passing\non a good opportunity.\n\n776\n00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,350\nSure, they might be your brother-in-law,\nbut they might be doing the best work for\n\n777\n00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,840\nthe lowest cost and by negating their bid,\nyou're actually hurting your project.\n\n778\n00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,050\nSo it's okay to do business with your\nbrother-in-law or sister-in-law or\n\n779\n00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,980\nwhatever, it's okay to do business with\nthem as long as you do two things.\n\n780\n00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,020\nOne, you recuse yourself from the scoring.\n\n781\n00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,410\nYou don't score that particular candidate.\n\n782\n00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:47,180\nYou let everybody else score it,\nso it's their numbers, not yours.\n\n783\n00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,190\nAnd then you weigh all\nthe candidates evenly like this.\n\n784\n00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,270\nHere I can show exactly,\nhow we made that decision, and.\n\n785\n00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:59,550\nSure enough, my brother came in with\nthe best quote providing the best work.\n\n786\n00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,520\nI didn't score them.\n\n787\n00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,700\nI scored the other companies,\nbut I didn't score that one.\n\n788\n00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,330\nEverybody else did and they all\ndecided that this is the way to go.\n\n789\n00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,310\nIt's a great way to show that and\navoid the appearance of impropriety.\n\n790\n00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,940\nWe meet our ethics needs.\n\n791\n00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,570\nThat's a question a lot of people miss on\nthe exam because your instinct is to say,\n\n792\n00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,090\nI'm not gonna do business with my brother.\n\n793\n00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,400\nA lot of companies have\nanti nepotism clauses and\n\n794\n00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,670\nthings, but it can be at\nthe detriment of your project.\n\n795\n00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,430\nSo as long as you follow the straight and\nnarrow, you'll be fine.\n\n796\n00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:34,125\nSo that's an example of a source\nselection criteria matrix or\n\n797\n00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:38,225\nscore card, and how we can come up with\nwho is going to be the best vendor.\n\n798\n00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:43,815\nSo some of the other things that\nwe need to talk about well,\n\n799\n00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:46,215\nwe've got seller proposals and\nall these other inputs.\n\n800\n00:38:46,215 --> 00:38:48,025\nWe're still doing with the inputs here,\n\n801\n00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:50,610\nwe haven't actually even got to\nwork with our procurements yet.\n\n802\n00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,920\nSo if we take a look at some of\nthe other inputs that we've got,\n\n803\n00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,850\nwe've got things like\nour seller proposals.\n\n804\n00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,510\nWhere do I get the data about\nall these different contractors?\n\n805\n00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,480\nWell they send us proposals.\n\n806\n00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,844\nYou remember in the planning phase we\ntalk about RFQ, Request for Quote.\n\n807\n00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,143\nRFPs, Request for Proposal.\n\n808\n00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:10,546\nRFB, Request for Bid.\n\n809\n00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:12,065\nEach one's a little bit different, but\n\n810\n00:39:12,065 --> 00:39:14,095\nthese are all proposals\nthat we get from people.\n\n811\n00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:16,615\nSo I guess I could add these in here.\n\n812\n00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,735\nSo Request for Bid.\n\n813\n00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:25,685\nThat's what we're asking somebody to tell\nus, how much would we need to pay them.\n\n814\n00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:28,099\nHow much would it cost for\nthem to do this project for us?\n\n815\n00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,290\nRequest for Quote is very similar.\n\n816\n00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,630\nRFQ the terms can practically\nbe interchangeable.\n\n817\n00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,320\nRequest for proposal is the cool one.\n\n818\n00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,038\nBecause that's where we say,\nwe need something done.\n\n819\n00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:42,510\nBut we don't know how to do it.\n\n820\n00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,190\nSo propose to us how you would do it?\n\n821\n00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,720\nMaybe you've got some unique way\nof doing some of this better than\n\n822\n00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,020\nsomebody else's way.\n\n823\n00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,150\nMaybe I've got two companies that\ncan do the exact same thing for me.\n\n824\n00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,370\nThey can both lay the foundation for\nthis house.\n\n825\n00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,271\nAnd they both have the same price.\n\n826\n00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:03,325\nBut one of them uses an environmentally\nfriendly source for their concrete mixture\n\n827\n00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:08,107\nversus the other one that is doing strip\nmining or whatever for the materials.\n\n828\n00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:10,974\nSo, I might choose to go the\nenvironmentally friendly way because it's\n\n829\n00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:13,240\npart of a green initiative in my company.\n\n830\n00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,790\nThe price was the same, it didn't\nimpact my schedule or deadline, but\n\n831\n00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,330\nit was a nice thing to have.\n\n832\n00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,370\nThose are things that you can find when\nyou get RFPs, Request For Proposals.\n\n833\n00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:22,920\nAll right?\n\n834\n00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,050\nThere's a ton of other documents\nthat are out there, and\n\n835\n00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,240\nwe'll talk about some other ones.\n\n836\n00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,970\nBut those are some of the bigger ones\nright there that people will send out.\n\n837\n00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,470\nYou draft these documents, and\n\n838\n00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,290\nyou send it out to any company you\nthink that might be able to do this.\n\n839\n00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,840\nOr if you're somebody big like the U.S.\ngovernment, you don't even send them out.\n\n840\n00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,320\nYou just post them on your website and\npeople come to you.\n\n841\n00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,570\nLike, hey I want to do this work.\n\n842\n00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,750\nLet me see if the government has\nany contracts out right now.\n\n843\n00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,290\nAnd they'll submit their bids,\ntheir quotes, their proposals.\n\n844\n00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,970\nAnd then, you just have to pick from them.\n\n845\n00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,510\nYou use your cell or selection\ncriteria to go and pick the best one.\n\n846\n00:40:55,102 --> 00:40:57,670\nAll right, some of the other\ndocuments that we might have:\n\n847\n00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,415\nwe've got things in here like\nour risk related documents.\n\n848\n00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:05,320\nAnytime we make a risk related decision,\nlike engaging in insurance.\n\n849\n00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,660\nWe're gonna have documents that\nare generated based on that insurance\n\n850\n00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,540\npolicy and so on.\n\n851\n00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,840\nAnd you might pick between\nmultiple companies for that.\n\n852\n00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,350\nMake or\nbuy decisions are another big part.\n\n853\n00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:20,340\nWhen we contract something out, there's\nalways this moment in the beginning.\n\n854\n00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,480\nAnd I know we do this at ITProTV a lot,\n\n855\n00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,045\nwhere you say boy,\nwe could do that ourselves.\n\n856\n00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:26,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me go back to the video\n\n857\n00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,570\nhosting story.\n\n858\n00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,330\nRight?\nWe used all third party video hosting\n\n859\n00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:35,320\nservers because those companies are\ncompanies that specialize in that service.\n\n860\n00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,580\nThey monitor it 24/7 they\ndo a great job of doing it.\n\n861\n00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,390\nBut I would say at least\nhalf of our employees here\n\n862\n00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,635\nknow how to set up video\nstreaming servers.\n\n863\n00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,190\nRight?\n\n864\n00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:50,420\nSo we could have gone to Amazon S3\nspun up some Wowza servers or\n\n865\n00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,910\nflashed media servers.\n\n866\n00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,160\nAnd I brought those online and\nset up our own streaming environment.\n\n867\n00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,690\nAll right?\nWe know how to do it.\n\n868\n00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,350\nI've done it.\n\n869\n00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,130\nRight?\n\n870\n00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,110\nBut I'm busy.\n\n871\n00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,070\nI got a work.\n\n872\n00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,500\nRight now, I'm doing the show.\n\n873\n00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,900\nIf something goes wrong with the video\nstream, I don't want to stop and\n\n874\n00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,840\ngo and fix it.\n\n875\n00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,590\nSo we leverage a third party.\n\n876\n00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,190\nRight?\nSomebody else who is monitoring it 24/7,\n\n877\n00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,510\nwho is specializing in that and does it.\n\n878\n00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,780\nSo we could have made our product.\n\n879\n00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,260\nBut we chose to buy it.\n\n880\n00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,010\nRight?\n\n881\n00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,550\nFor various reasons.\n\n882\n00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,580\nThat's part of a Make or Buy Decision.\n\n883\n00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,980\nIf you have the core capabilities of that\nactivity built into your company already.\n\n884\n00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,430\nIf you've already got\npersonnel that can do it,\n\n885\n00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,025\nyou may well be able to do that\nsolution without contracting it out.\n\n886\n00:42:32,025 --> 00:42:33,580\nRight?\n\n887\n00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,984\nAssuming you've got the resources.\n\n888\n00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:36,960\n>> Yeah.\n>> The talent, and you can do it for\n\n889\n00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,290\neffectively the same cost\nas contracting it out.\n\n890\n00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,251\nBut sometimes you can contract it out and\nit costs less.\n\n891\n00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:44,511\nRight?\nThe value delivered by the vendor might\n\n892\n00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:46,058\nactually exceed what you can do.\n\n893\n00:42:46,058 --> 00:42:48,060\nRight?\nThey might save you money, or\n\n894\n00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,450\nin our case with the video streaming,\nit costs us more.\n\n895\n00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:50,956\n>> Right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n896\n00:42:50,956 --> 00:42:52,006\n>> We could save money if we\n\n897\n00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:53,820\nset up our video streaming servers.\n\n898\n00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,180\nBut those guys do a better job of it.\n\n899\n00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,640\nSo the value they bring us,\n\n900\n00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,055\nto have reliable video up every single\nday, we're willing to pay for that.\n\n901\n00:43:01,055 --> 00:43:03,150\nRight?\nThat is something that is valuable to me.\n\n902\n00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,741\nI'm starting to get that\nway with things at home.\n\n903\n00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:08,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It used to be\n\n904\n00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,170\n>> That I would build my own computer.\n\n905\n00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,830\nSo my computer at home,\nI would build it from parts.\n\n906\n00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,240\nBut as I've gotten older, I get less and\n\n907\n00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,740\nless patient with getting all the little\nparts mixed together and working.\n\n908\n00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,200\nAnd so I might just go out and\nbuy a Dell or\n\n909\n00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,830\nan HP because it's worth more\nto me to save the time and\n\n910\n00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,760\nit's not, I say that but I just built\nmy own computer what six months ago.\n\n911\n00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,630\nSo I do still dabble in it, but\nthat's the thing is that you might get\n\n912\n00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,275\nadditional value out of\nusing those numbers.\n\n913\n00:43:36,275 --> 00:43:39,310\nAll right, the other thing; risks\n\n914\n00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,072\nassociated with meeting the need\nin a cost effective manner.\n\n915\n00:43:42,072 --> 00:43:44,550\nRight?\nWhen you choose to make the solution,\n\n916\n00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:47,660\nto do it yourself,\nthere's a risk you're taking on.\n\n917\n00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,660\nRight?\nThat you might not meet your schedule or\n\n918\n00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,330\nyour budget/ Right?\n\n919\n00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,860\nYou are accepting the risk for that.\n\n920\n00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,995\nVersus when you contract it out,\nthe contractors are taking the risk.\n\n921\n00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:55,530\nRight?\n\n922\n00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:58,290\nIf they fail to meet the schedule,\nyou can penalize them.\n\n923\n00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,935\nYou can't penalize yourself,\nyou just fail your project.\n\n924\n00:44:00,935 --> 00:44:01,710\nRight?\nSo\n\n925\n00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,140\nthere's a risk transference that happens\nwhen you contract something out.\n\n926\n00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,200\nAnd then lastly, whether or\nnot you have the same capabilities\n\n927\n00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,940\ninside of your company that\nthe vendors would have.\n\n928\n00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,510\nRight?\n\n929\n00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,130\nThat's what we've got here.\n\n930\n00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,248\nWe've got the talent at ITProTV to\nset up video streaming service.\n\n931\n00:44:18,248 --> 00:44:19,575\nWe We've got it.\n\n932\n00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:23,495\nBut what we don't have is someone ready\nto sit there 24/7 monitoring those\n\n933\n00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:24,815\nservers and ensuring they're working.\n\n934\n00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:25,455\nRight?\n\n935\n00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:29,015\nWe've got support personnel, we've got the\npeople that monitor the support tickets\n\n936\n00:44:29,015 --> 00:44:30,675\nand the Q&A forums and stuff.\n\n937\n00:44:30,675 --> 00:44:31,480\nWe do that a lot.\n\n938\n00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,395\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we don't want to sit here and\n\n939\n00:44:33,395 --> 00:44:34,435\nmonitor streaming services.\n\n940\n00:44:34,435 --> 00:44:35,405\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n941\n00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:38,125\nyou get that capability\nfrom somebody outside so\n\n942\n00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:39,275\nthat you don't have to provide it inside.\n\n943\n00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,880\nThat's the key thing to\nremember with make or\n\n944\n00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,290\nbuy decisions and\nthis is the point where we make them.\n\n945\n00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,620\nAll right,\nnow if we decide to contract it out,\n\n946\n00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,410\nI mentioned the key document were gonna\nsend is the procurement statement of work.\n\n947\n00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,580\nRight?\nAnd if we look at our inputs,\n\n948\n00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,420\nwe've got that listed in here and\nit falls under the project documents.\n\n949\n00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh no, I'm sorry,\n\n950\n00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,040\nit's actually listed specifically,\nprocurement statement of work.\n\n951\n00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,260\nIf you're gonna contract something out,\nit's a contract.\n\n952\n00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,990\nRight?\nIt's a legal agreement to specify what\n\n953\n00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,150\nsomebody's gonna do.\n\n954\n00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,130\nSo you need to create a statement\nof work that identifies that.\n\n955\n00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:15,670\nAnd this is just like creating a work\nbreakdown structure back in our\n\n956\n00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:16,680\nplanning phase.\n\n957\n00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,880\nExcept here,\nit's just identifying a portion of your\n\n958\n00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,360\noverall project that you're\ngonna be contracting out.\n\n959\n00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,860\nIt needs to be very detailed because\nwhen you contract something out,\n\n960\n00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,850\nyou need to be specific.\n\n961\n00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,530\nIf there's room for\n\n962\n00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,710\ninterpretation, you may not get\nback what it is that you expected.\n\n963\n00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,700\nRight?\n\n964\n00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,590\nSo these should have all ready been\ndrafted in the planning phase, that's why\n\n965\n00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,080\ntheir input's here, but if they haven't\nbeen drafted, now's the time to do it.\n\n966\n00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,843\nYou draw up what you want\nthat contractor to do, and\n\n967\n00:45:42,843 --> 00:45:45,496\nthis is normally what becomes your RFPs,\nRFQs.\n\n968\n00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:47,854\nRight?\nYour statement of work is what you put\n\n969\n00:45:47,854 --> 00:45:48,450\nin there.\n\n970\n00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,370\nAnd you say Here's the work I need done.\n\n971\n00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,580\nHow much is it gonna cost?\n\n972\n00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,210\nRight?\n\n973\n00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,000\nHow fast can you get it done?\n\n974\n00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,680\nHow reliable.\n\n975\n00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,620\nGive me some references.\n\n976\n00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,390\nThat kind of stuff is what we tack onto\nthat document, but the most of it,\n\n977\n00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,442\nthe bulk of that document\nIs your statement of work.\n\n978\n00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:06,160\nAll right, so some of the things that\nwe'll have in there, at a minimum,\n\n979\n00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,305\nyour specifications.\n\n980\n00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:07,960\nRight?\n\n981\n00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,480\nWhat matches up with\nyour requirements list.\n\n982\n00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,350\nRight?\n\n983\n00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,300\nBut after that you want\nto punch in other things,\n\n984\n00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,185\nif it's a product the quantity desired.\n\n985\n00:46:17,185 --> 00:46:17,990\nRight?\n\n986\n00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,420\nWhether it's a product or\na service the quality levels,\n\n987\n00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,180\nhow you're going to measure whether or\nnot this is good enough for your customer.\n\n988\n00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,895\nPerformance data, period of performance,\nhow we're gonna measure that.\n\n989\n00:46:28,895 --> 00:46:31,540\nCuz you don't want to just say,\nall right, contractor do it and\n\n990\n00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,290\nhave it for me on the 31st.\n\n991\n00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,180\nAnd then you just don't talk to them for\nmonths and\n\n992\n00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,240\nthen on the 31st you check in,\nall right, where is it?\n\n993\n00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,060\nYou want to be monitoring it throughout.\n\n994\n00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,980\nSo how do we measure that performance?\n\n995\n00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,940\nWhere's the work gonna be done at?\n\n996\n00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,550\nDo they need to come to your office\nto do the work so you can monitor it?\n\n997\n00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,220\nOr are they gonna do it just\nat their office separately?\n\n998\n00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,110\nAll right?\n\n999\n00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,030\nAnd then any other requirements\nthat you might have as a result of\n\n1000\n00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:52,810\ndoing that contract.\n\n1001\n00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,421\n>> Yeah, what's clear for us in this\nstatement of work is that, notice that\n\n1002\n00:46:57,421 --> 00:47:01,080\nevery one of those requirements is\nsomething that is quantifiable.\n\n1003\n00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,520\nThat way, the actual seller knows\nhere's what needs to be done.\n\n1004\n00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,420\nHere's how we can prove that it's done.\n\n1005\n00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,108\nIt's not one of those well,\nI'll tell you when I get ready.\n\n1006\n00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:11,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Ideas here.\n\n1007\n00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,530\nSo every single one of these\nhere is truly quantifiable and\n\n1008\n00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,880\nthat's what we need to have here.\n\n1009\n00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,780\nSomething that there's no\nparticular wiggle room at all, and\n\n1010\n00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,100\nthat's why it's very important.\n\n1011\n00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,690\n>> Yeah, the last input is just\norganizational process assets.\n\n1012\n00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,360\nYou likely have drafted contracts, or\n\n1013\n00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,480\na procurement officer already in place\nin your company, and you leverage that.\n\n1014\n00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,710\nRight?\nYou leverage those resources.\n\n1015\n00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:32,540\nYou reach out.\nBut\n\n1016\n00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,230\nyou also have your historical projects,\n\n1017\n00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,700\nwhere other people have engaged\nin contract activities, and\n\n1018\n00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,080\nyou can use that to help determine\nwhich seller you go with.\n\n1019\n00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,624\nRight?\nHistorical performance is important.\n\n1020\n00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:41,670\n>> Yeah.\n\n1021\n00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,240\n>> We take all that and now we're\nready to conduct the procurement.\n\n1022\n00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,560\nConducting the procurement means actually\nsending out the RFQ's or RFP's or\n\n1023\n00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,550\nwhatever it is we're sending out.\n\n1024\n00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,890\nGetting back the results.\n\n1025\n00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:53,750\nSorting through them.\n\n1026\n00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:54,918\nScoring them.\nPicking the seller.\n\n1027\n00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:56,870\nRight?\nThese are the activities that we do when\n\n1028\n00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,410\nwe conduct the procurement.\n\n1029\n00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,760\nSo, some of the tools we've got,\na bidder conference.\n\n1030\n00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,746\nBidder conferences are really cool.\n\n1031\n00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:08,385\nWhen you send out RFPs and RFQs,\nthe bidders, the people responding back,\n\n1032\n00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,646\nthe sellers, they have questions.\n\n1033\n00:48:10,646 --> 00:48:11,248\n>> Yeah.\n\n1034\n00:48:11,248 --> 00:48:12,804\n>> They almost always have questions.\n\n1035\n00:48:12,804 --> 00:48:14,082\nIf they're good, they have questions.\n\n1036\n00:48:14,082 --> 00:48:16,460\nSo they come back and they say all right,\nwe read through that, how about this,\n\n1037\n00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,005\nthis, and this.\n\n1038\n00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:19,228\nWell if you're sending\nthis out to hundreds or\n\n1039\n00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:23,280\nthousands of prospective sellers,\nyou'll get a lot of questions back.\n\n1040\n00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,010\nSo sometimes it's faster just\nto have a better conference.\n\n1041\n00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:30,202\nSay, okay everybody, we're doing\na conference call Tuesday at 10 p.m.\n\n1042\n00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:30,720\nor 10 a.m.\n\n1043\n00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,140\nwhatever, I don't know why\nI picked the nighttime.\n\n1044\n00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,110\nAnd let's go ahead and\nfire up this call, and\n\n1045\n00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,220\njust everybody can ask their questions and\nget answers at the same time.\n\n1046\n00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,595\nThat's very convenient for\nyou as the purchaser, the procurer.\n\n1047\n00:48:42,595 --> 00:48:43,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1048\n00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,670\n>> But if you're the person who's bidding,\n\n1049\n00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,255\nyou get a chance to see who\nall the other bidders are.\n\n1050\n00:48:49,255 --> 00:48:51,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know what competition is out there,\n\n1051\n00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,530\nand that may not be\nsomething that you want.\n\n1052\n00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,631\n>> So, you know, it's up to you whether\na bidder conference is actually\n\n1053\n00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:56,690\nrealistic or not.\n\n1054\n00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,670\nIf you're the U.S. Government,\nbidder conferences work out great.\n\n1055\n00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,890\nIf you're a five person dentist office,\nbidder conferences aren't very realistic.\n\n1056\n00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,560\nSo, you know,\n\n1057\n00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,660\nit just depends on whether or not your\norganization is suitable for that.\n\n1058\n00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,990\nAll right?\nProposal evaluation techniques.\n\n1059\n00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,570\nWhen we get these proposals\nback from everybody how do we,\n\n1060\n00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,630\nhow do we know if they're good or bad?\n\n1061\n00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,880\nWell one of the best techniques is that,\n\n1062\n00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,330\nthat scoring matrix that I\nshowed you guys earlier.\n\n1063\n00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,070\nWe assign weights to our categories and\nthen we rank,\n\n1064\n00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:27,690\nwe score people based on\nthe information that they give you,\n\n1065\n00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:31,980\nso you can gauge that data based\non something that's quantifiable.\n\n1066\n00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,690\nSomething that you've predefined.\n\n1067\n00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,970\n>> Yeah, now this is again one\nof those important processes,\n\n1068\n00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:39,690\nespecially in the procurement area that\nwe make sure we judge them fairly.\n\n1069\n00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:40,300\nRight?\n\n1070\n00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,600\nI don't sit there and go, well,\nI know that I prefer this bidder and\n\n1071\n00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,870\nI start to actually do just these things\nthat I want them to score well on.\n\n1072\n00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:51,290\nThe formalized process in making sure\nthat we go through these techniques,\n\n1073\n00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,750\nreally does kind of even\nout the playing field, and\n\n1074\n00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,730\nit does show that while we're trying to\nselect this we're actually being fair.\n\n1075\n00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,280\nA very important process again.\n\n1076\n00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,110\n>> Yeah.\n\n1077\n00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:00,890\nAnother thing is independent estimates.\n\n1078\n00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:05,400\nIt is a good idea to get an estimate\nfrom more than one person.\n\n1079\n00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:05,920\nRight?\n\n1080\n00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,750\nAnd an area where I see this a lot is,\nyou'll go to an IT company,\n\n1081\n00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,090\nand maybe they have a project.\n\n1082\n00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,810\nAnd in the project they need\nto purchase 40 more servers.\n\n1083\n00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:16,350\nRight?\n\n1084\n00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:19,310\nWell, you go in their server room and\nit's all Dell.\n\n1085\n00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,069\nAll Dell servers.\n\n1086\n00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,220\nSo when they say they need\nto get 40 more servers,\n\n1087\n00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,220\nthey just go and\nget a quote from Dell and that's it.\n\n1088\n00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,940\nRight?\n\n1089\n00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,110\nWell, because they have all Dell servers,\nthat's what they want to do.\n\n1090\n00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,050\nIt's one vendor.\nYou can only buy directly from Dell,so\n\n1091\n00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,440\nit makes sense.\n\n1092\n00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,660\nBut, that may not be a competitive price.\n\n1093\n00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,940\nSo what you do is, you turn around and\nyou get quote from HP,\n\n1094\n00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,700\nor IBM, Lenovo, whatever.\n\n1095\n00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,750\nAnd you get a quote from them, too.\n\n1096\n00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,510\nNow you know you're not\ngonna purchase from them.\n\n1097\n00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:47,200\nBut you get a quote from them,\ntoo to provide service of the same grade.\n\n1098\n00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,760\nAnd if they're able to come\nin under Dell's price,\n\n1099\n00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,570\nthat becomes part of your bargaining,\nyour negotiation power.\n\n1100\n00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:56,570\nAnd you reach out to Dell and you say hey,\nif we were to switch to HP, we'd save\n\n1101\n00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,320\nthis much money, and I can guarantee\nyou Dell will come down on their price.\n\n1102\n00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,650\nSo even if you only have one\nseller you wanna do business with,\n\n1103\n00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,320\nyou still wanna get\nestimates from other people.\n\n1104\n00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,410\nIf for no other reason than to use it for\nnegotiations, right?\n\n1105\n00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,190\nBut oftentimes when you get\nestimates from different people,\n\n1106\n00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,020\nyou'll find that they\ncan vary quite a bit.\n\n1107\n00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,270\nAnd so it helps you to do these\nsix-point estimates, right.\n\n1108\n00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,700\nOr three point, where you've got\nthe pessimistic, optimistic, and\n\n1109\n00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,390\nmost likely, so\nyou can start to do those calculations.\n\n1110\n00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:30,230\nAll right, expert judgement, it's always a\ngood idea to have a subject matter expert,\n\n1111\n00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,300\nor use your noodle is\nwhat I usually say here,\n\n1112\n00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,790\nto gauge the information that's coming in.\n\n1113\n00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:40,440\nAdvertising is another technique,\nwith the RFP's, RFQ's, RFB's,\n\n1114\n00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,740\nall those things, I mentioned you're going\nto send them out to prospective sellers.\n\n1115\n00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,650\nWell, do you know all\nthe sellers that are out there?\n\n1116\n00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:49,430\nProbably not.\n\n1117\n00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:52,890\nSo, you might wanna do an advertisement\nto say hey, we're looking for this.\n\n1118\n00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,380\nWe're looking for a person or company that\ncan come in and develop this website.\n\n1119\n00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,940\nThen you might find that there's other\nsellers out there that you hadn't even\n\n1120\n00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,580\nheard of, that see the advertisement and\ncome in that way.\n\n1121\n00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,450\nYou have a lot of that going on today in\nthe IT world, because you've got these\n\n1122\n00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:11,960\nwebsites like freelancer.com and,\nwhat are some of the other bigger names?\n\n1123\n00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,400\nFreelancer's probably the biggest one, but\n\n1124\n00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,610\nthere's several others where you\ncan quickly get contract work.\n\n1125\n00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,920\nAnalytical techniques, right?\n\n1126\n00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,030\nWays that we analyze the data and\nbreak it down.\n\n1127\n00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,090\nDo they actually call out\nany specific techniques?\n\n1128\n00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,520\n>> No, not one specific one.\n\n1129\n00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,190\nThey just describe it.\n\n1130\n00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,910\n>> Okay.\nJust in general, okay.\n\n1131\n00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,270\nSo yeah, analytic techniques,\n\n1132\n00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:34,980\nthat's just our method for\nanalyzing that data and breaking it down.\n\n1133\n00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,970\nWe use that really as part\nof our proposal evaluation.\n\n1134\n00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:44,010\nAnd then the last one is just\nprocurement negotiations,\n\n1135\n00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:49,790\nwhich is when you get that initial\nproposal that may not be the final number.\n\n1136\n00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:50,980\nRight?\nYou start to negotiate, and\n\n1137\n00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,750\nyou might be negotiating on price.\n\n1138\n00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,160\nYou might be negotiating on requirements.\n\n1139\n00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,800\nIn your request, you might have said,\nwe need this done by September 12th.\n\n1140\n00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,620\nAnd they come back and they say, well we\ncan do it and we can do it cheap, but\n\n1141\n00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,840\nwe can only do it by September 30th.\n\n1142\n00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,050\nIs that okay?\n\n1143\n00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,620\nNow we start negotiating.\n\n1144\n00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,480\nWhat's the date that we can get it\ndown to to make things effective.\n\n1145\n00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,490\nYou may have a professional\nnegotiator on your staff,\n\n1146\n00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,080\nyou may have to do it yourself.\n\n1147\n00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,760\nAs a project manager, that's not uncommon.\n\n1148\n00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,150\n>> A lot of times, this particular idea,\nthe procurement of negotiation, really\n\n1149\n00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:28,710\ndoes happen before that final contract\nis actually signed and cemented in here.\n\n1150\n00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:33,340\nSo that way you know, before we sign\neverything, here's all the final things\n\n1151\n00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,330\nafter we've kind of adjusted everything,\nthat we're gonna agree to, so\n\n1152\n00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:39,760\na very last important process before\nyou actually do procure anything.\n\n1153\n00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,150\nYeah.\n\n1154\n00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:45,010\nAnd after that, we're pretty\nmuch done dealing with our data.\n\n1155\n00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,100\nNow we're ready to move\nforward with the procurement.\n\n1156\n00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,760\nSo our outputs here, the main output\nis the selected seller, right?\n\n1157\n00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,660\n>> Right.\n>> Who's the winner?\n\n1158\n00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,670\nWho do we decide to go ahead and\npurchase through?\n\n1159\n00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,240\nRight?\n\n1160\n00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,500\nAnd we always want to document\nhow we made that decision, so\n\n1161\n00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,960\nthe supporting paperwork,\n\n1162\n00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,230\nthe supporting paperwork becomes part of\nour project documents updates, right?\n\n1163\n00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,450\nWe add that to our project history.\n\n1164\n00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,870\nWe also have the agreement itself, right?\n\n1165\n00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,780\nThe agreement is usually a contract, but\nit might just be a written statement or\n\n1166\n00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,050\nsomething like that.\n\n1167\n00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,200\nTypically it's a contract, though.\n\n1168\n00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,900\nIt says what work is going to be done.\n\n1169\n00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,270\nAnd the agreement, well,\nit should be terminated, right?\n\n1170\n00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:21,130\nSo we should actually have it signed\noff on and then it's active and\n\n1171\n00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,410\nit's ready to rock on whatever\ndates were specified.\n\n1172\n00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,580\nNow, on the agreement side,\nlet me bring it up.\n\n1173\n00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,610\n>> There's a lot.\n>> There is a lot.\n\n1174\n00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:28,690\nWhere is that in the mix?\n\n1175\n00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:29,890\n>> Right there.\n>> Here we go.\n\n1176\n00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:32,985\nSo the agreement is going to\ncontain a number of things.\n\n1177\n00:54:32,985 --> 00:54:35,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It can be very small, but\n\n1178\n00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,760\nthe more detail, the better.\n\n1179\n00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,740\nWhen you're dealing with a contract,\nyou need no room for debate.\n\n1180\n00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,180\nNo inconsistency.\n\n1181\n00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,990\nIt needs to be well defined\nof what you expect.\n\n1182\n00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,030\nBlack and white.\n\n1183\n00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,160\nClear as day.\n\n1184\n00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,070\nSo we want to have things like,\nseller's place of performance.\n\n1185\n00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,460\nHow we measure their performance.\n\n1186\n00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:58,050\nThat we know that they are actually\ngetting the work done as we specified.\n\n1187\n00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,420\nTheir pricing and payment terms.\n\n1188\n00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,950\nNow payment terms is important.\n\n1189\n00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,530\nIf you agree that you're\ngonna pay $50,000 for\n\n1190\n00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:07,780\nthis project,\nwhen do they want the money, right?\n\n1191\n00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:11,050\nIs there a charge up front,\nlike 50% up front?\n\n1192\n00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:15,200\nAre there installments paid throughout\nwhile the work is getting done, pay for\n\n1193\n00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,090\nperformance?\n\n1194\n00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:20,660\nOr is it a flat fee paid net\n60 at the end of the contract?\n\n1195\n00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,790\nSo, how is that going to be defined?\n\n1196\n00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,630\nThat's important, because you need to\nmake sure you pay your contractors.\n\n1197\n00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:29,500\nIf you don't pay a contractor,\nall of a sudden their work stops and\n\n1198\n00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,040\nyou shoot your schedule, right.\n\n1199\n00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,610\nThat's definitely not\nsomething you wanna do.\n\n1200\n00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,070\nSo that needs to be in the contract.\n\n1201\n00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,500\nA place of delivery.\n\n1202\n00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,940\nWhen they actually have the delivery,\nwhen they've created whatever it is you're\n\n1203\n00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,350\nexpecting them to create,\nare they delivering it?\n\n1204\n00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:43,490\nDo you have to go and get it?\n\n1205\n00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:45,290\nHow is that information kind of flow?\n\n1206\n00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,240\nInspection and acceptance criteria.\n\n1207\n00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,160\nWhen the contractor tells you\nthe job is done, that's nice, but\n\n1208\n00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,300\nit doesn't mean anything.\n\n1209\n00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,050\nRight.\n\n1210\n00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,910\nYou have to decide if the job is done.\n\n1211\n00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:59,090\nAnd only when you're both in\nagreement that the job is done,\n\n1212\n00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,700\nis it actually considered done.\n\n1213\n00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,950\nWell, what if there's a difference.\n\n1214\n00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,750\nWhat if I told Ronnie, hey Ronnie,\nI was gonna lay the foundation for\n\n1215\n00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,790\nyou and it's done.\n\n1216\n00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:08,328\n>> Right.\n>> And you look at it and you say,\n\n1217\n00:56:08,328 --> 00:56:11,797\nwell the foundation's not dry yet,\nand so when it dries, it might crack.\n\n1218\n00:56:11,797 --> 00:56:12,914\nSo it's not done.\n\n1219\n00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:13,516\n>> Right.\n\n1220\n00:56:13,516 --> 00:56:14,563\n>> Now we're in a debate.\n\n1221\n00:56:14,563 --> 00:56:16,232\nAnd I'm saying, hey,\nit's done, where's my money?\n\n1222\n00:56:16,232 --> 00:56:19,630\nAnd you say, well, it's not done, right?\n\n1223\n00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,270\nSo, how do we establish that?\n\n1224\n00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:24,520\nWell, the acceptance criteria\nis what defines that, and\n\n1225\n00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,680\nif, in my acceptance criteria, I didn't\nspecify the foundation needed to be dry,\n\n1226\n00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,980\nif I say, the foundation needed to\nbe poured, right, well, it's done.\n\n1227\n00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,960\nYou didn't put it in the contract.\n\n1228\n00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,440\nI should get paid.\n\n1229\n00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,210\nBut if it was specified in\nthere that it had to dry and\n\n1230\n00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:43,580\ncracks needed to be repaired,\nwell then I'm wrong, and we need to wait.\n\n1231\n00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,260\nSo that acceptance criteria\nis really important.\n\n1232\n00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,040\nIt's basically a check list of what needs\nto be met, what should have been achieved,\n\n1233\n00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,790\nfor this to be considered done.\n\n1234\n00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,690\nAnd if there's disagreement,\nit doesn't matter, as long as that stuff\n\n1235\n00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:58,880\nhas been met, as long as we met the terms\nof the contract, it's done, and\n\n1236\n00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,540\nif it does go to litigation or mitigation,\nif you go to court or whatever, that\n\n1237\n00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,120\nit's clear as day, right there, whether or\nnot you met the terms as specified.\n\n1238\n00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,760\nNow there is acting in good faith, so,\n\n1239\n00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,020\nyou know, you do have the spirit of\nthe contract that needs to be met, but\n\n1240\n00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,590\nwhat's in black and\nwhite is really what stands up in court.\n\n1241\n00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:21,150\nA lot of contracts will\ncontain a warranty, okay.\n\n1242\n00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:24,120\nWhere the work is warranted for\na certain period of time or\n\n1243\n00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,550\na certain level of quality.\n\n1244\n00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:30,480\nSo if we pour the foundation and it's wet,\nwe might chose to say that's done,\n\n1245\n00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,520\nI get paid, but\nI'll do a warranty on it for 90 days and\n\n1246\n00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,720\nif something goes wrong with that\nfoundation in 90 days, I'll fix it.\n\n1247\n00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,020\nSo that way I don't have to wait for\nit to dry to get paid.\n\n1248\n00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,230\nBut at the same time,\nyou don't have to worry about it,\n\n1249\n00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,640\nbecause I'll fix it in the next 90 days.\n\n1250\n00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,030\nThere are a number of\ndifferent types of warranties.\n\n1251\n00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:49,325\nDid we talk about those?\n\n1252\n00:57:49,325 --> 00:57:49,849\n>> We did.\n\n1253\n00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:53,710\n>> Oh, that's right,\nin the planning phase, because we have\n\n1254\n00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:58,460\nthe express warranties and things like\nthat, that kind of come into play there,\n\n1255\n00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,910\nso your contract will have one of\nthe various types of warranties in it.\n\n1256\n00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,550\nOr it might not have any warranty at all.\n\n1257\n00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,210\nThat's not uncommon.\n\n1258\n00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,310\nProduct support.\n\n1259\n00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:11,080\nAfter the product or service has been\ndelivered what support do we get?\n\n1260\n00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:11,710\nMaybe none.\n\n1261\n00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:12,890\nMaybe this is a cut and dry.\n\n1262\n00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,205\nYou get somebody to do the work work and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n1263\n00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:20,375\nOr maybe you have some kind of\nongoing agreement that's in place.\n\n1264\n00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,645\nSo you get routine support added on.\n\n1265\n00:58:22,645 --> 00:58:24,605\nThat needs to be defined\nin the contract too.\n\n1266\n00:58:24,605 --> 00:58:25,875\nOr in a follow up contract.\n\n1267\n00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:29,370\nYou might actually have the initial\ncontract for getting the work done, and\n\n1268\n00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,750\nthen a separate service\ncontract that you maintain.\n\n1269\n00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,700\nThat's not unusual.\n\n1270\n00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,170\nAll right, limitation of liability.\n\n1271\n00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,990\nI can't remember the last time I saw\na contract that didn't have some kind of\n\n1272\n00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:44,720\nlimitation of liability in it, which is\nsaying, hey, we'll pour the foundation for\n\n1273\n00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,340\nyou but later on if you drive a tractor\non it and it cracks that's not our fault.\n\n1274\n00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,580\nOr if somebody trips on the foundation and\nbreaks their head that's not our fault.\n\n1275\n00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,790\nWe poured it, we did what we said.\n\n1276\n00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:57,660\nNow we're done, our liability is over.\n\n1277\n00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,340\nLiability goes two ways.\n\n1278\n00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,980\nThere's liabilities on\nthe purchaser's side and\n\n1279\n00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,850\nthere's liability on the seller side.\n\n1280\n00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:06,910\nSo we want to make sure that\nthere's limitations for both.\n\n1281\n00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,970\nYou'll see things like\nindemnity clauses and\n\n1282\n00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:12,450\nother things in the contract that are all\nkind of centered around limiting your\n\n1283\n00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:16,170\nlegal liability in the event\nthat something happens.\n\n1284\n00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:17,710\nFees and retainer.\n\n1285\n00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:19,960\nWhen you hire somebody to be a contractor,\n\n1286\n00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,370\nif you're doing the select seller process,\nyou will probably secure that seller\n\n1287\n00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:26,990\nwell in advance of the actual\nactivity needing to be done.\n\n1288\n00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:32,770\nSo I need drywallers to come in in\nJuly to put drywall in this house.\n\n1289\n00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,630\nBut right now it's only March,\nso I'm booking them in advance.\n\n1290\n00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,360\nSo there might be a retainer\nthat I need to pay.\n\n1291\n00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,890\nOr a deposit, a reservations, whatever, to\nmake sure that they will be available for\n\n1292\n00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,880\nme at that time,\ncuz what if I cancel a month from now?\n\n1293\n00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,083\nWell they blocked out\na spot in their schedule,\n\n1294\n00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:50,188\nnow they got to find\nsomebody else to fill it.\n\n1295\n00:59:50,188 --> 00:59:53,750\nSo that hurts them, so\na deposit is not an unreasonable request.\n\n1296\n00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,700\nPenalties and incentives,\nthose are pretty important.\n\n1297\n00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,630\nWhen you do a contract,\nthere is a legal obligation for\n\n1298\n01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:04,810\npeople to complete the contract, and\nyou would think that is enough, right?\n\n1299\n01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:09,262\nThat people would do the contract, but\nin construction you see it all the time.\n\n1300\n01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:13,798\nThey go over schedule,\nit's just commonplace, road work.\n\n1301\n01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:17,470\nWhat's that city that's west of here?\n\n1302\n01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,420\nPulaka.\n\n1303\n01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,750\nSo we're in Gainesville Florida, and\n\n1304\n01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,160\nthere's this city,\nI almost said a little city,\n\n1305\n01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,360\nI think it's bigger than Gainesville,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1306\n01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,440\n>> It's a pretty decent size city, and\n\n1307\n01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,130\nthey had a road work project scheduled\nthat was supposed to take ten months,\n\n1308\n01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:33,020\nwell it ended up taking four years.\n\n1309\n01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:37,580\nAnd the reason was the company that\noriginally bid it, they under bid and\n\n1310\n01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,050\nthey ran out of money, and\n\n1311\n01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:43,140\nthey just had all sorts of problems,\nand it ran super way over schedule.\n\n1312\n01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,948\nFinally the state had to step in and\nfinish the project, so\n\n1313\n01:00:45,948 --> 01:00:47,160\nit was an absolute mess.\n\n1314\n01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:52,280\nWell, the problem with a lot of\ncontracts is they center around cost.\n\n1315\n01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,596\nAnd so this paving company had cut\ntheir budget so low to win the bid,\n\n1316\n01:00:56,596 --> 01:01:00,154\nthat in the end,\nthey made it where it was impossible for\n\n1317\n01:01:00,154 --> 01:01:03,480\nthem to go and\nactually complete the project.\n\n1318\n01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,240\nSo, it's not necessarily\nthe greatest idea to fixate on cost.\n\n1319\n01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,510\nAnd, in fact, we might want to increase\nour cost by introducing incentives.\n\n1320\n01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:15,160\nIncentives say, hey,\nwe really need this done by July 31st, but\n\n1321\n01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:20,160\nif you finish on July 1st,\nwe'll pay you an extra 10%.\n\n1322\n01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:25,010\nWe will incentivize you to\nfinish early if you can, or\n\n1323\n01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,870\nif you come in under budget or\nsomething like that.\n\n1324\n01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:29,745\nIf you can find a better way\nto do this that saves money,\n\n1325\n01:01:29,745 --> 01:01:32,630\nwe'll split the difference 50/50,\nor whatever, right?\n\n1326\n01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,110\nThose are incentives.\n\n1327\n01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:40,100\nPenalties are to say hey, if you don't\nmeet this deadline, you have to pay us,\n\n1328\n01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,240\nor we don't have to pay you, or\nsomething of that nature, right?\n\n1329\n01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,860\nUsually you're saying you have to pay\nus is not a good idea because if their\n\n1330\n01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,650\nmissing their deadline it's probably\nbecause they're already out of money.\n\n1331\n01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:52,260\nAnd if you say they have to pay you you'll\nprobably just run them bankrupt and\n\n1332\n01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,040\nthen you don't end up anywhere.\n\n1333\n01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,650\nSo normally the penalty should simply\nbe that you don't have to pay them, and\n\n1334\n01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,060\nthat way you can go and\nbring in somebody else to fix it up.\n\n1335\n01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:05,090\nIf it's construction work,\nespecially, you'll have insurance and\n\n1336\n01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,060\nperformance bonds.\n\n1337\n01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,520\nYou may have things\nlicensed with the state.\n\n1338\n01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,904\nIt depends on your municipality, and what\ntheir requirements, what their rules and\n\n1339\n01:02:12,904 --> 01:02:13,660\nregulations are.\n\n1340\n01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:20,210\nThis is one that gets overlooked a lot,\nsubordinate subcontractor approvals.\n\n1341\n01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:25,040\nIn IT, it is commonplace for\nyou to hire a contractor, and\n\n1342\n01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,250\nthen that contractor can turn around and\nsubcontract it out to somebody else.\n\n1343\n01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,970\nThe problem with that is,\nyou don't know who that subcontractor is.\n\n1344\n01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,030\nYou didn't interact with them.\n\n1345\n01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,950\nYou weren't involved in that process.\n\n1346\n01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,545\nSo you may want to specifically\nstate in your statement of work,\n\n1347\n01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:37,740\nthat that's not allowed.\n\n1348\n01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,280\nThat you do not want to have that,\nor if they do it,\n\n1349\n01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,770\nthey've got to get it approved by you,\nright.\n\n1350\n01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,430\nI have a friend, Bill,\nwho lives in Orlando, and\n\n1351\n01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:51,490\nhe's a programmer, and\nhe bid on a contract.\n\n1352\n01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:52,641\nThis was years and years ago.\n\n1353\n01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:56,210\nThat it was for\ndeveloping software to do bus routes.\n\n1354\n01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:59,780\nAnd he knew he could write it, but they\nneeded it in a certain amount of time that\n\n1355\n01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,220\nhe just didn't have the time to do it.\n\n1356\n01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,220\nSo he bid anyway, and he won the bid.\n\n1357\n01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,420\nAnd I don't remember the exact amount,\nI think it was like $60,000.\n\n1358\n01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:10,665\nAnd then he turned around and\nhe subbed it out to another developer for\n\n1359\n01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:14,890\n$20,000 and that developer wrote all\nthe software and deployed it, sold it.\n\n1360\n01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:18,390\nSo the buyer got what they wanted and\nBill,\n\n1361\n01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:22,040\nwell he made $40,000 for\nnot doing anything, he just subbed it out.\n\n1362\n01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:22,970\nIt worked out.\n\n1363\n01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:27,670\nSo its not that there's always a negative\nside to that, but there was risk.\n\n1364\n01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,320\nNow Bill was taking that risk.\n\n1365\n01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:33,310\nIf that sub didn't deliver on what they\npromised, he was the one left holding\n\n1366\n01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,886\nthe bag, but he knew he could\nwrite the software if he had to.\n\n1367\n01:03:35,886 --> 01:03:38,290\nSo, pros and cons of that,\n\n1368\n01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:41,070\nthere's a lot of risk involved,\nyou may want to prevent it.\n\n1369\n01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,120\nI usually do.\n\n1370\n01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,780\nSo you put in there an approval or\na forbiddance.\n\n1371\n01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,270\nYou just say you can't sub it out,\nwe contracted with you, you do the work.\n\n1372\n01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:51,940\nBut you want them to be able\nto get help if they need it.\n\n1373\n01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,900\nSo if they do use a sub, you just make\nsure you're involved in the process.\n\n1374\n01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,240\nChange requests.\n\n1375\n01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:03,110\nEven in the best laid plans, right,\nthings can happen that weren't planned.\n\n1376\n01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:07,462\nAnd so, you may need to change the terms\nof the contract to add new requirements,\n\n1377\n01:04:07,462 --> 01:04:10,790\nor the company that's the seller,\nright, they might need to\n\n1378\n01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:14,375\nchange the contract based on some\nelement that wasn't foreseen.\n\n1379\n01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,747\nWe need a process for that.\n\n1380\n01:04:15,747 --> 01:04:17,742\nYou never wanna just say,\nnope, this is set in stone.\n\n1381\n01:04:17,742 --> 01:04:19,110\nYou're going to deliver on this.\n\n1382\n01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,180\nI don't care what happened, right?\n\n1383\n01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:24,210\nThat's not gonna build a good relationship\nbetween you and the contractor.\n\n1384\n01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:26,270\nAnd it's gonna lessen\nyour odds of success.\n\n1385\n01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,280\nSo, we wanna have a change mechanism.\n\n1386\n01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,370\nIt may actually be a good thing.\n\n1387\n01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:32,270\nIt may be something you wanna add, and\nyou're willing to pay more money for it or\n\n1388\n01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:32,910\nadjust the schedule.\n\n1389\n01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,150\nSo you need a way to be able\nto change that contract.\n\n1390\n01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:38,230\nOtherwise, you have to invalidate\nthe contract and draft a whole new one.\n\n1391\n01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:41,150\nSo, build your change\nrequest process into there.\n\n1392\n01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,210\nAnd we've got change request coming up in\na future episode, we'll get into that.\n\n1393\n01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,150\nAnd then lastly, termination clauses.\n\n1394\n01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,820\nHow do we know when the contract is done,\nright?\n\n1395\n01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,570\nIt's signed off.\n\n1396\n01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:52,845\nThe work has been delivered.\n\n1397\n01:04:52,845 --> 01:04:54,130\nNow it's over.\n\n1398\n01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,220\nAnd I used the wrong term earlier,\nI said terminated.\n\n1399\n01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:00,655\nSo, when we talk about contracts,\nan executed contract is one that we've\n\n1400\n01:05:00,655 --> 01:05:05,750\nsigned off on that is ready to run,\nright, that is ready to go.\n\n1401\n01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:08,600\nA terminated contract is one\nthat's completed, right.\n\n1402\n01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,850\nSo executed means it's basically started,\nand then terminated means it's done.\n\n1403\n01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,130\nSo, a termination clause,\nit's not normally saying, hey,\n\n1404\n01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,070\nthe project is done the way we wanted,\nright?\n\n1405\n01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,053\nThat's just we met our acceptance\ncriteria right here, but\n\n1406\n01:05:22,053 --> 01:05:25,579\ntermination is usually early termination,\nright.\n\n1407\n01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:27,504\nWe had a three year contract.\n\n1408\n01:05:27,504 --> 01:05:31,290\nWe're in year two, and it's become obvious\nthat you can't complete this contract.\n\n1409\n01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:34,290\nSo, there's no point going\nthe rest of the way to year three.\n\n1410\n01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,599\nWe might as well terminate now, okay.\n\n1411\n01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,310\nSo you may have mechanisms,\n\n1412\n01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:41,930\ntermination clauses built in that\nsay we do performance reports.\n\n1413\n01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:45,213\nAnd if three performance\nbenchmarks aren't hit in a row,\n\n1414\n01:05:45,213 --> 01:05:47,495\nthe contract gets terminated, right.\n\n1415\n01:05:47,495 --> 01:05:48,580\nSo you may wanna have that.\n\n1416\n01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:52,440\nYou may also have alternative\ndispute resolution, ADR.\n\n1417\n01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,780\nThat's usually gonna be like a mitigator.\n\n1418\n01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,765\nYou might bring in a, well,\nwhat's the other word for that?\n\n1419\n01:05:57,765 --> 01:05:59,240\nA mitigator.\n\n1420\n01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,200\n>> Mediator.\n>> Mediator!\n\n1421\n01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:00,940\nThere we go.\n\n1422\n01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:03,930\nA mediator that can come in and\ntalk to the two parties and\n\n1423\n01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,060\ntry to work things out,\ntry to get things in line.\n\n1424\n01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,900\nSo you may have back-up plans, right.\n\n1425\n01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:11,753\nAnd those kind of things can be\nbuilt into the contract too.\n\n1426\n01:06:11,753 --> 01:06:16,530\nAll right, so quite a bit of stuff,\nall inside of that statement of work.\n\n1427\n01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:20,250\nThe important piece there is just to\nremember to be very, very thorough.\n\n1428\n01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,841\nThe more detailed,\nthe safer your contract will be.\n\n1429\n01:06:23,841 --> 01:06:25,906\nAll right, now we still have some\nmore stuff I was hoping to get\n\n1430\n01:06:25,906 --> 01:06:26,720\nthrough this segment.\n\n1431\n01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,495\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1432\n01:06:27,495 --> 01:06:30,340\nI know we've already shot past our\nlittle marker on the clock there.\n\n1433\n01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,800\nSo, let's stop and take a break.\n\n1434\n01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,310\nWhen we get back, we'll continue on and\nwrap up procurements.\n\n1435\n01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:36,330\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1436\n01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,935\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1437\n01:06:38,935 --> 01:06:42,387\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1438\n01:06:42,387 --> 01:06:47,457\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1439\n01:06:47,457 --> 01:06:51,009\nSo, now we're just gonna wrap up a few\nof the last outputs that we have for\n\n1440\n01:06:51,009 --> 01:06:52,660\nprocurement management.\n\n1441\n01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,590\nWe got through selected sellers and\nthe agreements, right,\n\n1442\n01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:58,380\nand I didn't realize how\nlong I talked there.\n\n1443\n01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:02,230\nSo sorry,\nwe went way over the time on that one.\n\n1444\n01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:04,850\nBut our next one is resource calendars,\nall right?\n\n1445\n01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:07,203\nResource calendars are really important.\n\n1446\n01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:11,202\nIf you're contracting or bringing in\ncontractors, right, bringing in people,\n\n1447\n01:07:11,202 --> 01:07:14,300\npersonnel, right,\nthose resources have a calendar, right?\n\n1448\n01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:18,120\nYou might have those drywall\ninstallers that are available for\n\n1449\n01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,219\ntwo weeks at the end of May, all right.\n\n1450\n01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,850\nSo that's it, that's their calendar.\n\n1451\n01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:28,080\nIf you have activities to get done ahead\nof schedule, well, it doesn't matter.\n\n1452\n01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,640\nThe drywallers aren't able to work\nuntil those last two weeks of May.\n\n1453\n01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:35,399\nSo your project may have to sit idle while\nyou wait on those weeks to roll around.\n\n1454\n01:07:35,399 --> 01:07:38,713\nSo we need to know that because\nwhen we put them into our schedule,\n\n1455\n01:07:38,713 --> 01:07:42,635\nyou remember we talked about the schedule\nactivity relationships, right,\n\n1456\n01:07:42,635 --> 01:07:45,155\nthat you have finish to start and\nstart to start.\n\n1457\n01:07:45,155 --> 01:07:49,480\nAnd then you have constraints attached\nto them, so start no later than,\n\n1458\n01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,420\nstart no earlier than, or so on.\n\n1459\n01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,035\nWhen you deal with contractors,\n\n1460\n01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:56,660\noftentimes they give you a fixed\nwindow that is not movable.\n\n1461\n01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,211\nIt's a constrained activity.\n\n1462\n01:07:59,211 --> 01:08:02,752\nAnd the reason they do that is they've\ngot other companies they're working with\n\n1463\n01:08:02,752 --> 01:08:04,300\nbefore and after you.\n\n1464\n01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,690\nSo, we need to make sure we have\nresource calendars for that.\n\n1465\n01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:11,190\nIf we're renting equipment,\nthe same thing goes true, right?\n\n1466\n01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:15,130\nIf you have to rent a moving truck\nas part of your project, well,\n\n1467\n01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:17,820\nyou've only got that truck available for\na certain window of time.\n\n1468\n01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:21,090\nIf you fall behind schedule,\nyou already rented that truck.\n\n1469\n01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,900\nYou have to pay for it, and\nnow you've gotta pay for\n\n1470\n01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,100\nit again when you're actually ready for\nit.\n\n1471\n01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,033\nSo we need to have that\nschedule defined for\n\n1472\n01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:28,974\nwhatever it is that we're doing, right.\n\n1473\n01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:32,080\nAnd here we're not talking about\nthe schedule of the contract,\n\n1474\n01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,950\nwhen the contract starts or when the\ncontract finishes, what you pay out when.\n\n1475\n01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,273\nWe're not talking about that.\n\n1476\n01:08:37,273 --> 01:08:39,454\nWe're talking about the actual resources,\nthe personnel and\n\n1477\n01:08:39,454 --> 01:08:41,522\nequipment that's involved in\nperforming that activity.\n\n1478\n01:08:41,522 --> 01:08:46,203\nAll right, now project management\nupdates and project document updates,\n\n1479\n01:08:46,203 --> 01:08:50,240\nthere's a lot of other information\nthat can come out on this one.\n\n1480\n01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,500\nAnd Ronnie, you kind of laid out a lot\nof that stuff in the notes here.\n\n1481\n01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,430\nBut you'll see,\n\n1482\n01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:58,070\nour cost base line is probably the one\nthat gets affected the most, right.\n\n1483\n01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:00,180\nBecause when we get these quotes back,\n\n1484\n01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:04,040\nwhen we pick our seller, we might not know\nactually how much it's going to cost.\n\n1485\n01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:08,250\nSo, back in the earliest parts of\nthe planning phase, we might have had\n\n1486\n01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,700\na subject matter expert come in and say,\noh, you want to get a foundation laid?\n\n1487\n01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,730\nWell, it normally costs\nabout $20 per square foot.\n\n1488\n01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:18,930\nAnd so we work out what the house's\nsquare footage is going to be,\n\n1489\n01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:22,460\nwe multiply it by $20,\nand that's our estimate.\n\n1490\n01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:26,490\nWell, when we go out and do our request\nfor quotes and we get actual quotes and\n\n1491\n01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:28,920\nproposals back,\nit's not an estimate anymore.\n\n1492\n01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,690\nIt's a quote.\n\n1493\n01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:31,990\nThis is what they're gonna\ncharge to get the work done.\n\n1494\n01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:35,900\nIt may be under what we budgeted,\nwhich would be great.\n\n1495\n01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,290\nIt might be over what we budgeted.\n\n1496\n01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,780\nIt's rarely dead on, right.\n\n1497\n01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:41,820\nIt does happen, I suppose,\nbut rarely does it happen.\n\n1498\n01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:43,320\nNormally it's gonna be above or below.\n\n1499\n01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:47,050\nWell, if it's below does that\nmean I'm now under budget?\n\n1500\n01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,110\nNo, unfortunately, it doesn't.\n\n1501\n01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:49,920\nAnd if it's above,\ndoes it mean I'm over budget?\n\n1502\n01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,990\nWell, if we didn't\ncorrect things it would.\n\n1503\n01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:55,300\nBut what we normally do is\nimmediately create change tickets,\n\n1504\n01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,900\nchange requests,\nto say now that I've got the quote,\n\n1505\n01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:03,760\nI need to adjust the cost of that\nactivity to match the quote, all right?\n\n1506\n01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,040\nIf it was less than what you\nplanned on paying before,\n\n1507\n01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,240\nsome people like to leave it that way.\n\n1508\n01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:09,950\nLeave it there so\n\n1509\n01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:13,640\nwe save money which gives us padding in\ncase something else goes over, all right.\n\n1510\n01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,570\nThat's the instinct.\n\n1511\n01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,720\nThat's what a lot of companies encourage.\n\n1512\n01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,995\nOn the exam, that's bad, all right.\n\n1513\n01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:20,230\nThat's impropriety.\n\n1514\n01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:22,310\nYou are lying about the numbers, right?\n\n1515\n01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:24,220\nSo, when you get that new number in,\n\n1516\n01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,550\nyou need to do a change\nticket to correct for it.\n\n1517\n01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:30,960\nIf you've got padded money in your budget,\nin your schedule, you've got padded time\n\n1518\n01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,770\nin your schedule, those are supposed\nto be part of the reserve, right.\n\n1519\n01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,340\nAnd getting a lower quote than\nwhat you were originally budgeted,\n\n1520\n01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,370\nthat doesn't create a built-in reserve.\n\n1521\n01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:41,510\nIt creates a bad estimate\nthat you're acting on.\n\n1522\n01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:43,630\nYou're still acting on that\nbad estimate from before,\n\n1523\n01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:46,400\neven though you now have a quote\nthat shows the actual value.\n\n1524\n01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,800\nSo, you will do a change request to\nreflect the new cost cuz we know that,\n\n1525\n01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,810\nthe new schedule, right,\nthat schedule baseline.\n\n1526\n01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,990\nNow we know the timing,\nhow long it's gonna take.\n\n1527\n01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:59,660\nWe had an estimate before.\n\n1528\n01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:02,430\nNow we've got a quote,\nnow we've got an actual contract.\n\n1529\n01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:07,670\nNow they call out a scope baseline also,\nchanges to the scope.\n\n1530\n01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:12,100\nWell, hopefully when you draw up\nyour statement of work asking for\n\n1531\n01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:17,370\ncertain services to be provided, they come\nat you and offer exactly what you want.\n\n1532\n01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:20,510\nAnd as a result we don't have to update\nour scope baseline at all, right.\n\n1533\n01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:24,190\nIt's gonna be done exactly the way\nwe want it, and that's it.\n\n1534\n01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:28,290\nBut if you do RFP's, request for\nproposals, they might propose things to\n\n1535\n01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:31,570\nyou that you didn't know about,\nthings that you weren't aware about.\n\n1536\n01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:34,490\nSome of your requirements\nmight negate each other, or\n\n1537\n01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,930\nmight not be possible together, all right?\n\n1538\n01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:40,590\nAnd in that scenario, you might need\nto adjust your scope as a result.\n\n1539\n01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:45,980\nSo, maybe for example you said\nthat you want to build a house.\n\n1540\n01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:48,540\nI'm trying to think of an example\nreal fast in my mind here.\n\n1541\n01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,240\nAnd you wanna have an attached garage.\n\n1542\n01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,840\nBut you also want it to be an A-frame\nstyle house that's up on stilts,\n\n1543\n01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,360\nmaybe it's on the beach, right?\n\n1544\n01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:00,554\nAnd they come back and they say, well, if\nyou're having a house built up on stilts,\n\n1545\n01:12:00,554 --> 01:12:02,519\nyou can't put the garage up on stilts.\n\n1546\n01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:05,019\nSo it's gotta be down on the ground so\nit can't be a attached.\n\n1547\n01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:07,374\nSo, you gotta make a choice here.\n\n1548\n01:12:07,374 --> 01:12:10,135\nYou can have an under the house garage,\nor beside.\n\n1549\n01:12:10,135 --> 01:12:11,727\nYou've got some decisions to make there.\n\n1550\n01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,258\nSo we might look at it and go,\noh, wow, I didn't think of that.\n\n1551\n01:12:14,258 --> 01:12:16,580\nIf the house is elevated,\nthe garage can't be elevated.\n\n1552\n01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:19,016\nSo You know,\nmaybe we could put an elevator in there.\n\n1553\n01:12:19,016 --> 01:12:23,610\nBut it's going to change the scope and\nso it may result in that.\n\n1554\n01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,620\nHopefully that doesn't happen if\nyou've done the right planning,\n\n1555\n01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:28,080\nbut these contractors, they're experts.\n\n1556\n01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,350\nWell, they should be experts, right?\n\n1557\n01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:31,170\nThey should know what they're doing.\n\n1558\n01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,490\nSo they may come at you\nwith recommendations, and\n\n1559\n01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:35,940\nother information that you\njust didn't know about.\n\n1560\n01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,690\nAnd that may result in a scope change.\n\n1561\n01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:42,420\nThe other thing is our communications\nplan needs to be updated.\n\n1562\n01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,220\nThe contractors,\nwe have to communicate with them,\n\n1563\n01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,740\nthey have to communicate with us.\n\n1564\n01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:47,920\nWe can't really plan for\n\n1565\n01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:53,370\nthat communication prior to engaging\nthe contractor, selecting the seller.\n\n1566\n01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,700\nSo once we've selected them.\n\n1567\n01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,720\nNow we start to say, okay, who's\nthe point of contact at your company?\n\n1568\n01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,700\nAnd we usually need two points of contact.\n\n1569\n01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:04,680\nOne for managing the project,\nand one for the billing side.\n\n1570\n01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,940\nWho is that we pay?\n\n1571\n01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,830\nWho is it that's your accounts receivable\nor accounts payable or whatever?\n\n1572\n01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:11,210\nTo engage for that organization.\n\n1573\n01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:12,080\nThat's important.\n\n1574\n01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,050\nWe have got to have that information.\n\n1575\n01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:17,310\nThey usually will identify that.\n\n1576\n01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,170\nA great example.\n\n1577\n01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:22,215\nI did a roll out for\na bank out in Washington,\n\n1578\n01:13:22,215 --> 01:13:24,570\nthat we got some T1 lines installed.\n\n1579\n01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:28,260\nThey're high data rate reserve lines, and\n\n1580\n01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:31,580\nwe got those deployed at it was\nlike 40 different branch offices.\n\n1581\n01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,770\nSo we were getting 40 T1's installed.\n\n1582\n01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,830\nWe got them all through a company\ncalled Quest Communications.\n\n1583\n01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,150\nSo all purchased from the same company,\nand\n\n1584\n01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:42,630\nthe project was getting them installed\nat these 40 different branch offices.\n\n1585\n01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:46,170\nWell, they had different\ninstallers at every branch.\n\n1586\n01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:51,110\nBecause some of them were in Idaho,\nsome were in Oregon, different places.\n\n1587\n01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:54,330\nSo you didn't have the same\ninstaller going everywhere.\n\n1588\n01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:58,730\nSo Quest actually attached they're\nown project manager to that project.\n\n1589\n01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:04,590\nThey had a project manager, we had\na project manager, and we worked together.\n\n1590\n01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:05,930\nThat was my point of contact.\n\n1591\n01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:09,620\nI don't think that I talked to a single,\nI think that I did talk to one installer,\n\n1592\n01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:12,470\nthey called me because they\ncouldn't find the wiring closet.\n\n1593\n01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:16,490\nBut I didn't talk to most\nof the actual installers,\n\n1594\n01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:18,410\nthe people that were\nactually doing the work.\n\n1595\n01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:23,110\nI talked to Quest's Project Manager,\nand they talked to all the installers.\n\n1596\n01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:25,280\nSo I got the information\nrelayed through them.\n\n1597\n01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,860\nI had to update our\ncommunications management plan, so\n\n1598\n01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:31,550\nthat I included Quest's Project Manager\nin everything that we did.\n\n1599\n01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,620\nAnd they included us and\nI would relay that information.\n\n1600\n01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,210\nSo a single point of contact\nis really important.\n\n1601\n01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:40,190\nAnd then the procurement management plan.\n\n1602\n01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:44,920\nThe procurement management plan states\nhow we pay out to people and so on.\n\n1603\n01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,820\nSo when we get the information\non who's their billing person.\n\n1604\n01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:49,320\nWho is it that we need\nto send the checks to?\n\n1605\n01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,570\nWhat address do we need to\nsend the checks too and stuff.\n\n1606\n01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:54,680\nThat goes in the procurement\nmanagement plan.\n\n1607\n01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:58,950\nAfter that there's a few other\nproject document updates that we do.\n\n1608\n01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:01,270\nMost of these are pretty straightforward.\n\n1609\n01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:03,310\nThe requirements documentation.\n\n1610\n01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:06,490\nIf we've modified our scope,\nour requirements might modify too.\n\n1611\n01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:08,640\nSo that might be a change\nthat has to happen.\n\n1612\n01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,110\nOur requirements\ntraceability documentation.\n\n1613\n01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:15,689\nIf we're adding new requirements as\npart of this contract, or whatever.\n\n1614\n01:15:15,689 --> 01:15:16,770\nWhere do those come from?\n\n1615\n01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:19,370\nThe risk register.\n\n1616\n01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:23,530\nWhen you deal with a contractor,\nyou might be deferring some risks to them.\n\n1617\n01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:25,250\nSo you put that in your risk register.\n\n1618\n01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,330\nYou say hey this risk is here, but\nwe don't worry about it anymore.\n\n1619\n01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:28,720\nNow it's their problem.\n\n1620\n01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,480\nOr You may have eliminated\na risk by contracting out.\n\n1621\n01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,100\nMaybe this contract is\nan insurance contract.\n\n1622\n01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,770\nSo you've now just insured\nyourself against that risk.\n\n1623\n01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:39,390\nYou can defer the risk off\nto the insurance company.\n\n1624\n01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:40,710\nSo you'd put that in the register too.\n\n1625\n01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:43,440\nAnd then your stakeholder register.\n\n1626\n01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,200\nNow, this one is kind of weird.\n\n1627\n01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:49,630\nBasically, your stakeholders don't\nreally change as far as your\n\n1628\n01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:50,940\ninternal project team,\n\n1629\n01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:54,280\nand the other people who are associated\nwith the project in your company.\n\n1630\n01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,880\nBut that contractor.\n\n1631\n01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,830\nThey just became a stakeholder.\n\n1632\n01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:02,100\nThey need to know if stuff leading up\nto that project is behind schedule.\n\n1633\n01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,640\nBecause then they won't be\nready to do their work.\n\n1634\n01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,440\nOr they won't be able to do their work.\n\n1635\n01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,340\nSo they need to be kept in the loop and\naware, and\n\n1636\n01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,800\nthat means bringing them into\nyour stakeholder register.\n\n1637\n01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,860\nThey don't necessarily,\n\n1638\n01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,490\nthey don't necessarily care if\nthe whole project finishes or not.\n\n1639\n01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:17,330\nThey really just care about their part.\n\n1640\n01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:20,650\nBut they will recognize that other aspects\nof the project may affect them, so\n\n1641\n01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:22,110\nthey need to be informed.\n\n1642\n01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,870\nAnd it's real important\nto figure out a single\n\n1643\n01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:26,680\npoint of contact with the other company.\n\n1644\n01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,530\nYou don't want to deal with trying to\nreach out to all their various employees.\n\n1645\n01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:32,220\nIf they have staff changes, you don't\nwant to get involved in all that.\n\n1646\n01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,990\nTry and have a single point of contact,\nand a backup is usually a good idea.\n\n1647\n01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:37,590\nAll right.\n\n1648\n01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:39,820\nSo that in a nutshell\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1649\n01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:40,870\n>> Is conducting procurements.\n\n1650\n01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:42,230\nIt's a lot, right?\n\n1651\n01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,760\nIt doesn't really look like a lot,\nbut it really is.\n\n1652\n01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,740\nBecause it's contracts.\n\n1653\n01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,260\nYou're gonna have lawyers involved.\n\n1654\n01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,170\nThings like that and\nthat always makes things complex.\n\n1655\n01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:54,470\nBut, the key thing I want you guys to\nremember though, is that this process,\n\n1656\n01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:56,190\nthis conduct procurements process.\n\n1657\n01:16:56,190 --> 01:17:00,490\nWhen we look at the official matrix\nhere for our process groups,\n\n1658\n01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:04,108\nyou'll see that it does fall\nright here under executing.\n\n1659\n01:17:04,108 --> 01:17:06,320\nWe're actually performing\nthese activities, but\n\n1660\n01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,950\na lot of people started\nway back here in planning.\n\n1661\n01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:11,930\nSo these two overlap a good bit.\n\n1662\n01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:14,630\nBecause of the nature of the schedule and\n\n1663\n01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:20,120\nbudget stuff that we just don't know\nuntil we engage in the contracts.\n\n1664\n01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:23,010\nWe still have stakeholder\nengagement to jump into, so\n\n1665\n01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,190\nwe're gonna get to that next.\n\n1666\n01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:27,890\nI know we've done kind of short segment\nhere, but we did such a long one before.\n\n1667\n01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,030\nLet's stop here and take a break.\n\n1668\n01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:31,310\nAnd when we get back,\n\n1669\n01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:35,370\nwe'll wrap up the executing phase by\ntaking a look at stakeholder engagement.\n\n1670\n01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:37,372\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1671\n01:17:37,372 --> 01:17:45,361\n[MUSIC]\n\n1672\n01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:46,810\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1673\n01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:49,720\nSo for\nour final process of the executing group,\n\n1674\n01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,250\nwe've got managed stakeholder engagement.\n\n1675\n01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:56,340\nAnd this is another one where there's\nnot a whole heck of a lot for us to do.\n\n1676\n01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:59,640\nWe've already come up with our plan,\nour stakeholder management plan.\n\n1677\n01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,570\nThis is just applying it, doing all\nthe things we said we were going to do.\n\n1678\n01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:07,340\nOur obvious input is the stakeholder\nmanagement plan itself,\n\n1679\n01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:08,900\nthat's what we're applying.\n\n1680\n01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,200\nOur communications management\nplan comes into this too because\n\n1681\n01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,000\nhow do you interact\nwith your stakeholders?\n\n1682\n01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,330\nThrough communications right,\nso that's a big piece of it.\n\n1683\n01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:20,880\nWe've also got our change management log\nand our organizational process assets,\n\n1684\n01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,590\nthe things we kind of expect to\nsee going into one of these.\n\n1685\n01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:27,710\nSo nothing really new and\nearth shattering for our inputs there.\n\n1686\n01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:30,110\nSame thing really goes for\ntools and techniques.\n\n1687\n01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:33,140\nA lot of these are the same things we\ntalked about when it came to managing\n\n1688\n01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,820\nour team.\n\n1689\n01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,910\nManaging your stakeholders is not really\nany different than managing your project\n\n1690\n01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:40,100\nmanagement team,\nthere's just more of them.\n\n1691\n01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,240\nSo our communication\nmethods might be different.\n\n1692\n01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,860\nA project management team,\nwe might do a lot of meetings.\n\n1693\n01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:49,830\nStand up meetings,\nget people together all in one room.\n\n1694\n01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:54,240\nBut stakeholders It can be near impossible\nto get them all together at the same time.\n\n1695\n01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,570\nSo these might be things like phone calls,\n\n1696\n01:18:56,570 --> 01:19:00,480\nrecorded phone calls, it might just be\nemails, or other messages like that.\n\n1697\n01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,040\nWhatever is the appropriate\ncommunication method.\n\n1698\n01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,720\nAnd you know there's all sorts of\ndifferent communication methods available.\n\n1699\n01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,630\nWhere are my notes on that?\n\n1700\n01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:09,440\nLet's see, here.\n\n1701\n01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,200\nAll sorts of communications methods\navailable based on whatever it is that\n\n1702\n01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,010\nwe're trying to do.\n\n1703\n01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,448\nBut we've got those.\n\n1704\n01:19:15,448 --> 01:19:16,003\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1705\n01:19:16,003 --> 01:19:19,200\n>> The other thing is\ninterpersonal skills.\n\n1706\n01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,320\nThat's us communicating and\nbuilding trust,\n\n1707\n01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,370\nresolving conflict, active listening,\novercoming resistance to change.\n\n1708\n01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,360\nThese are the same as with the team.\n\n1709\n01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,990\nOne of the bigger ones though is that last\none, overcoming resistance to change.\n\n1710\n01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:36,090\nYour stakeholders, remember way back\nin some of our earlier episodes, we\n\n1711\n01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:40,150\nsaid there are some stakeholders who want\nto help your project and see it succeed.\n\n1712\n01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:43,590\nAnd there are some stakeholders who\ndon't want to help your project, and\n\n1713\n01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:45,140\ndon't want to see it succeed.\n\n1714\n01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,670\nWe have to manage both types.\n\n1715\n01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:50,850\nSo how do we encourage them to\nunderstand the benefits of the project?\n\n1716\n01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:53,570\nOr maybe not the benefits,\nmaybe the necessity of it.\n\n1717\n01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:56,250\nMaybe this is a project\nthat you have to do.\n\n1718\n01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,600\nA new legal requirement.\n\n1719\n01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,470\nA regulation was passed and\nyour company has to meet it.\n\n1720\n01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:02,380\nPeople might not like it,\nbut you don't have a choice.\n\n1721\n01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,070\nIt's either that or go out of business.\n\n1722\n01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:06,640\nSo overcoming that resistance to change.\n\n1723\n01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,889\nHow we communicate and\n\n1724\n01:20:07,889 --> 01:20:11,710\nsmooth those people to get things\nrunning along the way we need them.\n\n1725\n01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:15,706\n>> This is where your skills and\nthe intrapersonal relationships You become\n\n1726\n01:20:15,706 --> 01:20:19,580\nmore of the coach and you hate say it,\neven the ad hoc project champion.\n\n1727\n01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:22,450\nWe don't have an official one,\nbecause this is what you need done, right?\n\n1728\n01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:25,090\nAnd you need your stakeholders\nto be on the same page you are.\n\n1729\n01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:27,270\nAnd so,\nthe better you are at these skills,\n\n1730\n01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:30,220\nthe more you're going to actually see\nthem come on board behind you and\n\n1731\n01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:33,320\nactually really help you now become\na champion for your project.\n\n1732\n01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,910\nSo great skills to have.\n\n1733\n01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:37,010\n>> Yep.\nAnd then our general management skills.\n\n1734\n01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:38,570\nWe're managing people here, right?\n\n1735\n01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:41,970\nAnd we might not be\ntheir direct management.\n\n1736\n01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,560\nThey might have a functional\nmanager they answer to but\n\n1737\n01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,120\nin terms of the project they answer to us.\n\n1738\n01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,360\nAnd so we've gotta be able to\nfacilitate consensus, right?\n\n1739\n01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,915\nThat's problem solving.\n\n1740\n01:20:51,915 --> 01:20:53,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or conflict resolution, right?\n\n1741\n01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:54,700\n>> Right.\n\n1742\n01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,550\nInfluence people to support the project.\n\n1743\n01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:01,110\nGet those people who aren't necessarily in\nsupport of it to become supporters of it.\n\n1744\n01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,750\nNegotiating agreements, right?\n\n1745\n01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,500\nHandling the contract side of things.\n\n1746\n01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:08,910\nAnd modifying organizational behavior\nto accept the project outcomes.\n\n1747\n01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,670\nThere's more than one\noutcome to a project.\n\n1748\n01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:14,220\nObviously we hope that it's going\nto be a successful project, but if\n\n1749\n01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:18,940\nthe project is doomed to failure, if it's\nbeyond that point of recovery, being ready\n\n1750\n01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,040\nto make the next steps to correct for\nit after the project has failed, right?\n\n1751\n01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,760\nSo being set up for that.\n\n1752\n01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,320\nThese are all things that get\nkind of involved in this process.\n\n1753\n01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:29,565\nAll right, now,\nour outputs are pretty straightforward.\n\n1754\n01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:32,030\nBut we are going to see\na few new things here.\n\n1755\n01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:35,440\nI know I talked about the issue log in\nthe last episode we talked about it.\n\n1756\n01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:40,470\nAny problems or issues that occur in terms\nof our stakeholders who want to record,\n\n1757\n01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:43,840\nwe mentioned in the last episode in\nterms of our project management team,\n\n1758\n01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,340\nit's the same thing for\nthe stakeholders, all right?\n\n1759\n01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,790\nOur change requests,\nespecially your sponsor,\n\n1760\n01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:53,430\nyour key stakeholder,\nmay have changes or recommendations.\n\n1761\n01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:54,510\nOther ones may come from\n\n1762\n01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,820\nother stakeholders that\nare attached to the project.\n\n1763\n01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:00,160\nThose will lead to change requests\nwhich may or may not be approved.\n\n1764\n01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,430\nIt just depends on what\nit is they're asking and\n\n1765\n01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:04,509\nwhat the tolerances\nare within your organization.\n\n1766\n01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:09,170\nAnd then just our normal updates,\nproject management plan updates,\n\n1767\n01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:11,290\nproject document updates,\nnothing new there.\n\n1768\n01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:14,430\nBut the one we want to pay attention\nto is organizational process assets.\n\n1769\n01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,490\nWe see this one all the time, right?\n\n1770\n01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:19,420\nAnd the majority of what's in here,\nit makes sense, right?\n\n1771\n01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:23,400\nStakeholder notifications,\nproject reports, project presentations.\n\n1772\n01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,910\nBut we get this new one in here,\nlessons learned documentation.\n\n1773\n01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:29,480\nI know I've referenced it before too.\n\n1774\n01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:33,090\nWhen you're dealing with stakeholders,\nif this is the very\n\n1775\n01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:37,000\nfirst project that stakeholder's ever\nbeen a part of, then they're an unknown.\n\n1776\n01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,140\nYou don't know what it's going\nto be like to deal with them.\n\n1777\n01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:42,650\nThey may turn out to be extremely pleasant\nand very forthcoming with information.\n\n1778\n01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:44,960\nThings may work great with that person.\n\n1779\n01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,000\nOr they might be extremely change averse.\n\n1780\n01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,909\nAnd while they might not be the sponsor,\n\n1781\n01:22:49,909 --> 01:22:52,831\nthey might have a large degree\nof influence over the company,\n\n1782\n01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:56,270\nand maybe even over the project,\nso it'd be nice to know that.\n\n1783\n01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,420\nWell, if they had participated\nin a previous project, and\n\n1784\n01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:02,570\nthe project manager kept their\nlessons learned documentation, right,\n\n1785\n01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:04,560\ntheir notes, we could benefit from that.\n\n1786\n01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,860\nThat's what that's all about, right?\n\n1787\n01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:09,760\nIt's sharing information\nbetween your projects.\n\n1788\n01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,900\nIf your company has more\nthan one project manager,\n\n1789\n01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,260\nthen each one has their own\nseparate sets of knowledge.\n\n1790\n01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:19,760\nIt's nice to be able to consolidate that\ntogether into an information database.\n\n1791\n01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,590\nOr a project management database.\n\n1792\n01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:24,817\nThat you can look at and get that data and\nshare that information, okay?\n\n1793\n01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:29,460\nBut the thing I always remember\nis that when it comes to managing\n\n1794\n01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:33,560\nstakeholder engagement it's really\nnot any different than your team and\n\n1795\n01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,300\nyour team's communication.\n\n1796\n01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:38,170\nSo it's really the same\nprocess over again.\n\n1797\n01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,020\nNot too terribly exciting.\n\n1798\n01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:39,520\n>> No.\n\n1799\n01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,790\nAll right.\n\n1800\n01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:43,420\nRonny, can you think of anything\nthat we left off on that one?\n\n1801\n01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,910\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n1802\n01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:46,450\n>> Yeah,\nnothing that we really left off here.\n\n1803\n01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,970\nBut remember, the idea of actually keeping\nyour stakeholders engaged in this.\n\n1804\n01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:51,790\nOnce you start actually getting\nsomebody to lose interest,\n\n1805\n01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:55,180\nthey become maybe more adverse\nto your project succeeding, so\n\n1806\n01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,240\nthe idea of you as project manager\nbecoming a coach at this point.\n\n1807\n01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,810\nLike I said it's really kind of one of\nthose key aspects of something that\n\n1808\n01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:03,240\nwe do need to develop.\n\n1809\n01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,810\nNot just saying okay, here is what\nthe company says needs to be done, but\n\n1810\n01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:09,306\nthis is why you should also remain\ninvolved and support this project.\n\n1811\n01:24:09,306 --> 01:24:10,510\n>> You know the one I've seen,\n\n1812\n01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:13,650\nand we actually have it happen\nhere at ITProTV is that you might\n\n1813\n01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:17,359\nhave a stakeholder who's actually\na participant in more than one project.\n\n1814\n01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:17,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n1815\n01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:21,510\none project may be more glamorous and\nexciting than the other one.\n\n1816\n01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:24,110\nIt doesn't mean that one project's more\nimportant than the other it's just one\n\n1817\n01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:24,894\nmight be more glamorous.\n\n1818\n01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:26,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> They might want to do one and\n\n1819\n01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,021\nnot want to do the other.\n\n1820\n01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:28,310\n>> Right.\n>> So managing that engagement,\n\n1821\n01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:31,900\npart of that is keeping them involved\nin the less glamorous project\n\n1822\n01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,380\nkeeping that moving forward.\n\n1823\n01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:36,730\nYou don't want to sacrifice one project\nfor another, and that's a very real thing.\n\n1824\n01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:43,360\nWorking at ITProTV we have a lot\nof stuff here that's really cool.\n\n1825\n01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:47,330\nA lot of the technology we work with, the\nserver side and stuff, it's a lot of fun.\n\n1826\n01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:51,420\nBut then there's things\nlike uploading notes\n\n1827\n01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:56,140\ninto the website which is just monotonous,\nlong tedious work.\n\n1828\n01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:57,730\nAnd it's not exciting.\n\n1829\n01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,960\nIt's not glamorous but\nit needs to get done.\n\n1830\n01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,750\nIt's just as important as doing that new\nhow to video on how to set up an arcade\n\n1831\n01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,378\ncabinet or something like that.\n\n1832\n01:25:06,378 --> 01:25:09,810\nSo how to kind of balance those two\ntogether to keep people working in\n\n1833\n01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:10,510\nthe various projects?\n\n1834\n01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,010\nIt's all part of it.\n>> Yes.\n\n1835\n01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:13,780\n>> All right.\n\n1836\n01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,170\nWell that pretty much wraps\nup the executing phase.\n\n1837\n01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:19,340\nSo the entire executing phase\nreally just took us two episodes.\n\n1838\n01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:21,960\nAnd that should show you guys what\nyou are going to see on the exam.\n\n1839\n01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,834\nNot a lot of the exam is going to\ncome from the executing phase,\n\n1840\n01:25:24,834 --> 01:25:28,360\nbecause the project manager\nis mostly just watching.\n\n1841\n01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,637\nRight, and\nthat watching can be very detailed, but\n\n1842\n01:25:30,637 --> 01:25:33,432\nthe data that we collect ,we then\nhave to analyze and process and\n\n1843\n01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:36,360\nthat's what we do in the monitoring and\ncontrolling phase.\n\n1844\n01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,090\nSo we're about to move into a doozy.\n\n1845\n01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:39,900\nThe monitoring and\ncontrolling phase is big.\n\n1846\n01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,368\nA lot of stuff there.\n\n1847\n01:25:41,368 --> 01:25:44,100\nSo all right,\nwell let me just remind everybody,\n\n1848\n01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:47,130\nif you have questions on any\nof this feel free to ask.\n\n1849\n01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:49,770\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to

00:00:49,760\n>> I am very excited,\nI have come up with a new possible show,\n\n10\n00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,293\ntaking off Off of Breaking Bad\ncalled Fixing Good.\n\n11\n00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:54,055\n[LAUGH]\n>> Fixing Good?\n\n12\n00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:54,925\n>> And you'll make what?\n\n13\n00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:56,285\n>> Nothing.\n>> Delicious breakfast treats\n\n14\n00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:57,092\ninstead of methamphetamines?\n\n15\n00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:57,672\n>> Yeah, nothing.\n\n16\n00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:00,800\nI thought it was a little bit funny so I\nthought we would just throw that in there.\n\n17\n00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,380\n>> [LAUGH] We're gonna run with it.\n\n18\n00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,490\nWe're gonna jump right back\ninto project management today.\n\n19\n00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,323\nWe left off in our previous\nepisode with the executing phase,\n\n20\n00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:12,786\nwhich, to be honest with you,\nit was kind of boring.\n\n21\n00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:17,050\nI mean, there wasn't a whole heck of\na lot for us to do as a project manager.\n\n22\n00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,110\nYou might have been scratching your head\nas you went through that, saying, man,\n\n23\n00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,250\nthat was a lot of watching stuff happen,\nbut what am I doing?\n\n24\n00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:24,910\nI'm doing nothing.\n\n25\n00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,418\nI'm just watching and collecting data.\n\n26\n00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:30,050\nNow we're gonna talk about what we're\nsupposed to be doing while that's\n\n27\n00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,230\nhappening.\n\n28\n00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,030\nI've probably mentioned it a 1000 times.\n\n29\n00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,660\nLet me just do it again.\n\n30\n00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,000\nWhen we're in the executing phase,\n\n31\n00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,120\nwhen execution is occurring the project\nmanager and most of the project management\n\n32\n00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,420\nteam is shifting their role over\nto monitoring and controlling.\n\n33\n00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,990\nNow what does that mean?\n\n34\n00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,910\nMonitoring.\n\n35\n00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,870\nWe're watching what happens, right.\n\n36\n00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,350\nA lot of what we describe in execution.\n\n37\n00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,890\nWe're watching that data, and\nthen we're interpreting it.\n\n38\n00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,690\nThat's the unsaid thing right here, right.\n\n39\n00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,880\nWe're interpreting that data that we get,\nto figure out how the project is going.\n\n40\n00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,170\nAnd if things are going great.\n\n41\n00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,360\nWe sit back, we kick our feet up on\nthe desk and we continue monitoring.\n\n42\n00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,280\nBut if things are not going right, if\nthings are starting to go over budget or\n\n43\n00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,980\nbehind schedule or whatever,\nwe need to do controlling.\n\n44\n00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,850\nWe step in, and we do something about it.\n\n45\n00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,370\nWe take corrective action to ensure\nthat our project stays on track,\n\n46\n00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,800\nwe need to keep the train on the rails.\n\n47\n00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,460\nSo that we meet our\ndestination as planned.\n\n48\n00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,780\nIn monitoring and controlling,\nthere's a lot for us to do.\n\n49\n00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,810\nPlanning, was super busy for\nproject managers, right?\n\n50\n00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,130\nWe do a lot in planning.\n\n51\n00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,320\nThe bulk of this show\nspent time in planning.\n\n52\n00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,650\nThe number two process,\nMonitoring and Controlling.\n\n53\n00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,590\nAll right so inside of that process group\nwe've got a number of different things,\n\n54\n00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,880\nright, and\nwe're gonna dive into some of these and\n\n55\n00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,450\nwe'll kind of mix and match them.\n\n56\n00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,990\nThe very first process group is called\nMonitor and Control Project Work, and it's\n\n57\n00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,890\nreally a umbrella process that includes\nall the different processes underneath it.\n\n58\n00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,070\nWe're gonna start with a high level view.\n\n59\n00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,380\nHigh level view of what we're\nexpected to do in this group,\n\n60\n00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,170\nand then we're gonna start\ndiving into the individual.\n\n61\n00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,140\nWhere the real work is gonna come\nin are these two guys down here.\n\n62\n00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,930\nControl schedule, control costs,\ncontrol quality, these three, right?\n\n63\n00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,380\nBut control scheduling costs.\n\n64\n00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,480\nThose are the ones we spend\nmost of our time doing.\n\n65\n00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,610\nNotice it's not monitor schedule,\nor monitor cost.\n\n66\n00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,370\nThe monitor is actually coming from\nexecution, progress reports and\n\n67\n00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,290\nall that stuff.\n\n68\n00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,780\nBut we need to be able to control it.\n\n69\n00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,990\nAnd we've got all sorts of really\nneat tools at our disposal.\n\n70\n00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,178\nAnd by neat tools what I mean is we've got\nsome really cool mathematical formulas.\n\n71\n00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:44,550\nWoo-hoo, right?\n\n72\n00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,630\nIn real life land you're gonna use\na project management information system,\n\n73\n00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,130\na PMIS, something like\nMicrosoft Project or Primavera,\n\n74\n00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,360\nwhich will do these calculations for you,\nand they will predict, the future of it.\n\n75\n00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,880\nIt's awesome.\n\n76\n00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,840\nAnd with a high degree of accuracy.\n\n77\n00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,720\nOn the exam,\nyou gotta be able to do them by hand.\n\n78\n00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,080\nWe have to do themselves with\nthe formulas in our brains.\n\n79\n00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,100\nIt does require some practice, some study,\n\n80\n00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,370\nsome memorization to get\nready to do that on the exam.\n\n81\n00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,950\nWe'll see that in an upcoming episode,\nnot today's.\n\n82\n00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,590\nLet's get started,\n\n83\n00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,310\nright here in our project integration\nmanagement knowledge area.\n\n84\n00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,420\nWe've got two different things here.\n\n85\n00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,330\nThe first one is that\nhigh level I mentioned,\n\n86\n00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,220\nthe second one a really important one,\nperforming integrated change control.\n\n87\n00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,740\nI know we've talked about it a number\nof times, but never dived into it.\n\n88\n00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,680\nAll right.\nI'll quit stalling.\n\n89\n00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,630\nLet's jump right into\nour first process group.\n\n90\n00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,900\nAll right.\nOur first process group is Monitoring and\n\n91\n00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,170\nControlling Project Work.\n\n92\n00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,260\nAll right.\n\n93\n00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,080\nThis is that high level\numbrella that shows what we're\n\n94\n00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,250\ngonna be doing this entire time.\n\n95\n00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,350\nFor the most part, we're gathering\ndata together, interpreting it,\n\n96\n00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,330\nand then acting upon it, right?\n\n97\n00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,240\nAnd that's what the inputs, tools,\ntechniques and outputs here reflect.\n\n98\n00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,250\nThe inputs, gathering data.\n\n99\n00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,670\nAll right?\nWhat do we get data from?\n\n100\n00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,770\nWell our Project Management Plan.\n\n101\n00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,280\nThat's important cuz it shows\nwhat we're supposed to be doing.\n\n102\n00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,230\nWhat do we plan on doing today?\n\n103\n00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,580\nRight, then everything shows not\nwhat we planned to do today, but\n\n104\n00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,910\nwhat we actually did today.\n\n105\n00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,130\nAnd when we have that information\nwe have what we planned to do, and\n\n106\n00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,580\nwhat we actually did, you compare them and\n\n107\n00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,940\nthe difference between the two\nis what's called variance right?\n\n108\n00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,990\nAnywhere we have variance,\na deviation from what we planed.\n\n109\n00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,510\nThere's a problem right?\n\n110\n00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,610\nAnd don't be tricked into thinking\nthere's good variance and bad variance.\n\n111\n00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,450\nAll variance is bad, but\nthere's tolerances, right.\n\n112\n00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,260\nYou can tolerate a certain\nlevel of variance and\n\n113\n00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,390\nstill have a successful project.\n\n114\n00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,270\nYou've got that Window you've\ngotta plan around, but\n\n115\n00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,890\nwe need to keep an eye on that.\n\n116\n00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,700\nIdentify where it's starting\nto grow to be significant, and\n\n117\n00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,970\ntake actions to curve it back.\n\n118\n00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,100\nAll right so that first one,\nthat's what we're supposed to be doing.\n\n119\n00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,110\nThen schedule forecast.\n\n120\n00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,020\nCost forecast.\n\n121\n00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,090\nValidated changes.\n\n122\n00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,130\nWork performance.\n\n123\n00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,840\nThese are what we are doing.\n\n124\n00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,860\nWhat has happened.\n\n125\n00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,510\nRight?\n\n126\n00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,750\nSchedule forecasts.\n\n127\n00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,310\nThat's our calendar right?\n\n128\n00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,850\nHow well are we following our schedule?\n\n129\n00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,120\nBased on what we've done so far,\nhow does it look like we've been doing?\n\n130\n00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,490\nIf we've been falling behind,\na little bit each week.\n\n131\n00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,460\nIf we schedule that out into the future,\n\n132\n00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,540\nhow bad is it gonna be\nwhen the project finishes?\n\n133\n00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,010\nRight.\nWe need a forecast,\n\n134\n00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,720\nto be able to determine that.\n\n135\n00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,130\nWe get that from our historical data.\n\n136\n00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,570\nSame thing goes for cost.\n\n137\n00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,180\nIf we've been spending more money, or\n\n138\n00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,920\nless money than we planned,\nwhat's that gonna look like over time?\n\n139\n00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,690\nIs it gonna compound?\n\n140\n00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,340\nIs it gonna get bigger,\nand bigger, and bigger.\n\n141\n00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,860\nThat variance, right.\n\n142\n00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,100\nAnd what can we do to stop it.\n\n143\n00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,330\nOr is there a reason?\n\n144\n00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,380\nThere might be a very valid reason.\n\n145\n00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,770\nI might have planned on buying\n40 new servers this Friday.\n\n146\n00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,370\nOr last Friday.\n\n147\n00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,420\nAnd maybe that didn't happen,\nso I call in and I'm like,\n\n148\n00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,600\nhey guys why didn't you buy those servers?\n\n149\n00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,150\nAnd they said well, it turns out there's\ngonna be a big sale this coming Friday.\n\n150\n00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,440\nAnd if we wait just one week, the sale\nwill save us a bunch of money, and\n\n151\n00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,910\nwe can pay to overnight the servers and\nget them here faster, and still pay less.\n\n152\n00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,020\nWe're gonna save money.\n\n153\n00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,830\nThat's great!\n\n154\n00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,440\nWonderful, we're gonna save some money.\n\n155\n00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,420\nThat's why the variance is there.\n\n156\n00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,270\nNow, let's clear up the variance, right?\n\n157\n00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,990\nLet's do a change ticket to say, oh, those\nservers aren't gonna cost $50,000 anymore,\n\n158\n00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,221\nnow they're going to cost $45,000, right?\n\n159\n00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:19,860\nThat's what we need to do,\nthat's controlling that variance and\n\n160\n00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,250\nmaking sure it gets\nentered into the project.\n\n161\n00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,000\nValidated changes, all right?\n\n162\n00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,970\nSomebody put forth a change,\na change request,\n\n163\n00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,220\nwe can actually see it\nas an output right here.\n\n164\n00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,020\nI think ever since we got into executing,\n\n165\n00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,030\nevery process we've seen has had\nchange request as a possible output.\n\n166\n00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,200\nJust because a change request is output,\ndoesn't mean that it actually happens.\n\n167\n00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,760\nNotice it's a change request.\n\n168\n00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,917\nWe're requesting the change,\nthe change board could deny it.\n\n169\n00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,647\nJust because it's output\ndoesn't mean it happens, but\n\n170\n00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:56,619\nif it's accepted, if the change is\nallowed, then it gets put into place and\n\n171\n00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:58,655\nit's now a validated change.\n\n172\n00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:01,956\nWe validate to ensure the change\nwas made as specified and\n\n173\n00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:04,840\nnow we operate with that\nas part of our routine.\n\n174\n00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,680\nSo that's another input for us.\n\n175\n00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,840\nAll right.\n\n176\n00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,940\nWork Performance Information,\nthose are our progress reports.\n\n177\n00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,330\nThe status updates we're getting from\nthe people who are doing the executing.\n\n178\n00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,260\nPeople who are actually\nout there doing the work,\n\n179\n00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,650\nreporting back their status,\nand then our favorites.\n\n180\n00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,450\nEnterprise environmental factors and\norganizational process assets.\n\n181\n00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,160\nSo the things our company already\nhas in the way we do business, so\n\n182\n00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,000\nwe've got that information too.\n\n183\n00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,400\nAll of that feeds into how we monitor and\ncontrol the project.\n\n184\n00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,260\nSo once we've got that,\nnow we need to interpret the data.\n\n185\n00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,990\nWe analyze the data, and\nif necessary we act upon it.\n\n186\n00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,190\nSo the number one way to do\nthat is expert judgement.\n\n187\n00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,910\nYou're a project manager,\nyou have a certain set of skills,\n\n188\n00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,530\nthings that you have in your mind that you\nknow how to apply in this environment,\n\n189\n00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,930\nit just made me think of that movie,\nTaken.\n\n190\n00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> With Liam Neeson and\n\n191\n00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,450\nhe said I've got\na particular set of skills.\n\n192\n00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:56,950\n>> Yep.\n\n193\n00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,150\n>> That's how a project manager is, and\n\n194\n00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,523\nit's not as awesome as going to another\ncountry and rescuing your daughter.\n\n195\n00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:05,350\n[LAUGH] But you get to keep\nyour project on the tracks.\n\n196\n00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,790\nMoving along on schedule and on budget.\n\n197\n00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,120\nThat's what we want and that's what\nwe're doing with expert judgement.\n\n198\n00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,730\nNow, analytical techniques.\n\n199\n00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:17,560\nYeah, this is talking about\nhow we break down that data.\n\n200\n00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,610\nWhen you get all this information,\nit's not necessarily in usable format.\n\n201\n00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,400\nIt's not listing stuff in the future,\nit's just listing right now.\n\n202\n00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,460\nI mentioned we need to predict the future.\n\n203\n00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,990\nWell we use analytical\ntechniques to do that.\n\n204\n00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,202\nAnd you'll see,\nI'm the the completely wrong thing.\n\n205\n00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:39,900\nAll right well when we talk about\nanalytical techniques, we're talking about\n\n206\n00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,540\nways that we can analyze that data and\nturn it into usable information.\n\n207\n00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,620\nAnd they call out a few specifically,\nlet me bring up that document,\n\n208\n00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,740\nI've got the show notes for\nthe last episode here.\n\n209\n00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,851\nSo we need to get into our,\n>> Controlling and\n\n210\n00:09:55,851 --> 00:09:59,370\nmonitoring and project integration.\n\n211\n00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,350\n>> There we go.\n\n212\n00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,370\nOkay.\n\n213\n00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,630\nSo, let me just find it here.\n\n214\n00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,250\nThere we go, analytical techniques.\n\n215\n00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,250\nSo you'll see some of the different things\nthat we can use to analyze that data.\n\n216\n00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,910\nAnd there's quite a bit\ntucked away in here.\n\n217\n00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,680\nLet me turn off my word wrap there.\n\n218\n00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,760\nSo things like regression analysis.\n\n219\n00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,480\nWhen a change happens, how does that\naffect the rest of our project?\n\n220\n00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,930\nRemember that a single change can cause a\ncascading change throughout your project.\n\n221\n00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,150\nAnd you may find that by fixing one thing\nyou've actually broken something else.\n\n222\n00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,740\nSo maybe something that is falling behind\nschedule, so you get a change request,\n\n223\n00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,540\nsay hey can we have a bit more time,\nthe change request got approved,\n\n224\n00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,010\ngreat that's solved.\n\n225\n00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,540\nBut by moving that one back,\n\n226\n00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,830\nnow you got a constrained scheduled\nactivity later on that can't move.\n\n227\n00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,610\nAnd now it's overlapping\nwith something else.\n\n228\n00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,770\nYou've created another problem.\n\n229\n00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,440\nSo, looking at how an action or a change\n\n230\n00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720\ncascades through our project is basically\nwhat we do with regression analysis.\n\n231\n00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,820\nWe've got things like grouping methods.\n\n232\n00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,950\nWhere we can take the data\nthat we're getting and\n\n233\n00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,390\ngroup it together to form a big picture.\n\n234\n00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,720\nIf you're getting performance reports back\nfrom multiple people on the same team,\n\n235\n00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,160\nyou can aggregate that data\ntogether to form a team report.\n\n236\n00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,400\nAnd there's a number of different\ngroup techniques that are out there.\n\n237\n00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,590\nCausal analysis.\n\n238\n00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,320\nThis is one of my favorites.\n\n239\n00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,850\nYou will see stuff in the news\nall of the time that will say,\n\n240\n00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,270\npeople who live in houses painted green\nhave a higher chance of getting cancer.\n\n241\n00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,660\nThere are a lot of times\nwhere you have causality.\n\n242\n00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,640\nAnd they call them correlations and\ncausality.\n\n243\n00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,540\nAnd just because something correlates\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you've found\n\n244\n00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,990\nthe cause of the problem.\n\n245\n00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,890\nSo there's a lot of outlying\nfactors that could cause,\n\n246\n00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,410\ncancer in a person who happens\nto live in a green house.\n\n247\n00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,280\nIt may just be coincidence\nthat the house was green, and\n\n248\n00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,680\nthat in that sample that we took, those\npeople just had a higher degree of cancer.\n\n249\n00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,790\nIt could be the location\nof those green houses.\n\n250\n00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,860\nMaybe houses closer to power lines\nhave a tendency to be painted\n\n251\n00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,280\ngreen more frequently, I don't know.\n\n252\n00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,040\nBut that's something that we have\nto deal with with causal analysis.\n\n253\n00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,380\nWe're trying to make sure\nthat when we have an issue,\n\n254\n00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,570\nwe actually know the real cause cuz you\ndon't want to take a corrective action for\n\n255\n00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,920\nsomething that isn't the true cause.\n\n256\n00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,420\n>> Right.\n\n257\n00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,890\n>> All right, and\nthat goes to root cause analysis, right?\n\n258\n00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,760\nWhen you have a problem what we\nnormally see are the symptoms and\n\n259\n00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,900\nyou don't want to correct the symptoms\nbecause the root cause is still there.\n\n260\n00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,530\nYou want to make sure you fix the cause.\n\n261\n00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,150\nSo if I have a blue jean\nmanufacturing plant, and\n\n262\n00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,980\nI'm manufacturing blue jeans and my fault\nrate starts climbing, my defect rate.\n\n263\n00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,890\nSo it starts at 5% and\nthen it gets to 6 and 7%, and\n\n264\n00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,670\nbefore I know it I'm at 15% of\nthe blue jeans I create are defective.\n\n265\n00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,270\nAnd I look and\n\n266\n00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:50,050\nI find out that there is a needle in\none of the devices that's worn out.\n\n267\n00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,610\nAnd that's why my defect rate is higher.\n\n268\n00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,800\nSo I replaced the needle.\n\n269\n00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,480\nOkay.\n\n270\n00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,640\nWell that fixes it, right?\n\n271\n00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,050\nWell no.\n\n272\n00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,500\nThe needle wore out.\n\n273\n00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,460\nAnd so\nwhat's gonna happen to this new needle?\n\n274\n00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,010\nIt's gonna wear out too.\n\n275\n00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,960\nSo while I've fixed the symptom,\nthe needle was worn out and\n\n276\n00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,830\nit was causing defects,\nI haven't fixed the root cause.\n\n277\n00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,440\nThe root cause is I don't have a good\nmaintenance plan for that needle.\n\n278\n00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,960\nI need a scheduler.\n\n279\n00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,040\nIf it takes two months for\nthat needle to wear out, I should be\n\n280\n00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,340\nreplacing it every six weeks, and\nthat way I replace it before it wears out.\n\n281\n00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,810\nSo I stop the defects\nbefore they even start.\n\n282\n00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,010\nThat's what we can do\nwith root cause analysis.\n\n283\n00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,113\nWe try and\nlocate what that actual root cause is.\n\n284\n00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:32,030\nAll right, now forecasting methods.\n\n285\n00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,910\nWe are gonna talk about this\na lot in later episodes.\n\n286\n00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,380\nWhen you have a schedule,\nwhen you have a budget,\n\n287\n00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,700\nit's easy to look at the trend\nof what you've done, and\n\n288\n00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,932\nforecast it out into the future to\nget an idea of what's gonna happen.\n\n289\n00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:52,790\nWe're gonna do something called\nvariance analysis later and\n\n290\n00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,230\nEVA, earned value analysis and\na couple of other ones.\n\n291\n00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,480\nAnd we've got formulas for that and a lot\nof really, really cool stuff to deal with.\n\n292\n00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,720\nBut we're gonna just stick high level for\nthis section right here.\n\n293\n00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,020\nSo what we do is we take\nthe information we have and\n\n294\n00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,890\nwe just try and figure out what's\ngoing to happen from there.\n\n295\n00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,890\nIt could take a number\nof different methods.\n\n296\n00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,840\nTime series are what we normally do,\nor what I normally do.\n\n297\n00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,890\nIf I lay out week after week after week\nafter week what things have been like,\n\n298\n00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,800\nI can estimate what it's gonna be like in\nthe future just following that same trend.\n\n299\n00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,860\nYou can do other things like scenario and\nsimulation.\n\n300\n00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,270\nSimulation are like the what if scenarios.\n\n301\n00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,300\nWe do that with scheduling.\n\n302\n00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,190\nYou say like what if this\nactivity fell behind schedule?\n\n303\n00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,830\nHow would that affect everything else?\n\n304\n00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,800\nSo you start kind of trending to\nfigure out what may happen there.\n\n305\n00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:41,610\nFailure mode and effect analysis.\n\n306\n00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,720\nVery similar to like,\nthe what if simulations.\n\n307\n00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,100\nIf something fails,\n\n308\n00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,820\nif a particular activity were not to\ncome off successful, what's the effect?\n\n309\n00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,270\nWhat's the effect on\nthe rest of the project?\n\n310\n00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,700\nYou can do this hopefully beforehand.\n\n311\n00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,190\nBut you can do it afterwards too.\n\n312\n00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,100\nYou've had a failure.\n\n313\n00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,050\nSomething's gone behind schedule or\nover budget.\n\n314\n00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,640\nNow we start to look at the effect.\n\n315\n00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,030\nWe analyze across our systems\nto find out where that is.\n\n316\n00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,980\nFault tree analysis.\n\n317\n00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,960\nThis one we don't really\nuse in IT that much, but\n\n318\n00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,900\nit in like manufacturing and stuff.\n\n319\n00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,780\nThis is where you have a root cause and\n\n320\n00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,450\nthen you have all the various\nsymptoms that branch out from it.\n\n321\n00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,470\nThat's why they call it\nthe fault tree analysis.\n\n322\n00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,920\nSo we start kind of figuring that out.\n\n323\n00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,020\nYou have defects, why?\n\n324\n00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,400\nThere could be more than one reason,\nleading to that defect.\n\n325\n00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,290\nYou start kind of gauging those together.\n\n326\n00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,620\nWe talked about this a bit\nwith like Fishbone or\n\n327\n00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,430\nIshikawa diagrams, it's the same\nconcept here with fault tree analysis.\n\n328\n00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,667\nReserve analysis.\n\n329\n00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:48,413\nOkay, reserve analysis is,\nif we've set aside time and money, or\n\n330\n00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:53,592\ntime or money, as a reserve for our\nproject, how do we know when to use it?\n\n331\n00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:56,928\nWhen we created that reserve we should\nhave designated exactly when we\n\n332\n00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:57,840\nwere gonna use it.\n\n333\n00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,490\nSo, how do we know when it's time?\n\n334\n00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,950\nSomebody needs to be looking at the\nproject, looking at the activities that\n\n335\n00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,990\nare occurring, and identifying when the\ntime is right to pull from those reserves,\n\n336\n00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,960\nthat's reserve analysis, all right.\n\n337\n00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,330\nThe other things is,\nas we start to pull from the reserves,\n\n338\n00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,350\nsomebody should be double checking to\ninsure we're not gonna run out, right.\n\n339\n00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,100\nThat we haven't exceeded the amounts that\nwe allocated back in the original plan.\n\n340\n00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,700\nIf you're doing proper change management,\nit's impossible, you manage that.\n\n341\n00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,400\nBut if you're not doing\ngood change management,\n\n342\n00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,780\npeople could be pulling from\nthe reserves when they shouldn't be.\n\n343\n00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,220\nAnd that could be,\nwell two problems, right?\n\n344\n00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,100\nOne would be impropriety,\n\n345\n00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,190\nthey could be stealing, or\nembezzling funds from the reserve.\n\n346\n00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,120\nOr two, it could just be.\n\n347\n00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,250\nThey're pulling from it,\nnot reporting it, so\n\n348\n00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,390\nnow they're trying to hide the fact that\nthey went over budget or over schedule.\n\n349\n00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,350\nAnd the result is that you're\nless capable to correct for\n\n350\n00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,600\nerrors later in the project and that's\nwhen things become really sensitive.\n\n351\n00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:55,180\nAll right, trend analysis I've kind of\nalready talked about with forecast.\n\n352\n00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,550\nIf you've got a repeating sequence of\nevents, you can look at the trend.\n\n353\n00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,890\nThe blue jean example.\n\n354\n00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,660\nWeek after week, my defect was increasing.\n\n355\n00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,860\nGoing up more and more each week.\n\n356\n00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,310\nYou use that to build a trend.\n\n357\n00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,460\nIt looks like I'm\nincreasing by 3% each week.\n\n358\n00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,540\nIf I keep going like that, in X number\nof weeks I'm gonna be at a 100% failure.\n\n359\n00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,275\nThat's something we can predict.\n\n360\n00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:19,780\nEarn-to-value management.\n\n361\n00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,750\nI mentioned that earlier.\n\n362\n00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,460\nEVM or Earned Value Management, you also\nhear it as EVA, Earned Value Analysis.\n\n363\n00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,120\nThese are a collection of formulas.\n\n364\n00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,620\nAnd what they do,\nis they let you aggregate two things.\n\n365\n00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,760\nBasically when you're\nperforming an activity,\n\n366\n00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,070\nthe two main things we track\nare schedule and budget, right?\n\n367\n00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,920\nSchedule is measured in time, and\nbudget is measured in dollars.\n\n368\n00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,040\nAnd what EV does is it combines the two,\nright?\n\n369\n00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,200\nIt quantifies them,\nturns them into numbers, and\n\n370\n00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,550\nthen combines them to\ncreate a single number, and\n\n371\n00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:56,140\nthat number is a reflection of\nthe progress you've made on that activity.\n\n372\n00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,121\nIf I've got a four day\nactivity with a $1,000 budget,\n\n373\n00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,940\nif I've spent $500, and I'm on day two.\n\n374\n00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:12,310\nThat's 50% of my budget, 50% of schedule,\nI should be 50% complete of that activity.\n\n375\n00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,860\nRight?\n50% complete being a reflection of both\n\n376\n00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,270\nschedule and cost, right, of money.\n\n377\n00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,160\nSo it aggregates those two\ntogether into a single value.\n\n378\n00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,880\nYou can then use that to create things\nlike a schedule performance index or\n\n379\n00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,440\na cost performance index.\n\n380\n00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,120\nWhich are, again, just reflections\nof your budget and your schedule.\n\n381\n00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,140\nAs a project manager we work\nwith these numbers a lot and\n\n382\n00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,490\nthese are some of the formulas that\nwe're going to have to learn and\n\n383\n00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,370\nwe'll talk about in the next episode.\n\n384\n00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,770\nBut for regular people,\nyour project team members,\n\n385\n00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,480\nyour stakeholders, they don't\nunderstand Earned Value Analysis.\n\n386\n00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,560\nSo this is a set of numbers that we use\nbut when we communicate it out we've\n\n387\n00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,530\nalways gotta translate it into\nlanguage that other people understand.\n\n388\n00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,530\nYou don't really see these used\noutside of project managing.\n\n389\n00:18:58,265 --> 00:18:58,945\nAll right.\n\n390\n00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:03,835\nAnd when we have earned value calculated\nwe usually calculate it in two ways.\n\n391\n00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:07,155\nOne is the earned value that we should\nhave at this point according to our plan.\n\n392\n00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:09,815\nAnd the other is the earned value\nthat we actually have according to\n\n393\n00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,102\nwhat's been done.\n\n394\n00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:15,632\nWe look at the difference and that's our\nvariance which leads to variance analysis.\n\n395\n00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:19,232\nIf there's a difference, we need to\nfind out why and try and correct it.\n\n396\n00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:23,212\nOr if it's within our tolerances then\nwe let it ride and you go from there.\n\n397\n00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:27,102\nSo it just kind of depends on\nhow your project is going.\n\n398\n00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:28,122\n>> Yeah.\n\n399\n00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:31,352\nAll of these different types of analysis\nare really there to help us to be able\n\n400\n00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:34,980\nto take whatever we've done in the past,\ntake that information and\n\n401\n00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,030\nthen be able to forecast into the future.\n\n402\n00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,860\nBut part of that of course is then\nknowing exactly where you are in\n\n403\n00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,640\nrelationship to what you started.\n\n404\n00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,030\nSo a lot of these things here,\nright, in terms of controlling and\n\n405\n00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,180\nmonitoring, right, is always about\ntaking a look at that past and\n\n406\n00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,800\nthen going here's a great way, that we can\nsee a little bit into the future here.\n\n407\n00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,410\nAnd so once you actually start getting\nthese techniques down as you continue to\n\n408\n00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,670\ngo on toward the PMP exam, you've got\nto actually kind of bear down and\n\n409\n00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,700\nyou'll see that the rest of this, when we\nget into the rest of controlling here,\n\n410\n00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,560\nwe're going to get into\nsome detailed formulas.\n\n411\n00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,980\nYou've got to know those.\n\n412\n00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,820\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n413\n00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,270\nSo yeah,\nwe'll spend a good bit of time on that.\n\n414\n00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,810\nThe only other two things\nwe've got are the PMIS,\n\n415\n00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,970\nthe project management information system,\nand good old-fashioned meetings.\n\n416\n00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,320\nSo those are all some of\nthe things we're gonna be using\n\n417\n00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,410\nwhen it comes to the analytical techniques\nof breaking down our project work.\n\n418\n00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,570\nIt's a lot, but\nwe need to analyze this stuff.\n\n419\n00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,880\nIf you have a PMIS, you feed the data\ninto it, and it generates it all for you.\n\n420\n00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,266\nAll the formulas that we're gonna learn,\nMycoft Project has them built in.\n\n421\n00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:38,770\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n422\n00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,010\n>> You just punch in your data and\nit does all the calculations,\n\n423\n00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,500\ngives you the numbers, you don't even\nhave to know the formula exists.\n\n424\n00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,225\nOn the exam, you do.\n\n425\n00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:46,200\n>> Yeah.\n\n426\n00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,950\nThe value of PMIS that I've found\nwhen I've used it is that ability for\n\n427\n00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,520\nit to create the reports that I want and\n\n428\n00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,590\nto be able to visually see the base\nline versus variances here, and\n\n429\n00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,800\nthen to see the forecasting of how far I'm\ngonna be in two weeks of time from now.\n\n430\n00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,540\nLot of times me just looking at\na spreadsheet or a number doesn't really\n\n431\n00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,970\nhelp me out until I can see that, and\nthat's where that PMIS really does help.\n\n432\n00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n433\n00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,260\n>> All right.\nNow, on our outputs,\n\n434\n00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,410\nthis is gonna be what we\nrelease as a project manager.\n\n435\n00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,280\nWhen we see a problem that\nwe have to step in and\n\n436\n00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,600\ncorrect, when we have to do a control,\nthe result is always a change request.\n\n437\n00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,110\nRight?\n\n438\n00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,690\nYou've gotta make a change for\nthat to happen.\n\n439\n00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,140\nThe exception is drawing\nfrom the reserves.\n\n440\n00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,830\nWhen there was a plan for reserve, right?\n\n441\n00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,470\nYou don't have to do a change ticket for\nthat because it was already planned for.\n\n442\n00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,610\nSame thing with a risk.\n\n443\n00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,470\nIf you've already formulated your\nrisk response you don't need\n\n444\n00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,200\na change ticket for that.\n\n445\n00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,660\nThe risk response is there.\n\n446\n00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,790\nSo if when we have variance,\nwhen we have a risk we didn't expect.\n\n447\n00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,520\nWhen we have a change we didn't expect.\n\n448\n00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,260\nWhen we have a budget shortage.\n\n449\n00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,200\nor a schedule overage\nthat we didn't expect.\n\n450\n00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,416\nThose are where we need\nthat change request.\n\n451\n00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,370\n>> Right.\n>> Other outputs, or performance reports?\n\n452\n00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,335\nNow, a work performance report\nwas really an input here,\n\n453\n00:21:57,335 --> 00:21:58,975\nWork Performance Information.\n\n454\n00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:03,655\nWe're just translating it into whatever\nform our company requires as part of our\n\n455\n00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,875\norganizational process assets or\n\n456\n00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,299\nas something that we communicate\nout to our stakeholders.\n\n457\n00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,590\nWe also have our Project Management Plan\nUpdates and Project Documents Updates,\n\n458\n00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,470\nthings we kind of expect to see.\n\n459\n00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,020\nBut the main output is going to\nbe a set of change requests, or\n\n460\n00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,210\nnothing if things are running great and\nsmooth, there is no output right?\n\n461\n00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,330\nYou have your reports I suppose but\nthen otherwise you stop there, but\n\n462\n00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,850\nif there's a problem, change requests\nare what you created to try and\n\n463\n00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,030\nget things back in line.\n\n464\n00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,550\nAll right.\n\n465\n00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,530\nI think that's basically it for that one.\n\n466\n00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,625\nDid I leave anything out?\n>> Yes.\n\n467\n00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,125\nNope.\n\n468\n00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,348\n>> Yeah.\nWe're gonna\n\n469\n00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:38,520\npost these notes with the episodes.\n\n470\n00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,110\nWe always do.\nRonnie does amazing notes on\n\n471\n00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,730\nsome of these.\n\n472\n00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,590\nAs far as, exactly which section these\nare discussed in the pinbok and so on.\n\n473\n00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,020\nBut the majority of these,\nare ones we've already seen.\n\n474\n00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,450\nNothing we need to dive into too deeply.\n\n475\n00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,370\nAll right well that's monitoring and\ncontrolling the project work.\n\n476\n00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:00,310\nThe other piece of this project or\nthis process group is,\n\n477\n00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,510\nPerform Integrated Change Control,\nand that's a big topic.\n\n478\n00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,150\nI know we've said repeatedly\nin other episodes,\n\n479\n00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,870\nyeah we'll talk about change\ncontrol later now's that time.\n\n480\n00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,680\nWell, now's almost that time.\n\n481\n00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,540\nWe really don't have enough\ntime in this segment.\n\n482\n00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,060\nSo why don't we stop and take a break.\n\n483\n00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,360\nAnd when we get back,\nwe'll jump into change control and\n\n484\n00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,000\nstart to describe that process,\nwhat's involved, and how important it is.\n\n485\n00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,722\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n486\n00:23:23,722 --> 00:23:28,377\n[MUSIC]\n\n487\n00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:32,324\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n488\n00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:37,640\nSo now we're going to take a moment and\ntalk about change control, all right.\n\n489\n00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,940\nChange control is a very\nimportant part of our project.\n\n490\n00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,840\nWe spend a lot of time planning for what's\ngoing to happen during our project and\n\n491\n00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,220\nwe want to make sure that\nthings go off without a hitch.\n\n492\n00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,025\nBut we know that things might\nnot go exactly as planned and\n\n493\n00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,260\nwe might have to change.\n\n494\n00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,349\nChange is not a bad thing, right?\n\n495\n00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:57,797\nI know it can be sometimes,\nbut it isn't normally.\n\n496\n00:23:57,797 --> 00:24:01,244\nSo what we need to do is\nwe need to prepare for it.\n\n497\n00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:06,190\nAnd when change happens it's okay,\nas long as we fully understand the change.\n\n498\n00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,850\nWe don't want to do any shooting from\nthe hip, knee jerk reaction to problems.\n\n499\n00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,360\nBecause they may have larger repercussions\nthat we're not ready to deal with.\n\n500\n00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,850\nOr that we just don't foresee.\n\n501\n00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,330\nWe make one little change that doesn't\nseem to be that big of a deal, and\n\n502\n00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,250\na few months later it turns out to have\nbeen a massive mistake that's going to be\n\n503\n00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,710\ndifficult to correct from.\n\n504\n00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,660\nThese are the types of\nproblems that we can have.\n\n505\n00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,110\nSo change control helps to prevent that.\n\n506\n00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,820\nNow there are many different\n\n507\n00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,210\nschools of thought on how to properly\nimplement change management.\n\n508\n00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,310\nPMI kind of leaves it open to you and\n\n509\n00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,450\nyour company to pick from the various\nmethodologies that are out there.\n\n510\n00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,870\nBut they all basically work the same way.\n\n511\n00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,800\nYou come up with a plan and\nyou stick to it.\n\n512\n00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,680\nAnd any time you deviate from that plan,\nyou have to fill out a change request.\n\n513\n00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,395\nA form of some sort that details\nthe change you want to make.\n\n514\n00:24:56,395 --> 00:25:00,505\nThat change then goes before\neither a single person in like\n\n515\n00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:05,135\na dictatorial environment, or\na board, a group of people, that will\n\n516\n00:25:05,135 --> 00:25:09,355\nmake the decision over to whether that\nchange should be approved or not.\n\n517\n00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:13,315\nIf it's approved,\nthen the project corrects itself and\n\n518\n00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:16,900\nmoves ahead as planned,\nor as it's newly planned.\n\n519\n00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,710\nIf the change is not approved,\n\n520\n00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,830\nthe change is declined and\nnow your project is set up for failure\n\n521\n00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,050\nyou need to find either another way to\ncorrect it or that's it you've failed.\n\n522\n00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,240\nSo that's basically the two\noutcomes of a change ticket.\n\n523\n00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,990\nSo it's a neat system in that\nit does work really well.\n\n524\n00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,910\nThe change board could be called anything.\n\n525\n00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,620\nYou might have a change\nadvisory committee,\n\n526\n00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,800\na change control board, it's all\nsorts of different names out there.\n\n527\n00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,070\nYou hear CAB a lot, change advisory board,\nor change approval board.\n\n528\n00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,840\nI've heard that one too.\n\n529\n00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,130\nSo, there's different\nnames that are there, but\n\n530\n00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,230\nit doesn't matter they do the same thing.\n\n531\n00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,090\nThey're just approving or\ndeclining a change in your environment.\n\n532\n00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,890\nSometimes the rejection of that\nchange is not an outright no,\n\n533\n00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,840\nwe're not going to do it.\n\n534\n00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,090\nIt's a, we need some more information.\n\n535\n00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,760\nYou need to gather some more datum and\nprovide it to us.\n\n536\n00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,610\nSo it's postponing the change to make sure\nwe have all the necessary information to\n\n537\n00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,968\nmake the right call.\n\n538\n00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:14,982\nAll right?\n\n539\n00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:18,210\nSo why do they call it\nintegrated change control?\n\n540\n00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,590\nWell, a lot of companies probably\nhave change control already for\n\n541\n00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,989\ntheir standard environment.\n\n542\n00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,220\nLet's say you're a bank and\nyou've got online accounting software.\n\n543\n00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,990\nIf you make a change to that online\naccounting software without testing it,\n\n544\n00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,160\nwhat can happen?\n\n545\n00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,860\nIt can all go offline or you could open\nyourself up to a security vulnerability\n\n546\n00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,020\nand leak out your customer data.\n\n547\n00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,240\nYou don't want that.\n\n548\n00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,650\nSo anytime somebody goes to\nmake a change to that software\n\n549\n00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,700\nthey need to get it approved, somebody\nneeds to review the code they're pushing,\n\n550\n00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,130\nand then authorize it to be rolled out,\nright.\n\n551\n00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,130\nIt's just simple,\ntaking the right precautions right,\n\n552\n00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,910\ndoing the best practices.\n\n553\n00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,090\nWell, in your project you may have\nchange that pertains to the project.\n\n554\n00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,470\nThe project is creating\nsomething that isn't there yet,\n\n555\n00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,200\ntypically, so it's not like you're\nchanging production systems.\n\n556\n00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,515\nSo you don't necessarily want to use\nthe change control system that's\n\n557\n00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:09,430\na part of your organization already.\n\n558\n00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,540\nInstead, you want to have a change\ncontrol system that is integrated\n\n559\n00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,402\ninto the project.\n\n560\n00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:17,800\nThat's built to your project\nsystem that may be different.\n\n561\n00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,390\nIt may be the same as the change control\nsystem for your organization, but\n\n562\n00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,330\na lot of the times it will be separate\nbecause it'll be the stakeholders,\n\n563\n00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,020\nthe key stakeholders, and\nthe project managers.\n\n564\n00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,440\nThe people that are involved\nin the project.\n\n565\n00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,210\nAll right.\n\n566\n00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,890\nSo, when we talk about performing\nintegrated change control,\n\n567\n00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,820\nwe're talking about basically doing that.\n\n568\n00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,140\nDoing that change control that's\na part of our project and and\n\n569\n00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,200\nensuring that our project is\nmoving in the right direction.\n\n570\n00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,050\nAll right, so\nwhat are our inputs for this?\n\n571\n00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:45,810\nWell the inputs are simple.\n\n572\n00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,570\nWe need to have our plan.\n\n573\n00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,570\nOur plan is what we're\nsupposed to be doing.\n\n574\n00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,680\nWe're supposed to be following this.\n\n575\n00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,380\nAll right.\n\n576\n00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,200\nBut apparently there's a deviation.\n\n577\n00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,150\nThe deviation is normally be recognized\nby our work performance reports.\n\n578\n00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,270\nThat's going to show\nwhere our deviation is.\n\n579\n00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,940\nAll right.\nThen as a project manager,\n\n580\n00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,950\nwe recognize the deviation, and\nso we create a change request.\n\n581\n00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,050\nA change request to fix it.\n\n582\n00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,850\nNow, I say the project manager.\n\n583\n00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,240\nMost change requests will\ncome from the project manger.\n\n584\n00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,400\nBut that doesn't mean they have to.\n\n585\n00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,830\nChange requests can come from\nanywhere within the project.\n\n586\n00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,290\nAnybody can submit that.\n\n587\n00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,610\nAnd another common place to\nget it is from the sponsor.\n\n588\n00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,890\nThe project sponsor says man,\nthis project is awesome and\n\n589\n00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,400\nI know you guys have been working on it\nfor six months now, but I had this idea.\n\n590\n00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,720\nI had this idea for a great new feature.\n\n591\n00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,790\nCan we add this feature to the project?\n\n592\n00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,000\nAnd you say can we finish this project and\n\n593\n00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,030\nthen add it as like a product 2.0 or\nsomething like that?\n\n594\n00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,960\nAnd they say, oh no, let's try and\nget it for launch date, let's try and\n\n595\n00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,100\nget it as part of this project.\n\n596\n00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,750\nAnd you say all right well,\nit's going to take more money, and\n\n597\n00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,490\nit's going to take more time.\n\n598\n00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,850\nAnd the sponsor says, \"well, I'm not okay\non time, I want this on launch date;\n\n599\n00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,490\nI'm cool on money, I can add more\nmoney to the project, we can do that\".\n\n600\n00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,780\nWell that is a change,\nthat the sponsor is pushing,\n\n601\n00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,990\nthey're willing to pay for it,\nmight as well bring it in.\n\n602\n00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,920\nThat's what they want and\nwe'll provide the customer what they need.\n\n603\n00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,390\nSo those type of change requests\nmight originate from somebody\n\n604\n00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,640\nother than the project manager.\n\n605\n00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,870\nThe other place you make a change\nrequest are from contractors.\n\n606\n00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,010\nWhen you contract out to them,\n\n607\n00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,060\nyou've got to contract that specifically\nstates what they're going to be doing.\n\n608\n00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,250\nThat statement of work and all that\nother information they signed off on.\n\n609\n00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,260\nThey might have a change, something\nhappens, something unforeseen, and\n\n610\n00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,610\na change might occur.\n\n611\n00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,260\nSo all of these things,\nthey originated from different places, but\n\n612\n00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,620\nthey go through the same approval process.\n\n613\n00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,990\nWe have our change committee that's\ngoing to review those changes and\n\n614\n00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,300\ndetermine whether or\nnot we should accept them or decline them.\n\n615\n00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,690\nAll right,\nnow enterprise environmental factors,\n\n616\n00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,310\nthat's the way that our\ncompany does business.\n\n617\n00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,660\nAnd if we already have a change advisory\nboard, or a change control system, or\n\n618\n00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,340\nwhatever, we just make use of that,\nall right?\n\n619\n00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,880\nOrganizational process assets,\n\n620\n00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,550\nthat's going to be detailing things like\nthe paperwork, the forms, the bureaucracy.\n\n621\n00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,650\nWhen somebody fills out a change request,\nwhat is that, what is the request?\n\n622\n00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,290\nWell, let me show you an example.\n\n623\n00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,120\nSo I've got a change request right here.\n\n624\n00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,640\nAnd this is an example of what one\nwould look like when we fill it out.\n\n625\n00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,400\nSo you fill it out with\nwhat the project is,\n\n626\n00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,580\nwho the project manager is, when this\nwas prepared, who the requester is.\n\n627\n00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,840\nBecause it might not be\nthe project manager.\n\n628\n00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,610\nAnd a change number if we're\nkeeping track of that.\n\n629\n00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,790\nIt might be blank when you submit it and\nit gets numbered after its submitted.\n\n630\n00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,280\nThen we identify what it\nis we are trying to change.\n\n631\n00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,310\nAre we trying to change our scope?\n\n632\n00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,930\nModifying our requirements list.\n\n633\n00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,540\nThey've got scope and\nrequirements kind of separate here.\n\n634\n00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,580\nDo we modify our quality, costs,\nschedule, just general documentation?\n\n635\n00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,980\nWhat is it that we are wanting to modify?\n\n636\n00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,590\nIt might be a combination of these.\n\n637\n00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,510\nRight?\n\n638\n00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,830\nThen we specify what the change is,\nall right?\n\n639\n00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:50,200\nSo let's say for\nexample that I've got a project and\n\n640\n00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,810\nI was supposed to purchase 40 servers\nfrom Dell, and when it comes time for\n\n641\n00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,780\nme to purchase them, they tell me\nthey're back-ordered, and they say no,\n\n642\n00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,840\ntheir back-order's going\nto be an extra three weeks.\n\n643\n00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,700\nWell I know that's going\nto shoot our schedule.\n\n644\n00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,170\nSo I want to make sure\nthat doesn't happen.\n\n645\n00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,380\nSo I decide, well you know what,\nlet me go and purchase them from HP.\n\n646\n00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,120\nIt's the same price,\njust a different vendor and\n\n647\n00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,990\nI can get them on\nthe schedule that I want.\n\n648\n00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,070\nSo I come in here and\nI say what am I going to modify?\n\n649\n00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,510\nWell I'm actually going to be modifying,\nnot our cost or our schedule, right?\n\n650\n00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,100\nBecause those are going to stay the same.\n\n651\n00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,851\nWhat I'm going to modify are my\nprocurement documents because we're going\n\n652\n00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:26,610\nto be buying from HP instead of Dell,\nand more than likely my requirements.\n\n653\n00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,530\nIf the requirements said we needed\nto purchase the service form Dell,\n\n654\n00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,770\nI'm wanting to change that to HP.\n\n655\n00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,165\nAnd so I'll specify that here in my\ndetailed description of proposed change.\n\n656\n00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:41,032\nI'll say requesting to purchase\n\n657\n00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:45,897\nservers from HP instead of Dell in\n\n658\n00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:50,588\norder to meet schedule plan, or\n\n659\n00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:57,365\nplan schedule and\nthen we can indicate cost and\n\n660\n00:31:57,365 --> 00:32:02,435\nschedule will remain unchanged.\n\n661\n00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:04,189\nWith HP, right.\n\n662\n00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:08,160\nOr maybe it's less money or more money,\nwe may need to indicate that.\n\n663\n00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,280\nJustification for the proposed change?\n\n664\n00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,490\nWell the change results in\nmaintaining the planned schedule\n\n665\n00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:23,890\nwithout incurring additional costs,\nwhich is what I want.\n\n666\n00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,880\nIf it costs more money,\nI would have to justify that and\n\n667\n00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,780\nsay look, we've got two choices here.\n\n668\n00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,150\nWe can spend a little more money now or\nwe can take a three week delay.\n\n669\n00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,430\nWhich one would you rather do?\n\n670\n00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,800\nYou could submit two change tickets.\n\n671\n00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,380\nOne that recommends extending\nthe schedule three weeks.\n\n672\n00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,456\nOne that recommends spending a little\nmore money so you don't have to do it.\n\n673\n00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:43,180\nOne will get approved,\none will get declined.\n\n674\n00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,470\nBut it's not you, the requester,\nthat's making that decision.\n\n675\n00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,310\nIt's the change board\nthat makes that call.\n\n676\n00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,950\nSo you may have two tickets\nthat conflict with each other.\n\n677\n00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,450\nThat's definitely not uncommon.\n\n678\n00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,880\nAll right, so then impactive change.\n\n679\n00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,796\nWell the impact is gonna be negligible so\n\n680\n00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:06,142\nwe might indicate server\nconfiguration software is different.\n\n681\n00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:12,063\nBut functionality impact is negligible,\nright.\n\n682\n00:33:12,063 --> 00:33:15,348\nSo whatever it is that we\nneed to dictate in here.\n\n683\n00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,363\nSo impact is negligible.\n\n684\n00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:26,840\nWhich I think I'm spelling wrong.\n\n685\n00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,560\nYep.\n[LAUGH] There we go, alright,\n\n686\n00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,220\nany other comments that I might\nwanna add and then we submit it.\n\n687\n00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,290\nNow the second page is not for us, the\nsubmitter, it's the change advisory board.\n\n688\n00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,210\nThey are going to review this, okay.\n\n689\n00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,710\nDid we give them enough information,\nright?\n\n690\n00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,260\nI didn't really put all\nthat much data here, right.\n\n691\n00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,930\nSo if we didn't put enough information,\n\n692\n00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,450\nthey may decline this,\nrequesting information, right.\n\n693\n00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,460\nOr they may just decline it out right,\nand say, no,\n\n694\n00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,720\nlets stick with ordering from Dell,\nlets deal with the time delay, right.\n\n695\n00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,390\nOr, they might approve it, and if they\napprove it, they'll indicate that here and\n\n696\n00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,280\njustification for disposition, all right.\n\n697\n00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,350\nIf we decline it, why do we decline it?\n\n698\n00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,290\nIf we approve it, why do we approve it.\n\n699\n00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,550\nAnd if we defer it, right, this is\nusually when we request more information.\n\n700\n00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,850\nWe indicate that here and say,\nwell, you looked at Dell and HP,\n\n701\n00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,010\nare there any vendors, right.\n\n702\n00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,260\nHave you checked anybody else?\n\n703\n00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,460\nOr have we checked to see if there's a\nthird party that sells Dell that we could\n\n704\n00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,010\nhave gone with, right.\n\n705\n00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,930\nAnd then the change control board or\nchange advisory board signs off right\n\n706\n00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,630\nhere, their name, their role,\nand their signature.\n\n707\n00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,630\nAnd now we know who made the decision and\nwhy, all right.\n\n708\n00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:37,340\nThis process right here ensures that\nnobody's making changes to the schedule\n\n709\n00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,590\nwithout proper review happening.\n\n710\n00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,900\nAnd the people doing the review should be\nat a minimum the project manager, right.\n\n711\n00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,520\nSomebody who understands\nthe ramification of that change.\n\n712\n00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,418\nWhat is it gonna do to the rest of\nmy project if I make this change?\n\n713\n00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:50,618\nAll right.\n\n714\n00:34:50,618 --> 00:34:53,645\nWho are some of the other people\nwe might have on that board?\n\n715\n00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:56,130\nWell, at a minimum,\nyou want your project manager.\n\n716\n00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,349\nYou'll normally will have\nyour project sponsor too.\n\n717\n00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:01,735\nThe one who's just ponying up the bill,\nright, the one who is paying for all this.\n\n718\n00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:05,055\nThey had a budget, and\nthey had a schedule that we promised them.\n\n719\n00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:08,155\nNow we wanna change it, so\nthey need to be involved in that.\n\n720\n00:35:08,155 --> 00:35:09,735\nAnd they may be very cool with this stuff.\n\n721\n00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:12,255\nThey may be like,\na couple extra grand, no big deal.\n\n722\n00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:14,192\nOr a couple extra weeks, fine.\n\n723\n00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:15,552\nBut they may be very strict and\n\n724\n00:35:15,552 --> 00:35:19,562\nthey may say what, you promised we would\nhave it on this date for this much money.\n\n725\n00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:20,772\nYou need to make it happen.\n\n726\n00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:24,212\nSo they may be declining that and\nthat's definitely their prerogative.\n\n727\n00:35:24,212 --> 00:35:26,662\nWe made promises,\nwe need to try and keep them.\n\n728\n00:35:26,662 --> 00:35:29,730\nSo those are two people\nwho might be there.\n\n729\n00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,870\nWho else?\n\n730\n00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,210\nSubject men are experts.\n\n731\n00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,060\nRight?\nWe might need to have specialists,\n\n732\n00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,340\npeople who understand this change\nmore in depth as part of that change\n\n733\n00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,490\ncontrol board.\n\n734\n00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,560\nWe might wanna have\nother project managers,\n\n735\n00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,640\nthat's something that I'm kind of fond of.\n\n736\n00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,180\nGetting another project manager\nto get their eyes on this.\n\n737\n00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,250\nA second set of eyes can be very,\nvery handy.\n\n738\n00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,475\nAll right, they sign off on it and\nthat's it.\n\n739\n00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:53,640\nNow the change is in play.\n\n740\n00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,270\nWhen a change request gets approved,\nif we're changing in our case,\n\n741\n00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:02,420\nthe requirements list and other documents,\nI need to go and edit those.\n\n742\n00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,090\nI need to go edit my requirements\nlist to reflect the new requirements.\n\n743\n00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,930\nSo, if we edit our schedule, we need to\ngo edit the schedule to reflect that.\n\n744\n00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,410\nThat becomes part of our baseline.\n\n745\n00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,710\nThat's our new schedule that we followed.\n\n746\n00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,350\nYour schedule,\n\n747\n00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:18,100\nyou really only have one schedule,\nit just changes with each change ticket.\n\n748\n00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,170\nYou wanna record the old ones,\nthe baseline, so\n\n749\n00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,330\nyou can use them in your\nlessons learned later on.\n\n750\n00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,220\nHere's what we thought was gonna happen,\nhere's what actually happened.\n\n751\n00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,810\nBut once a change takes effect, that new\nschedule is the official schedule, so\n\n752\n00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,209\nyou're now living off of that one.\n\n753\n00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,660\nAll right.\n\n754\n00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,610\nNow, whenever there's a change,\nthere might be more than one change.\n\n755\n00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,920\nSo we'll often times\nmaintain a change log.\n\n756\n00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,990\nIt's a good idea.\n\n757\n00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:44,020\nRight, the change ID, the category,\nwhat there was, who submitted it,\n\n758\n00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,380\nthe status, and the disposition, right.\n\n759\n00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,133\nStatus whether it's pending a review,\ndisposition whether it was accepted,\n\n760\n00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:51,824\ndeclined or deferred, all right.\n\n761\n00:36:51,824 --> 00:36:56,411\nSo we keep that track here, each of our\nchanges, cuz you might have five changes,\n\n762\n00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:58,348\nyou might have 5000 changes.\n\n763\n00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:01,259\nIf you've got a ten year project\nyou'll probably have tons of changes\n\n764\n00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:02,230\nacross there.\n\n765\n00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,590\nSo we need to maintain a log so\n\n766\n00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,157\nthat we can keep track of\nwhat changes happened when.\n\n767\n00:37:07,574 --> 00:37:08,158\nAll right.\nSo\n\n768\n00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:12,510\nthose are all key components of that\nchange control and change request process.\n\n769\n00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:15,320\nAll right.\n\n770\n00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,500\nSo the tools and\ntechniques we have expert judgment, right.\n\n771\n00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,323\nWe've gotta use our project management\nknowledge to evaluate the change and\n\n772\n00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,110\nsee how it's gonna impact things.\n\n773\n00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,660\nWe'll probably have to have meetings.\n\n774\n00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,150\nIf you've got to change control board,\n\n775\n00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,600\nyou've gotta get together,\nreview the changes.\n\n776\n00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,030\nIf you need more information, it's a good\nidea to have the people come to you, and\n\n777\n00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,400\nyou can just talk to them and\n\n778\n00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,100\nget that information instead\nof doing report after report.\n\n779\n00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,150\nAnd then change control tools,\n\n780\n00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:45,140\nwell whatever you use as your\nchange control structure.\n\n781\n00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,740\nDo we actually have,\noh we do not have any listed.\n\n782\n00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,180\nBut these are going to be things like\nthe change advisory board itself.\n\n783\n00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,460\nYour change request tickets, and\n\n784\n00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,790\nyour change request tickets can actually\nbe a lot more detailed than this.\n\n785\n00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,660\nFor example, in IT, I almost always\nadd at least one more field to this.\n\n786\n00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,608\nIf they're gonna make a change to\nthe software, right, pushing in a change,\n\n787\n00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:04,992\nI like to have a roll back plan to say,\n\n788\n00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:08,367\nall right, if you're changing the software\nand it doesn't work, how do you roll back?\n\n789\n00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:10,374\nHow do you take that\nchange back out again?\n\n790\n00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:12,820\nSo we can then get back\nto the way we were.\n\n791\n00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,807\nSo you might have a rollback plan or\nthings of those nature,\n\n792\n00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:19,243\nit just depends on what\nyour organization needs.\n\n793\n00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:22,560\nSo those are some of the tools\nthat are available to us.\n\n794\n00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,930\nNow the outputs are gonna be a few things.\n\n795\n00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,130\nThe outputs will most commonly\nbe approved change requests.\n\n796\n00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:33,180\nWe approve them, the change request now\nbecomes part of our project baseline.\n\n797\n00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,780\nSo we go and\nwe update our project management plan and\n\n798\n00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,880\nour project documents, right?\n\n799\n00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,680\nWe update those things, right?\n\n800\n00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,870\nWe also update that change log to\nreflect the change that we made.\n\n801\n00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,610\nVery important there, all right.\n\n802\n00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,550\nThe output could be\na decline change request.\n\n803\n00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:53,430\nNow, PMI doesn't actually detail that here\nas an output but it could be a decline.\n\n804\n00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,400\nIn that case, that's where people\nhave to go back to the drawing board.\n\n805\n00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,720\nEither come up with another solution or\nrevise the proposed solution to\n\n806\n00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,811\nmeet whatever our needs are that\ncaused the decline, all right.\n\n807\n00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,600\nSo a lot of different things happen there.\n\n808\n00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,277\nYou can go out, and there's a lot\nof specific methodologies for\n\n809\n00:39:10,277 --> 00:39:12,170\ndoing change control.\n\n810\n00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,680\nPMI doesn't really care which one you use,\n\n811\n00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,440\nthey just want to make sure\nyou're using one, right.\n\n812\n00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,530\nThat there is a gatekeeper in\nbetween making changes and\n\n813\n00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,010\nactually having them stick.\n\n814\n00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,360\nSo somebody needs to be\ndoing some peer review.\n\n815\n00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,050\nLooking at those changes and\nmaking sure they're good for the project.\n\n816\n00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,820\n>> Yeah one of the hardest things to\nunderstand is when a change occurs in\n\n817\n00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,570\na project and\nnobody knows what has happened.\n\n818\n00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,670\nWho's made the change, who approved it,\nwhen it happened, but it's just done.\n\n819\n00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,750\nSo the idea of actually integrating\nthis into the control process here so\n\n820\n00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,290\nthat we know when it's happening,\n\n821\n00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,640\nit gives us that ability to actually\nbe able to back out if we need to.\n\n822\n00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,090\nOr again to actually accept the change.\n\n823\n00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,282\nIt's just one of those things where if\nyou don't know what's happened, and\n\n824\n00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:53,619\nit's happened what can you do?\n\n825\n00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:56,981\nYou just kinda have to accept it or\nyou have to now actually go back to your\n\n826\n00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:59,631\nproject sponsor and say,\nit's changed at some point.\n\n827\n00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:02,183\nI can't account for it, and\nthat's when you're in trouble.\n\n828\n00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:05,260\n>> Yeah, and the other scenario is\nwhen you have two changes at once.\n\n829\n00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,440\nRight, if you have two people who\nare making adjustments and they're bumping\n\n830\n00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,640\ninto each other, right, with the change\nadvisory board you're controlling that.\n\n831\n00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,780\nYou're setting them up in a sequential\norder and they see all the changes so\n\n832\n00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,320\nthey would know if two different ones\nwere happening at the same time.\n\n833\n00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,870\nBut it does require people to\nfollow that change process.\n\n834\n00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,610\nWhatever it is that we set up in our\norganization, the employees have to\n\n835\n00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,390\nfollow it, they're the ones that have\nto obey the rules that we set aside.\n\n836\n00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,500\n>> Yeah, awesome.\n\n837\n00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,800\n>> So that's pretty much integrated change\ncontrol, I know it doesn't seem like a ton\n\n838\n00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,690\nhere, but it's probably one of\nthe most important processes we have\n\n839\n00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,590\nin monitoring and controlling, because\nthis is how we correct, how we control.\n\n840\n00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,538\nIt's the tool that we use, and we're gonna\ntalk about a lot of other things as we\n\n841\n00:40:45,538 --> 00:40:48,149\ngo through this section, but\nthat's one of the more important ones.\n\n842\n00:40:48,149 --> 00:40:49,093\n>> Right.\n\n843\n00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:52,210\n>> All right, well let's stop here and\ntake a break.\n\n844\n00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,430\nWhen we get back we're gonna take a look\nat some other process groups we've got\n\n845\n00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,300\nscope management,\nthat we're gonna talk about next.\n\n846\n00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,210\nValidating and controlling scope.\n\n847\n00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,180\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n848\n00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,377\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n849\n00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:10,819\n[MUSIC]\n\n850\n00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:12,502\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n851\n00:41:12,502 --> 00:41:16,280\nSo now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to take a look at our scope.\n\n852\n00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,630\nMonitoring and controlling the scope.\n\n853\n00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,700\nThe scope you'll remember from\nway back in the beginning\n\n854\n00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,605\nis pretty important in the project.\n\n855\n00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,995\nIt's where we lay out what it is\nwe hope to achieve, right, and\n\n856\n00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:27,585\nour list of requirements.\n\n857\n00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:31,095\nNow we're normally going to\nincorporate our schedule and\n\n858\n00:41:31,095 --> 00:41:33,395\nour budget into the scope, but\nlet's put those out of our mind for\n\n859\n00:41:33,395 --> 00:41:35,755\nright now because they have their\nown processes for management.\n\n860\n00:41:35,755 --> 00:41:39,605\nSo, what's left in the scope is\nreally your requirements list.\n\n861\n00:41:39,605 --> 00:41:42,151\nHow do we ensure that our\nrequirements are being met?\n\n862\n00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:45,553\nAnd for that we have the validate\nscope process, all right.\n\n863\n00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:49,512\nThe process is really straight forward\nbecause what you're really doing is just\n\n864\n00:41:49,512 --> 00:41:52,490\ntaking your requirements list and\nmaking sure it gets done.\n\n865\n00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,470\nI mean, how hard is that?\n\n866\n00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,270\nYou know it's just doing basic\ninspection of what's happening.\n\n867\n00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,990\nSo, if we look at our inputs,\nour project management plan, right,\n\n868\n00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,780\nwhich includes things\nlike our Scope Statement.\n\n869\n00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,050\nAnd our requirements documentation\nwhich is typically attached to\n\n870\n00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,790\nthe Scope Statement, so\nwe've got that information.\n\n871\n00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:13,110\nOur requirements Traceability Matrix\nis important because,\n\n872\n00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,680\nif we have some kind of\nissue with a requirement,\n\n873\n00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,550\nwe need to know who is responsible for\nthat requirement, who is responsible for\n\n874\n00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,080\ndoing it, also who created that\nrequirement, so we can reach out to them.\n\n875\n00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,130\nSo that's supporting\ninformation that we need.\n\n876\n00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,010\nAre verified deliverables.\n\n877\n00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,300\nNow, this one was always a weird one for\nme.\n\n878\n00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,270\nHere I am validating my scope, and\nI've already got verified deliverables,\n\n879\n00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,650\nwhat's that all about?\n\n880\n00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,030\nWell, when you're dealing with a project\nteam, they're creating Deliverables.\n\n881\n00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,670\nThe Deliverables usually\nmatch up with Milestones.\n\n882\n00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,010\nThey're not necessarily the final product.\n\n883\n00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,490\nYou might have five different deliverables\nthat all combined create your\n\n884\n00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,510\nfinal product that meet your scope and\nrequirements list.\n\n885\n00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:57,370\nSo a deliverable by itself is\nnot necessarily the end result\n\n886\n00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,552\nof your project.\n\n887\n00:42:58,552 --> 00:42:59,081\nRight?\n\n888\n00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:02,990\nSo we just need to be aware that there\nis some variation in terminology there.\n\n889\n00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,070\nSo, when somebody creates a Deliverable,\nwhen they provide a service or\n\n890\n00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,010\na good, we have our acceptance criteria.\n\n891\n00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,220\nHow do we know whether it meets\nour needs or what we specified?\n\n892\n00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:19,730\nAnd if it meets all of our specifications,\nthen it becomes an Accepted Deliverable.\n\n893\n00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,990\nWe need that here for validate scope\nbecause that accepted deliverable,\n\n894\n00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:26,770\nthat verified deliverable,\nis gonna be a part of our final scope.\n\n895\n00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,560\nIt's gonna meet at least a portion\nof the requirements that we've got.\n\n896\n00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,810\nAnd then our work performance data\nto see how people are moving along.\n\n897\n00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,390\nAll key components of\nvalidating the Scope.\n\n898\n00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,990\nAs far as what we apply to it though,\nthese not really much to this one.\n\n899\n00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,750\nInspection is the number one entry, and\nusually it's the only for an Inspection.\n\n900\n00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,430\nWe look at the work that's being done,\n\n901\n00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,210\nthe work that's being produced and\nrun it down our check list.\n\n902\n00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,570\nIs it meeting our requirements?\n\n903\n00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,480\nDoes it meet what we specified out in the\nvery beginning of this project, all right.\n\n904\n00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,740\nSo if I required a four bedroom house\nto be built, I don't have to wait for\n\n905\n00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,310\nthe house to be done to verify\nthat it has four bedrooms.\n\n906\n00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,570\nAfter they've laid the foundation and\nthey start framing the walls\n\n907\n00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,450\nI can walk in there and see,\ndid they lay out four bedrooms, right?\n\n908\n00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:12,830\nDoesn't match up with\nthe blueprints that we specified.\n\n909\n00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,310\nA simple inspection will reflect that.\n\n910\n00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:21,040\nIf it doesn't meet our requirements,\nthen we can take action then.\n\n911\n00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,560\nIt's much easier to fix a house that's\nframed out incorrectly if it was just\n\n912\n00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,580\nframed versus once they have the drywall\nand the roof on and all that other stuff.\n\n913\n00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,510\nThen it becomes a nightmare\nto redesign it.\n\n914\n00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,920\nSo we wanna catch this stuff early.\n\n915\n00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,520\nValidating the Scope\nis an ongoing process.\n\n916\n00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,070\nWe're doing it over and over and\n\n917\n00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,590\nover again while the execution\nof these is going on.\n\n918\n00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,250\nWe're monitoring and controlling.\n\n919\n00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,650\nThey're executing.\n\n920\n00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,830\nWatch what they do.\n\n921\n00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:45,870\nInspect it.\n\n922\n00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:47,108\nAnd make sure it meets your needs.\n\n923\n00:44:47,108 --> 00:44:47,687\nAll right.\n\n924\n00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:51,810\nWhat if it's something beyond your\ntalents and abilities though, right?\n\n925\n00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,290\nThere's a lot of things that\nyou might not be an expert in.\n\n926\n00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,630\nSo, in that case we might need things\nlike group decision making techniques.\n\n927\n00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,930\nWhere you bring your group together\nto evaluate that information and\n\n928\n00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,520\ncome up with that\ndecision as to whether or\n\n929\n00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,830\nnot our Scope is being accurately\nreflected in the work that's being done.\n\n930\n00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:10,470\nSo that's stuff we need to keep an eye\non to keep the project moving forward.\n\n931\n00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,560\nThe biggest thing to remember is that\nthe earlier you catch a Variance,\n\n932\n00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,350\nthe more time you have to fix it.\n\n933\n00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,400\nThe later you catch that variance,\nthe harder it becomes to fix it.\n\n934\n00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,200\nThere's more things you have to change.\n\n935\n00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,130\nSo, changing a project\nbecomes very dangerous\n\n936\n00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,620\nlater on in the life of the project.\n\n937\n00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,130\nWe always wanna try and\ncatch that stuff early.\n\n938\n00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,260\nOur Outputs are pretty straight forward.\n\n939\n00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,860\nIf you have a Verified Deliverable,\na deliverable you've received, and it\n\n940\n00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:38,220\nmatches everything that you've specified\nin your requirements under inspection.\n\n941\n00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,680\nThen it becomes an Accepted Deliverable.\n\n942\n00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,130\nWe accept it, it is what we asked for\nin this project.\n\n943\n00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,450\nIt does provide what we needed.\n\n944\n00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,840\nSo that's an Accepted Deliverable.\n\n945\n00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,190\nThat's the difference between\na verified and they accept it.\n\n946\n00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,330\nIf it doesn't meet our requirements,\nif it isn't in line with our scope, then\n\n947\n00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:01,310\nwe go into change requests, and change\nrequest is gonna be one of two things.\n\n948\n00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:06,860\nEither one, providing more resources to\ncorrect the mistake either more money,\n\n949\n00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,140\nmore time or\nmore people to correct the mistake.\n\n950\n00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,840\nOr two, it's going to be and\nadjustment to the requirements.\n\n951\n00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,520\nTo change the requirements and\neliminate some of the items in\n\n952\n00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,986\nthe requirements list to match\nthe deliverable that I actually got right.\n\n953\n00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,730\nMaybe I am dealing with developers,\nprogrammers, and\n\n954\n00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,200\nthey're writing a special website for me.\n\n955\n00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,919\nAnd I had my Primary Objectives,\none through five.\n\n956\n00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:32,420\nAnd then I had some secondary objectives,\none through ten.\n\n957\n00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,740\nAnd they met one through five.\n\n958\n00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,635\nBut they were only able to get through\na handful of the sub objectives.\n\n959\n00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:41,860\nRight, the secondary ones that I didn't\nnecessarily care about as essential.\n\n960\n00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,680\nHe only met half of them.\n\n961\n00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,350\nWhat I might do is,\nI might looked at it and say, okay.\n\n962\n00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,510\nHe only met half of them,\nbut I'm okay with that.\n\n963\n00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,950\nI'll do a change ticket that says, let's\njust trim off those other ones that we\n\n964\n00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,700\ndidn't meet and we'll move those\ninto another project somewhere else.\n\n965\n00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,790\nI don't need to assign more time.\n\n966\n00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,515\nI don't need to assign more\nresources in this project.\n\n967\n00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,780\nI'm just removing those requirements.\n\n968\n00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,450\nSo, that's very possible.\n\n969\n00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,850\nEspecially, when you've got\ncontingency type items in your plant.\n\n970\n00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,960\n>> The validity in the scope for us really\nhelps us to make sure that we continue on\n\n971\n00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:18,130\nthat progress here and that we\nare making true progress in our project.\n\n972\n00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,070\nWithout the idea of being\nable to validate this.\n\n973\n00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,290\nWe're just trusting that\neverybody's actually saying.\n\n974\n00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,720\nI'm getting done what I\nneed to get done here.\n\n975\n00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,130\nValidation is a good way to go okay,\nhere's where you should be and\n\n976\n00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:33,330\nI'm here to check it so that we know that\nwe're actually continuing on this process.\n\n977\n00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,430\nSo, the obvious skipping of this\nvalidation is not something we want to do.\n\n978\n00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,870\n>> Yeah, otherwise you would end up with\na situation where people complete all\n\n979\n00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:41,760\ntheir work.\n\n980\n00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,270\nAnd there may have been mistakes\nthat were made that weren't caught.\n\n981\n00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,870\nAnd now it's done.\n\n982\n00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,590\nIt's really hard to go back and\nmake those changes.\n\n983\n00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:49,320\nAll right.\n\n984\n00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,280\nThe last things we have here for\noutputs work performance information.\n\n985\n00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,761\nRight?\nWhich is just interpreted\n\n986\n00:47:53,761 --> 00:47:55,018\nwork performance data.\n\n987\n00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:56,319\nAnd project document updates.\n\n988\n00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,444\nRight?\nIf we chose to change our scope or\n\n989\n00:47:58,444 --> 00:48:01,435\nwhatever then we need to go and\nmake those modifications.\n\n990\n00:48:01,435 --> 00:48:02,943\nBut all in all this is\nreally straightforward.\n\n991\n00:48:02,943 --> 00:48:04,985\nIt does really boil down to inspection.\n\n992\n00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:08,493\nYou go and examine what's being done,\nyou run down your list of requirements and\n\n993\n00:48:08,493 --> 00:48:10,150\nmake sure that they're being met.\n\n994\n00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,700\nYou tick them off as you go, check, check,\n\n995\n00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,055\ncheck, and when they're all checked\nyour project is done, well in theory.\n\n996\n00:48:16,055 --> 00:48:18,120\n[LAUGH] So\n\n997\n00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,220\nthe next process we're gonna take\na look at is the control scope process.\n\n998\n00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,830\nNow, that sounds a lot like validate\nscope that we just talked about.\n\n999\n00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,090\nAnd they really go hand in hand.\n\n1000\n00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,000\nYou don't do one without the other.\n\n1001\n00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,720\nValidating the scope was all\nabout gathering data and\n\n1002\n00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,550\nmaking sure the work that was being\ndone conformed to our requirements list.\n\n1003\n00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,010\nControlling the scope is\nmaking sure that we don't\n\n1004\n00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:42,920\ngo beyond [LAUGH] what's really\nhappening inside our scope statement.\n\n1005\n00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,340\nThis is something that\nis very very common.\n\n1006\n00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,120\nWe have a term that is called scope creep.\n\n1007\n00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,600\nThat's where people start adding\nstuff to your project after the fact.\n\n1008\n00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,550\nSure, you define this nice little scope.\n\n1009\n00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,430\nA list of requirements for\na website that's gonna be designed.\n\n1010\n00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,600\nThen, as you're going through it,\nthe sponsor or whoever comes in and says,\n\n1011\n00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,250\nyou know,\ncan we change that background to be blue?\n\n1012\n00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,460\nThat's innocent request.\n\n1013\n00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,440\nNot a big deal.\nSure, we'll change it to blue, right?\n\n1014\n00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,110\nWe won't even do a change statement.\n\n1015\n00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,090\nWe'll just go ahead and do that.\n\n1016\n00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,150\nNot a big deal.\n\n1017\n00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,550\nI say, well, while you are in there,\ncan you change this text around?\n\n1018\n00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,010\nI really don't like that font.\n\n1019\n00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,090\nCan we make that bigger?\n\n1020\n00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,680\nAll the sudden, it starts to snowball.\n\n1021\n00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,950\nIt gets bigger and bigger.\n\n1022\n00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,080\nAll of the sudden, you are spending so\n\n1023\n00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,410\nmuch time on all these innocent changes,\nyou fall behind on the other activities.\n\n1024\n00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,520\nThat's scope creep.\n\n1025\n00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,700\nIt's a very real problem, very prominent.\n\n1026\n00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:31,190\nEspecially when the extra add\nons are coming from the sponsor,\n\n1027\n00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:32,940\nthe person who's paying for all of this.\n\n1028\n00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,980\nAll the sudden,\nyour project gets outta hand.\n\n1029\n00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,990\nControlling the scope is all about\nmaking sure that doesn't happen.\n\n1030\n00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,910\nMaking sure that the work that's being\ndone is in line with what's defined in our\n\n1031\n00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:45,310\nscope and requirements documentation.\n\n1032\n00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:51,640\nThe inputs for it are almost\nidentical to validating the scope.\n\n1033\n00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,010\nProject management plan, right?\n\n1034\n00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:54,920\nThat's where our scope\nstatement is stored.\n\n1035\n00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,770\nOur requirements documentation,\n\n1036\n00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,490\nbasically the check list of\nwhat should be happening.\n\n1037\n00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,600\nOur requirements traceability matrix.\n\n1038\n00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,380\nWho it was that's tied to\neach of these requirements.\n\n1039\n00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:09,150\nWho's responsible for completing it,\nor who initiated that requirement.\n\n1040\n00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:12,010\nOur work performance data that we're\ngathering from the employees that\n\n1041\n00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,200\nare working in the field.\n\n1042\n00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,480\nAnd finally our organizational\nprocess assets like we always see.\n\n1043\n00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,330\nAlmost identical to what\nwe had with validate scope.\n\n1044\n00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,630\nThe big different here is our tool and\ntechnique.\n\n1045\n00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:24,730\nWe have variance analysis.\n\n1046\n00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,330\nUnder validated scope our main\nthing was inspection, right?\n\n1047\n00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:30,240\nWe would go in and inspect the work and\nsee what was going on.\n\n1048\n00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,450\nVariance analysis though\nis a lot different.\n\n1049\n00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,310\nThis is where we look\nat what's been done and\n\n1050\n00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:38,230\nwe compare it to what should've\nbeen done and look for deviations.\n\n1051\n00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,560\nRequirements are easy to measure on.\n\n1052\n00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,470\nIf there were requirements that\nweren't done, you spot them, right?\n\n1053\n00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,130\nBut things like schedule and\nbudget, right, our time and\n\n1054\n00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,800\nour money, if we see variations there,\nwe need to ask the question of why.\n\n1055\n00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,880\nWhy have we spent more money\nthen we should of, right?\n\n1056\n00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,820\nOr why haven't we spent as\nmuch money as we planned?\n\n1057\n00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,380\nEither one can indicate\nwork that hasn't been done.\n\n1058\n00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,030\nIf you spent too much money,\nyou probably have scope creep.\n\n1059\n00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:06,320\nNew things have worked their way in and\nyou're wasting money on them, right?\n\n1060\n00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,220\nOr people are not\n\n1061\n00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,370\ndoing the work they said they were doing\n>> Right.\n\n1062\n00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:13,140\n>> If you haven't spent enough money,\nit usually means people are behind.\n\n1063\n00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,440\nThey haven't gotten certain activities yet\nthat require us to spend money.\n\n1064\n00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,740\nSo even though it looks\nlike you're under budget,\n\n1065\n00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,890\nyou're actually falling\nbehind on the project.\n\n1066\n00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:22,850\nSo we need to monitor for that variance.\n\n1067\n00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,040\nAnd this is where our\nEarned Value Analysis comes in, EVA, and\n\n1068\n00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,930\nEarned Value Management, EVM.\n\n1069\n00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,950\nWe're going to talk about\nthose in the next episode.\n\n1070\n00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:35,540\nBut they're all tools at our disposal to\ngo and identify where we're deviating,\n\n1071\n00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,890\nwhere we've got that variance\nfrom our original plan.\n\n1072\n00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:42,430\nAlmost always indicates that\nsomething has happened to our scope,\n\n1073\n00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,360\nthat we're not following it.\n\n1074\n00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:47,780\n>> A lot of times, in terms of\nchanges that end up going on and\n\n1075\n00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,720\ngetting scope creep, and we actually\nend up with scope creep in our project.\n\n1076\n00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,730\nWhat ends up happening here is that\nit's not that changes can't go on.\n\n1077\n00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:58,260\nWe already talked about the processing\nof integrating change management.\n\n1078\n00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,520\nAnd those are accounted for.\n\n1079\n00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,030\nWhat we're worried about here is the idea,\n\n1080\n00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,100\nthe uncontrolled changes\nthat end up getting that in.\n\n1081\n00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,660\nThe uncontrolled expansion\nthat we have here.\n\n1082\n00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,220\nAnd variance analysis is what will\nhelp us to identify especially that.\n\n1083\n00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,310\nWhen we're actually close to the end or\nwhen we're starting this process.\n\n1084\n00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:19,460\nEither way, we're gonna see\nthat without this particular\n\n1085\n00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,730\npart of the variance analysis, very\ndifficult for us to even know where we\n\n1086\n00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:27,050\nactually started that scope creep and\nhow to even control it.\n\n1087\n00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,160\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1088\n00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,350\nSo you guys see where this really fits in.\n\n1089\n00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> With validate scope.\n\n1090\n00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:32,620\nWe do this hand to hand.\n\n1091\n00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,350\nYou typically do them at the same time.\n\n1092\n00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,520\nWe don't even really treat\nthem as separate processes.\n\n1093\n00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,110\n>> Yeah.\n\n1094\n00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:40,540\n>> And I imagine in some future version of\nthe PMBOK, it'll just combine these two.\n\n1095\n00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,290\nBut for right now the idea is\nthat it is a little bit separate,\n\n1096\n00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,380\nthat validating the scope,\njust making sure we meet our requirements.\n\n1097\n00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,160\nControlling the scope, making sure we\ndon't deviate from those requirements.\n\n1098\n00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,300\nJust kind of two separate ideas.\n\n1099\n00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,150\nOur outputs, again almost\nidentical to validate the scope.\n\n1100\n00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:59,520\nOur work performance information,\nwhat's been done,\n\n1101\n00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,250\nwhich is just interpretations\nof work performance data.\n\n1102\n00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:07,240\nWe've got change requests anything we\nneed to modify to get back in line.\n\n1103\n00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,110\nOur project management plan updates,\n\n1104\n00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:12,180\nif those requests are approved\nwe gotta modify the plan.\n\n1105\n00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,640\nProject document updates and\n\n1106\n00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:18,600\norganizational process asset updates\nalso right, all pretty much in line so.\n\n1107\n00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,310\nVery, very similar.\n\n1108\n00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,460\nIf I were to flip back and\nforth between these two,\n\n1109\n00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,720\nyou'll notice that they\nare almost identical.\n\n1110\n00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,500\nA few extra outputs on control,\nbut very similar.\n\n1111\n00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,750\nStill two separate entities.\n\n1112\n00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,460\nThat makes it really easy to\nconfuse them on the exam.\n\n1113\n00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,910\nSo these are good ones that we need to\nmemorize, and make sure that we remember.\n\n1114\n00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,540\nAll right,\nwell that pretty much wraps up that piece.\n\n1115\n00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,120\nI know it seems like we've been\nmoving through these pretty quick\n\n1116\n00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:41,710\nunder monitoring and\n\n1117\n00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:45,480\ncontrolling, we just knocked out these\nfirst two knowledge areas, right?\n\n1118\n00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,750\nBut we're about to move into some really\ncomplex things, controlling the schedule\n\n1119\n00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,460\nand controlling costs and that's when\nwe're going to break into our formulas,\n\n1120\n00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,320\nso we don't want to jump into it today,\n\n1121\n00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,520\nwe don't have enough time\nleft in this episode.\n\n1122\n00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,810\nBut in our next episode we're gonna\ndive into that world of formulas and\n\n1123\n00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:05,000\nit's going to be a ton of fun, right?\n\n1124\n00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,560\n>> Yes. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\nAnyhow it can be a lot of fun,\n\n1125\n00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,890\nit depends on you apply it.\n\n1126\n00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,800\nBut we'll get a chance\nto see that next time.\n\n1127\n00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,670\nWell let me remind you guys,\n\n1128\n00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:16,480\nif you have questions on anything\nwe've covered here feel free to ask.\n\n1129\n00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,770\nLive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1130\n00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:22,150\nYou'll see the chat box\nright beneath the video.\n\n1131\n00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,890\nPost your questions.\n\n1132\n00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,770\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n1133\n00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:29,030\nIf you have questions after the show\nwhen we're in reruns, use our Q and\n\n1134\n00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:34,010\nA forums, at the top of every page is\na link that says Q and A, click on it.\n\n1135\n00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:34,850\nIt takes you to the forums,\n\n1136\n00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:38,190\nyou can post your questions there,\nwe monitor and answer.\n\n1137\n00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,408\nTake advantage of that resource,\nit is there for you.\n\n1138\n00:54:40,408 --> 00:54:41,520\n>> Right.\n>> All right,\n\n1139\n00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,430\nwell I hope you enjoyed the show,\nsigning off for IT Pro TV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n1140\n00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:46,280\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n1141\n00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,481\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n1142\n00:54:47,481 --> 00:54:57,481\n[MUSIC]\n\n1143\n00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:05,480\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:38,770\nTo another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,650\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,860\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie

possibility of a Full House reunion.\n\n9\n00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,070\n>> No way.\n\n10\n00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,865\n>> Yes, in the near future, so.\n\n11\n00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:53,440\n[LAUGH]\n>> The reunions,\n\n12\n00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,880\nthey always kill me, cuz\n>> There's always like one cast member\n\n13\n00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,850\nwho's gone crazy so [LAUGH] we should\nhave an ITProTV reunion one day.\n\n14\n00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,620\nDo we have anybody that been\nentered into a psychological ward?\n\n15\n00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,470\n>> We don't talk about it anymore, Don.\n\n16\n00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,520\nWe've stopped talking about\nthose issues anymore.\n\n17\n00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,620\n>> All right, well.\n\n18\n00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,960\n>> We're gonna dive back into\nproject management today,\n\n19\n00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,160\nand this next couple of process,\n\n20\n00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,260\nit's kinda interesting and let me just\njump into my process group schedule here.\n\n21\n00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,135\nIt's kind of interesting because\nit's a little bit confusing,\n\n22\n00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:27,540\nthat blend together a good bit.\n\n23\n00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,320\nSo we've been going through our monitoring\nand controlling and we did validate scope,\n\n24\n00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,780\ncontrol scope,\npretty straightforward stuff there.\n\n25\n00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,450\nNow we're ready to look at control\nschedule and control costs and\n\n26\n00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,100\nthese are very, very important.\n\n27\n00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,450\n>> Right.\n>> When we deal with a project,\n\n28\n00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,050\nmaking sure you hit your requirements,\nthat's pretty cut and dry.\n\n29\n00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,620\nYou either hit them your you don't, right?\n\n30\n00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,280\nThere's no gray areas.\n\n31\n00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,970\nBut when it comes to cost and\nschedule it's a moving target.\n\n32\n00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,400\n>> Right.\n>> It's constantly changing,\n\n33\n00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,540\nreally hard to keep track of,\nso in this episode we're gonna\n\n34\n00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,530\ntalk about the general process\nof controlling the schedule and\n\n35\n00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,440\ncontrolling the costs\n>> And we'll talk about how we do that,\n\n36\n00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,050\nhow we watch the numbers and\nthe actions we can take to correct those.\n\n37\n00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,760\nBut a big piece of what the PMI calls for\n\n38\n00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,420\nin doing these is what's called EVM or\nEarned Value Management.\n\n39\n00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,620\nAnd EVM requires a ton of formulas.\n\n40\n00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,900\nFor a lot of people they've never done\nit by hand, or they're intimidated\n\n41\n00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,890\nby the math or whatever it's really\nnot that bad once you learn it.\n\n42\n00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,330\nBut what we want to do is we want to\nsplit that off into a separate episode.\n\n43\n00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,450\nSo for this episode we're gonna\nfocus on the processes themselves.\n\n44\n00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,610\nAnd then, in our next episode,\nwe'll go formula crazy.\n\n45\n00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,740\nRight?\nIt'll be like Formula One up in here.\n\n46\n00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,265\nWhy not?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n47\n00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,120\n>> So anyhow,\n\n48\n00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,770\nthat's what we're gonna\ntackle with the next episode.\n\n49\n00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,860\nBut, for right now,\nlet's take a look at these process groups.\n\n50\n00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,730\nSo, what we'll go ahead and\nstart with schedule.\n\n51\n00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,340\nControlling our schedule, in a real\ngeneral sense, what does that mean?\n\n52\n00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,070\nWell, if you have a specific end\npoint of your project, a date\n\n53\n00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,460\nthat you need to finish by, December 31,\n2015, we've got to be done by then.\n\n54\n00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,120\nHow do we watch the activities\nbeing performed on our project\n\n55\n00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,660\nto ensure that we're done by December 31,\n2015?\n\n56\n00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,880\nYou don't wait until December\n30th 2015 to decide, \"Wow,\n\n57\n00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,220\nI don't think we're gonna make that date.\"\n>> All throughout the project.\n\n58\n00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,050\nStarting on day one of execution,\n\n59\n00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,090\nyou start monitoring to see whether or\nnot you're going to be in line.\n\n60\n00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,525\nAnd then hopefully you don't\nhave to take any actions.\n\n61\n00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:36,845\nThings go nice and smooth.\n\n62\n00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:39,415\nBut if things start to fall behind or\n\n63\n00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:41,775\nthings start to get ahead\nthat's when we step in.\n\n64\n00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:45,555\nNow before I jump in to the process\nitself let me just cover\n\n65\n00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:49,815\none other real important concept and\nthat's the concept of variance.\n\n66\n00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,960\nI know I've used that word before but\n\n67\n00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,020\nI wanna show you guys the PMI's\ndefinition [LAUGH] of variance.\n\n68\n00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,450\nAnd really what it is.\n\n69\n00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,280\nVariance at its heart and soul if you\nboil it down is just the difference\n\n70\n00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,850\nbetween what you plan to happen and\nwhat's actually happened.\n\n71\n00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,680\nSo we might make a chart, for example, and\n\n72\n00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,190\nactually I think I did\nthis before the show.\n\n73\n00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,570\nYou can think I had planned for\nthis, there we go.\n\n74\n00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,990\nShowing what our plan is right?\n\n75\n00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,736\nDuring the planning phase,\nmaybe I charted out and\n\n76\n00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:25,680\nlet's say that over here\non the left is our budget.\n\n77\n00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120\nHow much money we've spent.\n\n78\n00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,300\nAnd over here on the bottom side,\n\n79\n00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,270\nthis will be how much\n>> Time has passed.\n\n80\n00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,460\nSo I've expected to spend a certain amount\nof money across time til I get to the end\n\n81\n00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,830\nof my project and that's the total amount\nof money that I would have spent, right?\n\n82\n00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,880\nSo that's my plan.\n\n83\n00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,240\nThat's what we come up with\nin the planning phase.\n\n84\n00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,880\nAs out project goes on we\nstart to track that and\n\n85\n00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,520\nwe set up our various time intervals.\n\n86\n00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,430\nSo maybe at month two, and\nthen at month four, month six, or\n\n87\n00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,110\nwhatever our measuring interval is,\nwe start tracking that expense.\n\n88\n00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,250\nRight, that money we spent, and we start\nto notice right here that we're getting\n\n89\n00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,080\na little over budget, and that we're\ngetting a little more, and a little more,\n\n90\n00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,420\nuntil we reach down here where\nwe've got a huge difference between\n\n91\n00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,570\nwhat's actually happening and\nwhat we plan for.\n\n92\n00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,330\nAnd the difference between them,\nthat's our variance.\n\n93\n00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,940\nIn this example, it would be\nthe amount we went over budget.\n\n94\n00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,470\nRight.\n\n95\n00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,970\nBut in terms of time, right, cuz we're\ntalking about schedule right now,\n\n96\n00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,910\nthis might be here's you're\nmeasurement of time.\n\n97\n00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,910\nAnd here's the measurement of the amount\nof work we expected to get done, so\n\n98\n00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,830\nI expected to have a certain amount\nof work done in my plan, and\n\n99\n00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,320\nI find as we move along that I'm\nactually getting further and\n\n100\n00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,840\nfurther ahead, and so\nwhen I look at my numbers right here,\n\n101\n00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,790\nI can see this huge difference between the\namount of work I planned to get done and\n\n102\n00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,070\nthe amount of work that was actually done,\nthis is great, right?\n\n103\n00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,980\nI got a lot of extra work done.\n\n104\n00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,820\nWell, I probably need to go evaluate that\nand find out what's going on, right?\n\n105\n00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,240\nUsually it's one of two things either one,\npeople are cutting corners, right?\n\n106\n00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,770\nSo some of the work is not\nactually getting done or\n\n107\n00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,280\nit's not being done right,or two\n>> More work is getting done, but\n\n108\n00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,660\nyou're paying for it.\n\n109\n00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,480\nOT, extra people.\n\n110\n00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,210\nOvertime, you know.\n\n111\n00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,740\nExtra people, things like that.\n\n112\n00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,510\nSo while we might be ahead of schedule,\nour budget may be out of whack.\n\n113\n00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,910\nWe may be paying more to get there.\n\n114\n00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,000\nSo, just because I'm ahead of schedule\ndoesn't mean that's a great thing.\n\n115\n00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,220\nI may need to go and revisit that and\nfind out what's going on.\n\n116\n00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,780\nSo, we have what we planned for,\nwhat's actually happening, and\n\n117\n00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,500\nvariance is simply\nthe difference between the two.\n\n118\n00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,620\nSo, when we talk about\nthe control schedule process,\n\n119\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,940\nwhat we're really talking\nabout is measuring variance.\n\n120\n00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,980\nOnce that difference and\nthen taking actions upon it.\n\n121\n00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,120\nAlright so, for the schedule side of\nthings, to do this we need to gather data.\n\n122\n00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,180\nAnd that data comes in as our plan.\n\n123\n00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,080\nYour project management plan\nserves as your baseline.\n\n124\n00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,350\nYour plan tells you what you should\nhave achieved at certain dates.\n\n125\n00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,970\nYour schedule, that information,\nyour work break down structure,\n\n126\n00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,879\nit's all in there, the data that you need.\n\n127\n00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,530\nThen our project schedule which\nagain is part of our plan,\n\n128\n00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,650\nthen our work performance data.\n\n129\n00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,060\nThe project schedule is\nwhat should have been done,\n\n130\n00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,090\nthe work performance data\nis what actually was done.\n\n131\n00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,350\nThose are the two things that we need to\ncompare the difference between the two\n\n132\n00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,870\nresulting in our variance.\n\n133\n00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,360\nAnd now,\nwe know whether we are ahead or behind.\n\n134\n00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,230\nRight?\nIt's pretty straight forward.\n\n135\n00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,940\nAnd, you know, when you say it like that.\n\n136\n00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,590\nWhen you just speak the words,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n137\n00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,860\nBut, that was actually a formula, right?\n\n138\n00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,830\nThe planned value, the planned work,\nversus the actual work.\n\n139\n00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,590\nYou take one, subtract the other,\nand your result is your variance.\n\n140\n00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,240\nThat's one of the formulas\nthat we'll see later on.\n\n141\n00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,760\nThere's actually a ton of formulas,\nbut they're mostly common sense so\n\n142\n00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,060\nif you think about it logically\nthis stuff kind of snaps together.\n\n143\n00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,540\nWe also have our project calendars.\n\n144\n00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,520\nNow, notice how we've got a project\nschedule and a project calendar.\n\n145\n00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,281\nWhat's the difference, right?\n\n146\n00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:57,411\nWell, a project schedule is showing\nthings like the work to be done\n\n147\n00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,421\nat particular periods of time.\n\n148\n00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:04,178\nIt's not taking into account, in a lot of\ncases The availability of our resources,\n\n149\n00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:06,864\nwe have to schedule our\nresources separately.\n\n150\n00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:11,130\nSo we may have calendars that\nare built around that, holidays,\n\n151\n00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,250\nother things like that.\n\n152\n00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,750\nA holiday is not an activity\nin your project schedule, but\n\n153\n00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,320\nit is in the project calendar is\na period where work can't get done, so\n\n154\n00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,230\nit's kind of a differentiator there.\n\n155\n00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,880\nNow I'll be honest with you, for me,\n\n156\n00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,290\nI always get confused dealing\nwith multiple sources.\n\n157\n00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,520\nSo I usually log holidays as an activity\njust to be able to track them a little\n\n158\n00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,970\nmore easily, but employee vacations, you\ndon't want to track that as an activity.\n\n159\n00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,180\nSo, those are scenarios where\nyou'd still have those calendars.\n\n160\n00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,270\nAny other schedule data that we have, and\n\n161\n00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,970\nthat schedule data may include what\nresources were assigned to an activity and\n\n162\n00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,400\nthings like the times during\na day where they work.\n\n163\n00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,980\nIf I'm tracking work, then I say there's\neight hours of work schedule for that day,\n\n164\n00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,680\nI usually don't care if its eight\nhours performed all in the morning or\n\n165\n00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,730\nall in the afternoon, or\nspread between the two,\n\n166\n00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,720\nas long as the eight\nhours of work gets done.\n\n167\n00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,780\nIf you're on a construction project,\n\n168\n00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,310\ndoesn't matter what time a day the work\ngets done as long as it gets done.\n\n169\n00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,780\nBut there are some scenarios where you're\ntrying to coordinate resources those\n\n170\n00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,430\ntimes become very important.\n\n171\n00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,470\nAnd so we may need to get all the way\ndown into that with our scheduling data.\n\n172\n00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,127\nAnd then our organizational\nprocess assets,\n\n173\n00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,849\nthe paperwork and other resources\nthat our company has available,\n\n174\n00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:28,364\nall those different things that we need to\nadhere to, these are all of our inputs.\n\n175\n00:09:28,364 --> 00:09:32,110\nWe're just gathering that data\ntogether to begin working with it.\n\n176\n00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,700\nAnd the way we work with it,\nwell, we've actually talked about\n\n177\n00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,180\na lot of these already, performance\nreviews with the individual people.\n\n178\n00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,870\nWe assess the amount of work that they've\nbeen doing and their performance.\n\n179\n00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,960\nJust because two people each work 8 hours,\n\n180\n00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,140\ndoesn't mean you got 16\nhours worth of work.\n\n181\n00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,790\nIf one person is a expert in their field,\n\n182\n00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,930\nthey might have achieved twice as\nmuch work as the other person.\n\n183\n00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,900\nSo take something like Ronnie.\n\n184\n00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,347\nIn a past life, Ronnie,\nyou used to work on cars, right?\n\n185\n00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:06,552\n>> I did.\nAnd your car knowledge outstrips mine,\n\n186\n00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:07,759\nby far, right.\n\n187\n00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,692\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n188\n00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,745\nI know how to change the brakes on a car.\n\n189\n00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:11,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So do you.\n\n190\n00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,930\n>> I do.\n\n191\n00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,760\n>> You, it would probably take what, like\nan hour maybe to change brakes on a car?\n\n192\n00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,245\n>> Right.\n>> I know the last time I did it,\n\n193\n00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:20,055\nit took me darn near four hours.\n\n194\n00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:21,545\nAnd you know, I'm not good at it.\n\n195\n00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:22,695\nI had to figure it out.\n\n196\n00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,845\nWe both did the same activity, right?\n\n197\n00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:28,255\nBut it took me four hours\nwhere it took him one hour.\n\n198\n00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:32,078\nSo if we both worked one hour,\nhe's 100% done.\n\n199\n00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,280\nI'm only 25% done.\n\n200\n00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,500\nSo, time is not necessarily\nthe greatest reflection of somebody's\n\n201\n00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,820\nactual achievement.\n\n202\n00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,990\nAnd so in a performance review,\nthat's what we're trying to break down.\n\n203\n00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,680\nHow much work did they actually\nget done in that amount of time?\n\n204\n00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,990\nOur project management software, right?\n\n205\n00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,960\nTracking schedules, especially when you're\ngetting tons of progress reports or\n\n206\n00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,720\nwork statements from all sorts of\nemployees, can be really difficult\n\n207\n00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,650\nto correlate all that data and\nput it together and get a big picture.\n\n208\n00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,140\nAnd it's constantly changing, so you could\nbe mired in paperwork the rest of your\n\n209\n00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,050\nlife if you tried to do it by hand.\n\n210\n00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,860\nMost of us use software, right.\n\n211\n00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,820\nI'll bring up a Microsoft Project\nin the next episode and\n\n212\n00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,900\nkind of show where it can\nmake this stuff a lot easier.\n\n213\n00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,480\nYou start feeding in your data,\nyour status reports, and\n\n214\n00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,920\nit's letting you know what's behind or\nwhat's not coming up.\n\n215\n00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,910\nAnd it'll do really all\nthe formulas we talked about.\n\n216\n00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,360\nIt does all that stuff for us.\n\n217\n00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,440\nWe don't even have to\nthink about the formulas.\n\n218\n00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,318\nIt's really, really handy.\n\n219\n00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:33,375\nAll right then, if we have a problem,\nright, that's where we need to\n\n220\n00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:38,713\nstep in with things like our resource\noptimization techniques, right.\n\n221\n00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:42,217\nAnd we talk about those in another\nepisode, but just to kind of refresh,\n\n222\n00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:45,720\nwe have things like resource leveling and\nresource smoothing.\n\n223\n00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,350\nAnd that's where we take our resources,\nwhere I might have them scheduled to work\n\n224\n00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,330\neight hours today and\neight hours tomorrow.\n\n225\n00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,120\nBut in order to meet some other needs of\nmy project, I might smooth them out so\n\n226\n00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,710\nthey do instead of eight\nhours two days in a row,\n\n227\n00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,500\nthey do four hours four days in a row.\n\n228\n00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,560\nAnd that frees them up with an extra\nfour hours in those first two days to\n\n229\n00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,030\nhelp another activity get caught back up.\n\n230\n00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,130\nSo you can start to smooth and\nthen level your resources to make room or\n\n231\n00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,100\nfree up people to work on\nother activities, right.\n\n232\n00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,760\nThose are some examples of\nresource optimization techniques.\n\n233\n00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,929\nWe also have modeling techniques,\nthings like, shoot, what's\n\n234\n00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:29,830\na great example here,\nas far as how we lay out our resources.\n\n235\n00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,088\nActually, you know what I think I threw\nthese in the notes as I get my brain\n\n236\n00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:34,270\nfreeze here.\n\n237\n00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,573\nThere we go.\n\n238\n00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:38,900\nYeah, our what-if scenarios and\nsimulations.\n\n239\n00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,726\nSo when we are looking at our environment\nand looking at that upcoming schedule and\n\n240\n00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:43,612\nwe see a problem and\n\n241\n00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,507\nwe want to fix it, the solution\nmight not be there right away.\n\n242\n00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:48,481\nAnd so we experiment, we do modeling.\n\n243\n00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,536\nWe add in a few values,\nwe change things, and\n\n244\n00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,990\nwe see how it affects\nthe rest of the calendar.\n\n245\n00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,057\nIf you're doing that by hand,\nit's a huge exercise.\n\n246\n00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:59,279\nIt takes a lot of effort, but\nif you have project management software,\n\n247\n00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,110\nit just takes a matter of moments.\n\n248\n00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,810\nYou plug in some alternate values and\nsee what happens and\n\n249\n00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,090\nget an idea of what's gonna happen.\n\n250\n00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,304\nAll right, and then there's other\nthings that aren't here in the notes,\n\n251\n00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:11,407\nthings like schedule\ncrashing that we might do.\n\n252\n00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,439\nAnd maybe we get extra resources.\n\n253\n00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:14,780\nWe throw money at our problem,\n\n254\n00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,550\nI think is how I described\nit in the earlier episodes.\n\n255\n00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,685\nYou can do whatever it takes to get\nyour schedule back on line, but\n\n256\n00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:24,219\nthose are the tools that you have at\nyour disposal to try and correct that,\n\n257\n00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:24,792\nall right.\n\n258\n00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:28,615\nNow sometimes you might fall behind\nschedule, and it's not a big deal,\n\n259\n00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:31,686\nbecause you may have leads and\nlags, right, lead time and\n\n260\n00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:35,070\nlag times that are available\nthat compensate for that.\n\n261\n00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,257\nActivity C starts to get\na little bit behind, but\n\n262\n00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:41,380\nactivity D has a couple of\ndays of lag time on it.\n\n263\n00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,220\nSo that's okay.\n\n264\n00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,100\nIt can get pushed back a little bit,\nand it will be fine.\n\n265\n00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,170\nRemember how we calculated our float,\nour total float and our free float.\n\n266\n00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,000\nIf you don't remember those,\n\n267\n00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,230\njump back to the scheduling section\nof the planning process groups.\n\n268\n00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,870\nWe covered a lot of that there.\n\n269\n00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,590\nBut, in those theories,\nyou don't have to act, right.\n\n270\n00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,180\nBut if there is no float available, if\nyou're dealing with an activity that's on\n\n271\n00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,320\nyour critical path, it can't fall behind.\n\n272\n00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,700\nIf that critical path activity falls\nbehind, your whole project falls behind.\n\n273\n00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,880\nAnd that's where we need to jump\nover to our other techniques.\n\n274\n00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:19,360\nAll right, oh, I guess I gotta handle\nmyself with schedule compression, right?\n\n275\n00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,300\nSchedule compression, where we look for\nall the gaps in our schedule where we\n\n276\n00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,010\nmight be able to slide our\nactivities closer together.\n\n277\n00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,570\nOr you may have more than one activity\nthat can occur at the same time.\n\n278\n00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,500\nAnd again, we discuss those\nin the planning section too.\n\n279\n00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,520\nSo remember,\nthat's always available to you.\n\n280\n00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,910\nYou may purposefully not do schedule\ncompression during planning\n\n281\n00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,190\nto use that as a reserve.\n\n282\n00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,890\nNow, you wanna be up front about that\nwith the powers that be when you set\n\n283\n00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,526\nyour schedule.\n\n284\n00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:48,573\nBut when the time comes where\nyou're actually executing the work,\n\n285\n00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:53,030\nyou might find that you need to\ncompress in order to meet your goals.\n\n286\n00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,960\nAnd then the last one\nis a scheduling tool.\n\n287\n00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,147\nAgain, some people look at this and\nsay, well,\n\n288\n00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,449\nI've got project management software.\n\n289\n00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,435\nIsn't that a scheduling tool?\n\n290\n00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,085\nIt can be, but it isn't always, right?\n\n291\n00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:06,845\nMicrosoft Project is a great example.\n\n292\n00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:09,665\nIf you've got the desktop\nversion of Microsoft Project,\n\n293\n00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:12,220\nit is an amazing project\nmanagement program.\n\n294\n00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,800\nAnd as far as arranging your employees,\nas far as resources allows you to track if\n\n295\n00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,860\nthey've been over allocated and so\non, so it does a good job there.\n\n296\n00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,560\nBut what it doesn't do is it doesn't\ntrack anything outside of the project.\n\n297\n00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,670\nThings like sick time,\nright, and leave requests.\n\n298\n00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,830\nIt doesn't track activities that they're\nperforming with other projects, right?\n\n299\n00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,150\nYou're really tied inside\nof that single project.\n\n300\n00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,910\nSo with Microsoft Project, you really have\nto go up to Microsoft Project server to\n\n301\n00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,990\nreally get the full scheduling\nfunctionality out of it.\n\n302\n00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,230\nA lot of people, instead, will leverage\na separate scheduling software, and\n\n303\n00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,222\nwe do that here.\n\n304\n00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:47,040\nOur software, I can never remember\nthe name of it, Easy Clocking or\n\n305\n00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,030\nsomething like that.\n\n306\n00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,432\nSo yeah, we have a different scheduling\nsoftware that we use outside of\n\n307\n00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:52,574\nour project software.\n\n308\n00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:56,328\nAnd it's just because that other software\ndoes great with our payroll system and\n\n309\n00:15:56,328 --> 00:16:00,039\ntracking vacations hours and benefits and\nstuff that's specialized to that.\n\n310\n00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:04,024\nSo you may have a separate\nscheduling pool for that.\n\n311\n00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:06,806\nVery useful if you're trying to arrange\nyour resources to work in a certain time\n\n312\n00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:09,062\nperiod and make sure you don't\nconflict with their schedules.\n\n313\n00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:14,526\nAll right,\nnow as we work with our schedule,\n\n314\n00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,600\nif everything is running as planned.\n\n315\n00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,100\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n316\n00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,610\n>> If there's nothing wrong\n\n317\n00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,760\nthen our only outputs here are gonna be\nour work performance information, which,\n\n318\n00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,980\nI know I've said this over and over again.\n\n319\n00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,380\nIt's just the way we interpret\nthat work performance data.\n\n320\n00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,826\nOur schedule forecasts,\nwhich will be good.\n\n321\n00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:29,326\nRight?\n\n322\n00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,530\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> If everything's going great\n\n323\n00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,900\nour forecast will be fine.\n\n324\n00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,270\nAnd then that's really about it.\n\n325\n00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,980\nWe won't even really need to do any\nupdates other than updating our project\n\n326\n00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,720\ndocumentation to show that\nprogress has occurred.\n\n327\n00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,090\nBut if things are going bad.\n\n328\n00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,900\nRight?\nIf we're behind schedule or\n\n329\n00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,420\nahead of schedule or if we over budget or\n\n330\n00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,780\nunder budget, then we're gonna need\nto generate some other documents.\n\n331\n00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,070\nLike our forecasts.\n\n332\n00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,680\nAll right.\n\n333\n00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,240\nForecasts are where we try and\npredict the future.\n\n334\n00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,290\nWe say based on where we're at today,\n\n335\n00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,920\nif we continue on like this,\nhere's how we're gonna finish.\n\n336\n00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,670\nWe're gonna finish this much over budget,\nor this much behind scheduled, or\n\n337\n00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,730\nthis much over, whatever it is.\n\n338\n00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,065\nYou find out what that's gonna\nbe like if you stay the course.\n\n339\n00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:09,920\nRight?\n\n340\n00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,990\nAnd that's gonna give you an idea of\nwhether you need to correct or not.\n\n341\n00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,350\nIf you find that the deviation,\n\n342\n00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,830\nthat the variance from the plan is small\nenough to fit within your reserves.\n\n343\n00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,896\n>> Then you might not worry about it.\n\n344\n00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:21,405\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n345\n00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:22,480\nYou might just cruise along,\n\n346\n00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,930\nyou got reserves to cover it.\n\n347\n00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,830\nBut if you have no reserves, or\nif you've exceeded the reserves,\n\n348\n00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,550\nthen you're gonna have to take action,\nthe forecast, do that.\n\n349\n00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,350\nNow the way we do the forecast?\n\n350\n00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:32,930\nMath.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,720\n>> Lots and lots of math.\n\n352\n00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,035\nSo we're gonna see that in the next\nepisode generating those forecasts.\n\n353\n00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:39,010\nRight?\n\n354\n00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,520\nNow based on the forecast if\nwe do decide to take action,\n\n355\n00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,830\nif we do resource leveling or smoothing.\n\n356\n00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,020\nIf we do schedule crashing,\nschedule compression.\n\n357\n00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,760\nIf we do any of those various things,those\nare going to result in change requests.\n\n358\n00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,650\nRight?\nWe've got to change the activities inside\n\n359\n00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,450\nof our project to accommodate\nour new scenario and\n\n360\n00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,490\nthat in turn is gonna require\nchanging out baseline.\n\n361\n00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,150\nSo that's important.\n\n362\n00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,760\n>> And speaking of changing baseline.\n\n363\n00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,540\nRight?\nThere's a particular term that you'll\n\n364\n00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,228\nfind in the PMBOK every once in a while.\n\n365\n00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:07,730\nThey call re-baselining.\n\n366\n00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,928\nAnd that particular term there\nis usually our last effort.\n\n367\n00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:12,856\nRight?\nOnce we've done all of these different\n\n368\n00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:16,433\nthings, we've tried it and we've just\nrealized there's no way this is gonna come\n\n369\n00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:19,295\nunderneath anything that I've tried,\nwe may have to do that.\n\n370\n00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:20,895\nSo, do remember that term.\n\n371\n00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:22,615\n>> Yeah,\nan example of where you'd read baseline.\n\n372\n00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:27,060\nLet's say you had a deadline of December\n1st and you're behind schedule.\n\n373\n00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,755\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you do everything you can.\n\n374\n00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:31,245\nSchedule compression, crashing, you burn,\n>> Everything.\n\n375\n00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:31,984\n>> Your deserves.\n\n376\n00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:33,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> You do everything.\n\n377\n00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,219\nAnd you still cant' hit December 1st.\n\n378\n00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:35,740\nRight?\n\n379\n00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,780\nWell your project is slated to fail.\n\n380\n00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,020\nSo you go to the sponsor, and\nyou explain the situation to him.\n\n381\n00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,260\nYou say look,\nwe're not gonna be successful right now,\n\n382\n00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,310\nwe're not gonna be able to\nhit that December 1st date.\n\n383\n00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,080\nAnd the sponsor says, well what can we do?\n\n384\n00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,020\nAnd you say well,\nif we could have a little more time.\n\n385\n00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,470\nHow about December 15th instead?\n\n386\n00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,320\nIf we had December 15th,\n\n387\n00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,610\nwe had those two extra weeks,\nwe could finish and be successful.\n\n388\n00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,190\nAnd the sponsor says all right,\n\n389\n00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,510\nI'm okay with that, I'm okay with\nDecember 15th being our new start date.\n\n390\n00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,490\nWhen that happens you do a change ticket,\nchange your finish date to December 15th.\n\n391\n00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,970\nAnd then you re-balance your schedule.\n\n392\n00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,520\nRight?\nYou move things around to fit within that\n\n393\n00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,210\nwindow of time.\n\n394\n00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,300\nNow that change ticket becomes\npart of your new baseline.\n\n395\n00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,110\nYou're re-baselined, and\nsure there was that December 1 date,\n\n396\n00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,945\nyour original baseline, but\nthat's not what you're working on anymore.\n\n397\n00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,530\n>> Right.\n>> Now you're working on baseline 2.0.\n\n398\n00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or whatever you wanna call it, and\n\n399\n00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,100\nyour new finish date is December 15th,\nand now your project is back on for\n\n400\n00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,080\nsuccess again.\n\n401\n00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,150\nRight?\nIt's part of that change\n\n402\n00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,710\nmanagement procedure.\n\n403\n00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,805\nAnd that doesn't happen a lot.\n\n404\n00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:37,220\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Where the sponsor is like, yeah,\n\n405\n00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,270\nsure, fine, whatever.\n\n406\n00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:42,865\nIt is one of those things that creeps up,\nthough.\n\n407\n00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:43,535\nAll right.\n\n408\n00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:45,935\nOtherwise, we have our standard\noutputs that we expect to see.\n\n409\n00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,305\nYour project document updates,\n\n410\n00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:50,205\nproject management plan updates,\nand organizational process.\n\n411\n00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,465\n>> Right.\n>> Asset updates.\n\n412\n00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:52,235\nRight?\n\n413\n00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:53,562\nJust remember that.\n\n414\n00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:56,012\nwhile this process is pretty\nstraight forward and simple.\n\n415\n00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:57,822\nRight?\nWe watch what's being done,\n\n416\n00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,202\nwe gauge it against what's happening and\nwe report on it.\n\n417\n00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:05,002\nThere are some very specific operations\nthat we want to perform that center around\n\n418\n00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:06,812\nearned value management.\n\n419\n00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:10,053\nNow the reason we don't want to\ncover it right now is two fold.\n\n420\n00:20:10,053 --> 00:20:10,562\nRight?\nOne,\n\n421\n00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:13,792\nwe want to make sure we have\nthe basic concepts understood\n\n422\n00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:17,142\nwithout mixing in a bunch of\nmath that gets people confused.\n\n423\n00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:20,480\nAnd two earned value management, EVM.\n\n424\n00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,460\nIt really works by aggregating\nschedule and clocks together.\n\n425\n00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,810\nCombining the values.\n\n426\n00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,530\nSo you end up with this really\nneat kind of dashboard or\n\n427\n00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,660\nmeasurement utility that or\nwhat do they call them, KPIs?\n\n428\n00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,430\n>> Yeah.\n>> Key Performance Indicators?\n\n429\n00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,850\nYou end up with these really cool\nindicators that are a mixture of the two.\n\n430\n00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,590\nSo we want to talk about schedule and\ncosts and\n\n431\n00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,780\nthen once we've got those concepts down,\nthen we jump into the formulas.\n\n432\n00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,740\nAll right, but that's basically it for\ncontrolling the schedule.\n\n433\n00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,130\nSee what's going on, correct if you\nneed to, otherwise, let it ride.\n\n434\n00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,600\n>> Right.\n>> All right, Ronnie,\n\n435\n00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,510\ncan you think of anything else on\nschedule that I'm leaving out?\n\n436\n00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,660\n>> Nope.\nJust remember\n\n437\n00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,100\nthis particular process even though\nwe've gone through it a little bit more.\n\n438\n00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,100\nYou'll see in the section when we get into\nthe formulas, how we actually do this and\n\n439\n00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,640\nkeep on top of it by\nusing simple math here.\n\n440\n00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,380\nBut it does require some time, and you're\ngonna actually have to do it every day.\n\n441\n00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,050\nThere's no way that you can\nlet this thing pass, and\n\n442\n00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,960\ngo okay, I'll worry about it next week.\n\n443\n00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,110\nSo, yeah, diligence is pretty much the key\narea, especially on time management.\n\n444\n00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,181\n>> Yeah, and that every day part.\n\n445\n00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,717\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's really where you need\n\n446\n00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:24,845\nproject management software.\n\n447\n00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:25,660\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Because it's\n\n448\n00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,480\na challenge to do it every day\n>> All right, well let's do this.\n\n449\n00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,640\nLet's stop and take a break and\nwhen we get back we're gonna take a look\n\n450\n00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,870\nat the controlling costs process and\nhow that works.\n\n451\n00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,433\nAnd wind through that.\n\n452\n00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:40,016\n>> Yeah.\n\n453\n00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:44,560\n>> So stay tuned we'll be back after this.\n\n454\n00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,741\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n455\n00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,543\nSo now we're gonna take a look at Cost.\n\n456\n00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:56,348\n>> Right.\n>> Cost is a lot easier to maintain in\n\n457\n00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,620\na control than schedule.\n\n458\n00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,290\nWith schedule, you've got work and\nperformance you're trying to measure and\n\n459\n00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,430\nthe only real way to interpret\nwork is to ask people.\n\n460\n00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,251\nHey, how much of the work is done?\n\n461\n00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,340\n>> Right.\n>> What percentage are you complete?\n\n462\n00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,450\nAnd they say, well I'm 30% complete,\nor I'm 50% complete.\n\n463\n00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,860\nWell how are they measuring that?\n\n464\n00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,447\nA lot of times they're just\npulling it out of their head.\n\n465\n00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:19,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they might say I'm 80% complete,\n\n466\n00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,230\nbut in reality they've only\ndone half the work or whatever.\n\n467\n00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,080\nSo it's very subjective.\n\n468\n00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,715\nSchedule is a very subjective thing.\n\n469\n00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:28,050\n>> Right.\n>> But cost,\n\n470\n00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,136\nyou just look at the checkbook.\n\n471\n00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:30,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You go to the bank account and\n\n472\n00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,930\nyou say how much money have I spent?\n\n473\n00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,330\nSo it's one of the easier\nthings to monitor,\n\n474\n00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,510\ncuz we have hard numbers\nthat can't be denied.\n\n475\n00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,010\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n476\n00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,020\n>> You've got that information.\n\n477\n00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,750\nBut there are some challenges to cost.\n\n478\n00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,552\nWhen you talk about a job being done,\nas far as schedule.\n\n479\n00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:52,740\nWell, 0% is the job hasn't started,\na 100% is the job is done.\n\n480\n00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,743\nAnd when they're halfway through,\nyou're expecting to be 50% complete.\n\n481\n00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:58,641\nRight?\nSo it's a nice, even distribution, but\n\n482\n00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:01,289\ncost is not always an even distribution.\n\n483\n00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:02,100\n>> Yeah.\n\n484\n00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,390\n>> With cost,\n\n485\n00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:08,220\nyou might have an activity where you have\nto purchase some equipment on day one and\n\n486\n00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,670\nthen you've gotta pay labor for employees\nto work on it for day two and so on.\n\n487\n00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,430\nAnd when you track your costs\nthat way on a day by day basis,\n\n488\n00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,660\nyou end up with something like a weighted\nfront, end model, or a turtle,\n\n489\n00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,570\nor whatever,\nit's the various diagram names for that.\n\n490\n00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,520\nWhere you've got a huge spike in cost on\nday one and then it kind of plateaus out.\n\n491\n00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,610\nSo it's not an even distribution.\n\n492\n00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,470\nLet me go back to that variance\nchart that I drew earlier.\n\n493\n00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,260\nSo here I'm showing what\nwould be more like schedule.\n\n494\n00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,930\nRight?\nI expect work to get done every day\n\n495\n00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,980\nuntil 100% of it is done.\n\n496\n00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,430\nThat's what you expect with a schedule.\n\n497\n00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,130\nAnd if people get ahead of schedule\nit starts to jump up like this.\n\n498\n00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,230\nBut with a cost,\nthat initial plan maybe very different.\n\n499\n00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,790\nLet me do a whole new chart here.\n\n500\n00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,843\nAll right.\nSo with something like cost,\n\n501\n00:23:55,843 --> 00:23:58,802\nif I've got a huge upfront cost,\n\n502\n00:23:58,802 --> 00:24:03,886\nthen my variance may actually\nbe a little more like this.\n\n503\n00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:08,719\nWhere I'm seeing this big jump right\nhere at the beginning because we\n\n504\n00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:11,360\nhave to buy that equipment.\n\n505\n00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,500\nAnd then it levels out for\nthe remainder because at that point,\n\n506\n00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,770\nwe've already bought the equipment.\n\n507\n00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,720\nWe've got it.\n\n508\n00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,420\nIt's done and off we go.\n\n509\n00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:24,100\nSo when I start tracking that as far as\nthe performance of my individual work or\n\n510\n00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,660\nwhatever I should expect\nto see the same thing.\n\n511\n00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,680\nI should expect to see that giant\nupfront you know expense and\n\n512\n00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,830\nthen at the end I should expect to see it\nend up, you know something like the same.\n\n513\n00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,870\nBut if something happens.\n\n514\n00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,610\nMaybe we don't order the equipment right\nwhen we're supposed to and so that initial\n\n515\n00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,880\npurchase happens a few days later so\nI get that bump a little bit later.\n\n516\n00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,290\nThat should be okay, because I purchase\nthe equipment, the labor gets paid,\n\n517\n00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,950\nwe still finish on schedule.\n\n518\n00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,110\nSo, schedule might be fine even\nthough our budget's a little\n\n519\n00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,200\nwonky there in the beginning.\n\n520\n00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,290\nNow, I'll notice when I go and check\nthe bank accounts, and I see on day one or\n\n521\n00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,800\nday two,\nI I haven't spent the money, right?\n\n522\n00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,500\nThe money hasn't been spent,\nwhat's going on?\n\n523\n00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,480\nWe haven't ordered the equipment,\nit's a great indicator, right?\n\n524\n00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,220\nOr if we see that they got\nthe equipment on sale.\n\n525\n00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,350\nSo maybe it cost a little\nless than originally planned,\n\n526\n00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,680\nthen we might see a variance\nthat's something like\n\n527\n00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,420\nthis where you get a nice big jump,\nthat big difference here.\n\n528\n00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,820\nAnd that difference just carries through\nto the end of the project because\n\n529\n00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,120\nyou saved the money at the beginning.\n\n530\n00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,819\nSo the variance is gonna\nbe there all the way along.\n\n531\n00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,077\nWeek after week,\nyou'll see that same difference,\n\n532\n00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:32,791\nbecause you saved money back on day one.\n\n533\n00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,573\nAll right, there are some scenarios\nwhere the reverse is true,\n\n534\n00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:37,320\nwhere there's a lot of work up front.\n\n535\n00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,710\nAnd then you actually do\nequipment purchases at the end, so\n\n536\n00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,020\nyou see a sweeping model like that.\n\n537\n00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,130\nBut, just be aware,\ncost is not always evenly distributed.\n\n538\n00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,480\nAnd that can make it difficult to track.\n\n539\n00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,940\nSo don't assume that if an activity\nhas a cost of $80,000 and\n\n540\n00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,770\nit's an eight day activity,\ndon't assume it's gonna be $10,000 a day.\n\n541\n00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,290\nRight?\n\n542\n00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,979\nIf you do that, your variance is gonna\nbe huge all the way up until day eight,\n\n543\n00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:04,998\nwhen things level out if\nall the cost is up front.\n\n544\n00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:09,845\nSo, if I assume an even distribution\nin my plan, across eight days,\n\n545\n00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:12,280\nso here's my even distribution.\n\n546\n00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,849\nBut I buy the equipment on day one,\nwell now I've got this massive variance,\n\n547\n00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:21,715\nespecially like right in here, in the\nmiddle, I've got this massive variance.\n\n548\n00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:23,990\nAnd it slowly corrects itself.\n\n549\n00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,230\nBut if I'm just looking at the report,\nright here on day four,\n\n550\n00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,640\nI'm looking at that report and I'm saying,\nholy moly I'm over 50% over budget.\n\n551\n00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,166\nActually this is more like\nover 100% over budget.\n\n552\n00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm almost doubled what I had budgeted\n\n553\n00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,950\nto spend here.\n\n554\n00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,740\nSo we have to understand that.\n\n555\n00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,870\nIf your plan does not incorporate that\ninformation, you're gonna get bad numbers.\n\n556\n00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,425\nAnd cost will be near impossible to\nmeasure until you're actually done with\n\n557\n00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:50,530\nthe activity,\nwhich is too late to do anything about it.\n\n558\n00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,200\nRight?\n\n559\n00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,650\nBecause what if I see\nthat huge variance and\n\n560\n00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,798\nI say okay I've got a huge variance but\nyou know what?\n\n561\n00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,190\nI bet it's gonna arc back down and\nwe'll level out of the end and\n\n562\n00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,440\nfinish on schedule.\n\n563\n00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,010\nBut, it doesn't, right?\n\n564\n00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,740\nThen it just continues on,\ngrowing, growing, growing.\n\n565\n00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,230\nAnd sure it comes back a little bit, but\n\n566\n00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,350\nyou still end up with a pretty big\nvariance, now you're over budget.\n\n567\n00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,410\nThere's no way to track that.\n\n568\n00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,640\nSo your cost as far as tracking\nit is only gonna be as good\n\n569\n00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,720\nas the original plan you set\nunderneath it, your original baseline.\n\n570\n00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,460\nSo we make sure we set an accurate\nbaseline to what our expenses\n\n571\n00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,570\nare going to be.\n\n572\n00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,370\nAnd then we track on that, and\nnow when I start to see that variance,\n\n573\n00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,900\nthat deviation, I can see it and\n\n574\n00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,780\nI can spot it early on while I still\nhave time to do something about it.\n\n575\n00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,360\nActually, I really don't have\nenough room for errors there do I?\n\n576\n00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,440\nBut I still have time to\ndo something about it and\n\n577\n00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,620\nget it corrected and\nhopefully we can bring that back in line.\n\n578\n00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,205\nSo maybe we were paying\nunauthorized overtime, and\n\n579\n00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,669\nwe tell people, wait a minute,\nthat was not authorized overtime, so\n\n580\n00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,330\nyou've got to make that up to us.\n\n581\n00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,362\nThe contractor says okay, sorry about\nthat, we'll get it back in line and\n\n582\n00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:57,416\nwe'll cover the cost of some\nof the additional labor.\n\n583\n00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,910\nAnd so now,\ntowards the end of the project here,\n\n584\n00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:06,110\nsure we had that little boost right here\nwhere there was unauthorized overtime.\n\n585\n00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,380\nBut, wow, I'm just not able to\ngrab my little pointer there.\n\n586\n00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,500\nThere we go.\n\n587\n00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,000\nBut they compensated for\n\n588\n00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,480\nit out of their own pocket to bring\nit back in line towards the finish.\n\n589\n00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,870\nSo sure, we ended up with some\nvariance right there, but\n\n590\n00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,330\nat the end of the day\nit sorted itself out.\n\n591\n00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,950\nThat's what we hope to see, and\nwe get things kind of put back.\n\n592\n00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,900\nWhen it comes to cost,\nit's not necessarily as cut and\n\n593\n00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,460\ndry as looking at the bank account.\n\n594\n00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,700\nWe've got to make sure\nwe've got a good plan.\n\n595\n00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,760\nAll right.\n\n596\n00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,640\nSo, if I go back to\nthe control costs process,\n\n597\n00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,720\nwe're gonna see a lot of the same\nstuff that we saw with the schedule.\n\n598\n00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,380\nRight?\nBecause it's the same idea.\n\n599\n00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,800\nOur inputs, the project management plan.\n\n600\n00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,330\nRight?\n\n601\n00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,560\nThat's what's gonna be containing all\nthe activities that get performed and\n\n602\n00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,010\nthat information.\n\n603\n00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,970\nMy project funding requirements,\nthat's a fancy way of saying your budget.\n\n604\n00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,810\nYou've got a budget and\nthe budget itself may just be one number.\n\n605\n00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,750\nI have a project.\n\n606\n00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,430\nIt's a $5 million project.\n\n607\n00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,650\nThat's my budget.\n\n608\n00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:07,480\nBut the project funding requirements,\nthat's where we map out what days,\n\n609\n00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,300\nwhat weeks, what months we\nactually need that expense on.\n\n610\n00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,640\nWe talked about that back\nin the planning episodes.\n\n611\n00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,634\nYou want to know when those\nexpenses are going to be incurred,\n\n612\n00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:20,050\ncuz you might not need all $5 million\nof that $5 million project on day one.\n\n613\n00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:24,070\nSo don't set it aside if you\ndon't need it right away.\n\n614\n00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,830\nSo you can set it aside as time goes on.\n\n615\n00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,590\nThat allows companies to take on projects\nthey couldn't afford all at once.\n\n616\n00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,820\nSo we need to know what those\nrequirements are, what days,\n\n617\n00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,330\nwhat months we need\nthat money to be spent.\n\n618\n00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,570\nThat's gonna give us our accurate data.\n\n619\n00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,870\nThen we've got our work performance data.\n\n620\n00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,630\nIn scheduling, work performance\ndata was really percent complete,\n\n621\n00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,080\nhow much work they had done.\n\n622\n00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,765\nBut here, work performance data,\nis gonna be what's called our actual cost.\n\n623\n00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:49,915\nActual cost is how much money you spent.\n\n624\n00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:53,385\nSo I planned on spending\n$300,000 by month three.\n\n625\n00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:56,705\nHow much have I actually spent?\n\n626\n00:29:56,705 --> 00:29:57,775\nI've actually spent $300,000.\n\n627\n00:29:57,775 --> 00:29:59,425\nI'm on budget.\n\n628\n00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:02,249\nOr I've actually spent $250,000.\n\n629\n00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:03,705\nI'm below budget.\n\n630\n00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:04,285\nMaybe that's good.\n\n631\n00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:05,565\nMaybe that's bad.\n\n632\n00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:06,595\nOr I'm over budget.\n\n633\n00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:11,080\nWe find that our really easy based on\nour actual cost versus our planned cost,\n\n634\n00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,675\nwhat we expected to spend.\n\n635\n00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:14,626\nAnd then our organizational\nprocess assets.\n\n636\n00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:18,429\nIn this case it's gonna usually be our\nbookkeeping, whatever resources as far as\n\n637\n00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:22,250\naccountants, bank accounts and financial\nreporting information that we have.\n\n638\n00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,960\nOn our tools and techniques,\nIt's almost all math.\n\n639\n00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,750\nAnd like I said, we're gonna hold that for\nthe next episode.\n\n640\n00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,440\nBut earned value management\nis a big part of it.\n\n641\n00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,941\nLooking at what you spent so far versus\nwhat you should have spent so far and\n\n642\n00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:40,146\ndetermining whether you're over or\nunder budget.\n\n643\n00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:43,540\nAnd then trending that out to the future,\nthe forecasting piece,\n\n644\n00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,455\nto see what's gonna happen as you go on,\nright?\n\n645\n00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:51,195\nNow there is a series of numbers that we\ncan calculate here that show us this.\n\n646\n00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:55,145\nBut one of the cooler ones that\nthe PMI calls out pretty strongly\n\n647\n00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:59,070\nis the To-Complete Performance Index,\nall right?\n\n648\n00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,620\nAnd what, anytime you see to complete,\nwe're going to see a lot of calculations.\n\n649\n00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,620\nIt'll be budget at completion,\nthings like that.\n\n650\n00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,180\nAnd then there's going to\nbe budget to complete.\n\n651\n00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,130\nAnd that means how much more money\ndo we need to finish this project?\n\n652\n00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:16,210\nOr how much more time do we\nneed to finish this project?\n\n653\n00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,590\nSo it'll give you that idea of\nwhat's coming down the line.\n\n654\n00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,565\nSo when we talk about\nthe To Complete Performance Index that's\n\n655\n00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:25,665\na percentage number basically.\n\n656\n00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:27,534\nThat'll show how much more money or\n\n657\n00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:31,660\nhow much less money we'll need to finish\nthan what we'd originally planned.\n\n658\n00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,440\nAnd it's really just one piece\nof several other things.\n\n659\n00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,240\nWe have a cost performance index,\na CPI, that's where you are right now.\n\n660\n00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,730\nTo Complete is where\nyou'll be when you finish.\n\n661\n00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,960\nThat's seeing the future.\n\n662\n00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,660\nWe've got our performance reviews.\n\n663\n00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,810\nPerformance reviews in a matter of\ncost is really just bookkeeping.\n\n664\n00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,745\nChecking what was spent in the bank\naccounts versus what's been reported\n\n665\n00:31:55,745 --> 00:31:58,100\ninside of our project and\nwhat was planned.\n\n666\n00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,728\nAnd kind of correlating those numbers\ntogether and figuring out where we fall.\n\n667\n00:32:03,726 --> 00:32:04,874\nAnd then we've got our\nproject management software.\n\n668\n00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:08,885\nYou may have project management software\nthat does all of this stuff for you and\n\n669\n00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,810\ndoes a great job.\n\n670\n00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,585\nI'll tell you,\nI've never had that experience though.\n\n671\n00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:14,716\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Most project management software is not\n\n672\n00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:15,977\ngood financial software.\n\n673\n00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:19,523\nMicrosoft Project only recently,\nreally in Project 2010,\n\n674\n00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:23,197\ndid they even start addressing\nmonetary values in any real way, and\n\n675\n00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:26,042\nthey've gotten better in\nsome of the new versions.\n\n676\n00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:30,020\nBut at the end of the day,\nit's not accounting software.\n\n677\n00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,490\nSo it can do basic numbers and give us\na general idea for tracking purposes, but\n\n678\n00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,195\nit's not something you'd want to submit\nto the IRS for taxes, or whatever.\n\n679\n00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:40,625\nSo, you know,\nwe need to make sure we keep that in mind,\n\n680\n00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,285\nthat our project manager software\nmight not be the perfect solution.\n\n681\n00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:44,965\nAll right.\n\n682\n00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:48,895\nBut it does give you a good idea and, in\nfact, if you're using Microsoft Project,\n\n683\n00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:53,125\nif you feed it your financial data,\nit will calculate out things like TCPI for\n\n684\n00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,205\nyou so you don't even have to\nworry about the math behind it.\n\n685\n00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,060\nNow, one of the most\nimportant things we do when\n\n686\n00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,990\nwe're talking about controlling costs,\nis reserve analysis.\n\n687\n00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,190\nIf you set up a reserve in your planning\nphase, to say I've got this amount\n\n688\n00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:14,830\nof dollars set aside just in case we go\nover, or just in case certain risks occur.\n\n689\n00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:19,530\nWell, when you did that, the reserve,\nthose funds should be earmarked for\n\n690\n00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,000\nthose contingencies that you planned for,\nright?\n\n691\n00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,750\nSo no one should be drawing\nmoney from the reserve unless it\n\n692\n00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,240\nfulfills the requirements we specified\nwhen we set up that reserve, right?\n\n693\n00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,350\nSo if we're doing an outdoor rock concert,\nand there's a chance it might rain, I\n\n694\n00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:40,410\nmight have set aside $10,000 in reserve so\nthat if it rains, we can get those tents.\n\n695\n00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,040\nWell, as we come up on the festival,\nwe realize it's not gonna rain.\n\n696\n00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,850\nIt's the middle of a drought,\nit's not gonna happen,\n\n697\n00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,425\nwe don't need that ten grand.\n\n698\n00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:52,130\nThat doesn't mean we can go and\nuse that ten grand for something else.\n\n699\n00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,610\nIt means that the ten grand\nwas earmarked for tents.\n\n700\n00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,790\nWe didn't need the tenths.\n\n701\n00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,760\nWe gave the money back to the company.\n\n702\n00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,730\nIt wasn't used, all right.\n\n703\n00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,790\nIf you want to use it for something else,\nyou got to go change ticket.\n\n704\n00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,560\nA change ticket to say, we want to\nreallocate this reserve to another area\n\n705\n00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,120\nthat has fallen behind because it needs\nhelp or it could be better with some extra\n\n706\n00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,970\nmoney and if the sponsor is okay with\nthat, now you can reallocate the reserve.\n\n707\n00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,780\nBut it's not yours to\ndo with as you please.\n\n708\n00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,260\nIt needs to be earmarked.\n\n709\n00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,388\nIf you don't do that.\n\n710\n00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:23,590\nIf you don't do a reserve\nsystem that's tracked and\n\n711\n00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:28,086\ncontrolled then it leaves room for\nimpropriety right?\n\n712\n00:34:28,086 --> 00:34:28,724\nI mean you could be.\n\n713\n00:34:28,724 --> 00:34:29,540\nMoney's disappearing.\n\n714\n00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,440\n>> You're spending money on\nall sorts of crazy things.\n\n715\n00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,780\nAnd that's something you\nabsolutely want to avoid.\n\n716\n00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,496\nThere are a lot of people\nwho do that in real life.\n\n717\n00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:39,340\nThey actually set up a reserve with\nno earmarks on it and just say,\n\n718\n00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,100\nI'm gonna hold onto this money in case.\n\n719\n00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,080\nAnd that may be fine for their company.\n\n720\n00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,760\nOn the exam,\nit's gonna be the wrong answer though.\n\n721\n00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,460\nYou wanna make sure that's reserved.\n\n722\n00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,800\nAll right, so that's kind of some of\nthe things that are involved there.\n\n723\n00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,400\nReserve analysis, you may not even be the\none that does it, as the project manager.\n\n724\n00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,870\nIf you have an accounting team or\nan accounts payable department or\n\n725\n00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:03,520\nwhatever, that is controlling the funds,\nthen they may be the ones that do it.\n\n726\n00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,910\nAnd most of the environments that\nI've worked in, as a project manager,\n\n727\n00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,640\nI didn't have check writing authority for\nthe company.\n\n728\n00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,270\nSo I couldn't just cut\na check to somebody.\n\n729\n00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,490\nWhat I would have to do is any time\nI needed to pay out to a vendor,\n\n730\n00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,060\nto a contractor or whatever,\nI'd submit a form.\n\n731\n00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,970\nSubmit a form to the accounting department\nsaying, I'm Don Pezet, project manager for\n\n732\n00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,280\nthis project,\nWord package number blah, blah, blah,\n\n733\n00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,520\nbecause we use a work\nbreakdown structure number.\n\n734\n00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,340\nAnd we'd say that code of accounts,\n\n735\n00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,780\nthat activity,\nneeds to be paid out to this vendor.\n\n736\n00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,080\nThe work was complete.\n\n737\n00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,150\nThe accounting department would review\nit and then they would cut the check.\n\n738\n00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,845\nAnd if I was trying to approve funds for\nsomething that wasn't predetermined,\n\n739\n00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,438\nthen they'd reject it and\nrequire more information and\n\n740\n00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:45,547\nI would have to get the sponsor\ninvolved to be able to achieve that.\n\n741\n00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:48,050\nIt's a very common scenario.\n\n742\n00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,750\nIn a projectized organization though,\nyou as a project manager might have check\n\n743\n00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,750\nwriting authority and\nif that's the case, then it's\n\n744\n00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,260\nall on your shoulders to make sure that\nmoney's being properly portioned out.\n\n745\n00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,110\nAll right, that leads us to our outputs.\n\n746\n00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,700\nOn the output side,\njust like on the schedule side, right?\n\n747\n00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,080\nWork performance information.\n\n748\n00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,530\nThat's how we've interpreted\nour financial data.\n\n749\n00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,310\nAnd usually converted it into\nnumbers that make sense.\n\n750\n00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,420\nWhen we do all the formulas in the next\nepisode, you'll see there's a lot of\n\n751\n00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,220\nnumbers that'll make sense to us\ncause we just learned about them.\n\n752\n00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,890\nBut the average Joe, or\nyour CEO or whatever,\n\n753\n00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,280\nthey may not know what\nthose numbers mean so\n\n754\n00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,980\nwe need to translate them into a way\nthat is a little more understandable.\n\n755\n00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,520\nWe'll have our cost forecasts,\n\n756\n00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,620\nso what things are gonna look like\nin the future at our current rate.\n\n757\n00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,710\nWe'll have our change requests,\nif we need to take an action,\n\n758\n00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,000\nif we need to tap into a reserve or\nwhatever.\n\n759\n00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,130\nYou know, tapping into a reserve doesn't\nalways require a change request.\n\n760\n00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,720\nIf you've already earmarked it for that\ncontingency, and the contingency happens,\n\n761\n00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,960\nthat's part of the plan.\n\n762\n00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,480\nSo you don't need a change request.\n\n763\n00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,920\nIf you're reallocating those reserves,\nthen that's where you'd need a change.\n\n764\n00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,150\nProject Management Plan updates.\n\n765\n00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,810\nAgain, if you have changes that are gonna\nresult in a modification to the plan,\n\n766\n00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,990\nyou need to do that.\n\n767\n00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,650\nUsually though, what we're talking\nabout here are more things like\n\n768\n00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,540\nthe risk register, so\nif a risk happens or doesn't happen,\n\n769\n00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,450\nwe enter that in the risk register, which\nis part of our project management plan.\n\n770\n00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,830\nAny other project document\nupdates that we may need to,\n\n771\n00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:16,122\nany accounting work that we need to do and\norganizational process asset updates.\n\n772\n00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:18,924\nRemember that when we engage in\ncontracts and we pay out to vendors,\n\n773\n00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:21,790\nthat we generate a lot of documentation\nbased on their performance.\n\n774\n00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,608\nAnd we want to share that with other\nproject managers so they can see how it\n\n775\n00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:28,926\nhappened for us and they can\nrecreate that in their projects and\n\n776\n00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:31,776\nthat's part of our\norganizational process assets.\n\n777\n00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,300\n>> The overall goal for\n\n778\n00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,766\nus here on the controlling costs a lot\nof times is not really just goin,\n\n779\n00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:40,240\nI know things are actually on budget,\nwhich they're great when they are.\n\n780\n00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,240\nBut it's to actually build and\ncontrol any uncontrolled spending, right?\n\n781\n00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,890\nRight?\n\n782\n00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,160\nSo someone actually takes too\nmuch when they don't need to.\n\n783\n00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,910\nWe're not sure where the money's going.\n\n784\n00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,550\nThe whole goal of getting all of\nthe information that we need here,\n\n785\n00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,350\nis that idea.\n\n786\n00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,690\nSo that we know exactly where it's going.\n\n787\n00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,430\nBecause, we're reporting stakeholders.\n\n788\n00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,550\nAnd they need to know,\nand we need to know too.\n\n789\n00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:03,080\nSo really, that's the key behind\nall the numbers that we're facing.\n\n790\n00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,620\nYep.\n>> Yeah.\n\n791\n00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,540\nAll right, so that in a nutshell\nis controlling the cost.\n\n792\n00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,110\nThe processes themselves\nare not that hard, but\n\n793\n00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,030\nwe left out a pretty big chunk there,\ndidn't we.\n\n794\n00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,720\nItems one, two, and three.\n\n795\n00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,110\nThese are the math that we use.\n\n796\n00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,840\nAnd there are common sense metrics that\nyou can use for monitoring your project,\n\n797\n00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,120\nif you want to go that way.\n\n798\n00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,170\nBut remember, you are working to become\na project management professional\n\n799\n00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,240\nas certified by the PMI,\nthe Project Management Institute.\n\n800\n00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,390\nAnd the exam is based on the PMBOK,\nthe Project Management Body Of Knowledge.\n\n801\n00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,020\nYou'll see how many acronyms\nI can throw out here.\n\n802\n00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,120\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> So they have\na prescribed method for tracking this,\n\n803\n00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,140\na method that has been tested and proven\nacross companies all across the world.\n\n804\n00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,000\nAnd if you use those numbers, they're\nknown to be reliable, well-founded, and\n\n805\n00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,340\nscientifically proven numbers\nthat you can count on.\n\n806\n00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,400\nVersus numbers that could\npotentially be modified or\n\n807\n00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,440\nchanged to reflect a situation\ndifferently than it is.\n\n808\n00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,630\nSo we're gonna tackle that,\nbut it is a lot.\n\n809\n00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,910\nSo let's do this Ronnie, why don't\nwe go ahead and wrap this show here?\n\n810\n00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,160\n>> Okay.\n>> This will be one of our shorter shows.\n\n811\n00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,030\nAnd in the next episode,\nwe're gonna go formula crazy.\n\n812\n00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,410\nWe'll see how long it takes,\n\n813\n00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,740\ndepends on your questions we\nget in the chatroom and stuff.\n\n814\n00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,120\nThat maybe a longer episode or\nshorter one, we'll see.\n\n815\n00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,750\nBut I want to make sure that's separate,\nso people can focus in on it.\n\n816\n00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:23,840\nAll right, well, if you have any questions\non what we've talked about be sure to ask.\n\n817\n00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,570\nLive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n818\n00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,320\nyou'll see the chat box\nright beneath the video.\n\n819\n00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,160\nPost your questions there.\n\n820\n00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,690\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n821\n00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,090\nIf you have questions after the show,\nuse the Q & A forms.\n\n822\n00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,660\nAt the top of ever page is\na link that says Q & A.\n\n823\n00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,510\nJump on in there.\n\n824\n00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,030\nYou can post your questions,\nwe monitor and answer there too.\n\n825\n00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,740\nSo take advantage of that resource,\nit is there for you.\n\n826\n00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,990\nAll right, well,\nhope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n827\n00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,310\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n828\n00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,080\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n829\n00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,670\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n830\n00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,619\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

morning,\n\n5\n00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:36,610\ngood afternoon and good evening.\n\n6\n00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,820\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,690\nI'm you host Don Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,730\nBack again with Ronnie Wong [LAUGH]\nhow's it going Ronnie I can't even say\n\n9\n00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,510\nyour name.\n\n10\n00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,600\n>> It is going well but I am saddened.\n\n11\n00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,310\nI once again did not get\nchosen to be on the Bachelor.\n\n12\n00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,860\n>> No way.\n>> No.\n\n13\n00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,530\n>> How many times can you get passed up?\n\n14\n00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,680\n>> Apparently, a lot.\n\n15\n00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,225\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:56,955\nWow.\n\n17\n00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:59,795\nI'm sure you'd have the best of luck,\nif you were on that show.\n\n18\n00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:01,651\nYou've got the moral caliber for it.\n\n19\n00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,353\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:05,165\n>> We are gonna jump\n\n21\n00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,500\nback into the world of project management.\n\n22\n00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,010\nSpecifically, jumping into\nearned value management.\n\n23\n00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,260\nIf you watched our last episode,\nwe introduced you guys to the topics of\n\n24\n00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,320\ncost and schedule control,\nwhich are very important.\n\n25\n00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,130\nAs a project manager, we need to\nrecognize when our costs are high or\n\n26\n00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,360\nlow, when our schedule is fast or\nslow and make corrective actions.\n\n27\n00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,000\nThe corrective actions, there's only\na hand full we can even pick from, so\n\n28\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,110\nthat's pretty easy.\n\n29\n00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,740\nThe hard part is knowing when to\ntake the action and a lot of us can\n\n30\n00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,700\nget wrapped up in this world where we're\nlooking at individual activities and\n\n31\n00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,560\nlosing sight of the big picture.\n\n32\n00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,120\nSo, the PMI stresses\na set of tools basically,\n\n33\n00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,130\nor a methodology, that we can use to\ngauge the progress of our project.\n\n34\n00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,570\nAnd not just gauge what\nwe're at right now but\n\n35\n00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,970\ntrend it out into the future to get an\nidea of what's gonna happen down the road.\n\n36\n00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,410\nSo there's a series of formulas that\nwe can use to get these values.\n\n37\n00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,870\nThe nice part about this is if everybody\nmanages their project using the same earn\n\n38\n00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,850\nvalue formulas, then it becomes very\neasy to compare one project to another.\n\n39\n00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,750\nIt's apples to apples with these\nnumbers that are being generated,\n\n40\n00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,820\nversus if people are measuring\ntheir performance different ways.\n\n41\n00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,440\nThere are other ways to do it but\na standardized method is the best one.\n\n42\n00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,720\nSo the PMI, they have obviously shopped\naround a number of different methods and\n\n43\n00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,700\nthey selected this one as\nbeing the most flexible and\n\n44\n00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,040\nthe most generally applicable.\n\n45\n00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,440\nSo a lot of organizations can use this.\n\n46\n00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,050\nIt makes sense.\n\n47\n00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,370\nIt's very common even\nin non-PMI environments\n\n48\n00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,506\nto use earned value management.\n\n49\n00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:42,835\nNow, EVM is made up of a lot of formulas,\nand\n\n50\n00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:44,755\nthat's why we didn't want to jump\ninto it in the last episode,\n\n51\n00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:48,955\nwe wanted to dedicate this episode\njust to figuring all that out.\n\n52\n00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:51,967\nSo before we even get\nstarted on that though,\n\n53\n00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,927\nthere's a few pieces of\ninformation we need.\n\n54\n00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:57,027\nIf you're going to start dealing\nwith formulas you've got values,\n\n55\n00:02:57,027 --> 00:03:01,227\nyou've got a plugin, you need to know what\nthose values are and we also need to know\n\n56\n00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:04,973\nhow this is going to be presented to us\non the exam so we can be ready for that.\n\n57\n00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:08,868\nOftentimes, what your gonna see on\nthe exam is where they describe a project.\n\n58\n00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:13,098\nSo they tell you what the project is and\nthey tell you some of the information\n\n59\n00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:15,648\nabout it, like your expenses and\nyour schedule and stuff like that.\n\n60\n00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,630\nThey oftentimes give you a lot more\ninformation than you actually need, and\n\n61\n00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,900\nthen they ask you a question about it.\n\n62\n00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,590\nSo they say, In the above project,\ncalculate out this value, or\n\n63\n00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,720\nthat value, and you need to be able to\nlook at that word problem and figure out\n\n64\n00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,140\nwhat pieces of information you actually\nneed and which pieces you can ignore.\n\n65\n00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,760\nWhich pieces you need now versus which\npieces you might need later, and\n\n66\n00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,320\nyou've gotta work it out.\n\n67\n00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,770\nNow when you go to sit for\nthat exam, you get paper and pencil.\n\n68\n00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,370\nThe exam is on the computer but\nyou get a paper and pencil for\n\n69\n00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,330\nscratch pad to work with and\nyou need to do this by hand.\n\n70\n00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,210\nThey do not give you\nthe formulas on the exam and\n\n71\n00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,950\nyou can't take a formula\nsheet in with you either.\n\n72\n00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,820\nSo you need to make sure that you've\ngot these formulas memorized,\n\n73\n00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,300\nthat you can recall\nthem without effort and\n\n74\n00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,730\nthat you know when to apply\none formula versus another.\n\n75\n00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,960\nThat's pretty easy because it's\nbased on what we're trying to get.\n\n76\n00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,480\nThere's always one result that\ncomes out of these formulas.\n\n77\n00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,140\nSo, what are the pieces that\nmake up these formulas?\n\n78\n00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,050\nWe start off with something\ncalled Planned Value.\n\n79\n00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,300\nActually, even before we get to that,\n\n80\n00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,320\nlet me mention a few other\nvalues that we might see.\n\n81\n00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,890\nWe have a value called\nBudget at Completion, BAC.\n\n82\n00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,710\nBAC is a very important value,\n\n83\n00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,230\nit's a cornerstone that's used\nin almost all of our formulas.\n\n84\n00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,300\nThis is one of the easiest ones to grasp.\n\n85\n00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,750\nBudget at Completion is\nlike its name implies,\n\n86\n00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,030\nwhen the project is complete, what was our\nbudget, how much should we have spent?\n\n87\n00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,450\nSo in the planning phase\nwe came up with a budget.\n\n88\n00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,040\nWe came up with the total dollar amount\nfor what our project was gonna cost.\n\n89\n00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,770\nThat total dollar amount, that's your BAC.\n\n90\n00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,250\nSo when a formula calls for\nbudget at completion,\n\n91\n00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,680\nit's just saying, by the end of this\nproject, how much did you expect to spend?\n\n92\n00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,550\nIf you hit that number on the head you'd\nbe happy, that's the happy number,\n\n93\n00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,080\nthat's what they want, BAC.\n\n94\n00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,340\nThen we start modifying\nBAC with other things.\n\n95\n00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,020\nSo planned value, for example.\n\n96\n00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,600\nPlanned value is how much work should\nwe have achieved at this point?\n\n97\n00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,030\nBudget at completion,\nthat's at the end of the project.\n\n98\n00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,620\nWhat if we're halfway through a project?\n\n99\n00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,332\nWhat if I've got a two year project,\nand I'm at the end of year one?\n\n100\n00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:34,120\nIn a balanced project, you'd expect\nto be about 50% of the way through.\n\n101\n00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,590\nYou'd expect to have spent half of your\nbudget, halfway through the project.\n\n102\n00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,910\nSo your budget at completion will\nbe at 100% of your expenses but\n\n103\n00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,540\nyour planned work at that stage,\n\n104\n00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,510\nat the end of year one,\nit should be half of your expenses.\n\n105\n00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,200\nSo, you multiply your final\nbudget times what your budget\n\n106\n00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,800\nis that you've spent already, and that\nresults in what's called planned value,\n\n107\n00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,090\nthe amount of work that you've expected\nto have achieved by a certain point.\n\n108\n00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,190\nWhere this gets tricky is that we're\nnot just worried about budget,\n\n109\n00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,590\nwe're also worried about our schedule and\n\n110\n00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,320\nearned value management is all\nabout mixing those two together.\n\n111\n00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,370\nMixing schedule or\ntime information with budget or money,\n\n112\n00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,690\nmonetary information, and when you combine\nthe two you get these numbers that\n\n113\n00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,860\ndon't make a lot of sense but\nthey help to balance out the information.\n\n114\n00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,710\nNow we've got a ton of formulas\nthat we can run through but\n\n115\n00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,080\nif I just start describing them here and\nrattling them off, I find that that's\n\n116\n00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,960\nreally not a great way to learn and\nyou guys don't really get much from it.\n\n117\n00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,050\nYou end up watching the episode\nten times just to be able to grasp\n\n118\n00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,400\nsome of the formulas.\n\n119\n00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,210\nSo what I like to do instead\nis kind of do like the exam.\n\n120\n00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,670\nTake a project where they're\ngiving me some information and\n\n121\n00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,280\nthen we start to calculate\nsome things out of it.\n\n122\n00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,260\nI'll show the approach that I've used\nto be successful on these problems and\n\n123\n00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,670\nwe'll work through some examples and\nwe'll get a chance to see it.\n\n124\n00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,950\nNow we are gonna go through a lot\nof formulas in this show and\n\n125\n00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:15,140\nwhen I studied for the PMP, now I've been\nPMP Certified for seven or eight years.\n\n126\n00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,910\nWhen I got PMP Certified originally,\nI had to study these too, and\n\n127\n00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,490\na lot of these were formulas I wasn't used\nto using because I used Microsoft Project,\n\n128\n00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,900\nwhich can actually do all of these for us.\n\n129\n00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,630\nSo what I did is I created a cheat sheet,\na little study guide,\n\n130\n00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,550\na list of all the formulas I knew would be\non the exam, and that I needed to know for\n\n131\n00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,010\nthe exam, and I studied those.\n\n132\n00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,960\nThat was back under PMBOK third edition,\nand then the PMBOK fourth edition came\n\n133\n00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,195\nout I was already certified,\nso I didn't have to take it.\n\n134\n00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,665\nI was doing my continuing education but\n\n135\n00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,415\nI continued to update that\nspreadsheet because I found, for\n\n136\n00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:52,325\na lot of the people that I taught,\nthey really benefited from that.\n\n137\n00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,303\n>> Right.\n>> Now that the fifth edition is out,\n\n138\n00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:57,616\nI've continued to update that, and\nso I have my little cheat sheet and\n\n139\n00:07:57,616 --> 00:08:00,672\nI'm gonna post that on the ITProTV\nwebsite, so you can have it.\n\n140\n00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:01,833\nLet me just show it to you real quick.\n\n141\n00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:06,151\nIt's just a Word document but it could\nopen up an Open Office or Google Docs,\n\n142\n00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:10,080\nany of the different applications\nout there it can open it.\n\n143\n00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,730\nAnd what I did was I just\nlaid out all of the formulas\n\n144\n00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,510\nthat are really called out in the PMBOK.\n\n145\n00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,810\nNow just because it's in the PMBOK\ndoesn't mean you necessarily are going to\n\n146\n00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,460\nsee it in the exam.\n\n147\n00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,060\nSo you'll see where I put\nlittle stars on some.\n\n148\n00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,130\nThe ones with the star, it's not\na guarantee they'll be on the exam, right,\n\n149\n00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,990\nwe don't know what's going to be there,\nbut these are ones that are really likely.\n\n150\n00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,250\nSo, ideally,\nyou'll know all of these formulas, but\n\n151\n00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,660\nthe ones with the star,\nyou need to know those by heart.\n\n152\n00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,580\nYou need to be able to implement\nthose without thinking about it.\n\n153\n00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,670\nAnd so I lay out all the formulas\nright here in what for\n\n154\n00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,620\nme was a memorization sheet.\n\n155\n00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,770\nI stared at this, memorized it,\nevery single one that was on here, so\n\n156\n00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,180\nthat I would know what formulas to\nuse when and be able to tackle that.\n\n157\n00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,420\nSo I'll post these along with the episode.\n\n158\n00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,916\nI say I'll post it,\nI'll make Nate post it.\n\n159\n00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,749\n[LAUGH] But anyhow,\nit'll get up there with the episode.\n\n160\n00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,610\nSo, we're going to be going through that,\nand we want to make sure we get a good\n\n161\n00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,890\ngrasp of a lot of this stuff so\nwe understand it.\n\n162\n00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,140\nSo, let's start really simple.\n\n163\n00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,650\nI'm going to bring up a sample project,\nhere.\n\n164\n00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,300\nHere's a project that I'm working on.\n\n165\n00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,250\nA fictitious project.\n\n166\n00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,960\nSo when we get to a test question\nwe expect them to describe it,\n\n167\n00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,920\nand I've kind of written it out\nin separate sentences here.\n\n168\n00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,060\nTheirs might be a little more descriptive,\nyou know?\n\n169\n00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,020\nThey might give you more background\ninformation that's not really numeric.\n\n170\n00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,601\nBut basically in this project we've\ngot a project budget of $1 million.\n\n171\n00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,500\nAll right?\n\n172\n00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,310\nOur project duration is 12 months.\n\n173\n00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,060\nSo we've got a one year project\nwith a $1 million budget.\n\n174\n00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,600\nWe have 20 employees\nassigned to the project.\n\n175\n00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,310\nAnd between the 20 employees,\n\n176\n00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,950\njust over 40,000 hours of labor assigned\nthroughout the project, all right?\n\n177\n00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,591\nThe costs of the project\nare evenly distributed.\n\n178\n00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:50,255\nWe don't have equipment to purchase,\nso it's basically just labor.\n\n179\n00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,806\nAnd as a result, our expenses should be\nroughly equal from month to month to month\n\n180\n00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,460\nthroughout the 12 months of the project.\n\n181\n00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,310\nAnd then the work is very similar.\n\n182\n00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,070\nThe work is evenly distributed.\n\n183\n00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,900\nIt's not like I have all 20 employees\nworking overtime the first half and\n\n184\n00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,480\nthen not doing anything the second half.\n\n185\n00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,050\nIt's all work spread out nice and\nevenly across.\n\n186\n00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,070\nThat's important, because remember\nif we have an uneven distribution,\n\n187\n00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,860\nif we have heavy expenses at\nthe beginning of the project,\n\n188\n00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,230\nwe need to expect outliers, right?\n\n189\n00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,010\nWe need to correct our baseline\nto be able to reflect that so\n\n190\n00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,890\nwe're measuring the proper data.\n\n191\n00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,410\nAll right.\n\n192\n00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,740\nBut for the sake of this example,\n\n193\n00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,620\nto keep it easy, this will be\nan evenly distributed project, right,.\n\n194\n00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,890\nAnd that's what you are likely\nto see on the exam.\n\n195\n00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,460\nAlright, so looking at this,\nwhat information do I get?\n\n196\n00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,490\nWell, there's some good stuff here, right?\n\n197\n00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,010\nI needed to know that the cost and\nthe work were evenly distributed, and\n\n198\n00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,340\nthat way I can kind of make\nbasic generalizations.\n\n199\n00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,200\nI've got a 12-month project.\n\n200\n00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,710\nAnd so\neach month I should be achieving, what,\n\n201\n00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,263\nlike 8.5% of my project or something.\n\n202\n00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:50,280\nI could do the actual\nmath to total that up.\n\n203\n00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,930\nBut about 8.5% of my project\nshould be getting done each month,\n\n204\n00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,080\nto result in 100% of it being\ndone at the end of December.\n\n205\n00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080\nMakes life kind of easy.\n\n206\n00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,199\nIf I have a $1 million budget, then I\nexpect to be spending around $850,000 per,\n\n207\n00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:07,020\nno $85,000 per month over\nthe course of the year.\n\n208\n00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,250\nAnd you know, that would be it.\n\n209\n00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,220\nSo I can kinda start to see how\nmy expenses should be laid out.\n\n210\n00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,857\nAll right.\n\n211\n00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:17,531\nIf it was an uneven distribution, then\nthere would normally be a chart following\n\n212\n00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:19,811\nit showing what the distribution was.\n\n213\n00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:24,629\nSo for example, if we say a $1 million\nproject over 12 months, even distribution.\n\n214\n00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:29,067\nThen I can just take $1 million and\ndivide it by 12, and\n\n215\n00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:33,520\nthat's gonna give me what my\nmonthly expenses should be.\n\n216\n00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,919\nAnd I've got a calculator\naround here somewhere.\n\n217\n00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,780\nAll right, so I'll take $1 million and\nI'll divide that by 12 months.\n\n218\n00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,620\nSo I am looking to spend\nabout $83,333 per month.\n\n219\n00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,865\nAll right.\n\n220\n00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:52,295\nSo now, as I start to look at my budget,\nif I see a month where I've\n\n221\n00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,765\nspent more than $83,000 I\nknow that I'm probably over.\n\n222\n00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:56,295\nRight?\n\n223\n00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,875\nVersus if there's a month\nwhere I've spent less,\n\n224\n00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,635\nthan I know probably some\nwork didn't get done.\n\n225\n00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:03,945\nBut if it was an uneven distribution,\nit would have to go on\n\n226\n00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:08,045\nto list that information so\nwe could use it in our calculation.\n\n227\n00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:11,880\nSo you would see something like\nyou know January, February,\n\n228\n00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,380\nMarch, April, and so on and\nthe expenses for each.\n\n229\n00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,903\nAnd so\nwe might have $100,000 in January, but\n\n230\n00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:29,010\nonly $20,000 in February and maybe back\nto $100,000 the next month and so on.\n\n231\n00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,980\nAnd we'd need to know each month so\n\n232\n00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,760\nthat if we were tracking progress in\nFebruary, that we use those numbers.\n\n233\n00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,390\nOr if we were tracking progress in March,\n\n234\n00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,820\nwe use those numbers to make sure that\nwe knew where we were supposed to be.\n\n235\n00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,770\nBut since we've got an even distribution\nwe don't have to worry about any of that.\n\n236\n00:12:45,072 --> 00:12:49,640\nAll right, now as far as my formulas are\nconcerned, there's really only one value\n\n237\n00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,090\nthat's listed here that I can pull\nright out of the description.\n\n238\n00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,020\nAnd that is my project budget.\n\n239\n00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,330\nThat's gonna be the budget\nat completion or BAC.\n\n240\n00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,910\nMy BAC in this project is $1 million.\n\n241\n00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,210\nWhen the project is said and\ndone I expect to have spent $1 million.\n\n242\n00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,930\nIf I spent more than $1 million\nmy project was over budget.\n\n243\n00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,210\nIf I spend less then I'm under budget.\n\n244\n00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,930\nPretty straightforward there.\n\n245\n00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,710\nSo that's my BAC.\n\n246\n00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,260\nOn the exam sometimes\nthey're really nice to you.\n\n247\n00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,070\nAnd they start giving you all sorts\nof values out of your formulas.\n\n248\n00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,690\nYou don't have to figure it out, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,720\nBut I'm gonna be mean.\n\n250\n00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,430\nI'm only gonna give us one value, the BAC.\n\n251\n00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,000\nOkay, so that's all I know.\n\n252\n00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,370\nEverything else we're gonna have to figure\nout as we go through on the project.\n\n253\n00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,150\nNow, I do want to add one more thing here.\n\n254\n00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,490\nSo we'll say, no, I'll hold off on that.\n\n255\n00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,930\nSorry, I was about to throw\nsomething else out there.\n\n256\n00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,211\nWe'll go with that budget completion,\nthat's really all that I know.\n\n257\n00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:48,850\nSo, if we go back and\nwe look at things like my formulas.\n\n258\n00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,490\nPlanned value is one of the first\nthings that I calculate.\n\n259\n00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,540\nWhat was my planned value for\nthis stage in the project?\n\n260\n00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,170\nWell, I don't know what\nstage of the project I'm in!\n\n261\n00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,770\nI just have totals.\n\n262\n00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,840\nIn total numbers there's no formulas.\n\n263\n00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,690\nWhen you have totals, when you have\nthe plan, you have planned values.\n\n264\n00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,770\nYou have where you plan\nto spend $1 million.\n\n265\n00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,870\nThat's it.\nThat is your PV.\n\n266\n00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,840\nThere is no formula you need.\n\n267\n00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,145\nIt equals the BAC.\n\n268\n00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,825\nBefore the project starts.\n\n269\n00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:18,575\nBut once the project actually\nkicks into execution, right,\n\n270\n00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:22,725\nwhen work is actually getting done,\nnow we need our status reports, right.\n\n271\n00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:24,645\nStatus reports telling me\nwhere we're at right now, and\n\n272\n00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:26,955\nthat's where we can start\nto get even more data.\n\n273\n00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:29,775\nSo let's say we've got a status report,\nso I'll add one in here,\n\n274\n00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:31,679\nI'm going to say my current status.\n\n275\n00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,200\nAll right, and we'll just lay out\nwhat's coming in on my status report.\n\n276\n00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,650\nSo, my status report comes in.\n\n277\n00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,090\nWe are currently in, I guess I\ndon't want to be too redundant, so,\n\n278\n00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,150\nI'll say that we are three months in.\n\n279\n00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:51,292\nAll right, so, we're 3 months into a 12\nmonth project, at this point, all right?\n\n280\n00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:58,320\n28% of the work that was\nassigned is completed, all right?\n\n281\n00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,280\nSo 28% of the work is completed.\n\n282\n00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,123\nThen how much money have I spent?\n\n283\n00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:08,504\nWe've spent $380,000.\n\n284\n00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:09,290\nOkay.\n\n285\n00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,070\nNow if I just look at this\ninformation right here,\n\n286\n00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,640\nwe can probably do some things\ncommon sense in our head, can't we?\n\n287\n00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,520\nI'm 3 months in on a 12 month project.\n\n288\n00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,550\nThat's a quarter of the way right?\n\n289\n00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,980\nSo, I'm 25% of the way\nthrough the project and\n\n290\n00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,740\nif it's an even distribution then we\nshould be 25% done with our work.\n\n291\n00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,450\nI'm 28% done with my work.\n\n292\n00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,960\nSo, it looks like I'm ahead right?\n\n293\n00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,590\nI've got a $1 million project.\n\n294\n00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,490\nIf I'm three months in I expect\nto have spent 25% of that.\n\n295\n00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,260\nSo, I should've spent around\n$250,000.00 I spent $380,000.\n\n296\n00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,840\nSo it looks like I'm over budget.\n\n297\n00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,380\nNow, did any of that require crazy\nformulas or anything super complex?\n\n298\n00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,690\nNo, it's mostly common sense.\n\n299\n00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,760\nBut there are formulas that drive this.\n\n300\n00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,699\nWe can actually run a few simple\nformulas to create values and\n\n301\n00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,088\nget very specific results.\n\n302\n00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:05,130\nThat whole time I was doing it in my hand,\nI was saying, we should have this.\n\n303\n00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,007\nThings are likely this And the reason is,\n\n304\n00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,125\nI picked numbers here that work\nout mathematically well, you know.\n\n305\n00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,870\nIt makes it where I can do\nsimple math in my head.\n\n306\n00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,410\nBut you'll find, oftentimes, in real life\nyou're dealing with decimal points, and\n\n307\n00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,850\ncrazy fractions, and\nthings where it doesn't work out so well.\n\n308\n00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,100\nAnd that's where we we need\nto crack into our formulas.\n\n309\n00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,230\nSo let's take a look at some of\nthe things like our planned value.\n\n310\n00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,300\nThat's usually one of the first\nthings that we calculate is,\n\n311\n00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,080\nI'm three months into the project.\n\n312\n00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,370\nWhat was my planned value for\nthree months.\n\n313\n00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,950\nWhere should I be.\n\n314\n00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,400\nAnd then we can start comparing that\nto other things and calculate our\n\n315\n00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,290\nearned value, what value we actually\nachieved with our project so far, right.\n\n316\n00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,120\nYour planned value and\n\n317\n00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,550\nyour earned value are two very\nimportant portions of all of this.\n\n318\n00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:56,870\nSo my planned value, what we do is we say\nwe take our planned percent complete.\n\n319\n00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,420\nRight?\n\n320\n00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,600\nWhat I had planned to get done.\n\n321\n00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,430\nAnd then we're gonna be comparing\nthat to our percent complete,\n\n322\n00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,220\nwhich is what we've actually gotten done.\n\n323\n00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,660\nRight?\nThose are our two very important numbers.\n\n324\n00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,830\nSo on my planned complete side,\nwhat have I planned to get done?\n\n325\n00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,520\nWell, I know that I'm three months\ninto a twelve month project.\n\n326\n00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,350\nSo if I take three and divide it by\ntwelve, that's gonna result in 0.25,\n\n327\n00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,180\nwhich is basically 25%.\n\n328\n00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,040\nSo I expect to be 25% of the way through.\n\n329\n00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,290\nNow, I did that in my head a minute ago.\n\n330\n00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,120\nDo we need a formula for that?\n\n331\n00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,770\nNot really, right?\n\n332\n00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,860\nBut there is one.\n\n333\n00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,740\nYou're taking your current time period,\nand\n\n334\n00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,640\ndividing it by the maximum time period,\nthe full time period of the project,\n\n335\n00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,840\nto come up with where you\nshould be in terms of schedule.\n\n336\n00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,630\nIt's a pretty simple common\nsense formula there to get\n\n337\n00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,230\nthat planned percentage complete.\n\n338\n00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,826\nNow the actual percentage complete,\nwe don't even have a formula for\n\n339\n00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:56,816\nthat because that's being\nreported by our workers.\n\n340\n00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:59,250\nThey tell us.\n\n341\n00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,670\nSeveral of my activities are 100% done.\n\n342\n00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,100\nThere's a few that are partially done and\n\n343\n00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,070\nif I tally all those up,\nmy total project is 28% complete.\n\n344\n00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,030\nNo formula needed there.\n\n345\n00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,990\nAnother thing that I need to know is\nwhat's called my actual cost, my AC.\n\n346\n00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,980\nActual cost, looking at my status report\nup here, and you'll see each of these\n\n347\n00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,230\nnumbers are really just coming\nright here from the status report,\n\n348\n00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:28,630\nmy actual cost is how much I've spent\nto date and it's right here, 380,000.\n\n349\n00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,700\nAgain no formula needed for this.\n\n350\n00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,045\nThis stuff is just coming\nright from my reports.\n\n351\n00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n352\n00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,760\n>> All right.\n\n353\n00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,466\nSo these values that\nI'm talking about here.\n\n354\n00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:41,864\nBAC budget at completion, AC actual cost,\nplanned percent complete,\n\n355\n00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:45,260\npercent complete,\nthese are building blocks.\n\n356\n00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,920\nWe are going to use these in other\nformulas later, but, when we look at\n\n357\n00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,730\na word problem like this, we need to\nbe able to extract these values out.\n\n358\n00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,800\nTo know what to use in the formula.\n\n359\n00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,030\nIf you go and take the exam and\nyou've never seen these formulas before,\n\n360\n00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,900\nyou just won't be able\nto answer the question.\n\n361\n00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,370\nRight?\nYou should definitely guess,\n\n362\n00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,750\nbecause leaving an answer blank versus\ngetting it wrong counts the same.\n\n363\n00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,460\nSo you should always guess.\n\n364\n00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,900\nBut for somebody who doesn't know\nthe formulas, this is just a mess.\n\n365\n00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,530\nRight?\n\n366\n00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,210\nSo, we need to be able to\nlook at these data, right?\n\n367\n00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,090\nThe description of the project, And\nthe status report of the project, and\n\n368\n00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,250\nstart to extract this.\n\n369\n00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,060\nSo I've actually got four values now.\n\n370\n00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,250\nI've got my budget at completion, my plan\npercent complete, my percent complete, and\n\n371\n00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,630\nmy actual cost or my AC.\n\n372\n00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,809\nThose are the four values\nthat I'm sitting with.\n\n373\n00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,110\nNow the test question will\ncontinue on to say something like,\n\n374\n00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,440\ncalculate the cost performance index.\n\n375\n00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,750\nOr calculate the budget to complete.\n\n376\n00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,630\nOr estimate to completing or whatever.\n\n377\n00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,390\nI know, ask you to calculate\nsome other kind of value.\n\n378\n00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,650\nAnd so that's what I wanna talk about\nthis whole rest of the episode,\n\n379\n00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,440\nare all the things we can calculate and\nwhat they mean.\n\n380\n00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,830\nWhat they mean for our project.\n\n381\n00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,710\nHow we can interpret them and use them.\n\n382\n00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,700\nThey're all useful to a project manager,\nbut some of them are presented in a way\n\n383\n00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,300\nthat doesn't make a lot of\nsense to non-project managers.\n\n384\n00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,220\nSo we'll have to take them and\n\n385\n00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,709\nmanipulate them a little more to turn them\ninto values that people will recognize.\n\n386\n00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,900\nCPI, Cost Performance Index\nis a great one.\n\n387\n00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,080\nAnd if you give someone the CPI a lot of\ntimes they have no idea what it means.\n\n388\n00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,790\nBut you convert that into a simple\npercentage or something and\n\n389\n00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,070\nthey really know.\n\n390\n00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,500\nYour CPI is 0.75.\n\n391\n00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,400\nAll right.\n\n392\n00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,710\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n393\n00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,220\nBut if you tell them oh,\nyou know what, we are 25% over budget.\n\n394\n00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,680\nThey know what that means.\n\n395\n00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,180\nSo those are things that we can quantify,\n\n396\n00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,500\nwe can turn into values, we're not\n25% over budget, we are 1 million,\n\n397\n00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,830\nor our current budget is 1,250,000,\nso we're 250,000 over budget, right?\n\n398\n00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,560\nThat's stuff that people understand.\n\n399\n00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,980\nSo we may have to manipulate a little bit\n\n400\n00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,010\nfurther before we turn\nit over to the others.\n\n401\n00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,360\nThe others, that's what I'm gonna\ncall them now is just the other.\n\n402\n00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,870\nSo I specifically called out planned\nvalue earlier and earned value.\n\n403\n00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,760\nPlanned value is what you should've\nachieved by this point and\n\n404\n00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,840\nearned value is what you have achieve,\nwhat you've earned by working the project.\n\n405\n00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,090\nSo those are two of the next things\nthat we want to calculate and\n\n406\n00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,070\nI usually calculate them at the same time.\n\n407\n00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,940\nPlan value versus earned value.\n\n408\n00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,130\nIf you are a super energetic project\nmanger, back when you do the plan\n\n409\n00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,400\nin the planning stage if you say you're\ngonna be doing reports every two week so\n\n410\n00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,320\nevery two weeks you're gonna do reporting.\n\n411\n00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,440\nWhat you might do is way back in\nthe planning phase, you might go ahead and\n\n412\n00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,650\ncalculate your plan values for every two\nweeks throughout the life of that project.\n\n413\n00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,010\nCuz this is what you plan for.\n\n414\n00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,930\nThe only negative of doing this\ncalculation early is that if\n\n415\n00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,120\nchange tickets occur, it changes the plan,\nyou just lost all these numbers.\n\n416\n00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,890\nThat you calculated.\n\n417\n00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,130\nThey have to be redone.\n\n418\n00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,740\nSo a lot of people\ncalculate them on the fly.\n\n419\n00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,130\nOr we use project software.\n\n420\n00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,560\nMicrosoft project will calculate\nout your plan value for you.\n\n421\n00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,370\nYou don't have to worry about\nit when it would get changed,\n\n422\n00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,940\nit just automatically does the recalcs.\n\n423\n00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,260\nThat really helps.\n\n424\n00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,630\nOn the exam, not so much.\n\n425\n00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,250\nAll right, so, Planned Value.\n\n426\n00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,720\nPlanned Value's got that simple\nformula which is right here.\n\n427\n00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,760\nOur budget at completion\ntimes our planned work.\n\n428\n00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,060\nAnd if we look at what I've got,\n\n429\n00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,310\nI've got my planned percent complete and\nI've got my budget at completion,\n\n430\n00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,880\nyou know I've got these values\nalready right from the word problem.\n\n431\n00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,420\nI just needed to pull them out and\nthen throw them into the formula so\n\n432\n00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,250\nthe planned value in my case,\nthat's BAC times planned work\n\n433\n00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,530\nand if we write that out\nit's going to be $1,000,000.\n\n434\n00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,840\nRight, that's my budget at completion.\n\n435\n00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,410\nAnd I'm gonna multiply\nthat by my planned work.\n\n436\n00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,210\nNow my planned work is this guy\nright here, Planned Complete.\n\n437\n00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,140\nThe amount of work that I had\nplanned to get done by this point.\n\n438\n00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,802\nAnd it's 25%, so\nI'm gonna be multiplying this by .25.\n\n439\n00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:48,458\nOkay.\n\n440\n00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:55,836\nSo $1,000,000 times .25 gives us 250,000.\n\n441\n00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:56,492\nOkay.\n\n442\n00:22:56,492 --> 00:23:00,070\nNow, again, I did that in my head at\nthe beginning of the segment, but\n\n443\n00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,650\nyou can see where I did it in my\nhead because it was easy math.\n\n444\n00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,430\nIf it was hard math,\nI might not have been able to do that.\n\n445\n00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,350\nThis is the formula we\nused to create that.\n\n446\n00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,650\nSo, my planned value, three months in,\nis 250,000, but what's my earned value?\n\n447\n00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,210\nAnd here's where things\nare going to start to get weird.\n\n448\n00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,490\nYou might look at it and say,\nwell my earned value is $380,000,\n\n449\n00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,610\nbut that's not really true\nbecause this planned value,\n\n450\n00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,530\nnotice how it's not really taking into\naccount how much money we've spent.\n\n451\n00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,330\nIt's taking in the full\ncost of the project.\n\n452\n00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,260\nWhat it really cares about\nis this guy right here,\n\n453\n00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,280\nthe percentage of the work complete.\n\n454\n00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,400\nSo earned value is actually\ncalculated off of this,\n\n455\n00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,200\nthe actual work that's been completed.\n\n456\n00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,180\nAnd if we take a look at my earned\nvalue slide, we'll see that.\n\n457\n00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,120\nEarned value equals my planned\nvalue times my percent complete,\n\n458\n00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,630\nthe actual percent complete, right.\n\n459\n00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,040\nNow let me point out something\nover here on the left side.\n\n460\n00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,067\nOn the slide and\nI did this on my formula cheat sheet too.\n\n461\n00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,994\nI put what the components\nare of the formula.\n\n462\n00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:00,640\nSo this formula's made up of three pieces.\n\n463\n00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,522\nEarned Value.\n\n464\n00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:02,242\nPlanned Value.\n\n465\n00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,311\nPercent complete.\n\n466\n00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:06,144\nSo that's what I've got over here, earned\nvalue, planned value, percent complete.\n\n467\n00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,480\nI just wrote up full names so\nyou'd know what they were.\n\n468\n00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,970\nBut notice on earned value and\n\n469\n00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,070\nplanned value I have two other\nthings underneath it, right?\n\n470\n00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,548\nEarned value or\nbudgeted cost of work performed.\n\n471\n00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:17,198\nOkay?\n\n472\n00:24:17,198 --> 00:24:23,370\nIn PMBOK versions one through three,\nthat's what it was called.\n\n473\n00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,160\nIn PMBOK version four,\nthey had both names and\n\n474\n00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,480\nnow in PMBOK version five,\nyou just have the new name, all right?\n\n475\n00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,840\nOn the exam,\nyou will only see the new name.\n\n476\n00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,140\nYou'll just see earned value, all right?\n\n477\n00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,680\nBut if you go out on the Internet or if\nyou've used project managing software like\n\n478\n00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,510\nMicrosoft Project or\nother things like that.\n\n479\n00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,860\nA lot of them, I mean a huge portion\nof them still use the old terms.\n\n480\n00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,747\nSo I went ahead and\nincluded the old names so\n\n481\n00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:49,644\nyou could recognize them if you spot that.\n\n482\n00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:51,833\nIf you're out there on the Internet and\nyou find some kind of study source.\n\n483\n00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,437\nAnd it's got these weird values\nthat you don't recognize,\n\n484\n00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:58,610\nwell they're probably the old names for\nthe same values we're talking about today.\n\n485\n00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,320\nSo earned value used to be called\nbudgeted cost of work performed.\n\n486\n00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,410\nNotice that's work performed,\n\n487\n00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,780\nstuff we've already done,\nversus budgeted cost of work scheduled.\n\n488\n00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,180\nWhat's been scheduled out all the way\nto the end of the project, right?\n\n489\n00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,420\nThat's planned value and earned value.\n\n490\n00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,920\nThe old names are a little more\ndescriptive but they were long and\n\n491\n00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,490\nthey used that word budget.\n\n492\n00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,992\nAnd with budget, people think money,\nand they don't think time.\n\n493\n00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:28,010\nEarned value's a combination of the two,\nand so, several years ago,\n\n494\n00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,830\nthey opted to change it.\n\n495\n00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,736\nThat's why we have two names for\nthese things and\n\n496\n00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:35,004\nfortunately on the exam we just have the\nnew name, earned value and planned value.\n\n497\n00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:38,529\nSo, as we go through these\nformulas you'll notice that\n\n498\n00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:42,436\nI've done that on most of these\nwhere I'll have BCWP, BCWS.\n\n499\n00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:44,689\nYou'll see a few other ones\nthat are spread around there.\n\n500\n00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:46,865\nACWP, right there, let's see,\n\n501\n00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:50,780\nit seems like there was one other\none that had some crazy ones.\n\n502\n00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,379\nMaybe that's it.\n\n503\n00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:55,308\nAll right.\nWell you'll see that as we go though so\n\n504\n00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:58,714\njust be aware that you may see a second\nname out there on the internet or\n\n505\n00:25:58,714 --> 00:25:59,320\nwhatever.\n\n506\n00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,600\nBut over here on the right side I just\nuse the new values cuz that's really\n\n507\n00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,990\nall we care about now.\n\n508\n00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,690\nAll right.\n\n509\n00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,190\nSo on the earned value side, we're saying\ntake our plan of value, what we should\n\n510\n00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,630\nhave achieved, And we're gonna multiply\nthat by what we actually did achieve.\n\n511\n00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:19,393\nSo if I go back to my\nexample here my earned\n\n512\n00:26:19,393 --> 00:26:23,858\nvalue that PV * % Complete, right,\n\n513\n00:26:23,858 --> 00:26:30,138\nthat is going to be $1,000,000 * .28,\n\n514\n00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:35,820\nwhich is gonna result in $280,000.\n\n515\n00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,680\nSo my earned value, what I've actually\nearned at this point, is $280,000.00.\n\n516\n00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,230\nI should've only earned $250,000 but\nI've earned $280,000.\n\n517\n00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:50,610\nSo I've actually earned more than\nI expected to at this point right?\n\n518\n00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,680\nAnd so the reason is I got more work done.\n\n519\n00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,640\nNow I'm over budget but\nthis doesn't reflect that.\n\n520\n00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,980\nThis is reflecting the schedule\nside of things, right?\n\n521\n00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,470\nWe'll see formulas in a minute\nthat will show the budget side.\n\n522\n00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,460\nIt all gets tangled together so that's why\nwe're kind of combining scheduling and\n\n523\n00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,630\ncost together.\n\n524\n00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,690\nBut these are the two values.\n\n525\n00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,855\nPlan value and earned value.\n\n526\n00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:12,390\nPlanned value, that's your plan,\nright on the money.\n\n527\n00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,150\nEarned value, that's where we're\nsaying what we've actually done.\n\n528\n00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,250\nWe've done $280,000 worth of work.\n\n529\n00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,690\nWe may have spent more,\nwhich is a problem.\n\n530\n00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,710\nBut that's what we've\nachieved of our project, so\n\n531\n00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,840\nwe're actually ahead of schedule.\n\n532\n00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,560\nWhich makes sense,\n\n533\n00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,400\nI mean we kind of knew that just looking\nat the status report right here.\n\n534\n00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,800\nYou might be screaming at your computer\nright now going Don, this is stupid.\n\n535\n00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,760\nWhy would I do that?\n\n536\n00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,920\nIt was right there in the status report.\n\n537\n00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,900\nWhy do I need a formula\nto show me this garbage?\n\n538\n00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,280\n>> Because you need to know this.\n\n539\n00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,640\n>> You need to know it for the exam.\n\n540\n00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,600\nThat's one reason.\n\n541\n00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,920\nBut the other reason is these numbers\nare gonna be building blocks for\n\n542\n00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,130\nother formulas.\n\n543\n00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,800\nAnd the other formulas are gonna\ngive us data that's not right here,\n\n544\n00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,730\nthat isn't reflected in the data\nthat we just see right off hand.\n\n545\n00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,840\nSo bear with me.\n\n546\n00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,790\nWe're setting up the foundation.\n\n547\n00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,667\nBut you need that foundation.\n\n548\n00:27:56,667 --> 00:28:00,387\nIf you can't calculate these numbers,\nif you can't calculate PV and EV,\n\n549\n00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,885\nthen you might as well not even\nbother memorizing the other formulas.\n\n550\n00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:08,980\nBecause PV and EV are inputs to\nalmost every other formula we use.\n\n551\n00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,837\nYou've got to know them.\n\n552\n00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:10,395\nRight?\n\n553\n00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:11,048\nIt's really important.\n\n554\n00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:14,386\nAll right, well,\nthat's kind of heavy, so far, so\n\n555\n00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:17,817\nwhy don't we stop right here and\ntake a break, right?\n\n556\n00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:20,661\nIt's kind of heavy and we really\njust did the foundational values.\n\n557\n00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:24,059\nSo we got a lot more to go through as\nwe start to calculate this stuff but\n\n558\n00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:25,730\nlet's take a break here.\n\n559\n00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,651\nWhen we get back, we'll continue\non with that, so stay tuned.\n\n560\n00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:28,940\nWe'll be back in a minute.\n\n561\n00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,700\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n562\n00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,829\nwelcome back.\n\n563\n00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:40,900\nSo, before the break, we did some math.\n\n564\n00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,615\nI know it's exciting.\n\n565\n00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:44,000\n[LAUGH] That's why we have these breaks.\n\n566\n00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,480\nWe can take a breather.\n\n567\n00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,250\n>> That's right.\n\n568\n00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,990\n>> So, we created some numbers\nthat were fairly common sense.\n\n569\n00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,730\nWhat we need to figure\nout next is our variance.\n\n570\n00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,360\nRemember in the last episode.\n\n571\n00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,500\nActually do I still have that chart?\n\n572\n00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,890\nI probably still have that chart\npulled up around here somewhere.\n\n573\n00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,510\nHere we go.\n\n574\n00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,900\nI showed this chart right here,\nhow variance is the difference between\n\n575\n00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,900\nwhat you've planned and\nwhat's actually happening.\n\n576\n00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,750\nWell, we need to be able to\ncalculate what that variance is.\n\n577\n00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,540\nYou've got two different variances.\n\n578\n00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,300\nYou've got a cost variance for your budget\nand you've got a schedule variance for\n\n579\n00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,515\nyour, well, schedule, calendar, whatever.\n\n580\n00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:24,260\n[LAUGH] So\nwe need to calculate those two variances,\n\n581\n00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,160\nfigure out what our differences are.\n\n582\n00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,350\nWell fortunately when we do EVM everything\nis being represented as numbers.\n\n583\n00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,680\nReally being represented as money, right?\n\n584\n00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,800\nCost is being measured in terms of\nthe money we've actually spent, and\n\n585\n00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:43,390\nthen the schedule is being represented as\nthe dollar value of the work we've put in.\n\n586\n00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,530\nSo everything's really\nbeing turned into dollars.\n\n587\n00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,860\nWe can represent our variance\nin terms of dollars.\n\n588\n00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,870\nSo we have two very,\nvery similar formulas for this.\n\n589\n00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,795\nNow having similar formulas is\na blessing and a curse, all right?\n\n590\n00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a blessing because it comes super\n\n591\n00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,700\neasy to remember them.\n\n592\n00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,306\nIt's a curse in that it become\nsuper easy to mix them up so\n\n593\n00:30:02,306 --> 00:30:03,809\nwe have to be careful with that.\n\n594\n00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,176\nBut when we calculate variance,\n\n595\n00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:11,256\nwhat we need is we've got our cost\nvariance and our schedule variance.\n\n596\n00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:15,627\nAnd the cost variance,\nif we look at, where is it here,\n\n597\n00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:19,900\ncost variance,\nit's a really simple formula.\n\n598\n00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,510\nWe take our earned value,\nwhat we've actually earned as far as work,\n\n599\n00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:30,680\nand then we subtract our actual cost,\nwhat we've actually spent dollar wise.\n\n600\n00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,130\nEarned value is being calculated off\nof that 28% of our project is done.\n\n601\n00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,980\nThat's what its being calculated off of.\n\n602\n00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,300\nBut actual cost is just raw dollars,\nwhat we've done, what we've spent.\n\n603\n00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,220\nAnd so this is gonna put our costs\nin the perspective of time also and\n\n604\n00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,600\ngive us a representation of whether\nwe're over or under budget, all right.\n\n605\n00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,320\nIt works out really well.\n\n606\n00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,630\nSchedule variance is\nbasically the same thing.\n\n607\n00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,810\nIf we look at schedule variance,\nit's earned value minus planned value.\n\n608\n00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,970\nSo instead of subtracting the actual cost,\nwe subtract the planned value,\n\n609\n00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,360\nthe amount of work that\nwe should've gotten done.\n\n610\n00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,760\nThe result is gonna be a dollar amount,\na dollar amount that represents time.\n\n611\n00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,190\nSo it's kind of bizarre.\n\n612\n00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,440\nLet's start with cost though cuz\nthat's the easier one to understand.\n\n613\n00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,710\nSo I'm gonna go back to\nmy little note screen and\n\n614\n00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,538\nif I want to calculate out my cost\nvariance, I need to remember my formula.\n\n615\n00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:19,418\nEV-AC.\n\n616\n00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:23,830\nAnd just so you guys know, my technique,\n\n617\n00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,350\nmy approach to being successful in an exam\nwith this is to memorize these formulas.\n\n618\n00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,245\nAnd when you go in and\nsit down in that testing booth,\n\n619\n00:31:31,245 --> 00:31:33,075\nyou're not allowed to take\nin any papers in with you.\n\n620\n00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:35,925\nThey give you blank sheets of paper and\na pencil.\n\n621\n00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:38,110\nAnd when you sit down and start that exam,\n\n622\n00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,265\nthe first thing that I do\nis write my formulas down.\n\n623\n00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:42,425\nI do it for two reasons.\n\n624\n00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:43,635\nOne, I don't want to forget them.\n\n625\n00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,220\nI've got them fresh in my mind and\nI don't want to forget.\n\n626\n00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,050\nBut the other reason is when I come\nto a question that's asking me\n\n627\n00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,110\nabout the formulas,\nI don't want to have to sit there and\n\n628\n00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,280\ndredge through my mind to find it.\n\n629\n00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,530\nI want to just look through my papers and\nhave it.\n\n630\n00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,557\nSo if you jot those formulas down,\nthe more you write them down,\n\n631\n00:31:57,557 --> 00:32:00,773\nthe more they get committed to memory,\nthe more you remember them.\n\n632\n00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:02,759\nSo I try and\nwrite them out whenever I can, so\n\n633\n00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,593\nthat's why I'm kind of starting each one\nof these by writing out the formula first.\n\n634\n00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:10,581\nSo my CV is earned value minus AC and\nso now I just need to go up here and\n\n635\n00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:12,640\nfind those building blocks.\n\n636\n00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,970\nWe calculated earned value,\nit was $280,000 so\n\n637\n00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,540\nit's going to be $280,000\nminus my actual cost.\n\n638\n00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,500\nActual cost we didn't have to calculate,\nthat came from our status report.\n\n639\n00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,736\nOur status report say we spent $380,000.\n\n640\n00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:29,530\nSo I'll subtract $380,000.\n\n641\n00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,030\nAnd here you can kind of already\nsee what's gonna happen.\n\n642\n00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,380\nWe're going to end up with\na negative number, right?\n\n643\n00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,698\nFor our cost variance,\n\n644\n00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:40,330\n280,000 minus 380,000 is going\nto be a negative $100,000.\n\n645\n00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,060\nNow be careful with this too.\n\n646\n00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,250\nSometimes on the exam, they can\nuse a negative notation like that.\n\n647\n00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,620\nOther times they use the accounting method\nof writing it which is to put it in\n\n648\n00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,930\nparenthesis.\n\n649\n00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:56,620\nSo a number written in parentheses\nis considered to be negative\n\n650\n00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,240\nin the accounting circles.\n\n651\n00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,040\nThey do that cuz when you see a dash,\nyou know the negative symbol.\n\n652\n00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,450\nDoes that mean we're doing a dash or\nare we subtracting, which one is it?\n\n653\n00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,340\nWe don't necessarily know.\n\n654\n00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,150\nSo, you might see either way.\n\n655\n00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,990\nI'll go ahead and use the negative sign.\n\n656\n00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,978\nSo my cost variance is a -100,000.\n\n657\n00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:14,732\nThat's a pretty big variance, right.\n\n658\n00:33:14,732 --> 00:33:16,200\nThat's a pretty big deal.\n\n659\n00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,960\nSo I know on my costs I'm in trouble.\n\n660\n00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,090\nWhen I was looking up here\nthings were looking good, right.\n\n661\n00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,670\nWhen we did our plan value and our EV,\n\n662\n00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,530\nour earned value was a nice positive\n$280,000, things were looking good, Right?\n\n663\n00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,190\nBut now I'm starting\nto see some negatives.\n\n664\n00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,110\nSo these are where we really\nstart to see that difference.\n\n665\n00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,060\nAnd if we were charting this\nout in a very precise chart,\n\n666\n00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,900\nthere would be a difference here,\nof basically a hundred thousand dollars.\n\n667\n00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,950\nAll right, so now that we've got that.\n\n668\n00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,060\nWe can take a look at\nour schedule variance.\n\n669\n00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,680\nSame thing, but with time.\n\n670\n00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,680\nSo we come in and\nwe say earned value just like before.\n\n671\n00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,730\nExcept instead of subtracting our actual\ncost, we subtract our plan value right?\n\n672\n00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,200\nWhat we should have had at this point.\n\n673\n00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,020\nSo EV minus PV.\n\n674\n00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,168\nSo my earned value is still the same,\nits $280,000.\n\n675\n00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:09,730\nAnd I subtract out my plan value\nwhich we also calculated right here,\n\n676\n00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,296\nat 250,000 okay?\n\n677\n00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:20,112\nNow when we work that out, we gonna put\nthe nice positive number which is $30,000.\n\n678\n00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:22,669\nRight?\n$30,000 means we are ahead of schedule,\n\n679\n00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:23,802\nits positive, right.\n\n680\n00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:26,230\nPositive numbers are ahead or over.\n\n681\n00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,980\nNow, being over budget is\nrepresented negatively.\n\n682\n00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,880\nAs in negative, the bad side of things.\n\n683\n00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,880\nBeing under budget would\nbe a positive number here.\n\n684\n00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,280\nSo it's kind of different.\n\n685\n00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,870\nA negative number here is bad.\n\n686\n00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,460\nA negative number here is bad, but\n\n687\n00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,570\nthey kind of represent different things,\nwell, time versus money.\n\n688\n00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,090\nSo here I can see that I am\ncurrently $30,000 positive, so\n\n689\n00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,790\nI'm ahead of schedule, all right?\n\n690\n00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,480\nSo that's a good thing, right?\n\n691\n00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,730\nI want to be ahead of schedule, don't I?\n\n692\n00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,370\nNot necessarily,\n\n693\n00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,930\nit usually is highlighting some\nkind of problem in my project.\n\n694\n00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,580\nIn this case,\nI've already got a pretty good guess.\n\n695\n00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,790\nI'm probably ahead of schedule because\nI've spent too much money, right?\n\n696\n00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,490\nMaybe I've got people doing overtime,\n\n697\n00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:11,280\nmaybe I've got more employees\non the clock than I had planned.\n\n698\n00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,260\nMaybe people are just trying to get work\ndone early, so this might work itself out,\n\n699\n00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,810\nif that's it.\n\n700\n00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,610\nIf people are trying to get work done\nearly it'll just work itself out, but\n\n701\n00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,120\nif people are doing unauthorized overtime.\n\n702\n00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,570\nI might have a bigger problem,\nI might go over budget.\n\n703\n00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,200\nI've gotta be careful, so\nthese are numbers we need to know, right.\n\n704\n00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,160\nNow, these numbers though\nare a little bit strange.\n\n705\n00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,420\nIf somebody say's how's\nyour schedule doing?\n\n706\n00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,320\nYou go, we're $30,000 ahead of schedule.\n\n707\n00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,010\nThey're gonna say $30,000\nahead of schedule?\n\n708\n00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,070\nWell what does that even mean?\n\n709\n00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,005\nBecause we don't think of time in terms\nof money although the saying is time is\n\n710\n00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:45,020\nmoney right?\n\n711\n00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,490\nBut we don't think of it that way.\n\n712\n00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,620\nSo these numbers as\nthey're presented even for\n\n713\n00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,740\nus as project managers\naren't terribly useful.\n\n714\n00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,410\nWhat we need to do is we need to\nlook at them in the terms of our\n\n715\n00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,380\nentire project from that perspective.\n\n716\n00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,450\nSo we actually have two other things\nthat we'll normally calculate out\n\n717\n00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,390\nright after doing the CV and the SV.\n\n718\n00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,590\nAll right.\nAnd we'll see those in just a second.\n\n719\n00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,960\nBut, just based on these values,\njust based on what we've got here,\n\n720\n00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,780\nwhat can we determine about our project?\n\n721\n00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:23,170\nWell, our project is over budget,\nbut ahead of schedule.\n\n722\n00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:23,840\nAll right?\n\n723\n00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,320\nI know I'm over budget because I\ngot a negative $100,000 here for\n\n724\n00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,820\nmy cost variance.\n\n725\n00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,760\nI've deviated from my\nplanned cost quite a bit.\n\n726\n00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,880\nBut I know I'm ahead of schedule because\nI've got a positive $30,000 here for\n\n727\n00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,200\nmy schedule variance.\n\n728\n00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,460\nAll right, so I could stop right there.\n\n729\n00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:41,960\nI could stop.\n\n730\n00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,830\nI just got a good status\nreport of my project.\n\n731\n00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,150\nSo, there we go, done, that' s it.\n\n732\n00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,730\nBut, there's a lot more formulas.\n\n733\n00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,620\nOne thing that we use very typically\nin project management software,\n\n734\n00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,020\nis what's called a performance index.\n\n735\n00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,640\nA performance index is a number that\nreflects the overall performance of\n\n736\n00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,660\nyour project.\n\n737\n00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,080\nAnd you can do it in terms of your\nschedule, and in terms of your cost.\n\n738\n00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,110\nAnd so you have a schedule\nperformance index or SPI,\n\n739\n00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,292\nand a cost performance index or CPI.\n\n740\n00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:12,010\nAll right?\n\n741\n00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,090\nYou'll see these used very commonly in\na lot of project management software.\n\n742\n00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,530\nThe formulas for\nthem are pretty straightforward.\n\n743\n00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,890\nWe just calculated our variances, right?\n\n744\n00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,820\nSo earned value minus AC or\n\n745\n00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,850\nearned value minus PV, planned value\nin the case of schedule variance.\n\n746\n00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,972\nBut with schedule performance index and\ncost performance index,\n\n747\n00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:35,073\nnotice instead of subtracting\nwe just do divide.\n\n748\n00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:35,910\nRight?\n\n749\n00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,560\nWhen you division,\nwhat you result in is not a,\n\n750\n00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,210\nlike a dollar value, but\na percentage, and the percentages,\n\n751\n00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,550\nthose are a lot more useful for\nrelaying information to people.\n\n752\n00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,670\nIf you say,\nhey we're 15% ahead of schedule,\n\n753\n00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,560\nthat's something that's\na lot more meaningful.\n\n754\n00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,800\nSo, SPI and\n\n755\n00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,880\nCPI are just a manipulation of those\nsame formulas that we saw a moment ago.\n\n756\n00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,660\nIn fact, if we write them side by side.\n\n757\n00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,700\nLet me jump to my notes here.\n\n758\n00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,234\nAll right.\n\n759\n00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:04,800\nSo, let me move that up on the screen.\n\n760\n00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,360\nSo if we write these things side by side.\n\n761\n00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,550\nSo, up here was my cost variance and\nmy schedule variance, and\n\n762\n00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,880\nif I do like CPI and SPI.\n\n763\n00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,650\nMy performance indexes.\n\n764\n00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:22,784\nThe CPI is Earn value,\ndivided by actual cost.\n\n765\n00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:24,280\nAll right.\n\n766\n00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,207\nAnd SPI is earn value\ndivided by plan value.\n\n767\n00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:29,410\nAll right.\n\n768\n00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,200\nIf we look at our formulas\nfrom the last example,\n\n769\n00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,450\nwe just changed the minus sign for\na division sign, and that's it.\n\n770\n00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,310\nSo that makes it easy to\nremember these formulas.\n\n771\n00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,620\nAnd it really is just a different way\nof representing the same exact data,\n\n772\n00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:48,082\nin fact I can really kind of copy and\npaste some of this stuff and grab it.\n\n773\n00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:53,413\nI'm trying to remember,\nwhere is my block highlight command?\n\n774\n00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:54,186\nWhatever.\n\n775\n00:38:54,186 --> 00:39:00,140\n[LAUGH] So we can go in and we can kind\nof take some of this previous math here,\n\n776\n00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,543\nand just swap out that one character\nto represent our new formula.\n\n777\n00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,902\nRight.\nNow obviously the result of this data is\n\n778\n00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:11,200\ngonna be a good bit different\nwhen we go to do that division.\n\n779\n00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,250\nSo I'm gonna fire up my trusty calculator.\n\n780\n00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,290\nTo do that, all right,\nwhich is apparently gigantic.\n\n781\n00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:24,590\nLets start here, so we'll start\nwith 280,000 divided by 380,000.\n\n782\n00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,442\nAll right.\n\n783\n00:39:25,442 --> 00:39:30,066\nWhich is going to result in 0.736,\n\n784\n00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:35,237\nI'll go ahead and round that up to 0.74.\n\n785\n00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:38,340\nAnd then I'll take 280,000 and\n\n786\n00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,520\nI'll divide that by 250,000 and\nI get 1.12 exactly.\n\n787\n00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,074\nSo no rounding needed there.\n\n788\n00:39:46,074 --> 00:39:46,794\nAll right.\n\n789\n00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:50,846\nSo there is my CPI and my SPI,\nmy cost performance index and\n\n790\n00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,065\nmy scheduled performance index.\n\n791\n00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:56,873\nThese numbers are percentages, okay.\n\n792\n00:39:56,873 --> 00:40:00,894\nSo when I look at these,\nwhat I've got here is,\n\n793\n00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:05,737\none that is effectively 26%\nOn the negative, right.\n\n794\n00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:10,200\nSo I'm at 74% of what I'd expect for\nmy cost.\n\n795\n00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,030\nI'm over budget.\n\n796\n00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:16,240\nBut on my SPI, I'm 12% over, right.\n\n797\n00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,550\nI'm ahead of schedule.\n\n798\n00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,850\nSo I can see that right here,\nrepresented pretty easily.\n\n799\n00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,310\nBut it gets very confusing.\n\n800\n00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,440\nI know for me, I get confused too.\n\n801\n00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,880\nSo what I did is.\n\n802\n00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,490\nWell, on my slides, you'll notice I've got\na little legend down here at the bottom.\n\n803\n00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,120\nAnd we'll post these\nwith the episodes too,\n\n804\n00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,380\nalthough it's a little\neasier in the cheat sheet.\n\n805\n00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,170\nBut if we look at our CPI,\n\n806\n00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,805\nwith CPI anything less than\na one means you're under budget.\n\n807\n00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:43,166\nBut anything, actually, you know what,\n\n808\n00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,835\nI've got that backwards\non my slide don't I?\n\n809\n00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:47,295\n>> No, I think you're right.\n\n810\n00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:48,455\nSOM is over budget.\n\n811\n00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:52,645\n>> You know, I'm.\n\n812\n00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,390\n>> Yeah, lesson one should be.\n\n813\n00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,834\n>> Should be, yeah,\nI've got them backwards on a slide,\n\n814\n00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:57,838\nlet me fix that on my slide real quick.\n\n815\n00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,280\nSo we are, less than one is over budget,\nand greater than one is under budget.\n\n816\n00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,770\n>> And then 1, on budget.\n\n817\n00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:06,988\n>> There we go.\n\n818\n00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:10,970\nSo if you are dead on,\n\n819\n00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:16,640\nif your actual cost matches\nexactly what you plan for right?\n\n820\n00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,570\nYou know in your earned\nvalue what you've achieved.\n\n821\n00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:23,330\nIf those match identically dividing one\nnumber by the same number gets a one.\n\n822\n00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,195\nSo hopefully that's what you get for\nyou CPI is one.\n\n823\n00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:29,475\nRight, that's perfect,\nyou're right on track.\n\n824\n00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:32,685\nBut if it is less than one,\nyou're over budget.\n\n825\n00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:33,785\nAnd that's how my project is.\n\n826\n00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,115\nThat's how I spotted that\nerror on my slide there.\n\n827\n00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:38,965\nBecause it's, we're obviously\nover budget on our project.\n\n828\n00:41:38,965 --> 00:41:39,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n829\n00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,750\nIf you are under budget the number\nwill actually be higher than one, so\n\n830\n00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,130\neasy way to tell.\n\n831\n00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,290\nAnd what I did is on that cheat\nsheet which I guess I closed,\n\n832\n00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,500\nI actually put the same little\nlegend on with the formula there so\n\n833\n00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,470\nyou could see it and kind of retain it.\n\n834\n00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:59,830\nNow on the schedule side, if you are less\nthan one, you're behind schedule,\n\n835\n00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,045\nbut if you're greater than one,\nyou're ahead of schedule.\n\n836\n00:42:02,045 --> 00:42:02,860\nAlright.\n\n837\n00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,730\nSo, greater than is usually a good thing.\n\n838\n00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,330\nGreater than one on your SPI:\nyou're ahead of schedule.\n\n839\n00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:12,250\nGreater than one on your\nCPI: you're under budget.\n\n840\n00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,180\nThat's what people normally look for.\n\n841\n00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,090\nBut that's not really what\nyou should be looking for.\n\n842\n00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,790\nWhat you should be looking for\nis a dead one.\n\n843\n00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,740\nAnd the same thing goes for SPI.\n\n844\n00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,620\nIf you get a dead one, exactly one,\nyou are perfect, right on schedule.\n\n845\n00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,560\nOK, that's what we really want.\n\n846\n00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,710\nSo, on the exam, don't say you\nprefer to have it greater than one.\n\n847\n00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,190\nYou prefer to have exactly one.\n\n848\n00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,590\nThat's living up to your plan.\n\n849\n00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,770\nSo nice that we don't have to deviate\ntoo much from the other formulas, so\n\n850\n00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,630\ninstead of subtraction, we do division.\n\n851\n00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,130\nBut the number that results is this\nperformance index that a lot of\n\n852\n00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,120\ncompanies use,\nit's a lot of things that people rely on.\n\n853\n00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,490\nYour project management software can more\nthan likely calculate this stuff for\n\n854\n00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,380\nyou, and I'll show an example\nof that later in the show too.\n\n855\n00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,010\nBut that right there is CPI and SPI.\n\n856\n00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,230\nNow this kind of information,\nwe can turn that into a percentage.\n\n857\n00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:04,870\nYou know that we are 26% over budget or\nwe're 12% ahead of schedule.\n\n858\n00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,610\nSo we can tell that to people and\nit makes more sense to them.\n\n859\n00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:10,038\nThey understand how we've deviated.\n\n860\n00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:12,370\nNow, on budget you might want to\nstick to the numbers on that one and\n\n861\n00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,880\nsay we're this amount of dollars\nover budget from where we should be.\n\n862\n00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,500\nSo those kinds of things\ncan be calculated out, too.\n\n863\n00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,980\nBut for schedule,\nthis is a pretty meaningful number.\n\n864\n00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,162\nThis helps out.\nAll right.\n\n865\n00:43:25,162 --> 00:43:28,530\nSo, cost variance and schedule variance,\ncost performance index,\n\n866\n00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,030\nschedule performance index,\nreally all tied together.\n\n867\n00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,230\nAlright.\n\n868\n00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,890\nWe've got some more to calculate,\nbut what.\n\n869\n00:43:38,095 --> 00:43:39,320\n>> Mm-hm. Right. >> I wanna make\nsure we don't overwhelm people.\n\n870\n00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,855\nNormally we try to keep our episodes\n\n871\n00:43:40,855 --> 00:43:41,440\nlight-hearted--\n>> Right.\n\n872\n00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:41,995\n>> and humorous.\n\n873\n00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:43,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's kinda hard to\n\n874\n00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,850\ndo that when you're\ncrunching numbers here.\n\n875\n00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,915\nSo let's stop and take a break.\n\n876\n00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Give our minds a chance to rest.\n\n877\n00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,040\nAnd when we get back\nwe're gonna continue on.\n\n878\n00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,720\nAll the stuff we've calculated so far was\nshowing where our project is right now.\n\n879\n00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,740\nI know right now I'm over budget.\n\n880\n00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,580\nAnd I know right now\nI'm ahead of schedule.\n\n881\n00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,280\nWhat we're gonna do next is\nwe're gonna see into the future.\n\n882\n00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,705\nWe're gonna open our third eye and\nwe're gonna look out.\n\n883\n00:44:04,705 --> 00:44:07,480\n[LAUGH] You gotta have your PNP third eye.\n\n884\n00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,530\nAnd you gotta look out and\n\n885\n00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:11,010\nsee what things are gonna be\nlike at the end of the project.\n\n886\n00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,370\nHow bad or\nhow good are things gonna be down there?\n\n887\n00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,888\nSo, look to the future when we get back.\n\n888\n00:44:15,888 --> 00:44:20,474\n>> That's right.\n[SOUND] [SOUND] All right,\n\n889\n00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:24,994\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n890\n00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:29,634\nSo in the first two segments, we worked\nthrough some formulas that were fairly\n\n891\n00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:34,205\ncommon sense, they're ones that we're\ngonna use regularly, calculating\n\n892\n00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:39,470\nvariance and the performance index,\nthose are things that we normally do.\n\n893\n00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,560\nNow it's time to kick it up a notch.\n\n894\n00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,272\nNow we're going to move into some\nof the more difficult formulas.\n\n895\n00:44:43,272 --> 00:44:46,220\nThese are ones that are,\nwell the results are commonly used but\n\n896\n00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:49,060\nvery few people actually\ndo these ones by hand.\n\n897\n00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,270\nBut on the exam, you need to do it.\n\n898\n00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,640\nSo we need to take a look at these.\n\n899\n00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,988\nThe first one we're going to look at is\nwhat's called estimate at completion,\n\n900\n00:44:54,988 --> 00:44:56,008\nalright.\n\n901\n00:44:56,008 --> 00:45:01,850\nWhich means, if our project continues on\nthe way that it's continuing on, you know,\n\n902\n00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:06,560\nthe way things are going, what is my\nbudget going to look like when we finish?\n\n903\n00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,370\nI know my budget's a million dollars.\n\n904\n00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,910\nBut at our current pace,\nif we continue on,\n\n905\n00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,545\nwhat am I going to end up spending\nby the end of this project?\n\n906\n00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,290\nAlright.\nSo this is our first chance to look\n\n907\n00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,800\ninto the future of money.\n\n908\n00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,385\nNow if you look at the formula,\nthis one's a bit more drawn out.\n\n909\n00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:24,500\nAlright.\nSo our estimated completion is basically\n\n910\n00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,210\ncalculated by taking our\nbudget at completion.\n\n911\n00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,080\nAlright so that's our original plan and\nsubtracting our earned value.\n\n912\n00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,010\nSo taking away the work\nthat we've already done.\n\n913\n00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:36,870\nSo what's left should be the difference\nbetween the work we've already done and\n\n914\n00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,500\nwhat our plan was.\n\n915\n00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,870\nBut...\nBut then we add in our actual cost.\n\n916\n00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,700\nRemember that the earned value and\nthe actual cost are different.\n\n917\n00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,650\nEarned value is really\nrepresenting that time.\n\n918\n00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,380\nWe're 28% done with this project, right?\n\n919\n00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,405\nBut actual cost.\n\n920\n00:45:51,405 --> 00:45:58,380\n$380,000 we are over budget, so\nit's bringing in both time and money.\n\n921\n00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,520\nIt averages or it calculates that out and\nthen divides it by the CPI.\n\n922\n00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,090\nRemember, the CPI is reflecting how\nfar over or under budget we are.\n\n923\n00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,350\nThe resulting number will\nactually be a dollar value.\n\n924\n00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,550\nAnd it will be the dollar value that\nwe could expect to spend by the end\n\n925\n00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,430\nof this project.\n\n926\n00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,040\nNow, that's quite the mouthful there,\nthat's quite a lot.\n\n927\n00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,570\nLet's see it in action on our project.\n\n928\n00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:24,710\nSo, going back to our project we\nalready know some of our various values\n\n929\n00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:25,310\nlike our CPI.\n\n930\n00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,870\nWe've calculated these and\n\n931\n00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:30,692\nit's important because we need those\nvalues to plug into this other formula.\n\n932\n00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:36,460\nSo now we know we are 24% over budget,\nwe know we are 12% ahead of schedule.\n\n933\n00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,900\nWhat is it going to be like\nwhen it is all said and done?\n\n934\n00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,798\nAnd EAC will tell us that.\n\n935\n00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:42,690\nAlright.\n\n936\n00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,868\nSo the estimate at completion\nis BAC divided by.\n\n937\n00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:48,609\nWhoops, no it's not.\n\n938\n00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:50,460\nLet's see.\n\n939\n00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,176\nOh shoot, I'm mixing things up.\n\n940\n00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:54,750\n[LAUGH] Wonderful.\n\n941\n00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,280\nLet me go back to here.\n\n942\n00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,690\nSo, on this slide here I've got\nmy EAC kind of laid out here.\n\n943\n00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,056\nBut what this actually is is\nnot estimate at completion,\n\n944\n00:47:04,056 --> 00:47:05,600\nthis is estimate to complete, ETC.\n\n945\n00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:10,230\nLet me fix that.\n\n946\n00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,490\n>> No, no,\nI think that's actually the right one.\n\n947\n00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,580\n>> Am I right?\n\n948\n00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,050\n>> Yup.\nThat is EAC that you're working on.\n\n949\n00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,620\n>> Okay.\n\n950\n00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,010\nWell, let's calculate our EAC then.\n\n951\n00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,040\nShoot, I've got a couple\nthings going on here.\n\n952\n00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,760\nAll right, so if I go back to my.\n\n953\n00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,030\nThere.\n\n954\n00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:28,540\nSo my EAC, and\nI start to write this formula out, okay?\n\n955\n00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:33,130\nIf we take our full formula and\nactually, here, I'll just copy it and\n\n956\n00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,680\nsave us a little time,\nsince it's not installed.\n\n957\n00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:41,180\nAll right, so here is our formula and\nwe'll throw that in here.\n\n958\n00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:45,080\nNow we just need to plug in all\nthe various numbers that we got, right?\n\n959\n00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,580\nAnd kind of figure out what\nis going to work for us.\n\n960\n00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,850\nWhy am I thinking this is wrong?\n\n961\n00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:52,000\nI am going to check real quick my-\n>> ETC is not, no actual calls.\n\n962\n00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,830\n>> My, my worksheet here.\n\n963\n00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,190\nLet me just double check.\n\n964\n00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:02,094\nI just want to make sure I'm showing\nthe right thing here as we go\n\n965\n00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:03,864\nthrough the example.\n\n966\n00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:04,956\n>> Let's see your ETC.\n\n967\n00:48:04,956 --> 00:48:06,070\n>> I'm thinking ETC.\n\n968\n00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:06,873\nEstimate to complete.\n\n969\n00:48:06,873 --> 00:48:10,800\nSo You've got your estimate at completion\nwhere you should be when it's all done,\n\n970\n00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,100\nand your estimate to complete,\nin other words,\n\n971\n00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,630\nwhat's left to get to\nwhere you're gonna be.\n\n972\n00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,410\nSo we'll work through both.\n\n973\n00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:20,050\nWe'll get a chance to see both of them.\n\n974\n00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,890\nBut all right, so\nwe'll take this guy right here, and\n\n975\n00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,060\nwe'll run through this formula.\n\n976\n00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,935\nNow, my actual cost right now is what?\n\n977\n00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:27,435\n$380,000 dollars.\n\n978\n00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,712\nAll right, and I'm gonna be\nadding to that my BAC which is\n\n979\n00:48:33,712 --> 00:48:38,650\n$1 million divided by my earned value,\n\n980\n00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:43,500\nmy earned value so\nfar is $280,000, all right, and\n\n981\n00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:48,690\nwe're gonna take the result of that and\ndivide it by the CPI.\n\n982\n00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:51,950\nNow the CPI we just\ncalculated out as 0.74.\n\n983\n00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:56,631\n>> I think that's a subtraction instead\nof a division of your $one million.\n\n984\n00:48:56,631 --> 00:48:58,999\n>> Do I have BAC?\n\n985\n00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:00,474\nOh, it is.\nShoot, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n986\n00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:02,342\n>> I just want to make sure we-\n>> Make sure I don't screw that up, yeah?\n\n987\n00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:03,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See, it should be easy at this point,\n\n988\n00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,080\nI've written the formula and\nI'm not even following it.\n\n989\n00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,190\nSo, now, I just need to run through and\ncalculate the actual value so\n\n990\n00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,625\nthat makes sense, right.\n\n991\n00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,710\nSo, plugging in our true values.\n\n992\n00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:15,975\nSo, I guess some of this I\ncould sorta do it in my head,\n\n993\n00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:20,895\nbut let's fire up the old trusty\ncalculator and run through these.\n\n994\n00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,499\nAll right, I need to figure out, but\nyou've got to remember your order of\n\n995\n00:49:23,499 --> 00:49:25,355\noperations and\ndo all this stuff in the right order.\n\n996\n00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:30,945\nI kinda start with this $1 million and\nI subtract $280,000 from it.\n\n997\n00:49:30,945 --> 00:49:33,136\nSo that's $720,000.\n\n998\n00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:38,910\nI add to that my actual cost of $300,000,\nall right.\n\n999\n00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:43,520\nAnd so now I'm at $1.1 million, as the\nresult of the top part of that formula.\n\n1000\n00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,195\nThen I divide that by my CPI,\nwhich is 0.74, and\n\n1001\n00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:54,361\nI end up with 1.486 million,\nright, $1,486,000,\n\n1002\n00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:59,930\nwhich is a little bit on the high side,\nisn't it, right?\n\n1003\n00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:04,570\nSo, when I write that out, I guess I\ncould've, well no you'll see here.\n\n1004\n00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:09,338\nSo, if I write that out my total\nhere is 1 million, what'd I say 486?\n\n1005\n00:50:09,338 --> 00:50:14,863\nYeah, $486,486.486, so\nI'll round up to 49,\n\n1006\n00:50:14,863 --> 00:50:20,210\nwe're in one of those\nrepeating mathematical things.\n\n1007\n00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:24,960\nSo at my current rate I am so\nfar over budget it's gonna get bad, and\n\n1008\n00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,720\nit's going to compound.\n\n1009\n00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,470\nIt's going to get worse and\nworse and worse as things go on.\n\n1010\n00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,640\nI need to correct, because if you look\nat that budget I'm gonna be 50% over\n\n1011\n00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,510\nbudget by the time this is all said and\ndone.\n\n1012\n00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,410\nThat's pretty hefty right there.\n\n1013\n00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,930\nSo we've got to be really\ncareful with that, all right.\n\n1014\n00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,070\nNow, the other side of that,\nthere is another formula, and\n\n1015\n00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:45,710\nthis is what I'm mixing together, is EAC,\nthe estimate add completion is that\n\n1016\n00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,840\nfinal number of what we're gonna\nhave when the project finishes.\n\n1017\n00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,180\nSo when the project wraps up at the end\nof the day, here's what we will spend.\n\n1018\n00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,890\nAll right, so in my current pattern,\nthat's where I expect to be.\n\n1019\n00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,420\nThere's ETC,\nwhich is estimate to complete.\n\n1020\n00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,890\nAnd I didn't make a slide for this one.\n\n1021\n00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,488\nSo I've got my EAC but\nI didn't make a ETC slide.\n\n1022\n00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:09,025\nEstimate to complete is actually pretty\nsimple because we just take our total\n\n1023\n00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:13,700\nvalue here and we subtract away our actual\ncost that's all ready occurred, and\n\n1024\n00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,585\nthe resulting number that's left is just\nthe amount that we're still gonna have to\n\n1025\n00:51:18,585 --> 00:51:19,673\npony up, right?\n\n1026\n00:51:19,673 --> 00:51:27,922\nSo if you think about it, if we're\nsaying that $1,486,486.49 minus our AC,\n\n1027\n00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:35,114\nminus what we've already spent,\nso we've already spent $380,000.\n\n1028\n00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:39,672\nSo on my current pace, this project,\nif I expect to finish it,\n\n1029\n00:51:39,672 --> 00:51:43,380\nI'm gonna still need to\nhave this much more money.\n\n1030\n00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:50,183\nI'm gonna need $1.1 million in reserves,\nor, left in my budget.\n\n1031\n00:51:50,183 --> 00:51:52,946\nI'm not going to write\nthat all the way out.\n\n1032\n00:51:52,946 --> 00:51:53,898\n486.\n\n1033\n00:51:53,898 --> 00:51:57,044\nI don't want to get right back\ninto that same recursion.\n\n1034\n00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:58,391\nSo, we'll just put that in there.\n\n1035\n00:51:58,391 --> 00:51:59,505\nThere we go, all right.\n\n1036\n00:51:59,505 --> 00:52:02,083\nNow that's a useful number,\nbut not an essential number.\n\n1037\n00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:05,349\nTo say here's the amount of money we need\nleft, cuz what you might do if you have\n\n1038\n00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:07,377\na nice big reserve and\nyou look at your account and\n\n1039\n00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:11,170\nyou're like well we've actually got\n$1.2 million still sitting there.\n\n1040\n00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:11,970\nWe're over budget but\n\n1041\n00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:15,190\nI'm okay with that we're still within\nmy tolerances, that might happen.\n\n1042\n00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,880\nThis overage though is so\nbig that that's never gonna be a case.\n\n1043\n00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,480\nNobody, well I shouldn't say nobody\nthe government probably does,\n\n1044\n00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,720\nmost people don't set a reserve of\n50% of your total project budget.\n\n1045\n00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,020\nThat just reflects really bad planning.\n\n1046\n00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,470\nSo it's normally going to be\nsomething considerably smaller.\n\n1047\n00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,510\nThis is going to be over it.\n\n1048\n00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:37,660\nSo all these numbers are really going to\ntell me is I need to do a lot of work.\n\n1049\n00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,770\nI need to get a lot of things rearranged.\n\n1050\n00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:43,300\nI need to find out where this\noverage is and stop it, okay?\n\n1051\n00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,960\nIt's bad right now, right?\n\n1052\n00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,789\nI should have spent about $250,000\nat this point, but I've actually\n\n1053\n00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:54,960\nspent $380,000, so I know that I've\nspent $130,000 more than I should have.\n\n1054\n00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,080\nSo I'm already 130,000 in the hole.\n\n1055\n00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,900\nBut by the end of this project\nI'll be 486,000 in the hole,\n\n1056\n00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,870\nI need to stop that right away.\n\n1057\n00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:07,620\nIf I stop it now,\nthen I'm just dealing with 130,000.\n\n1058\n00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,280\nRight?\n\n1059\n00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,730\nBut later it's gonna be\nalmost four times that.\n\n1060\n00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,560\nSo we've really gotta\nnip in that in the bud.\n\n1061\n00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,790\nThat's what these numbers see,\nthat's what these numbers show us.\n\n1062\n00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,985\nThey show us that future that\nwe don't want to live in.\n\n1063\n00:53:17,985 --> 00:53:19,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1064\n00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,370\nAll right, so, those are important, right?\n\n1065\n00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:25,211\nImportant numbers to be able\nto calculate that out and see.\n\n1066\n00:53:25,211 --> 00:53:29,114\nSo, EAC, ETC, really just kinda\ncalculating out that future, and\n\n1067\n00:53:29,114 --> 00:53:32,412\nit's dollars that we get, but\nit's not just our budget,\n\n1068\n00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:36,751\nbecause if you look at the formulas,\nwe are factoring in that earned value.\n\n1069\n00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:40,470\nAnd earned value, if we go way back here,\nis being calculated by percentage\n\n1070\n00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,856\ncomplete, that number right there,\nwhich is a reflection of time.\n\n1071\n00:53:43,856 --> 00:53:45,680\nRight, the amount of\ntime it's been worked.\n\n1072\n00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,930\nSo these numbers down here\nare aggregates right,\n\n1073\n00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,810\nthey were combining the time and the cost.\n\n1074\n00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,690\nAll right.\n\n1075\n00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,510\nThe last of the formulas I wanna actually\nshow you is, there are other ones, but\n\n1076\n00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:05,030\nthe last one we really need to focus in on\nis the To-Complete Cost Performance Index.\n\n1077\n00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,440\nThe CPI, the cost performance index,\n\n1078\n00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,810\nthat's letting us see where\nwe're at right now but the TCPI,\n\n1079\n00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:16,060\nthe To-Complete Cost Performance Index.\n\n1080\n00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,737\nLet me bring my slide up so\nyou can see how that's written.\n\n1081\n00:54:18,737 --> 00:54:21,477\nHere we go, so it's like To-Complete.\n\n1082\n00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:22,661\nCost.\n\n1083\n00:54:22,661 --> 00:54:25,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I left out the word cost right there.\n\n1084\n00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,381\nThere we go.\nSo that's it,\n\n1085\n00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:31,490\nthe To-Complete complete\ncost performance index,\n\n1086\n00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:36,150\nis a modification of the CPI to reflect\nwhat things are gonna be like at the end.\n\n1087\n00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:36,850\nTo complete, right?\n\n1088\n00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:39,870\nSo, in order to complete\nthis particular project,\n\n1089\n00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,660\nwhat's things gonna be\nlike way down there.\n\n1090\n00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:46,140\nNow, this is the hardest of the formulas\nthat I'm gonna show you guys.\n\n1091\n00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,880\nThe reason is,\nthere's two variations of it.\n\n1092\n00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,080\nIf your project is running\nalong like normal and\n\n1093\n00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:58,670\nthings are still good, then you\nhave one formula to use, all right?\n\n1094\n00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,790\nBut if you're sitting here calculating\nTCPI, the odds are things have gone wrong.\n\n1095\n00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:06,290\nWe don't normally calculate\nTCPI if things are going well.\n\n1096\n00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,750\nSo things are going wrong, we need to see\nthat vision of how bad things are gonna be\n\n1097\n00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,690\nso we sit down and figure out the TCPI.\n\n1098\n00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:13,790\nIf things are really bad,\n\n1099\n00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:19,070\nyour budget at completion,\nyour original budget may already be shot.\n\n1100\n00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,850\nYou may already be over it,\nthat's when you normally see this.\n\n1101\n00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:25,290\nIf you're already over\nyour budget at completion,\n\n1102\n00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,450\nthere's no way to unspend money.\n\n1103\n00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,230\nThe only solution there is a change\nticket to increase your budget,\n\n1104\n00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,080\nthat's really the only solution.\n\n1105\n00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,980\nSo if you're at that point in the game,\n\n1106\n00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:40,610\nwhere your actual cost have exceed your\nbudget at completion, the formulas break.\n\n1107\n00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,240\nIt actually breaks this formula here and\nyou end up with these you know,\n\n1108\n00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,990\ndivide by negative numbers and\nthings like that.\n\n1109\n00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:45,920\nIt's a mess, right?\n\n1110\n00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,280\nSee how I've got budget at\ncompletion minus actual cost?\n\n1111\n00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,710\nSo if our actual cost is higher\nthan the budget of completion,\n\n1112\n00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,040\nwe get a negative number.\n\n1113\n00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,050\nSo you're dividing something by a negative\nnumber which doesn't work out so well.\n\n1114\n00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,240\nYou end up with what, like i?\n\n1115\n00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, imaginary\n\n1116\n00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,260\nnumbers or something.\n\n1117\n00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,618\nSo if that's the case,\nyou can't use this formula.\n\n1118\n00:56:03,618 --> 00:56:07,694\nSo there's a variation of it right here,\nwhere instead of using the budget\n\n1119\n00:56:07,694 --> 00:56:11,070\nat completion, we use the estimate\nat completion, the EAC.\n\n1120\n00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:15,788\nThe EAC is what we calculated\nJust a moment ago right here.\n\n1121\n00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:19,179\nNow, the EAC is an estimate based\non your current performance, and\n\n1122\n00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:21,750\nso that will result in\na positive number down here.\n\n1123\n00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,410\nYour EAC will be less\nthan your actual cost.\n\n1124\n00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,970\nI mean it will be greater\nthan your actual cost.\n\n1125\n00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:28,370\nSo you'll always get\na positive number on that one.\n\n1126\n00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,300\nIt fixes the formula.\n\n1127\n00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,480\nWhen your on the exam,\nhere's the really challenging part.\n\n1128\n00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,420\nYou have to look and\nsee if the project is broken.\n\n1129\n00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,980\nThe easy way to spot that Is if\nthe actual cost is bigger than\n\n1130\n00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,540\nthe budget at completion, you may not\neven worry about that, like identifying.\n\n1131\n00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,130\nYou may just go and work the formula.\n\n1132\n00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,660\nAnd if you get a negative number here,\nthe division won't work.\n\n1133\n00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,900\nAnd when that happens that's when you\nremember, oh, I need to change that.\n\n1134\n00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,990\nAnd instead of using BAC,\nwe use EAC to handle it.\n\n1135\n00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,750\nAll right.\n\n1136\n00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,870\nOtherwise we're just plugging\nour values in there, and\n\n1137\n00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:02,220\nwe get our performance index that\nrepresents our project status.\n\n1138\n00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,910\nSo let's run our project through it.\n\n1139\n00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:08,880\nNow on ours,\nif we look at the data on ours, our budget\n\n1140\n00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,600\nat completion is a million dollars, and\nour actual cost so far is $380,000.\n\n1141\n00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,930\nSo a million minus $380,00 is\nstill a positive number, so\n\n1142\n00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,690\nour project is not broken.\n\n1143\n00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,330\nWe can use the normal TCPI formula.\n\n1144\n00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,870\nSo for my TCPI, I just need to\nremember what that formula is, right?\n\n1145\n00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:32,724\nTCPI = and it's our (BAC-\n\n1146\n00:57:32,724 --> 00:57:40,945\nEV) / (BAC-AC)\n>> What was it?\n\n1147\n00:57:40,945 --> 00:57:41,513\n>> BAC minus AC.\n\n1148\n00:57:41,513 --> 00:57:42,960\n>> There.\n\n1149\n00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,635\nAll right, so now we can feed in our\nvalues into that and then get it.\n\n1150\n00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:51,705\nSo our BAC is a million dollars, so\nwe know this is gonna be $1 million.\n\n1151\n00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,580\nMinus our EV and our EV is $280,000.\n\n1152\n00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:00,800\nAnd that's all gonna be\ndivided by our BAC which\n\n1153\n00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,230\nis $1,000,000 minus and\nthen whatever our actual cost is,\n\n1154\n00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:08,290\nour actual cost being $380,000.\n\n1155\n00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:14,240\nLet me move that up on the screen\nmy head's covering it.\n\n1156\n00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,848\nThere we go.\n\n1157\n00:58:15,848 --> 00:58:19,450\nAll right, I'll just feed that into my\ntrusty calculator to get my actual value.\n\n1158\n00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:27,472\nSo for me, so far I have TCPI equals\n100,000 minus 280,000 is 720,000?\n\n1159\n00:58:27,472 --> 00:58:32,254\nSo, we are looking at\n720,000 divided by 620,000.\n\n1160\n00:58:32,254 --> 00:58:34,976\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1161\n00:58:36,754 --> 00:58:40,736\n>> This is when it gets dangerous when I\nstart doing the math in my head instead of\n\n1162\n00:58:40,736 --> 00:58:41,990\nusing the calculator.\n\n1163\n00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,520\nAnd then we divide those out.\n\n1164\n00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,180\nI'll use the calculator for that.\n\n1165\n00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:56,775\nIf we take 720,000 divided\nby 620,000 we get 1.1612 so,\n\n1166\n00:58:56,775 --> 00:58:59,200\nour TCPI is a positive number.\n\n1167\n00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,920\nIt's high.\n\n1168\n00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,230\nAnd that lets us know that in this case\nour two complete performance indexes.\n\n1169\n00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:09,820\nIn order to complete this project, we're\ngoing to end up spending more money and\n\n1170\n00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,900\nwe're over 16% higher\nthan where we should be.\n\n1171\n00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,150\nA one is what we expect to see.\n\n1172\n00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,550\nWhere this all breaks even and\nwe end up with our solid numbers.\n\n1173\n00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,930\nSo we know we're in trouble here.\n\n1174\n00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,500\nWe need to get that back\ncloser to our one on this one.\n\n1175\n00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,970\nOn this one a value\nhigher than one is bad.\n\n1176\n00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,110\nAlthough a value lower than\none isn't good either.\n\n1177\n00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:30,780\nYou really do want to be on that one.\n\n1178\n00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,930\nBut a value over is definitely\nworse than what we want.\n\n1179\n00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,120\nSo our two complete performance\nindex here is a little bit high.\n\n1180\n00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,980\nSo if you notice, it's not all\nthat different from our SPI and\n\n1181\n00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,970\nCPI that we had before.\n\n1182\n00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,170\nWell, I guess it is pretty different from\nCPI but that's because it's factoring\n\n1183\n00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,630\nthe two together and\nit's creating this new number.\n\n1184\n00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:50,270\nSo that is the two complete\ncost performance index.\n\n1185\n00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:53,490\nNow, you might look at that and go, Don,\nyou're crazy, I'm never going to use this,\n\n1186\n00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,580\nthis is the dumbest thing in the world,\nbut remember the purpose of it.\n\n1187\n00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,380\nThe purpose is,\nyou might have ten different projects, and\n\n1188\n00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:01,340\nyou wanna compare\nthe status of all of them.\n\n1189\n01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,750\nMaybe your company is running\nout of money, and you say,\n\n1190\n01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:07,190\nall right,\nwe've got ten projects going on,\n\n1191\n01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:11,220\nwe've gotta cut two of them where we\ngotta cut three or however many projects.\n\n1192\n01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,570\nWhich one do we pick?\n\n1193\n01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:17,350\nWell, let's look at them and let's\npull the TCPI of all ten projects and\n\n1194\n01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,460\nlet's compare that.\n\n1195\n01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,000\nRight?\n\n1196\n01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,870\nThe projects that are closer to a one,\nwe know how much they're gonna cost.\n\n1197\n01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:23,710\nThey're doing great.\n\n1198\n01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,930\nThey're on their budget,\nwe can stick with them.\n\n1199\n01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:30,130\nBut ones with a TCPI that's\nwidely deviated, right?\n\n1200\n01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,230\nLike a 0.16, that's really deviated.\n\n1201\n01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:36,550\nIf it's that far off, well this is one\nthat's gonna be costing us a lot more than\n\n1202\n01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:40,470\nwe planned and it's all ready out of\ncontrol, so it's a dangerous project.\n\n1203\n01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,400\nMaybe we should just shut it down, right?\n\n1204\n01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,210\nShut it down instead of\ncontinuing on because if we look,\n\n1205\n01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:48,190\nwe already know that we're\nover budget on this guy.\n\n1206\n01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:48,870\nRight?\n\n1207\n01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:52,150\nAnd to complete we're gonna\nend up way over budget.\n\n1208\n01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:56,630\nSo if we just stop now, we'll save\nourselves not only the $300,000 we'd\n\n1209\n01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:00,490\nbe extra over budget, but we would also\nsave ourselves the rest of the expenses of\n\n1210\n01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,200\nthis project just by stopping it.\n\n1211\n01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,280\nSo it's a good measure that companies\ncan use to evaluate which projects\n\n1212\n01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,200\nare at risk.\n\n1213\n01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,220\nRight?\nThat's fine.\n\n1214\n01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,200\nBut also which projects are prime for\n\n1215\n01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,670\nthe chopping block when it\ncomes time to cancel projects.\n\n1216\n01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:17,360\n>> A lot of times for us, remember that\nthe goal is not to wait until you're so\n\n1217\n01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,020\nclose to the end of the project that then\nyou go, hey, we decided this then, but\n\n1218\n01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,020\nis to do this along the way.\n\n1219\n01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,330\nThe more often that you're\ndoing this the easier it is for\n\n1220\n01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,810\nyou to actually project that trend out and\nfor you to know.\n\n1221\n01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,590\nSo remember that when this point when\nthe established port that we're getting is\n\n1222\n01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:35,990\nthat we're about 25% in well we're\nnow starting to see that and so\n\n1223\n01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:40,850\nit gives us a great marker at every point\nthat we do this that we can say all right\n\n1224\n01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:45,080\nif we continue to go up next month it's\ngonna continue to trend this way and\n\n1225\n01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,520\nthat's where it's gonna be bad.\n\n1226\n01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,160\nSo doing these numbers early is the key.\n\n1227\n01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:48,660\n>> Yep.\n\n1228\n01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n1229\n01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,240\n>> And you're gonna do that.\n\n1230\n01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,610\nYou're not gonna use these formulas once.\n\n1231\n01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:54,040\n>> Yeah.\n>> You're gonna use them every week and\n\n1232\n01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,340\nthe core or every month\n>> Yeah.\n\n1233\n01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,790\n>> However depending on\nhow long your project is.\n\n1234\n01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,270\nEvery week might be too aggressive.\n\n1235\n01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:02,240\nBut if you do it ever week the cool\npart is you can have your CPI\n\n1236\n01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,285\nweek after week after week.\n\n1237\n01:02:03,285 --> 01:02:06,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And you can compare them one week\n\n1238\n01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:06,925\nto the next.\n\n1239\n01:02:06,925 --> 01:02:07,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right\n\n1240\n01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,050\n>> And when you do those measurements,\n\n1241\n01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,410\nthere is actually a slight variation here.\n\n1242\n01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:13,090\nSo I'm glad you mentioned it Ronnie.\n\n1243\n01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:16,330\nNormally when we do this,\nwe might be doing the reporting just for\n\n1244\n01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,770\nthat one period.\n\n1245\n01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:22,310\nOr we might be doing it for the cumulative\nperiods throughout the entire project.\n\n1246\n01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,500\nSo you may see a variation.\n\n1247\n01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,420\nAnd I actually did put\nthis on my cheat sheet.\n\n1248\n01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,750\nNotice how a lot of these values,\nlike I've got,\n\n1249\n01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:33,560\nlet me find a good one,\nwell here it is, CPI.\n\n1250\n01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:38,660\nSo here's CPI, cost performance index,\nand I've got CPI equals EV divided by AC.\n\n1251\n01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,720\nBut then I've got cumulative cost\nperformance index, all right.\n\n1252\n01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,970\nWhile CPI, we might be calculating\nthe cost performance index for\n\n1253\n01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:49,610\na particular period of\nthe project that one time.\n\n1254\n01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:53,700\nBut cumulative means we are looking\nat the project as a whole.\n\n1255\n01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,530\n>> Right.\n>> And so that will often times be denoted\n\n1256\n01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:00,650\nwith a little, what's that called,\nsuperscript, when it's up like that?\n\n1257\n01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:06,180\nA little C up above it, so if you\nsee CPI with a superscript C, or EV,\n\n1258\n01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:10,720\nor AC, with that superscript, if I zoom\nin we can see that a little bit better,\n\n1259\n01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:16,170\nthat little up there C, that's letting\nus know that it's a cumulative value.\n\n1260\n01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:21,350\nAnd I put those here in my cheat sheet and\nI didn't put a star on them, right?\n\n1261\n01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,000\n>> Not because they won't\nshow up on the exam but\n\n1262\n01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,660\njust because it's not something\nwe worry about too much.\n\n1263\n01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,240\nIt's the same formula.\n\n1264\n01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,040\nCPI and CPIC, it's just the same formula.\n\n1265\n01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,700\nThe difference is\nthe values we feed into it.\n\n1266\n01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,630\nRight?\nThe earned value for that particular\n\n1267\n01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:40,110\nperiod and the actual cost for that\nparticular period or the earned value for\n\n1268\n01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:44,170\nour project as a whole and the actual\ncost for our project as a whole.\n\n1269\n01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:50,200\nMost people don't differentiate\nthose as two separate formulas.\n\n1270\n01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,380\nAll right.\n\n1271\n01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:54,160\nBased on that hopefully I've\ngiven you a good example here,\n\n1272\n01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,685\nshowing you the way we\ncan take a project and\n\n1273\n01:03:56,685 --> 01:04:00,095\nwe can calculate these different\nnumbers and how we use them.\n\n1274\n01:04:00,095 --> 01:04:03,771\nIf you have the formulas memorized then\nit's not such a big deal to do these,\n\n1275\n01:04:03,771 --> 01:04:04,754\nit's simple Math.\n\n1276\n01:04:04,754 --> 01:04:07,802\nAnd you do actually have a little\ncalculator you can use on the test so\n\n1277\n01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,120\nyou don't even have to do\nthe heavy math yourself.\n\n1278\n01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,975\nBut If you don't know these formulas.\n\n1279\n01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:14,090\nThis is not intuitive stuff.\n\n1280\n01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:17,546\nSome of the earlier parts are, but\nthe later parts, these later formulas,\n\n1281\n01:04:17,546 --> 01:04:19,290\nthey're not very intuitive.\n\n1282\n01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,490\nBut if they ask you to\ncalculate the TCPI for\n\n1283\n01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,400\na project, you need to know how to do it.\n\n1284\n01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,430\nAnd if I had just this\ninformation here at the top,\n\n1285\n01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:30,710\ncould I immediately jump and\ncalculate my TCPI?\n\n1286\n01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:34,420\nNo, in that formula, budget at completion.\n\n1287\n01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,790\nI got that from the original description,\nand actual cost,\n\n1288\n01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,710\nI got those from the original description,\nbut earned value?\n\n1289\n01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,430\nI didn't get that from\nthe original description.\n\n1290\n01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:49,330\nSo, you get this data, you'd have to\nturn around and calculate earned value.\n\n1291\n01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:52,805\nAnd once you add earned value,\nthen you could go and do TCPI.\n\n1292\n01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:57,170\nSo often times you'll need more than\none formula to solve the problem.\n\n1293\n01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:00,230\nSo understanding how these formulas\ntie together is pretty important.\n\n1294\n01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,490\n>> Right.\n\n1295\n01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:04,260\n>> So those are some examples.\n\n1296\n01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,418\nIf you've already registered\nwith the PMI and joined, and\n\n1297\n01:05:07,418 --> 01:05:10,765\nyou've gotten your copy of the PMBOK,\nin the PMBOK is a table,\n\n1298\n01:05:10,765 --> 01:05:14,134\nI'm not the fondest of it because\nit is really, really small.\n\n1299\n01:05:14,134 --> 01:05:15,526\n>> That's tiny.\n\n1300\n01:05:15,526 --> 01:05:18,430\n>> But it's table 7.1,\nwhere they go through and\n\n1301\n01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,020\nthey lay things out kind\nof the same way I did.\n\n1302\n01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:24,720\nHere's PV, EV, AC, and\nthey say what they are, right?\n\n1303\n01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,010\nNow the nice part is they do give you a\ngood description and when to use them, and\n\n1304\n01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:29,100\nthen they show the formula.\n\n1305\n01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,840\nSo very similar to the cheat\nsheet that I've done.\n\n1306\n01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,410\nIf you like this formula better,\nby all means, use it.\n\n1307\n01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:38,170\nThey have the how to use it value,\nwhich I don't have in my cheat sheet.\n\n1308\n01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:41,960\nSo if you're just going to straight\nup memorize my sheet might be better.\n\n1309\n01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,590\nBut if you're learning in the beginning\nthe sheet in the PMBOK can be a lot\n\n1310\n01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:46,668\nmore helpful.\n\n1311\n01:05:46,668 --> 01:05:50,560\nAnd so as you go down the list all\nthe various ones that you may see.\n\n1312\n01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:55,850\nSo there just kinda laid out there's TCPI,\nETC, EAC, and so on.\n\n1313\n01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:59,010\nAnd so these are the ones\nthat I have starred in mine\n\n1314\n01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:01,720\nbecause these are the ones that\nare going to be on the exam, right.\n\n1315\n01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,200\nThere are other formulas out\nthere though that I call forth\n\n1316\n01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,170\nin your like lines of communications and\nestimated value.\n\n1317\n01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,270\nWe talk about these in other shows, right.\n\n1318\n01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:13,785\nLike doing a six point estimate,\nor three point estimate modified.\n\n1319\n01:06:13,785 --> 01:06:15,750\nSo that's that formula right there.\n\n1320\n01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,400\nOr calculating total float.\n\n1321\n01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,080\nSo I've got a little bit more in there.\n\n1322\n01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,280\nBut that one table.\n\n1323\n01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,142\nIt was what? Table 7, dash. >> One.\n\n1324\n01:06:21,142 --> 01:06:22,756\n>> One?\n\n1325\n01:06:22,756 --> 01:06:23,271\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1326\n01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:27,460\nSo, table 7.1 in the PMBOK fifth edition.\n\n1327\n01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:30,500\nIt's got the majority of\nthat stuff listed, also.\n\n1328\n01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,240\nIt also had the little legend on the side.\n\n1329\n01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,930\nPositive, neutral, negative, right?\n\n1330\n01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:37,320\nThose are the things that we need to\nknow about when we calculate this.\n\n1331\n01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,140\nSo, hopefully, that's a good overview.\n\n1332\n01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,286\nExpect to probably watch\nthis episode more than once,\n\n1333\n01:06:44,286 --> 01:06:46,814\nI know the first time that I learned this\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1334\n01:06:46,814 --> 01:06:47,760\n>> It was a lot,\n\n1335\n01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,720\nit was definitely a lot to grasp.\n\n1336\n01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,310\nThe concepts make sense, but\njust memorizing the formulas,\n\n1337\n01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,440\nthat takes a lot of work.\n\n1338\n01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,190\nOh, you know what, I did say I was\ngoing to show you guys one thing,\n\n1339\n01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,550\nlet me show you this.\n\n1340\n01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,550\nIf you're an in-the-field project manager,\n\n1341\n01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,320\nthe odds are you've never\nused these formulas, and\n\n1342\n01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,700\nthe reason is, your project management\nsoftware probably does it for you.\n\n1343\n01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:09,780\nSo, as a great example, I wanted to\nshow you guys Microsoft Project, and\n\n1344\n01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,880\nI just kinda whipped up a sample\nproject before the show.\n\n1345\n01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:18,760\nAnd this is the sample project that\ncomes with Microsoft Project and they\n\n1346\n01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,470\nhave this default Gantt Chart View where\nyou see what your project is doing and\n\n1347\n01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:26,600\nstuff, but\nI created a custom view right here.\n\n1348\n01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:31,380\nAnd in Microsoft Project, it actually can\ncalculate out a lot of these values, but\n\n1349\n01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,980\nnotice they're the old names.\n\n1350\n01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:36,210\nACWPB, BCWP, BCWS,\nthey've been renamed but\n\n1351\n01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:39,520\nthey are the same things\nthat we just talked about.\n\n1352\n01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:44,551\nAnd as I scroll over we will\nstart to see cost variance, CPI,\n\n1353\n01:07:44,551 --> 01:07:51,570\nthere's our performance index, EAC, SPI,\nSV, and even TCPI, all right there.\n\n1354\n01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:55,848\nIt's calculating them for us and\nthat's pretty awesome stuff,\n\n1355\n01:07:55,848 --> 01:07:58,970\nbecause it means we don't\nhave to deal with it.\n\n1356\n01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:01,694\nSo when we start flagging\nthings as complete, and\n\n1357\n01:08:01,694 --> 01:08:06,370\nmaybe we're 76% complete there and so on,\n\n1358\n01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:11,940\nit's going to start calculating out all\nthese values to reflect what we're doing.\n\n1359\n01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,160\nAnd what we should see, here we go, when\nwe start to get our schedule variance,\n\n1360\n01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,520\nI've got some negatives, right.\n\n1361\n01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,910\nI'm not where I should\nbe on some of these.\n\n1362\n01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:24,620\nAnd so it's calculating that out\nsaving us a heck of a lot of time.\n\n1363\n01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:27,240\nAll right,\nnow I didn't actually enter in work hours.\n\n1364\n01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,230\nThat's why a lot of this stuff\nis still going to show as good.\n\n1365\n01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:33,170\nBut my schedule variance is off because\nI didn't change my status date.\n\n1366\n01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:34,950\nSo it's showing things as\nbeing behind schedule.\n\n1367\n01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,660\nSo that's a great way to be\nable to use this stuff and\n\n1368\n01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,180\nnot have to know the formulas,\nbut you can see them.\n\n1369\n01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,020\nSo if you wanna experiment around in\nan environment you're familiar with,\n\n1370\n01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,550\nyou can do it and kind of see how\nall this stuff gets affected.\n\n1371\n01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:47,900\nBut it's really cool stuff.\n\n1372\n01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,060\n>> It is.\n\n1373\n01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,570\n>> Never thought I'd say it about math.\n\n1374\n01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:54,211\nI wasn't the greatest math student.\n\n1375\n01:08:54,211 --> 01:08:57,020\nSo, all right, so\nthose are some of the formulas.\n\n1376\n01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,110\nIt's a lot to take in.\n\n1377\n01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:58,670\n>> Yeah.\n\n1378\n01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:02,060\n>> So, definitely take\nadvantage of us as a resource.\n\n1379\n01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:05,500\nIf you have questions on any of this,\nbe

00:00:42,930\n>> It's going well but\nI am still surprised that there is no,\n\n6\n00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,580\nthat Hello Kitty is not a cat [LAUGH].\n\n7\n00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,000\n>> Now I've got to inquire.\n\n8\n00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,850\nWere you on a Hello Kitty news website?\n\n9\n00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,870\n>> I was.\n\n10\n00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,560\nYeah it was my fan mail.\n\n11\n00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,190\nNo I was reading and I found that out and\nso my world views changed.\n\n12\n00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,820\nI found out from the official\ncurator of Hello Kitty.\n\n13\n00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,150\n>> So there's a curator.\n\n14\n00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,980\n>> There's a curator for Hello Kitty, yes.\n\n15\n00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,510\nAs a project manager\nsometimes we get accused of\n\n16\n00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,194\nintroducing needless bureaucracy and\nwasting people's time.\n\n17\n00:01:12,194 --> 00:01:13,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now we got a new defense, right?\n\n18\n00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,080\n>> That's right.\n\n19\n00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,601\n>> If everybody ever says\nthat you can say, hey,\n\n20\n00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,088\ndid you know there's\na Hello Kitty curator?\n\n21\n00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:21,740\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know.\n\n22\n00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,690\n>> We're gonna jump back into\nthe world of project management.\n\n23\n00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,740\nWe've been moving along in our monitoring\nand controlling phase or process group.\n\n24\n00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,390\nNow we're on the downhill slope of things.\n\n25\n00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,950\nWe've gone through a lot of technical and\nheavy stuff this section.\n\n26\n00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,450\nSo, we talked about all of our various\ncontrols, and we took a look at EVM,\n\n27\n00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,510\nright, and all the mathematical formulas.\n\n28\n00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,550\nAnd between that and all the stuff\nwe did back in planning, it's a lot.\n\n29\n00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,280\nRight?\nYour brain's probably hurting by now with\n\n30\n00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,980\nall the information you gotta gather.\n\n31\n00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,092\nWell, the last handful of processes\nit's really down hill, right?\n\n32\n00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:58,120\nIt's really just applying\nthe things we have already covered,\n\n33\n00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,850\nso now we just move into our last few\nepisodes as we discuss and wrap up.\n\n34\n00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,843\nWe are definitely on the down\nhill side of things.\n\n35\n00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:10,073\nLet me show you I'll just show you the pin\nbox, in the monitoring process group.\n\n36\n00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:12,370\nWe can move the control schedule,\ncontrol cost.\n\n37\n00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,860\nToday we're picking up with\ncontrol quality, all right.\n\n38\n00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,260\nControlling quality.\n\n39\n00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,210\nWe've really already visited a lot of\nthat because we did quality assurance,\n\n40\n00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,570\nwhich is stopping problems\nbefore they occur.\n\n41\n00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,070\nNow we're doing quality control,\nidentifying problems after they occur.\n\n42\n00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,720\nBut it was all developed\nback in our plan originally.\n\n43\n00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,530\nWe'll do control communications which,\n\n44\n00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,950\nagain is really just implementing\nthe communications we planned from before.\n\n45\n00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,800\nControlling our risks taking all\nthe action that we set forth before.\n\n46\n00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,610\nControlling procurements and\ncontrolling stakeholder engagement.\n\n47\n00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,860\nYou know these are really,\nreally simple things.\n\n48\n00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,670\nSo we're going to jump\nthrough those this episode.\n\n49\n00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,470\nI think we'll be able to get\nthrough all that this episode.\n\n50\n00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,890\nWe'll see and then start to wind\ndown our project management,\n\n51\n00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,530\nhey after that is just closing\nwhich is mostly empty, right?\n\n52\n00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> So we'll get a chance to see\n\n53\n00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,750\nthat later.\n\n54\n00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,530\n>> All right.\n\n55\n00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,680\n>> So let's go ahead and dive in.\n\n56\n00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,540\nWe are gonna start with control quality,\nand the control quality process, let me\n\n57\n00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,340\njust pull it up here, is, it's one of the\nbigger ones we're gonna talk about today.\n\n58\n00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,620\nIt's got a lot of stuff involved.\n\n59\n00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,740\nRemember that control quality is taking\na look at the work that's being done,\n\n60\n00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,740\nand evaluating it to make sure it\nmeets your quality requirements.\n\n61\n00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,260\nNow, even if you're not\na manufacturing plant,\n\n62\n00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,510\nyou still have quality requirements.\n\n63\n00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,645\nYour qualities are your requirements.\n\n64\n00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:25,935\nRight?\nWhen you created your\n\n65\n00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:28,815\nproject scope you had a requirements list.\n\n66\n00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:31,505\nIs the work being done\nmeeting your requirements?\n\n67\n00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:33,175\nRight, that's your quality.\n\n68\n00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:34,985\nBut if you're a manufacturing environment,\n\n69\n00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:37,527\nyou might have very\nspecific quality controls.\n\n70\n00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:39,637\nYou might have things\nlike units of measure.\n\n71\n00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,387\nThere was an example\nin a book I read once.\n\n72\n00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:47,197\nIt was talking about a factory where they\nmade I think it was like pickles right?\n\n73\n00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:50,663\nAnd so you had a jar, they filled it with\npickles and a machine would come down and\n\n74\n00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,253\nscrew the lid on the jar.\n\n75\n00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:55,903\nAnd when it screwed the lid on the jar,\nit measured it in pounds per square inch,\n\n76\n00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,033\nso PSI.\n\n77\n00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:00,803\nSo they had to measure the PSI\nas they screwed that on and\n\n78\n00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:03,313\nmake sure it was within\na certain tolerance range.\n\n79\n00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:04,963\nVery very precise.\n\n80\n00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:05,763\nRight.\nI know I've made\n\n81\n00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:07,553\nthe reference of like\nin a blue jean factory.\n\n82\n00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:10,383\nMonitoring for the amount of\ndefects in jeans manufactured.\n\n83\n00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,863\nThose things may be very\nprecise measurements\n\n84\n00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:14,870\nin a manufacturing type environment.\n\n85\n00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,100\nIn a IT environment where\nit's mostly service oriented,\n\n86\n00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,470\nwe don't normally have that.\n\n87\n00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,375\nBut we might have other\nquality measures that we use.\n\n88\n00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:27,880\nSo, first off, if we're going to be\nmonitoring the work that's been done and\n\n89\n00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,750\nmeasuring it against our\nquality requirements,\n\n90\n00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,720\nwell, we need ways to get that data.\n\n91\n00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,510\nAnd that's where inputs come from.\n\n92\n00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,880\nThe first input is the project\nmanagement plan, right.\n\n93\n00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,780\nIt sets forth our quality statement.\n\n94\n00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,310\nOur quality control plan is in there.\n\n95\n00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,210\nWe need that to know what to do.\n\n96\n00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,890\nAfter that, the rest of this is\ndata that feeds as an input, right?\n\n97\n00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,580\nSo, quality metrics.\n\n98\n00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,810\nI need to know, all right,\nhere's the work that's been done.\n\n99\n00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,495\nGive me the metrics on it.\n\n100\n00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:54,255\nAnd those quality metrics,\nthey can be a number of different things.\n\n101\n00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:57,245\nLet me bring up the notes\nwe've got on this one.\n\n102\n00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:58,045\nHere we go.\n\n103\n00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:02,075\nThings like function points, mean time\nbetween failure, mean time to repair.\n\n104\n00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,845\nThese are quality metrics that we get.\n\n105\n00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,755\nThey may be specific measurements.\n\n106\n00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:09,490\nThey may be the amount of failures that\nwe've had in a certain environment.\n\n107\n00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,390\nThings like mean time between failure.\n\n108\n00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,100\nSometimes we know failure\nis going to happen and\n\n109\n00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,560\nwe just need to measure\nthe time in between it.\n\n110\n00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,730\nI gave an example in an earlier episode\nabout a manufacturing company that makes\n\n111\n00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,130\ncowboy hats.\n\n112\n00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,660\nAnd how after a certain amount of hats,\nthe equipment wears out, and so\n\n113\n00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,750\nthey have to retool the equipment every so\nmany months or weeks or years,\n\n114\n00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,720\nwhatever their interval is.\n\n115\n00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,300\nWell that's the mean time between failure,\nhow long it take that it could fail and\n\n116\n00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,940\nneed to be retooled.\n\n117\n00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,320\nIf we notice that time\nis getting shorter and\n\n118\n00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,650\nshorter it may be indicative\nof another problem.\n\n119\n00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,810\nBut if we're not tracking\nthat then we don't know so\n\n120\n00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,930\nit's something we got to keep an eye on.\n\n121\n00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,600\nMean time to repair is after a failure.\n\n122\n00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,530\nHow long does it take to get it up and\noperational again?\n\n123\n00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,680\nWhen we go to retool that equipment,\n\n124\n00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,300\nis this something that's\nonly going to take a week?\n\n125\n00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,220\nOr is it something that's\ngoing to take months?\n\n126\n00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,107\nMy wife just bought a Subaru.\n\n127\n00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:07,802\nAnd when she bought it,\nit was supposed to come in one week and\n\n128\n00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,277\nended up coming two or three weeks late.\n\n129\n00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:12,574\nSo she didn't get when\nshe was supposed to, and\n\n130\n00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:15,849\nit turned out that there was something\ngoing on at the manufacturing\n\n131\n00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,678\nplant where they had to redesign\ntheir assembly process.\n\n132\n00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,335\nAnd it shut the plant down for two months.\n\n133\n00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:25,185\nSo, they identified a problem and then,\nfor two months, they did not make\n\n134\n00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,615\na single vehicle up there while they\nretooled and corrected the issue.\n\n135\n00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:30,695\nAnd then they started manufacturing again.\n\n136\n00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:35,975\nIf that happens during your project,\nwhat's that gonna do to your end result?\n\n137\n00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,645\nThat's really gonna hurt your schedule,\nso these are things that we need to keep\n\n138\n00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:41,440\ntrack of and make sure that\nwe've got good estimates for.\n\n139\n00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,530\nWe'll need those in our\ncommunications later on.\n\n140\n00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,360\nAll right.\nSome of the other things that we've got.\n\n141\n00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,210\nQuality checklists, right?\n\n142\n00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,712\nThe quality checklists are our go-to\ntool to make sure the quality's being\n\n143\n00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:54,567\nmaintained.\n\n144\n00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:58,515\nIf you've got a list of requirements,\nat a minimum that works.\n\n145\n00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:01,368\nOr if you've got a detailed quality\nchecklist that was developed in\n\n146\n00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:04,569\nthe planning phase, you just walk up to\nthe people that are doing the work and\n\n147\n00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:05,810\nyou run down the checklist.\n\n148\n00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,970\nHave they done this, have they done that,\nhas this requirement been met?\n\n149\n00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,810\nWhat's going on.\n\n150\n00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,480\nAnd then you see what's happened and\nwhat hasn't.\n\n151\n00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,350\nSo those checklists get filled\nout as part of executing.\n\n152\n00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,670\nAnd then they get turned over to us in\nmonitoring and controlling to review.\n\n153\n00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,930\nSo it's an input here.\n\n154\n00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,820\nWork performance data, right?\n\n155\n00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,440\nAll the progress and status reports that\nwe get from our employees on the ground,\n\n156\n00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,170\nthe ones who are doing the executing.\n\n157\n00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,700\nRight?\n\n158\n00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,090\nWe get their data and\nthen we monitor and control it.\n\n159\n00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,620\nApproved change requests.\n\n160\n00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,100\nNow, this is an important one\nhere with control quality,\n\n161\n00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,010\nbecause the change requests may\ndirectly affect our quality control.\n\n162\n00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,070\nSo what we check for\nwhat we consider is tolerant and so on.\n\n163\n00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,970\nIf that changes we need to be aware of it.\n\n164\n00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,720\nSo those are always gonna be input.\n\n165\n00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,230\nOur deliverables.\n\n166\n00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,771\nIf the people who are executing create\na product, or a service or whatever it is\n\n167\n00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:58,224\nthat's one of our deliverables inside\nof the project we need to measure it.\n\n168\n00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:00,399\nWe need to take a look at it,\nmake sure it meets our requirements.\n\n169\n00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,215\nThis is kind of like the scope validation\nthat we talked in another episode.\n\n170\n00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:07,631\nThis is very similar,\nexcept we're focused on the quality side.\n\n171\n00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:10,811\nSo it might not be the overall scope\nthat we're comparing against, but\n\n172\n00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:14,150\na separate set of quality requirements\nset forward from the quality plan.\n\n173\n00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,920\nThen we've got our project documents and\nour organizational process assets,\n\n174\n00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,780\nwe don't have our enterprise\nenvironmental factors here.\n\n175\n00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,920\nThe way you do business,\n\n176\n00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,280\nbecause the way you do business shouldn't\naffect the way you do quality control.\n\n177\n00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,160\nQuality control doesn't care\nwhat kind of business you're in.\n\n178\n00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,020\nIt says, you need to meet these\nrequirements, have you met them?\n\n179\n00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,610\nSo that's why we don't see\nenterprise environmental factors.\n\n180\n00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:43,246\nWhen it comes to actually working\nwith all that data that we get,\n\n181\n00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:45,391\nwe get a handful of tools and techniques.\n\n182\n00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,415\nThese are all ones that we've seen before,\nin other episodes so\n\n183\n00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:50,128\nthere's nothing really new here.\n\n184\n00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:55,120\nBut to kind of review them,\nthere's these seven basic quality tools.\n\n185\n00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,121\nAnd these are really seven different types\nof charts that we can use when mapping out\n\n186\n00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,180\nfor quality.\n\n187\n00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,584\nThe PMBOK has a great example of that.\n\n188\n00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,241\nLet met pull that up here.\n\n189\n00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:07,210\nHere we go.\n\n190\n00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,912\nSo, this is table figure 8-7 in the PMBOK,\nyou can find it and\n\n191\n00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:17,876\nit basically shows these seven\ncommon quality tools and\n\n192\n00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:21,160\nthey're pretty straightforward.\n\n193\n00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,560\nSo we got things like our cause and\neffect diagram.\n\n194\n00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,350\nIf we're having failures,\nwhere are they coming from?\n\n195\n00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,812\nThe effect is a failure,\nwhat was the cause?\n\n196\n00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:30,170\nWhat led to that?\n\n197\n00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,130\nAnd so we start to identify it,\nyou'll hear these called different things.\n\n198\n00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,190\nYou'll see Ishikawa diagrams or fish bone\nbut those are cause and effect diagrams.\n\n199\n00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,860\nFlow charts, now flow charts are usually\nused as part of our checking process to\n\n200\n00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,550\nsee if quality has been met.\n\n201\n00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,700\nIs this measurement accurate?\n\n202\n00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700\nYes or no?\n\n203\n00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,100\nIf yes, go this route.\n\n204\n00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,830\nIf no, go this route and\ndifferent actions happen.\n\n205\n00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,420\nFlow charts are nice because you can\nactually have corrective measures\n\n206\n00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,480\nbuilt into them.\n\n207\n00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,000\nSo yes, the defect might be present, but\nyou might already have a way to fix it.\n\n208\n00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,340\nSo 10% of the blue jeans you\nmanufacture come out missing a button.\n\n209\n00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,960\nAnd so you just send them back through\nthe conveyor belt or whatever, and\n\n210\n00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,350\nyou can stick a button on them.\n\n211\n00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,320\nSo if that's already\nbuilt into your process,\n\n212\n00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,190\nyou have a flow chart that shows that.\n\n213\n00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,545\nFlow chart that shows that-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:16,390\n>> Kinda screw up my letters there.\n\n215\n00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:16,940\nCheck sheets.\n\n216\n00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's another one.\n\n217\n00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,480\nCheck sheets.\nI use them all the time.\n\n218\n00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,820\nYou basically, the check sheet or\n\n219\n00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,260\nchecklist you have just\nan entry requirement.\n\n220\n00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,250\nAnd you just walk down ticking\noff the ones that they've got and\n\n221\n00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,245\nleaving the ones that they don't and\nthat's a great way to measure progress.\n\n222\n00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:36,805\nPareto diagrams, here's where we map\nout all of our causes of failure.\n\n223\n00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:39,265\nSo anywhere we have something\nthat's not meeting quality,\n\n224\n00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,055\nwe map out what was the cause.\n\n225\n00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:44,535\nAnd then we arrange it so\nthat the greatest cause is first.\n\n226\n00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:49,710\nSo we can spot which one is the biggest\nsource of failures inside our process.\n\n227\n00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,170\nThe reason we map them all out together\nis that we can sure that they add up and\n\n228\n00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,132\ntotal the full amount of\nfailures in the system.\n\n229\n00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:57,560\nYou wanna make sure you account for\nall sources.\n\n230\n00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,672\nWe also have histograms.\n\n231\n00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:03,632\nAgain, very similar just mapping out\nour causes and laying them out and\n\n232\n00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:06,866\nkind of putting the most common\ncauses toward the center so\n\n233\n00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,060\nwe can identify which ones to address.\n\n234\n00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,580\nControl charts are another one.\n\n235\n00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,240\nIt's really hard to see here in this\ndiagram, because it's really small.\n\n236\n00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360\nLet me show you.\n\n237\n00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,540\nI whipped up a little bit of\nan example of a control chart earlier.\n\n238\n00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,070\nControl charts are neat,\nbecause when you have a project and\n\n239\n00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,520\nyou set for some kind of a design.\n\n240\n00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,270\nYour design likely has a target\nthat you're trying to hit.\n\n241\n00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,855\nSo I'm gonna just call it my target and\nlet me change this around a little bit.\n\n242\n00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:46,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Put those a little too close.\n\n243\n00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,240\n>> So let's say we have a target\nnumber that we're trying to hit.\n\n244\n00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,310\nSo when we design something we want\na measurement to be a very specific value\n\n245\n00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,880\nand that's going to be my target.\n\n246\n00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,278\nSo when I design my project\nI get things set up,\n\n247\n00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,821\nI come up with all this stuff\nis gonna keep overlapping.\n\n248\n00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:06,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go, with a target.\n\n249\n00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,350\nSo when I go from manufacturing,\nI'm trying to hit a particular value.\n\n250\n00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,990\nAnd so I lay that one.\n\n251\n00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,730\nWow, I just cannot click on things today.\n\n252\n00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,400\nThere we go.\nHere's my target.\n\n253\n00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,310\nSo as I manufacture this,\n\n254\n00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,160\nI want the measurement to be right\nthere where that blue line is and\n\n255\n00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,190\nthat blue line's actually pretty hard to\nsee, so let's change that to green, there.\n\n256\n00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,430\nSo that's my target,\nthat's what I want to hit.\n\n257\n00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,600\nThat's where I expect my stuff\nto be as I manufacture it.\n\n258\n00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,480\nThat's my target.\n\n259\n00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,000\nOver time I start doing measurements.\n\n260\n00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,050\nSo maybe these are months.\n\n261\n00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,210\nSo in January, I am right on target.\n\n262\n00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,200\nThings are exactly where they need to be.\n\n263\n00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,440\nIn February, I was a little bit\nabove where I needed to be.\n\n264\n00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,420\nIn March, things are back in line.\n\n265\n00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,250\nThat was exactly where I needed to be.\n\n266\n00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,940\nIn April,\nthey started to go back above again.\n\n267\n00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,520\nBut I'm keeping track of that.\n\n268\n00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,430\nNow, when I'm above,\ndo I need to do something about it?\n\n269\n00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,930\nMaybe, maybe not, okay?\n\n270\n00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:07,080\nMaybe, depending on our tolerance,\nour control limits.\n\n271\n00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,410\nYou have a control limit that specifies\nhow many defects or how many failures or\n\n272\n00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,460\nhow many deviations?\n\n273\n00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,770\nThey're usually at standard\ndeviations from the norm.\n\n274\n00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,600\nThat you will accept without\nhaving to take action.\n\n275\n00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,532\nSo I might say, man I am shooting for\nless than 30% defects.\n\n276\n00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:29,890\nBut I might have an upper\ncontrol limit of 35 defects and\n\n277\n00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,200\na lower control limit, well you probably\nwouldn't have a lower control limit,\n\n278\n00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,030\nthe upper is the most defects that I would\nallow without having to take action.\n\n279\n00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,570\nA lower well, if I had zero defects,\n\n280\n00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,162\nI'd be-\n>> Yeah.\n\n281\n00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:41,460\n>> Perfectly happy with that.\n\n282\n00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,750\nSo you might just have an upper limit.\n\n283\n00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,640\nLet's go back to that pickle jar example.\n\n284\n00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,220\nSo screwing that lid on to a pickle jar.\n\n285\n00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,180\nWell, if I need that to go on at four psi.\n\n286\n00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,910\nThat's the amount of pressure,\nI need for that lid to be on.\n\n287\n00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,100\nIf it's under four psi, it might not\ngo on tight enough and it'll leak.\n\n288\n00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,880\nIf it's over four psi, it might go\non too tight and shatter the glass.\n\n289\n00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,040\nSo there I've got an upper and\na lower limit.\n\n290\n00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,460\nSo we create those control limits,\nupper limits and lower limits.\n\n291\n00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,800\nAnd they identify that threshold,\nwhat we're willing to get?\n\n292\n00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,720\nSo I might come in an define\nan upper limit right here.\n\n293\n00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,550\nAnd then do a lower limit also, okay.\n\n294\n00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,430\nNow, [COUGH] when we do this,\nwhen we map our points.\n\n295\n00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,070\nWe're saying here's where we're at or\nwhere we're going and so on.\n\n296\n00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,390\nWhat we're doing is we're measuring\nagainst the target, what we wanna hit and\n\n297\n00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,500\nour limits.\n\n298\n00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,895\nAnd as we start to have defects as long as\nthey're within the upper and lower limits,\n\n299\n00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:50,890\nI'm okay.\n\n300\n00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,367\nYeah, these jars right here, the lids\non a little too tight but it's fine.\n\n301\n00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:57,260\nIt wasn't enough to break the glass and\nit's definitely not going to leak.\n\n302\n00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,440\nAnd over here it dips down just\na little bit but it's fine.\n\n303\n00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,120\nIt's not gonna leak,\nit's not gonna shatter, it's good.\n\n304\n00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,980\nSo as we map, I actually see\nI'm really close right here.\n\n305\n00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,560\nBut it's at this point which\nis probably July or August,\n\n306\n00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,010\nnow my lids are going on too tight which\nis probably resulting in shattered jars.\n\n307\n00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,580\nOr just angry customers who can't get-\n>> Yeah.\n\n308\n00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,310\n>> It open without having to get a wrench.\n\n309\n00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,470\nSo [COUGH] there's a problem.\n\n310\n00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,430\nWhen you see a limit like this or\n\n311\n00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,780\na measure a metric that's over the limit\nyou're said to be out of control.\n\n312\n00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,960\nThat's where that term\ncomes from out of control.\n\n313\n00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,450\nYou've exceeded your control limit.\n\n314\n00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,740\nSo in this case my upper\nlimit versus my lower.\n\n315\n00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,130\nNow, when we map this we're looking for\ntwo things.\n\n316\n00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,630\nOne, I wanna see if I'm out of control.\n\n317\n00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,430\nIf that happens,\nI need to do something about it.\n\n318\n00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,162\nAfter the fact, right?\n\n319\n00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:46,390\n>> Right.\n>> That's quality control.\n\n320\n00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,410\nQuality assurance uses these too though.\n\n321\n00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,870\nWe should have seen this problem coming.\n\n322\n00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,712\nIf you look at all of these numbers,\nwe could have done a trend.\n\n323\n00:15:55,712 --> 00:16:00,395\nThere's been a standard trend\nfrom start to finish on these\n\n324\n00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:03,495\nthat shows my defects are increasing.\n\n325\n00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,480\nI see this general upward slope.\n\n326\n00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,569\nAnd so, we should have been able\nto spot that very early on.\n\n327\n00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:14,429\nAs we started way back here and\nkind of moved along our numbers,\n\n328\n00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:19,670\nI guess we kind of averaged it out,\nit would be something like that.\n\n329\n00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,690\nAnd what that's showing us is\nthat if we just left this be,\n\n330\n00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,140\nif we just left it running the way that\nit was running, it's getting worse and\n\n331\n00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,970\nworse and worse and we probably could\nhave spotted that way back here and\n\n332\n00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,160\nfixed it before we broke that limit.\n\n333\n00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,000\nThat's quality assurance.\n\n334\n00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,750\nQuality control,\nwe're looking to see if we crossed it.\n\n335\n00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,330\nSo, if we've crossed it,\nnow we take action.\n\n336\n00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,497\nThese types of charts,\nthey're called control charts and\n\n337\n00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:48,092\nthey're extremely useful.\n\n338\n00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:54,710\n>> The usefulness [LAUGH] of this chart\nalso helps especially in manufacturing.\n\n339\n00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,400\nWhen you start to be able to trend this\nkind of stuff, it may even point you to\n\n340\n00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,510\nthe fact that as you take a look at\nthe defect that happened, you may go,\n\n341\n00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,420\nis this due to the idea that there's\nsomething wrong with the product assembly.\n\n342\n00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,730\nOr is there something that we actually\ncan fix and then go back and go alright,\n\n343\n00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,890\nwe're going to replace something in six\nmonths instead of eight months here.\n\n344\n00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,740\nSo, just by being able to spot this\nhere inside of the control limits,\n\n345\n00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,940\nwhich way that they go, it may tell you\nthat a piece of machinery is wearing out.\n\n346\n00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,940\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n347\n00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,630\nSo, the only way we know this,\nthough, is if we measure it.\n\n348\n00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,420\nAnd we measure it regularly, routinely.\n\n349\n00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,710\nSo, we need to be watching these,\nand the interval,\n\n350\n00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,920\nit really depends on your business.\n\n351\n00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,040\nDo you need to watch it every day,\nevery week, every month?\n\n352\n00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,630\nAnd it's your people on the field who\nare gonna be sending you this data.\n\n353\n00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,840\nBut it's you that puts the data\ntogether to see the big picture.\n\n354\n00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,720\nSo that we can see week after week, or\nmonth after month what that trend is.\n\n355\n00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,810\nSome of the other ones that were in here,\nwell,\n\n356\n00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,750\nI guess the only other\none is a scatter diagram.\n\n357\n00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,120\nScatter diagrams are very similar.\n\n358\n00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,280\nWe start to plot those instances\nof that particular thing and\n\n359\n00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,840\nnotice where the average is.\n\n360\n00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,080\nYou'll see outliers and\nyou can kinda see one way down here, so\n\n361\n00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,120\nmaybe on this chart they're measuring\nthe tightness of that jar's lid for\n\n362\n00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,816\na hundred of those jars so\neach dot represents one jar.\n\n363\n00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:12,675\nAnd I can see the bulk of them\nare following right where I want them to.\n\n364\n00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,350\nWe got a few outliers,\n\n365\n00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,025\nthose are our defects, but as long as\nthey're within our limits, we're okay.\n\n366\n00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,710\nThose are our seven standard tools.\n\n367\n00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,110\nThat's what they're\ntalking about back here.\n\n368\n00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,150\nSeven basic quality tools that we use and\nthey can be used for quality assurance and\n\n369\n00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,760\nquality control.\n\n370\n00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:34,690\nStatistical standpoint,\nif you are generating a large\n\n371\n00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,430\nquantity of things,1,000 pairs of\nblue jeans, as part of your project.\n\n372\n00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,540\nWell, you can't check every single one,\ncan you?\n\n373\n00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,150\nMaybe, if you got the time you can.\n\n374\n00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,327\nBut if you're on a schedule,\nthen you're probably pressed for time and\n\n375\n00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,008\nyou can't inspect every single one.\n\n376\n00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:53,620\nSo, the general practice is to do\nwhat's called statistical sampling.\n\n377\n00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:59,370\nYou grab maybe every tenth pair,\nif you grab every tenth pair of jeans,\n\n378\n00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,530\nnow instead of having to look at a 1,000\npairs, you're only looking at a 100.\n\n379\n00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,275\nIt's a smaller number, but\n\n380\n00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:08,195\nyou'll get a good enough idea of\nwhat your defect rate is from that.\n\n381\n00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:10,445\nIt does need to be\nstatistically significant.\n\n382\n00:19:10,445 --> 00:19:13,985\nSo, you don't just wanna grab one pair,\nor grab three pairs in a row.\n\n383\n00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,635\nIt needs to be spread out\nthrough the population.\n\n384\n00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:19,865\nAnd grab that nice generality,\nget that poll together, and sample it.\n\n385\n00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:22,735\nIt's how political polls work,\nit's how a lot of systems work.\n\n386\n00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:24,860\nIt's a very generally accepted practice.\n\n387\n00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,560\nBut it does lead to inspection, inspection\nwhere we just go and we actually look.\n\n388\n00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,870\nThat is the best way to verify.\n\n389\n00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,000\nIf you're applying those quality\nchecklists, you're doing an inspection.\n\n390\n00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,650\nAnd then, approved change request review,\nnow what does that mean?\n\n391\n00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,500\nWell, when there's a change\nrequest that goes in\n\n392\n00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,400\nthat modifies something like our upper or\nlower control limits, or\n\n393\n00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,980\nuppers the manufacturing process,\nor it modifies something.\n\n394\n00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,369\nWhen something like that gets changed,\n\n395\n00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:57,020\nwe need to review it to see if we\nneed to update our checklists,\n\n396\n00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,972\nupdate our flow charts,\nupdate our other quality control items.\n\n397\n00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:04,682\nSo that we can be measuring them properly\nwithin the new limits that we're set\n\n398\n00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:07,030\nforth, based on those change requests.\n\n399\n00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,960\nA good change request would\nalready indicate those downstream\n\n400\n00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,340\nchanges that need to be made,\nbut they don't always.\n\n401\n00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,750\nSo, we need to make sure we review\nany approved change request and\n\n402\n00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,329\nmake sure that we take\nthe appropriate action.\n\n403\n00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,970\nNow, our outputs, they're big or\nat least they look big.\n\n404\n00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,540\nThere's a lot of stuff in here but\nmost of it's pretty straightforward.\n\n405\n00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,988\nOur quality control measurements,\nthat's our charts,\n\n406\n00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:34,630\nour measurements that we made,\nthat data that we output.\n\n407\n00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,450\nAny validated changes.\n\n408\n00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,480\nWe looked at the changes\nthat were requested.\n\n409\n00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,460\nWe've implemented.\n\n410\n00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,450\nWe made sure that they were done properly.\n\n411\n00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,450\nOur verified deliverables.\n\n412\n00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,440\nWe got deliverables back here.\n\n413\n00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,490\nNow, that we ran quality control against\nthem to make sure they met our needs,\n\n414\n00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,820\nthey met the requirements and\nthey fell within our tolerances then,\n\n415\n00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,510\nnow they're verified deliverables.\n\n416\n00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,310\nNow, they're good and\nthey're ready to go to scope validation.\n\n417\n00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,300\nScope validation wants those\nverified deliverables.\n\n418\n00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,140\nOur work performance information, WPI.\n\n419\n00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,370\nWe've mentioned that many times.\n\n420\n00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,420\nIt's just our interpreted results based\non the work performance data that we get.\n\n421\n00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,660\nWork performance data being just for\na particular period of time.\n\n422\n00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,500\nWork performance information\nusually being trends over time.\n\n423\n00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,920\nChange requests, we may have to generate\nnew change requests based on the result\n\n424\n00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,530\nof the quality of\nthe information that we found.\n\n425\n00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,900\nYou start to notice these defects and\nyou come up with solutions.\n\n426\n00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,400\nAfter that, it's just paperwork.\n\n427\n00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,570\nProject management update,\n\n428\n00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,810\nplan updates, project document updates and\norganizational project assets updates.\n\n429\n00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,880\nThose are just changes to our paperwork\nas we fill out this information and\n\n430\n00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,070\nstore it as part of our project.\n\n431\n00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,490\nControlling quality, like I said,\nnot the hardest of ones.\n\n432\n00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,960\nIt is a lot of work but\nit's really just applying those checks and\n\n433\n00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,420\nbalances that we created earlier.\n\n434\n00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,100\nDefinitely, for the exam, you definitely\nwanna be familiar with these seven charts.\n\n435\n00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,860\nBecause they show up in planning quality\nmanagement, quality assurance, and\n\n436\n00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,600\nquality control.\n\n437\n00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,480\nThree separate process areas, so\nyou definitely wanna be aware of that.\n\n438\n00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,690\nRonnie, I think that about\nwraps up quality control.\n\n439\n00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,340\nCan you think of anything\nelse to throw in?\n\n440\n00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,670\n>> Nope, just kinda remember that for\nus here, the whole process of control and\n\n441\n00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,792\nquality really is about, hey, we're\nabout to finish the final product here.\n\n442\n00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:22,920\nWe wanna make sure that our stakeholders\nare pleased with what's actually gonna\n\n443\n00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,140\nend up happening.\n\n444\n00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,240\nAnd the only way we can do it\nis by using these tools here.\n\n445\n00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,120\nWe can't be the project manager that says,\nokay,\n\n446\n00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,290\nwe'll just accept whatever\ncomes off the line.\n\n447\n00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,780\nWe've got to actually make sure that this\n\n448\n00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,830\nparticular process in itself is\nwhere our stakeholders are gonna\n\n449\n00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,810\nbe really happy with whatever we\nactually end up with as an output.\n\n450\n00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:44,010\n>> We're kinda lucky in IT because most\nof the stuff we do is not tangible.\n\n451\n00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,260\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it's a lot easier quality on.\n\n452\n00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,728\n>> Yeah, but it works.\n\n453\n00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:51,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're good.\n\n454\n00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,950\n>> Well, ladies and gentlemen,\nlet's stop here and take a break.\n\n455\n00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,150\nWhen we get back, we've got more\nprocess groups to jump into.\n\n456\n00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,390\nWhat is next on our table?\n\n457\n00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,660\n>> I believe it's communications.\n\n458\n00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,390\n>> Okay.\n>> Yep.\n\n459\n00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,220\n>> So,\nwe'll jump into communications next.\n\n460\n00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,140\nStay tuned.\n\n461\n00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,028\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n462\n00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:11,750\n[SOUND]\n>> Well, all right.\n\n463\n00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,360\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n464\n00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,380\nSo, we wrapped up controlling quality.\n\n465\n00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,040\nNow, we're gonna take a look\nat controlling communications.\n\n466\n00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,761\nWe've seen communications\nmore than once now.\n\n467\n00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:22,910\nThe idea is simple.\n\n468\n00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,320\nWe gather our data,\nwe distribute our data.\n\n469\n00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,350\nBut here in the monitoring controlling\nphase, we're making sure that that's\n\n470\n00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,670\nhappening in the executing phase\nwhere it's actually occurring but\n\n471\n00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,110\nhere we're just making\nsure that it happens.\n\n472\n00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,850\nSo, our inputs here\nare really straightforward.\n\n473\n00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,930\nOur project management plan,\n\n474\n00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,570\nwhich is pretty much an input\nto everything at this point.\n\n475\n00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:47,440\nOur project communications and\nour issue log, these guys are important,\n\n476\n00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,870\ncuz any time there's an issue in\nthe project, we can have a record of that.\n\n477\n00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,700\nAnd in terms of communications,\nI'll tell you what it is mostly.\n\n478\n00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,516\nIt's usually one of two things.\n\n479\n00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:59,469\nIt's either one, people complaining\nabout not getting enough data, or two,\n\n480\n00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:01,956\npeople complaining about\ngetting too much data.\n\n481\n00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:03,012\nThey both happen.\n\n482\n00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:05,918\nSo, what'll happen is\nin the planning phase.\n\n483\n00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:09,047\nYou'll ask people hey how\nmuch do you want to receive.\n\n484\n00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:12,220\nHow much in the way of communications do\nyou want to receive about this project.\n\n485\n00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,980\nWe're going to do daily status updates and\n\n486\n00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,490\nwe're gonna do other\ntypes of notifications.\n\n487\n00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,920\nAnd they say, you know what just send\nit all to me, I really want that.\n\n488\n00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,090\nBut then once you actually get going,\nthey say, wow,\n\n489\n00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,800\nyou know I'm not reading these emails.\n\n490\n00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,660\nIt's kind of a waste.\n\n491\n00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,100\nCan you just not send them to me?\n\n492\n00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,780\nOr, I've been going to the meetings and\nthey haven't been beneficial.\n\n493\n00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,480\nCan I just not come to those,\nand you just send me a summary?\n\n494\n00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,901\nSo we put those in the issue log and\nthen we make updates to our stakeholder.\n\n495\n00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:41,537\nWe'll talk about stakeholders a little bit\nlater, but when we make updates to our\n\n496\n00:24:41,537 --> 00:24:45,310\ncommunications plan, and so on,\nto reflect those new communications.\n\n497\n00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,570\nIf people aren't getting enough data,\nif something happens and they go, boy,\n\n498\n00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,570\nI wish you would have told me that.\n\n499\n00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,660\nAnd you say, well, you know,\nyou asked to get a monthly summary.\n\n500\n00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,880\nIf you want a weekly or\ndaily one we can send that to you.\n\n501\n00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,270\nThat goes in the issue log\nto show that that happened.\n\n502\n00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,980\nAnd then we make the changes\nto make it happen.\n\n503\n00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,950\nSo that's why we need to\nmake sure we've got that.\n\n504\n00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,535\n>> Yeah.\n\n505\n00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:07,825\nThis communication process also involves\nthat idea that the dominant is here in\n\n506\n00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:08,725\nterms of timing.\n\n507\n00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:14,745\nBecause changes can happen very rapidly in\na project we have to make sure that we're\n\n508\n00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:18,805\ncontrolling the communications lines\nin terms of official communications and\n\n509\n00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:19,315\nunofficial.\n\n510\n00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:22,875\nWe had mentioned this before that\nsometimes these communications get\n\n511\n00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,280\na little bit garbled.\n\n512\n00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,440\nWhere now business takes place in\nsomething like a happy birthday email.\n\n513\n00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,600\nWere we supposed to act on that or not?\n\n514\n00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,350\nBeing able to control that, as well as\nmaking sure we get the timely approvals,\n\n515\n00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,630\nthe timely, you know,\nhere's the change that actually happened.\n\n516\n00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,570\nAnd all of a sudden somebody looks\nat it and goes, when did it happen?\n\n517\n00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,620\nWell, that's what this process is to do.\n\n518\n00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,840\nIs to help us to ensure that\nthat stuff doesn't happen.\n\n519\n00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,540\n>> Our tools and techniques are really\njust you using your noodle, right?\n\n520\n00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,470\nExpert judgement, that's the main one.\n\n521\n00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,980\nTalking to people, so meetings\nkind of come into play there, too.\n\n522\n00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,880\nBut your information management\nsystem also comes into play.\n\n523\n00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,590\nAnd notice this time that this is\nwhere it gets a little tricky.\n\n524\n00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,760\nIt's information management system not\nproject information management system, so\n\n525\n00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,690\nwhat they're talking about here is\n\n526\n00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,330\ninformation management more like your\ne-mails, your collaboration system.\n\n527\n00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,290\nWhatever it is your organization\nuses to communicate with.\n\n528\n00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:15,840\nRight?\n\n529\n00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,860\nThat's your system, that's important.\n\n530\n00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,060\nSo here at ITProTV, we actually,\nwe use Google Apps for all of our stuff.\n\n531\n00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,620\nSo, Google Apps would be out\ninformation management system.\n\n532\n00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,960\nAnd when I wanna send a notification to\none of the other guys here at the show,\n\n533\n00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,250\nI use our Google App system to do that.\n\n534\n00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,120\nSo that's what you're gonna use\nthere as your information system.\n\n535\n00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,460\nDon't confused that with a PMIS.\n\n536\n00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,380\nAll right, and then our outputs,\nmostly it's just document updates, right?\n\n537\n00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,670\nChange requests are what I was alluding\nto a moment ago as people want to modify\n\n538\n00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,940\nthe way they're notified.\n\n539\n00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,430\nYou may not need to do\na change request for that.\n\n540\n00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,690\nIf you're just changing the notifications\nthat somebody receives,\n\n541\n00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,080\nyou may have put an exception in\nyour plan early on to say, yeah,\n\n542\n00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,390\nyou don't have to do a change request.\n\n543\n00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,860\nCuz, why get the change advisory board\ninvolved just to send some more emails?\n\n544\n00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,230\nBut those will lead to updates to\nyour project document, see where you\n\n545\n00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:06,670\ndo your stakeholder register and all that,\nas far as your communications plan.\n\n546\n00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,460\nBut you'll also get some work\nperformance information.\n\n547\n00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,405\nNow this one's odd because normally,\nyou know we do a lot of processing and\n\n548\n00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:13,895\ninterpretation of data.\n\n549\n00:27:13,895 --> 00:27:14,915\nIn this case we really don't.\n\n550\n00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:16,975\nWe've got our work performance data and\n\n551\n00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:19,685\nwork performance information\nis an interpretation of that.\n\n552\n00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,715\nBut we're not really interpreting\nthe data here, right.\n\n553\n00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:25,340\nIt's other parts of monitoring and\ncontrolling that are doing that.\n\n554\n00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,090\nBut we distribute it out, so that gets\nthrown in here as an output also.\n\n555\n00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,880\nBut controlled communications,\nnot really much to it.\n\n556\n00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,820\nWe're just making sure it runs\nlike a well oiled machine and\n\n557\n00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,180\nmaking adjustments as we need to.\n\n558\n00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,380\nNow that leads us to control risk.\n\n559\n00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,330\nControl risk is our next process.\n\n560\n00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,340\nAnd this is another one where,\nif we've done all our planning and\n\n561\n00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,060\nwe've come up with every\npossible risk that there was.\n\n562\n00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,990\nThis process will really just boil\ndown to following out whatever\n\n563\n00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,380\nplans we put in place to handle this risk,\nright?\n\n564\n00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,640\nWith each risk we made a decision.\n\n565\n00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,530\nWe said all right, we are going to\nmitigate the risk and try and reduce it.\n\n566\n00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,360\nWe're going to defer the risk and push it\nonto somebody else, or transfer the risk,\n\n567\n00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,730\nlike buying insurance.\n\n568\n00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,510\nWe're going to accept the risk and\njust let it happen.\n\n569\n00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,050\nRight?\n\n570\n00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,310\nBut we plan for some kind of contingency.\n\n571\n00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,468\nSome kind of reaction to that risk.\n\n572\n00:28:20,468 --> 00:28:25,030\nThe control risk process basically says,\nyou watch the risks, and\n\n573\n00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,240\nif they happen,\nyou take whatever action you planned.\n\n574\n00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,990\nYou make that happen, right?\n\n575\n00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,500\nYou do that activity.\n\n576\n00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,430\nIf you didn't have a plan, if it was\na risk you didn't foresee, control risk is\n\n577\n00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,640\nabout coming up with a solution,\ncoming up with a reaction to that risk.\n\n578\n00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,360\nTo take advantage of it or\nto try and eliminate it, right?\n\n579\n00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,370\nRemember, you've got positive and\nnegative risks.\n\n580\n00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,710\nIt could be a good thing and\nyou want to take advantage of it.\n\n581\n00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,640\nControl risk is where we do that.\n\n582\n00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,360\nAll right.\n\n583\n00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,190\nOur main input here is\ngonna be the risk register.\n\n584\n00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,380\nWe've got our project management plan cuz\nit's got all the information on how we\n\n585\n00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,540\nmanage our risks.\n\n586\n00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,650\nBut the risk register itself is what lists\nthe risks that we need to be watching for,\n\n587\n00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,080\nthat's our monitoring part.\n\n588\n00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,670\nAnd then it lists the actions to take if\nthey occur, that's the controlling part,\n\n589\n00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,450\nright, monitoring and controlling.\n\n590\n00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,880\nSo that risk register is what\nwe're going to be monitoring and\n\n591\n00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,300\nif you don't remember.\n\n592\n00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:22,120\nLet me see if started my risk register\ntemplate, somewhere buried in here.\n\n593\n00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,790\nIt's in my show notes I am sure.\n\n594\n00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,380\nWe talked about our risk register and\nhow they work, and so\n\n595\n00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,230\nif I take a look at the risk register,\nwe come up with the risk ID, probability,\n\n596\n00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,690\nhow it effects things.\n\n597\n00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,970\nAnd then a response.\n\n598\n00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,550\nRight?\n\n599\n00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,190\nSo we just use this as our little chart.\n\n600\n00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,640\nSo we're watching this and saying, okay,\n\n601\n00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,930\nhere's some risks,\nlet me just watch for them.\n\n602\n00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,080\nAnd I'm updating my probabilities\nover time to reflect\n\n603\n00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,070\nwhether that risk is more likely or\nless likely to happen.\n\n604\n00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,720\nIf it does happen, here's my response.\n\n605\n00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,470\nIf we identify a new risk,\nwe're going to have to update this.\n\n606\n00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,010\nWe're going to have to update the risk\nregister to identify that and\n\n607\n00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,430\nwe're going to have to take the response.\n\n608\n00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,705\nSo we might do it after the fact, but\n\n609\n00:30:00,705 --> 00:30:03,686\nit's always better to have a plan\nin place before that happens.\n\n610\n00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:09,570\nAll right, so looking at control risks,\n\n611\n00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,620\nthat's the input side of things, right,\nthe data that we've already got.\n\n612\n00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,950\nThe tools and\ntechniques are pretty straightforward.\n\n613\n00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,350\nRisk assessment, right?\n\n614\n00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,420\nWe need to look at the risks we\nknow about and reassess them.\n\n615\n00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,680\nAnd you need to do it periodically.\n\n616\n00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,090\nI know the example I keep using\nis like an outdoor rock concert\n\n617\n00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,320\nI know there's a chance it could rain.\n\n618\n00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,260\nSix months before the show,\n\n619\n00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,805\nI really don't know what the chance\nof rain is gonna be like.\n\n620\n00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:35,080\nThere's rain season, so I can work\naround that, but that's about it.\n\n621\n00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,820\nAs we get closer and closer though,\nmy data becomes more and more accurate.\n\n622\n00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,250\nSo I might be reassessing\nthat risk every single day.\n\n623\n00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,190\nThe day before the show I might be\nreassessing that risk hour by hour, right?\n\n624\n00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,040\nWe're constantly reassessing the risk to\nfind out what are the odds of increased or\n\n625\n00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,390\ndecreased of that occurring so\nwe can start to mobilize our reaction.\n\n626\n00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,260\nRisk audits are basically the same thing,\nright?\n\n627\n00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,620\nReassessment, we go in and\n\n628\n00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,080\nwe change our various values to\nreflect what's currently there.\n\n629\n00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,330\nA risk audit is where we also try and\n\n630\n00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:10,830\nidentify unforseen risks, risks that\ndidn't make it in the risk register.\n\n631\n00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,510\nIt might be that this was a three\nyear project, and when we did our\n\n632\n00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:19,180\nplanning three years ago, there were\nsome things we just didn't know about.\n\n633\n00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,770\nAnd now, a year and a half has gone by,\nand some new technologies have come out.\n\n634\n00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,010\nThings have changed.\n\n635\n00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,610\nAnd so now we have some new risks.\n\n636\n00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,250\nThey might be good risks,\nrisks that we can take advantage of.\n\n637\n00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:34,330\nSo in our audit we identify those new\nrisks and we get them added to the risk\n\n638\n00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,430\nregister and we come up with a response\nand we get ready to deal with that.\n\n639\n00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,260\nNow it might not result in any\nchange to our actual project.\n\n640\n00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,760\nBut it may, there may be actions\nwe have to take to handle that.\n\n641\n00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,076\n>> Yeah.\nAnd in this risk audit part as well,\n\n642\n00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:51,117\nthe response that we have as we actually\ndo go and deal with some particular risk\n\n643\n00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:55,423\ndata, take a look at what we actually did\nand then gone ahead and reassessing that.\n\n644\n00:31:55,423 --> 00:31:59,649\nOr auditing it and saying, hey, was that\na effective response to something, or\n\n645\n00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:00,279\nwas it not?\n\n646\n00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,316\nNow feeds back into the entire,\nyou know, processing in,\n\n647\n00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:04,911\nin terms of controlling here.\n\n648\n00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:09,681\nAnd, so we not only look at the risk and\nwhat may happen to them also,\n\n649\n00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:13,487\nhow we responded so\nthat we can do it better next time.\n\n650\n00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:16,980\n>> Now with the risk it's\nnot always cut and dry.\n\n651\n00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,810\nI don't always know whether or not it's\ngonna happen, on or off and that's it.\n\n652\n00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:26,020\nSo, I might need to monitor variance and\ntrend analysis, okay?\n\n653\n00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,550\nThere are certain things that\nmight contribute to that risk.\n\n654\n00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,710\nSo, here in the state of Florida,\nwe have hurricanes, or we used to.\n\n655\n00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,420\nIt's been awhile since we had a good one.\n\n656\n00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:40,250\nWe used to get nice, big, super\ndangerous hurricanes every single year,\n\n657\n00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,810\nbut the last like five years\nwe've kind of been without.\n\n658\n00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,770\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n659\n00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:47,360\nSo if we're planning a construction\nproject and we're gonna be doing\n\n660\n00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,010\nconstruction in between the months of July\nand November, that's our hurricane season.\n\n661\n00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,700\nIf I'm doing construction at that time\n\n662\n00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,650\nthere's a really big chance\nthere could be a hurricane.\n\n663\n00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,420\nA hurricane at a minimum will\ncreate a work stoppage, right?\n\n664\n00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,980\nAnd a maximum might cause work to\nbe damaged and have to be redone.\n\n665\n00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,620\nSo it could really derail our project,\nall right?\n\n666\n00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,910\nWell, I don't know if there's going\nto be a hurricane or not, right?\n\n667\n00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,130\nUsually what I do is I watch the Weather\nChannel, and if they say it's gonna be\n\n668\n00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,525\na really active hurricane year,\nI know there won't be any hurricanes.\n\n669\n00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And if they say it's gonna be\n\n670\n00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,065\nan extremely quite hurricane year,\nthen I know we're gonna get some, right?\n\n671\n00:33:22,065 --> 00:33:23,275\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz they are always wrong.\n\n672\n00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:24,990\n[LAUGH] It's consistent.\n\n673\n00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:28,840\nSo you can try that, but for\n\n674\n00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,980\na factual basis, there are certain\nthings that contribute to a hurricane.\n\n675\n00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,880\nIf temperatures are at a certain level,\nif the temperature in the Gulf of Mexico,\n\n676\n00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,890\nthe water in certain temperature, those\nstart to contribute to those hurricanes.\n\n677\n00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,830\nAnd if there's tropical depressions\nforming, around Puerto Rico or Cuba,\n\n678\n00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,840\nor whatever, those are usually gonna turn\ninto hurricanes, they develop into it and\n\n679\n00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,640\nthen hit Florida, so those are things\nthat feed in to that risk, and\n\n680\n00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,240\nso I can watch the trends.\n\n681\n00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,110\nI can watch what's going on to try and\nforesee whether or\n\n682\n00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,920\nnot I'm gonna have a hurricane.\n\n683\n00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,510\nThat's just one example, there's\nother things that can lead to that.\n\n684\n00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,370\nFor example, a strike.\n\n685\n00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,800\nYou might have an employee strike, right?\n\n686\n00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,290\nWell, if there's an employee strike,\nif you have a work stoppage because of\n\n687\n00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,870\na labor dispute, work doesn't get done,\nit derails your project.\n\n688\n00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,520\nThose labor disputes,\nthey don't happen overnight.\n\n689\n00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,490\nIt's not like one day all of\nthe employees just all of the sudden\n\n690\n00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,630\nget unhappy at the same time, and\nthen just decide to go on strike, right?\n\n691\n00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,920\nLabor disputes like that arise\nusually after months, or\n\n692\n00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,950\neven years of increasing tension\nbetween employers and employees.\n\n693\n00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,170\nWe can spot that,\n\n694\n00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:42,080\nyou can monitor the trend of employee\ncomplaints that are filed, right?\n\n695\n00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,550\nOr, request for pay increase,\nor just people quitting.\n\n696\n00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,360\nThe amount of turnover you're having,\nyou can monitor those trends and\n\n697\n00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,800\nsee when you're likely to\nhave that labor dispute.\n\n698\n00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,340\nThey usually are fairly visible,\nyou know when they're coming.\n\n699\n00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,490\nSo especially if you're\nin a union environment,\n\n700\n00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,480\nthe union, they don't hide it,\nthey tell you it's coming.\n\n701\n00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,000\nSo, in a lot of cases\nyou can identify that,\n\n702\n00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,270\nand hopefully come to terms with\nthe situation without a work stoppage.\n\n703\n00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,146\nBut, if there is gonna be a work\nstoppage you have time to plan for\n\n704\n00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:13,563\nit, put in your change tickets,\nand deal with that.\n\n705\n00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:16,064\nThat's a real risk that\nyou may have to address.\n\n706\n00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:20,860\nAll right,\ntechnical performance measurements.\n\n707\n00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,130\nWell, when we're dealing with risks.\n\n708\n00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:28,120\nThings like a weather risk, there's\ntechnical performance measurements.\n\n709\n00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,370\nThings that we can measure\nthere as a result of that or\n\n710\n00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,610\njust technical things\nwithin our own project.\n\n711\n00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,810\nThe word technical there,\nwhat it's supposed to denote,\n\n712\n00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,740\nis something that's usually beyond the\nability of the project manager, that we\n\n713\n00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:44,330\nrely on other people to collect that\ndata to be able to report it back to us.\n\n714\n00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,300\nThis could come from any number of\ndifferent systems, specialized software,\n\n715\n00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,550\nmonitoring equipment.\n\n716\n00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,630\nWe take that data that we get and\nthen make decisions based on it.\n\n717\n00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,220\nThen we've got our reserve analysis,\n\n718\n00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,200\nthat's another great\nway to identify risks.\n\n719\n00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,090\nWe've got risk responses planned, and\n\n720\n00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,730\na lot of our risk responses\nare gonna involve more money.\n\n721\n00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,170\nBut since we don't know if\nthe risk is actually gonna happen,\n\n722\n00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,200\nwe put that money in our reserve, right?\n\n723\n00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,450\nMoney we don't plan on spending\nunless we absolutely have to.\n\n724\n00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,900\nSo, from time to time,\nas we control risks,\n\n725\n00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,070\nwe need to be evaluating our reserve\nto make sure the funds are there.\n\n726\n00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,900\nAnd, we need to be controlling when\nthe funds come out of there, right?\n\n727\n00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,570\nWhen we disperse funds from\nreserve to compensate for a risk.\n\n728\n00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,980\nSo if a thunderstorm is coming, and\nwe know that rock concert's outside, and\n\n729\n00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,690\nwe know we've gotta get those tents.\n\n730\n00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,690\nI need to approve the disbursement\nof how ever many dollars to go to\n\n731\n00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,120\na rental company and\nrent those tents and get them set up.\n\n732\n00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,605\nSo that's part of controlling the risks,\nactually releasing the funds.\n\n733\n00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:41,780\nAnd then lastly, meetings, right?\n\n734\n00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,450\nWhen you have risks,\na lot of times the project manager,\n\n735\n00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,940\nyou don't see that they're coming,\npeople tell you, right?\n\n736\n00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,030\nThe people who are in\nthe field doing the work.\n\n737\n00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,770\nSo we have meetings,\n\n738\n00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,130\nwe discuss the risk, we remind people\nof the risk, cuz sometimes they forget.\n\n739\n00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,220\nWe did all this in planning and\nthat might've been over a year ago.\n\n740\n00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,060\nSo, we remind people of that and\nwe reevaluate our risks.\n\n741\n00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,345\nYeah, that is an ongoing process because\nit doesn't matter how well you plan.\n\n742\n00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:07,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's always some kind of\n\n743\n00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,419\nunforeseen risk that can pop up and\nthen you've gotta be aware.\n\n744\n00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,950\nAll right, on the output side\nwhat do we dump out of this?\n\n745\n00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,420\nWell, it's controlling risks.\n\n746\n00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,500\nSo, your number one result\nof this is really just gonna\n\n747\n00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,300\nbe following the responses\nfrom the risk register.\n\n748\n00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,870\nWhatever a sponsor said, you do it, right?\n\n749\n00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,620\nBut you may have to take actions for\nrisks that weren't planned for or\n\n750\n00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,300\nweren't planned for properly, and\n\n751\n00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,670\nthen you're output is gonna\nbe a change request, right.\n\n752\n00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,620\nWe've got to do a change to try and\naccommodate that risk and\n\n753\n00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:41,860\nkeep us on schedule,\nkeep us on budget and so on, all right.\n\n754\n00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,980\nYou may have work performance information\nthat's being outputted, right, how you've\n\n755\n00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,370\ninterpreted the work performance\ndata in terms of the risks involved.\n\n756\n00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,750\nAnd then we've got our standard updates,\nright?\n\n757\n00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,820\nOur project management plan updates,\nour document updates, and\n\n758\n00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,220\nour organizational process asset updates,\nall of those that come as a result of,\n\n759\n00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,570\npretty much all the monitoring and\ncontrolling processes.\n\n760\n00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,740\nAll right, so\nthat in a nutshell is controlling risks.\n\n761\n00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,680\nOne of the easier ones, because in\ntheory we've already planned for it.\n\n762\n00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,830\n>> Right.\n>> We've already come up with this.\n\n763\n00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,440\nSo, we're really, it really does boil\ndown to just watching your risk register,\n\n764\n00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,665\nwhen one of those happens,\ntake the response.\n\n765\n00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:22,580\nRight, the only time it's really\nchallenging is in your risk register,\n\n766\n00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,420\nyou might have one that\nyou're trying to mitigate,\n\n767\n00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,930\nreduce the instance of it occurring.\n\n768\n00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,120\nAnd, so there might be more than one\naction over time that has to be taken as\n\n769\n00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,560\nyou kind of manipulate environments.\n\n770\n00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,380\nThat can be a little challenging,\nbut most risks aren't like that.\n\n771\n00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,960\nMost of the time, you've got a set\nevent that you're trying to prevent and\n\n772\n00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,130\nmaybe you differ it with insurance or\nsomething like that, but\n\n773\n00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,391\nyou set a plan in motion and that's it.\n\n774\n00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:46,845\nAll right, let's see.\n\n775\n00:38:46,845 --> 00:38:49,280\nRonnie, can you think of\nanything else on risks?\n\n776\n00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,216\nI think that's about it.\n\n777\n00:38:50,216 --> 00:38:51,475\n>> No, I think that's pretty good.\n\n778\n00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:55,580\n>> Yeah, remember, if this is the first\nepisode you're watching, well first off,\n\n779\n00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,730\nit shouldn't be, but it seems like we\ndidn't spend a lot of time on risk.\n\n780\n00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:02,410\nThe main reason is, this is what,\nlike the fourth time we've covered risk.\n\n781\n00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,200\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n782\n00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,350\nif we go back to our process groups,\nyou'll see when it comes to risk,\n\n783\n00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,070\nthe majority of that is done in planning.\n\n784\n00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,180\nYou got a huge amount of risk work done\nback here in the planning process group.\n\n785\n00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,370\nNow, we're just taking our actions,\nall right.\n\n786\n00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,941\nWell, we still have a couple more to go\nthrough with controlling our contracts,\n\n787\n00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:24,514\nour procurements, and\nour stakeholder engagement, but\n\n788\n00:39:24,514 --> 00:39:26,368\nwe'll tackle those maybe after a break.\n\n789\n00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:28,140\nOkay, what do you think, Ronnie?\n>> Okay, sounds good.\n\n790\n00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,337\n>> All right, so let's stop here.\n\n791\n00:39:29,337 --> 00:39:30,753\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n792\n00:39:30,753 --> 00:39:37,301\n[MUSIC]\n\n793\n00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:39,980\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n794\n00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,270\nAll right, our next process\ngroup is control procurements.\n\n795\n00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,990\nWe've talked about procurements already,\nand in my mind,\n\n796\n00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:50,780\nI always change the word procurement to\ncontracts cuz it's usually what it is.\n\n797\n00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,660\nBut technically,\nit's any time you buy something, right?\n\n798\n00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,210\nSo, you may not actually have a contract\nwhen you go to the gas station and\n\n799\n00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,510\nyou pump your tank full of gas.\n\n800\n00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,265\n>> Sure.\n>> But you did a procurement and\n\n801\n00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,512\nit's a very, very short lived contract.\n\n802\n00:40:02,512 --> 00:40:04,564\nIt lasts a matter of minutes.\n\n803\n00:40:04,564 --> 00:40:08,627\nSo controlling procurement is really\njust making those contracts run.\n\n804\n00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:13,160\nYou drafted your contracts back in\nplanning or at least planned for them.\n\n805\n00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,130\nIn executing, you did your RFQs,\nyou got your bidders,\n\n806\n00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,569\nyou selected a seller, you engaged in your\ncontracts and you executed the contracts.\n\n807\n00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,880\nNow, we need to watch those contracts, and\nmake sure that they're being followed.\n\n808\n00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,740\nSo our inputs here\nare Project Management Plan which\n\n809\n00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,580\nhas all of our contract planning or\nprocurement planning.\n\n810\n00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,940\nOur procurement documents,\nwe need the contracts themselves.\n\n811\n00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,320\nWe need to know what we've committed to?\n\n812\n00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,620\nAnd what other people have\ncommitted to do for us?\n\n813\n00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,030\nTo make sure that both sides\nlive up to the agreement.\n\n814\n00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,100\nThat's really important.\n\n815\n00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,732\nWhen you control procurements,\n\n816\n00:40:45,732 --> 00:40:48,888\nyou're not just making sure that\nother people do stuff for you.\n\n817\n00:40:48,888 --> 00:40:51,010\nYou're making sure you do stuff for them.\n\n818\n00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,510\nIf you're bringing in contractors\nto pour the foundation on a house,\n\n819\n00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,750\nthat's what they're gonna do for you.\n\n820\n00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,370\nWhat are you gonna do for them?\n\n821\n00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,140\nPay them on time.\n\n822\n00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,130\nIf they charge you net 60,\nso you have 60 days\n\n823\n00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,870\nafter they perform to pay them the net,\nthe amount of money you owe them.\n\n824\n00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,462\nWell, you need to make sure that happens.\n\n825\n00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:14,407\nThe work is done, we tick it off on our\nlist and say yeah, foundations done,\n\n826\n00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:15,820\nlet's move on.\n\n827\n00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,130\nBut there's still the contract associated\nwith it, we've got to pay out on that.\n\n828\n00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,830\nSo two sides of that is\nvery important to remember.\n\n829\n00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,960\nWe've got any agreements we\nmight have entered into because\n\n830\n00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,710\nsometimes it might not be\nan official legal contract.\n\n831\n00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,390\nBut there was an agreement nonetheless,\n\n832\n00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,740\nmaybe a close partnership with another\ncompany or something that we're gonna deal\n\n833\n00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,840\nwith, we need to make sure we're\naware of those agreements.\n\n834\n00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,050\nAny approved change requests that come in,\n\n835\n00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:44,260\nbecause we might be acting on a contract\nthat has had a change to a clause in it.\n\n836\n00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,900\nWe need to be aware of that information.\n\n837\n00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,760\nAny work performance reports, that's how\nwe're gonna know what work has been done.\n\n838\n00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,370\nAnd the work performance data itself so\nall the status updates that we get.\n\n839\n00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,750\nThose are all the inputs that\nfeed into control procurements.\n\n840\n00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,240\nOn the tools and techniques side\nhere's where we get to work.\n\n841\n00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,990\nAnd remember what our main job here is.\n\n842\n00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,365\nOur main job is to make sure that\nthe procurements are being executed\n\n843\n00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:07,315\nas planned.\n\n844\n00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:10,525\nThat we are following through\nwith all the obligations and\n\n845\n00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:15,695\nthat the other side of the agreement, they\nare also following through with the terms.\n\n846\n00:42:15,695 --> 00:42:17,432\nSo what are some of the things we use?\n\n847\n00:42:17,432 --> 00:42:19,962\nWell there's the contract\nchange control system.\n\n848\n00:42:19,962 --> 00:42:24,690\nWhen you enter to a contract there are\ntimes when you needed to make changes and\n\n849\n00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,593\nthe changes can go either way.\n\n850\n00:42:26,593 --> 00:42:28,903\nMaybe you contracted\na company to come in and\n\n851\n00:42:28,903 --> 00:42:33,087\nlay a foundation the last week of July,\nbut your project starts to get behind and\n\n852\n00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,145\nyou say hey, guys, we're not gonna be\nready for you in the last week of July,\n\n853\n00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:41,120\nbut we don't want to negate the contract,\nstill a good contract.\n\n854\n00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,090\nCan we just move it back a week or two?\n\n855\n00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,515\nAnd if they say yes, no problem we\nhave some openings in the schedule,\n\n856\n00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:48,370\nlet's go ahead and move it no big deal.\n\n857\n00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:51,650\nBoth sides are amicable to the change so\n\n858\n00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,860\nwe go into our contract change control\nsystem and we modify the terms then.\n\n859\n00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:00,430\nNow, there's several different levels of\nchanges that can happen with a contract.\n\n860\n00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:06,030\nSome can be really drastic, like when\nwe negate the contract as a whole.\n\n861\n00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,810\nWhen there's been a violation of the terms\nof the contract or something like that.\n\n862\n00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:12,400\nBut there's also a lot\nthat are just procedural.\n\n863\n00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,390\nMaybe on the contract it has a billing\naddress and it says, we're supposed to\n\n864\n00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:20,940\nsend a monthly payment while the work\nis being done, to this address.\n\n865\n00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,300\nAnd then the other side says,\nwell we're actually moving buildings.\n\n866\n00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,460\nAnd so now, we have a PO Box, so we\nneed you guys to send the payment there.\n\n867\n00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,270\nWe're not changing how\nmuch you've got to pay,\n\n868\n00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,260\nwe're not changing when the work is gonna\nget done, we're not changing what work is\n\n869\n00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,880\ngetting done, we're just changing\nwhere you mail the bill to.\n\n870\n00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,620\nSo that's not a significant change\nto the contract, it's a minor thing.\n\n871\n00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,960\nSo we go in and we update that.\n\n872\n00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,060\nWe need to have a change\ncontrol system for\n\n873\n00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,450\nthe contract but be careful,\nsometimes changes can be really bad.\n\n874\n00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,550\nMaybe the people who are laying\nthe foundation quoted this one price and\n\n875\n00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,980\nas they get to work they say,\nyou know what?\n\n876\n00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,890\nIt's actually gonna be more expensive.\n\n877\n00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,540\nWell, if they can justify why and\nwe understand then we take care of them.\n\n878\n00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,650\nBut it's just more expensive cuz\nthey did a bad quote to win the bid.\n\n879\n00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,600\nThat's their own fault-\n>> Yeah.\n\n880\n00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,070\n>> And you need to say, I'm sorry guys.\n\n881\n00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,370\nYou quoted me this price.\n\n882\n00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,533\nI realize that you guys are having\na problem doing it, but\n\n883\n00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:17,753\nyou shouldn't have bid that\nprice if you couldn't do it.\n\n884\n00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:19,087\nSo get to work.\n\n885\n00:44:19,087 --> 00:44:19,620\nRight?\n\n886\n00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,506\nWe need to make sure that\nwe weigh the pros and\n\n887\n00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:26,736\ncons of all of that when we deal\nwith the changes to the contract.\n\n888\n00:44:26,736 --> 00:44:29,062\nSo that's an important thing and Ronnie,\n\n889\n00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:32,160\nyou added some of this\nstuff into the notes.\n\n890\n00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,960\nIn that contract change control system\nyou have got the paperwork itself,\n\n891\n00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,425\ntracking systems to make sure\nthat things are being done.\n\n892\n00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:41,815\nDispute resolution procedures.\n\n893\n00:44:42,955 --> 00:44:48,185\nThere are times when terms of the contract\ncould be interpreted more than one way.\n\n894\n00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:48,707\nIt shouldn't happen, right?\n\n895\n00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:49,316\n>> Right.\n\n896\n00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:55,380\n>> Contracts should be written in a very\nstraightforward, non-debatable manner.\n\n897\n00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,520\nBut if there is a debate and if there's\na dispute, how do we settle that?\n\n898\n00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,581\nDisputes normally center around\nwhen the contract is done.\n\n899\n00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:06,159\nAnd the one side says, hey we're\nfinished and the other side says no,\n\n900\n00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:07,524\nyou still have this, this and this.\n\n901\n00:45:07,524 --> 00:45:11,720\nAnd the second side says well no,\nactually we did what the contract stated.\n\n902\n00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,580\nThat stuff you're asking for is extra.\n\n903\n00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,280\nNow, we get into a dispute so we need\nto have a dispute resolution procedure.\n\n904\n00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,410\nAnd that needs to be agreed upon\nbefore the contract is executed,\n\n905\n00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,790\nbefore we sign off on it.\n\n906\n00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,740\nSo if that wasn't put in place you\ncan end up having to go to court,\n\n907\n00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,460\nthat does happen.\n\n908\n00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:26,960\n>> Yep.\n\n909\n00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:33,030\n>> And then who has to sign\noff to authorize a change?\n\n910\n00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,020\nAny change to the contract needs\nto be signed off by both parties.\n\n911\n00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,040\nBut who within those parties\nhas the authority to do it?\n\n912\n00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,880\nAs a project manager you may or\nmay not have signing authority for\n\n913\n00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,330\nyour company to enter\ninto binding contracts.\n\n914\n00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,260\nWe see this with government\ncontracts a lot.\n\n915\n00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,331\nSure, you might be the department head for\nyour department but to sign a contract on\n\n916\n00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:54,672\nbehalf of the US government-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n917\n00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:56,400\n>> You might not have that authority.\n\n918\n00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,910\nSo we need to make sure we\nidentify who those people are.\n\n919\n00:45:58,910 --> 00:45:59,660\nSo that we know hey,\n\n920\n00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,820\nchanges can't occur without these people\nbeing involved in that process to make\n\n921\n00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,360\nsure we've got that gatekeeper to make\nsure we're not making bad changes.\n\n922\n00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,970\nThere are a lot of other tools and\n\n923\n00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,690\ntechniques built into\nprocurement management.\n\n924\n00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,150\nThings like our procurement\nperformance reviews.\n\n925\n00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,310\nThis really just kind of\ngoes with monitoring.\n\n926\n00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:24,160\nWhen we sign on somebody for\na contract and\n\n927\n00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,520\nthey say they're gonna lay\na foundation the last week of July,\n\n928\n00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,440\nwe should probably be watching each\nday in July to see what happens.\n\n929\n00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,290\nI remember we moved into this building,\nthe building where the studio is.\n\n930\n00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,980\nWhen we first purchased this building\nthe construction guys were here\n\n931\n00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,220\nevery single day,\nlots of work getting done.\n\n932\n00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,360\nWe saw walls coming up one day and\ndoors going in and things so\n\n933\n00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,920\nthere was a lot of stuff happening.\n\n934\n00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,710\nWe would come by each day and look.\n\n935\n00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,115\nAnd there was one day that we came by and\nthe place was empty.\n\n936\n00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:52,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nobody was here.\n\n937\n00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,640\nAnd the next day we came by and\n\n938\n00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,740\nit was empty, and three days in a row this\nplace was just empty, no work happened.\n\n939\n00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,860\nAnd so we called up the PM and\nwe said hey, what is going on?\n\n940\n00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,030\nNo work is happening and he said,\n\n941\n00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,710\nwell we've got another project going on,\nand it's falling behind.\n\n942\n00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,690\nSo I pulled the guys from your project and\n\n943\n00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,080\nmoved them over there to get\nthat one caught up to speed.\n\n944\n00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,750\nBut that project is finishing so\nwhen it's done,\n\n945\n00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,480\nwe'll take both of those teams and bring\nit back over here to get back up to speed.\n\n946\n00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,655\nNow, at the end of the day that meant\nthat we had three days of inactivity.\n\n947\n00:47:25,655 --> 00:47:28,270\nBut we were still gonna\ncome in at the deadline.\n\n948\n00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,080\nSo we talked about it and\nwe're like that's okay, but\n\n949\n00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,220\nremember you got your\ndeadline you got to meet,\n\n950\n00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,000\nI'm sorry your other project left behind\nbut ours doesn't need to suffer for that.\n\n951\n00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,650\nWell at the end of the day, they brought\nthe extra people back over here and\n\n952\n00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,870\nsure enough, they got done on deadline.\n\n953\n00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,402\nVery much unlike our last building-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n954\n00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:48,392\n>> This building we moved into on time,\n\n955\n00:47:48,392 --> 00:47:51,355\nthe building we used to be in,\nwe were a year and a half-\n\n956\n00:47:51,355 --> 00:47:52,067\n>> Yeah.\n\n957\n00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:52,680\n>> Behind on that one?\n\n958\n00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,921\nThat one was a mess.\n\n959\n00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:56,936\nThere were some permit\nissues with that building.\n\n960\n00:47:56,936 --> 00:47:58,481\nAnd yeah, it was a mess.\n\n961\n00:47:58,481 --> 00:47:59,896\nSo things like that happen and\n\n962\n00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:01,219\nthey need to be addressed-\n>> Right.\n\n963\n00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:03,466\n>> And they need to be\naddressed in a timely manner.\n\n964\n00:48:03,466 --> 00:48:07,354\nI find that often times contract disputes\ncan be resolved if you just talk to\n\n965\n00:48:07,354 --> 00:48:07,854\npeople.\n\n966\n00:48:07,854 --> 00:48:09,317\nOpen your communications.\n\n967\n00:48:09,317 --> 00:48:13,807\nNever assume that the other\nside is thinking one thing.\n\n968\n00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,687\nWhen this place was empty for three days,\nI could have assumed like oh,\n\n969\n00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:17,550\nthey've given up.\n\n970\n00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,290\nThey're just gonna take our money and run.\n\n971\n00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,260\nBut they had all ready made plans.\n\n972\n00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,770\nThey had all ready designed\nto address the issue.\n\n973\n00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,050\nI just needed to know that, right?\n\n974\n00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:29,830\nSo, that's what we deal with\ninspections and audits,\n\n975\n00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,010\nthat's also a part of that, right?\n\n976\n00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,920\nYeah.\nGoing and inspecting the work sites,\n\n977\n00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,530\nauditing what's being done,\n\n978\n00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,440\nensuring that the terms of\nthe contract are being followed.\n\n979\n00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:42,780\nAll right, performance reporting, right,\nfalls right along in that same side.\n\n980\n00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,590\nPerformance reporting is a little bit\ndifferent because what we're doing\n\n981\n00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,760\nis we're measuring their\nperformance against something else.\n\n982\n00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,892\nEither someone else has done\nthe same work before or\n\n983\n00:48:50,892 --> 00:48:53,520\nsome kind of milestones that\nwe've established, they should\n\n984\n00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,513\nhave achieved in each period and\nseeing whether or not they have hit it.\n\n985\n00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:59,190\nSo, have they been\nhitting their milestones?\n\n986\n00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:03,110\nIf they fall behind on one but then they\nmake it up when they jump into the next\n\n987\n00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,380\none, then we're okay, but\nif it's consistent with falling behind\n\n988\n00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,970\nthen we know the end of the contract is\nnot going to finish on time, and if it\n\n989\n00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:14,920\ndeviates enough, you may have grounds\nto terminate the contract early and\n\n990\n00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,010\nsay look, you guys are beyond the point\nwhere you can finish this work on time,\n\n991\n00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,800\nwe need to end this contract,\nwe'll bring somebody else in to finish.\n\n992\n00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,040\nAll right, some of the other things that\nwe have in here are pretty shaped or\n\n993\n00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,890\npayment systems, right?\n\n994\n00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:29,950\nWe need to pay these people.\n\n995\n00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,330\nThey're are coming and doing work for\nus, they need to get compensated,\n\n996\n00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,660\nwe need to pay them.\n\n997\n00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,620\nIf you're one of those Project managers\nthat has ultimate authority, you've\n\n998\n00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,030\ngot control of the bank accounts, and\nyou cut the checks,then great, you do it.\n\n999\n00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:44,050\nMost of the times,\nwe deal with our Accounting department.\n\n1000\n00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,880\nWe have accounts payable and receivable\nand all that stuff that we deal with.\n\n1001\n00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,320\nSo, we reach out to them and\nissue payments.\n\n1002\n00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,680\nWe authorize payment out to our vendors.\n\n1003\n00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,220\nSo that's a payment system, and\n\n1004\n00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,100\nthat's going to be a big part\nof Control Procurements.\n\n1005\n00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,300\nWe need to make sure that\nwe're paying on time, right?\n\n1006\n00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,140\nThese people did work for us, so we need\nto make sure that they're compensated.\n\n1007\n00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,745\nIf they aren't, if we don't pay them in\na timely manner, what are they gonna do?\n\n1008\n00:50:06,745 --> 00:50:08,349\nThey're gonna start working, and\n\n1009\n00:50:08,349 --> 00:50:10,924\nthat means other parts of our\nproject is going to suffer.\n\n1010\n00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:15,230\nAll right, Claims Administration.\n\n1011\n00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,930\nThis is a part that gets overlooked,\nbut it's important.\n\n1012\n00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:23,720\nIn a project where we've got contracts,\nthe contracts are a legal obligation for\n\n1013\n00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,000\nthe parties to do things.\n\n1014\n00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,200\nWe are obligated to pay.\n\n1015\n00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,870\nThey are obligated to do things that\nwe specified in the statement of work.\n\n1016\n00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:34,910\nIf there's ever a dispute, and\nit goes beyond what can be agreed\n\n1017\n00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,420\nto just through speaking,\nwe need a way to handle claims, right?\n\n1018\n00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,570\nActually filing for penalties.\n\n1019\n00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:46,390\nSo, if it's the contractor\nthat is doing the dispute,\n\n1020\n00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:51,180\nwe're not paying them,\nthey may assess penalties and say, well,\n\n1021\n00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:56,330\nyou've gotta pay me 1% interest for\neach day that you don't pay debt, right?\n\n1022\n00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:00,710\nAnd so now, as a penalty on top of it,\nif we continue to resist,\n\n1023\n00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:05,720\nthen they can take it to court and\nsue us for damages and the unpaid amount.\n\n1024\n00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,770\nSo that's all part of\nClaims Administration.\n\n1025\n00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:12,000\nWe need to be watching for that when one\nof our vendors submits a claim to us\n\n1026\n00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,610\nsaying hey, you guys haven't paid us.\n\n1027\n00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,580\nWe need to make sure that gets handled and\nthere needs to be a process for that.\n\n1028\n00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,910\nWhen you have a split responsibilities,\nit's really easy for\n\n1029\n00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,150\na project manager to reach out\nto the accounting department and\n\n1030\n00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,900\nsay hey,\nI need you guys to pay this bill here.\n\n1031\n00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,230\nTake it, it's authorized by me.\n\n1032\n00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,070\nI sign off on it, all right?\n\n1033\n00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:29,550\nBut, what if we don't follow up?\n\n1034\n00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,050\nWe\n>> Yeah.\n\n1035\n00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,770\n>> assume that person in accounting is\n\n1036\n00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,450\ngoing to pay that bill, but did they?\n\n1037\n00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,550\nWe need to follow up.\n\n1038\n00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,920\nWe need to do that as part of\nour Claims Administration.\n\n1039\n00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,940\nWe need to go and check, wait a few\ndays or a week and you go back and say,\n\n1040\n00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,650\nokay, Ddd you actually\nsend out that payment?\n\n1041\n00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:46,400\nI need you to give me a photocopy of the\ncheck whenever you send a check out for\n\n1042\n00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,170\none of these things,\nthat way I can add it to my records so\n\n1043\n00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,230\nI know that it was actually done.\n\n1044\n00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:53,050\nAnd I need to know what date it was\nmailed out so I have a record of that.\n\n1045\n00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:57,270\nOr maybe you wanna send it as a registered\nmail, something with a tracking number.\n\n1046\n00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,120\nAgain, same thing, just so you can\nshow that it was actually delivered.\n\n1047\n00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,050\nThis is all part of follow through to make\nsure we don't get to that point where we\n\n1048\n00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:03,960\nhave to deal with claims.\n\n1049\n00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,850\nAnd then our Records Management System\nis extremely important.\n\n1050\n00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,460\nYou should be recording every expense\nthroughout your project, every contract\n\n1051\n00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,880\nwithin your project and that's because\nwe need to make sure it's terminated.\n\n1052\n00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,920\nWe're going to talk about the closing\nprocess in the next episode, and\n\n1053\n00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:25,580\na part of that is making sure that all of\nour contracts are completely resolved,\n\n1054\n00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:30,340\nthat all of the liabilities and\nrequirements inside of the contract have\n\n1055\n00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:34,070\nbeen addressed, and that it's over, and\nthat both sides agree that it's closed.\n\n1056\n00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:35,940\nWell, your\nRecords Management System is what\n\n1057\n00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,720\ngives us the information to show that.\n\n1058\n00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,370\nWe see that all the work has been done,\n\n1059\n00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:42,680\nwe see that all the bills have been paid,\ncontract is over, right?\n\n1060\n00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,260\nWe wouldn't know that unless\nwe had our paper trail.\n\n1061\n00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,170\nAnd if there's a dispute,\nif we've send out a payment and\n\n1062\n00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,400\nthey say, you guys are late.\n\n1063\n00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,480\nYou didn't pay us.\n\n1064\n00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,900\nWe can say, well,\nhere's the wire transfer information,\n\n1065\n00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,460\nI've got it right here,\nit was sent, your bank accepted it.\n\n1066\n00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,980\nWell, what's the deal?\n\n1067\n00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,990\nOr we got a cancelled check back that\nshows you guys cashed the check and\n\n1068\n00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,110\nyou're gonna tell us you didn't get paid?\n\n1069\n00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,880\nWe've got that paperwork.\n\n1070\n00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,650\nOtherwise we just have to act on faith.\n\n1071\n00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:07,870\nAll right, I guess we didn't pay you,\nlet's go cut a second check.\n\n1072\n00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:09,889\nThere we start to have some problems.\n\n1073\n00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:14,020\nAlright, so\nthat's what an RMS provides in control.\n\n1074\n00:53:15,772 --> 00:53:17,680\nAll right,\nthe last parts here are just our Outputs.\n\n1075\n00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,910\nOur outputs, hopefully, are not much,\nit's just executing the contract, right?\n\n1076\n00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:25,840\nSo our output really should\njust be payment paperwork, so\n\n1077\n00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,150\nthat's going to be part of our\nproject document update and so on.\n\n1078\n00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,440\nBut there may be other things our\nwork performance information, right?\n\n1079\n00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,640\nWe're showing that parts of that\ncontract have been resolved,\n\n1080\n00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,420\nthat they've been done.\n\n1081\n00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,540\nSo, we're showing that\nperformance information.\n\n1082\n00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,870\nWe've got our change request in the event\nthat any modifications happen from our\n\n1083\n00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:44,040\nContract Change Control System.\n\n1084\n00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,640\nThen, it just updates to our regular\ndocuments, like we've seen in darn near\n\n1085\n00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,360\nevery [LAUGH] process here in\nmonitoring and controlling.\n\n1086\n00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,430\n>> Remember that for\nus here in procurement, right?\n\n1087\n00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:58,460\nThe reason that we don't want to be,\nmake sure that we're actually on top of\n\n1088\n00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,610\neverything here, is because it is a legal\nrequirement that we are fulfilling.\n\n1089\n00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:06,080\nNot only to our contractors but\nthey're fulfilling to us and so\n\n1090\n00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,240\nyou just making quick changes and\ndeciding that, hey,\n\n1091\n00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,210\nthings are going to go this\nway instead of that way.\n\n1092\n00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,830\nIt can lead to more\ndamage than you realize.\n\n1093\n00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,140\nSo, make sure you are on top of this.\n\n1094\n00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,020\nMake sure you're actually fulfilling\nthose obligations that you need to.\n\n1095\n00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,107\nThis is where we ask you to control that.\n\n1096\n00:54:19,107 --> 00:54:20,163\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1097\n00:54:20,163 --> 00:54:21,453\nAll right.\n\n1098\n00:54:21,453 --> 00:54:23,905\nNow, the last process we\nhave in Monitoring and\n\n1099\n00:54:23,905 --> 00:54:26,799\nControlling is\nControlling Stakeholder Engagement.\n\n1100\n00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,280\nAnd this is simply keeping\nan eye on our stakeholders and\n\n1101\n00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,410\nhow they're interacting with our project.\n\n1102\n00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,390\nThe number one way we do this\nis through communications.\n\n1103\n00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,330\nWe've already talked about communications.\n\n1104\n00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:41,800\nBut, what about when there's a change,\nwhen they want more information, or\n\n1105\n00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,370\nwhen they want to modify the project and\nwe're typically talking about our\n\n1106\n00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,860\nsponsor here, our key stakeholder that\nwe're trying to manage with them.\n\n1107\n00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,550\nBut it could be any of our\nstakeholders for that matter.\n\n1108\n00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:56,310\nNow a lot of this we've already addressed\nin our Project Management Plan,\n\n1109\n00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,755\nwe've got information [INAUDIBLE] that\nstates how each of our stakeholders needs\n\n1110\n00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:00,785\nto be handled.\n\n1111\n00:55:00,785 --> 00:55:03,655\nWhether they are risk averse or\nwhatever, you know?\n\n1112\n00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:06,335\nAll that stuff that we kind of set\nup way back in the planning phase.\n\n1113\n00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:09,785\nSo, that's one of our key inputs\nis to get that information.\n\n1114\n00:55:09,785 --> 00:55:14,735\nOur issue log, if any of our\nstakeholders has an issue, a request,\n\n1115\n00:55:14,735 --> 00:55:18,810\nit's usually gonna go in the issue log\nfirst, and so that's our next input.\n\n1116\n00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,330\nOur work performance data and\nour project documents, right,\n\n1117\n00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,610\nall standard stuff to bring in for inputs.\n\n1118\n00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,150\nNow, what we do from there\nis kind of up to us.\n\n1119\n00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,480\nIt depends on which stakeholder\nit is that we're addressing and\n\n1120\n00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,410\nwhat their main grievance is.\n\n1121\n00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,020\nOur main thing is just our\nInformation Management System, right?\n\n1122\n00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,210\nThis is normally dealing\nwith Communications.\n\n1123\n00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,940\nThey want the information\nwe need to provide it.\n\n1124\n00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,940\nWe've already got\na communication management plan,\n\n1125\n00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,980\nI mean a control communications process,\n\n1126\n00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,510\nso why do we need a control stakeholder\nengagement, what if it's the same.\n\n1127\n00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:52,890\nWell, this is really talking\nabout one off requests.\n\n1128\n00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:56,872\nIt is not uncommon for\nyour project sponsor to come down and say,\n\n1129\n00:55:56,872 --> 00:56:00,063\ncan you give me a report for\nthis, this, and this?\n\n1130\n00:56:00,063 --> 00:56:02,828\nAnd it's not something we established\nin our communications plan, and\n\n1131\n00:56:02,828 --> 00:56:05,924\nis not even something we're going to do\nagain, it's more like a one time thing.\n\n1132\n00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:06,752\nThis one time,\n\n1133\n00:56:06,752 --> 00:56:10,515\nthey need to get this particular\nreport that shows some information.\n\n1134\n00:56:10,515 --> 00:56:14,020\nBut we get it here at\nIT pro tv all the time.\n\n1135\n00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,610\nTim one of the gentlemen\nhere at the office.\n\n1136\n00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:19,650\nHe'll come back and he'll want some\nkind of utilization numbers like,\n\n1137\n00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:22,640\nhey can you guys generate some\nkind of report that shows how many\n\n1138\n00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,250\npeople are viewing the site from\ninternet explorer eight, right?\n\n1139\n00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,824\nWhich is one of our banes.\n\n1140\n00:56:27,824 --> 00:56:30,530\n[LAUGH] So then we go and\nwe generate a report on that, and\n\n1141\n00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,180\nit's not something we normally do,\nwe don't normally worry about that,\n\n1142\n00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,900\nbut that one time we need that report for\nit, right?\n\n1143\n00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,050\nSo the control stakeholder engagement\nprocess is really designed for\n\n1144\n00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:42,260\nthose situations, where we go,\nand we gather that data.\n\n1145\n00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,490\nWe don't want to tell them no,\nno, that's not in the plan,\n\n1146\n00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,850\nI'm not gonna make that report,\nforget you, right?\n\n1147\n00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,950\nYou wanna [LAUGH] take\ncare of your stakeholders.\n\n1148\n00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:50,830\nSo you wanna give them that information.\n\n1149\n00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:53,530\nBut you shouldn't have to go and\ndo a bunch of change tickets and so\n\n1150\n00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:54,870\non just to provide that.\n\n1151\n00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,090\nEspecially if it's just\nsimple report gathering.\n\n1152\n00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,200\nSo that's where this process comes from.\n\n1153\n00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,600\nWe have our information management system,\nwe gather our data,\n\n1154\n00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,290\nwe distribute it using email, whatever.\n\n1155\n00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:08,370\nWe use our expert judgement to get the\ninformation we're looking for and we may\n\n1156\n00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:12,720\nneed to use meetings to gather people\ntogether again, to get that information.\n\n1157\n00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,890\nWe wanna make sure this is done in\na way that doesn't derail the project.\n\n1158\n00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:17,980\nBut if it is.\n\n1159\n00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,360\nIf it's a big report,\nit's gonna cost money.\n\n1160\n00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,630\nIt's gonna take more time then\nthat's where one of our outputs\n\n1161\n00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:24,427\nis a change request, right?\n\n1162\n00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,435\nIn order to do what they're asking,\nif we can do it within the means\n\n1163\n00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:32,405\nof our project without derailing\nanything we should do it.\n\n1164\n00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:37,165\nTake care of your stakeholders because\nthey're the reason you have a job, but\n\n1165\n00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:39,405\nif it's going to require extra money,\nextra effort,\n\n1166\n00:57:39,405 --> 00:57:41,915\nextra resources,\nyou've got to do a change ticket.\n\n1167\n00:57:41,915 --> 00:57:44,972\nIf they they want that they've\ngot to be willing to pay for it.\n\n1168\n00:57:44,972 --> 00:57:47,902\nThey are going to pay for\nit in terms of either out right money,\n\n1169\n00:57:47,902 --> 00:57:52,972\nit is going to cost more on the budget or\nour other ones, time, it is going to take\n\n1170\n00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:56,782\nlonger to complete the project because\nof this information they've requested.\n\n1171\n00:57:56,782 --> 00:57:59,772\nOr thirdly, we might have to\neliminate some requirements.\n\n1172\n00:57:59,772 --> 00:58:02,662\nBump a few requirements often make\ntime to generate this additional\n\n1173\n00:58:02,662 --> 00:58:04,942\ninformation they are asking for.\n\n1174\n00:58:04,942 --> 00:58:06,759\nAll three of those would\nresult in change requests.\n\n1175\n00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:11,010\nBut typically it's just work performance\ninformation they're looking for, so\n\n1176\n00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,180\nwe generate that data and\nwe give it to them.\n\n1177\n00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,660\nThere might be updates or\nother documentation updates to show that.\n\n1178\n00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,050\nAt a minimum, you wanna put\nan entry in issue log that says\n\n1179\n00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,260\nthis is something that they requested,\nso that was one of our inputs.\n\n1180\n00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,090\nBut, going forward, you also want\nto keep track of that report.\n\n1181\n00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:31,100\nIf they say, we want this report all\nof the time, not just this week, but\n\n1182\n00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,260\nlet's do it for the rest of the project.\n\n1183\n00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,060\nFrom now on,\nI want to get this report every week.\n\n1184\n00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,220\nWell, then, we've got to go and\n\n1185\n00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,470\nupdate our communications\nmanagement plan and all of those.\n\n1186\n00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,780\nTo show this new report, who should\nget it, how they should get it, and\n\n1187\n00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,910\nall of that information.\n\n1188\n00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,050\nJust remember for the exam that this\nprocess, this control stakeholder\n\n1189\n00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:51,050\nengagement, really similar to\ncontrol communications, right.\n\n1190\n00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,220\nIn fact, if I flip between them,\n\n1191\n00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,590\nyou'll notice there's only a few\nlittle changes between the two.\n\n1192\n00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,570\nThe Tools & Techniques and\nOutputs are actually identical.\n\n1193\n00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,430\nThe inputs.\n\n1194\n00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:01,430\nActually the inputs\nare a little bit different.\n\n1195\n00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,330\nWe've got our project\ncommunications there.\n\n1196\n00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:05,940\nBut they're almost identical.\n\n1197\n00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,550\nThe stakeholder and\nvarious engagement is really designed for\n\n1198\n00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:11,450\nthose one off times where that\nstakeholder comes to you looking for\n\n1199\n00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,360\ninformation or\nother data about the project.\n\n1200\n00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,640\nAnd you're interacting with them.\n\n1201\n00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,639\nSo that's what this\nprocess is geared towards.\n\n1202\n00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,240\n>> Yep.\n\n1203\n00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,340\n>> Well with those,\n\n1204\n00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:27,580\nwe've now seen the processes involved in\nthe monitoring and controlling phase.\n\n1205\n00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,890\nMost, whoops as I just\njump all over the place.\n\n1206\n00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,730\nMost of those are pretty common sense.\n\n1207\n00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:36,220\nWe don't have to be a rocket\nscientist to figure those out.\n\n1208\n00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,140\nBut you'll remember\nthe control schedule and\n\n1209\n00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,430\ncontrol costs, those are the ones\nthat we did earned value management.\n\n1210\n00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:43,560\nThose were pretty hard, right?\n\n1211\n00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,730\nA lot of stuff to be said in there.\n\n1212\n00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:46,450\nBut the rest of them,\n\n1213\n00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,770\nfor the most part we're just executing\nwhat was set forth in our plan.\n\n1214\n00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,840\nAll right, so\nthat's a pretty good spot to wrap it up.\n\n1215\n00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,730\nRonnie, can you think of\nanything else to throw in?\n\n1216\n00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:56,280\n>> Nope.\n\n1217\n00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,660\nYeah.\n>> All right.\n\n1218\n00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,250\nNow we still have our closing process that\nwe're gonna tackle in the next episode.\n\n1219\n01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,680\nBut for right now, we'll wrap this one up.\n\n1220\n01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,040\nI do wanna remind you guys,\n\n1221\n01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,660\nif you have questions on any of this,\nfeel free to ask.\n\n1222\n01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,710\nLive during the show you\ncan go to

00:00:14.755\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:18.201\nAnd today we're taking a look\nProject Management Professional and\n\n5\n00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:21.010\nhere to help us, Mr.\nDon Pezet, how's it going?\n\n6\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.020\n>> It is going great, Ronnie.\n\n7\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.040\nI'm glad to be back on the show.\n\n8\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.860\nI'm ready to jump into the world\nof project management.\n\n9\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.930\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at Process Analysis.\n\n10\n00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.295\nAnd this is kind of one of those\nfunny topics where in the past,\n\n11\n00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:36.230\nwe usually leave this one\nout of project management.\n\n12\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.740\nBecause, inside of the [COUGH] project\nmanagement world, we're really concerned\n\n13\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.200\nwith moving the project forward, creating\nthose deliverables, hitting our goals.\n\n14\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.920\nAnd wrapping the project up on time,\non budget, and\n\n15\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.150\nmeeting everybody's requirements.\n\n16\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.380\nBut there's ongoing activities\nthat happen inside of our company.\n\n17\n00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.140\nThings that our company does over,\nand over, and over again.\n\n18\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.170\nAnd there's processes that are a part\nof those ongoing activities and\n\n19\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.880\nthey can be improved or\ncorrected, made more efficient.\n\n20\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.390\nAnd that's a real thing, something\nthat happens inside of organizations.\n\n21\n00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.710\nBut we don't normally deal with it in\nterms of a project, because remember our\n\n22\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.420\ndefinition of a project way back probably\nin episode of one in this series.\n\n23\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.850\nWe said, a project is something that\nhas a well defined start and finish.\n\n24\n00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.370\nRight?\n\n25\n00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.663\nThat a project is not something\nthat just rambles on and on and\n\n26\n00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:28.027\non without definition.\n\n27\n00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:31.742\nThat you have a well defined beginning and\nend.\n\n28\n00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:33.953\nAnd you got a set of requirements\nthat you need to meet, and\n\n29\n00:01:33.953 --> 00:01:36.485\nif you meet those requirements then\nyour project is successful and\n\n30\n00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:38.356\nif you don't meet those\nrequirements you fail.\n\n31\n00:01:38.356 --> 00:01:39.310\nRight?\n\n32\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.120\nSo an ongoing activity, that's kind\nof outside of the ramble project, so\n\n33\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.110\nwhy are we bothering\nto talk about it here?\n\n34\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.800\nWell, in every single\nepisode we've covered so\n\n35\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.270\nfar we've talked about processes.\n\n36\n00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.810\nRight?\n\n37\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.060\nAnd each process had inputs, had tools and\n\n38\n00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.260\ntechniques that we applied to those\ninputs to then create outputs,\n\n39\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.800\nwhich all hopefully led to\nthe completion of our project.\n\n40\n00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.946\nRight?\nAt a minimum,\n\n41\n00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:06.043\nthey created information we can\nuse to measure our project.\n\n42\n00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:09.320\nBut hopefully they created deliverables,\nthey then combined like a Lego kit and\n\n43\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.354\nall of a sudden you end up\nwith this giant product.\n\n44\n00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:14.630\nAll right, so that's what we hope to have.\n\n45\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.060\nNow those processes,\nthose are being done over and over and\n\n46\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.550\nover again throughout\nall of your projects.\n\n47\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.480\nAnd so there's areas that can be improved\nthere, there's areas that can be\n\n48\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.610\ntweaked and adjusted and\nthat maybe part of our project.\n\n49\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.090\nOr it might be our project\nto find areas to improve.\n\n50\n00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.880\nAnd so this is one of those areas where\nprocesses analysis is not normally\n\n51\n00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.170\na project management concept but\ncan be a part of project management.\n\n52\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.190\nAnd so\nwe need to have an understanding of that.\n\n53\n00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.950\nNow the PMI,\n\n54\n00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.530\nthe Project Management Institute didn't\nreally harp on this much in the past.\n\n55\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.070\nBut starting with their\nJanuary 2016 update,\n\n56\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.140\nthey're really putting a little bit\nmore of an emphasis on process analysis.\n\n57\n00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.725\nSo it's a good idea to have at\nleast a foundational understanding\n\n58\n00:02:58.725 --> 00:03:00.475\nof what process analysis is.\n\n59\n00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:03.435\nYou as a project manager will\nlikely not have to do this.\n\n60\n00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:05.635\nBut you need to be familiar\nwith what it is, so\n\n61\n00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:07.745\nyou can get the right\npeople to make them do it.\n\n62\n00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:11.145\nAnd actually have this be successful and\nkeep your company running smoothly.\n\n63\n00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:12.165\nAll right?\n\n64\n00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:13.375\nSo that's what we're\ngonna do in this episode,\n\n65\n00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:16.975\nwe're gonna take a look at some of those\ndifferent methodologies or schools of\n\n66\n00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:21.290\nthought on process analysis, what can we\ndo, what can we do to improve things.\n\n67\n00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.807\nAnd how that kinda gets\nrolled into a project.\n\n68\n00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:27.517\n>> Now Don, I understand that we might\nactually choose as an individual company\n\n69\n00:03:27.517 --> 00:03:28.324\nto do it our way.\n\n70\n00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:31.616\nBut there are some different\nmethodologies that have been tried and\n\n71\n00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:34.848\ntrue that really do help,\nwell just about everything that you do,\n\n72\n00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:37.634\nespecially project related and\nthose ongoing process.\n\n73\n00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:41.875\nAnd there’s really three main\nmethodologies that we do need to focus on.\n\n74\n00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:44.420\nSo Don, the first one,\nI’ve heard about it.\n\n75\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.580\nI've heard all different things about it,\nI still don't know much about it itself.\n\n76\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.000\nIt's one that we call Six Sigma.\n\n77\n00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.158\nSo, it's even harder for me to say.\n\n78\n00:03:52.158 --> 00:03:54.301\n>> I get a lot of\nquestions about Six Sigma,\n\n79\n00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:58.272\nviewers like you out there where they\nwill send me an e-mail and say, Don,\n\n80\n00:03:58.272 --> 00:04:01.252\nI'm thinking about getting\ninto Project Management.\n\n81\n00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:06.750\nShould I do PNP or should I do like\nSix Sigma green belt or something.\n\n82\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.110\nAnd I kind of look at and I'm like\nwell all right here is a person who\n\n83\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.870\nhasn't used Google and [LAUGH] to find out\nthat they're really two different things.\n\n84\n00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.384\nRight?\nProject management is one thing and\n\n85\n00:04:17.384 --> 00:04:21.462\nprocess improvement or Six Sigma for\nthat matter is a different thing.\n\n86\n00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:22.715\nThey have different purposes.\n\n87\n00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:23.528\nRight?\n\n88\n00:04:23.528 --> 00:04:27.634\nWhat Six Sigma looks to do is it\nlooks to improve processes to make\n\n89\n00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.610\nthem more efficient and\nto create less waste.\n\n90\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.096\nRight?\nLess defects.\n\n91\n00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:34.630\nRight?\nIt all boils down to defects.\n\n92\n00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.180\nRemember that a lot of this\nstuff didn't originate in\n\n93\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.160\nIT departments like what we do.\n\n94\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.330\nIt originated in manufacturing.\n\n95\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.330\nFactory floors.\n\n96\n00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.910\nRight?\n\n97\n00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.930\nSix Sigma came out of Motorola.\n\n98\n00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.350\nNow, Motorola, if you're familiar\nwith them, they make cellphones,\n\n99\n00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.820\nthey make all sorts of electronic devices,\nthey do a ton of stuff.\n\n100\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.040\nAnd when you make electronic\ndevices they actually build it\n\n101\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.325\ninto their process that some of\nthe devices they make are gonna be broken.\n\n102\n00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:01.550\nRight?\nSo if they make 100 cellphones,\n\n103\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.040\nthey may know that just through\na part of manufacturing\n\n104\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.060\nfive of those phones are gonna be broken.\n\n105\n00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.370\nAnd then when they build it out,\n\n106\n00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.160\nif they need 1000 phones they don't just\ndo ten runs of 100, they do 11 runs.\n\n107\n00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.470\nBecause they know they're\ngonna lose five with each run,\n\n108\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.220\nso that's 50 total that they lose.\n\n109\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.380\nThey need one extra run to be able to\nget the extra phones to meet their need.\n\n110\n00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.030\nRight?\n\n111\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.130\nThey do that to meet their goal.\n\n112\n00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.700\nNow, they could just stop right there and\nsay, well,\n\n113\n00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.910\nthat's the cost of doing business.\n\n114\n00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.760\nWe lose five out of 100, that's just it.\n\n115\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.180\nBut, if we look at it.\n\n116\n00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.490\nRight?\nWe start to find the problems,\n\n117\n00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.630\ntry and find the defect,\n\n118\n00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.960\nwhy are those five failing,\nwe might be able to find some solutions.\n\n119\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.040\nAnd we did talk about that in some of\nour other episodes where we did some\n\n120\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.850\nof the risk analysis.\n\n121\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.200\nReally cuz it's a type of risk.\n\n122\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.940\nBut we talked about continual process\nimprovement, and ways to do the cause and\n\n123\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.065\neffect model,\nto say five phones failed, why?\n\n124\n00:05:58.065 --> 00:05:59.554\nRight?\nWhat caused it?\n\n125\n00:05:59.554 --> 00:06:02.851\nAnd it maybe more than one thing,\nand so you can do a Pareto diagram.\n\n126\n00:06:02.851 --> 00:06:03.965\nWe saw those too.\n\n127\n00:06:03.965 --> 00:06:07.304\nAnd we talked about how we can isolate,\nwhich one is the primary cause and\n\n128\n00:06:07.304 --> 00:06:08.800\nsee if we can fix it.\n\n129\n00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.930\nAnd when something is a defect,\nthere are different levels of defect.\n\n130\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.450\nRight?\n\n131\n00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.940\nIt could be that it is\ncompletely unfit for use and\n\n132\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.115\nit just has to go in the trash,\nand that's that.\n\n133\n00:06:17.115 --> 00:06:17.800\nRight?\n\n134\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.440\nBut sometimes they can be repaired, and\nthe repair might even be really simple.\n\n135\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.441\nIf the repair is simple,\nit might be worth it for us to do it.\n\n136\n00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:25.833\nIf the repair is complex,\n\n137\n00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:29.138\nthe cost to repair it maybe more\nthan just making another one.\n\n138\n00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:32.147\nAnd that's when we just accept that\ndevice has failed and that's the end,\n\n139\n00:06:32.147 --> 00:06:32.876\nwe throw it away.\n\n140\n00:06:32.876 --> 00:06:33.840\nRight?\n\n141\n00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.660\nSo somebody has to make that judgement.\n\n142\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.590\nSomebody has to evaluate it and\nit's normally engineers.\n\n143\n00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.740\nIt's normally the people that are building\nthis equipment that are building\n\n144\n00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.690\nthe process line, not the project manager.\n\n145\n00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.120\nBut we need to be aware of it because\nsomebody may have told us, yeah,\n\n146\n00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.958\nit's just how it is.\n\n147\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.910\nWe lose five for every 100 we make,\nthat's just how it is.\n\n148\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.400\nWell, okay, I'll grant you that.\n\n149\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.450\nThat may be how it is, but\nit isn't necessarily how it has to be.\n\n150\n00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.560\nRight?\nMaybe we could make it better.\n\n151\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.200\nAnd if I can improve that yield,\nnot only am I gonna be more efficient,\n\n152\n00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.230\nbut we can get things done faster.\n\n153\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.340\nIt can help my schedule\nas well as my budget.\n\n154\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.210\nSo, for a project manager that's valuable.\n\n155\n00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.870\nRight?\n\n156\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.590\nSo, at Motorola the gentleman\nwho came up with it,\n\n157\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.821\nthe most generic name in the planet.\n\n158\n00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:16.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Bill Smith,\n\n159\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.190\nI guess it could be John Doe,\nbut Bill Smith.\n\n160\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.340\nHe created this back in the 1980s.\n\n161\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.560\nAnd what it was was just a process\nused for monitoring production.\n\n162\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.870\nAnd it's really designed for\na factory floor.\n\n163\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.570\nRight?\nIndustry,\n\n164\n00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.460\nwhere you're actually\nmaking a tangible good.\n\n165\n00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.060\nBut you can do this in IT or project\nmanagement, where it is a soft skill.\n\n166\n00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.900\nRight?\nThis could be\n\n167\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.470\nthings like looking at\nyour help desk calls.\n\n168\n00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.770\nAnd you could measure defects based\non customer satisfaction scores.\n\n169\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.564\nAt the end of a help desk call, you ask\nwhoever called in to do a survey and\n\n170\n00:07:46.564 --> 00:07:48.921\nrank the experience on\na scale of one to ten.\n\n171\n00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:52.176\nAnd you can say look, we're trying to\ncreate an eight to ten experience.\n\n172\n00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:55.819\nAnd if somebody says they had a seven or\nlower, that's a defect.\n\n173\n00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:59.851\nAnd do we have an acceptable level for\nthat, that we're okay with or\n\n174\n00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:01.940\ndo we need to get that up higher?\n\n175\n00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.140\nSo it doesn't have to be a tangible item\nand that's where Six Sigma gets really\n\n176\n00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.820\nweird, cuz it was designed for\nindustry and now people are applying it in\n\n177\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.340\nall sorts of different places, and\nit becomes really, really powerful.\n\n178\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.220\nNow, the name Six Sigma.\n\n179\n00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.950\nWhat it actually derives from is\nsigma is a statistics term and\n\n180\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.880\nit means a standard deviation.\n\n181\n00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.640\nSo when they say Six Sigma,\nMotorola had this target back in the day,\n\n182\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.210\nthat they wanted to make\nsure they stayed within\n\n183\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.890\nsix standard deviations of\nwhat was considered perfect.\n\n184\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.560\nSo you could get a little\nbit off of perfect and\n\n185\n00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.720\nstill have an item that was sellable.\n\n186\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.444\nThat still fit its need,\nfulfilled its purpose.\n\n187\n00:08:39.444 --> 00:08:42.513\nRemember your warranties,\nyou gotta be fit for use and\n\n188\n00:08:42.513 --> 00:08:44.790\nfit for purpose and all that good stuff.\n\n189\n00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.890\nSo that's basically what we see with Six\nSigma and that's where that name cam from.\n\n190\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.630\nNow, they don't actually shoot for\nSix Sigma.\n\n191\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.913\nThey shoot for something like 4.5 sigma's-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n192\n00:08:53.913 --> 00:08:55.080\n>> Or something.\n\n193\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.020\n>> But that was the name.\n\n194\n00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.550\nI'm not quite sure why\nthey switched that one up.\n\n195\n00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.430\nI guess that maybe they just\ngot more efficient over time.\n\n196\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.890\nBut basically, it's a pretty lofty goal.\n\n197\n00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.180\nTheir goal originally was something,\nI gotta try and remember this.\n\n198\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:14.070\nIt was something like 3.4 defects for\nevery 1 million possibilities of defect.\n\n199\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.650\nRight now, when you produce one\ncellphone there are thousands of\n\n200\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.980\npossible places, possible opportunities\nfor defect in that phone.\n\n201\n00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:28.110\nSo to produce a valid phone, that could be\na thousand successes in that one phone.\n\n202\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.550\nIt could be 10,000 successes.\n\n203\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.486\nSo when they say 3.4 defects per million\nopportunities, it doesn't mean they made\n\n204\n00:09:34.486 --> 00:09:38.422\na million devices but it means that\nit could be a much smaller number.\n\n205\n00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:40.920\nBut that was kind of what they\nwere shooting for back then.\n\n206\n00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.350\nWhen you apply it it\ndoesn't necessarily matter.\n\n207\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.580\nWhen you apply it what really\nmatters is the process, and\n\n208\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.600\nthis all goes back to Deming.\n\n209\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.760\nI know we mentioned Deming in other shows.\n\n210\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.304\nBut he's got that whole plan,\ndo, check, act methodology.\n\n211\n00:09:55.304 --> 00:09:57.410\nPlan, we plan what we're gonna do.\n\n212\n00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.751\nWe figure out how we're\ngonna run through it.\n\n213\n00:09:58.751 --> 00:10:00.190\nWe plan our project.\n\n214\n00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.460\nWe do, we execute.\n\n215\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.660\nWe actually perform\nwhatever that action is.\n\n216\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.830\nCheck, we evaluate the results.\n\n217\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.000\nDid it work the way that we planned it or\ndo not match up with a plan?\n\n218\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.510\nIf it matched what we planned perfectly\nto perfection then we move on,\n\n219\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.350\nthen we're done.\n\n220\n00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.070\nBut if it didn't match,\nif it was too good or too bad.\n\n221\n00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.970\nRemember like any risk\nthere's good risk and\n\n222\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.230\nbad risk so it could be too good,\nwhy was it too good?\n\n223\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.840\nLet's find out, and then we act.\n\n224\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.910\nWe make any changes necessary to get\nthings back in line with our plan.\n\n225\n00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.320\nPlan, do, check, act.\n\n226\n00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.070\nVery old methodology there.\n\n227\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.640\nThat's Deming's kinda key analysis.\n\n228\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.632\nSo what Bill Smith did, is he took that\nand he just modified it a little bit.\n\n229\n00:10:40.632 --> 00:10:42.850\nAnd it's implemented in five steps.\n\n230\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.630\nAnd there's a little acronym that you'll\nsee used anytime you read a Six Sigma book\n\n231\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:51.240\nwhich is DMAIC,\nthis guy right here D-M-A-I-C.\n\n232\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.350\nYou'll hear people call it d maic or\nda maic, I've heard both.\n\n233\n00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.760\nI think da maic is kind of\nthe most common one which to me,\n\n234\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.810\nalmost sounds like demonic.\n\n235\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.560\nSo I don't normally-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n236\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.620\n>> Use that one.\n\n237\n00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:09.195\nBut DMAIC, define measure,\nanalyze, improve, control.\n\n238\n00:11:09.195 --> 00:11:12.180\nDefine, that's like our plan.\n\n239\n00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.080\nWe figure out what it is that we're\ngonna be measuring to evaluate,\n\n240\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.750\nwhat it is we expect to get?\n\n241\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.308\nMeasure, we collect data.\n\n242\n00:11:21.308 --> 00:11:24.290\nIf we're gonna be evaluating this we have\nto have some kind of measurable thing.\n\n243\n00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.360\nRemember the help desk example I gave you?\n\n244\n00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.440\nI can't just arbitrarily decide if\na help desk call was good or bad.\n\n245\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.920\nBut if I base it on customer satisfaction,\nnow I've got something that I can measure.\n\n246\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.130\nLet's say, that you're a fast food\nrestaurant and you make hamburgers.\n\n247\n00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.892\nHow do you measure whether\nthat hamburger tastes good?\n\n248\n00:11:41.892 --> 00:11:43.340\nCan you measure taste like that?\n\n249\n00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.079\nI don't have a taste meter,\nI can stick in there and\n\n250\n00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:49.601\nsay no, this ones a 7.5 on\nthe taste scale, it doesn't work.\n\n251\n00:11:49.601 --> 00:11:52.824\nBut if you measure your customer\nsatisfaction or something\n\n252\n00:11:52.824 --> 00:11:57.700\nelse temperature, appearance something\nlike that those are measurable items.\n\n253\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.080\nSo we measure and then we analyze,\nwe analyze the data we got to see,\n\n254\n00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.350\ndoes it match what we\ndefined in the beginning?\n\n255\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.260\nThis is basically plan, do, check, act.\n\n256\n00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.140\nThe act part though becomes improved.\n\n257\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.010\nCan we make it better?\n\n258\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.930\nI'm getting nine out of ten support calls,\nthat are getting eight or\n\n259\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:16.690\nhigher on their evals.\n\n260\n00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.361\nThat's great.\n\n261\n00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:18.650\nBut what about that tenth one?\n\n262\n00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.530\nCan I get that better or\nwhat if all ten were an eight or higher?\n\n263\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.313\nCould I get all ten to be a nine or\nhigher?\n\n264\n00:12:24.313 --> 00:12:25.070\nLet's improve.\n\n265\n00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.350\nLet's see if we can make it better.\n\n266\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:32.063\nNow there does come a tipping point where\nimproving would cost more than it's worth.\n\n267\n00:12:32.063 --> 00:12:33.430\nYou wouldn't get the necessary benefit.\n\n268\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.400\nSo you go through this cycle a few times\nbefore you kind of reach that cost of\n\n269\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.300\nbenefit equalizer.\n\n270\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.292\nAnd the last one we got control.\n\n271\n00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:43.430\nControl says,\n\n272\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.880\nwe're gonna keep doing this how do I make\nsure that I always get consistent results?\n\n273\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.895\nAnd the best example I can give for\ncontrol is maintenance.\n\n274\n00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:54.429\nI know if I get my car in the morning,\nI can turn the key it starts up and\n\n275\n00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:55.810\nI can drive to work.\n\n276\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.590\nI've done it a thousand times\nwell probably more than that.\n\n277\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.060\nSo I've done it thousands of times get in\nthe car drive to work I know the car can\n\n278\n00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.190\ndo it.\n\n279\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:08.150\nBut I still have to change the oil in\nthe car, I've got to put gas in it.\n\n280\n00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.630\nThat's me controlling.\n\n281\n00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.690\nI'm controlling to make sure that car\nwill be able to get me to work tomorrow.\n\n282\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.570\nI already know that I've measured it.\n\n283\n00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.150\nOne tank of gas will get me to the office.\n\n284\n00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.360\nI know my car can do that.\n\n285\n00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.560\nI've analyzed that.\n\n286\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.130\nBut if I don't control it, if I let it\nrun out of gas, if I don't change the oil\n\n287\n00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.670\nthen everything kind of goes off and\nit just doesn't work anymore.\n\n288\n00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.250\nSo we've got a control.\n\n289\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.680\nAnd that's really the core principle of\nSix Sigma is this process right here.\n\n290\n00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.090\nAnd it's a constant cycle.\n\n291\n00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.990\nYou're going over and over it and\nover again, cycling through that\n\n292\n00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.450\nto make it better, and better, and\nbetter and minimize those defects.\n\n293\n00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.170\n>> Now Don, with this process we that\nit's main function then is really,\n\n294\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.400\nwhen we talk about Six Sigma is to try and\neliminate those deficiencies that\n\n295\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.800\nare in our products as well as\nactually to become more efficient and\n\n296\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.680\nmaking better products as well.\n\n297\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.910\nBut sometimes we have to do the opposite\nwhich is that the process that we're doing\n\n298\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.270\nhas to do with a lot of wasted motion.\n\n299\n00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.920\nAnd in this we might turn to another\ntype of methodology that we called Lean,\n\n300\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.970\nI think is what the term is.\n\n301\n00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.650\n>> Yeah, and\nboy Lean is thrown around a lot.\n\n302\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.976\nSo Lean is another one\nthat comes from the past.\n\n303\n00:14:15.976 --> 00:14:18.926\nSo this one just comes\nfrom way back in the past.\n\n304\n00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:22.710\nI mentioned how Six Sigma came\nout of Motorola in the 1980s.\n\n305\n00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:27.430\nLean actually came out of\nToyota back in the 1950s.\n\n306\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.357\nSo we're talking about a 60\nyear old methodology here,\n\n307\n00:14:30.357 --> 00:14:31.919\ncreeping up on 70 years old.\n\n308\n00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:34.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The gentleman who kinda created Lean,\n\n309\n00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.680\nhis name and I'm gonna have to read\nthis off the paper is Taiichi Ohno.\n\n310\n00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.930\nTaiichi Ohno, who actually he's\nresponsible for a number of\n\n311\n00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.980\ndifferent things in the project management\nand the process improvement world.\n\n312\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.400\nSo you'll see his name in various books.\n\n313\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.060\nBut what he did is he said,\n\n314\n00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.900\nis no matter how good a process is\nwhen you look at it, there's waste.\n\n315\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.210\nThere's always waste, waste of some sort.\n\n316\n00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:00.660\nAnd so we need a way to improve upon that,\nby minimizing the waste.\n\n317\n00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.450\nIf we can minimize the waste,\n\n318\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.870\nour process might still take\nthe same amount of time to complete.\n\n319\n00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.710\nWe might have the same amount of defects.\n\n320\n00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.572\nBut maybe we can reduce\nour company's expenses or\n\n321\n00:15:09.572 --> 00:15:12.037\nwhatever to make us better in other areas.\n\n322\n00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:18.251\nSo he took a little bit more of a holistic\napproach to process improvement and\n\n323\n00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:23.103\nwhat he came up with was this\nlist of what he called Muda which\n\n324\n00:15:23.103 --> 00:15:26.872\nis the Japanese word for waste or garbage-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:15:26.872 --> 00:15:28.500\n>> Or something, I don't know.\n\n326\n00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.530\nBut basically we have this,\n\n327\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.695\nseven places where people will\ntypically generate waste.\n\n328\n00:15:34.695 --> 00:15:36.736\nAnd there's a simple acronym for this,\n\n329\n00:15:36.736 --> 00:15:39.867\nI've got it here kind of on my\nscreen which is called Tim Wood.\n\n330\n00:15:39.867 --> 00:15:41.168\nIf you read a Lean book out there,\n\n331\n00:15:41.168 --> 00:15:44.720\nyou'll see this acronym mentioned\nsomewhere because it's easy to remember.\n\n332\n00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.116\nBut basically it boils down to the seven\nareas where people are wasteful,\n\n333\n00:15:48.116 --> 00:15:49.669\nwhere a process can be wasteful.\n\n334\n00:15:49.669 --> 00:15:51.376\nThe first one is transport.\n\n335\n00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:52.914\nIf you think about transport,\n\n336\n00:15:52.914 --> 00:15:56.177\nanytime you have to move something\nfrom one location to another.\n\n337\n00:15:56.177 --> 00:15:59.356\nThe whole time it's being moved,\nit's like being held in reserve.\n\n338\n00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:02.390\nYou can't make money on something\nthat's in the process of being moved.\n\n339\n00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.941\nAnd you can't use something while\nit's in the process of being moved.\n\n340\n00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:08.414\nSo if we can minimize the amount\nof time that it's being moved,\n\n341\n00:16:08.414 --> 00:16:10.257\nthat can help to minimize waste.\n\n342\n00:16:10.257 --> 00:16:14.925\nAll right, and putting this in terms\nof Toyota, when they manufacture a car,\n\n343\n00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:19.592\nif they then have to stick it on a barge,\none of those giant freightliners, and\n\n344\n00:16:19.592 --> 00:16:22.440\nship it from Japan to the United States.\n\n345\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.890\nThat could take two months.\n\n346\n00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.590\nAnd during those two months they're\nholding on to that inventory.\n\n347\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.830\nThat's money that they're\nnot gaining interest on.\n\n348\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.280\nThat they're basically losing money on.\n\n349\n00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.190\nAnd then as soon as it gets here\nto the States, they can sell it,\n\n350\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.680\nand they make the money back.\n\n351\n00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.530\nBut the shorter they make that trip, the\nfaster they can get their money back and\n\n352\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.990\nthe faster the money can go\ninto their next project and\n\n353\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.495\ncontinue to improve the company.\n\n354\n00:16:43.495 --> 00:16:44.100\nRight?\n\n355\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.156\nSo transport is kind of a big one.\n\n356\n00:16:46.156 --> 00:16:48.780\nRight?\nIn IT we don't see transport as much, but\n\n357\n00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.300\nin other industries\nit's a very real thing.\n\n358\n00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.720\nInventory is another one.\n\n359\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.340\nRight?\n\n360\n00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.580\nInventory, if you have to hold things\non your shelf, look at a grocery store.\n\n361\n00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.260\nRight?\n\n362\n00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.070\nIf you were to take a grocery store and\nclose the doors, and\n\n363\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.350\ntally up the dollar value of all of\nthe items inside that grocery store.\n\n364\n00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:07.190\nIt's a lot of money,\n\n365\n00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.340\nmoney that they're sitting on that they\ndon't recoup until they sell that item.\n\n366\n00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.949\nAnd when they sell the item,\nwhat do they do?\n\n367\n00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:13.580\nThey buy a replacement\nto put on the shelf, so\n\n368\n00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.350\nthey've always got that\ninventory in place.\n\n369\n00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:19.830\nAnything we can do to reduce\nthe inventory that we need but\n\n370\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.566\nstill keep the customer happy.\n\n371\n00:17:21.566 --> 00:17:23.570\nRight?\nThat's the real trick right there because\n\n372\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.750\nyou don't wanna make your item hard to\nget because then people just go and\n\n373\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.760\nbuy a different item.\n\n374\n00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.290\nRight?\n\n375\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.875\nSo by keeping it to the minimal level\nnecessary is gonna help our company to be\n\n376\n00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:34.105\nable to respond to changes faster.\n\n377\n00:17:35.225 --> 00:17:36.635\nMotion.\nThis\n\n378\n00:17:36.635 --> 00:17:38.335\nis kind of a weird one because\nwe talk about transport.\n\n379\n00:17:38.335 --> 00:17:39.315\nWhat is motion?\n\n380\n00:17:39.315 --> 00:17:41.855\nWell, it's really not\njust motion by itself.\n\n381\n00:17:41.855 --> 00:17:45.525\nIt's really talking about too much or\ntoo little motion.\n\n382\n00:17:45.525 --> 00:17:46.045\nRight?\n\n383\n00:17:46.045 --> 00:17:50.810\nSo for example, lets say you get\na new appliance like a dishwasher and\n\n384\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.270\nyou're installing the dishwasher and\nyou push it into place and\n\n385\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.080\nyou push it a little too far in.\n\n386\n00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.330\nOr you don't push it far enough in.\n\n387\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.590\nWhat do you have to do then?\n\n388\n00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.170\nYou have to do is called Rework.\n\n389\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:03.210\nYou have to go in and push it to\nbe right back in the correct spot.\n\n390\n00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:09.390\nSo anytime you have a moving part there's\nthis possibility that things may go wrong.\n\n391\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.167\nRight?\nThe moving part that we're out,\n\n392\n00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:13.322\nthe movie part could go too far or\ntoo short and\n\n393\n00:18:13.322 --> 00:18:15.040\nnow you've got to adjust for that.\n\n394\n00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.520\nSo anytime you have motion,\nyou can have unnecessary motion.\n\n395\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.520\nAnd that's an area where\nwe can have waste waiting.\n\n396\n00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.056\nJust waiting in general.\nAnd\n\n397\n00:18:22.056 --> 00:18:25.042\nthis is one in IT that I\ncan absolutely relate to.\n\n398\n00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:26.635\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know Ronnie,\n\n399\n00:18:26.635 --> 00:18:30.713\nI've told you before like, half my career\nhas been spent watching a blue bar scroll\n\n400\n00:18:30.713 --> 00:18:32.591\nacross the screen to get to 100%.\n\n401\n00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:34.274\nThat's the world of IT.\n\n402\n00:18:34.274 --> 00:18:37.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Could I have been doing something else?\n\n403\n00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.630\nRight?\nCan we multitask?\n\n404\n00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.640\nCan we do other things to achieve?\n\n405\n00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.650\nSo when we wait on something, and\nusing Toyota, they paint a car.\n\n406\n00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.050\nGotta wait for the paint to dry.\n\n407\n00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.260\nIs there something we could do\nto minimize that waiting time?\n\n408\n00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.568\nCould we have heat lamps that bake\nthe paint so it dries faster or whatever?\n\n409\n00:18:50.568 --> 00:18:51.926\nI imagine so.\n\n410\n00:18:51.926 --> 00:18:52.448\nRight?\n\n411\n00:18:52.448 --> 00:18:53.899\nI've never made a car,\nso I don't really know.\n\n412\n00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:55.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I imagine so.\n\n413\n00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.430\nAnd those are ways that we\ncan improve our process.\n\n414\n00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.870\nOverproduction.\n\n415\n00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.965\nAll right, overproduction, Ronnie you\nare the master of overproduction.\n\n416\n00:19:03.965 --> 00:19:06.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sometimes we can put too much effort\n\n417\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.400\ninto something to achieve it.\n\n418\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.731\nRight?\nSo, I might need, so I might go to Ronnie.\n\n419\n00:19:13.731 --> 00:19:15.310\nI'm gonna throw you under the bus here,\nRonnie.\n\n420\n00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.157\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, that's fine.\n\n421\n00:19:16.157 --> 00:19:18.440\n>> I go to Ronnie and I say,\nRonnie I need a web server fired up.\n\n422\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.530\nCan you spin me up a, you know,\n\n423\n00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.260\njust a Windows virtual machine\nwith a web server on it?\n\n424\n00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.590\nAnd then he'll come to me the next day and\nsay oh, your web server is up.\n\n425\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.930\nOh and I set up antivirus on it and\n\n426\n00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.930\nI configured the firewall\nto allow these rules and\n\n427\n00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.420\nI applied all the updates and all this\nextra stuff that he did, which is great.\n\n428\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.254\nRight?\nI mean it really creates that perfect\n\n429\n00:19:38.254 --> 00:19:39.560\nenvironment.\n\n430\n00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.320\nBut, it put a lot more work into it,\nand I might not need that.\n\n431\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.520\nI might have just wanted\nto test something, and\n\n432\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.303\nI'm gonna delete the server.\n\n433\n00:19:44.303 --> 00:19:46.775\nSo, that's overproduction.\n\n434\n00:19:46.775 --> 00:19:47.321\nRight?\n\n435\n00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:48.335\nMore than we need.\n\n436\n00:19:48.335 --> 00:19:52.405\nAnytime you go beyond your customers'\nrequirements, that's overproduction.\n\n437\n00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:53.730\nRight?\n\n438\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.175\nOverproduction can also be where\nwe created too much of an item.\n\n439\n00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:57.830\nRight?\n\n440\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.335\nSo, they needed 100,\nwe made 200 just for the heck of it.\n\n441\n00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:04.070\nWe might end up having to eat up\nthat extra hundred that we made, and\n\n442\n00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.150\nthat can be a part of it too.\n\n443\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.030\nOver Processing.\n\n444\n00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:08.610\nRight?\n\n445\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.670\nOver processing is kinda\nsimilar to overproduction.\n\n446\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.816\nYou see over processing usually when\nyou're manufacturing something like paper\n\n447\n00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:15.620\nor whatever.\n\n448\n00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.280\nSo, paper for example, is actually brown,\nthey bleach it to be white.\n\n449\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.350\nAnd you can over bleach it like\nit's already white enough and\n\n450\n00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.120\nyou continue processing it more,\nyou've done more work than was necessary.\n\n451\n00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.670\nAnd then lastly it's just defects.\n\n452\n00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.240\nAnd defects are what we normally look for.\n\n453\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.870\nRight?\nThis is where we expected one thing and\n\n454\n00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.430\nwe got something else and\nit's not suitable.\n\n455\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.312\nThat's a defect.\n\n456\n00:20:34.312 --> 00:20:36.694\nRight?\nSo these seven are kind of the core areas,\n\n457\n00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:39.170\nnow there are other ones\nthat are out there.\n\n458\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:39.714\nRight?\n\n459\n00:20:39.714 --> 00:20:43.290\nBut these are the core seven\nthat they call out in Lean.\n\n460\n00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:47.680\nNow the interesting thing about Lean is\nthat you rarely see it employed by itself.\n\n461\n00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.416\nOkay.\nIt's a methodology for\n\n462\n00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:53.193\nidentifying areas of waste, so\nthat we can then work to improve them.\n\n463\n00:20:53.193 --> 00:20:57.615\nSo, the improvement part,\nthat kind of comes with something else,\n\n464\n00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:02.038\nlike Six Sigma or other methodologies\nwhere it might create a project\n\n465\n00:21:02.038 --> 00:21:04.804\nto try to improve it and\nmove that forward.\n\n466\n00:21:04.804 --> 00:21:07.223\nSo, you'll hear about people talking,\n\n467\n00:21:07.223 --> 00:21:10.940\nwell you'll hear people\ntalking about Lean Six Sigma.\n\n468\n00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.850\nRight?\nOr Lean Agile.\n\n469\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.740\nRight?\nYou'll hear Lean Scrums sometimes or\n\n470\n00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.240\nwhatever, and it's where they're\ntaking one methodology, and\n\n471\n00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.350\ncombining it with Lean.\n\n472\n00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.440\nSo, hey, we're doing this activity,\nbut we're also watching for\n\n473\n00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.480\nwaste, to see if we can\nimprove along the way.\n\n474\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.151\nSo, Lean is not so\nmuch a stand alone item.\n\n475\n00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:31.539\n>> Now, Don, I also understand from\nToyota that guy, what is it, Taiichi?\n\n476\n00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:33.035\n>> Taiichi Ohno.\n\n477\n00:21:33.035 --> 00:21:36.984\n>> Taiichi Ohno that not only did he\nproduce Lean though, another part that's\n\n478\n00:21:36.984 --> 00:21:41.800\nvery important of course to Toyota was the\nidea of inventory processing and control.\n\n479\n00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.140\nAnd so that one is actually called Kanban?\n\n480\n00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.380\n>> Kanban, yep.\n\n481\n00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.000\nKanban, another Japanese word.\n\n482\n00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.407\nI believe it means sign or something.\n\n483\n00:21:49.407 --> 00:21:50.103\n>> Billboard, yeah, signs.\n\n484\n00:21:50.103 --> 00:21:51.566\n>> Yeah, billboard,\nsomething like that, yes.\n\n485\n00:21:51.566 --> 00:21:55.064\nBasically, it really,\nit literally translates a sign, but\n\n486\n00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:57.500\na better translation for it would be card.\n\n487\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.124\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because Kanban works on this principle\n\n488\n00:22:00.124 --> 00:22:01.180\nof cards.\n\n489\n00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.560\nThat, it stems from Toyota.\n\n490\n00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.970\nRight?\nSo, basically,\n\n491\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.760\nas part of eliminating ways to\nmaking these more efficient.\n\n492\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.150\nWhat Taiichi Ohno found was that, a lot\nof times they had a bunch of inventory.\n\n493\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.750\nRight?\nJust a bunch of, let's just say, mufflers.\n\n494\n00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.010\nAll right, car mufflers or\ncar wheels, for that matter.\n\n495\n00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.150\nSo maybe they had 10,000 wheels.\n\n496\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.710\nAnd they're about to make 200 cars.\n\n497\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.570\nWell how many wheels do I need for\n200 cars?\n\n498\n00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.480\n800 wheels.\n\n499\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.320\nRight?\nSo if I have 10,000 wheels,\n\n500\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.930\nI've got way too many wheels for\nwhat I need.\n\n501\n00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.440\nSo all those other wheels\nare just sitting there.\n\n502\n00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.169\nRight?\nTheir inventory.\n\n503\n00:22:34.169 --> 00:22:37.757\nAnd the problem with having\ninventory is kind of twofold.\n\n504\n00:22:37.757 --> 00:22:38.680\nRight?\n\n505\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.430\nThe main problem is that it's money\nsitting there and you're not using it.\n\n506\n00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.160\nRight?\n\n507\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.330\nBut the second thing is it\nstops your company's agility.\n\n508\n00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.767\nAnd what I mean by that is,\nlet's say that, all right,\n\n509\n00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:53.730\nit's 2015,\nthe 2016 model cars are about to come out.\n\n510\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.440\nAnd I decided, you know what,\ninstead of 16 inch wheels,\n\n511\n00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.780\nlet's go to 17 inch wheels.\n\n512\n00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.920\nWell, we've kinda got 8,000\nwheels sitting here in inventory,\n\n513\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.235\nlet's just stay with the 16 inches, so\nwe can burn through all this inventory.\n\n514\n00:23:05.235 --> 00:23:06.830\nRight?\nThat's what companies do.\n\n515\n00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.730\nYou gotta do that otherwise\nyou have eat the inventory.\n\n516\n00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:14.270\nSo the more inventory you have,\nthe smaller your ability to change is.\n\n517\n00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.110\nRight?\nYou can't\n\n518\n00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.160\nswitch out because you've\ngot all this extra stuff.\n\n519\n00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.820\nAnd inventory actually\napplies to two things.\n\n520\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.430\nOne, inventory is just\nsitting there on the ground.\n\n521\n00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.130\nRight?\nBut\n\n522\n00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.700\nalso inventory applied\nto work in progress.\n\n523\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.230\nAt anytime you can go to a Toyota\nfactory and they're making cars.\n\n524\n00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.610\nThere is a number of cars that\nare beyond their conveyor belt.\n\n525\n00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.100\nIt could be a 100, it could be a 1000.\n\n526\n00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.570\nAnd those cars are already in production,\nif I wanna make a change.\n\n527\n00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.060\nIf I say let's go to this better tire,\nthis time because we can get it for\n\n528\n00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.870\nless money and it's just as good.\n\n529\n00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.340\nWell I've kind of already\ngot 1000 cars in process.\n\n530\n00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.870\nI can't change those, so\nI have to wait for those to finish.\n\n531\n00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.374\nRight?\nSo inventory or work in progress,\n\n532\n00:23:49.374 --> 00:23:54.089\nyou'll hear those terms kind of\ninterchangeably if you start studying.\n\n533\n00:23:54.089 --> 00:23:57.642\nKanban and you even see that\nwith Six Sigma and Lean also.\n\n534\n00:23:57.642 --> 00:23:59.810\nIt's kind of pervasive through them.\n\n535\n00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.030\nKanban, though,\nreally focuses on that inventory side.\n\n536\n00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.604\nAnd it basically says instead of\nsitting on a ton of inventory,\n\n537\n00:24:05.604 --> 00:24:07.790\nwe're going to use cards.\n\n538\n00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.780\nAnd these cards will indicate\nwhen we need to buy more tires or\n\n539\n00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.340\nwhen we need to buy more steering wheels.\n\n540\n00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.140\nAnd we'll apply them as we need them.\n\n541\n00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.600\nSo for example,\nI might have a bin, bin and car,\n\n542\n00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.980\nthose are the two really important\nterms you'll hear in Kanban.\n\n543\n00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.230\nWe'll have a bin that has a bunch\nof steering wheels in it, and\n\n544\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.330\nthis is how it was back in the 1950s.\n\n545\n00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.480\nThat when they go to grab a steering\nwheel, you look at it and\n\n546\n00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.600\nyou see how many steering\nwheels are still in the bin.\n\n547\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.850\nAnd if I get down to five or\nten steering wheels, I take a red card.\n\n548\n00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.509\nAnd it may just have one word,\nit may just say order, and that's it.\n\n549\n00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:42.525\nIt could have very detailed\ninformation on there right,\n\n550\n00:24:42.525 --> 00:24:44.510\nit's up to you how you\nwanna deploy the cards.\n\n551\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.061\nBut let's just say it's a red card that\nsays order, and you drop it in the bin.\n\n552\n00:24:48.061 --> 00:24:50.670\nAnd then someone else,\nwho's the ordering agent, comes along and\n\n553\n00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.030\nsees the red card and says, oop, I need to\norder steering wheels, and they order ten.\n\n554\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.345\nAnd then, as we continue to fill\nthat up and to take it out again,\n\n555\n00:24:58.345 --> 00:25:00.859\nwhen we get down to five\nwe drop that card back in.\n\n556\n00:25:00.859 --> 00:25:02.520\nTime to order more, right.\n\n557\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:08.600\nSo the cards are an indicator of what\nneeds to be ordered so we can minimize\n\n558\n00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.090\nour inventory, which saves us money,\nand it allows us to change more easily.\n\n559\n00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.760\nWe can say, look we need to switch\nsteering wheels to this new one that's got\n\n560\n00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.430\nvolume controls built into it.\n\n561\n00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.058\nAll right, well we've only got ten in\ninventory so just the next time we order,\n\n562\n00:25:22.058 --> 00:25:23.316\nwe're gonna switch it up.\n\n563\n00:25:23.316 --> 00:25:27.576\nSo on the card,\nwe put order new part number.\n\n564\n00:25:27.576 --> 00:25:30.040\nAnd you drop that in the bin and\nnow they order the new part number and\n\n565\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.600\nyou move forward.\n\n566\n00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.954\nNow this is from the 1950s and I know what\nsome of you guys are thinking, well I\n\n567\n00:25:34.954 --> 00:25:39.269\ndon't have bins, first off and secondly\nthis sounds pretty labor intensive.\n\n568\n00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:41.579\nWe've got manual cards and\npeople gotta write stuff.\n\n569\n00:25:41.579 --> 00:25:43.500\nYou see this electronically too.\n\n570\n00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.486\nA great example,\n\n571\n00:25:44.486 --> 00:25:48.246\nI don't know if any of you guys ever\nused the service called Trello.\n\n572\n00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:53.017\nTrello is like a to do list kind of\nsoftware for tracking your own stuff, but\n\n573\n00:25:53.017 --> 00:25:57.511\nit's also great for projects and\nit follows Kanban's methodology.\n\n574\n00:25:57.511 --> 00:25:59.452\nWhen you come in and\nyou whip up a project,\n\n575\n00:25:59.452 --> 00:26:02.684\nyou create what are called lists and\nthe lists are effectively bins.\n\n576\n00:26:02.684 --> 00:26:06.994\nI could have a bin that was called,\nmaybe, like,\n\n577\n00:26:06.994 --> 00:26:11.625\nwork breakdown structure,\nor tasks, or whatever.\n\n578\n00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:14.280\nSo I might call it Upcoming Tasks,\nall right?\n\n579\n00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.217\nSo there's that list and then I might\nhave a list called Work in Progress.\n\n580\n00:26:19.217 --> 00:26:21.345\nThese are things that\nare going on right now.\n\n581\n00:26:21.345 --> 00:26:24.985\nAnd then I might have Completed Tasks,\nall right?\n\n582\n00:26:24.985 --> 00:26:26.810\nSo I've got three bins.\n\n583\n00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.552\nAnd then in each bin,\nsee how it says Add a card,\n\n584\n00:26:28.552 --> 00:26:31.619\nthat terminology is right out of Kanban,\nthat's basically what they're doing.\n\n585\n00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:35.100\nSo I can come in here and\nstart to list the tasks that I've got.\n\n586\n00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.559\nSo if I'm building a car, right?\n\n587\n00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:40.948\nWe might have Order tires,\nwe might have whatever,\n\n588\n00:26:40.948 --> 00:26:44.737\neach of these different items\nthat are going to be in here.\n\n589\n00:26:44.737 --> 00:26:48.069\nAnd so Paint the frame, so\nwe're gonna paint the frame,\n\n590\n00:26:48.069 --> 00:26:50.400\nwe're gonna do each of things.\n\n591\n00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.634\nAnd as you start to do that work, okay,\nI've got this upcoming task paint a frame.\n\n592\n00:26:54.634 --> 00:26:55.977\nI'm ready to start painting.\n\n593\n00:26:55.977 --> 00:26:58.389\nI'm just going to drag that and\ndrop it in to Work in Progress.\n\n594\n00:26:58.389 --> 00:27:01.150\nAnd so now I've moved the card.\n\n595\n00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.941\nAnd if somebody comes along and\nlooks in the Work in Progress bin,\n\n596\n00:27:03.941 --> 00:27:06.547\nthey can see oh we're painting\nthe frame right now, right?\n\n597\n00:27:06.547 --> 00:27:10.880\nAnd we haven't ordered the tires yet,\nwe probably should have done that, right?\n\n598\n00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.560\nOr they see where maybe Order tires\nis already in Completed Tasks.\n\n599\n00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.050\nAnd so they can look and see the card and\nthey know what hasn't been done,\n\n600\n00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:22.560\nwhat's currently being done, and\nwhat's already done at a quick glance.\n\n601\n00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.963\nThese are cards in bins,\nand it's the same idea.\n\n602\n00:27:25.963 --> 00:27:30.269\nThis is Kanban implemented\nelectronically in a modern format.\n\n603\n00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:32.665\nThere's tons of people out\nthere that use Trello and\n\n604\n00:27:32.665 --> 00:27:34.196\nhave never even heard of Kanban.\n\n605\n00:27:34.196 --> 00:27:37.249\nAnd they're basically using\nthe principle every single day, so\n\n606\n00:27:37.249 --> 00:27:39.869\nthis is something that is pervasive,\nwe do see it a lot.\n\n607\n00:27:39.869 --> 00:27:43.482\n>> Now in the area of process analysis\nthen, there's probably a lot more of\n\n608\n00:27:43.482 --> 00:27:45.984\nthe different methodologies\nthat are out there.\n\n609\n00:27:45.984 --> 00:27:49.541\nBut these are by far, probably the most\npopular and probably even some of the most\n\n610\n00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:52.753\neffective ones, that maybe the newer\nsystems are based off of, right?\n\n611\n00:27:52.753 --> 00:27:56.593\n>> Yeah, and what you want to do is you\nwant to take this and kind of fit it for\n\n612\n00:27:56.593 --> 00:28:00.177\nyour own company and\nyou're gonna apply it differently, right,\n\n613\n00:28:00.177 --> 00:28:03.380\ndifferent people have different\nneeds to make it work out.\n\n614\n00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.118\nAnd so, fortunately you don't\nhave to re-invent the wheel,\n\n615\n00:28:06.118 --> 00:28:09.736\nthere's plenty of organizations out there\nthat can kind of give you a framework for\n\n616\n00:28:09.736 --> 00:28:11.900\nthis, but PMI doesn't, right.\n\n617\n00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.784\nWe saw it in some of the other episodes\nwhere we saw process improvement,\n\n618\n00:28:14.784 --> 00:28:17.259\nsome of the different tools and\ntechniques we had available.\n\n619\n00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:21.270\nBut PMI doesn't really get into process\nimprovement because that's really\n\n620\n00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.880\nan ongoing activity,\nnot a project, all right.\n\n621\n00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.736\nBut there are some\nstandards organizations and\n\n622\n00:28:25.736 --> 00:28:27.598\nother people out there\nthat can help us with it.\n\n623\n00:28:27.598 --> 00:28:29.920\nI wanna talk about each\none just kind of in brief,\n\n624\n00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.277\nbut I know I've kind of already run\na little long on this one, Ronnie.\n\n625\n00:28:33.277 --> 00:28:37.209\nSo why don't we do this, why don't we\nstop this one and we'll do a part two.\n\n626\n00:28:37.209 --> 00:28:40.578\nAnd I want to talk about some of the\norganizations that are out there that can\n\n627\n00:28:40.578 --> 00:28:43.896\nactually kind of give you that starting\npoint to be able to implement these\n\n628\n00:28:43.896 --> 00:28:45.678\nwithout having to reinvent the wheel.\n\n629\n00:28:45.678 --> 00:28:48.489\n>> All right so in this episode\nremember that we took a look at three\n\n630\n00:28:48.489 --> 00:28:52.364\nof the different methodologies that you'll\nprobably end up finding out about which is\n\n631\n00:28:52.364 --> 00:28:53.386\ngoing to be Six Sigma.\n\n632\n00:28:53.386 --> 00:28:54.756\nLean as well as Kanban and\n\n633\n00:28:54.756 --> 00:28:59.530\nthis is part of those ongoing processes\nthat help us to improve our efficiency.\n\n634\n00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.580\nAs well as to try and\neliminate as much waste as possible and\n\n635\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.260\nalso to improve that process in\ninventory and control, as well.\n\n636\n00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.239\nAnd that is actually what we need to make\nsure that we focus on, preparing for\n\n637\n00:29:10.239 --> 00:29:11.493\nthe PMP exam, as well.\n\n638\n00:29:11.493 --> 00:29:14.940\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n639\n00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.489\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n640\n00:29:15.489 --> 00:29:17.439\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n641\n00:29:17.439 --> 00:29:23.760\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.370\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n\n4\n00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.210\nand we're taking a look at the PMP,\nthe Project Management Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.590\nAnd today with us, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.250\nHow's it going?\n\n7\n00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.190\n>> It is going great, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.270\nReady to continue on with our\nprocess analysis episode.\n\n9\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.829\nIf you didn't watch the last part, we got\na chance to take a look at Six Sigma,\n\n10\n00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.393\nLean, and and how they kind of influence\nhow we handle process improvement today.\n\n11\n00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:40.011\nAnd at the very end of the episode\nI said something to the effect of,\n\n12\n00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:42.930\nyou don't have to start from\nscratch on a lot of this.\n\n13\n00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.420\nThere's a lot of organizations\nout there that wanna help you\n\n14\n00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.350\nimplement efficient processes\nfrom the very beginning and\n\n15\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.330\nnot have to go through a ton of\nprocess improvement to make it better.\n\n16\n00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.320\nSo, what we have are basically,\nwhat PMI boils down to,\n\n17\n00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.720\nstandards and best practices, all right?\n\n18\n00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.744\nSo, let's say that I'm\nforming up a new company or\n\n19\n00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:05.191\nI'm moving into an area that I'm\nnot really familiar with and\n\n20\n00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.035\nI want to make sure that things\nare running as efficiently as possible.\n\n21\n00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:12.549\nAnd I just need a good starting point,\na good place to kind of pick up from and\n\n22\n00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.590\nknow that I'm in as good\na shape as I can be.\n\n23\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.470\nAnd what I can do is I can look out to\nthe world and look out for my industry and\n\n24\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.480\nsay, is there a standard's body out there?\n\n25\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.440\nOr is there a collective of best\npractices that I can follow to at\n\n26\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.330\nleast put me in the best footing\nfrom the very beginning?\n\n27\n00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.010\nWe can always change, right?\n\n28\n00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.860\nBut, at least get me\nstarted in the right place.\n\n29\n00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.000\nWell, the first thing we\nneed to understand is\n\n30\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.380\nthe difference between a standard and\na best practice.\n\n31\n00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.470\nStandards are important,\nbest practices are even more important.\n\n32\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.970\nA best practice is, it's not a law,\n\n33\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.620\nit's not even a rule really its more\nof a guideline or suggestion, and\n\n34\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.240\nit's usually organizations that deal\nwith a certain kind of equipment.\n\n35\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.630\nSo, like in IT,\nwe have wireless access points.\n\n36\n00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.280\nWireless access points can use\na number of different frequencies and\n\n37\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.070\nencryption standards and so on.\n\n38\n00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.850\nSo, there is the WIFI Alliance which\nputs out a collection of best practices,\n\n39\n00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.490\nthat say if you're gonna\ndeploy a wireless network,\n\n40\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.410\nhere's how we recommend you do it.\n\n41\n00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.860\nHere's the frequencies we recommend you\nuse, here's how we recommend you position\n\n42\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.850\nyour access points, here's how we\nrecommend equipment that we know will be\n\n43\n00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.010\ncompatible with each other, right, and\nyou can choose to take their advice and\n\n44\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.310\nfollow it or you could choose to\nignore it, disregard it, right.\n\n45\n00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.680\nBut the idea is that if\nyou don't know anything\n\n46\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.670\nyou can follow their best practices and\nyou'll end up okay.\n\n47\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.350\nYou might of been able to do a better job\nif you had the experience, expertise,\n\n48\n00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.680\ntechnique, whatever, but\n\n49\n00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.040\nif you didn't know anything you'll do\nfine following the best practices, right.\n\n50\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.576\nYou see that with servers,\nyou see it with construction,\n\n51\n00:02:44.576 --> 00:02:47.959\nyou see it in medical environments,\nthere's always these best practices.\n\n52\n00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.830\nIf you don't follow them,\nwhat's your penalty?\n\n53\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.680\nNothing.\nWell, you might fail, right?\n\n54\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.510\nYou might fail unnecessarily.\n\n55\n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.170\nOr you might know more than the people\nwho did these best practices.\n\n56\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.380\nBecause when they create a best practice,\nthey're trying to think about everybody.\n\n57\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.650\nWhat's the best solution for\neverybody as a whole, right.\n\n58\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.090\nAnd the thing about that most common,\nwhat is it?\n\n59\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.200\n>> Most common denominator?\n\n60\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.590\n>> Yes.\nThere we go.\n\n61\n00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.105\nI usually use.\n\n62\n00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:14.230\n[LAUGH] In a more sarcastic light.\n\n63\n00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.720\nBut in this case it actually makes sense.\n\n64\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.210\nThe lowest common denominator,\nwhat everybody has in common.\n\n65\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.610\nBut you might have things\nthat make you different.\n\n66\n00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.870\nAnd you know that.\n\n67\n00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.120\nThe best practices\norganizations don't know that.\n\n68\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.340\nSo, you might have a very good reason for\nmoving away from a best practice, and\n\n69\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.130\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n70\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.520\nSo, that's kind of the advantage\nof a best practice.\n\n71\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.180\nAnd, there's organizations out\nthere that are packed full of them.\n\n72\n00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.710\nA great example would be the CMMI, right?\n\n73\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.456\nLet me just bring up their website here,\nthe CMMI Institute.\n\n74\n00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:44.776\nAnd what these guys do,\nis they basically do a lot of things,\n\n75\n00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:48.250\nthey focus on capabilities, though.\n\n76\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.230\nYour company does something, right?\n\n77\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.010\nIt produces an item that\nprovides a service.\n\n78\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.810\nEvery company does something,\nunless you're in politics and then,\n\n79\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.875\nyou probably don't do anything.\n\n80\n00:03:57.875 --> 00:03:59.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But everybody else,\n\n81\n00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.660\nyou do something, right?\n\n82\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.630\nAnd they help you with what's called\na capability maturity model, right?\n\n83\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.240\nHow you can make sure that you're\ncapability is being provided\n\n84\n00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.430\nin a mature fashion,\nto use the words in their own definition.\n\n85\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.430\nAnd these guys have a ton of\nbest practices processes.\n\n86\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.310\nAnd if you want, you can even pay them,\n\n87\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.490\nand they'll send consultants out to\nyou to help to make sure that you get\n\n88\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.774\nthe right processes in place\nfrom the very beginning.\n\n89\n00:04:23.774 --> 00:04:26.610\nThen you can always tweak and\nimprove down the road, but\n\n90\n00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.630\nat least you're in the beginning,\nyou've got a great starting point and\n\n91\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.370\nyou got everything that you need,\nall right?\n\n92\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.870\nThat's an example of best practices,\nguidelines, suggestions, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.500\nBut the alternative is a standard.\n\n94\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.260\nAll right now standards can be the same,\na standard can be like a guideline,\n\n95\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.650\na recommendation I can choose\nto follow a standard if I want.\n\n96\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.560\nBut standards actually have a little\nbit of teeth to them, right?\n\n97\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.450\nThat if I want to be compliant\nwith a standard, right?\n\n98\n00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.690\nThe government for you country\nlike here in the United States,\n\n99\n00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.790\nwe have all sorts of laws and\nthings that are in place that\n\n100\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.580\ndictate we have to follow certain\nprocedures if we want to do business.\n\n101\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.160\nAnd if we don't follow those standards\nwe're not allowed to do business.\n\n102\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.540\nThat's a lot different than a best\npractice that we can choose to\n\n103\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.740\nignore, right.\n\n104\n00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.420\nA great example of a standard would\nbe something like ITIL, right?\n\n105\n00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.430\nIn England, the United Kingdom,\ntheir government was dealing with so\n\n106\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.580\nmany IT projects, so\n\n107\n00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.650\nmany of which were failing, because\norganizations weren't following simple\n\n108\n00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.710\nrequirements like keeping documentation,\ndoing proper accounting, right?\n\n109\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.400\nThings that you would assume\na company would do on their own but\n\n110\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.530\nthey just weren't happening, so\n\n111\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.280\nthey created the Information\nTechnology Industry Library, ITIL or\n\n112\n00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.030\nITIL and it defined how an IT\noperation should run, right.\n\n113\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.875\nWhat should be done as far as how you\nprocess help disk tickets, how you monitor\n\n114\n00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:00.380\nsuccess, how you track SLAs,\nhow you do accounting all of that for IT.\n\n115\n00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.830\nAnd what they did is they said,\nwe're gonna standardize this and\n\n116\n00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.710\nif you wanna do business with the British\ngovernment, you will follow ITIL.\n\n117\n00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.350\nAnd if you don't follow ITIL, you can't\ndo business with us, and that's it.\n\n118\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.060\nIt had teeth, not like in best\npractice where it's up to you.\n\n119\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.220\nA standard, there's times when you\nget penalized for not following it.\n\n120\n00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.510\nNow you might just choose to follow\na standard because you know it'll help you\n\n121\n00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.790\nand not actually have any penalty.\n\n122\n00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.430\nWe do that here at IT Pro TV all the time.\n\n123\n00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.780\nThere's a lot of standards we follow\njust because we feel like it,\n\n124\n00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.720\njust because it's a good practice, but\n\n125\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.270\nin the end if we didn't follow\nthat standard we'd still be okay.\n\n126\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.090\nBut there's a lot of people out there\nthat if they don't follow the standard\n\n127\n00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.960\nthey actually get penalized and\nthat would be bad, right, for most people.\n\n128\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.260\nNow, in the standards world there\nare a couple of different organizations\n\n129\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.360\nthat are out there.\n\n130\n00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.760\nThe absolute biggest one, the one you are\ngoing to hear about the most is the ISO,\n\n131\n00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.670\nall right?\n\n132\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.160\nLet me just bring their site up.\n\n133\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.670\nSo, the ISO is basically the International\nOrganization for Standardization.\n\n134\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.890\nNow, I know what you're thinking, right.\n\n135\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.220\nIt's ISO, why is it IOS in the letters?\n\n136\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.030\nThe reason is that their\nprimary language is French, and\n\n137\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.990\nif you were to translate that\ninto French then it would be ISO.\n\n138\n00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.120\nThat's where the acronym comes from.\n\n139\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.540\nThese guys make a ton of standards.\n\n140\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.640\nRonnie, you've been in\nIT as long as I have.\n\n141\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.750\nHave you ever encountered\nany ISO standards?\n\n142\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.095\n>> I've encountered, no, I don't\nremember any really, right off the back.\n\n143\n00:07:27.095 --> 00:07:28.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, not that way.\n\n144\n00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.200\n>> Well,\nthat's what a lot of people think, is,\n\n145\n00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.800\nI've never bumped into an ISO standard.\n\n146\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.390\nBut the reality is, you have.\n\n147\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.350\n>> Right.\n>> And you just don't know it, right?\n\n148\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.920\nThere's things like when you buy a CD,\nright?\n\n149\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.920\nThe file system used on a CD is ISO 9660.\n\n150\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.270\n>> I think so.\n\n151\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.910\n>> So, ISO 9660,\nthat's the standard they released.\n\n152\n00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.330\nThey said if you want to put files on\na CD this is the format you have to use.\n\n153\n00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.830\nAnd if I follow that standard\nI know I can take that CD and\n\n154\n00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.000\nput it other people's computers and\nthey'll be able to read the files.\n\n155\n00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.870\nIf I don't follow the standard, I could\npop my CD in somebody else's computer and\n\n156\n00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.800\nthey can't read it.\n\n157\n00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.820\nRight, there's teeth to that one,\nI need to follow that standard.\n\n158\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.890\nBut they have ISO standards\nthat cover all sorts of stuff.\n\n159\n00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.570\nThere's ISO 9000, which dictates\nhow you should run a business.\n\n160\n00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.640\nIf you open up a business and\nyou're really successful, and\n\n161\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.000\nyou wanna sell your business,\nif you are ISO 9000 certified,\n\n162\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.820\nit shows that you've got a proper\namount of documentation on\n\n163\n00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.380\nhow you did your finances,\nhow you track your assets and inventory.\n\n164\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.764\nAnd so, when you go to sell the company,\n\n165\n00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:36.130\nwhoever's buying it knows they've\ngot the right information.\n\n166\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.360\nIf you're not ISO 9000 certified,\nthat's okay.\n\n167\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.490\nYou don't have to be.\n\n168\n00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.740\nBut now they're gonna wanna do a full\naudit cuz they can't trust that you kept\n\n169\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.000\nthe right documentation and\npaperwork, right?\n\n170\n00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.060\nSo, that's an example of an ISO.\n\n171\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.586\nThere's tons of other ones.\n\n172\n00:08:49.586 --> 00:08:52.790\nISO 20,000 is one that comes to mind.\n\n173\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.358\nBack in the day when I\nfirst got ITIL certified.\n\n174\n00:08:55.358 --> 00:08:56.800\nIs it?\n\n175\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.120\nOh there we go.\n\n176\n00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.170\nWhen I went to get ITIL certified,\nITIL came out of England.\n\n177\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.190\nAnd so here in the US we didn't\nsee a lot of that over here.\n\n178\n00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.800\nYou do now.\n\n179\n00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.350\nNow you see ITIL all over the place,\nbut back then you didn't.\n\n180\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.212\nAnd so anytime you searched for it,\n\n181\n00:09:10.212 --> 00:09:13.449\nyou'd normally find ITIL\nlisted right by ISO-20000.\n\n182\n00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:17.590\nAnd ISO-20000 is information\ntechnology and service management.\n\n183\n00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.200\nIt's related to ITIL, but\n\n184\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.190\nnow it's a standard that's\ndesigned to be more global.\n\n185\n00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.660\nITIL is fine globally like it is, but\n\n186\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.410\nit was really designed by the UK\ngovernment for needs that they had.\n\n187\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.820\nISO 20000 goes a little more global.\n\n188\n00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.860\nThe two are actually compatible too,\nso if you're using ITIL,\n\n189\n00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:40.200\nyou're probably using ISO 20000 also,\nand you just don't know it.\n\n190\n00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.190\nWe see it all the time.\n\n191\n00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.600\nHalf the electronics we use are branded\nwith various ISO standards on them,\n\n192\n00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.240\nthe companies that we work for.\n\n193\n00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.200\nIt's really, really prevalent.\n\n194\n00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.180\nAnd these guys make standards\nthat a lot of governments and\n\n195\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.020\na lot of businesses follow and require.\n\n196\n00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.870\nAnd so if you don't follow these,\n\n197\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.340\nthen you can't do business with\nthose organizations any more.\n\n198\n00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.510\nAnd that's a big deal, right.\n\n199\n00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.453\nSo, the ISO, they're the big one.\n\n200\n00:10:03.453 --> 00:10:06.950\nThey're the global and\nthey cover all sorts of different things,\n\n201\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.770\nfrom running businesses to\nmanufacturing to education, everything.\n\n202\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.510\nThey standardize so\nmuch stuff, it's insane.\n\n203\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.070\nAnd it's a great resource.\n\n204\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.970\nBut there are specialized ones too.\n\n205\n00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.150\nOnes that are a little more focused,\nright?\n\n206\n00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.490\nYou know, I talked about ISO and how it\nwas global and we talked about ITIL and\n\n207\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.150\nhow it was originally just for the UK,\n\n208\n00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:32.218\nwell, speaking of the UK we have,\nit's called a BS.\n\n209\n00:10:32.218 --> 00:10:35.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now in the United States\n\n210\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.452\nthe acronym BS has multiple meanings.\n\n211\n00:10:37.452 --> 00:10:38.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But for\n\n212\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.510\nthese guys it's actually\nthe British Standards right?\n\n213\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.980\nSo British Standards or BS,\nthey created standards,\n\n214\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.730\njust like the ISO, but for the UK.\n\n215\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.340\nRight?\n\n216\n00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.980\nAnd so, a lot of times, you'll have\na standard that will start out as a BS.\n\n217\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.720\nAnd so, it'll have BS2012, or\nsomething like that, as the number.\n\n218\n00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.500\nAnd then, they'll submit it\nto get it ratified with ISO.\n\n219\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.400\nAnd so then, it becomes a global standard.\n\n220\n00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.994\nSo, you'll see some that have multiple\nnames attached to them because they were\n\n221\n00:11:06.994 --> 00:11:11.185\nratified by more than one organization but\nthese guys here they basically\n\n222\n00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:14.783\nhave all sorts of business\nimprovement solutions, and so on.\n\n223\n00:11:14.783 --> 00:11:19.175\nI'm on their United States site but\nit actually did come out of the UK, so\n\n224\n00:11:19.175 --> 00:11:21.989\nif you jump in here and\nflip over to the UK site.\n\n225\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.375\nYou'll see it's the same basic thing,\nbut standards, training, testing,\n\n226\n00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:30.106\nassessment, they've got\nall these different parts\n\n227\n00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.673\nthat are just kind of a part\nof that organization.\n\n228\n00:11:32.673 --> 00:11:37.620\nAnd then notice under standards\nhere ISO 9001, ISO 14001, but\n\n229\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.888\nthen you've got BS 18001.\n\n230\n00:11:39.888 --> 00:11:45.410\nThat's one that hasn't been ratified as\nan ISO standard yet, but you can pretty\n\n231\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.210\nmuch guarantee that that one's going to\nbe moving through that process right now.\n\n232\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.270\nSo, those are some examples\nof standards there also.\n\n233\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.410\nAnd there's one more I want to watch,\n\n234\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:59.270\nI know most of you watching this show are\nIT project managers and in the IT world,\n\n235\n00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:03.780\nthere's one name that your always gonna\nhear, and that's the IEEE, right.\n\n236\n00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:09.610\nThe IEEE really focuses on electronics and\nIT, right.\n\n237\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.225\nAnd their acronym is one\nthat I always screw up.\n\n238\n00:12:12.225 --> 00:12:14.590\nI'll cheat and use my notes here.\n\n239\n00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.840\nThe Institute of Electrical and\nElectronics Engineers.\n\n240\n00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.778\nI screwed up and\nit's written on the paper in front of me.\n\n241\n00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:24.680\nSo, the IEEE,\nwe use their standards all the time.\n\n242\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.045\nIf you've watched any of our networking\nshows, we'll talk about wireless, and\n\n243\n00:12:29.045 --> 00:12:32.016\non a wireless network,\nif you go to the store to buy one,\n\n244\n00:12:32.016 --> 00:12:36.535\nyou'll see where they have 802.11A and\n802.11B, G, N, AC, right?\n\n245\n00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:38.110\nWhat the heck is all that?\n\n246\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:45.923\nWell, the proper way to say it\nis IEEE 802.11b IEEE 802.11ac,\n\n247\n00:12:45.923 --> 00:12:51.551\nand what that is,\nis an IEEE we'll call it a standard.\n\n248\n00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:57.350\n802.11 so 802 being the primary body, 11\nbeing the subsection, and then ac right?\n\n249\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.550\nOr b or g, those are like the paragraphs\nyou jump in and you find that data.\n\n250\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.970\nAnd it explains how that\nwireless standard should work.\n\n251\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:10.150\nAnd if you have two electronic wireless\ndevices that are both certified for\n\n252\n00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.270\nIEEE 802.11 AC, they should be able\nto talk and be compatible, right.\n\n253\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.680\nSo IEEE,\nwe see this one in electronics a lot.\n\n254\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.620\nThe key thing to remember,\nwhen the IEEE standardizes something,\n\n255\n00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.270\nit'll often times become an ISO standard,\nright.\n\n256\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:32.310\nBut, while they're still working on it,\nthey go through an RFC process.\n\n257\n00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.340\nAnd we've talked about RFCs in other\nepisodes as request for comment.\n\n258\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.320\nThey come up with a potential standard and\nthey put it out there for\n\n259\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.530\nfeedback and\nthey say let us know what you think.\n\n260\n00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.510\nAnd as they get feedback back from their\npeople they start to update and adjust and\n\n261\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.760\ncreate that final one.\n\n262\n00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:53.760\nSo, when we run like 80.11 AC wireless,\nit came out prior to that.\n\n263\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.799\nWhat do they call that,\nRonnie, when it comes out?\n\n264\n00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:58.770\nI got preamble stuck in my head,\nbut that's not right.\n\n265\n00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.780\nIt's-\n>> I don't know.\n\n266\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.320\n>> Shoot.\n\n267\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.900\nIt's got a name.\n\n268\n00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.980\nWhen it's a pre-standard, right?\n\n269\n00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.980\n>> Draft is what I think they call it.\n\n270\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.430\n>> Draft, there we go.\n\n271\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.770\nPreamble, I don't know\nwhy I'm thinking of that.\n\n272\n00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.340\nBut draft, so, they have,\n\n273\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.805\nyou'll actually see people selling\nrouters that are 802 to 11AC draft.\n\n274\n00:14:15.805 --> 00:14:16.560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n275\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.630\n>> Well, what they're doing is,\nthey're taking a risk.\n\n276\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.290\nThey're saying, we think our\nhardware will be able to handle it.\n\n277\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.065\nIt'll just be some\nlittle software changes.\n\n278\n00:14:23.065 --> 00:14:24.640\nYou can buy our equipment early.\n\n279\n00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.090\nBut, it might change and\nthat hardware might not work anymore.\n\n280\n00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.880\nI know, when I was growing up,\nmy father had a CB radio.\n\n281\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.290\nAnd, you know, CB is community band.\n\n282\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.900\nHere in the United Sates,\nthe FCC was trying to figure out what\n\n283\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.550\nfrequencies they wanted\nto allow CB to run on.\n\n284\n00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.320\nAnd at the time, there were some\ncompanies that hedged their bets.\n\n285\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.980\nAnd they all right,\nwell we're gonna support bands,\n\n286\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.650\nI'm just gonna make up some numbers here,\nit was like one through 13.\n\n287\n00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:53.410\nAnd when the FCC finally settled\non what was gonna be allowed\n\n288\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.570\nit was one through 11.\n\n289\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.100\nWell my dad had bought one of these CB\nradios that was prior to that, and so\n\n290\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.430\nhe had one through 13.\n\n291\n00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.980\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n292\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.610\nMaybe he has some super\nsecret channels he can use.\n\n293\n00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:05.130\nWell no, and\n\n294\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.150\nthen he has some channels that if\nhe used he'd get in trouble, right?\n\n295\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.740\nAnd he used to turn it on anyway,\nand you hear tow truck drivers and\n\n296\n00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.790\nprivate band that was assigned to those\nand we weren't supposed to have them.\n\n297\n00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.500\nBut that's what happened cuz we\ndidn't follow that standard.\n\n298\n00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.600\nWhoever manufactured that equipment, they\ndidn't wait for the standard to be passed.\n\n299\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.420\nSo, the IEEE do have standards,\nbut you also have RFCs.\n\n300\n00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.050\nSo, you have like RFC 1918 which is\n\n301\n00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:32.160\none that dictates what's a private IP\naddress versus a public IP address.\n\n302\n00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.530\nAnd it can change, if they want, they can\nadd more to it because it's still an RFC.\n\n303\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.790\nIt's not set in stone,\neven though, when was RFC written?\n\n304\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.410\nIt was written like back\nin the early 1980s?\n\n305\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.720\n>> Had to be.\n>> It's an old one, and it's still in RFC.\n\n306\n00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.050\nThat's kind of the funny part is sometimes\nIEEE will let that sit out there.\n\n307\n00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:54.130\nBut it's just a great way to go out and\nfind rules or regulations to follow that,\n\n308\n00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.780\nif you want your technology to\nbe compatible with other people,\n\n309\n00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.880\nyou need to follow.\n\n310\n00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.330\nIt's pretty important.\n\n311\n00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.997\n>> So, when we start taking a look at\nthis, right, the idea of best practices\n\n312\n00:16:02.997 --> 00:16:06.960\nand standards, they are essential to\nour processes that we're talking about,\n\n313\n00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.200\nbecause sometimes we don't\nknow exactly where to begin.\n\n314\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.243\nBy actually saying, all right,\nfor this particular project and\n\n315\n00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:17.129\nwhat I'm gonna be doing finding the best\npractices is probably the easiest place.\n\n316\n00:16:17.129 --> 00:16:21.818\nAnd then of course if you do live in\na potential or a particular potential,\n\n317\n00:16:21.818 --> 00:16:26.296\na particular country may also have\nto follow those practices as well.\n\n318\n00:16:26.296 --> 00:16:30.469\nSo as project managers being familiar with\njust both of them really do help us out\n\n319\n00:16:30.469 --> 00:16:34.600\nwhen we start actually having to\ndeal with these processes as well.\n\n320\n00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.490\nSo, Don, are there any other things that\nwe need to really worry about as far as\n\n321\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.610\nthe standards and best practices?\n\n322\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.250\n>> Not really.\n\n323\n00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.690\nThe ones that we've called\nout are the ones that\n\n324\n00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.130\nPMI is specifically calling\nout on the exam objectives.\n\n325\n00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.700\nSo, we want to make sure\nyou're familiar with those.\n\n326\n00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.920\nBut there are other ones\nthat are out there.\n\n327\n00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.760\nYour industry may be different.\n\n328\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.480\nWe didn't talk about like medical or\nconstruction for example, and\n\n329\n00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:58.470\nthere's different standards that you'll\nhave for those guys, fire code and so on.\n\n330\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:03.610\nThose all come into play and you have the,\nwhat is it, NSTA for National Safety and\n\n331\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.620\nso you get different ones that have\nall their own different standards or\n\n332\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.290\nregulations that you need to follow.\n\n333\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.340\nSo, just be aware of those so\nthat you don't,\n\n334\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.070\nwhen you go to build a process,\nyou don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n335\n00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.410\nYou can go and look at these standards and\n\n336\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.990\nfollow them even optionally, I might\njust choose to follow the standard so\n\n337\n00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.960\nthat I know I'm going to be compatible\nwith other people, knowing that if I don't\n\n338\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.930\nfollow it I'll still be okay, but\nit doesn't hurt to try and stay in line.\n\n339\n00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.380\nBecause who knows, down the road\nI might be required to do that.\n\n340\n00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.752\nAnd it would be better if I\nwas already in that position.\n\n341\n00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:37.840\n>> All right, so in this episode remember\nthat what we actually took a look at is\n\n342\n00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.220\nreally the differences between best\npractices as well as standards.\n\n343\n00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.995\nAnd we also mentioned some of\nthe different standards organizations that\n\n344\n00:17:43.995 --> 00:17:44.809\nyou'll tend to see.\n\n345\n00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:51.750\nThe IEEE, the ISO, the BSI or BS,\nBritish Standard that or other.\n\n346\n00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.710\nAnd then also another one that really\nfocuses and more on the process side,\n\n347\n00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:56.490\nthe CMMI.\n\n348\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.990\nThose are also some of these\nplaces that you can go and\n\n349\n00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.520\ncheck out those different standards and\nthose best practices as well.\n\n350\n00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.760\nSo, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n351\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.090\nSigning off for ITPro TV.\n\n352\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.284\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n353\n00:18:09.284 --> 00:18:10.160\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n354\n00:18:10.160 -->

evening, and\n\n4\n00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:40,190\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,340\nWe are back once again with another\nepisode of project management.\n\n6\n00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,390\nAnd not just another episode,\nan all special final episode.\n\n7\n00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,120\nYep, we are winding things down here for\nthe closing process.\n\n8\n00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,640\nSo, it's a pretty exciting moment,\nright Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,870\n>> It is an exciting moment.\n\n10\n00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,630\nI have tears in my, no I don't.\n\n11\n00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,170\n>> Tears in your beer?\n\n12\n00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,545\n>> Yeah, yeah, tears in my beer.\n\n13\n00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:03,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's right, tears in my beer,\n\n14\n00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,460\nthere you go.\n\n15\n00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,945\n>> All right, well, the closing process.\n\n16\n00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:12,340\nIt is the last process\ngroup tackled by the PMBOK.\n\n17\n00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,525\nActually, I guess I closed my\nPMBOK down so let me fire that up.\n\n18\n00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:16,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n19\n00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,230\nit's also one of the most\nunderrated of the processes.\n\n20\n00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,890\n>> Right.\n>> The one that gets skipped the most and\n\n21\n00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,680\nthat we'll see here is\na little bit dangerous.\n\n22\n00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,496\nWhen your project is moving along, one of\nthe last things we think about is closing,\n\n23\n00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:30,612\nand that's when we wrap everything up,\nwe tie up our loose ends, and\n\n24\n00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:31,880\nwe close the doors.\n\n25\n00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,770\nSo, we only have two process here,\nit's nice and small.\n\n26\n00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,770\nWe got the close project or phase,\nand the close procurements processes.\n\n27\n00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,320\nNow, close procurements,\nthat's talking about contracts.\n\n28\n00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,420\nThere's not a whole ton there.\n\n29\n00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,950\nYou'll find there's not a whole ton up\nhere in closed project phase, either.\n\n30\n00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,830\nThis will probably be our shortest episode\non record, cuz there's just not a ton\n\n31\n00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,960\nhere, and that's part of why this\nprocess group gets ignored so much.\n\n32\n00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,190\nAll right, now the problem we have is if\nyou ignore closing, you can always leave\n\n33\n00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,140\nloose ends in your project, so\nthat's why this is so important.\n\n34\n00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,380\nWe're gonna take a look\nat what's involved.\n\n35\n00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,940\nThe first thing I wanna point\nout is the name of the process.\n\n36\n00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,930\nWe've got the closed project or\nphase, right?\n\n37\n00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,510\nIt didn't use to be like that.\n\n38\n00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,070\nIf you've gotten certified under\nan earlier version of the PMBOK,\n\n39\n00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,610\nthis may have just been\ncalled the closing process.\n\n40\n00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,610\nAnd they added that or phase part to\nremind you that the closing process can be\n\n41\n00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,250\nused not just at the end of your project,\nbut at the end of each phase.\n\n42\n00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,800\nAnd, so\nit's not really closing all together.\n\n43\n00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,670\nYou're closing one phase and\ntransitioning to the next.\n\n44\n00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,140\nSo when we were done with initiating,\nwe would actually close and\n\n45\n00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,970\nthen go to planning.\n\n46\n00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,460\nAnd then, we would close the planning\nphase and then go to executing.\n\n47\n00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,570\nAnd then, we would close executing and\nthen go to full closing and\n\n48\n00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,780\nthen that would be the end.\n\n49\n00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,250\nSo you're actually going into\nthe closing process group several\n\n50\n00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,100\ntimes throughout your project as we\ntransition from phase to phase, right?\n\n51\n00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,870\nAs we move through those\ndifferent stages of our project.\n\n52\n00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,935\nSo that's a little, I guess,\ncounter intuitive based on the name,\n\n53\n00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:09,530\nyou're closing you think\nit's just the very end but\n\n54\n00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,082\nit might be the end of\nan individual phase.\n\n55\n00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:18,040\nAll right, now what is involved in\nthe actual closing of a project or phase?\n\n56\n00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,290\nWell, what we're doing is we're taking any\nloose ends that we have and just wrapping\n\n57\n00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,260\nthem up, by this point, our controlling is\npretty much done all the heavy lifting.\n\n58\n00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,440\nWhen we were controlling, we did things\nlike validating our scope, right.\n\n59\n00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,140\nWe made sure that the deliverables\npeople were providing us with\n\n60\n00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,660\nmet the requirements of our scope.\n\n61\n00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,270\nAnd in our control quality,\nwe were checking there too to make sure we\n\n62\n00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,270\nvalidated our deliverables and then we\nmade accepted deliverables out of it.\n\n63\n00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,350\nSo, by the time we get here,\n\n64\n00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,520\nwe've already received whatever\nit is that we were asking for.\n\n65\n00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,560\nSo if our project was to build a house,\nthe house should be done.\n\n66\n00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,140\n>> Right.\n\n67\n00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,630\n>> Quality control should have happened.\n\n68\n00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,640\nAlready say yep,\nthese are our validated deliverables.\n\n69\n00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,420\nThe validate scope process would\nhave kicked in to say yes,\n\n70\n00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,010\nthis house meets our needs, everything's\non here, we're good to go, all right?\n\n71\n00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,640\nSo our primary input for\n\n72\n00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,410\nclosing the project is going to be\nthe accepted deliverable, right?\n\n73\n00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,250\nBut if we're closing a phase, the\ndeliverable is something different, right?\n\n74\n00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,510\nWhen we wrapped up initiating,\n\n75\n00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,090\nwhat was our primary deliverable there,\na project charter.\n\n76\n00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,920\nThe project charter will what gave\nus authority to be able to move\n\n77\n00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,640\nforward with our project.\n\n78\n00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,260\nIt was the most important document\nin the life of our project and\n\n79\n00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,460\nthat was the deliverable.\n\n80\n00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,450\nSo as an input to closing the phase for\n\n81\n00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,900\ninitiation, it would be\nthat project charter.\n\n82\n00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,530\nIf we don't have that,\nwe're not ready to close initiation.\n\n83\n00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,110\nWe're still in initiation, initiating.\n\n84\n00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,770\nWhen we closed planning,\nwhat was our important thing?\n\n85\n00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,150\nThe project management plan,\n\n86\n00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,160\nwhich is an amalgam of a ton\nof different plans, right?\n\n87\n00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,930\nBut that was our main output.\n\n88\n00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,070\nIf we didn't have our plans, we're not\nready to move out of planning yet.\n\n89\n00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,100\nWe need to stay in there and then when\nwe get into executing, and monitoring,\n\n90\n00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,920\nand controlling our outputs there, are\nthe final accepted deliverables, right?\n\n91\n00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,680\nSo that's what we expect to see.\n\n92\n00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,760\nSo, we have different things coming in\nbased on which phase we're coming from.\n\n93\n00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,841\nAll right, our other inputs are the\nproject manager plan because in the plan\n\n94\n00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:17,300\nwe put how we close this out,\nhow we accept our deliverables.\n\n95\n00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,100\nWe talked about acceptance criteria way\nback probably in episode number one,\n\n96\n00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,130\nmaybe episode number two.\n\n97\n00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,030\nI don't know but,\n\n98\n00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,320\nin one of our earlier episodes,\nwe tackled the acceptance criteria.\n\n99\n00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,740\nHow you know that the project is done.\n\n100\n00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,080\nHow, you as a project manager and whoever\nthe sponsor is, can come to agreement and\n\n101\n00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,100\nsay yes, it's done.\n\n102\n00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,340\nYou've achieved what we wanted to achieve,\nall right.\n\n103\n00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,610\nAnd then, we've got our\norganizational processed assets,\n\n104\n00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,140\nall the other information that's\na part of our company's assets.\n\n105\n00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,740\nNow, our tools and techniques,\n\n106\n00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,720\nsuper straight forward on this one,\nright, because what are we really doing?\n\n107\n00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,440\nWe're looking at those accepted\ndeliverables and saying, are they good.\n\n108\n00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,300\nAre we ready to transition\nto that next phase?\n\n109\n00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,350\nAnd that's it, and the main way to\ndo that is expert judgement, right?\n\n110\n00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,560\nWe use our mind powers,\nour Jedi mind powers,\n\n111\n00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,040\nto evaluate the materials and\nmake sure they meet our needs.\n\n112\n00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,500\nIf they don't, we find out what's\nmissing and we correct it, right?\n\n113\n00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,080\nThat's why this is important to do after\nevery phase, if you're trying to move in\n\n114\n00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,040\nto planning but initiating is not done,\nyou don't have authority for\n\n115\n00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,980\nyour project yet, if you don't have that\ncharter in hand you don't have authority.\n\n116\n00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,180\nSo, you might do a bunch of work and\nplanning which costs money,\n\n117\n00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,420\ntime and money.\n\n118\n00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,820\nAnd then whoever was supposed to\ngive you authority comes in and\n\n119\n00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,680\nsays, wait I didn't authorize this.\n\n120\n00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,800\nWhat are you guys doing?\n\n121\n00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,032\nYou just wasted company time.\n\n122\n00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:36,200\n>> Right.\n>> Right, that's the challenge.\n\n123\n00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,130\nSo we look and we say,\nbased on my expert judgement,\n\n124\n00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,200\nI'm missing these documents, we should\nnot move forward, not until we have them.\n\n125\n00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,300\nNot until we have that\nofficial authorization, right?\n\n126\n00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,440\nAnalytical techniques, same idea there.\n\n127\n00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,890\nWe just need to evaluate and\nensure that is, what is meeting our needs.\n\n128\n00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,590\nAnd, you can use whatever techniques\nare appropriate for that particular phase.\n\n129\n00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,130\nWe'll see that's more important\nin closing procurements.\n\n130\n00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,840\nAnd in meetings, it's a good idea to call\na meeting together with the project team\n\n131\n00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,390\nmembers who are still around and\ncommunicate, to ensure that all the loose\n\n132\n00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,240\nends are tied up cuz they may\nknow of things that you don't.\n\n133\n00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,750\nNow, I made a comment there.\n\n134\n00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,490\nI said, the project team\nmembers that are still around.\n\n135\n00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,280\nIn our human resources management plan,\nwe defined not only how we\n\n136\n00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,760\nacquire our team members, but\nhow we release our team members.\n\n137\n00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,230\nAs you were moving through executing,\n\n138\n00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,470\nthere are times where you no\nlonger need a team member.\n\n139\n00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,040\nThey've wrapped up the last activity\nassigned to them, last work package or\n\n140\n00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,440\nwhatever, and so you're done with them.\n\n141\n00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,730\nMaybe it was a sub-project manager,\nand their sub-project is already done.\n\n142\n00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,835\nWell, you can release them,\nway back in the executing phase,\n\n143\n00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:49,538\nsomewhere in the middle, wherever they\nhappen to be, so they may be gone.\n\n144\n00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:53,090\nThis meeting is gonna be with\nthe team members that are left.\n\n145\n00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,813\nIf we had a project building a house.\n\n146\n00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:59,927\nJust because the house is done,\ndoesn't mean we've released everybody.\n\n147\n00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:03,127\nWe're still going to be holding on\nto some employees, at a minimum,\n\n148\n00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:06,052\nthe project manager, and\nusually an accountant of some sort,\n\n149\n00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,220\nbecause you're still settling financials.\n\n150\n00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,330\nYou'll still have some stakeholders\nhanging around the sponsor in particular,\n\n151\n00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,070\nso there'll still be at least\na handful of people that are attached\n\n152\n00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,140\nto the project by the time\nyou reach this point.\n\n153\n00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,130\nYou may have a lot of people, right,\n\n154\n00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,960\nIf you're holding them\nto do final acceptance.\n\n155\n00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,730\nNASA's a great example of that.\n\n156\n00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,150\nWhen they launch that rocket into space,\na lot of the team members are already done\n\n157\n00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,620\nwith their work, but\nthey stick around to see it done.\n\n158\n00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,410\nYou know, it's been a ten year project,\nlet's see the final result.\n\n159\n00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,137\nSo you may still have all of your\nteam members, it just depends.\n\n160\n00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:38,710\nNow, we have that meeting.\n\n161\n00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,030\nAnd based on the results of it,\n\n162\n00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,390\nif everyone is in agreement that\nthe phase has reached its goals or\n\n163\n00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,870\nthe project as a whole has reached its\ngoals and the sponsor signs off on it.\n\n164\n00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,510\nThey accept the deliverable.\n\n165\n00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,450\nThey say yes this is what I want and\nwe are all done.\n\n166\n00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,990\nThen we're ready to wrap up, and so\nour output is the final product.\n\n167\n00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,890\nThe final product is what\nwe set out to create.\n\n168\n00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,842\nIt could be a service, not a product,\nor it could be a transition.\n\n169\n00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:07,260\nRight.\nAnd by transition,\n\n170\n00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,870\nthis is at the end of a phase.\n\n171\n00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,440\nSo we transition from\ninitiating to planning or\n\n172\n00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,430\nwe transition from planning to executing,\nright, but\n\n173\n00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,050\nif it's the end of the project,\nwe have the final product or service.\n\n174\n00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,490\nThat's what comes out of this.\n\n175\n00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,770\nYou'll also have organizational process\nasset updates, or paperwork and\n\n176\n00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,535\nother documents.\n\n177\n00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:30,040\nSo things like where the sponsor signs\noff to say, yes, I got what I want.\n\n178\n00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,960\nI'm happy.\n\n179\n00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,820\nYou have no more obligation to me.\n\n180\n00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,860\nThe project as far as I,\nthe sponsor, am concerned is over.\n\n181\n00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,520\nNow, just because the sponsor says\nit's over doesn't mean the project is\n\n182\n00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,020\nactually over.\n\n183\n00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,980\nYou still have paperwork,\nyou still have stuff to do.\n\n184\n00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,910\nIf you're done with the remainder of your\nteam members, you need to release them.\n\n185\n00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,030\nAnd that means either going\nback to the PMO and saying,\n\n186\n00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,660\nhey these team members are now available.\n\n187\n00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,040\nOr going to their functional managers and\nsaying hey we're done with these guys,\n\n188\n00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,080\nyou can have them back, back to full time\nor whatever, we don't need them anymore.\n\n189\n00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,200\nYou normally will accompany\nthat with a review.\n\n190\n00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,020\nAn evaluation of that\nemployee's performance.\n\n191\n00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,610\nAs you release the team members,\nyou let their functional manager or\n\n192\n00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,110\nyou let the PMO know how they\nperformed on the project.\n\n193\n00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,190\nDid they do a great job?\n\n194\n00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,530\nWould you recommend them again?\n\n195\n00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,190\nWhat were your lessons learned?\n\n196\n00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,320\nAnd they don't call that out\nspecifically as an output here.\n\n197\n00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,240\nBut that's one of the big things\nthat will come out of closing,\n\n198\n00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,900\nis that you will create a lessons learned.\n\n199\n00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,690\nYou should have been building\nthat all throughout your project.\n\n200\n00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,440\nYour issue log is really what feeds that.\n\n201\n00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,430\nAnd so, it will have all the things\nthat didn't quite go as planned, right?\n\n202\n00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,750\nThat there's some reason.\n\n203\n00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,190\nWe wanna explain what that reason was,\n\n204\n00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,760\nabout why things didn't go right, what we\ndid to fix it, how we got beyond that.\n\n205\n00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,290\nSo that we can add that to our\nOrganizational Process Assets, and\n\n206\n00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,390\nour other project managers can look to\nthat and benefit from our experience, and\n\n207\n00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,250\nwe can do the same with their projects.\n\n208\n00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,400\nWe look at their data, and\nwe learn and benefit there too.\n\n209\n00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,380\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of times\nin this particular process,\n\n210\n00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,690\nit's very important during the phases\nto make sure that we close them out.\n\n211\n00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,090\nAnd the reason why, right, is because if\nwe just go, OK, we're done with this phase\n\n212\n00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,790\nand we go and we release employees and\ndon't even think about it, and now all\n\n213\n00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,660\nof a sudden somebody comes out and goes,\nwait a minute, we're not quite done yet.\n\n214\n00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,750\nThere's a possibility that people that are\nworking on our project are now assigned to\n\n215\n00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,690\nother things.\n\n216\n00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,430\nAnd now we can't call them back in, and\n\n217\n00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,090\nnow we're actually under more\nconstraints than we realize.\n\n218\n00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,800\nSo closing out of every phase here,\nmaking sure that we do this properly.\n\n219\n00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,950\nSo we go, I didn't know you'd\nreassigned that to somebody else.\n\n220\n00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,550\nWell, too late now.\n\n221\n00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,310\nSo that's why making sure that\nthis is done, so along the way,\n\n222\n00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,070\nthis is more important than we think.\n\n223\n00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,540\nYeah.\n>> Yeah and as you release the employees,\n\n224\n00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,210\nthe last employee to be released\nis the project manager.\n\n225\n00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,170\n>> You, yeah.\n>> You're the last person to be released,\n\n226\n00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,480\nso you wanna make sure that you've\nwrapped up all of your loose ends.\n\n227\n00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,220\nNow.\n\n228\n00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,680\nOne big area that we have, that this\ndoesn't really reflect, are our contracts.\n\n229\n00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,850\n>> Yep.\n>> Contracts have a way of living on\n\n230\n00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,980\nbeyond the project, right?\n\n231\n00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,270\nSo, when you write a contract one of\nthe main things is your statement of work.\n\n232\n00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,575\nWhat work needs to be done?\n\n233\n00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:03,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n234\n00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,310\n>> And\nassuming that the contractor does the work\n\n235\n00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,980\n>> Then it meets the statement of work.\n\n236\n00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,100\nEverything's done, the project is over or\nthe contract is over, right?\n\n237\n00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,520\nWell, you still have that whole issue\nof billing and paying and so on.\n\n238\n00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,600\nSo if the payment is late,\nthen there's penalties.\n\n239\n00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,100\nI've seen this before where you\ncontract with somebody for $10,000.\n\n240\n00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,020\n>> And then what happens is\nthe payment ends up late, and\n\n241\n00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,760\nthey assess an interest fee because of it.\n\n242\n00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,140\nSo when you do pay the $10,000,\n\n243\n00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,670\nit turns out there was another\n$25 in interest charge.\n\n244\n00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,430\nBut you didn't pay that,\n\n245\n00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,870\nyou paid the $10,000, now there's\nthis outstanding charge of 25 bucks.\n\n246\n00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,440\nAnd it's not a lot of money.\n\n247\n00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,030\nBut it kicks around, coming back to you\nevery 30 days you get a notification.\n\n248\n00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,850\n>> Yep.\n>> Eventually, they send\n\n249\n00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,500\nyou to collections, things like that.\n\n250\n00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,620\nAnd while your project is over,\nyou've released all these employees\n\n251\n00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,220\nthere's this outstanding debt that's\nnow turning into a legal liability.\n\n252\n00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,350\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> You know, that turns into a big mess.\n\n253\n00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,530\nSo, our contracts have a dedicated\nprocess specifically for that.\n\n254\n00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,720\nAnd that is the close procurements.\n\n255\n00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,350\nAll right?\n\n256\n00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,270\nAnd it's really common sense.\n\n257\n00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,380\nWe take our project management plan and\nour procurement documents, right?\n\n258\n00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,870\nSo, our actual contracts.\n\n259\n00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,165\nAnd then we just do an audit.\n\n260\n00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:13,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n261\n00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,090\n>> We look at the contract, we do\nan audit to see if it's been fulfilled.\n\n262\n00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,740\nIf it's fulfilled,\nwe terminate the contract.\n\n263\n00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,150\nWe close it down.\n\n264\n00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,780\nIt's over and it's done.\n\n265\n00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,780\nAnd it's extremely important\nthat you write a letter.\n\n266\n00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,910\nNot a phone call.\n\n267\n00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,108\nNot a conversation in the hallway,\n\n268\n00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:35,510\nwrite a letter to the other party\nsaying this bill has been paid in full.\n\n269\n00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,080\nYou guys did exemplary work.\n\n270\n00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,150\nOr you guys did terrible work.\n\n271\n00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,940\nWhatever.\n\n272\n00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,410\nYou guys did work and\nwe've accepted the deliverable, and\n\n273\n00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,200\nthis contract is now closed.\n\n274\n00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,810\nBy sending that to them,\nyou're giving them in\n\n275\n00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,500\nno uncertain terms the fact that\nyou think the contract is closed.\n\n276\n00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,370\nIf they think otherwise,\nthey'll let you know.\n\n277\n00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,450\nThis is our way of being sure.\n\n278\n00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,690\nAnd get confirmation from them.\n\n279\n00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,820\nThat they're in agreement too\nthat the contract is closed.\n\n280\n00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,310\nYou've paid the invoice,\nit's over and it's closed.\n\n281\n00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,580\nYou wanna make sure you get that in\nwriting so that three months from now,\n\n282\n00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,850\nsix months, a year from now, if they\ncome back and they say wait a minute,\n\n283\n00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,870\nthis isn't right.\n\n284\n00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,480\nYou can say look,\n\n285\n00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,990\n\"We told you it was closed you\ntold us it was closed.\" It's done.\n\n286\n00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,430\nThat's water under the bridge and\nnow we move on.\n\n287\n00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,100\nIt helps to make sure that that contract\ndoesn't come back to haunt you and\n\n288\n00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,695\nin a project, remember that projects are\nnot designed to be unending tasks, right?\n\n289\n00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:34,360\nBecause you have your project stuff, and\nthen you have your regular run of the mill\n\n290\n00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,480\nwork that's going on at your office,\nyour ongoing activities.\n\n291\n00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,140\nA project should never be unending.\n\n292\n00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,490\nSo, when we draft contracts for\nour project, they should always\n\n293\n00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,950\nterminate within the time of the project,\nbut there are exceptions.\n\n294\n00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,080\nA lot of times, that contract that you\nenter into might include a warranty.\n\n295\n00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,633\n>> So while you are getting somebody to\ncome and pour the foundation, they say,\n\n296\n00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,490\nwe will warrant that foundation for\nten years.\n\n297\n00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,570\nIf any defects in the foundation occur,\nwe'll fix it on our tab.\n\n298\n00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,122\nWell, the project for building that\nhouse might only take a year, so\n\n299\n00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:10,210\nyour involvement in the contract\nis just in that first year.\n\n300\n00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,050\nIt's done, foundation's poured, house\nis built, house is sold, and it's gone.\n\n301\n00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,230\nBut there's nine more years\nof warranty sticking around.\n\n302\n00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,720\nSo the contract is still alive,\neven though the project is over.\n\n303\n00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,750\nSo you need to plan for that.\n\n304\n00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,710\nThat's part of closing the procurements,\n\n305\n00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,875\nis that we will need to change\nwho the point of contact is.\n\n306\n00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,100\nRight.\n\n307\n00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,880\nYou, as the project manager, aren't\nattached to that house anymore, right.\n\n308\n00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,740\nSo you don't need to be the point\nof contact for that warranty.\n\n309\n00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,400\nIt needs to change to\nwhoever the owner is.\n\n310\n00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,070\nOr the functional manager, whoever it\nis that's going to be responsible for\n\n311\n00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,180\nthat entity,\nthey become the person who runs that.\n\n312\n00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,430\nYou see this in like automotive plants.\n\n313\n00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,625\nYou might have a project to design\nthe new assembly line procedures for,\n\n314\n00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,840\nwhat car were we using the Ford Focus?\n\n315\n00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,509\nSo you're designing the 2015\nFord Focus assembly line right?\n\n316\n00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,363\nWell your project builds\nthe assembly line, that's done.\n\n317\n00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:02,521\nNow the assembly line has to kick in and\nwork.\n\n318\n00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:04,797\nAnd they'll manufacture that car for\nan entire year, and\n\n319\n00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,340\nthey'll make hundreds of\nthousands of that vehicle.\n\n320\n00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,672\nWell, for that remaining year, you don't\nneed to be the point of contact for\n\n321\n00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:13,130\nall that equipment and\nservice and maintenance.\n\n322\n00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,610\nYou plan for it, but\nyou don't need to be the point of contact.\n\n323\n00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,790\nIt now transitions over to\nthe functional managers,\n\n324\n00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,490\nthe people who are actually going to be\noperating that equipment on a daily basis.\n\n325\n00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,890\nSo, that's part of\nclosing our procurements,\n\n326\n00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,040\nis wrapping up that stuff, too.\n\n327\n00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,800\nSo the contract may live on, but\nyou're not tied to it anymore.\n\n328\n00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,900\nYour project is no longer tied to it.\n\n329\n00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,870\nSo we have to audit any contracts\nto look for areas like that,\n\n330\n00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,630\nareas where stuff continues to\nbe on the end of the project.\n\n331\n00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:45,010\n>> A lot of times these audits also reveal\nwhere you thought that the contract, when\n\n332\n00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,863\nit was developed during planning or during\nthe initiation here, we said this is rock\n\n333\n00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:52,240\nsolid, and then as you start carrying the\nprocess through, you might say this was\n\n334\n00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,460\nreally not something we really needed\nto include in here, and this is good.\n\n335\n00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,510\nAgain, it goes into those lessons learned.\n\n336\n00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,560\nSo doing this particular auditing\nis a very important process for\n\n337\n00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,105\nus, especially into the future.\n\n338\n00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n339\n00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,940\nAnd at this time, if there's anything\nextra that we want to negotiate in,\n\n340\n00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,820\nwe've got our procurement negotiations.\n\n341\n00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,120\nYou may wanna extend\nthat warranty beyond or\n\n342\n00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,580\nwhatever other types of services\nyou might wanna provide.\n\n343\n00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,220\nMaybe there's some features you tried\nto add before, and they said you know,\n\n344\n00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,980\nlet's push that off to another project.\n\n345\n00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,050\nWell, we can start to kick\nsome of that off, but\n\n346\n00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,340\nyou do not want to initiate a new\nproject inside of this one.\n\n347\n00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,710\nIt does need to be a separate project.\n\n348\n00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,720\nSo those negotiations can happen and\n\n349\n00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,750\nkinda start here but\nnot to be a part of the project.\n\n350\n00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,120\nYour records management\nsystem is gonna be important.\n\n351\n00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,550\nYou need to save a copy of every contract.\n\n352\n00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,960\nEvery single contract that you sign,\n\n353\n00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,910\nyou should save a copy because\nthe project is over, right?\n\n354\n00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,590\nBut if something ever resurfaces down\nthe road, you start getting sent into\n\n355\n00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,030\ncollections for some reason, you need to\nbe able to go and pull the record of that.\n\n356\n00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,790\nSo your records management system is\nwhere we're going to store that, right?\n\n357\n00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,380\nOur final outputs, well,\na closed procurement.\n\n358\n00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,411\nThe contract, when it's been terminated,\nwhen it's over,\n\n359\n00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,260\nis called a closed procurement.\n\n360\n00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,830\nSo we want to stamp that\nright on the front closed.\n\n361\n00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,720\nContract is over, no more liabilities or\noutstanding debts or\n\n362\n00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,550\nanything like that exist on the contract.\n\n363\n00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,330\nIt's now part of history, and it goes\ninto our organizational process assets.\n\n364\n00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,440\nSo that's where that ends up.\n\n365\n00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,808\nWhen the last contract is closed and\nall of our objectives have been met and\n\n366\n00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,966\nour sponsor signs off on the deliverable\nand everything is complete,\n\n367\n00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:29,427\nthat's the point where you,\nas the product manager, release yourself.\n\n368\n00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:30,042\nRight.\n\n369\n00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:34,526\n>> And now you go back into the PMO pool\nor out into the job market if that's\n\n370\n00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:39,680\nthe kind of contract you were on, and\nyou move on to your next project, right?\n\n371\n00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,200\nThis becomes a part of your history.\n\n372\n00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,130\nNow, it is recommend that\nyou create a very good\n\n373\n00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,540\ndocument collection of your project.\n\n374\n00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,350\n>> Right.\n>> And one of the things that I do is\n\n375\n00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,230\nI create, I call it my project book.\n\n376\n00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,970\nAnd so when the project is done,\nyou collect your plan and\n\n377\n00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,840\nall of your other paperwork, your quotes,\nyour RFQs, RFPs, all that other stuff, and\n\n378\n00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,430\nyou collect it together\ninto one big fat document.\n\n379\n00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,880\nIt might be electronic, mine usually are,\njust a bunch of PDFs, or\n\n380\n00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,750\nit might be a physical book\nthat you can hold on to.\n\n381\n00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,530\nWhen it's done, though, just be aware that\nthat project book is not your property.\n\n382\n00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,050\nIt's the property of the company\nthat you performed the project for.\n\n383\n00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,110\nSo if you leave that company and go work\nsomewhere else, do not take that project\n\n384\n00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,780\nwith you to use as a template, to say I'll\njust use this and mirror it for this next\n\n385\n00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,650\nproject because it's full of information\nthat pertains to the other company.\n\n386\n00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,320\nSo understanding the intellectual property\nrights of the data that you generate with\n\n387\n00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,030\na project is really important from\nthe ethics side of things, and\n\n388\n00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,550\nyou may see questions on\nthe exam regarding that.\n\n389\n00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n390\n00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,220\n>> Alright, so when that's done,\nwe basically double-back to our closed\n\n391\n00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,570\nproject or phase, and we ensure that\neverything's wrapped up, right?\n\n392\n00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,960\nAgain, using our expert judgment,\nwe have any final meetings that we need to\n\n393\n00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,700\nhave with the sponsor,\nwith any other key stakeholders,\n\n394\n00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,040\nanybody who needs to be involved, and\nnow, we're ready to shut it down.\n\n395\n00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,653\nNow, they used to actually call\nout celebrate in here, and\n\n396\n00:19:58,653 --> 00:19:59,656\nthey did remove that.\n\n397\n00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,861\nBut it doesn't mean you can't, right?\n\n398\n00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:05,135\nA lot of people do have an end of project\ncelebration just to show hey, we did it.\n\n399\n00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:07,919\nWe wrapped it up,\nyou know an awards ceremony recognition,\n\n400\n00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,883\nI think we did see that\nin another process,\n\n401\n00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:14,290\nbut you know, that's the kind of thing\nthat happens at the end of the project.\n\n402\n00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:19,305\nNow your project might have been a very\nshort one like our arcade cabinet\n\n403\n00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:20,240\nbuild-out project, right?\n\n404\n00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,890\nThat's just a couple of weeks, or it\nmight be a massive project like launching\n\n405\n00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,920\nthe Mars Rover and exploring Mars\nwhere it's expanded over 15 years now.\n\n406\n00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,740\nProjects vary in size.\n\n407\n00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,490\nSo this closing phase could be very\ndrawn out, could be very protracted\n\n408\n00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,210\nif you've got a lot to wrap up,\nif you've got a ton of contracts.\n\n409\n00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,560\nYou might have to get lawyers involved\nbefore you close things down.\n\n410\n00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,120\n>> Yeah.\n\n411\n00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,740\n>> That is not uncommon.\n\n412\n00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,990\nBut in small and medium size projects,\nclosing is usually the blink of an eye.\n\n413\n00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,250\nThe risk here is if we don't do it,\n\n414\n00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,940\nthere's two main risks that\nthey call out in the pinby.\n\n415\n00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,750\nRisk number one is that the sponsor might\nnot be satisfied with what they get.\n\n416\n00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,400\nSo you think the project is over,\n\n417\n00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,830\nyou wrap it up, and three months later\nthe sponsor's like this isn't right,\n\n418\n00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,850\nthis isn't right, this isn't right,\nyou need to fix it.\n\n419\n00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,420\nWell, you don't have your team anymore.\n\n420\n00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,090\nEverything's torn down, and\nnow you've got a problem.\n\n421\n00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,230\nAnd the other side is\noutstanding contracts, right?\n\n422\n00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,650\nSo you have procurements that\nare still active that got overlooked.\n\n423\n00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,190\nPayments didn't get issued.\n\n424\n00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,060\nThis is, I mentioned it earlier, you tell\nthe accounting department to cut a check,\n\n425\n00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,349\nbut if you don't follow up,\n\n426\n00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:25,300\nyou don't actually know if\nthe check got issued or not.\n\n427\n00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,389\nAnd so you might have something going\nto collections, your project is over,\n\n428\n00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:29,148\nyou walk away, and\n\n429\n00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:32,300\nnow the accounting department is dealing\nwith a bill they don't understand.\n\n430\n00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,080\nThat's the kind of thing that can happen.\n\n431\n00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,350\nSo closing is very important, right?\n\n432\n00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,190\nAll that being said, though, it does make\nup a very small portion of the final exam.\n\n433\n00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,500\nBecause, well you guys see right here,\n\n434\n00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,710\nwe've got a maximum of three\nvalues in each of these.\n\n435\n00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,790\nIt is not a giant process area,\nyou know, so.\n\n436\n00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,290\n>> Yep.\n\n437\n00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,210\n>> All right, but\n\n438\n00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,190\nwith that, that is the final\ninformation involved in the PMP exam,\n\n439\n00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,030\nthe Project Management Professional exam,\nso it's now time for us to wrap that up.\n\n440\n00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,570\n>> It is.\n\n441\n00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,900\n>> We need to go into our closing phase.\n\n442\n00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,970\n>> Yes we do.\n>> Do we have any outstanding contracts?\n\n443\n00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,905\n>> Probably just mine.\n\n444\n00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:08,450\n>> [LAUGH] I don't think we're\ngonna pay you anymore, Ronnie, so\n\n445\n00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,210\nwe'll see how that works out.\n\n446\n00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,310\nSo that's basically it.\n\n447\n00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,206\nKeep in mind, if you have any questions\non any of this cuz it was a ton,\n\n448\n00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:20,550\nI mean we really went from\ninitiating all the way into closing,\n\n449\n00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,373\nif you have questions on any of it,\ndefinitely make sure you ask.\n\n450\n00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,017\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n451\n00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:27,440\nYou can go to itpro.tv/live\nif we're recording a show.\n\n452\n00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,080\nWell, we're kinda wrapping this one up,\nbut if we're live,\n\n453\n00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,590\nyou can post right in the chat\nroom beneath the video.\n\n454\n00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,560\nIf you have questions about anything else,\nuse the Q&A forums.\n\n455\n00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,736\n>> Right.\n>> Jump right in there.\n\n456\n00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:40,545\nYou'll see the link that says Q&A\nat the top of all of our pages.\n\n457\n00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:41,461\nIt takes you into the forums.\n\n458\n00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,828\nYou can post your questions there and\nanswers.\n\n459\n00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,489\nWe monitor.\n\n460\n00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:46,630\nAnd so definitely take advantage of that.\n\n461\n00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,400\nIt is there for you.\n\n462\n00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,470\nI feel like I'm leaving something out.\n\n463\n00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,450\nWhat am I leaving out?\n\n464\n00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,270\n>> I don't, I can't think of anything.\n\n465\n00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,030\n>> All right, well, let me just give\nyou guys a couple of words of advice.\n\n466\n00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,440\nFirst off, make sure you study hard.\n\n467\n00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,850\nIf you haven't already,\nI would get a copy of the PMBOK.\n\n468\n00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,588\nIf you just buy it outright,\nit's fairly expensive.\n\n469\n00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,380\nI recommend you join the PMI.\n\n470\n00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,870\nIf you join\nthe Project Management Institute,\n\n471\n00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,460\nthe one year membership fee will\nget you a free copy of the PMBOK,\n\n472\n00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,080\nwhich is already worth it\n>> Right.\n\n473\n00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,850\n>> But the other thing is it will\nget you discount on the exam\n\n474\n00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:26,100\nthat effectively pays for the one year of\nmembership, so you save money by doing it.\n\n475\n00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,360\nSo I really do encourage you to do that.\n\n476\n00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960\nYou also get access to webinars and\n\n477\n00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,430\nall sorts of other things that\nhelp you to expand your knowledge.\n\n478\n00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,390\nBut that PDF copy of\nthe PMBOK is really handy.\n\n479\n00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,170\nNow, I've referred to it\nall throughout the show.\n\n480\n00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:41,710\nJust remember that the PMBOK is not\narranged in chronological order.\n\n481\n00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,810\nIt's not arranged in\nthe order a project executes.\n\n482\n00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,760\nSo we did that during the show\ncuz it makes more sense, right?\n\n483\n00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,700\nBut if you break open\ntheir table of contents,\n\n484\n00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,670\nyou'll see where it's\norganized by knowledge area.\n\n485\n00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:57,420\nSo all of the scope management\nstuff is right there.\n\n486\n00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,020\nLet me jump down a little further.\n\n487\n00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,080\nSo you'll get all of\nthe scheduling is in one place.\n\n488\n00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,800\nThe planning for scheduling, the execution\nfor scheduling, the monitoring/controlling\n\n489\n00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,630\nfor scheduling, and the closing for\nscheduling all right in one chapter.\n\n490\n00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,210\nAnd so if it basically does the life\ncycle of a project from that perspective.\n\n491\n00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:20,330\nAnd if you're trying to get the whole\npicture, that gets a little confusing.\n\n492\n00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,200\nBut if you're a team member and\nall you care about is the schedule,\n\n493\n00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,710\nthat's actually a good way to arrange it.\n\n494\n00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,710\nYou can read right through there and\njust see what you want.\n\n495\n00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,110\nSo depending on your need,\nthat may be very valuable.\n\n496\n00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,600\nThe PMBOK is designed to be a reference\nthat you grab off the shelf to look up\n\n497\n00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,890\nsomething real quick.\n\n498\n00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,920\nIt's not designed to be a textbook\nyou read cover to cover,\n\n499\n00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,930\nso, that's one of\nthe challenges of learning.\n\n500\n00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,190\nBut I do recommend it, especially since\nit's where the test questions come from,\n\n501\n00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,180\nthis and the code of conduct\nthat you can download from PMI.\n\n502\n00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,980\nWe posted links way back in\nEpisode Number One on how to get that.\n\n503\n00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,990\nAlthough there's another one.\n\n504\n00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,860\nIf you sign up for the PMI, they actually\nsend you a copy of the code of conduct,\n\n505\n00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,660\nthe code of ethics.\n\n506\n00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,570\nSo you'll get a paper copy of that.\n\n507\n00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,390\nIt's six, seven pages.\n\n508\n00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's not very big.\n\n509\n00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,070\nYou can read it in one\nsitting pretty easy.\n\n510\n00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,170\nAll right.\nWell Ronnie, I think that's it.\n\n511\n00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,540\n>> I think that's it.\n>> It's been a long road, but we made it.\n\n512\n00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,010\nSo, alright well ladies and gentlemen,\n\n513\n00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,320\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show,\nsigning off for itpro.tv, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n514\n00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,270\n>> and I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n515\n00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,962\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n516\n00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:30,962\n[MUSIC]\n\n517\n00:25:33,215 -->

00:00:17.715\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ntaking a look at the project management\n\n4\n00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:22.635\nprofessionals exam objectives, and\nwho better to help us than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:23.415\nHow's it going, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:27.525\n>> It is going great, Ronnie, and\nI know what you guys are thinking.\n\n7\n00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:31.235\nExam objectives, I don't want to watch\nthis, but let's approach it from\n\n8\n00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:34.630\na slightly different angle and\nnot think of them as exam objectives.\n\n9\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.030\nWhen the PMI builds the exam that you're\ngoing to be taking, what they do is,\n\n10\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.710\nthey don't think of it in terms\nof straight out of the Pin-Bot.\n\n11\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.590\nThey don't think of it in terms of\nthis process group, or that process,\n\n12\n00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.890\nthis tool or technique.\n\n13\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.320\nWhat they do is they\nthink of it in terms of,\n\n14\n00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.010\nhow are you going to\napply this in real life?\n\n15\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.750\nAnd so what they do is they basically\ntake your role as a project manager and\n\n16\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.550\nthey break it down into what they call,\ntasks.\n\n17\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.090\nIt's easy to confuse with\nthe tasks that we schedule,\n\n18\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.170\nthe activities that we schedule,\ninside of a project, but\n\n19\n00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.070\nthey're tasks that you perform as part\nof your job as a project manager.\n\n20\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.600\nAnd so, when they create their exam\nobjectives, it's really just a laundry\n\n21\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.210\nlist of the stuff you do every day, and\nwhat you need to know to do it, right?\n\n22\n00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.090\nSo it's not as bad as some other exams\nthat are out there where we have\n\n23\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.410\nthis huge outline of a ton of crazy\nthings that don't make a lot of sense.\n\n24\n00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.510\nThis one you can read down the list like,\nall right, well, I do that,\n\n25\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.580\nI do that, I do that, too,\nand here's how I do it.\n\n26\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.700\nHere's the things that I use to do it.\n\n27\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.470\nSo, I wanna just spend some time to go\nover that outline that they provide,\n\n28\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.770\nto make sure you guys understand\nhow that process works.\n\n29\n00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.110\nNow, this is completely optional.\n\n30\n00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.970\nIf you've watched every other episode, and\n\n31\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.590\nyou're comfortable with all the material,\nyou can skip this episode.\n\n32\n00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.460\nYou'll do just fine on the exam.\n\n33\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.270\nBut if you're trying to correlate the\nstuff that we talked about in all of our\n\n34\n00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.450\nepisodes with the official exam outline,\nit can be a little challenging sometimes,\n\n35\n00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.170\nand that's what this episode\nis designed to help with.\n\n36\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.350\nIt's to show you how\nthat connection works.\n\n37\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.800\nSo let's start at the beginning\nwith project initiation, right,\n\n38\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.200\nthe initiating phase of a project.\n\n39\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.160\nAnd what I did is I took\nthe PMI's exam outline, and\n\n40\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.670\nI just turned it into some simple tables\nthat I could bring up here on the screen.\n\n41\n00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.020\nAnd we'll kind of run through\nthose different tasks.\n\n42\n00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.510\nSo, let's take a look at that here.\n\n43\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.780\nAnd what I've got here is\nDomain 1: Initiating, right.\n\n44\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.550\nSo when we do project initiation,\nthis is where the project kicks off.\n\n45\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.450\nAnd the PMI has identified\neight different tasks\n\n46\n00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.090\nthat a project manager may\nundertake as a part of that, right.\n\n47\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.780\nAnd most of these are pretty\nself-explanatory, right.\n\n48\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.910\nWe need to perform a project assessment\nbased upon available information.\n\n49\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.680\nWhat does that mean?\n\n50\n00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.810\nAll right, well,\nif you're about to do a project,\n\n51\n00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.440\nyou kinda need to know what the project\nis, how you're gonna move forward with it,\n\n52\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.900\nwhat you need to do,\nwhat are your responsibilities?\n\n53\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.960\nAnd where do you find\nall that information?\n\n54\n00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.020\nYou find it from lessons\nlearned in previous projects.\n\n55\n00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.670\nYou find it from meetings\nwith relevant stakeholders.\n\n56\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.240\nYou find it from your evaluations,\n\n57\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.440\nyour feasibility evaluations,\nif they've been done.\n\n58\n00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.610\nThey may not have been done at this point.\n\n59\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.500\nSo you find it from all the information\nthat's basically laying around your\n\n60\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.390\ncompany that kicked off this project,\nright.\n\n61\n00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.010\nAnd that's what I mean by when I\nsay this is kinda self-explanatory.\n\n62\n00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.190\nThis stuff just makes sense,\nthese are the tasks that we perform.\n\n63\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.760\nBut from PMI's perspective,\nhow do you do this?\n\n64\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.710\nWell, they break it down in their\nobjectives based on knowledge,\n\n65\n00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.950\nskills and processes.\n\n66\n00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.070\nSo if I want to gather this information\ntogether I need certain knowledge skills.\n\n67\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.260\nThings like analytical skills.\n\n68\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.740\nI need to be able to\nlook at information and\n\n69\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.790\nanalyze it to be able to use\nit in my own context, right?\n\n70\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.460\nAnd that's a skill that we develop as we\nunderstand how our company does business,\n\n71\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.520\nand the resources that\nare available to us.\n\n72\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.700\nBenefit analysis techniques,\nwe covered those in other episodes, right,\n\n73\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.910\nways than we can do cost to\nbenefit analysis, whether or\n\n74\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.430\nnot this actually meets our goals.\n\n75\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.340\nWe can do our scope verification,\n\n76\n00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.400\nall those different pieces that are out\nthere that help us to evaluate whether or\n\n77\n00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.040\nnot this is moving in the right direction,\nright?\n\n78\n00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.110\nElements of a project charter.\n\n79\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.630\nSo when you draft that project charter,\nif you're the one that drafts it, or\n\n80\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.490\nif it's already been drafted,\nwhat each of those pieces mean\n\n81\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.690\nin that charter as far as influencing what\nyou're gonna be doing in the project.\n\n82\n00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.390\nEstimation tools and techniques.\n\n83\n00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.470\nIt's all about estimates at\nthe very beginning of a project.\n\n84\n00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.960\nYou don't have hard data to rely on, so\n\n85\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.820\nyou're trying to estimate\nwhat it's gonna be like,\n\n86\n00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.820\nknowing that we can refine all that in the\nplanning phase and start to nail it down.\n\n87\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.370\nAnd then just strategic management.\n\n88\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.610\nAnd that's strategic management\nof resources, it could be people,\n\n89\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.660\nit could be money,\nit could be the schedule, right?\n\n90\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.290\nIt's strategic management\nof all of that that, and\n\n91\n00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.370\nmaking sure everything moves forward.\n\n92\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.190\nNow, that sounds like a lot\nof stuff because it is.\n\n93\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.080\nBut when you read the PMBOK it doesn't\nsound like a lot of stuff cuz there's only\n\n94\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.440\ntwo processes, develop a project charter,\nand identify stakeholders.\n\n95\n00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.490\nAnd that's it.\n\n96\n00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.590\nAnd we covered those in other episodes.\n\n97\n00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.550\nBut the key thing is that each of these\nhave a number of tools and techniques.\n\n98\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.940\nAnd that's where these knowledge and\nskills come in, are those tools and\n\n99\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.150\ntechniques, right.\n\n100\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.160\nSo all of this comes into play as we\ndo our project assessment, right?\n\n101\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.880\nFigure out what our footing is before\nwe launch off on this big project.\n\n102\n00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.730\nWe identify our key deliverables.\n\n103\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.955\nWe're not gonna need that right away,\nbut we need it before we set a scope.\n\n104\n00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:29.745\nAnd the scope is typically\npart of the charter, so\n\n105\n00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:32.565\nwe do need it before\nwe move into planning.\n\n106\n00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.855\nThere are some projects where they\nmove forward in the planning and\n\n107\n00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:36.215\nthey haven't solidified their scope yet.\n\n108\n00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:39.085\nIt's dangerous, but\nit can be done and it can work out,\n\n109\n00:05:39.085 --> 00:05:40.640\nbut you gotta be really careful with that.\n\n110\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.770\nWe need to know what those key\ndeliverables are because that's\n\n111\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.760\nhow we're gonna measure our success.\n\n112\n00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.960\nIf my key deliverable is,\nmaybe we're in construction,\n\n113\n00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.560\nso to have a house built and ready for\nsale by January 1st, 2017, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.480\nThat's a key deliverable.\n\n115\n00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.230\nI've now got a milestone and a date,\nsomething that I can work towards, and\n\n116\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.590\nI can hit and finish.\n\n117\n00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.870\nAnd I'll know if I've missed it or\nif I'm not gonna make that, right?\n\n118\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.170\nIf I don't have a hard set date,\nI just need to build this house and\n\n119\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.440\nget it ready for\nsale with no hard set date.\n\n120\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.540\nWell, I've got my deliverable, but I don't\nreally have a point of responsibility, and\n\n121\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.840\nso I can start pushing it back and\npushing it back and pushing it back.\n\n122\n00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.810\nAnd, technically, I'm still successful\nin terms of the project, but\n\n123\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.190\nbecause I don't have a hard set date,\nwhoever the stakeholders are are gonna\n\n124\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.240\nstart getting antsy, and\neventually they're gonna become unhappy.\n\n125\n00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.030\nAnd it won't matter if I say, well,\naccording to this paper I'm still okay.\n\n126\n00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.130\nIf they're angry, they're not gonna\ncare about that paper, right.\n\n127\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.410\nSo we've gotta make sure that we\nidentify those key deliverables,\n\n128\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.990\nthat they're based on\nthe business requirements,\n\n129\n00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.650\nthat they make sense in terms\nof customer expectations, and\n\n130\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.490\nmanaging the customer expectations cuz\nthose might change as the project goes on.\n\n131\n00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.040\nThat's always a fun one, right?\n\n132\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.880\nSo, holding them to what we originally\nagreed, or at least representing\n\n133\n00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.930\nwhat a change would require cuz change is\nokay as long as it's properly managed.\n\n134\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.000\nStakeholder analysis, right?\n\n135\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.410\nWe got tons of stakeholder analysis\ntools that are available for\n\n136\n00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.550\nfiguring out how we're gonna communicate\nto them, information they need,\n\n137\n00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.700\ntheir level of influence on the project.\n\n138\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.860\nThat's one you have to be really careful\nwith because sometimes you can have people\n\n139\n00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.150\nthat are really, really vocal, but\n\n140\n00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.030\nthey don't have the authority behind\nthem to actually influence the project.\n\n141\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.680\nBut if we lose sight of that,\nwe can start making changes for\n\n142\n00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.930\nthem that aren't in line with what\nthe original sponsor wanted, right?\n\n143\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.960\nThese are real world things that occur\n\n144\n00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.200\nthat don't specifically line up\nwith a process in the PMBOK,\n\n145\n00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.270\nbut are things that we address as part\nof the communications plan, and so on.\n\n146\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.080\nNumber 4 is a bit of a tricky one,\nidentify high level risks.\n\n147\n00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.070\nNow, the PMI knows that you\nare most likely not a risk manager.\n\n148\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.630\nAnd as a result,\nyou're not gonna jump into some\n\n149\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.430\ngiant risk analysis when you don't\neven have a plan yet, right?\n\n150\n00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.960\nYou haven't even\nsolidified your estimates.\n\n151\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.290\nWell, what they're telling\nme here are high level.\n\n152\n00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.805\nThese are risks that are really obvious.\n\n153\n00:07:55.805 --> 00:08:00.138\nIf your project is gonna be\nan outdoor music festival,\n\n154\n00:08:00.138 --> 00:08:02.410\nyou know that it could rain.\n\n155\n00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.723\nYou know there could be an earthquake.\n\n156\n00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:07.230\nThese risks that are real\nthat are pretty evident.\n\n157\n00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.690\nBut there's other risks that might\nno easily be recognizable, right?\n\n158\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.140\nThere could be sanitation concerns.\n\n159\n00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.650\nThere could be changing regulations.\n\n160\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.600\nThere could be all sorts of other\nstuff that you just don't think about.\n\n161\n00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.400\nAnd we'll find those when we\nactually do the risk assessment and\n\n162\n00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.379\nrisk analysis in the planning phase.\n\n163\n00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.480\nParticipate in the development\nof the project charter.\n\n164\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.057\nThis is one that you may or\nmay not actually be involved in, right?\n\n165\n00:08:32.057 --> 00:08:35.300\nThese tasks,\nyou're not guaranteed to do these tasks.\n\n166\n00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.825\nAs a project manager, you might not\neven be assigned during the initiation.\n\n167\n00:08:38.825 --> 00:08:40.385\nYou might not get assigned until planning,\nand\n\n168\n00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:42.905\nby that point the charters\nare already done, right?\n\n169\n00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:45.265\nSo you didn't have any influence\nin that charter whatsoever.\n\n170\n00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:48.995\nBut if you're involved\nin the initiation phase,\n\n171\n00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:52.935\nthen you're one of the people who's\ngonna be influencing that charter.\n\n172\n00:08:52.935 --> 00:08:53.625\nWhat goes in there?\n\n173\n00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:54.865\nDefining that scope statement.\n\n174\n00:08:54.865 --> 00:08:57.055\nBut at the end of the day,\nyou're not the one who signs it, right?\n\n175\n00:08:57.055 --> 00:09:00.040\nRemember, way back to one of\nthe first episodes we filmed,\n\n176\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.620\nyou are the person who gets\nauthority from the charter, right?\n\n177\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.220\nThat's the main purpose of that\ndocument is to give you authority to do\n\n178\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.310\nthe project.\n\n179\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.230\nIt's the sponsor that's\ngranting you that authority, so\n\n180\n00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.750\nthey're the one that signs it.\n\n181\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.595\nYou participate in the development,\nyou don't actually draft it.\n\n182\n00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:18.705\nNow, in real life land, there's plenty\nof times where you draft the charter.\n\n183\n00:09:18.705 --> 00:09:20.495\nYou get that sponsor who\nwants the project but\n\n184\n00:09:20.495 --> 00:09:24.955\nthey don't want the paperwork,\nuntil you draft it, they sign it, right?\n\n185\n00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:27.595\nWe'll call that participating, even\nthough you're doing all the hard work.\n\n186\n00:09:27.595 --> 00:09:29.780\nBut that's what they're\ntalking about in task five.\n\n187\n00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:35.100\nAnd then we got obtain the project\ncharter approval from the sponsor, right?\n\n188\n00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.150\nWe need to get them to sign it.\n\n189\n00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.780\nWe need to get a formal approval.\n\n190\n00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.930\nIt says this is the charter\nthat we're running with.\n\n191\n00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.550\nYou now have the authority to move\nforward with this project, all right.\n\n192\n00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.300\nIf it hasn't been done already,\nwe need to do that benefit analysis.\n\n193\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:46.890\nRight?\nAnd\n\n194\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.470\nwe do that with the relevant stakeholders.\n\n195\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.440\nWe get their participation in this,\nso that we can evaluate whether or\n\n196\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.540\nnot this project actually is a good idea.\n\n197\n00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.950\nBecause believe it or\n\n198\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.065\nnot, not every project is a good idea,\nthere's plenty of things that go wrong.\n\n199\n00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:01.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, we can just look at the real\n\n200\n00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.230\nworld to see that.\n\n201\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.920\nDo you remember Ronnie Netflix?\n\n202\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.190\n>> Yes.\n>> Most people are familiar with\n\n203\n00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.810\nNetflix, right?\n\n204\n00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.200\nIt's a subscription service, you pay\na handful of dollars every month and\n\n205\n00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.860\nyou get to watch videos.\n\n206\n00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.970\nI subscribe, Ronnie, do you do Netflix?\n\n207\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.170\n>> We do Netflix.\n\n208\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.170\n>> So do you remember,\nthis would have been six or\n\n209\n00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.200\nseven years ago,\n>> That they decided to divide their\n\n210\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.630\ncompany in half as far as DVD\nshipments and streaming and\n\n211\n00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.990\nthey created a new company.\n\n212\n00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.060\nWhat was it called?\n\n213\n00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.856\n>> I can't remember that,yeah.\n\n214\n00:10:28.856 --> 00:10:31.530\n>> It was like Flixster or\nsomething silly like that,\n\n215\n00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.020\nand they thought it was a good idea.\n\n216\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.590\nThey had this project,it was underway.\n\n217\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.730\nAnd, what they didn't do was\nevaluate it against the public and\n\n218\n00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.560\nsee whether people thought\nit was a good idea.\n\n219\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.610\nAnd it turned out that\npeople absolutely hated it.\n\n220\n00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.180\nAnd so, whatever benefit they were trying\nto realize from splitting off into\n\n221\n00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.170\ntwo separate identities was not there.\n\n222\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.960\nThey were gonna damage\ntheir customer base, and so\n\n223\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.600\nthey ended up canceling the project.\n\n224\n00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.390\nBut the wheels are already in motion.\n\n225\n00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.300\nThey had sank a lot of money into\nit by the time that happened,\n\n226\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:00.840\nand it was a bad idea.\n\n227\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.260\nThey just couldn't take that time.\n\n228\n00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.320\nSo as a project manager,\nwhoever was the PM for that project,\n\n229\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.680\nthat was assigned it, should have\nearly on did a benefit analysis,\n\n230\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.020\ndid a couple of focus\ngroups with customers and\n\n231\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.950\nsaid what's gonna happen if we do this\nbefore they sank some time into it, right?\n\n232\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.550\nThat's good project management.\n\n233\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.770\nThey didn't do it, and\na lot of companies do that.\n\n234\n00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.740\nA lot of companies don't take into\naccount their customers' needs,\n\n235\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.380\nwhich is kind of counter intuitive,\nbut it happens more often than not.\n\n236\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.890\nAnd then lastly, we've got task eight,\n\n237\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.870\nwhich is to inform the stakeholders of\nthe approved project charter, right?\n\n238\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.880\nSo we need to let everybody know what\nit is that we've finally signed off on.\n\n239\n00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.290\nAnd you'd think this one would go without\nsaying, but we needed to distribute a copy\n\n240\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.160\nof the charter to everybody that signed so\nthey know this is what we're gonna do.\n\n241\n00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.820\nThis is part of what's gonna help\nus control expectations, right?\n\n242\n00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.740\nTo make sure people understand this\nis what the project is going to do.\n\n243\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.690\nThis is what's it's not going to do,\nright?\n\n244\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.070\nAnd putting that charter in their\nhands is what's going to take care of\n\n245\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.140\nthat, all right?\n\n246\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.280\nSo all of that should sound\npretty common sense, right.\n\n247\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.280\nThat's probably what a lot of you guys are\nthinking at home is that's all stuff I do.\n\n248\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.920\nWell this is what the exam is based on, so\n\n249\n00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.410\nwhen you're taking the exam,\nyou may get a question that is very,\n\n250\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.000\nvery detailed about the Develop of\nProject Charter process, right?\n\n251\n00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.390\nSo it's really focused on that process.\n\n252\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:27.080\nBut it's phrased in a way that's built\noff of this task you're performing.\n\n253\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.910\nThe exam is full of real world examples,\nyou're a project manager doing this,\n\n254\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.820\nthis, and this what would be\nthe appropriate next step?\n\n255\n00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.930\nSo, you built your charter,\n\n256\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.060\nyou got your charter signed,\nwhat would be the appropriate next step?\n\n257\n00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.520\nWell, I need to share it.\n\n258\n00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.710\nI need to distribute it out\nto the stakeholders, so\n\n259\n00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:46.550\nthat everybody understands.\n\n260\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.780\nI need to communicate that out.\n\n261\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.120\nIt's one of my tasks.\n\n262\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.960\nRight here is task eight.\n\n263\n00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.720\nIt needs to be done and\nit's part of our communications plan.\n\n264\n00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.690\nIt's already in there but\n\n265\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.250\nthis is the kind of real world task\nassociated with it, all right.\n\n266\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.310\nNow, each of the other domains\nbreakdown the same way.\n\n267\n00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.570\nAnd we can go through each of these.\n\n268\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.850\nI don't want to spend a ton of time cuz\nit's really kind of rehashing what we've\n\n269\n00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.690\nalready done in In the other episodes.\n\n270\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.370\nBut I just wanna make sure you guys\nunderstand kind of the real world\n\n271\n00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.110\nattachment to all of this.\n\n272\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.200\nThe planning phase, right?\n\n273\n00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.160\nWe actually have,\nthis is kind of the biggest one,\n\n274\n00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.620\n13 different tasks\nassociated with planning.\n\n275\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.610\nNow, on the exam, the bulk of the exam\nactually comes from executing.\n\n276\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.820\nBut planning is where our project manager\nspends a lot of their time doing work, and\n\n277\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.710\nso that's why we've got so\nmany different tasks built around so\n\n278\n00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.150\nmany different things.\n\n279\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.320\nWe've got review and assess the detailed\nproject requirements constraints and\n\n280\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.320\nassumptions, all right.\n\n281\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.850\nWhat are we doing there?\n\n282\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:48.680\nOr remember every project has the triple\nconstraints, your budget or cost,\n\n283\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.680\nyou have you're schedule or time, and you\nhave your requirements or quality, right?\n\n284\n00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.890\nThose are kind of your three,\nyou're triple constraints.\n\n285\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.900\nWe need to know what those constraints\nare to plan our project out.\n\n286\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.480\nAnd we can get that information from\nthe charter, from our scope statement.\n\n287\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.790\nBut if there's some debate\nover what a particular\n\n288\n00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.990\nphrase means you don't want\nto get into that situation.\n\n289\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.650\nSo we need to be exchanging that\ninformation with the stakeholders to\n\n290\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.210\ncome up with our initial plans.\n\n291\n00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.930\nIt's something that needs to be done.\n\n292\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.980\nWe develop a scope management plan.\n\n293\n00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.610\nWhat if somebody wants\nto change the scope?\n\n294\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.690\nWell, we need to be able to\ndo that to react to it and\n\n295\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.140\nhave good change management in place and\n\n296\n00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.970\nunderstand that that's gonna\nchange our triple constraints.\n\n297\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.050\nDevelop a skill management plan.\n\n298\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.730\nDid I actually do the same one twice?\n\n299\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:32.920\nI did.\n>> I think you did.\n\n300\n00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.310\n>> Yeah.\nThis one's so important,\n\n301\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.243\nyou have to do it twice.\n\n302\n00:14:35.243 --> 00:14:38.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is why my notes are not apparently\n\n303\n00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.370\nagrees.\n\n304\n00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.510\nDevelop a project schedule, right?\n\n305\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:46.290\nWe need our scope management plan for\nchanges to the plan itself.\n\n306\n00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:51.980\nBut our schedule, our resources, our\ncommunications, our procurements, right?\n\n307\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:57.160\nIt's really just a laundry list of things\nthat we all need to sort out and plan.\n\n308\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.340\nWe got quality management,\nchange management, right?\n\n309\n00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.030\nApparently I put the same one in twice.\n\n310\n00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.290\nOne of those is gonna be our schedule,\nright?\n\n311\n00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.600\nOur schedule management plan\nthat we need to get in place and\n\n312\n00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.260\nget kind of Set to evaluate when\nwe're gonna get things done.\n\n313\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.370\nSo all of that's gonna kind\nof flow through and again,\n\n314\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.490\nmost of it does just make sense.\n\n315\n00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.230\nThese are the different\nprocesses that we talked about.\n\n316\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.440\nBut if you look at knowledge and skills\nyou'll see there's a ton of stuff here.\n\n317\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.670\nBecause to come up with a plan for a whole\nproject requires a lot of knowledge.\n\n318\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.810\nYou need to understand communications\nplanning, and change management planning,\n\n319\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.060\nand cost management.\n\n320\n00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.100\nAll these different elements are skills\nthat you're expected to have and\n\n321\n00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.880\nthat we've addressed as\nwe went through the show.\n\n322\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:44.070\nUnder processes, we've got more processes\nand planning than any other process group.\n\n323\n00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.600\nAnd this is where we get that information.\n\n324\n00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.360\nSo, if you don't know, if you're looking\nat these knowledge and skills, and\n\n325\n00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.850\nyou say, wait a minute, I don't know\nhow to do human resource planning.\n\n326\n00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:53.987\nWell that's okay, all right.\n\n327\n00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:56.669\nBecause we have actually a process for\nthat, right.\n\n328\n00:15:56.669 --> 00:15:59.525\nThat's a resource and\nso if you look in here,\n\n329\n00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:03.448\nyou'll find It's buried in here somewhere,\nlet me find it.\n\n330\n00:16:03.448 --> 00:16:06.701\nHere it is, [CROSSTALK] plan\nHuman Resource Management.\n\n331\n00:16:06.701 --> 00:16:09.650\nSo we've got a process that\ntells us the input we need.\n\n332\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.300\nHere's the data we need to get.\n\n333\n00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.541\nHere's the tools and\ntechniques we apply to it.\n\n334\n00:16:13.541 --> 00:16:16.823\nAnd then our output is\nthe Human Resources Management plan.\n\n335\n00:16:16.823 --> 00:16:20.140\nHere's how we're going to manage\nthings and keep this thing going.\n\n336\n00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.650\nSo you don't have to be a super\ngenius on all of these.\n\n337\n00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.740\nBut PMBOK has the tools for you to do it.\n\n338\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.200\nYou might have a different system\nthat is in place that works betters.\n\n339\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.440\nYou're welcome to use that.\n\n340\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.382\nBut if you have nothing,\nyou just go and use the tools and\n\n341\n00:16:33.382 --> 00:16:36.271\ntechniques in the PMBOK and\nthat'll get you started.\n\n342\n00:16:36.271 --> 00:16:38.231\nAnd then you can customize it\nbased on your company's needs.\n\n343\n00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:44.713\nExecution, execution's where\nthe bulk of the exam comes from and\n\n344\n00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:47.740\nthis is when the actual\nwork is getting done.\n\n345\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.870\nNow our project manager's not doing\nthe actual work, we do important work but\n\n346\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.920\nit's not the actual work that\nmoves the project forward.\n\n347\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.540\nWhen execution is happening, a project\nmanager's monitoring and controlling.\n\n348\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.730\nWe see that next.\n\n349\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.490\nBut under Execution,\nwe're acquiring our resources.\n\n350\n00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:08.650\nWe are managing the execution to make sure\nthat people are actually kicking off and\n\n351\n00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.140\ndoing the work they're doing.\n\n352\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.930\nWe're doing our quality management,\n\n353\n00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:17.130\nwe're implementing any changes that have\nbeen approved, we're approving actions.\n\n354\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.030\nIf we have a risk management plan\nthat has contingencies in place and\n\n355\n00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.990\none of them needs to fire,\nwe're the ones who approve that to happen.\n\n356\n00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.330\nWe might have budget reserves or\nschedule reserves,\n\n357\n00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:28.600\nwe're approving the use of those reserves.\n\n358\n00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.595\nWe're managing the flow of information.\n\n359\n00:17:30.595 --> 00:17:34.070\nYou're getting status reports back from\nthe people who are doing the real work so\n\n360\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.160\nyou can keep track and\nmake sure it's happening.\n\n361\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.283\nAnd during all of this your stakeholders\nare going to be asking for information,\n\n362\n00:17:40.283 --> 00:17:44.481\nand they're gonna be receiving information\nand they're gonna have questions.\n\n363\n00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:49.330\nAnd so we're have be able to manage that,\nalso stakeholders import changes.\n\n364\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.500\nYou might have somebody who's very\ninfluential at the beginning of\n\n365\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.570\nthe project.\n\n366\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.360\nBut as the project nears the end,\ntheir influence gets smaller and\n\n367\n00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.170\nsmaller and smaller.\n\n368\n00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:01.250\nTheir part is done and so\nthey become not a key stakeholder, but\n\n369\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.290\njust a regular stakeholder or a secondary.\n\n370\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.850\nAnd so we track all of that.\n\n371\n00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:10.390\nAnd for that, you've got just a ton\nprocesses available there too.\n\n372\n00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.050\nDirecting and managing the project work,\n\n373\n00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.340\ndoing quality assurance in each of these\nthen we implement to achieve those tasks.\n\n374\n00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.330\nBut again, it's just corresponding\nto real world tasks that you perform\n\n375\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.590\nas part of managing a project.\n\n376\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.880\nMonitoring controlling,\nthis is another pretty big one.\n\n377\n00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.240\nIt's only got seven tasks, so it doesn't\nseem big but they're important tasks and\n\n378\n00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.730\nthey require a lot of work.\n\n379\n00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.273\nIf you watched our earn value analysis\nepisode, there's formulas and\n\n380\n00:18:37.273 --> 00:18:38.088\nevil math-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n381\n00:18:38.088 --> 00:18:38.813\n>> That you have to do,\n\n382\n00:18:38.813 --> 00:18:40.370\nthere's all sorts of things there.\n\n383\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.010\nBut it's really important cuz here's where\nwe do our trend analysis and all of that.\n\n384\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.650\nWe're measuring performance and\n\n385\n00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.840\nby using the tools associated with it,\nwe can use that to kind of predict\n\n386\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.030\nthe future to see what's gonna\nhappen as our project moves forward.\n\n387\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.720\nAre we gonna be on schedule?\n\n388\n00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.790\nAre we gonna be under or at budget?\n\n389\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:02.610\nAre we going to meet all the requirements\nas requested by the original sponsor?\n\n390\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.320\nThat's all stuff we can look at as we're\ngoing through the execution phase and\n\n391\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.399\nwe're monitoring it and controlling it.\n\n392\n00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.201\nManaging changes.\n\n393\n00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:13.899\nThat's kind of a big deal cuz change\ncan really get out of control if you're\n\n394\n00:19:13.899 --> 00:19:14.779\nnot careful, and\n\n395\n00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:18.910\nyou've got to make sure that it doesn't\nimpact your overall triple constraints.\n\n396\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.350\nWe've got verifying the deliverables.\n\n397\n00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.550\nJust because somebody in\nthe field says that it's done,\n\n398\n00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.880\ndoes that actually mean that it's done?\n\n399\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.440\nDid it meet our requirements?\n\n400\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.840\nWe've got to verify.\n\n401\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.080\nNow how do we verify?\n\n402\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.490\nWe've talked about it in episodes.\n\n403\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.170\nCheck lists and\nother ways of evaluating it.\n\n404\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.680\nWell again, we've got processes for that.\n\n405\n00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.270\nHow do we validate the scope?\n\n406\n00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.780\nValidating the scope, are we actually\nliving up to what the scope is asking for?\n\n407\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.670\nAnd that applies to deliverables\nas well as the project as a whole.\n\n408\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.800\nSo we've got the tools to do that.\n\n409\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.400\nControl the scope,\nschedule, cost, quality.\n\n410\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.020\nAll these different process groups\navailable to achieve each of these.\n\n411\n00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.110\nMonitoring and assessing risk,\nreviewing the issue log.\n\n412\n00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:02.080\nIssues happen, sometimes they don't\nactually influence the project.\n\n413\n00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.580\nI've got an employee\nwho is falling behind.\n\n414\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.950\nSo I terminate them and\nI bring in a different employee.\n\n415\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.260\nNow the project moves on as normal.\n\n416\n00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.420\nBut my schedule's not affected,\nmy budget's not affected,\n\n417\n00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.350\neverything kinda runs fine.\n\n418\n00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.020\nI still need the issue log to track that,\n\n419\n00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.760\nso that I can avoid that\nsituation in the future.\n\n420\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.850\nHow can I have avoided that situation?\n\n421\n00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.760\nAnd if you look at your knowledge and\nskills, there's things in here\n\n422\n00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.670\nlike our measurement tools,\nour project quality and so on.\n\n423\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.800\nWe can leverage these tools to\nensure we've got the right people.\n\n424\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.840\nTools like LEAN and Kanban and Six Sigma,\nthey help you spot inefficiencies\n\n425\n00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.280\nin your system, where you might be falling\nbehind schedule because of defects.\n\n426\n00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.150\nSo we can identify those and clarify.\n\n427\n00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.081\nWe'll use the bad employee as an example.\n\n428\n00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:52.350\nIf I have a bad employee, was it my\nfault for not training the employee?\n\n429\n00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.940\nVery well could be.\n\n430\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:58.500\nOr was it the employee just\nnot being a good employee?\n\n431\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.430\nNot living up to what they said.\n\n432\n00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.940\nAnd if that's the case how could\nI identified that earlier?\n\n433\n00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.111\nSo the issue log becomes a lesson learned.\n\n434\n00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:12.191\nI've got an employee who says they\ncan put up a brick wall, maybe I just\n\n435\n00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:16.340\ndo a quick test to say here, just build\nme a wall that's one foot tall and\n\n436\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.401\none foot wide just real quick,\nbuild me something.\n\n437\n00:21:19.401 --> 00:21:20.981\nAnd actually verify that skill.\n\n438\n00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:24.263\nIt doesn't take long to do and it could\navoid a situation down the road or\n\n439\n00:21:24.263 --> 00:21:25.261\ngive me a portfolio.\n\n440\n00:21:25.261 --> 00:21:27.810\nShow me the projects\nyou've already worked on.\n\n441\n00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.379\nAnd if they don't have one\nthen it's a risky employee,\n\n442\n00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:32.902\ncuz they might not have\nthe skills they attest to have.\n\n443\n00:21:35.541 --> 00:21:38.330\nAnd then that moves us to our\nlast domain which is closing.\n\n444\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.890\nAnd in closing,\nyou actually got quite a few tasks here.\n\n445\n00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.630\nAlthough in real life,\nit kinda happens really fast.\n\n446\n00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:45.410\nDoesn't it?\n\n447\n00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.410\nRemember that closing is supposed to\nhappen at the end of every phase.\n\n448\n00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.860\nSo you're really closing\nlike five different times.\n\n449\n00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.860\nAnd it's the last phase when you close\nthat, it's closing the whole project and\n\n450\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.890\nyou got a ton of work there.\n\n451\n00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.250\nSo obtain final acceptance\nof the deliverables.\n\n452\n00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.880\nThat happens at the end of the project.\n\n453\n00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.410\nTransfer ownership of the deliverables.\n\n454\n00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.330\nAgain, at the end of the project.\n\n455\n00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.280\nObtain financial legal and\nadministrative closure.\n\n456\n00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.710\nPrepare and\nshare the final project report.\n\n457\n00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.800\nCollate the lessons learned.\n\n458\n00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.040\nNow the first four were all at\nthe end of the project, but\n\n459\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.570\ncollate lessons learned,\nwe can do that throughout the project.\n\n460\n00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.191\nI just finished planning,\nwhat have I learned as a part of that?\n\n461\n00:22:22.191 --> 00:22:24.339\nHow could I have done that\nbetter in the next project or\n\n462\n00:22:24.339 --> 00:22:26.360\nother projects that are going\non at the same time?\n\n463\n00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.470\nHow could they benefit from\nwhat we just went through?\n\n464\n00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.240\nArchiving project documents.\n\n465\n00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.260\nIf you wait to the end of the project to\ndo that, it's a nightmare of work but\n\n466\n00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.410\nif you do it throughout the project,\nsaving all your change tickets and\n\n467\n00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.980\neverything else, all your reports.\n\n468\n00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.180\nThen it's all kind of assembled already\nand you got one nice big project book.\n\n469\n00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.660\nAnd then obtaining feedback\nfrom the relevant stakeholders,\n\n470\n00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.390\nyou can do that at the end\nof the project if you want.\n\n471\n00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:54.430\nBut you should be doing it\nthroughout the whole project,\n\n472\n00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:59.380\nbecause what may happen is a stakeholder\nmay have presented the project one way.\n\n473\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.340\nYou solidified a scope, you're moving\nforward, things are running great,\n\n474\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.260\nyou're living up to that scope and then\nthe stakeholder realizes halfway through\n\n475\n00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.210\nthis is not working out\nthe way they wanted.\n\n476\n00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.580\nAnd as a project manager you can say well,\nit's too late buddy.\n\n477\n00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.790\nWe got the scope in place.\n\n478\n00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:14.630\nThe wheels are in motion.\n\n479\n00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.430\nWe're gonna finish this.\n\n480\n00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.220\nYou should've known better back then.\n\n481\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.740\nYou could do that.\n\n482\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.170\nBut if you communicate with that\nstakeholder, you might be able to find\n\n483\n00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:27.820\nthat the two of you or the team, can\nwork to a resolution and say, okay well,\n\n484\n00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.200\nall right I recognize that this\nno longer fits your needs.\n\n485\n00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.690\nIs there a way that we can correct that?\n\n486\n00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.800\nIs there a way that we can try and\nsteer this in the right direction?\n\n487\n00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.340\nAnd you may have to completely\nrewrite your scope.\n\n488\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.280\nYou may have to backtrack\non a lot of stuff.\n\n489\n00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.020\nBut it might be better than just going and\nfinishing and\n\n490\n00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.870\nhaving something that doesn't work\nthe way that we intended it to work.\n\n491\n00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.730\nSo that's open communications.\n\n492\n00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.865\nAnd you'll see that in the Knowledge and\n\n493\n00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:55.831\nSkills as it talks about all the various\nthings here, but feedback techniques.\n\n494\n00:23:55.831 --> 00:23:58.190\nWhich really comes from our\ncommunications management plan.\n\n495\n00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.940\nWhen you've got that plan in place,\nhow you talk and gather that data.\n\n496\n00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.630\nAnd then in our processes,\nwe don't really see that come out.\n\n497\n00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.280\nClose Procurements,\nClose Project or Phase.\n\n498\n00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.020\nWell, that's because some of these skills\nare coming from the other processes that\n\n499\n00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.740\nare outside of this particular domain.\n\n500\n00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.950\nSo we get these knowledge and skills.\n\n501\n00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.340\nSometimes you'll hear them\ncalled cross knowledge and\n\n502\n00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.420\nskills or cut over knowledge and skills.\n\n503\n00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.840\nYou'll hear those terms used.\n\n504\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.320\nAnd that's because they're saying,\nthis knowledge or\n\n505\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.750\nskill is not tied just to closing it's\nactually tied to the project as a whole.\n\n506\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.230\nYou'll use these skills everywhere.\n\n507\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:40.340\nSo on the exam, they don't normally\ncall out a specific process.\n\n508\n00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.090\nThey called it task and\nwhen you read that task,\n\n509\n00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.970\nin your mind you're associating\nthe process with the task.\n\n510\n00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.200\nWhat process would I use\nto solve this problem?\n\n511\n00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.160\nWhat achieves that goal and\nthen you go through and you solve that and\n\n512\n00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.925\nif you've studied your processes\nthen it's fine, it's easy.\n\n513\n00:24:55.925 --> 00:24:58.916\nIf you studied the tasks instead\nit becomes a lot harder.\n\n514\n00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:02.756\nAnd that's why our show was structured\naround the processes themselves and\n\n515\n00:25:02.756 --> 00:25:03.536\nnot the tasks.\n\n516\n00:25:03.536 --> 00:25:07.945\nBecause it's easy to apply one\nprocess to more than one task.\n\n517\n00:25:07.945 --> 00:25:11.155\nIt's hard to take one task and\napply it to more than one process.\n\n518\n00:25:11.155 --> 00:25:13.590\nSo it's a little more intuitive\nthe way that we did it.\n\n519\n00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.240\nBut understanding both ways is important.\n\n520\n00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.520\nSo if you're every reading through PMP's\nexam objectives and you're looking at\n\n521\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.460\nthese task lists and wondering\nwhat's going on there, that's why.\n\n522\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.791\nThey're just trying to attach all\nthis to the real world experience.\n\n523\n00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:28.670\n>> Don, that's a lot of information.\n\n524\n00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.480\nThank you for\n\n525\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.960\nhelping us to put that into a nice little\nchunk of information that we can review.\n\n526\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.970\nAnd actually helps when we see where\nit does apply to our real world\n\n527\n00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.380\nexperience as well.\n\n528\n00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.686\nDon, any parting words of wisdom\nas we're preparing for this exam,\n\n529\n00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:43.231\nnow knowing these objectives?\n\n530\n00:25:43.231 --> 00:25:46.440\n>> Yeah, I'll post these tables as part\nof the show notes with the episode.\n\n531\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.920\nAnd I need to go back and I'll edit\nplanning to correct that duplicate one\n\n532\n00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.050\nthat I got in there,\nso that'll be accurate.\n\n533\n00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:55.120\nBut if you don't wanna wait on that.\n\n534\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.021\nPMI, they post all this.\n\n535\n00:25:56.021 --> 00:26:00.746\nIf you go to the PMI's website, and\njust go to the exam objective outline,\n\n536\n00:26:00.746 --> 00:26:04.951\nthey have these official tables from\nthem and you can go and get it.\n\n537\n00:26:04.951 --> 00:26:08.381\nMy information here is really just\ndrawn from that source of data.\n\n538\n00:26:08.381 --> 00:26:11.205\nSo you can always pull it\nright from the PMI, but\n\n539\n00:26:11.205 -->

00:00:19.868\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look at PMP,\n\n4\n00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:22.220\nProject Management Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.990\nAnd we're specifically gonna be diving\ninto the critical path method and\n\n6\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.060\nwho else better to help us than Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.940\nHow's it going, Don?\n\n8\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.900\n>> It is going great, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.910\nThanks for having me on the show and\n\n10\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.530\nI'm excited to be kicking off\nour formulas in action series.\n\n11\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.350\nWe're gonna be taking a look at a lot of\nthe formulas that we need to know for\n\n12\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.730\nthe PMP exam,\njust running through some examples.\n\n13\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.990\nHow to use them, how to get really\ncomfortable with them because on the exam\n\n14\n00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.600\nyou shouldn't dread the formula questions\nyou should really appreciate them and\n\n15\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.680\ngo boy that's going to be an easy one.\n\n16\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.950\nAll I have to do is a little math and\nthat's usually what it boils down to.\n\n17\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.240\nSo in this episode we're gonna tackle the\ncritical path method, we'll get a chance\n\n18\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.960\nto see a great example, we'll run through\nit and do the forward pass, the backwards\n\n19\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.300\npass, all the different things that we\ntalked about earlier in the series.\n\n20\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.380\nAnd not only are we calculating critical\npath, we're also gonna be calculating\n\n21\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.050\nthings like float and free float and\ngetting a chance to see those also.\n\n22\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.140\nAll just right here wrapped\nup into one nice big example.\n\n23\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.980\n>> All right so Don, before we get\nstarted, it's probably best if\n\n24\n00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.600\nyou remind us cuz I know it's like me,\nyou may have actually gone through this\n\n25\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.520\nseveral times in your head and you've seen\nthe actual little template that's there.\n\n26\n00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.200\nA lot of times we forget so this is\na good place to remind us about this.\n\n27\n00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.170\n>> Yeah, on the exam,\nwhat they're gonna do is,\n\n28\n00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.780\nis well, there's a few different\nways they can do it on the exam.\n\n29\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.050\nWe'll see it in some of\nthe examples I'll give.\n\n30\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.830\nBut they're normally gonna show you\na project schedule network diagram, right,\n\n31\n00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.460\na PSND.\n\n32\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.670\nAnd if you don't remember what a project\nschedule network diagram looks like,\n\n33\n00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.090\nit looks like what I've\ngot here on my laptop.\n\n34\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.310\nIs a bunch of boxes that\nare kind of arranged,\n\n35\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.400\nand I've added a little bit to it right,\nthat in the normal template you don't have\n\n36\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.940\nfloat at the bottom of a box,\nbut you do have the ES,\n\n37\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.880\nEF, LS, LF, and a couple of other\nbits of the data jammed in there.\n\n38\n00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.200\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout what all that is.\n\n39\n00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.530\nSo when you're looking at one\nof these boxes, it may or\n\n40\n00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.105\nmay not have flow, like I said.\n\n41\n00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:09.800\nThat may just not be there,\nmay look like that, right?\n\n42\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.040\nAnd if it looks like this, what you've\ngot is early start, early finish,\n\n43\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.070\nlate start, late finish.\n\n44\n00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.510\nThey're four values that you don't\nnecessarily have when you launch\n\n45\n00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.260\na project.\n\n46\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.460\nYou have to determine\nwhat those values are and\n\n47\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.150\nthat's really what\ncritical path method does.\n\n48\n00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.030\nIn fact, when you start a project\nthere's normally only two pieces of data\n\n49\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.990\nthat you have.\n\n50\n00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.650\nThe task name and the duration,\nthat's what D is right here, duration.\n\n51\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.440\nSo the duration is how long\nthat task is going to take.\n\n52\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.530\nAnd then we've got to arrange all\nthose tasks together to figure out\n\n53\n00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.250\nexactly how long this\nis all going to take.\n\n54\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.700\nWhen is my project going to finish and\n\n55\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.060\nwhere do I have little gaps of space where\nI can slow down or speed up if need be?\n\n56\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.140\nAnd that whole slowing down and speeding\nup part that's where float comes in.\n\n57\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.810\nThat's why I normally add float onto the\nbottom of this so I can keep track of it.\n\n58\n00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.610\nNow, when it comes to\ncritical path method,\n\n59\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.800\nthe bulk of the math that we're\ndoing is really just addition.\n\n60\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.730\nSimple addition, so\nnot really crazy formulas.\n\n61\n00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.140\nAnd the only real formula we need\nto remember is the formula for\n\n62\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.400\ncalculating float.\n\n63\n00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.840\nAnd float is simply late\nstart minus early start.\n\n64\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.170\nEarly start is the earliest\nthis task can start.\n\n65\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.565\nI mean we can't start before\nthis particular point in time.\n\n66\n00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:28.760\nAnd early finish is if we're\nrunning perfectly on schedule,\n\n67\n00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.120\nwhat's the earliest we can finish.\n\n68\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.140\nLate start is how late can we start it and\n\n69\n00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.150\nstill finish our project on schedule,\nwithout going over our schedule.\n\n70\n00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.420\nSo late start's pretty important, and then\nlate finish would be the latest we could\n\n71\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.550\nfinish, and again,\nstill have our project finish on schedule.\n\n72\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.010\nIf there's no difference between these,\nif late start minus early start is zero or\n\n73\n00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.200\nlate finish minus early finish is zero,\nthat means there's no difference, right?\n\n74\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.710\nThey're the same value and\nyou've got no float, zero flexibility.\n\n75\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.450\nBut if there's a difference between these\nnumbers, then you're gonna have some time.\n\n76\n00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.960\nSome time that you could fall\nbehind if you needed to.\n\n77\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.480\nThat you could take resources\noff of one task and\n\n78\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.980\nassign to another to\nmake up your schedule.\n\n79\n00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.640\nSo that's important that we\nrecognize where that is and\n\n80\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.690\ncritical path method will let us do that.\n\n81\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.070\nSo we calculate our critical path and\nwe calculate our float,\n\n82\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.080\nreally all at the same time\nusing the same techniques.\n\n83\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.690\nAnd that's what we're gonna\nrun through in this example.\n\n84\n00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.420\nAnd so the example that I've got\nworked up is this topology right here.\n\n85\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.260\nAnd I've got the basic elements of what\nwe know about a project when we kick off.\n\n86\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.360\nSo I've got my task names and\nI just use letters.\n\n87\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.190\nSo a, b, c all the way through,\nwhat's my highest one, i.\n\n88\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.230\nSo a through i are my task names.\n\n89\n00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.110\nAnd then I've got the durations,\nand I did durations in days.\n\n90\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.550\nYou could do hours, you could do weeks,\ndepends how long your project is but\n\n91\n00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.610\nI did mine in days.\n\n92\n00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.860\nSo this is task A, and\ntask A is gonna take 1 day.\n\n93\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.500\nOr up here I've got task C and\nit's gonna take 4 days, right?\n\n94\n00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.890\nThat's all the information I have.\n\n95\n00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.040\nThis is like very indicative\nof what you would get out of\n\n96\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.160\na work breakdown structure.\n\n97\n00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.210\nThat's all it's gonna have, is Has to do,\nhow long it's going to take.\n\n98\n00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.470\nIt's up to us to then\ncalculate everything else.\n\n99\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.970\nAnd for the exam you need to know how\ncalculate all of these other values.\n\n100\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.620\nNow in our first two examples we're gonna\nrun through calculating the whole thing.\n\n101\n00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.430\nOn the exam they're not\ngonna have you do that.\n\n102\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.120\nOn the exam they're normally gonna have\nyou just calculate out just one of these\n\n103\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.720\nsquares and\nusually it's one particular value.\n\n104\n00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.460\nSo, for example,\nyou might see a square like this one and\n\n105\n00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.710\neverything else is filled in but\nthis one has blanks.\n\n106\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.940\nAnd it says,\nwhat would be the early finish of task C?\n\n107\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.350\nAnd you've got multiple choice\nanswers with just numbers in them and\n\n108\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.270\nyou pick the appropriate ones.\n\n109\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.070\nSo you just need to\ncalculate a single value.\n\n110\n00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.230\nBut working through a whole example like\nthis will help you better understand it.\n\n111\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.460\nSo we're gonna do the whole path first.\n\n112\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.980\nAnd then in a follow-up episode we'll\nbreak it down more like the exam does and\n\n113\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.900\nhit just a single area.\n\n114\n00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.580\nAll right, well let's get started.\n\n115\n00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.310\nThe first thing we need to\ndo with critical path method\n\n116\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.940\nis to calculate out what's\ncalled a forward pass.\n\n117\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.210\nWe need to start from the beginning, and\n\n118\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.810\nbasically we're gonna\ncalculate all of the earlies.\n\n119\n00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.940\nThe earliest that we can do things.\n\n120\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.030\nSo assuming that everything runs great,\n\n121\n00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.770\neverything runs according to plan,\nwhat is this gonna look like?\n\n122\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.350\nSo we're gonna calculate out the early\nstarts and the early finishes.\n\n123\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.650\nNow one of the challenges\nthat we hear from a lot,\n\n124\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.350\nyou know we get viewers that write in and\nsay Don,\n\n125\n00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.760\nI'm really having a problem with this,\nis that a lot of us are IT guys and so,\n\n126\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.535\nwhen we start counting,\nwe always start from zero, right?\n\n127\n00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:29.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, when I have a project start,\n\n128\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.170\nwe're starting on day zero and\nit's going to take one day and so on.\n\n129\n00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.200\nBut in project management,\n\n130\n00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.740\nwe don't start at zero because these\nare actually units of time and\n\n131\n00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.520\nso, we need to start them based on,\nfor example, days and I'm doing days.\n\n132\n00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.220\nSo, when I say this is day one that\nthese project is going to occur on,\n\n133\n00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.850\nI don't actually start at zero.\n\n134\n00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.640\nMy early start isn't zero,\nmy early start is one.\n\n135\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.640\nI'm starting on day one and\nthen will continue on.\n\n136\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.428\nThe way I like to do it is think of\nthis duration as days of the month.\n\n137\n00:06:58.428 --> 00:07:03.950\nSo this might be January 1st 2016, so\n\n138\n00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.588\nthis task is going to start and\nfinish on January 1st.\n\n139\n00:07:08.588 --> 00:07:11.290\nIt's not gonna start on day zero and\nfinish on day one,\n\n140\n00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.998\nthat would technically be two days.\n\n141\n00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:19.340\nSo, we're gonna start on the first, and\nwe're going to finish on the first.\n\n142\n00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.500\nNo crazy math needed there, it's a one\nday task, it starts on that day and\n\n143\n00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.042\nit finishes.\n\n144\n00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:26.680\nNow task B and\n\n145\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.870\nE both have dependencies, and\ntheir dependency is task A.\n\n146\n00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.390\nTask A has to finish before B and\nE can start,\n\n147\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.410\nit's a finish-to-start relationship.\n\n148\n00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.670\nAnd so, if task A started on day one and\nfinished on day one and\n\n149\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.610\nit was an entire day of activity,\ncan I get any more work done on that day?\n\n150\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.440\nNo, so anybody that follows on after\nthat is gonna have to start on day two.\n\n151\n00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.965\nSo now I'm in day two.\n\n152\n00:07:51.965 --> 00:07:54.670\nSo when I look at task B and task E,\n\n153\n00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.754\nthe earliest they can start is on day two,\nright.\n\n154\n00:07:58.754 --> 00:08:03.003\nThis one took up day one, and so\nnow these guys are gonna start.\n\n155\n00:08:03.003 --> 00:08:04.338\nOn day two, all right?\n\n156\n00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:06.504\nSo I fill both of those in.\n\n157\n00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:10.560\nNow, task B is a two-day activity, right?\n\n158\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.120\nAnd here's where things really,\nreally get dangerous, right?\n\n159\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.420\nAs dangerous as it gets,\ncuz the temptation is to say, all right,\n\n160\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.580\nI'm on day two, let me add 2,\nfinish on day four, okay.\n\n161\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.809\nBut that's just traditional math.\n\n162\n00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:24.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's normal numbers,\n\n163\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.420\nthat's not what we're doing here,\nwe're thinking of days.\n\n164\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.520\nSo I took all of day two, January 2nd, but\n\n165\n00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.750\nthis is a two-day activity,\nso I also need January 3rd.\n\n166\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.310\nSo this one is gonna\nfinish on January 3rd.\n\n167\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.950\nI find that thinking of them as dates\nreally helps me to make sure I get\n\n168\n00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.920\nthese numbers right.\n\n169\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.680\nSo January 2nd, January 3rd,\nthere's by two days for task B.\n\n170\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.410\nTask E's only one day though.\n\n171\n00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.650\nSo it starts on January 2nd,\nit finishes on January 2nd.\n\n172\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.590\nSo I fill those values in.\n\n173\n00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.670\nAnd now I continue on.\n\n174\n00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.680\nNow this particular project\nhas two very obvious paths.\n\n175\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.560\nI've got BCD and then I've got EFGH.\n\n176\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.040\nSo, a path across the top,\na path across the bottom.\n\n177\n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.220\nIf all I'm trying to do is find my\ncritical path, on a simple one like this,\n\n178\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.890\nI really wouldn't even bother with\nthe forward and backwards paths.\n\n179\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.730\nI would just add up the durations, right?\n\n180\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.401\nWhichever path has the longest duration,\nthat's gonna be the one that wins,\n\n181\n00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:19.137\nthat's gonna be our critical path.\n\n182\n00:09:19.137 --> 00:09:23.423\nSo, if the question is just asking me\nwhich of these is the critical path, well,\n\n183\n00:09:23.423 --> 00:09:26.900\nI've got two, four, three, so\nthat's nine across the top.\n\n184\n00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.670\nIs that good math?\n\n185\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.242\nYeah, yep.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n186\n00:09:28.242 --> 00:09:29.990\nthat's nine days across the top.\n\n187\n00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.470\nAnd then down here I've got 1,\n5, 4, and 1.\n\n188\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.805\nSo I've got 11 days across the bottom.\n\n189\n00:09:34.805 --> 00:09:36.385\nNine days across the top,\n\n190\n00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:40.260\neleven days across the bottom,\nthe bottom is my critical path, right.\n\n191\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.970\nIt's longer, but they might not\nall be simple like this one.\n\n192\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.850\nAnd we'll see in my next example,\nit's a little bit more complex, and so\n\n193\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.800\njust adding those up\ndoesn't necessarily work.\n\n194\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.710\nBut if I'm also looking for things like\nfloat, or if they're asking me for\n\n195\n00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.880\nthe early start of a particular task,\nit doesn't matter to me\n\n196\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.590\nwhich one is the critical path,\nI need to find that particular day.\n\n197\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.870\nSo, that's why you need to be comfortable\nwith all the different methods of\n\n198\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.500\ncalculating this out.\n\n199\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.170\nAll right, so, let's continue on.\n\n200\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.550\nAnd I'm just gonna focus on the top path\nfor right now, and fill this out, right?\n\n201\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.760\nSo, we have task B finishing on day 3,\n\n202\n00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.290\nwhich means the next task can't\nstart before day 4, right?\n\n203\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.519\nThis one finished on the 3rd,\nthis one can start on the 4th, and\n\n204\n00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:20.350\nit's a four-day activity.\n\n205\n00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.566\nSo it's gonna take the 4th, the 5th,\nthe 6th, and the 7th, and so,\n\n206\n00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:27.690\nthe earliest it can finish is on the 7th.\n\n207\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.350\nAll right, continuing on with D,\n\n208\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.900\nthe earliest it can start is on the 8th,\nright?\n\n209\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.520\nSo it's gonna start on the 8th of the\nmonth, and then it's a three-day activity,\n\n210\n00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.190\nso we'll need the 8th,\nthe 9th, and the 10th,\n\n211\n00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.700\nand we'll finish right there on the 10th,\nokay?\n\n212\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.020\nSo the top path, BCD,\nwill finish January 10th.\n\n213\n00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.480\nAll right.\nI'm just using January\n\n214\n00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.390\n10th as an example here.\n\n215\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.530\nIt could be whatever day your\nparticular project is designed.\n\n216\n00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.640\nAnd boy, there's another complexity.\n\n217\n00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.710\nThey won't hit you with this on the exam,\nbut\n\n218\n00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.850\nwhat if you have to factor\nweekends into this?\n\n219\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.640\nIf you have to factor weekends in, I might\nhave two days that we can't work, and so\n\n220\n00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.760\nI might start on the 8th and\nfinish on the 12th.\n\n221\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.530\nBecause maybe the 9th and\nthe 10th were Saturday and Sunday.\n\n222\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.000\nSo that's when things really\nstart to get a little bit messy.\n\n223\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.610\nBut fortunately, your other path will\nbe doing the exact same thing, and so\n\n224\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.090\nyou'll have that same delay for both.\n\n225\n00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.870\nBut that's where project management\nsoftware really comes in handy.\n\n226\n00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.330\nAll right, so I've got that path\nkind of laid out right there,\n\n227\n00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.870\nnow I'm gonna go back to the bottom and\ncontinue on with this one.\n\n228\n00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:32.170\nSo task E is finishing on day 2,\ntask F can start on day 3 if it wants,\n\n229\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.080\nand it's a five-day activity,\nso it will finish on day 7.\n\n230\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.880\nThen, task G, we're gonna bump that one up\nto the 8th, it can start on January 8th.\n\n231\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.020\nAnd it's a four-day activity, and so\nthat one's gonna finish on, let's see,\n\n232\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.530\nthat would be the 11th.\n\n233\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.330\n>> The 11th.\n\n234\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.260\n>> There we go.\n\n235\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.880\nAll right, so if you need help\ncoming up with these numbers,\n\n236\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.770\nyou can count on your fingers\nif it's a small number, right?\n\n237\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I can say eighth, ninth, tenth,\n\n238\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.260\neleventh, right?\n\n239\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.290\nThat's one way to do it.\n\n240\n00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.140\nOr what I'm actually doing\nin my head is I go ahead and\n\n241\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.470\ndo eight plus four and\nthen I just subtract one, right?\n\n242\n00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.330\nI do eight plus four and\nthat gives me 12 and\n\n243\n00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.740\nI subtract one because I\nhave to count the eighth.\n\n244\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.292\nRight?\nSo that's a little shortcut that\n\n245\n00:12:11.292 --> 00:12:14.810\nI use that makes it a little easier and\nit works better with bigger numbers.\n\n246\n00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.600\nWhat if this was, I start on the eighth,\nand it's a 15-day duration?\n\n247\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.660\nWell, you can't really use your fingers\nanymore if it's a 15-day duration.\n\n248\n00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.216\nBut you can do 8 plus 15 and get 23,\nand then subtract 1 to get 22.\n\n249\n00:12:25.216 --> 00:12:26.493\nAnd so, now you know it's 22.\n\n250\n00:12:26.493 --> 00:12:29.475\nSo, that's kind of a little\nshortcut that I use,\n\n251\n00:12:29.475 --> 00:12:33.100\nwhich should be the early start\nplus the duration minus one.\n\n252\n00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.460\nThat's not an official PMI formula.\n\n253\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.360\nAll right, and then we move over\nhere to this last one, task H,\n\n254\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.100\nwhich only has a duration of 1, and\nso it can start on the 12th and\n\n255\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.088\nits duration is 1, so I can just\nfinish it on the 12th also, all right?\n\n256\n00:12:48.088 --> 00:12:50.690\nAnd then lastly,\nwe get all the way down here to task I.\n\n257\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.200\nNow, task I has two dependencies, right?\n\n258\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:01.090\nIt needs task D and task H to finish\nbefore task I can start, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.590\nWell, if I look at task D,\nthe earliest it can finish is on the 10th.\n\n260\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.860\nAnd if I look at task H, the earliest it\ncan finish is on the 12th, all right?\n\n261\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:16.840\nSo because this one can't finish until the\n12th, task I can't start until the 13th.\n\n262\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.710\nEven though this guy up here is done,\nwe have to wait for\n\n263\n00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.560\nthe other one to finish too.\n\n264\n00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.380\nSo this one is gonna be the 13th,\n\n265\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.920\nand that means the earliest we\ncan finish is on the 13th also.\n\n266\n00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.650\nOkay.\n\n267\n00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:33.250\nSo, if our project runs according to plan,\nif everything goes according to schedule,\n\n268\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.980\nwe're looking at a 13-day\nproject right here.\n\n269\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.230\nOr if these are weeks,\na 13-week project, right?\n\n270\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.250\nOr a 13-month, 13-year,\nwhatever it is, right?\n\n271\n00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.070\nBut this is a 13-day project here.\n\n272\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.910\nThat's if everything\nruns according to plan.\n\n273\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.320\nWhat if things don't run\naccording to plan, right?\n\n274\n00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.490\nWhat if I start to have delays?\n\n275\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.610\nWell, hopefully I have float and\n\n276\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.270\nthe float will eat that up and\nthen I still finish on the 13th day.\n\n277\n00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:01.620\nSo we need to do a backwards pass\nto find out anywhere we have float.\n\n278\n00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.160\nTo say, not that things necessarily\nwent wrong, but if I need more time,\n\n279\n00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.550\nwhere can I find it.\n\n280\n00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.300\nAnd the whole point is to make\nsure that we find extra time and\n\n281\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.111\nstill finish on the 13th.\n\n282\n00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:17.150\nSo when we're filling out these charts and\nwe start calculating the lathes,\n\n283\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.382\nthis is the latest we can finish and\nstay on schedule.\n\n284\n00:14:20.382 --> 00:14:23.740\nSo it'd still be a winner,\nstill have a successful project.\n\n285\n00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.450\nSo the latest that this\nactivity can finish.\n\n286\n00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.230\n>> 13th?\n\n287\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.970\n>> Would be the 13th.\n\n288\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.140\nWe want that to be the same\nas the early finish.\n\n289\n00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.310\nIn other words, the latest we can\nfinish and still be early, right?\n\n290\n00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.960\nSo, they'll finish at\nthe best possible time.\n\n291\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.140\nThis is a one-day duration activity.\n\n292\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.590\nSo that's gonna be a 13 right there also.\n\n293\n00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.290\nThis final activity might\nbe more than a day,\n\n294\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.570\nand then these numbers then would\nbe a little bit different, right?\n\n295\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.256\nBut in my case, it's just all 13s.\n\n296\n00:14:48.256 --> 00:14:51.340\nAll lucky number 13s,\nit would be a great project to work.\n\n297\n00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.876\n>> [LAUGH] Now, Don, at this point,\nonce we're actually here at the end result\n\n298\n00:14:54.876 --> 00:14:57.210\nthere on I,\nyou talked about calculating float.\n\n299\n00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:01.915\nIs that important to calculate\nright here at the very end?\n\n300\n00:15:01.915 --> 00:15:03.230\n>> Well, not so much here.\n\n301\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.490\nWhen you're on the last activity,\nyou never have float.\n\n302\n00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.570\nThe first and\nthe last activity you don't have float.\n\n303\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.440\nWhere it can be a challenge is not\nevery project rounds off into one nice\n\n304\n00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.570\ntest like this.\n\n305\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.760\nYou might have a project that\nends in four different tasks.\n\n306\n00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.650\nIt's unfortunate, but it happens.\n\n307\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.100\nAnd in that case, you might need\nto calculate float on those, so\n\n308\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.030\ndon't just assume you don't need it.\n\n309\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.940\nBut when they round the project\noff to a single point like this,\n\n310\n00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.860\nthen there's never float\non the last activity or\n\n311\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.270\nthere's never float on the first activity\ncuz those are the beginning and the end.\n\n312\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.438\nBut if you have more than one end point,\nit is important.\n\n313\n00:15:31.438 --> 00:15:32.354\n>> Okay.\n\n314\n00:15:32.354 --> 00:15:34.322\n>> All right, now I'm gonna\nleave float off for right now,\n\n315\n00:15:34.322 --> 00:15:36.869\ncuz we'll calculate it in a minute,\nbut it's pretty straightforward.\n\n316\n00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:39.608\nNow I need to go backwards and\nsay, all right,\n\n317\n00:15:39.608 --> 00:15:44.870\nI need this activity to finish on the 13th\nif I want this project to be on schedule.\n\n318\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.970\nSo what can everybody else do?\n\n319\n00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.300\nWell, if I want this one\nto start on the 13th\n\n320\n00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.910\nthat means I need the predecessors\nto finish on the 12th.\n\n321\n00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.088\nThey've gotta be done on the 12th in\norder for this guy to start on the 13th.\n\n322\n00:15:56.088 --> 00:16:02.296\nAnd so, for the late finishes,\ntask H needs to be done by the 12th.\n\n323\n00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:06.586\nOtherwise this guy can't start on\nthe 13th, and same thing up here for D.\n\n324\n00:16:06.586 --> 00:16:08.420\nD needs a late finish.\n\n325\n00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.085\nThe latest it can finish\nis the 12th in order for\n\n326\n00:16:11.085 --> 00:16:14.030\nthis next activity start on the 13th,\nright?\n\n327\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.130\nSo again, thinking about calendar dates.\n\n328\n00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.470\nThis guy's the 13th, this other guy needs\nto finish on the 12th to make that room.\n\n329\n00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.010\nAnd now we just start going backwards,\nright?\n\n330\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.740\nBackwards subtracting our duration\ninstead of adding our duration.\n\n331\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.267\nSo if we did the top path here,\n\n332\n00:16:29.267 --> 00:16:33.917\nif this one has the latest it\ncan finish is the 12th and\n\n333\n00:16:33.917 --> 00:16:39.708\nit's a 3 day duration,\nthen the latest it can start is the 10th.\n\n334\n00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:41.930\nWe do 10th, 11th, 12th.\n\n335\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.280\nThree days, that's what it needs, and\n\n336\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.000\nif it starts on the tenth it can\nfinish on the 12th and we're fine.\n\n337\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.598\nThe last task can still start on the 13th.\n\n338\n00:16:49.598 --> 00:16:54.627\nIf I want this one to finish or to start\non the tenth, task C needs to finish\n\n339\n00:16:54.627 --> 00:16:59.655\non the ninth, and if it's a four day\nactivity well we've got the fifth,\n\n340\n00:16:59.655 --> 00:17:04.040\nsixth, seventh, oops I just made\nmy own mistake right there.\n\n341\n00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.770\nNot the fifth so this will be the sixth,\nseventh, eighth and ninth.\n\n342\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.240\nI would need it to start by the sixth,\nright.\n\n343\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.330\nSo it's gotta start by the sixth in order\nto finish by the ninth which will allow\n\n344\n00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:17.270\ntask d to start on the tenth, and\njust continuing backwards, this one's\n\n345\n00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.190\ngonna have a late start, or late finish\nof five, it's gonna finish on the fifth.\n\n346\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.880\nSo the next task can start on the sixth,\nand it's a two day activity so\n\n347\n00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.460\nThe latest is can start is the fourth so\nthat it will finish on the fifth.\n\n348\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.010\nAll right?\n\n349\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.500\nSo punching those in and\n\n350\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.220\njust thinking these are calendar days\ndefinitely makes a big difference.\n\n351\n00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.420\nAll right now let's go take\na look at that bottom path.\n\n352\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.470\nThe bottom paths a little bit longer so\nit'll take a little more work.\n\n353\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.596\nI say that, this is a one day duration,\n\n354\n00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:47.734\nso if I need it to finish on the 12th\nit's gonna have to start on the 12th.\n\n355\n00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:48.990\nWell, it's only one day.\n\n356\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.380\nTask G if I want task H\nto start on the 12th,\n\n357\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:58.262\nI need task G to finish on the 11th,\nright, and it's a four day duration.\n\n358\n00:17:58.262 --> 00:18:01.360\nSo if I subtract those four\ndays out I'll get eight.\n\n359\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.671\nSo now I've got the 8th through the 11th.\n\n360\n00:18:03.671 --> 00:18:07.627\nContinuing that on, task F I need\nit to finish on the seventh so\n\n361\n00:18:07.627 --> 00:18:10.137\nthat task G can start on the eighth, and\n\n362\n00:18:10.137 --> 00:18:15.232\nif its a five day duration I just subtract\ndown five days and I end up on the third,\n\n363\n00:18:15.232 --> 00:18:19.912\nand if I want it to start on the third I\nneed to ask E to finish on the second.\n\n364\n00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:23.779\nAnd it's a one day duration so\nit'll start on the second.\n\n365\n00:18:23.779 --> 00:18:26.055\nAnd that brings me all the way\nback to my original one.\n\n366\n00:18:26.055 --> 00:18:29.482\nNow on the exam, don't get too excited and\nwrite this two right here for\n\n367\n00:18:29.482 --> 00:18:33.250\nthe lead finish we need to compare\nit up here with this guy too.\n\n368\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.850\nWe're thinking about the latest\nthis one can finish and\n\n369\n00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.980\nhave both of these activities,\nB and E, run as planned.\n\n370\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:48.000\nSo if B, the latest it can start is 4,\nand E, the latest it can start is 2.\n\n371\n00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.240\nI need to take that\nlower number because if\n\n372\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.770\ntask A were to finish on the 3rd,\ntask E just missed its late start.\n\n373\n00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.270\nSo I have to pick the lowest number.\n\n374\n00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.050\nI can't delay that one.\n\n375\n00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.710\nSo if this one's gonna\nhave a late start of two,\n\n376\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.180\nthen the latest this one can\nfinish is on day one, and\n\n377\n00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.340\nthe latest it can start would be day one,\nbecause it's a duration of one.\n\n378\n00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.545\nNotice how on the first task,\nall my numbers are equal, and\n\n379\n00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:17.059\non the last task,\nall your numbers are equal.\n\n380\n00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:20.143\nThat's what you expect to see when\nyou have zero float, no float,\n\n381\n00:19:20.143 --> 00:19:23.270\nno flexibility cuz there's a beginning and\nan end.\n\n382\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.870\nEverywhere else in the project,\n\n383\n00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.310\nif you have no float,\nit's normally the critical path.\n\n384\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.980\nNot always, there's some exceptions,\nbut it normally is the critical path.\n\n385\n00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.360\nThat's a task that has no flexibility.\n\n386\n00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.410\nIt can't start earlier.\n\n387\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.540\nIt can't start later.\n\n388\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.020\nIt has to happen at this particular time,\nand\n\n389\n00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.220\nthat's critical because if it doesn't\nhappen at that particular time\n\n390\n00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.910\nour project is gonna be late, or\nearly which can be just as bad sometimes.\n\n391\n00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.560\nAll right, so\nnow we've got our numbers in place.\n\n392\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.930\nNow we've calculated our early start,\nour late start, our early finish,\n\n393\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:55.690\nour late finish.\n\n394\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.650\nWe've got all that put in place.\n\n395\n00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.830\nThe only thing left to do\nis calculate float, right?\n\n396\n00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.390\nAnd in a simple model like this, whichever\npath has zero float along the whole wave,\n\n397\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.000\nis our critical path, and\n\n398\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.020\nthe way we calculate out that\nfloat is we simply take.\n\n399\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.270\nWell, I had it on the screen earlier,\nright here.\n\n400\n00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.261\nOur late start, minus our early start.\n\n401\n00:20:17.261 --> 00:20:21.329\nThe latest we can start, and we subtract\nout the earliest we can start and\n\n402\n00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:23.543\nif they're equal it's gonna be zero.\n\n403\n00:20:23.543 --> 00:20:26.724\nAnd so, we have zero float, no flexibility\nor if it's a different number,\n\n404\n00:20:26.724 --> 00:20:30.056\nthen we have float, and it doesn't matter\nif you use late start, early start or\n\n405\n00:20:30.056 --> 00:20:33.220\nlate finish, early finish,\nyou'll end up with the same results.\n\n406\n00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.500\nJust pick one,\nI usually do the starts because.\n\n407\n00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.640\nA lot of times I might not even\nbother calculating out the finishes.\n\n408\n00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.070\nIf I'm just trying to find Float I can\nsave time and not calculate the finishes.\n\n409\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.230\nOn the exam you do have a timer\nthat you're competing against, so\n\n410\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.240\nyou don't necessarily need to\ncalculate things that you don't want.\n\n411\n00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.350\n>> Now Don, that actually brings up\na good point for the exam as well.\n\n412\n00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.790\nIs that a recommended method that you\nwould say hey, when it comes down to time,\n\n413\n00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.430\nlet's just calculate the starts instead?\n\n414\n00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:02.320\n>> On the exam, you need to do the bare\nminimum to get the answer you need, right?\n\n415\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.450\nBecause at the end of the day\nit's a multiple choice exam.\n\n416\n00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.290\nYou're graded on the answer you choose,\nnot how you got there.\n\n417\n00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.260\nSo if you know a shortcut method use it,\nright?\n\n418\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.980\nRemember the first thing I said was if\nthey're just asking me which one is\n\n419\n00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.760\nthe critical path and\nI've got a simple topology like this,\n\n420\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.870\nI don't do a forward and reverse path,\nI just add up in durations.\n\n421\n00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.610\nWhichever duration is the longest,\nthere is your critical path, right?\n\n422\n00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.760\nThat can save a ton of time, gives\nyou the right answer and you move on.\n\n423\n00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.960\nJust like, well in real life,\nwhat do you do?\n\n424\n00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.180\nPunch all this into Microsoft Project and\nyou're done,\n\n425\n00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.650\nyou're done in minutes, right?\n\n426\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.660\nSo on the exam we have to do it by hand.\n\n427\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.910\nIf they're asking me for early starts,\nand late starts, and things like that,\n\n428\n00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:42.060\nI'm gonna have to calculate it, right, but\nif they're just asking for float just by\n\n429\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:47.010\ncalculating out the earlies,\nthen I can figure that out.\n\n430\n00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.750\nWell, actually no I couldn't, could I?\n\n431\n00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.910\nI would need my early and\nmy late to subtract those out, and so\n\n432\n00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.050\nI am gonna have to do that forward and\nreverse path to get that float.\n\n433\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.690\nI'm gonna have to get\na little more data there.\n\n434\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.410\nSo you gotta figure out what is that\nbare minimum of data to get in and\n\n435\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:59.480\ncalculate it out.\n\n436\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.760\nNow if they're just asking me to find\nthe critical path and not the float,\n\n437\n00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.570\nI might still have to calculate float\njust to be able to figure out where that\n\n438\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.710\ncritical path is.\n\n439\n00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.720\nSo, you may end up having to do the whole\nprocess, but on the exam they know time is\n\n440\n00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.690\nof the essence so they won't normally\nmake you do the whole thing.\n\n441\n00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.680\nAll right, well let's go in here and\nfind out our float, and\n\n442\n00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.810\nthen we'll know where our critical path\nis, cuz technically I still don't know,\n\n443\n00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.740\nalthough you can kinda see\nit because of the numbers.\n\n444\n00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.840\nBut if we start running through and\ncalculating this out,\n\n445\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.110\nnow I know on my first task,\nand on my last task,\n\n446\n00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.950\nI know I've got zero float cuz\ntheir numbers are all equal, right?\n\n447\n00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.270\nAnywhere where you see all\nfour numbers are equal\n\n448\n00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.290\nthen you know it's gonna be that way,\nand not even necessarily all four.\n\n449\n00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.840\nIf the late start and early start\nare equal or the late finish and\n\n450\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.680\nearly finish are equal then you\nknow that it's gonna be zero float.\n\n451\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.410\nSo all along this bottom path,\nif I do 2 minus 2 I get 0.\n\n452\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.970\n3 minus 3 I get 0.\n\n453\n00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.060\n8 minus 8 I get 0.\n\n454\n00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.750\n11 minus 11, 12 minus 12 and so on.\n\n455\n00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.240\nI'm always ending up with 0 and\nthat's because there's no float all along\n\n456\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.620\nthe bottom, and so applying that late\nstart minus early start, or late\n\n457\n00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:07.110\nfinish minus early finish, they're gonna\nget me zero's across the base, right?\n\n458\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.340\nUp here though,\nare where the numbers are different, okay?\n\n459\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.560\nSo, if I take my late start and\nI subtract my early start.\n\n460\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.510\n4 minus 2?\n\n461\n00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.010\nThat's 2.\nAll right, so I've got 2 float, right?\n\n462\n00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.990\nI could have done my late finish minus my\nearly finish, 5 minus 3, and I would have\n\n463\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.880\ngotten 2, you get the same value that's\nwhy it doesn't matter which one you use,\n\n464\n00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.800\nyou should, assuming you\nfilled these squares in right,\n\n465\n00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.090\nyou should get the same value.\n\n466\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.010\n>> And that brings up a good point right,\nthat if you're saying that it should do\n\n467\n00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:39.360\nthat, if I get different values on\nsubtracting the earlys versus the lates.\n\n468\n00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.140\n>> You've got a problem.\n\n469\n00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:40.995\n>> Then I've got a problem.\n\n470\n00:23:40.995 --> 00:23:44.690\n>> [LAUGH] And if they're small numbers\nlike this, it's easy enough to check, but\n\n471\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:49.510\nI'll just keep running through 6 minus 4\nis 2, 9 minus 7 is 2, 10 minus 8 is 2,\n\n472\n00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:50.950\n12 minus 10 is 2 right?\n\n473\n00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.017\nSo I'm ending up with 2 across the board,\nand\n\n474\n00:23:53.017 --> 00:23:55.087\njust like that I've got\nmy float calculated.\n\n475\n00:23:55.087 --> 00:23:58.768\nFloats easy to calculate once you have the\nvalues, once you have your late start and\n\n476\n00:23:58.768 --> 00:24:02.360\nearly start, or late finish early finish,\nonce you have those things in there.\n\n477\n00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.337\nYou can calculate those out really fast,\nall right?\n\n478\n00:24:05.337 --> 00:24:08.447\nAnd if all they're asking me\nis where my critical path is,\n\n479\n00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.700\nit becomes really obvious here, right?\n\n480\n00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.895\nI've got float on the top path.\n\n481\n00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.100\nI'm gonna say an absolute,\nwhich I shouldn't.\n\n482\n00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.160\nBut you never have float\non a critical path.\n\n483\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.940\nThere are some little exceptions that\ncan occur if you've got things like\n\n484\n00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.040\nconstraints in your project.\n\n485\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.920\nBut as far as PMI is concerned, you\nnever have float in your critical path.\n\n486\n00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.750\nSo when I look up here at B, C, and D,\n\n487\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.988\nbecause I've got float,\nthat means these guys are not critical.\n\n488\n00:24:34.988 --> 00:24:37.020\nThese guys have a little\nbit of breathing room.\n\n489\n00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.360\nThey could still impact the project.\n\n490\n00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.560\nI could still end up behind\nschedule because of these guys.\n\n491\n00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.520\nBut assuming things are running\nthe way they're supposed to,\n\n492\n00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.050\nthese guys have wiggle room.\n\n493\n00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.510\nAnd so they're not critical.\n\n494\n00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:53.440\nBut, down here, E, F, G, H, I've got\nzero float all the way across that line.\n\n495\n00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.620\nI've got no wiggle room.\n\n496\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.130\nThose are critical,\nthat's my critical path.\n\n497\n00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.560\nA, E, F, G, H, I, this whole bottom path,\nthose are critical.\n\n498\n00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.310\nIf any one of those tasks falls behind,\nmy project falls behind.\n\n499\n00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.650\nAnd I go from being a 13 day project to\nbeing a 14 or, 15 or, 16 day project,\n\n500\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.250\nas we fall further and\nfurther behind, right?\n\n501\n00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.730\nSo now we've spotted that\ncritical path and we've got it.\n\n502\n00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:24.710\nThere's one more thing we might be tasked\nwith on the exam, and that is free float.\n\n503\n00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.780\nOkay, now I calculated float,\nand float's the most common.\n\n504\n00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.260\nThat's what we worry about, or if you use\nMicrosoft Project this would be slack.\n\n505\n00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.050\nAnd so we're calculating that out.\n\n506\n00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.370\nOn the exam, they'll always call it float.\n\n507\n00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.210\nFree float's a little bit different.\n\n508\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.680\nThe definition of float,\nis any activity that could fall behind\n\n509\n00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.020\nwithout impacting the project, right,\ntalking about the project as a whole.\n\n510\n00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.320\nBut free float,\nis where an activity can fall behind and\n\n511\n00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.578\nnot impact any other activity, right?\n\n512\n00:25:53.578 --> 00:25:57.880\nTechnically, B has two days of free,\ntwo days of float.\n\n513\n00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.370\nSo it could fall behind two days and\nmy project could still finish on schedule.\n\n514\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:07.860\nBut if it falls behind two days,\nif it was supposed to start on the second,\n\n515\n00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:12.990\nand instead it starts on the fourth,\nwell can task c start on the fourth?\n\n516\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.360\nNo, it now starts on the sixth.\n\n517\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.710\nAll right?\nAnd we know that's okay.\n\n518\n00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.830\nIt can start on the sixth and\nwe'll still finish on time.\n\n519\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.100\nBut this one just got\nbumped back two days.\n\n520\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.970\nWhat if I had contractors scheduled\nto be here on the fourth?\n\n521\n00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.400\nAnd this one falls behind.\n\n522\n00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.750\nAnd now I tell the contractors,\nhey can you come out on the sixth instead?\n\n523\n00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.100\nAnd they say,\nno I'm sorry we're booked for another job.\n\n524\n00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:38.550\nWell this task could have started on\nthe sixth, and I'd finish on time.\n\n525\n00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.070\nBut now I don't have contractors.\n\n526\n00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.770\nNow I've got a problem.\n\n527\n00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:45.460\nAll right, so on the exam,\nflow is usually what they go for, but\n\n528\n00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.310\nin real life land free float is\nwhat we normally care about.\n\n529\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:53.080\nBecause just because this activity\ncan fall behind two days,\n\n530\n00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.270\ndoesn't mean we want that to happen.\n\n531\n00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.260\nEspecially if you've got contractors\nscheduled on particular days, right.\n\n532\n00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.790\nYou can have staff issues.\n\n533\n00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.621\nI might have staff assigned to work\ntask C on the fourth and fifth.\n\n534\n00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.350\nBut then on the sixth and seventh, I might\nhave them scheduled to come down here and\n\n535\n00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.830\nhelp on task F.\n\n536\n00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:12.080\nAnd now if this one falls behind,\nI can't have them help on task F, and\n\n537\n00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.960\ntask F falls behind, right?\n\n538\n00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.048\nI might have my employees\nspread across that way.\n\n539\n00:27:17.048 --> 00:27:19.490\nSo free float's a little\nharder to calculate,\n\n540\n00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:24.900\nbecause basically what you have to look\nat is environments where you have a gap\n\n541\n00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.870\nin between the finish of one task,\nand the start of the next.\n\n542\n00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.330\nSee how this one finished on the third and\nthe next one starts on the fourth?\n\n543\n00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:33.480\nThere's no gap.\n\n544\n00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.570\nThis on finishes on the seventh,\nthe next one starts on the eighth.\n\n545\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.150\nThere's no gap.\n\n546\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:43.010\nBut this one finished on the tenth and\nthe next task starts on the 13th.\n\n547\n00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.480\nThere's a gap, right?\n\n548\n00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.470\nThere's a gap of two days,\nthe 11th and the 12th, and\n\n549\n00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:54.110\nduring that time we have a gap where\ntask D could fall behind two days,\n\n550\n00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:58.130\nand we'd be okay, because this one isn't\nscheduled to start until the 13th.\n\n551\n00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.560\nThat's called free float.\n\n552\n00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.530\nSo, while I've got two\ndays across the top here,\n\n553\n00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.570\nthis one is actually\na little bit special right?\n\n554\n00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.710\nThese are just regular old float,\nbut this one is free float.\n\n555\n00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.720\nAnd free float is worth\nit's weight in gold,\n\n556\n00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.130\nthat's the one that doesn't\nimpact your project at all.\n\n557\n00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.410\nYou don't really have to take any kind\nof special measures when you use it.\n\n558\n00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.580\nVersus these other ones that\nwould continually push the other\n\n559\n00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.800\nactivities behind.\n\n560\n00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.250\nSo on the exam they may ask\nyou to locate free float.\n\n561\n00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.330\nWhich of the following\ntasks has free float?\n\n562\n00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.480\nAnd now you've gotta calculate it out,\nyou've gotta figure out your\n\n563\n00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.550\nearly start and late start, and\nyour early finish and late finish.\n\n564\n00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:37.210\nSo then you can spot where the gaps\nare in between the tasks, and\n\n565\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.710\nthat's where your free float is.\n\n566\n00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.060\nI've you've got no gaps,\nyou've got no free float, you may not.\n\n567\n00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.500\nRight?\nSo it's important to note that.\n\n568\n00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.870\n>> Now Don, that's a great example for us,\na great reminder of some of the things we\n\n569\n00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.080\nmay have forgotten along the way as\nwe've been preparing for the exam.\n\n570\n00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.030\nAnd it's something that we\nreally need to pay attention to.\n\n571\n00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.250\nBeing able to determine\nthat overall critical path.\n\n572\n00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.800\nA lot of times we take a look at these\nnumbers and we get a little bit confused.\n\n573\n00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.260\nGo back, watch this episode, make sure\nyou do take a note of this example.\n\n574\n00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.870\nWork through the math,\nfeel very comfortable with it.\n\n575\n00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.770\nBut, we've got some more\nexamples coming up.\n\n576\n00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.440\nDon, any last words on just\nthis first example here?\n\n577\n00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.580\n>> Just run through them.\n\n578\n00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.470\nAnd maybe I'll show it in another episode.\n\n579\n00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.780\nIf you have Microsoft Project,\n\n580\n00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.600\nyou can actually create diagrams\nlike this in Microsoft Project.\n\n581\n00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.610\nAnd you can create a project,\nwork it out yourself.\n\n582\n00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.020\nAnd feed it all into Microsoft Project and\nit kinda grades you.\n\n583\n00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.640\nSo you can create your own\npractice tests for these things.\n\n584\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.650\nBut just get used to it.\n\n585\n00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.260\nRun through them.\n\n586\n00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.450\nRun forward, run backwards.\n\n587\n00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.160\nCheck your work.\n\n588\n00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.990\nIt's easy to make mistakes,\nespecially if we're not thinking of days.\n\n589\n00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.560\nIf we're thinking of\nnumbers instead of days,\n\n590\n00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.750\nit's easy to kinda screw things up there.\n\n591\n00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.020\nSo definitely be wary of that, and\nalways double check your work.\n\n592\n00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.410\nAnd just get to where you're\nproficient and fast at it.\n\n593\n00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.990\n>> Well, Don, thank you again for\nshowing us that example.\n\n594\n00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.040\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n595\n00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.830\nSigning off for I-T Pro T-V,\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n596\n00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.460\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n597\n00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.877\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n598\n00:29:55.877 --> 00:30:02.520\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.236\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're going to be taking a look at PMP.\n\n4\n00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:21.570\nThe Project Management Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.890\nWe're specifically going to be looking\nat calculating the critical path method.\n\n6\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.860\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.950\nDon, how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.000\n>> It is going great, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.050\nReady to jump right back into\nCPM with another example.\n\n10\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.070\nIf you haven't watched already,\nwe filmed a first example problem.\n\n11\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.020\nWhere we walked through the whole\nprocess of calculating it out.\n\n12\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.650\nAnd we used a pretty straightforward\nproject schedule network diagram.\n\n13\n00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.260\nThe kind that you'll see on\nmost textbooks or whatever.\n\n14\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.420\nBut I wanted to do another example that\ngoes a little more complex, right.\n\n15\n00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.710\nBecause anybody can do\nthe simple diagrams.\n\n16\n00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.020\nWhen you start adding in\na few multiple paths,\n\n17\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.470\nnow you really start to get a challenge.\n\n18\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.150\nSo, in this example we're going\nto go a little more complex.\n\n19\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.950\nLet me just bring this\nup here on my laptop and\n\n20\n00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.800\nsimilar model to what we saw before.\n\n21\n00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.700\nWe had a long path and a short path, but\n\n22\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.430\nnow we've got a cross in the middle and\nthat's really challenging.\n\n23\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.040\nBecause what might happen is,\n\n24\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.990\nyou might have a critical path\nthat runs across the top.\n\n25\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.710\nYou might have a critical path\nthat runs across the bottom.\n\n26\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.380\nOr you might have a critical path\nthat starts on the bottom and\n\n27\n00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.490\njumps up to the top.\n\n28\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.100\nAnd comes across like that a little\nsnake kind of going through the project.\n\n29\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.660\nSo, you can really end up with some\ninteresting stuff this way, and\n\n30\n00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.340\nit takes a little more work.\n\n31\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.618\nThis one's harder to just look at and\nguess and be done with.\n\n32\n00:01:32.618 --> 00:01:33.840\nYou're going to have to calculate it out,\n\n33\n00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.010\nso it makes things just\na little more exciting.\n\n34\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.090\nAll right, so\nwhat I want to do is run through this one.\n\n35\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.090\nI've just blanked everything out except\nfor the task name and the duration.\n\n36\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.270\nBecause normally,\n\n37\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.440\nWhen we're doing the planning phase of our\nproject this is all we have at this point.\n\n38\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.320\nAnd so we start calculating things out to\nfigure out how long our project's gonna\n\n39\n00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.400\ntake and where we have float.\n\n40\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.930\nThe only difference here\nis that we just have to pay\n\n41\n00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.610\nattention to a few extra dependencies.\n\n42\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.280\nThat might be in place,\nlike here in Task G and over in Task I, so\n\n43\n00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.596\nwe'll watch out for those.\n\n44\n00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:03.290\nBut I'm going to start right at\nthe very beginning with task A, and\n\n45\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.280\nwe'll just start filling this out.\n\n46\n00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.700\nNow remember,\nwhen you look at these boxes,\n\n47\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.120\nwhat these fields align to\nare the early start, and\n\n48\n00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.480\nthe early finish, the late start,\nand the late finish, right?\n\n49\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.020\nAnd so, I'm starting with the early\nstart and the early finish.\n\n50\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.420\nAnd we're just going to play in\nthe earlys all the way across.\n\n51\n00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.950\nAnd then, we'll come back and\ndo the lates on the reverse pass.\n\n52\n00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.260\nSo on our forward pass.\n\n53\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.090\nit's all about earlys.\n\n54\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.750\nThis is a one day duration, so\nI'm going to come in here and\n\n55\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.540\njust say that's one day.\n\n56\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.160\nAnd if it's one day then it's\ngoing to finish on one day.\n\n57\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.370\nAnd remember from the first example,\nI like to think of these as dates, right.\n\n58\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.390\nSo if this starts on January first,\nit's going to finish on January first.\n\n59\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.668\nBecause it's a one day duration,\nall right.\n\n60\n00:02:46.668 --> 00:02:50.840\nNow, task one then branches out\nto task E and task B, right.\n\n61\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.430\nSo, it branches out these two.\n\n62\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.610\nAnd if task A can't\nfinish until the first,\n\n63\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.020\nthese guys can't start until the second,\nright, the next day.\n\n64\n00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.740\nSo, I'm going to come in and\n\n65\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.140\npopulate the early starts of\nthese two guys with the second.\n\n66\n00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.940\nFrom there, I can now start to\nplot out each of these separately,\n\n67\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.100\nif I want, right.\n\n68\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.600\nSo, I'll go up here to the top, and\nI'll start to plan this one, right.\n\n69\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.870\nSo, we've got task E\nstarting on the second.\n\n70\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.400\nIt's a one day duration, so\nit will finish on the second.\n\n71\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.650\nAnd if it's done on January 2nd,\n\n72\n00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.760\nthat means that task F\ncan start on January 3rd.\n\n73\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.200\nAnd it's a one day duration, so it can\nstart, or it can finish on the third.\n\n74\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.150\nAnd then, that means that G can\nget started on the third, right.\n\n75\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.920\nWell, I'm not sure.\n\n76\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.420\nWait, I shouldn't have said the third,\nI should have said the fourth, right.\n\n77\n00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.500\nSo, if task F finishes January third, task\nG should be able to start January fourth.\n\n78\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.580\nIt should, except I do have this\nother dependency down here.\n\n79\n00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.270\nRight, it's dependent on task C,\n\n80\n00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.236\nand I don't know when task\nC is gonna finish yet.\n\n81\n00:03:52.236 --> 00:03:55.940\nSo, I'm going to have to stop\nworking the top path and go down and\n\n82\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.868\nwork the bottom path.\n\n83\n00:03:56.868 --> 00:04:00.160\nI got to work these two guys down here,\nto figure out when task G can start.\n\n84\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.400\nSo, I'm going tohave to create\na little interruption there.\n\n85\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.230\nThat's the complexity we have\nwith more than one path.\n\n86\n00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.610\nSo, I'll just go down here to B,\nand with B we've got,\n\n87\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.840\nit can start on January second.\n\n88\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.850\nIt's a two day duration, so that means\nit'll finish on January third, right.\n\n89\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.910\nIt takes January second and\nJanuary third, two days.\n\n90\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.680\nThat means that task C can start on\nJanuary 4th, and it takes two days.\n\n91\n00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.908\nSo, it'll finish on January fifth,\nso now we're up to January fifth.\n\n92\n00:04:27.908 --> 00:04:32.130\nAnd now I can come up here and\nI can look at task G.\n\n93\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.890\nNotice that task F\nfinished on January third,\n\n94\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.190\nbut task C didn't finish\nuntil January fifth.\n\n95\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.726\nSo, that means that task G cannot\nstart until January sixth.\n\n96\n00:04:42.726 --> 00:04:44.460\nThe earliest it can\nstart is January sixth,\n\n97\n00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.340\nbecause it's having to\nwait on that other task.\n\n98\n00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.820\nNow, if it starts on January sixth and\nit's a three day duration,\n\n99\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.260\nthat means it'll finish on January eighth,\nright?\n\n100\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.280\nThe sixth, the seventh and the eighth,\nand then we can continue to move on.\n\n101\n00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.260\nTask H can start on the ninth,\nand it is a three day duration,\n\n102\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.720\nso it'll finish on the 11th.\n\n103\n00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.600\nAnd then that brings me down to I,\nbut I can't calculate I,\n\n104\n00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.550\nbecause it also has another dependency.\n\n105\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.700\nSo, I'm done with my top path, right?\n\n106\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.650\nSo, I've got my early starts and early\nfinishes all the way across the top path.\n\n107\n00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.500\nNow, I need to jump down here and\nfinish off the bottom path.\n\n108\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.920\nI'm already most of the way on that,\nright, because we had to do B and\n\n109\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.490\nC a minute ago.\n\n110\n00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.880\nSo if I take a look at D, well if task\nC doesn't finish until the fifth.\n\n111\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.260\nThat means that task D can't\nstart until the sixth.\n\n112\n00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.240\nAnd it's a five day duration, so\nit's going to finish on the tenth.\n\n113\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.320\nAnd again, I know what you're thinking,\nten minus six is only four right, but\n\n114\n00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.480\nremember these are dates.\n\n115\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.740\nSo, it's the sixth, seventh,\neighth, ninth, ten`th, five days.\n\n116\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.660\nSo, it's going to finish on the tenth.\n\n117\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.430\nNow, I know that D is\ngonna finish on the tenth.\n\n118\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.920\nAnd H is gonna finish on the 11th.\n\n119\n00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.165\nSo for task I, It can't start on the 11th\nwhen this guy down here has done it.\n\n120\n00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:58.910\nBecause it's got to wait for\nH to finish also.\n\n121\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.910\nSo it's gonna start on the 12th,\nand it's a one-day duration.\n\n122\n00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.790\nSo it's gonna finish on the 12th, and so\nI'll just go and populate that in there.\n\n123\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.240\nAnd now, I've got my forward pass.\n\n124\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.740\nI've got my early starts and early\nfinishes, all the way across the board.\n\n125\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.290\nAnd I've got that mapped out, all right.\n\n126\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.500\nNow if all we need to do,\n\n127\n00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.410\nis figure out float, you can actually\nspot some of the float right now, right?\n\n128\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.500\nAnywhere that you see gaps,\nyou're going to have float.\n\n129\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.180\nBut there's some spots that\ndon't quite show up that way.\n\n130\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.790\nAnd so, we may need to go and\ncontinue to figure out other things.\n\n131\n00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.070\nIf you're looking for free float,\nyou can find it right here.\n\n132\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.030\nWith just the early starts being\nmapped out and early finishes.\n\n133\n00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.550\nBut if we want to find just regular float,\nwe need to calculate our late starts and\n\n134\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.316\nlate finishes also.\n\n135\n00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:45.710\nSo, we're going to have to\ndo our reverse pass and\n\n136\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.800\nfigure out all the late information,\nright?\n\n137\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.520\nSo, I'll start and\njust run it backwards, right?\n\n138\n00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.739\nWe'll start over here on I, and\n\n139\n00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:57.340\nwe're going to take where it's the latest\nit can finish is the 12th, right?\n\n140\n00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.690\nI've got to finish at the same\ntime as the early finish if,\n\n141\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.150\nI want it to be on that schedule.\n\n142\n00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.870\nAnd if it's one day duration, that means\nit's got to late start on the 12th, right?\n\n143\n00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.080\nNo variation there and\n\n144\n00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.190\nwe expect to see that any time\nyou have a zero float, right?\n\n145\n00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.540\n12 minus 12 is zero, that's what I get.\n\n146\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.520\nAll right, now I can take\nthat back to the other guys.\n\n147\n00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.180\nIf I want this one to have a late start of\nthe 12th, that means the late finish for\n\n148\n00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.200\nthe task before it has to be the 11th.\n\n149\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.950\nSo, I'll take task H and\nmake its late finish the 11th.\n\n150\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.540\nAnd I'll take task D and\nmake it's late finish the 11th.\n\n151\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.100\nThen we can start calculating\nthese out beyond it.\n\n152\n00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.540\nWell, it does get a little challenging,\n\n153\n00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.600\nbecause of our more than one path\nkind of scenario that we've got.\n\n154\n00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.980\nSo, let's go and start working these out.\n\n155\n00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.620\nI'll start up here at the top.\n\n156\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:50.790\nSo, if I want this one to late finish on\nthe 11th, then the latest it can start.\n\n157\n00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.850\nIt's a three day duration, so\n\n158\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.290\nthe latest it can start is\ngoing to be the ninth, right.\n\n159\n00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.610\nSo, I take January 11th and\n\n160\n00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.520\nI roll it back three days to January\nninth, that's the latest it can start.\n\n161\n00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.220\nAnd if that, when it needs to start,\nthat's the latest it can start.\n\n162\n00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.820\nThat means the latest that G can finish,\nis going to be the eighth, all right.\n\n163\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.810\nAnd, if it's a three day duration,\n\n164\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.332\nthat means the latest it can start,\nis going to be the sixth.\n\n165\n00:08:14.332 --> 00:08:16.420\nNow, notice I calculated that out and\n\n166\n00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.430\nI didn't even worry about\nthese dependencies, right.\n\n167\n00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.760\nAnd that's because the direction\nI'm going in, I'm going backwards.\n\n168\n00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.150\nAnd so, it only has one\ndependency going backwards and\n\n169\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.110\nthat's why I can fill that out right now,\nall right.\n\n170\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.290\nBut, where things get a little\nweird is going beyond that.\n\n171\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.150\nIf I'm just working out the top path,\n\n172\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.170\nI can just keep going\nright across the top path.\n\n173\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.080\nSee how it's a single chain of\ndependencies going that way?\n\n174\n00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.270\nAnd so for F,\nif I want it to not bump G, right?\n\n175\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.885\nThe latest G can start is the sixth,\n\n176\n00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:46.350\nao the latest F can finish\nis going to be the fifth.\n\n177\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.720\nAnd it's a one day duration,\n\n178\n00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.360\nso I'll plot that five right there for\nthe late start also.\n\n179\n00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.080\nAnd if it's going to start on the fifth,\n\n180\n00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.870\nthen the latest E can\nfinish is the fourth.\n\n181\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.102\nAnd it's a one day duration, so\nI can plop a four right there too.\n\n182\n00:08:59.102 --> 00:09:01.590\nAll right, so\nthat was real easy running across the top.\n\n183\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.470\nRunning across the bottom,\nwell I've already calculated part of D\n\n184\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.480\nbecause I put in In that late finish,\nright.\n\n185\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.035\nC is the one that's\ngoing to be a challenge,\n\n186\n00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:15.480\nbecause going backwards\nC has two dependencies.\n\n187\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.250\nAnd I'll have to figure out which\none is the worst-case scenario to\n\n188\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.660\nbe able to use it, right.\n\n189\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.140\nBut for D,\nthe latest it can finish is on the 11th.\n\n190\n00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.080\nAnd if it's a five-day duration,\n\n191\n00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.160\nthat means the latest it can\nstart Is the seventh, right.\n\n192\n00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.170\nSo, if it starts on the seventh and\n\n193\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.370\nwe count up five days we end up\non the 11th, and that's perfect.\n\n194\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.450\nFor C,\nif I want task D to start on the seventh,\n\n195\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.410\nthe latest it can start is on the seventh.\n\n196\n00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.530\nThat means C needs to be\ndone by the sixth, right?\n\n197\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:49.660\nBut I also have this other one up here,\nand the latest ti can start is the sixth.\n\n198\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:55.510\nSo really, the latest that C can\nfinish is going to be the fifth.\n\n199\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.470\nSo that, this guy will be able\nto start on the sixth, remember,\n\n200\n00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.270\nyou've got to look at both.\n\n201\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.170\nWhen you've got a dependency,\n\n202\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.860\nyou've got to look at everybody\ninvolved in that dependency.\n\n203\n00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.200\nC is tied to G and D, all right.\n\n204\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.810\nSo, I've got to look at their late starts\nand pick the earliest of the late starts.\n\n205\n00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.350\nIt's kind of mixing a lot\nof terminology there, but\n\n206\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.718\nfinding the lowest number, all right.\n\n207\n00:10:13.718 --> 00:10:14.770\nSo the sixth,\n\n208\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.410\nthat's the lowest number, that means\nthis guys needs to done by the fifth.\n\n209\n00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.090\nAnd if it's a two day duration,\n\n210\n00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.820\nthat means the latest that\nit can start is the fourth.\n\n211\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.600\nAnd continue on with that logic.\n\n212\n00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.370\nThat means for\nB it's got to be done by the third, for\n\n213\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.650\nthis one to start on the fourth.\n\n214\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.540\nAnd it's a two day duration, so the second\nis when it's going to need to start.\n\n215\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.370\nAnd then that brings us all\nthe way back to our original task.\n\n216\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.890\nWhich if this one,\nif task B has a late start of day two,\n\n217\n00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.580\nand task E has a late start of day four.\n\n218\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.450\nI've got to pick the lowest number,\nday two.\n\n219\n00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.060\nAnd that means, that task A needs to\nbe wrapped up by day one in order or\n\n220\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.670\ntask B to happen on day two.\n\n221\n00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.820\nAnd, if it's a one day duration and\nit's got to finish on day one.\n\n222\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.510\nThat means it's got to start on day one,\nand that's mapped out, all right.\n\n223\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.790\nSo, now we've filled out our values and\n\n224\n00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.620\nwe've taken into account that\nextra path that we have in there.\n\n225\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.300\nRight, definitely something we\ngot to keep an eye out for.\n\n226\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.879\nEasy to overlook.\n\n227\n00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.080\nNow that's done, we can go through and\ncalculate our float.\n\n228\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.970\nAnd our float's going to be a little\nbit weird her,e because of how this\n\n229\n00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.660\npath is laid out.\n\n230\n00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.360\nOn my first and my last activity,\n\n231\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.200\nI pretty much know those\nare going to be zeros, right.\n\n232\n00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.800\nSo, nothing too exciting there.\n\n233\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.480\nThen I just run through subtracting\nmy early start from the late start.\n\n234\n00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.800\nOr subtracting my early\nfinish from the late finish.\n\n235\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.710\nSo, the formula actually reads like,\nlate finish minus early finish, or\n\n236\n00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.550\nlate start minus early start.\n\n237\n00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.042\nSo, four minus two is two.\n\n238\n00:11:41.042 --> 00:11:44.450\nRight and that's the same for\nboth of these.\n\n239\n00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.479\nFive minus three is, well, two, and\nit's the same for both of these.\n\n240\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:56.150\nThen I've got six minus six or eight\nminus eight, so that's going to be zero.\n\n241\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:02.300\nAnd notice over here, even though I don't\nshow a giant gap between these, right.\n\n242\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.890\nThe early start early finish,\nwhatever, there's not a giant gap,\n\n243\n00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.830\nyou still end up with float.\n\n244\n00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.219\nThat's something that can\nbe misleading sometimes.\n\n245\n00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.070\nNine minus nine, or\n11 minus 11 are both going to be zero.\n\n246\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.120\nAnd there's my top path, and now,\nlet's go down to the bottom path.\n\n247\n00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.740\nTwo minus two or three minus three,\nthey're going to be zero.\n\n248\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.510\nFour minus four or\nfive minus five are zero.\n\n249\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.159\nAnd then, seven minus six,\nor 11 minus 10 are both one.\n\n250\n00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.550\nAll right.\n\n251\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.630\nSo, what we end up with is\nsomething interesting, right.\n\n252\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.980\nIn our previous example,\n\n253\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.042\nwhich was a pretty simple one,\nthe float was really all along one path.\n\n254\n00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:40.360\nBut here,I've got float in more than one\npath, because I've got more than one path.\n\n255\n00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.620\nSo, when you have three or more paths,\nyou can end up with divisions like this.\n\n256\n00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.920\nAnd that's what I see, is I've got\nfloat of two here, float of two here,\n\n257\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.510\nfloat of one down here.\n\n258\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.310\nBut all I have to do is look for\nthe path that's all zeros, and\n\n259\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.980\nthere's my critical path, right?\n\n260\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.212\nSo, starting here at A,\nI've got zero, B is zero,\n\n261\n00:12:58.212 --> 00:13:02.220\nC is zero, G is zero,\nH is zero, I is zero.\n\n262\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.230\nSo, the critical path winds through this\ntopology and I could probably redraw this.\n\n263\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.400\nAnd make it where it didn't wind but\nthe way that it's drawn,\n\n264\n00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.060\nit looks like that, right?\n\n265\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.820\nSo, E and F are non-critical tasks and\nD is a non-critical task and so\n\n266\n00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.570\nthey all have float.\n\n267\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.350\nAnd remember what I said at\nthe end of the last example was,\n\n268\n00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.220\nfloat is nice, free float is better.\n\n269\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.230\nSo, here's where I need to go and\n\n270\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.060\nstart looking for gaps to identify\nanywhere that we have free float.\n\n271\n00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.260\nAnd, you can ignore all the ones\nthat have a float with a zero.\n\n272\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.910\nThere's only a few that\nactually have float.\n\n273\n00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.120\nAnd what I'm looking for,\nis anywhere the early\n\n274\n00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.570\nfinish, has a gap with the early\nstart of the next one.\n\n275\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.930\nOr you could do the lates also,\nit would be the same.\n\n276\n00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.620\nSo I see a gap here, 10 to 12, right.\n\n277\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.910\nSo there's actually a gap here of two\ndays, right, the 11th and the 12th.\n\n278\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.410\nAnd I'm sorry a gap of one day, right?\n\n279\n00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.870\nSo, I need to finish on the tenth,\n\n280\n00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.480\nbut if I finish on the 11th,\nthis guy can still start on the 12th.\n\n281\n00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.280\nSo, there's a gap of one day in there.\n\n282\n00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.640\nWhich I have, one day of float,\nI already knew that gap was there.\n\n283\n00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.870\nBut in this case, it's free float,\n\n284\n00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.850\nbecause if it delays,\nno other activity is impacted, right.\n\n285\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.700\nThat's different than task E up here,\nright.\n\n286\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.390\nIt's got two days of float, but\n\n287\n00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.530\nif it finishes on the second,\nactivity F can start on the third.\n\n288\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.590\nBut if it finishes on the third, activity\nF can't start on the third, can it?\n\n289\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.150\nIt's got to move back to the fourth.\n\n290\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:36.370\nSo Activity F is impacted when\nactivity E uses its float.\n\n291\n00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.670\nSo, that's just regular old float.\n\n292\n00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.840\nBut if you look at activity F,\nthere's a gap.\n\n293\n00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.390\nThe fourth and the fifth of January are\nempty in between these two activities, so\n\n294\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.890\nthat's free float.\n\n295\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.910\nYou should look for that gap,\nreal easy way to spot that free float.\n\n296\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.000\nSo, I've got free float on\ntwo different activities.\n\n297\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.220\nI have regular old float here on E.\n\n298\n00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.310\nIf E gets delayed, F gets delayed,\n\n299\n00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.100\nbut we do not necessarily\nimpact the rest of the project.\n\n300\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.178\nIf D gets delayed it's fine.\n\n301\n00:15:04.178 --> 00:15:06.210\nBut these other ones,\nall the critical activities,\n\n302\n00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.842\nwhich unfortunately is most of my project.\n\n303\n00:15:07.842 --> 00:15:12.510\nThose can't get delayed, those are really\ncritical, we got to stay on target.\n\n304\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.530\nBut right there we just did\na forward pass and a backwards pass.\n\n305\n00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.440\nAnd we calculated our float and\nour free float.\n\n306\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.110\nAnd we did it all significantly\nfaster than example one, right?\n\n307\n00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.800\nIn example one, we walked through it very\nmethodically and got a chance to see it.\n\n308\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.080\nBut here we're just applying our\nknowledge, we're moving faster.\n\n309\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.950\nAnd the more you practice with these,\nthe faster you'll get.\n\n310\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.200\nAnd what you'll find is, you should be\nable to take the example I gave you.\n\n311\n00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.910\nAnd probably in under two minutes,\ncalculate it out forward and\n\n312\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:37.710\nbackwards of float.\n\n313\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.110\nIt should be able to go very quickly.\n\n314\n00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.380\nIf you're not having to\nexplain it like I am,\n\n315\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.910\nyou can move through these\nthings very rapidly.\n\n316\n00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.590\nWhich also means there's room for\nmistakes.\n\n317\n00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.383\nYou do want to double check and\nmake sure you did good math.\n\n318\n00:15:48.383 --> 00:15:50.230\nI can be bad at the math sometimes.\n\n319\n00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.040\n>> And Don, I think you reminded\nus in the previous episode\n\n320\n00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.950\nthat the very fact is that\nwhen we calculate that float.\n\n321\n00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.740\nRegardless of whether we're doing\nthe early finish or late finish.\n\n322\n00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.450\nWhen we actually are calculating the,\nI keep getting the acronyms wrong,\n\n323\n00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.240\nbut each side should actually be the same.\n\n324\n00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.510\nSo, if you do get different numbers when\nyou're trying to calculate that out.\n\n325\n00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.450\nWhether you're doing the late or\nthe early.\n\n326\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.410\nThen you know, that you probably, actually\nadded those numbers up somewhere wrong.\n\n327\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.430\nso, go back, check your math and that's\nprobably the critical thing for us to do.\n\n328\n00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.410\nYou notice that we've actually only\ndone fairly simple math at this point.\n\n329\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.810\nWe've haven't had to go in and\nout some algebraic equations.\n\n330\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.040\nWe haven't had to do very much,\nbut simply by following that rule.\n\n331\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.620\nAnd Don added in a little bit of\ncomplexity for us by showing us that\n\n332\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.320\nsome paths can actually end up diverging\nor taking two different methods there.\n\n333\n00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.070\nAnd what we have to do, is watch out for\n\n334\n00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.370\nthose little gotchas there, about how\nthat actually determines our next step.\n\n335\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.560\nSo make sure you pay attention to that.\n\n336\n00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.470\nMake sure you watch this episode again.\n\n337\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.140\nDon, any other methods or any other things\nthat we can actually give as hints for\n\n338\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.570\nsomebody getting ready for the PMP here?\n\n339\n00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.840\n>> The big thing is on the exam,\n\n340\n00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.540\nthey're never going to have you\ncalculate out a whole chart like this.\n\n341\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.920\nBecause they know there's a timer.\n\n342\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.255\nThey kind of built\nthe exam Exam around that.\n\n343\n00:16:58.255 --> 00:17:01.605\nSo, they're normally going to ask you\nto look into just one box, right?\n\n344\n00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:02.635\nNot the whole thing.\n\n345\n00:17:02.635 --> 00:17:05.225\nAnd so,\nstay tuned because in example three,\n\n346\n00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:06.985\nwe're going to do it a little\nmore like the exam does.\n\n347\n00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:08.885\nWe're going to focus in\non a particular box and\n\n348\n00:17:08.885 --> 00:17:10.345\nget a chance to see how that works out.\n\n349\n00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:12.935\nSo stay tuned for that,\nyou'll definitely want to watch it.\n\n350\n00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:15.975\n>> Alright, well thank you again Don,\nfor showing us that other example.\n\n351\n00:17:15.975 --> 00:17:20.560\nAnd for showing us how to get faster at\nworking at what we need to, for the exam.\n\n352\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.760\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been Ronnie Wong.\n\n353\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.660\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n354\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.101\n>> And I'll see you next time.\n\n355\n00:17:26.101 -->

00:00:18.854\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look at PMP,\n\n4\n00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:20.904\nthe Project Management Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:24.402\nWe're specifically going to be taking\na look at the critical path method,\n\n6\n00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:27.305\nmaking sure that we understand\nit as we get ready for our exam.\n\n7\n00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:29.230\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.360\nDon, how's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.450\n>> It is going great, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.060\nReady to jump right back into CPM.\n\n11\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.330\nAnd if you've been watching,\nin the first two examples, we did a really\n\n12\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.960\nthorough job of running through a full\nproject schedule network diagram.\n\n13\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.360\nCalculating out our early starts,\nour early finishes and\n\n14\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.460\nall that other good stuff,\nfiguring out our float.\n\n15\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.410\nAnd that's all fine and good, right?\n\n16\n00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.640\nBut on the exam, they're not really gonna\nhave you calculate out a full diagram\n\n17\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640\nlike we've been doing.\n\n18\n00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.945\nSo in this episode, what I wanna do\nis make it a little more exam like.\n\n19\n00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:57.255\nWhere you focus in on\na particular task and\n\n20\n00:00:57.255 --> 00:01:00.365\nhave to calculate out some\nkind of information from it.\n\n21\n00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.088\nAnd that's much more realistic\nto what you'll see on the exam.\n\n22\n00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:05.808\nSo we're gonna run through\na couple of quick examples here.\n\n23\n00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:10.720\nWe'll actually do three of them just to\nget a feel for what it's like on the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.250\nAll right, so let's start just by\nkind of refreshing our memory.\n\n25\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.078\nSo I've got my original\ntemplate kind of fired up here.\n\n26\n00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:20.830\nRemember when you see a task what you've\ngot is your early start, early finish,\n\n27\n00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.430\nlate start, late finish.\n\n28\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.100\nIt's important you memorize\nthe position of those numbers\n\n29\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.250\nbecause see how I keep labeling them?\n\n30\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.395\nOn the exam, they won't be labeled.\n\n31\n00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:28.902\nRight?\n\n32\n00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:31.112\nSo on the exam,\nwhen you jump into a problem,\n\n33\n00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:33.475\nwhat you're gonna see\nis something like this.\n\n34\n00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:35.980\nRight?\nAnd we've got a bunch of numbers.\n\n35\n00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.487\nAnd I don't know, are the early ones\non the bottom or the early ones on top?\n\n36\n00:01:39.487 --> 00:01:42.276\nIs this early start, early finish,\nlate start, late finish?\n\n37\n00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:42.844\nI don't remember.\n\n38\n00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:46.760\nYou gotta remember the positioning\nin the squares of where these are.\n\n39\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.780\nYou've got your early\nstart at the top left,\n\n40\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.270\nand your early finish at the top right.\n\n41\n00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.651\nYour late start in the bottom left, and\nyour late finish at the bottom right.\n\n42\n00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:58.139\nIf you don't remember the positioning,\nthese problems become really challenging.\n\n43\n00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.824\nAll right?\n\n44\n00:01:58.824 --> 00:02:04.233\nAnd then, she how I've got C right here\nas the only one that's completely blank.\n\n45\n00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:06.498\nWell I the exam,\nit may not be completely blank.\n\n46\n00:02:06.498 --> 00:02:09.473\nThey may have letters in her like A,\nB, C, D.\n\n47\n00:02:09.473 --> 00:02:13.285\nAnd then, they say which of the following\nis the appropriate value for A?\n\n48\n00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:14.777\nAnd now you've got to come up here and\nsay, all right.\n\n49\n00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:18.080\nWell this block is labeled A, what\nshould be the appropriate number there?\n\n50\n00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.440\nWell I need to go and figure that out.\n\n51\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.220\nAll right?\n\n52\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.240\nOr what is the float for Activity C?\n\n53\n00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.275\nAnd I've got to calculate that out, right?\n\n54\n00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:30.715\nAnd you'll have a multiple choice\nanswer in that it might have A is five,\n\n55\n00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:32.954\nB is two, C is one, D is zero.\n\n56\n00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:34.248\nAnd now I've gotta figure this out so\n\n57\n00:02:34.248 --> 00:02:36.480\nI can match it up to the letter\nto answer the question.\n\n58\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.090\nSo that's really what you're gonna get,\nis they might show a topology or\n\n59\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.382\na project shared network\ndiagram like this.\n\n60\n00:02:43.382 --> 00:02:44.614\nIt might even be far more complex.\n\n61\n00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:45.609\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n62\n00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.993\nyou're really just dialed into\none of those little boxes.\n\n63\n00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:52.082\nAnd you might even see the same topology\ncome up more than once on the exam.\n\n64\n00:02:52.082 --> 00:02:55.900\nThey might say what value,\nwhat's the early start of task C?\n\n65\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.038\nThen a few questions later you might\nsee what's the late finish of task C?\n\n66\n00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:04.848\nSame topology, same task,\nwe're just figuring out a different value.\n\n67\n00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:07.700\nRemember, don't calculate\nanymore than you have to.\n\n68\n00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.240\nCalculate the bare minimum you\nneed to answer the question.\n\n69\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.350\nDon't go crazy.\n\n70\n00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.170\nBut once you get proficient at it,\n\n71\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.180\nyou'll find that you can fill\nall this stuff out really fast.\n\n72\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.320\nFor this one for example, if I wanna\nfigure out its late start, early start,\n\n73\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.170\nand all that.\n\n74\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.720\nI really just need to focus in on\nthree other tasks, B, G, and D,\n\n75\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.130\nthe ones we have shared dependencies with.\n\n76\n00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.121\nAnd then we can fill this out really fast.\n\n77\n00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:34.214\nSo starting off with the earlies,\nearly start and early finish.\n\n78\n00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.404\nBecause activity B is\ngonna finish on the 8th,\n\n79\n00:03:37.404 --> 00:03:40.851\nthe earliest we can start\nis going to be on the 9th.\n\n80\n00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:44.660\nSo we'll make this one a 9,\nwe'll just plug that right in there.\n\n81\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.040\nAnd if it's a three day duration,\nwell we need the 9th, 10th, and 11th.\n\n82\n00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.920\nAnd so that'll finish on the 11th.\n\n83\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.230\nSo now, I've got my early start and\nmy early finish.\n\n84\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.150\nNow for figuring out my late finish,\n\n85\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.810\nI need to look at the other\ntasks I have dependencies with.\n\n86\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.047\nTask D over here has a late start of 16.\n\n87\n00:04:02.047 --> 00:04:06.200\nSo based on that, I know my late\nfinish would need be to be 15.\n\n88\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.920\nBut I need to look up here and\nsee this one and\n\n89\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.349\nsee how it's got a late start of 12?\n\n90\n00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.254\nThat's gonna impact me.\n\n91\n00:04:12.254 --> 00:04:15.520\nThat means my late finish needs to be 11.\n\n92\n00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.910\nIn order to meet that.\n\n93\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.290\nSo I'll punch that in for my late finish,\nand there's a three day duration.\n\n94\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.970\nSo my late start will be a 9.\n\n95\n00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.931\nAnd then I can just figure\nout my float by 9 minus 9, or\n\n96\n00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:30.680\n11 minus 11 and coming up with 0.\n\n97\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.210\nSo now if they ask me what my float was,\nif they ask me what my late start was, or\n\n98\n00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.000\nmy early finish was,\nI just calculated that out.\n\n99\n00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.290\nBut I calculated out probably more\nthan what I necessarily needed to.\n\n100\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.748\nIf they just wanna know what my\nearliest start was, well, 8 plus 1.\n\n101\n00:04:45.748 --> 00:04:46.600\n9, done.\n\n102\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.380\nRight?\nNo point in\n\n103\n00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.290\ncalculating the other boxes, right?\n\n104\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.102\nOr if they wanted me to know what my\nlate finish was, I'd calculate that out.\n\n105\n00:04:53.102 --> 00:04:56.379\nAnd even though it's super easy\nto subtract the duration and\n\n106\n00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.023\nget the late start,\nI wouldn't bother with it.\n\n107\n00:04:59.023 --> 00:05:01.630\nWhy waste the brain cycles on that one.\n\n108\n00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.490\nMove on to the next question.\n\n109\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.430\nOr calculating out float, right?\n\n110\n00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.020\nIf I'm calculating out float,\n\n111\n00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.680\nI need to subtract my late\nfinish from my late start.\n\n112\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.293\nI don't necessarily need to\ncalculate that early finish.\n\n113\n00:05:12.293 --> 00:05:15.154\nRight, I can leave that off,\nand figure that out and\n\n114\n00:05:15.154 --> 00:05:16.987\nget the float value right there.\n\n115\n00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:19.990\nNow the only other thing I haven't looked\nat is whether or not I have free float.\n\n116\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.360\nI know that I don't have a gap right here.\n\n117\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.450\nSo I don't even have to look at the other\ndependencies since there's no gap here,\n\n118\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.310\nI don't have free float.\n\n119\n00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.730\nNo, actually I have zero float anyway.\n\n120\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.533\nSo now I'm really wasting time.\n\n121\n00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:32.553\nIf you have zero float,\nwho cares if it's free or not.\n\n122\n00:05:32.553 --> 00:05:36.406\nSo in this case, that's pretty much it.\n\n123\n00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:38.057\nAnd that really wasn't that hard, was it?\n\n124\n00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:39.335\nAnd we answered it pretty quickly.\n\n125\n00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:42.000\nSo you guys see how that\ncan be an exam question.\n\n126\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.190\nI'll take a slightly different typology\nhere, and just block out a different one.\n\n127\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.400\nNow this is the same typology,\nbut different time.\n\n128\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.220\nSo different dates or\ndurations assigned to it.\n\n129\n00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.530\nAnd if we wanna go in and calculate it,\nit's that same basic process.\n\n130\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.290\nThis one's actually easier.\n\n131\n00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.498\nBecause I don't have the multiple\ndependencies like I did on task C.\n\n132\n00:06:00.498 --> 00:06:03.957\nTask D really just has C\nas the predecessor and\n\n133\n00:06:03.957 --> 00:06:07.700\nI as the dependency, and\nso that's it, right?\n\n134\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.760\nWe just have this very simple model here.\n\n135\n00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.000\nSo figuring out this one doesn't even\nrequire a whole like of a lot of effort.\n\n136\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.690\nWe can just come in and\nkinda dial it in based on what we see.\n\n137\n00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.780\nIf task C finished on the 11th, that means\nthat this one can start on the 12th.\n\n138\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.190\nAnd it's an eight day duration,\nso it's gonna finish on the 19th.\n\n139\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.730\nAnd now I've got my early start and\nmy early finish, right?\n\n140\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.970\nI've got the 12, that's why you're adding\none to task C's finish time, right?\n\n141\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.800\nAnd I've got the 19 by adding eight days.\n\n142\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.960\nWell, we have to count to 12, right?\n\n143\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.943\nSo 12 plus 8 minus 1 gives me that 19,\nright?\n\n144\n00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:45.686\nAnd then I see this nice big gap\nbetween the 19th and the 24th, so\n\n145\n00:06:45.686 --> 00:06:47.010\nI know I've got float.\n\n146\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.370\nAnd I know I'm gonna\nhave to figure that out.\n\n147\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.919\nAnd I also know it's free float.\n\n148\n00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:51.161\nI know it's got free float.\n\n149\n00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:54.173\nAnd if that's all they're asking me for,\ndoes it have free float?\n\n150\n00:06:54.173 --> 00:06:56.774\nTrue or false, Task G has free float.\n\n151\n00:06:56.774 --> 00:07:00.106\nWell, I can tell that right now and\nI don't even know what the float is.\n\n152\n00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:01.849\nI just know that it exists, right?\n\n153\n00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:04.430\nI know that it exists\nbecause I see that gap.\n\n154\n00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.990\nThen as far as the way back,\nI can look at that late start of a 24.\n\n155\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.965\nSo my late start would be 23,\nthe day before.\n\n156\n00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:15.322\nThen if I'm gonna finish on\nthe 23rd of the month and\n\n157\n00:07:15.322 --> 00:07:19.359\nI've got an eight day activity,\nthen I need to do 23 minus 8.\n\n158\n00:07:19.359 --> 00:07:22.321\nWhich is 15, and I need to add 1 to that.\n\n159\n00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:24.979\nSo it'll be 16, if I recall correctly.\n\n160\n00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:25.779\nAnd there we go.\n\n161\n00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.795\nSo now I've got my late start.\n\n162\n00:07:29.795 --> 00:07:33.715\nAnd once I've got that, I can calculate\nup my float, which 16 minus 12 is 4.\n\n163\n00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:35.497\n23 minus 19 is 4.\n\n164\n00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.352\nHad I calculated that duration wrong,\nI'd see the variation right there.\n\n165\n00:07:38.352 --> 00:07:39.769\nRonnie mentioned that in the last episode.\n\n166\n00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:41.970\nLike that's a great way to\nspot if you screw that up.\n\n167\n00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.150\n[LAUGH] Which I do from time to time.\n\n168\n00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.995\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n169\n00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:48.515\nI can see that I've got\nthis four days of float.\n\n170\n00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:54.100\nAnd I know it's free float because\nof the gap in between these guys.\n\n171\n00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.398\nRight?\n19 and 24.\n\n172\n00:07:55.398 --> 00:07:56.941\n24 minus 19.\n\n173\n00:07:56.941 --> 00:08:00.600\nThat's gonna get me a nice gap\nthere to get that free flow.\n\n174\n00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.020\nSo now I've calculated those values.\n\n175\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.700\nAnd so you see where we can\nanswer true/false questions,\n\n176\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.510\nmultiple choice questions, and so on.\n\n177\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.190\nWe just get right to the data and\nget an answer.\n\n178\n00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.229\nAll right.\nLet's do one more example.\n\n179\n00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.620\nHere's another one.\n\n180\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.623\nWhen we did Task C,\nit had two dependencies on the way out.\n\n181\n00:08:17.623 --> 00:08:21.990\nTask G has two predecessors on the way in.\n\n182\n00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.350\nSo this is gonna effect our earlies,\nnot so much out lates.\n\n183\n00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.450\nAnd so when I go to figure out my early,\n\n184\n00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.910\nthis is where people in a hurry\nstart to make mistakes.\n\n185\n00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.863\nPeople who don't really know what\nthey're doing make a mistake.\n\n186\n00:08:31.863 --> 00:08:35.840\nBecause the early start, I might base\nit right off of the seven, right?\n\n187\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.600\nIf task F finishes on the seventh, task G\ncould start on the eighth, couldn't it?\n\n188\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.550\nSo we just pop in an eight and we're done.\n\n189\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.570\nWell, I don't necessarily know that cuz I\nhaven't looked at this task down here and\n\n190\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.340\nthe earliest this task can\nfinish is on the 11th.\n\n191\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.640\nSo I need to come back up here and\nchange that 8 to a 12, right?\n\n192\n00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.721\nIf task C doesn't finish until the 11th,\n\n193\n00:08:55.721 --> 00:08:59.440\ntask G can't start until the 12th\neven though this guy is done, right?\n\n194\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.560\nAnd my warning flag should have\nbeen the float but on the exam,\n\n195\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.350\nthey might not have the float filled in.\n\n196\n00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.300\nAnd so if I don't see that float, then\nI don't necessarily know that I need to\n\n197\n00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.300\npay attention to\nthe predecessor's very activity.\n\n198\n00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.520\nAnd then 12, the twelfth of the month\nis the earliest I can start it.\n\n199\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.630\nIf it's a three-day task,\n\n200\n00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.740\nit'll finish on the 14th, and\nthat leads to the 15th, right?\n\n201\n00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.690\nSo, I know that makes sense.\n\n202\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.240\nAnd then as far as the lates,\n\n203\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.580\nthe lates are easier cuz I\nonly have one predecessor.\n\n204\n00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.034\nWell, it's a reverse predecessor,\nso it's a dependency.\n\n205\n00:09:31.034 --> 00:09:36.544\n[LAUGH] So anyhow, the 15th here\nis when this one, its late start.\n\n206\n00:09:36.544 --> 00:09:39.483\nSo that means the latest this\none can finish is the 14th.\n\n207\n00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:41.157\nAnd if it's a three-day duration,\n\n208\n00:09:41.157 --> 00:09:44.320\nthat's gonna drop it with\na late start of the 12th.\n\n209\n00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.980\nAnd I can see I'm kind of on the critical\npath here, so my float is gonna be 0.\n\n210\n00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.240\nAnd no need to calculate whether or\nnot it's free float.\n\n211\n00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.120\nJust pay attention to those dependencies\nand you can calculate it right out,\n\n212\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.430\nget it mapped out, and\nanswer any of the questions.\n\n213\n00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.324\nIf they're asking early start,\nlate start, early finish, late finish.\n\n214\n00:10:00.324 --> 00:10:03.070\nIf they're asking for\nthe float, the free float.\n\n215\n00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.700\nIf they're asking for\n\n216\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.680\nany of that information,\nyou can get it all right there.\n\n217\n00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.740\nAnd it just takes a matter of seconds,\nnot a big deal to calculate out.\n\n218\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.920\nDon has a lot of great examples for\nus, but\n\n219\n00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.046\nit seemed like the key here is practice.\n\n220\n00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:18.255\nMore than anything else is to sit down and\nactually work through multiples of these\n\n221\n00:10:18.255 --> 00:10:22.760\nuntil you feel very confident when you\nlook at this that you can determine that.\n\n222\n00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.710\nAnd don't just do the simple ones, right?\n\n223\n00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.370\nMake sure you actually add some in\nthat do have multiple predecessors or\n\n224\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.640\ndo have multiple dependencies.\n\n225\n00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.701\nI'm gonna get that wrong, too.\n\n226\n00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:32.259\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n227\n00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:35.050\n>> To make sure that we\ncan actually do this.\n\n228\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.710\nAnd make sure you take advantage and\n\n229\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.190\nunderstand that the time that you have\nright before you go into the exam.\n\n230\n00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.091\nDon't worry about calculating\nout the whole thing.\n\n231\n00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:43.878\nTake advantage of saying, hey look.\n\n232\n00:10:43.878 --> 00:10:48.830\nThey're only asking me about\ndetermining the late start.\n\n233\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.545\nDon't have to go through and\ndo everything else that's actually there,\n\n234\n00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:52.522\njust determine that one.\n\n235\n00:10:52.522 --> 00:10:54.401\nMake sure you take a look at the question.\n\n236\n00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:57.511\nOnly answer what you actually\nhave been asked as well.\n\n237\n00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:01.291\nDon, in the other kind of key\nthings right before the exam.\n\n238\n00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:04.671\nIf you were saying, I'm gonna take\nthe exam tomorrow on critical path that,\n\n239\n00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:06.340\nI need to make sure that I understand.\n\n240\n00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.890\n>> I would just say practice, so\nyou know you can calculate this out.\n\n241\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.250\nAnd if you're doing this on your own,\n\n242\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.770\njust start making up your topology, your\nown project schedule network diagrams.\n\n243\n00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.180\nAnd I encourage you to use\nsoftware like Microsoft Project,\n\n244\n00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.520\nwhich can tell you exactly\nwhat those dates are.\n\n245\n00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.860\nIt calculates out late start,\nearly start, late finish, early finish.\n\n246\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.540\nIt calculates a float and free float even.\n\n247\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.010\nExcept in Project, they call it slack and\nthey don't call it free slack.\n\n248\n00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.411\nThey call it something else.\n\n249\n00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:32.014\nNo actually,\nI think it is called free slack.\n\n250\n00:11:32.014 --> 00:11:32.804\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, I think it's called free slack.\n\n251\n00:11:32.804 --> 00:11:34.313\n>> So slack and free slack.\n\n252\n00:11:34.313 --> 00:11:36.810\nBut it's float in PMI's world.\n\n253\n00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.050\nSo you can get it to calculate it.\n\n254\n00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.300\nAnd that way you know it's right and\nyou can practice.\n\n255\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.170\nSo you've almost got like somebody\ngrading you, which is nice.\n\n256\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.510\nI'll do it all the time where\nI'll take a project, and\n\n257\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.550\nyou just put it in Microsoft Project,\nadd the activities, link them, and\n\n258\n00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.860\nthrow durations on each of the days.\n\n259\n00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.320\nAnd then that's it.\nStop right there, and\n\n260\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.941\nthen map it out myself,\ncalculate all of the values.\n\n261\n00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:57.749\nAnd then you can go into the diagram\nin Project and get it to show all that.\n\n262\n00:11:57.749 --> 00:11:59.980\nSo definitely a neat tool to use.\n\n263\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.030\nTake advantage of what's out there.\n\n264\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.980\n>> And don't forget to also make\nsure you memorize that template and\n\n265\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.270\nwhere those numbers actually go.\n\n266\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.990\nWhen you're given the early or late start,\nearly finish or late finish as well.\n\n267\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.390\nThat's gonna help you out tremendously.\n\n268\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.070\nNone of those diagrams are labeled for\nyou, and yet\n\n269\n00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.810\nyou still have to calculate\nthis stuff out as well.\n\n270\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:19.320\nOkay.\n\n271\n00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.251\nSo that's a great place for\nus to go ahead and end this episode.\n\n272\n00:12:22.251 --> 00:12:24.906\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n273\n00:12:24.906 --> 00:12:25.788\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n274\n00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:28.190\n>> And we'll see you next

They begin with establishing the importance of the PV, Planned Value.  Don shows the basic formulas and then sets it it the context of questions.  The guys demonstrate how to take the given information to determine the EV of a given scenario.  Working through the scenarios, they show us how the Earned Value represent the value at a specific point in time helping us see where were should be at any given time in our project vs where we are.",

00:00:16.990\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.370\nAnd today we're gonna be taking a look\nat Project Management Professional, PNP.\n\n5\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.911\nAnd we're actually gonna get in to that\nweird realm of actually formulas a little\n\n6\n00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:30.534\nbit and learning how to do earn value, and\ndo better help us down Mister Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:31.416\nHow is it going Don?\n\n8\n00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:32.576\n>> It is going great Ronnie,\n\n9\n00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:36.374\nready to jump right back into our formulas\nin action series, we're gonna get a chance\n\n10\n00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:39.125\nto see some of these\n>> Some of these formulas actually get\n\n11\n00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:40.930\nused, which is really nice.\n\n12\n00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.560\nSometimes, we memorize the formulas,\nwe learn about them, but\n\n13\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.660\nit you don't actually use them, it's hard\nto really grasp exactly what they do.\n\n14\n00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.140\nSo we're going back and\nrevisiting each of these formulas and\n\n15\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.520\ngetting a chance to kinda see them and\nsee how they might turn up on the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.270\nSo in this episode,\nwe're gonna kick off earned value, and\n\n17\n00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.490\nif you've watched our other series,\nyou know that Earned Value Management\n\n18\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.250\nis kind of a big deal,\nit's really a lot of stuff to understand.\n\n19\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.510\nBut at the end of the day,\nit boils down to a very simple formula for\n\n20\n00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.705\ncalculating out your Earned Value,\nand so we wanna take a look at that.\n\n21\n00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:15.759\nBut there is one thing that was always\nbothered me about Project Minister\n\n22\n00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.878\ntextbook that were out there that\nthe books that I was study from the course\n\n23\n00:01:19.878 --> 00:01:24.624\nthat I took 10 years ago, 11 years ago\ncompared to the courses available today.\n\n24\n00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:26.359\nThey are really all the same and\n\n25\n00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.110\nthey can have neglect one little thing\nwhich is called Planned Value, right?\n\n26\n00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.700\nPlanned Value is really important.\n\n27\n00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.450\nIf you're gonna do anything\nwith earned value,\n\n28\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.900\nyou've gotta have your\nplanned value first, right?\n\n29\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.189\nNow, remember the difference\nbetween these.\n\n30\n00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.870\nEarned value, not even thinking formulas,\njust conceptually, right?\n\n31\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.040\nEarned value is, in your project, you've\ndone a certain amount of work, right,\n\n32\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.880\na certain amount of things have happened,\nif we're in the executing phase, right?\n\n33\n00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.230\nActions have gone on, stuff has happened,\nand as that work is done,\n\n34\n00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.141\nit creates a value and\nyour earning value is that work is done.\n\n35\n00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:00.420\nIf the work's not getting done,\nyou're not earning value.\n\n36\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.730\nIf work's getting done too fast,\nyou're earning too much value, right?\n\n37\n00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.478\nSo earned value is a great way to just\nmeasure the performance of your project.\n\n38\n00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:11.217\nThe planned value is kinda the same thing\nexcept you're not in the execution phase.\n\n39\n00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:12.413\nYou're in the planning phase.\n\n40\n00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:17.392\nAnd you're saying, hey, on this date, I\nplan things to be valued at this amount or\n\n41\n00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:21.740\nat this other date, I plan on being\nvalued at a different amount.\n\n42\n00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.020\nAnd so, we need to understand\nhow to get that planned value so\n\n43\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.220\nwe can then measure the earned\nvalue against it, and\n\n44\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.100\nit is value so it's easy just think money,\nbut it also has to kind be kind of\n\n45\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.500\nfactored into the work complete and that\nmeans that this is an aggregate metric.\n\n46\n00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.130\nIt's a metric that combines,\nor a composite metric.\n\n47\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.070\nThis combining two different elements.\n\n48\n00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.298\nIt's combining the money you spent,\nwith the percentage of work complete.\n\n49\n00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:51.959\nAnd so earned value and planned value,\nwhile a lot of time is represented in\n\n50\n00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.050\ndollar signs, it's not truly\ndollars we're talking about.\n\n51\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.590\nIt's like [LAUGH] what they say\nabout those YouTube people.\n\n52\n00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.606\nThey make internet money,\nit's not real money.\n\n53\n00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:03.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They might have a million views, but\n\n54\n00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.960\nthat haven't really seen any real money.\n\n55\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.080\nThat's kinda how earned value is.\n\n56\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.220\nIt's not real money.\n\n57\n00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.720\nThere is real money behind the scenes.\n\n58\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.623\nBut earned value itself is more of just\na placeholder number that let's us gauge\n\n59\n00:03:12.623 --> 00:03:13.620\nthat performance.\n\n60\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.070\nAll right, so\nlet's start with planned value.\n\n61\n00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.200\nAnd I've got my planned value kind\nof up here on my chart on my screen.\n\n62\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.500\nAnd when you calculate out planned value,\nit's a pretty straightforward formula.\n\n63\n00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.780\nWhat you do is you take\nyour budget at completion.\n\n64\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.360\nAnd this could be your budget at\ncompletion for the entire project.\n\n65\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.580\nOr it could be just for\nan individual activity, right?\n\n66\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.490\nRemember, when it comes to earned value,\n\n67\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.650\nyou can be looking at\nyour project as a whole.\n\n68\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.750\nBut if your project has numerous\nactivities going on at the same time.\n\n69\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.074\nLooking at the project as a whole is\nnot necessarily beneficial, right?\n\n70\n00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:50.550\nThat's something a PMO might do.\n\n71\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.481\nSo if you've got a project management\noffice, they might just say we got\n\n72\n00:03:54.481 --> 00:03:58.864\na portfolio of 20 projects, let's just\nget a high level view of what our earned\n\n73\n00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:03.327\nvalues are across all 20 projects so we\ncan identify which projects are at risk.\n\n74\n00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:07.369\nA PMO or a CEO,\nsomebody high up in the organization.\n\n75\n00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:12.319\nThey want that big picture, and so they\nmight be looking for a planned value and\n\n76\n00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.696\nan earned value calculated\non the project as a whole.\n\n77\n00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:19.907\nAnd if that's what you're doing your\nbudgeted completion that's your total\n\n78\n00:04:19.907 --> 00:04:21.400\nproject budget right.\n\n79\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.290\nThe whole shebang the entire project\nwhat's your budget what you're dollar\n\n80\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.950\nsign, and\nthen you multiply that by the plan work.\n\n81\n00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.467\nNow what do we mean by plan work?\n\n82\n00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:35.816\nWell, let's say it's a five year project,\nand we're at the two year mark.\n\n83\n00:04:35.816 --> 00:04:37.626\nAnd according to our plan,\n\n84\n00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:41.726\nwe should be 30% done with our\nproject at the two year mark.\n\n85\n00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:43.800\nAnd now we're at that two year mark.\n\n86\n00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.520\nSo I would take my budget of completion\nand I would multiply it by 20%.\n\n87\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.978\nI should be 20% done, so I multiply by\n20% and that's my planned value, right?\n\n88\n00:04:50.978 --> 00:04:53.003\nThe number that I get there, and\n\n89\n00:04:53.003 --> 00:04:57.120\nthen I can turn around a look\nat what's actually going on.\n\n90\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.781\nI can look at the earned value, which is\nwhere we take the planned value that we\n\n91\n00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:06.890\njust came up with, and we multiply it by\nthe percentage that's actually complete.\n\n92\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.594\nWe multiplied it by percent, 20% earlier\nbecause that's what we planned to be\n\n93\n00:05:10.594 --> 00:05:14.568\ncompleted, but here, maybe we're only\neighteen percent complete, or we're thirty\n\n94\n00:05:14.568 --> 00:05:18.512\npercent complete, or whatever, we multiply\nthat out and now we get out earned value.\n\n95\n00:05:18.512 --> 00:05:23.598\nAnd when we compare the earn value to\nthe plan value, we can determine whether\n\n96\n00:05:23.598 --> 00:05:28.152\nwe're ahead of schedule,\nbehind schedule, or right on schedule.\n\n97\n00:05:28.152 --> 00:05:31.662\nAnd, I say schedule,\nit also factors in budget too, right, so\n\n98\n00:05:31.662 --> 00:05:35.350\nit's not just schedule,\nit's really all rolled together.\n\n99\n00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.890\nSo it's really just kind of a red light,\nyellow light,\n\n100\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.560\ngreen light type scenario with a project\nto know whether or not it's at risk.\n\n101\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.380\nAnd remember for\nthe exam that being ahead of schedule or\n\n102\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.880\nbeing under budget are not\nnecessarily a good thing.\n\n103\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.820\nIf you're ahead of schedule,\n\n104\n00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.600\nit could mean that work's not getting\ndone that is being reported as done.\n\n105\n00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.710\nOr if you are under budget,\n\n106\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.640\nit could mean that money should\nhave been spent that wasn't.\n\n107\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.370\nAnd so\ncertain work might not be getting done or\n\n108\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.540\ncertain items might not\nbe getting purchased.\n\n109\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.270\nYou might be deviating from your plan.\n\n110\n00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.371\nSo those are as big a red light as being\nbehind schedule or being over budget.\n\n111\n00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:11.590\nSo we always have to\nremember that on the exam.\n\n112\n00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.240\nThat the only good number\nis when these equal out.\n\n113\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.500\nWhen your earn value equals your plan\nvalue, and then everything's nice and\n\n114\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.900\nworks out great and\nyou end up where things are running well.\n\n115\n00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.380\n>> So Don what I hear you also saying\nis that we need to keep in mind those\n\n116\n00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.320\nproject constraints, making sure that we\nunderstand that we're talking about not\n\n117\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.800\nonly the idea of cost but the resources or\ndeliverables that we might have on hand,\n\n118\n00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.560\nas well as the time constraints too,\nthat we wanna make sure that that's all\n\n119\n00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.160\nbalanced and this is what really\nhelps us to show that we're on track.\n\n120\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.790\n>> That's it.\n\n121\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.570\nAnd I mentioned it like from a PMO\nperspective, from the whole company, but\n\n122\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.800\nif you're a project manager,\n\n123\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.480\nyou might just be looking\nat one particular activity.\n\n124\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.490\nI might have an activity\nthat is only two weeks long.\n\n125\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.260\nIt is a two week activity,\nit is ten days, and I am on day four.\n\n126\n00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.430\nOkay, well how is it looking so far?\n\n127\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.510\nAm I going to finish on day ten?\n\n128\n00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.180\nI am not sure yet.\n\n129\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.020\nWe can use earned value and\nplanned value to figure that out, right?\n\n130\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.980\nSo this does not have to\nbe the project as a whole.\n\n131\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.210\nAs the project manager you will\nnormally do this based on an activity.\n\n132\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.568\nAs a PMO, as a CEO, somebody like that,\nyou'll do it on the project as a whole.\n\n133\n00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:17.400\nBut at the end of the day,\nthe formula's really the same.\n\n134\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.090\nThat budget at completion (BAC)\ntimes the Planned Work will give you\n\n135\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.790\nthe Planned Value (PV) for\nwhatever you're managing.\n\n136\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.530\nAnd it's the Planned Work\nas of that point in time.\n\n137\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.900\nEarned value is all about a point in time.\n\n138\n00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.870\nWe're gonna talk in another\nepisode about forecasting.\n\n139\n00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.230\nAnd how you can start\npredicting the future.\n\n140\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.670\nAnd that's when you start moving\naway from a point in time.\n\n141\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.080\nAnd those formulas are really easy to\nspot, cuz they'll always have a lower,\n\n142\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.620\na little, what's it called when\nthe letter that's beneath the letter?\n\n143\n00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.690\nIt's not a super-\n>> A subscript.\n\n144\n00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.722\n>> A subscript.\nThey'll have a little subscript c on\n\n145\n00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:51.016\nthem that let's you know\nit's a cumulative value.\n\n146\n00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:54.848\nSo you've got these cumulative that'll\nbe measuring multiple plan values or\n\n147\n00:07:54.848 --> 00:07:56.131\nmultiple earned values.\n\n148\n00:07:56.131 --> 00:07:59.450\nAnd you can use those to trend and\npredict the future right?\n\n149\n00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.472\nThat's different.\n\n150\n00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:01.448\nWith earn value and\n\n151\n00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:05.295\nplan value by default you're really\njust looking at single point in time.\n\n152\n00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:06.535\nAnd you pick that time.\n\n153\n00:08:06.535 --> 00:08:07.815\nAnd the time is normally now.\n\n154\n00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:10.801\nWe normally say as of right now,\nwhat do I have?\n\n155\n00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:14.306\nBut you might be looking at something\nin the past and saying you know,\n\n156\n00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:16.428\nwhere were we at at\nthis point in the past?\n\n157\n00:08:16.428 --> 00:08:20.898\nAnd the scenario there might be,\nI think my project is falling behind.\n\n158\n00:08:20.898 --> 00:08:23.763\nYou know, things aren't quite\nworking out the way that I think.\n\n159\n00:08:23.763 --> 00:08:27.034\nWe have another project that was done\nin the company that followed the same\n\n160\n00:08:27.034 --> 00:08:29.209\npattern, right that did\nthe same type of thing.\n\n161\n00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:30.386\nYou see this in construction a lot.\n\n162\n00:08:30.386 --> 00:08:31.423\nI'm building a house.\n\n163\n00:08:31.423 --> 00:08:32.926\nI'm not the first person to build a house.\n\n164\n00:08:32.926 --> 00:08:34.795\nSomebody else built a similar house.\n\n165\n00:08:34.795 --> 00:08:38.904\nLet me go look at their project and look\nat their calendar and go back in the past\n\n166\n00:08:38.904 --> 00:08:42.841\nand say, on this day what was their\nearned value and compare that to mine.\n\n167\n00:08:42.841 --> 00:08:46.118\nAnd where mine starts to look behind and I\nlook at theirs and theirs look behind too.\n\n168\n00:08:46.118 --> 00:08:48.916\nIt turns out we just didn't have\nan even distribution at work.\n\n169\n00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:53.187\nThat happens a lot where you might\nhave a four day activity, and\n\n170\n00:08:53.187 --> 00:08:58.282\nit might be 25% of the work getting\ndone each day, 100% of the work.\n\n171\n00:08:58.282 --> 00:09:02.731\nOr you might have front loaded or\nback loaded work.\n\n172\n00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:04.764\nYou see this especially where\nthere's a lot of materials.\n\n173\n00:09:04.764 --> 00:09:08.130\nSo on day one you've got to\nspend $10,000 on material,\n\n174\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.525\nbut on day two, three and four you're\njust spending $1,000 a day on labor.\n\n175\n00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:15.531\nSo, the bulk of your cost\nis right there on day one.\n\n176\n00:09:15.531 --> 00:09:16.323\nIt’s frontloaded or\n\n177\n00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:19.452\nyou can have it backloaded too where it's\npayment on delivery, that kind of thing.\n\n178\n00:09:19.452 --> 00:09:22.821\nAnd those can really skew these numbers\nand so that's why it's important to be\n\n179\n00:09:22.821 --> 00:09:25.693\nable compare with other projects and\nstart looking into the past.\n\n180\n00:09:25.693 --> 00:09:31.116\nSo, planned value and earned value,\nall about a particular point in time.\n\n181\n00:09:31.116 --> 00:09:32.823\nSo, what are we gonna see\nin the exam with this?\n\n182\n00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:37.111\nWell, you'll see questions in a few\ndifferent formats and here's one example.\n\n183\n00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.263\nThey're giving me some information.\n\n184\n00:09:39.263 --> 00:09:43.958\nThey tell me that my project has a total\nbudget of 1.2 million dollars, right.\n\n185\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:44.952\nWe’ve got a pretty big projecthre.\n\n186\n00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:46.110\n1.2 million.\n\n187\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:52.388\nAnd on July 1st 2016 we\nare scheduled to be 30% complete.\n\n188\n00:09:52.388 --> 00:09:55.192\nSo we should be 30% complete on July 1st.\n\n189\n00:09:55.192 --> 00:09:58.037\nWhat is the planned value for July 1st?\n\n190\n00:09:58.037 --> 00:10:01.484\nNow, the first thing you might notice in\nthis question is that there's a lot of\n\n191\n00:10:01.484 --> 00:10:02.852\ndata that's missing, okay.\n\n192\n00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:05.919\nWhat is the duration of this project?\n\n193\n00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:09.029\nIs it one month, is it one year,\nis it five years?\n\n194\n00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:09.862\nI don't know.\n\n195\n00:10:09.862 --> 00:10:13.010\nAll right and what date that it start?\n\n196\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.270\nWhat date is the end?\n\n197\n00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.388\nI don't know that either.\n\n198\n00:10:15.388 --> 00:10:19.004\nAll I know is that on July 1st\nI'm supposed to be 30% complete.\n\n199\n00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:22.137\nAnd it's easy to panic when you get\nsomething like this cuz you look at it and\n\n200\n00:10:22.137 --> 00:10:23.900\nyou're like it's missing so much data.\n\n201\n00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.851\nSo much here that I don't have.\n\n202\n00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:30.585\nBut at the end of the day,\nplanned value doesn't need a whole lot.\n\n203\n00:10:30.585 --> 00:10:32.048\nIt needs our budget of completion.\n\n204\n00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.286\nWhat's the budget for my project?\n\n205\n00:10:33.286 --> 00:10:34.994\n$1.2 million right?\n\n206\n00:10:34.994 --> 00:10:36.924\nAnd, I need the planned work.\n\n207\n00:10:36.924 --> 00:10:41.089\nWell on July first my\nplanned work is 30% complete.\n\n208\n00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:45.619\nSo, I've got all the data I need to\ncalculate out the planned value.\n\n209\n00:10:45.619 --> 00:10:49.459\nNow once I have an answer,\nhow does it help me?\n\n210\n00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:52.466\nWell, it doesn't help all that much,\nbecause you need to put in context.\n\n211\n00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:56.201\nBut on the exam, it's not so\nmuch about putting it into context and\n\n212\n00:10:56.201 --> 00:10:57.545\nsolving that problem.\n\n213\n00:10:57.545 --> 00:11:01.567\nIt's about knowing what formula to use and\nhow to get the results, right?\n\n214\n00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:05.225\nIf you read this right here, and\nyou had no idea what the formula was for\n\n215\n00:11:05.225 --> 00:11:08.211\nplanned value,\nIt's really hard to extrapolate that.\n\n216\n00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:11.198\nIt'd be not impossible, but close.\n\n217\n00:11:11.198 --> 00:11:13.128\nBut if you know the formula,\nyou just look at it.\n\n218\n00:11:13.128 --> 00:11:15.342\nAnd you go, okay, well,\nhere's my budget at completion.\n\n219\n00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.501\nHere's my planned value.\n\n220\n00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:18.004\nLet's multiply those out, right?\n\n221\n00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:22.230\nSo what is $1.2 million times 30%?\n\n222\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.141\nAnd sadly,\nthe answer is that I don't know.\n\n223\n00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:26.365\nSo [LAUGH]-\n>> 360,000.\n\n224\n00:11:26.365 --> 00:11:27.228\n>> Thank you Ronnie.\n\n225\n00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:28.874\nSo Ronnie has already figured it out for\nme.\n\n226\n00:11:28.874 --> 00:11:33.224\nSo, if we do budget to completion or\n\n227\n00:11:33.224 --> 00:11:40.475\n$1,200,000 and\nwe multiply that by our 30%,\n\n228\n00:11:40.475 --> 00:11:45.268\nthen we end up with $360,000.\n\n229\n00:11:45.268 --> 00:11:51.140\nSo, $360,000 is our planned value and I\nshould've written this a little different.\n\n230\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.299\nI normally write it this way.\n\n231\n00:11:52.299 --> 00:11:58.921\nSo, PV = $1.2 million * 30% = $360,000.\n\n232\n00:11:58.921 --> 00:12:05.890\nSo as of July 1st, I should have achieved\nthe equivalent of $360,000 of value.\n\n233\n00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.635\nAnd that value is labor and\nother things that were budgeted and\n\n234\n00:12:09.635 --> 00:12:14.261\nassigned to it at that point, and\nI should be 30% complete at that stage.\n\n235\n00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:19.026\nAnd if I go and check my books and\nsee that I spent more than $360,000,\n\n236\n00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:21.791\nthen I should be more than 30% complete.\n\n237\n00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:24.165\nAnd if I see that I've\nspent less than $360,000,\n\n238\n00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:25.964\nthen I should be less than 30% complete.\n\n239\n00:12:25.964 --> 00:12:28.480\nSo I can start to use that as\na gauge of where we're at, and\n\n240\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.432\nthat's what we'll see with earned value.\n\n241\n00:12:30.432 --> 00:12:34.700\nBut on a planned value side,\nI now have a number, all right.\n\n242\n00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.389\nAnd, that number by itself is not\nterribly useful until I start\n\n243\n00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:38.921\ncomparing it with my earned value.\n\n244\n00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:43.789\nBut, what you can do, nobody does this,\nbut, you could take your project while\n\n245\n00:12:43.789 --> 00:12:47.942\nyou're in the planning phase, and\nyou could plan out, or you know,\n\n246\n00:12:47.942 --> 00:12:52.839\npredetermine your planned value for\nevery single day throughout your project.\n\n247\n00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:55.317\nWell imagine if you got\na five year project.\n\n248\n00:12:55.317 --> 00:12:57.429\nAnd so\nyou're talking about over 1,500 days,\n\n249\n00:12:57.429 --> 00:13:00.030\nover 1,500 planned values that\nyou have to calculate out.\n\n250\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.480\nAnd if you're doing it per activity,\n\n251\n00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.302\nyou could have many\nactivities on the same day.\n\n252\n00:13:03.302 --> 00:13:04.378\nIt becomes a nightmare.\n\n253\n00:13:04.378 --> 00:13:08.970\nBut if you're using Primavera or\nMicrosoft Project, or any of the other\n\n254\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.113\nvarious project management software\nsuites that are out there,\n\n255\n00:13:13.113 --> 00:13:15.613\nthey calculate this stuff no problem.\n\n256\n00:13:15.613 --> 00:13:18.516\nAnd so you can just look at it and\nsay all right what's my planned value and\n\n257\n00:13:18.516 --> 00:13:20.430\nwhat's my earned value and\nit tells you right?\n\n258\n00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.827\nBut on the exam, they want you\nto know how to do it by hand.\n\n259\n00:13:22.827 --> 00:13:24.776\nCalculating it out, not very hard, right?\n\n260\n00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:27.601\nBudget and\ncompletion times the planned work.\n\n261\n00:13:27.601 --> 00:13:30.344\nNow I did for the project as a whole here.\n\n262\n00:13:30.344 --> 00:13:34.549\nIf you take it for like an individual\nactivity It's not much different.\n\n263\n00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:38.119\nSo this question says, the contractors for\n\n264\n00:13:38.119 --> 00:13:45.073\nWork Breakdown Structure Task 3.1.1\nwon the contract with a $2,400 bid.\n\n265\n00:13:45.073 --> 00:13:47.817\nAll right, so that's the bid\nthey put in to do this work.\n\n266\n00:13:47.817 --> 00:13:51.897\nIt says they've indicated\nthe work will take six days and\n\n267\n00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:54.800\nwill be complete on July 7, 2016.\n\n268\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.240\nWhat is the planned value for July 4th\nassuming an even distribution of labor?\n\n269\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.697\nThis question,\nit's almost the opposite of the last one.\n\n270\n00:14:04.697 --> 00:14:07.466\nRemember the last one how I said it was so\ndevoid of information,\n\n271\n00:14:07.466 --> 00:14:10.210\nit only gave us the bare\nminimum of what we needed.\n\n272\n00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.354\nThis one is giving us too\nmuch information, and\n\n273\n00:14:13.354 --> 00:14:15.325\nyou will see this on the exam.\n\n274\n00:14:15.325 --> 00:14:16.360\nThey love to do this.\n\n275\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.555\nThey give you more\ninformation than you need.\n\n276\n00:14:18.555 --> 00:14:22.612\nAnd the reason is some people will\nmemorize formulas, and they don't even pay\n\n277\n00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:26.132\nattention to the question as much\nas just what values are provided.\n\n278\n00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:29.525\nAnd they know what formula to use because\nof the values that were provided.\n\n279\n00:14:29.525 --> 00:14:31.737\nSo by giving you too much information,\n\n280\n00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:34.828\nit's now up to you to pick\nout the pieces that you need.\n\n281\n00:14:34.828 --> 00:14:36.738\nAnd again,\nyou need to be familiar with that formula.\n\n282\n00:14:36.738 --> 00:14:39.360\nYou need to have the formula memorized so\nyou know what to grab.\n\n283\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.877\nSo this one's given me too\nmuch information, and yet\n\n284\n00:14:42.877 --> 00:14:46.551\nit hasn't given me some of\nthe information that I need,\n\n285\n00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:51.102\nlike what is my percentage complete\non a particular day here, okay?\n\n286\n00:14:51.102 --> 00:14:54.150\nThey didn't come right out and\ngive that to me.\n\n287\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.690\nThey gave it in a bit of a roundabout way,\nright?\n\n288\n00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.970\nNotice here where it says, they've\nindicated the work will take six days and\n\n289\n00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.790\nwill be completed on July 7th.\n\n290\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.520\nWhen you see it would be completed,\nit means 100% right?\n\n291\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.840\nit would be a 100% done on July 7 and\nit takes six days.\n\n292\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.500\nSo that means that we start on with\nthe second right a second, third,\n\n293\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.415\nfourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.\n\n294\n00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:21.924\nIt’s a good math [CROSSTALK] so\nwere going to start on July 2nd and\n\n295\n00:15:21.924 --> 00:15:27.853\nthen each day, we're doing work\nall the way to July 7th, six days.\n\n296\n00:15:27.853 --> 00:15:32.265\nAnd so\nif I'm 100% complete on the sixth day, and\n\n297\n00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:37.667\nthey're asking for me to figure\nit out on the fourth day, right?\n\n298\n00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:39.677\nOn July 4th, not the fourth day, sorry.\n\n299\n00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:44.798\nOn July 4th well, I've got the second,\nthe third and the fourth right?\n\n300\n00:15:44.798 --> 00:15:47.143\nAnd then after that I've got my fifth,\nsixth and seventh.\n\n301\n00:15:47.143 --> 00:15:51.932\nThat's halfway through, and\nthey're telling me it's an even\n\n302\n00:15:51.932 --> 00:15:56.188\ndistribution of labor And so\neach day is seeing roughly,\n\n303\n00:15:56.188 --> 00:16:00.670\nwhat is it,\nlike 16.66% of the work or whatever.\n\n304\n00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.340\nBut what it works out\nto is because July 4th\n\n305\n00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.990\nis right in the middle, it's 50%, right?\n\n306\n00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:12.740\nIf I'm at the end of day three on a six\nday activity, that's 50% of the duration.\n\n307\n00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.440\nAnd if it's an even distribution of labor,\n\n308\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.690\nthen I should expect to be\n50% complete on July 4th.\n\n309\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.760\nSo while they didn't come right out and\nsay it,\n\n310\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.940\nthey did give me the information I\nneeded to figure that out, all right?\n\n311\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.385\nSo now I know my budgeted\ncompletion is $2,400.\n\n312\n00:16:28.385 --> 00:16:29.716\nI don't care that it's a bid.\n\n313\n00:16:29.716 --> 00:16:32.874\nI don't care that it's\na Work Breakdown Structure Task 3.1.1.\n\n314\n00:16:32.874 --> 00:16:34.780\nI don't care about any of that.\n\n315\n00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.250\nI just needed that number right there.\n\n316\n00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.656\nThey said they could do the work for\n$2,400.\n\n317\n00:16:38.656 --> 00:16:41.350\nAnd they said it would take six days.\n\n318\n00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.810\nOn July 4th that's halfway,\nthey should be 50% done on July 4th.\n\n319\n00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.001\nAnd so if I take my formula here and\n\n320\n00:16:49.001 --> 00:16:53.778\nstart to write that out my planned\nvalue equals my budget at completion,\n\n321\n00:16:53.778 --> 00:16:58.657\n$2,400, multiplied by my planned work,\nwhich should be 50%.\n\n322\n00:16:58.657 --> 00:17:03.256\nAnd, if we work that out, that should be,\nI can do this math in my head,\n\n323\n00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:05.274\nlook at that, $1,200.\n\n324\n00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:06.435\nI'm so proud of myself.\n\n325\n00:17:06.435 --> 00:17:10.962\nSo, 2,400 times 50%, $1,200, halfway.\n\n326\n00:17:10.962 --> 00:17:15.680\nSo my planned value as\nof July 4th is $1,200.\n\n327\n00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.810\nThe reality is we could have figured\nit out for any of the days in there,\n\n328\n00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:24.100\njust the percentages make it a little\nbit harder, you might 66.66% or\n\n329\n00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.990\nsomething like that\nyou've got to work with.\n\n330\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.760\nOn the exam, they usually try\nto use numbers that work out so\n\n331\n00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.750\nyou don't need a calculator,\nbecause you don't have a calculator.\n\n332\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.620\nRight, so if you can avoid it,\nyou know, get better at doing these.\n\n333\n00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.960\nYou'll have scratch paper so\nyou can do math by hand if you need to.\n\n334\n00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.590\nBut don't count on a calculator,\nyou're not going to have one.\n\n335\n00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:47.010\nSo it will normally be numbers like\nthese that you can do in your head.\n\n336\n00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.480\nSo that's planned value.\n\n337\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.510\nThese can be done very early\non in your planning stage,\n\n338\n00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.270\nbefore you're actually executing.\n\n339\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.050\nJust while you're thinking about it,\nyou can lay these out.\n\n340\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.000\nMaybe you when you signed this\ncontract with the contractor,\n\n341\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.300\nyou made an agreement that you guys said\nhey, it's going to be a six day activity,\n\n342\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.560\nwe're going to do progress\nreports every two days.\n\n343\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.272\nRight?\nSo, on day two, day four, day six and\n\n344\n00:18:08.272 --> 00:18:09.370\nday six should be acceptance.\n\n345\n00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.560\nYou know that should be 100% done,\n\n346\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.690\nyou accept the product from\nthe contractor and you're done.\n\n347\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.260\nSo, we are going to do three measures.\n\n348\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.550\nAnd you can calculate the planned value\nfor those three measures very early on,\n\n349\n00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.340\nright there in the planning phase.\n\n350\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.300\nAnd then when you get to\nthe execution phase, now when\n\n351\n00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.540\nyou're doing monitoring and controlling,\nyou notice those three measures.\n\n352\n00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.640\nThose three milestones for\nthis particular activity.\n\n353\n00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.550\nSo on day two, you need to go and\ncollect your earned value, and\n\n354\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.410\nthen on day four you need to go and\ncollect your earned value,\n\n355\n00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.180\nand on day six you need to collect\nyour earned value and compare those,\n\n356\n00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.990\nto the planned values that you set\nout way back in the planning phase.\n\n357\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.400\nAlright, so\nlet's take a look at earned value now,\n\n358\n00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.380\nwe've talked about planned value enough.\n\n359\n00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:52.510\nSo, earned value, very similar except\ninstead of taking our budgeted completion,\n\n360\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.960\nwe're taking our plan value, okay,\nour planned value that was assigned and\n\n361\n00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.960\nwe're multiplying that by our\npercentage complete, right?\n\n362\n00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.360\nWhat of the work has actually been done?\n\n363\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:08.180\nAnd that should result in us\ngetting our earned value.\n\n364\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.610\nSo, when we start to compare this,\nwe can jump over to an example here.\n\n365\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:20.010\nActivity 7.1 is budgeted at $5,000 and\nis scheduled to complete on February 28th.\n\n366\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:25.600\nA status report dated February 26th\nindicates the activity is 20% completed.\n\n367\n00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.960\nWhat is your earn value as of the 26th?\n\n368\n00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.660\nAll right.\n\n369\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.170\nNow, this question can get a little bit\ntricky when you start to look at it.\n\n370\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.190\nWe just worked through planned value.\n\n371\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:41.920\nAnd when you look at planned value, I\nmentioned how it's really a point in time.\n\n372\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.240\nAnd when we take the planned value,\n\n373\n00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.090\nits a planned value of\na particular point in time.\n\n374\n00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.930\nThe budget at completion times\nthe work we have planned for\n\n375\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.330\nthat moment at that particular time.\n\n376\n00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.070\nAnd so that's the way that the planned\nvalue can work, and when you\n\n377\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.990\ncalculate it out that way, it is looking\nat that moment for what our plan is.\n\n378\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.690\nWhen we get into the earned value formula,\nthings get a little trickier here.\n\n379\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:08.540\nBecause reading this question,\nwhat is my planned value for the 26th?\n\n380\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.400\nWell, I don't really know,\nit doesn't tell me.\n\n381\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.070\nIt tells me my budget is $5,000,\nthat would be my budget at completion.\n\n382\n00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:19.990\nAnd it's scheduled to complete on\nFebruary 28th and this is February 26th.\n\n383\n00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.620\nI don't really know my planned value for\nthe 26th.\n\n384\n00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.600\nSo I might be tempted to choose\nthat option on the exam.\n\n385\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.870\nOn the exam you'll see a couple of\ndifferent exam options, you know,\n\n386\n00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.210\nusually just numbers for\nthe various formula results.\n\n387\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.910\nBut there will usually be one that\nsays not enough information provided.\n\n388\n00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:36.490\nRight?\nAnd\n\n389\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.370\nI might be tempted to provide that\nnot enough information provided.\n\n390\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.870\nBut when you look at the earned value\nformula here, when it talks about the plan\n\n391\n00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.440\nvalue, it's really talking about\nthe plan value at completion.\n\n392\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.650\nWhat's our plan value for this activity\nas a whole, not necessarily on the 26th?\n\n393\n00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:55.620\nSo I don't know my plan value for\nthe 26th, but I know my plan value for\n\n394\n00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.890\nthe activity as a whole is $5,000, so\nwhen I come down here to calculate out my\n\n395\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:05.210\nearned value,\nmy earned value would be my plan value\n\n396\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:10.885\nof $5,000 times the work that's complete,\nwhich I know is 20%, all right?\n\n397\n00:21:10.885 --> 00:21:15.770\nSo 20% of the work is done and\nit's a $5,000 plan value.\n\n398\n00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.900\nSo if we multiply that out,\nfact check me here Ronnie, but\n\n399\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.680\nthat should be $1,000, right?\n\n400\n00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.539\n>> It should be $1,000.\n\n401\n00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:22.642\n>> All right so that is $1,000.\n\n402\n00:21:22.642 --> 00:21:26.970\nNow that means my earned value\nas of the 26th is $1,000.\n\n403\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.410\nIs that good or bad?\n\n404\n00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:34.630\nWell, if the exam is asking you\nto pick what the earned value is,\n\n405\n00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.570\nyou know the answer.\n\n406\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:36.610\nRight?\nYou got it right there.\n\n407\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.530\nThe earned value is $1,000 as of the 26th,\nbut if the exam is asking you whether it's\n\n408\n00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.960\ngood or bad, we actually don't\nhave enough information for that.\n\n409\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.870\nWe don't know how long this activity is.\n\n410\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.170\nThis could be a three day activity.\n\n411\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.350\nWe could be on day one, which is the 26th,\nthen you've got the 27th and the 28th, so\n\n412\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.230\nwe are only a third of the way through.\n\n413\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.920\nWe are not a third of the way\npercentage wise, so it looks bad.\n\n414\n00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.495\nThis could be 100 day activity,\nso it'd look really bad.\n\n415\n00:21:59.495 --> 00:22:02.200\n[LAUGH] It could be bad, or\n\n416\n00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.130\nit could be that we have\nan uneven distribution of labor.\n\n417\n00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.020\nThis could be a back-loaded\nlabor activity,\n\n418\n00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.000\nwhere we expect to only be at 20%.\n\n419\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.800\nSince I don't know the planned value for\nthe 26th specifically,\n\n420\n00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.840\nI can't say whether this is good or\nbad, so if they're asking me that,\n\n421\n00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.190\nif they're asking me, am I ahead or\nbehind, I don't really know, and\n\n422\n00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.970\nI will have to choose that option that\nsays not enough information provided.\n\n423\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.060\nBut if they're just asking for\nthe earned value, I've got that.\n\n424\n00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.580\nI've got my budgeted,\nwhat I should be at 100%.\n\n425\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.280\nWhen I'm at 100% completion, my planned\nvalue is $5,000, that's what I've planned.\n\n426\n00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.490\nRight now on the 26th, I'm only 20% of\nthe way through and so my earned value,\n\n427\n00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.870\nregardless of date, is $1,000.\n\n428\n00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.560\nIf my plan value for the 26th is $2,000,\nthen I'm in trouble.\n\n429\n00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.330\nBut if my plan value for the 26th\nis $1,000, then I'm right on track.\n\n430\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.280\nAnd that very well may be that\nI'm right on track with plan,\n\n431\n00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.680\nI just don't necessarily\nhave that information here.\n\n432\n00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.240\nOkay.\n\n433\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.630\nSo calculating out earned\nvalue can be pretty simple.\n\n434\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.990\nIt is easy to get tripped up though,\n\n435\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.050\nespecially when we look at our plan\nvalue here and calculated it out.\n\n436\n00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.480\nThe another thing we can\ntriples up is present value.\n\n437\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.940\nPlan value and present value they\nboth give the preview in PV.\n\n438\n00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.780\nAnd present value is really\ntalking about materials, usually\n\n439\n00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.800\nyour present value materials versus\ntheir value in the future and the past.\n\n440\n00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.340\nThe plan value is what we see\nin earn value analysis or\n\n441\n00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.250\nearn value management and EVM is what\nyou're really being test on them.\n\n442\n00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.430\nAlright, let's take a look\nat another example here.\n\n443\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.600\nThis one gives us a good\nchunk of information.\n\n444\n00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.990\nIt says activity 4.3 is scheduled for\nJuly 3rd through July 6th, so\n\n445\n00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.800\nwe're looking at a four day activity.\n\n446\n00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.290\nWe've got a budget of $12,000.\n\n447\n00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:42.503\nLabor and costs are evenly\ndistributed across all days.\n\n448\n00:23:42.503 --> 00:23:46.790\nA status report for July 4th indicates\naccounting has paid out $8,000.\n\n449\n00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.483\nWhat is your EV for July 4th?\n\n450\n00:23:49.483 --> 00:23:53.654\nNow, as I read through this What I'm\ntrying to do is take this information and\n\n451\n00:23:53.654 --> 00:23:56.104\ncatalog it with where it needs to be,\nright?\n\n452\n00:23:56.104 --> 00:23:59.330\nSo I see that we're scheduled\nJuly 3rd through July 6th.\n\n453\n00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:03.030\nSo the first thing I thought was,\nduration, four days, okay?\n\n454\n00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.009\nSo now I've got a duration,\nthis is a four day activity.\n\n455\n00:24:05.009 --> 00:24:07.029\nA budget of $12,000, great.\n\n456\n00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:08.990\nThere's my budget at completion.\n\n457\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.500\nLabor and costs are evenly\ndistributed across all four days.\n\n458\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:16.486\nNow I'm thinking, okay, I should have 25%\nof my labor, done each of the four days\n\n459\n00:24:16.486 --> 00:24:21.753\nand if my budget is $12000, I should\nbe spending, roughly, $3000 per day for\n\n460\n00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:26.509\nfour days, these are the things running\nthrough my head as I start reading this.\n\n461\n00:24:26.509 --> 00:24:29.630\nI get a status report for July 4.\n\n462\n00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.810\nWell, this is July 3 to July 6.\n\n463\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.229\nSo we're only on day two, so at the end\nof day two but it's a four day project so\n\n464\n00:24:35.229 --> 00:24:37.190\nthat means we're actually half way right?\n\n465\n00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.350\nSo half way through,\n\n466\n00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:42.490\nI get a status report telling me\nwe've paid out $8,000 to date okay?\n\n467\n00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:47.480\nNow before I've even thought of a formula\nI know that if I'm spending roughly $3,000\n\n468\n00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.890\na day I should be at $6,000\nat the end of day four or\n\n469\n00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:55.060\nat the end of the 4th and\nI see I'm at $8,000 today.\n\n470\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.970\nSo without even a formula, we kinda know\nthat this project has some problems.\n\n471\n00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.760\nIt's advancing too rapidly for some\nreason, and so we've got a problem there.\n\n472\n00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.630\nBut they're not asking me about that.\n\n473\n00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.080\nThey just wanna know what's\nmy earned value for July 4th.\n\n474\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.210\nThat's all I needed to know,\nwhat is my earned value, right?\n\n475\n00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:14.040\nI actually have enough information here\nto calculate out my planned value too but\n\n476\n00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.680\nall they're asking for is earned value.\n\n477\n00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.110\nSo if I take a look at that formula.\n\n478\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.870\nI come in here and I can say,\n\n479\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:23.790\nEV = my planned value times\nmy percentage complete.\n\n480\n00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.680\nWell, my planned value was $12,000,\n\n481\n00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.910\nright, that's my overall project cost or\nactivity cost.\n\n482\n00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.150\nAnd I'm gonna multiply\nthat by my work complete.\n\n483\n00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:38.380\nMy work complete well, I don't have it\nas a percentage of completion, do I?\n\n484\n00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.382\nI have it as a dollar value, as $8000.\n\n485\n00:25:41.382 --> 00:25:43.081\nSo what do I have to do?\n\n486\n00:25:43.081 --> 00:25:44.962\nI've kind of gotta convert that.\n\n487\n00:25:44.962 --> 00:25:50.067\n$8000 is a percentage of $12000,\nit is 66%,\n\n488\n00:25:50.067 --> 00:25:56.170\nso I'm going to just kind of put this,\nactually 66.66 recurring,\n\n489\n00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:01.280\nyou know it's basically\ntwo thirds of $12,000.\n\n490\n00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.650\nSo that's where I'm at right now, okay.\n\n491\n00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.700\nThat's my $8,000,\nthat's what I've paid out and\n\n492\n00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.330\nin fact I really didn't even need to do\nthat because they're telling me here,\n\n493\n00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.040\nJuly 4th indicates accounting\nhas paid out $8,000 to date.\n\n494\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.420\nWhat is your earned value for July 4th?\n\n495\n00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.500\nI've paid out $8,000.\n\n496\n00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.260\nThat is my earned value, right?\n\n497\n00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:22.630\nAnd so if you take $12,000 and multiply\nit by that 66.66%, you get $8,000.\n\n498\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.130\nThere's my earned value.\n\n499\n00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.720\nI didn't even need a formula.\n\n500\n00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:30.250\nThey told me the earned value\nas part of the question, right?\n\n501\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.370\nBut I had to know that that's what I was\nlooking at, that that's what I was seeing.\n\n502\n00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.660\nMeanwhile, they gave me all the data for\nplan value and so, a question like this\n\n503\n00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.270\nwould normally be followed with,\nwhat's the current status of the project?\n\n504\n00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.350\nAhead?\n\n505\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.000\nOn plan?\n\n506\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000\nBehind?\n\n507\n00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.700\nOr not enough information provided, right?\n\n508\n00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.700\nAnd based on this, I do have enough\nto figure out my plan value.\n\n509\n00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.710\nMy plan value,\nif we just kinda update this,\n\n510\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:58.218\nmy plan value equals my budget at\ncompletion, which is $12,000, right?\n\n511\n00:26:58.218 --> 00:27:03.760\nTimes and\nthen what my work completed should be.\n\n512\n00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.930\nWell, on July 4th, that's the end of\nthe second day of a four day activity\n\n513\n00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.950\nwith evenly distributed costs,\nI should be at 50%, right.\n\n514\n00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.820\nAnd so if I multiply that out,\n\n515\n00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:21.660\nthat's going to be $6,000 right,\nand if I take this one.\n\n516\n00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.620\nLet me just make this kind of\nlook a little evenly here.\n\n517\n00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.386\nThere we go.\n\n518\n00:27:26.386 --> 00:27:32.220\nSo I've got $6,000 is my planned value and\n$8,000 is my earned value.\n\n519\n00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.700\nI've earned more than I've planned.\n\n520\n00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.660\nAnd while that might sound like a good\nthing like hey we're getting work done,\n\n521\n00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.490\nit can be it could be a good thing.\n\n522\n00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.200\nAnd it might not be.\n\n523\n00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.180\nMaybe I had contractors\narranged to come out.\n\n524\n00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.590\nLet's say it's construction, right?\n\n525\n00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.660\nSo they're putting up drywall, and\noriginally they planned to send me\n\n526\n00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.350\nfour contractors for\nfour days to put up the drywall.\n\n527\n00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.200\nBut at the last minute they said I\ngot two extra guys available, so\n\n528\n00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.440\nhow about I send you six guys and\nthey come and\n\n529\n00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.080\nthey work three days, and\nthen they're just done on day three.\n\n530\n00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.520\nAnd so they do that.\nThey send me six guys.\n\n531\n00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.880\nThey come out and\nthey start doing the work.\n\n532\n00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.770\nAnd so I get ahead, right.\n\n533\n00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.040\nIt's gonna cost me the same except for\n\n534\n00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.510\nbeing spread over four days now\nit's spread over three days.\n\n535\n00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:14.460\nAnd that's good.\n\n536\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.150\nSo now I'm on track and\nI'm ahead of schedule, right.\n\n537\n00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.830\nAnd I'm gonna come out at the same\nbudget numbers, so I'm okay.\n\n538\n00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.859\nBut it could also be a problem.\n\n539\n00:28:23.859 --> 00:28:25.877\nIt could be hey I'm going\nto send you four guys and\n\n540\n00:28:25.877 --> 00:28:27.759\nremember how I said they were $15/hour?\n\n541\n00:28:27.759 --> 00:28:30.019\nNow they're $17/hour, right?\n\n542\n00:28:30.019 --> 00:28:31.980\nAnd now it changes so\nI'm having to pay more and\n\n543\n00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.130\nnow I'm going to come in over budget.\n\n544\n00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.430\nSo what this tells me is not that\nI necessarily have a problem, but\n\n545\n00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.670\nI need to find out why\nthere's a discrepancy.\n\n546\n00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:40.600\nI see that difference.\n\n547\n00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.340\nI need to go and find out why, okay.\n\n548\n00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.530\nIf they had contacted me and said, hey we\ncan send you six guys instead of three.\n\n549\n00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.210\nSorry, what did I say earlier?\n\n550\n00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.610\nLike four guys instead of three?\n\n551\n00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:52.490\n>> Four.\n>> So if they could send\n\n552\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:53.970\nme four guys instead of three.\n\n553\n00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:54.770\nGreat.\n\n554\n00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.090\nLet's do a change ticket.\n\n555\n00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.410\nLet's put a change ticket in,\nlet's update our baseline,\n\n556\n00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.600\nlet's update our art project to reflect\nthis new change and put it in place.\n\n557\n00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.530\nAnd now our plan value and\n\n558\n00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:06.450\nour earn value will match because\nour plan has been updated, right.\n\n559\n00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.740\nWhen you're plan value and\nand earn value are different,\n\n560\n00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.420\nit means that something deviated\nfrom the plan and that's never good.\n\n561\n00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.450\nIt's never good.\n\n562\n00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:17.160\nI shouldn't say never, I guess there are\npossibilities where there's risks that you\n\n563\n00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:22.950\ndidn't recognize that come through and you\nare able to capitalize on those and make\n\n564\n00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.491\na gain, that does happen, but for the most\npart, when those are different, it's bad.\n\n565\n00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:31.070\nAll right, so just be aware that when\nthey give you information on a question,\n\n566\n00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.160\nthere's more than one thing\nthey can be asking for.\n\n567\n00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.630\nAnd potentially I could see this\nsame question more than once.\n\n568\n00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.740\nOne that asks me my earned value and\nit's easy cuz they already told it to me.\n\n569\n00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.840\nOr one that asks me for\nthe planned value on that day.\n\n570\n00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.840\nOr one that asks me for the variance\nbetween earned value and planned value.\n\n571\n00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.600\nAll of that could be built\noff of this same question.\n\n572\n00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.910\nI could see the same question four times.\n\n573\n00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:54.390\nBut then they ask me for a different\ndetail out of it each time, right?\n\n574\n00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.390\nSo lot of power can come from these.\n\n575\n00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:00.170\nThe trick is to just get used to that,\nget used to the word problem format,\n\n576\n00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.690\nread through them, practice,\nmake sure you know the formulas.\n\n577\n00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.340\nCuz as you read through you've gotta be\npicking out the details that they give you\n\n578\n00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.400\nand saying all right,\nthat's budget at completion.\n\n579\n00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.550\nThere's my planned value.\n\n580\n00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.790\nThere's my earned value.\n\n581\n00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.440\nAnd that way when you get to the formula\npart, you're just plugging in values and\n\n582\n00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.230\ndoing math.\n\n583\n00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.250\n>> Don, thank you again for showing us\nthose demonstrations there on some of\n\n584\n00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:26.090\nthe different ways that we might actually\nbe tackling word problems on the PNP exam.\n\n585\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.960\nRemember that what we focused\non here is the earned value.\n\n586\n00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.590\nYou can't really determine the earned\nvalue without knowing that planned value\n\n587\n00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.730\nas well so it's very essential that\nwe know how to calculate that so\n\n588\n00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.630\nwe can determine what\nwe're really asked here.\n\n589\n00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.890\nAnd that last little bit of information,\nabout maybe possibly seeing that same\n\n590\n00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.700\nquestion, but being asked about different\npieces of that information, that's\n\n591\n00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.670\nsomething you've got to be thinking about\nwhen you actually in your studies here.\n\n592\n00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:53.430\nFocus in on actually determining all\nthose answers during your practice,\n\n593\n00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.290\nthat way when you're asked\nabout it on the exam,\n\n594\n00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:59.070\nyou know exactly what you're actually\nasked about and what you actually need to\n\n595\n00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.890\ndetermine from that without you having to\ngo, all right, that same question again.\n\n596\n00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.020\nLet me re-determine every single one.\n\n597\n00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.260\nDon, any last hints there\nbefore we close out the show?\n\n598\n00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.850\n>> Definitely don't stop here, right?\n\n599\n00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.610\nSo we got a chance to see earned value,\nbut\n\n600\n00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.750\nyou're normally gonna see it\nin line with variance, right?\n\n601\n00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.110\nI mentioned variance a few minutes ago.\n\n602\n00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:20.010\nSo we're gonna do some more shows where\nwe'll cover schedule variance and\n\n603\n00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.490\ncost variance,\nwhich are important to understand so\n\n604\n00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.060\nyou can start to measure that\ndifference from your plan.\n\n605\n00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.400\nAll that gets factored in together,\nso those are kind of key.\n\n606\n00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.130\nAnd then we're gonna do another\nepisode down a little bit further,\n\n607\n00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:34.300\nwe'll take a look at the cumulative values\nbecause you'll need to be able to forecast\n\n608\n00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:38.430\nout to the future, so we'll have to take a\nlook at things like estimated completion,\n\n609\n00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.640\nand budgeted completion,\nand all those other things.\n\n610\n00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.490\nAnd start to figure out\nwhere we're gonna end up\n\n611\n00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:46.620\nwhen a project kinda hits a future stage.\n\n612\n00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.750\nSo what we looked at here was really\njust looking at the present But\n\n613\n00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.730\nbe aware that were going to be looking\ntowards the future a little bit later\n\n614\n00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.485\non so we'll see that in the future.\n\n615\n00:31:54.485 --> 00:31:56.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right excellent advice for us and\n\n616\n00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.540\nthat a great place

The Schedule Performance helps us to determine whether we are ahead of schedule based on time, deliverables or even cost.  The determination of the SPI tells us how much we can be ahead or behind schedule and  provide an indicator of where Project Mangers may need to act to bring a project back on schedule, according to the guys.  They show some of the most common types of questions likely encountered by a PMP candidate.",

00:00:18.903\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking a look at PMP,\n\n4\n00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:21.150\nProject Management Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.600\nWe're actually gonna a little bit of\ntime going into some different formulas.\n\n6\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.885\nToday, we're gonna be hitting\nthe idea of schedule performance, and\n\n7\n00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:30.760\nshowing how we can also discover\nthe idea of variance too.\n\n8\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.940\nAnd who'd better to help us then,\nwell, Mr. Don Pezet himself.\n\n9\n00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.820\nHow's it going, Don?\n\n10\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.890\n>> It is going great, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.070\nReady to jump into the world of\nvariance and just as a refresher.\n\n12\n00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.588\nWhen we setup our schedule we do\nour whole project plan, right.\n\n13\n00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:46.193\nAll in the planning phase you're\ncoming up with how things should be.\n\n14\n00:00:46.193 --> 00:00:49.840\nAnd then when the project actually starts\nrolling into execution we're monitoring.\n\n15\n00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.330\nAnd we're gathering data back\non where things are going.\n\n16\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.120\nAnd what you're gonna notice is that what\nhappens in the real world is a little\n\n17\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.340\ndifferent than your plan.\n\n18\n00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.410\nWell, hopefully, it isn't.\n\n19\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.410\nHopefully they're identical and\nthings are great.\n\n20\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.760\nBut, sometimes you get ahead of schedule,\nsometimes you get behind schedules.\n\n21\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.730\nSometimes you get over or under budget.\n\n22\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.980\nThese things happen.\n\n23\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.950\nAnd our main goal is to track those and\nmake sure they stay in control,\n\n24\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.340\nthey don't go too far.\n\n25\n00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.310\nBut the further away you get from\nthe plan, that's called variance, right.\n\n26\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.328\nWe're deviating from what we planned.\n\n27\n00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:18.698\nAnd we need to be able to measure that.\n\n28\n00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:21.431\nAnd we need to do it repeatedly\nthroughout our project,\n\n29\n00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:22.953\nthat way we can create trends.\n\n30\n00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:25.250\nSo we can see if things are getting\nworse and worse, and worse.\n\n31\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.940\nIf if they're getting better,\nwe need to have an understanding of that.\n\n32\n00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.840\nSo calculating variance\nis really important.\n\n33\n00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.330\nAnd in a project you're gonna\nbe doing this all the time.\n\n34\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.050\nNow you probably have project\nmanagement software doing it for you.\n\n35\n00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.210\nBut if you don't,\nwell you can do it by hand.\n\n36\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.310\nOn the exam you have to do it by hand.\n\n37\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.160\nSo that's why it's important for\nus to look at that, see how it works and\n\n38\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.220\nmake sure we've a good grasp on it.\n\n39\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.260\nAnd that's what we are going to do\nright here is look at calculating out\n\n40\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.050\nschedule variance.\n\n41\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.430\nAll right, well let's kick things off.\n\n42\n00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.520\nI got a fancy little picture here just to\nkinda make sure we have a good handle on\n\n43\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.850\nwhat variance is.\n\n44\n00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.280\nRemember that we have a plan,\nwhich in my case, is this blue line.\n\n45\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.610\nAnd then we have what's\nactually happening.\n\n46\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.050\nAnd I've got this red line.\n\n47\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.410\nBut if I'm measuring my schedule\nvariance at every point on this graph,\n\n48\n00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.110\nI can see that I'm right in line here,\nright in line, right in line.\n\n49\n00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.000\nAnd once I get to this measuring instance,\n\n50\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.620\nright here I start to\nsee a little deviation.\n\n51\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.290\nBut it's small enough that I probably\ndon't think about it, right?\n\n52\n00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.280\nI'm like, it's a little bit off,\nbut not a big deal.\n\n53\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.560\nBut by the time I get to\nthe next measuring point here,\n\n54\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.480\nnow that variance is starting to grow.\n\n55\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.440\nAnd by the time I get to the next\none it's getting really big.\n\n56\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.650\nI'm really getting a significantly\nlarger gap in between these lines, And\n\n57\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.200\nthat's my warning sign.\n\n58\n00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.320\nThat means I need to take action.\n\n59\n00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.470\nI had a warning back here, but\nI didn't know if it was a fluke, if\n\n60\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.160\nthings were just gonna curve back again,\nor if it was gonna continue to get worse.\n\n61\n00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.980\nAnd if it continues to get worse,\nwe need to correct it.\n\n62\n00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.160\nWe correct it, we bring things back\nin line, and we get ourselves back.\n\n63\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.840\nNow, I'm showing the red line going up.\n\n64\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.050\nThe red can be going down.\n\n65\n00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.280\nIt can be doing an S curve.\n\n66\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.900\nYou could be all over the place\nwith these things, right?\n\n67\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.710\nThat happens just as\noften as anything else.\n\n68\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.780\nFor example, I might have something\na little more skewed like this.\n\n69\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.050\nEspecially if we made project corrections,\nright.\n\n70\n00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.800\nI could have it where maybe in\nthe beginning I got off to a slow start.\n\n71\n00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.560\nAnd so\nI started making some phone calls, and\n\n72\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.540\nsaying what the heck is\ngoing on down there.\n\n73\n00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.614\nAnd notice how the variation\nkinda stabilizes right here.\n\n74\n00:03:19.614 --> 00:03:22.450\nIt doesn't get any worse, but\nit doesn't get any better.\n\n75\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.040\nWe've identified the problem.\n\n76\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.390\nWe've stopped it and now we start\ncorrecting it and we get back in line.\n\n77\n00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.990\nBut maybe we over correct.\n\n78\n00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.600\nI used some of my reserves to\nbring in some extra staff and\n\n79\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.320\nI still have that extra\nstaff hanging about.\n\n80\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.470\nAnd now I'm starting to go the opposite\nway, where I'm going over budget,\n\n81\n00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.740\nor something of that nature, and\nI've gotta bring that back in line.\n\n82\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.010\nAnd so\nyou may see your variance go like this,\n\n83\n00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.040\nwhere it's constantly getting bigger and\nsmaller over time.\n\n84\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.750\nThat's just how projects go.\n\n85\n00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.840\nBut the point is,\nby the end of the project,\n\n86\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.190\nwe need to be as close to\nthat point as possible.\n\n87\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.870\nThat we have everything right\nwhere it's supposed to be.\n\n88\n00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.430\nSo in order to do that we need\nto be taking measurements\n\n89\n00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.858\non a regular basis to make sure we\ncan spot when this is happening.\n\n90\n00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:09.700\nAll right, now in another episode we\ntalked about planned value and earned\n\n91\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.780\nvalue and how those work for calculating\nkind of where we're at right now.\n\n92\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.860\nThose are still important\nconcepts here in scheduling\n\n93\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.830\nbecause when we talk about schedule\nvariance what's the formula?\n\n94\n00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.140\nWell, the formula for schedule\nvariance is one of the easier ones.\n\n95\n00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.380\nSchedule variance equals earned\nvalue minus planned value.\n\n96\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.010\nAnd so what does that mean?\n\n97\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.023\nIt means I need to know my earned value\nand I need to know my planned values.\n\n98\n00:04:32.023 --> 00:04:37.480\nAnd if I don't know those values, then I\ncan't figure out my schedule variance.\n\n99\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.000\nSo when you're on the exam, and you get\nto a question and it's asking about\n\n100\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.440\nschedule variance, you actually\ncould have a really hard question.\n\n101\n00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.940\nYou could have one that's gonna\nrequire a lot of work, all right.\n\n102\n00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.050\nBut, let's just kind of focus in\non the individual pieces here.\n\n103\n00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.240\nSo, schedule variance, how far am I\ndeviating from my current schedule?\n\n104\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.150\nAnd the result of this formula\nis gonna be one of three things.\n\n105\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.332\nIt's gonna either be a positive number,\na negative number, or a zero.\n\n106\n00:05:04.332 --> 00:05:08.880\nAll right, if its a positive number,\nthan we're ahead of schedule.\n\n107\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.110\nMore work has gotten done than what\nwe anticipated, that may be good or\n\n108\n00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.330\nbad, right.\n\n109\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.690\nIf its a zero we're right on schedule,\nthings are perfect.\n\n110\n00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.700\nAnd if its less than zero,\n\n111\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.770\nif its a negative number than we're behind\nschedule, now we've got a problem, okay.\n\n112\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.950\nSo those are the three possible\noutcomes of this formula.\n\n113\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.250\nBut all three of them require us to know\nour earned value and our planned value.\n\n114\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.470\nCuz that's really what we're\ncomparing at the end of the day,\n\n115\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.360\nis the variance between those two.\n\n116\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.550\nSo when we look at this formula,\nI know I need that information.\n\n117\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.110\nLet's take a look at an example\nquestion and see how that pans out.\n\n118\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.030\nAll right, this is is one of the most\nstraight forward types of questions you'll\n\n119\n00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.830\nget on the exam because they feed\nus exactly the data we need.\n\n120\n00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.550\nIt says we've received a status report for\nactivity 7.9, it's dated July 23rd.\n\n121\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.999\nThe report indicates\nan earned value of $3,000.\n\n122\n00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:01.860\nAccording to the project plan,\nthe value should be $3,500.\n\n123\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.840\nWhat is your schedule variance?\n\n124\n00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.850\nThis question is straightforward because\nthey give me my planned value and\n\n125\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.820\nthey give me my earned value, and all I\nhave to do is run it through a formula.\n\n126\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.810\nAll I have to do is take my earned\nvalue and subtract my planned value.\n\n127\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.840\nNow if those two are equal,\nI'll get a zero, right?\n\n128\n00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.970\nBecause a number minus the same number\nis always zero and I have no variance,\n\n129\n00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.910\nI'm right on schedule.\n\n130\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.880\nIf the numbers are different though,\nthat's where things start to get a little\n\n131\n00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.020\nscrewy, and I have to be really\ncareful because I could mix this up.\n\n132\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.090\nIf I do planned value minus earned\nvalue instead, where I normally might\n\n133\n00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.280\nnormally get a negative number I might\nnow get a positive number or vice versa.\n\n134\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.490\nAnd so\ninstead of thinking I'm behind schedule,\n\n135\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.180\nI actually think I'm ahead of schedule.\n\n136\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.440\nSo when you memorize the formula\nthe order is really important.\n\n137\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.470\nSo when I fill this out I need to say that\nmy schedule variance is my earned value.\n\n138\n00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.219\nSo we've earned $3,000.\n\n139\n00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:01.402\nThat's how much we've kind of paid out so\nfar, and\n\n140\n00:07:01.402 --> 00:07:05.894\nI need to subtract my plan and\nmy plan is $3,500.\n\n141\n00:07:05.894 --> 00:07:13.391\nAll right, and if I work that out,\nI end up with a ($500), right.\n\n142\n00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:18.010\nAnd if you deal with accountants,\nthey'll write it like that.\n\n143\n00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.020\nRight, see in parenthesis,\nyou might just say negative $500.\n\n144\n00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.650\nIf i had gotten these backwards, if I had\nsaid planned value minus earned value.\n\n145\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.210\nI would have ended up with\na positive $500 right?\n\n146\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.220\nA positive $500 means that I'm ahead.\n\n147\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.980\nI've done more work than I\nthought I would at this point.\n\n148\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.690\nA negative number means I'm behind.\n\n149\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.940\nI've done less work.\n\n150\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.262\nThey are both a problem, right.\n\n151\n00:07:36.262 --> 00:07:38.450\nNever assume that being\nahead good is a good thing.\n\n152\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.760\nThere is a reason why you are ahead.\n\n153\n00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.740\nAnd it's something you didn't plan for,\nand that's bad, right?\n\n154\n00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.460\nIf it's something you planned for, you\nwould've already done a change ticket and\n\n155\n00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.300\nalready updated your numbers and\nyour variance would be zero, right?\n\n156\n00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.359\nSo any time you see variance,\nit's not a good thing.\n\n157\n00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:56.031\nIt's something that you need to find out\nthe root cause of and either stop or\n\n158\n00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:57.079\ncapitalize on.\n\n159\n00:07:57.079 --> 00:08:00.962\nRight, you know with risks you can always\njump in and really take advantage or\n\n160\n00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:04.844\nexploit the risk to make it even better,\nand it gets just better and better and\n\n161\n00:08:04.844 --> 00:08:07.440\nbetter, but\neither way you need to be aware.\n\n162\n00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.240\nSo here I see a negative $500 though and\nthat means hey,\n\n163\n00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.900\nI should have gotten $500 more\nworth of work done by this point.\n\n164\n00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.140\nWhy not, why hasn't that happened?\n\n165\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.760\nAnd I can go in the field and find out.\n\n166\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.700\nMaybe I was supposed to have ten\ncontractors on the job site and\n\n167\n00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.180\none called in sick and I only had nine.\n\n168\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.360\nAnd since only nine were there,\nI didn't have to pay for the tenth one.\n\n169\n00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.890\nBut less work got done cuz there were\nonly nine instead of ten, right?\n\n170\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.090\nThat's a problem,\nnow we gotta make that up.\n\n171\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.440\nSo maybe the next day instead of 10,\nI need 11 people to make up for the 1\n\n172\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.840\nI was short yesterday, to even things up,\nI need to be aware of that, right.\n\n173\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.130\nBut calculating that various,\nreally easy here, okay.\n\n174\n00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:50.150\nHowever on the exam you might\nget one question like this but\n\n175\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.980\nnormally it's going to be\na little harder then that, right.\n\n176\n00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.020\nScheduled variance is kind\nof an easy to calculate so\n\n177\n00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.110\nthey normally like to throw\na little wrench in there.\n\n178\n00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.905\nHere they very specifically gave me my\nearned value and my plan value right.\n\n179\n00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:03.062\nSo I've got to, they didn't call it plan\nvalue here but I know that's what is\n\n180\n00:09:03.062 --> 00:09:06.240\nbecause they tell me according to\nthe project plan blah, blah, blah right.\n\n181\n00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:12.882\nSo I know that's my plan value, but\nif they had put the question like this.\n\n182\n00:09:12.882 --> 00:09:19.710\nWork breakdown structure task 3.1.1 has\nspent for $4,000 and is 25% complete.\n\n183\n00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.560\nThe project plan shows that\n$4,000 is correct, but\n\n184\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.390\nthe task should be 50% complete,\nwhat is the schedule variance?\n\n185\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.410\nOkay, well, what is my earned value and\nwhat is my planned value?\n\n186\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.440\nWe actually don't know,\nthey give us how much has been spent and\n\n187\n00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.010\nhow much is complete.\n\n188\n00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.730\nThey haven't actually\nfactored those together yet.\n\n189\n00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:48.300\nRemember that earned value is your\nplanned value times the work complete.\n\n190\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.680\nAnd so, I've got my plan value up here,\n$4,000, and my work completed 50%.\n\n191\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.030\nBut I have to factor that in, all right?\n\n192\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.850\nAnd I know that my plan value\nis my budget at completion,\n\n193\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.110\nwhich I actually don't know.\n\n194\n00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.930\nWe'll have to extrapolate that ourselves,\nand then my,\n\n195\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.400\nmultiply that by the, what I expect of\nthe work should be complete at that point.\n\n196\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.790\nSo looking at this,\nI have a little bit more math to do.\n\n197\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.170\nI'm gonna have to calculate earned value,\nand I'm gonna have to calculate\n\n198\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.870\nplanned value, and then I can measure\nthe difference to get my schedule value.\n\n199\n00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.614\nSo we end up with something\na little more complex.\n\n200\n00:10:20.614 --> 00:10:23.415\nHere my schedule value is going to equal,\nor\n\n201\n00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:28.410\nmy schedule variance is going to equal\nI need my earned value first, right?\n\n202\n00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:35.180\nAn earned value is my planned\nvalue times my %complete, right?\n\n203\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.193\nAnd then I need to\nsubtract my planned value.\n\n204\n00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:45.096\nAnd my planned value is my budget\nat completion times %complete,\n\n205\n00:10:45.096 --> 00:10:51.046\nwhich you know would really be 100% if\nit were the end, but in this case we're\n\n206\n00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:56.780\ndoing at this particular point in time so\nwe'll use that information.\n\n207\n00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.490\nSo now this formula becomes a lot\nmore complex, in fact let me just,\n\n208\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.450\ncomplex enough that I've gotta\nshrink my font so this will all fit.\n\n209\n00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.260\nThere we go, okay, so\n\n210\n00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.200\nnow, what was a simple formula\nbecomes a little more complex.\n\n211\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.640\nBut it's still not that bad because\nthey did give me the information I need.\n\n212\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.960\nSo SV equals my plan value,\n\n213\n00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.500\nwhich is $4,000 * and here I'm talking\n\n214\n00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.640\nabout my earned value, so it's what\nI've actually done, which is only 25%.\n\n215\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.610\nAnd then I need to subtract\nfrom that my planned value,\n\n216\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.294\nor budgeted completion,\nwhich at this particular stage is $4000.\n\n217\n00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.345\nI don't actually know what the budget is\nfor the full task, but I'm wanting to\n\n218\n00:11:44.345 --> 00:11:48.261\ncalculate at this point in time so I can\nuse this number that they've provided me,\n\n219\n00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:50.281\n$4000 and multiply that by 50%.\n\n220\n00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:55.029\nWe're supposed to be 50% done,\nokay, and now when we take that and\n\n221\n00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:58.906\nrun it, actually need a little\nmore room in this square.\n\n222\n00:11:58.906 --> 00:12:01.902\nThere we go, now we run all that,\n\n223\n00:12:01.902 --> 00:12:07.366\nwe get SV = 4,000 x 25%\nis a whopping $1,000.\n\n224\n00:12:07.366 --> 00:12:12.635\nAnd we're gonna subtract 4,000 x 50%,\n\n225\n00:12:12.635 --> 00:12:20.090\nwhich is a whopping $ 2,000\nwhich equals a loss of $1000,\n\n226\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:25.885\nso our variance right\nhere ends up being $1000.\n\n227\n00:12:25.885 --> 00:12:29.050\nSo I had to do a little\nextra work on this one.\n\n228\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.920\nI had to calculate my earned value,\nI had to calculate my planned value, and\n\n229\n00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.100\nthen I had to subtract those out to find\nthat variation, and then I got it, right?\n\n230\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.040\nIt wasn't that hard but\n\n231\n00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.570\nI actually needed to know three\nformulas to solve one problem.\n\n232\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:47.090\nI had to know the earn value formula,\nthe plan value formula, and\n\n233\n00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.340\nthe schedule variance formula and\nthen applied each one to get the data.\n\n234\n00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.565\nThat is not uncommon on the exam,\n\n235\n00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:57.340\n[LAUGH] you will see that happen where\nyou got to use all of your formulas.\n\n236\n00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.220\nAnd so to help with this, this is one of\nthe little pieces of advice that I always\n\n237\n00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:05.190\ngive people is when you go in to take\nthe exam, right at the very beginning of\n\n238\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.440\nthe exam you sit down, the exam starts,\nand you have got this scratch paper.\n\n239\n00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.190\nPieces of notebook paper that are blank,\nwell, if you've got formulas memorized,\n\n240\n00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.210\njust write them down real quick,\nit only takes a second.\n\n241\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.060\nIt doesn't take long to\nwrite the formulas down.\n\n242\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.620\nAnd that way when you get\nto questions like these,\n\n243\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.920\nyou're not racking your brain trying to\ncome with them, you just look over and\n\n244\n00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.140\nsee the formulas and you just run\nthrough them, and it's no big deal.\n\n245\n00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.550\nAnd I assembled this to write it out\nlike this, but I didn't have to do that,\n\n246\n00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.180\nyou can do a lot of this in your head.\n\n247\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.440\nThe exam, will typically use numbers\nthat are easy to do in your head,\n\n248\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.400\nbecause they don't give you a calculator,\nright?\n\n249\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.382\nSo, when you talk about 25% of $4000 or\n50% of $4000,\n\n250\n00:13:41.382 --> 00:13:46.961\nthat's easy stuff to do,\nit's not like, I need 17% of $273,412.\n\n251\n00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:47.661\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n252\n00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:49.803\nWhich would take forever, so,\nit's not normally crazy like that.\n\n253\n00:13:49.803 --> 00:13:52.330\nBut, the end result,\nis I now have my variance, and\n\n254\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.320\nI can go find the answer on\nthe exam that matches that.\n\n255\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.140\nAnd I'm in business, and\n\n256\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.820\nif I don't find an answer that matches\nthat then I probably have a formula wrong\n\n257\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.160\nand then you go back and revisit that.\n\n258\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.840\nSo, but that's how we can\nget that schedule variant.\n\n259\n00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.957\nJust know that even though it's\nan easy formula, SV = EV- PV,\n\n260\n00:14:06.957 --> 00:14:11.550\nthat it can be made more complex if we\nhave to calculate out our earn value and\n\n261\n00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:16.447\nour plan value, to find out what to\nfeed into the schedule variants formula.\n\n262\n00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.741\nAll right, now, in real life land,\nin real life land,\n\n263\n00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:23.990\nschedule variance is not\na very useful number, right?\n\n264\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.890\nIf your CEO comes to you and says, hey,\nwhat's the status on your project,\n\n265\n00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:28.710\nhow's it going so far?\n\n266\n00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.560\nAnd you say well, we're plus $1,000, or\n\n267\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.830\nwe're negative $1,000,\nwhat does that really mean to them?\n\n268\n00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.620\nOkay, well it can sound good or bad, it\ndepends on the size of the project and so\n\n269\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.940\non, but project numbers like these\ncan easily get skewed because\n\n270\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.280\nit's not necessarily meaningful\nbeyond project managers.\n\n271\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.700\nAnd so typically when we go to represent\nthese numbers to other people we don't use\n\n272\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.760\nschedule variance like this, instead\nwe use our performance indexes, right.\n\n273\n00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.864\nYou've got SPI and CPI,\nyour Schedule Performance Index and\n\n274\n00:14:59.864 --> 00:15:01.422\nyour Cost Performance Index.\n\n275\n00:15:01.422 --> 00:15:05.780\nAnd we're just talking about schedule in\nthis episode so I'm gonna talk about SPI.\n\n276\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.244\nSchedule Performance Index\nis really the same\n\n277\n00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:14.051\nbasic process except instead\nof SV=EV-PV it's SV=EV/PV.\n\n278\n00:15:14.051 --> 00:15:14.691\nOkay?\n\n279\n00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:17.412\nAnd the reason it does that,\nactually do I have a slide for that?\n\n280\n00:15:17.412 --> 00:15:18.132\nI do.\n\n281\n00:15:18.132 --> 00:15:20.200\nHere I'm talking about it,\nI've got a slide for it.\n\n282\n00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.890\nSo the reason it does this is that SPI is\n\n283\n00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.830\nfar better for giving people\nnumbers that are meaningful and\n\n284\n00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.710\nmaking it where you can compare\nprojects together, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.610\nSo SPI=EV/PV, if I'm on schedule,\n\n286\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:44.500\nif everything's going great,\nmy Ev and my PV should be equal.\n\n287\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.132\nAnd a number divided by itself is 1,\nso if I get an SPI of 1,\n\n288\n00:15:49.132 --> 00:15:53.419\nthat means I'm on schedule,\nthings are going great.\n\n289\n00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:56.569\nIf I get a number that's less\nthan 1 I'm behind schedule,\n\n290\n00:15:56.569 --> 00:16:00.168\nif it's a number that's greater than 1,\nI'm ahead of schedule.\n\n291\n00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.779\nAnd the number really works\nout to be a percentage.\n\n292\n00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:09.670\nAnd so if I get 1.2 as my result,\nthen I'm 20% ahead of schedule.\n\n293\n00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:15.710\nIf I get .8 as my result,\nthen I'm behind 20% on my schedule, right?\n\n294\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.930\nSo 1, that is on schedule,\nthat's your baseline.\n\n295\n00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:23.220\nAnd then anything above or below is that\npercentage that you are ahead or behind.\n\n296\n00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.630\nAnd that's really handy especially\nif you are like, a PMO.\n\n297\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.680\nIf you are a project management office and\nyou are measuring the performance of\n\n298\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.080\nmultiple projects on your portfolio,\nright?\n\n299\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.091\nYou might have a multi-million\ndollar project and\n\n300\n00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:38.620\nyou might have a $25,000 project.\n\n301\n00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.310\nAnd when you start looking at the schedule\nvariance, the multi-million dollar project\n\n302\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.740\nis always gonna look worse because\nthe number is so much bigger, right?\n\n303\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.740\nBut when you turn them into percentages\nlike this, now it's more in line, now we\n\n304\n00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.430\ncan compare them more accurately and\nunderstand what we're dealing with, right?\n\n305\n00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.100\nSo let me show you an example of that,\n\n306\n00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.770\nI've got a couple of\ndifferent examples actually.\n\n307\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.760\nSPI here, just your base SPI,\n\n308\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.230\nso they might throw on the exam a question\nthat just gives you the data you need,\n\n309\n00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.180\nyou factor it into the formula,\nwe kinda saw that earlier in the show.\n\n310\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.970\nSo here they tell us,\nyou have received a status report for\n\n311\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.440\nactivity 7.9 dated July 23rd.\n\n312\n00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.330\nSo the status report is dated July 23rd.\n\n313\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.790\nThe report indicates\nan earned value of $3,000.\n\n314\n00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.328\nAccording to the project plan,\nthe value should be $3,500.\n\n315\n00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:27.849\nWhat is your SPI?\n\n316\n00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:32.751\nAll right, we saw this same question\nearlier, except instead of asking for\n\n317\n00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:35.899\nSPI, it was asking for\nschedule variance, SV.\n\n318\n00:17:35.899 --> 00:17:39.657\nSo same thing here, except instead of\nasking for SV, they're asking for SPI,\n\n319\n00:17:39.657 --> 00:17:42.480\nand all we have to do is\nuse the alternate formula.\n\n320\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.880\nInstead of EV- PV, we use EV/PV.\n\n321\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.530\nSo for this one,\nwe say our SPI equals, and\n\n322\n00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:54.564\nit's going to be our earned value,\n$3,000, and\n\n323\n00:17:54.564 --> 00:17:58.935\nthat's gonna be divided by $3,500.\n\n324\n00:17:58.935 --> 00:18:03.438\nAnd then we need to figure\nout what that is and\n\n325\n00:18:03.438 --> 00:18:08.304\nin my head I don't know,\nbut if we fire up a quick\n\n326\n00:18:08.304 --> 00:18:14.030\ncalculator we can say\n3,000 divided by 3,500\n\n327\n00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:19.660\nIs 0.8571 so I'm gonna round that to 0.86.\n\n328\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.625\nOkay, 0.86 that's my SPI.\n\n329\n00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:27.660\nAlright, and remember what we said,\nif it's a negative, not a negative, sorry,\n\n330\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.980\nif it's below one, then we're behind,\nand if it's above one, then we're ahead.\n\n331\n00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.503\nAnd in this case I've got 0.86.\n\n332\n00:18:35.503 --> 00:18:36.820\nI've got an earned value of $3,000.\n\n333\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.317\nI was supposed to have earned $3,500.\n\n334\n00:18:39.317 --> 00:18:43.180\nI already knew I was behind,\nI just didn't know how bad.\n\n335\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.010\nLet's put it into perspective.\n\n336\n00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.480\nAnd if you tell me I'm $500 behind that\ndoesn't necessarily mean anything.\n\n337\n00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:55.540\nBut I can look at this and I can see\nthat 1 minus 0.86 would be .14, or 14%.\n\n338\n00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.305\nI'm 14% behind.\n\n339\n00:18:57.305 --> 00:18:58.530\nOkay now, how bad is that?\n\n340\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.390\nIs that really bad?\n\n341\n00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.800\nNot really, no.\n\n342\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.010\nI'm just 14% behind.\n\n343\n00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.910\nI can probably make that up, I probably\nhave resources I can apply to really get\n\n344\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.900\nthat corrected versus if I was 70% behind.\n\n345\n00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.245\nThat's pretty bad, that's pretty bad, and\n\n346\n00:19:10.245 --> 00:19:11.742\nwe're definitely going to\nneed to deal with that.\n\n347\n00:19:11.742 --> 00:19:16.371\nThis takes the size of the project out\nof the mix and that's really handy,\n\n348\n00:19:16.371 --> 00:19:18.180\nnot in a one-off like this.\n\n349\n00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.830\nAnd this might be useful for talking\nto a CEO and communicating with people,\n\n350\n00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:25.920\nright, but when we're comparing more\nthan one project to each other and\n\n351\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.320\nthe budgets vary widely,\nthis becomes really, really, handy, right?\n\n352\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.440\nAnd that's my next example,\nlet me show you guys this one.\n\n353\n00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.600\nSo let's say that you work for\na PMO, right?\n\n354\n00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.050\nSo you work in a project\nmanagement office, and\n\n355\n00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.940\nyou're looking at your project portfolio.\n\n356\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.930\nAnd so here it says,\n\n357\n00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:46.130\nyou've been brought in to salvage\nfour projects at risk of failure.\n\n358\n00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.640\nSo there are four projects\ngoing on in this company,\n\n359\n00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.710\nthey're all at risk of failure.\n\n360\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:54.360\nWhich of the four projects is in\nthe most need of attention, right?\n\n361\n00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.150\nSo, which one is your highest risk,\nbasically.\n\n362\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.340\nThey're all at risk, they're all behind,\nwhich one is the worst?\n\n363\n00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.350\nWell, when we look at this,\nit can be hard to tell.\n\n364\n00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:09.030\nIf I just look at variance, right,\nso here's project 1, 2, 3, and 4,\n\n365\n00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.210\nproject one has a planned\nvalue of $80,000.\n\n366\n00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.910\nProject 2, 25,500, project 3, 25,000,\nand project 4, 1.4 million, alright?\n\n367\n00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.850\nProjects 2 and\n3 are very close in budget, right?\n\n368\n00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:27.551\nSo they very closely match each other,\none's 25,000, one's 25,500.\n\n369\n00:20:27.551 --> 00:20:31.720\nAnd when I look at those earned values,\nI see a huge difference there.\n\n370\n00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.660\nAnd so if you give me the earned value,\nand one of them is $500 and\n\n371\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.418\nthe other one is $17,000, it's pretty\nobvious which one's at greater risk.\n\n372\n00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:43.410\nOkay, project 3 is at a greater\nrisk than project two because\n\n373\n00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.540\nthey have similar budgets.\n\n374\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.528\nBut when you skew the budgets,\nright, when I look at project 3 and\n\n375\n00:20:51.528 --> 00:20:57.010\nproject 4,\nproject 3 has a $17,000 variance.\n\n376\n00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:04.540\nProject 4 is a $200,000 variance, that's\nmore than all the other projects combined.\n\n377\n00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.200\nAnd so I might look at that and\nsay, shoot,\n\n378\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.860\nI need to tackle project 4 because\nits variance is actually bigger than\n\n379\n00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.500\nthe full budget of all three of the other\nprojects, number 4 is the highest risk.\n\n380\n00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.210\nI need to focus on that one, okay, but\n\n381\n00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.710\nthat can be misleading, because in\nthe general scheme of things $200,000\n\n382\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.420\nmight not be a lot when you're\ntalking about $1.4 million all right.\n\n383\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:34.660\nAnd that's where SPI really comes in,\nis that we can create a number that's far\n\n384\n00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.870\nmore reasonable, that's easier to\ncompare between these different systems,\n\n385\n00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.020\nto figure out which one is\nactually the worst off, okay?\n\n386\n00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.270\nSo SPI lets us do that.\n\n387\n00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.780\nAnd here we've got the earned value and\nplanned value.\n\n388\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.340\nWe just have to calculate it for\neach of these four\n\n389\n00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:53.130\nto find out which one actually has\nthe true worst schedule variance, alright?\n\n390\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.440\nSo let's run through that.\n\n391\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.928\nIf we take our earned value and\nour planned value,\n\n392\n00:21:56.928 --> 00:22:00.557\nI need to start with that $76,000 and\ndivide it by 84,000.\n\n393\n00:22:00.557 --> 00:22:07.061\nSo if I take 76,000 and\ndivide it by 84,000, I end up with 0.904.\n\n394\n00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:08.444\nSo I'll round that to 0.90.\n\n395\n00:22:08.444 --> 00:22:10.162\nSo I'm just gonna fill that in here.\n\n396\n00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:15.398\nAnd then we'll kind of move\ndown the line here and\n\n397\n00:22:15.398 --> 00:22:19.876\ngo to the next one which is 25,500.\n\n398\n00:22:19.876 --> 00:22:26.059\nSo we need to do 25,000 divided by 25,500,\n\n399\n00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:29.617\nand that's gonna be 0.98.\n\n400\n00:22:29.617 --> 00:22:30.939\n0.98.\n\n401\n00:22:30.939 --> 00:22:32.389\nAnd then we just keep going, and\n\n402\n00:22:32.389 --> 00:22:35.200\nall I'm doing is earned value\ndivided by plan value, right?\n\n403\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.450\nI'm applying the formula\nwe've got right here.\n\n404\n00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.377\nSo next is, this one's gonna be nice,\n8,000 divided by\n\n405\n00:22:42.377 --> 00:22:47.050\n25,000, which is 0.32, that's pretty bad.\n\n406\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:52.650\nAnd then our last one, which is gonna\nbe 1.2 million divided by 1.4 million.\n\n407\n00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:57.041\nAll right, and\nI'm gonna round that to 0.86.\n\n408\n00:22:59.862 --> 00:23:05.035\nOkay, so now when I start to\nlook at these It becomes pretty\n\n409\n00:23:05.035 --> 00:23:10.080\nobvious who's the real high risk project,\nokay?\n\n410\n00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.823\nWhen you're talking about .86 that's 14%.\n\n411\n00:23:14.823 --> 00:23:18.550\nWe're 14% behind where we need to be,\nalright?\n\n412\n00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.070\nThat's not an insurmountable obstacle.\n\n413\n00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.950\nThat's something that can be overcome.\n\n414\n00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.597\nWe probably have reserves, hopefully\nyou don't have 14% reserves cuz that's\n\n415\n00:23:26.597 --> 00:23:28.471\na little on the high side for\nreserves, but\n\n416\n00:23:28.471 --> 00:23:31.751\nyou've got things you can shift around,\npeople that you can put in place,\n\n417\n00:23:31.751 --> 00:23:35.050\nthat you've got the resources\navailable to try and overcome that.\n\n418\n00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.160\nIt's just 14%.\n\n419\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.638\nIt's bad, don't get me wrong,\nthat's bad, but it's not insurmountable.\n\n420\n00:23:41.638 --> 00:23:45.390\n0.98, that's only 2%, 2%, who cares?\n\n421\n00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.790\nThat's probably just normal\noperations right there.\n\n422\n00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.960\nSomething that should've happened\non Monday happened on Tuesday.\n\n423\n00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.560\nNext week, something that should've\nhappened on Tuesday happens on Monday and\n\n424\n00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.610\nit goes away, right?\n\n425\n00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.606\nYou might not even need\nto take action at 0.98.\n\n426\n00:23:56.606 --> 00:23:58.347\nYou can practically ignore that one.\n\n427\n00:23:58.347 --> 00:24:02.121\n0.90, 10%, that's not great.\n\n428\n00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:05.807\nThat's not something you want\nto brag about to the team, but\n\n429\n00:24:05.807 --> 00:24:07.841\nit's not that bad either right?\n\n430\n00:24:07.841 --> 00:24:10.341\n0.32, though, boy,\nthat one's off the rails.\n\n431\n00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:11.941\nThat's a project that\nneeds to be canceled.\n\n432\n00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:18.701\nIt would be really, really difficult\nto overcome being 68% behind.\n\n433\n00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:20.290\nThat's significant.\n\n434\n00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.440\nWe've got a $25,000 plan value at\nthis point, and we're only at $8,000.\n\n435\n00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.980\nDoes it mean that it's impossible\nto recover this project?\n\n436\n00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.970\nNo, you can still overcome it.\n\n437\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:30.630\nBut, it's so\n\n438\n00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:35.920\nfar behind that it is going to fail\nunless you take significant action.\n\n439\n00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.240\nAnd then what action is that going to be?\n\n440\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.190\nWell, it could be putting in\nchange tickets to just allow for\n\n441\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.650\na different completion date.\n\n442\n00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:47.030\nHey, we were planning on finishing January\n1st, let's go back to March 1st now.\n\n443\n00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.750\nSo you do a delayed rollout.\n\n444\n00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.170\nOr, you request more funds.\n\n445\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.840\nHey, I'm sorry the project went over.\n\n446\n00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.030\nCan we get some more funds associated with\nit and see if we can't overcome that?\n\n447\n00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.200\nOr, you just get down there and\nkick some butts, right?\n\n448\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.670\nMaybe there's work that's supposed to be\ngetting done that's not getting done and\n\n449\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.920\nyou get in there and correct it.\n\n450\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.740\nYou could salvage this project.\n\n451\n00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.190\nBut it needs to be your first priority,\nright?\n\n452\n00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:12.650\nGranted it's a lower amount of money that\nwe're talking about in project 4, but\n\n453\n00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:16.350\nit's in far worse shape,\nfar worse shape than the other one.\n\n454\n00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:20.020\nAnd SPI really makes it where\nwe can compare these guys,\n\n455\n00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.110\nwhere Schedule Variance\nis not easy to compare.\n\n456\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:26.320\nSchedule Variance is great for\njust looking at one project, but\n\n457\n00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.830\nwhen you're comparing multiple projects,\nSPI, Schedule Performance Index,\n\n458\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.440\nthat's the one that really works out.\n\n459\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.010\nAnd so on the exam when they ask for\nan SPI, they might ask for\n\n460\n00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.660\nit on a single project, but more\ncommonly it'll be something like this.\n\n461\n00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.880\nHere's four projects.\n\n462\n00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.170\nWhich is the one that's in the most risk?\n\n463\n00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.750\nAnd you've got to calculate\nthe SPI to figure that out.\n\n464\n00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.890\nAnd we just kinda run down the line.\n\n465\n00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.230\nIt's simple math.\n\n466\n00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.490\nThey could make it hard.\n\n467\n00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.730\nHere they gave me the EV and PV.\n\n468\n00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.010\nMaybe they don't give you that, right?\n\n469\n00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.746\nAnd now you've got to\ncalculate those out too, so\n\n470\n00:25:53.746 --> 00:25:56.370\nyou've got a little extra work\nthat's going to be before you.\n\n471\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.767\nBut otherwise you just kinda run\nthrough them, calculate it out, and\n\n472\n00:25:58.767 --> 00:26:00.600\nnow you've got your answer.\n\n473\n00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.250\nSo Schedule Performance Index definitely\none of the more useful ones out there\n\n474\n00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.820\nin the real world, too.\n\n475\n00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.750\n>> Don, is there anything\nelse we need to consider in\n\n476\n00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.840\nterms of the Schedule Performance Index,\nbesides just calculating that out?\n\n477\n00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.020\nI see where it actually is valuable when\nwe compare it against other projects, but\n\n478\n00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.690\nis there anything else that we\nneed to worry about on that one?\n\n479\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.100\n>> As far as the schedule side,\n\n480\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.820\nno, but keep in mind we haven't\ntalked about cost yet, right?\n\n481\n00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.532\nThe budgetary side.\n\n482\n00:26:23.532 --> 00:26:25.759\nWe're gonna do another episode where\nwe'll take a look at cost and budget.\n\n483\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.530\nThe hard part on the exam\nis they're easy to confuse.\n\n484\n00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.019\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right, the formulas are very,\n\n485\n00:26:31.019 --> 00:26:31.560\nvery similar.\n\n486\n00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.140\nThey use a lot of the same data.\n\n487\n00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.020\nYou end up with indexes that\nare effectively the same.\n\n488\n00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:41.010\nIt's really easy to confuse,\nso everything you just saw,\n\n489\n00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.080\nthat's pretty straightforward.\n\n490\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.080\nThere wasn't anything confusing there.\n\n491\n00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.720\nWhen we talk about cost, there really\nwon't be anything confusing there.\n\n492\n00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.280\nBut when you put the two together, that's\nwhen it starts getting a little messy.\n\n493\n00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.020\nSo make sure you take your time\nwhen you read the question.\n\n494\n00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.690\nMake sure you understand exactly\nwhat they're asking for.\n\n495\n00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.463\nAre they asking for\nthe Schedule Performance Index or\n\n496\n00:26:57.463 --> 00:26:59.300\nthe Cost Performance Index?\n\n497\n00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.410\nAre we calculating out our schedule\nvariants or our cost variants?\n\n498\n00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.110\nMake sure you're using the right ones and\n\n499\n00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.880\nthe right numbers, cuz sometimes they'll\ngive you all the information for both.\n\n500\n00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.390\nAnd then you've got to know which one\nit is that you're trying to work for.\n\n501\n00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.233\nAnd it's all right there in\nthe wording of the question.\n\n502\n00:27:13.233 --> 00:27:15.000\nJust take your time and read it.\n\n503\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.850\n>> So remember that what we actually\ntook a look at here is the idea of\n\n504\n00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.110\nthe schedule variance itself, and\nthe Schedule Performance Index, too.\n\n505\n00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.170\nAnd even those formulas are similar.\n\n506\n00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.850\nThe very fact that we are actually\nusing subtraction in one and\n\n507\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.930\ndivision in the other doesn't help.\n\n508\n00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.920\nSo you want to make sure that\nthose are locked into your mind\n\n509\n00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.440\nbefore you get ready for\nthat exam, as well.\n\n510\n00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.310\nThank you, Don, for showing us those\nexamples to help us to get ready for\n\n511\n00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.300\nthe exam.\n\n512\n00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.640\nThank you for also joining us.\n\n513\n00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.190\nThis is a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n514\n00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.000\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n515\n00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.720\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n516\n00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.964\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n517\n00:27:47.964 -->

Using the basic formula, Don shows how to determine what we’ve spent in comparison to what we expected to spend.  This will give us the Cost Variance. Along with the CV, they show how to get the CPI, the cost performance index too.  This is will help when we compare it against another part of the project to help us understand whether we’re over budget or under budget at that particular point in time.",

00:00:17.780\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.830\ntoday we're taking a look at the PMP,\nthe Project Management Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.420\nNow we're specifically\ndiving into a few formulas.\n\n6\n00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.760\nAnd today, we're taking a look\nat cost performance itself.\n\n7\n00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.040\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.230\nDon, how's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.340\n>> It is going great, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.570\nThanks for having me back on the show.\n\n11\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.160\nAnd we're continuing on with our\nformulas in action series, right?\n\n12\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.770\nGetting a chance to see these\nformulas as they're used and\n\n13\n00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.310\nsome of the types of things\nthat might pop up on the exam.\n\n14\n00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.480\nNow, in our last episode we took\na look at schedule variance, and\n\n15\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.690\nschedule variance is great.\n\n16\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.153\nIt's a wonderful way to be able to see\nwhether or not your project is going to be\n\n17\n00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:54.429\ncoming in ahead or behind schedule or\nhopefully on schedule.\n\n18\n00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.790\nBut, schedule variance is usually only\nimportant to project managers, right?\n\n19\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.930\nIt's really just something\nthat we care about.\n\n20\n00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.830\nIt's not something so\nmuch that other people care about.\n\n21\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.574\nThey just want to know that you're\ncoming in on schedule, right?\n\n22\n00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:08.520\nThey don't want you to be late, but\notherwise, they usually don't care.\n\n23\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.360\nCost variance, on the other hand, is\nsomething they absolutely do care about.\n\n24\n00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.010\nAnd so typically, when you're in a company\nand people are asking for the performance\n\n25\n00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.910\nof your project, they don't normally\nask about schedule variance.\n\n26\n00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.870\nThey normally ask about cost variance,\nwatching that budget.\n\n27\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.490\nThe deadline is still important,\nyou've gotta hit your deadline.\n\n28\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.980\nBut at the end of the day,\nmost companies fixate on the dollar bill,\n\n29\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.570\nthe amount of money that we're gonna\nspend to complete that project.\n\n30\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.330\nSo, we're gonna take the same concepts\nthat we saw with schedule variance, but\n\n31\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.000\nwe're going to apply it to cost variance.\n\n32\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.057\nAnd you'll see that the formulas\nare almost identical.\n\n33\n00:01:40.057 --> 00:01:44.345\nAnd when we did schedule variance,\nwe actually took cost into account.\n\n34\n00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:45.055\nThat's a part of it, right?\n\n35\n00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:47.265\nLet me bring some of\nthese formulas back up.\n\n36\n00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:51.385\nSo, we talked about variance, and how\nthat's just simply the difference between\n\n37\n00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:54.325\nwhat our plan was and\nwhat we're actually getting, right?\n\n38\n00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:58.525\nSo this little gap that gets created here,\nthat's our variance.\n\n39\n00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:00.275\nAnd when we measure variance,\n\n40\n00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:05.290\nwe're normally dealing with two concepts,\nplan value and earn value, right?\n\n41\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.160\nPlan value is the amount of work we expect\nto have been done at a certain point.\n\n42\n00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.240\nAnd it's normally phrased as\nthe amount of effort, right?\n\n43\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.240\nAnd why do they say effort?\n\n44\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.095\nWell, effort is usually that\ncombination of time and money, right?\n\n45\n00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:22.225\nI know that somebody's gotta do some work,\nand that person makes $15 an hour, and\n\n46\n00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.415\nthere's two hours of work.\n\n47\n00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:29.250\nThat's their effort, the two hours and the\n$15 kind of combine to form that effort.\n\n48\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.650\nAnd so when we talk about planned value,\nit's taking that budget at completion and\n\n49\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.860\nmultiplying it by planned work.\n\n50\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.161\nWe saw that back when we started\ntalking about earned value analysis, so\n\n51\n00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:39.920\nif you haven't watched that episode,\ndefinitely check it out.\n\n52\n00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.670\nBut it's a composite metric, right.\n\n53\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.658\nIt's combining money, or\nour budget, and our planned work,\n\n54\n00:02:45.658 --> 00:02:47.328\nwhich is labor or effort.\n\n55\n00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:51.110\nYou're kinda merging all that\ntogether to create this metric, and\n\n56\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.840\nearned value does the same thing, right?\n\n57\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.880\nOur planned value, which we already\nsaw brought in our budget, but\n\n58\n00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.150\nfactoring in the work.\n\n59\n00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.720\nAnd that's why it's not so good for\n\n60\n00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.740\ncost variance, because it's taking\ninto account things like the schedule.\n\n61\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.810\nAnd for schedule variance that's perfect,\nthat's what we wanted.\n\n62\n00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.350\nFor cost, it's not.\n\n63\n00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.100\nWhen we're dealing with cost,\nwe have different formulas.\n\n64\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.420\nAnd the formulas work to eliminate\nsome of that reliance on scheduling.\n\n65\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.428\nSo notice that cost variance is your\nearn value minus your actual cost.\n\n66\n00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:23.750\nAll right, not earned value\nminus planned value, right?\n\n67\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.240\nMy planned value is that\namount of effort and\n\n68\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.960\ncost that I expected to\nincur by a certain point.\n\n69\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.110\nHere it's just the actual\nstraight up cost.\n\n70\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.670\nHow many dollars have I spent?\n\n71\n00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.430\nThat's what I want to know, right?\n\n72\n00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.260\nI don't really care what percentage\nis complete or whatever.\n\n73\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.820\nI just need to know the raw dollars and\ncents.\n\n74\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.550\nSo, cost variance is really no different\nthan scheduled variance, except that we\n\n75\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.880\ndrop some of reliance on time, and\nwe put the reliance on the actual money.\n\n76\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.610\nNow, notice we are still using earn value.\n\n77\n00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.040\nAnd that means we do still care\nabout time, because earn value,\n\n78\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.640\nas I just showed you back here,\nis your planned\n\n79\n00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.830\nvalue is our budget at complete times,\nour planned work.\n\n80\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.720\nSo that amount of work,\nthat time is still in there, right?\n\n81\n00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.000\nBut the reliance on it is reduced as\nwe focus strictly on that dollar,\n\n82\n00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.400\nthat actual cost, which is a pretty\nimportant piece, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.130\nNow the trickiest thing to remember for\nthe exam when it comes to cost variance\n\n84\n00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.010\nis that the result is a little bit weird,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.140\nWhen we talk about schedule variance,\n\n86\n00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.700\nschedule variance you get a result\nback and hopefully it's zero.\n\n87\n00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.730\nYou want your earned value and\nyour planned value to be equal, and\n\n88\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.080\nyou get a zero back.\n\n89\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.130\nAnd if it's a higher number, like\na positive number or a negative number,\n\n90\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.510\nyou get different results.\n\n91\n00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.340\nAnd so we've gotta remember that, there's\nsomething you have to memorize here.\n\n92\n00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.040\nWith cost variance,\nif we get a number that is less than zero,\n\n93\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.110\nif it's less than zero,\nwe're actually over budget.\n\n94\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.480\nAnd if it's greater than zero,\nwe're under budget.\n\n95\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.550\nIt's kind of the opposite\nof what you'd think.\n\n96\n00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.270\nIf we had a greater number for schedule,\nwe'd actually be ahead of schedule.\n\n97\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.760\nOr a lesser number than zero, a negative\nnumber, then we'd be behind schedule.\n\n98\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.830\nBut in cost, it's the exact opposite.\n\n99\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.790\nSo memorize that.\n\n100\n00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.020\nDon't get confused.\n\n101\n00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.360\nDon't go in there and\ncalculate out a cost variance, and\n\n102\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.910\nthen assume that you're under budget\nwhen you're actually over budget.\n\n103\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.470\nBecause you just mixed up which one was\npositive and which one was negative.\n\n104\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.220\nSo, if I get a negative result,\nI'm actually over budget.\n\n105\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.940\nAnd the way I remember it, is what happens\nif you spend more money than you have?\n\n106\n00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.900\nYou go into the red.\n\n107\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.650\nYou go into the negative.\n\n108\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.760\nYou now have negative money.\n\n109\n00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.720\nYou spent more than you had and\nso that's how I remember this.\n\n110\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.290\nIf I have a negative number,\nit's like I spent more than I had, and so\n\n111\n00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.610\nI'm over budget.\n\n112\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.700\nBut if I have a positive number, right?\n\n113\n00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.160\nI haven't spend all my money yet.\n\n114\n00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.760\nI still have a positive number,\nand so I'm under budget.\n\n115\n00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.940\nThat's the kinda pneumonic\nI use to remember that.\n\n116\n00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.800\nSo the formula is pretty simple, and\nwe apply it just like schedule variance.\n\n117\n00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.880\nSo, here I've got an example kind of\nlike what you might see on the exam, and\n\n118\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.440\nthis would be one of\nthe simpler forms of it.\n\n119\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.570\nNow in typical PMI fashion here,\n\n120\n00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.260\nI've given us a lot of\ninformation in the question.\n\n121\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.820\nSome of it we need,\nsome of it we don't need.\n\n122\n00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.310\nSome of it will be very clear and\ntell us what our earned value is.\n\n123\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.020\nOther times we might have to\ncalculate our earned value.\n\n124\n00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.840\nSometimes they might tell us\nwhat our actual cost is, or\n\n125\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.230\nthey might give us several costs, and\n\n126\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.900\nwe have to add them up,\ncreate a sum to get that.\n\n127\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.000\nSo, as we read through this, we need to\nbe thinking about the data we get and\n\n128\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.200\nwhat's important.\n\n129\n00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.415\nWe've got this one here.\n\n130\n00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:23.559\nYou have received a status report for\nactivity 4.9, dated August 1st.\n\n131\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.240\nTechnically, that first sentence doesn't\nreally give me anything that matters as\n\n132\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.620\nfar as cost, cuz remember cost doesn't\nnecessarily care about the dates.\n\n133\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.480\nWe care about the actual\nmoney we've spent.\n\n134\n00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.960\nBut if I have expense reports leading\nall the way up and beyond the 1st,\n\n135\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.953\nI need to know to stop at August 1st,\nright?\n\n136\n00:06:37.953 --> 00:06:39.820\nCuz that's where my status report is.\n\n137\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.580\nThe report indicates\nan earned value of $3,000.\n\n138\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.130\nThe accounting department reports show\nthat $2,500 in expenses have been\n\n139\n00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.940\nassociated with the account code for\nthat activity, as of August 1st.\n\n140\n00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.910\nWhat is your cost variance?\n\n141\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.710\nWell, they've given us\neverything we need to know.\n\n142\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.620\nMy earned value's $3,000.\n\n143\n00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.310\nThey've already told me that.\n\n144\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.311\nBut accounting tells me my\nactual cost has only been $2500.\n\n145\n00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:04.611\nNow how can that be, right?\n\n146\n00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:08.420\nHow can it be that my actual cost\nis less than my earned value?\n\n147\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.280\nWell, earned value is taking into account\nthe amount of work that's been done.\n\n148\n00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.490\nAnd so one or\ntwo things have happened here.\n\n149\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.180\nWell, I guess there's a third possibility.\n\n150\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.600\nThe third possibility is that\nmy numbers are wrong, right?\n\n151\n00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.050\nIt could be the status report is wrong and\nthat's it, and that explains all this.\n\n152\n00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.250\nBut assuming these numbers are right,\nit usually means one of two things.\n\n153\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.870\nIt either means one,\npeople got a lot more work done\n\n154\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.570\nfaster than they said they\nwere gonna get it done, right?\n\n155\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.870\nLet's say it was painting a house, and\n\n156\n00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.860\nthey told me it was gonna take\ntwo people three days to do it.\n\n157\n00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.850\nBut it turns out that the two people\nactually got it done in two days, right?\n\n158\n00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.870\nIf I pay them hourly, my cost for\nthem is gonna be the same.\n\n159\n00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.880\nThey just got it done faster, right?\n\n160\n00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.150\nBut they got more work done.\n\n161\n00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.839\nThey got 100% of the work\ndone a day early, and\n\n162\n00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:56.757\nthat can make your earned value go\nup above what you've actually spent.\n\n163\n00:07:56.757 --> 00:08:00.450\nDoesn't mean that we won't spend\nthe remainder for that third day.\n\n164\n00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.201\nMaybe they still expect me paid\neven though they're already done.\n\n165\n00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:05.560\nAnd so, this evens out it's\nall gone by that point.\n\n166\n00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.210\nBut on day two of that we would\nactually be offset like this.\n\n167\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:15.230\nThe other possibility is maybe\nwe just haven't paid for it yet.\n\n168\n00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.530\nMaybe they did $3,000 worth of work, and\nwe just haven't paid the remaining 500.\n\n169\n00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.510\nSo I've got an accounting discrepancy.\n\n170\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.520\nBut either way,\nthere's something that needs to be done.\n\n171\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.010\nI need to go and find out why\nthese numbers don't match up, and\n\n172\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.320\ntake action if necessary or\ndon't take action, if that's the course.\n\n173\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:38.630\nSo to solve this though, I just come in my\nsalary on my CV =, and what is it equal?\n\n174\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:45.726\nWell, it equals my earned value which\nis $3,000 minus my actual cost,\n\n175\n00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:52.280\nwhich is $2,500, and so\nmy cost variance is simply $500.\n\n176\n00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.450\nThere we go.\nWe've got a $500 plus variance.\n\n177\n00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.860\nPretty straightforward.\n\n178\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.520\nAnd that number is a positive number,\nand so\n\n179\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.680\nI end up with something greater than zero,\nand so I'm under budget.\n\n180\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.691\nI'm under budget because I've\nspent less than my earned value.\n\n181\n00:09:08.691 --> 00:09:11.900\nNot necessarily a good thing,\nnot necessarily a bad thing.\n\n182\n00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.730\nI need to find out why.\n\n183\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.930\nI wanted it to be zero.\n\n184\n00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.840\nI wanted it to be where I spent\nexactly what I've earned,\n\n185\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.630\nnow everything's right on course.\n\n186\n00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.090\nSo pretty straightforward.\n\n187\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.050\nIt can get a little harder though,\nif we use like example number two here.\n\n188\n00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.883\nSo what example number 2 is telling me,\nI've got work breakdown structure task\n\n189\n00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:34.670\n2.8 we've spent $10,000,\nand we're 25% complete.\n\n190\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.930\nThat sentence by itself doesn't really\nhelp me so I need more information.\n\n191\n00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.350\nIt says the project plan shows\nthat $10,000 is correct for\n\n192\n00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.180\nthe planning period.\n\n193\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.270\nWe expected to spend\n$10,000 by that period, but\n\n194\n00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.340\nthe task should be 50% complete.\n\n195\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.070\nWhat is my cost variance?\n\n196\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.990\nSo now this is an interesting one,\nbecause on a strictly cost basis I've\n\n197\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.115\nspent 10,000,\nI had planned to spend 10,000.\n\n198\n00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:00.190\nIt looks like things are great.\n\n199\n00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.070\nMy cost variance is zero.\n\n200\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.590\nBut we have to remember that the cost\nvariance formula uses earned value,\n\n201\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.580\nuses EV.\n\n202\n00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.350\nAnd earned value does pay attention\nto the percentage complete.\n\n203\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:17.820\nI expect it to be 50% but\nI'm actually only 25% done.\n\n204\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.090\nSo my earned value is not going\nto be where it needs to be when I\n\n205\n00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.800\ncalculate that out.\n\n206\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.736\nSo my planned value if we go back and\nlook at those formulas,\n\n207\n00:10:26.736 --> 00:10:28.946\nlet's hover at this the long way.\n\n208\n00:10:28.946 --> 00:10:31.500\nThis is gonna be a long formula cuz\nwe have to calculate everything out.\n\n209\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.911\nSo CV = i.e.\n\n210\n00:10:33.911 --> 00:10:35.590\nMy earned value.\n\n211\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.510\nAnd what is earn value?\n\n212\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:43.980\nIt's my budget completion, I'm sorry,\nI'm gonna screw this one up aren't I.\n\n213\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.670\nMy earn value is my plan value\ntimes percentage complete.\n\n214\n00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.230\nThere we go.\n\n215\n00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.590\nIt's important we get these right.\n\n216\n00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.950\nSo it's my PV times my %Complete.\n\n217\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.060\nOkay.\nWell, my planned value, I know that,\n\n218\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.480\nmy planned value is $10,000.\n\n219\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.027\nI expected to spend $10,000 by this point.\n\n220\n00:11:00.027 --> 00:11:05.073\nAnd I would multiply that by my\npercentage complete, which is 25%.\n\n221\n00:11:05.073 --> 00:11:10.902\nAnd then, I need to subtract out my\nactual cost which my actual cost is,\n\n222\n00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:13.049\nwell, $10,000.\n\n223\n00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:15.300\nSo I know my actual cost is 10,000.\n\n224\n00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.530\nBut because we're taking this 10,000\nover here and multiplying it by 25%,\n\n225\n00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.570\nI am gonna have that little problem.\n\n226\n00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.330\nNow, my actual cost,\nI'm gonna introduce an issue here, too.\n\n227\n00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.086\nIf we look at this formula,\n10,000 * 25% is gonna be what?\n\n228\n00:11:28.086 --> 00:11:33.270\nIt's gonna be $2,500, and if I take 2,500\nand I subtract 10,000 it's gonna show\n\n229\n00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.550\nme a huge cost variance, and the reason\nis, I'm doing my actual costs and\n\n230\n00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.580\nI've got this where I'm factoring\nin that we're 50% complete.\n\n231\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.810\nWhat I really should do here is instead\nuse schedule variance to get a true\n\n232\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.680\nnumber, my cost variance is gonna show\nsomething wildly offset, and this can\n\n233\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.990\nhappen when your earned value is not\naccurate, it can get very, very far off.\n\n234\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.640\nBut to put it in perspective I might\nneed to factor in my schedule variance\n\n235\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.160\nto figure this out.\n\n236\n00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.640\nCuz schedule variance would\nuse my planned value here.\n\n237\n00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.288\nAnd planned value would\nbe 10,000 times 50%.\n\n238\n00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:03.970\nAnd now the numbers would\nbe a lot more in line.\n\n239\n00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.230\nI'm still gonna have a huge discrepancy.\n\n240\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:11.934\nSo when I run this formula right here,\nmy CV is gonna end up equalling,\n\n241\n00:12:11.934 --> 00:12:17.461\nwell, $2,500- $10,000, which is $7,500.\n\n242\n00:12:17.461 --> 00:12:21.710\nIt's actually a -$7,500 so\nI stick that in parentheses.\n\n243\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.140\nSo I've got a negative number.\n\n244\n00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.550\nNow, that negative number is letting\nme know that I've spent too much,\n\n245\n00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.990\nand if we,\napparently it does not want me to change.\n\n246\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.060\nI was gonna make it red so I could be\nall like an accounting professional.\n\n247\n00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.110\nBut it doesn't let me do that.\n\n248\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.710\nSo anyhow, so\nthat 7,500 is a negative number,\n\n249\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.210\nI guess I could stick a minus on it\nbefore it stop being all accounting like.\n\n250\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.210\nThere we go.\n\n251\n00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.994\nIt tells me I spent more than I have but\nI know that's not necessarily true.\n\n252\n00:12:49.994 --> 00:12:50.853\nI've spent 10,000.\n\n253\n00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.410\nI had 10,000.\n\n254\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.300\nBut I got less work than\nI was supposed to get.\n\n255\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.710\nI only had 25% of the work.\n\n256\n00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.100\nI didn't get 50% of the work\nlike I was supposed to get.\n\n257\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.170\nSo that's where that offset is and\nthis number is pretty bad.\n\n258\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.150\nSo what I would do if I got this in\nreal life plan is I would say, wow,\n\n259\n00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.350\nthe number was really bad.\n\n260\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.830\nLet me read my schedule variants and\ncompare to that.\n\n261\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.449\nBecause if you do the schedule\nof variants, this changes.\n\n262\n00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:18.394\nThis becomes SV=($10,000\n\n263\n00:13:18.394 --> 00:13:26.015\n* 25%)- 10,000 * 50%.\n\n264\n00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:30.160\nMy earned value versus my planned value.\n\n265\n00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.455\nWith SV we do the planned value, and\nthat number is gonna end up a little bit\n\n266\n00:13:34.455 --> 00:13:39.193\ndifferent because now we're\ntalking about $2,500 minus $5,000.\n\n267\n00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:41.782\nAnd so, you still end up\nwith a pretty big disparity.\n\n268\n00:13:41.782 --> 00:13:44.020\nWe still end up with a negative $5,000.\n\n269\n00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.520\nWhich let's us know we've\ngot a real problem.\n\n270\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.491\nI'm probably gonna run out of room here.\n\n271\n00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:50.407\n>> $2,500 wasn't it?\n\n272\n00:13:50.407 --> 00:13:51.023\n>> You're right.\n\n273\n00:13:51.023 --> 00:13:51.563\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n274\n00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:52.261\n>> Okay.\n\n275\n00:13:52.261 --> 00:13:53.863\n>> Good thing I've got you around here.\n\n276\n00:13:53.863 --> 00:14:00.160\nSo it would be $2,500 minus $5,000 so\nyou end up with a -$2,500.\n\n277\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.310\nWhich is gonna screen wrap a little weird\nhere for me cuz I'm just out of room.\n\n278\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.526\nBut, there we go.\n\n279\n00:14:07.526 --> 00:14:08.810\nSo we end up with that\nschedule of variance.\n\n280\n00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.850\nIt's a little bit more\nreasonable at this point.\n\n281\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.960\nI mean, we're still off by a good chunk,\n\n282\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.010\nbut it's a little bit\nmore reasonable a number.\n\n283\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.510\nThe CV, in this case,\njust told me there was a problem.\n\n284\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.120\nAnd I could use that then go and\ndo additional research.\n\n285\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.548\nBut the true answer to this one\nwould actually be that- $7,500.\n\n286\n00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:27.056\nAnd it seems like a big difference, but\n\n287\n00:14:27.056 --> 00:14:29.810\nit's because it's not taking into\naccount the schedule and the time.\n\n288\n00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.210\nIt's just focusing in on\nthe actual cost to that point.\n\n289\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.528\n>> All right, now Don, you just\ndid something that I think I would\n\n290\n00:14:37.528 --> 00:14:40.723\ndo on the exam is chase\ndown imaginary things.\n\n291\n00:14:40.723 --> 00:14:43.634\nIf you're given a question like this,\nwould that be a possibility or\n\n292\n00:14:43.634 --> 00:14:46.100\nshould I just stick with\nthe numbers that I see?\n\n293\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.350\n>> Answer the question that's asked.\n\n294\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.020\n>> Okay.\n>> Right?\n\n295\n00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.232\nSo they asked me what's my cost variance.\n\n296\n00:14:50.232 --> 00:14:52.310\nThey didn't ask me what\nthe schedule variance was.\n\n297\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.220\nI did that cuz I wanted to show you\nguys how this gets used in real life,\n\n298\n00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.360\nformulas in action.\n\n299\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.699\nBut on the exam,\nanswer the question they ask.\n\n300\n00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:02.016\nThey'll give you more information than you\nneed and you can do exactly what Ronnie\n\n301\n00:15:02.016 --> 00:15:03.910\nsaid, you can chase that rabbit hole-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.480\n>> And just start going through and\n\n303\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.670\ncalculating all sorts of great stuff.\n\n304\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.850\nAt the end of the day,\nyou're just wasting time, though,\n\n305\n00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.870\nbecause you need to get\nto that next question.\n\n306\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.530\nThey asked me for my cost variance, I got\na simple formula, I got it right here.\n\n307\n00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.880\nBut not ask me to interpret it.\n\n308\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.140\nWe just provide the value and move on.\n\n309\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.192\nNow, cost variance can end up with really\nwhacked out numbers like these sometimes\n\n310\n00:15:23.192 --> 00:15:25.300\nand it's hard to put them in perspective.\n\n311\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.030\nAnd it's really challenging especially\nwhen you're dealing with a CEO or\n\n312\n00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.170\nsomebody like that because\nwhen they hear -7,500 they\n\n313\n00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.645\nthink that we're in the black or\nin the red.\n\n314\n00:15:35.645 --> 00:15:38.266\n$7,500 which truly we aren't.\n\n315\n00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:42.370\nWe spent 10,000, we had planned on\nspending 10,000, so technically we're\n\n316\n00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.280\nfinancially where we're supposed to be but\nwe're behind schedule is what's happening.\n\n317\n00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.231\nOnly 25% of the work is done instead\nof 50% so we're behind schedule.\n\n318\n00:15:50.231 --> 00:15:53.698\nThat means that while we aren't\nnecessarily in the hole of\n\n319\n00:15:53.698 --> 00:15:55.829\n7,500 right now, we will be.\n\n320\n00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:59.584\nIf we keep moving at this rate Its gonna\ntake longer to get things done and\n\n321\n00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:04.042\nwe will have that, so this is almost like\nforecasting in a way then we'll have that.\n\n322\n00:16:04.042 --> 00:16:08.726\nBut this is not necessarily the greatest\nway to represent this to a CEO.\n\n323\n00:16:08.726 --> 00:16:12.558\nAnd so with scheduling I showed\nyou guys how we have SPI, right?\n\n324\n00:16:12.558 --> 00:16:17.088\nSo you have SV for schedule variance,\nSPI for schedule performance index,\n\n325\n00:16:17.088 --> 00:16:21.490\nwith CV or clause variance we have\nthe CPI or cost performance index.\n\n326\n00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.790\nAnd it's the same basic concept.\n\n327\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:30.170\nInstead of earned value minus actual cost,\nit's earned value divided by actual cost.\n\n328\n00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.690\nAnd by dividing it we end up with\na number that makes it really\n\n329\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.020\neasy to compare projects together.\n\n330\n00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.100\nSo if I've got ten projects and I wanna\ncompare all of their cost variance to see\n\n331\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.510\nwhich one's in the most risk, I can do\nthat easily with a performance index.\n\n332\n00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.120\nAnd so, this is a great alternative to\nuse and it's one that I use all the time.\n\n333\n00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.080\nMost project management software\nwill calculate this for you and\n\n334\n00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.830\nit's no big deal.\n\n335\n00:16:52.842 --> 00:16:57.070\nAll right, so if I take a look\nat CPI equals EV divided by AC.\n\n336\n00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.666\nThe formula is just division\ninstead of subtraction, so\n\n337\n00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:00.970\nwe can jump into an example.\n\n338\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.200\nAnd as long as you get the information\nwe need, we can solve it pretty quick.\n\n339\n00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.220\nRight, so this one is that we've\nreceived a status report for\n\n340\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.140\nactivity 1.11 dated May 9.\n\n341\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.322\nThe report indicates\nan earned value of $3,000.\n\n342\n00:17:13.322 --> 00:17:18.141\nYour project plan indicates that you\nshould have spent $3,500 by that date.\n\n343\n00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:24.220\nAnd accounting confirms that\n$3,500 has indeed been paid out.\n\n344\n00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.670\nWhat is your CPI?\n\n345\n00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.771\nSo we planned on spending $3,000,\nwe've actually spent $3,500.\n\n346\n00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:32.403\nSo I don't even have to do math, I don't\neven have to be a wizard here to know that\n\n347\n00:17:32.403 --> 00:17:34.350\nI've spent more than I should have.\n\n348\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.920\nRight?\nThat we're over budget.\n\n349\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.410\nBut, we want to have this in\na number that's easy to compare.\n\n350\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.500\nSo I know that I'm over budget $500.\n\n351\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.990\nRight, I've spent $500 more than I should,\ndidn't have to know a formula for that.\n\n352\n00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.998\nWe spent more than we planned.\n\n353\n00:17:49.998 --> 00:17:52.878\nBut if it's $500 in\nthe general scheme of things,\n\n354\n00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:56.519\nwhat does that mean to this project\nin comparison to other projects?\n\n355\n00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:58.580\nIs $500 a lot of money or a little?\n\n356\n00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:05.920\nWell, if this is a $1000 project, $500 is\n50% of my budget, that's a huge offset.\n\n357\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.360\nRight?\nThat's a big deal, that's a problem.\n\n358\n00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:15.880\nBut if this is a $10 million project and\nI'm off by $500, that's hardly anything.\n\n359\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.450\nAnd so when you calculate your CV,\nyour cost variance,\n\n360\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.370\nit doesn't help you interpret that, how\nbad is this in comparison to the project?\n\n361\n00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.980\nCPI will.\n\n362\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.160\nSo a CPI, we just plug in\nthe values we've been given.\n\n363\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.300\nSo CPI equals earned value,\nwhich they told me was $3,000.\n\n364\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:37.872\nAnd then we divide that by our actual cost\nwhich accounting told me that was $3,500.\n\n365\n00:18:37.872 --> 00:18:42.130\nNow notice how they gave me my plan.\n\n366\n00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.120\nIt says your project plan indicates\nyou should have spent 3,500 and\n\n367\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.200\nthat we actually have.\n\n368\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.890\nDo I care what the project plan says here?\n\n369\n00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:50.640\nI don't.\n\n370\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.790\nRight?\nThe earned value does,\n\n371\n00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.370\nthe earned value cares about the plan.\n\n372\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.900\nBut as far as this formula here,\nif they've given me my earned value, this\n\n373\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.410\nextra bit of information is just useless\nfluff that I kind of ignore because\n\n374\n00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.140\nthe actual cost, what the accounting\ndepartment says, that's what I care about.\n\n375\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.559\nAnd so now I just divide that out, right?\n\n376\n00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:07.824\n3,000 divided by 3,500.\n\n377\n00:19:07.824 --> 00:19:09.400\nSo, I'll take good old 3,000.\n\n378\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.330\nWe'll divide that by 3,500.\n\n379\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.970\nAnd I end up with 0.857,\nwhich I'll round up to 0.86.\n\n380\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.788\n0.86, there we go.\n\n381\n00:19:19.788 --> 00:19:23.020\nAnd so now,\nI've got my cost performance syntax.\n\n382\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.910\nNow if we jump back over to my CPI slide\nhere, and kind of zoom in on the results.\n\n383\n00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.860\nWe can interpret what we got.\n\n384\n00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.260\nAnd you'll see if I have less than 1,\nI'm over budget.\n\n385\n00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.150\n1 is on budget.\n\n386\n00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.810\n> 1 is under budget.\n\n387\n00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:36.600\nIn my case, what did I get?\n\n388\n00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.883\nWell, I got 0.86.\n\n389\n00:19:37.883 --> 00:19:40.540\nAnd 0.86 is < 1.\n\n390\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.130\nI'm over budget.\n\n391\n00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.270\nAnd not only am I over budget,\nI can kind of take this.\n\n392\n00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.920\nIt really works on a percentage,\nso I'm actually 14% over budget.\n\n393\n00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.790\nSo if we wanna interpret it that way,\n\n394\n00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.490\nI can see the extent to which\nI'm over budget on my project.\n\n395\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.756\nSo, this is a great indicator and it's\neven better because I can take this number\n\n396\n00:19:59.756 --> 00:20:03.833\nand compare it to other projects, which\nis how you're more likely to see it on\n\n397\n00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:06.610\nthe exam and\nthat's my second example here.\n\n398\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.280\nIs we've been brought into salvage\n\n399\n00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.240\nfour projects that are currently\nat risk of failure.\n\n400\n00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.170\nWhich of the four projects is\nin the most need of attention?\n\n401\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:19.120\nAnd they're giving me me the earned\nvalues and the actual cost-to-date.\n\n402\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.680\nNow I can calculate out the cost variance,\nif I want.\n\n403\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:28.380\nOr I can just skip that and go right\nto my CPI and calculate out the CPI.\n\n404\n00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.850\nIf I do that, this CPI's really\neasy to compare between these.\n\n405\n00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:37.190\nThe cost variance is harder to compare,\nbut let's do both for completeness here.\n\n406\n00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.310\nMy first one I've got an earned value\nof $85,000, an actual cost of $84,500.\n\n407\n00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:47.744\nMy CV is just EV- AC, so I can see\non this one my CV is going to be,\n\n408\n00:20:47.744 --> 00:20:50.116\nwhat are we talking about.\n\n409\n00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:50.755\n500 bucks.\nRight?\n\n410\n00:20:50.755 --> 00:20:55.250\n$500, and apparently it's in red for\nsome reason.\n\n411\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.510\nSo $500.\n\n412\n00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.900\nIf I look at my next one, you know what?\n\n413\n00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.205\nThis actually needs to be white, because.\n\n414\n00:21:01.205 --> 00:21:05.499\n[SOUND] There we go, there we go,\nbecause this is a positive number.\n\n415\n00:21:05.499 --> 00:21:08.985\nMy actual cost is lower than my earned\nvalue, so I'm doing well there,\n\n416\n00:21:08.985 --> 00:21:10.466\nI'm actually under budget.\n\n417\n00:21:10.466 --> 00:21:14.520\nThis one, $1.8 million minus my\nactual cost, $1.5 million, so\n\n418\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.220\njust like the one above,\nI'm actually under budget on this one.\n\n419\n00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.910\nI've apparently got several of\nthese that are under budget.\n\n420\n00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.394\nThis one's gonna be under budget $300,000,\nright?\n\n421\n00:21:22.394 --> 00:21:28.750\nWhich again let me make that white instead\nof red because we're not in the red.\n\n422\n00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.540\nAll right.\n\n423\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.764\nBut this next one is the first one that\nI have that is gonna go negative, right?\n\n424\n00:21:32.764 --> 00:21:36.454\n$17,000, my actual cost is $25,000 so\n\n425\n00:21:36.454 --> 00:21:40.556\nI've got a $8,000 dollar\ndiscrepancy between them.\n\n426\n00:21:40.556 --> 00:21:45.564\nAnd so this one is going to be $8,000,\nright, negative.\n\n427\n00:21:45.564 --> 00:21:49.790\nAnd then this last one 2.2 million,\nmy actually cost 2.3 million, and so\n\n428\n00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.771\nI've got a $100,000\ndiscrepancy on that one.\n\n429\n00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:56.882\nAll right, now as I look at these when I\nstart thinking about ones that are a risk\n\n430\n00:21:56.882 --> 00:22:00.930\nof failure, when I see $500, I don't\nthink of that being a lot of money,\n\n431\n00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.520\nespecially when the budget is $84,500.\n\n432\n00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.867\nIt just doesn't seem that significant.\n\n433\n00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:10.614\n$300,000, though,\nthat sounds pretty darn significant.\n\n434\n00:22:10.614 --> 00:22:12.565\n$100,000, pretty significant.\n\n435\n00:22:12.565 --> 00:22:15.520\n$8,000, well, it depends.\n\n436\n00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.555\nIf it was a $2.3 million project,\n$8,000 is not that big of a deal.\n\n437\n00:22:19.555 --> 00:22:24.530\nBut $8,000 on a $25,000 project,\nthat can be a big deal.\n\n438\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.928\nAnd so I need a better way to compare\nthese to figure out which one is most at\n\n439\n00:22:27.928 --> 00:22:29.842\nrisk because it's kind of hard to tell.\n\n440\n00:22:29.842 --> 00:22:32.526\nAnd I know what you're thinking,\nthis guy's $300,000 under budget,\n\n441\n00:22:32.526 --> 00:22:33.720\nhow is that at risk?\n\n442\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.940\nWell, to have a discrepancy that big,\n$300,000,\n\n443\n00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:42.582\nthat more than likely means there is\na lot of work that has not been done.\n\n444\n00:22:42.582 --> 00:22:45.490\nWork thatwas supposed to have been done,\nsupposed to be built, but hasn't been, or\n\n445\n00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.890\nmaybe it means we aren't\npaying our contractors.\n\n446\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.190\nAnd so now our contractors are gonna walk,\n\n447\n00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.210\nthey're not gonna do anymore work\nbecause they haven't gotten paid.\n\n448\n00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.720\nAnd we need to find out what that\nproblem is and get it solved.\n\n449\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.540\nAn overage is not\nnecessarily a good thing.\n\n450\n00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:05.861\nSo if I calculate my CPI I can really\nfigure this out a little bit better.\n\n451\n00:23:05.861 --> 00:23:11.405\nAnd so if I start with this $85,000 and\ndivide it by $84,500.\n\n452\n00:23:11.405 --> 00:23:15.311\nSo 85,000 divided by\n84,500 that is a 1.005, so\n\n453\n00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:20.490\nI'm gonna round that up to 1.01 right, and\nI use just the standard rounding rules.\n\n454\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.020\nIf that last decimal place is a 5 or\na higher, I go up.\n\n455\n00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.430\nIf it's a 4 or lower, I go down.\n\n456\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:31.120\nAnd then we've got 1.8\nmillion versus 1.5 million.\n\n457\n00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.270\nSo I'll take $1.8 million and\ndivide that by $1.5 million.\n\n458\n00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:38.560\nAnd I get a 1.2, right?\n\n459\n00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.744\nNice big overage there, so\nwe're under budget on those guys,\n\n460\n00:23:44.744 --> 00:23:47.410\nor these numbers that are over 1.\n\n461\n00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.244\nAnd then we start to get to our negatives,\nright?\n\n462\n00:23:51.244 --> 00:23:53.961\nSo 17,000 divided by 25,000 is 0.68.\n\n463\n00:23:53.961 --> 00:24:00.945\nAnd then my last one,\n2.2 million versus 2.3 million and\n\n464\n00:24:00.945 --> 00:24:05.571\nwe divide that out, and it's 0.96.\n\n465\n00:24:08.304 --> 00:24:09.624\nOkay, whoops.\n\n466\n00:24:09.624 --> 00:24:11.062\nZero, slash, I don't know.\n\n467\n00:24:11.062 --> 00:24:12.662\nWe'll make all new numbering systems.\n\n468\n00:24:12.662 --> 00:24:13.642\nThere!\n\n469\n00:24:13.642 --> 00:24:15.182\nNow, I've got my CPIs.\n\n470\n00:24:15.182 --> 00:24:18.280\nAnd what my CPIs do is let me\nstart to compare these things.\n\n471\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.460\nNow, I already knew that 500\nbucks was not a big deal, right?\n\n472\n00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.288\nAnd so, I get a CPI of 1.01.\n\n473\n00:24:23.288 --> 00:24:25.930\nI mean, we are practically 1.0 there.\n\n474\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.410\nI wouldn't really bat an eye at that.\n\n475\n00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.318\nThat's not a big deal.\n\n476\n00:24:28.318 --> 00:24:30.440\nWe're really in line.\n\n477\n00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.286\nAnd down here on this $2.3 million\nproject, I'm off $100,000.\n\n478\n00:24:35.286 --> 00:24:36.390\nThat's a lot of money.\n\n479\n00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.920\nRonnie, do you have\n$100,000 in your pocket?\n\n480\n00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.570\n>> I do not.\n\n481\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.270\n>> So, it's a ton of money, right?\n\n482\n00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.496\nBut I've got a 0.96.\n\n483\n00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:46.596\nIn the general scheme of this activity,\nit's really not that far off.\n\n484\n00:24:46.596 --> 00:24:48.900\nAnd this could just simply\nbe delayed billing.\n\n485\n00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.488\nThis could be any number of simple things\nthat will resolve itself pretty quickly.\n\n486\n00:24:53.488 --> 00:24:55.636\nSo, while that number's\npretty daunting at first,\n\n487\n00:24:55.636 --> 00:24:57.556\nit's really not that big of a deal,\nall right.\n\n488\n00:24:57.556 --> 00:25:01.090\nThat $300,000 overage, that was a lot.\n\n489\n00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.018\nThat's a lot of money\nto be sitting on there.\n\n490\n00:25:03.018 --> 00:25:04.838\n$300,000 that we haven't paid out.\n\n491\n00:25:04.838 --> 00:25:06.958\nAnd if I look at my CPI, it's a 1.2.\n\n492\n00:25:06.958 --> 00:25:08.138\nThat's pretty significant, right?\n\n493\n00:25:08.138 --> 00:25:10.420\nSignificant compared to project one and\nproject four.\n\n494\n00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.300\nSo, that's definitely a problem.\n\n495\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.708\nBut this next guy, the $25,000 project\nwith the $8000 discrepancy, right?\n\n496\n00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:21.345\nWell, if I look at that, it's a 0.68.\n\n497\n00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:26.280\nThat's 32% off from\ntarget versus 20% over.\n\n498\n00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.101\nThis one,\nproject number 3 is at the most risk.\n\n499\n00:25:29.101 --> 00:25:33.420\nIt's at the most risk because my actual\ncosts are far exceeding my earned value.\n\n500\n00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.230\nAnd at this rate,\nthe project's gonna fail, right?\n\n501\n00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.040\nThis one is much closer to\nfailing than project two is.\n\n502\n00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:44.165\nProject two has a bigger risk because of\nthe bigger dollar signs attached to it.\n\n503\n00:25:44.165 --> 00:25:48.505\nBut as far as odds of failure, project\n3 has the greatest odds of failure.\n\n504\n00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:51.295\nAnd so when they're saying which one\nis in the most need of attention,\n\n505\n00:25:51.295 --> 00:25:52.155\nit's project 3.\n\n506\n00:25:52.155 --> 00:25:54.725\nProject 3 then needs to be cancelled or\ncorrected, all right?\n\n507\n00:25:54.725 --> 00:25:57.365\nWe've gotta make that determination and\nact on it.\n\n508\n00:25:57.365 --> 00:25:59.075\nSo, that's something that\nwe can do with a CPI,\n\n509\n00:25:59.075 --> 00:26:02.190\nreally gives us a great way to compare\nthings, just like schedule variance.\n\n510\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.405\nAnd remember, the key difference\nbetween schedule variance and\n\n511\n00:26:05.405 --> 00:26:08.973\ncost variance is that we're kind of\nremoving reliance on scheduling and\n\n512\n00:26:08.973 --> 00:26:10.858\ntime and focusing purely on the cost.\n\n513\n00:26:10.858 --> 00:26:13.080\nThat actual cost that gets broken in.\n\n514\n00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.960\nAnd you'll find that this is\nwhat most companies want.\n\n515\n00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.165\nAs a project manager, we usually think\nschedule variance cuz it's a little more\n\n516\n00:26:19.165 --> 00:26:20.710\nall-encompassing, right?\n\n517\n00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.450\nTime and cost factored in.\n\n518\n00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.190\nBut this one is what companies want,\nbecause they wanna know that bottom line,\n\n519\n00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.480\nthe dollar that they're paying out.\n\n520\n00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.650\nAre they getting the value for it?\n\n521\n00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.800\nSo, you'll see this one\nused more commonly.\n\n522\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.660\n>> Now Don, with numbers that might\nlook as close as what we saw there,\n\n523\n00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.170\nif they're just a tenth off,\nyou would still pick\n\n524\n00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:40.400\nthe number that's farthest away\nfrom one is what we're saying?\n\n525\n00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.086\n>> Yeah, for the most part.\n\n526\n00:26:41.086 --> 00:26:44.010\nNow, your company is gonna\nhave a policy for this, right?\n\n527\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.370\nYour company should have, if you\nhave a PMO, they definitely have it.\n\n528\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.770\nBut you should have a project\nmanagement plan, right?\n\n529\n00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.990\nNot a project plan,\na project management plan.\n\n530\n00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.760\nHow you manage your projects.\n\n531\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.180\nAnd in the project management plan, it\nshould say, when you calculate your SV, or\n\n532\n00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.590\nwhen you calculate your CV, here's the\namount that we'll tolerate that being off.\n\n533\n00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:07.230\nOkay, so that if you're off 4%,\nmaybe that's okay for your company.\n\n534\n00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.178\nAnother company might say, no, only 2%.\n\n535\n00:27:09.178 --> 00:27:11.500\nAnd so, that's your acceptable window.\n\n536\n00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.210\nAnd if your project completes and\nit's over 2% or under 2%, it's okay.\n\n537\n00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.100\nIt's still a win because that's\nthe number your company decided on.\n\n538\n00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.610\nBut there is no official number.\n\n539\n00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.470\nThe PMI, they don't have\nan official number for you.\n\n540\n00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.940\nIt's up to your company to\ndecide your tolerance and\n\n541\n00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.050\nwhat you're willing to accept for\nsuccess, right?\n\n542\n00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.913\nSo, these numbers here,\n\n543\n00:27:30.913 --> 00:27:35.668\nI might have an organization that\nwe say if it's more than 10%.\n\n544\n00:27:35.668 --> 00:27:38.668\nIf it's more than 0.1,\nthen we need to act on it.\n\n545\n00:27:38.668 --> 00:27:42.157\nAnd so looking at these projects\nright here, both project 2 and\n\n546\n00:27:42.157 --> 00:27:46.758\nproject 3, would be an equal level of\nrisk, because they're both beyond 0.1.\n\n547\n00:27:46.758 --> 00:27:50.468\nThey're both beyond 10% versus\nproject 1 and 4 that aren't, right.\n\n548\n00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:52.090\nThey're in the acceptable means.\n\n549\n00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:57.058\nBut if my limit is 3%, then even project\n4 is at a pretty big risk there, right?\n\n550\n00:27:57.058 --> 00:27:59.570\nBecause it's 4% away from\nwhere it's supposed to be.\n\n551\n00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.570\nSo, it is just up to the company.\n\n552\n00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.600\n>> Well, Don, thank you again for\nshowing us about the cost variance and\n\n553\n00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.220\nthe cost performance index.\n\n554\n00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.800\nRemember that the cost variance for\nus, right,\n\n555\n00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.570\nis actually compared to that planned work\nthat we had that we said we were gonna\n\n556\n00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.430\nspend versus what we actually do have or\nwhat we actually have spent at that point.\n\n557\n00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.600\nAnd then, that cost performance index,\njust like what Don showed us,\n\n558\n00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.200\nallows us to be able to tell\nwhether we're over budget or\n\n559\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.460\nunder budget fairly easily,\neven when the numbers get large, right?\n\n560\n00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.320\nYou'll still be able to actually\ndetermine that fairly easily on which\n\n561\n00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.170\none you actually want to be able to use.\n\n562\n00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.150\nDon, thank you for also putting that in\nthe context of the PNP exam, as well.\n\n563\n00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.870\nHelping us to be able to look at that.\n\n564\n00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.400\nAnd we do appreciate it.\n\n565\n00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.930\nAny last words as people\nare practicing this?\n\n566\n00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.790\n>> So what we just saw right\n\n567\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.920\nthere was the most basic\nimplementation of cost variance.\n\n568\n00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.568\nWe do have a little more.\n\n569\n00:28:43.568 --> 00:28:47.611\nI want to cover cumulative cost\nvariance or cumulative CPI, really,\n\n570\n00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:49.180\nis the important one.\n\n571\n00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:49.870\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n572\n00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.918\nWe're gonna film another episode\nthat'll cover that after this.\n\n573\n00:28:51.918 --> 00:28:54.478\nWe'll also do the cumulative\nschedule performance index too.\n\n574\n00:28:54.478 --> 00:28:56.390\nSo, you'll want to see those.\n\n575\n00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.199\nNot as common out there in the real world,\nbut\n\n576\n00:28:58.199 --> 00:29:00.158\ncommon enough on the exam\nthat we need to know it.\n\n577\n00:29:00.158 --> 00:29:01.580\nSo, stay tuned for that episode.\n\n578\n00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.562\nBut as far as cost variance though,\nthat's a pretty good run down.\n\n579\n00:29:04.562 --> 00:29:07.930\n>> All right, wise words for\nus to end this episode on.\n\n580\n00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.240\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n581\n00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:11.880\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n582\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.217\n>> And

00:00:19.160\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we're taking a look at the PMP,\n\n4\n00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.660\nthe Project Management Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.620\nWe're specifically going into some\nof the different formulas and\n\n6\n00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.120\nthis time thought we're taking\nan accumulative approach and\n\n7\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.900\ntalking about some of\nthe different indexes.\n\n8\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.820\nWho better to help us than Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.870\nDon, how it going?\n\n10\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.660\n>> It is going gret Ron,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.860\nAnd we're gonna basically jump right\nback into our formulas and action.\n\n12\n00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.570\nThe ones we're gonna take a look at\ntoday are some interesting ones.\n\n13\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.620\nOnes that I don't admittedly use in\nproduction very often cuz I have software\n\n14\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.250\nthat does it for me.\n\n15\n00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.920\nBut there are ones that we\nneed to be aware of and\n\n16\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.550\nwe need to understand\nwhy they're available.\n\n17\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.200\nAnd what they are, are cumulative indexes.\n\n18\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.150\nNow, in previous episodes,\nwe've covered cost variance, and\n\n19\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.640\nwe covered schedule variance.\n\n20\n00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.030\nAnd with both of those,\nwe calculated indexes.\n\n21\n00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.240\nThe Schedule Performance Index or SPI and\nthe CPI, or Cost Performance Index.\n\n22\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.930\nWhen both of those indexes, or indices?\n\n23\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.670\n>> Indices, yeah.\n\n24\n00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.150\n>> Whatever, both those indexes,\njust all remember that.\n\n25\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.970\nWith both of those indexes, they're\nreally just a single point in time.\n\n26\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.720\nWe look at our earned, like with a,\nwe'll use SPI as an example.\n\n27\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.960\nYou look at your earned value and your\nplanned value for that moment in time or\n\n28\n00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.780\ncosts, right?\n\n29\n00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.200\nWe look at our earned value and\nour actual cost for that moment in time.\n\n30\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.650\nHere's the problem with that,\nyou might look at things right now and\n\n31\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.960\nthey might be fine, but they have\na track record of being really bad.\n\n32\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.670\nWhat can happen is if you\nlook at it right now and\n\n33\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.420\neverything looks fine,\nwell next week things might be bad again.\n\n34\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.380\nBut you didn't see that coming\nbecause you didn't look historically.\n\n35\n00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.230\nSo, where cumulative indexes come in is\nthey try to help you get a better handle\n\n36\n00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.170\non how things have been running to date,\nnot just on this date, but to that date.\n\n37\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.990\nEverything that happened before.\n\n38\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.860\nThis is incredibly useful if\nyou're a new project manager or\n\n39\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.590\nan existing project manager\nassigned to a new project, right?\n\n40\n00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.060\nSo, maybe there's\na project that's failing.\n\n41\n00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.690\nAnd they bring you into this area,\n\n42\n00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.720\nyou're the new PM,\ntake this project and make it better.\n\n43\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.860\nAnd you sit down and you just run your CPI\nand your SPI and everything looks good.\n\n44\n00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.510\nAnd you're like woo this\nis going to be easy,\n\n45\n00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.350\nI'm just gonna kick back, this project,\nit's not in danger at all.\n\n46\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.860\nBut if you run your cumulative indexes,\nyou'll start to see the history.\n\n47\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.860\nYou'll see the problem and you'll see\nwhat you're most likely to end up with.\n\n48\n00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.540\nAnd this is not true forecasting,\n\n49\n00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.110\nwe're gonna talk about true\nforecasting in another episode.\n\n50\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.880\nSo this isn't like EAC and\nall that good stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.670\nBut this does give you a better idea on\nthe health of the project compared to\n\n52\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.060\nwhat it's been doing historically.\n\n53\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.520\nSo enough jabbering about it,\nlet me show you how this works.\n\n54\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.080\nWe'll start with cost, cuz cost is\nusually the one that we deal with,\n\n55\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.810\nschedules is less common.\n\n56\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.175\nWith cost what we do is we take\nour cost performance index,\n\n57\n00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:55.864\nthe same formula we saw\nin previous episodes.\n\n58\n00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:58.390\nCPI + EV / AC.\n\n59\n00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.570\nNothing new there,\nthere's just the standard formula.\n\n60\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.050\nWell, except for these little cs\nthat are stuck up here, right.\n\n61\n00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.100\nSo what do all those little cs mean?\n\n62\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.250\nWhat they mean is the cumulative value.\n\n63\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.740\nNot just one actual cost, but\nthe actual cost over a period of time, and\n\n64\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.050\nnot just one earned value, but the earned\nvalue over several periods of time, okay.\n\n65\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.370\nSo we have to take the numbers that\nwe've gathered and sum them up.\n\n66\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.730\nIf I have five different reports for\n\n67\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.860\nmy actual cost I need to\nadd up all five of them.\n\n68\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.520\nAnd I need to take the corresponding five\nearned value reports and add them up and\n\n69\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.560\ntake the cumulative EV and\ndivide it by the cumulative AC and\n\n70\n00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.550\nthat will give me my cumulative cost\nperformance index which factors in not\n\n71\n00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.210\njust the latest report but\nthe previous reports also.\n\n72\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.200\nThe biggest challenge\nthat we have with CPI\n\n73\n00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.880\nis making sure our data set is accurate.\n\n74\n00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.930\nIf I want to work with CPI,\nhere's a great example, right?\n\n75\n00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.420\nSo they're giving me some information.\n\n76\n00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.870\nThey've been running reports already.\n\n77\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.900\nI'm the new guy, I come in,\nI'm here to save this project.\n\n78\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.760\nAnd so they give me a report\nthat looks like this, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.980\nLooks like they do\nreporting every two weeks.\n\n80\n00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.960\nSo we've got a report on January 15,\nFebruary 1st, February 15,\n\n81\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.020\nMarch 1st,\nits a little more than two weeks.\n\n82\n00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.534\nBut it's the 1st and 15th of every month,\nI'm getting a status report.\n\n83\n00:04:19.534 --> 00:04:23.450\nAnd on each status report they calculate\nthe earned value and the actual cost.\n\n84\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.390\nNow these reports if I'm\ngonna use this formula I've\n\n85\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.190\ngotta have an earned value for\nevery actual cost.\n\n86\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.030\nI have to have the same number.\n\n87\n00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.200\nSo I'm fortunate here.\n\n88\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.290\nI've got four actual costs I've got four\nEVs, they're for the same time period,\n\n89\n00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.830\nthis is accurate data.\n\n90\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.820\nIf one group like the accounting\ndepartment is doing actual cost and\n\n91\n00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.130\nthen the people in the field\nare doing the earned value,\n\n92\n00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.830\nyou might have reports\nfrom different dates, or\n\n93\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.330\nyou might have more of one report than\nthe another and that becomes a challenge.\n\n94\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.710\nSo you've got to do a little\ndata sanitation and\n\n95\n00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.460\nmake sure that things line up.\n\n96\n00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.790\nThe other thing is that there's\ntwo ways to track this.\n\n97\n00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.803\nNotice my earned value numbers here.\n\n98\n00:04:57.803 --> 00:05:02.448\n20,500, then 38,000,\nthen 60,000, then 84,000.\n\n99\n00:05:02.448 --> 00:05:04.376\nSee how it's getting bigger each time?\n\n100\n00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:06.970\nThat's because more and\nmore work is getting done.\n\n101\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.880\nThese are actually already cumulative,\nthis 84,000 here is actually\n\n102\n00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.420\neverything before it plus what\nhappened between February 16th and\n\n103\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.710\nFebruary 28th, or\n29th if it's a leap year.\n\n104\n00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.690\nGotta factor that one it.\n\n105\n00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.870\nSo it's kinda already cumulative, and\n\n106\n00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.200\nthat's okay, as long as my actual\ncost is that way also, right?\n\n107\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.714\nAnd it is, see?\n\n108\n00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:33.525\n22,000, 38,000, 65,000 but\nlet's say that the accounting\n\n109\n00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:37.442\ndepartment was saying,\nyou had 22,000 on January 15th.\n\n110\n00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:42.876\nBut then, what would it be,\n16,000 is what you had up to February 1st.\n\n111\n00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:47.338\nRight, 16,000 plus 22,000\ngets us to 38,000, right, so\n\n112\n00:05:47.338 --> 00:05:50.490\nthat's the new expenses and\nthen so on like that.\n\n113\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.570\nSo if one has been tracked\nper reporting period, and\n\n114\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.050\nthe other is cumulative,\nthat can screw up your numbers.\n\n115\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.560\nSo they need to either\nboth be cumulative or\n\n116\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.490\nthey need to both be per reporting period.\n\n117\n00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.110\nAnd it's up to your company to\ndecide which one you're gonna do.\n\n118\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.420\nAs far as calculating out your CPI,\nall that matters is that they match.\n\n119\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.210\nThey just have to match.\n\n120\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.630\nThey have to be the same, either per\nreporting period or cumulative already.\n\n121\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.620\nOnce you've determined that,\nyou can calculate out your cumulative CPI.\n\n122\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.430\nNow they've calculated out the CPI for\neach one.\n\n123\n00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.930\nI don't necessarily care about that.\n\n124\n00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.710\nI'm gonna ignore that because the\ncumulative basically makes it where I sum\n\n125\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.220\nup all my earned values and\nI sum up all my actual costs and\n\n126\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.160\nI plug that into the formula, right.\n\n127\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.820\nSo let's run through that process, right.\n\n128\n00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.480\nIf I take my earned value and\nI sum that up.\n\n129\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.600\nWell, I'm gonna need a little\ncalculator help on this one so\n\n130\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.903\nlet me get my trusty calculator out.\n\n131\n00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:45.830\nAnd so we'll take 20,500.\n\n132\n00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.036\nAnd I'm gonna add to that $38,000 and\nI'm gonna add to that $60,000 and\n\n133\n00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:54.370\nI'm gonna add to that $84,000, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.231\nAnd I get $202,500.\n\n135\n00:06:56.231 --> 00:07:00.364\nNow, I haven't spent $202,500, right?\n\n136\n00:07:00.364 --> 00:07:03.003\nThe accounting department is actually\ntelling me, as of March 1st,\n\n137\n00:07:03.003 --> 00:07:04.357\nI've only spent $80,000.\n\n138\n00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:07.540\nBut I'm okay with that because I\nknow this is a cumulative value.\n\n139\n00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.990\nBecause that's the way it was given to me.\n\n140\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.700\nIt doesn't have to be that way but\nthat's how it is.\n\n141\n00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.960\nSo I'm gonna take 202,500 and\njust plug that in here.\n\n142\n00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.811\nAll right and I'm okay with that\nbeing cumulative because my actual\n\n143\n00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:20.020\ncosts are cumulative also.\n\n144\n00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.200\nAnd you can see where I could\nconvert these if I needed to.\n\n145\n00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.390\nI could go in and subtract out and\nconvert them to per period if I need it.\n\n146\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.303\nBut for the numbers that I've got here,\nlet me just go through and add these up.\n\n147\n00:07:30.303 --> 00:07:38.087\nSo 22,000 plus 38,000\nplus 65,000 plus 80,000.\n\n148\n00:07:38.087 --> 00:07:41.587\nGives me $205,000.\n\n149\n00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:44.080\nSo it looks like whatever I get\nit's not gonna be that off.\n\n150\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.463\nRight, this is gonna be\na fairly good project.\n\n151\n00:07:46.463 --> 00:07:47.926\nSo I get $205,000.\n\n152\n00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:52.725\nNow, all I have to do is take these two\nnumbers and run them through my formula,\n\n153\n00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:55.293\nthe same formula that we've been using.\n\n154\n00:07:55.293 --> 00:07:59.950\nSo I take my earned value, $202,500 And\n\n155\n00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:05.175\nI divide that by my actual cost $205,000,\nand\n\n156\n00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:10.211\nI get 0.987 which I\nwould round up to 0.99.\n\n157\n00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:12.560\n0.99, okay.\n\n158\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.370\nNow, if I just came into\nthis project today and\n\n159\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.550\nI just pulled the latest\nreport from March 1st, right?\n\n160\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.700\nThe latest report shows me at 1.05.\n\n161\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.430\nI'm 5% over.\n\n162\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.180\nRight, so I'm spending too much.\n\n163\n00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:33.096\nRight, I've earned $84,000,\nand I've spent $80,000.\n\n164\n00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:38.058\nI'm actually under budget in this case,\nso I haven't spent enough, but\n\n165\n00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:42.140\nI can see that historically,\nI'm 1% over budget.\n\n166\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.560\nSo while I look like I'm ahead,\nI actually have a little of a deficit now.\n\n167\n00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.920\nTo be honest with you guys, 5%,\n1% here is not that big of a deal.\n\n168\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.930\nThis is a good healthy project, right.\n\n169\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.210\nSo I'm not too worried about it,\nbut there have been hiccups.\n\n170\n00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:58.230\nThere had been times when we\nare dead on with our CPI, but\n\n171\n00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.170\nwe got off to a rocky start, 7% off.\n\n172\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:06.220\nAnd then we hit that rocky part again,\n8% off, but now we have an overage and\n\n173\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.130\nthat can make it where we lose sight\nof the fact that we had a couple of bad\n\n174\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.820\nreporting periods back there.\n\n175\n00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.710\nThe cumulative CPI helps us see that, so\n\n176\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.450\nnow I get a more realistic\nview of that project.\n\n177\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.480\nNow, on the exam you might be tempted\nto just add up all your CPIs and\n\n178\n00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.255\ntake the average of them.\n\n179\n00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:24.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right,\n\n180\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.050\nwhich in theory would get you the same\nnumber, but it actually doesn't.\n\n181\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.340\nIt gets you close, and\nit's because these numbers are rounded.\n\n182\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.020\nSo you'd have actually\nhave to have the true,\n\n183\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.990\nfull laid out decimal points to be able\nto get the right number going that way.\n\n184\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.010\nSo in the exam if they give you the CPI\nlike that, don't just total those up.\n\n185\n00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.400\nGenerate your own.\n\n186\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.430\nUnless you know that they're accurate\nall the way to the decimal point, or\n\n187\n00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.900\nif you look at the multiple choice\nanswers, and the answers are all kind of\n\n188\n00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.000\nin the same, are far enough apart that you\nknow which one it is without rounding,\n\n189\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.550\nthen you can go that route, but I usually\ngo ahead and pull them up myself.\n\n190\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:01.450\nThey might even give you a chart like\nthis where the CPI field is blank, but\n\n191\n00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.830\nagain, you don't need the CPIs for\neach individual period.\n\n192\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.380\nYou don't care about that, right?\n\n193\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.970\nSo you can just leave that out and\njust jump right down here.\n\n194\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.630\nSum these guys up and then calculate\nyour CPI, your cumulative CPI.\n\n195\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.417\nThat's all you care about.\nYou don't necessarily care about\n\n196\n00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:15.970\nthe individual CPIs for each one.\n\n197\n00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.450\nIt's nice to see that, and\n\n198\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.480\nif you have project management\nsoftware it will calculate it for you.\n\n199\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.660\nYou'll have that, right?\n\n200\n00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.840\nBut on the exam,\nanswer the question they ask.\n\n201\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.200\nNot some question that\nyou create in your head.\n\n202\n00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.160\nThey're not asking me for the CPI of\neach individual one, they're asking me\n\n203\n00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.750\nto get a good picture of the financial\nhealth of the project, right?\n\n204\n00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.360\nI don't need to know each individual\nperiod CPI when I can just pull up\n\n205\n00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.340\nthe cumulative and get a good view of the\nfinancial health of the project, right?\n\n206\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.296\nSo let's run through\nthis one really quick.\n\n207\n00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:43.876\nThese are slightly bigger numbers.\n\n208\n00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:50.475\nIf I take $120,000, and we'll add 200,000,\n\n209\n00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:57.458\nand then 350,000, and\nthen 400,000, all right?\n\n210\n00:10:57.458 --> 00:11:03.500\nSo that's 1.07 million, so\nlet's hope that fits in here.\n\n211\n00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.390\nIt does.\nAll right, so\n\n212\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:10.440\nthere's our cumulative earned value, and\nnow let's take my cumulative actual cost.\n\n213\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.650\nSo I'm gonna take 100,000,\nand we'll add on 190,000.\n\n214\n00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:19.878\nWe'll add on 300,000, and\nwe'll add on 375,000.\n\n215\n00:11:19.878 --> 00:11:25.203\nSo we're at $965,000, and\nnow we can just take those values and\n\n216\n00:11:25.203 --> 00:11:28.210\nfeed them into our formula, right.\n\n217\n00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.057\nSo it's gonna be $1,070,000.\n\n218\n00:11:34.882 --> 00:11:35.882\nCome on, what have I done.\n\n219\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.771\nThere we go.\nDivided by $965,000, and\n\n220\n00:11:41.771 --> 00:11:46.621\nI get a 1.108, so I round it up to 1.11.\n\n221\n00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:49.390\nSo this is a 1.11.\n\n222\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:54.162\nAll right, and so looking at this\nI've earned more value than I've paid\n\n223\n00:11:54.162 --> 00:11:56.300\nout historically, all right?\n\n224\n00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.440\nThere have been times where it wasn't\nlike that, but actually have there been?\n\n225\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.185\nActually, it looks like we're pretty\nconsistent here that we've always earned\n\n226\n00:12:03.185 --> 00:12:06.670\nmore than we paid out, and so\nright now I'm sitting at 11% under budget.\n\n227\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.730\nIs that a great thing?\n\n228\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.280\nShould I go and get an award?\n\n229\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.310\nNo, what it probably means is my\naccounting department is taking too long\n\n230\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.145\nto pay my contractors, right?\n\n231\n00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:18.850\nI'm continually behind on my actual\ncosts verses my earned value, so\n\n232\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.570\nI need to go and\nrevisit my accounting policies and\n\n233\n00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.190\nsee if we can't figure that out, or\nmaybe something else is happening.\n\n234\n00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.210\nMaybe I'm getting false reports from\nthe field or works not getting done that's\n\n235\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:32.210\nsupposed to get done, maybe I had\na huge underage at one point, and\n\n236\n00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.470\nnow I'm just kind of feeling\nthe benefits of that going throughout.\n\n237\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.110\nI need to go and identify that, right?\n\n238\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.240\nBut I can see that I've got 1.11.\n\n239\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.147\nThat's my answer, and\nnow I know the cumulative CPI.\n\n240\n00:12:44.498 --> 00:12:48.740\nNow, the cumulative SPI,\nit's really the same thing, right?\n\n241\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.590\nCumulative SPI, we just take\nthe same formula that we used for\n\n242\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.590\nSPI and we just make it cumulative.\n\n243\n00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.084\nSo instead of earned value\ndivided by planned value,\n\n244\n00:12:58.084 --> 00:13:03.132\nit's the cumulative earned value divided\nby the cumulative planned value,\n\n245\n00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:07.418\nand it's not really any different\nthan what we saw over with CPI.\n\n246\n00:13:07.418 --> 00:13:10.538\nWe'll usually get a layout that\nlooks something like this, right?\n\n247\n00:13:10.538 --> 00:13:13.882\nThat gives us our earned value and\nour planned value, or we might have to\n\n248\n00:13:13.882 --> 00:13:17.284\ncalculate those out, and then our\nSPI if that's being calculated out,\n\n249\n00:13:17.284 --> 00:13:20.780\nbut then we just sum up these numbers and\nwe run them through that formula.\n\n250\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.990\nEarned value divided by planned value if\nwe want to get that picture of health.\n\n251\n00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.746\nNow, remember on the exam they can\nmake a question really hard if they\n\n252\n00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:32.109\ndon't necessarily give\nyou the earned value and\n\n253\n00:13:32.109 --> 00:13:37.128\nthey give it to you as the percentage\nof work complete and the plan value.\n\n254\n00:13:37.128 --> 00:13:39.466\nThen you gotta go through and\nstart calculating that out and\n\n255\n00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:40.832\nthat becomes a challenge.\n\n256\n00:13:40.832 --> 00:13:44.500\nYou have more than one formula you have\nto apply to answer the question, but\n\n257\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.540\nif it's straightforward like this one it's\njust a matter of summing these guys up,\n\n258\n00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.090\njust like we did a moment ago.\n\n259\n00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.495\nSo if I take $2,400, woops.\n\n260\n00:13:52.495 --> 00:13:55.469\n$2,400, jeez.\n\n261\n00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:57.794\nNow my calculator skills are in question.\n\n262\n00:13:57.794 --> 00:14:02.468\nWe'll add in $4,000, we'll add in another\n$4,000, and then we'll add in $9,000.\n\n263\n00:14:02.468 --> 00:14:05.110\nNow that's an interesting one right there.\n\n264\n00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.490\nSo I got 19,400, and\n\n265\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.610\nwhat I noticed as I was typing all that\nin is that we had a work stoppage.\n\n266\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.800\nIf you look,\n\n267\n00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.360\nI've got two reporting periods where\nmy earned value didn't change.\n\n268\n00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.700\nThat means one of two things, either one,\n\n269\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.300\nthis isn't accumulative number, maybe\neach one of these is a reporting period.\n\n270\n00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.462\nThis one was 2,400, this was 4,000,\nthis was 4,000, this was 9,000,\n\n271\n00:14:24.462 --> 00:14:28.230\neach one individual periods versus\nsomething that is continually growing.\n\n272\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.960\nI can't really tell here, but\non my plan value we can tell,\n\n273\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.980\nor if our plan values are close\nenough then it doesn't really matter.\n\n274\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.146\nThese could be per period cuz it's\nper period here also, all right?\n\n275\n00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:41.270\nSo, I got 19,400 on my plan value.\n\n276\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.820\nI can calculated the same thing.\n\n277\n00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.270\nNow notice on my most recent\nperiod it shows that I'm spot on.\n\n278\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.130\nThis project's running great, right.\n\n279\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.830\nBut I definitely had a problem back here.\n\n280\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.070\nThere was a workstoppage,\nno work got done.\n\n281\n00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.520\nI earned no value between February 1st and\nFebruary 15, so that's an issue.\n\n282\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.910\nWell, unless this is a per period.\n\n283\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.956\nAll right, so\nthen I'm gonna add up this other one.\n\n284\n00:15:01.956 --> 00:15:05.983\nSo I'll take 2,000, we'll add in 4,000,\n\n285\n00:15:05.983 --> 00:15:10.631\nwe'll add in 6,500, and\nthen we'll add in 9,000.\n\n286\n00:15:10.631 --> 00:15:16.072\nSo we get $21,500, okay.\n\n287\n00:15:16.072 --> 00:15:19.810\nAnd we take those numbers and\nwe just feed them into our formula, right.\n\n288\n00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.810\nEarned value divided by planned value.\n\n289\n00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:27.910\nSo my earned value was 19,400 and\nI divide that by 21,500 and\n\n290\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:33.910\nI get a cumulative SPI of 0.902,\nwhich I would round to 0.90,\n\n291\n00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:39.321\nor we'll just say 0 to keep\nthe formatting right, there we go.\n\n292\n00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:43.250\nAll right, so now when I look at this\nwhat do I know about the project?\n\n293\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.006\nWell, in my most recent reporting\nperiod things are great.\n\n294\n00:15:47.006 --> 00:15:49.390\nI got a 1.0, that's perfect.\n\n295\n00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.560\nMy schedule is exactly\nwhere it needs to be.\n\n296\n00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.743\nI'm earning value, I'm getting my\nplanned value, it's all lined up.\n\n297\n00:15:56.743 --> 00:15:59.103\nEverything's coming together great,\nall right.\n\n298\n00:15:59.103 --> 00:16:02.553\nBut when I'm concerned about\nthe health of the project.\n\n299\n00:16:02.553 --> 00:16:05.473\nI need to know that in the past\nthings were not so healthy.\n\n300\n00:16:05.473 --> 00:16:08.055\nAnd looking back here, looking at my SPI,\n\n301\n00:16:08.055 --> 00:16:12.540\nsee how my SPI had earned value of 4,000,\nplan value of 4,000.\n\n302\n00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.292\nThings are right in line, but\nafterwards I had an earned value of 4,000,\n\n303\n00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:19.166\nmy plan value was 6,500.\n\n304\n00:16:19.166 --> 00:16:23.780\nI had a 0.62, I was 38% off my schedule.\n\n305\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.370\nThat's bad, right?\n\n306\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.080\nSo we had a real big problem there.\n\n307\n00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.200\nMaybe there was a labor dispute or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n308\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.270\nAnd now we had to correct it.\n\n309\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:39.280\nWell notice how I had a $6,500 plan\nvalue here and a $9,000 plan value here.\n\n310\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.840\nSo in that period I had expected\nto do $2,500 worth of work.\n\n311\n00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.220\nBut looking over here,\nwe did $5,000 worth of work.\n\n312\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.150\nSo maybe there was a labor dispute.\n\n313\n00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.490\nWe resolved the dispute and then brought\nin double the labor to account for that.\n\n314\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.300\nSo we're evened up now.\n\n315\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.770\nBut I know there was a problem.\n\n316\n00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.010\nI know there was a problem because I\ncan see it in my cumulative SPI and\n\n317\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.430\nthat's where it really comes in.\n\n318\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.420\nIf you're newly assigned project\nmanager to this project and\n\n319\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.775\nits already been running on for\nweeks, months, years whatever.\n\n320\n00:17:08.775 --> 00:17:11.840\nThe cumulative values are a great way to\nsee that history to get an idea of hey\n\n321\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.780\nthere was a rocky road in the past and\nnow we're past it.\n\n322\n00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.500\n>> Now Don these particular indexes,\n\n323\n00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.372\nthey really do help us out with\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n324\n00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:22.443\nThe very fact that it gives us\na historical perspective and\n\n325\n00:17:22.443 --> 00:17:26.705\nto see how we've actually done in the past\ncompared to where we are also right then\n\n326\n00:17:26.705 --> 00:17:29.210\nas we start adding those things up.\n\n327\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.200\nFor the exam though,\nyou mentioned several things, right?\n\n328\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.370\nThat they could take out a bunch of\ninformation and allow you to actually\n\n329\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.120\nhave to calculate them back in, and\nmake sure that we get that all.\n\n330\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.510\nBut the totals themselves,\nthis is where I'm getting confused.\n\n331\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.651\nYou're saying that they either, in each\ncolumn, they're the earned value and,\n\n332\n00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:48.242\nexcuse me,\n\n333\n00:17:48.242 --> 00:17:52.490\nthe planned value if they're accumulative,\nthey should both be cumulative.\n\n334\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.580\nYou shouldn't end up seeing,\nI'm not gonna say you can't,\n\n335\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.480\nbut where one's gonna be iterative.\n\n336\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.090\nIn other words, each reporting period,\nand the other one's cumulative, right?\n\n337\n00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.340\n>> And if that happens on the exam,\nthen the answer you'll have to choose\n\n338\n00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.660\nis the one that says not enough\ninformation provided, right?\n\n339\n00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.240\nSo let me clarify on that statement\nreal quick to show what you'd get,\n\n340\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.510\ncuz all of mine appear to be cumulative.\n\n341\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.100\nI worked up these\nexamples a while back and\n\n342\n00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.834\napparently I didn't get very adventurous.\n\n343\n00:18:13.834 --> 00:18:17.345\nSo let's say that we jump in and\nit's per reporting period okay.\n\n344\n00:18:17.345 --> 00:18:22.640\nWell here on the left side I can start\nto say like what my plan values are,\n\n345\n00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.587\nand so my plan value I might say\n120,000 for the first one and\n\n346\n00:18:27.587 --> 00:18:32.832\nthen I come through and\nsay something like 260, no 80,000.\n\n347\n00:18:32.832 --> 00:18:37.390\nAnd then, gosh I should\nprobably work this backwards.\n\n348\n00:18:39.483 --> 00:18:43.002\nEasier, let's see, this was 400,000.\n\n349\n00:18:43.002 --> 00:18:50.860\nSo this will be another 50,000 Let's see,\ndoes that work out right?\n\n350\n00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.387\n200, no, shoot, I screwed it up.\n\n351\n00:18:52.387 --> 00:18:56.545\nLet me, [LAUGH] this is what I get for\ntrying to change things on the fly.\n\n352\n00:18:56.545 --> 00:18:59.560\nAll right, so\nthis one should have a 50,000 gain.\n\n353\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.229\nThis one should have a 150,000,\nthat's what I lost.\n\n354\n00:19:02.229 --> 00:19:07.540\nAnd then this one should be 80,000, okay.\n\n355\n00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.876\nWhen I look at these numbers,\n\n356\n00:19:08.876 --> 00:19:12.070\nlet's say on the exam I get a chart\nthatand it looks like this.\n\n357\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.981\nOn the left side,\nsee how the numbers steadily grow?\n\n358\n00:19:14.981 --> 00:19:18.054\n125,000 then 210,000 then\n360,000 then 440,000.\n\n359\n00:19:18.054 --> 00:19:21.429\nOn the planned value side though,\nthey don't.\n\n360\n00:19:21.429 --> 00:19:24.670\nSometimes they grow,\nsometimes they shrink.\n\n361\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.170\n120,000 then down to 80,\nthen up to 150, then down to 50,000.\n\n362\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.490\nIt's going up and down.\n\n363\n00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.300\nWe get these variations, okay?\n\n364\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:38.300\nYou expect to see variations like that\nwhen you've got it per reporting period.\n\n365\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.430\nThe accounting department expects\nto pay out 120 grand by January 15.\n\n366\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:47.510\nThey expect to pay out another\n$80,000 by February 1st.\n\n367\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:52.210\nThey expect to pay another\n$150,000 by February 15th.\n\n368\n00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.110\nAnd then another $50,000 by March 1st.\n\n369\n00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.070\nThat's their plan per reporting period,\nokay.\n\n370\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.710\nAnd it's okay that it's like that, as long\nas my earned value is like that also.\n\n371\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.670\nBut if you look at the earned value, see\nhow it's steadily growing and growing and\n\n372\n00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.630\ngrowing, getting bigger and bigger.\n\n373\n00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.030\nLook how off that is,\n440,000 versus 50,000.\n\n374\n00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.490\nThose numbers are not anywhere close, and\nso if I were to calculate SPI on that,\n\n375\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.980\nmy numbers would be way skewed.\n\n376\n00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.370\nThese are not compatible numbers and\nso I need to correct that.\n\n377\n00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.920\nI need to get my earned value as\nper reporting period also, but\n\n378\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.630\nthat's really hard to do.\n\n379\n00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.370\nI can't just go and subtract these out.\n\n380\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.360\nI can't say, well, 440,000 minus 360,000,\nthat's what goes here.\n\n381\n00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.920\nAnd the reason is, with earned value,\nyou're taking your planned value and\n\n382\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.270\nyou're multiplying it by\na percentage of work.\n\n383\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.740\nAnd I don't necessarily know what\nthat percentage of work was.\n\n384\n00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.100\nThere's two variables that are in\nthe mix that kinda throw things off.\n\n385\n00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.450\nWell, I might have my planned value\nover here and I can use that,\n\n386\n00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.740\nbut I still have this other variable.\n\n387\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.930\nAnd I have to do a lot\nof work to convert it.\n\n388\n00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.234\nAnd so it can be done in some scenarios.\n\n389\n00:20:52.234 --> 00:20:55.200\nBut on the exam, the answer would normally\nbe not enough information provided right?\n\n390\n00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.670\nThat these are not compatible.\n\n391\n00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.300\nBut if they were listed\nin a way that was proper,\n\n392\n00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.710\nif it was per reporting period, right?\n\n393\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:10.050\nThen we could come in and say,\npunching in these numbers where we have\n\n394\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:17.370\na project that is- let's just\ndo slight overages here.\n\n395\n00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.140\nThere, like this.\n\n396\n00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.050\nSee how again, my numbers they\nmight be bigger then smaller then\n\n397\n00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.190\nbigger then smaller.\n\n398\n00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.260\nWhat I've got here is a situation\nwhere I'm doing per reporting period.\n\n399\n00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.630\nMy earned value just for this reporting\nperiod from February 1st to February 15th,\n\n400\n00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.500\nthis reporting period, was $145,000.\n\n401\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.592\nAnd I can compare that to my planned\nvalue just for that reporting period.\n\n402\n00:21:38.592 --> 00:21:41.850\nYou've gotta do apples to apples right,\nand oranges to oranges.\n\n403\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.270\nSo now we can go through and\ntotal these up and\n\n404\n00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:48.010\nwe'll get a realistic good number\nthat is cumulative on these.\n\n405\n00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:53.909\nAnd so if I run through the old calculator\nhere and start totaling these up.\n\n406\n00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:55.285\nSo I'll take 125,000 plus 85,000.\n\n407\n00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:59.490\nPlus 145,000 plus 55,000.\n\n408\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.180\nI end up with 410,000.\n\n409\n00:22:03.218 --> 00:22:09.661\nAll right, and then if I take my planned\nvalues and run through the same process.\n\n410\n00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:16.017\nSo 120,000, plus 80,000, plus 150,000,\n\n411\n00:22:16.017 --> 00:22:20.345\nplus 50,000, I get 400,000.\n\n412\n00:22:20.345 --> 00:22:23.070\nAll right, so now the numbers are actually\n\n413\n00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.020\nfar more indicative of what my\ntotal project cost should be.\n\n414\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:33.568\nRight, when I did it back here, my\nproject is not a $19,400 project, right?\n\n415\n00:22:33.568 --> 00:22:37.570\nMy project is a $9,000 project but because\nthese were cumulative when I added it up,\n\n416\n00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.740\nI get a nice, big number.\n\n417\n00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.740\nNow at the end of the day, because\nwe're doing division it doesn't matter,\n\n418\n00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.950\nit all factors out.\n\n419\n00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:46.690\nRight, but if I got the numbers\nthe way they're given to me here,\n\n420\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.250\nper reporting period, it is accurate.\n\n421\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.170\nThis is a $400,000 project.\n\n422\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.940\nAnd I've got an overage of\n$10,000 I can see already,\n\n423\n00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.190\nwhich means I'm apparently ahead of\nschedule somehow, but over budget.\n\n424\n00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:00.750\nSo if I feed that into our\nformula to solve it, right.\n\n425\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:06.930\nI can take my $410,000 and\ndivide that by the $400,000 plan value,\n\n426\n00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.350\nand I get 1.025 which I\nwould round up to 1.03.\n\n427\n00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.450\nAnd there's my cumulative SPI.\n\n428\n00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.685\nI'm a little bit ahead of schedule,\n\n429\n00:23:16.685 --> 00:23:19.190\n3% and that means I've also\nspent a little more money.\n\n430\n00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.170\nI've earned that value from\nwhat my plan value was.\n\n431\n00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.410\n>> Well Don we do appreciate you showing\nus those two formulas to help us,\n\n432\n00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.370\nespecially with those cumulative\ncost performance indexes,\n\n433\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.290\nas well as a scheduled\nperformance indexes too.\n\n434\n00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.900\nThat will help us to determine\nwhat Don just showed us and\n\n435\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.390\nget us ready for the exam.\n\n436\n00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.810\nDon any last words as people are actually\ntaking a look at this on the exam?\n\n437\n00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.960\nAnything else that we\nneed to think about here?\n\n438\n00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.290\n>> Sure, double check your math because\nremember you will be doing at lot of this\n\n439\n00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.060\nby hand on paper and\nit's easy to make mistakes.\n\n440\n00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.000\nCumulative stuff is usually\npretty straight forward.\n\n441\n00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.165\nYou will probably only see one or\ntwo questions on it tops.\n\n442\n00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:53.082\nThere's, what, 200 questions on the exam?\n\n443\n00:23:53.082 --> 00:23:56.400\nSo it's just kind of a small portion,\nbut it is something that turns up.\n\n444\n00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.460\nIn real life land, you'll use project\nmanagement software to do this, right?\n\n445\n00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.330\nMicrosoft Project calculates these\nthings without batting an eye.\n\n446\n00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.540\nSo it's not necessarily something you're\ngonna work with every day, and that makes\n\n447\n00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.210\nit even harder for the exam, cuz now\nyou've gotta make sure you know it.\n\n448\n00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.700\nYou might have 20 years of\nproject management experience and\n\n449\n00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.760\njust not do these by hand.\n\n450\n00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.665\nSo just practice with it, get used to it.\n\n451\n00:24:13.665 --> 00:24:19.066\nRemember the formula is really the same as\nwhat we had for our regular CPI and SPI.\n\n452\n00:24:19.066 --> 00:24:20.810\nWe're just totaling up the values for\neach reporting period.\n\n453\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.010\n>> All right that's a great place for\nus to go ahead and end this episode.\n\n454\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.570\nSigning off for ITPro TV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n455\n00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:31.636\n>> And I'm Don Pezet and\nwe'll see you next

We learn why we would use it and how you’re likely to see it on the exam.  Don also then shows us that result of this formula is helpful when determining the TCPI, To Completion Cost Performance Index.  Using these formulas will help us to forecast what we expect to need in comparison to the Budget at Completion (BAC).  They also can show us that we can use the TCPI to forecast based on current rate of expenditures.",

00:00:18.920\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we're taking a look at the PMP.\n\n4\n00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.340\nThe project management professional, and\nwe're specifically gonna be looking at\n\n5\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.000\na few formulas, but this time we're not\nonly looking at formulas about the past or\n\n6\n00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800\neven about the present.\n\n7\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.980\nWhat we're actually looking at\nof course is about forecasting.\n\n8\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.270\nAnd who better to help us out than Mr.\nDon Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.380\nDon, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.500\n>> It is going great, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.370\nReady to jump into our episode\non Groundhogs day, right?\n\n12\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.570\nWe're gonna predict the future and\nsee what the weather's gonna be like.\n\n13\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.120\nWell not the weather temperature wise but\nthe weather financially and\n\n14\n00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.420\nschedule wise inside of our projects.\n\n15\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.840\nWhen we run these formulas,\n\n16\n00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.810\nthe whole thing is they really\nact as a status report.\n\n17\n00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.510\nHow's my project doing?\n\n18\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.690\nWell you can see how you're\nproject's doing right now.\n\n19\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.490\nYou can see how you project\nwas doing in the past.\n\n20\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.500\nWe've seen plenty of formulas for that.\n\n21\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.220\nBut taking that data and applying it\nto the future is what really matters.\n\n22\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.710\nTo say, if I stay on my current course,\nhow's this gonna end?\n\n23\n00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.860\nIs my project gonna come in on schedule,\non budget?\n\n24\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.080\nAm I gonna meet my requirements?\n\n25\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.550\nWell, the requirements, that's easy.\n\n26\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.220\nYou got a checklist of requirements\nto follow, and you're done.\n\n27\n00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.250\nBut the schedule and\nthe budget are constantly changing\n\n28\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.200\nitems based on the performance\nreports you're getting from the field.\n\n29\n00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.510\nSo we've got a collection of formulas\nthat we can use that help us see that\n\n30\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.400\nfuture, right?\n\n31\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.860\nAnd it's not 100% foolproof, right?\n\n32\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.860\nA lot of these formulas you guys will see\nare a little bit, kind of assuming, right?\n\n33\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.430\nThey assume certain\nthings are gonna happen.\n\n34\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.090\nAnd so in some cases,\nwe'll have a formula where they might be\n\n35\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.060\nmore than one variation\nof that same formula.\n\n36\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.450\nAnd it's because of different\nconditions that can affect it.\n\n37\n00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.870\nSo this is not a be all end all,\nhere's what the future is going to be.\n\n38\n00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.820\nBut it's a most likely\nscenario type situation.\n\n39\n00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.600\nSo you can say, boy, it looks like\nI'm gonna come in behind schedule.\n\n40\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.340\nSo I need to start taking\naction now to fix that\n\n41\n00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.300\nbefore I actually am behind schedule,\nand I can't recover.\n\n42\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.340\nThat's what these formulas are all about.\n\n43\n00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.340\nAnd so that's we're gonna get\na chance to see right here.\n\n44\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.989\n>> So Don, when we talk of these types of\nformulas for forecasting, is it something\n\n45\n00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.264\nthat we necessarily have to do, or\nis this something like what you said,\n\n46\n00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:20.540\nwere you're just assuming that you\nmay becoming in under schedule, and\n\n47\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.200\nthat's when we need it?\n\n48\n00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.560\n>> So you don't have to do anything,\nI suppose.\n\n49\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.100\nIt's the difference between a good project\nmanager and a bad project manager, right?\n\n50\n00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.870\nYou don't have to do anything.\n\n51\n00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.020\nBut with these formulas, I use them a lot\nin a couple of different scenarios.\n\n52\n00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.060\nSo, if it's my project and\nI've been managing it from day one,\n\n53\n00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.100\nI don't normally need these formulas.\n\n54\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.670\nAlright.\nAnd\n\n55\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.930\nthe reason is I know the trends\nthat we're following.\n\n56\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.400\nI've been watching the status reports.\n\n57\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.280\nI've been involved in that\nproject all along the way.\n\n58\n00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.990\nI don't need this data.\n\n59\n00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.860\nI've already got it because we\nsee the trends and the patterns.\n\n60\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.100\nBut if you're newly assigned to a project,\nlet's say it's a three year project, and\n\n61\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.840\na year into the project, that PM leaves\nand goes to work for another company.\n\n62\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.320\nYou are hired on, and\nyou take over the helm of that project.\n\n63\n00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.850\nRight?\n\n64\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.760\nWell it's already a year in.\n\n65\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.370\nYou need to get up to speed.\n\n66\n00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.250\nYou need to see where you're going,\nwhat those trends are, and\n\n67\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.890\nthese formulas help with that.\n\n68\n00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.770\nRight?\nSo definitely useful for you,\n\n69\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.110\nand then the other part where it;'s useful\nis let's say that you answer to a PMO.\n\n70\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.700\nThis is the project management office, and\n\n71\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.710\nthey're monitoring a whole\nportfolio of projects.\n\n72\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.280\nWell hopefully they're\nnot micromanaging you.\n\n73\n00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.220\nAnd so\nthey don't see the daily status reports.\n\n74\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.610\nThey don't see the trends, but they need a\nway to measure the health of your project,\n\n75\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.700\nand these formulas come in there too.\n\n76\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.510\nSo as a project manager, you may or\nmay not actually need these formulas.\n\n77\n00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.310\nIf you're new to the project you will.\n\n78\n00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.630\nBut if you're a PMO,\n\n79\n00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.300\nif you're somebody else like in the\ngovernance side of things, you'll need it.\n\n80\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.370\nYou'll need these numbers to\ntell the health of that project.\n\n81\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.600\nSo definitely important.\n\n82\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.490\nI guess the other thing is if\nyou're gonna take the exam,\n\n83\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.360\nyou need to know these numbers if\nyou wanna get the questions right.\n\n84\n00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.920\nSo there's a bit of that too,\nbut they are very useful.\n\n85\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.270\nMost project management software\nwill generate these for you,\n\n86\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.910\nwhich saves you a lot of time, but\nwe need to know how to do them by hand.\n\n87\n00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.830\n>> Now Don, looking at the actual\ndifferent formulas that we're going\n\n88\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.900\nto be going over It's hard for me to tell\nwhich one we need to begin with first.\n\n89\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.460\nSo Don, where are we gonna begin?\n\n90\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.370\n>> All right,\nlet's start off with an easy one.\n\n91\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.080\nI'm gonna say easy.\n\n92\n00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.890\nThe formula actually looks a little scary.\n\n93\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.600\nBut it's called estimate to complete.\n\n94\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.955\nWhenever you have an activity that's being\nworked on, the activity has a budget,\n\n95\n00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:22.385\na certain amount of money\nthat you expect to expend.\n\n96\n00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:25.185\nAnd we normally measure it in efforts,\nso it's not just straight up money, but\n\n97\n00:04:25.185 --> 00:04:28.535\nit's usually hours, how many man-hours or\n\n98\n00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:31.295\njust labor hours have to go\ninto that particular activity.\n\n99\n00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:33.485\nAnd we measure the percentage\ncomplete on that.\n\n100\n00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:36.350\nAnd we've seen these with our other\nformulas and our other episodes.\n\n101\n00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.960\nBut what estimate to complete\ndoes is it's a formula that says,\n\n102\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.920\nokay, here's how much we've done so far.\n\n103\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.370\nHow much do I have left?\n\n104\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.070\nRight?\n\n105\n00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.370\nAnd if you've got a BAC, right, a budget\nat completion, which you already have.\n\n106\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.450\nYou set that in the planning phase.\n\n107\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.370\nRight?\nYou planned for a certain budget for\n\n108\n00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.190\nthis thing to have when it's completed.\n\n109\n00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.450\nSo, you have that BAC, but\nif things are running over budget,\n\n110\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.340\nor running under budget, or whatever, that\nBAC is not necessarily accurate anymore.\n\n111\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.900\nIs it?\n\n112\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.060\nRight?\nBecause now we're off from that budget.\n\n113\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.140\nAnd so an ETC, an estimate to complete,\ntries to fill in that gap and say,\n\n114\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.110\nall right,\nhere's what you've already spent.\n\n115\n00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.410\nHere's how much more we're\ngoing to need to finish it.\n\n116\n00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.960\nRight?\nAnd\n\n117\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.950\nlet me show you the estimate\nto complete formula here.\n\n118\n00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.950\nSo basically, the way it works is\nit's made up of a few components,\n\n119\n00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.960\nthe BAC, the budget and completion.\n\n120\n00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.850\nRight?\nWe definitely have to have that.\n\n121\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.070\nThe earned value.\n\n122\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.960\nNow the earned value, notice is EVc.\n\n123\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.830\nThis is the cumulative earned value.\n\n124\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.480\nSo if the activities been going on for\nthree weeks,\n\n125\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.600\nit's not just the earned value for\nthis reporting period.\n\n126\n00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.710\nIt would be the earned value for\nall three weeks.\n\n127\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.420\nRight?\nSo we might need to add that up, or\n\n128\n00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.920\nif we've been tracking it in a cumulative\nmanor, we've already got that.\n\n129\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.430\nRight?\n\n130\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.490\nSo I need my cumulative earned value.\n\n131\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.630\nAnd then I need to divide\nthat by my cumulative CPI.\n\n132\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.410\nAnd we covered that in another episode.\n\n133\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.150\nRight?\n\n134\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.250\nOur cost performance index.\n\n135\n00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.680\nAnd not just the cost performance index\nfor the last reporting period, but\n\n136\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.300\nthe cumulative one for\nthe all of the reporting periods\n\n137\n00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.470\nwhich we may have been tracking\nthat way or we may not have.\n\n138\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.730\nBut if I have the cumulative value,\nthen I'm going to be dividing by that.\n\n139\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.380\nSo we take the budget, which is basically\nwhat we planned on spending, and\n\n140\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.790\nthen we subtract what we've earned.\n\n141\n00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:17.800\nAnd so what's left?\n\n142\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.194\nWell, whatever's left, in theory,\nis how much more money we need to spend.\n\n143\n00:06:22.194 --> 00:06:23.502\nRight?\nWe need to spend, so\n\n144\n00:06:23.502 --> 00:06:27.142\nlet's say our budget at completion\nis $5,000, and our earned value so\n\n145\n00:06:27.142 --> 00:06:31.678\nfar is $3,000, so we plan on spending\n$5,000, so far we've spent $3,000.\n\n146\n00:06:31.678 --> 00:06:34.970\nIf I subtract $3,000 from $5,000,\nI get $2,000 left.\n\n147\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.887\nSo in theory, I gotta pay $2,000 more.\n\n148\n00:06:37.887 --> 00:06:41.400\nBut what if I'm under budget or\nover budget?\n\n149\n00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.620\nWell, CPI will bring that into effect.\n\n150\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.420\nRight?\n\n151\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.670\nIf I'm over budget, lets say my CPI\nis like 1.2 and I'm over budget.\n\n152\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.350\nWell I'm sorry other way around,\nby point eight and I'm over budget.\n\n153\n00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:01.180\nSo if I take this $2,000 and I divide it\nby that number, whatever my CPI is, that\n\n154\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.570\nwill correct it to make it more accurate\nto reflect where I am budget wise.\n\n155\n00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.850\nSo factoring in that CPI\nis pretty important,\n\n156\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.700\nand that's what is going to\nmake things kind of go in line.\n\n157\n00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.650\nNow here's one of the examples\nof where our formula might have\n\n158\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.970\ntwo different versions.\n\n159\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:15.840\nRight?\n\n160\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.270\nWith the first version,\nthe one that you're most likely to use,\n\n161\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.940\nwith this version you're assuming\nthat everything's staying the same.\n\n162\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.675\nThat if I was over budget,\nI'm gonna continue to be over budget.\n\n163\n00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:27.390\nRight?\n\n164\n00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.270\nAnd if you're new to the project,\nif you're just coming in and\n\n165\n00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.760\ndoing a health test,\nthat's what you normally want.\n\n166\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.030\nSo this is the most common\nform of the formula.\n\n167\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.040\nBut let's say that you just\ntook corrective action.\n\n168\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.100\nYou just stepped in and\nmade a big change in the project.\n\n169\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.290\nAnd so\nwhile you might have been over budget,\n\n170\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.980\nyou know that from now on\nyou're gonna be on budget.\n\n171\n00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.020\nRight?\n\n172\n00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.928\nIf you just took corrective action, then\nthis CPI is just gonna skew your numbers.\n\n173\n00:07:52.928 --> 00:07:56.468\nIt's gonna show you as being off in\nthe future, even though you just fixed it.\n\n174\n00:07:56.468 --> 00:08:00.728\nSo if you know you've fixed things,\nthen you know conditions are gonna change.\n\n175\n00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:04.608\nRight, and so at that point you\ncan just leave the CPI off.\n\n176\n00:08:04.608 --> 00:08:06.510\nDon't even factor in the CPI.\n\n177\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.250\nAnd just do budget at completion minus\nthat cumulative earned value, and\n\n178\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.050\nnow you get that estimate to complete.\n\n179\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.720\nHow much money you need to\ncomplete this activity, right?\n\n180\n00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.050\nSo, two different variations here.\n\n181\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.160\nAnd the way you know which to use.\n\n182\n00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.370\nWell, in real life,\nyou'll typically use this one.\n\n183\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.570\nBut if you know conditions are changing,\nthen you use the second one, right.\n\n184\n00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.659\nAnd you've gotta know both for the exam.\n\n185\n00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:30.272\nAnd in the word problem they give you,\nthey'll give you the hints that tell you\n\n186\n00:08:30.272 --> 00:08:33.580\nwhich one you need to use, right,\nwhether things are changing or not.\n\n187\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.780\nNow let's look at an example of this.\n\n188\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.770\nSo here's an example.\n\n189\n00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.840\nAnd it's telling us you're a project\nteam member responsible for\n\n190\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.510\nWork Breakdown Structure Activity 4.1.1,\nwhich has an assigned budget of $250,000.\n\n191\n00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.640\nYour project manager has\nrequested an ETC for your task.\n\n192\n00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.230\nOkay?\n\n193\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.919\nSo we need to get that\nestimate to complete it.\n\n194\n00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:54.529\nThe project manager's come to us and said,\n\n195\n00:08:54.529 --> 00:08:57.890\nhow much more money does it look like\nwe're gonna spend to get this thing done?\n\n196\n00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:58.620\nWe've got a budget.\n\n197\n00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.090\nWe know what that is, right?\n\n198\n00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.808\nWe've got a budget of $250,000.\n\n199\n00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:03.666\nBut they want to know,\nat our current trajectory,\n\n200\n00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:08.750\nhow much more are we gonna need to finish\nthis based on what we've spent so far.\n\n201\n00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.070\nAnd so these are our status\nreports that we've got right here,\n\n202\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.350\nI've got my earned values,\nmy actual costs, and my CPI, right.\n\n203\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.069\nSo looking at it so far, you can see\nthis activity is kinda varied a bit.\n\n204\n00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:24.046\nI've got four reporting periods here,\nJanuary 15th, February 1st, February 15th,\n\n205\n00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:25.470\nMarch 1st.\n\n206\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:30.488\nAnd In January, my CPI was at 0.93,\nthen I went to a 1.0.\n\n207\n00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:32.080\nI was right on budget.\n\n208\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.940\nThat's perfect.\n\n209\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.958\nThen I went back to a 0.92,\nthen up to a 1.05.\n\n210\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.098\nI mean, we're all over the place.\n\n211\n00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:40.270\nWe're over budget,\nwe're under budget, things fluctuate.\n\n212\n00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.650\nBut that's pretty realistic.\n\n213\n00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.500\nProjects do that.\n\n214\n00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.723\nNow, some of these are pretty large,\nlike a 0.08.\n\n215\n00:09:45.723 --> 00:09:47.840\nThat's an 8% budget offset.\n\n216\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.110\nThat's kind of significant.\n\n217\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.940\nBut it's not super critical\ndanger zone yet, right.\n\n218\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.000\nLike, alarms aren't going off.\n\n219\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.680\nBut it's still a bit of a problem.\n\n220\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.870\nAnd because I see these wild swings,\n\n221\n00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.160\nI know that the odds are I'm gonna finish\npretty close to where I want to finish.\n\n222\n00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.640\nSo things look good from whoever\nis working this standpoint.\n\n223\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.080\nBut if my budget's $250,000 and these are\nmy four reporting periods that we've got\n\n224\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.460\nso far, we can use this information\nto find out how things are going.\n\n225\n00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.740\nNow, we haven't made any changes.\n\n226\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.050\nThe project manager isn't\ninstituting any changes.\n\n227\n00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.210\nThe person who's responsible for\nit is just working.\n\n228\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.700\nWe're just looking for a status update.\n\n229\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.310\nOkay?\n\n230\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.820\nSo we have to assume the conditions\nare going to continue just like they are.\n\n231\n00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.720\nIt's not saying in here, you just\nupdated your BAC due to a change ticket.\n\n232\n00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.824\nOr you just instituted some new\nlabor relations with the union so\n\n233\n00:10:37.824 --> 00:10:41.628\nyou can have extra hours each day,\nor something like that.\n\n234\n00:10:41.628 --> 00:10:43.070\nThere's no change associated with this.\n\n235\n00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.110\nSo I know I'm not gonna use\nthe smaller version of the formula,\n\n236\n00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.720\nI'm gonna factor in my CPI, okay?\n\n237\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.922\nAnd looking at this,\nwe've got our budgeted completion,\n\n238\n00:10:50.922 --> 00:10:52.250\nwhich I know is $250,000.\n\n239\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.090\nAnd then my cumulative earned value.\n\n240\n00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.152\nAnd if we look at the way this\nis reported, sometimes you have\n\n241\n00:10:59.152 --> 00:11:03.010\naccumulated earned value, where it's\njust adding up with each activity.\n\n242\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.718\nSo looking at this one,\nI can see I've already got that, right?\n\n243\n00:11:05.718 --> 00:11:06.430\nIt was 20,500,\n\n244\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:11.054\nthen we went up to 38,000, then we went\nup to 60,000, then we went up to 84,000.\n\n245\n00:11:11.054 --> 00:11:14.420\nSo we're steadily gaining in\nearned value each time, right.\n\n246\n00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.690\nSo by March 1st, this is our cumulative\nearned value, it's all added up.\n\n247\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.100\nIf these were earned values for the\nindividual reporting periods, then I would\n\n248\n00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.320\nneed to add all these together to\ncreate my cumulative earned value.\n\n249\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.727\nOkay, so it just depends on how this\nreport's been given to me, whether or\n\n250\n00:11:29.727 --> 00:11:31.158\nnot I'm going to have to add those up or\nnot.\n\n251\n00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:34.790\nAnd in this scenario,\nwe can see they're already added up.\n\n252\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.180\nSo my actual cost at this stage is 80,000.\n\n253\n00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.240\nMy earned value is 84,000,\nand that's cumulative for\n\n254\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.860\nthe entire series of activities, right?\n\n255\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.780\nAnd my current CPI is 1.05, and\nthat's calculated off of these, so\n\n256\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.860\nthat's my cumulative CPI also, all right?\n\n257\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.470\nIf these were individual\nreporting periods,\n\n258\n00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.730\none of the easiest ways to do\nthis is just to add them all up.\n\n259\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.840\nAdd them up, and then you've got your\ncumulatives, and you're in business.\n\n260\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.719\nAll right, except for CPI,\nwhich you would have to average out.\n\n261\n00:12:01.719 --> 00:12:05.870\nAll right, so then we just plug\nthat into our formula right here.\n\n262\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.090\nRight?\nNot too big of a deal.\n\n263\n00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.550\nI'm gonna get rid of this bottom\nformula since I don't need it.\n\n264\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.220\nAnd we'll replace that\nwith our actual values.\n\n265\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.970\nSo if I have my ETC is going\nto be my budget at completion,\n\n266\n00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.960\nwhich we know is $250,000.\n\n267\n00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.574\nRight?\nAnd\n\n268\n00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:25.580\nI'm gonna subtract out my cumulative\nearned value, which is currently $84,000.\n\n269\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.210\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.740\nAnd then I'm gonna divide that by my CPI.\n\n271\n00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.270\nAnd that is gonna give me\nmy estimate to complete.\n\n272\n00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.170\nNow, let's assume that I\nwasn't factoring in the CPI,\n\n273\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.680\nthat we did just make a change and\neverything's gonna be back on the level.\n\n274\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.650\nWe're gonna have a CPI of effectively one.\n\n275\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.950\nAny number divided by\none is just the number.\n\n276\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.150\nAnd so that's why CPI gets left\noff from that simple formula.\n\n277\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:56.639\nAnd if we work out the math on this,\nwhere's my calculator, here.\n\n278\n00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:00.608\nIf we take 250,000 minus 84,000, assuming\nthat everything was going the way that\n\n279\n00:13:00.608 --> 00:13:03.940\nit's supposed to, we're gonna need\n$166,000 more to complete this.\n\n280\n00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.349\nThat's my estimate to complete.\n\n281\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:11.090\nBut if I factor in my CPI of 1.05, and so\n\n282\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:17.760\nI divide that by 1.05,\nI end up at $158,095.\n\n283\n00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.990\nIt went down.\n\n284\n00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.630\nOkay?\n\n285\n00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.810\nAnd the reason is, my CPI shows\nthat I'm actually under budget.\n\n286\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.450\nI'm coming in under budget, right.\n\n287\n00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:31.608\nAnything over a 1 is under budget,\nanything under a 1 is over budget.\n\n288\n00:13:31.608 --> 00:13:32.908\nIt's kind of the opposite\nof what you'd think.\n\n289\n00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:36.328\nSo it drops to that $158,095.\n\n290\n00:13:36.328 --> 00:13:37.980\nSo that's gonna be my ETC.\n\n291\n00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.695\n$158,095.\n\n292\n00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:44.899\nSo if I take that,\nnow what your project manager can do is,\n\n293\n00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:48.725\nyour project manager can say, all right,\n\n294\n00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:53.208\nyour estimate to complete is $158,095.\n\n295\n00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:55.940\nTo date, we've spent $80,000, right?\n\n296\n00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.030\nAnd if we add those two together,\nwhat do we get?\n\n297\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.110\nWell, you'll actually see\nsomething kinda interesting here.\n\n298\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:08.158\nIf I take a $158,095, oops,\n[LAUGH] if I get in my calculator.\n\n299\n00:14:08.158 --> 00:14:12.959\nIf I take this number, and I'm gonna\nadd that to what I've spent today,\n\n300\n00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:14.778\nwhich is $80,000.\n\n301\n00:14:14.778 --> 00:14:20.920\nAnd so if I add $80,000,\nI end up at $238,095.\n\n302\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.288\nThis activity is gonna cost me $238,095,\n\n303\n00:14:24.288 --> 00:14:27.750\nwhich is below my budget at completion,\nright?\n\n304\n00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.240\nSo for some reason,\n\n305\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.530\nwe're gonna finish this activity\n$12,000 cheaper than we thought.\n\n306\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.690\nWe need to find out why.\n\n307\n00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.958\nWhy is that?\n\n308\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.400\nAnd it wasn't always like that.\n\n309\n00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.390\nAs we look at some of these earlier\nreports here, there were times where we\n\n310\n00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.410\nwere over budget, and so then we'd\nget some number higher than $250,000.\n\n311\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.320\nBut right now we get that\nestimate to complete, and\n\n312\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.751\nwe can tell the accounting department or\nwhoever,\n\n313\n00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:52.140\nlike, this is the amount of money that\nwe're still gonna need in order for\n\n314\n00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.950\nthis to finish up.\n\n315\n00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.260\nSo that's estimate to complete.\n\n316\n00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.880\nAll right, pretty straightforward formula.\n\n317\n00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.240\nThe hardest part is just\nremembering which one to use.\n\n318\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.018\nAnd just, that CPI.\n\n319\n00:15:02.018 --> 00:15:05.752\nIf you think about it, if your project\nis doing exactly what it's supposed to,\n\n320\n00:15:05.752 --> 00:15:07.940\nif you're on budget,\nyour CPI is gonna be 1.\n\n321\n00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.870\nAnd any number divided by 1 is just that\nnumber, so that value becomes useless.\n\n322\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.762\nSo if you just made change to\nbring yourself back in level,\n\n323\n00:15:14.762 --> 00:15:16.128\nyou just leave the CPI off.\n\n324\n00:15:16.128 --> 00:15:20.569\nNow, for the exam, you could just remember\nthe main formula, the long formula, and\n\n325\n00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:22.120\nforget the short one.\n\n326\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.340\nAnd then if they don't tell you a CPI,\nyou can just use a CPI of 1, and\n\n327\n00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.250\nyou effectively have the other formula.\n\n328\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.620\nBut really, you have one formula for\nnormal activities, and\n\n329\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.070\na separate formula for when things\nhave just been put right back online.\n\n330\n00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:41.160\nAll right, a similar formula\nthat's related to ETC is the TCPI.\n\n331\n00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.771\nAll right,\nTCPI is the to complete performance index,\n\n332\n00:15:43.771 --> 00:15:45.970\nlet me bring it up here on the screen.\n\n333\n00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.370\nSo this is the to-complete\nperformance index.\n\n334\n00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.064\nAnd the way this one work is very similar\nto cost performance index or, you know,\n\n335\n00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:57.118\nschedule performance index,\nthose guys, right.\n\n336\n00:15:57.118 --> 00:16:00.290\nWe just did ETC, the estimate to complete,\nhow much money we needed to finish.\n\n337\n00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.368\nWell, TCPI is basically the same thing.\n\n338\n00:16:03.368 --> 00:16:08.860\nExcept it's an index instead of\nbeing a straight up dollar sign.\n\n339\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.920\nSo it's kind of like when you\ncalculate cost variance, you know,\n\n340\n00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.630\nwhat's the difference between where I'm\nat now versus what I was planned for, or\n\n341\n00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.160\ncalculating CPI,\n\n342\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.650\nwhere CPI gives you basically\na percentage of how far off you are.\n\n343\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.810\nWell, the to-complete performance\nindex is the same thing.\n\n344\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.500\nWe get a percentage that shows us how\nfar off we are from where we should be.\n\n345\n00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.136\nNow, just like with estimate to complete,\n\n346\n00:16:31.136 --> 00:16:35.278\nwe have two forms of the TCPI formula,\nall right?\n\n347\n00:16:35.278 --> 00:16:38.440\nOne for when our budget at\ncomplete is still valid, right,\n\n348\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.300\nwhere our budget is still\nwhat we expect to finish at.\n\n349\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.696\nAnd other one where we may have decided\nthat the budget at complete is just dead,\n\n350\n00:16:46.696 --> 00:16:49.280\nthat we know we're not gonna be\nable to meet that budget and so\n\n351\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.000\nnow we're working on something different,\nright?\n\n352\n00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.190\nJust, we're trying to figure\nout where we're gonna end up.\n\n353\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.850\nSo two different formulas, but\nthey are very, very similar, all right?\n\n354\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.690\nThe way the formula works is this.\n\n355\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.890\nWe take our budget at completion and\nwe subtract our earned value, right?\n\n356\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.290\nSo the budget at completion,\nwhatever we planned on spending, and\n\n357\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.120\nwe subtract our earned value,\nwhat we've already spent, right?\n\n358\n00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.880\nNot the actual cost, though,\nbut the earned value, so\n\n359\n00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.450\nwe factor in some scheduling too.\n\n360\n00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:16.230\nSo we subtract that from the BAC and\nyou end up with a number, which is\n\n361\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.210\nbasically what we saw a moment ago with\nthe estimate to complete, right, the ETC.\n\n362\n00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:25.405\nBut then we divide that by the budget\nat complete minus the actual cost.\n\n363\n00:17:25.405 --> 00:17:27.251\nSo now we take schedule\nout of the picture, right?\n\n364\n00:17:27.251 --> 00:17:30.263\nThis is very similar to our\ncost performance index,\n\n365\n00:17:30.263 --> 00:17:34.340\nwhich was earned value divided\nby actual cost, right?\n\n366\n00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:39.500\nNow we're just subtracting that\nfrom the budget at complete\n\n367\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.970\nto figure out what's our to-complete.\n\n368\n00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.460\nYou know, how much more do we need to\nfinish, not just where we're at right now.\n\n369\n00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.500\nSo this is really just\na variation of the CPI formula.\n\n370\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.927\nAnd this guy right here is really easy to\nimplement and then you get that index.\n\n371\n00:17:51.927 --> 00:17:54.023\nAnd this is useful if we're\ntrying to measure it against\n\n372\n00:17:54.023 --> 00:17:55.100\nother activities, right?\n\n373\n00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.840\nRemember, the indexes are always\nabout comparing things.\n\n374\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.483\nAnd when I wanna compare\nmore than one project,\n\n375\n00:18:00.483 --> 00:18:04.792\nwhen I wanna compare more than one\nactivity, I don't wanna just use CV or SV.\n\n376\n00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.906\nI don't wanna use those guys because\ndepending on the size of the project,\n\n377\n00:18:07.906 --> 00:18:09.590\nthose numbers get skewed.\n\n378\n00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.420\nBut an index, I can compare an index\nbetween projects regardless of how\n\n379\n00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.200\ndifferent their budgets are and\n\n380\n00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.390\nget a good idea of how they're\ndoing health-wise, all right?\n\n381\n00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.158\nThe problem with this, though,\nis if our budget is shot.\n\n382\n00:18:21.158 --> 00:18:24.910\nIf we know that we're over budget,\nand we're kind of in trouble,\n\n383\n00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:29.805\nand we know we're over budget, and we say,\nwe've really gotta do a change ticket.\n\n384\n00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:33.085\nWe gotta request some more funding to\nget this project back in line, right?\n\n385\n00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:36.460\nAnd we do a change ticket,\nwe do an estimate to complete,\n\n386\n00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.430\nwe find out how much more money we're\ngonna need, we do a change ticket,\n\n387\n00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.690\nwe submit it, we show the ETC we\ncalculated and why we need more money.\n\n388\n00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:46.020\nIf we get approved, the change goes in and\n\n389\n00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.560\nthe new budget becomes your BAC,\nand now your BAC is valid.\n\n390\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.510\nBut for that window of time where you\nknow you've gotta do a change ticket,\n\n391\n00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.320\nyour BAC is not valid.\n\n392\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.890\nAnd so when you calculate your TCPI,\nit's gonna be wrong.\n\n393\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:03.810\nIt's not technically wrong,\nit's just not terribly accurate, right?\n\n394\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:08.980\nAnd so we can make it more\naccurate if we throw out the BAC\n\n395\n00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:15.030\nfrom the divisor here and swap that out\nfor something called an EAC, all right?\n\n396\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.410\nNow, we saw ETC just a moment ago,\nthe estimate to complete.\n\n397\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.430\nThat's how much more money\nwe need to complete.\n\n398\n00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.840\nBut an EAC,\nthat's the estimate at completion.\n\n399\n00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.420\nSo in other words,\nby the time we reach completion,\n\n400\n00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.690\nhow much money do we think\nwe'll have spent total?\n\n401\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.900\nEstimate to complete is how much\nmore money we're gonna spend.\n\n402\n00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.410\nEAC is how much total money\nwe're gonna spend, all right?\n\n403\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.402\nAnd we haven't seen the EAC formula yet.\n\n404\n00:19:37.402 --> 00:19:39.370\nWe're gonna see that next.\n\n405\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.640\nBut basically it's just an updated BAC.\n\n406\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.340\nIt's a BAC that's more accurate for\nthe situation you're in.\n\n407\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.610\nAs soon as that change ticket goes in and\ngets approved, you get a new BAC.\n\n408\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.210\nAnd so you don't need the EAC anymore,\nyou just go back to the BAC.\n\n409\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.090\nAnd so this is the formula\nyou're normally gonna use\n\n410\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.350\nunless you're in that window of time\nwhere you know you're in trouble.\n\n411\n00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.820\nAnd you're planning for that support\nchange ticket to update things.\n\n412\n00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.830\nThat's when you use this variation,\nall right?\n\n413\n00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.060\nAnd that's the only change,\n\n414\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.700\nis swapping from the BAC to\nthe EAC just for the accuracy.\n\n415\n00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.690\nYou still use BAC in the top part.\n\n416\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.930\nYou still use that budget\nat completion minus EV.\n\n417\n00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.060\nAnd the reason is,\n\n418\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.320\nyour earned value is calculated\nagainst your budget at completion.\n\n419\n00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.200\nIf you swap if for the EAC, your earned\nvalue is not calculated against an EAC and\n\n420\n00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.070\nnow that's not accurate.\n\n421\n00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.211\nSo that's why you've got to keep that\nbudget at completion up at the top,\n\n422\n00:20:22.211 --> 00:20:22.725\nall right?\n\n423\n00:20:22.725 --> 00:20:24.238\nSo if we implement this,\n\n424\n00:20:24.238 --> 00:20:27.560\nwe can get a better picture\nof how our project is going.\n\n425\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.414\nAnd so here we've just got an example of,\nyou're a new project manager.\n\n426\n00:20:31.414 --> 00:20:35.199\nYou've been assigned to a project that\nit's at risk and you need to salvage it,\n\n427\n00:20:35.199 --> 00:20:36.180\nall right?\n\n428\n00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.720\nThere's five activities that\nare going on right now, so\n\n429\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.140\nfive simultaneous activities that are all\nin some various state of completion.\n\n430\n00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.980\nThere's stuff that's already done, there's\nstuff that hasn't even been started yet.\n\n431\n00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.610\nBut these five are the activities\nthat are running right now.\n\n432\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.210\nAnd the old project manager, on their way\nout the door, they give you the project\n\n433\n00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.680\nbook, and you can see the latest status\nreports on each of these activities.\n\n434\n00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.036\nHe gave you the earned value, the actual\ncost, the budget at completion, and\n\n435\n00:21:00.036 --> 00:21:01.885\neven an estimate at completion.\n\n436\n00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:04.957\nBecause they knew the project was in\ntrouble, that we were gonna need to\n\n437\n00:21:04.957 --> 00:21:08.360\ntake action, so they took the time to\ncalculate the EAC out for us, all right?\n\n438\n00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.170\nNow, that doesn't always happen, and so\n\n439\n00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.880\nwe'll see how to calculate\nEAC in a little bit.\n\n440\n00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.040\nBut for right now,\nwe've basically got that kind of out here.\n\n441\n00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.480\nBut what they didn't do is they\ndidn't give us a TCPI, and so\n\n442\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.270\nwe need to calculate that.\n\n443\n00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:23.120\nWe need to find out what our to-complete\nperformance index is going to be.\n\n444\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.760\nAnd we just break out our formula.\n\n445\n00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.810\nNow, if we know things\nare still on track for\n\n446\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.820\nthe budget, we can leave with the BAC,\nwe can stick with that.\n\n447\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.900\nBut if we know things are in trouble,\nwe can swap it out for the EAC.\n\n448\n00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.926\nNow, looking at some of these,\n\n449\n00:21:36.926 --> 00:21:38.828\nyou'll notice there's not\nmuch of a difference, right?\n\n450\n00:21:38.828 --> 00:21:43.403\nLike if I look at task 1,\ntask 1 had an actual cost of $20,000 and\n\n451\n00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:48.586\na budget at completion of $20,000 and\nan earned value of $20,500.\n\n452\n00:21:48.586 --> 00:21:52.300\nThis one is basically done, right?\n\n453\n00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.200\nIf my earned value is exceeding my\nbudget at completion, this task is done.\n\n454\n00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.137\nOr at least it should be, right?\n\n455\n00:21:57.137 --> 00:22:00.242\nIf these people are still sending me\nstatus reports, like, they're still doing\n\n456\n00:22:00.242 --> 00:22:03.360\nwork, I need to find out what's going on\nthere because this activity looks done.\n\n457\n00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:08.115\nBut if you take some of these other ones,\nlike this guy has an actual cost of\n\n458\n00:22:08.115 --> 00:22:10.290\n$40,000 and\na budget at completion of $60,000.\n\n459\n00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.770\nSo I've still got a ways to go,\nthis is still an ongoing activity.\n\n460\n00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:18.380\nBut I can see I've only earned $38,000 out\nof the $40,000 that I've already spent, so\n\n461\n00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.930\nthings are not in line.\n\n462\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.860\nAnd when they calculate it\nan estimate at complete,\n\n463\n00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.360\nthey're showing it will complete\nat $2,000 over budget, which is\n\n464\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.890\nexactly the difference here between our EV\nand AC, so that's not to be unexpected.\n\n465\n00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.849\nYou'll see some of the other things where\nit looks like we're coming in under\n\n466\n00:22:32.849 --> 00:22:36.035\nbudget, right, where we had a budget\nat completion for task 3 of 95,000 and\n\n467\n00:22:36.035 --> 00:22:39.569\nan EAC showing that we're estimating we're\nactually going to complete at 90,000.\n\n468\n00:22:39.569 --> 00:22:41.560\nSo $5,000 under budget.\n\n469\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.720\nSo you'll see these little\nvariations through here.\n\n470\n00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.300\nWell, how do I know which ones\nare truly significant and\n\n471\n00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.776\nwhich ones aren't, because\nthe numbers are so different, right?\n\n472\n00:22:49.776 --> 00:22:52.445\n12,500 compared to 38,000.\n\n473\n00:22:52.445 --> 00:22:53.600\nThat's a huge difference.\n\n474\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.680\nIt's like three times\nthe size of activity 5.\n\n475\n00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.610\nSo it's hard to compare those two.\n\n476\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.940\nBut when we calculate the TCPI,\nit becomes easy to compare them, right?\n\n477\n00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.480\nAnd we can just run right\ndown the list and compare it.\n\n478\n00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:10.180\nNow, the hard part for us here is,\nis the budget at completion shot?\n\n479\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.070\nIf I'm a new project manager and\nI'm coming into this and\n\n480\n00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.830\nkind of evaluating it,\nI'll actually run with the BAC anyway.\n\n481\n00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.860\nBecause I don't necessarily know if\nthe budget at completion is shot.\n\n482\n00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.150\nThis will tell me.\n\n483\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.170\nAnd then if I see that things are really\nbad, then I might come back and\n\n484\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.660\nrerun it with the EAC afterwards instead,\nokay?\n\n485\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.940\nBut a lot of times I'll run with the BAC\nbecause that's what I've got to work on.\n\n486\n00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.550\nI've been brought in to\nsalvage this project,\n\n487\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.852\nthese are the numbers\nI've gotta work with.\n\n488\n00:23:34.852 --> 00:23:37.800\nI gotta work with my plan, right,\ncuz I know the plan's approved.\n\n489\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.700\nI can't work on some change ticket\nthat hasn't even been written yet.\n\n490\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.240\nSo that's what EACs are all about.\n\n491\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.938\nSo I'm gonna run through the formula here\nand kind of figure each one of these out.\n\n492\n00:23:46.938 --> 00:23:50.580\nSo if we start with just task 1,\nwe need our budget at completion,\n\n493\n00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.588\nwe need our earned value,\nand we need our actual cost.\n\n494\n00:23:53.588 --> 00:23:55.964\nAnd so we've got all three of\nthose values right there and\n\n495\n00:23:55.964 --> 00:23:58.600\nwe can start running through and\nfiguring out what our TCPI is.\n\n496\n00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.085\nSo starting here with our budget\nat completion of 20,000 minus\n\n497\n00:24:02.085 --> 00:24:04.376\nour earned value in it with negative 500.\n\n498\n00:24:04.376 --> 00:24:07.323\nAnd that's because this task\nis technically already done so\n\n499\n00:24:07.323 --> 00:24:09.660\nwe end up with a weird number, right.\n\n500\n00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.513\nAnd so we have negative 500 divided by the\nbudget at completion minus the actual cost\n\n501\n00:24:14.513 --> 00:24:15.253\nwhich is 0.\n\n502\n00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:18.370\nSo I have negative 500 divided by 0.\n\n503\n00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:19.850\nRonnie, do you know what that's gonna be?\n\n504\n00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.213\n>> That should be a 0,\nI believe is what's it's gonna be,\n\n505\n00:24:22.213 --> 00:24:23.318\n>> It's gonna be a 0,\n\n506\n00:24:23.318 --> 00:24:26.020\nor is a negative number\ndivided by 0 imaginary?\n\n507\n00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.220\nNo, no, it's.\n\n508\n00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.560\n>> It's just really not a number, yeah.\n\n509\n00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.544\n>> So anyhow, we'll find out when a 0,\n\n510\n00:24:30.544 --> 00:24:33.220\nit's a 0 because this activity's done,\nright?\n\n511\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.170\nSo the to complete performance index,\nwe've already kind of passed that point so\n\n512\n00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:38.870\nyou expect to get an odd number like that.\n\n513\n00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.880\nEven if I ran the EAC, you see that\nthe BAC and EAC, they're the same.\n\n514\n00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.958\nSo it's not gonna make any difference.\n\n515\n00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.030\nAll right, but when we start to\nget to some of these other ones,\n\n516\n00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.950\nthat's where we're gonna see\nvariations that actually matter, right.\n\n517\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.450\nSo if we start with activity two,\nwe take our BAC which is 60,000,\n\n518\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:57.560\nand we subtract our earned value, which is\n38,000, so we end up with $12,000, right?\n\n519\n00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.176\nSo we have 12,000 divided by\nour budget at completion,\n\n520\n00:25:01.176 --> 00:25:05.501\nwhich is 60,000, minus our actual cost,\nwhich is 40,000.\n\n521\n00:25:05.501 --> 00:25:06.562\nSo that leaves 20,000.\n\n522\n00:25:06.562 --> 00:25:09.337\nSo 12,000 divided by 20,000.\n\n523\n00:25:09.337 --> 00:25:10.480\nAnd so we fire that up.\n\n524\n00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.130\n>> You may have to do\nthe math on that one again.\n\n525\n00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.850\n>> Did I screw it up?\n\n526\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.710\n>> I think 60 minus 38 is\ngonna leave you with 22,000.\n\n527\n00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.427\n>> 22, shoot, it is 22,000.\n\n528\n00:25:19.427 --> 00:25:22.440\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> See, this is why\nwe use things like Microsoft Project.\n\n529\n00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.780\nSo all right,\nlet's not trust my math anymore.\n\n530\n00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.373\nAnd so we take that 60,000,\nwe subtract the 38,000,\n\n531\n00:25:28.373 --> 00:25:30.540\nand pretend like I paid\nattention in school.\n\n532\n00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.110\nSo 22,000, that's our top value.\n\n533\n00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.190\nAnd then our bottom one was budget\nat completion minus actual cost and\n\n534\n00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:37.300\nthat one is 20,000.\n\n535\n00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.240\nSo we'll divide that by 20,000,\nand we end up with 1.1.\n\n536\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.150\nSo a TCPI of 1.1, right?\n\n537\n00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.950\nIt looks like we're coming in\nover budget on this one, right?\n\n538\n00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:54.050\nSo, we have an actual cost of 40,000 but\nwe've only earned 38,000 so\n\n539\n00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.770\nthere's that disparity and it looks like\nwe're gonna be coming in over budget.\n\n540\n00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.930\nAll right, then as we look\nat some of these other ones,\n\n541\n00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.660\nwe can kinda run through\nthat same process.\n\n542\n00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.160\nAnd so I'll take budget at\ncompletion minus earned value so\n\n543\n00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.590\nit's gonna be $35,000.\n\n544\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.938\nAnd then I take my budget at\ncompletion and subtract my actual cost,\n\n545\n00:26:09.938 --> 00:26:15.220\nwhich is 95,000 minus 55,000,\nso that leaves 40,000 right?\n\n546\n00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.130\nSo, I've got 35,000 divided by 40,000 and\n\n547\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.884\ngives me a 0.875 which\nI'll round to a 0.86.\n\n548\n00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.780\nAnd I guess I should have carried this one\nout one more decimal just for accuracy.\n\n549\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.310\nI like to keep everything at\nthe same decimal places, that way,\n\n550\n00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.190\nyou have consistent numbers, anytime you\nround, you can start to have problems.\n\n551\n00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.568\nAll right, now we get to some\nsmaller numbers on this one.\n\n552\n00:26:36.568 --> 00:26:39.799\nBudget at completion of 24,000, we're\ngonna subtract out that earned value of\n\n553\n00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:42.990\n8,000, which should leave\nus with roughly 16,000.\n\n554\n00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:48.174\nAnd then our BAC of 24,000\nminus our AC of 9,500,\n\n555\n00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:55.100\nwhich is 24,000 minus 9,500,\nwhich leaves us 14,500.\n\n556\n00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:01.242\nSo we've got, let's see,\nI said it was 16,000 divided by 14,500\n\n557\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.870\nWhich is gonna give us a 1.103,\nwhich I'll round to a 1.10.\n\n558\n00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:07.951\nAll right.\n\n559\n00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:12.153\nAnd then lastly,\nwe can look at activity five here,\n\n560\n00:27:12.153 --> 00:27:16.010\nwe got a budget at completion of 15,000.\n\n561\n00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.040\nOur actual cost is 14,000,\nour EV is 12,500.\n\n562\n00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.210\nSo, BAC minus EV is gonna give us 2,500.\n\n563\n00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:27.909\nAnd then BAC minus AC\nis gonna give us 1,000.\n\n564\n00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:31.840\nAnd so 2,500 divided by 1,000 is a 2.5.\n\n565\n00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.910\nThat is a significant difference, right.\n\n566\n00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.740\nActually, that's too significant.\n\n567\n00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.976\nDid I screw up the math again?\n\n568\n00:27:40.976 --> 00:27:42.665\n15,000 minus 12,500 is 2,500.\n\n569\n00:27:42.665 --> 00:27:48.678\n15,000 minus 14,000 is 1,000 so\nyep, that is that far off.\n\n570\n00:27:48.678 --> 00:27:51.406\nAll right, yeah, pretty unusual\nto get a number that high, so\n\n571\n00:27:51.406 --> 00:27:53.270\nthat's why I just double checked my math.\n\n572\n00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.790\nAnd you should do that on the exam too if\nyour numbers seem disproportionately off.\n\n573\n00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.633\nYou'll want to reevaluate that,\nso taking away this,\n\n574\n00:27:59.633 --> 00:28:03.400\nit becomes pretty obvious where I\nneed to focus my efforts, right?\n\n575\n00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.060\nWhat we're looking for\nis who is in the most risk, right,\n\n576\n00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.520\nwhere we need to focus our resources.\n\n577\n00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.610\nIf I have a limited reserve,\nwhere am I gonna spend my reserve, right?\n\n578\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:14.580\nAnd we've got to evaluate what we've got.\n\n579\n00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.160\nThere's some things like this guy with the\nTCPI of 0, where you can just ignore it.\n\n580\n00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.670\nI mean,\nyou just put that one out of your mind.\n\n581\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.670\nIt's a 0, it's fine, right?\n\n582\n00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:28.627\nBut then, I've got two that are 10%\nover and one that's 14% under.\n\n583\n00:28:28.627 --> 00:28:31.530\n14% under is kind of a good\nproblem to have, right,\n\n584\n00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.280\nit means that we're gonna spend less.\n\n585\n00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.554\nOur budget at completion was 95,000,\n\n586\n00:28:35.554 --> 00:28:37.170\nit looks like we're gonna\nend that one at 90,000.\n\n587\n00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.670\nThat means we have extra money that we\nmight be able to assign somewhere else.\n\n588\n00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.855\nBut there's probably a reason why we have\nthat extra money and we need to go and\n\n589\n00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:44.443\nfind out why.\n\n590\n00:28:44.443 --> 00:28:45.989\nSo it's not necessarily a good thing,\nright.\n\n591\n00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.880\nBut when you're talking about 10% or\n14%, those are pretty big numbers.\n\n592\n00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.440\nI'd be concerned about any one of these,\nall right.\n\n593\n00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:59.190\nBut this last one, that number,\nthat TCPI is so far off.\n\n594\n00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.307\nYou're talking just a significant\namount off that I mean,\n\n595\n00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:05.626\nI still feel like I've done my math wrong,\nit's that far off.\n\n596\n00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:08.330\nSo when it's that far off,\nwe've got a real problem.\n\n597\n00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.115\nAnd the number is so\n\n598\n00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:12.070\nsignificantly higher that I don't\neven feel it's accurate anymore.\n\n599\n00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.860\nAnd so this is a great example\nwhere we say, you know what?\n\n600\n00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:20.410\nThat BAC is just shot, there is no\nway we're coming in at $15,000.\n\n601\n00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:25.138\nWe've already spent\n$14,000 of our 15,000 BAC.\n\n602\n00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:30.500\nAnd we have not achieved\n$14,000 of earned value, right?\n\n603\n00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.500\nWe're at 12,500.\n\n604\n00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.860\nSo it's off enough that we know\nthat one's gonna have to change.\n\n605\n00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.260\nSo this is where I'd come back and\ntake any one that's in risk and\n\n606\n00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.700\nrun it against the EAC and figure out what\nkind of change ticket I need to run, and\n\n607\n00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.380\nI'd probably focus on these two guys here.\n\n608\n00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.090\nLet's just take task 5\nhere as our first one.\n\n609\n00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.225\nSo we would take our budget at\ncompletion minus our earned value, so\n\n610\n00:29:50.225 --> 00:29:53.370\n15,000 minus 12,500 so\nwe get that 2,500 again.\n\n611\n00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.953\nBut on the bottom,\ninstead of doing our BAC,\n\n612\n00:29:56.953 --> 00:30:01.406\nwe'll do our EAC, 16,500 minus 14,000.\n\n613\n00:30:01.406 --> 00:30:05.005\nAnd when I do that, I end up with $2,500.\n\n614\n00:30:05.005 --> 00:30:07.910\nSo 2,500 divided by 2,500 is a 1.\n\n615\n00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:13.066\nThat would bring my TCPI back to a 1,\nwhich is exactly where you\n\n616\n00:30:13.066 --> 00:30:17.950\nwant it to be, well, not exactly,\n0 is perfect, right?\n\n617\n00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.870\nSo a 1 is still high, but for\n\n618\n00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.130\nsomething that's not completed yet,\nit means that you're on schedule,\n\n619\n00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.880\nthat you're on budget where you should be,\nright.\n\n620\n00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.580\nAnd that makes sense.\n\n621\n00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.760\nThat's our estimate at complete.\n\n622\n00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.520\nIf you get 0, you're done.\n\n623\n00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.030\nBut if you get anything near a 1,\nthat's where you wanna be.\n\n624\n00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.030\nSo if this results in a 1, that's perfect.\n\n625\n00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.715\nI could do a change ticket and say, hey,\nguys, we need to take the budget for\n\n626\n00:30:40.715 --> 00:30:43.381\nactivity 5, and\njust plan on it being 16,500.\n\n627\n00:30:43.381 --> 00:30:46.801\nAnd if we've got the reserves to\ncover that, if we get it approved,\n\n628\n00:30:46.801 --> 00:30:50.040\nthat becomes the new BAC and\nthis activity is now fine.\n\n629\n00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.870\nRight, the danger is gone,\nbut we spent more money.\n\n630\n00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.180\nIf a project sponsor comes and\nsays no, you had this plan,\n\n631\n00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.050\nyou've gotta come in on this plan,\nnow we've gotta find a way\n\n632\n00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.630\nto bring more resources into this thing\nto get those numbers back in line.\n\n633\n00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:05.730\nAnd we may or may not be able to do that.\n\n634\n00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.830\nAnd if we can't do it,\nthen our project is doomed to fail, right?\n\n635\n00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.050\nAnd we'll know exactly why.\n\n636\n00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.560\nIt's this activity.\n\n637\n00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.070\n>> All right, Don.\n\n638\n00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:16.290\nSo this idea of forecasting really does\nhelp us out when we are in the middle of\n\n639\n00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.200\na project, trying to figure out\nwhere we need to actually be.\n\n640\n00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.018\nIf we don't really have that in hand\nas far as the budget at completion, so\n\n641\n00:31:23.018 --> 00:31:27.207\nwe may actually try to follow that along\nand see if we can bring under completion,\n\n642\n00:31:27.207 --> 00:31:29.930\nbut we may also end up seeing\nthat it's shot as well.\n\n643\n00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.200\nAnd that way, we need to go and\nactually do a little bit more math,\n\n644\n00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.487\nfigure out that actually to\ncompletion cost performance index.\n\n645\n00:31:36.487 --> 00:31:40.638\nAnd then we can compare that against other\nthings inside of our project here to see\n\n646\n00:31:40.638 --> 00:31:43.280\nwhere we need to spend\na little bit more time.\n\n647\n00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.650\nDon, any last words on this?\n\n648\n00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.240\nIt didn't seem that complex\nas we were going through it.\n\n649\n00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.895\nBut the math like you said,\nwhen you do that, you kind of go,\n\n650\n00:31:50.895 --> 00:31:53.905\nwait a minute, how many times\ncan I do that math over again?\n\n651\n00:31:53.905 --> 00:31:55.555\nBut on the exam that's gonna be important.\n\n652\n00:31:55.555 --> 00:31:58.875\nDo you think you might get that skewed\nwhen you face that on the exam?\n\n653\n00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:00.795\n>> You may well, and\nthat's their way of testing you, right?\n\n654\n00:32:00.795 --> 00:32:03.722\nCuz the real challenge here,\nanybody can memorize formulas, but\n\n655\n00:32:03.722 --> 00:32:06.502\nwhen you have more than one formula,\nknowing which one to use.\n\n656\n00:32:06.502 --> 00:32:08.355\nAnd that's where it makes a difference.\n\n657\n00:32:08.355 --> 00:32:09.780\nAnd you'll notice on task 5,\n\n658\n00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.600\nI ended up using both formulas to make\nsure that I was in the right area.\n\n659\n00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.090\nSo those are definitely important.\n\n660\n00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.780\nAnd also keep in mind that we\ntalked a bit about EAC, but\n\n661\n00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.720\nwe still haven't calculated that.\n\n662\n00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.220\nSo we'll see that in another episode.\n\n663\n00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.600\nBut those are kinda the key components\nthere and what you're gonna have to have.\n\n664\n00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.190\n>> All right, so\n\n665\n00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.270\nwe're looking forward to actually taking\na look at that EAC in a future episode.\n\n666\n00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.110\nThat's a great place for\nus to go and end this episode then.\n\n667\n00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.570\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong,\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n668\n00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:35.730\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:18.850\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're gonna be taking a look at the PMP,\n\n4\n00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.350\nthe Project Management Professional.\n\n5\n00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.100\nWe're specifically gonna get\ninto the realm of forecasting.\n\n6\n00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.880\nWe've already taken a look at\na little bit of forecasting,\n\n7\n00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.700\ntalking about a couple\nof different formulas.\n\n8\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.760\nBut that's when everything is going OK,\nand\n\n9\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.660\nyou think that you can still reign it in.\n\n10\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.960\nSometimes though,\nwe need to actually go beyond that, and\n\n11\n00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.560\nwho better to help us, than Mr.\nDon Pizet himself.\n\n12\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.440\nHow's it going Don?\n\n13\n00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.500\n>> It's going great, Ronnie, ready to jump\nright back in the world of forecasting,\n\n14\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.360\nand if you haven't\nwatched the last episode,\n\n15\n00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.020\ndefinitely check out our part one.\n\n16\n00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.690\nThis is part two to forecasting.\n\n17\n00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.820\nAnd in that episode we talked\nabout some interesting formulas.\n\n18\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.430\nAnd e saw estimate two complete and we did\na two complete performance index, a TCPI.\n\n19\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.780\nAnd while we were doing the TCPI,\nI mentioned a new value,\n\n20\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.230\nI mentioned EAC, right?\n\n21\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.770\nThe estimate add completion and EAC is\nan important one because it's estimating\n\n22\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.440\nwhat you think your total budget is going\nto be when an activity completes or\n\n23\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.910\nwhen your whole project completes.\n\n24\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.230\nSo, that's important, but we hadn't\nreally looked at the formulas yet.\n\n25\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.080\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna look at those formulas.\n\n26\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.660\nAnd notice how I'm saying those formulas.\n\n27\n00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.160\nEAC's a tricky one.\n\n28\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.930\nThere is one formula for EAC,\nand we're gonna see that.\n\n29\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.680\nBut, like Ronnie said, if things aren't\ngoing right, there's all sorts of\n\n30\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.440\nconditions that can change, and\nyour EAC number becomes garbage.\n\n31\n00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.340\nAnd so, there's actually three variations\nof EAC that we can run through.\n\n32\n00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.180\nAnd so at the end of the day,\nthere's four different formulas.\n\n33\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.970\nNow on the exam,\n\n34\n00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.810\nif they just give you some numbers and\ntell you to calculate the EAC, then\n\n35\n00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.580\nthere really is just one formula you need\nto remember, the main formula for EAC.\n\n36\n00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.820\nBut if they start giving you a story,\nyou know one of those word problems,\n\n37\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.610\nwhere they start explaining a situation\nthat's going in on the project,\n\n38\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.750\nwell that's normally a hint to you\nsaying this is a variation and so\n\n39\n00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.340\nyou to use one of those variations of EAC.\n\n40\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.030\nSo were gonna take a look at each one but\nlet's just start with straight up EAC and\n\n41\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.150\nhow it worked.\n\n42\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.290\nThe formula itself for\n\n43\n00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.560\nEAC I've got it pulled here,\nit's actually straight forward.\n\n44\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.050\nIt's basically saying if you wanna\nestimate how much you're gonna spend at\n\n45\n00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.372\ncompletion, well if your project is\ngoing exactly the way it suppose to,\n\n46\n00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:21.300\nthen your EAC is simply\ngoing to equal your BAC.\n\n47\n00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.820\nYour budget at completion, your BAC,\n\n48\n00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.300\nthat's what you plan to\nspend at completion.\n\n49\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.540\nYour estimate at completion\nshould be the same thing.\n\n50\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.400\nWe estimate we're gonna finish\nexactly what we plan, and that's that.\n\n51\n00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.910\nYou don't even need a formula for\n\n52\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.570\nthat if everything is going\nthe way it's supposed to.\n\n53\n00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.710\nBut if you're not sure,\n\n54\n00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.310\nif you don't know things are going\nthe way there supposed to.\n\n55\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.320\nYou take your actual cost.\n\n56\n00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.300\nSo how much money have you spent so far?\n\n57\n00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.070\nWhatever that actual cost is, and you\nadd to it what's called a Bottom Up ETC.\n\n58\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.800\nNow we saw ETCs in the last episode,\nright?\n\n59\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.040\nEstimate to complete.\n\n60\n00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.049\nHow much more money we need to\nspend to complete an activity.\n\n61\n00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.550\nWell that estimate to complete\ncan be pretty accurate.\n\n62\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.060\nWe saw that.\n\n63\n00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.910\nIt can be inaccurate too and so\nyou have variations of ETC also.\n\n64\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.730\nBut it's normally pretty accurate.\n\n65\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.030\nBut what's a bottom up ETC?\n\n66\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.770\nWell that means I have to go out to all\nof my task holders, all the people who\n\n67\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.120\nare doing the work on my project and I\nhave to get an ETC from every one of them.\n\n68\n00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.970\nAnd it's bottom up.\n\n69\n00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.270\nI start at the base layer of that\nwork breakdown structure, and\n\n70\n00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.540\nI give an estimate to complete.\n\n71\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.410\nAnd I move up to the next tier and\nup to the next tier, and\n\n72\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.929\nI consolidate it all down to a milestone,\nor a deliverable.\n\n73\n00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:30.150\nAnd I say, here's the estimate to complete\nfor this deliverable and this deliverable.\n\n74\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.680\nAnd you add all that up to get your whole\nproject, if that's the way you're going.\n\n75\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.840\nOr you can do this on\nan individual activity.\n\n76\n00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.920\nIt's up to you,\nhow you want to measure that.\n\n77\n00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.530\nBut a bottom up ETC is where you\nget an estimate to complete for\n\n78\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.680\nevery single activity that's\nongoing right now in your project.\n\n79\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.500\nIf you've got a small project,\nthat's no big deal.\n\n80\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.310\nYou just go and talk to a couple\nof people and you get the numbers.\n\n81\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.250\nBut if you've got a massive project\ninvolving thousands of people and\n\n82\n00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.100\nnumerous simultaneous tasks,\nthis can be pretty hard data to get.\n\n83\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.490\nSo sometimes you're in a hurry, and\n\n84\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.720\nthere's things that we can substitute\nout instead of the this Bottom Up ETC.\n\n85\n00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.950\nBut the basic formula, the most important\none for you to remember, is that EAC\n\n86\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.080\nequals your actual cost plus\na Bottom Up ETC for your project.\n\n87\n00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.610\nSo let's take a look at an example.\n\n88\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.600\nHere I've got a project.\n\n89\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.050\nRight.\nAnd it says you are becoming concerned\n\n90\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.050\nthat your project may finish over\nits 350 thousand dollar budget.\n\n91\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.850\nSo, right there I've got a BAC, right?\n\n92\n00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.320\nMy budget at completion\nis 350 thousand dollars.\n\n93\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.515\nYou have requested ETCs for\nall active tasks.\n\n94\n00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:34.230\nI reached out to all my task workers and\nI said give me your estimate to complete.\n\n95\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.910\nWe need to generate an EAC so that we can\nreport it to the primary stakeholders.\n\n96\n00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.480\nWe need to let them know what our\nestimate at completion is gonna be.\n\n97\n00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.120\nHopefully it matches our budget.\n\n98\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.500\nAnd so we've got the ETCs for\neverything that's active.\n\n99\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.110\nNow if I was just doing this for\na particular activity that's all I need.\n\n100\n00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.180\nBut if I want the project as\na whole I need to remember\n\n101\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.590\nthat there's activities that\nhave already completed.\n\n102\n00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.850\nI don't need an ETC from somebody\nthat's already completed.\n\n103\n00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:57.680\nI don't need an estimate.\n\n104\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.870\nI have the factual data.\n\n105\n00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.560\nSo I go and get my actual cost for\nthat, right?\n\n106\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.360\nSo here's my project cost to date.\n\n107\n00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.790\nAnd my budget for activities that haven't\neven started, I don't need an ETC for\n\n108\n00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.080\nsomething that hasn't even started,\nbecause I just use the plan.\n\n109\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.770\nWhatever's in the plan is\nwhat I'm gonna go with.\n\n110\n00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.410\nSo there's stuff outside\nof what's currently active.\n\n111\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.680\nBut here's the four activities for me\nthat are currently active right now, and\n\n112\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.470\ntheir estimate to completes.\n\n113\n00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.030\nSo when I wanna find out my EAC,\nmy estimate at completion,\n\n114\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.009\nI need to take my actual cost,\nwhat I've spent so far, and\n\n115\n00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:36.890\na bottom up ETC from everybody else\nthat's out there, and add them together.\n\n116\n00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.722\nMy actual cost is $200 thousand.\n\n117\n00:05:38.722 --> 00:05:41.469\nI've actually spent $200\nthousand at this point.\n\n118\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.640\nThen I need by Bottom-Up ETCs, my\nestimates to complete for everybody else.\n\n119\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.666\nWell, I've got my estimates\nto complete right here.\n\n120\n00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:51.560\n7,000, 2,000, 24,000, 3,000.\n\n121\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.810\nNow notice, they're not telling\nme what their costs are.\n\n122\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.230\nI don't know their earned values or\nactual costs.\n\n123\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.540\nWell, we've got Project Costs to Date.\n\n124\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.250\nThat's my whole project.\n\n125\n00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.350\nThat would include the expenses that\nI've already spent on these activities.\n\n126\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.970\nThis is my ETC,\nwhat they're gonna need past that, right?\n\n127\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.803\nBut what about this over here, budget for\nactivities that haven't even begun yet?\n\n128\n00:06:11.803 --> 00:06:14.660\nWell we count those as ETCs.\n\n129\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.500\nThose are estimates to complete.\n\n130\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.440\nThey are estimates, right?\n\n131\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.550\nWe created them back in the plan.\n\n132\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.420\nThey haven't actually started,\nso I don't have to collect them,\n\n133\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.680\nI just use the plan data,\nbut it's right here.\n\n134\n00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.600\nSo I'm gonna add up all of my ETCs and\nthe budget for\n\n135\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.660\nany activity that hasn't started.\n\n136\n00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.500\nI'm gonna treat those as ETCs.\n\n137\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.390\nAnd that is how much more I think\nI'm gonna have to spend to finish\n\n138\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.920\nthis project.\n\n139\n00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.130\nAnd then I combine that with\nwhat I've already spent, and\n\n140\n00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.110\nI'll have my estimate at completion, what\nI think that full expense is going to be.\n\n141\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.720\nSo if we work this out,\nthe math starts to escape me, right?\n\n142\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.430\nSo our actual cost is easy,\nthat's 200 thousand.\n\n143\n00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.638\nWe know what our actual cost is.\n\n144\n00:06:47.638 --> 00:06:55.100\nBut then I need to add my ETCs, right?\n\n145\n00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:01.200\nSo my EAC is going to equal $200 thousand\nplus all of these other ones summed up.\n\n146\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.870\nSo I'm going to break out my\nfriendly calculator here.\n\n147\n00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.000\nAnd we'll sum all these up.\n\n148\n00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.806\nSo-\n>> It would be 136 thousand.\n\n149\n00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:08.490\nI believe.\n\n150\n00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.580\n>> Your math skills\nRonnie far exceed mine.\n\n151\n00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.780\nSo let's just run this\nthrough a calculator.\n\n152\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.580\nAnd we'll say 100,000 right,\ncuz that's the budget for\n\n153\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.297\nstuff I haven't even started yet.\n\n154\n00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:20.559\n7,000 for activity 1.1.7.\n\n155\n00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:23.280\nWe got 2,000 for activity 3.2.\n\n156\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.226\nWe've got 24 thousand for activity 4.5 and\n\n157\n00:07:28.226 --> 00:07:33.860\n3,000 for activity 4.6,\nand you were right.\n\n158\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:40.265\nSo, it is 136 thousand is what my current\nETC is, so I can punch that in here.\n\n159\n00:07:40.265 --> 00:07:43.420\n136 thousand dollars.\n\n160\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.223\nAll right, remember the hundred\nthousand coming from here, and\n\n161\n00:07:45.223 --> 00:07:46.354\n36 thousand ETCs from what I got open.\n\n162\n00:07:46.354 --> 00:07:50.292\nWell if I add those together,\n\n163\n00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:56.128\nI end up with a nice cool $336 thousand.\n\n164\n00:07:56.128 --> 00:07:59.729\nNow my fear was that we were gonna\nexceed my $350 thousand budget,\n\n165\n00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.795\nnow that I've seen this We're\ngonna come in under budget.\n\n166\n00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:06.827\nNow you get an all new fear of what work\nhasn't been done that was supposed to\n\n167\n00:08:06.827 --> 00:08:07.340\nbe done?\n\n168\n00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.530\nWhy are we ahead like this?\n\n169\n00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.120\nWho knows.\n\n170\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.610\nMaybe I had $14,000 in reserves\nbaked into the project or something.\n\n171\n00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.980\nI don't know, if you padded your numbers,\nwhich you shouldn't do that, but\n\n172\n00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.380\nmaybe that explains it.\n\n173\n00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.070\nWe need to go find out why, but the point\nis I now have an estimate to complete for\n\n174\n00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.260\nmy project.\n\n175\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.980\nAnd I'm showing I'm in pretty good shape.\n\n176\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.940\nI wanna be under budget right?\n\n177\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.320\nThat's what an EAC can do and\nit's pretty common sense right?\n\n178\n00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.050\nWe're just taking\nthe numbers that we've got.\n\n179\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.990\nThe numbers that we know are fact and\nthen we're factoring in estimates.\n\n180\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.340\nEither estimates that people\nare giving us right now or\n\n181\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.180\nestimates that we came up with back in the\nproject plan, well we're combining it all\n\n182\n00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.100\ntogether to create that final\nestimate of where we're gonna end up.\n\n183\n00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.040\nAnd here my EAC is $336,000 dollars.\n\n184\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.980\nNow I need this for\nthe whole project, right?\n\n185\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.100\nIf I just did a single activity, like if\nI took Activity 1.1.7, I could go and\n\n186\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.500\nfind the actual cost for 1.1.7.\n\n187\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:06.730\nAnd I could add the ETC for 1.1.7, and\nthen I would have the EAC just for 1.1.7.\n\n188\n00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.510\nSo you can calculate it on\na single activity if you want, and\n\n189\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.220\nyou get that EAC for it.\n\n190\n00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.880\nAnd you might need that when you're\nrunning some of the other formulas that\n\n191\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.970\nare out there.\n\n192\n00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.230\nBut usually we do it for\na project as a whole.\n\n193\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.030\nAnd the real challenge with this\nis simply getting the data,\n\n194\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.950\ngetting an estimate to complete for\neverybody.\n\n195\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.690\nSo imagine going to all of\nthe people who are in the field,\n\n196\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.000\nwho are actually doing the work,\nall the contractors or whoever and\n\n197\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.340\nsaying I need that estimate to\ncomplete for what you're doing.\n\n198\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.900\nHow much more money do you\nthink you're gonna spend?\n\n199\n00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.030\nAnd calculate it out as you know,\n\n200\n00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.170\ndollars like this cause you gotta\nfactor in hours and all that.\n\n201\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.620\nThis is really earned value.\n\n202\n00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.100\nSo calculate that out and\nturn it back in to me.\n\n203\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.690\nIt's a lot of burden,\nit's a lot of effort.\n\n204\n00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.080\nSo we don't like to pull\nthis if we don't have to and\n\n205\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.090\nthat's why we have some more\nother variations of this.\n\n206\n00:09:51.272 --> 00:09:53.510\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat one of those variations.\n\n207\n00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.230\nThe first variation is\nthis guy right here.\n\n208\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.790\nOkay?\n\n209\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.030\nNow notice what we're doing.\n\n210\n00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.450\nInstead of doing actual\ncost plus a bottom up ETC,\n\n211\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.122\nhere it's actual cost plus budgeted\ncompletion minus earn value.\n\n212\n00:10:06.122 --> 00:10:09.360\nAll right, what's going on here?\n\n213\n00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.450\nWe're swapping out the ETC,\nthe bottom up ETC.\n\n214\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.620\nWe're taking that out and replacing\nthat with our budgeted completion,\n\n215\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.760\nwhat we plan to spend,\nminus our earned value,\n\n216\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.490\nwhich is what we've spent in\nterms of effort so far, right?\n\n217\n00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.160\nAnd earned value is more accurate than AC\nin this case, because it's taking into\n\n218\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.420\naccount schedule, where AC doesn't\ntake into account schedule so\n\n219\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.200\nwe're gonna factor that in and\ndetermine what's left for us to spend.\n\n220\n00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.840\nSo we end up with a number that's\nnot necessarily as accurate as\n\n221\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.810\nwhat we would have gotten a moment ago.\n\n222\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.540\nWhen you get those ETCs from the field,\n\n223\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.180\nthese are the people that\nare actually doing the work.\n\n224\n00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.460\nAnd they've got a good idea\nof how things are going and\n\n225\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.990\nhow much more they're going to need,\nright?\n\n226\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.490\nVersus this variation that's using a plan\nwe came up with potentially years ago.\n\n227\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.050\nThat isn't taking into account what\nis actually going on in the field.\n\n228\n00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.790\nSo it's less accurate, but\nthen it brings in earned value.\n\n229\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.390\nEarned value is calculated on\nwhat's actually happening, so\n\n230\n00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.180\nthat makes it a little\nmore accurate again.\n\n231\n00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.300\nOkay.\n\n232\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.120\nThe end result is you end\nup with an EAC that is\n\n233\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.350\npretty close to where you'd expect to be,\nright?\n\n234\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.760\nThat it's pretty close to where you\nthink you would be at on this anyway and\n\n235\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.065\nit's usually good enough.\n\n236\n00:11:20.065 --> 00:11:22.560\n[LAUGH] I hate saying that, right?\n\n237\n00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.170\nIt's good enough.\n\n238\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.070\nThis is normally the one\nthat I start with, right?\n\n239\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.960\nI don't necessarily want to go and\nget an ETC from everybody in the field.\n\n240\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.000\nI don't want to burden them with that.\n\n241\n00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.020\nThey've got their own work to do.\n\n242\n00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.320\nThey're already giving me status reports.\n\n243\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.660\nI have to be in a real situation to go and\nsay, all right, it's time we go out and\n\n244\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.030\nget those ETC's.\n\n245\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.800\nSo with this one we can use it.\n\n246\n00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.720\nWhen we've got good data, if we already\nhave our actual costs from accounting.\n\n247\n00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.800\nIf we already have our budgeted\ncompletion from our plan,\n\n248\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.680\nwhich you certainly should have If we've\nalready got our earned values from\n\n249\n00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.350\nstatus reports,\nwe can take the data we already have and\n\n250\n00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:00.140\nget results that are very close to what\nwe would get with a full bottom up ETC.\n\n251\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.140\nSo this is faster,\nit reduces the effort of getting ETCs.\n\n252\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.950\nAnd so I'll normally start with\nthis one and see the numbers I get.\n\n253\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.450\nAnd if I'm not happy with the numbers\nthen I go out and, alright guys\n\n254\n00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.290\nwe need to shore things up everybody turn\nin your ETC I need it by Friday, right?\n\n255\n00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.400\nAnd then we get the number that is\naccurate as it's going to get and\n\n256\n00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.520\nwe start to act on it.\n\n257\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.580\nBut if these numbers come back good, then\nI don't belabor the point I'm not going to\n\n258\n00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.680\nrequest an ETC from everybody when\nthe numbers are looking good, right?\n\n259\n00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.340\nSo the first variation is just sacrificing\na little bit of accuracy in exchange for\n\n260\n00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.360\nbeing able to reuse data that you normally\nalready have from your typical status\n\n261\n00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.890\nreports, right.\n\n262\n00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.460\nSo an example of this might be, like here,\nwe wanna get a ballpark EAC for\n\n263\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.270\nour project.\n\n264\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:47.310\nBut we don't wanna waste team resources\ncollecting ETCs from the task workers.\n\n265\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.180\nOur project budget is $250,000,\nthat's our BAC.\n\n266\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.570\nAnd our expenses to date are $175,000.\n\n267\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.110\nThat's gonna be our AC,\nor our actual cost.\n\n268\n00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.640\nThe EVs from your incoming status\nreports add up to $160,000.\n\n269\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.430\nSo we've totaled up the earned value from\nall of our various activities At $160,000,\n\n270\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.430\nwhat is our EAC?\n\n271\n00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:13.390\nWell, if we plug all that in,\nour EAC is gonna equal our actual cost.\n\n272\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.070\nSo $175,000 plus our budget at completion,\n\n273\n00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:22.890\nwhich is $250,000 minus our\nearned value which is $160,000.\n\n274\n00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.180\nNow, I already know I've\ngot a problem here.\n\n275\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.664\nBecause my earned value adds up to 160,000\nbut my current expenses are 175,000.\n\n276\n00:13:30.664 --> 00:13:33.860\nSo it doesn't take a wizard to figure out\nthis project has got some issues, but\n\n277\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.550\nwhen we calculate our\nestimate at completion,\n\n278\n00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.550\nwe should see that things aren't\npainting the greatest picture for us.\n\n279\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.020\nSo, let me just come in here and\nplug this in.\n\n280\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.930\nSo if I take $175,000 and\nI add $250,000 and\n\n281\n00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:56.956\nthen I subtract $160,000\nI end up with $265,000.\n\n282\n00:13:56.956 --> 00:13:57.581\nRight?\n\n283\n00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:00.710\nSo $265,000.\n\n284\n00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.790\nMy budget is $250,000.\n\n285\n00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.170\nMy estimated completion is $265,000,\nright?\n\n286\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.040\nI'm gonna be $15,000 over budget.\n\n287\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.330\nIs that good math, Tony?\n\n288\n00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:10.860\n>> Yeah.\n\n289\n00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.380\nIt is.\n\n290\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.660\n>> I saw you squinting your eyes.\n\n291\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.800\nI was like, shoot, I screwed something up.\n\n292\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.556\n>> If it was me it was $200,000.\n\n293\n00:14:16.556 --> 00:14:18.186\nI saw $200,000, not $250,000.\n\n294\n00:14:18.186 --> 00:14:19.550\n>> Okay.\nSo I'm going to\n\n295\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.280\nend up $15,000 over budget, right?\n\n296\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.050\nThat's what this estimate shows me.\n\n297\n00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.435\nAnd so that's a problem.\n\n298\n00:14:24.435 --> 00:14:25.890\n$15,000 is a lot of money.\n\n299\n00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.530\nSo, especially in the general\nscheme of this project here.\n\n300\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:34.160\nThat's a good, it's not 10%, it's what is\nthat end up being like 7% or something.\n\n301\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.230\nSo still a pretty good chunk, right?\n\n302\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.190\nSo I want to go in and\ntake corrective action and\n\n303\n00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.420\nthis might be the point where I say,\nyou know what?\n\n304\n00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.450\nTime to go collect some ETCs.\n\n305\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.310\nBecause when I have the ETCs, I can\nfigure out exactly who the problem is.\n\n306\n00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.650\nOr, honestly, I can just go and\nlook at my schedule or cost variance and\n\n307\n00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:49.520\nfind out there too.\n\n308\n00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.690\nThere's a few different ways you\ncan go and isolate the problem.\n\n309\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.680\nBut as a whole, I can see that my\nproject's not in the greatest shape,\n\n310\n00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.280\nit's not he healthiest\nproject in the world.\n\n311\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.800\nSo definitely something I wanna act on,\nbut it didn't require me going out and\n\n312\n00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.250\ngetting a bunch of ETCs to do it.\n\n313\n00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.480\nSo that's the first variation and\non the exam, what you're going to see\n\n314\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.980\nare questions that ask you to calculate\nin EAC and they're gonna give you values.\n\n315\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.090\nAnd you gotta look at the values\nthey give you and make do with it.\n\n316\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.300\nSo the questions will read like mine\ndid where they feed you data and\n\n317\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.370\nyou have to calculate in EAC.\n\n318\n00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.360\nWell, you got four different formulas for\nEAC, so you look at the data but\n\n319\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.060\nsometimes they give you\nmore than you need.\n\n320\n00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.580\nAnd so you gotta interpret the question\nto figure out the right formula.\n\n321\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.290\nAnd sometimes they don't\ngive you enough and so\n\n322\n00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.470\nthey usually put that answer on there,\nnot enough information provided.\n\n323\n00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.430\nAnd don't be scared to choose that,\nit is right sometimes.\n\n324\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.240\nAnd so if they just didn't give\nyou enough information for\n\n325\n00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.780\nany of the formulas, or maybe they\ndid give you enough information for\n\n326\n00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.330\none formula but they put a statement\nin here, like mine where it said\n\n327\n00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.490\nyou don't wanna waste resources by\ncollecting ETCs from the team, right?\n\n328\n00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.574\nBut maybe they give me enough information\nthat includes ETCs or something,\n\n329\n00:15:50.574 --> 00:15:52.558\nI guess that wouldn't make\na whole lot of sense.\n\n330\n00:15:52.558 --> 00:15:54.743\nBut if they did that,\nI still wouldn't wanna use that formula,\n\n331\n00:15:54.743 --> 00:15:56.007\ncuz they told me not to do it, right?\n\n332\n00:15:56.007 --> 00:15:59.692\nSo we just have to make sure we\ninterpret that question properly.\n\n333\n00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.562\nAll right, so that's variation number one.\n\n334\n00:16:01.562 --> 00:16:03.541\nThat one pretty much makes sense.\n\n335\n00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:05.780\nLet's take a look at variation number two.\n\n336\n00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.270\nVariation number two\ngets a little stranger.\n\n337\n00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.250\nAnd each of these variations has a name,\nright?\n\n338\n00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.850\nThe first variation,\nit's actually called EAC Forecast for\n\n339\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.340\nETC Work Performed at the Budgeted Rate.\n\n340\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.450\nAnd what they're saying here is,\ninstead of work performed with an estimate\n\n341\n00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.260\nto complete, it's the estimate to complete\nbeing calculated off of the budgeted rate.\n\n342\n00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.940\nThat's what we did,\nthat Budget At Completion minus EV.\n\n343\n00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.850\nSo that's the name of that one.\n\n344\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:33.650\nVariation Two is EAC forecast for\nETC work performed at the present CPI.\n\n345\n00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:34.260\nAll right?\n\n346\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:40.510\nSo instead of using the budgeted rate,\nwe're using the cost performance index.\n\n347\n00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.120\nWe've got this index that indicates\nhow we're doing in terms of cost.\n\n348\n00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.570\nWe can just use that to calculate\nout what our EAC is going to be.\n\n349\n00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.680\nThis is even less accurate\nthan variation one, though.\n\n350\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.870\nAnd so this one, on each of these I\nkind of put when you would use it.\n\n351\n00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:58.490\nOn the other one, I said the big advantage\nthat it, you would use it when you had\n\n352\n00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.010\ngood data, and you didn't want\nto bother everybody with ETCs.\n\n353\n00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.490\nThis one, variation two,\nwhen would you use it?\n\n354\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.380\nWhen you are in a hurry.\n\n355\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.030\nOkay, if you're in a hurry,\nyou just need a quick and\n\n356\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.680\ndirty number, this is the guy for you,\nright, you will use this formula.\n\n357\n00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.710\nIt's simple.\n\n358\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.690\nYour budgeted completion,\ndivided by your CPI, and\n\n359\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.380\nthat will give you your\nestimated completion.\n\n360\n00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.350\nIf your CPI is one,\nif you are perfectly on budget right?\n\n361\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.510\nThen your budgeted completion divided by\none is just your budgeted completion.\n\n362\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.270\nYour estimated completion now equals your\nbudgeted completion, you are perfect.\n\n363\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:35.470\nBut if your CPI is 1.1, or\nyour CPI is .90 Right, when\n\n364\n00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.570\nyou divide your budget at completion by\nthat, you're gonna get a different number.\n\n365\n00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.400\nAnd it's not gonna be incredibly accurate.\n\n366\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.340\nBut it's good enough to let you\nknow whether you're in trouble, or\n\n367\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.210\nwhether you're within that small window,\nwhere it's acceptable to vary, right?\n\n368\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.940\nSo we use this when we're in a hurry.\n\n369\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.720\nAnd typically this one is not used\nin any reports to give to people.\n\n370\n00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.260\nIt's just used for you to get a quick view\nof the project, and determine whether or\n\n371\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.650\nnot you need to go more in depth.\n\n372\n00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.250\nRight.\nSo\n\n373\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.790\nthis one is definitely\nwhen you're in a hurry.\n\n374\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.370\nBut you'll see, you can calculate EAC,\nwhich is two values.\n\n375\n00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.030\nYour budget completion, and\nyour cumulative CPI, right.\n\n376\n00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:12.080\nThe CPI for all of the work, to date,\nnot just that one reporting period.\n\n377\n00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.440\nSo, as an example, let's say that\nI've got a project like this, and\n\n378\n00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.250\nthey're telling me, we've been making\nchanges to bring our project back in line.\n\n379\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:20.810\nAll right?\n\n380\n00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.810\nSo we had a project that was\noff in our first example.\n\n381\n00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.170\nAnd so we've taken that first project, and\n\n382\n00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.740\nwe've made some changes to try and\nbring it back.\n\n383\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.210\nRemember in the first example\nwe were off by $15,000.\n\n384\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.780\nSo we've made some changes.\n\n385\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.530\nHopefully it's coming back in line.\n\n386\n00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.620\nAll right, we wanna figure out\nthe effectiveness of our change.\n\n387\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.190\nWe just wanna see if we can get it better,\n\n388\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.470\nif we've actually made\nthe improvements we need.\n\n389\n00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:48.480\nSo, we run some numbers and\nour current cumulative CPI is 0.96.\n\n390\n00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.400\nAll right, so if we're at a 0.96,\nwhat's our new estimated completion?\n\n391\n00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.790\nWell, if I was using my old formula.\n\n392\n00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.690\nI would need my earned values and\nmy actual costs and all that.\n\n393\n00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.470\nBut I don't necessarily have that here,\nand I'm just in a hurry.\n\n394\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.820\nSo I'm going to take the numbers I've got.\n\n395\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.390\nAnd I'm going to say that my EAC\n\n396\n00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.960\nis going to equal my budget of\ncompletion which is $250,000.\n\n397\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.510\nThat was from the first example.\n\n398\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.950\nAnd I'm going to divide that by\nmy current CPI, which is 0.96.\n\n399\n00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:24.770\nSo I made some changes, my CPI is now\n0.96, and we run that through our formula,\n\n400\n00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:30.990\n250,000 divided by 0.96,\nand I get 260,417 dollars.\n\n401\n00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:36.510\nSo that's gonna equal 260,000 and\n$417.00, right?\n\n402\n00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.208\n>> It's 17.\n>> $417, we'll get it sooner or later.\n\n403\n00:19:41.208 --> 00:19:45.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go, all right.\n\n404\n00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:51.261\nSo now we're at 200, and my touch pad's\ngoing crazy, we're at $260,000, okay.\n\n405\n00:19:51.261 --> 00:19:56.050\nSo when I ran it before\nwe were at $265,000.\n\n406\n00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.950\nWe made some changes to try and\nimprove things.\n\n407\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.570\nAnd when I ran my quick formula,\nwe get 260,000.\n\n408\n00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:09.700\nSo we did go from 265 down to 260,\nright, so I'm a little bit back in line.\n\n409\n00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.890\nBut I'm still not perfect,\nI'm still off by $10,000.\n\n410\n00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.760\nSo we have made an improvement, but\nit's not necessarily enough, so\n\n411\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.940\nwe continue making more improvements.\n\n412\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.810\nNow because we're using cumulative CPI,\n\n413\n00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.960\nimprovements don't necessarily\nshow up right away.\n\n414\n00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.540\nAnd when we covered ETC,\nI kinda talked about that a little bit,\n\n415\n00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.170\nthat sometimes you might want to throw\nout your CPI, cuz it's cumulative for\n\n416\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.290\nthe whole thing to date.\n\n417\n00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.570\nSo the bad times are still\nreported in your CPI.\n\n418\n00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.525\nAnd so this formula might not be\nthe most accurate in that scenario,\n\n419\n00:20:38.525 --> 00:20:40.450\nit's very hard to see those changes.\n\n420\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.390\nBut if that's all the information we have,\nat least we can get a ball park and\n\n421\n00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.120\nthen we can go and act upon it.\n\n422\n00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.260\nAnd we can go get more detailed\ninformation or whatever.\n\n423\n00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.790\nSo that's two variations of the formula.\n\n424\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.640\nThere's one more that I\nwant to show you guys, and\n\n425\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.530\nthis one is interesting because\nthe other two, one of them uses CPI.\n\n426\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.630\nOr we used our budget in our plan,\nbut they really focused on cost,\n\n427\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.010\nand really estimate to\ncompletion is about cost.\n\n428\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.180\nMost people care about how much\nmore money they need to spend.\n\n429\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.390\nBut we haven't really been\ntaking schedule into account.\n\n430\n00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.080\nNow they all use earned value, and\nearned value involves scheduling, so\n\n431\n00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.110\nthere is some of that.\n\n432\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.550\nBut the third variation\nbrings in scheduling.\n\n433\n00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:20.040\nAnd the reason it does it, is when\nyou got a project that's in trouble,\n\n434\n00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.600\nyou've got your triple constraints, right.\n\n435\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.140\nYou've got your quality or\nyour requirements, you've got your cost or\n\n436\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.290\nyour budget, and you've got your\nschedule or your time, right.\n\n437\n00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.130\nSo cost, time, quality, those are the\nthree big constraints that we deal with.\n\n438\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.750\nAnd when you have a problem, you can\nnormally fix it by either increasing your\n\n439\n00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:42.440\ncost, or decreasing your quality,\nincreasing your schedule, whatever, right.\n\n440\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.420\nAnd when you adjust one\nit adjusts the other.\n\n441\n00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:49.860\nAnd so sometimes it's not so much the cost\nthat's the problem, as it is the schedule.\n\n442\n00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.870\nAnd with each of the ones\nwe've been looking at,\n\n443\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.070\nwe really haven't accounted for that.\n\n444\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.380\nWe've said, we've got a problem,\nwe'll figure out how to fix it later,\n\n445\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.550\nwe just need to identify\nthat we have a problem.\n\n446\n00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:02.350\nBut what if you've got a project\nsponsor that comes in and says look.\n\n447\n00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.180\nThis is the date you're going to finish.\n\n448\n00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.010\nWhen we planned this project, you said\nyou were gonna be done January first.\n\n449\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.720\nYou're going to be done January first.\n\n450\n00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.340\nWell, if you're in that scenario,\nwhere your project dates are kinda fixed.\n\n451\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.770\nYou want to hold to that project date,\nyou've gotta factor schedule into this,\n\n452\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.910\nbecause you're not gonna change it.\n\n453\n00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:20.890\nThe schedule's not gonna change.\n\n454\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.380\nSo it's gotta be a bigger\npart of the formula.\n\n455\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.790\nAnd so we can take the formulas that we've\nseen, and adjust them just a little bit.\n\n456\n00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:29.330\nRight?\n\n457\n00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.680\nSo here's the third variation,\nand with this one\n\n458\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.240\nyou'll notice the big differences that\nwe're bringing in accumulative SPI.\n\n459\n00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:37.930\nRight?\n\n460\n00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.450\nWhat we saw a moment ago was budget\nat completion divided by CPI, or\n\n461\n00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.700\naccumulative CPI.\n\n462\n00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.020\nBut here we're going\nback to the old formula.\n\n463\n00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:50.420\nThe actual cost, plus the budget\nat completion, earned value.\n\n464\n00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.000\nOkay.\n\n465\n00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.360\nSo straightforward formula right there.\n\n466\n00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.140\nNothing original, right?\n\n467\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.260\nThe original formula was actual\ncost plus bottom up etcetera.\n\n468\n00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.630\nRight?\nThat's the real formula for EAC,\n\n469\n00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.140\nthat original one.\n\n470\n00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.240\nBut the first variation we saw was\nEAC equals AC plus BAC minus EV.\n\n471\n00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.700\nAnd the difference here,\nis we're dividing that by our CPI,\n\n472\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.450\nour cumulative CPI times\nour cumulative SPI.\n\n473\n00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.980\nOur cost performance and\nour schedule performance index.\n\n474\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.730\nWe're factoring both of these in, and\nremember, if you've got an index that's at\n\n475\n00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:28.350\na one, one times one is one, and any\nnumber divided by one is just that number.\n\n476\n00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:33.590\nAnd we end up right back at that formula,\nEAC = AC plus BAC- EV Right?\n\n477\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:38.270\nBut if your cost performance index is off,\nor your schedule performance index is off,\n\n478\n00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.580\nthen that's gonna effect the ultimate\nEAC that this results in.\n\n479\n00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.659\nSo this one requires a little\nbit more data to be fed into it\n\n480\n00:23:44.659 --> 00:23:46.533\nto get accurate results out of it.\n\n481\n00:23:46.533 --> 00:23:49.595\nBut, if you're dealing\nwith a fixed schedule,\n\n482\n00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:53.404\nif you intend to fold to\nthe current project schedule dates,\n\n483\n00:23:53.404 --> 00:23:56.934\nthen you're going to need to\nfactor in SPI, all right?\n\n484\n00:23:56.934 --> 00:23:59.880\nAnd that's really the only\ntime we use this variation.\n\n485\n00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.990\nVariation three is just when\nyou've got a hold of those dates.\n\n486\n00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.140\nSo in the word problem,\nif they tell you that,\n\n487\n00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.960\nif the dates are not flexible,\nbe thinking about this formula here.\n\n488\n00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.300\nAnd this formula requires\na lot of information, and so\n\n489\n00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.010\nyou gotta make sure all the information\nis in the question otherwise you gotta\n\n490\n00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.070\nchoose that not enough\ninformation provided.\n\n491\n00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.460\nNow I made a little note here.\n\n492\n00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.090\nThis formula only works when over budget,\nall right?\n\n493\n00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.320\nWhat does that mean?\n\n494\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:26.900\nWell, if you're under budget, right, if\nthings are going well, your CPI multiplied\n\n495\n00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.640\nby your SPI starts to skew things and\nthings can really start to get off, right?\n\n496\n00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.540\nAnd then it doesn't work out quite right.\n\n497\n00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.660\nYour numbers get skewed and\nit kinda breaks things.\n\n498\n00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.840\nSo if you're under budget, in other\nwords if things are going great for\n\n499\n00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.810\nyour project,\nthen you don't need this formula, and\n\n500\n00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.840\nyou're probably not even calculating EACs\nat that point because you're under budget.\n\n501\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.470\nBut either way,\nthis one doesn't work, right?\n\n502\n00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.620\nSo we need to make sure that our budget\nis bad, that we are over budget and\n\n503\n00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.360\nthat's where this formula's\ngoing to come in, right?\n\n504\n00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.180\nSo let's see an example of that.\n\n505\n00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.850\nThis is the only formula we have that\nactually has that kind of contingency.\n\n506\n00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.470\nAll the other ones work, no matter what.\n\n507\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.060\nAll right.\nSo, here we've got an example, and\n\n508\n00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.080\nit says changes to your project have been\nfairly effective at getting back inline\n\n509\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.330\nwith your budget of $250,000.\n\n510\n00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.790\nHowever further change is needed.\n\n511\n00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.650\nYour project sponsor has indicated\nthat she will not approve\n\n512\n00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.530\nany further schedule changes.\n\n513\n00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:20.000\nAdjust your EAC to account for\nthe fixed schedule.\n\n514\n00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.990\nYour current project SPI,\nyour cumulative SPI is 0.97, right?\n\n515\n00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:28.190\nThis is the same project from the last two\nexamples, so we've already got the other\n\n516\n00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:34.120\ninformation, our actual cost,\nour BAC, our EV, our CPI and our SPI.\n\n517\n00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.100\nWe can go and get those and kind of\nplug them in from the other side, right?\n\n518\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.030\nSo our EAC is going equal our actual cost,\nright,\n\n519\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.040\nwhich I take a look at the last one.\n\n520\n00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.280\nWhere was our actual cost?\n\n521\n00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.760\nHere.\n$175,000 so I'll plug that in, $175,000.\n\n522\n00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.820\nAnd I'm going to add to\nthat my budgeted completion\n\n523\n00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:01.070\nminus my earned value, and I can get\nboth of those from the first one where\n\n524\n00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.810\nmy budget at completion was $250 dollars\nand my earned value was $160,000, right?\n\n525\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:05.940\nSo let me just copy these.\n\n526\n00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:12.520\nWe're just going to lift those right out\nof there, kind of cheat a little bit.\n\n527\n00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.050\nThere we go, and\nthen I need to divide that by my CPI,\n\n528\n00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:22.382\nmy cumulative CPI,\nwhich I believe was 0.96, wasn't it?\n\n529\n00:26:22.382 --> 00:26:23.720\nMm-hm.\n\n530\n00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.071\n>> Let's go find out.\n\n531\n00:26:27.071 --> 00:26:34.790\n0.96, yep, times 0.97,\nwhich is our SPI, okay?\n\n532\n00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.820\nSo when I start to plug all that data in,\nI'm gonna get my results.\n\n533\n00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.750\nNow, my biggest challenge here is I've\ngot some order of operations that\n\n534\n00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.350\nI've gotta execute here, right, the whole\nplease my dear Aunt Sally kind of thing.\n\n535\n00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.470\nSo I've got a series of parenthesis\nhere that I've gotta sort out.\n\n536\n00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.339\nMy budgeted completion minus my earned\nvalue, that needs to happen first, so\n\n537\n00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:54.310\nI've got $250,000 minus\n$160,000 which is $90,000.\n\n538\n00:26:54.310 --> 00:27:00.133\nAll right, so we'll just change\nthat to a quick $90,000, all right?\n\n539\n00:27:00.133 --> 00:27:06.315\nAnd then I'm not even going to pretend\nto do 0.96 times 0.97 in my head,\n\n540\n00:27:06.315 --> 00:27:09.933\nso let's just get\nthe calculator on that one.\n\n541\n00:27:09.933 --> 00:27:14.441\n0.96 times 0.97 is 0.9312, all right.\n\n542\n00:27:14.441 --> 00:27:16.657\nNow, normally I round these things, but\n\n543\n00:27:16.657 --> 00:27:19.644\nthat's a small enough number\nthat I might just keep it.\n\n544\n00:27:19.644 --> 00:27:21.910\n0.9132 I think is what I said, right?\n\n545\n00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:22.880\n9312.\n\n546\n00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.260\nAlways gotta double check the math.\n\n547\n00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.500\nI'm terrible about that.\n\n548\n00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.500\nAll right, there.\n\n549\n00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.901\nSo now I've got a little bit\nsimpler of a formula to handle, but\n\n550\n00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:32.683\nnotice that this portion\nhas to be done first.\n\n551\n00:27:32.683 --> 00:27:35.323\nIf you get the order of\noperations out of order,\n\n552\n00:27:35.323 --> 00:27:37.730\nthen things really get messed up, right?\n\n553\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.031\nSo now I need to take this and\n\n554\n00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:48.953\ndo 90,000 divided by 0.9312.\n\n555\n00:27:48.953 --> 00:27:52.626\nAnd I get $96,649 which\nI will round 96649.\n\n556\n00:28:00.866 --> 00:28:07.479\nSo this is just gonna become $96,649.\n\n557\n00:28:07.479 --> 00:28:09.899\nAll right, I guess I don't really\nneed these parentheses anymore.\n\n558\n00:28:09.899 --> 00:28:13.170\nAnd then I can add that up,\nand I'll have my new EAC.\n\n559\n00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.350\nSo if I add $250,000, ugh, shoot.\n\n560\n00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:20.730\n175, let me subtract that back out.\n\n561\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:21.800\nSo I'm going to add $175,000 dollars.\n\n562\n00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.940\nOtherwise my project\nwill be way over budget.\n\n563\n00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:29.659\nI get $271,649, right?\n\n564\n00:28:29.659 --> 00:28:34.990\nNow, and the problem the changes\n\n565\n00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.970\nto my project have been fairly effective\nat getting us back inline, but\n\n566\n00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.135\nI can see that things are actually worse,\nokay?\n\n567\n00:28:43.135 --> 00:28:44.845\nNow, how does that happen?\n\n568\n00:28:44.845 --> 00:28:49.230\nWhy did I think I was affected of giving\nback to 250 but things are actually worse?\n\n569\n00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.130\nWhat the heck happened?\n\n570\n00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.300\nThe schedule happened, okay?\n\n571\n00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:58.080\nI'm behind schedule, If I'm behind\nschedule, then that's a problem.\n\n572\n00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.432\nI need to be at or ahead of schedule.\n\n573\n00:29:00.432 --> 00:29:01.060\nAll right?\n\n574\n00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.410\nBut in this case I'm not\nI'm behind schedule, and so\n\n575\n00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.920\nthat makes this number go higher.\n\n576\n00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.460\nSo while my cost, my CPI,\nis pretty close to 0.96, it's not 1.\n\n577\n00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.120\nIt's not perfect, right?\n\n578\n00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:18.270\nAnd even though I'm making strides to get\nbetter, ,y schedule's still messed up.\n\n579\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.040\nAnd when I factor that in,\nI get an EAC of 271.\n\n580\n00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.160\nThings are not right.\n\n581\n00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.990\nI need to fix my schedule.\n\n582\n00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.715\nI need to get that back in line,\nand my schedule's not that bad.\n\n583\n00:29:27.715 --> 00:29:29.950\n0.97 is pretty close, right?\n\n584\n00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.890\nBut if you've got a fixed target\ndate that you're working on,\n\n585\n00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.050\nclose is not good enough and\nit starts to skew the formula.\n\n586\n00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:40.000\nCombined with a budget that's not right,\nthen it gets even worse.\n\n587\n00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.410\nAnd so now you might have a project\nthat looks like it's in good shape or\n\n588\n00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.650\nat least better than it was, and it turns\nout to not be in that good of shape.\n\n589\n00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.680\nAnd now I've really got to pull in my\nresources and try and get this corrected.\n\n590\n00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.960\nSo factoring in SPI it makes a difference.\n\n591\n00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.630\nIt really does, and it is important.\n\n592\n00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:03.170\nSo in my first example we got an EAC\nof $265,000, then we worked to fix it.\n\n593\n00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.800\nAnd we saw where we got\nit down to $260,000.\n\n594\n00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.800\nBut when we factored in that schedule,\nback up, even higher than where\n\n595\n00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.350\nwe were in the very beginning\nbecause we never calculated this in.\n\n596\n00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.650\nAnd the reality is,\nif a fixed date was part of the equation,\n\n597\n00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.360\nwe should have been using this\nformula from the beginning.\n\n598\n00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.400\nWe shouldn't even have wasted our\ntime with the other formula's because\n\n599\n00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.460\nthat schedule's so important, all right.\n\n600\n00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:27.340\nNow the original formula way back,\nthis guy, because it's got\n\n601\n00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.860\nbottom up ETC's coming up from all\nthe people in the field and stuff,\n\n602\n00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:36.000\nthis Is taking into account things like\nschedule and earned values and all that.\n\n603\n00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.226\nAnd so this is the most reliable\nof all the formulas, and so\n\n604\n00:30:39.226 --> 00:30:41.180\nthis is the true formula for EAC.\n\n605\n00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.750\nIt's the one you wanna use assuming\nyou can those bottom-up ETCs.\n\n606\n00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.550\nThat's really important, right.\n\n607\n00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.730\nIf you don't have that, that's where\nyou've got the three variations.\n\n608\n00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:55.080\nJust to run over the variations again,\nthe first variation, EAC forecast for\n\n609\n00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.470\nETC work performed at the budgeted rate.\n\n610\n00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:00.480\nThis is one that we wanna do if we\nwant fairly accurate numbers, but\n\n611\n00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.520\nwe don't wanna collect ETCs for\neverything, that we know the work is being\n\n612\n00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.680\nperformed at the budgeted rate, that we\nknow things are kind of going as expected,\n\n613\n00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.270\nand we use this and we get our numbers and\nthey're pretty accurate, all right?\n\n614\n00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:16.960\nThe next one was EAC forecast for\nETC work performed the present CPI.\n\n615\n00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.150\nThis is where we're just in a hurry,\nand so we take our CPI,\n\n616\n00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:25.010\nour cumulative CPI, and we just apply\nit to the budget, and we get a number.\n\n617\n00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.010\nThis is not necessarily indicative of\nwhat's actually happening in the field, so\n\n618\n00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.770\nit's a ballpark.\n\n619\n00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:29.670\nWe use it when we're in a hurry.\n\n620\n00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.790\nAnd then number three was EAC forecast for\n\n621\n00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.020\nETC work considering both SPI and\nCPI factors.\n\n622\n00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:41.800\nAnd this is the one that we use when we\nknow we've got a schedule that has to be\n\n623\n00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.070\nmet, that we don't have flexibility there.\n\n624\n00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.640\nIt's not all about cost.\n\n625\n00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.546\nSchedule needs to be factored in, too.\n\n626\n00:31:46.546 --> 00:31:49.690\nSo on the exam when they ask you a\nquestion, it's gonna be in the wording of\n\n627\n00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.045\nthe question which one you\nshould be leaning towards.\n\n628\n00:31:52.045 --> 00:31:54.573\nAnd if they don't give you any hints,\n\n629\n00:31:54.573 --> 00:31:58.839\nthen you either assume the default one,\nthe original you know,\n\n630\n00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:03.910\nac plus your bottom of atc, or you just\nlook at the numbers they give you.\n\n631\n00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.950\nLook at the numbers and see which one\ngives you enough numbers to run a formula,\n\n632\n00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.610\nand that kinda give you a hint there too.\n\n633\n00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.830\nAll of these result in an EAC, it's\njust some are more accurate than others.\n\n634\n00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.350\n>> So Don, that's a great reminder for\n\n635\n00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.500\nus to think about when we\nstart taking a look at EAC.\n\n636\n00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.620\nRemember that we're determining\nEAC to really help us when we know\n\n637\n00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:25.210\nthat that budget is not gonna be complete,\nand yet we need to still figure out\n\n638\n00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:29.730\nhow much money we really do need to have\non hand to make everything work as well.\n\n639\n00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.980\nThose variations are gonna come in handy\nwhen you have enough information to\n\n640\n00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.630\ndo them.\n\n641\n00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.840\nBut remember also on the exam, you may\nfind out that you don't have enough\n\n642\n00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.500\ninformation, it's a great reminder and\nit's a valid answer as well.\n\n643\n00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.880\nDon, any last words of advice for\n\n644\n00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.450\nsomebody saying, I think I'm ready but\nit's a little bit more daunting than\n\n645\n00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.800\nwhat we've seen before in all\nthe previous earned value estimates.\n\n646\n00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.300\n>> Practice, the more of these you work\nthrough, the better you'll get and\n\n647\n00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.440\nthere will be word problems on the exam\ntypically, so interpreting the numbers,\n\n648\n00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.670\nyou can run through my examples that\nI gave you, I just made all these up.\n\n649\n00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.430\nBut there's practice exams that\nare out there that are really good,\n\n650\n00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.778\nthere's a lot of books out there\nthat come with practice questions.\n\n651\n00:33:06.778 --> 00:33:11.088\nOn the itpro.tv site, we use transcender\npractice exams, you can do those.\n\n652\n00:33:11.088 --> 00:33:14.070\nThere's various other resources\nout there on the Internet, but\n\n653\n00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:17.432\nreally practice, and if you're worried\nabout getting the numbers right,\n\n654\n00:33:17.432 --> 00:33:21.680\nuse software like Microsoft Project, and\nyou can just put in fake numbers in there.\n\n655\n00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.710\n>> And\nthen you can calculate these out by hand,\n\n656\n00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.590\nand then you can let Project-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n657\n00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.590\n>> Calculate up the numbers and\n\n658\n00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.510\nyou can compare, right?\n\n659\n00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.730\nAnd see which ones you get and\nkinda where those numbers stand, and\n\n660\n00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:31.740\nhow accurate you were.\n\n661\n00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.630\nSo kinda a quick way to\nmake up your own problems.\n\n662\n00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:35.240\nBut definitely, practice,\npractice, practice,\n\n663\n00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.100\ncuz these are not formulas\nyou're gonna use every day.\n\n664\n00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.360\nThey might be formers you never use ever,\n\n665\n00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.460\nbecause you have software that does it for\nyou.\n\n666\n00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.490\nSo, the exam may be one of the only\ntimes you have to do this by hand.\n\n667\n00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.950\nYou've got to prove that you\nunderstand how the formula works.\n\n668\n00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:48.950\nThat's what the exam really wants.\n\n669\n00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.510\nThey don't care if you\nknow how to do math,\n\n670\n00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.640\nthey care that you know\nwhat the formula does.\n\n671\n00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.410\nAnd so\nyou've gotta make sure you know those.\n\n672\n00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:56.760\nAnd you gotta memorize the formulas.\n\n673\n00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.050\nI'll give that same piece of advice I gave\nearlier, which is, At the beginning of\n\n674\n00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:04.460\nthe exam, take a few moments to write\ndown the formulas on a piece of paper.\n\n675\n00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.910\nThat way, when you get to the formula\nquestions, you can just answer it and it's\n\n676\n00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.320\nnot something you're having to rack your\nbrain trying to remember the formula for.\n\n677\n00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.740\n>> Excellent words of advice when\nwe're getting ready for that exam.\n\n678\n00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:15.490\nThank you, again, Don for\nthe examples there.\n\n679\n00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:18.890\nThey really did help clarify\na few of the little ins and\n\n680\n00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.750\nouts that we may not think about.\n\n681\n00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.410\nAnd thank you also for\njoining us today, too.\n\n682\n00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:26.086\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n683\n00:34:26.086 --> 00:34:26.730\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n684\n00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:30.780\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",
