          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:09.398\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:12.596\nIn this segment we're gonna give you\na general overview of our upcoming\n\n3\n00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:13.820\nProject+ series.\n\n4\n00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.360\nNow, Ronnie, there're a lot of people\nout there that are interested in project\n\n5\n00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.730\nmanagement, CompTIA has come to\ntheir rescue with a certification,\n\n6\n00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.390\nand we're gonna do a series on that.\n\n7\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.740\nAnd I guess a good place to start with\nthis overview is, what type of person, or\n\n8\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.600\nwho is the intended audience for\nour upcoming episodes?\n\n9\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.990\n>> Whenever we start taking\na look at the CompTIA Project+,\n\n10\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.310\nwhat we're trying to do is make sure\nthat you have the proper amount of\n\n11\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.020\nknowledge that you have to be able to\nmake sure you face the Project+ exam.\n\n12\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.900\nBut also that you have knowledge, and\n\n13\n00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.890\nyou have skills, to make sure that you\ncan go into project management as well.\n\n14\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.690\nA lot of times what you're looking for\nat this point, if you're a candidate for\n\n15\n00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.690\nthe Project+, is that you have about\n12 months of experience in working with\n\n16\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.070\nprojects of small to medium size or\n\n17\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.450\nyou've been a project team member\non a larger type of project.\n\n18\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.080\nBut yet now you're actually\nseeking more certification so\n\n19\n00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.390\nthat you can become a project\nleader in project management.\n\n20\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.730\nSo that's usually who the general\naudience is going to be for.\n\n21\n00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.440\nAnybody who has also ended up working with\nsome of the project management types of\n\n22\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.156\ntools out there.\n\n23\n00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:14.620\nLike, Microsoft project, Primavera,\nthese actually help you to actually\n\n24\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.752\nunderstand the skills that we'll be\ncovering during our Project+ exam as well.\n\n25\n00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:22.470\n>> Now Ronnie, now that we know who is the\nintended audience, what is a good general\n\n26\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.120\noverview, just the basic outline of what\nwe're gonna cover inside of this series?\n\n27\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.870\n>> When we start taking a look at what\nwe're gonna be covering in the Project+\n\n28\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.120\nseries, we're gonna take the actual\nCompTIA official exam objectives and\n\n29\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.560\nmake sure that we go over each and\n\n30\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.740\nevery one of those exam objectives to make\nsure that you are prepared for the exam.\n\n31\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.510\nWhat you'll see is that the exact itself\nis divided into five different categories\n\n32\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.680\nor domain objective for us, and\nif we take a look at my computer,\n\n33\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.920\nwe will go ahead and\ntake a look at them right here.\n\n34\n00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.750\nIs that it is broken down in this way,\nwe have the pre-project set up,\n\n35\n00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.880\nwe have the project planning,\nthe project execution, change control and\n\n36\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.900\ncommunication and of course,\nthe project closure itself.\n\n37\n00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.000\nAnd if this is sounding familiar to\nyou because you have been in project\n\n38\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.010\nmanagement for some point in time, well,\n\n39\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.470\nyou'll notice these as being the five\ndifferent phases of project management.\n\n40\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.100\nAnd they've gone ahead and they've\nactually weighted them a little bit\n\n41\n00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.390\ndifferently, where you can actually see\nit actually adds to up to 100% here.\n\n42\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.920\n12% of the exam will be on the initiation,\na whole 30% will be during the planning,\n\n43\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.090\nanother 23% in the execution and\ndelivery, of course.\n\n44\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.730\nAnd then another 27% here on change\ncontrol and communication, and\n\n45\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.500\nfinally the project closeout\nitself is another 9% as well.\n\n46\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.700\nAnd this gives us that overall total of\nabout 100 questions that we'll be facing,\n\n47\n00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.010\nand we'll get about 90 minutes here\nto actually do the entire exam.\n\n48\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.470\nSo it's timed, and you do have time\nto actually answer questions but\n\n49\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.358\nyou can't dawdle around if\nyou're gonna be doing this exam.\n\n50\n00:02:49.358 --> 00:02:52.100\nSo you wanna make sure that you\nactually do get prepared for it.\n\n51\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.670\nSo watch the series\nthat we're about to do.\n\n52\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.900\nMake sure you do understand, and make sure\nyou actually do practice some of these\n\n53\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.870\ndifferent scenarios that\nwe'll be taking a look at.\n\n54\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.270\n>> Now Ronnie, I want you to wet our\nappetite a little bit with maybe\n\n55\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.980\nthe details,\n\n56\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.900\nthe specifics of what we might encounter\nin our series covering those five domains.\n\n57\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.760\n>> Whenever we start taking a look here,\n\n58\n00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.920\nthe exam objectives will\npretty much be our guides.\n\n59\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.490\nSo what I recommend to you is\nthat you go out CompTIA and\n\n60\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.500\nthat you download their exam objectives.\n\n61\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.210\nAnd they'll be the exact copy\nof what I'm showing you here.\n\n62\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.450\nAnd we'll take a look here at just some\nof the brief things that we'll dive into.\n\n63\n00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.660\nWe initiate here,\nin other words the pre-project setup.\n\n64\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.910\nWe will take a look at each one of this\nobjectives here talking about what it\n\n65\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.325\ntakes to get a project\nstarted in the initiation.\n\n66\n00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.070\nWhere we haven't done anything yet but\n\n67\n00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.910\nwe just need to get to the point where\nwe can get a project charter up and\n\n68\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.920\nrunning, and how do we get to that point\nand what does it end up looking like.\n\n69\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.620\nWe'll also, of course,\noutline the project life cycles and\n\n70\n00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.470\nwe'll actually end up taking a look\nat some of the different structures\n\n71\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.420\nthat we end up working in inside of\na project team for different companies.\n\n72\n00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.260\nWe'll talk about about\nthe different matrices as well.\n\n73\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.050\nIn the project planning phase here,\n\n74\n00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.995\nthis will take the most time that we'll\nspend in our entire episode here.\n\n75\n00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:07.270\nWhere we start taking a look at some of\nthe documents that we have to have on\n\n76\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.640\nhand, and we break down the terminology\nthat you'll need to learn for\n\n77\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.430\nthe CompTIA exam as well and we'll also\nuse the industry wide terminology as well,\n\n78\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.110\nto make sure that you actually do take\nsome time here to learn that too.\n\n79\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.100\nYou'll see that we'll talk about approval\nprocesses as well as the way to do\n\n80\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.620\nsome analysis on our project as well,\nby learning about the PERT,\n\n81\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.740\nhere, and the Gantt chart, and\nusing the critical path method,\n\n82\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.100\nwe'll see several examples of that, we'll\ntake a look at networking diagramming.\n\n83\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.340\nYou'll also end up seeing the ideal,\nof course,\n\n84\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.630\nof making sure that we have\ncommunication plans that we have set up,\n\n85\n00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.325\nas well as resource and\nquality management.\n\n86\n00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:49.970\nWe'll take a brief view at\nthe idea of cost management,\n\n87\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.335\nin other words budgeting,\njust a little bit.\n\n88\n00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:54.800\nWe'll talk about procurement and\nhow we ensure that we get that, and\n\n89\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.775\nthen of course transition phases.\n\n90\n00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.060\nWe'll also end up seeing that\nduring the execution and\n\n91\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.000\ndelivery we'll deal with the idea of human\nresources as well as resources themselves.\n\n92\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.210\nTalk about the idea of how we\nbegin great on a project which is,\n\n93\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.950\nof course, a project kick off meeting and\nhow to organize one of those.\n\n94\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.315\nWe'll also take a look of course\nat the role that organization\n\n95\n00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:19.570\ngovernment has on our project execution.\n\n96\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.210\nWe'll also end up taking a look at how\n\n97\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.810\nwe use the different components that we'll\nend up finding out on our project here\n\n98\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.220\nto help us to make sure that we manage\nour projects a little bit better.\n\n99\n00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.050\nAnd then of course we'll take a look\nat the change and communication and\n\n100\n00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.510\nthe control here.\n\n101\n00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.260\nThe very fact is, we'll see that\nexecution as well as the monitoring and\n\n102\n00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.910\ncontrolling phase of most projects\nessentially go hand in hand.\n\n103\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.980\nThey don't really follow sequentially, and\nso we'll also see proper change management\n\n104\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.810\nprocedures and that will be kind of\nthe majority of what we'll see there,\n\n105\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.020\nis how do we manage changes that come\non to our project and then, of course,\n\n106\n00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.240\ncommunication processes as well.\n\n107\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.760\nWe'll also take a look at all of these\nearned value types of measurements and\n\n108\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.390\nresults, and we'll go over each and\nevery one of these so\n\n109\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.020\nthat we ensure that we have examples\nas well as how to actually get\n\n110\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.680\nthe value out of them that we need to so\nthat we can get our project back on track.\n\n111\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.400\nAnd lastly,\n\n112\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.840\nwe'll talk about the importance of\nthe formal closing of our project as well.\n\n113\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.670\nWe'll go through the different project\nstages as far as the close goes.\n\n114\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.310\nAnd what we should end up with in the end\nhere of the documentation that we need\n\n115\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.150\nto show that we've done everything that\nwe can do to officially close out of\n\n116\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.140\nour project.\n\n117\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.330\nSo there's a lot of details that\nwe'll be going over in our series.\n\n118\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.420\nAnd you'll see that we\nactually have taken the time,\n\n119\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.650\nif you download the exam objectives, that\nwe will have covered every single one of\n\n120\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.830\nthese exam objectives when\nwe are done with our series.\n\n121\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.550\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n122\n00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.920\nNow Ronnie,\nthat brings us to the actual exam itself.\n\n123\n00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.880\nHow does one go about actually\ngetting signed up for the exam and\n\n124\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.680\nhow much is it going to cost.\n\n125\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.970\nGive me some of the details or\n\n126\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.480\ngive our viewers should I say some of\nthe details so they know what to expect.\n\n127\n00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.650\n>> Normally you take the exam by going\nto a third party testing provider,\n\n128\n00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.300\nsuch as Pearson Vue.\n\n129\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.610\nNow you can actually go online, actually\ngo ahead and register for the exam there.\n\n130\n00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.500\nMake sure that as you do so,\nyou go ahead and you know a couple things.\n\n131\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.830\nOne, you need to make sure that you\nactually know what the exam number is.\n\n132\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.650\nAnd apparently I already clicked on that.\n\n133\n00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.300\nLet me show you what the exam number is,\nso I can scroll back up here.\n\n134\n00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.310\nSo you wanna make sure that you have\nthis exam number right here, PK0-003.\n\n135\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.990\nAnd then, when you go and\nregister at Pearson Vue, it will\n\n136\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.070\nkick you out to CompTIA's website that\nwill allow you to buy the exam voucher.\n\n137\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.530\nNow, the exam voucher is\nself cost about $285.\n\n138\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.370\nSo, it's fairly expensive\nin US dollars here.\n\n139\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.370\nSo, when you do take the exam,\nmake sure you do understand
